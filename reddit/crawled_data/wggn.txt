If you're just starting to learn the language, I would recommend going without an IDE for now. Just write text files and manually compile with javac until you got a good hang of it, before letting the IDE do everything for you.
I think scala is too different from java, making it relatively hard for average java developers to switch, compared to for example Kotlin. Which makes it hard to get scala developers.

Altho he was forced to join the Nazi party, Von Braun's interest in rockets was specifically for the application of space travel, not for killing people. After hearing the news from London, he said that "the rocket worked perfectly, except for landing on the wrong planet."

> In 1939, I was officially demanded to join the National Socialist Party. At this time I was already Technical Director at the Army Rocket Center at Peenem√ºnde (Baltic Sea). The technical work carried out there had, in the meantime, attracted more and more attention in higher levels. Thus, my refusal to join the party would have meant that I would have to abandon the work of my life. Therefore, I decided to join. My membership in the party did not involve any political activity.

What with controversial dismissals and resignations, growing self-censorship within the leading media groups and a system of ‚Äúkisha clubs‚Äù (reporters‚Äô clubs) that discriminate against freelancers and foreign reporters, journalists have difficulty serving the public interest and fulfilling their role as democracy‚Äôs watchdogs. Many journalists, both local and foreign, are harassed by government officials, who do not hide their hostility towards the media. Members of nationalist groups on social media also intimidate and harass journalists who dare to question the government or tackle ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù subjects. Despite UN protests, the government continues to refuse any debate about a law protecting ‚ÄúSpecially Designated Secrets,‚Äù under which whistleblowers, journalists, and bloggers face up to ten years in prison if convicted of publishing information obtained ‚Äúillegally.‚Äù

In an effort to preserve your existing Container set up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Facebook Container.

I guess the per-infraction is not correct

> Fines for infringements will be considered on a case-by-case basis and will take a number of criteria into consideration, such as the intentional nature of the infringement, how many subjects were affected and any previous infringements by the controller or processor.

> If a controller or processor makes several infringements, the total amount of the administrative fine will not exceed the fine for the most serious infringement for the same or linked processing operations.

> Separate to these fines and penalties, individuals will have the right to claim compensation for any damage suffered as a result of violating the GDPR.

It might be different now with the fines set to 4% of global turnover ~~per infraction~~, so about $1.6 billion.

> As a former SR-71 pilot, and a professional keynote speaker, the question I'm most often asked is "How fast would that SR-71 fly?" I can be assured of hearing that question several times at any event I attend. It's an interesting question, given the aircraft's proclivity for speed, but there really isn't one number to give, as the jet would always give you a little more speed if you wanted it to. It was common to see 35 miles a minute. Because we flew a programmed Mach number on most missions, and never wanted to harm the plane in any way, we never let it run out to any limits of temperature or speed. Thus, each SR-71 pilot had his own individual ‚Äúhigh‚Äù speed that he saw at some point on some mission. I saw mine over Libya when Khadafy fired two missiles my way, and max power was in order. Let‚Äôs just say that the plane truly loved speed and effortlessly took us to Mach numbers we hadn‚Äôt previously seen. So it was with great surprise, when at the end of one of my presentations, someone asked, ‚Äúwhat was the slowest you ever flew the Blackbird?‚Äù This was a first. After giving it some thought, I was reminded of a story that I had never shared before, and relayed the following. I was flying the SR-71 out of RAF Mildenhall, England , with my back-seater, Walt Watson; we were returning from a mission over Europe and the Iron Curtain when we received a radio transmission from home base. As we scooted across Denmark in three minutes, we learned that a small RAF base in the English countryside had requested an SR-71 fly-past. The air cadet commander there was a former Blackbird pilot, and thought it would be a motivating moment for the young lads to see the mighty SR-71 perform a low approach. No problem, we were happy to do it. After a quick aerial refueling over the North Sea , we proceeded to find the small airfield. Walter had a myriad of sophisticated navigation equipment in the back seat, and began to vector me toward the field. Descending to subsonic speeds, we found ourselves over a densely wooded area in a slight haze. Like most former WWII British airfields, the one we were looking for had a small tower and little surrounding infrastructure. Walter told me we were close and that I should be able to see the field, but I saw nothing. Nothing but trees as far as I could see in the haze. We got a little lower, and I pulled the throttles back from 325 knots we were at. With the gear up, anything under 275 was just uncomfortable. Walt said we were practically over the field‚Äîyet; there was nothing in my windscreen. I banked the jet and started a gentle circling maneuver in hopes of picking up anything that looked like a field. Meanwhile, below, the cadet commander had taken the cadets up on the catwalk of the tower in order to get a prime view of the fly-past. It was a quiet, still day with no wind and partial gray overcast. Walter continued to give me indications that the field should be below us but in the overcast and haze, I couldn't see it.. The longer we continued to peer out the window and circle, the slower we got. With our power back, the awaiting cadets heard nothing. I must have had good instructors in my flying career, as something told me I better cross-check the gauges. As I noticed the airspeed indicator slide below 160 knots, my heart stopped and my adrenalin-filled left hand pushed two throttles full forward. At this point we weren't really flying, but were falling in a slight bank. Just at the moment that both afterburners lit with a thunderous roar of flame (and what a joyous feeling that was) the aircraft fell into full view of the shocked observers on the tower. Shattering the still quiet of that morning, they now had 107 feet of fire-breathing titanium in their face as the plane leveled and accelerated, in full burner, on the tower side of the infield, closer than expected, maintaining what could only be described as some sort of ultimate knife-edge pass. Quickly reaching the field boundary, we proceeded back to Mildenhall without incident. We didn't say a word for those next 14 minutes. After landing, our commander greeted us, and we were both certain he was reaching for our wings. Instead, he heartily shook our hands and said the commander had told him it was the greatest SR-71 fly-past he had ever seen, especially how we had surprised them with such a precise maneuver that could only be described as breathtaking. He said that some of the cadet‚Äôs hats were blown off and the sight of the plan form of the plane in full afterburner dropping right in front of them was unbelievable. Walt and I both understood the concept of ‚Äúbreathtaking‚Äù very well that morning, and sheepishly replied that they were just excited to see our low approach. As we retired to the equipment room to change from space suits to flight suits, we just sat there-we hadn't spoken a word since ‚Äúthe pass.‚Äù Finally, Walter looked at me and said, ‚ÄúOne hundred fifty-six knots. What did you see?‚Äù Trying to find my voice, I stammered, ‚ÄúOne hundred fifty-two.‚Äù We sat in silence for a moment. Then Walt said, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ever do that to me again!‚Äù And I never did. A year later, Walter and I were having lunch in the Mildenhall Officer‚Äôs club, and overheard an officer talking to some cadets about an SR-71 fly-past that he had seen one day. Of course, by now the story included kids falling off the tower and screaming as the heat of the jet singed their eyebrows. Noticing our HABU patches, as we stood there with lunch trays in our hands, he asked us to verify to the cadets that such a thing had occurred. Walt just shook his head and said, ‚ÄúIt was probably just a routine low approach; they're pretty impressive in that plane.‚Äù Impressive indeed. Little did I realize after relaying this experience to my audience that day that it would become one of the most popular and most requested stories. It‚Äôs ironic that people are interested in how slow the world‚Äôs fastest jet can fly. Regardless of your speed, however, it‚Äôs always a good idea to keep that cross-check up‚Ä¶and keep your Mach up, too.

[Strange that they still thought this way after all the luck they had on the 1st STS launch.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-1#Mission_anomalies)

> - The astronauts' on-orbit visual inspection showed significant damage to the thermal protection tiles on the OMS/RCS pods at the orbiter's aft end, and John Young reported that two tiles on the nose looked like someone had taken "big bites out of them."
> - The orbiter's heat shield was damaged when an overpressure wave from the solid rocket booster caused a forward RCS oxidizer strut to fail.
> - The same overpressure wave also forced the shuttle's "body flap"‚Äìan extension on the orbiter's underbelly that helps to control pitch during reentry‚Äìinto an angle well beyond the point where cracking or rupture of its hydraulic system would have been expected. Such damage would have made a controlled descent impossible, with John Young later admitting that had the crew known about this, they would have flown the shuttle up to a safe altitude and ejected, causing Columbia to be lost on the first flight.
> - During remarks at a 2003 gathering, John Young stated that a protruding tile gap filler ducted hot gas into the right main landing gear well, which caused significant damage, including the buckling of the landing gear door.
Also because the throttle up would only affect the 3 SMEs and not the SRBs, which caused the explosion.

WHO DID THIS?
https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-fox-vulpine-or-canine
> At one time there were three subfamilies in the family Canidae. These were Hesperocyoninae, which includes the earliest known canids as well as animals ancestral to the other two subfamilies; the Borophaginae, which includes the largest dogs ever to have lived, which lived much like spotted hyenas do today, as well as tiny extremely omnivorous dogs; and Caninae, which is a lineage in which distance running adaptations are most important. Dogs that were in Borophaginae and Hesperocyoninae had fewer of these adaptations, which include relatively rigid forepaws, and thus, dogs in these subfamilies could actually grab prey with their paws while hunting.

>The other two lineages are extinct. They only ever lived in North America. Whereas the dogs in the Caninae subfamily still exist and live worldwide. The only extant dogs are in Caninae, and most authorities call these dogs ‚Äúcanines.‚Äù The term ‚Äúcanid‚Äù refers to the entire family, including Borophaginae and Hesperocyoninae. So by that definition, all foxes are canines.

>‚ÄúCanine‚Äù can also refer to one of the two tribes of extant dogs. The big split in the dog family is between those in the fox lineage and those in the wolf-like canids and South American wild dog lineage. The fox lineage includes everything that is known as a fox currently, except for the endemic South American ‚Äúfalse foxes,‚Äù and the raccoon dog. It is actually a bit debatable where gray and island foxes fit, but classically, they are in this tribe. It is called ‚ÄúVulpini,‚Äù and the animals in the tribe are called ‚Äúvulpines.‚Äù The other lineage includes all the South American wild dogs and all the canids in the genera Canis, Lupullela, Lycaon, and Cuon. These are sometimes called ‚Äúcanines.‚Äù By this use of canine, foxes outside of the South American clade of canids, are not canines.

>The terminology does need a bit of work for clarity. Canine can refer to every dog that exists. Canid refers to every dog that ever existed. Canine can refer to a particular tribe in extant canids, which are all Caninae, which are all canines by another definition.

Don't try to cram too many destinations into your journey, or youll spend all your time traveling and very little time actually doing fun stuff. Book hotels early! (they fill up very quickly in sakura season) Try to plan out per day what you want to see, and buy tickets in advance if possible. If you want to go to Kyoto early April and you haven't booked by now, you're probably out of luck already.
