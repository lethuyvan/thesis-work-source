So I came in with 4 years of high school french and restarted from French 1. The class was full of ‚Äúfalse-beginners‚Äù including Canadians who had been studying it for a long time. We all still learned something from the class since it‚Äôs very thorough and detail-oriented at Columbia, and high school french glares over a lot of the grammar rules.
Languages (French in particular) are super chill classes, and a guaranteed 4-credit A that‚Äôs going to strongly help your GPA while classes in your major brutalize it. 

I‚Äôd recommend not taking the test, and just enjoying an easy time in French 1-4. You‚Äôll probably learn details of the language and culture you didn‚Äôt before. By the time you get to level 4, you‚Äôll be doing way more advanced stuff than you did in high school.

It‚Äôs only real if you choose to engage with it. If people are stressing you out, they suck, ditch them and move on. 
Definitely not. Not at all crowded between 6am-12pm, weekdays or weekends. People are also generally fine to work-in with the weights, if not then they‚Äôre the asshole so you can assert yourself.

The only issue is if you want to use the leg machines, the old people (random senior citizens that use the Columbia gym) center around those for some reason, and they love to do one set then rest on the machine for like 5 minutes so...

Try reduce motion. The apps just appear when they open, but it‚Äôs quite smooth as well. Is not jerky in any way. They fade away quickly but smoothly when closed as well.
I can't believe most people *don't* have Reduce Motion enabled. People really like things wooshing around their screen like it's a Fisher Price toy? I think it also came out a while ago that removing the animations makes apps open a nanosecond or two faster.


Yeah seriously. Better make sure you or your roommate never forget to lock the door.

Interesting, I knew the NY/NJ/CT/Long Island crowd brought that Daddy's money culture to the school, like that kid who assaulted the uber driver a couple of years ago, but I thought the in-staters would more than balance it out. 

Sorry that another great institution has fallen to this shit.
Michigan is a giant state school though. You‚Äôre telling me the whole culture is competitive and cancerous like that? What about the in-state kids? What about Greek life? 

Not being accusatory, but having been to both a similar Big 10 school, and now at a smaller ‚Äúelite‚Äù school, I‚Äôm surprised you couldn‚Äôt find your niche there.

Will definitely help with internships when you're in college. However I'd hesitate with mentioning this on college apps for top schools (Ivies, stanford etc.) Long story short, I used a pretty reputable admissions advisor to apply to some ivies plus some other schools, he warned me that these types of institutions have a bias against kids who come in just to go to IB. They'd rather at least have you pretend you want to do something more "academic", then when you come in you can pursue whatever you want. 

It's not exactly scientific, but I took his advice and pretended to be interested in political science for all the liberal-arts type schools, and didn't mention my prior business experience. For the undergrad business programs at state schools (Ross, McCombs, Kenan-Flagler, etc.) I applied specifically for business and mentioned any experience I had. It worked out well for me in the end. Take that for what you will, but I definitely got the vibe of a bias against business kids at the Ivies.

Not sure if troll post but Big Law as seen on the show is nothing like that in real life. It really died after the recession. In the show Mike Ross didn‚Äôt even go to law school and started his job as an associate with big cases. Nowadays even top law school grads will start doing doc review (more like Kim in Better Call Saul) for YEARS. Then if you don‚Äôt make partner-track you‚Äôll have to leave and go to Compliance for a bank or something. 

Not to mention this is with 7 years of schooling, and you‚Äôll start off making what an investment banker makers straight out of undergrad (although their life isn‚Äôt any better). Reconsider your life kid. Going down this road has no guarantee of you ending up a big swinging dick like Harvey. The odds are actually against it.

This. Your school's office will have something like a change of income form that lets you indicate that you don't make any money anymore (your BAH/disability don't count as income) so you should get the full Pell Grant from your school alongside the GI Bill stuff. Every vet at my school gets both.

See my comment, feel free to PM as well.
I did the exact same trip last May and absolutely loved it. I did: Paris -> French Riviera (stayed in Nice, day trips to Cannes & Monaco) -> Florence -> Rome -> Amalfi Coast (stayed in Sorrento, day trips to Pompeii, Positano, Capri). Flew from Naples -> Paris on the morning of my flight back home. Trains between all these places took a couple of hours at most, except Nice -> Florence which took the better part of a day.

I had 20 days, so it was about 4 days each place. You only have  15, so you'd have to choose between French Riviera and Amalfi Coast as they're both Mediterranean beach areas. If you like vibrant, fun, beach towns with lots to *do* and more swimming, I'd recommend the FR. If you want something more dramatically beautiful to *see*, plus the incredible history of Pompeii I'd recommend Amalfi Coast. Based on wanting to stay longer in Italy, I think you'd get more out of the Amalfi Coast.

I stayed in hostels pretty much the whole way and loved everywhere I stayed so feel free to PM me for any questions/recommendations. I am truly jealous btw, you have an amazing trip ahead of you. 
Dude, college is the absolute best time to start lifting. Assuming you have a meal plan, you‚Äôll have access to unlimited tasty protein without having to cook mountains of bland-ass chicken, and you‚Äôll have the most energy for your workouts. 

GET. A. ROUTINE. You mentioned machines, which you probably don‚Äôt need/won‚Äôt make gains on. Most early college lifters are doing ‚Äúbro-splits‚Äù and limit their progress. Go to r/fitness, pick a beginner routine (I recommend Ice cream Fitness or CoolCicada‚Äôs PPL), and stick to it for at least 6 months. You can build an amazing physique over the next 4 years that you can then just maintain when you start work and are tired all the time.

What? A mortgage that's 10x your annual income sounds pretty normal. You wouldn't blink at someone making $300k/year with a $3MM house. Assuming some small downpayment and a 30y mortgage, they could pay it off at like $1000/month.

Agree with all of those. The 3 Sheets/Off The Wagon combo on Macdougal is great. I also really like going to Continental in the East Village for super cheap shots, before walking to Bar None, fun dance floor on the weekends. 
Colombia is amazing, I will however comment on the 13 hour layover in Panama City. I was stuck in the airport for about 5 hours and wanted to gouge my eyes out. One of the worst/most overcrowded airports I‚Äôve been to in my life. Limited food options that closed at about 9pm, no chargers or plugs ANYWHERE, and totally non-functioning WiFi. The airport was also unequipped to handle the huge crowds transiting through it (not during some crisis, just a random day in January) and for several hours I couldn‚Äôt find a free seat. 

Not sure what the logistics are for getting out into the city with 13 hours, but if you can get out, do it.

Why would this be necessary when you‚Äôre already at the airport? Airports are packed full of TSA, customs, police, military, etc. Just yell ‚Äúhelp‚Äù and start running, and someone will grab you.

It‚Äôs been quantified for non-video apps certainly, as well as black background home screen, and its well above 20%. There‚Äôs a great video on YouTube.

But also, if you‚Äôre gonna do a dark mode why not do full black?
On the iPhone X it significantly saves battery.

The military truly is the great equalizer of our country: take any kid from Bumfucksville, give them some discipline, work ethic, and teach them how to interact in a professional environment, take them overseas and show them the world outside the US, then pay for whatever college they want to go to.

The town outside Humphreys is called Anjeong-ri, and all roads lead to the Humphreys gates from there.

Any rational person has made moves already as they watch their rent creep up to 90+% of their income. Moves out of the city, out of the tristate altogether. If you‚Äôre watching rent creep up 3-4% every single year, you‚Äôre watching this impending doom approach, any rational person with self-preservation instincts will take steps to avoid it. If you‚Äôre homeless, this instinct is fundamentally broken. 

I‚Äôm not saying we can‚Äôt do a lot more to make housing affordable, but in the United States poverty =\= homelessness.
You‚Äôre telling me the homeless people living out of bags and smelling like urine got there because of *rent increases*? So they were productive working citizens last year, paying their $1000/mo or whatever, then rent went up 3% and suddenly their *only* option was sleeping on the streets? No family anywhere, no desire to move out to East Orange or somewhere and commute?

That makes no sense. These are definitely mentally ill/addicted homeless that came to NYC because it has resources.

$44/mo actually. This was USAA in Texas for bare-minimum liability coverage, new driver, compact vehicle. Geico/Progressive had slightly higher quotes. Good student discount took a couple of bucks off.

Most astronomically high insurance rates come from having full coverage on a financed vehicle.
The films these stereotypes come from are set in upper-middle class suburbs, and yes, kids will very often get a gently used car when they get their license in these communities. Kids in cities with good public transit probably won't, unless they're in the outer boroughs of NYC or somewhere similar. 

Car ownership is very affordable in most of the US. A very roadworthy used car can be had for $3-4K, liability insurance can be as low as $50/month, and gas is relatively cheap these days.
I‚Äôm in the same boat as you, 93 but graduating college in 2019. It makes me uncomfortable that I can‚Äôt fully understand if these kids are the same as me or different. iPhone 3G was my first phone and my social networks were FB >> Snap/IG.

This doesn't necessarily make sense. I communicate with a ton of friends who use slang. Yet it's never suggested any of those words to me. Why isn't my autocorrect full of "outta" instead of "out of". Also if that were the case, then I.t and A ? wouldn't be bugs, they'd just be the autocorrect learning properly.
Can you elaborate? What does the autocorrect algorithm see in my applications that would make it want to correct I to A ? or it to I.t?

I was saying the excess delay in updating the resolution is not the same as this battery bug.
Not quite the same. Devs had access to an emulator for the X since the day it was announced.

It's been almost a month since launch, almost 2 and a half since announcement, and Google Maps still looks like shit. 
I always wondered, but was never ballsy enough to test myself, if you plug an iOS device into a military computer, then click ‚Äúdon‚Äôt trust‚Äù so the device doesn‚Äôt transfer data to the computer just draws power from USB, will that trigger anything?

It‚Äôs the deepest possible fresh start of your iPhone and will fix any software issues. Anything that remains is hardware. 
If you just got it yesterday, I‚Äôd go ahead and do a DFU restore. If the issues persist, it‚Äôs a defective model. 

This is of course assuming you measured the usage accurately on your 8 and the X, the X should last several hours longer under the same conditions.

It's not like iOS 11 is such a major new refresh, and it's not like the deadline for release caught them by surprise. There are always small hiccups but previous iOS releases haven't been anywhere near this bad.
Seems like this year the hardware team put out the best iPhone ever, meanwhile iOS got outsourced to a team of 4th graders learning how to code. 

We are now on our sixth bug fix release for iOS 11 in just under 2 months, and addressing issues like their flagship device not working in the cold? And I'd bet it's still completely unusable on an iPhone 6 or earlier.

The Korean War ended in 53, and Don spent at least 2 years between the car dealership and fur store, so when he negotiates his salary to 45K in 1960 he‚Äôs been at SC for 5 years maximum. Is it at all realistic for a creative at a boutique agency to make $300+ with 5 years experience today?

This is the breakdown I was looking for, even if it‚Äôs not perfect. I understand that software deliberately speeds up and slows down charging at certain points, but I just wanted a rough framework to see how fast a charger should charge a battery under ideal conditions. Thanks!
So, once again, how do you arrive at mAh/second from X wattage? Assume voltage is whatever US voltage is. 
Yes absolutely. I was able to get a free replacement at an apple store in Nice, France while on vacation, phone was from the US.
Those are defects that will get you a replacement. The only real issues with a non-defective X will be un-updated apps (aka Spotify taking their sweetass time) and the cold weather bug, due to be fixed in the next update.  
How do you convert mAh/second to watts? Always wondered.
Got the Monoprice Qi charger, $12 shipped. Works great, charges 0 to 100 in about 3 hours-ish? Not really relevant as I only charge while I sleep anyway. 
This guy watts.

I don‚Äôt know anyone that works during the year (not to say people don‚Äôt, but realistically if you‚Äôre taking on debt to come here you‚Äôre not even going to make a scratch on that by working some odd job.) You‚Äôll need an internship for
Junior summer, and you‚Äôd ideally want to do something fulfilling sophomore and freshman summer as well (this could be an internship, or travel, volunteering, study abroad etc.)

It's very possible to have fun. Come with a fake, grab a squad and go downtown every weekend. Tinder/Bumble for dating. It'll be difficult to sustain like 3.8+ GPA, recruit for internships, and maintain your health/sleep at the same time. Not impossible, just challenging. 

[This Venn diagram](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/81/95/e8/8195e8cca4c858fbcbebfad51578ec2e.jpg) sums up any competitive college pretty well. You can live in the middle zone with a lot of discipline, or just shoot for a low-to mid 3's GPA, and be fine.
But Japanese carriers are private for-profit companies the same as the US, and I believe they have approx the same number of major carriers competing. So shouldn‚Äôt American carriers have the same incentives to improve their networks?

I understand signal being shitty in rural areas, most of America is an empty wasteland, but signal in the subway of its biggest city? New York is smaller than Seoul or Tokyo, with roughly a same sized subway, it seems like a no-brainer.
Nice! If only we got that in NYC.
This annoys the hell out of me. And goddamn transit wifi requires you to go through the captive portal every. single. time. 

Why does this country always opt for half-ass solutions instead of a complete solution like in Seoul or Tokyo where you have LTE and Wifi in all tunnels and stations, and it simply autoconnects whenever you enter.
Equities is the only market that‚Äôs going to strictly follow market hours. Find your way onto an equities floor (swaps, derivatives, futures, options, etc.) and you‚Äôll at least go home around 5.

Firms have a ton of sophomore internship opportunities for "diversity" (which can be very loosely defined, have definitely seen straight white dudes in these programs). Can't really think of anything for freshmen, I think most people that had freshman experience on resumes worked at family firms of relatives.

I wouldn't stress about this as no one is expecting you to have experience as a sophomore. Spend the summer traveling or volunteering overseas and you'll have more interesting stories at interviews.

The ‚Äúbrute force‚Äù solution to this is fill up a bathtub with water, add a few scoops of Oxi-Clean, soak all your shirts in that tub for 6 hours then throw them in the wash. It‚Äôs super effective, all armpit/collar stains will be gone. Do this maybe once every other month.

Why are you assuming his recurring expenses are the same as yours? The payments on his house, the quality of food he eats, etc. have all probably scaled up with his income too. I'm not saying life is hard for someone with $10MM but I'm saying their decision making process is going to be the same as for a middle class person buying a Harley.

Thats not the point, the point is money scales. If your net worth is $300K and you buy a Harley for $30k, you just spent 10% of your worth on your Harley. Yeah you could pull something out of savings and buy a second, but you wouldn't want to spend 1/5th of your net worth on this bike.

Thanks for the input buddy. Would love to see your investment strategy based on undergrad economics. Drawing indifference curves on a chalkboard ‚Äî> pure alpha right?

Well depends what you mean by ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù. If you‚Äôre thinking banking, I‚Äôd strongly recommend Stern. Places just as well as Columbia but the classes prepare you much better when you hit the desk. At Columbia you‚Äôd be working harder on irrelevant classes to achieve the same result.

If you‚Äôre thinking of entrepreneurial pursuits, well school can‚Äôt really prepare you for that so...

Either way I wouldn‚Äôt really pass up a ‚Äúguaranteed‚Äù spot at Stern if I were you.

Caveat: If culture is a factor, Columbia has the best one of all NYC schools by a mile. Still doesn‚Äôt approach a state school, but definitely better than Stern. 
Seriously. Finance clubs draw the most tryhard types.
Dude...apply to both. You may not get into one or either. You should be asking this question in the spring once you have all your acceptances.
Sadly yes.
> was transferred in

Uhh what? You go through the admissions completely and even more rigorously as a transfer student. Ivy transfer acceptance rates are typically ~2% instead of 5-6% for freshmen. You can't "be transferred in" he applied and got in like everyone else. I hate that fat orange fuck as much anyone but Wharton is impressive no matter what.

Own parkas from both, I can tell you CG is purely a status symbol. It‚Äôs very warm, certainly warm enough to handle the coldest days New York, Toronto, Chicago or Boston could throw at it, but so can the North Face Gotham parka at less than half the cost. 


That being said, it‚Äôs urban camouflage, and you kind of need one to blend into upper middle class society in those cities. So if you‚Äôve got $800 and think that‚Äôs worth it, go for the Goose. If you don‚Äôt or can‚Äôt, just know that the North Face parka is every bit as warm.
I wonder how Don Draper would react to these shitty jokes that use his picture? ü§î
The FORSCOM dfacs I went to were all in Korea, and then several TRADOC dfacs in the states, all had pretty much the same thing going on. Grab a meat entree, supplement it with eggs and dairy, throw a few vegetables on the plate from the salad bar and maybe some rice or bread. Omelets for breakfast. Ok if you‚Äôre a competitive power lifter trying to get massive, you may need to add supplements but I never saw a single dfac that couldn‚Äôt sustain an ordinary soldier just looking to stay lean and strong.
What are you on about? Did you really join the service to eat at Whole Foods and local farm produce? The DFAC always has plenty of healthy choices, and you can load your plate with a great high protein, low carb macro ratio (as well as fruits, vegetables and dairy) if you want. It's not concerned with pseudo-scientific hipster organic bullshit, it's concerned with feeding soldiers and enabling their muscular recovery. And what Private can't spend a little of their $2000/month on $70 of protein powder?

That being said, I do agree that all soldiers should get BAS because I believe in personal choice, but most would be better off just going to the dfac for omelets and steak than going to taco bell every day like they inevitably do.  
Truth. Not familiar with McGills fine arts programs. 
Depends what you want to do. Accepted to Stern and want to do banking? Go to Stern. Sternies are all over the bulge brackets, McGill kids usually end up at tier-2 banks in the US.

If by non-traditional you mean something that has altered your timeline in any way, ie. you took time off after high school or are home schooled and graduated early, you may be a candidate for GS. Contact the Columbia General Studies admissions office and ask them your questions.

I transferred to a top university in the US, and I have very mediocre grades here.

Damn bruh I'm not saying any of that, just correcting him that ignoring mental health is an American trait, not *all* of North America (FWIW I'm American).

I think you're right, I think "mental health" is just the most recent attempt at diverting the issue by conservatives and the gun lobby. There's no evidence that providing mental health resources would make a 64 year old undiagnosed psychopath check himself in. 

Short of repealing the 2A and having law enforcement go house to house to collect all the guns over a decade (which will never happen), there is no solution to this problem. Mass shootings are just in the American psyche for some reason and I guess that's the price we pay for living here.

Yeah definitely rethink your decision making. The first one wasn‚Äôt bad luck, it was an active choice and it should have been a wake up call.  It‚Äôs even more concerning because I‚Äôm sure San Jose has Uber.

Lecturing aside, apply everywhere, this won‚Äôt hold you back at all. You won‚Äôt get asked until after the offer, and even then they won‚Äôt ask ‚Äúhow many misdemeanors‚Äù they‚Äôll just ask if you have any, and you can click Yes and just put DUI-all fines paid or something like that. Seriously no one cares.
Where are you? Cities that have ‚Äúbanned the box‚Äù, NYC, SF and others won‚Äôt even ask about your record until after they‚Äôve given you the offer. 

Even then, they‚Äôre concerned about financial or fraud-type crimes. They won‚Äôt rescind for a DUI. 

That being said, 2 of them? Really? Just stop getting them.

iPhone 7 3D touch lag still very much there üôÑ. Shaping up to easily be the sloppiest/buggiest/battery-drainingest iOS release in recent memory. And it didn't even bring 2 of the most anticipated features, P2P Apple Pay and Messages in iCloud.
Does it though? I buy my phones outright and I‚Äôm paying $90/month on T-mobile for true net-neutral unlimited service (videos not downgraded to 480p). That‚Äôs not too different from what you were paying for unlimited on AT&T back when the iPhone 3G came out for $200.

Are you insane? The 5 was a new physical size, new screen size, new materials on the entire phone, and it included LTE!

The 7 and 8 are both identical in shape and size to the 6, the 8 has a different material on just the back, and the 7 has a minimally more curvy camera bump. 

Im not complaining because they‚Äôre giving us the X for those of us tired of this design, but it is absurd to not realize that the 8 is really the 6SSS.

This a question better suited for r/Columbia or r/MilVets.

I'd apply for Columbia housing as a backup option, but it's kinda shitty and you can do better for your money between 106th and 116th streets. Go on the Columbia Housing Facebook page and take a look at what people are getting.

If you're much older/married or something and really have no interest in the undergraduate community, you could look at apartments in other parts of the city on StreetEasy, but otherwise I'd recommend staying within 8-10 blocks of 116th.

All of the Ivies have undergrad vet populations, with Columbia having the most at ~400. Dartmouth and Yale also have great pipelines for vets. Less familiar with west coast schools, but I am aware of a few at Stanford. High school grades are largely irrelevant, SAT and prior college grades matter along with telling your vet story in a compelling way.

Again, that's my point. You can make up ridiculous claims about anything. So that's why we should leave it up to parents to decide, hey that 3DS is probably safe for my kid until any evidence is released against it vs. hey, I don't really need studies to know that guns aren't safe for my kid. 
That's literally my point. 
There are "possible unknown side-effects" to everything. That new 3DS you just bought your kid could "possibly" be leaking uranium. Leave it to the parent's judgement to decide which things are reasonably safe until proven otherwise.


0.4 is an exaggeration. You need to have the model you want in mind, and open and refresh the Apple Store App (faster than the website).

My main dilemma is knowing which carrier version is the best (Qualcomm vs Intel modems, etc.) but that info is often not released until after iFixit gets their hands on it.

The military massively compensates enlisted servicemembers through the Post-9/11. You can do one contract, have a very expensive private school paid for, and get paid BAH on top of that. If the SM decides not to go to school, or stretch their E-4 paycheck thin by knocking up some local dependa, that's their fault. 

If I add up my pay, the tuition from my GI Bill, and my BAH, and divide all that over my 3 years of service, I made over $100,000/year as an E-4.
Is that his fault? I'm certainly in a position of privilege (not on Draper's level, but all my theoretical "needs" are met) and I find myself wanting something I can't put my finger. Some of us just aren't blessed with the satisfaction gene. Does it make him a bad person?

Can't really help you compare the academics, but make sure you visit both campuses and spend a good amount of time just exploring each. Yale has the more beautiful campus but Columbia (obviously) has the better location. Think about the activities you love to do and which school will offer you more opportunities to do them. 

And congrats! You really can't go wrong with either. 

Edit: r/Yale a bunch of savages
Second this. NYC will never get cold enough that Bean Boots + Wool socks aren't sufficient. 
I got mine on the TOR network back in the day but I've seen friends use IDGod's Connecticut one to great effect. 
Necessity for having fun in NYC (even if you don't feel like drinking, you will need an ID to get into ANYthing). A good ID passes any bar inspection (scan, blacklight etc). Just don't hand it to a cop if you get pulled over driving in your home state.

The first time I ever shot a pistol (mind you I had shot ARs before) I got 5/5 on a 25m target (9mm). It's really not that hard if you take a second to recenter and breathe.
Princeton is about an hour on the train from Manhattan, do keep that in mind if you're seeking finance opportunities. Not that Harvard kids struggle, but 1 hour vs 3 hours for networking meets, coffee chats, interviews etc. may be a factor.

Destin was literally all that kept me sane during my time at Rucker.
Columbia is a little different because there is a campus, a frat row, and something resembling a community. Still, people are always busy, or pretending to be busy, and traditional college experiences like pick-up games of ultimate on the quad are going to be hard to come by.

I'd say college in NYC is not for everyone. Be sure you REALLY love the school and the city before you commit. The fact is, the city will always be here when you graduate, but you only get to have a college experience once. For most people, I'd probably recommend the traditional college experience at a big suburban school, then coming to the city later for work.

It wasn't a substitute, like I would drink 2000 calories of soylent then go get McNuggets just for the taste. So I was cheating on my diet.
It tastes fine, you feel fine on it, saves a ton of time, and anyone who's switched to it for long periods of time has been perfectly healthy (and shitting better than ever because of the high fiber). That being said, it takes a lot of discipline to eat the same thing every day. I found myself cheating on soylent with just food just to get some variety.
Not me personally, but at my school the move is to come in as an Econ major because they think it's required to get to Wall Street, realize that banks don't give a shit what your major is, then switch to Poli Sci because math is hard.

You will get into most state schools no problem.

PM me if you want more info on this. 

TL;DR: Yes depending on what moves you make while in the Navy, you can go to any school in the country regardless of what your HS grades were.

Acting like a know-it-all ends that way in every subject.

The Southern and Midwestern guys immediately started with "this is nothing, I shoot all the time back home with my AR15 with such-and-such mods." Of course, these are the guys who barely qualified with their rifles while the noobs like me who just shut the fuck up and listened to the drill sergeants lessons on marksmanship ended up getting Sharpshooter/Expert.

What?? How could it be anything but racism? They don't have "southern pride" in fucking New Hampshire. Some of their ancestors probably fought for the Union.

Come on dude, you know that guy is the exception. Every unit has that one weird E4 who still enlisted with a degree, doesn't make them the norm at all.

I'll tell you my story so far, maybe it'll give you some context. 

Did my freshman year at a big state school, failed everything, finished the year with a 0.8 GPA. Joined the Army, and in the meantime took all my freshman and sophomore level classes at a local 4-year state school, maintained a 3.9 GPA this time. Just did my transfer applications and I had to send in all my past transcripts. So far: accepted to one really good state school and one really good private school, got an interview at an Ivy League and still waiting to hear back from 2 more Ivies. 

TL;DR: Write dank essays about your personal growth, get really good grades at a different school and have an interesting extracurricular (the Army in my case) and your bad past grades shouldn't affect you at all.

Dim might be the wrong word. I always keep brightness on auto. The colors are just warmer, which looks worse. And there's a big gap between the screen and the glass. Hold a 6/6s and SE side by side and you'll see the difference.
I used the SE for about a week before returning it and going back to my 6S. I wanted to like it, I really did. But the last-gen screen looks so bad and dim compared to the 6/6S. More than the selfie camera, it was the antiquated screen I really couldn't take. 

Why Apple? Why the compromise? I would've gladly paid $600 for a 4" phone with *all* the current-gen specs.

True, but it's sometimes unavoidable for less-than-legitimate ones (fake IDs, etc.)
> doing what?

How would I answer that? You need to have at least a rough idea of what you want to do for a living before you go to college, no matter where you decide to go. You mentioned banking as one of your options, Berkeley is the only school on that list that has a shot at that field. Silicon Valley (even without a CS degree?) Berkeley. I don't know what you think people do to make money, but it's going to be hard, soul-sucking work no matter what field you choose.

Also quality of life in the Bay Area (literally one of the most up-and-coming locations on the planet now) vs the Bible Belt (literally the quality of life of some 3rd world countries). Is this even a question? You only have one life to live. Spend it in good places surrounded by smart people.
Dude go to Berkeley. It's the best school on that list with the absolute best odds of landing you a six-figure position by your mid-20s. Yes the debt is an issue, but you only live once and you generally only go to college once. Do you think your life and your future are worth more than $100,000? If so, bet on yourself.

Also, if you got into Berkeley why the hell are you even considering Alabama? It's not even academically the best school in its state, which is *Alabama*. Go to Berkeley.
Lol Pyongyang is just within 100mi of the DMZ or Dongduchon which is why you got US Army guys.

You'd be surprised. Everyone that enlisted around the same time as me, missing the bulk of the War on Terror, is rip roaring to go to Syria. Then again, the old guys want to go back on deployment so they can get combat pay too. Maybe the Army isn't the best sample for this lol.
If the father was too young for Vietnam, then his generation didn't see any major or prolonged wars, just skirmishes that were largely easy victories for the US.
Dude you don't have to get your degree from a 2nd-tier state school.

Apply to your flagship state university, as well as some of the lesser schools in your state. Assuming you get accepted to a lesser school: crush it your freshman year. *Get straight-fucking-As.* Get involved and take leadership in multiple extracurricular organizations. After your freshman year, apply to transfer one level up, in this case to your flagship state school. Rinse and repeat for your sophomore year. You are now eligible to transfer as a junior to a higher level public school (Michigan, Berkeley, etc.) or even an elite private school. They won't give 2 shits about what you did in high school.
Princeton would be the dream since Jersey is home for me, but it's a long shot and I'm not willing to just throw away all 60 credits I've earned so far. I'm applying to every Ivy except Princeton, with Columbia and Dartmouth being my best bets.

Lol I'm quite familiar with Bama. It's a fine school for the Southeast. However if this guy has his sights set on Wharton, it's clear his end goal is to do something in finance or management consulting in the Northeast, where SEC schools have ZERO connections. I just don't understand why you'd send him to the South when he'd be better off choosing Penn State/Rutgers/SUNY Binghamton as safeties. Those schools get lucky and send a couple of kids to Goldman every year just due to proximity/connections.
Dude you're sending a kid with a 3.86 GPA and Ivy League ambitions to Alabama? Are you serious?

UT Austin McCombs, Michigan Ross and NYU Stern are all very realistic options for you. All 3 are also recruited for the same top-tier investment banking positions as Wharton (assuming that's what you want), albeit perhaps less so. 

Wharton's a long shot but definitely still apply to that, along with every other Ivy and really focus on standing out in your essays.

You're too old for it because you say you are. Fuck some of the grad students. Do you know how depressing being 30 is on the outside? Do you think every 30 year old at a shitty job in a shitty apartment wouldn't trade for your position in a heartbeat? Getting paid to be surrounded by bars, girls, drugs, like-minded friends and fun. Seriously, have fun. 
Jesus Christ man. Do you use your GI Bill to commute to a local community college then drive right back home? Go to a big, fun school. Go to parties. Do drugs. Join a frat. Fuck some little 18yo sorority cuties. Enjoy the fact that college is over 60% women and not a depressing fucking sausagefest like the military. Seriously, it's college, it's the best time of your life, everybody has fun. Don't fucking waste it missing the assfucking that is the military.

Source: Did both, know which one was better by a longshot.
Side question: on this sub, people talk about switching to enlisted as the only way to go to SFAS. Is there no way for an officer to go Special Forces? Where do SF officers come from then? 
An alternative route? The military. Do a 4-year stint as an officer in any branch, and you are almost guaranteed acceptance to at least one Ivy grad program. It's literally better on an application than being black or Hispanic. They'll also either pay off your undergrad loans or give you the GI Bill for 4 years worth of grad school.


If you go see a recruiter, make sure you insist on an OCS contract. Do NOT go in as enlisted, you'll have a lower quality of life and it will help much less with grad school apps.

Dude. Single male at Fort Rucker here. You think you have it bad? Destin is a GETAWAY for us. But yes you're right, for every year you spend in the military in an amazing place in Europe or Asia, you'll spend at least 3 in some shithole stateside that's skewed demographically towards "sausagefest". 

I don't find Destin to be that bad but your next PCS could be a lot worse. I'm guessing you're AF, what if you end up in Minot? Get out when your contract is up. Ride that GI Bill all the way to pound town at a big state school that's skewed way more towards single young women.
I can't cook though. Right now I get my first 1000 calories of the day from the dining hall when its convenient, then the last 1000 from Soylent. When my circumstances change and I can get all 2000 from the dining hall again, I'll go back to that.
Dude what the fuck. You just described me perfectly, and I just ordered my first box of Soylent.

I don't mean to beat a dead horse, but Apple's QC is falling by the wayside. Bendghazi was a real thing, my 6 definitely got a curve to it over a year.

Going to finish my bachelors in Finance. I'm looking for summer internships in corporate finance though and several say "Lean Six Sigma experience preferred." I find this strange because I can't think of any undergrad that even knows what LSS is, but hey, anything to stand out.
I finally got over my fear of .com sites and got on Skillport. Looks like I can take all the classes required for Green Belt or Blackbelt, but I'll still have to pay to take the test?

You're not the first one to do this. Get straight As at CC. They don't OFTEN have many clubs or orgs like UNIVERSITIES so get deeply involved with organizations in your community. Apply to every single Ivy (except Princeton since they don't allow transfers). Apply both after your freshman year and after your sophomore year, and you'll have a decent shot. 

TL;DR: get straight fucking As.

Thanks m8. In all honesty, if I can make it my entire contract without having to spend money on building my ASU, I'll be happy. As for WLC, I've spent enough time in the field for one enlistment and I just don't feel like rolling around in the mud anymore.
Exactly what I was looking for, thank you! Looks like I'll have to suck it up and build my damn ASU's if he really wants me to do a board, but after this leave I've got coming up I should be ineligible for WLC.

I'm pretty neutral about my 3-year POG contract in the Army. Seoul was amazing, Alabama is a mind-numbingly boring cesspool of the worst America has to offer, so they cancel each other out. I'm almost done, though.


I joined to get the Army on my resume as an "extra-curricular" to get into colleges I couldn't get into out of high school, but that hopefully like veterans. I'm about to start sending out applications, if I get into even one of those schools then it's #NoRagrets, if not then I've wasted 3 years of my life I could have been smoking weed and fucking college girls. Fingers crossed.
The 6 is weird. It has the same skewed ratio of way more straight girls than straight guys as NYC. So us dudes should have it as easy as we do in NYC right? For some reason it doesn't work out that way and you won't get the same worship just for being a dude who doesn't pluck his eyebrows.


That being said: masculinity is in VERY short supply in Toronto. Nothing but effeminate Persian dudes as far as the eyes can see. If you can be a "bro" so to speak girls will definitely notice. I'm a pretty fratty dude in general and that's a lot less common in T.dot than NYC. To be fair, I spent my teenage years there so I already have a lot of social value with girls I knew from middle/high school when I go back up. 


Still, it's a beautiful, safe and diverse city and you'll have a lot of fun. #FordNation

Wow, Reddit's cognitive dissonance is really something. I love meat. I don't pretend to care about animals however (unless they're killed in a cruel way or made to suffer) because I'm going to eat hundreds of them over the course of my life. Once lab-grown meat comes out I'll eat it guilt-free, but until then don't act like this lion's life was worth more than every single cow or pig we've both eaten over the years.
[Here's some insight on the matter.](http://youtu.be/eKFjWR7X5dU)
Reddit really has no tolerance for dark humor.
Or not get it up at all, as in my case.
Humphreys does have the biggest one in the military but it's always somewhat crowded. I use the private one in our office we built, since my office is full of retired civilians I'm about the only one that uses it.
Why did you have this problem in Toronto? I have a 201 (New Jersey) number, I'm sure if I came up to the 6 people would understand that I *just didn't buy my phone there*. Why didn't they assume the same for you? The Montreal example I understand.
As a middle-class Indian who moved to the states at a very early age, this is absolutely true. We're expected to just lay around in front of the air conditioner all day while the maids handle the housework. If I hadn't moved away so young I'd have been completely useless by the time college came around.
Google "A+ Schools for B Students" it's a list curated by Bloomberg I think that's right up your alley. From one of those schools you could get a fresh start and try to transfer if you want.

In general though, big, flagship state schools value the SAT more than others (Penn State, Rutgers etc.) Smaller schools, elite schools and most private schools don't seem to value it at all. (Source: 3.5 GPA, 2200 SAT)
Because you know my schedule, and the amount of time I have to make it between work and class. You don't get to decide how fast other people need to go, is the idea. If it's a single lane road and I'm behind you, I'm going to pass. If it's a two-lane road and you don't move to the right when you see that you're not the fastest person in the left lane, then I'm going to weave around you.

OP is a cadet or something and doesn't know how laid back his real military experience is going to be.

If you're deployed to a warzone or in field training (which only happens occasionally) you might get put on a guard duty overnight or something. Your leaders wouldn't needlessly keep you awake. But again, I have a cushy desk job so that shit almost never comes my way.

I'm not Ronnie Coleman, but little 100-pound girls doing jumping jacks in the weight room with 2.5s gets annoying when I'm trying to find space to deadlift. Doesn't mean I'm going to ask for men-only gym hours.
Flight from Atlanta to San Antonio looks like this every time.
I could have gotten the 2400 but then I thought about my [favorite song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_kF4zLNKio) and just had to get 1738 on purpose.

Fort Rucker here, knocking out my gen-eds at a decent 4-year nearby, hopefully going to be able to transfer up to a target school when I ETS to finish my bachelors. Just wanted to say good luck brother.

Don Draper and Ari Gold are probably your best bets. Also two of the best shows ever (Mad Men and Entourage.) Mad Men is pretty serious and Entourage is very lighthearted, so average them out and you get Suits. 
After what she did to Vince on Entourage?
If it means a lot to a future employer or grad school looking at my resume, we're golden.
Something's not adding up there. What went wrong? Even in the pits of the crisis a STEM grad from a top school wouldn't fall that hard.
There are variables, but in the Northeast you don't see too many Ivy League econ/finance/STEM grads having to settle for Starbucks.
That's a valid route, but costs you in time and lost income. I'm learning the hard way wasting time in the Army instead of having done the "do well in high school > go to a top college > get a top job" route.
Seriously, go to Buttfuck State and apply to Goldman Sachs and see how far you get. The name on your degree matters.
Duuuuuude that's nothing compared to the boots who wear Grunt Style.

Edit: Or their basic training platoon shirt.
The 6 after Drake dropped his mixtape.
Dank.
Flockavelli has better trigger discipline in his videos than that agent.

Try not to cut yourself on that edge.
Osama, Jihadi John, the 9/11 hijackers, all the Western Muslims that have joined ISIS, they were all educated and from middle or upper class backgrounds. I hate to say it, but religion is so illogical it even defies economics. I don't know what the solution to Islamic terrorism is, but education and opportunity are not it.

Well he really was a good guy, but the look wasn't for a project. He admitted to dressing like a douche when he was 16 in an interview.
She wanted you to come out in uniform? Bright future for this young dependa.
how many GBP can it hold?
This contains all that info? And I'm guessing after installing OSX I should replace the new iTunes folder with this one?

Does attempting to shit on other people's (legal) happiness make you feel good about yourself?
>Implying manhattan isn't all of NYC if you're not poor/a hipster
Off day bruh.
So you went there, to Manhattan specifically, as a tourist in 2005 and you were raped, murdered AND assaulted all in one trip? Even post-9/11 with cops and National Guard on every corner? I'm so sorry to hear that friend please do both of us a favor and never come back.

Looks like India from the man's dress and the spotted deer.
I know usually /r/cringepics is guys spamming girls, but this one's the other way around.
As someone with a (newish) small, compact car, it's not comfortable driving at 95 or 100mph. The whole steering wheel shakes and you have no grip on the road. Is everyone in Argentina driving powerful cars? I thought it was a poorer country...
>relatable underdog

Somehow I don't think ISIS or Al Qaeda are relatable to Europeans.
Having lived in Korea, trust me it's just as common as us smiling in pictures. Every girl, every picture, every time.
People don't get this. At 22, I'd be very happy to date a 16-18 year old (16 being legal in my state) simply because they make me feel good about myself.

My peers right now are graduating from top colleges and driving their Beemers either to work or to Ivy league grad programs. I, on the other hand, am kind of a bum right now. Killing time in the military and still taking sophomore-level classes. I'm not going to impress any 22-year old. But to an HS senior or college freshman? Having any car is cool. Having any job is cool. It may sound petty but they stroke my ego and I like that. 
It does. It's often listed as one of the best cities in the world for a single male. Even the poor art majors living 5 to a studio apt. in Queens are getting some.
America has Republicans, Europe literally has Neo-Nazi parties (that get significant votes in some countries.)
>Live in Manhattan

>Grab delicious chicken over rice from favorite halal cart

>Go to work with well-adjusted, talented Indians and Chinese working on H1 visa program

>Go to bars full of women of every race, color and creed, mostly DTF since NYC has a shortage of single straight men

>knowledgeable Middle-Eastern taxi driver takes me home

>Think of dysfunctional Europoor Neo-Nazis before going to bed

>Sleep like a baby 
Dude all your Meek Mill and Rozay edits...there aren't enough fire emojis in the world. Keep it up man.
If you've ever done a crunch in your life you probably don't have much in common with Gucci haha.

What happened to your lightning scar?
Ouch.
She's somewhere in the GTA, yeah. Lot of people have run into her.
Developing.
You on Rucker too? E or O brah?
Stationed at Rucker, what do you guys do for fun? Besides District and Teasers (which I hate.)
When and where was this? My year-long tour with 2ID was classified as a "hardship tour" but we had standard M-F 9-5 workweeks, plenty of 4-days and got barracks in the field. Granted it was 2CAB but it wasn't too different for the guys up at Casey.

Two nice places in a city that's otherwise dangerous/a shithole. It's not exactly Manhattan.
