Hockey but every team needs to have one player on the ice at all times who is the thing that the team is named for. Not a mascot or a guy in a costume but the real thing. The penguins would need an actual penguin. The leafs would need to have a leaf on the ice and that would count as a player. New Jersey could be interesting if they actually managed capture a live Jersey devil. The Carolina hurricanes would be something to see. Montreal and Vancouver wouldnt really change and the Islanders would just need a guy from Long Island.

What a time to be alive. The new Z06, the GT and the Demon are the big 3s final gifts to us before we decend into a fully automated electric world. It really is bitter sweet. Maybe we might see a mid-engine Corvette, a new viper and a 2 door Bronco Raptor but all these things will likely remain dreams that we live out in VR simulations while our limp useless bodies get carried around in autopiloted robo-pods zipping across a bleak land that no longer knows the thick chop of a v8 or the smell of burning tires. 
There are still plenty of crown vics out there racking up hundreds of thousands of miles. I salute them for serving longer than any other cop car was ever designed to.
That's because one of the reasons cops loved the Crown Vic is that it has a super spacious interior. The Taurus on the other hand is oddly shaped and cramped on the inside. 

The Explorer, like the crown vic, has plenty of room for activities.
It's nothing but a nameplate at this point anyway. The current full size sedan Taurus doesn't really have much in common with the mid size Taurus's of the past.  

Ford just slapped the Taurus name onto the 500 because it's well known.

I'm from Ottawa and I can confirm that Chinese tourists are the worst.

When I was a kid my parents took me to a cave in Virginia somewhere. The tour guide explained how stalactites and stalagmites form by dripping from the ceiling of the cave and depositing minerals. They said that it can take them a hundred years to form just an inch. When I felt a drop of water land on my head I thought that this meant that I was going to have a stalagmite sticking out of my head when I'm old.

Idk if it's illegal at all but where I live we have the luxury of being able to turn right at red lights so if I'm at the front of the line at a red light and I want to go straight and there's not much traffic, I'll turn right, then immediately turn around and turn right again to skip the light. 

This works really well at one intersection that I go straight through all the time where the road to the right of me is basically abandoned so theres never any traffic going that way and I can turn right and do a U-turn without having to worry. 
Everything on this thread is stereotypical of either "ghetto" black people or "trailer trash" white people. So yeah basically just poor people in general.

I still enjoy driving. Maybe it's because I live in a rural area where I can pretty much drive as fast as I want and I've never got a speeding ticket. Going into the city and getting stuck in traffic is infuriating so I guess if you do that every day your opinion on driving might be different.
That makes sense. My Taurus turns 13 this year and it seems like a losing battle trying to keep it going. Replaced the trans last year and it feels like the car just wants the sweet release of death but I'm keeping it alive out of spite.

It was founded before the Aztecs.
The Aztecs were a young upstart empire with a fairly promising future but there's a good chance that they wouldn't have lasted long anyway if the Spanish never came. It turns out that enslaving and killing massive numbers of people is not a good way to make friends and all their neighbors hated them. Imagine if aliens came down and assblasted the Nazis right when WWII was about to start. That's what it was like in Mexico at the time.

Threads. Nuclear war isn't fun.  
When I was 4 I was at a family party and my cousin was on one of those swing teeter-totter things that were popular in the 90s. I saw a really cool looking leaf on the ground in front of him and, without thinking went over to pick it up. I got fucking decked in the face by the swing and one of the metal poles in it busted my lip open. I went to the ER, got my lip glued up. On the way home I picked the glue off my lip and it started bleeding again so my dad had to take me back to the ER to have my lip glued a second time.

After all of this I was disappointed that my dad was taking me home instead of back to the party.

Seriously though. They searched the whole area. They found a small portion of the money he took, they found a piece of parachute that was probably his and they found a label from the plane that probably ripped off the door when he opened it to jump. If he died there and his body and the rest of the money was out there, they probably would have found it.  

Some theories say that he was Canadian and returned to British Columbia where it wouldve been easier to launder American money out of sight of American authorities.   

Some speculate that he was a trained paratrooper which would explain why he would be willing to make a jump in foul weather over wilderness and why he seemed to know so much about the DC-10 aircraft.  
Where tube
The official story is that he died when a suitcase fell out of the overhead compartment in an airplane and hit him in the head but there's a less than wholesome conspiracy theory that he actually died of a cocaine related heart attack on the plane similar to Carrie Fisher and that his family made up the suitcase story.

Most cities in began with some sort of plan and people figured out a long time ago that rectangular grids are the most efficient system for building cities. Europe is a great example of how cities change over time. Most European cities look very messy and disorganized with streets winding around with no clear plan but many of them began as grid rectangular plans like the city we see here. Over time through the middle ages and Renaissance they evolved to become what they are now. Most American cities are relatively new and you can still clearly see the grid plan. 

So yeah that was my rant about grid plans...

Hello

Retarded (Retardé) means slow or delayed in French. 
What are you talking about Europe is great. 
America might have a lot of political issues but the vast majority of Americans are very wealthy by global standards. Remember that there are places in the world where people are so hungry they eat dirt and there are a lot of countries where you can be jailed, killed or otherwise punished for speaking out against the government. 
This is it right here. If he went to jail or resigned or was otherwise forced out of his position, his family wouldn't have received a pension for his time in office and they were already in a bad situation financially from all the legal costs. Since he died while still in office though his family got his pension.  
He spent like an hour reading what was essentially a suicide letter to the press conference before brandishing a revolver. He told reporters that he didn't want to harm anyone so they should leave the room if they have a weak stomach. Most panicked and left because they didn't know what he was going to do, a few stayed, some tried to convince him to drop the gun. He warned them to stay back, backed up against the wall then put the gun in his mouth and shot himself wtih the cameras still rolling. 

He clearly spent a lot of time orchestrating his public suicide.

It gets crazier because it wasn't actually on live TV. Several local stations chose to air the footage hours after the event. Some cut it just before he pulled the trigger but others aired the full footage with all the gore. 
Compared to most of the world America is pretty great.

Shipping heavily relies on being cheap. Most cargo ships are basically just giant hunks of rusty steel fueled by industrial byproducts. Compared to airplanes, trucks and trains, cargo ships are the cheapest method of freight transportation to build and maintain. Nuclear power however is very expensive to build, maintain and dispose of. When a cargo ship reaches the end of its life it usually gets sent to a ship yard in a developing country to get broken up for scrap. Now imagine how much more costly they would be to dispose of if they were tainted with radioactive materials. Also imagine what might happen if a nuclear fueled ship sank, caught fire or even worse got highjacked. The costs involved with operating nuclear powered ships would be insane. They would need to be crewed by well trained engineers, they would need regular maintenance work and repairs to prevent accidents, they would need armed guards to defend against highjackers.

Nuclear is great for powerplants on shore and military vessels but for civilian cargo vessels it just wouldn't be feasible.

But is Logan Paul still going to be selling merch 70+ years after his death? 
Nah that's Adolf.
Well that's just cause Hitler is a ghost.
He went to the suicide forest in Japan where people go to hang themselves and was surprised when he found a dead body hanging from a tree. Then he stood next to the body a took some nice HD shots of it only bluring out the face.

He took down the video and all the reuploads of it get taken down for violating the YouTube terms of service for containing overly graphic content.
Did he though or did he get a ghost writer?
Even tho he's got blond hair and blue eyes, Logan is an honorary non-aryan.
Weren't you Logan Paul?
They're the same thing
Hitler declared the Japanese honorary Aryans so they might have still been inferior but atleast they're number 2.
I wanna see Hitler get revived and start a gaming channel called Fun With Fürer and make him play the new Wolfenstein
Oh shit yeah Jake is the one on the right
Theyre the same thing
Atleast Hitler had respect for the Japanese.
Haha yes
Always nut
Yo fuck the guy who killed the guy who killed Hitler. What an asshole.
General Butt Naked was a cannibal until he saw Jesus and Jesus was all like "eating people isn't cool my dude" and now he's a good Christian preaching the word of Jesus.
But people like having something to be outraged about. People like having reverse idols. People that they can look down on instead of look up to.

Yeah technically the guy was a suspect but youre not supposed to just go around shooting people who are suspected of stuff.
Wait so they responded to an alleged hostage situation and then handcuffed the alleged hostages? Why.
"Don't move!"

"Now crawl towords me!"

"I SAID DONT MOVE"

BANG BANG BANG
Imagine if this actually was a hostage situation. Imagine you are one of the hostages, you somehow manage to overpower and incapacitate your captor. The police get to the door, your nightmare is finally over. You open the door to let them in and they kill you dead in the face. 
Yeah I've seen some bad shit on the internet but honestly that video is the most disturbing thing I've ever seen on the internet. It's different from all the other police shooting videos where they just kill on sight because it's so long and the cop yelling orders at them sounds like some kind of sociopath toying with his victim.
This is a 2/10 normified Facebook-tier meme format.
I don't know how this got upvoted. I suspect that theres some insider manipulation of the market going on here. This is an older normie format from Facebook so it seems at least a little suspicious that it's rising as quickly as it is. I suspect that this meme will crash hard and the mouth-breathing plebians like you will be sitting on your asses wondering what the hell happened while a handful of people who sold at exactly the right time will be laughing all the way to the upvote bank. 

Unless you have some profound knowledge that the rest of us are not privy to, I would suggest staying the fuck away from this volatile meme format.  
NO.
Because this sub is all normies now after all those articles and shite were made about this subreddit.

I still have a $100 bill my parents gave me for Christmas one year. I kept it in my wallet all through highschool just to wave it in peoples faces and act like I'm rich. I also used it as a spoon once to eat ice cream.

I just realized what an insufferable cunt I am.
Yeah but none of those were nice.

It can be both.
Actually it was the British Empire. Slavery was outlawed in the Empire in the 1830s and for several decades after that the British worked to end slavery in other places as well. 
Because Arab slavers castrated their slaves so they couldnt reproduce.
Well yeah.

Yeah. The theory is that Roosevelt had intelligence that the attack was going to happen or at least that Pearl Harbour was the most likely place the Japanese would attack and just let it happen. They wanted to go to war with Japan but the general public at the time was overwhelmingly opposed to war so they baited the Japanese into throwing the first punch. Also a lot of the ships in Pearl Harbour at the time were older ships built during the First World War that were probably going to be replaced soon.

I could be wrong but I think I heard somewhere that koalas have the lowest intelligence to brain size ratio of all mammals or something like that. 

Also their brain is the size of a walnut, it is smooth so it has less surface area for thinking things and it is partially hollow. Basically these guys have shitty brains and they're real dumb.

It doesn't actually get added to your garage. It's just free for you to order on the website. So you can clear space in your garage and then order it.
They haven't updated the ps3 or 360 in 2 years but people still ask this question every time anything new is added.
My dude it's not R*s fault that you're stuck in the past.
Nothing like a nice sled on a white Christmas.
Why though
My grandfather was a pilot for the Royal Canadian Air Force back in the 1960s 

While flying in a V formation with group of I think 4 other men on a routine mission over Manitoba. He said that he saw, what he described as a bright orb of light, a bit smaller than one of their fighter jets come down out of the sky behind them and position itself at the center of their formation. It flew with them for around 5 minutes before separating from them and then disappearing into space at an unbelievable speed. Everyone in the group confirmed what they saw but agreed to stay silent out of fear for fear of being called crazy, having to fill out mountains of paper work or other repercussions.

I've done some research and found a lot of other similar stories from other pilots both military and commercial, mostly in North America and Europe. A lot of these pilots did what my grandfather did and chose to stay silent, afraid of being fired from their airforce/airline.
Most of what we know about hypothermia and it's effects on the human body cone from Nazi research. Inducing hypothermia in a person and then documenting what happens to them until they die is kind of frowned upon but when you label large groups of people as subhuman and take away all their rights, that opens a lot of doors.
