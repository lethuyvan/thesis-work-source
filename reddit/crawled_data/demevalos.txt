Think about being told something from the day your were born. "You can never go in the ocean, it's too dangerous." Sure, you might get curious, but why would you question it if nobody else in your life has done it and you're specifically told not to?
One small thing I noticed from that article that seems pretty weird is using a statistic from Match.com (referring to Millenials)

>and many are lonely (57 percent reported such in a recent Match.com survey). 

Seems pretty biased to be asking people on Match.com if they feel lonely, no?

i know im late to this post but i can chime in, I own the 770s, 880s, and ive tried the 990s, and I recently got the HD6xx. They are definitely better in the midrange than all beyers ive tried without a doubt. Sometimes I find myself wanting more bass in the HD6xxs though, which the beyers all win at. Comfort for me is HD6xx all the way, can wear for a whole day without hurting. YMMV.

>FCC chairman Ajit Pai once selected former Quintillion CEO Elizabeth Pierce to serve as one of the members of the Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee (BDAC), and now a year later she is being charged for allegedly forging contracts to swindle investors out of more than $250 million dollars.

>According to US Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman, Pierce convinced two investment companies that Quintillion had secured signed contracts from other investors for a high-speed fiber-optic network that would generate hundreds of millions of dollars in guaranteed future revenue.

>"As it turned out, those sales agreements were worthless because the customers had not signed them. Instead, as alleged, Pierce had forged counterparty signatures on contract after contract.  As a result of Pierce’s deception, the investment companies were left with a system that is worth far less than Pierce had led them to believe," Berman said in a statement.

Just more proof that the FCC is filled with lowlives

I have the 770s and had the 880s, which are similar in comfort to the 990s, and the 880 600 ohm is more comfortable than the 250 version, but both are more comfortable than the 770. The pads are significantly stiffer on the 770s, and the whole headset just feels heavier

I didn't even open the stock cable, no need the upgrade looks much better :)
I bought these to use as commuters along with my DT770s, and I've been enjoying them so far. I got the upgrade cable along with them because I read that the stock cable wasn't the greatest. The sound is way better than I was expecting. They do sound a little 'closed', like the high end needs some breathing room, but other than that no complaints sound wise. However, I've been struggling to keep them in the same place, they keep wanting to fall out. I bought some comply isolation tips for them as well, so hopefully those will solve that issue. 8/10 overall, would recommend for anybody looking to get into IEMs for $20

Hey all! I have a quick question that I've been wondering about: My Fiio e10k that I've been using as a DAC will occasionally push out this garbled audio, requiring it to be unplugged and replugged back in to fix it. It gets pretty annoying when it happens about once a day. I'm wondering if it could be a driver issue? Or possibly the 10 foot long micro usb I have running to it? I'll be trying a new cable when I get home but I'm pretty sure this also happened when I used the stock cable from the Fiio

as in the 'line out' connection on the back of the unit that is, that will bypass the amp and just use it as a DAC
you just use the line out of the e10k, so you use a 3.5 to rca cable and it works just great
\+1, these are the best for isolation and comfort in the price range
Sorry your post got removed, but yeah they're still the go to. They're really easy to drive, super comfy, and sound great for games. I would actually recommend the ATH AD500X first and save yourself some money\- If you're only playing games the 700X won't sound any better and they're exactly the same build. 
me tooth hanks
This game has been going downhill since \(insert year you started playing\)
I can't believe they've done this
Magni 2, and I don't have any comparisons to go off of other than my fiio e10k which i'm just using as a DAC, and I imagine it won't sound very good as an amp
I sold my DT880 250ohms, so I can't do a side-by-side comparison, but from memory the DT880 is better in the mids, with clarity at least. When listening to music on the 6xx, the guitar and vocals sometimes get lost together, where the 880s had the best separation i've ever experienced. In gaming, the 6XX wins for me. The 880s highs were almost too loud and sharp to seem natural, like in pubg and rocket league its like someone just raised the treble knob. 6XX is essentially just smooth and even. The 6XX has better bass also. The only reason I sold my 880s was because the clamp really hurt my ears after about an hour of use, and I didn't want to stretch them cause I wasn't sure if I was going to sell them. 
It was so worth the wait. I kind of forgot that I had even ordered them until a few days ago when they said they were shipping almost a month earlier than expected, so that was fun
The highs are pretty neutral, definitely not sharp at all :)
I understand completely lol
Just got these in the mail today after ordering on November 22nd, I'm in love already. They're way more comfortable than I was imagining, and the sound is very different than what I had expected. It's extremely clean and crisp, but much darker sounding in the mids than my AD500X or DT880s, which is something I'm sure I'll get used to over time. Love them so far!
close enough
I know I'm late to this, and it's probably been mentioned, but I used to work at Babies R Us, and in no way shape or form would someone still work there who tackled a customer. Even if we saw somebody blatantly stealing, we were not even allowed to touch them, all we could do was tell them to stop and call police. This is just the most bullshit story ever lol
People argue with this but the Magni 2 or 3 is going to be your best bang for your buck in this category. I got a used Magni 2 from ebay for $75 shipped and it's great for the higher ohm stuff
and the Wg between 9 and X
It will be loud enough. It's just not going to give the quality that you'll get with a better amplifier. If you're 100&#37; happy already, there's no reason to upgrade. However, from everything I've seen, HD6XX's will resell at minimally $200, so if you did decide to try them and they didn't show enough of an improvement, you can always resell them no problem
It could if the cable isn't made properly, what gaming headset was it? and did the gaming headset have a built in mic? Because that affects how it's wired, and it would probably be 4 pole rather than 3

I bought it second hand so I don't think it'd be covered anymore :/ thanks for helping me out though you taught me some useful tricks
So the left side is the one the wire runs into, which is also the side that is out. The blue wire is the positive for the left driver, and that one gives me no reading while touching its solder point and the grounded point, the right side reads just fine :( so I guess that means dead driver? 
So essentially put one part of the multimeter on the ground of the plug, then match it to the connection on the driver and see if there's a signal?
What part of the driver should I put the lead on that would give a signal?
I'll have to try this when I get home and get back to you
I tried opening it and seeing what the problem was but didn't notice any broken leads on the driver or anything, so I'm not sure

I was a very stupid kid and at the age of about 6 decided to put our family N64 in our dehumidifier water. 

I didn't play much N64 growing up

A note on the pads feeling clamped tight on your ears- try extending the headband a little more. When I first got mine i thought 2 notches was good, but after about an hour it would hurt my ears. After a while I moved it up to 3 notches per side and it felt better on my ears, but started to hurt the top of my head for whatever reason. I moved it again recently to 4 notches per side and now it's juuuust right. If that doesn't work for you though, leave the headphones stretched over a few books overnight, it should help relieve some pressure

Yup you're correct, just checked coinbase it was December 8th
yes sir!
the color of the wires when you strip back the rubber on the 770s cord, there are 3 channels, left, right, and ground
Me and my friend went in on the same day, like December ~~20th~~ 8th, and each bought one LTC @ $139. Well, when it rose up to about $350 a piece, he decided that it was going to rise infinitely, and decided to buy 3 more at around $350-$375. Now his mentality is "my friend talked me into buying this shit now I'm down all of it"

.............................................wat
okay smart! that's much easier if you have less experience with soldering. The best tip i have for you then is bronze = ground, blue = ground, and red = right. I have also used [these](https://www.redco.com/Rean-Neutrik-NYS240BG.html) female connectors before and can highly recommend them.

Hey it's me again :) Since you've decided you're actually gonna do the mod, I would go ahead and lookup a ton of material on soldering, things like how to tin small wires, and making a clean connection. The stock pads on the 770s are probably your best bet, they're so freakin comfortable and they compliment the bass on the 770s very well. [Use these connectors](https://www.amazon.com/Nine-3-5mm-Stereo-Panel-Connector/dp/B01C3RFHDC/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1518443708&sr=1-3&keywords=3.5mm+jack) from amazon, and yes I would get the 10 pack because I screwed up at least 3 of them before getting it right haha.

I would say yes, especially if you're just learning, but I ended up not using it as much as I thought I would
Do you have a soldering iron at hand already? I wouldn't recommend this as your first soldering ever, they're pretty small connections and if you heat up the wrong part for too long you can damage them permanently. It takes a good amount of looking through the forums and researching but it can be done. I didn't have much soldering experience beforehand but I modded a [different pair](https://i.imgur.com/RkNlUIK.jpg) first to really figure out the wiring situation. I bought [this](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AS28UC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) soldering iron to do it and it works really well and I've been using it since for a bunch of other things. Just look up some tutorials on learning to solder before buying it to see if you think you can do it. 

I wouldn't recommend that cable I have pictured, it's pretty hard to carry around and it makes a ton of noise when you tap it. I started making my own cables, which is a whole other process, but also a great way to learn soldering without the chance of fucking anything up. 

I modded the hole slightly differently than how I saw other people doing it. Most people use a dremel to widen the hole a bit to get the jack to fit, but I didn't have one, so I ended up melting the edges a bit with my soldering iron. Would not recommend, it was super messy and probably dangerous. 

You can ask me anything you need to here and I'll help you out, the process was tough without anyone to walk me through it so I know how it feels, but it's amazing when it's done. Very accomplished feeling.  
sorry had to do some digging. I explain the process in the comments of this thread. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/74gz5z/help_dt_880_removable_cable_mod/

Here is the headfi thread that I followed from the start. You'll probably need to do some digging through that thread to find all of the good tips.

https://www.head-fi.org/threads/beyer-dt770-pro-80-detachable-cable-mod.643648/

Finally, here's a link to how mine ended up looking. I used cotton instead of glue to fill the hole because I wasn't all that confident with my soldering skills and I didn't want it to be permanent

I got this one! I did this to my own set, I'll link you to my post where I explained the whole thing to somebody

what percentage of your holdings did you get back?
any dangers to doing this? not trying to kill my 1070 for a little extra garlic
I'm not sure to be honest, it's my biggest holding, but it's been a slow month compared to almost everything else. Charlie has said over and over he has big announcements for 2018 though so I'm going to hold for now, I like the project and it's one of the bigger names, plus it touched $400 like a month ago so I feel like it has so much potential.

I didn't get the message comfirming from the bot that it sent, but I think it might have because my balance is .05 again. Idk if this information is useful but hey fuck it

id love to try it out, i wanted to use the rai blocks one but i couldnt for the life of me figure out how to buy rai
why, is that super long? the payout was actually way more than i was expecting so I have nothing to complain about

edit: and also, i was sending it over to garlicwallet.com, where I think it takes even longer to confirm
what happened with garliclol? I was pooling through bakery yesterday and the payout was like 4-5 hours when all done.

that im not totally sure about. these take a bit of practice to get used to, and at first its easier to cut yourself with this than a standard gillette razor, but over time its super beneficial because you'll get a cleaner shave with less irritation. Maybe someone over at /r/wicked_edge has more information on the subject than i  
There are some that are significantly sharper, like Kai blades really need some practice to not cut yourself, while Gillette blues I consider dull. Yellow is my middle ground, sharp but comfortable
Yes it can. They're extremely sharp and with some practice you can get extremely accurate with them
This one

My best guess is it's not a mod doing it, it's AutoModerator. You can program it so when a post gets X amount of reports, it is automatically locked. Looks like a mod manually approved it since then. It's probably people who don't like IOTA cause they're not invested in it.

I hate to say it, but nothing is bubble proof. Vechain has had an insanely strong run, and has real use case, but so do other coins, they're not immune either. If Bitcoin were to pop, the entire market would pop with it, Vechain included. I have a small amount in Vechain also, and know it's a great coin, but definitely not immune.

correct. I was kind of giving a projection of the subreddit; it seems like every single person on here HATES the fact that XRP is centralized and treats it like the devil
like it or not, ripple is here to stay. it's been around since the beginning, and even though tying with banks goes against everything crypto is about, it gives more legitimate use cases for blockchain than 99.9% of coin out there
Could be a good thing though, gives us Americans enough time today to buy low before it resurges

The reason they listed the dogecoin first (and why they include it as an option at all) is because they have a dripper called the doge, so it's fitting

No. You know what? Just go away.

Every time someone posts a picture, a gif, a video, a screenshot, or just anything really that involves some kind of "corporate" thing - A video game, a logo, or probably just even the town hall of a city given how overboard you dummies go, you have to /r/HailCorporate it.

I'm done. I've had enough. You can't just spam /r/HailCorporate and expect an upvote. You can't just be like "dude, you're playing a game?" and post /r/HailCorporate. You just can't.

I doubt you even work for corporate given how against them you are. You live in a cardboard box, typing on your CrapBook Pro, feeling good about yourself because you think you just "called someone else out" for being a corporate shill.

Just who do you think you are? Some epic 12-year-old on the internet with le cool fedora posting about how "corporate shill hails this, corporate shill hails that?" Well, I've got news for you. You aren't anything. You aren't epic, you aren't a 12-year-old, and your fedora certainly isn't le cool.

I hope in time you will learn that not everybody and everything is a corporate shill.

I bet he's laughing, this was on December 18th, 2013, right when the bitcoin price rose from $200 to $1000 over one month, then began to steadily drop down, finally settling at around $400-$500 for THREE YEARS, when in December 2016 it finally began to spike back up again. The day this post was made, the price was $593.26. I'm hoping he hodled to the end, or there might be a lot more drunk forum posts

I put in $50 on ETH when it was rising to $520 :/ still learning this game lol
Last time this was posted (Friday I think?), I decided I was done watching the prices rise and bought my first crypto, one Litecoin. Already up $50. Thanks coin meme guy!

I finished last season diamond 1, then was placed diamond 2 in solo standard. About 10 games after my placement I played Torment in solo standard. It was a little scary

Just bought LTC as my first crypto, I can only pray with you guys

I've never bought coin but i think this might be where I start. How do I begin?
