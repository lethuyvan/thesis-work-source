Wasn't he against the money? Just fell into line after it was passed?
Tbf the military is stretched extremely thin across the globe because we station so many troops in various countries. The Crux of it is that the military has too many directives/missions. To some degree because they are abused to political advantage.

yes, i tihnk the celeb bit can be reenergized with some better celebs

YES!
eh I thought some of the tg celeb interviews were kind of fun. could be again. the hoff stinks
yes! 100% the shots were cut really tight (why I say it's overproduced). I tihnk it was especially bad because "the hoff" sucked so hard so they had to edit the crap out of him
yeah the audience laughter a bit too well timed. ah well i don't think we can ever go back to that pokey old motoring show
Yeah I liked that bit also 
It will always be scripted. They need to have fewer cuts, longer shots. Better celebrities

At least the book series is excellent
haha no, rock. no good i'm guessing?
When I hear about you story I tihnk about all of the star trek episodes where they explore Geordi's blindness. In one expisode they visit a planet where genetic screening has eliminated all genetic differences like blindness, etc. However when the planet is threatened by a major disaster they are saved by a technology that was developed specifically to make the visor that gives Geordi the ability to see. It's a pretty good episode! http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/The_Masterpiece_Society_(episode)
it's also a kind of super power if you could just block out all noise at will. taking a nap on the train, for example

What's up with the intense ads in that article? they were very distracting
I thought he chose not to vote because he viewed clinton and trump as one and the same...which is an ignorant and egregious error clearly
ah what a nice discussion here!
you should do an AMA!
I also live right near one. I highly recommend dried shrimp. They are this chewy umami explosion. I made this dish http://ohsnapletseat.com/2013/07/08/chinese-stir-fried-cabbage/ to learn the technique of cooking them (I use veg oil) and now I'm expanding on that and adding lots of other weird ingredients like other vegetables and fish tofu which is like a very tasty tofu with really flavor 
uh that's not why I disliked it. frankly I found it a bit trite and I thought the thieves were too goody-too-shoes to even be real.
did not like very much also

Care to delineate the rights trampled by healthcare programs around the world? Maybe start with Canada 
Having lived in Canada for ten years I can vouch for the reasonably good healthcare with none of the insane stress that comes in the American system.
The problem is Democrats don't vote 
<3 Michael Smith 
That opinion seems to be the popular one around this sub. Personally I love my burgers to be similar to meatballs. No bread crumbs but I use meatloaf trio, an egg, lots of diced onions, Italian herbs, anchovy paste, olive oil and salt. I love that crunchy onion in the patty  and they always come out very juicy and delicious 
Huh I just went to /r/islam and I thought people were very nice about it, supportive of gays generally but very conflicted because it is clearly a sin in the Quran. I dunno, I just searched for all posts mentioning "gay" and I thought there discussion was very open minded. Maybe I missed something?
I left fi but kept my voice account for hangouts which has been an excellent move to maintain the things you list about fi that you like

these are the esoteric issues that bite to the core of democracy and its improvement. Even though Trudeau did not push electoral reform though, I think it was wonderful how well educated the concerned the canadian populace was in regard to this complex issue, while here in america we are still flinging feces at each other. Electoral reform can have a great outsized positive effect on the country, and it is these fundamental principles that will push any country in the positive direction. At lease in the US we had the successful SCOTUS case against gerymandering, that's something!
the pre-existing conditions clause kind of changed the way americans perceive healthcare. I think it started to make people think that everyone needs and "deserves" healthcare, not health insurance. Why would an insurance company ever take someone who they absolutely know will take more than they give? This changes the entire paradigm of views on healthcare, driving home that it is the care we need, no the insurance.
it's not healthcare in the US, it's still based on this antiquated notion of health "insurance" as if some people might never need it
It might mattere for other politicians watching though 
no that's the ikea crib theyre getting

Whenever I "add album to queue" in Spotify it does not actually add the album to the end of the current queue but rather insterts the album between the song i'm playing and whatever is left of the album i'm listening to. Is there a solution here? It seems totally idiotic that Spotify would make it like this when for the past forever years in any half decent music organizer "add song/album to queue" always means adding to the end of the queue
use the app "DiskUsage" which scans and displays your storage space in a 2D graphical rendering, where each file/folder is a drilldown square so you can quickly figure out what file(s) is/are hogging up all of the space. There's also a similar utility for windows that is very useful for PCs as well

I haven't had bootloop problems but my battery is shit after 6 months. It drains faster than it can charge when I run maps and podcasts 
I think dragonair looks like it is giving us the middle finger
oh i forgot about the cavalcade, i guess you're right
seconded. my 5x is 9 months old and it drains battery faster than it can charge when running gmaps and podcasts. i went 4->5->5x i think i'm done with google phones, especially since i'm pretty much priced out of them at this point
uh my car is from 2006...i have an fm transmitter :( do you not understand people who cannot just go out and buy a new car?
I prefer to to have a bunch of wired chargers throughout my life...like at home, in the kitchen, work, in my bag, in my other bag...plus the usb charger can be used for all of my devices. That way I do not have to remember to pack a charger everywhere i go.
so i would have to bring a wireless charger every time i go on some trip?
ah might as well buy a new car  so i can charge my phone
Having lived in Canada for ten years...the stress level is just so much lower and the quality of life is much higher because you are not worried about healthcare expenses. I moved to the US and immediately broke my ankle and had a firsthand (foot?) experience of the US system and it is absolutely rubbish. Even having insurance caused a hug amount of stress and expense.

I knew an American who was a girl guide leader 
We are both in chemistry and I went to the us for grad school and she is following. She secured a job soon after I came here but then things exploded. Currently in "administrative processing", which is taking an abnormally long time

this is not true. Iran is so far from saudi arabia

Maybe the effects on the lungs aren't caused by liver metabolism but the effects on the heart may pass through the liver. I'm not sure what the mechanism of toxicity of nicotine is, but I do think it is likely the pharmacologically active species. 
One of the biggest uses of the Ames test is that it looks at metabolites of the compounds not only the the parent species. I believe they treat the material with liver enzymes and then see what the resulting products do. Often it is the metabolites that cause the major problems

Somehow this actually called me down and I had enough presence of mind to pull the skirt and swim. Chest burned for hours after.

Quick question does the video spoil the chapters from the next book?
Or a hair on the back of your throat like that curb episode
I think there is a specific spoilers label that excludes the chapters but no one ever uses them. Otherwise I could never look at anything in this sub 
Interesting theory, and you are alluding to the base metals like sodium etc in common bases of chemistry in former times?
Skip catelyn chapters. They were the worst on reread 
I think it will be a nearly exact replica of the time when Jaime killed the mad king to deliver the throne to the rebels via Ned stark. He will deliver the realm to her by killing cersei and she will be somewhat required to keep him around. She or her representative (a la Ned) will come into the throne room with him on the iron throne and he will be sitting there legs up and he will yield the seat to her. He may figuratively vanish into the mist thereafter because he has done this shit too many times and does not want to babysit another monarch who may eventually go crazy again. Thus he may decline her offer of some position in her court. I think she will appreciate and respect that Jaime did what he had to do when he ousted her crazy father because he deserved it.
I started reading them around 2003 and the fan community was so much more interesting back then. The theories being developed were so much more detailed then since they could use very small textual clues like eye color etc. Currently the community is too wrapped up in comparing the show and the books and such and the discourse has really plummeted IMO. Otherwise I thought grrm was relatively well known among fantasy readers

What is the reaction that converts propene into glucose?
Edit: nvm figured out what you were trying to say
White Meadows is a beautifully shot iranian film. The setting is the salt lake Urmia among the large salt encrusted islands. The shots of the black figures against the white salt is haunting. Also a very thought-provoking film.
So they first use KOH here to freebase, and is the second addition to prevent HCN formation or what?
[This](http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/pdf/10.1139/v70-297) paper shows how glucose can be synthesized from an acrolein dimer, so at that point you would just have to figure out how to make acrolein from CO2. Acrolein could conceivably be constructed from some various C1 species (building blocks containing 1 carbon) which could be made from carbon dioxide. Working backwards, An aldol reaction between formaldehyde (synthesis [here](http://pubs.rsc.org/En/content/articlelanding/2015/gc/c5gc00599j#!divAbstract) but also likely could be made a few different ways from CO2) and acetaldehyde will get you acrolein. Now we just need acetaldehyde. If you hydrogenate CO2 to methanol ([example](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951713003278)), turn that methanol into methyl iodide (appel reaction), lithiate the methyl iodide to methyl lithium, hit CO2 with methyl lithium to make acetic acid and then reduce to acetaldehyde (for example, rosemund reaction). Now that I think about it more, acetaldehyde could also just be made by acyloin condensation of formaldehyde followed by samarium iodide deoxygenation of the resulting alpha-hydroxy-acetaldehyde into acetaldehyde, which could avoid having to to the full formal reduction of CO2 to methyl lithium. Point is there would be many approaches. that was fun!

I don't think phenyl is bigger. In my chemistry right now I'm observing that 2,6-diisopropylphenyl is less sterically demanding than t-butyl. mesityl might be something to look at or menthyl.

This thread was weird
Lol moly cows/pigs is the term used because it comes from radioactive molybdenum which is created in a nuclear reactor. I meant it does not exist naturally on earth. The only traces of tc on earth come from meteorites 
Yeah there is a larger electron cloud arising from those methyls that repulses and is not present otherwise. This is one reason why pyridine is significantly nucleophilic though is a relatively poor base 
e != ~4.26082047636


sterics
most likely it meant basicity. A generic secondary amine is a better base due to inductive effects, but nucleophilicity is majorly affected by steric bulk, whereas basicity is mostly a thermodynamic effect

That seems like not such a bad plan. sodium bicarb leads to a lot of foaming, but you don't end up with a crazy basic solution if you overshoot. Make sure to be careful when you dissolve the sodium hydroxide as it will generate a lot of heat upon dissolution and a hot solution of sodium hydroxide can be pretty dangerous. A decent way to control all of this is to just add a bunch of ice directly to the water. Also make sure to keep agitating the solution to get a homogeneous solution over the course of the addition. Make sure to take safety precautions: wear safety glasses and rubber gloves and cotton clothes that cover your whole body including closed toed shoes. I might do it outside on the lawn or something, especially if you have to use bicarb and you might foam everywhere. I can't think of the best order of additions off the top of my head (base to acid or acid to base) but it helps to have the solution you are adding to be a fairly large volume, as all of the water acts as a heat sink. It would be a good idea to calculate your stoichiometry/moles of each to know if you will need additional acod or base to achieve a neutral solution.
Well either way it's not accurate for anything

Grignard and cerium chloride (or some Lewis Acid, though cerium chloride is the classic) would likely lead to the ring opened ketone product which could then be subjected to conditions for reductive amination (sodium borohydride). The thing to look out for is double addition into the carbonyl by the grignard, but I think that might be limited by the intramolecular interaction between the resultant ketone and deprotonated amine. If double addition is a major problem you could ring open to the weinreb amide first and then do the grignard and reduction.
*edit: for the grignard addition you may need to protect alcohols (TBS, etc) and potentially hide your ester (ortho-ester or acetal)

The biggest problem with a government funded R&D structure is the haphazard and politically motivated way money is splashed around on different projects in the government. The recent ["cancer moonshot"](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/01/15/moonshot-they-say) is a classic example of a big flashy politically motivated project that is doomed to fail. See [this](http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/01/dear-mr-president-please-stop-with-these-science-moonshots/) also. The government does not have the requisite patience for something like drug discovery. A good start could be a constant X% increase in NIH funding, but that is not sexy enough, and every time there is a new president the targets change hugely. While perhaps it may end up more fair in the end, a fully government funded medical R&D program will be completely inept.
Well I have only been shopping for climbing gear at REI two times but both time the selection was terrible and the prices were really high. The REI prices were about the same in USD as the CAD price was...which is absurd. The selection was crap and there was no help to either. Not sure why I got downvoted to hell? Now MEC is becoming way more lifestyle oriented, and while their selection of climbing/mountaineering stuff is still decent, I fear that it will begin to shrink as they sell more Nikes etc..
REI sucks so hard compared to MEC, but MEC is going down now too...

Interesting I have not heard this referred to as trituration, but it works on the same principle. this site seems to put all types of htis under the same category http://www.commonorganicchemistry.com/Sidebar/Trituration.htm
it's pretty much just washing a solid. Add solvent to solid, mix slightly, and then remove with a pipette. Ideally the solid is stuck to the glass and you can kind of decant it. That's how I do it, but it's a pretty crude procedure. A few labs ago had a centrifuge in lab which was awesome for trituration. After mixing, just centrifuge down to a nice solid mass and pipette/decant off the top.

I read a Proust screenplay once. I think they are closer thematically than stylistically, but that is after a very limited Proust experience. Knausgaard is very stream of conscious with dreamy transitions between sequences. I like how the plot also drives you to read more, not simply a hunger for more writing. 
I'm really enjoying part one of my struggle by knausgaard. I was a little daunted at the thought of starting this novel, but the writing is so beautiful it is really engrossing and pleasant to read. It helped to tell myself I would just read part one unless I loved it. A little over half way through.

so say you have two radio buttons for an option on say an online survey (yes or no or something like that, usually little circles that fill in when you choose them), if you choose one you cannot choose another by design. This is like two radios talking to each other, when you have the transmit button pressed, the other side cannot also transmit to you, thus "radio button". Contrast this to check-boxes where you can choose several at once. I just realized this, not sure if it's the real reason but it blew my mind.
Omg I just figured out why they are called radio buttons 
We have a sonicator for jewelry cleaning (sharpertek digital XP pro, sketchy brand I know) which I'm pretty sure was dirt cheap and we might have gotten used but it works great

I'm not sure if it was the raging adrenaline or not, but the breath of water was not that bad, and I remember no pain or anything. Afterwards was terrible though and my throat and chest burned for a long time.
I was disoriented in a flipped over white water kayak. I couldn't tell which way was up. After struggling for a while I took a deep breath of water.  Eventually I was able to settle myself, rip the cord and swim out.
The best designs in catalysis come not from the computation chemistry, but from human imagination. I highly highly doubt a computer will ever be solving these problems. It just requires far too much creativity. Frankly I'm shocked how uninformed this comment sounds.
How certain are you that the impurity is moisture? If it is indeed water, lyopholizing it will solve your problem. Your bioservices should have this if your lab does not, or perhaps some chem/bio group. It is specific for removing moisture and you typically end up with a fluffy product. If that does not work it is likely oiling out due to impurities other than water and requires columning or recrystallization. When I was working with phosphonium salts I could get them from oil to powder form by stirring vigorously in ether overnight, so that may be something to try as well. I hate azeotroping not only because it is tedious, but also all the heat required to remove toluene or other solvents typically end up degrading my product further.

The dairy queen around the corner from my house. They have this loyalty program called belly and I used to go all the time because every three visits you could get a free ice cream. You have to tap in at the ipad at the front, but there are no instructions anywhere and the staff have no idea what they are ding. One day i go in and there is a pretty big line. I go over to the ipad and redeem my visits for a free ice cream. I then wait in line and when I tell them I have the free ice cream they say I needed to do it in front of them. Well we got into a bit of an argument and I don't get any ice cream, and so I called the manager the next day. He said they did everything right. Because I'm petty, I've never been back. At the least the guy should have given me a 2$ ice cream for free with the caveat that the ipad needed to be checked in front of them. Either way, I have not been back to that dairy queen for two years, but boy on a hot day I would love some dairy queen. I still go to any other location.
that's bizarre

With 1 trillion you could buy the top 4 companies, so no you could not (http://www.statista.com/statistics/272716/global-top-biotech-and-pharmaceutical-companies-based-on-market-value/). Even if a government could probably buy out ~90% of all of the big pharmaceutical companies it would be a total disaster. Looking at megamerger companies like pfizer and you see that they are not innovative. You cannot stick two companies together that get ~5 drugs approved every year and expect that megacompany to then make 10 drugs the next year. Furthermore, you add that this monopoly is owned and run by the government and the productivity would crash even further than your typical megamerger company. Then there is the issue that now this huge government organization is run at the whim of the government and all of the politics that come therein and then the whole machinery would be brought to a standstill. No Alzheimer's cure for anyone.
It costs 5-10b just to develop a single approved drug...so that trillion dollar wealth fund is not going far

I would just dissolve it, dilute it quantitatively, and then try to see how HPLC-MS looks. Positive or negative ESI would work, but in my experience positive is a better ionization. Hopefully you have a standard material and you can make a calibration curve. There may be some matrix effects on the ionization, that is, the other stuff in the supplement could impact how well the phosphocreatine ionizes, and in that case you might need to run an SPE cleanup step. A quick google search I found this HPLC paper: http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperInformation.aspx?PaperID=37291
On a quick google search the easiest way may be by 31P NMR, but HPLC is significanltly more quantitative: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1731953

I am in process chem and I am interested to see if the chemistry works in a solvent quality that is more likely to be seen on large scale.
I use the heel of a previous grignard to activate the magnesium and it works well. I believe it mostly works because it consumes any adventitious moisture. Before that I would just add a small amount of the alkyl bromide (a liquid) to the magnesium grit and that worked ~70% of the time.
ha! yes! It took me a long time to figure out to use the magnesium grit instead of turnings. Still figuring out little wrinkles of the reaction, though.
I am a little concerned about the Mg activation of the alkyl bromide, it can be capricious. I'll go for the inhibitor free i think.
Yeah I'm mostly into sport and trad. Thanks!

You seem to be using pretty bizarre TLC solutions. I would stick to the basics: Pet. Ether/EtOAc (or Hexanes/EtOAc, same same mostly), DCM/MeOH, and EtOAc/MeOH. Try not to go more than 10-15% MeOH. I have experimented outside of these solvents in the past but they typically do not result in as tight of spots by TLC.

the whole browns office is a huge disaster though, with sashi brown in charge of personnel and depodesta in there, you already have two major guys who are not even football people, and that undercuts ray farmer as the gm. slapping a decent coach on top of that snarglefart will not a rose make. I predict that the browns will be in even worse shape next year.

If you have a centrifuge they are great for isolating fine powders, especially when paired with a hand mixer. Just centrifuge the powder down, decant off the liquid, add your rinsing solvent, shake it up, and then re-centrifuge. rinse+repeat however much you want. Make sure to have the centrifuge balanced with dummy vials or it will explode at speed.

An interesting stat for QB's would be their percentage share of all the passing YDs/TDs/Rec/etc in the entire league of that season. Perhaps that statistic could be compared over time?

Lithiate the alkyl chloride and then react with electrophilic fluorine source like 4-iodotoluene difluoride or something similar. I doubt the disulfide would survive, but if you are looking for different ideas there is one.
Actually, it depends on the fact that I know what it is like in America. ICBC is ridiculous in comparison.
you're joking about ICBC being good, right?
You should probably add at -80 and then slowly allow the reaction to warm to 0 or RT

I'm not sure charcoal would capture chlorine
The line is pretty fine, and in fact I would have to say there is a lot of overlap. So many deaths are caused by heat attacks, recent findings that eating red meat causes cancer, etc. are reasons the FDA could cite for regulating the sale of unhealthy foods. There definitely needs to be some political oversight of the FDA.
But should the FDA outlaw food that is unhealthy and causes heart problems like fried food?
can you explain this stabilization?
Yes, there was a radiolab about how it has been successful in Brazil
Interesting, TIL. Is the tris acetoxy borohydride more reactive then?
It might be that the massive steric bulk of the polymer prevent the molecule from binding in the active pocket(?) to taste sensing proteins
Borohydride reductions are almost always done with MeOH, I believe it's a solubility thing. Typically it requires excess reagent
That gets a little more complicated. What about fatty and salty foods? Should the FDA regulate that? There needs to be some control over what the FDA does.
I don't think the browns have much of a choice
Thanks for the details! I will have to try some raman in the future. I'm not sure where it is available for use, but I will look into it.
The crystal is pretty robust, I'm not very careful with it, and you can wash it easily with any solvent your stuff is soluble in, no extra special cleaning required.
To be honest, I'm not sure about the head-to-head comparison between the spectra, but I think they come out pretty close. ATR is commonly cited in literature for characterization. I can see how Raman is superior, but it seems like SERS requires a lot more work(?) having to put your stuff on nanoparticles. Do you just buy nanoparticles, or do you have to make them? How expensive are they, and are they one-time use? Additionally, one major advantage of IR that will take a very long time for Raman to catch up, is the vast quantity of molecules that have been IR characterized, so it is easy to look up even complex molecules synthesized decades ago. For that reason I'm not sure Raman would ever displace IR in synthetic chemistry, especially since so few people even bother with IR anymore. I just get it last minute because JOC/OL require it.
oh, hello
you gotta TLC and column that...way too impure to be even looking at it by NMR yet
great post, but most modern IR use ATR, so making a KBr pellet or Nujol mull is no longer required. They are really easy to run.

if the aldehyde is available I think reductive amination would be the preferred rxn
i second the reductive amination if the aldehyde is available. To avoid the over alkylation problem and you still want to use the alkyl halide, lithium amide addition to the alkyl bromide may work at lower temperatures. Think about this though: make the nitro with sodium nitrite and then reduce that to the amine.

For good separation use closer to half the col, for bad sep use closer to 2/3, for excellent sep use a silica plug. Try to have your PDT rf be around 0.5-0.7 depending on separation (faster if separation is better). And, yes grams and cm.
same with the cbs sports app. it absolutely never works. what's the deal with apps that don't work?

Use a column based on this rule of thumb: the max mass a column can separate = col. diameter squared divided by ten. try to have a column big enough to handle the expected mass of pdt, but still be in the range. Then a good guess is to fill the column half to 2/3 full.

I would add sat bicarb dropwise while stirring and cooling with ice. You can do NaOH if your product is very robust towards base and heat (because a lot of it will evolve) but in my nitrating reactions the reaction turns into a mess when quenched with solid naoh, even though the pdt was pretty stable.
