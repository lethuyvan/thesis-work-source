Not a noticeable gain, three percent really isn’t all that much.
Read the top comment and then rethink your decision. 
Oh my god, cannot unsee 
8+, no issues
You’re right, not all third parties use bad parts, but most of them do, and I wouldn’t want to risk getting subpar parts in something as expensive as a smartphone. 
Saying “normies” is such a normie thing to do 
I’ll be honest, I want one, but I have an 8+ and am far too attached to Touch ID.
You stated that supersampling in far cry 5 had no visual difference whether it was on or off, when super sampling is not enabled in far cry 5, as it already has a PS4 Pro version, so it’s all or nothing. Thus, your statement is wrong, not kinda wrong, but completely wrong. And this isn’t non confrontational, it’s a pathetic attempt at passive aggressiveness, next time take a trip to Canada if you want to learn to properly be passive aggressive, as Canadians are both nice and masters of passive aggressiveness. 
You’re getting downvotes because you’re crying online in a forum after stating a falsehood. You wouldn’t notice a difference using a feature that does not work the way you think it does. 
I swear potheads are like vegans, every time one enters the room they have to let you know, except vegans might actually get a bit of a health boost. 
It’s the angle of the photo and how she has her finger bent slightly, you dodo brain
$30 USD I believe
I think the word you’re looking for is trinity, not trilogy. A trilogy implies that the games are all part of the same series and perhaps sequential. 
Apple reserves the right to reject it, you let a third party tinker with it and now it’s damaged and you want a replacement. Should’ve just gone to Apple in the first place. 
Did you bother to activate find my iPhone? If not, it’s a goner
No, it doesn’t. Nintendo has a fairly significant role in this, as well as WWE2K18 
You seem like a nice person
It’s forgetting the part where it mentions that not America also contains 90% of the world’s salt 
I think you mean *120 years ago, America wanted a war to show off its military prowess, and created one with Spain*
Yeah, I know what you mean. I only really cared for 1 and two, but being $20 a piece, I figured I’d just get both(even though I promised myself I’d only spend $20). Saw that the whole trilogy was $40 and figured, hell with it, may as well buy the entire pack. 
I was going to bring up the fact that it’s incredibly difficult to use a wired headset with the switch, but Nintendo mentioned that there was more then one way to hook up headset(not that they’ve actually shown us any alternatives). But this is definitely another great yet absent feature. 
Yeah, I know what you mean, it keeps suggesting that I go to “create-a-cig” every time I start to leave my university campus. 
I’ll be honest; the charger not coming in the box is not the end of the world, especially considering they’re like $8-$10. And with its price point, it did change-from $250(what my parents paid when I was back in high school), and with its current $200 price point, you’re effectively buying into a well established platform. You’re paying a premium price for a system with many features, a solid library of games, and a console that can be taken anywhere, and the games are cheaper than other consoles (albeit much weaker and watered down versions). 
*shots fired in Silicon Valley, officers in area, please respond to that location, over*
I completely understand where they are coming from, that being that they want to protect the kids from the shitty people on the internet, but at the end of the day, it is a parents job to be involved with what their children are doing online and who they are interacting with. It’s not fair to anyone else who wants a proper online experience that we can’t add friends by username, chat in a party, or even message them because they’re afraid of what idiots online will send to random people(particularly children). We deserve a better gaming experience, or Nintendo will never be as successful as they can be with all of these features added. I’m not asking for anything outrageous, just simple features that Nintendo’s competitors already offer. 
I didn’t say that they’re out to get us, I *said* that Nintendo obviously doesn’t care about us. And we are owed a decent gaming experience, and while Nintendo has created a fantastic console and games equally as fantastic, it’s no secret that it is lacking very, very basic features that other competitors offer
Because it defies the circlejerk that Nintendo can do no wrong? These are all legitimate points, and I’m not being hateful towards Nintendo in anyway, but it’s clear they do not care if we lose or saves, have fun with our friends across the globe/country, or want to provide a proper online community 
Yet Nintendo continues to treat us like shit:no cloud saves, no real online, making us use an app for party chat, etc. I love Nintendo, but they obviously do not love us, or they’d fix their problems. I’m terrified of something going wrong, having to send it in for repairs, and losing all my saves, and I’m tired of not being able to add friends via online ID instead of  this stupid friend code shit. 
I have the cellular version, it came in a rectangular box lol
They got to keep making up nonsense because they don’t want to admit that it’s a budget iPhone, and most people buy iPhones because they’re seen as a sort of “look how wealthy I am” club. For whatever reason they tell themselves they’ve got the better product, rather than just being satisfied with their own purchase. It can’t be that way, others *have* to feel the same way or they’re wrong, and then they become verbally abusive. 
Because Yoda knew that Rey had the texts, and knew Luke didn’t have it in him to do it, hence why luke freaked out when he thought yoda destroyed the texts. I get that you think you’re right but you are reading into this too much. Just because you think you’re onto something does not mean you actually are. You’re over examining things, seeing connections where they don’t exist
Sure you do man, sure you do
Cardboard and some shovel ware, mind you
If I was being an idiot online or in person, then yes, I would actually want someone to tell me as such. Not everything can be sunshine and daisies. 
Wasn’t particularly aimed at you, and I also have a switch and PS4 pro, but this was more oriented at other comments, but didn’t care enough to respond to them directly. 
I love how this subreddit used to say all the time “4K doesn’t mean anything/graphics don’t mean anything it’s GAMEPLAY that means anything. Now with the Xbox One X, people are like lol Sony fags and their non native 4K. And now this, we’re stuck playing Xbox 360 games because Microsoft can’t be bothered to make any decent exclusive games for themselves outside of remastering the original halo games. 
Why? Didn’t realize this subreddit was a FAQs. People choose to come here rather than just google something. 
I’m sure🙄 which is why it’s constantly doing it, Siri won’t do it on my iPhone either. 
“Someone criticized a company and their products that I like, so I’m going to accuse them of lying, so I don’t have to come to terms that Apple doesn’t care about their products or consumers anymore.”
“Stop projecting you insecure neck beard”
You should try your own advice for once, you uneducated liberal. Shave your beard and leave the house for once. Oh, and pay your fucking taxes while you’re at it.
Lefties: gets pissy at any slight disagreement from the indoctrination they received politically, yet still calls themselves “tolerant.”
Bad bot
They’ve taken too much damnit! All the kids...the elderly....the rape of all those young women!!! It’s too much, those damn flightless birds deserve nothing but death! And I will make sure each and every emu is slaughtered! Like animals!!! And not just the men, but the women and children too!!
He was scum, not worthy of continuing his barbaric life here on earth. He had to die, and now I feel safer on the streets after seeing such a barbaric monster lie dead like that. 
Except he was in his fifties when he died
Honestly dude, it sounds like it. That’s what happened before my disc drive shit the bed and I had to get a new console. 
I won’t be buying this game, when it was being released, they made a bunch of political moves while marketing the game, using Charlottesville as part of their PR campaign. And whilst those people who were involved deserved scorn and ridicule, I just don’t like it when companies that are trying to sell me something gets political, regardless of their stance. 
Well it is a metal post, is it not?
Sony has recently started charging taxes in the ps store, even if they don’t legally have too, I think it’s got to do with that big Supreme Court case that’s coming up on whether online digital taxes are constitutional or not. I live in Louisiana and they don’t collect taxes here, and it actually was the same for me as they did to you, no taxes right up until I went to preorder god of war(this was like a month ago for me).
Hahahaah you should take your own advice; black child. 
But they aren’t “law” they’re trade agreements between companies, they can be sued if they refuse to pay the $250,000 violation fees, but not illegal. And why would I care if they get sued if penalized?
Is taking pictures of strangers unknowingly not creep the fuck out of anyone her? Like seriously dude, you’re invading their privacy. 
Hahahahah sorry racist douchebag
You obviously lack the ability to have a well rounded, reasonable, or let alone civil, debate. I truly hope you clean up your attitude towards others, because if not, many people will want nothing to do with you. 
I apologize, I forgot to clarify that I meant Walmart. 
That’s if you get caught though 
I’ve bought several games from employees doing it this way. It doesn’t say anything because you aren’t scanning the barcode, at no point does it ask for a manager when you scan it. It just says “sell not allowed.” But it you dint scan it and go through department 72, you can’t be stopped It’s just if the associate is willing to do it or not.

I know you’re lying because a Japanese person would NEVER refer to themselves as an otaku. In fact, many would ridicule anyone who self identifies as such. 
At Walmart they can enter in an item through a different way. For example, at Walmart you can sign into a register, tap the “department” button on the screen, type in the name of the product  (all ps4 games are titled “PS4GAME”) and then you type in the price and you’re good. It’s really simple but if there’s something wrong with your copy, it can’t be returned as it can’t pull up the items down through this method at customer service, as it doesn’t display a UPC for one to use. You can still use your discount and everything. 
Not really, you could argue that about any battle before the declaration. I’m sure your Wikipedia education taught you that much, if you’re going to get upset over a minor detail such as me using the U.K. rather than Great Britain, despite that in 1707 the union was established between England, Scotland, and Wales. But whatever you say man. 
We weren’t an independent nation, and the Congress was still trying to make amends with the U.K. at this point, so no, not the real birthday for the USA 
Just because someone disagrees doesn’t mean they’re racist. In fact that “classic white bullshit” comment was pretty racist to say. And yes, nonwhites can actually be racist. 
Didn’t realize children we’re allowed on Reddit, I thought Reddit required you to be 18
But boba fett is a clone, so he’s not really an imperial?
As a person who has this game on switch? It’s quite quite boring after playing it for like 3 hours 
Just because you live in the south, does not mean you’re a red neck
Talk to Facebook about?
I’m glad you, the *political genius and psychic* have seen the future and warned us of the near future. 
Yes, but only idiots IV heroin into themselves 
Outlast is also a glorified walking sim with jump scares 
This subreddit is not for advertising apps
I’d love to buy it, but there aren’t enough reviews to let me justify a purchase. I don’t know if this thing crashes a lot or not, and I’ve bought apps in the past that have been riddled with bug and crashes, so I am going to wait on this one, but I’ll archive the post for later. 
Whatever you say man
I see France is in the back doing nothing as usual 
You should let go of your baseless prejudices.  
Yeah, right behind Itachi-sama’s
Roll tide
Gotta indoctrinate them while they’re young, and they’ll be customers for life. I was a teen when I got my first iPod Touch, and now I’m nearing 23 with zero thoughts of switching anytime soon. 
You are obviously doing something to them to damage them
Mostly fine, except it keeps causing my phone to suddenly crash and reboot quickly. Has happened about 6 times since iOS 11.3 was installed on my phone. 
I figured it was due to the lack of power that the switch has🤷🏼‍♂️
I work customer service at Walmart, and you are correct, we do not accept returns from third parties.
It’s not a guideline for what the government can or cannot due, it merely states that the English have rights, but that’s it. At no point does it say “parliament cannot do x”
As long as I can turn them off, that’s fine. I hate games that force any kind of motion controls.  I want to sit on my ass and enjoy my game, not rant at it like those badly designed motion controlled shrines in BOTW. 
Fuck you take that back, they’re both amazing😭
Yeah, pretty much. 
If you’re not a student, you don’t get it for $299, you pay $329 like it costs for all other non students. 
I hate these “look at how much I can spend on apple products” posts. They add nothing of value to the subreddit, and every time someone posts one of these, a million others follow. Are we that low in content here in this subreddit that we must only upvote these to fill in the gaps of info? 

P.S. Enjoy your stuff OP, you’re gonna love them 
It is very far off compared to the Xbox one and PS4 versions graphically. While true it’s awesome to take on the go, that’s it’s only saving grace. The other two platforms look far better, have mods(even if limited on PlayStation), and are far more stable than the switch version
No, just 100 million deaths in their own country.  And you can’t jab at American racism when European racism still exists. Talk to your former colonists, as I bet they don’t feel “fine and free.” Or better yet talk to the Syrian refugees you’re pretending to let into Europe, but are really torpedoing in the Mediterranean Sea, letting them sink and drown.  At you don’t wanna talk about that :) good luck finding a girlfriend to you too pal:) 
“Fine and free” right up until you crack a dark joke and then you’re tossed in jail for offending someone. It’s only free because you had another set of countries come in and free you
You constantly shit talk america in your subreddit, you can give shit but can’t take it? Sounds about right. I don’t like nor dislike Europe, I don’t care either way, but don’t cry about getting shit when you do it all the time. 
They would just bitch about go they shouldn’t en expected to fight and state that “it is a a mans job”
Only because your government doesn’t pull any funds for a military, as all you Europeans have gotten quite comfortable letting the USA protect you from yourselves. Europeans have started numerous world wars after all
No they wouldn’t, they’d be forced to fight while the women stayed home and bitched about unequal treatment 
Hahahahaaha
Not my fault you can’t afford food 
Mistakes happen 
Lmfao triggered another one. I appreciate the salt, we need it to make good food, something you Europeans never learned how to do. But then again I wouldn’t expect it from a continent that’s whole history is shrouded in constant warfare and dictators taking over constantly. 
It’s funny how pissed off you Europeans get, considering you rely on our military, and then talk shit. Maybe we should let the Russians know your stance, pull our troops, and let the have their ways against your defenseless women and children. 
The biggest joke of all time: Europe
Too bad it makes my iPhone 8*+ crash randomly now. 
The same was said about resident evil 7, yet they still launched it with it built into the game. 
Well it would see you’re definitely setting yourself up for disappointment. Can’t wait to see your raging comments/posts about how you can’t believe no mans sky let you down /s
Yet. Phil Spencer did say that future Xbox one X only games could exist. 
Surely there’s stuff you can delete that you never use? There’s no way you use all of that space with stuff you use frequently
Out of curiosity, why are we getting hyped about an update we know nothing about? 
There is literally no need for 512 GB, most people I know who consume a lot of storage space are struggling to fill their 256GB, let alone being able to fill a 512 GB phone 
I checked mine, and my 8+ is sitting at 96% 
Where’s the one for socialist? the shit emoji?
Sounds like the community is making it up then, if no one can produce a source. 
Oh, this post again. It’s not like we see this everyday or anything🙄 but yes op we all know it’s shitty and lazy. 
It’s a brand jackass. Now get your Russian ass off our subreddit 
Is everyone skimming the part where it’s coming to Xbox? Like no mans sky isn’t on Xbox is it?
Can’t take or joke or accept that you’re wrong? You’re  quite the keeper. 
Does it have to be super glue 
I have a 49” 4K HDR tv, will that suffice?
I would trigger some idiot online. 
It’s actually kind of cringey to be honest
This has nothing to do with America, and I’m pretty sure it violates the rules about no political posts 
What has this got to do with iPhones?
Why are you being so rude?

The whole point of neutrally is that you don’t need allies.
I think you mean communism and socialism no? Communism failed in Eastern Europe and the Chinese have implemented many capitalistic ideas to keep their economy going. And if you want to see socialism fail, just look at South America and their economies. 
Your ignorance shall not be tolerated! We neutrals’ position is known, we are *neither* on your side or the other. Revel in your sad little war, and we will reap the benefits of two devastated sides. 
I love this post, but I’m still leaving the subreddit, as there are far too many people here with too much time on their hands that dedicate themselves to being negative all the time. It’s been a half decent ride my dudes, I hope all of you do well. Fare thee well
I take it you are an AT&T user? Why are you getting upset over a random strangers opinion online? It makes no rational sense. Grow up dude
That’s like saying I’d rather have my left hand cut off than my right hand, either way, you’re still losing a hand. 
Whilst I enjoy the app, it keeps crashing every time I scroll through it, I know it’s not like that for most, so I just blame iOS 11, as sometimes it does work like intended. 
Now if they would add actual, quality content to make this games redundancy better, it might be worth booting back up after 5 hours of gameplay. 
Well as a person who has done so because my manager told me to at Walmart, learn to admit you’re wrong and pull your head out of your ass. You’re just arguing because you don’t want to admit that you might be wrong. 
You should lay off the drugs man
Silly question, but have you turned your phone off and back on? And make sure to turn WiFi-assist off 
You can count me in!
Truly a work of art 😸
No I was born just as the 64 came out. That’s just an ugly controller 
Does the prequel side have as cringey comments as yours and the writing of the movies?
That is by far the ugliest controller I’ve ever seen in my life. 
Or any iPhone that’s a six or above 
I bet you’re fun at parties 
Pineapple? Yum. Coconut? Gross
This kitten looks like he’s been through the Vietnam War
I used to think that, then I started looking at European politics and realize that we’re better off anyway. Things like brexit, the immigration crisis(where Europeans are sinking ships to keep more and more immigrants moving into their countries illegally) amongst other things make me realize America is far down shitting itself down the toilet.
You’re either a vehement liar or lazy. Or both. 
Yeah I know what you mean, I bought an apple leather case too and love it. 
No, you’re gonna make it ugly by dropping it and having it be scratched beyond repair alongside a shattered screen. 
Damn, that’s kind of silly don’t you think? You’re bound to scuff the crap out of it, if not outright break it and after spending $1,000 on it too? I just don’t understand how people can do that. 
$45 is not expensive when you’re putting a case on a very expensive smart phone. 
I live in Louisiana and I’ve been playing all day? I haven’t changed my region or anything. 
That website looks totally official 🙄 besides they’re quoting Steve jobs from 8 years ago, and using articles from 2012 to back up their claims, things have no doubt changed a lot since then

You get 10 GB of data for saves on PS4, they changed that well over a year ago. And you do need Gold to have cloud saves. [googled this to be sure I was right before making claims I didn’t know](https://i.imgur.com/hqGtUAU.jpg)
You just like arguing because you’ve got nothing better to do with your time.
That’s a dumb reason to buy a game. 
This is what happens when you inject just one of those nasty marijuanas
I really should play this game some more 
I doubt it’ll be a port of smash, or they would’ve just flat out announced it as such, like they have with every other port. 
Yeah the Czechs are so close to freedom, that’s why when you look at their police and airport security they look like the terrorists out of counter strike.
Ask Apple
Why not post this on apples actual website rather than hoping some strangers online might be able to help?
I think you’re in the wrong sub 
iPhone ear buds only work with apple products o believe, like the mic bit only works with iOS. Pretty sure apple did that on purpose. 
So yes, you lose your items after every run 
Yeah I wouldn’t keep telling yourself that, or you’ll just disappoint yourself. I love my switch, but I’m not gonna lie to myself about what it can run. 
Fuck it, I’d watch it. I’ve seen so much shit tv in my life that there’s no way they can let me down with this, especially if I go in with little to no expectations. 
People are complaining about the comments, making equally as terrible comments. Congrats, you’ve played yourselves. 
These don’t actually record any responses do they?
Then you are very easily entertained lol
There aren’t enough first party games to make the PS4 obsolete
The fuck is your problem?
Lmfao all these whiny babies complaining about there being no games, then more games come and you bitch about them being ports, when we both know you’re all gonna be there day one to buy them. Plus, all the new games will be announced at E3 with online being announced either before E3 or right after. 
Call their phone obviously 
Lmfao you’re such a child. And not a very smart one. 
Do you have have to be a jerk to OP?

Do you know the difference between correcting someone politely and being a douche online?
Thanks man
Thanks dude! 
This game really sounds awesome! But I’m unsure if I’m gonna get it because I don’t have any friends to play it with. 
Do you have proof? Do you want to cite something other than what you personally believe to be true? 
Awww are we upset because someone online questioned your unfathomable devotion to believing everything you read online to be true? 
This exact article has been posted at least once, if not twice before. It’s click bait garbage that is usual to forbes, as the “journalists” that work there are 12th grade creative writing students. Don’t take anything they say with a grain of salt. 
Yeah that’s what I was thinking too, but wasn’t willing to post it in fear of the circle jerk. 
I guess the click bait articles on Snapchat lied to me, I’m not surprised honestly. 
Didn’t black panther underperform though?

Edit: I was misinformed 
There was less effort made in this post than fergie trying to sing the national anthem. 
I think it’s a bit of a stretch to compare a terrorist organization that massacres thousands of innocent  people each year to a fictional rebellion.
Just turn the box and face it in another direction 
Shitpost, and not even a quality one at that. 
Does it bother anyone else that the movie stuff is out of order? I know I’m being picky but it’s bugging me lol

Not for the Wookiee though 
If that’s what you tell yourself to accept an authoritarian regime that abduct kids, slaughter innocents (led by that horrid wanna be of lord Vader, Ben Solo, who is a child of one of the empires most wanted mind you) and the destruction of many innocent and loyal citizens of the empire fired by that god awful atrocity, the starkiller base. 
Sssshhh, no one tell the British that their “empire” died about 72 years ago, they don’t like it when you point that out 
But us “being on top” is debatable. 
First off, I appreciate the honest and well thought out response. And I agree, it seems that businesses(not just tech ones) seem to have the compelling desire to cause conflict to draw attention to their products, which is a shame. I too prefer the Apple ecosystem, and after iOS 11, I didn’t have an Apple Watch that I love, I’d totally get an S9+ just to shake things up. I like tech and can appreciate the things that Apple, Google and Samsung are all trying to do, but that doesn’t change the fact that Apple, to my mind, is king.
No. They are abduct children and indoctrinate them, they are no better than those filthy Jedi and rebel scum. 
I thought this was an apple subreddit? Why are people so salty over the S9? Like sheesh. 
Understandable, have a nice day. 
Why?
I’d shoot and kill that abomination 
Probably because there’s so few “big” games out they have to nitpick about the little shit. 
I think it’s just plain sad to see comments complaining about the icons, for God’s sake people go outside, there’s more to life than an icon not having text.
I’m pretty sure it’s a joke on the oscars,  that was nickname “white peoples awards.”

Fuck fema. They ought to be ashamed of themselves on how they not only handled hurricane Katrina, but the flood in both Texas and Louisiana in the last two years. Its despicable what they did to those affected and ought to be shut down and a new organization established in their place. 
I mean, you’re going to the verge for news. Not exactly like educated people write for it, they just get handed the authority to write an article complaining about the puddle they accidentally stepped in when they were six.
I see these types of posts are making a return. Everything really is one big circle lol
You’ve got a keeper there man, happy birthday from Louisiana dude!
Mine does the same https://i.imgur.com/f2IkAuf.jpg
The left one and charging case work fine though, I just need the right AirPod, why replace that when it’s $69 USD? 
How does one do this? My air pods ended up in the washer, and while the left one is fine, the right one has not made it(didn’t even last two weeks rip). So where right would I go to order a new right AirPod? I tried the app to no avail.
Congratulations man, glad you’re finally getting one, and you get to be a member of our club. You’re in for a treat my dude!
It all makes sense now

Perhaps he has another account in his system that isn’t expired? You can activate as many accounts in your PlayStation as primary as you want, you just can’t activate them as primary on more than one system. Like I can activate three as primary in my system, but no be else could do the same. And which PlayStation account did you activate it on, yours or his? We need a little more detail if you want us to help man.  
Give up on chivalry. I went back to it a bit six months or so ago, and the player base was very low on actual concurrent players. I’m talking maybe 7 or 8 people in a match. It’s fun, but you’re gonna need some friends to bring in any fun. 
I once had a buddy receive a cease and desist notice from Sony after he was harnessing people in PlayStation playroom thing. He go in there, look for something to fuck with the streamer over (got kids? He says something terrible about them, like he’s gonna kidnap them or some fucked up and stupid shit like that for laughs) and Sony told him if it didn’t stop they would permanently ban his account and he’d lose access to all of his games permanently. Needless to say he stopped doing that and switch to shit talking people in game. 
God that’s so condescending. Just because people like different games then you does not make them any less of a person, and just because you like single player games does not make you a better gamer. I play both shooters and single player games, and I’m almost finished with college. Sometimes you like to sit down after a long day after being at work and school and playing some mindless fun.  
Not a single comment other than my own...wow
I’ve always wondered what it was like *after* I emerged

It is actually. Anime characters all have the same generic look about them, and this fits the bill 100%.

A prequel quote in /r/otmemes? Is that legal?
Disgusting. Get this first order propaganda off our divine subreddit. 
I didn’t expect you to respond honestly 😂
Obviously I’m wiping lol
Sooo, Mr. Justin, who’s Maria?😉
It takes me less than ten seconds to poop. I walk in, sit down, poop and wash my hands. All in all, I spend more time washing my hands then pooping. I spend no more than a minute when I’m in the bathroom 

I actually don’t use my phone while I poop, I just poop, wash my hands and leave 
As a person who’s worked fast food, this is simply not true 
It supposed to be that way. It’s supposed to be a “keep this a fucking secret” “don’t fucking tell anyone I said this/that” of course it’s creepy. But I do believe you’re overreacting a bit. 
What the fuck happened to Riku?
Do you buy all your Apple products from strangers on the streets?
Why?
>first paragraph, you pulled the slowdown from your ass
>third paragraph, yeah it can slowdown if you install many things 

Pick one bro and retry. 
They probably should require it, considering you don’t own the phone until you finish paying it off. 
You are wrong. Pull an article with an interview with Steve jobs that specifically states this and I’ll admit you’re right, but I know you can’t, because you’re obviously too stupid to understand that without proof, all you’re muttering is bullshit.
I did, and all jailbreaking does is slow your phone when you put too many customizations on your phone, and crash randomly. Jailbreaking isn’t some cure all, just a service to help nit pickers who prioritize who like having minor tweaks over stability. 
Why are you so dedicated to being wrong? Countless people have proven you wrong, yet you still make stuff up. You obviously don’t even have the service if you think what you’re saying is right 
If you want customization, go to android, it’s always been that way. 
Why are you so dedicated to a belief that is obviously wrong? It’s simply not true yet you’re willing to go on and on about it, and you’re not going to be able to comment very often because of all the negative karma. 
If you wanted new ringtones, you could just buy one you know.
Yet you’re still crying about it online, despite no one caring. You come to an Apple subreddit to cry over something google has done too, but that’s apples fault too correct?
You come off as one of those bums who thinks everything should be free and blames society for not just giving it to you. 
Still pissy over something as stupid as a headphone jack, despite there being plenty of inexpensive wireless headphones.  Quit crying over nothing, if you didn’t like the iPhone without the headphone jack, why did you buy one?
Before you attempt to vilify the government, or criticize any governmental policy whatsoever, make sure you know how to spell. *politicians

Oh, and not all politicians only care about money, some, shockingly enough go into the government to actually *serve the people.*
I played too much of one game completely unrelated to this one, so I’ll call this one mediocre after I’ve bored myself to death with a different companies game, then I’ll ask for them to abandon their work they’ve busted their asses for multiple years on, in favor of a completely different game that will come out when it’s ready.” 
Could you not have just googled the question instead? 
We didn’t “have our asses handed to us.” We lost a war of attrition, that is, a war of our country’s will to keep fighting. They stood no chance militarily, but we lost because people in our country decided they did not want to continue the war. And plus the difference between launching a car and losing a war is that the war was dictated by the government, while the car being launched was a private enterprises endeavor.  
You obviously posted this just to upset people, so my question is: do you not have anything better to do with your time?
Hey doesn’t matter, I intend to start getting my new phones straight from Apple anyway. 
This turns me on in a way that makes me feel ashamed lol, you’re not supposed to sexualize ones cholfhood!😂
Bravo 
You don’t have to be a red neck to have guns
He couldn’t afford the medical bills because his employees all starved to death/were stoned to death for being homosexual. He tired to escape to Europe, but his illness was too far along do deal with the 2 year waiting period that comes with medical care there.
You’re op. 
Whoever drew that fucking retarded looking concept art needs to be taken outback and put down. The artist looks like he has Parkinson’s 
If by underrated you mean total trash, then yes, crash bash is underrated. 
I don’t think calling it gay was necessary was it?
So basically you created an app that’s useless for everything but the newest model iPhone, which is bound to be a much smaller audience than all the other models? Seems like you wasted your time creating the app. 
Emojis are super popular in the West too, pretty much every woman I talk to uses them, and a lot of my guy friends use them too. They’re neat little things and I always welcome more, but damn I won’t lie sometimes I have to hunt for the right fucking one before I send it.  I don’t know the key words to make that highlight and switch with an emoji feature to display the right emojis, so they really should add a search feature. 
TIL that OP is a Tard that doesn’t know when to stop talking. 
This is great lol
Where’d you get that flag?
I mean, unless you’re rebel scum of course 
Both song and Microsoft have games that support local coop with *one console,* I think you meant one controller. 
All quiet on the Western front, just finished it as it was a required reading for one of my history majors classes and it is truly an amazing book. It takes the narrative of a German soldier in World War One and gives a disturbing testament to how god awful the war was to people and how rough life was during the worst event in the twentieth century(it can be argued that the two world wars were just one large war with the same combatants fighting one another).
This is not the subreddit for resizing wallpapers 
I feel that man, I don’t understand why square enix is so terrible to their customers. Why on earth do they announce games only to make them release a decade later?
[thats messed up](https://i.imgur.com/sw6JDcZ.jpg)
I feel like the moment we truly stop caring about this games release is when we’ll finally get it
We didn’t start the war? Really! I’ll be flamed because I’m pretty sure it was Madison who went to the Congress asking for a declaration of war, not Britain with their parliament. And they were fighting a existential war against Napoleon, do you know what that means? It means they had to get the British Torres who fled the Royal Navy and joined American merchant ships back into the Royal Navy because the existence of Britain as they knew it depended on doing so. And no, we were “just a collection of little 13 colonies on the Atlantic coast” we were a fully fledged nation of 18 STATES. Go back to your 10th grade understanding of the war that your football coach taught you 
No you wouldn’t. You obviously lack the ability to do so or you would. I understand that your limited education makes you want to feel like you’re contributing in educated debates, but merely pretending that you are smart does not actually make it so.
Going to insults, of course, because you don’t have the education to contradict me.
You mean the war we started with Britain when they were going to forfeit their belligerent rights despite being in an existential war with Napoleon? Bruise if you look at the numbers, very few Americans  actually ended up in British ships during the impressment problems, the Indian inciting has since been debunked as it wasn’t the UK that did it, it was that Tecumseh inciting them against us, and we failed miserable in the northern theatre of the war against Canada. They only redeeming factor was Jackson kicking British ass in the southern states, this wasn’t a military victory for our country; it was merely a victory because we continued being an independent country. 
Rune factory is not only better but far more fun, as is stardew valley. 
I take it you’ve never read any American history outside of what your schools gym coach taught you?
I take it you treat that  controller like it’s a holy relic despite it being quite flawed?
Because due to Britain’s political system, it allowed Americans to prosper under its colonial rule, while we learned the dynamics of freedom and democracy so when overly mediocre administration pulled some bullshit we were prepared to make the plunge and become the greatest god damn country in the world? Without Britain, there would be no America as we know it, and even if they bug us and talk shit, they’re our boys for life
And it was probably a repost then 
This is not your traditional arms race lol
Fuck, 4 days after dark souls. Fuck it, I’m getting both. 
But I don’t eat while I play video games
Yeah so they can get stuck all the time 🙄
Was trying to watch a video with the phone sideways, and this is what happens when you need to turn the volume down, hence the title. 
Why the address? It’s not like it says the state or country he’s in. 
Why would you bother blurring her face when you put her username and video title in this post?
Is this troop only worth 3/5 of a troop?
Disgusting 
I’m sorry if you couldn’t afford a ps4, pc or Xbox, but the game was not designed for outdated systems. It was the collective complaint of those who refused to move into the new era that caused the bad version to come out, as treyarch had almost completed the game. If you want new games you need to update consoles/PCs from time to time. If not, don’t complain when it loses all support. 
I think you’re the bigger retard here. He’s not retarded, he’s a rapist, but you, you’re flat out retarded. 
That’s because it was never originally to come to ps3 and 360. But people complained so they cut the game and reduced its graphics until it could run on the outdated systems. It didn’t get any season pass content either. 
And all the enemies he defeated fighting in the clone wars, so it’s not an entire loss
iOS 11 is way better, 10 was just plain boring. 
Such is life on Reddit lol
They’re $92 USD, and regular joycons cost $88.80 after taxes, and these were on amazon for $91.98 or something like that, with no additional taxes due to it being an import. So glad I picked these up, they’re more beautiful in person that the photos show off. 
Revel in your deluded ways, traitor. The first order is scum and have managed to twist your mind. The empire took volunteers, the first order abducts children, indoctrinates them, and then forces them to die in a half assed attempt to recreate the glorious empire, and what does the first order deal with? Oh that’s right their own troops turning coat!
I ordered the super marker odyssey joycons off of amazon, however they were $92(but I figured an extra $12 wouldn’t kill me despite it being imported from Japan) and I think they’ll look nice with my grey joycons.
It was pretty great to me
It’s what a did too, I’d love to use my PS4 controller on my switch, but hopefully in future versions they’ll be Xbox one controller support, because despite having been a Sony and Nintendo fan(and Dade I say it, *Sega* fan) my entire life, the Xbox one controller reigns supreme.
I bought it for $25, still a good deal, so if anyone is in the fence; take the plunge as it really is a good game 
Ah, a man of no culture* no but seriously tetra is pretty awesome 
Obviously. 
Some do, some don’t. 
The fact that you just assumed it was a switch tax without checking shows your ignorance. 
Darth Vader’s cooperation in the death of the emperor is merry mindless rebel propaganda, it was that skywalker terrorist who truly killed him!
Are you defending that Jedi scum yoda?
Why are you buying the game twice? It will literally never get played? And before you say you like seeing the boxes, you can probably just buy a switch physical case online for cheap and print out the cover art. 
And you’re one of those people if you think what Nintendo did was a good idea 
Is this what happens when you gentrify an area? Rebel scum is allowed to move in?
You know that man has got our backs 
I can be your new god 
“I’m slow at a game that’s all about going as fast as possible, so I often lose and blame the game other than change my bad play style, and I’m gonna call it overrated because I’m ruining my own fun in a game”
Yeah, that’s why I stopped jailbreaking years ago, as it slowed down my old iPod and iPhone. The more tweaks I saw, the more I wanted (like modding a video game almost😂) but I realized that the crashing and slowdown of my devices wasnt worth it in the long run to me personally, so I restored everything and it sped up phenomenally. 
You’re not suppose to advocate political ideas on Reddit, unleee it agrees with the hive mentality. Doesn’t matter if you’re conservative or liberal, anything hat goes against Reddit must die in a hail of downvotes. I didn’t downvote you, just thought you needed to know this. 
That’s a very good point you have there.
Is your phone noticeably slower? If not don’t worry about it until you have too, unless you’re trying to get that $29 dollar replacement ( I know you’re Norwegian which is why I bring that up, because I’m pretty sure that’s a U.S. exclusive deal). Don’t waste money until you’re truly annoyed by the slow down, as you might want to maximize your investment. 
I love it, I had a few regrets at first but once I realized that would he $1400+ for apple care and the max space for my iPhone and it would get rid of Touch ID(I don’t like the idea of Face ID personally) and the home button, on top of the notch, I bought he 256 silver 8+. The regrets fizzled away when I actually got my phone in hand, and I knew I had picked the right device. The battery is amazing on this thing and I knew the only thing I cared about was the screen on the x, but the screen alone wasn’t enough to justify the extra bit. So I paid $950 USD and got it with Verizon(without apple care but with the Asurion monthly protection fee of $9) and am glad I have this phone, as it’s so smooth and slick, especially with the apple leather case! All in all OP, get the phone YOU want, as it is your money after all. Best of luck bro, hope it turns out well!

Welcome to Reddit; where people can’t take the questioning of their opinion and go digging through people’s comments to find something g they can attack like a creep
Not really. I agree Siri sucks but both amazon echo and google whatever both struggle to understand basic speech sometimes, so Siri will fit right in. 
I’m not trying to justify this, but to be fair, if you own a BMW, you’re probably not gonna care about $80 a year, and if you do care they just won’t buy the service. My dad has worked with BMW for years as a mechanic, and he gets a lot of work from them, but he knows very well how money sucking they can be, but also how the customers who own bmw’s typically act; arrogantly. They tend not to care and despite buying an expensive car, they cheap out when it gets damaged and opt in for less expensive parts, cheaper paint, but piss money up on features like this then get upset when the used parts don’t have the same kind of shine as newer parts. Most of us in this subreddit don’t even own a BMW, so why are we even worried about it?
Lmfaoo op your salt is hilarious, you’re obviously like 16 and angry at the world for something. Grow up
Ahh, I understand now. And probably not honestly, but I would personally put an otter box over my phone, because there’s a noticeable quality difference between an otter box defender(despite the bulkyness taking away from aesthetics) and a slim piece of silicone. My original post was aimed in that frame of mind; not to be derogatory towards op for having an x, or even a silicone case, just that they put their very expensive phone in a cheap case.
I’ll pick it up, maybe not release day but at some point in the future as I don’t own many games like this, so the $20 price tag, albeit pricey, doesn’t bother me all that much. 
Indeed.
That moment when you get downvotes because they didn’t pick up the reference, I guess they are angry due to their lack of incandescence 
My point is that they’ll drop a thousand dollars on a phone and then buy a cheap case instead of a sturdy one, not that it’s a better built phone. 
“Hey everyone, look I have a cute girlfriend/daughter/family member.”
*buys a $999+ dollar phone and puts in $5 case*🙄
Yeah I think I have that going on with mine too, but I just told myself it was no big deal.
It can’t be done. Apple allows it for x amount of time after the new one releases and you’ve waited too long to download it. There are no jailbreaks readily available that can do this, as jailbreaking as a whole is the dead man of the tech world. It sucks, but that’s how it is, and there is nothing you can do about it. 
Thanks dude!
Edit: that looks wicked!
Because smoking is extremely bad for you? And no matter how you justify doing it(I don’t care that you do) it’s still a health risk and no one at apple wants to read “kids use iPhone app to buy coupons for tobacco related items.” There are people who don’t care if a minor wants to smoke or not and will sell to anyone for the money. Parents will blame apple, not their perfect babies. It’s always someone else’s fault in this world, and you’ve got to pick and choose what minefield you wanna walk through. Upset the parents or those who smoke? That’s an easy choice for many to figure out. 
Hey op, did you do the entire phone or just that one bit? And if you did the entire thing may I see a picture?
I saw a couple of copies in my local Walmart like 2 weeks ago lol.
I swear this game has been rereleased as much as Skyrim, next thing you know it’ll be in Dreamcast and N64. No complaints though 
I guess that makes it better lol 
Dang I want that shirt but I’m all the way over in the U.S.:/
Based off of the one or two things you’ve typed I can tell you’re a fucking douche op
Just because someone doesn’t find the game interesting doesn’t mean it’s them that’s flawed. And I’m not saying snake pass is flawed either, but just that the attitude of “you’re not entitled to your own opinion unless i agree” is silly. 
Yeahhh no
Been a switch owner since launch an I am already tired of all these ports 
You know Reddit is declining in popularity when you take content from a shitty Facebook page 
That’s kind of sad don’t you think? Getting salty over a comment on Reddit and then checking the rest of his comments to vilify him?
[This should answer your question ](http://bfy.tw/Fykw)
Apple can’t do anything about China’s human rights violations, the fuck you talking about?
I haven’t been blue balled this hard since Goku took 17 seasons to transform into Super Saiyan for the first time against Frieza
Ops already said no 
It’s a good game, but nostalgia is what keeps it alive for a lot of people 
Just because you car meta with your crew doesn’t mean it didn’t deserve to be patched. 
I take it you’re a car camper?
Except it takes skill to properly use firearms. And we’re talking about a video game here not real life. 
No, it’s not that easy. If you do something like op it is, but it’s absolutely ridiculous to kill someone in a car even if you shoot through the front windshield of the car, as it typically has no effect. People complain because its a cheap and skill-less way to get kills; just hiding in a car and driving around doesn’t take any skill, just shows that you can hold down a button effectively and steer properly. 
This funniest thing about this post is your vocabulary used. “K Thanks bye” indicates how childish you’re being and the “sorry for bricking your phone” just shows how much of a condescending person you are. Maybe if you acted like a grownup, and not a child crying online, you might’ve made better progress, or would at least have the common sense to call apple instead of bitching on an online forum where no one cares. 
I love my switch and all, but I think you’re just circle jerking now. 
What are you? A child? Why do you feel it necessary to explain to someone why you downvotes them? Just do it and move along. 
I agree, however op is acting like this relatively small bug is the end of the world. This one particular bug isn’t the end of the world. And yes, if his argument was about the state of iOS 11 in general, then my original comment does hold any weight, but if he clarifies and it is about this *specific* bug, then my comment holds true. iOS 11 is a sick joke and apple needs to rectify the situation. 
Oh well, karma isn’t everything. 
Not true. Professionalism is about the exercise of a skill; to show that you not only have the know how to do it right, and are able to handle constructive criticism well and implement it into how you do things in the future. One can work at Walmart and act professional, or do something (whatever that may be, like being an intern) for absolutely no money whatsoever and still be professional, income plays no role. 
While they do look nice, saying they look professionally done is a bit of a stretch. I can see sever blemishes that ultimately aren’t the end of the world, but professionalism is about making sure those aren’t there. 
Lmfao wow, for something so minor you’re gonna return it, it’s a tad bit sad lol. 
You mean birthday, correct?
It was still disconnected. That’s why. It doesn’t matter how long it was disconnected, you still disconnected your service, and are being penalized for it. 
That way of typing looks ridiculously difficult. Why the hell would anyone want to go back to typing like it was 2002 and no screen exists?
What are your feelings on six, out of curiosity
I genuinely do not understand the interest in this game. I played it for awhile but the lack luster combat and embarrassing dialogue scenes. Can someone explain the attraction?
It’s the model of car, it’s a type of slot car. NSR however means bear side front.
Why
This actually a really terrible wallpaper, no offense op
Care to back that up with some sort of source?
That’s not true, I’m in the U.S. and I see internet ads before videos, and I also see a couple here and there in the TV
Thanks man I really appreciate it! I have a MacBook Pro as well and I love it, it truly is an amazing experience and ecosystem. 
I got myself an Apple Watch,loving it so far. You liking your MacBook?
Either brawl out or sonic mania. How about yourself?
Ah alrighty thanks 
Enlist now to protect the glorious Christmas holidays of the empire from those wretched rebel scum! merry Christmas to all xx
Human resource machine. Just didn't care for it in the slightest.
Enjoy.
Just wanted to quickly drop in and say how thankful I am to have such an awesome developer and great app at my reach to use for reddit. This is the only real problem I've run into but I know it'll get fixed, as Apollo is the number one reediting app for good reason!
I think you’re just overthinking this games ending. 
I guess the whole $25 or less went straight over your head. 
Sorry I thought you were just trying to trick people into making emergency calls.
How does one go about unlocking new characters and stages? I googled it online but found nothing helpful, only that the locked ones are not in the game yet, is that true?
I have always wanted to visit Stralia’.
There’s already one large thread on it, so you can go ahead and stop reposting for free upvotes. 
Dang it, I knew something wasn’t quite right. 
Another fabulous moment from earlier today:
http://xboxdvr.com/gamer/CloudTheSavior/video/41298968
Is it bad that I’m a 22 year old male that would actually pay to have some joy cons like this?😂
Yessir 
Of course. I took it at the Memphis zoo back in June of this year. https://imgur.com/a/Y11Hv/ 
Obviously a new feature of iOS 11.
I mean this is why I’m not okay with drones, if apple wanted to public seeing what’s inside, they would have let us come in. Drone usage like this is pretty much spying, and if one flew over my home I’d shoot it down.
Indeed I did, how could I forget the great land of kiwis? New Zealand can be added to the group of course. 
That awkward moment when dirty nonamericans have to use insults and talk down to another country because of their inferiority complex.  Asia=filled with mass poverty, human rights violations and communism. Europe=despite having a long and proud culture, they have weakened themselves to pretend that Muslim cultures are flawless (not saying they’re bad for the most part) and are bending over backwards and exposing themselves to a culture that would rather not conform, thus forcing the Europeans to conform and those who resist get run over, gunned downed are blown up in a subway station. Africa=terrorism and slavery is rampant, with backwards and outdated ways, forcing other countries to give them free money to continue existing, the same applies to the Middle East. South America is filled with socialist regimes and mass starvation and corrupt government regimes, resistance to a ban on farting in public leads to being shot in the middle of the street like it’s the  tiananmen  square massacre every day. So there’s only three countries worth a shit, the USA, Canada, and Australia. 
This comment doesn’t really make much sense without context, which there isn’t any of. 
Vivé la Revolution!
We give a fuck, we’ve seen too many of these posts as it is, and we’re tired of low quality posts. That is not an excuse for you to be rude and tell someone to unsubscribed.
YEET
That’s actually amazing😂keep up the good work!
Too poor to have one? Or are you a “peecee mastah raceee” type of pleb who brags about how good PCs are despite your potato only achieving a max frame rate of 12 per hour?
We can only hope. What if they don’t put him in but reference him or put in an Easter egg about him?😂
This comment thread, holy shit. Everyone’s praising this boy (which he should get) and using it as an excuse to criticize others on how they may or may not  donate, yet I bet they don’t either. “But it’s different because *I* can’t afford it, but it’s perfectly acceptable to criticize others for not doing so, and dismissing their actual contributions!” Reddit is filled with blade-less white knights who always knows best. 
It ceases to be art when you use it to massacre millions of people. 
The difference here is that a lot more people have accepted porn and normal, especially at a young age. Whereas likening to nazi ideals is entirely unacceptable. It’s about what people as a whole perceive. 
Yeah, I’m gonna have to call that a lie, because it happened a lot before I left too
A terrible shit hole with hate being spread everywhere, shitposting at an all time high, and pirates who have no respect for authors and their hard work and properties? Thank god we have it like that!🙄
Those are all shitty reasons. This game has seemingly gone down the drain since I’ve last played. 
When you’re as into it as OP, it’s past *just an interest* it’s full blown obsession. He proves that he knows it’s wrong when he turns his monitor off to try and hide the fact that he was listening to the marching songs from his parents. This shows he knows that what he’s doing is wrong in some manner, yet he continues on with it anyway. 
At least your notifications center works :/
They’re nice little cues as to what changed, and you can’t make everyone happy. So many developers choose to share nothing(Twitter, facebook, etc) they it’s nice that someone overstates for once. And the majority of people are just going to install anyway without reading it regardless of how long it is.
No he died because as smart of a man as he was, he was too stupid to take the help of doctors when he needed it, preferring to think that he was always right.
Yay for more remasters! God forbid I get new and original IPs on my $500 gaming box🙄
I don’t think it’s possible for it to just delete something by itself, it has to be manually told that is has to factory reset. Perhaps someone messed with it and accidentally reset it?
Perhaps they did and did not find an answer, there’s really no knowing whether OP did or did not
Lmfao I understand. But you gotta remember that others feel the same way about their flags and a good patriot doesn’t make other patriots feel bad.

That’s so fucking awesome dude
That is not very patriotic of you
Nice👍 
Yes!! Took it when I had an iPhone 7
I..don’t understand the comparison you’re trying to make😬
Doesn’t sound dumb at all. It does make sense that if you have an older phone people might *percive* that you aren’t pulling in enough funds to afford the newest and greatest, but then again most people don’t. Thanks for your input. 
You don’t. Or at least I don’t, but that’s the point. I spend an extra~$150USD and quadruple my storage and it becomes essentially a nonissue for at least now, no telling in the future though. So I guess part of it is future proofing as the size of things are increasing astronomically overtime. 
Tried it, didn’t work, but rebooting did the trick. Appreciate the response though, thank you.
I took it at the Memphis Zoo, https://imgur.com/a/qCyxQ/
Except they had a couple of kings after the French Revolution, and an emperor or two
Smart play, sheriff.
Who cares really? It’s not hurting anyone.
Heh, must be nice lol
Understandable:P
Makes sense, thanks for the input
I’m glad you have a phone you like op, but why do people spend so much every year on a new phone? I got an 8+ and I don’t want to upgrade for at least 3 years of ownership, if not longer.  Not trying to put anyone down just genuinely curious.
Sounds like you’ve already convinced yourself that you want the Swedish one. Forgive my ignorance, but is 500sek a noticeable difference? Is a it a big enough difference to know that if you run into any problems with the Malaysian one it’ll be a much larger headache than a domestic one?
Edit: just had Siri convert it, it would seem that you’re saving roughly $50 to buy it in Malaysia, and to me I’d just buy the Swedish one. But that’s just me and I don’t know anything about Swedish purchasing power of your country’s currency. So I personally would just get the Swedish one, but alas, it is ultimately your money and your choice.  
Where do I go to purchase one? The website doesn’t list a price. 
They’re sold out online and in store where I live😭even the apple store I went too yesterday to get my Watch didn’t have any! Oh well I guess I’ll have to be patient lol
I’m in love with it! I also love how in it feels with the Aubergine leather case I have on it, as it makes it feel so smooth and lovely. Which color did you get?
Not to bum you out, but I believe it comes out on the 19th
I thought that said “use car wash” and was about too recommend to OP to reconsider your advice lol. I need sleep
OP: “DAE KNOW IF THIS WELL KNOWN PRE-PROGRAMMED GIGGLE??
Us: yeah dude that’s old news
“Clicking any video...” *proceeds to only click one* 
Just empty your cache via settings and delete your browsing history and you should be good lol
Yeah I can understand too, but what makes it weird for me is liking all of this, despite knowing his grandparents fought back against *literal oppression and tyranny* and still looks at the very content that made up nazi ideals
I remember in August of 2016 my state got hit with a massive flood and they gave out free data as half of Louisiana was put into a state of emergency, and Verizon took on the bill themselves, and was the only cell service that worked for over a week at least. Needless to say I became very important and liked in that week. The data was wonky at times as a flood did occur. But that being said I know data is cheap but I still appreciated the gesture, and Verizon earned a customer for life with that move. 
Congratulations to all my euro buddies across the ocean finally getting wooo!🇫🇷🇬🇧🇩🇪
Accidental double post I see! Lol
Yeah I laughed at it too, I was like I understand where hes coming fr-what the fuckkk
Settings->general—restrictions
If that doesn’t work op, they will have to go to both the safari and camera roll apps ->settings ->whatever app he needs and then activate it from there
You’re on an android app, there fore your comment has no value for OP, it doesn’t change the fact that OP’s gf has no issues while he does not. Not trying to be rude but reddit official on android ≠ official iPhone app. 
Considering standby mode uses next to no power, that’s not really impressive in the slightest, battery life is actually terrible. 
Most likely so. Also it would appear I was wrong and that you can get one for that cheap, I was just mistaken. 
It was more a response for people commending something that really isn’t all that commendable. Saying “good job for actually releasing games on time” is like thanking your local grocery store for having food; it’s their job, they have to do it or they don’t make much profit.
And I’m a neuroscientist who cured all cancers, just because you say something online doesn’t exactly make it true, not saying you’re lying but why are you trying to convince a stranger online that you could do a better job? Why do you care what I think?
Keyword being rumors, and rumors ought to be taken like a grain of salt unless you wanna end up disappointed.
Ah my bad, didn’t know that.😬
Exactly my point, I love achievements and trophies, they simply help extend the life of a game that would otherwise just gather dust if they didn’t have them. 
First off, i didn’t say I only play for achievements, second off they add more reasons for me to keep playing past one play through, third of all, you have no right to tell people what makes a game good or bad. Just because you’re bitter and angry does not mean you can’t take it out on strangers online, and I’m sorry if there’s something in your life that makes you an angry person but being bitter won’t change that, I truly hope you learn to relax and enjoy life, if not you’re in for a tough ride friend.  
He said fun, but boring and redundant, finding those little bastards brings me no joy, especially since there is no achievement system/trophy system like on Xbox, steam, and PlayStation. 
I mean what would we have had to play if Zelda didn’t launch in time? They kinda had too because there was nothing else that would make it a system seller, and it would not have taken off as much as it has without all the great games that came out many months later that were also not delayed. 
I swear at least once a week I have like 26 updates, and it’s always the same apps too. Is that normal?
Try Craig’s list, eBay, or another used items site. Best Buy might have some used ones that have been refurbished, but I doubt you’ll get a new iPad for that price. 
You’re fighting a winless battle here man, retreat while you can lol
Didn’t even think of it that way, thanks for the added knowledge
Do I need a consent form, mr pc principal, or is word of mouth acceptable enough?
Much obliged, for I am too lazy to google it myself 
Didn’t even think for it that way, just thought about from the profitability aspect🤔thanks for the added input 
Yet you probably couldn’t do it any better
I know it doesn’t mean anything, but here’s an sympathetic upvote. 
Put those fingers to work then! Put flight mode o, if it shuts down than you can change the date when it comes back on, google the steps if you’re not sure how to do it exactly(as time is of the essence, so maybe watch a YouTube video on how to change the date so you don’t waste anytime) and then if it shuts a second time when it boots up update it! Or just update it via iTunes, that seems a lot easier lol
Because he has the impulse to let everyone else around him know, for whatever self gratifying feeling that he gets from being a jerk online. 
You’re a true connoisseur OP
You haven’t dropped it yet, people as a species are flawed, we all make mistakes. Sometimes it’s dropping a phone and sometimes it’s almost conquering the entirety of Europe, you know it varies a little between people. 
Try and submit a refund through apple by calling them. 
Not at all. People were using them to block in app ads which cut into their ad revenue, which one could argue as unethical but then again if you’re using a free service and block ads(which I do on my MacBook Pro mind you) then we are just as unethical you know?
Apple pretty much murdered all the ad blockers earlier this year, so there’s really no point in paying for an app that doesn’t do any better than the free ones that are available. 
Probably aluminum because it’s one of the cheaper metals 
That’s kinda rude
I completely understand OP, it snowed today in Louisiana for the first time in like 9 or 10 years, when its normally ungodly hot here for most of the year! It’s a neat experience righttt up to the point where people don’t realize that they don’t know how to drive in snow and crash their car, or almost do so. It also feels magical to walk around in the snow seeing everything covered in it until ten minutes later you realize that bitter cold feeling kicks in on your fingers, toes and ears. 
The developer has to eat somehow 
You can slow down your phone with too many things being installed?(I did that). You can become obsessed with tinkering and adding new “features” and customizations, spending more time looking for those than any other feature if the phone. It’s like having mods on games, once you start you can’t really stop. I’m not trying to be argumentative but jail breaking does have its drawbacks and you asked lol
Well it’s to not cover up the speakers. But I understand where you’re coming from. 
“Are you surprised that we lied about the cookies?”
We have gone full circle as a species😂
Them gengars tho 
Ranting about the damn truth lol. Preach!
Maybe it’s not as big a problem, that’s definitely a good question that apple should answer to cure my curiosity. 
Yeah, reddit is terrible for news, especially when it comes to political stuff, as it tends to only show leftist policies( or saying that’s bad if you’re interested) but it’s definitely not balanced well at all.
It is, has been for ages, it’s just that apple doesn’t let it happen for a month or so to prevent people from buying all the unlocked ones and putting them up online for inflated prices. 
That’s brilliant 😂
It’s time to purge it with a clean install then
They’re not going to return something because you weren’t paying attention to what you were doing and ruined the case yourself. 
“I put it down to price, since it’s an awesome game after patch.” Does that not come off as wonky? I mean, if it needs a patch to be awesome it’s probably because it was broken/messed up when it launched. The price I doubt played a factor, but if it’s only good after a patch that’s probably the main reason it sold bad. 
Then go play the Xbox version? 
Funny, because I’m actually using my study break from finals to jerk off lol
President Jackson was president in the late 1820’ and early 1830’s...
How’s life in Macon, pal?  You called me a poor pleb yet you could only afford a $2 case for your $1,000 phone:)
You live a sad little life don’t you? Nothing better to do while unemployed eh?
Perhaps those earliest peaks about an iPhone X plus may have had some weight to them after all🤔
So you believe that stuff for an unannounced product is legitimate?
Obviously just a scam site
Low quality post. 
The only thing funny in here is that they own mustangs 
Okay. Someone bleached the stone daily. That’s not true but I’m glad I could lie to you. 
Except that if you look it up,they’re both produced by the same companies that own the, in the same town of Hamilton in Canada.  
You truly are a dense and condescending cunt, and you deserve the miserable life you are obviously living. 
That you’re an asshole to strangers online with little to no respect for people who do things differently than you?
Question mark or quest.🤔
I swear,everything on this site just HAS to become political and a shame fest. If people actually did something, maybe it would be different, but instead you’d rather pretend that you’re infinitely wise and complain on Reddit about it, rather than vote for people who would try to make a difference. This website likes to pretend it has some sort of arbitrary intelligence when really the average intelligence is that of your typical Facebook user. 
This is for UK users only people 
Ultimately, it’s his money, and he can do with it what he pleases. Sad for sure, but that’s just how it is. 
We can’t allow exceptions, because if we do, then more people will follow suit and begin to post them here and more often. So if we don’t budge now, we won’t have to deal with spam later. 
Not trying to be a bummer but I’m pretty sure you’re not supposed to post photos in this subreddit that have been shot with an iPhone. There are subreddits dedicated to it like /r/iPhoneography
That definitely sucks, and it seems like that’s all you really can do, good luck with it👍🏼
If people want a product enough and can afford it, then it will sell well. However that doesn’t change the fact that it will lock out some users
Have you tried speaking to Verizon about it? Or did you just hop on here to ask about it?
That’s down to apple my dude 
That’s pretty cool actually 
I don’t think you can rent a film and not pay can you?
You’re full of it. Even if it happened “allegedly” at your store, that would never fly on a corporate level. Just because of one bad experience you’re going to go around being a cynical and bitter jerk to random strangers?
Well iPods aren’t connected to the internet 24/7 like iPhones, so it’s less of a big deal I guess *shrugs*
To think, if we lose net neutrality here in the U.S. I would have to PAY to see such low tier shit posts like this one 
As nice as it seems, that’s such an ugly color to use. 
That’s one way of saying you don’t know
https://i.imgur.com/iJCBVzv.jpg they do have something built in
I see in my absence the subreddit has become totally meta
You’re so beta op 
Fire emblem warriors, D5, arms and human resource machine. The last one doesn’t really make much sense and doesn’t explain a whole lot, fire emblem warriors is kinda of boring and stagnate in terms of gameplay, arms is one of those games you need a buddy to play with but I’m just not into fighting games I guess and disgaea is just too out there. 
You’re going to get permission correct? I mean you could make it worse 
It still works with the pop thing on it, watched my friend do it earlier with his;P
Are you serious? This is one of humanities most we’ll know photos and you’re too lazy to just google it?
Are you German OP? Or did you just go to Berlin as a vacation thing?
Then I wouldn’t pay too much attention to it being a demo unit, if everything works fine, then there’s really no issue right?
Well that’s not entirely true, I think Catholicism has that beat
Definitely. It was also packed to the brim with courage 
Does your phone work alright op?
I typically wear down the battery everyday iPhone 8+, and charge it over night once my iPad is done
I just toss my boxes into my closet op. Glad you’re liking your collection though!
Except cars cost way more. But if someone wants to buy a Lamborghini and put a sticker on it( or have it wrapped) they can, because the company that designed them doesn’t care what you do to your product. 
Not like he could’ve made a bad choice, they’re both beautiful phones
What color/storage?😬
Which one did you get OP?
Are you going to contribute anything or purpose here? Or no?
Are you retarded? People do things differently in other countries, no need to be rude online.
Because it’s better than pretty much every other Reddit app? It is an iOS exclusive app and we are on reddit, more specifically the iPhone subreddit... so yeah it’s gonna get a lot of praise.
You’re just sounding like a fan boy now. This isn’t “making more sense” it’s being stupid so people don’t bitch. Apple thinks they now everything and will always know better than the people who buy their products (like myself)
People who make these comments tend to be the biggest wimps out there. 
You’re fun. 
I don’t care what you think, but I like being a dick to dicks online so that explains my original comment, any further questions?
It is actually normal, it’s called veining my dude 
A thousand dollar phone can’t work when it’s cold? What the hell apple
No one cares what you think
‘‘Tis true friend 
That’s totally your choice man, and I can respect that. 
Oh I have it, I was just saying some people may or may not have it/afford it.
Gives off a hotline Miami vibe
People without unlimited data plans probably. 
Vegetarians don’t eat animals whatsoever but still eat seafood and eggs, while vegans do not eat anything with any animal products whatsoever. 
How would we know? Do you google search stuff before hand or do you immediately just hop on reddit?
Here you go, a link for an explanation on what all it does: http://bfy.tw/Etue
How dare OP spend their money how they see fit!
Oh no if it's a problem then I agree 100% with you there, Apple needs to speak up 
Thanks dude I appreciate it. 
Edit: they don’t make these for plus models do they?
Thanks man
Doesn’t seem to be the case with me🤔
Yeah I’m the same way
He has an iPhone in his hand -_-
What exactly do you mean by that? Like I get it partially, like easier on the eyes?
OP, just remember one thing: people can judge you but ultimately it is your money and your enjoyment. If they want to be snitty about it, let them, but if you truly enjoy the product and can live with parting with those funds, then keep it. If not return it. Your life, your enjoyment, and your money is the only deciding factors here and that’s all that matters. 
That’s because he’s got his priorities in order
I don’t know if this helps much dude, but it sure looks sexy as fuck though
Edit 1: Ps, where’d you get that case?
Looks fantastic on my 8+
That’s exactly my point, there are people who hate the idea of having to shop there so there where always be competition for Walmart, and it might not always be target but you get the point. 
Right, it’s like they were trying to antagonize people on purpose!
Why does the phone appear to be curved in this video? I know it’s not but can anyone explain that to me? Also, reminds of that one phrase in Skyrim with the whiterun guards “You see those warriors from Hammerfell? They’ve got curved swords. Curved. Swords.”
No. They're made to only work on Virgin mobile. And we all know it's actually your own phone you're inquiring about. 
The fuck are you talking about? Multiple companies exist, all giving individual both, there is no committed who comes together  which game wins goty
While I appreciate the offer, I'm just glad I was able to entertain someone 
Also saw this on Twitter, it's not much better. 
That won't happen as long as people refuse to shop at Walmart 
Multiple games can win goty
I take it you’re a Democrat? Time to wake up and acknowledge the real world buddy, both political parties are filled with corruption and both are shitty. Stop pretending it’s just republicans who don’t give a fuck.
Tears apart new phone that costs $1,000 dollars only to film the process with a potato🙄
I’m in the same boat brother 
Those finger prints tho
Is exploding an unannounced feature of the iPhone X? Neat-o. 
Was expected to be here on the 3rd, but came today!
Is that a bird, a plane, Superman? No it’s just the joke that went straight over my head🙃
*British accent* : Introducing the new iPhone, now with both courage and character, all in one package, and designed with care and thought with the public in mind.”
Don’t really care for Face ID, but damn that’s actually pretty cool
Would you kindly stop correcting people online of little stuff? Thanks babe. 
It would appear in my haste that I misinterpreted the intent of this post completely. Oops my bad op
We’re getting to dick measuring sizes with these ridiculous names
I hope so, not because I want one in particular, but because a lot of people love the SE and want an updated version. 
I’d buy it op, it looks nice. 
I suppose everyone has to try and justify their purchases somehow, it’s a shame too that people can’t be satisfied with what they bought, instead of seeking validation from others online. 
What’s life like being such a bitter and angry cunt? I’m not telling you which store I’m at, just because you’re wrong doesn’t mean I’m lying. Choose what you want to belief, I don’t don’t really care if you believe me or not.
You’re I the wrong subreddit. And that implies that people can actually get a switch in their hands 
The Walmart I worked at out both battlefield and call of duty on sale for $45 dollars last Black Friday, so can you kindly stop being an ass online??
I find it amusing that so many redditors jab at how people don’t think outside of the box, yet neither do they. Redditors are just as bad as Facebook at this point 
I think you’re remembering things wrong dude 
He’s obviously retarded lol
My point is that the music in the background feature was never part of the OG YouTube app:P
But you couldn’t play it once you left the app, as the video would pause
This is why I like you guys; you all get bored and find random bullshit that no one else would, bravo guys, love y’all😂❤️
Says the guy coming on the iPhone reddit to post bullshit
He put them into freedom right where they belonged after his death, not many slave owners did that. 
I know that feel I was like this all week after I ordered my 8+, and am currently going through it right now waiting on my Gold Ipad!😫
Is there an Apollo app for iPad? Getting my iPad come Thursday and I’m super stoked!
Probably because she honesty belongs in prison. if we had done the shit she pulled with the emails, we'd be locked away for life, never to see the light of day again. Just because she served the country, does not put her above the law. But then again liberals say they belief in equal justice until its someone they support in danger of facing the consequences of their actions.
She isn't one, but you liberals are still obsessed with her, and can't admit that the country never wanted her, not in 2008, or 2016.


Thanks dude, I appreciate your response, and yeah that was the plan. I’m hoping this game makes me love it, I really want to!
In other news, liberals don’t like it when the press shit on their candidate, who would’ve thought?
Fucks sake at this point it’ll look like a line of clothing rather than a tech company😂
Thanks dude, I keep giving it more time as I really want to I enjoy this game, but am having a hard time with that. Maybe once I visit a few more worlds I’ll love it. Thanks for your contribution.  +1
Which parts do you disagree with? You’re not exactly making this conversation thing easy. 
A powerful dovakiin indeed
I’ll be honest, I’ve played this game a few hours now(3 or so) and it’s kinda meh to me, which makes me sad because I was actually really looking forward to it. It’s kinda fun don’t get me wrong, but it doesn’t seem that much of a change from the other MARIO 3D platformers. The worlds are kinda small, the story seems lackluster(I know it’s Mario), I honestly prefer Mario kart over this. It’s not the pivotal game a lot of people seem to be acting like it is.
That doesn’t exactly justify coming online and acting like a child. If you have a problem, call apple. We can’t fix it, so why come make us listen to your problems. We don’t mind if you’re polite, but this is past ridiculous.
That is such as childish comment to make. “I can’t figure out a solution to my problem so instead of calling apple and asking for help I’m going to throw a temper tantrum online.”
Woosh
When you’re trying to avoid spoilers and any information around the game but see this when headed to school in the early morning -_-https://i.imgur.com/b5g9FnC.jpg
Shhh, none of that. We can have any voices of reason on this fine website of ours 
Look at app that salt, goddamn 
See, that’s a reasonable answer. I agree that we can’t show leniency but at the same time, there aren’t many companies out there that aren’t trying(or even already doing) what they pulled. This is he norm now and we all buy products form at least one company that does it. I’m just saying that we can’t personally attack people who’s publisher forced them to ignore bugs in order to place micro transactions. They weren’t the ones calling the shots, their old publishers were.
Yep, they’ve merely become pawns and don’t even see it.
This isn’t aimed at the content of this post but I’ve  noticed that this subreddit is hopelessly devoted to leftist policies. 
No it’s still a discount, just not for you. And that’s what you seem to making this about, you and your opinion being right vs what is actually correct. 
They’ve clearly learned their lesson. But then again you can’t really expect a reasonable voice to come from a gaming community, as they want to be pissed off, even if it’s petty things from the past. 
How many times are they gonna rerelease this game? I bet they’ll charge $60 too.
I actually laughed out loud, kudos op👏🏻
Honest question: why’s that in English? None of those are native English speaking countries, I’m not trying to be an ass just genuinely curious. 
Pretty generic comment ya got goin’ on there pal 
That’s just reddit in general 
It’s fixed everything wrong with yours, heard from friends on it that they still have problems with battery life, amongst other bugs. Just because someone questions you does not mean you need to jump down their throat. 
Do you not have a phone you can borrow (like from a friend or family member) to call Verizon? If not why not try to download one of those phone caller apps, and call them from that?
I sincerely doubt that
Which city is this?
I swear OP, you’re a pretty cool cat
Dear diary, today OP was actually pretty cool
Make sure you get a 4K Tv with HDR as a feature, this will easily double the price of the TV, but it’s worth it. 4K and 4K + HDR are two entirely different ball games. Having the latter also future proofs the tv much more than having a regular 4K tv  
Just get someone to imitate his voice. People have been doing it in animated shows for forever, think of how many shaggys there have been across all of scooby doo.
You must really like negative karma. Just shut up already and delete the post
Morganlovestacos, let’s do this bro
It looks interest that’s for sure. Thanks for your input. 
Yeah I want to get it eventually. Any quick tips?
Good shit op! Congratulations truly man, that must’ve taken a good deal of time. 
I appreciate the response, and I’m glad you’re excited for it!
This is a genuine question: how is this not just a reskin if hyrule warriors?
Who cares at this point? Presequel was an absolute let down, and a large chunk of the team behind BL2 is gone, so it’ll probably come out as another andromeda 
That is a terrible piece of advice, he’ll just log back on later to find out that it hasn’t been downloading. 
Yeah the people in this subreddit is as toxic as /r/gaming, my recommendation is to just leave the subreddit. A lot of people here are very bitter, angry and take it out on new comers. I’m about to unsubscribe again
I take it your education is very limited?
It’s called flair, it’s a thing that you set up in each individual subreddit. 
To be fair, most games don’t require a specialty chip/cartridge to play their game. They require blu ray discs 
Really? I might actually get this game then🤔
“Lay it on me brother” you’re not a pro wrestler, and I am not your brother, learn to speak to others with respect and you may get a proper response.
Quite a few actually. And you repeating yourself isn’t adding any kind of emphasis.
Yeah but the difference is that Sony actually has a proper online structure, regardless of whether someone likes it or not. Nintendo does not, so you’ll basically be paying $20 (starting next year, free for now) a year and the game will be abandoned online with a couple of matches here and there in a matter of months. As the library expands, there will be more choice and the community will splinter 
Do I need to play the first to enjoy this game?
Several of these are either not available in US, or aren’t free like specified. 
Everything you do on your phone affects battery life, but you won’t squeeze out an extra half hour of battery life  by disabling it if that’s what you mean. 
Or literally any western country for that matter 
But they aren’t true nazis, they aren’t organizing militaries and hunting people down attempting to kill all the Jews. They may be racist, but ultimately that just shows us that we need to avoid them, and that they aren’t worth mingling/speaking too. Your devotion to the left is going to be your downfall. They are worthless pieces of shit, but violence toward anyone should always be looked down upon, regardless how they act or speak.
 (´･Ω･`) 
Freedom of speech. And if they are killing people, let the justice system handle it. You’re just making half assed claims and bias now. 
Oh look, it’s the devs who released new Vegas when it was virtually unplayable due the amount of bugs!
This is probably one of the truest comments I’ve ever seen on this website 
Neat-o
If the nfl wanted to shut it down, or at least if the coaches wanted too, it can be shut down. The bill of rights are political rights that the government can’t shut down, other people can. Like if I told you to shut  up after you said your opinion out loud, that’s not me abridging your rights. Plus, football players are merely actors, they’re paid to play a game, not advocate their opinions.
I agree, OP needs to contain himself and his ethnocentric ways.
You’re completely right, my 128 GB cost me $39.99 at Walmart.
Yeah I totally get that bro, thanks for the insight. 
That’s how I am on games, one of my buddies is the kind of person that once he sees a game he’s hyped for, he checks every thirty seconds for new information. I don’t understand why, look at enough to see if you’re interested, then if you are, get it, don’t ruin secrets and such.
That looks absolutely sexy op, good work!
That way they can rip you off $80!
America’s obesity is merely an example of how much freedom we have. Oh and we’re the greatest because we can kick anyone’s ass militarily* and give no fucks what others think.  



*vietnam not included in this package 
We? You’re the only one complaining. 
How dare they make the game they want it, and not conform to using cheap and overpriced chips instead of disks
No reddit, this doesn’t mean that you’re intelligent due to your depression. You’re like everyone else in the world, still stupid and your depression is probably self diagnosed.
BaconReader for lyfe
Psn doesn’t charge for updates I believe, so it doesn’t cost them anything to update the game(besides paying people to make the updates of course).
How does one do this again?
It’s rough and course and it gets everywhere 
That’s honestly kind of ugly
I wonder how many people will buythe 8/8+ due to not being able to get ahold of the x🤔
Works like a charm for me. In fact, until iOS 11, it worked a little too good.
You’ll be fine bro, i was just jabbing at ya. If it really bothers you that much, just change your password and you’ll be fine. Apples security is known for being very strong. Except for the iCloud hack awhile back anyway.
He’s screwing with you, you actually do need to delete everything, might even have factory reset your phone to make sure everything’s alright. 
There is a certain amount of storage the phone needs to keep running smoothly. So yes, you have 4 GB left, but no, you cannot use it all because most electronics keep x amount of space available so the phone can properly function, so how much space you have left is right. I don’t know what the amount apple requires you to keep is either. 
That’s fine, I just so t be upgrading after having the iPhone 8+. I’ll keep this phone until it dies.
And you’re a loser for getting salty online over bullshit. 
I can in fact, I just don’t want it.
You say that as you get pissy online at a stranger for insulting your product. If you weren’t a loser you wouldn’t care about a strangers opinion. So I guess we’re both “fucking losers.”
They’re the real mvp
To have salt added to the subreddit. 
Still better than being outdated before it launches, like the X already is 😂
Not in the slightest. Enjoy your outdated phone. 
Here man! It drove me crazy when I wanted to know so I created a comprehensive list for everyone!

“Perhaps most importantly, Nintendo's demonstrating an ability to adapt - to listen to its fans and respond. It may sound small, but it's a crucial change for a company notorious for being tight-lipped.” Except when it comes to proper online or wanting to have an easy way of playing with friends online without a separate smartphone download, of course.
I swear people do this poll every day, sheesh 
You can actually. Assuming that someone from x place, is x way, regardless of scenario is prejudice. I don’t assume all Muslims are terrorists, or that all Irish are drunks, so why should he/she jump and make conclusions.
But it’s a solution  /s
But I. All seriousness I don’t believe you can currently

I’m with you op, I’m a switch-ps4 man myself, I get all the kick ass AAA mature games I want on PS4, plus it’s exclusives, and indie games and Nintendo exclusives on my switch. Had an Xbox, but not many of their exclusives actually came out well(either got canceled or they just came out bad). So I’m loving it
Oh boy let me just answer your question with little to no information whatsoever! Thank god for the included error code! Oh sweet, you say that you tried turning it completely off and back on and it didn’t work?!! Oh boy thank god. Seriously dude, how are we supposed to help you?

The Las Vegas shooter
Oblivion, elder scrolls online and honestly right now? Destiny 2. I’m not proud of it, nor ashamed lol
What most of you are complaining about, I’m actually glad they changed. This game to me, is 100% better than destiny 1.
Don’t set yourself up for disappointment my friend. 
Not trying to be hateful, honestly, but how is undertale good? It just seems kind of empty and boring, and I’ve played through to the end, but can’t force myself to play it anymore. 
I see you have a mastery of the English language.
Nah, I’d rather stay on my self destructive path due to the fact that I fear the unknown(even if it would turn out to be better) and despite my depression and anxiety having crippling effects on my life, I’d still rather stay on my current path due to the vague familiarity it offers me. It may be small, but it’s enough to keep me going. 
Could it be that it was due to lack of games at the time?
Who’s your provider OP?
Posting the same three or four questions, albeit slightly modified, in ask reddit every goddamn day
I feel ya OP. The other week I was feeling down in the dumps and was on the verge of tossing out all gaming related stuff, my ps4, 4K HDR tv, switch, ps2, etc. and then I bought dragon ball xenoverse 2 on the switch (didn’t care much for the first) and it reignited my flames for gaming. 
I’d imagine not due to it’s thickness. 
Post as many as you want..you won’t here me complaining
Looks phenomenal! Can I use this as a wallpaper for my phone?
“DAE like ocarina of time???” Really OP? Really?
Ohhh okay thanks dude. I just love little quirky facts about other countries is all
Oprah Winfrey is the x  (´･ω･`) 
What’s 3DK?
Serious question: why? I don’t understand it’s appeal. It’s fun for like 30 minutes at a time, but nothing draws me in.
It might not be huge, but it’s definitely a noticeable downgrade. At the end of the day though, graphics aren’t everything, especially when you can take the game literally wherever you want. 
I enjoyed it. It was fun but fuck I wouldn’t recommend it to other people. Shits hard and infuriating to beat. I beat the game and all the dlc and couldn’t wait for it to be over once I started the poison dude 
I’ll be honest, splatoon is fun, but there’s nothing drawing me back to it. Not enough stuff in the game to bring me back.
Not if you shoot it and walk away. Then you won’t see it’s tracks anymore. 
Just because it was different in your case doesn’t change the over arching narrative. 
Google also lacks any personality whatsoever, and that’s kind of important for a personal assistant 
That shouldn’t matter too much, my moms 5S was still on iOS 10 when I transferred her stuff to my 7(I upgraded and got my 8+)
Dearest villains from events that he is not familiar with. My buddy had never seen dragon ball z at all and he was lost as hell with xenoverse, so after awhile he quit. You’ve obviously seen most if not all of it. You’ve got the hindsight, so it doesn’t bother you.

Sorry dude, but i don’t think you realize how nerfed the versions of Wolfenstein and doom will be compared to the Xbox and ps4 version. Don’t get me wrong, the switch has a good deal of power that comes with it, but it’s not going to have the frame rate or the graphics of the other consoles. We’re essentially trading graphics and frame rate for portability, and I’m okay with that. So when a game, especially from a terrible corporation like capcom(who hasn’t really made a new IP that’s stuck in almost 2 decades) doesn’t let their games come over and actually mock us and our consoles, I don’t really care. Fuck em’
Because I wanted too? Didn’t realize that I, a grown man with my own money, had to explain myself to anyone. 
No he’ll just be incredibly lost and not understand what exactly is going on. He might like it but if he wants to enjoy the game to the fullest, he’s gotta know what’s going on. 
*gasp* how dare people share their opinions and contribute to conversations! And how dare people care about frame rate! Look I get it, if people are only obsessed with graphics, it’s kind of wrong to do. But if people obsess over frame rate it’s kind of needed as it’s an indication of how well a game plays. 30 FPS is not the best but any means, and ultimately should be the bare bones minimum for any game. 60 FPS just plays nicer, and I know a lot of people do not like hearing the switch get criticized. But at the end of the day, it’s not like we’ve got the Normandy when it comes to console flagships, as every system has their pros and cons. It’s just that we have switch’s and they are not as powerful as other things so we have to have compromises in terms of power and stability. LA noire running on the switch is fun and cool, but at the end of the day it’s still six years old. But we can play it on the go. That’s just how things are. 
That sounds like something a kid would say lmfao
Really? Because it runs fantastically on my ps4 pro
Yup. You’re a kid. 
They weren’t “ugly” as you keep saying as they were actually quite amazing at the time of release, especially for a handheld. I take it you’re a kid?
When’s this game come out?
Yes, but the other games aren’t remastered of 15-20 year old games now are they?
Hey don’t look ugly at all, they just look a bit dated, as OoT did get remastered six years ago, and majoras mask two years ago. And btw, graphics aren’t everything
You would, but not a lot of people in the grand scheme of things would. If they put ocarina+ majoras mask together and sell it for like $50-$60 together, then put windwaker HD and twilight princess HD together and sold those separately for $60, they would sell like hot cakes. If they put them as separate downfalls files on the eshop and sold them for $30 a pop that would be perfect. Then you could pick and choose which ones you do or do not want to buy, and mix the combinations together.
Probably not. You might have fun but it doesn’t explain the events at all. It kind of expects you to be a fan of the franchise and anime.
Thought this was for FIFA 18, thought to myself “fuck,” and realized I had misread. Sorry to hear that to all of you guys who enjoy this series/game feel like they’re jerking you around, seems like they don’t really care for their dedicated fans😞
Preordered and paid this game off yesterday! Any tips for people that have never played a FIFA game before? And and all comments would be appreciated.
I sincerely doubt that any of that has any real truth to it. Most girls who strip most likely make quite a bit of money, but for what? A few years until their boobs start to sag and then what? What do they do after the fact? What happens when a younger and prettier girl comes along and the previous one gets ousted? It’s not like they’re going to have massive savings to bounce back on.
It’s not about what he has against strippers, but what you have against women. And before you say you have no issues with them, reread your first comment. You don’t just assume a person will be a stripper for nothing, especially when that person has people vouching for their intelligence and sharp mind. 
Alright let me readjust my question, how does one make penicillin?
You are seriously undermining the complexity and science needed behind antibiotics 
I was playing battlefield 1, and we were on that map Amiens, and anyone who’s played that map knows that Objective C is always a clusterfuck, changing hands constantly. Well at some point in the madness(I was in a ps4 party chat) I leave the party chat in favor of game chat and say “for fucks sake can the squad leader please choose another objective to target(he had selected C for us all as a squad point to take control) Jesus Christ we’re being massacred here” and a British guy gets in the mic and says “I have been an effective squad leader for many years now” and I started acting shitty and said some things I’m not proud of, but he deflected all the shit talk, and I eventually left the party. About ten to twenty minutes later he sends me a picture over PSN and he had actually won best squad award, so I  not only got insulted but straight up roasted😂
X event has occurred in x place, therefore everyone from that area are just like them. Guy acts racist in southern state? The entire south is racist. Guy whines like a baby in the north? The entire north is that way. Those are just two examples that I can see, as most people are decent at the very least, and T.V. utilizes their mass market to control the way people think of others, and quite frankly, outright lie.
Asking personal questions that are insulting or otherwise hurtful. As a person who suffers from Tuberous Sclerosis and Polycystic Kidney Disease, I don’t need every fucking grown up glaring at me while at work, asking me about the stuff on my face, and recommending me facial cleansing products. If it were that easy, do you think I would not have already done it? But when I point that out they get defensive and act like they are the victims. I get it when kids ask, kids are naturally curious, and if I feel like telling them I will. But you’re a grown ass person who ways 350 pounds, and I’M the gross looking one? Lmfao righhhtttt
I know it won’t happen, but I’d love for fallout three and new Vegas to be ported to the switch.
Because you can get to know someone online. If you spend the time to actually learn about someone online, they’ll usually do the same with you. You can, for example chat with someone everyday online and you’ll understand them a bit more with each day, and after awhile you’ll most likely be friends with them and start to care about them, even if it’s all an act. I have many online friends(like my cousin lives in the U.K., and I live in the USA and though we’ve never met we still play games with each other and act like we’re friends). The idea of a bond does not take much to be created, as all it takes it the general idea of feeling accepted for who you are to be created. 
That’s totally my bad dude, thought it was all one big link
Do you want to back those claims with credible sources?
Idk what provider you’re on, but it’s definitely not T-mobile lmfao
Hell no, going to t-mobile is like jumping out of the frying pan straight into the final layer of hell. Had them and they had nothing but shitty service, they dropped my calls constantly and it worked only in random spurts, oh and the customer service was a bigger joke that Reddit’s management team. 
Just wanted to stop by and thank not only OP but everyone else too for recommending and talking about Alvvays new album, just listened to the whole thing and find it amazing and touching in so many ways. 
Edit: misspelled the band name. 
I feel like I’m committed a crime for laughing at that
Just someone trying to make an ass of themselves online...ignore him lol. 
Yeah Siri is smart in some ways and dumb in others. 
Thats how I justified the purchase too. $5 extra a month is not bad when you literally quadruple the storage of the phone. Plus if you did stick with the 64GB you might end up regretting not getting the other one.
When did you order it? I preordered it hours after the preorders went live and it’s been delivered, just gotta pick it up from USPS(if they’ve even gotten around to it).
Yeah I figured. I guess every great empire must fall at some point:/
Or maybe you’re just bitter pessimist who only sees the bad in people? Example A: your last two comments 
I guess so
Life.
Ah I see your point. I do know that there are websites that can unlock phones, how much they charge I’ve no idea. So maybe try searching around for that kind of thing 
I have this problem with Best Buy all the time, yet for me personally, they have yet to let me down. Take a deep breath my friend, all will be well, I know the excitement can be unnerving with getting a new phone so you begin going “what if” but it’ll be okay. 
Sim locked or activation locked? Because I know if it’s activation locked there’s nothing that can be done. I’m pretty sure that it’s the same if your sim is locked too.
Clear otterbox symmetry case with reinforced crystal clear tempered glass on the screen for my silver 8+ oh yeahhh
Here’s a tip for you OP, look at both of them, and just pick a color, doesn’t matter which.  Tell yourself everyday that no matter what, that’s the color you’re going with, and if every time you tell yourself you’re getting that color it bothers you in the slightest, pick the other one. 
Edit: the black one looks as good as Shemar Moore on an episode of criminal minds. The White one looks fine as hell too.
Hey man, Canada are our bros, you leave them alone!
I feel ya dude, you think steam will ever go back to the way it once was?
If you load into story, then go online, no they aren’t that bad. But if you wanna boot straight into online, then you’re gonna wait a very long time lol
The voting system of Reddit isn’t based on whether or not you agree with something, it’s meant to show whether people contributed or not. People quite often forget that. 
Ah alrighty, I totally misinterpreted his comment. 
BotW an underdog? What are you talking about? It’s had massive sales and massive obsession over it, it had glowing reviews from virtually everywhere. That does not make it an underdog. And the GOTY criteria in Japan runs April 2016 to March 2017. 
Lol I love my switch too but that’s definitely pushing it pal
Saying that the lack of social features is to protect younger audiences is absolute shit. It takes time to connect to other players and it’s 2017. If people want their children protected online they need to pay attention to what their kids do online and who they interact with. Nintendo is just being lazy because they can’t figure it out. 
That's an amazingly stupid idea, bravo 👏🏻
I feel you dude, they're both gorgeous phones
The one on the right seems to be real, but the one on the left definitely looks fake. 
Damn what a low effort post this is. 
Exactly, I like that salty sweet flavor 
In others news, a dwarf doesn't want to be called a dwarf. 
You know what my phone doesn't do? Fucking explode.
Probably because you're a fellow virgin.
I see what you're doing, ya got me 
Which color 8+ do you have there? I got the Silver 256GB
Reading through these comments..this is by far the most civilized discussions I've ever seen on Reddit, if not the entire internet. Good job you guys, seriously lol. People are actually explaining in a civil manner why they're getting which phone and why, and no ones barking at them, just genuine curiosity. Color me impressed.
Are you being genuine with that comment lol?
Ahhh alright, that's my bad, sorry for the mix up. 
Too bad the X is actually bigger...so no, I don't think so. 
I asked for names of specific laws, and you're looking for any reason to not answer the question, probably because you don't fully comprehend the ideas you're trying to portray. 

Would you like to provide names of such laws? You know, back up your claims?
If no one ever makes an attempt, it'll never succeed. One cannot be lazy and complain of inaction.
I take it you wanted that wretched woman Clinton to win? I don't support either, but i know people on both sides who are genuinely caring and loving people who don't hate Mexicans or anyone for that matter.
Oh no, I'm not blaming anyone, just showing disdain for an organization that has let me down several times in the past. It's sad because the guys were trying to be nice and donate it to Red Cross, not realizing only like 8 cents to each dollar donated actually helps people.
You weren't there when they forced people into $125,000 to $176,000 fema trailers that no one could afford, and if you didn't sign your name in a binding contract you got help from neither. They send people from all over the country who don't care about the devastation thats occurred, and then force people to eat cold food and give them tiny amounts of food per day. I tried to donate food during the flood and they refused to even hand it out, they wanted to toss hot meals onto ice for the future, despite people losing everything they had  known and loved. but yeah I'm the fucking asshole because I won't contribute towards their monopolistic control and disrespect for refugees.
Android users are the same. They pretend that whatever droid they have is cutting edge technology every time a new Samsung galaxy s-orgy comes out. If you take a realistic approach, you'll see that both companies are copying features from one another, and have been for years.

That's a very bitter view of politics especially local ones. It's a simple of deciding which person can use the resources(which are finite) to solve as many problems as possible. But most people don't do that because x person agrees/disagrees with abortion or whatever.  
We vote for neither. If more people realized that we don't have to vote based on two party system, we could get someone fresh, and perhaps not blinded by their party ideals. 
Random boners. They are not intentional, and can happen in the worst of situations, and I've learned that the more fucked up it would be to have one, the more likely it'll happen then. 
Redditors who talk of hating someone, but then constantly obsessively hate someone, like the president. I don't support him but god damn Reddit has a boner for hating on him. I'm also certainly not conservative, but the obsessive anti-conservative views this website has is sad, especially since most redditors claim to be "tolerant" of opposing ideals.
Full house. Fuckin fight me
Eh fuck it, i won't say it was the game as a whole, but more or less a character. Roxas from KH2, as he had that whole "I'm not sure what my purpose in life is" vibe going on for him and as a kid, and even as a young adult I spent ages wondering why I was born. Roxas taught me that even if you're scared, or unsure of the future, that you can still take on the unknown and accept things how they are whether you like it or not. He also taught me that the train of thought I had was not just exclusively me thinking it. 
"I'm disagreeing with a person who's actually living under the broken system that is socialism, but I'm a 19 y/o liberal arts major so I know everything."
A bit historical, but the old phrase "sell you down the river." Today it implies that someone betrayed you, but in the colonial era, it was a phrase slave owners would use on "unruly" slaves (i.e. Not wanting to be a slave/trying to run away) to get them back in line. In those days, it meant that a slave would be sold down the Mississippi River and end up in the British West Indies where they would he literally worked to death, as sugar was so profitable it was cheaper to buy a young healthy male slave and work him to death rather than take care of him. They usually lasted no longer than an average of five years..but yeah it anyway there ya go.
You too?? My dog now likes the penis and it was after obamer there had touched him! We need to stop that monster!!
Oh great, they're going to throw away all that money to the Red Cross. Fantastic, after the way they were in Louisiana last year with the flood, and this year with Texas, I'll never donate another penny to that wretched organization. 
This entire subreddit is 95% reposts isn't it?
Oh look, this post AGAIN🙄 Damn weekly reposts 
Damn dude, I'm sorry to hear that. That's utter shit. 
They signed a contract, they didn't meet the requirements. Doesn't matter if they got close, they didn't meet them, so they don't get the bonus.
Another low effort post I see
 I mean people pay to go watch football and other sports, and sometimes teams get absolutely destroyed in the process. 
The real jokes on you actually. You're going online and complaining isn't going to sway anyone from buying them, so you're just wasting your own time. 
You're also pretending that people haven't been complaining about it as well. If people enjoy destiny, let them enjoy it, stop crapping over other people's interests. If you don't like them or their game, just don't buy it and ignore the posts. People in this subreddit constantly bombard consoles(except Nintendo) but you don't see me bitching about it.
I guess when nighttime hits, the low quality posts do too.
I did, and it still makes no sense, just like the first one. 
I disagree, didn't find fallout NV enjoyable at all, but loved 3 and 4.
It's for all preorders and the price stays for two weeks after launch I believe. They don't charge you for the game until it ships, they also guarantee it to be there on launch day. 
Doesn't that hide the cursor as well? Or is that a separate setting?
I'll take a shot in the dark and say that you're Canadian because you said "in America" and it's a hockey game, whereas Europeans care more for FIFA than anything else. But typically in stores, no not really, I do know they're cheaper on amazon if you have prime (which I have) and usually come out to $48.99 plus tax, but as games are more expensive in Canada, it's a good deal off the $80 or so you'll pay at home.
This. Seriously this. Games these days are way bigger in storage size and content, even the smallest games out match games of yesterday by a long shot. When people complain about season passes I always bring this up and they usually just deny it, because deep down they know it's the truth. If you don't want the pass, don't buy it, it is in fact that simple. But I will also say that the paying for alphas/betas trend is absolute garbage. Paying for a unfinished game merely lets devs get free money and allows them to get lazy, and the overwhelming majority of companies that do it, end up ditching the game and leaving it in beta.
Oh look, this repost again. 
This is the exact reason I don't use androids, I don't feel comfortable letting a wall paper app alter my contacts or read my messages.
I remember the flood in my home state of Louisiana last year, 31 trillion gallons of water later, half the state was left in a state of emergency with 31 of 64 parishes devastated by the flood. We're still having problems getting back on track entirely..I really hope that y'all next door have an easier time rebuilding, as it was pure hell last year. 
"Only." Dude that's fucking great internet. 
Is there anyway to turn off the slow motion every thirty second? That's why I quit playing, I found that too intrusive and annoying. 
Ooof, careful, might cut someone with that edgey comment
Its funny, I genuinely thought reddit hate cops, until they needed them of course.

I honestly thought this was one of the more boring maps. But whatever floats other people's boats I guess. 
Oh look, this picture AGAIN🙄
No. 
Did he not say previously that half life 3 wasn't coming but perhaps a game in its universe might happen? I mean, this is everyone who honesty thought it was comings fault at this point.
You work at Walmart. I'd recognize that stainless steel counter, hand scanner and check machine anywhere.
Is that him in the suit?
Looks like the suit from mass effect andromeda. Cool suit, shit game.

Wasn't gonna come out of my shell, but I just got killed in rainbow six siege so I'll add to the conversation. I'm a male who's 22 years old, I have kidney problems and was a former dialysis patient who thankfully got a transplant. But when people ask me why I don't drink, I just tell them I don't care for alcohol(if they persist then I tell them that I have health issues, rather than start with it as I don't like the extra attention my health issues bring) and normally they just leave me alone. All of my friends know of my health issues and don't push, though some ask if I'd smoke pot(I'm not against it I just get a monthly blood test). Actually my bestfriend tells me all time, along with a lot of other people in my hometown at work and such that if they ever catch me with a drink in my hand they'd kick my ass(verbally most likely). Such is life in the Deep South.
Yeah it's pretty fucking cheap in America as well, idk what went through ops head 
Don't get me wrong, I like the game is fun, but to me, not $60 fun. It's just lacking in content and isn't a proper sequel to justify the full $60 price tag.
What is the baby boomers and gen x'ers obsessions about blaming millennials for everything  
This is all because of that asshole behind the meme! Lmao I'm kidding 
Yeah, I feel ya. Before the dlc came out and after I beat the game, I struggled to find stuff to do in the gameZ
Well in my experience, the general rule of thumb is four years. Four years of updates and such.
This one sounds a tad bit personal mate..
This post makes me glad I rejoined reddit after a few years away.
I'd imagine so, dude sounds a bit like a lunatic if you ask me. I must ask, did you apologize?
Got nothing better to do with your time I take it? 
Funny how people who party and drop out are always cracking jokes at other people's expense. Even if you go to college, there is no guarantee that you'll get a better job, not unless you meet and talk with the right people, it sucks but thats just how the world works. Besides, knowledge is its own reward.
I mean, is this much of a surprise? He's a dictator is he not? 
 Good riddance to cigarettes, they're poison anyway. And anyone who wants to drink does so anyway, so I don't know why everyone complains about it. Its the same way with pot, if people want to smoke it they will, thats that. "No one listens to the people" well if no one gets off their lazy asses and makes their voices heard, then they can't really be blamed for not listening now can they?
Although I do not agree with some of things the author wrote, he's got a good view on the "we broke our end of the deal" analysis. The first thing I disagreed with was the "pets are merely for making us feel better." Pets in my mind, are there for a better life than living in some cage waiting to be euthanized, or in some city street where it goes hungry. I have had many pets, most notably cats. Many of my cats have been the loving sweet kind, where others, like one of my current cats Harry, is quite standoffish and will have nothing to do with many people, and when he does "allow" you to touch or pet him, it is almost an honorary title. I know of many friends who have cats like Harry, and they still choose to keep him, because they love animals and know that if they didn't take proper care or them, they may very well end up dead, so to me, with my experiences, "pets" are not simply tools of one's own ego. I agree with the author in the sense that people rely on animals for food and other materials far too much, but dislike the fact that they point out the flaws of our modern day situation towards animals, but fall short when it comes to a much needed answer to these said flaws. What does the author and these philosophers, who of course are now dead, reasonably expect humanity to do? Stop eating what makes the bulk of our daily meals(be it meat, eggs, etc) or even stop using their fibers for clothing, leather, and other consumables? Just a thought. I understand that some may say "eat more fruits and vegetables" but that brings up the serious question that was also left unanswered, what determines what is sentient, and what is not? Overall, I did enjoy the article, however I feel that is fails to answer some serious questions brought up by the author itself. Good read.
