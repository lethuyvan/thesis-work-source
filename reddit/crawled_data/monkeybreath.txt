Yes. The downsides are that you’d need good ceiling height (at least a couple of feet), you won’t easily be able to change the direction of the spray, and the spray will be flat, rather than conical.

But it would look cool.
I’m surprised at how small the motor is, considering its power. And only one moving part. Clearly this is the future. 
I thought I was on Twitter for a second. 
It *is* kind of a messed up word. Like “foreigner”. I usually to have to search for “You’re Cold as Ice” to spell it right.

Efficiency seems to be 30%, so this would be better than a solar cell hooked up to an electrolyzer.
Don’t forget how much you might be selling this electricity for. I don’t know the Texas values, but in Ontario it can be 40x what you bought it for on a daily basis.

Some Valium might be in order, though. 
True, but we were discussing the size of the cabinet. 
Wow, Marc Mann (from Jeff Lynne’s band, on lead) was a bit of a dick. “Oh, Prince is here for practice with his lead guitar? I think I’ll just take all the solo parts.”

I’m guessing someone had a word with him, as the lighting and sound techs knew what to do during the performance. 
It was hard to tell from the brief shots. I thought Paul as well. 
If you have good abs, you wear tight clothing. If you have a big belly, your clothing is tight. 
And picking raspberries for the summer. 
The size of the cabinet affects the resonant frequency of the speaker, so it does have a function. 
That’s actually the one. I’m off Reddit for 24h and suddenly I’m too far back to catch up. 
Imagine putting leds on the outside of a clear balloon. That’s what a spinning ring would look like. A set of concentric rings spinning, though, could show models in 3D space. 
This isn’t a 3D display, though. They just rotate computer models on a 2D plane. It wouldn’t look any different than your computer monitor, other than being able to see through it.
I’ve heard the humans in Finland are like that. 
Just make them inflatable, like penises. 
You a blind lawyer, by any chance?
Naw your eyes are fine. It’s your brain that’s a mess.

Yes, though operational costs still have to be managed. 

One thing that irks me about Uber is that they are moving people *away* from public transit, but are doing so by operating at a loss and paying drivers barely enough to cover their own costs. This is predatory pricing to capture the market, and we’ll all pay for it in the end. 
I’ve actually made something like this (though nowhere near this quality) off a design I saw 20 years ago. It is really best for situations where you don’t have a chair and don’t want to carry a camp chair. You *could* use it on a regular chair as it supports your lower back. You would just be sitting a bit forward, depending on how you adjusted the knee straps. 
Wait until they have self-driving buses! A big cost for a transit route is the driver, which is why the frequency on the route is always less than you’d like. But if you could drive smaller buses more frequently without a driver (sorry, bus drivers), you could make the route more convenient and increase ridership. And since the route is constant, the AI required is less likely to hit edge cases that cause crashes. 
Yes, I can get 80% of a spit shine (spent 4 years in a military college) by rubbing in polish, letting it dry a few minutes, then buffing off the excess with a clean portion of the chamois that either came with your polish or you can buy separately. A spit-shine takes it the remaining 20%.
But any sub can be taken over by loud angry people with an agenda, so different perspectives get locked out anyway, except now it’s the helpful ones.

It amazes me how that’s possible. You should have many children in case the fire nation attacks.

I learned about this while reading [this article](https://grist.org/article/meteorologists-have-a-new-strategy-for-bringing-climate-change-down-to-earth/) about explaining climate change by showing how things are changing for the audience. 
We have to do both, yes. I just don't want people thinking we should just let Earth turn into a shit hole.
I wouldn’t count us out. There may be resource wars and population collapse, but people will still be able to farm in some areas (just not enough to feed 7 billion people). Modern humans went through a period where we had only about 70,000 people. But we now have technology and written language. 

On the other hand, we also have nuclear missiles. 
Far easier to keep Earth habitable than to terraform Mars. 
[That’s actually fairly common.](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jun/07/childhood-hallucinations-common-research-psychotic-schizophrenia-why) 17% of children have hallucinations, and half that carry on into their teens.

As a child of about 5, I remember my stuffed dog turning his head to look at me once (a bit unnerving), a red stick man looking into my bedroom, and one morning I saw the wall open in my bedroom to reveal an 8-foot tall tin soldier. 
I always thought that was fairly common.

Anyway, here’s my theory: 

Your brain is the best pattern-matching machine in the world. It is *always* trying to detect patterns in sensory inputs. It’s why we see faces in non-face objects. 

So, when the only noise you hear is background hiss from fans or even just the blood rushing through your veins, your audio cortex is still working at matching patterns, but there isn’t really anything there. So it starts matching patterns to noise, and passes this off to the speech centre, which also tries to do pattern matching.

As a result, you’ll “hear” muddled voices in the background. And since your name is literally the most important word you know, the speech centre is especially sensitive to that, and is far more likely to match to your name than any other word. So you’ll hear those muddled voices saying your name. 
Mon Dieu!
I assume they’ll all be naked at some point or why would you need this? So you might not need to go home with a different one. 
Did you get the “D”?
You only have to fold the ones you wear between washings. 
In Canada the stores buy electricity from Bullfrog Power, which puts renewable energy into the grid on their behalf. You don’t need the solar panels hooked directly to your light bulbs. 
Or a vaporizer. I was a landlord. I didn’t have anyone who smoked, but I’d have been fine with vaping. Having to repaint completely to get the smell out from smoking would have been a real pain in the ass.
Also that these trees may be sharing nutrients through their root systems and overlapping branches are wasted resources. Eg, [Aspens](https://www.nationalforests.org/blog/tree-profile-aspen-so-much-more-than-a-tree).
I should specify I wrote in 6502 machine language. Yes, I used graph paper, and memorized the hex codes for the common operations. Then I’d type the code into the memory editor. 

Mind you, I didn’t make anything very elaborate this way.  500 bytes was my biggest routine. It flipped the speaker on and off (there was no digital to analog converter) with frequency-modulated noise to simulate battlefield sounds (machine guns and whistling bomb drops at random intervals). Useless, but fun.

Edit: oh, but it had a built-in *disassembler*, so I could check my code (though no symbolic variables).
Seems good enough. It’s not like it’s horribly expensive to replace. I like that it does triple duty (bench/green).
[APL would be at the top](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language\)).

     (~R∊R∘.×R)/R←1↓ιR

finds all the primes from 1 to R.
Pascal was my favourite language for many years (though I had to translate most science routines from FORTRAN). I now write in Python.
Good point. Though when I got my first computer (Apple ][+) I didn’t have an assembler, so I wrote in machine language (and it was called that).
The flash is from hitting a power line on the way down. As /u/Zyakun mentioned, it is likely metal and lighter than it looks. You can see the divot it makes in the asphalt just behind the car at the end, which doesn’t seem as deep as I would expect. Still pretty weird, though. It didn’t seem that windy and there weren’t tall buildings close by. 
Maybe hungry and thirsty, though many dogs are only fed once a day. It was probably just fine as long as it was with family (the girl). I would have been more surprised if the dog abandoned her. 
Also, “immune”?

My understanding is that Health Canada can only check that a “supplement” doesn’t harm you. Over-the-counter supplements only have to be vague about their claims: “*may* make you feel better”. Most vitamins have conflicting research results, as well. 

As long as they don’t claim to actually cure anything, and don’t harm you, HC can’t really stop them.

It doesn’t take much to get a ripple in the water, plus there could be a bit of resonance happening that causes the ripples to reinforce each other.

At Heathrow everyone stands a metre back from the luggage carousel so everyone can see their bag and quickly pick it up as it goes by. It’s just starting to happen in Canada. 
You *could* leave the trackpad plugged in if you wanted to. The mouse is like this more likely because the designers didn’t like the look of a port at the end of it. And since you can get something like an hour of charge by blogging it in for 5 minutes, they didn’t see the need for it.
He probably was, considering how decomposed Mary Jane looked. 
Andromeda Strain? Yes, I thought it was well done. The book had endnotes with papers written by the character, which scared me even more. I literally thought “oh my god, this actually happened!”
Wow, that was just dripping with judgemental prose. 
Loki’s seen some shit. 
I read one called The Man Whose Name Was Too Long. Don’t remember how it started, but remembered all the VHS tapes falling apart. 

Crichton’s Andromeda Strain also had high-atmosphere bacteria that ate plastic, causing a fighter jet to crash. 
Corgis of the rodent world. 
Using hand detection such a Leap so all you have to do is lift your hand a bit off the keyboard. Activate the “mouse” by folding your pinky under your thumb (three fingers out for buttons).

This makes getting to your mouse and back to your keyboard much faster, and can reduce a bit of shoulder stain having a mouse off to the side. Mind you, it isn’t much faster than having a trackpad below the space bar. 
This sounds like the Cisco/Nortel rivalry. Or US/USSR. Someone‘s going to lose. By being more broke than the other guy.
We need to reduce by 100% by 2050 if we are to stay under 2°C. Guess that’s not going to happen.
That is just making me uncomfortable.

The moon is 0.5° wide, which makes the width (height, actually) roughly 12.6° wide. From that I get a DSLR full-frame lens of [about 110mm](https://www.scantips.com/lights/fieldofview.html#top), or mild telephoto. So you are only seeing a small portion of the horizon, which makes it seem a lot flatter than if you were actually there.

You can do some heat piping to improve efficiency, but no matter what you do with plastic, it will take energy. 
And still putting carbon from the ground into the air. Get with the program. 
A big part of this is that a chunk of charge is held in reserve (you can pay to get access to it to have more range). This means they are only charged partially, which gives them more apparent cycles. 

So, you can do this for phones, by giving them bigger, more expensive batteries that aren’t fully charged (they’ll appear charged in the battery indicator, though).
There is no “dark side” of the moon. There is a “far side”, but that gets sun during the New Moon phase. 
There’s still a pile of CO₂ to deal with, though. Every C in the polymer chain gets turned into CO₂. The efficiency of the process may relate to producing more H₂, and less H₂O.

It might be better to melt the plastic into blocks and dump it into mines. Or make it into cheap building materials. Far less CO₂, and better containment. 
I get your point, but you would do this if you could (or were motivated enough to put in the practice). It amazes me that this dog seems to get joy out of something that isn’t a normal wolf-inherited behaviour. We see it as a fun thing to do, but why would this dog? That blows my mind!

It is. The excess energy Apple generates reduces emissions elsewhere. 

Their retail and business centres use contracts with green suppliers such as Bullfrog Power, so they don’t have to have their own generation everywhere. Grid-scale generation is usually cheaper and more efficient than local generation. 
I think we have a ways to go for plankton. A 6°C rise will kill it, but that means none in the tropics. 
Shale gas is a huge source of [methane leaking into the atmosphere](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/17/us-likely-culprit-of-global-spike-in-methane-emissions-over-last-decade). This is not good news.

VW also did that for their hard-top convertible, EOS, so you could fit [two carry-ons completely filling the trunk space](https://www.carscoops.com/2011/04/volkswagen-launches-new-line-of/). Regular carry-ons are a couple of inches too wide. 
But that isn’t what they’re doing. In Canada, for example, their retail stores have contracts with Bullfrog power as a supplier. 
Went to see a jazz fusion group (One Step Beyond) and some guy brought his bongos. I put up with it for one song before I told him to cut it out. And he left!! Like the only reason to be there was hoping the band would hear him and bring him on stage or something.

The air gets absorbed again as the water cools. I’ve tried it and it still has bubbles. 

The only way I’ve made clear ice is to insulate a mold so only the bottom is exposed, or have a mold upside down over an insulated container of water, so that gas and impurities are pushed out the mold opening into the standing water as the water in the mold freezes. 
Yeah, I was pretty disappointed when I tried freezing boiled water, even after filtering. 
Yeah, it’d probably be cheaper to by a soda water tank from a bottling company, along with a soda fountain using the blondie concentrate instead of soda syrup. Then you’d have draft on tap. For 6 pints at a time. Maybe pour the concentrate into a bigger container? It would have too much alcohol to go bad. 
I’m no vision expert, put I’ve heard stories over the years about how babies learn to see that make sense. 

The first thing you have to learn is how to focus. You know those people who can wiggle their ears? Everyone can do that because we have the muscles and nerves to them, it’s just that we’ve never used them. We don’t even know how to activate those muscles. 

Then there’s shapes. We have neurons that are dedicated to recognizing straight lines, curved lines, wavy lines, and so on. And recognizing what a face is. There are people who find faces to be unrecognizable. Like pebbles on the beach. Unless you had a scar or weird hair colour, they couldn’t be sure it was you if they looked away and looked back. You have to learn how to recognize people. But first your brain has to learn what shapes are. You can know them intellectually, but that isn’t your visual cortex. 

You’re right, it probably would be an insane experience.

That is actually a striking tattoo. Great choice!
There are places (not naming names) where they abort when they find out the baby has XX chromosomes, so the downs rate isn’t surprising. 
1L of concentrate only makes 3L of beer, so you’re not saving a whole lot of space, and since they have to make the beer to make the concentrate anyway, I’m not sure how the economics can work out.
I just finished playing SkyrimVR every night for at least 3 hours a night over the course of about 5 months, I think. I loved every moment. The graphics are 6 years old, but you get used to it quickly. Once I had bought and built Lakeview Manor (purchase in Falkreach), I would spend lots of time there just relaxing by the river, looking at the trees and mountains. 

I just started Witcher 3, and although the graphics are much better, I miss the immersion of VR.
Skyrim has a lot of settings to help with motion sickness. It didn’t take long to get used to it, and after a few days I had them all turned off. Except for teleporting to move (point and click where you want to move and you get there in a blink). You can go much faster by teleporting, rather than the traditional walk/glide. But I switch to walking if I want to enjoy the scenery. 

As others have said, set a timer. It’s pretty easy to be in the game for 5 hours at a time, but you’ll be pretty sore if you do.
Also public healthcare, public education, welfare, progressive taxation, cannabis legalization, and LGBTQ rights. 
I was just thinking that if every person said this only once in their entire life, then cashiers will have to hear it about 300 times each (wild-ass guess).
I think you could get the right time, though, by trial and error. 
I go by the loudness. It always seems loudest around 80°C. 

I also have an induction range, so it’s faster to heat a cup of water there than in my microwave. 
Capitalism always seems like a fine balance of how little the rich can pay their employees without causing revolt. 
Because reducing the cost will encourage more use of it. Conservation is the cheapest way of reducing energy use.
This is ESPECIALLY true for deli meats. 
Especially when the mentor has the high ground. 
Tires aren’t meant to handle the extra stretching forces the water would put on them. There’s a reason car tires are speed rated. Bike tires don’t have steel in them.
Maybe just add weights to the spokes. I’m imagining the tire stretching from the centrifugal force. 
I also use earpeace. Great for concerts. 
And an efficient ~~heat pump~~ [heat converter with no moving mechanical parts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson_thermoelectric_energy_converter) that will also never reach the market.

What‽ 
Remember the perspective foreshortening. The trees you see are on a hill. There are probably trees behind the ones you see, but lower down. Humid air rises, cools, condenses.
Maybe it’s actually a cat bed. 
Mist collecting in the valley behind the tree line. 
Or low level mist from the tree humidity. 
You could make [ammonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process) or [methane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabatier_reaction) using existing processes and ship that. Both could be burned at the far end. Ammonia (NH3) is probably more economical to make (far easier to get N₂ than CO₂), but requires modified equipment for electricity generation (due to corroding zinc and copper, and the different air/fuel/compression setting).
Nuclear ejects next to nothing, until it ejects it all at the same time. 
With none of the water cooling and waste storage requirements. 

Granted, storage is required to make this *really* useful, but thermal storage has come a long way.
This may be done with a very long telephoto lens. The mountain probably looks a lot further away if you actually went to that farm.

Generally there is a return circuit to replenish the supply of electrons. For power generation this isn’t usually a problem. It’s also possible for the generator to be grounded, and receive electrons from the Earth by literally sticking a rod in the ground. Then you would only need one wire, and at the other end you would ground the other side of the load to get rid of the excess electrons it’s receiving. Eventually the electrons balance out between the two locations. How big the rod needs to be, depends on soil type and moisture. You may even have a large mesh of wire buried in the soil acting as a ground. 

Some satellites have a problem with too few or too many electrons because they use ion drives to keep their locations in space. They take a gas, usually xenon, strip a few electrons from it to make the gas charged, then use an electric or magnetic field to accelerate the atoms out the engine. This causes a build up of electrons, which it has to also eject off the satellite.
I tried making liquid soap from glycerin soap bars once, and if you let it sit for a day it turns into something quite a bit like this. It’s as if it was forming long polymer chains that holds it all together, while still being goopy. You could pour some out of the bottle, but it would gloop right back in when you put the bottle down. Just add crushed charcoal and it could almost pass for this CGI.

It may have reached r/all.
Minis are (currently) faster and have more storage (usually HDD). The power supply is also built in. So you have bigger components, more heat, and therefore also need fans and heat sinks. 

But if Apple ports MacOS to their efficient ARM chips instead of Intel x86 chips, and used exclusively soldered-on solid state drives (you would need external drives to store any amount of stuff), I suppose it could happen. 
That’s a nice bit of heating from the [Gulf Stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_current) you’ve got going there. It’d be a shame if someone added freshwater from Greenland and caused it to stop.

I think it works with aluminum, but just really poorly. 

Edit: tried to use a non-magnetic small sauce pan, but my range element wouldn’t even turn on. It detects the [reluctance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_reluctance) (magnetic resistance) in the material to determine if I’ve taken the pan off the stove. Iron has low reluctance, but air and aluminum have high reluctance. This changes the impedance of the stove elements, which changes their resonant frequency and the amount of current that goes through the coils.

Low reluctance also causes the magnetic field lines to prefer to go through the iron/steel metal, so less energy is wasted in the air. It is also the reason magnets stick to magnetic materials: the field lines so prefer to go through the material, it pulls the magnet to the material. 
Also, the romanticism of Wild West culture, where every real man had a sidearm (milquetoast shop-owners always needed their help), and you had to be ready to defend your property against marauding bandits and Indians (sorry, India) looking to take your gold and rape your women.

For anyone who is curious, [I worked out what sort of curvature you’d see at various heights](https://i.imgur.com/y8pjBVk.jpg). It does depend on the Field of View (FoV) of your camera, but using something like a Galaxy 6 (65.5°), at 35,000 feet, if your photo is 1080 pixels wide, the horizon will appear 16 pixels higher in the middle than at the sides. 

Edit: this assumes your photo has the horizon in the centre of your photo (projection plane perpendicular to line k). I think if it is at the top of the photo, the curvature will be exaggerated.

I went to a workshop given by saxophonist [Jane Bunnett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Bunnett), who at one point depressed the sustain pedal on the piano in the room.

She then started playing her sax, and the piano started “singing” back at her.

It’s part of it. There is no single thing we can do. We have to make cuts to n a whole bunch of areas. In fact, we pretty much have to have a zero-carbon economy by 2050, then start taking C02 *out* of the air after that to avoid hitting 2°C.

Well, I agree it’s going to suck, but if we can avoid a nuclear war, Humans will continue to exist. Probably about 1 billion people will be directly affected by storm flooding, but I’m not sure how long-term drought in some areas and heavy rain in others will affect food production. Lack of food in poor countries is the biggest risk, since that always leads to regional wars, which is why the Pentagon is concerned about climate change. 

I think at worst we will be down to 1 billion people. We started off with 70,000 people and no written language, so I think our odds of bouncing back are good.

As long as we avoid a nuclear war.

I saw a presentation where the guy relates how none of his friends cared what all their retirement travel was doing to the climate and how frustrating he found it. He then related a survey of what people were worried about. 

Things like war and plagues were a the top of their lists, but oddly their own deaths and climate change were at the bottom. He speculated that climate change feels like such an existential threat that we can’t think about it rationally, and therefore ignore it, just as we ignore our own mortality. 

And so, it isn’t something we talk about. Not with our friends, and not with politicians who are looking for clues as to what the electorate wants to prioritize.

This was basically made by hand, not in a streamlined factory. But you only have to replace the batteries, the electric motor lasts a long time. So it could work out cheaper in the long run. 

However, that’s not really the point here, as it gives Canada Post experience and data for follow on purchases that would be bigger and therefore cheaper. 
Which could also be a cheap energy storage system, as ammonia can burn under pressure. It costs less than $3/kWh to store ammonia, but over $150/kWh to store energy in a Tesla battery. Ammonia gets cheaper to store as the tank gets bigger, but battery costs only go down through manufacturing efficiencies. 

Most ammonia is made from methane, which provides the hydrogen for NH3, but produces a lot of CO2 as a result. There’s no physical reason the hydrogen couldn’t come from hydrolysis of water using excess renewable energy, though.
I’m surprised the root system was so developed before it broke surface. I’d have thought it would race upwards first, then develop roots concurrently with leaves. Is there an an advantage to the shown process?

Batteries will be necessary for rapid response to grid fluctuations, but I think they will only hold a fraction of stored energy.

Batteries currently cost over $200/kWh to store energy. Ammonia (NH3) tanks cost less than $3/kWh. Ammonia burns when compressed, and has similar energy density to methane. Its downside is that it isn’t as efficient to store, and has a higher equipment cost to convert from electricity and back again. Flow batteries are another possibility, but they are also expensive since the cost doesn’t drop much with size.  

Straight hydrogen is cheaper to convert, but the storage costs are much higher (it requires special materials, very high pressure, and lower energy density, and tends to leak through everything).

Which you would use will depend on the application. Batteries are definitely best for home storage and to prevent short voltage drops. Hydrogen might be best at smaller grid applications where you don’t need to store a lot of energy. Ammonia would be best where you want large amounts of backup energy for long periods of poor sunlight or no wind.

There’s a psychological effect due to personal investment. I don’t remember the actual term, but learned about it as a military officer, as it is the rationale behind challenging boot camps. The more you’ve invested initially, the more likely you will stick it out. This was borne out experimentally, since one year we made an easy boot camp, and retention rates dropped drastically. 

I haven’t seen this said explicitly, but I suspect that’s why we have such complex marriage rituals. It makes you more invested in the marriage.

Natural changes from Earth axis tilt are causing us to get *cooler*, not warmer. The sun hasn’t gotten warmer over it’s 11-year average in the last 40 years. Aerosols from volcanoes make us cooler. Nothing natural is making us warmer.

Greenhouse gases are the only things that are warming up the atmosphere (with some help by soot on the Arctic ice).  Our oil, gas, and coal consumption alone accounts for 127% of the annual CO2 increase. 

All of this has been very well studied and confirmed. 
No, it is strictly distance to the camera. Using different lenses or different sensors is the same thing as cropping. 

[Demonstration with a fake cat I made. ](http://i.imgur.com/KzwKcwz.gif)

Edit: to elaborate, the closer you are to your subject’s face, the larger the nose will appear, because the nose is much closer, relatively speaking, than other feathers like your ears. As you move away, the relative distances get smaller, so they appear closer to their true relative size. 

Let’s say your nose and ears are about the same size. If your nose is .5 ft forward of your ~~face~~ ears, and the camera is 2 ft from your nose, then your nose will now appear 2.5/2 = 1.25x bigger than your ears. But if you move back to 10 feet, then your nose will only appear 10.5/10 = 1.05x bigger than your ears, so pretty close to actual size. 

So when taking photos of people, it’s best to move back several feet. You can crop the photo, or you can use a larger lens to optically crop the photo, which gives you better resolution.
True, I cannot prove that we aren’t just computer simulations by a vastly superior life form. Or worse, that we are brains in vats. 

But consider: even if our artificial worlds were created by Minecraft-like world-building algorithms, every change we make, tree cut, mine dug, building erected, has to be recorded. The memory alone would take a large asteroid to store, and then there’s the communications paths required. If not, then our world would have no persistence, and clearly it does. 

And what would we do differently if we found out we *were* simulations? Give up? We can’t escape the computer and make our own bodies. And after giving up, what if we were wrong?

So even if we were simulations, even if we were complex chemical computers in a physical world, we might as well pretend that we are what we only seem to be. 


There may be some percolating involved, but all your creative thoughts are due to outside influence at some point in your life. 
How did that information get into your mind?
You don’t have free will, but I assure you from experience that life will be much better for you if you pretend that you do.
You apply the tax to the sources. So tax the oil, coal and gas producers only. The rest takes care of itself. 

The complication comes from when you import products from countries without a carbon tax. You then have to sit down with economists and engineers to calculate a Border Adjustment Tariff on those products. 

There is also resistance to apply the carbon tax on agriculture, since that raises the price of food. But I think that would be better handled by using carbon tax revenue to offset the rising costs through income tax benefits. 
It’s always this sort of meta comment that turns the tides. 
*Everything* businesses and industry do eventually results in an individual purchase of goods or services. So individual choices make a huge difference. 

The problem is that we as consumers can’t tell which are the best goods or services to buy. And that’s where carbon taxes come in. They immediately sends a signal that is passed all the way down to the consumers, and requires very little to track.  Is New Zealand lamb better for the environment than local lamb? If local lamb suddenly got more expensive because of all the methane-derived fertilizer required for feed compared to grass, then you’d know. 

Industry might prefer aluminum from Canada verses another country since all of it is made from hydro electricity, and that gets reflected in the price. And that trickles down to the products they sell, or even services since their costs are lower. 

Making carbon more expensive makes every decision a simple cost decision. 
Your brain is a chemical computer. A highly complex one, to be sure, but a computer nonetheless. It takes external stimuli, processes and sends out signals as a result. That processing also results in internal changes, some temporary, some fairly permanent. 

*You* didn’t change your mind, it was changed for you.

Listen, how many times do we have to tell you that you can’t generalize based just on your ex-wives and mistresses?
My 2nd grade science class grew corn in full light and in a cupboard. Guess which grew fastest. The cupboard! The explanation was that the side of a plant that gets the least light grows faster so that the plant will bend towards the light source. Therefore, low-light plants grow faster to get to a light source. 

Granted, cupboard corn was sickly and thin, while your red bamboo might have been perfectly healthy. Just wanted to bring up that you have to consider all factors and consequences. 

Another consideration is if you actually want faster growth. BC forestry industry developed pine trees that grew faster than regular pine, but when they started harvesting, the wood density was too low to be used for anything but pulp (and I expect the cellulose yield was low for that, too). Many greenhouses use high CO2 concentrations to increase yield, but recent research is finding that it only increases the amount of starch produced, so the [nutrition per calorie actually decreases](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/05/140507-crops-nutrition-climate-change-carbon-dioxide-science/) for certain crops using C3 synthesis (wheat, rice, peas, soybeans, etc).

Batteries have an excellent role for grid stabilization, but cost $150+/kWh of storage, so aren’t ideal for large amounts. Chemical storage is better. Ammonia tanks are less than $3/kWh. Ammonia burns in diesel generators or fuel cells. Hydrogen also works, it has cheaper conversion costs than ammonia, but higher storage costs. 

Which one you choose will depend on the trade off between capacity, power, and time. Homes will certainly be battery. Long-term catastrophic backup (PWhs) will likely be ammonia, with hydrogen fitting somewhere in between.

New design from Juuk. Lightweight aluminum band with butterfly closure. Seems pretty good quality, and is comfortable. I haven’t had any arm hairs pulled, yet, so that’s a plus. The pins fit very snugly, and they provide a tool for removal. 

One pin wouldn’t come out at all, and snapped when I tried to put it back in. I used part of another pin to fill in the gap, and I can’t tell which one it is, now. The other pins came out using the supplied tool fairly easily. 

The grey against the SS G2 watch is probably a controversial choice, but I like it. The SS picks up the grey easily, so there isn’t as much contrast as you might think.

It’s a side effect of reason. When Voltaire was arguing for government by reason, he was then ruled by kings who made arbitrary edicts. The audience just accepted the decision because it was the king’s apparent right. Voltaire said that this was not how governments should run.

By requiring reasoning to be used in government, governments had to explain their reasoning to the public. But often those in power had desired outcomes they knew the public would not accept, so rationalized the outcome. An uncritical audience accepted the rationalizations because they seemed reasonable at first glance. But it is reasoning by omitting important factors. 

I’m not saying, and neither is Saul, that reason should not be used, just that it is often used too narrowly. 
So there’s only two people on the team?

I suspect if they included the beef in their lifecycle study, it would still be carbon positive, though I applaud doing something with the manure. The problem is that we’ll still have to drastically reduce beef production to get to a zero-carbon economy by 2050, which means there won’t be enough poop to go around. So we’ll have to make a change anyway. 
While I think Trudeau should have capped the tar sand production, thus obviating the need for pipelines, for whatever reason, he didn’t. And since there is now still a need to sell Canadian product and get it to market, I don’t see anything wrong with him using oil lobbyists to help. 
I believe they’re now trying to keep prices so low that it isn’t cost effective to start any new shale oil or tar sands projects, so we keep buying OPEC oil. 
I’m pretty sure I can make this with cardboard, LEGO, and a discarded electric motor for about $10.

Possibly, but the problem lies with the transistors we use. 

When they are fully on, they have little resistance, so there isn’t much heat loss. When they are fully off, there isn’t much current, so again, not much heat loss (really small transistors do have leakage, so there is still some). 

But to get more than two states, the transistor has to be somewhere between on and off. This means there is some current and some resistance, so heat is generated, making the CPU much hotter. Another problem is that there is only a small voltage used, and there is enough thermal noise that if you had multiple voltage levels as States, the noise might be enough to give frequent data errors.

[Balanced Ternary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_ternary) gets around some of this by using three states (1, 0, -1), which eliminates the power problem as they are again only fully on or fully off, but requires mores transistors to implement. 

So then it becomes a trade off between complexity and speed. It seems it is just cheaper to make more binary circuits.

Not offhand. Nobody is building this yet. 
It’s used in farming right now. Farmers have a small tank they pull behind the tractor which injects ammonia directly into the soil. 

Large tanks have a berm around it to contain escaped liquid, which boils away. It is lighter than air, but a serious leak could waft downwards. Fortunately it smells terrible, and you’ll smell it long before it is toxic. The tanks are insulated with a release valve at the top, so ammonia would boil if the cooling system failed, but only a bit at a time. It’s not like a pressurized tank. These tanks are also not in heavily populated areas. 

As for cars, it would be similar to propane. There should be interlocks in the nozzle to keep it from flowing unless it is engaged in a receptacle. The biggest advantage is that it isn’t explosive at standard air pressure. An alternate approach would be to use ammonia salts, though I haven’t looked at this to see how the energy density compares. Heating the salt up releases the ammonia. You’d do a salt exchange at a station. 

Denmark had considered mixing ammonia 50/50 with natural gas to use in home heating. I don’t know how far they’ve gone with this, though. I also don’t know how this affects the explosiveness of the natural gas. 

I don’t expect to see this go anywhere with cars. Batteries have too much of a mind share, despite the recharge speed and range issues. People will also be leery of the dangers that you pointed out. But for grid storage I think it is ideal.
I only watch Office through clips you guys post, so seeing this came first makes the painting one more poignant. 
Was that before or after Michael wanted her painting of the office?
That’s carbon steel, which isn’t used for ammonia storage. 
And what is the power rating at full capacity?
The DC-to-AC converter must have a power rating. That’s what I think the 3 GW refers to. The AC-to-DC converter can have a lower power rating since it usually pulls power over a longer period. 
That’s hydrogen. Ammonia does accelerate corrosion of zinc and copper if any water is present, though, so all fittings must be steel, not the more common brass. 
Who was talking about losses?
It depends on what their goal is. Tesla’s [battery in Australia](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/26/teslas-enormous-battery-in-australia-just-weeks-old-is-already-responding-to-outages-in-record-time/) only has enough capacity for minutes of operation, yet provides stability to the grid. 
And I was giving an example of one. 
That’s the cost of the steel tank. At GWh capacities, an insulated, refrigerated (-33°C) tank is used, as it doesn’t need to be pressurized. ~~Conversation~~ Conversion costs are extra. 
Note that for grid storage, AC to DC and DC to AC conversion is required, and this also has to be specified, but in MW. So 3 GW may be the DC to AC requirement their grid will need. 
The [actual plan](http://www.azcc.gov/commissioners/atobin/letters/energyplan.asp) also says just GW. But in context with other paragraphs, that might have been what they meant. So not necessarily a capacity target, but a power target. They might only intend to use the storage for a few minutes at a time to stabilize the grid. 
At the risk of making you feel sicker, I believe things will get much worse before they get better. We are unlikely stay under the 2°C target, and even if we did, many cities such as Miami and Shanghai will still be affected. 

But, as storms continue to get more destructive, the opposition to doing anything will weaken. It may take another 10 years, though. And many countries are making a mostly serious effort. Economics may make this easier. Alberta, for example, recently bought contracts for wind energy at $0.03/kWh. I believe grid-level energy storage is also on the horizon. 

As for *fixing* the damage, I suspect much of it will self-repair once we get CO2 back to normal and stop putting plastic in the ocean. But that repair may take a few centuries. 

In the meantime, do what you can to reduce your footprint, be a role model, and support politicians who will move us in the right direction. 
Except that Vermont and Washington have said no to a tax, leaving 7 (though WA may put a minor tax on large emitters).
This could be useful in processes where heat is needed in one part, and generated in another, but at a different time. An example would be chemical energy storage, where heat is needed to make the chemical, and heat is generated when the chemical is used. 
[Ammonia storage](https://www.siemens.co.uk/en/insights/potential-of-green-ammonia-as-fertiliser-and-electricity-storage.htm) is less than $3/kWh, and we already have plenty of experience with it. It can be made from water and nitrogen from the air using [existing processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process), and it burns in slightly modified diesel generators, and future turbines or [fuel cells](http://www.ammoniaenergy.org/development-of-direct-ammonia-fuel-cells/).

That’s what I’m saying. They are mixing up weight and volume. 
I’m an oldie, and I recently decided to do as much in metric as I can. Switching my scale and thermostat to metric helped a lot. I use metric to measure stuff since it is much easier to do calculations. Fruits and vegetables prices are still shown in lbs, since that price is cheaper. But that’s about all that’s left. 
**They are mixing up weight and volume**. The volume one is often shown in high school science: a cup of water and a cup of alcohol (like 70% rubbing alcohol), makes less than two cups of liquid, since the small water molecules fit in between the larger alcohol ones. The same thing with a cup of sugar and a cup of water: you get slightly more than a cup of sweet water.

Speed of impulse isn’t even on the list of considerations for the vast majority of applications. Data rate and interference immunity are the top two, which fibre optics has in spades (trade-off is cost and to some extent strength).

Technically, it’s not *using* oil that reduces carbon. What Trudeau is doing is leaving it up to oil companies to decide if they want to expand in a world where there is and likely will continue to be an oil glut. 

Some caveats, though:

- Oil production can release methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. It’s up to provinces to ensure that companies take steps to reduce this methane release.

- drilling has an environmental impact.

- Transport of oil also has environmental risks.

In fairness, this could be used for wind/solar energy that would otherwise be thrown out (eg in the middle of the night for wind, or daytime during cool seasons for solar).

The biggest downside of this is the losses over time. A metre of insulation should help, but they don’t give a figure. 
I found it instructive. Companies like [Siemens are looking at using ammonia in Diesel generators](https://www.siemens.co.uk/en/insights/potential-of-green-ammonia-as-fertiliser-and-electricity-storage.htm), which is inexpensive and carbon-free. But they still need a few seconds to start, so having a primary battery storage system for those few seconds is valuable.

The backlight on Kindles have high blue content. You only need the backlight in a dim room, and if you have a warm light reading lamp, it isn’t a problem since the backlight will be off then.

Iceland has a [trial project going now](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/science/carbon-capture-and-sequestration-iceland.html) to pump CO2 and water into basalt deposits (ie all of Iceland) and turn it into calcite. 

Another approach is to make ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen, then add CO2 to make solid urea which can be stored. Bubbling air through liquid ammonia is an easy way to scrub CO2 from it. This is more energy intensive than the basalt approach. 
The expectation is that we will have to peak (zero emissions) by 2050, and start removing CO2 after that. [RCP 2.6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathways)

When it was first “trotted out”, it was only a concern about the future. In some regions the concern is materializing right now. In others, we don’t know. This is only one of many, but because it has a large margin of error, it is the easiest one to attack.

2010 populations: [20 - 25,000](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2012.02753.x/full) 

2015 populations: [22 - 31,000](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22823/0)

Polar bear populations are hard to measure due to the remoteness, danger, and cost. There is also financial incentive for Inuit hunting guides to over-estimate the numbers to keep the animals off the endangered list. 

It appears from the above that populations are growing, but the large overlap in the ranges means they could still be shrinking. Basically we don’t know for sure. Biologists are certain that ice loss will require them to change, but it is unclear if they can. Sea lions, their main diet, can rest on thinner new ice that polar bears can’t reach. 

Finding this information on Google is challenging because the first few pages of searches are filled (for me) by denier blogs who interlink and raise their PageRank numbers. I had to start at Wikipedia and hunt down references that way. 

Edit: there are well-studied populations, particularly in Canada, [that are in significant decline](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/11/141119-polar-bears-arctic-warming-animals-science-alaska/). Other populations, especially in Siberia, only have very rough population estimates. 


That article was rather annoying. It quotes her blog saying how she’s making researchers lose face and making them upset, but didn’t bother to talk to any actual researchers who could confirm or deny her claims.

Works fine on Facebook and Twitter. The app devs have to make a setting on their image views for it to work correctly. 
No, when I check again with the watch pressed to my wrist, it reads lower (eg 94 vs 124). It’s when the watch is vertical (facing outward, not up) that this happens. I expect there is enough vibration to induce a signal in the camera reading. 
My smart watch is affected by drum&bass music. It keeps triggering my heart rate alert at the same bpm as the music. 
But it works on the Facebook and Twitter apps. So each app dev has to let the system know what shouldn’t be inverted. Weird that Safari doesn’t, though.

It’s probably cheaper to use the clean energy we can produce today to supplant coal and gas energy. Only when that has all gone, *then* use this to compensate the CO2 produced by planes. 
I sometimes think of buying bales of low-quality recycled paper (too poor quality for easily turning back to paper, eg food covered, already recycled), covering the bales in a wax coating to deter moisture*, and burying in abandoned mines as carbon credits. I’m not sure how viable a business model this is, but it’s something. 

Edit. CO2 is 37.5% carbon by weight. Wood is about 50% carbon by weight. I can buy carbon credits for $40/ton, so I could get $53 per ton of paper I put in the mine. Maybe more since these are real credits, not credits for future savings. I’d have to use biofuel for loaders, and some amount of streamlined capacity to maximize profit. I could probably get more than minimum wage doing this. 

*The bales must be dry to deter bacteria or mole growth which could produce methane and , if not captured, negate the carbon credits.

This is where iTunes’ smart playlists help. I make a couple of playlists, one that takes a bunch of the least recently played 4 and 5-star (or liked) songs, and the other takes a few of the least recently played 3- or no-star songs. Then another playlist that takes all the songs from the previous two. This way I get mostly my favourites, but a few b-sides make it in.

You can make it even more interesting with a playlist for songs played less than 5 times, so new songs get a listen, and one that plays some of your least *often* played liked songs. That makes it more like hit radio. 

I have about 14 hours of music in the combined playlist, and just sync my phone when I get home.

Interesting aside, the hydrogen in most ammonia (NH3) is made by steam reforming methane, CH4, since it takes less energy than through hydrolysis. Unfortunately, this also releases a lot of CO2, making agriculture a source of greenhouse gas emissions. 

Hopefully there will be some form of incentive to go back to hydrolysis from renewable energy (the process initially used hydroelectric dams for power).

> That said, an a noticeable chunk science is a matter of opinion simply due to shoddy methodology or forced conclusions.

Which chunk would that be? 
Everything but CO2. Particulates produced by coal, cars, and even gas electricity plants have a measurable effect on health. Getting rid of all the particulate is expensive, making renewable energy cheaper in comparison. 
They argue that the facts are made up.
Great answer. And the crust naturally exposes rock that absorbs CO2 through weathering, so over about 500,000 years the excess gets absorbed.  It's having a bit of trouble keeping up to our current rate of emissions. 

Interestingly, when it is colder, this doesn't happen as quickly, so there is a natural feedback loop keeping CO2 within certain limits. 
One advantage is the battery pack lasts longer if you don't fully charge it. Plus when it drops to 80% of what you bought, the extra 15kWh is cheaper than a new battery. Maybe by that time, the unlock will drop in price. 
It would have been cheaper to build the solar and wind farms to power that city than to rebuild a whole new one. 
Habituation to a scent happens in your brain. As you keep getting a scent signal, your brain gradually starts to ignore it. With regular flowers, after you've been sniffing them for a few minutes, the intensity of additional sniffs diminishes.

With violets, it's your scent receptors that get shut down, not your brain. And it happens quickly, so the signal does get to your brain long enough to cause habituation. Consequently, after a few non-violet breaths to clear your nose, you can take another sniff of the violet smell and it will be just as strong as the first one earlier.

* Next you have some felt that reduces the noise of the hammer when it falls. 

* The two see-saw mechanisms in the centre give the key its weight. Changes here make the keys feel different between pianos. Even the shape of the rocker the key sits on can change the feel.

* The piece on the right pushes the hammer up, but gets knocked aside at the end so that the hammer will fall back down just a bit after the strike so that the string can resonate without being dampened by the hammer while the key is depressed. 
Nice carrying case.

There is a spoken preference for promoting married men in the Canadian Forces officer corps. They are seen as more trust-worthy. 
The part that stuck out for me was his friends saying if you're poor you must have screwed up. Yes, he was rich before, but it doesn't take much of a leap to look at others and think if they are still poor after a certain age they must have screwed up and deserve to be where they are.
That's why don't tell them. 
No, not at all. 
In this case they're selling it, but you could separate out the urea and store that instead. You'd have to keep making more ammonia, though, which takes a bit of energy. Right now we don't have a surplus of green energy, so it is more efficient to use that green energy to avoid creating CO2 in the first place. 

The other approach is to pump the CO2 into old wells, but there's a huge risk of it leaking out and possibly killing people and animals through suffocation. 
Mine was in February. You need a better accountant. 
It works great with my watch. 
I use Transit, them switch to Maps for the walking portion (better audio cues). I'm looking forward to seeing how they compare (the Transit routes have been completely messed up lately).
I always advertised on Kijiji, so look there at least. $1800 sounds low, though. A 1 bedroom usually goes for $1600. 
Look up CO2 scrubbers. Lots of ways to do it. A recent company (maybe even this one) just bubbled air through ammonia at pressure. The CO2 attaches to the ammonia as urea. You then release the CO2 by heating the solution up.
Not great news for the nuclear boosters out there. Nuclear designs have to come down in cost and up in ease of regulatory certification for this to change. 

As demand ramps up for renewables, it's possible their material demands may outstrip supply, so nuclear may not be completely out. 
You're telling me to turn right to go left‽ 
The benefits are a consideration when choosing between two jobs. You consider them along with your salary. 
You have to create a Service Canada account and get it there. This is a fairly recent thing, though I think you could phone for the information before. Not many people realize this, though. 
I did, several years ago. This topic comes up every few months. 
The latter, he has to move the camera every time he changes the focal length (mm). The focal length is just a better way to crop the image (you don't lose resolution). 

If you are just taking photos for Facebook with your phone, it's ok to stand back and crop later. You won't notice the difference in resolution, but people will look better in the photos. At least 10' is best. 
A bit more?
You don't pay CPP twice, you pay the employee half and the employer half. Employer costs are always part of salary negotiations. Not having vacation or sick days or a pension are all your decisions within your control. I've always paid into insurance for sick days, and plenty of companies can set up a disability/pension plan for you. 

But you won't do any of this because you are focused on getting as much money as possible for yourself *today*, through tax avoidance, even if that diminishes your benefits in the long run.

I have zero sympathy for you. 
My dad actually said all his friends were just going to live on CPP so he wasn't worried. I think people should get a statement with their tax returns saying exactly how much CPP they could get, because he apparently didn't figure in the fact that Mom never worked and wouldn't be getting anything. 
I'm retired and live in Centretown. It's plenty safe, though a bit more colourful than other areas. Lots of pubs, restaurants, and a few grocery stores. But it's also the most expensive area to live (outside of buying a mansion in Rockliffe, or the highly coveted Glebe and Westboro areas).

Consider the [Lincoln Fields area](https://www.google.ca/maps/@45.3682787,-75.7854708,16z) in the west part of the city. There is a small mall there with a grocery store and a pub, but importantly it is a transit hub that will get you downtown and out to Kanata easily. The light rail will go through there eventually. Most of the IT shops are in Kanata to the west, so traffic will be better for you (and no sun in your eyes if you drive). It's not as exciting as downtown, but a lot cheaper, and some of the condo buildings have nice river views. You'll be minutes from downtown by car or cab, and about 20 minutes by bus. A little bit to the East is Westboro, where you'll find many more shops and restaurants. Also right by a great bike path into town, and Britannia Beach. 

Higher on the hipster scale is Wellington West/Hintonburg. It is much closer to town, but still pretty easy to get out to Kanata. It's starting to build up, and there are a couple of brew pubs in the area. Grocery shopping sucks a bit, but there are a few small markets around. 
Unfortunately this had very little content. The big hold-up with lab-grown meat is finding a plant-based replacement for [fetal bovine serum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_bovine_serum), which is an animal product needed to supply the nutrients for the muscle cells. 
I imagine this would be similar to balancing with a partner, anyway.

Explaining to adults there isn't a 100 year conspiracy among thousands of scientists trying to take your tax dollars and get rich on science grants. And that yes, big companies actually do put out false information to protect their billion dollar businesses and their million dollar bonuses.

Aja was such a good album. It was actually the first album I had ever seen advertised on TV. I only saw it once, but I vaguely recall it featuring the mysterious Asian woman on the album cover. I knew of them from the Seattle FM station I listened to, and I had the "FM" soundtrack (possibly the first LP I ever owned). So the ad pushed me to buy the album.

Just yesterday I was chatting with a friend of mine who was a Toronto audio engineer. I don't remember which Steely Dan album he worked on (he had worked on The Wall, though), but he said a typical SD album involved about 80 studio musicians, in LA and NYC. They'd all do their takes of the tracks, and SD would pick among them to put together the final tracks. My friend spent a lot of time with razor and tape literally putting the track together!
I thought that was the point, to completely destroy those departments so the rich can get their promised tax cuts. 
Republican "scientists" do. I was arguing with a climate change-denying biologist just the other day. Lots of MDs, too.
Maybe it's the same thing as being dumb, but it feels more like they just turned off their critical thinking capabilities as soon as they left school. 

I've tutored math, and I've lost count of the number of times a student can't make the logical leap no matter how easy I make it. Eventually they get it (or I'd be a bad tutor), but it is very frustrating. When I talk to conservatives, often times I get the exact same feeling. They'll happily regurgitate their favourite blogger or Fox & Friends personality, but I just can't get them to see the logical fallacies they're making.

If everyone is being a dick to blacks, maybe blacks are the assholes? See how stupid that is?
Interesting that a Progressive Conservative agreed to do this, and that he had critics. It came in on time and on budget, plus saved a lot of damage later, so he was definitely vindicated. 
I can't read the article, but someone on Twitter said it actually means 1/2 of students would not get a B, not that they would fail. Any confirmation?
I wonder at what point would you just shutter your old fossil fuel plants and build out renewables.
Not the same effect, though. In your link, there is clearly a balance between the pressure from the jet and gravity. The screwdriver is balanced on the jet, with the flow around the handle holding it in place. 

In the posted video, the tape centre of gravity is significantly outside the jet flow, so something else has to be adding a force to keep it in place. 
Don't worry about it. The black dude controls the handshake the entire time. The white dude was relaxed and went with the flow, but it would have been only slightly less fluid with anyone else.

Latching onto your comment to bring up the [Witt Test](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/langevin-ryerson-cornwallis-is-our-past-unfit-for-the-present/article35692106/) for these problems: 

> **First**: Is the principal legacy of the namesake fundamentally at odds with Canadian values? This requires a broad understanding of the life’s work of the individual in question.

> **Second**: Was the relevant principal legacy significantly contested during the namesake’s lifetime? Isolated statements or actions considered controversial today may have been conventional wisdom at the time. Context matters.


> **Third**: At the time of the naming, was the namesake honoured for reasons fundamentally at odds with Canadian values? Why was this person commemorated?

> **Finally**: Does the building play a substantial role in forming community? The more prominent the edifice, the greater the casefor retaining names of historical significance, Prof. Witt says.
Yet. They did rename the [Langevin block](http://globalnews.ca/news/3545470/ottawa-langevin-block-renamed/) in Ottawa because of his involvement in the residential school system.

Have you ever sung in the shower and notice your voice booms at certain notes? That's a standing wave, cause by singing at a resonant frequency of your shower. The walls are closer together, so it is more likely to resonate at your natural frequency. You can also see standing waves in ultrasonic humidifiers. All the acoustic energy focuses in a few spots, causing the water at those spots to vaporize.

Your shower is pretty simple, four walls and a floor and ceiling. It's easy to calculate the resonant frequencies there. But if you were in a room with lots of small walls, it would be much more difficult. That's what you have in LEDs. The crystals in LEDs have deliberate impurities added to provide electrical characteristics. When you inject electrons into the crystal, they tend to act like sound waves and resonate. But because of all the impurities, it was difficult to figure out where most of the electron energy would sit (the standing wave). This landscape function is an easier way to calculate the locations of the standing waves, and to even control them. This allows LED designers to ensure the energy goes where it is most useful, thus making the device more efficient. 


Not a bad idea. Easy to spot if someone doesn't return it.

It takes a month to orbit now. To be locked to one side, it would have to be going 28x faster (or so, I'm not looking it up). It would be colliding with all our geostationary satellites. Tides would be insane.

Individual scientists occasionally make over-the-top claims (remember Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling's claim that massive doses of vitamin C could prevent cancer? He died of cancer.) You have to look at a number of experts in the field to see if it is a credible prediction. Most climate scientists did not support these predictions. 
That would actually be relatively useful. The most potent GHG, though, is water. Mars could use a lot more of that. 
If this works, the coolest part will be the pure oxygen off gassing every time you recharge.

This is the first watch I've worn daily since I got my first cellphone in 2000. With the clock on the cell, a watch seemed superfluous.

That toxicity isn't put into the air for everyone in the country to breathe. 
Baseload amount is useful because nuclear (at least) doesn't react quickly to changes, and so is set to supply the baseload, while nimbler generation types can manage the rest. But if all your generation is nimble, you don't care about baseload. It is just whatever demand you expect at this moment compared to whatever is available and at what cost.

As a plane gets larger, the angle between the sightline to the edge and the horizontal plane gets smaller. At infinity, the sightline is horizontal. Another way to look at it is that your altitude becomes insignificant at infinity. So your first simulation is incorrect, which may be a limitation of the software. 
Do you really need a house this big? Maybe a smaller place closer to work will give you more time for family or hobbies. 
If your flat Earth is an infinite plane, it would appear as a straight line at infinity. If it is a disc, then you are simulating the horizon of a spherical Earth, which has a disc horizon centred on the viewer. If the latter is the case, then you are confirming what I've said.

Wind exists at night. Also, [ammonia storage](https://medium.com/@brysonmasse/cloud-storage-for-energy-is-here-5a24bc8ccbc#.yykysru10) is possible at $3/kWh. 
We are on the verge of cheap chemical storage to shift excess energy to peak use times. And as electric vehicles become prevalent with smart charging, along with smarter energy distribution, storage might not be required. 
Theoretically you could do that with a bit of programming. Use a scripting language like Python to scrape some news/weather pages, and AppleScript to get your events and reminders. The text goes onto a single text page that you get your Mac to read into an audio file called "my day". Then add the file to iTunes and sync your phone. 

When you want to listen, just say, "Hey Siri, play my day".

Of course, that's a lot of fiddly scripting, which is probably not what you were hoping for.

My image had nowhere near the perspective distortion of what your screen image had. A phone camera has a 62° or greater FOV, which is 50% greater than what you're used to working with. 
I made a quick mock up in Blender of a camera above the Earth at 13 km with a focal length of 28 mm (typical of Samsung cameras). [The horizon is similarly curved.](http://i.imgur.com/8JinSrw.jpg)

We tend not to notice in planes because our vision is around 50 mm, and we don't often have a steady frame to compare the horizon against. 

Edit: you can also calculate what the expected curvature with the calculator [here](https://flatearthinsanity.blogspot.ca/p/fei-horizon-calculator.html?h=40000&hu=ft&w=1024&fov=60&o=26). The pixel number at the bottom are how much you would expect the horizon in the centre to be higher than at the edges given the supplied altitude, image width, and field of view. You can get field of views from [here](https://www.nikonians.org/reviews/fov-tables), with phone cameras being in the range of 28 mm (Samsung) to 33 mm (iPhone).
I disagree. [This is from my iPhone](http://i.imgur.com/YQ1qO3O.jpg), using a 65" TV as a straight horizon. I added a reference line at the top to show any distortion. At worst, there is a bit of pincushion distortion, the opposite of what is being claimed. 
Assuming a fish-eye lens. Most phone cameras don't have this distortion. 

Edit: for example, this is from an [iPhone 7 camera](http://i.imgur.com/yRmojQg.jpg). No distortion at the top of the frame. Samsung Galaxy is only slightly wider. 
The radius of the [horizon in the photo is only 260 miles](http://www.ringbell.co.uk/info/hdist.htm), assuming an altitude of 45,000 feet. 
If the camera is pressed up against the glass, dust and scratches would be too out of focus to notice unless they were significant. 
Funny how I never see this distortion taking pictures anywhere else, though. Don't forget how high the plane is. 

Edit: from my iPhone 7: http://i.imgur.com/yRmojQg.jpg

Edit 2: added a [reference line](http://i.imgur.com/YQ1qO3O.jpg) to make it easier to see against a black background. My camera has a very slight pincushion distortion, not barrel distortion, which would counteract Earth's curvature, not accentuate it. 
Alabama, you've got the rest of the Union to help you along. What's going wrong?

I did the calc for NH3 using wind, and it's $1.40/L of equivalent energy to gasoline, including equipment overheads. That price will only go down. Solid state fuel cells will last a lot longer. 
> roughly
Fuel cells are more efficient than Diesel engines, which is why they'll probably be the end game, if batteries don't lock alternative fuels out. 

Hydrogen for alternative fuels will come from electrolysis of water, not wells. Steam reforming CH4 produces a lot of CO2. It doesn't have to be electrical utilities who pay for the energy plants. 
That could be urea (ammonia and CO2), which is sold as fertilizer. I think it degrades to NH3 and CO2 when heated. Another possibility is ammonia salts, which simply absorb ammonia when cooled, and releases it when heated. I haven't looked at the energy density of either.
Oh man.
Apple also allows developers to remove unnecessary binaries prior to download (can't remember what they call that). So the iPhone and iPads don't get the graphics that the other can't use, for example. I think languages may also be reduced. 
Intel CPUs have had [on-board RNGs for several years](http://www.electronicdesign.com/learning-resources/understanding-intels-ivy-bridge-random-number-generator). They use a feedback loop to control a bias signal to ensure the number of 0s and 1s are roughly equal. Then it goes through a cryptographic function that takes many possibly-biased bits and outputs 256 bit seeds to a PRNG so that random numbers can be retrieved as fast as required.

There was some concern that the NSA had compromised this. I think they could do it by limiting the amount of feedback, creating much more bias. This would limit the key space to make the unbiased seeds. 
I figure they're doing a piss-poor job with the info they have, how will they handle even more?

There's a big difference between programming and data entry. Grace Harper wasn't a data entry clerk. But otherwise, I'll concede there is a different draw between the genders. 

I was in a military environment, so it won't translate well, but we only had a few people who built networks at home, mostly contractors who saw it as useful for job competition. It was certainly not their only hobby. 
The molecules pack more closely together, so by volume it is more energy dense. 
How are bitcoins stolen? Is some secret number discovered (by breaking a passcode or poor security)?
If you are going with a carbon-neutral fuel, this is probably the easiest to make in bulk. It is also close to the energy density of diesel (11 kWh/kg vs 12), which is not the case for most other bulk biofuels (biodiesel requires a lot of vegetable oil, and competes with the food supply). The downside is that you only get a bit lighter (losing hydrogen only) as you fly. 

You could conceivably make a relatively automated process to recycle/refine the powder using renewable energy, which is great for remote bases. Or make fuel onboard a nuclear carrier. 
Wonder what PETA thinks about this. 
You can convert the [hydrogen to ammonia](https://medium.com/@brysonmasse/cloud-storage-for-energy-is-here-5a24bc8ccbc#.yykysru10), which is about 70% more energy dense and liquefies at 250 psi vs 10,000 (basically propane tanks). You can reform back to hydrogen before the fuel cell, but you can also use [ammonia fuel cells](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292138426_A_Review_of_Ammonia_Fuel_Cells). 
You can't fit square pegs into round holes. But maybe take her to digital media art shows so she can see how programming computers can open up more options for art. It's always a good skill to have.
Remember how a significant number of software developers in the 60s were women? Then when video consoles came out (eg Commodore 64), much of the advertising was targeted towards boys. This carried over to personal computers such as the Apple II and the TRS-80, and then computing became male dominated. 

So boys are told that computers are fun things to play with, but girls are now told that they make good careers. I'm just now seeing people pushing girls to look at computers as fun.
