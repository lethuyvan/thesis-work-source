They'd rather fix "bugs" that make him playable and fun rather than fixing [actual bugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7slaad/patch_82_bug_megathread/dtdwegm/), love it
Love how they conveniently didn't change his mana at all, even though he definitely is affected by the changes, a lot

Thank you so much!
Just figured that out, but using "POWERCFG /H" in console gives me an error, nice!
I live in Austria unfortunately, I can't find any refurbished models for sale here. Thanks for the input!
Yes, that exact option does not exist on my machine.

The only options I have are "Power save" and "lock"
No battery icon on a desktop.

I know thats besides the point but its still doing fast startup, every time I turn on my PC I get the exact same chrome tabs I had open when I turned it off
"Color not supported" What the fuck are they smoking over there?
This doesn't work. 
This. I played league of legends and got the notification 4 times, right above the minimap which made me tab out when clicking on the minimap. 
Where do you disable this?

I'll definitely get my hands on a 2DS before buying it, but I heard hard covers can upgrade the feel somewhat. Glad to hear about performance, battery life is a big issue for me as well, especially since the dstwo actually uses a built-in processor to handle emulation!

You're right, a theory still has to be substantiated, while a hypothesis is merely a suggestion. All in all, still no idea why you got downvoted this hard. 
*huawaifu*
How did you downgrade? I miss it already.
It was basically having the URL bar at the bottom along with some features similar to Google now (news etc.). It was an experimental feature and could only be enabled using a flag, which is now unavailable.
*woosh*
Anybody figured out how to go into foundry form yet?
Evidence leads to conclusions, not theories. Theories are abstract and unfounded and depend on context, they don't require evidence. 

I mean understand what you're referring too and the downvotes are 100% unnecessary, just thought your original comment was funny.
Read that again, but slowly.
I am the yeast of thoughts and mind!

This got me permabanned. Don't be sarcastic.

Got permabanned with these games shown just an hour ago. Once you're on the shitlist it doesn't make much of a difference if you throw racial slurs at someone and suggest they should commit suicide or have a negative attitude all game and only use chat for passive-aggressive remarks. The second you get your first chat restriction is when you have to completely stop using chat at all. It's /fullmute all for me from now on.

Hm?
The last picture is absolutely insane
No idea how my first reply was in any way angry or impolite. I gave simple instructions in the form, you failed to read/understand them. I gave a straight forward time frame for when you can expect a reply, you didn't read/understand that either. 

Since I refuse to fight my way through another one of your text walls I'll just go ahead and block you for now. 

Good luck next time. 
Your question was "when".

Last paragraph of this post: 

>applications are open for about a month starting today, selection will then take a few more weeks

First paragraph of the form:

>This form is open for entries for about a month starting on April 4th. After that, selection will take a few more weeks.  

So there's your when.

>attitude to a person who you don't know

Your application was supposed to make me know you better, so that apparently didn't work out too well either. 

>Second of all, you should never dismiss an application just because of a question somebody has

I dismissed your application because I like my colleagues to have good reading comprehension, not because of your question. [Case in point](https://i.imgur.com/Qfti0mt.png)

But to answer your question:

1. Applications get read
2. Decisions get made
3. Moderators get added
Given that you didn't read

* the last paragraph of this post,
* the first paragraph of the application form,
* three of the instructions given on the application form,

consider your application dismissed. We will contact you with a more detailed explanation in a few weeks as written in the post and application form. 
No, it just seems like another stage of death to me.

[Yeah that seems about right](https://i.imgur.com/do73Mja.png)
Maybe my memory is weird. My account is 6 years old and I was chat restricted for the first time. I'm pretty sure I was at 1 at first because it didn't say "dishonorable". Now it does.

That's incredibly close-minded, counterproductive and not at all what this subreddit is supposed to be. What you're basically saying is that anything resembling content (discussion, suggestions, news, development etc.) shouldn't be on this subreddit.
We already have enough people for those tasks. Read the first sentence of the post again.

But he picked such a good name for his comeback 

^^BOR15
Thanks!
Underwhelming as a successor to the OPO, quickly forgotten. Caught in the middle of the CyanogenMod fiasco. Released the same year as the X, both were a financial shot into the leg for OnePlus. Took them years to recover, according to them.
That's the magic of having 14 fucking tires 
* This is an android-related subreddit, you have to own a Google account to use Android. If you don't have a Google account you're probably not what we're looking for.
* There is a separate option for collecting email addresses, I had it turned on by accident before. As you can see by the comment above, it adds an extra field at the start
* Duplicate entries also get prevented by checking IP addresses, and you have to enter your Reddit username obviously.
That would enable duplicate answers unfortunately. We don't see any info about the account, not even an email address.
Should be fixed now, thanks a lot!
Huh. Might connected with the "1 answer only" setting. I'll look over it, thanks for pointing it out!
What in the fuck.

How have I never seen this before
Pretty sure there are some things that can't be lifted otherwise, for example windmill parts, ferry parts or just in general very very big things. At some point it has to be more profitable to ship it with the 225 instead of using ships/trains, otherwise it wouldn't exist. They brought it back after being in storage for 9 years when the 124 wasnt big enough, so there has got to be a market for it.

Maybe you should put some energy into learning how to use Google then, instead of being salty about a light-hearted April fool's gag.

Also, good job ignoring the 10+ posts where you did get proper answers
Just spent a wipe in the deepest part of the snow biome, it's convenient cus nobody ever goes there but there's a bunch of things that were really annoying.

* You have to take off your metal gear or you'll freeze to death
* There are hardly any natural water sources
* Can't do much during the night cus of the cold
* Not much cloth

We had the sulfur quarry right next to our base running all day with 200+ ppl on the server. Nobody ever looted it.

Ich kenn es nur von Android, wo man z.b. in XML jeden Textinhalt als String speichern muss, damit es ggf. automatisch übersetzt werden kann. Scheint, als wäre das hier passiert, wobei der Platzhalter "Station" eben ein hardcode Platzhalter ist, und daher nicht übersetzt wurde.

Depends on the comp and how willing your teammates are. Taco says it's not a good soloQ item and LCS builds confirm that statement. Watching Team Liquid with ER Jhin and Swain was disgusting, so many longrange picks just with that W combo. If you're on bot with something like a Morgana, Welkoz or Zyra it can go very, very well.

I own project jhin but I really really like the sound design, colors and animation on blood moon jhin. The SKT one is probably the most underwhelming of them.

Flash it again, boot into it and check if you can access any of the device's storage by going to "install" and "select storage". If it's all at 0MB it's probably an encryption issue
YouTube wants to start making profit so they cut down on AdSense money significantly. I'm convinced a channel that big would've been able to support a small/medium-sized business to some degree, not to long ago. The whole adpocalypse thing definitely didn't help either.
It does, but that's not the one they posted in the forums from what I can see.

I mainly use it for local events, protests, concerts... Really no alternative I can think of. I have 40 friends but am not subscribed to one of them. Just news sites and local businesses on my feed.
Compromises. Everyone would love to have OIS, laser Autofocus, a zoom lense and a bigger sensor, nobody would pay 100€ more. Then OnePlus gets blamed for not listening. Rinse and repeat. 
I suggested having the same blind picture test (pick your favorite) that we did in Hamburg for everyone online. That obviously didn't go through

>As a kid I saw the socialist country that Austria became after the Soviets left. I love Austria and I love the Austrian people—but I always knew America was the place for me.

Presumably from the same piece you copied your quote out of, which is the first thing when typing "Arnold Schwarzenegger Communism Austria" into Google. 
I'll say this, Carl prefaced his arrival by mentioning how 2015, financially, was one of the roughest years they've had in the history of the company (OP2, OPX) and how they're just in a place where they can try more "risky" things again. That already seemed like a giveaway to me. He also said how hard it is to balance user requests, specifically now, where everyone is pushing for more screen but similar sized bodies, but don't want to embrace things like the notch. 

It made sense to me in that regard, but I still think, even though it's a clever design, that it's just a symptom of Android OEMs trying to do everything Apple does. That's what I told him as well. 

We also did a poll with raise of hands about the notch (like, dislike, indifferent), which seemed really evened out, surprisingly.

He's also been an advocate for capital punishment and thinks his native country (Austria) is a communist state. But we don't talk about that. Haha, tank.
Okay, what the fuck.

They have no control over the widevine thing, they are obligated by whoever is responsible for the thing to only do the update locally.

It didn't sound like they had any plans to implement project treble.
That's weird, I saw the codename "taco" for the OP2 floating around on XDA. I mean the connection is obvious, but isn't the OPX also "onyx"?
When you open the link on mobile the linked line is at the top.

This is honestly the first time I've heard about this suggestion. I know maybe one phone that had them in 2014 probably? Stop treating OnePlus like the enthusiasts wet dream that bends only to your niche, quirky feature requests that do nothing for the product other than boost the price. They made a loss in 2015 (op2, opx) that they're still recovering from and just said they are open for more riskier stuff again. Also, they stopped being an enthusiast brand when they made [this](https://youtu.be/mpQIDeu1DCE) and [this](https://m.gsmarena.com/oneplus_3-7995.php). 

So you're saying they added all this cool stuff that people requested but because of ignoring something almost nobody needs and nobody uses they don't listen to their customers? Bringing back OIS and laser AF is something people requested a lot in Hamburg, will be interesting to see if they listen.

I have no idea what "apologist" means. Thanks for downvoting all my comments though, that's exactly what that's there for. 
They do, try reading my comment again, but slowly. 

No idea why your second "point" would be remotely relevant to this discussion.
Won't be there, Carl explained in Hamburg that they degrade overtime similar to AMOLED displays (but much more noticeable obviously). 
"We want bigger screens!"

"Ok, here u go"

"wtf why notch fuck op"

"wtf no front facing speakers fuck op"

"wtf fingerprint on the back fuck op"

People here seriously need to learn basics of economy, design and compromises. Show me a phone that has everything mentioned above and is under 800$. If you're gonna complain all day at least make sense to some basic degree.
Yes. Carl said this in Hamburg as well. Something about degradation over time, like AMOLED displays.
For me, the ultimate sleeper car has to be the Volvo S80 V8 AWD. You should take a look at that.

I have no issue with the notch actually, I've used a smartwatch with a flat tire for two years now. It's a pretty decent solution. It's just a symptom of the underlying issue that's Android OEMs copying apple. They should know better and come up with something themselves.
Kevin was in our group and I had him looking over my shoulder for quite some time. When we were talking about the portrait mode, I pointed out that usually, the depth of field on most high-end lenses is so shallow, the blur starts at the ears already. This wasn't the case in some of the pictures we were looking at. Kevin basically replied "yep, we're working on that". 

I feel like that's a theme that stretched across multiple smaller software-related issues like that. It was either "yeah we've talked about this" or "we're working on that".

I missed some of the conversation about the oil paint effect unfortunately, maybe Timo can talk about that a little more. It was talked about very much, obviously. 


The 3 most suggested things were probably

* Bigger sensor
* OIS
* Telephoto lens

A lot off issues the 5/5T (and previous devices) had could be fixed with these things IMO and I hope OnePlus took notice. 
They were asked, Carl was there in the end for all general questions. I'm just having trouble remembering some of the answers and since I don't want to spread misinformation, I'm a little hesitant to reply. 
There was talk about the HAL which I didn't really understand much of tbh. I hope someone else can respond to this in a more comprehensive way. One of the reasons for not releasing the camera blobs was, if I remember correctly, that the encryption used would slow down everything anyway and leave the impression that the camera was slow. 
I'd check my pinky toe for suspicious behavior if I was you
Perfect, thanks!
Yeah we're gonna need a mod list

Since the instructions are specific to that upgrade path, I'd say it's safe to follow them. Maybe XDA has more answers for you.

Tried tugging the solar array yesterday, spent hours trying to get the winch.

One titanium missing for the winch. One aluminium missing for the vehicle bay. One compound missing for the rover. Died in a storm trying to get the winch back from the solar array. Rover flipped twice on the way to the array. Fuck everything about the driving in this game. Now the solar array doesn't move an inch away even though I dug it up completely (it was on the side of a mountain and fell down the slope). I'm seriously considering just running hundreds of extenders to my base by now.
Use magisk to root, it takes care of those things I think.
I doubt it, the patch they need your device for is probably something related to the SoC.

Insane finish, Sherrif went berserk. Such a deserved victory.
I understand and agree with your comment 100%, and again, I'm not picking sides here. I said "people left bad comments", me not included. The post is appropriate no matter the context. Have you thought about looking at what people wrote and try setting up automod filters? Easy to filter out vile comments and ban people before anyone even sees the comment. 
I thought this post referred to the two posts made by someone whose friend OD'd, and in the picture you can clearly see him removing antifa stickers from a street sign. The guy who posted the image then went on to say how brave his friend fought at some kind of freedom of speech rally (which was basically a white supremacist meetup). People came into the comments celebrating his death.

What I'm saying is, if people would know this post was about defending someone whose friend was a nazi, the comments would be very different because of Reddit's political bias. 
Wait, you really have no idea what I'm talking about?

I'm fairly new to kotlin and barely through half my udemy course but I have this idea on my mind and wanted to know if it's possible at all. 

Basically, a gridlayout of images based on SQL database entries that generates on create, meaning if there are 50 entries of people with their names and pictures in a database, I want those displayed in a scrolling grid, 2x50. 

* How advanced is the code for this (haven't looked into SQL in kotlin at all)?
* How does the layout generation look like, how do you set constraints in kotlin etc?
* Anywhere I can find an example of this working, any other ideas for a solution?

Thanks so much!
Bin vielleicht wieder dabei
Imagine the sound it'd make.

Uuuuuuugh get out of my heeeead
Well the point of the whole thing is to not depend on the manufacturers anymore. Phone repairs are different than tractor repairs. Like they said in the video, they have the parts and knowledge, but not the software access. 
I don't think this is about hardware reparability per se, it's more about access to software to guarantee longevity.

Since I brought up the example of OnePlus, let me explain. 

Hardware-wise OnePlus phones aren't more reparable in any way, they're glued-together metal slabs with built in batteries just like any phone from other companies. The issue is the other companies developing software solutions or barriers that hinder repairability. OnePlus has a rather open approach when it comes to their devices, meaning everyone can load anything they want on it. That's what you call unlocking a bootloader, which I can imagine, is similar to what the "eastern european software" described in the video was made for.

So what I'm thinking about is a tractor with kernel sources for its software published online, for everyone to take and develop their own software with, maybe even based on different sectors farmers are working in, and distributing it online to farmers. 

In the case of OnePlus, this guarantees phones can be safely used way beyond their life cycle, for example their first phone, the OnePlus one, is still receiving 3rd party software updates from a reliable group of developers [to this day](https://download.lineageos.org/bacon), on a weekly basis. 

Unlocking your bootloader means you get access to the internal storage's root directory, meaning you have access to everything that's stored on a device, including diagnostic tools and troubleshooting. 
Vielleicht sollte man mit dir angesichts des Alters deines Accounts eher auf Russisch reden, vielleicht verstehst du dann etwas von dem Geschriebenen. 

Inwiefern ein Kommentar, dass deinen sinnfreien, gescheiterten  Versuch, vom Thema abzulenken hervorhebt nicht zur Diskussion beiträgt ist mir ein Rätsel. Das Ziel hinter deiner nebenbei als Propaganda eingestuften Ablenkungsmethode ist, die Diskussion in eine andere Richtung zu lenken. Dies hervorzuheben habe ich mit meinem Link getan, tut mir Leid, dass du das offensichtlich nicht verstanden hast. Пока!

The worst ones are where it's the same or a similar font to the one used by the paper and you only realize halfway through reading it...

>Wait, how is a new cough medicine hitting the stores a news ar.... Oooooh. 
How realistic is it, now that farmers essentially turned themselves into "enthusiasts", to see other, smaller brands emerge and sell farming equipment? I'm thinking about something like the OnePlus of tractors.

EUW is fucked, just got thrown out of champselect for no reason, then thrown back in and got a dodge timer and lost LP. Now I can't requeue because "players are not ready". SoloQ btw. 
• Server: EUW

• Type of Bug: In game

• Description: Jhin reloads prematurely when reaching his 4th shot

• Video / Screenshot: https://streamable.com/70jao

• Steps to reproduce: Unknown

• Expected result: Jhin's 4th shot being available for its whole duration before reloading

• Observed result: Jhin reloading prematurely despite the timer still going

• Reproduction rate: Once every few games

> ppl aren't blank slates that can be programmed by being in a new country

Should we tell him about children? Education? 

> I was trolling

It was merely an act hurr Durr

Review bombing is wrong and defamatory, therefore illegal in certain regions. I still think UWE made the right choice.
The only reason arcane comet is decent is because of the other stuff in the tree. 

Manaflow is good in combination with dorans ring for bullying. Celerity is self-explanatory. Gathering storm gives Jhin a chance against AS-based hypercarries like Tristana, jinx, kog or vayne in late game.

I think fleet footwork gives something like 12 hp against minions on lvl 1?
Mid-Platin gets you within about 5% of the best players. That's pretty good in my book. I'd say a lot of people in gold have similar mechanics to plat players, but it's things like game sense, macro play, map awareness and teamplay that get you into the top 5%.

Once you get into diamond, there's an actual difference between being diamond 1 or 5.

Challenger is just something else completely. 
Be careful, don't rely too much on presets when it comes to builds and runes, at first it's perfectly fine since it's just one more thing to do wrong for newbies, but in the long-term you should probably explore each rune, item and skill to realize advantages and synergizing mechanics by yourself. 
Start playing and learn by yourself, utilize accompaning info on websites like these:

[champion.gg](http://champion.gg/) - Champion build/runes/leveling stats and info

[op.gg](https://www.op.gg/) - Detailed summoner/ladder info

[runeforge.gg](https://runeforge.gg/) - Common rune setups for each champion - regularly updated

Ghostblade into Statikk/RFC for me, then IE, GA and either last whisper or lifesteal
No idea why but megaman decimating dat boi cracks me up so hard
You're telling me Blank was the Jax in my team the other day? Gold 4 btw. 
EXTRA LARGE FALAFEL MEAL FOR TWO
This. My comment wasn't really serious, but if you check my [op.gg](http://euw.op.gg/summoner/userName=Kuppa) you'll see I played about 30 games at the start of this season with 100% crit and GA. Now I switched to Ghostblade, IE and statikk and while my KDA is dropping a bit it's definitely going better over all, especially against AS-based enemies like Tristana or Jinx. 
> yeah you should probably get that checked out
And RFC. And Statikk Shiv. 100% crit Master race, you guys have no idea what you're missing out on /s
Same was true for germany
My friend actually roasted his M10 trying to use a canon speelite, so yeah good point about flash compatibility. Everything from Olympus is also insanely overpriced, I think I paid 30$ for a lens hood for the 40-150. That's a quarter of the actual lens. Whaaat. 
I honestly think the M5 with the 12-40 (24-80) will shoot identical photos to something like a 6D with the 24-70mm. I actually got the chance to use that exact same setup for a day, helped me remember why I bought into MFT in the first place. 
The 12-40 has been on my amazon wishlist so long I actually saw it drop in price a couple of times. Still gonna be a while before I can afford it, but that's without a doubt my next purchase. 
I doubt I'll ever be able to afford that thing but thanks for the suggestion!
I was actually wondering what happened to him some time ago, then he uploaded the Q&A vlog with the APL cameo. Happy subscriber since then, glad he's still going strong. APL too obviously on twitch
Eh, I get a warning for unavailable network drives, that's enough for me

"Turn the knob to 240!"

"Changes altitude hold"
Wait, which property in the imagebutton do I set to match_parent? 
I'll see if that works thanks! I'll be back at least when I need it to create new imagebuttons within the wrapper based on SQL database entries. Hooray!
I'm trying to make a scrolling activity for a 2x40 grid of people like [this](https://i.imgur.com/F7np7R6.jpg) (just two per row) but can't seem to find a way to round off the corners for the image buttons. A solution on stack overflow only rounds the background, not the image itself. 
First for me was the Panasonic 25mm f1.7. 

Second was my Olympus 40-150mm 4-5.6.

Using an Olympus M5 Mk. 2 right now, coming from a Lumix G3. I love street photography so the 50mm eqv. was an obvious first buy. Still looking to upgrade to some fancier glass soon.
That's not how insolvency works. Or basic economics. Or game development. 
I keep getting ridiculous Pokemon knock-offs in unityads and AdSense, it's part hilarious part sad. Small developers getting their trailer footage stolen (banished, city skylines e.g.) really gets to me as well.
I wasn't trying to discredit Jhin's overall low winrate. It was just a comment on the side. Thanks for that cynical, toxic pile of garbage you just spew out there though, really sheds a bright light on this community.

Not sure if I understand that right, you're saying the timer is normal but the animation starts early? That's what I thought as well but he definitely reloads faster too. It's not just animation/sound.

Thanks a lot! Unfortunately, fakespot doesn't work with German amazon links yet.

Thanks, unfortunately fakespot doesn't support German Amazon links.

Edit: [LMAO](https://www.reddit.com/r/mallninjashit/comments/7r3f6o/rip_pockets/)
I admit I didn't read any of the reviews and only looked at the ratings. But I'll observe the product over the next few days since I suspect they'll remove the listing from amazon and put it up again to get rid of my review. 

Amazon support told me they'll look into the matter and I can send the thing back without hassle. 
Left a poor review already, but they'll probably pull the item from amazon, put it up again and fake some more reviews. Rinse and repeat. That's probably the reason why there are no negative ones yet. 
Its "original" price was 34.99. They faked a sale for Christmas and now it's where it should actually be, plus the reviews are clearly fake like I said, how is that not a scam?
Yeah, that would never happen on Reddit.

And here I was, thinking twitch couldn't possibly get any worse. 
That's because it's a high-wing configuration, pretty sure bombardier and antonov are the only companies left who build (bigger) aircraft that way, correct me if I'm wrong!

Literally the exact same aircraft. My sides. 
Exciting times! First PUBG, then Subnautica, now Rust...

>On Mar 18th 2017 The Aviation Herald received a draft of an EASA safety information bulletin, to be released shortly, stating: 

Please read through that section! One thing I learned from reading through countless avherald articles and watching pretty much every major aviation incident on youtube is that each and every incident leads to new regulation/procedures/rulings etc. It's a very gradual learning curve, but things are constantly changing for the better. 


Just FYI, these things are so big and heavy, they introduced a new callsign appendum exclusively for the A380 (and the 225 I think), all A380 flights have "super" attached to their callsigns during radio traffic, compared to e.g. a 747's "heavy". They're really really fucking big. 
Yeah absolutely! First time a game paid itself off for me with pure luck. Feels good. 
Eh, it'll go down a lot once all the other sell orders come in. I'm not the only one with 4 hours left. 
Thanks for the reminder, unfortunately it's still locked for 4 more hours!
The data recovery firm sent me a quote of around 2.000 € which is completely unrealistic for me and in relation to the files on the drive.

Theres a small chance it might work and the files aren't that important. I'll take the risk.

I'm afraid it's the 1TB one. The 2TB is a lot thicker I think!

Thanks a lot anyways!
I will, thanks!

Like I said, I thought buying an *early bird* key from the market would remove the market lock since the keys are over a week old at this point. I was also under the impression that that was the reason why there are any items for sale already. Apparently I missed something, considering my situation. 
Try reading my previous comments you condescending dyslexic twat.
Cool, danke! Hat das blaue Pittinger auch 10°? Hab gelesen dass "Schankbier" 11° oder weniger haben. Das schmeckt sogar ganz okay. 
Ah, too bad. 
I bought a key for 7$ on the steam market. It was an early bird key, which means the key itself was bought over a week ago, so the item shouldn't get trade locked. 

I got some glasses worth 20$ or something, so I would've actually made profit if they weren't locked for some reason. 
Kenn much nicht wirklich mit Stammwürze aus, welches Bier hat z.B. 10°? 
I got a case and tried opening it with an early bird key I got from the market, the item is still trade locked until 22/1? Anyone know what happened?

Looks like you know a lot more about android development than I do. I'll keep my eyes peeled. 
Again, read the article. The system app is in no way connected to the "clipboard" functionality baked into android. If it's a **new** system app, how do you think the clipboard has worked so far? 
It's a system app package just like any other.

>suspicious new system app "com.oneplus.clipboard"

And can be uninstalled as such. 

Please read the article before commenting, even if it's sensationalist clickbait garbage. 
Not really. Sold my entire CSGO inventory twice before quitting the game.

One thing that helped me overcome my fear of flying was taking a good look at a [flight radar](https://www.flightradar24.com/32.09,-66.77/3) just to get a perspective of how astronomically low chances of anything actually going wrong are. There's like 12.000 aircraft in the air right now.

It also includes the most accessible part of the Alps from Graz, the Schöckl, under the "farther away" section.

Absolutely! I've been watching videos on that channel for a while, mainly for the daily "road rage" compilations. It's 50/50 people being stupid/distracted and bikers looking for unnecessary trouble because they have the high ground while the camera is rolling. 

Very interesting in terms of getting to know different situations on the road and learning how to react. 

This is actually the first video from them I've seen in this style, and I'm just as torn as with the other uploads.

Bin auf jeden Fall dabei.
Reports don't go into modmail, that would be modqueue. 
Nope, that's not it and I hear it too!! This is actually the first time I've seen someone describe it. Initially, I thought there were tiny drops of liquid inside the vibration motor due to condensation, but I kept hearing it for days. Didn't hear it once while writing this, so maybe it'll disappear for OP as well.
You don't make any sense. Sober up and try again.
Ever heard of modmail? You know, the one thing specifically designed to get in contact with subreddit moderators?
FYI, PUBG's creator worked on mods for both ARMA2 and ARMA3 for years and literally spent his welfare checks on server costs before selling his idea to H1Z1 and eventually developing PUBG.

His delusions about the game being e-sports ready and the decision of putting the game out of early access for Christmas sales don't diminish the years of hard work, passion and love he put behind his vision. 

It's not a AAA cash-grab, it's about to hit 3.000.000 players playing **at the same time** and it'd deserve the award as well. 
Yeah because vocal minorities don't exist? Would anyone who is genuinely enjoying the game create a post about it? I know I won't and I can't identify with 95% of complaints on this sub. Your comment is retarded.
Yeah that's totally not spam

Also wenn du schon im flann reserviert hast isses wahrscheinlich besser wenns dabei bleibt, Office ist etwas kompliziert. Ich wär so oder so dabei wie gesagt ;).
Tagging /u/KlemensStrasser
Nein, hab ich auch schon gelesen. War zweifelsohne immer am Donnerstag dort.
Also es findet eigentlich immer statt, außer wenn sie was anderes auf Facebook ankündigen. Wäre also eine Überlegung wert!
Ich war die letzten Wochen hin und wieder am Donnerstag dort. Wegen Winterpause hab ich nichts gelesen, werd Mal fragen.
Es gibt einen Nichtraucherbereich. Ich kenn jemanden der reservieren könnte. Kann mich nicht erinnern, dass es im Flann jemals weniger voll als im Office war. 
Da wär ich auf jeden Fall dabei obwohl ich fast das Office vorschlagen würde wegen Pub quiz am Donnerstag!

You're welcome, and so is your beard. Please keep posting. 
https://i.imgur.com/y8yp6kR.png

You know what? Fuck off. If you seriously think we're removing a post based on someone's political opinion expressed in another community maybe you should just not go on this site at all.

I'm completely irritated about why I have to type this right now, it should be so obvious how fucking irrelevant someone's political views are on a **god damn subreddit for beards**. 

Stop treating party allegiance like a fucking sport, seriously. Show some basic common sense and keep this garbage off my modqueue. 
Ooooh I remember now, thanks! Didn't even realize you guys were based in Germany. Liebe Grüße!
I can't find the old name your search engine had, maybe you didn't even change it. Would you mind telling me whether or not you did and what the old name was again?
Keep up the good work guys. My mom has been using Ecosia since before your name change, glad to see you pop up here. 

Unfortunately, I am hugely reliant on the Google ecosystem as a whole and with that, its machine learning capabilities. I wish you guys had the chance to catch up, at least someone in my family has made the right choice. 
There is no such thing as "title gore" on this subreddit, only "bad headlines/clickbait". Read rule 1.
Does anyone know if EU lawmakers commented on the whole situation? Still not sure what to expect from the next few years. ISPs in my country are currently spreading the lies that their networks are "at full capacity" and they need to raise prices for expansion. Really worried that they're looking at the US with dollar (or euro) signs in their eyes.

From what I know, autopilot is mostly used during flight to keep the plane on a certain heading, altitude and vertical speed, take off and landing are usually done by hand. There's a lot of things to do apart from navigation (flaps, gear, spoilers, brakes, thrust reversers). I'm not sure if autopilots are this advanced yet.

Same here. I can immediately taste when something has too much pepper in it. One time me Kebap guy put in the wrong sauce without me noticing and I was pretty much knocked out for the day. 

Shit's weird when you haven't eaten anything remotely spicy for 20 years. Still not sure if that's a good or bad thing.
Oh man I had a good laugh at that when I first saw it on 9gag 5+ years ago
What the fuck happened to her anyway?
I just finished it and would love to know what moment you're talking about.
Right now it's not locked, surprisingly. But good on you for donating, as someone who uses Wikipedia regularly but is too broke for donations, I really appreciate it.
The single most locked Wikipedia article in history.

Gotcha. Lots of things I haven't considered. Thanks for the reply!

Also thanks for using Reddit as a more sophisticated platform to talk with your viewers, some of your YouTube comments are getting rather... Repetitive. Let's just keep it at that. 
No idea! I'm just not a movie guy I guess. I get the references and whatnot, but I never got an incentive to sit down and watch that movie instead of (for example) playing video games. 
Pulp fiction and back to the future!
Hey Doug, sorry for the mildly unrelated question; have you ever considered upping your production quality a bit? I feel like you make many rookie mistakes while filming your videos - talking about framing, white balance, cuts, general cinematography. Maybe you should hire a semi-professional production crew for one episode and see if the difference/response is worth it?

Keep up the good work, you're an awesome dude.
You're a fucking genius 
Do all commercialy used airplanes alert pilots if they're below a certain altitude without their gear down?
Okay, I think I understand where you're coming from now, thanks for giving an alternative viewpoint. But one question for me remains: How come Europe has both single player healthcare across all countries and a competitive, yet regulated ISP situation? At the moment, I'm paying 40€ for unlimited data, 80/10 speed and 6GB LTE mobile data with unlimited calls/texts. With Christmas season coming up, I reckon I could switch my contact yet again to whatever ISP is cheaper while still enjoying complete net neutrality. 

I don't pay anything for healthcare yet since I'm still attending school.
Boo hoo. Just wait until ISPs wherever you're from realize how much fucking money they can make with this shit. This isn't about giving governments the power to control every aspect of internet traffic, this is about giving them the power to prevent ISPs from fucking you over. Internet censorship in China didn't start with a push for net neutrality. 

Did I mention the EU has kept up the same regulations on net neutrality ever since the internet was a thing? Slovenia and the Netherlands even introduced stricter rulings as well. You don't hear a lot about government censorship and restricted internet access from Slovenia, do you? 
Yeah, good luck changing your ISP when every local alternative has been bought by big players like Comcast. That's not how it works in the US. Having no internet so you can tell yourself at night that you voted with your wallet is not an option.
What? That's communism, get da fuck out of here with that shit. ^^/s

[There it is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_law#China)

> Empirical studies have found that China has one of the most sophisticated content-filtering Internet regimes in the world. The Chinese government employs increasingly sophisticated methods to limit content online, including a combination of legal regulation, surveillance, and punishment to promote self-censorship, as well as technical controls.

~~One more reason to prevent this from happening in the US.~~

NN repealing laws in the US work as a precedent for ISPs in other countries to push for similar changes once they see how much money Verizon etc. are making with this. I believe there's almost nothing you can do for the US, outside the US. I tried donating to Bernie Sanders last year but they explicitly said they couldn't take foreign donations due to legal problems. Not sure if this applies now, but I personally wouldn't risk it. 
Net Neutrality is the cornerstone of innovation, free speech and democracy on the Internet.

Control over the Internet should remain in the hands of the people who use it every day. The ability to share information without impediment is critical to the progression of technology, science, small business, and culture. 

Please stand with the public by protecting Net Neutrality once and for all.
