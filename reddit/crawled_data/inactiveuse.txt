Hopefully that day'll come when he has a WDC under his belt and like 10 years from now
Deadass b
Yeah I'm in the same boat with you. I think he can be as good as the other WDC contenders but he's basically fighting himself right now. I mean Ricciardo showed us how to win smartly in that race. If Max just learns to stop tripping himself up, he could go far.
It doesn't make it completely better but it does show there is some progress in comparison to last race where he didn't accept any blame at all. I don't know if it'll change and hopefully it'll change for the better. They can't keep hiding behind the excuses and maybe this is a sign for change, but for all I know I can be wrong.
Looks great! What desk is that?

What the 5m did you just 5ming say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the 5m out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my 5ming words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, 5mer. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre 5ming dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your 5ming tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre 5ming dead, kiddo.

Does anyone have a link to when Rush said that? I can't stop laughing 
Honestly this is one of the big reasons why I'm not looking into a V20. I've seen so many stories on how theirs a bootloop problem and abysmal customer service who are are not fixing a problem that has persisted through many phones.
Its not that bad of a song, but its more of something I'd listen to on the side. The problem is that its not very hype in general and even worse when compared to Imagine Dragons's Warriors. If anything when I saw Zedd, I expected something similar to Clarity. Don't get me wrong its still a good song
Right now its a bit buggy. Their are some fps drops when full screening apps and the battery life and the OS speed so far is about the same for me.
