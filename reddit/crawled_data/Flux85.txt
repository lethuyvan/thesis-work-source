Lol how the hell do you not see that it’s fake. How would sound play from it? 
Holy shit this would be amazing 
White people do shit like this but cross the street when they see a black or Hispanic dude. 
HUMAN ON A BIKE = CYCLIST. NEXT!! 
I will continue saying that. 👍🏼
If your job has you staying at different locations then those hotels will have gym rooms. 
Zombies are tired and played out.
Use DND, are you trying to cheat on your girl or something? 
Lol how is this even a valid answer in your mind
Never forget your culture my dude. Take pride in it.
C’mon dude no excuse to not have a glass cover on that. 
Salty PlayStation fans downvoting this.. 😴
No it’s not. Speak for yourself and yourself only dude.
Just set it to auto renew..or are you too young to be able to do that? 
Get rid of it. A dog would never do this to you unless they had rabies because they actually consider us as friends. Cats are just little anxiety machines with hair triggers. 
It’s a prank bro 
wat. Maybe I’ll buy 🤔
Huawei sounds like the sound an anime character makes when they stub their toe 
That watch looks like a cartoon watch and not because of the wallpaper. Big ass circle on a tiny wrist just looks comical. 
There’s a slim chance of somebody holding your baby and then flinging it onto your roof like a pizza. So whatever you say. 
🖕🏼
Why are you standing like that. Just stand normal. 
No, I need my phone with me lol.
wat
Did that just chub you up?
If I’m able to browse reddit, I’m able to pull my phone out. Can’t think of any scenario where I’d ever prefer to browse on my watch screen. 
Lol wow yet another Call of Duty that I’m not buying. Is activision retarded or what 
Durr hurr hurr oh em gee what a knee slapper this post was 🙄😴
heheheee
Does this apply to Apple Watch? Because I just put on one of those annoying ass screen protectors where you have to wet and then squeegee it on. 
Still going strong on my 6S. :) What Androids from 2015 are still viable today and receiving regular updates?
It wouldn’t kill it, just restart lol. Android users would still be suffering right now by the way waiting for their forgotten model to be patched, if ever. ✌🏼 
Buy a head unit with USB, you can even buy one that does Car Play, and simply connect to it via USB. It’ll charge as it plays/does whatever. 

Edit: and it’s relatively cheap to pay a shop to install it for you. You can buy one off Amazon that you like and google a local car electronics/audio shop and just have them install it.
Cute, but patched immediately months ago. Something Android users wouldn’t be accustomed to. 😉😘
Kids don’t need this. Buy them something cheap. 

Like seriously the more I thought about it the more it irked me. It’s your money so do what you want obviously but what use will kids have for this? It’s a grown up piece of tech not a fisher price toy. Buy them a $10 dollar Casio dude.
If it’s fastened to a stud it’s fine. Stop exaggerating lol.
Thanks for the pic brotha. I think I’ll just leave the screen protector film on.
Why do android phones take such terrible blurry pics? 
Lol no 
(👁 ͜ʖ👁) 

How much for Apple care? 
You’re welcome, you’ll make a fine lady one day 
The way you had your back arched with that dude plowing your butthole was very feminine. A+
Says the dude thirsting over a fat girl 🐷
Lmao what’d you expect. You bought a stolen watch from a shady place. Save and buy new dude.
No, because you’re going to continue using Android and I’m going to continue using my iPhone. 

Enjoy the rest of your day. ❤️
😂 for people that are so sure about their choice in smartphone, you kids sure love getting triggered and bent out of shape. Add this to the reasons why I would never want to be associated with you ridiculous fanboys.

iPhones always outperform android phones, period. What good is the hardware if the software can’t take advantage of it since every model is so freaking different? There’s a reason why iPhone always has the best user experience, and why apps always run BEST on it.

Idiot. 
🐮🐮🐮
Playable games.
Consistent updates.
Not having your phone model being forgotten about 3 months after release

Etc
Sorry for your loss. 
Imagine having a girl so fine you wear a go pro on your head when you fuck 
Take that stupid cow ring outta your nose 
Why the fuck did you blur your face and tits lmao 
Just buy new next time. Not worth the hassle.
This is why I’m getting a case for my watch.
“Hurrrr screaminggggg ommmgggg” shut up
Would’ve been perfect if it said Gameboy Advance
God android emojis are terrible 
Close it all the way you idiot. 
No, you’re not.
I have thousands upon thousands of karma you might as well be a gray pube on my gooch.

Oh, and I’m still right. 😘
This is a stupid submission. Stop trying so hard. 

Edit: HAHA the mods removed it. Downvote all you want but I was RIGHT 
This is bs. It’s very clear, you must not know how to listen or read.
So you’re gonna get me all chubbed up and then just stop talking huh (👁 ͜ʖ👁) 
Congrats. You’re a real boy.
It’s MESMERIZING! Red!!
You are prone to to downvote
The developer killed it by not making it 64 bit you genius.
Yeah I loved AC Origins but I did enough side missions to be strong enough to progress and beat the main story. There’s so many side missions left over.
“Calm down” - Guy Mesmerized by the color Red

Lol
Really? Mesmerized? Over a red iPhone? I wish I was that easily amused.
Leave it to Reddit to white knight for the girl. Wouldn’t expect anything less. 
It just looks like a regular Gameboy lol. Should’ve left the name on there.  
Done and done. What a weird design of a gas cap smh 
https://i.imgur.com/JHKPVAz.jpg

Yeah I put gas in, tightened til it clicked and it came off lol. I can still tighten the actual cap it’s just more annoying to get a grip of. Figured I’d ask before I bought a replacement.
I wanna play the xylophone on her rib cage with my dingaling while I motorboat dem titties

Setting a wallpaper is enough for me. I don't want stupid resource hogging dynamic themes.
I still gotta get around to watching that. Is it on Netflix?
I hate people like that dude. 
I still have pics on mine from middle school in the late 90's.

Fucking weird how I just finished the last episode and the news breaks immediately after. 
I've actually killed flies with rubberbands before though. Never been lucky enough to shoot one out of the air though.
This is why I'll always buy new. 
I imagine that wouldn’t even be salvageable. Would probably disintegrate and break like peanut brittle if it was moved.
Wtf? I’m at 83% capacity and says mine is fine.
The thing I love with these is that somebody exists somewhere that’s stupid enough to do this.
It was at this moment, that Flux85 felt old as shit 👴🏼 
Just an old dusty clone.
Mine does the same thing. Who cares what it says you’re still getting the text in real time.
That’s pretty neat

Red Dead Redemption also got 4K XB1X support. It’s gorgeous.
Conker and all the Star Wars games will be mine 
These back compat titles will make a fine addition to my collection.
Yeah you have fun with the handicap version lol. 
Ah yes this chubs me up immensely
Cool but then what happened? Did they have enough for the entire village? What’d they tell the troopers? “Now strip down naked and walk away so we can use your helmets as drums?”

There are good and bad people the same way the dark and light exist. *And all the shades in between.* It’s a spectrum. There’s good in the bad, and bad in the good. It’s also basically what the yin and yang stands for.

You sound like a young kid that’s never gone through any drama. Ever been cheated on? Had someone steal from you? Had anyone hit your car and run? Had anybody attempt anything malicious towards you, period? 

The thought of you trying to lecture anybody on good/evil is adorable. Go and let life humble you over some more and see if you still sing the same tune in a few years. Lol 
You’re naive as fuck if you don’t believe that there are bad people in this world. 
It looks like you fit a big slice of American cheese over it
Don’t be a dick.
Knowing them they’ll force a gay relationship between Will and Jazz. 
6th grade for me was 1996. You’s a baby.
Some people are just inherently bad no matter how much you try to justify it. A bad apple is a bad apple and no amount of researching is going to un-rot that apple. You just accept that they no longer serve a purpose and their physical matter and DNA must be discarded. 
The only thing that makes these submissions worse is when the loser pays actual money for tinder gold. 
Wtf. Why would you allow that. That’s like letting somebody read a random late chapter in a book they’ve never heard of.

You look like a fragile whimpy little runt of a kid. You don't even have any hair on your face. The only tit you've seen was the one you still suck on. Be humble little boy.
Do you even have a $20 in your wallet? Do you even own a wallet? Ask your mommy to drive you to Walmart for a job. You're begging for free xbox trials online. Stupid pathetic kid. 
Get a job you little free loader.
Over the road trucker? Why’d you have to specify the road part? Are you from the future where there’s hover trucks?
Wack. I want to punch every suburban kid that thinks these are funny. Probably upvoting this garbage after drinking a sugar free Capri Sun and eating a plain gogurt. 
Modding Gameboys is a thing 
That’s because Fallout purposely uses the 50s vibe in their games.
That’s soap you dumb bitch.
Oh shut up lol 
The same one that makes everyone in a foreign region speak English. It’s the Animus, and as such, you can tweak the experience to the users liking. 
Have you been behaving online OP 🙂
What the hell is wrong with you lol you sound like an insecure little girl.
White people age like avocados. I’m always amazed at how old these 20 something year old white girls all look like they’re in their 40s.
How the fuck did you get this far in life without learning how to make sure all the piss is out of your dick you Neanderthal? 
F’goot
Lol stop exaggerating. 
I don’t want a stupid curved screen and I don’t want my phone registering unintended touchless gestures
This has gotta be the most boring and driest starter pack I’ve ever seen. And it has upvotes. 🤦🏻‍♂️ 
Lmfaooo good lord. Destiny truly is dead
We hear you loud clear. What you really need is a plain ghost with a shitty neon glow with the most boring perks conceived by man. Now stop bitching at us we’re trying to figure out where to build our summer homes with all the preorder sales we made from you chumps.

Love, Bungie ❤️ 
Yeah no shit. Apple never advertised Siri as an OS dude. It’s just a side feature to be able to use voice commands. 
The only time I use Siri is when I’m in my car and I use the “call ____” command and it works every time. Stop trying to make Siri be this sci-fi artificial intelligence like you see in movies because it’s definitely not lol.
Lmao pathetic 
Peasant.
Yeah!! Girl power! Someone send the hunchback blue haired tumblr feminist to ring the bells! Zelda is a woman hear her roar!!

Switch to Android where they never support their devices for more than a few months you weirdo 
So cool seeing a squad of Spartans in Player One.
I got lucky and bought my famicom micro off Amazon new for $80 once upon a time
Because it ruins your chance at your obvious double dip for link and comment karma. 
Clean your nails.
I’ve had similar issues with mine. It’s a desk too hard drive in an enclosure, always worked fine til I got my X. I changed the setting to permanently leave the drive on even when the Xbox is off. Seems to have done the trick so far.
No one says “phat” anymore. It didn’t survive.

Messages are saved to iCloud so you can access them like say when you get a new iPhone. For people that don't already do local backups to their computer and rely on iCloud.
The word you're looking for is slang, not slogans.
Consider for a moment that languages have dialects. I'm PR and if I hear a Mexican, Dominican, Colombian, etc speak Spanish I don't laugh at their accent or way of speaking it I just understand it's because of where they're from. Ignorant dick.
My 6S is at 84% and I'm as cool as a cucumber. Yall need to find hobbies if you're obsessing about your battery not being 10000000%.
lol fuck you and that author.
lmao is that author your dad or something? Of course I remember the books by their covers but I never cared to remember who wrote them. The only author I remember was RL Stein for Goosebumps. 
I'm in my 30s tf does that have to do with anything? I'm suppose to know a childrens book author to books from elementary school?
How do I know if its revision B? And yeah the DMG.
Who the fuck is shel? 
Working fine on mine. Safe to jump in IMO.
Carplay will definitely allow you to use your iPhone when it's connected. I actually prefer to navigate my playlists off my phone rather than my head units display.
That one is cool too. Wish the image loop was as high a quality as the anime girl studying/writing though.
Can anyone confirm this plays nice with Carplay?
The quicker the trash people weed themselves out of your life the better.
Don't "*when you get married*" and "*my wife*" me lol. Been there done that. If you know that you're able to have free time away from each other then clearly the message wasn't meant for you. 
Then freaking say so. Grow a set of balls and tell your girl you need some alone time. That's some high school shit to just assume that you're obligated to be up each others ass 24/7.
No. Betas are betas for a reason. You're not suppose to "daily drive" betas, you're suppose to report bugs as a beta tester. Not sit there thinking it's some sort of premium update service where you get exclusive access to all the newer features before anyone else. Idiot.
lol this shit is so fucking frustrating. I miss dropping in as my Titan, with my primary hand cannon, my *secondary* shotty, and my trusty rocket launcher dropping in via my "death from above" perk Supermanning down onto a cluster of adds as my fireteam breathes a sigh of relief.

Fuck Bungie for taking away one of the few games I enjoy.
It's time to break up with Destiny you guys.
How do you guys justify the cruel killing of organic plant life then?
I came upon that youtube page 6 months ago and I love it so much. That one stream with the anime kid at the desk is so peaceful to me.
You sound like a freaking brat. Grow up and learn how to talk like two grown adults. Life is too short to be throwing tantrums about getting laid. Talk until both of you figure that shit out.
God damn y’all are so corny on this app. Might as well be hooking up on Christian mingle with these wack ass jokes. Good lord. 
No honey this is for a church! NEXT!
Wow. People like this need to be put on meds and/or admitted to a psych ward.
Sweet voluntary home wire-tapping kit bro.
FYI, I am NOT preordering D3 until MULTIPLE outlets report that you didn’t regress and undo all the progress you’re making on D2 the same way you people caught a case of amnesia with D1. Actually, I won’t purchase the game period. 

Let’s see how y’all improve the game. It’s bullshit to still be waiting this long after you guys hyped up being able to push updates so quickly on this version that D2 was built on. 


A picture of a case. 😒
Carrier pigeon android texts being migrated to iPhone = glitchy times 
After they release D3 with all their progress undone again.
And the crowd goes mild 😴
Can’t let the government know he watches Japanese Panty Adventure and trap hentai
I have never witnessed such unwavering loyalty to a stupid phone case. Weirdo.
If you don’t have seven speakers and a subwoofer it is NOT real 7.1 sound. Stop falling for that gimmick.
No it’s not. Not even remotely close. 
Lol NYC will forever be relevant, that’s why everyone always copies us. Go keep jerking yourself off in whatever trailer in the woods you came from worthless hillbilly. 
This girl is clearly from NY and Hispanic, what does this have to do with white people?
It’s been common since at least the 80s/90s. You’re just a suburban kid experiencing NY slang thanks to the internet. 
Fortnite is basically just running away panicking building random walls and floors with weird physics while spraying and praying. 
Don’t get sent to HR over flirting at work dude. 
Oh no I better delete my comment quick! 🙄
Shut the hell up.
Ugly. You’ll have a hideous old mans leather shoe/wallet in no time. 
This is a troll post. It looks phenomenal on my X. You fucked something up on your end if you’re insisting this is true.
Gay.

**FROGS**.
Becky no. *it hit me so hard*
I hate these memes made by suburban Starbucks drinking preppy girls. Everything always “hits them hard”
OP, the X came with a stand. Why aren’t you using it? 
Lmao how is that a nasty comment? Did you give birth to those leather cases? Are they your offspring? 
From scratched up toy to an old mans stinky leather shoe. Don’t see the appeal of these.
Don’t care dude congrats. You’re not doing anything on an Android that an iPhone doesn’t already do better lol. 
*laughs in constant updates because apple doesn’t abandon their phones after a few months*
Except when I have to send a carrier pigeon text to an android user. 
Today, you are euphoric. This calls for a round of tendies.
Such refined tastes! 
A HIND D?
Definitely not from a Jedi...
I guess if you’re in elementary school. 
Lol people think they’re gonna get a Switch for $30 and games for $5
Lol you pay for tinder gold 
Oh we haven’t reached the singularity yet. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) That’s when the real fun will begin. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

This was fucking stupid. Good lord.
Oh man contact their PD right away so you can personally fly out and retrain that police officer. I know you’ll show him the right way to do his job.
Popular in your local town =/= popular nationwide 
Next post “guys Nintendo suspended my account for making a Nip shirt” 
Expert number 2 has entered the battle, surely you’re going to contact that police officer and retrain him in his job, right? 
33 whole hours! Wow what a hardcore gamer you are. It’s okay to have wrong opinions little guy. 
“MUH PATINA!” Please dude. Don’t gate keep a lame ass phone case. Acting like you have such refined tastes because you know how leather works lol get outta here. 
Thank you. These things are hideous. Why make your expensive device look like an old mans dirty old wallet. 
I love how everyone becomes an expert in other peoples jobs online. Stfu dude. 
Sweet Nip shirt bro
Who the fuck drinks milk with their steak 
Not right now it’s not. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
Lol why would you switch to feeling bad for them? They should be learning in a parking lot or a quiet suburban road not a busy intersection. 
I just gave up and shoved my Kinect in the basement when I got my X. I only used it for voice controls on video play back. Not worth the space it took up. 
Stop using Wi-Fi and connect via Ethernet cable.
Lol at the idea of finishing a Monster Hunter game.
Enjoy your ghost town of a population lol.
It’s fun. I play solo and logged over 200 hours so far. There’s an SOS flare you can shoot if you need extra people to join in to take a monster out that you might be having trouble with.
How can you have an opinion on something you obviously didn’t play for more than a few minutes let alone understand at all? Delete this post dude. 
Your grandpa jerked it to horse dick pics lol. It’s okay, having the super man image of elders you once respected being destroyed by their weird fetishes happens more often than you think.
And then did an audience appear out of no where to applaud your daughter while fireworks and pyrotechnics went off behind her as the religious lady melted into a pile of goo? 
Wtf is so funny about that 
Omg so quirky 🙄 
Na dude it’s okay for people to have wrong opinions.
Oh I don’t care about that, the more noise we make the better lol. And I hear you on that, I’m sure your Xbox is fine hopefully they just address it already. 
Yup brought this up a week ago:

https://reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/83h7lp/why_on_the_xbox_one_x_is_ui_lag_still_a_thing/

Would be nice to hear from the devs if they’re gonna do anything about it instead of pretending it doesn’t exist.
Can anyone explain the blue hues? 
And do we know of an alternative? Got lucky when Digg went down that Reddit was already known. What’s the equivalent this time in 2018?
It’s almost like it’s a video game of some kind.
Why did you post a pic of your hamster?

Why did you ask about dumpster diving?

Why do people do anything? 
Wait, do you really think the original post is a tribute to black panther? You can’t be that retarded.
So many games to play and experience.. Monster Hunter World and Assassins Creed Origins are my top games I'm playing right now. It's hilarious likening this to being in a toxic relationship because I even went into my game capture browser and deleted all my Destiny 2 captures. It's sad how disgraced this game has become. It use to be my favorite game to play with over 2,000 hours played in D1.. D2? Barely a fraction of that played.. 
lol why in the blue fuck did you think it was a good idea to pick up a flower from a tropical chinese forest and throw it in your tea?
"Why were they filming?" Because dude recording probably saw her nodding off. Second post I've seen in 2 days where a perfectly reasonable post was submitted here. 
And the trippy dimension from Interstellar
Again, why would you purposely handicap your gaming experience? This is more for parents that don't want their kids to see dongs made of blocks by people in games. It's harmless dude.
Omfg freaking tell us what the message was dude
I can tell you went to a suburban school. Our food never looked like that. 
And now he’ll respawn as a potato 🥔 
Jesus Christ you have such a poor understanding of what that means. You’re not giving anything up! It’s just letting you share things you create IN GAMES with other players as intended and vice versa. I don’t know why you think you’re protecting anything by purposely handicapping your gaming experience. User generated content is a major part of playing a lot of games. 
Lately with mine, if I pick anything that’s in my external drive I’ll get a message saying it couldn’t load so I wait for the drive to spin up and I select it again and it works fine. 

Before I never had to wait for the drive to spin up it was just always ready to go. 🤔
Pathetic. 
Yes this will make a fine addition to my collection ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
Now this is pod racing ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
OP, what was your mentality when you submitted this on here? 
Any firmware updates for your head unit?
This is why I always use USB for CarPlay 
This is where the fun begins 
Black flag is definitely my top favorite 
Durr hurrr 
That’s not all the story is to me. I love Egypt, I love ancient alien theory, I love conspiracy theory, and it’s interesting how they weave our reality with science fiction. That’s the reason why I like the AC franchise. It’s easy to take any movie/game and reduce it down to a basic story archetype to make it sound lame. Nothing is ever that black and white.

Lol why downvote me. “That guy likes a game and takes joy in playing it, fuck that guy” 
You must be 10 kinds of special. Best assassins creed yet. You’re probably too young to comprehend the story.
What base station? My halo edition ones didn’t come with whatever that is.
**WHEN PEOPLE/COMPANIES SAY MOBILE THEY MEAN SMARTPHONES.** Not handhelds. Knock it off dude.
On behalf of me and other people still on yesterday gen iPhone’s, I’d like to thank you for beta testing the X for us. 
Why did you add a blur effect to your face though?
We’re the same age and I liked it. Be more open minded instead of wanting the original trilogy regurgitated in different forms over and over. I guarantee you that you’ll change your mind in a few years same way people now love the prequels.
You realize anything and everything shows up on /r/all right? Especially if it’s your default view? Doesn’t make you any less of a freeloading pig. 
Do it on your own like the rest of us you freeloading pig.
I’m not the one being a little bitch about the movie. The butt hurt comes from fragile Star Wars newbies like you. I loved the movie and it brought me joy. 
I’m not the one being a whiny little bitch about it lol. I loved the movie and it brought me joy. Look how sad and salty some of you are. Pathetic.
Stop looking at Star Wars through the filter of Luke Skywalker. There’s a whole fucking universe out there. Luke was trained kinda late in the game. Usually they’re trained from when they’re kids and already showing signs of being proficient in the force.
It was a good movie and you need to get over it. 

Lol @ the butthurt. **It was a good movie to me and none of you salty fake fans will ever change my mind about it .** 
Why in the world do you only have 16GB storage?
Amazed that no ones mentioned The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild 
There are tales of hybrids that use to live in Egypt. Half man half beast. Ancient Aliens covered it in an episode or 2. Interesting to hear about, at least for the entertainment value.
Oh you built both Yoda puppets? Amazing.
Lol stop exaggerating.
Can’t relate, all you children need to get off my lawn
Bro you’re right. Just drop your pants and present your anus to the dude that hit you and become his wife. 
Yeah better to chase the dude that hit you and hug him while telling him how sorry you were for getting in his way 
Jesus Christ why the fuck can’t any of you see that this was just meant to be a joke? The amount of saltiness is insane. 
Yep PS4 controllers look like lame Logitech controllers. Xbox really outdoes PlayStation in that department, their controllers are superior.
You probably come from a quiet suburban neighborhood where you think every major city looks like Detroit in the Robocop movies.
Why the fuck are you sticking up for the dude committing a hit and run? 
No. Those are just the games you’ve played the least so they’re moved there. Why are you nitpicking how it sorts games? 
It says *last 30 days* meaning, it’s showing you what you’ve played in that time window. **Not** what you played 30 days ago.
Looks clear to me. You sure your eyes are okay?
You’re coating your lungs with something less harmful than tobacco smoke, but it’s still bad.
You’ve been activated OP. They’re trying to tell you to report for duty right **now**.

I’ll stick to playing it in 4K on my Xbox One X thanks. 
Grow up.
Same here, the autocorrect use to be so good now it’s just infuriating sometimes.

Oh okay cool 

Hahah that’s what you get for spamming 
Enjoy your L.
Oh I must’ve missed the part where he aged 30 years in Empire and became an instant master of the force over night. Was it before or after Obi Wan told Luke to go to Yoda to train in the force? 
Why would I use this over a regular alarm again?
Lol you know jack shit about Star Wars or you would’ve known that Leia was always force sensitive.
Man I can’t wait for the 4K Blu Ray 
They’re not suppose to look like they belong, they are outfits lifted directly from their respective games as a novelty. 
Are you some fat cow from the south? Or just a dude that’s never touched a woman?
Are you gonna delete this post later and repost tomorrow to see if anyone will coddle you then?
**MUH PATINA**
?? Recording has nothing to do with it. You just take a screenshot lol. 
Do you not know how to do real screenshots?
Do you use the pride camel unicorn as your mount too? 
I don’t even remember the plot lol. I just remember finishing it and saying finally I can uninstall this. 
Eh, I mean I’ll put an assassins logo vinyl sticker on my car. But I’m not gonna get it tatted on my body for the rest of my life lol. 
Lol why is this question being asked like if single player gaming was abnormal.
And with this switcheroo we score one for the tumblrina feminists! Yay girl power! 

🙄
No it’s the midichlorians you hippy.
That’s a very today answer tf you mean lol 
Loading games isn’t the issue. That works fine. It’s the UI. 
Poor optimization is a thing dude.
Stop echoing the internet bs my network and connection are fine I have 100mbps down every single thing I have connected to it works fine. 
Lol how the hell do you figure.. Mustang literally brought the 69 body shape back from the dead and are the ones that started the modern day muscle renaissance.
Take the L and go to sleep you dork.
I bet you’d eat a girl out after she got nutted in and brag how wet you had her lol.
How many games/apps do you have? 
Lol no, it’s not.
Exactly why tf would anyone make their phone purposely hard to look at. 
It’s a BS corporate post. Has everyone looking at a nasty cliff bar. 
Mines definitely plugged into the wall.
What a hideous noisy wallpaper. Jesus. 
It’s called taking a piss while pretending to have a seizure 
Asked the virgin from his uncles lap 
How sheltered are you?
For the millionth time that’s a hookah not a stupid ass vape. 
You’re a freaking weirdo.
Would switch even be able to handle it. The iPad Pro is more of a beast than the switch is. Imagine the limited draw distance. 
( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)
Holla @ me if you need some stress relief baby girl
Shh the sun is setting. Woosah.
Calm down.
Find a decent paying job, save money, and be a good person. You'll attract the right people into your life who will open the doors you seek to walk through as long as you keep your eyes on the prize. So try to stay out of debt, try to make the best decisions, and enjoy the ride man.
Are you a dude going after a girl that isn't into you? Or was this just a regular friend?
Is it because you consider her a sell out?
Meh I might buy it when it's under $20.
Already posted an hour ago and on the front page already.
I guarantee that there's nothing wrong with you. As you get through your 20's you'll fill out a little more. Just enjoy the ride and be happy the shell you're born with is healthy and serves you well.
OP, did you have a case on it? 
Yeah they should've totally bought OP a cheap Android phone that won't get any firmware updates after a few months. Idiot.
You do realize it's 2018? Just download Tinder and swipe on everyone and bang everyone you match with. 
lmfao imagine being taken care of by a nurse and finding out she sells her old socks to fat lonely virgins online

And this is what a bubble booty looks like next time you try and hype yourself up lol.
So why are you okay with killing plants? Because they don't have a face or cry out in pain when you slice and dice them?
The girl looks okay with the hair but you can't put hair like that on a little white boy lol. C'mon.
Because dumb ass people think they can go slow on fast rides. They’re the same ones that merge onto highways while holding their brakes. 
Definitely not in the category of being a bubble but still nice 
Tires and brakes shouldn't even be breaking the bank. How much are you paying for those?
I swear I had a gray version of that shirt when I was about your age in that pic.
Billions of humans on this planet and you think you can speak on behalf of all of them. 
There's graphics settings on the Xbox One X and Pro where you can prioritize frame rate. Plays nice and smooth while still looking amazing. 
Nope I'll stick to iPhone. I want my phone to still get updates in a few years, thanks.
Oh yeah! Because people only buy games on release day. No other days of the year. AC Origins was available for one day and one day only. Couldn't possibly be that he just got the game recently! 
You need to get the Master Chief collection and experience Bungie when they were in their golden age.
You’re preaching to the choir. No suffering here, just a dude that rolls with the punches. 
You’re just as much of a virgin as this little dude asking the question. 
How old are you?
Lol I did not choose to purposely be in debt. Just stop. 
>	I understand what you’re saying. I’m just saying that it’s how you chose to identify with that event in your mind that creates the outcome of being “knocked back 100 pegs”.

The outcome of being set back, big or small, isn’t a product of your feelings. It’s a product of an unexpected event that caused you to be set back. Life is an ever changing obstacle course that we’re suppose to adapt to and overcome.

But yes you’re suppose to have a can do attitude no matter how bad things get.

Dude, what? No. The part of getting knocked back isn’t a metaphor. I was literally set back in my progress of paying my credit card off in my example. No amount of wishful thinking is going to make debt disappear.
You don’t understand, and honestly shows how young you are. He was saying the gif represents life in that a lot of times when you think you’re making progress, when you reach the top, you get knocked down one or a 100 pegs. 

Example: I was almost out of credit card debt a few months ago. Then I had to spend $3k+ on a new transmission on my car unexpectedly.

That’s life.
Durr hurr fuck Apple supporting their phones for years! Let’s buy an android that’ll be forgotten about and left to die with no updates after a few months! Idiot. 
Yes this chubs me right up thanks bro 
**SHARE IT IMMEDIATELY** 😡
My 6S is still relevant, unlike all these cookie cutter androids that get updates for 5 minutes and are then forgotten about forever. 

Also it’s than, not then. Dumb ass lol. 
Consider it a convenience fee I’ll be damned if 10 cents keeps me from eating 
In the year 2018 why didn’t you just use your credit/debit card? 
Na. It’s bold.
Not one person I’ve ever known used “bald faced.”

So it’s bold. Thanks. 
It’s bold faced not bald lol.
Hey. Shut up Chunk.

It absolutely matters in shutting peasant android fanboys up.
Vomiting when you laugh isn’t normal. Go see a doctor.
Network lag has to do with your internet. Also go wired if you’re not already. 
Na the game disc is just an obstacle these days. This is why my 250+ games were all bought digital. They both reside on the HDD no matter what so might as well remove the step of putting a piece of plastic into your system to play a game. 
What’s so great about gamepass? Paying a monthly/yearly fee to play my games doesn’t make sense. 
?? Of course it’s better. And music sounds better if you’re playing saved songs off your phone. 
You were doing it wrong. It wasn’t VR lol. A slight turn to the left or right was all that was needed. Your eyes were suppose to stay on your tv. 
You’re doing it wrong. You’re using data and GPS at the same time. Your battery is crying. This is why wired CarPlay is better. Charges as you use it.
Who the hell uses navigation apps without having it plugged into a charger? 
Just because your age makes you feel self conscious doesn’t mean I’m a troll you weirdo.
Games don’t run off discs anymore. They run off the HDD.
**Check your purchase history** how tf would we know anything? 
Lol how young are you
You’re just jerking your own dick at this point. Go home kid. 
Shh.
Say less.
You’re a dork dude. 
It’s a normal bodily function you stupid dipshit. 
Spoken like a true untouched virgin. Right up there with Fry’s grandpa saying ”ever get the feeling we only like girls cuz we’re suppose to?” I bet you enjoy sitting on your dads lap. 
Wtf kind of submission is this?? A picture of a screenshot of something that can’t even play. Do people not use their minds anymore when they post shit? 
OP, who taught you how to make titles?
Are you running the game off a low quality external? 
Man I wonder if an update is causing this. My external is on its way out too. Won’t spin up right away and I always have to select the game/app again for it to load. 
You do realize it doesn’t play any Gameboy games right?
That doesn’t play gameboy games at all. It’s just some cheap dollar store games in the form of a case that resembles a Gameboy.
Why act surprised? Androids were all suppose to look like Blackberries before iPhone came out. Android phones will always copy iPhones no matter what. 
Lmfao only on reddit will you find suburban sheltered kids defending a terrible barber. Delete this post dude.
Mine smells of demons and graveyard soil. 
That’s not how any of that works dude. Stop sounding so ignorant. A robocaller simply spoofed your number. It’s harmless. 
Oh? But you’re okay with living on a spinning space rock with a thin atmosphere as protection from an eternal void? Okay.
That’s just extreme autism brought on by the realization that he might have to fight off a dude for the first time in his sheltered life.
Because you pay for the features not found in the *basic free* app. 
She’s augmenting her body to mimic a males by taking something her body doesn’t naturally produce (on that level.) It’s an unfair advantage. 

This is why I compared it to juicing on a basic level. 
I spend that at the vending machine at work, how are people this astronomically cheap these days? 
Are you from a different country? Usually foreigners love using WhatsApp. 
What kind of stupid question is this? If you have an iPhone, and you text another iPhone, it’s iMessage. Unless you have a cheap plan with no data or texting an Android then it’ll be a peasant green text message.

Do you even understand how iMessage works?
She. That’s a female that is basically juicing. She’ll beat the girls, and then when she wrestles dudes she’ll in turn be beat by them since she isn’t a real biological dude. She simply gains male characteristics because that’s what testosterone is suppose to do. Lose/lose situation. 
You’re not suppose to. You use a regular spoon instead of a decorative one you genius.
Stop exaggerating, the effects hold up fine. It’s barely 6 years old. 
Lol don’t do this yourself. 
If you know you want your friend to join then just invite him directly. SOS flares are to let randoms join your game. 
Already knew about that one. 
What do you expect from a generation of parents that boycotts a Peter Rabbit movie over a food allergy scene?

lol you're adorable.
This is bs. I have a Japanese friend that plays Monster Hunter on his XB1 in Japan.
I identify as a turtle so I **demand** a heat lamp, a patch of sand to lay my pretend eggs, and orange slices!
..he died? 

edit: wtf he died in 2004
The focus should be on the asshole prius turning onto the wrong lane.
Lame ass vapes, what the hell does it need a digital display for anyway, to determine their douche levels for the day? What percentage of their anus has healed since it last got plowed through by a big veiny dick?
Anybody looking to scratch that gaming itch jump in to Monster Hunter, the water feels fine here!
This plus Monster Hunter World is all anyone needs. Can't wait for an X enhanced update for the Division.
That’s the tiniest ass I’ve ever seen. And to see thirsty chumps praising it smh 🤦🏻‍♂️ 
Lol fuck off with your “um ackshually” Snapple fact. He clearly wasn’t talking about Jewish people living in Jewish ghettos in the 1940s. 
“A life in the ghetto” typed the white kid from mommy and daddy’s suburban home. Ignorant dumb fuck. Nothing to do with growing up “in the ghetto” and EVERYTHING to do with being a fucked up psycho.

Stupid ass post with over a thousand upvotes smh. 
Why do people always ask this question on posts like these? Of course it affects the battery. The battery is what powers it. Never in the history of these posts has the answer ever been "nope! the LED's actually replenishes the battery every time they light up!"
lol @ people that have the audacity to act surprised that they ran out of storage when they cheap out and buy the one with the smallest capacity in the first place. My music collection alone is over 17GB. What'd you expect OP?
I haven’t turned D2 on in months. Monster Hunter World for the win 
It’s $20 for a digital copy of Halo 3 and it plays in 4K if you have an X.. 
Stop trying to make this happen. It’s not going to happen.
Hello what have we here ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
Pierced nips on skinny girls look like staples on pieces of paper 
I’ll take “things untouched virgins say” for $300.
Upvoted. Finally my life will be sorted. Thanks op.
Please.

**update us.**
It’s because of them killing digg that I found reddit. 
What did it say
Chet chet gana no wahya meet wanna no pata 
It’s been working fine for a while now... 
I know. 
It’s not cool to me, it just gets in the way 
Lol @ people that still believe radio skits 
Lol are you serious? You’re basically sanding your phone screen doing that. 
I never recommend game mode. It makes the picture look terrible. 
Yeah that’s the one you want. The regular 2DS is the non flip version.
Jesus Christ it's Jason Bournuru
I would have gotten the "new" variation of the 3DS. MH runs worse on the basic models.
I can't stand players like this dude.
Hitting start cancels out the "victory pan" of the camera.
That's all I need to know lol I'm over 80 hours in and love knowing I have so much to do.
What's considered finished the story? I last left off on killing Nirigante. 
How the hell? I've been playing since release date and I'm HR14.
No, it's awful. Stop this safe space bullshit. Trash is trash, call it trash. If I smear a piece of my shit in your face you're not gonna smile and call it free leftovers right?
Don't encourage monstrosities like this. Especially on a classic. Smh.
It's almost like they looked to the real world for inspiration on a game that's based on an alternate reality of our real world.
I bet you think the pictures exist in a literal cloud in the sky with your name on it and no one elses. 
People that don’t use iCloud for photos because they feel uncomfortable having their personal pictures reside in a mystery hard drive somewhere. 
Do you still watch Fresh Prince?

Any classic sitcoms?

Game of Thrones and other shows of their caliber will be relevant for years to come. No one forgets major pop culture icons like that. 
Thots ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
What the fuck does a cartoon have to do with anything? I don’t even watch that show. You have autism or something dude? 
Well yeah..tech is always gonna cost money. And iPhones/smartphones in general are always going to come with the price tag especially if they’re current models..not sure what you’re getting at?
Huh lol. What’s the correlation between software bugs and being broke?
Waiting for him to say “how can an explanation be hard, if words are just vibrations made through the air. Further more, your words in this instance are digital, thus making it impossible for them to physically feel hard” 
Any reason why I would use this if I have Dark Sky? And I don’t want “it makes try hard jokes about weather” as a selling point lol.
That looks like a Halo 5 wanna be lol.
You still don’t get it. This was a scenario where it was *all* their time to die. At the same time. Whether they realized it or not. He simply meant at least they were all together. People like you irritate me this shouldn’t have to be explained so hard.
That is developer laziness, the X and Pro are very capable.
Yeah after tapping the home button 2 times but I rather not break the action since it pulls up the home menu overlay for a quick second. 
I have one laying around, but rather get the chat pad since it has dedicated screenshot and game DVR buttons
I’m in my 30s, youngest friends being 25+. We all use it. Try stepping out of your little bubble sometime.
Slow how..you literally do things at your pace
Try dual blades. You did try every single weapon style right? 
I haven't touched D2 in over a month now. Monster Hunter World has my full attention these days. Destiny use to be my go-to game. I love sci fi. I love the gameplay. But Bungie gutted what little soul this game had and made it feel like a cheap mobile game with lootboxes.
BABA PLS
Teach me more pls
Shhhhh
https://youtu.be/W2evDvaa25U

for fuck sake
I’d love to drop this dudes name but it actually turned out to be one of the minor monsters. Let’s just say at least I took that stupid rock hippos tail before he ran from the locale 😤
The amount of content this game has makes Destiny look like such a pathetic joke. To think that I was a fanatic over that game. 
Pls include solid wedge falcon 
Pop one viagra or cialis in the battery compartment one hour before activity is to occur. 
Swinging an industrial steel beam one handed = believable 

Seeing Bazel fly = “na bro ur a lil too fat to be flying like that ur breaking my immersion” 
Dude our characters can wield weapons that weigh hundreds if not thousands of pounds. Suspension of disbelief.
Absofuckinglutely.

On a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being Destiny 2 and 10 being Monster Hunter, MH World is a 100.

Make sense?
Really? But sentient armor wearing cats that help you hunt monsters is okay with you? 
Looks like a toy now instead of a classy piece of tech.
Are you imitating the pedos episode from South Park? I can’t tell. 
You’re a pedophile if you like little boys in make up.  
Are you actually defending make up on little boys you sick fuck?
That’s what I call a fart when you know it came out, but no smell is to be found 👃🏻 
Lol might as well be encouraging people to use AIM. iMessage is baked in, Androids will forever deal with peasant SMS texts. 
Is it worth me buying the Blacksteel? Or should I stick with my Diablos series? 
Spoken like the true untouched virgin that you are. I bet you enjoyed sitting on your father and uncles lap growing up. 
I have a sneaking suspicion that the store they just walked out of might carry it. If only we knew what store that was 🤔 
You’re not suppose to have ANY post processing effects turned on though. You want pure unaltered picture not garbage data added to the picture. Sad how many people have nice TV’s and never use them to their full potential.
That feels like a prison and super claustrophobic. How is that even inviting. Hunched over a tiny keyboard holding a mouse like a t-rex. Give me a controller, a couch, and a 50 inch tv any day.
What’s the point of that? That provides zero protection against falls.
Look on the bright side, this opens the door for somebody to clone the OG snap and make some serious bank. 
No you don’t.
Or, they took two movies that previously never had anything to do with Cloverfield, and made a few extra scenes for the hell of it and called them Cloverfield sequels. Lowest effort franchise I’ve ever seen. 
They will bring their A game or they won’t happen at all. 
Lol Switch isn’t even on the same level as Xbox. 
If you want a ghost town of a player base get it on PC. The whole point of Destiny is to play with other players/randoms and PC is deserted. 
Microsoft, no! Unless a major update is incoming before then, people are going to think the regular XB1’s are complete trash! Wait til the game is more complete/stable!! 
Timesplitters 2 and/or Future Perfect pls 

What the fuck that looks like a shotgun wound 🤢🤢🤢🤢
Stop being okay with Bungie making shaders a consumable. THEY SHOULD BE A ONE AND DONE DEAL

You earned a shader? It should be available to you forever! Fuck paying for shit, real money or fake in game money. 
But why when Monster Hunter is killing it 🤔 
I like this theory the best. Was really fascinated by the solid front.
Works fine for me and my friends and I’ve done nothing but respond to SOS quests all weekend and connected to everyone just fine.
They’ve been fixed dude. Probably your shitty Internet. 
I don’t own a PS4 nor do I have any intention of ever buying one. 🤷🏻‍♂️ 
*adding a piece of cloth to a vanilla item while trying to pass it off as high tier gear*

Bungie pls

..HOLD UP
Xbox One X player checking in. I'm over 45 hours deep and counting.

Man why downvote me, I love this game. >:|
I’ll wait for Apple to perfect it and do it right on a future iPhone. ✌🏼 

Lol android fans are salty. Android always half asses features. Apple waits to perfect it and makes it mainstream. 
His name is now A-Shit Pie.
Lol do you even know what passive aggressive means? I’m not trying to hide the fact that I think destiny 2 is a major let down. It’s a pathetic pile of trash. They learned nothing from D1 and didn’t apply any of their lessons learned.
Well deserved, I’ve completely ditched Destiny 2 in favor of MH World. I almost forgot what a complete and deep game looked like! 
So cringy and try hard. I want to punch every late teen/early 20 something that thinks these are funny in the throat. Thanks for almost ruining my morning. ❤️
I've given up on Destiny. All about that Monster Hunter World. Let this franchise die.
Be careful, Reddit is infested with virgins that love white knighting for scumbag women they’ll never meet and call any dudes being wronged by a female an angry “nice guy.” 
The movie came out 12 years ago. The vast majority of those people don't even know it exists.
Here’s an idea: LEAVE THE PREVIEW PROGRAM 
Sounds like you don’t even have your Xbox set up right. I rarely see an update screen and I play every single day. Why? Because I use instant on mode. Everything updates while I’m away. Delete this post. You’re embarrassing yourself.
Buy a real tv that displays a full true picture without cutting anything off. If you spend money on cheap tv’s then you get what you pay for.
Don’t come crying when the dye stains your phone/hand or it gives you some weird side effects.
I would love to go into their settings and delete their internet history so their tabs are gone. Dumb ass amateurs. 
So why are you even in the preview program? Are you one of those people that thinks it’s just to get new features before everyone else?
Send it to Mark on Twitter 
Go form a Monster Hunter PETA organization 🤷🏻‍♂️ 
Just don’t 
Reminds me of the 2005-2009 generation Mustang’s. Gorgeous.
Just stop posting. You sound amazingly ignorant with each word you type. Just pack it up and leave dude. 
HAHAH you’re creeping on a dude 😂
Freaking weirdo

>	Off topic but couldn’t hold it. Nice hands:p. Nice color too

Posted by /u/KinkyNothing in case he tries to back pedal on creeping on a dude 
You must have never played Monster Hunter on the 3DS. 
Disagree. The prioritize graphics setting barely makes a difference. Much better to prioritize frame rate. Your attention is on your character and monster(s) on screen. Not whether or not that tree branch in the background loads quick enough for you. 
Destiny 2 by far
“They started it.” - Adolf Hitler 
Yes on Xbox. Currently farming the t rex with randoms for that armor set.
Keep trying, it works for me. I’ve played many games with other randoms.
You can’t possibly be this ignorant.
This is bs. I have a 1080p set and the enhancements are obvious and amazing. 
None that I know of, see if a friend will let you try it. I’ll tell you this, playing MH World is like meeting the woman of your dreams after being in an abusive relationship. 
Yup. I recommend Monster Hunter World if you want something fresh and deep.
And not just the armor. But the women and children too.
I just had an SOS flare cancel itself resulting in a failure as me and 3 other dudes were killing the t-Rex. Super disappointed. 
Sheesh I'll try this tomorrow. This monster is what gave me my first failure.
If I see the monster I'm hunting has wings I just switch to my bow. 
Working fine for me. Played 5+ hours today and now streaming a movie. 
You'll finish the story and never touch them again. At least people still play Halo 3 to this day. Enjoy trading those 2 PS4 games to Gamestop I guess. (you know you don't care about those other two lol. it's cute you tried to sandwich them in between the bigger names though)

Me, and millions of other people, so I can play all the multiplatform games better than the PS4 can, and the exclusives that I like, in addition to 360 and original Xbox games I already own, some that even get patched to run in 4K. (Halo 3 runs in 4K.)

Have a good one buddy. :)


Yes they're Xbox Play Anywhere titles. 

With the exception of PUBG, but still the same idea. PC isn't a console. PS4 is. So tell me again why you're mad that the X has better specs than the Pro?
Gears 4?..

PUBG?..

Halo 5?.. 

Forza Motorsport and Horizon?..

Cuphead?..

Quantum Break?..

The list continues. Wanna keep using out dated console war memes? Member $599 US Dollars? Giant Enemy Crab? Oh and the X still runs it best lol.
Just because someone likes something doesn't make them a shill you genius. Stay miserable playing wack ass Destiny then.
Xbox One X is the console you want to play on. You can choose to prioritize graphics, frame rate, or resolution (4K). PS4 Pro doesn't have those options.
That's the point you genius. Monster Hunter World is a game that isn't the bland watered down microtransaction fest that Destiny 2 is. Surely you have enough intelligence to understand that?
And that's what the filter is for.
I would have smacked the got damn shit outta her. 
It prevents a little bit of crushing, the chips are still gonna clank around each other and break no matter what. 
I know what the air is for you genius.
The point is that we're not being CHARGED EXTRA MONEY for shit already in the game!
3DS has reached its saturation point. It's not that people don't care. It's been out a long ass time.
How many times do you expect people to keep rebuying the 3DS? Do you know how old it is? It's at the end of its life. 
When you open a large bag of Lays, do you sit there and go "ah yes this looks delicious and the two thirds of empty air is a smart design"
I played the trial and thought it was just okay.
I wanna make out with it ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
Are you purposely pretending this wasn’t patched a couple days ago?
🍅 
Dude there’s three graphical mode settings on the X. None on the OG/S. Doesn’t take a rocket scientist to determine the X version looks best out of all console models.
There’s nothing to analyze lol. It’s scientific fact it looks and plays better on the X.
It plays and looks best on Xbox One X. No question about it. Buy with confidence.

Your face is a funny scene.
Meh I'll get this when it goes on sale eventually.
No one cares that you found it disappointing. It's overwhelmingly popular for a reason. You don't sound like the type of person to appreciate a game like BotW. If you want to talk about games that now feel like chores it's Destiny 2 itself.
Now how’d I miss that..is this good enough? Stored on cloud or this local?
Play your other games dude. You can stop playing D2 for months and you won’t miss a thing. Stop depriving yourself of good gaming experiences. 
You need to log off and throw your computer/phone away.
An emojis team. lmao that's adorable.
She wasn't asking for help on her disorder, **as she's already handling that issue**. The purpose of her posting was to get feedback on how she looks since's she's begun rectifying that issue.
Of course it's effective, she's asking for feedback about how she looks. No where did she ask for help with her disorder, as she's already handling that. 
She wants to know how she looks to others, she's handling her business already.
I'm preparing to buy a Switch soon. My questions: 


* I have the Wii U version of BotW. Any way to carry my save over to the Switch?

* I intend on buying all my games physical for my Switch. Do I need more storage space for digital only games? Or is the internal storage enough?

* I intend to only play in docked mode. Does the screen just permanently stay dormant in the dock?

* And can I just buy a regular shaped controller instead of the two piece one the Switch comes with? 
Multiplatform games will always play better on the XB1/PS4 so I always buy them for my Xbox in my scenario. (I don't own a PS4)
Lame, let's stabilize the OS first, then add the fun shit after.
Man I hope so. I love the game to death but the game obviously isn’t finalized yet. Feels like stopping the microwave to take a bite of that food you’re craving. Just let the food finish heating up so we can eat it as intended!
Shouldn’t they wait til the game is more stable. Doesn’t play so well on the OG/S models.
You look fine, stop worrying. 
Dude young boys wearing make up is fucked up. There’s no way anybody can defend that. 
I want to thank everyone for beta testing the X. I look forward to purchasing the true version of the X this September! 
I guarantee you replied to a message with some not so great language.
I would wait for him to fall asleep and then I’d put a hyphen so it reads “The Penis - Mightier than the sword” 
Seriously my dude? Think about her job title and how it relates to SPARROWS and SHIPS and then connect the dots. Almost condescending the way you asked this. Reminds me of how my boss addresses us when we bring up an issue. “Well Flux85, how would *you* fix this?” 
You’re stupid. The software throttles devices with inadequate battery life. That’s literally all it’s doing. $29 gets you a new battery and your phone goes back to acting like you just bought it.

Source: ME and my 6S. 
This is why I’ll never mess with any mods. Don’t need them, don’t wanna know about them. 
Doesn’t mean jack shit. ✌🏼 
Na just an Android
I've had this game since day 1 back in September 2016 and this is the one and only time they've ever done this. It's no reason to freak out. It was a few seconds and it was gone. Stop blowing it out of proportion.
It never stopped the game for me while I was in the middle of a race or anything. I spawned in at the festival, and it played right before I drove out and continued on my merry way. 
lmao stop exaggerating. It's an innocent cutscene.
(ง ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)ง WHERE DID THAT COME FROM

I think pierced nips are ugly. Get the fuck over it. You don’t even fuckin know me lol why are you crying so hard about a stranger not liking women with pierced tits? You’re acting like I pissed on your mother’s grave. I’m a faceless internet user name dude. Let it go. It’s gonna be okay. 
Sure let’s spend money on a motherboard, a PC case, a bigger hard drive, a graphics card, and maybe a new monitor/keyboard/mouse. So cheap he won’t even notice the moneys gone! Lol 
You already did by making that comment. Don’t pussy out now chump lol

White knight virgin mobs love sticking up for girls they’ll never meet. Trash is trash little guys. ✌🏼 
Fuck pierced nips man why stick pieces of random ass metal there

Except they copied the superior Xbox controller. PlayStation controllers have always had the analog stick in second place, I have no idea why they still put the d-pad in the primary position like it’s still the 90s.

This game is so good. So much content and stuff to do.
This is all on you OP. Stop using the death grip on your controllers. Never had any of these issues you’re talking about. Once you feel the stick click down that’s all the force you need. Pushing harder beyond that is obviously going to break the stick.
How old are you OP?
Nope. It’s one thing to provide for them, and *occasionally* spoil them. It’s another to give them everything on a silver platter without showing them the value and meaning of earning their own shit. Reddit upvoted you cuz they’re white and they see what they think is a wise funny black dude talkin smh. 
You can excuse yourself now son, move along. 
Lmao thank you for proving my point. I never fucking said sentient meant humanoid you idiot. 
ARTIFICIAL intelligence is just that, ARTIFICIAL. It gives the appearance of real intelligence by mimicking and following whatever the program tells them to follow (a program is a set of predetermined instructions.)

Come on dude. 
I know exactly what they mean, sounds like you and OP are both cut from the same cloth. 
I’m not sure who to be more annoyed at, OP or this shining example of technological ignorance.
It's clear that they are fully SENTIENT and operating on their OWN WILL. They are not the same as a digital hollow puppet that follows a set of instructions. How can you be this dense.
Hop off that train already my dude, you and these young try hard kids turning on NDT to be edgy need to grow up.
Watch Cloverfield Lane.
Good lord I get irrationally annoyed when people like you miss the whole point because they think they understand everything there is to know.
The "game characters" actually have CONSCIOUSNESS and are essentially digital clones. Not just AI controlled by a computer. Sounds to me like you'd be one of those pervs that would take every opportunity to live out his sick fantasies how Callister did.
Use a Rhinoshield bumper.

I wish I could send an email where when you open it, it slaps you over the head with a rolled up newspaper for encouraging that autistic bs.
STOP POSTING PICTURES OF THINGS YOU BUY
Really. A soup. The plainest most boring thing anybody can ever eat next to a cheese sandwich.
Punch that big square out from the back so it can breathe.
Idgaf about vault space, you don't need to hang on to every single piece of gear that drops dude. Stop being a pack rat.
We're only 13 days into 2018. Relax and let everyone get back to work dude. What a stupid thing to imply when such little time has passed. How young are you that two weeks seems so long to you?
I’m 32 and prefer Xbox, so do my friends. 
NEXT!!
My eyes tear up when I noticed the puppy dragged itself to him before it died.
Play Spotify on your phone while you play 
This is more common than you think. There’s absolutely nothing special about this. Not everyone is boujee and upgrades every year. 
The alpha and the omega. What was in the beginning shall be in the end. Now and also at the hour of our death. Amen.
No honor in cheating. I hope everyone cheating has all their progress reset.
You do realize Destiny 1 came out in 2014? Do you know what year we're in now? Barely any progression has been made.
Delete this post and stop creating distractions.
The first step is literally visiting Tess. I am shelving this game indefinitely and I’m going to make sure none of my friends waste their time playing this game. Fuck Tess/Eververse.
Lmao I’m so over it. They don’t even give a fuck. Not participating in this bullshit. Monster Hunter is out soon, that game will be getting my full attention.
Wow what are those? I’ve never seen anything like it before. It looks so much like what I’m holding in my hand but it couldn’t possibly be the same thing, can it? Such a unique photo. I bet no other camera has captured an image like this in the history of this planet. This is truly a work of art. Please, post more pictures of these exotic devices. It’s so funny that it resembles the thing I’m holding in my hand though omg. 
It literally takes a few seconds for your eyes to adjust, delete this nonsense.
I hated that they added the voices so much. I wish they had an option to disable them. Either way, GBA games are meant to be played on a handheld though some GBA games do offer different picture settings thanks to the Gameboy Player on the Gamecube.

Oh, and there's no such thing as a GBA version of sprites. They all use the Super Mario All Stars sprites.
lol are you kidding me, stop exaggerating. There's just ONE tile on the bottom right used for ads.
Use instant on and stop closing out the game every time and you can do the same exact thing dude.
People complained about a 13GB download? Gears of War 4 is over 100GB on XB1 lol.
Idgaf what people think. As long as shit gets done on time my boss shouldn't give not one fuck about when I get things done.
Beyonce where lmao.
Whenever they feel like it.
Looks like you took a pic wearing a condom over your head.
You could've saved the cash dude. Nobody buys gold lol.
I am so sick of Playstation. I'll never give them a dime again, and I've steered all my friends onto Xbox One anyway. 
C’mon dude pay attention.
Why bother switching out when you can just *add* storage by putting your other hdd in an enclosure and plug it in via usb? 
What’s modded about it? If you just wanted the good GBA SP all you had to do was make sure you were buying the AGS-101 model.
This is only a big deal to sheltered suburban dwellers. 
Wtf are people using to browse Reddit that they can’t see the thumbnails?

Plugging in the ethernet cable should be seamless. You might have a faulty Xbox.
There's now a yearly subscription though, and Cloud backup is now hidden behind the paywall.
How is this compared to Day One?
I know this. And tacking on a random asset and/or a generic pattern is lazy. Don't make excuses for them dude.
That’s how it went for me when I went for my 6S recall in December 2016.
That’s lame af and you’re sheltered for feeling awkward about it.
Imagine having one earbud perpetually hold less charge than the other 
IDGAF. Apple Store or nothing. Fuck that.
He changed the settings on the router to prioritize his Xbox over yours and is playing dumb.. 🕵🏻‍♂️
Except the first order helmet is actually pulled right from the concept art made in 1977.... 
?? Might as well tape a graham cracker to your phone and drop it, of course a fragile weak protector is gonna shatter, your screen would’ve been fine without it.
Don’t worry about your 360 pic, no one sees it they see your XB1 pic.
I don’t care. I don’t hold stock in them. I’m not a part of their marketing team. If there’s something I don’t like in the future I’ll be sure to bitch about it though. That’s about it. 
“Throws paper towels into the crowd”
And why do the vast majority of android users love using that ugly comic sans looking font? 
Whoever made this is fucking stupid. Yoda knew the texts weren’t in there. He said “Rey has everything she needs” because she literally had the texts with her, on the falcon! 
No OP. We wouldn’t have to explain anything. You really think we’d have to explain make believe stories to a species capable of interstellar travel? You really think they wouldn’t comprehend the concept of telling a story for entertainment? 
The ships are what piss me off the most. Why do the exotic ships look like all the other common ships with just a recycled stage/armor asset randomly stuck on?
lmao who still uses mapquest. Wtf 
If you're buying UHD movies you should be doing so on blu ray, not streaming it. 
Fix? Fix what? Games are suppose to reside on the hard drive nowadays. 
Delete this, this is like the kid in class reminding the teacher that there was homework. 
I would just pop the battery out and display it..def gonna degrade quickly.
How's that any different from doing it through the regular Xbox app?
Rocket League has been on Xbox forever though..and it’s X enhanced..what makes it better on the switch?
Lol why are you so desperate to rub something in our faces? You bored? Need a hug?
Tried the trial, seemed repetitive, uninstalled it.
Didn’t a sleeping kid get his head chopped off by a crazy guy on a grey hound some years ago? 
Na, Internet is fine here. 
It’s frustrating especially when I’m trying to browse games to buy. 
Sounds like an issue with your internet provider not Xbox.
https://youtu.be/MMzd40i8TfA
It looks stupid just like comic sans. 
["WAND! MAKE MY MONSTER, GROWW"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUelB-OSneY)
Why do Android users love using comic sans for their font??
The patina on that red square looks exquisite, what care products do you use on it?
It sounds like this: https://youtu.be/du-TY1GUFGk?t=1
I have a Wii U with BotW, Mario Kart 8, and a balance board I can trade towards a Switch. What's the best place to go to upgrade? I also have Visa debit card gift cards totaling over $50. I'd like to end up with a Switch and the Switch version of BotW. Maybe add Mario too.
lol shut the hell up. Enjoy your Android that gets a couple tiddlywinks of updates and then is forever forgotten after a few months.
If it’s a movie you truly like why not buy it and add it to your collection? 
A hard reboot will fix the lag on the UI. Nothing else needs to be done.
What do you define as dark?
That’s how I feel when I see people post the shitty leather cases on /r/iPhone. “Patina” this and “ages beautifully” that. Looks like a shitty wet paper bag to me. 
Over priced how. Androids all cost the same on average. Stop blindly hating on things.
That’s cool where did you buy it from?
Are you stupid? Mexicans are all descendants of the Aztec, Mayan, etc MIXED with some Spanish. 
What's the box with the 3 cars and the 60 on it? Are those die cast cars?
Ehh I can't bring myself to buy controllers when it comes with two genuine perfectly good controllers. 
You don't want to stream this, watch it on Blu Ray to get the full effect.
I'd like to stress that to get the full 4K quality that you need to watch it on a Blu Ray disc. Streaming HD is a slap in the face to the real thing.
??? Just use the adapter it to plug it into the X.
OP, why are you such a submissive pushover? Why did you let that happen?
I’m over 30 and that was definitely my Luke. 
No one needs a 4K UI, that’s being used for games instead.
What kind of autistic retard are you son?
Are you serious? Blu Ray is what you watch when you want your moneys worth out of your TV. Streaming HD is a joke since it’s so degraded compared to an actual Blu Ray. 
Blu rays will always be the best of the best. Streaming will always be subject to degradation no matter how good your connection is.
You

It’s your opinion that it’s not worth it.

It’s a fact that all games perform better.

✌🏼 
More like everyone that owns one will say yes. It’s a scientific fact that games perform better, not opinion. 
I decided to stick with it. Can’t wait to get it, though I’ll probably leave my SNES hooked up the way it is for a long time lol 
Yes it is.
No, I don’t want this. The UI lags enough as it is. Let’s make noise for a menu that never slows down first before we go asking for animated wallpapers.😒
Hard reboot
Absolutely, I have a 1080p TV.
Only Xbox One X does true 4K. The PS4 pro just upscales. 
Thanks I’ll check it out. Do the CRT and Pixel Perfect filters work on roms that get installed? 
Final Fantasy XV is amazing 
Is it easy to do? Does it appear in the list of games?
Just ordered this on amazon but then debated cancelling for the other suitcase looking one with swappable front.
Lol why in the world would you connect it to a PC. You’re suppose to hook it up to a TV dude.
Jesus you’re that kid in class that reminds the teacher we all had homework huh? Delete this, don’t give them ideas. 
You can afford an iPhone and an Apple Watch according to your previous posts but can’t afford $60 (or less) once a year for Live? 
Plays like Banjo Kazooie, perfect N64 vibes. 
5 years might as well be 5 months once you’re past your 30s. 
OP, please include this in the original post.
I freaking got one and I’m so hyped! 
Rewatch the entire saga and then read back what you just said but very slowly.
You ignore all the other physics defying moments from Star Wars Episodes 1 through 7, but you suddenly decide to apply real world science to one random scene, for what?

You suspend your disbelief for 7 other movies except for this one. How the hell do you complainers brains work? Are you just parroting each other?  
Levitating objects and manipulating them with the power of your mind, lightsaber swords, gargantuan planet destroying battle stations, giant worms living inside asteroids, but being dipped into space really quick and surviving via the force was too much.

Ok dude lol. 
Where is there snow in the game? I’m still on my first play through.
I’ll take “Things fat virgin neckbeards say” for $300
There’s nothing wrong with realizing you rather be snuggling a fat veiny dick.
Good lord I hate every iteration of Android emojis.
Wow stop crying. It’s all connected you’re just too blind inside your own personal rabbit hole to see it. 
You are so hilariously wrong that it hurts. Just delete this post and never log back in again.
Lol man why would they add noise to a fun sci-fi movie? It’s like they want people to be entertained or something crazy like that. 
It’s a movie why are you trying to apply real world logic to a sci-fi movie. “Suspension of disbelief” google it. Just enjoy it and shut the fuck up. 
It’s almost like Star Wars is a fictional movie of some kind. 
I never use game mode, turning off all the artificial picture altering features is way better and doesn’t degrade the picture. 
I have no rebuttal because I’m not going to argue about something I know I’m going to continue to enjoy. Nothing you could possibly say will ever change my mind. Go find somebody else to let your teen angst out on. 

Again, Merry Christmas little dude, and don’t forget to leave milk and cookies for Santa tonight. 
Lol you picked the wrong system to play this in 4K on. You want the Xbox X if you want 4K, not fake upscaled PS4 quality. 
Buy an X.
“Quit” the sub? Lol it’s not a job dude just hit unsubscribe and go do something else. No one is forcing you to stay.
Are you white knighting for a video game character? 
Real ones know her from Farscape.
Lol @ anybody still using wifi to game.
Lol. Ok dude. I’m still enjoying it. Merry Christmas. 
What exactly did they promise.. plays just like Banjo Kazooie to me. 
Android is trash but poor people praise it for its affordability. I’m sorry you can’t afford an iPhone. 
“Android phone chargers be like” 
Lmao more reskinned bs. Might as well be ornaments you apply since I have duplicates of all those models.
Lol of course they do.
A disc will always look better no matter what. 
So pick one of the many basic shaped ghosts and apply a shader to it. 
Spoken like a true shill.
This is bs, I have a 1080p set and the X was worth every penny. 
You either deal with shitty free apps or you pay a small fee for quality. Don’t complain about it if you can’t afford a couple dollars.
I have every right to not like people that don’t know how to enjoy things.
Hold on let me use my psychic powers to find your location so I can call your local Apple Store and ask them for you brb
I absolutely can’t stand people like you. 
Hideous grass hopper Titan. You shame us. 
Freaking be specific dude. You can’t just talk to it like a caveman and expect it to extrapolate. You might as well be saying “it’s morphin time!” like a power ranger or some shit.
Limitation of what exactly?
Frog butt?

FROG BUTT??

This is what you basement dwelling autists call this?

Frog butt? Jesus fucking Christ. 
FOR THE PUPPIES?
Destiny 2 feels like when you burn your mouth and can't taste anything, but you eat it anyway because you need to put something in your stomach.
BUNGIE DO THIS PLS

PLS PLS PLS

I'LL PLAY EVERY FREAKING DAY
OP, you are not a true fan. They didn't divert from anything. It's simply growing as intended. What you wanted was a novelty garden in a bottle, and you're upset that we're getting an entire forest instead. 
You literally missed the entire point. 
Nothing is being revised. It's simply continuing to grow and evolve.
That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll be the end of it. OP belongs to us now.
Final Fantasy XV and Skyrim  
Man I never realized how tiny the GBC screen is.
Please like you didn’t pick that yourself lol. Assigned seating at the movies is a thing. 
Why are you so angry? Relax. 
Go away.
How the fuck do so many of you types exist? The word vomit is mind numbing. Warring factions and space politics weren’t “real life” enough for you but adding the layer of having the rich profit from both sides is what did it for you?

You don’t even know what to be mad at. Just shut up and think before you speak.
I wouldn’t even waste my breath. OP sounds like the kind of guy that watches movies once, remembers 25% of it, and then fills the rest in based on first impressions and half assed assumptions.
Lol I made an observation, no where did I criticize it. I still gave it props. Chill the fuck out.
If you’re gonna buy anything Apple **always** go to an Apple store or order from their site.
Wrong model but still cool.
Ugh I just want a digital sale on this game so I can get rid of the disc.
This is bullshit. You’re hiding behind the “omg I don’t wanna do this because I’m an introvert” excuse when it’s really you. There’s some things you have to nut up and get over with. That’s life. 
I didn’t do any kind of back up when I got a replacement battery on my 6S last year and everything was still there. 🤷🏻‍♂️
I got my helm of saint 14 from the engram you can buy so das nice.
"they're big and they're mean and u gotta shoot em all LOL!" - Ikora
This **NEEDS** to be the next thing to change. Let us change the freaking shaders as we please, Destiny 1 style. 
For 3DS only. 
That notification is what made me delete the app off my phone. Good riddance.
??? Looked fine to me. That's normal dude. 
Why didn't you have a case on it?
Why the fuck would this be fake lol. How sheltered are you kids living out there in the suburbs?
Tell your boss that we wanna know when the fuck you niggas bringin back spicy nuggets.
Immerse yourself in the game and enjoy the ride. 
Lol sure let me go pick a PS4 off the vine they grow on. 
XMen are finally coming home what’s so disturbing about that?
If you have an X it already installs it by default. Just sort your games by “X Enhanced” to see for yourself.
Hold on let me use my psychic powers to detect the make and model of your tv.
(ง ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)ง 
Lol there’s people that live half a world away that’ll visit. What does you living 2 hours away have to do with anything. 
Nigga use google. 
What a small, small brain you have.
Lol shut up with your “umm ackshually” post. You know exactly what he’s talking about.
Lol that’s what you get you genius 
🤦🏻‍♂️ Water resistant means it’ll be fine if a few raindrops land on it. Not to fucking shower with it and expose it to torrents of water. 
Why is this a big deal? Even the vending machine at my job uses Apple Pay.
Is it me or does the music in the trailer sound like it’s from Mass Effect too? The piano. 
Wtf ornament only changes color? All the previews I’ve seen change the armor a lot and is noticeable. 
Have you done a hard reboot
Hahah I can’t wait to have my little mega man helper that is so cool 
Lol he sounds like a bitch ass pussy to me. No way was he ever a bully. He sounds like he got wedgies and shoved in lockers his whole life.
Oh wow you’ve had it for a *while now*, a round of applause for you. 🙄
And Destiny 2 is full 4K on the X and dynamic on PS4 pro.

Again, developers.
All X owners think this post is adorable.
The Star Wars ones are fun, I got The Force Awakens for dirt cheap so watch for that go on sale again. Well worth it.
The dress doesn’t cover her tits ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
**Of course** the X is always going to look better.

And if it doesn’t, it’s due to developer negligence. Enough with these stupid articles.
Fuck yeah let’s spread this like the virus that it is. Bungie should be shamed and dragged through the mud for this bullshit. 
Lol are you remedial? This ain’t a club you leave or a job you quit dude. Do whatever tf you want.
Well worth the price anybody on the fence should get it especially if they have an X.
Oh my fucking god another picture of an iPhone in someone’s hand. Why are these still allowed
Lol hyped to get something that nobody will ever see since everyone is abandoning this shit show of a game. 
Na bro but have you seen the EXOTIC broom emote? Here keep spending money on silver and maybe you’ll get it lol. - Love, Bungie
That looks like a green piece of cow shit with horns who the fuck designed that?
It’s still a benefit provided to 1080p sets.
Look up super sampling. 
I only rub it down in the harshest of chemicals. 
Lol what? No. That’s not how any of this works. If this post would’ve ended with “they make you spend money on loot boxes to get the egg!” Then it would’ve made sense. 
That’s a girl.
Open the note. Top right. There’s your options to email/print/etc.
Delete this post then. You have no right to complain about something that you yourself fucked up on. 
Why the fuck are you letting it go idle so often and then why do you sit there watching an idle screen getting mad that it’s idling? 
ITS AN IDLE SCREEN why are you getting mad at something that’s basically a screen saver? 
Devil May Cry is already there, unless I’m missing something?
PATINA PLS
Feels great on my 6S so far too.
Look at the PATINA of my iPhone case, I rub it down in my very own mixture of neckbeard and chicken tendy grease before I bang my Steve Jobs body pillow.
What are you talking about. The X enhancement patch has been out. 
When it comes to consoles the game looks best on Xbox One X. No way around this, please don’t peddle these lies.
No. Your inferior genetics are your problem.
It’s fine, I was relieved to find out I wasn’t gonna be on the empires side when she turned to the rebellion. Fuck the empire. 
Fuck yes SA2 sitting in my ready to install list, it’s 2.9GB if anyone is curious. 
?? My pins are there. Add the pins section back to your home screen.
Jesus fuck with the airbrush 
“But at what cost” as if lives were lost or something lol 
What kind of stupid ass question is this? 
Why did you stick your dick in a crackhead in the first place? 
So this is where the unlimited powah begins. With thunderous reboots.
This wouldn’t of happened if you were on Xbox. Game saves always get sent to the cloud in addition to having your save locally. 
Finally playing all the way thru on the X for the first time. What a phenomenal game so far. 
I’d just like to say that if it weren’t for the X, I wouldn’t have dived back into this game. People say “it shouldn’t be about the graphics” but when admiring a piece of art, it should run perfectly. I put Fallout 4 away for the same reason, it was sluggish and felt like the Xbox was struggling and it turned me off. 

With that said, I really love this game and it’s one of the best this generation.
You're seeing compression artifacts in video because that video is being streamed over the internet. Put in a blu ray.
Dump Wi-Fi and go wired.
Lol this game should NOT be on anyones radars. 
Imagine playing a class and unlocking things for that class the more you play. Instead, we get random crap in loot boxes. They need to die already.
Just use high it auto adjusts as needed. I’m only on 1080p too. 
Lol I haven’t bought a game disc since 2013.
Lol @ you thinking spartans would be pencil necked dorks that blush and sweat at the first sign of any social interaction. 
What kind of ass backwards complaint is this?
Yeah? And? Wanna come over and help me out?
Omg why wouldn’t you be able to play each other 
What in the blue fuck I just got here from /r/all and these proportions look all wrong. 
It definitely bogs down over time, a restart helps it.
What the hell was this garbage?
*Your new empire?!*
Lol why even bother logging on for that. Just come on here. Another exotic everyone has duplicates of. This game is a joke now.
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
What’s with people asking if popular online games are dead? Someone asked if BF1 was dead too lol.
I love that they let the name “Donk City” through testing. Donk means a nice fat ass and I love that Mario is running that town.
I’m sick of it too, they should be banned. 
That’s just where the skin tone changes. You just sound like an insecure shrimp dick. 
Lol fuck that noise. I gave up on that. That one point means jack. It’s freaking tragic that D1 was my most played game and D2 is now my least played. 
Just looks like windows icons to me. 
Dude wat. All games reside on the hard drive whether you buy a disc or are full digital. 
You are not understanding. There is data on the actual disc that the Xbox is installing to its hard drive.

*then* it downloads updates and whatnot after the initial chunk of the game is installed.

Don’t wanna deal with that? Stop wasting money on slices of circular plastic and go purely digital. 
What kind of question is this, the game isn’t even old?
That’s freaking bs, makes me not want to finish the game 
Yes it did.
Literally the first thing I ordered with my OG 2013 XB1.... 
I’ll never understand people that make their iPhones look like cheap androids by installing crap themes/icons. 
I’ve watched it hundreds of times and this is my first time noticing it
If Fallout 4 is already improved then Skyrim will definitely benefit.
Where did I say that it can’t happen? And what do you think a surge protector does? 
Lol how the fuck is it complicated to contact the carrier when you see they’re delivering it to the wrong place via the shipment tracker? 
This is stupid. The Xbox has a built in surge protector so that is safe to plug into the wall. Plug everything else into a quality surge protector. 
That’s what instant on mode is for. I never have to wait for any updates because they’re done when I’m away at work. Use the machine as intended and you’ll have zero complaints.
??? Of course there’s a point freaking call them asap, you have the tracking number to YOUR order why would a stranger have your tracking number? How does your mind even work? 
No, it’s a skit. He’s Danieljean56 on instagram. 🙄
His IG name is danieljean56 
He’s danieljean56 on instagram and that was a skit. He really does run a chauffeuring business though. 
He’s danieljean56 on instagram and that was a skit. He really does run a chauffeuring business though.

He’s danieljean56 on instagram and that was a skit. 
Pick HDR standard and then run the picture calibration tool on the Xbox.
OP is desperate to troll. Fails miserably. Report and carry on folks.
Go seek help you demented fuck.
I’ll never understand why people rather sit at a desk hunched over a keyboard playing on a small PC monitor. Games are meant to be played on a big screen from the comfort of a couch.

inb4 “ackshually u can connect a PC to a tv and use controllers too” 🙄
I bought it and am having a blast with the single player.
I bought it and the single player is amazing so far 
I’ve never had any issues with it.
FFXV looks and plays amazing. Only reason I got back into it was because of the X.
Typical sheltered suburban kid post. This is a normal haircut you tard.
Bruh Final Fantasy XV is amazing. Got back into it because of my X. I’m loving it so far.
So should we all just buy a better power cable to avoid issues? 
Watch Farscape you freaking n00b.
Never fall for the “ready to start” message. Let it download in peace.
You seriously can’t afford a yearly subscription?
I’m not going to explain something that a simple google search can tell you. The XB1 has a bottleneck. Look it up. 
But did you push it in?
Did you definitely push the power cable all the way in to your Xbox? 
Push the power cord in all the way on the Xbox. I guarantee that you’re not pushing it all the way in.
Dude idgaf about numbers. There’s nothing for me to unlock. The armor is all dumbed down and the same. There’s no build to build. Exotics are no longer exotics and just rain down for everybody. Everything has been watered down into this boring bland paste that people like you keep convincing themselves tastes good. 
Dude, what? No. Load times are faster on external.
Then you won’t have an issue hooking up an external to the XB1. Connect one and carry on.
Plug directly into a wall outlet and make sure the power cord is firmly seated into the X.
On a 1080p Samsung. Sweet jesus does FFXV look gorgeous. Halo 5 looks amazing. I can’t wait for more patches to drop for my other games. 
Stop using Wi-Fi and connect via Ethernet cable. 
She’s not black you stupid sheltered suburban dweller.
Lol if you had actual hands on experience with an X you wouldn’t even be questioning it. 

And I have a 1080p TV. I can only imagine on a 4K.
Yes and looks better than the PS4 now. 
The games frame rate is already stabilized by the X. Everything else is just a cherry on top at this point.
All that resolution confined to a 28 inch monitor. Go bigger dude.
Please make sure the power cord is pushed *all* the way in on your Xbox.
If you have an X make sure you push the power cable ALL the way in til it won't go anymore.
I like that they’re modeled after the 90s movie turtles and not the lame 2000s version.
I’m actually pretty easy going but sure paint me however you want.
I play games to have fun. I got to 304 and now there’s no reason for me to keep playing. I’ve hit “the wall.” So now I’m having fun by progressing in other games. It’s not fun for me to do what amounts to spinning in circles going no where. 
I’m at 304, no incentive to hit 305, I did that stupid farm glitch just to get a New Monarchy hand cannon that I still haven’t even bothered to use.

No point to the raid.

No point to the PVP.

No point to the PVE.

I’ve been catching up on all my other games.
So just revert back to default and start from scratch. The calibration tool is pretty easy to use. 
I’m liking it so far so 🤷🏻‍♂️
Did you use the picture calibration tool in the Xbox itself? 
Have a goodnight dude.
How do I know if it’s in all the way? I feel like I put a good amount of force but I never got a reassuring click. 
But why... the phone is a tool not a digital picture frame.
Your breathing and mouth noises tho 🤨
It’s obvious that you don’t know what it does. 
I know what game mode is and it’s trash.
Calibrate your TV with the calibration tool the Xbox has built in. 
Who the heck uses game mode? Never ever use any of those garbage presets.
You sound sheltered and naive. It’s not meant to be consumed on a serious note. It was just fun/amusing. 
Wtf do you need a 4K UI for? You use it to launch games or apps from and the extra gig that would’ve been wasted on that went toward the games where it belongs. 
Lol wtf. You don’t need a 4K UI nor 4K app icons. The memory needed for that went to the games where it belongs. 
That’s weird, are the contacts clean? Anything in the port on the X?
You’ve activated wacky spinning mode.
Wow this makes sense. What if all those amazing social features in the new Call of Duty were suppose to be in D2 but instead got implemented into CoD for themselves?
WTF I didn't even notice it the first time
Still boggles my mind why they made this a 4 door sedan. It's suppose to be a muscle car.
LMFAO how is Call of Duty more Destiny than Destiny itself is? What in the actual fuck.
Whoow, I'll be buying this for sure.
