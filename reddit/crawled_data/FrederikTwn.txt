Haha, I thought you thought he was annoying, since you called him Dick Paul xD
Nice 2016 meme you got there.
It’s horrible, but I think it’s because r/gaming is targeting the casual players. 
Wrong sub. 


Somebody show them how chicken nuggets are made, specifically how they “deal” with the male chicks they can’t use.

I’m not vegan or anything, but food waste is kinda disgusting.

Uhh, trying to attention whore off of someone’s death, real classy!
Alternatively we should probably flay them alive before we burn the nerve endings.

I hate poachers. They just have to destroy that which is pure.
On a side note. Poachers need to be burned alive, put out. Allowed to heal.

It seems like you’re having fun with stuff like this, so you should def do it together.

Oh and why tf did he land the dart right next to her head and then throw another and hit her. Seems intentional.

“Broke down” 

A flat tire isn’t braking down. You can still drive it into the emergency lane. 

You could also, as a minimum, whether you can move it or not, put on the emergency blinker.
Someone with so little awareness of their surroundings that it’s a miracle they aren’t dead yet. 

I literally cannot fathom a train of thought where “I guess I’ll just change it in the middle of the highway” is the conclusion.

Probably the same guy who would cross a busy road, not at a stoplight, and crouch down to tie his shoe.
Rockstar is the real banger. Really hoped there’d be more like it.
I’m lvl 700 and I get accused of cheating daily, even by other prestige master. I’ve spent ~800 hours on this game, so it should be weird if I wasn’t good...

Some people just don’t want to accept that they’re the once who are bad.
You forgot the various “cheater” messages. 

And also, the people who think you cheat, so they make it their mission to teamkill and stun/ flash you all game.

Yeah, that’s the biggest downside for me too. Have you tried contacts? I haven’t, but if it’s like having a giant hair in your eye then no thanks...
They can hardly afford to do the devil eyes for more than .1 seconds, so I doubt they can afford to fill an entire church xD

Kidding, but they’ll definitely not get that far.
Yeah, that’s why I’ve been here for the last month, but I’ve fulfilled my quota of all the above mentioned posts and the constant reminder that these people exist, is now more sad than fun.
Nope, this post is a statement of fact. 


Put the hand in the microwave first, though, because it responds to heat too, I think.

No, because nobody actually uses the battery case :p

Jk, some might, but I think a lot of people use power banks.
If you buy a car with the word “Rogue” in it, what do you expect?
I just hope Harvey and Mike come up with a way of stopping it.

Yeah I know, but a few back and forth is better than none at all. Although, currently rewatching the show, season 1-2 do a lot better job of it.
The Mike - Harvey dynamic is what made the show so good, imo.

He even tried pulling that shit with the car and she clearly only wants him to care.

Did the writers forget the relationship they had prior to him running away, or the moment they had when he returned from Vegas and gave her the necklace?

I’m starting to doubt, which is sad, because I really thought we were headed in the right direction.
That fkin romantic dinner and he screwed it up. It’s obvious that they had to dumb down his character to make up for their terrible writing and plot.

So did he or didn’t he... 
Haha, thanks It's nice somebody likes it. I do feel like the post ep. discussions are nice, though!

This is one of my favorite shows. Sure it's not really up there with the big ones, but it's fun to watch once a week. which is what it's all about. 

To be honest, I too hate the constant flow of "my pet peeve, this show lately, I'm not going to watch anymore" posts. 

The show wasn't made for the people on here. 
Regardless of how you feel, stooping to their level really doesn't help make your case.

Apples and oranges... you can’t really compare them. The qc35 has decent sound, but the noise cancellation is great. The airpods don’t have noise cancellation, but t the audio is decent too.

What they Airpods do have, however, is the W1 chip, which means they’re on and connected whenever you need them.

Not only would the type of person you’re describing never read this, but they also wouldn’t come to the conclusion that there’s anything wrong with them having kids. Either because they’re too stupid to realize what consequences it has on the other person, or because they in some weird way think they deserve to have kids.

Assumed you meant 8700 or 8.7k... as, and I’ll repeat myself, just blurting our a cpu name seems weird.


I doubt I was the only one who assumed you were using it to imply a monetary value, especially since just dropping the cpu in your rig seems pointless on its own.

Easy. Go to your safe house and wait behind your motion activated turrets, trip mines and 16 feet walls.
Pick the briefcase and take the money, which you put inside your jacket. Then you stash the briefcase somewhere and once everybody is looking for it you deposit the money in the bank.

“Freshness”. Because they removed shit and slightly re skinned it.

Doctor: “open your eyes”

Patient: *opens eyes* “omg thanks”
Haha, that’s actually good in a way. I also cringe at those videos, but I guess I have a morbid fascination for the more crazy stuff.
Yeah it’s r/wtf material, but personally it’s just something I’d go “oh” at, then move on. To be fair, I can watch most things on WPD without any issues, but I stand by my definition. It has to be the more brutal ones that are NSFL, otherwise it loses its meaning. There should be two. A purple one for porn and stuff and the red one for gore. 
This time it actually does seem like they’ve done it correctly. CNN, as an example, is calling him a hostage taker, not a terrorist.

I think you’re missing my point. I don’t think it isn’t newsworthy, but I was referring to the “allegiance to Isis”  and the terror perspective. 

When the media runs these crazy ATTENTION ATTENTION articles on the front page, they’re spreading the terror. 

They should instead focus on the victims and what’s going on, disregarding the terrorist/ assailant. I don’t want them to completely leave out the Isis part, but just make it a detail rather than the center story.
There’s a pretty big difference between ignoring them, downplaying it and glorifying them with huge yellow banners in the paper and online, making sure everybody knows their name.
Fbiman is always watching.
Nah, don’t play s&d very often. 

Kinda cool anyways, dude :p
No need.
That’s all the media needs to give credit to ISIS.

Fear sells, but it would be nice if they’d just call them idiots and move on. The only reason they do it is for the attention.
There’s something you don’t see every day /s
People like you ruin the NSFL tag.

NSFL has to actually be some crazy death, preferably on the gory side. Porn isn’t NSFL lol. 
“Who the hell pays for movies”

“Who the hell pays for tv shows”

Also, not everybody can be content with 480/720p.

Sorry, dude, some people just can’t see it.

Last heartbreak? Chloe reveals that she actually likes Lucifer instead and it literally kills pierce. Not really, but something along those lines.
It’s pretty damn obvious.

The way he sat there looking at Pierce and Chloe leaving together and then he went straight for Linda’s office(possibly).


ESPECIALLY that necklace scene. So much emotion, but completely gone by the next. I know it’s due to the change in schedule, but I want it to be slightly more consistent.
The suspense is where a lot of the excitement is.
Somehow people are still confused about this...
“If Lucifer can have it why can’t you”

“Oh shit he’s right”

Only moron Cain figured he literally meant that he could have Chloe ...

I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.
Went out with a few mates after getting glasses, a week or so after. One decided “haha, group hug” we’re 20-21... got a smudge on the top half of my left lens and I was driving home, had to stare at it for 1 hour.

Amateur. Drill holes in the mannequin and pour the ground up remains into it and reseal hole. Then bury one mannequin with the remains inside, another body, from a morgue, and then an empty mannequin on top.

The actual Cloverfield trilogy:

Cloverfield 1: all the first one

Cloverfield 2: the ending ~5 mins with the monsters

Cloverfield 3: a blurry shadow for 5 seconds and a giant monster for 5 seconds.
That’s because only the shadowy monster scene and the last 5 seconds of the movie was actual cloverfield clips. 
So fkin stupid.

And why the fuck would his hand move when the people in the alternate universe are dead, unless the hand is connected to him in the past of the universe they traveled to, before they scramble the universes and then they just happen to guess everything, including where the gyro is and that he’ll lose his arm... horrible movie.

Because it’s so bad they hoped they could release it and pray nobody watched that garbage. Netflix, however, said nah fam they gon see. Bought the movie and made everybody watch.
> at times

Read: from 00:00-1:44:27


Not very clear is an understatement.

There’d have to be attempts at explanations for it to not be clear. All we got were vague dialog exposition.
I went to the bathroom after watching the movie and looking into the bowl I believe I’ve made something more enjoyable to watch... 

I hope Netflix got it for free, because it’s really bad.

It’s too stupid to be fun. 

Sharknado was fun until they overdid it, because it has zero potential, but is so ridiculous that it’s funny.

This movie had tremendous potential and it was executed so poorly I wish I was the one about to get eaten by monsters or a fkin wall...
Don’t kid yourself...
So many things left unanswered and irrelevant things being shown. We’ve basically wasted our time watching nothing happen and nothing being concluded. 

I believe they originally made another movie, realized it sucked ass and said fuck it, wanna try and fit monsters and shit into it just for lolz??
It does because they have two lines of dialogue with “monsters” “these things” being mentioned and we see some monster shadows and a giant monster for 5 seconds.

Terrible movie, just like Clovercield lane.
I just watched it and it was terrible.

Don’t get me wrong, the cinematography was awesome and the special effects were what you’d expect from a sci first space movie, but the plot... so many holes and so terribly paced and just overall bad. They have this super cool concept and every single movie they just fuck it up...
You had to ruin it, didn’t you...
