I know English is flawed, as does anyone who's tried to use both the written language and the spoken language.

Generally, in English speaking countries, numbers have the following pattern, where 1 billion euros and 10 cents would be written as follows:

‚Ç¨1,000,000,000.10 (though 1 000 000 000.1 is not wrong, it isn't in common usage).

In spanish 1 billon y 1/10 would be written as:

1.000.000.000,10 ‚Ç¨

Technically we're all EU citizens, as a part of the UK's EU citizenship, as we're all fully British (no drawbacks).

Hence, these *are* European union passports, but pureblood Islanders (e.g. My dad, as his family is fully Jersey) have a little notice saying they don't benefit from EU movement rights.

Well, this is kind of interesting and I'm not fully versed in it, but:

First, there's your passport, which is the traditional UK passport. This is the main one. You get FoM to all 27 EU Countries and all other VWPs of which UK is a part. Pretty simple.

Now, due to colonial times, as you might know, the remaining colonies are known as BOTs, BOT Citizens used to have British (Overseas Territory) Citizenship, which meant they couldn't move to the UK, but that law was changed and now all BOTCs are British, but they don't have EU rights.

My passport is a Jersey one (and the Guernsey one and the Isle of Man one is the same). We are considered British Citizens and are such internationally - we can live in the UK, can use UK visa deals and British embassies, once we live in the UK for a while we can get your style passport. However, unless you, like I, have UK "links", Jersey Citizens don't have EU Citizenship.

Interestingly, the Jersey passport is exactly the same on the inside (except where it says 'United Kingdom' on yours it says 'Jersey' on ours), except Her Majesty's request which is issued under the name of our lieutenant governor (hm representation), instead of rhe the SOS).

They don't want freedom of movement.

They don't want to pay a fee to travel there (as EU citizens won't have to to come here).
That's not a visa cost. It's an ESTA cost, and it only applies when arriving by air or by sea (so if you were to cross the border from Canada, you wouldn't need an ESTA).

What he was asking is whether the EU has costs for other non-EU countries?
No. 

Some countries (Annex II), in which the UK would alomst definetly be, as would EU Citizens be in the UK's visa waiver program.

A VWP is a system where citizens of certain countries are allowed to enter a country (not work) without a visa. In the US, they also require an ESTA when arriving by air or sea. The UK grants citizens of some countries 6 months free access.

In fact, France was the first European country to waive VISAs for British citizens (in 1947).

The British passport is tied fourth as one of the strongest world passports (number of VWPs).
Is this going to apply to all countries?

> We voted for Brexit and do not deserve nice things

  


They have to bring Brexit into every single conversation! They're obessesed with it and then say "Brexit isn't the only important issue, there are other things that the Tories \*are\* wrecking."

  


And again:

  


> Brexit.

  


> The political views of the people. I hate the notion that people seem to be leaning to that we should close ourselves off on our little island and take care of ourselves and do nothing else, and the increasing American-style view that poor people are poor because they deserve it.

> worst thing is the over the top nationalism of thinking we're great when we're shit. Like every football event we expect to win like we're football gods or something, despite having average players.

  


Apparently you can't be proud of your country anymore!! Also, isn't the English team losing \*all the time\* a running joke?

This has nothing to do with tax rates though. That's because we're the thirteenth densest jurisdiction in the world and, apart from the front, resistant to any tall buildings. We could build plenty of flat blocks on the outskirts of town, but planning regulations and cost make it difficult.

It‚Äôs fair because that company is their asset. They invested in it in hope of a return, and that is their return. Putting money into that company was a risk, they could have lost their money if a few wrong decisions had been made. You seem to think that these shareholders are some sort of clan that are above everyone else by their existence and that they put no work in but are just magically given money because they‚Äôre rich - that‚Äôs false. They had money from theirs (or their ancestors) labour (which could have been working on a farm everyday of their life, or buying some land in what is now an affluent area of London for pennies and is now worth millions). 

Also, the worker who is making this ¬£1000 product doesn‚Äôt actually own any part of the production process (the materials, the tools, the land on which the factory is built). They are just in a contract where their labour is bought in return for a promise from the bank that piece of paper has value, and is upheld by the law. If they went out and mined the iron ore, smelted it into shape, pieced the product together and then sold it for ¬£1000, then all that money is for them, but they didn‚Äôt, they simply provide a service (their time and energy) to the owners of the company, and then the owners give them some of their money in return. 
So, if we've left the EU, it won't apply to us.
Yeah, but you know that wouldn't be addressing the wants of the Leave side - or anyone, really.
Farenheit increments are smaller than celcius increments. ‚àÜ1.8¬∞F = ‚àÜ1¬∞C 
Yeah, that was never going to happen before Brexit. Auf Wiedersehen!

Also, Spain and Germany don't completely allow dual citizenship

DE:

> Germany allows dual citizenship with other EU countries and Switzerland; dual citizenship with other countries is possible with special permission or if obtained at birth; children of non-EU/non-Swiss legal permanent residents can have dual citizenship if¬†born and grown up¬†in Germany (the parents born and grown up abroad must have resided in Germany for at least eight years and must have had the legal-permanent-resident status for at least three years, and usually cannot have dual citizenship themselves).

ES:

> In Spain, Spanish citizens by descent can have dual citizenship; Spanish laws knows a "dormant citizenship" for citizens naturalizing in Iberoamerican countries: They do not lose their citizenship, but their status and their rights as citizens of Spain‚Äîand of the EU‚Äîare inactive until they move back to Spain. Foreigners wanting to naturalize in Spain must usually renounce their old citizenship; exceptions are made for citizens of some Iberoamerican countries, Puerto Rico, Andorra, the Philippines, Equatorial Guinea, and Portugal. Since 2014, Spain has granted Spanish nationality to¬†Sephardi Jews¬†regardless of nationality.

So, you'd have to renounce British Citizenship.
Ok, just wait until you have met all the requirements. You still have FoM until 2021, and are allowed to stay there until after that time.
I thought this just applied to EU Member States, not EEA members? As we won't be in the union for long and we aren't in Schengen, I don't see why anyone would bother implementing it.
I'm assuming you haven't as you said you've lived in Britain foe most of your adult life.

As an Australian Citizen (and a British Citizen in the future), you will continue to have the right to travel to the EU for 90 days in any 180 day period (so half a year). So unless it was your intention to one day move to Europe (then why haven't you yet), it won't affect you.
Did you ever use Freedom of Movement?

> Moves to somewhere else in his own country.
But they can't... Because we won't be in the EU.
I agree. I don't think they should be compulsory, but they would be damn useful (before Brexit even more).
But why?
Damn Americans, using Farenheit.
Well the schools went back in today...
> greater economic and social freedom

So do I and I'm a Conservative.

Plus, how is nationalising all the industry and prohibiting setting up businees economic "freedom"?
I'd say, and I'd hope you'd agree, despite your personal views, that for Brexit to really (not technically) have happened, we can no longer be "subservient" to the EU.

This generally means:

* All laws have to be passed via Parliament.
* We can make our own trade deals.
* We can say *no* to the EU.
> Because I'm on the hard left and I find it insulting, and really fucking ignorant, that you should compare us to the hard right.

Who am I talking about here?

* Opposes NATO
* Opposes EU
* Supports Large Government
* Wants to remove freedoms and rights

Not been to MAN specifically, but I think in the UK everyone has to go through Security again (unless you've come from somewhere else in the British Isles) (at least that's the case at Gatwick and Heathrow).

**Transferring from an international flight to a domestic flight**

On disembarking from the aircraft follow the signs for "Flight Transfer". If you are arriving at Terminal 1 proceed on foot to the Flight Transfer Centre. If you are arriving at Terminal 2 or Terminal 3 you will need to take the transfer bus over to the Flight Transfer Centre at Terminal 1. Once at the Flight Transfer Centre you will be required to go through security and border control checks. Once you have cleared these controls, follow the signs to Terminal 3 and check the flight information screens for the gate of your onward flight.

If no gate information is shown please proceed to the Terminal 3 Departure Lounge. To enter and leave the Terminal 3 Departure lounge please note that you will be required to go through a facial biometric enrolment and reconciliation process. If you don't have your boarding card you will need your confirmation of onward travel to enrol at the biometrics. If you require boarding cards they will be issued either at the Flight Transfer Centre or at the gate by your airline's handling agent.

Also, the shopping *centre* charges an entry fee customers who don't work in the centre buy. You could instead board up your inside door and knock a hole into the car park. Customers don't have to pay the fee anymore, but you're still technically a centre shop owner, so no entry fee.
I meant a better deal for the customer: cheaper, less tariffs.

In the real world, customers won't exclusively go to Tesco, they'll come to us as well. Canada set up shop right next to Walmart and they're doing pretty well in sales. Japan are right next to the world's biggest supermarket, and they're the 3rd busiest shop on the high street.

Except you sell different items from Tesco, you're willing to let more people join your club card, and your prices are lower. Tesco's may have the brand, and the larger shop, but you have a better deal.

Except Tesco have heard about this, and want your store to have their branding, they want you to still sell the same goods, and they neither want you to sell goods at a lower price than them nor want you to set up your own club card. Also, they want ¬£29 billion in cash because it's your turn to set up the Christmas party.
That's a terrible analogy.
Why not?
Your link says 52% want to go ahead.

Also, polls were drastically wrong about Brexit before the vote, what's to say they're any better now?

The top 20% are 65 million, about the population of the UK.
There was no threshold, as it wasn't legally binding. Cameron sets the terms out that a majority vote for Leave, meant we would leave. 52% of people voted on that conscience. Naturally, in something like this, most people who are undecided will vote for the status quo.
To ~~remainers~~ remoaners that deal / no deal referendum is a "choice" between bad and "oh god no why". 

A majority of Remainers have accepted the result of a democratic vote and actually want to get the best situation out of it for our country. 
Yeah like the fishermen.

```A recycling bin (or recycle bin) is a container used to hold recyclables before they are taken to recycling centers.[1] Recycling bins exist in various sizes for use inside and outside homes, offices, and large public facilities. Separate containers are often provided for paper, tin or aluminum cans, and glass or plastic bottles, or may be commingled.```

```Many recycling bins are designed to be easily recognizable, and are marked with slogans promoting recycling on a blue or green background along with the universal recycling symbol. Others are intentionally unobtrusive. Bins are sometimes in different colors so that user may differentiate between the types of materials to be placed in them. While there is no universal standard, the color blue is commonly used to indicate a bin is for recycling in public settings.```

```Recycling bins or cans, or carts are a common element of municipal kerbside collection programs, which frequently distribute the bins to encourage participation.```
Do you seriously believe the rich hold *all* the Wealth in America?
Well, the poll never explained what the alternative is. I'd be in support of a "Accept/Don't Accept, Goodbye" referendum, which would be accepted anyway. But I wouldn't be in support of a "Accept/Remain" referendum.
Chemical Weapons are against international law. We have a duty as people who stand up for international rights, freedom and justice to ensure that evil dictators, like Assad, know that there are serious consequences to breaking international law, otherwise this whole thing falls apart, and last time a global supranational "league" fell apart, that was hardly good for anyone.

Hi. This is iGCSE, which most people don't do. And your links don't work.
 **Shakespeare**

(a) - Pick out a few (~5) lang (word choice etc.), structure (repetition, sentence length, or structure of the extract), and form (prose/Iambic pentameter). Then link that back to the question. To get 8/9, you really have to know what's going on with Shakespeare Speak. Read the translation of the play (or some key scenes) to make sure you understand what's going on. You might notice some techniques (like similies). Get to know the meanings of Shakespeare's use of some techniques (e.g. Prose tends to be lower class, so Macbeth uses prose when talking to the murderers).

(b) Answer the question in 5 bullet point statements (DON'T USE THE EXTRACT!!!). Then, get 2 or 3 quotes that (at least vaguely) link to the point. You don't need L/S/F, but use a bit of technical terminology to impress the examiner. Know a good few context points, you should aim to link about 4 into your essay

**Post 1945**

You have a choice between a *theme/symbol* or a *character/relationship.*  You will be given an "inspirational" quote, so use it. Do much the same as Shakespeare B, but either go more in-depth or write a few more points, as it's out of 40 marks. You may need a few more contextual points.You need *impecable* SPaG, and a good breadth of vocab (used in the write context) and technical terminology. (8 marks).

**19th C Fiction**

Again, there may be some more archaic vocab, so read through key passages and get definitions.

(a) - Much like Shakespeare A, pick every word apart. These novelists most likely had a reason for every word they use, whether it's imagery, structure etc. Even stupid things like "blue" has connotations of sadness that foreshadows the character's sadness later on in the book.

(b) - DON'T USE THE EXTRACT. DON'T USE CONTEXT. If anything, this makes it more difficult, as you need to write more about the book. Know quite a few more quotes.

**Poetry**

You need to compare the poems. Make sure they have even attention.

(a) - Learn 6 poems well, and the others just know a bit of context for the rest. You need to analyse, bring in context and answer the question in every point you make.

(b) - This is the hardest question. Know some common LSF techniques and try to figure out the point(s) the poet was trying to make here.

Many of them can be transposed from EU deals because we were party to them. People call this a divorce, so we should get some assets as well, as they were negotiated with us as part of it.

They didn't offer Canada, who borders them, didn't get a trade deal before we joined the EU.


Ok, 1 Jan2020
Yes. I thought this was always on the table?
clap clap clap
Yes, but being in the Common Market requires open\-door immigration and following most EU laws.
I'm in support of a situation such as that which Canada and the US have:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa\_Waiver\_Program#Citizens\_of\_Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Waiver_Program#Citizens_of_Canada)

>**Citizens of Canada \(Visa Waiver Program\)**  
>  
>Canadian citizens do not require a non\-immigrant visa when entering the United States, except those Canadians that fall under nonimmigrant visa categories E, K, S, or V,[\[83\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Waiver_Program#cite_note-83)[\[84\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Waiver_Program#cite_note-84) but under different legislation from the Visa Waiver program.[\[85\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Waiver_Program#cite_note-85) However, they must still establish that they meet the requirements of the appropriate status they wish to enter in. For example, while a [Canadian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadians) intending to study in the U.S. does not need to present [Form I\-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I-20_(form)) at a U.S. embassy or consulate in order to receive an F\-1 visa like other foreigners, they must still be issued a Form I\-20 and present it at the Port of Entry to establish their eligibility for F\-1 status.[\[86\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Waiver_Program#cite_note-86)  
>  
>Citizens of Canada who enter as visitors are exempted from being fingerprinted or photographed under US\-VISIT and do not require a machine readable passport. US Customs and Border Protection decides whether to allow entry based on non\-immigrant intent. The maximum permitted length of stay is one year but can be extended,[\[87\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Waiver_Program#cite_note-87) although CBP usually considers six months to be the maximum permitted per calendar year, except under unusual circumstances \(such as medical treatment\).

But if that isn't possible, the UK already operates its own "Visa Waiver Program"

> British Nationals who are not [European Union citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_European_Union) and citizens of 56 countries and territories are visa\-exempt for stays in the UK of up to 6 months \(or 3 months if they enter from the Republic of Ireland\) 

And it's likely that that will be extended to EU citizens post\-Brexit \(considering that was our EU policy before joining [https://i.imgur.com/qb2rWU1.png](https://i.imgur.com/qb2rWU1.png)\) because we allow the citizens of Namibia to enter visa free.
Ignoring a problem won't make it go away. If 52&#37; of voters voted *against* the status quo, implementing what is effectively a worse version of that won't make those voters go away, realistically it will make them come back.
I mean, there is the geographical issue, something that can only be replicated by the EU.
No? It's not happening until 2019 \- and we aren't actually really leaving until 2021 \(I think, when does the TD end?\).
> If negotiations begin the day after Brexit, the U.K. is at a disadvantage as they‚Äôre now desperate. 

We still have the transition deal \- during which we will likely negotiate an FTA with the EU.

>Doubtful it would happen though

Trump seems to want one, and he will be president until ~~2019~~ EDIT: 2021
>So we will be left with a huge gap between leaving our old agreement and getting the new one as we negotiate with no guarantee it will be as good as the one we already have. Great.

Transition deal?
> The capacity problems will all be on the UK side.

It shows you how close the Germans feel to the EU.
I'd think it's more that because of our geography, we never gre as close to other European countrie, e.g. because we had no land border with other countries, us and Ireland never joined Schengen, but instead stayed on our own, and because we never joined the Euro, we never saw the benefit of unity.

If we go to say Spain, we still have to change our money, get a passport etc.

Maybe because he works with money.

Why does anyone give a shit what the author of this article thinks?
Yeah, reverse-racist to blacks.
I feel like our country is not as European as the EU27 is, mainly because of our history of being an island, and also the Empire.

It's also why the EU institutions are viewed more negitavely here than there. We feel like all but 1 of the other EU members are truly foreign to us, so we feel like we are being "controlled" by the other 27.

The Comission were checking it against EU law, it still needs to be checked by UK Law.

If the UK Law had accepted it, and then the Comission blocked it, it wouldn't be allowed through, despite our govt (who represnt the UK pop. much better than the EU ever can) allowing it.
Honestly, it's crazy that the tories aren't supporting more home building. After all, homeowners are more likely to vote Tory, so they are effectively losing a large chunk of their voter base.
Which?
If someone died whilst you were *doing* the exam? They'd provably let you go and then follow normal procedure for missing an exam (although if you wanted, you could probably ask to keep your current paper).
You could use BBC bitesize, but i recommend getting Oxford's revision series.
In the OED, it says 'dated, offensive', it doesn't for firewomen.


"complaining with no reason"

Also complaining with no reason actually oppresses minorities, so you can't do it. 
Yeah but at the time, the British Parliament has Irish representatives in it. The govt. of Ireland did technically declare war on Ireland. You could argue, in that case that the UK has never, because the current UK has a different name (hence is a different country).
Tigether they find a balance of consumer benefit and profit. If the price is too high, the consumer looks elsewhere for a better deal. If the price is too low, the company runs at a poss and goes bankrupt.
A little wrong.

**The UK and Britain**

The UK is a *sovereign* country (unitary state comprised of three countries (Wales is definetly a country) and one country/region/province (although I wouldn't call it a country because "Ireland" is more the country, which goes across two sovreign states). Britain is a colloquial short name for the state (much like America is used to refer to USA (despite Hawaii not being in the Americas). Britain was the original name for England/Wales, which was then expanded to Britanny and Scotland.

**Great Britain and Ireland**

Great Britain (also referred to as Britain by some) is a geographical term that only refers to the island on which most of England, Scotland and Wales are. Ireland refers to the Island of Ireland, but also the sovreign country (known also as the Republic).

**WTF is an overseas territory and crown dependency?**

The UK owns some oberseas territories (colonial remenants) to which Parliament has given the right of self-governance (and hence can remove). There are also some crown dependencies, which are de facto owned by the UK, but de jure aren't. These 3 "states" have their own sovreignity (basically the head of state in the BOTs is *the Queen in right of the United Kingdom*, but CDs is *the Queen in right of Jersey/Guernsey/the Isle of Man). The CDs have self-government by right, not by grant, but give powers of international relations, military, currency, in exchange for benefits (protection - although that didn't work out well for us, the backing of the British economy).

Realistically, the CDs are much closer to the UK than its OTs are, mainly beacsue of identity (the native inhabitants of these isles are British by nature, not by colonial force) - such as using the Pound, having open borders with the UK (everyone from the CI flies through Gatwick), speaking English.

**British Isles and Islands**

There are two other geographical terms. The first is the controversial (in the RoI), "British Isles", an archipelago, referring to the CDs, Ireland and Great Britain (and all close islands, like Anglesey and Shetland). The second is the "British Islands", basically the same, but excluding the RoI (on Jersey passports it says "British Islands - Bailiwick of Jersey).

  
Let's break this down into what I think is three seperate points being made, which are: That the UK has no far-right parties of relevance, that far-right parties are on the ascendent in EU countries and that the Remainer affiliation to the EU is based on progressivism rather than anything else.  
  
> In the first instance, the UK has no far-right parties "of note" because the Tories are far-right enough as it is. 

OH MY GOD GUYS!!!!! THE TORIES ARE *LITERALLY HITLER*. But seriously, do you see the Tories as a far-right party?

> Do I really need to remind you that the entire reason we had the referendum was because Cameron was terrified of losing more and more Conservative voters to UKIP? So rather than compete with them, they just absorbed UKIP policy into their own? 

UKIP's policy was to just flat out leave the EU. Furthermore, surely if 52% vote to leave, it doesn't matter what the intent is, it shows that people didn't like the EU.

> The far-right may not be politically relevant right now but neither was UKIP in 2014. That shit can change real fast.  Hell, if you want evidence that the current Conservative Party supports, even implicitly, the actions or policies of the Far-right then maybe we ought to look for an instance of a current Tory Cabinet Member offering congratulations to some far-right fuckwit?

Again, Hungary is our ally (in both NATO and the EU). The country had a democratic election. It is tradition and only natural for the government to congratulate the winner.

I didn't see you (as in Remainers) complaining when Jean-Claude Juncker wrote a *letter* of congratulations to Putin - who isn't our ally, wasn't democratically elected, and is *so* much more far right than Orban.
  
> 2: One of the oldest tools of the far-right is populism. Another is nationalism. Apply enough of each and you can convince a lot of people to vote for you. I wouldn't say this necessarily indicates a taste for fascism in the EU, especially not given that anti-EU sentiment has rarely been higher and thus never been easier to exploit.  

I really hopw you aren't suggesting Leaving the EU is dascist.

> This argument of yours *might* have held water if it was an EU-exclusive trend, but it isn't. From newcomers like Trump to the old guard like Putin to where-the-fuck-did-you-come-froms like Duterte, the world's voting systems are swinging to the right on the political pendulum. However, the thing about pendulums is they tend to swing in a minimum of two directions.

Then how come West Germany or Japan didn't swing far-left after WW2?
  
> 3: Progressivism undoubtedly motivates some people in the Remain camp just as much as racism probably motivates at least some people in the Leave camp. 

I'd say it's a lot bigger on the remain camp. 

> That said...honestly if "progressive" is the worst thing you can call us then you should maybe look for a book of insults or something.  

"Progresssivism" isn't very "progressive" in some people's eyes. It may be in yours but everyone has different political beliefs.

> Oh, and as for your last comment, it's a bit rich to hear you mock our view of the EU when Leavers basically think it's a kleptocratic circle-jerk where literally everyone except UK citizens gets everything they want.

Actually, quite a lot of Leavers believe that no country (except Germany) really benefits from the EU. Just look at NF. He was ovwrjoyed when M5S won a majority in the Italian elections.

Firewoman is an official term *in the dictionary*. Trump is not out of line for using it. 
Yes, there's the gender-neutral term "firefighter" but fire man and woman refer to individual people in the role.
If we were in Nazi Germany, that post wouldn't be allowed.
If we really were in Nazi Germany, this post wouldn't be allowed and OP would be off to a concentration camp right now.
Oh yeah because the media simply ~~love~~ Trump.


I do find this joke quite funny, I'll admit - but I hope you're not in Britain, otherwise it's off to the gaol with you!
A "fireman" is now sexist. I guess the word "man" is now oppresive, instead we should call them "scum of the earth", is that better?
Her is a mysoginitistic word as it was probably made by men to oppress wopeople.

I was thinking about it, and what they all really want the most is acceptance.

Hermione feels left out because she grew up as a Muggle, and on finding out she was a witch, thought no-one would accept her because of it (also she loved books). She strived for acceptance (maybe a metaphor for racism and xenophobia, as those are core "themes" of the book).

Ron feels left out because she wasn't as good as any of his brothers, and despite his expectations being so much higher, he wouldn't have been as duly recognised. He wanted to be accepted for himself, not just as a Wealey, but also pressured to acheive more than his brothers.

Harry feels left out because he grew up constantly being looked down upon by family and excluded by peers at school, Furthermore because of his special situation (being the "Chosen One"), he wanted to be accepted as a normal person.

I'm not convinced Clinton wouldn't have started a Dynasty.

I know that. What I'm saying is that you can't expect NI to be split of from GB, without expecting the same from Ireland. A hard border in the Irish Sea is just as absurd as a hard border between Ireland and the EU.
OK. If Ireland were to have a referedum on the Customs Union, we can agree that they would vote remain. So, the reason why we can't have a hard border between Ireland and the EU is because of Irish popular opinion, so why is Irish popular opinion more important that British popular opinion.
No, you would be breaking the law by violating border police if you just rammed through, also breaking airport security if you came by plane.

The rain flows calmly over every part of your body, it consumes your taste with the the tasteless taste of water. It beats down on you like the sun did but weeks ago. Ah the sweet memory of the shining Summer sun! You feel the water dampen your shoes and you feel the cold creeping up your leg, grabbing your insides for a breath of fresh, warm air. The soft patter of the rain around you, compared to the violent splashing of children's wellies in shallow puddles. But water has no smell, no smell of summer barbacues, no smell of sun cream, no smell of the approaching summer break, only the smell of emptiness and despair, similar to the emptiness you feel as the summer is extracted carelessly from your body.
a) this has nothing to do with FoM

b) Northern Ireland is an integral part of the UK, it is not leaving the UK has no desire to leave the UK.
Ok, so you must be an advocate for a hard border then.

There won't be border between the UK and Northern Ireland because NI IS the UK.
The thing is is that NI's exports to the UK outnumber their exports to the EU, so it's more beneficial to them economically to have an open customs border with the UK.

Also, it's an odd situation to have Northern Ireland as part of the UK but with a different international trading policy. What if the UK and EU have disagreements politically, say with the US "Trade War", or if the UK was to go to war with one of the EU's largest trading partner, so the UK puts sanctions on them etc.?

With the DUP, the political situation in NI is very unfortunate, as the DUP doesn't represent most people's views. NI is very 'one-issue' politics, with the Republic being the one issue. Unionists want a strong opposition to Sinn Fein and the DUP are their best option.
At the the crux of August, as all the British holidaymakers flock off to their tacky 3 star all-inclusive Benidorm, Majorca or Tenerife resorts, the never-to-end encroaching rainclouds undexpectedly but rhythmically traverse the Atlantic Seas, drumming up their thundering storms, to hit the British coasts with torrential rain, floods, and a national crisis.

The Common Travel Area means that passports aren't checked when travelling within the British Isles.

Let's say you have just got on a plane from Dublin and have landed in Heathrow. You arrive in the Domestic Area as a domestic passenger. The airline will have checked your ID, but not the border authorities. When you land, you can walk straight from plane to pavement without have show your passport to anyone. However, when travelling from the Republic and the Crown Dependencies, British Police can check ID to prove your nationality. That isn't up for negotiation in these negotiations and is a non\-issue \- British and Irish citizens will continue to be allowed to pass between the two countries without being checked. When going to Schengen countries, Irish citizens will go in the EU line, and we'll go in the rWorld line, on the other hand, when coming back to the UK, British and Irish Citizens will go in the UK Line, and EU Citizens will go in the rWorld line.

The issue is with the Customs border. Where would you place it?

The color of the sidewalk was not pretty. Me and my friend were riding the elevator to the thirtieth floor because our cab, which we had decided to take instead of the subway because of the new expressway, but unfortunately there was a detour across the overpass on the route and then ran out of gas so we sat in a parking lot for a few minutes, had just dropped us off on the curb across the street from the first floor of the apartment building, so we crossed the crosswalk. My mom and dad were enjoying the last of the fall sunshine. I opened my can of soda as my vest and sneakers started to dry from the rain. I ate my potato chips and my french fries for which I had written a check at the theater. My parents love eating zucchini with their baked potato, but hated waiting in the takeout line at the store, so they kept it in the trunk with their tire, which they had come in the mail. I was looking forward to my Vacation, but I had to apologize for the odor of my baby's diaper. I gave him a pacifier and took him to the restroom to be changed. I gave my toddler some candy, specifically some cotton candy, and turned on the flashlight on my cell phone, as it was too dark. I chucked the smelly diaper in the trash and waved to my favorite neighbor, who had a great sense of humor, but rumor has it always got a tie on the soccer field, because he always kicked counterclockwise. He was a bit crazy though. He had clothespins round his dish towel and was utterly enamored by the harbor. His aluminum-colored mustache was definitely his specialty. At least he had a different zip code. But he was strange. period.

2. Don't come on our site.

If they're sued then they can just point to that and go: "You had a choice. We require our content partners to follow our indexing policies."

A report by the European Commisionm showed that:

1. More brits have used the railways 'at least once' \(73&#37; vs 63&#37;\) and never is the other way round \(27&#37; vs 37&#37;\)
2. Provision of train timetables in vastly superior in the UK \(35&#37; vs 17&#37; saying they were very satisfied\).
3. The cleanliness of UK stations is vastly better as well, with 85&#37; vs 76&#37; saying they were satisfied.
4. **Actually, all of the following things were ranked better in the UK:**
5. Frequency of trains
6. Punctuality and reliability
7. The provision of information during the journey.
8. The availability of staff on trains
9. Cleanliness and good maintenance of rail carriages
10. Bicycle access on trains

In fact on the 'Satisfication Index of Railway travels'

Britain ranked first in the EU, again on railways stations and travel.

*Of course*, we rank pretty low on satsfication of accessibility. Oh Wait! The UK ranks best there again! *In fact*, in accessivility of the booking service 18&#37; *more* British respondants said they were very satisfied with the accessibility of the booking process.

>Taking all the results together, the United Kingdom \(52&#37;\), Ireland \(56&#37;\) and France \(52&#37;\) have the highest level of respondents who score high or good on the satisfaction

So, *no*, I don't think *SNCF* offer a better service, and certainly *not* over the next 3 months.

[Here's a link to the sauce.](http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/flash/fl_382a_en.pdf)

Edit:

Let's talk about price. Yes, price is where we rank terribly in the EU and it's the biggest issue facing us. I think that stems from lack of competition on British railways.

[Here's an image of how British railway money gets spent.](http://static3.uk.businessinsider.com/image/55d301ae2acae732118c0c52-1333-1000/passenger-pound.jpg)

As you can see 3&#37; of ticket price goes into the companies pockets. **11\%** goes into leasing trains, **and** 26p goes into the rail network. This is needed because our railway network fell behind in investment after years of nationalisation and government neglect. That's why we, excluding Ireland, Denmark and Luxembourg are the only Western European Country to not have a high speed rail \(of over 230km/h\), excluding HS1. 
Southern Rail strikes are confined to Southern Rail, whereas SNCF affects the whole country.

If there were to be a situation like Southern with a Neo\-British Rail, we would end up with Rail Strikes across the whole country.

Under a properly privatised system, rail strikes would mean another company could 'swoop in' and fill in the service holes, meaning that companies would be more pressurised to fix their staff problems and staff would be happier to compromise because they both know if they let strikes happen for too long, its their company that will go down the toilet.

Mr Deputy Speaker,

I think that repaling BST and replacing it with UTC+1 would be a better alternative for Britain. I think this for 4 reasons:

5 reasons to stay on BST all year round:

Energy Savings - A report from the Policy Studies Institute estimated that consumers could save ¬£260 million a year on electricity bills - and that was in the mid-1990s. More recently, researchers at the University of Cambridge found that an extra daily hour of sunlight in winter could save ¬£485 million each year, as people use less electricity and heating. That has the same effect as eliminating the carbon emissions of 70,000 people.

Business Hours in winter with Europe, as opposed to GMT. It would also mean we would have one hour overlap with the Chinese, meaning easier business year round.

Safety - A three-year experiment to keep British Summer Time year-round, held between 1968 and 1971, found an 11% reduction in road casualties in England and Wales during the hours affected by the time change - and a 17% reduction in Scotland. In addition, the Home Office believes crime would see a 3% drop, as crime is more likely to be committed in the evening than in the morning.

Lighter and longer winter evenings could provide an annual boost of ¬£3.5 billion to the tourist industry, according to the Tourism Alliance. The yearly income boost from the 60-80,000 extra jobs this would create could amount to ¬£720 million

Public Health - The Lawn Tennis Association and the England and Wales Cricket Board have all backed year-round daylight savings, and with good reason. The extra hour of daytime increases the time available for exercise, makes people more likely to attend evening sporting events, improving national fitness and health (NHS Savings!) and means professional athletes can train for longer.

Why is the United Kingdom excluded from the name. Why isn't the United Kingdom Islands, or the Isle of Man Islands. It's a historic geographical term. 'Britain' has a loose definition. 

> Why is Ireland completely excluded from the name?

Also, remember than 1/5 of Ireland is *still* British, so by extension, the Island of Ireland is, as the Island of Hispanola is Haitian, still, in part, British.
No I meant: "appealed to my feminist ideals" and "desire to be a minority."

> A group of islands lying off the coast of north-western Europe, from which they are separated by the North Sea and the English Channel. They include Britain, Ireland, the Isle of Man, the Isle of Wight, the Hebrides, the Orkney Islands, the Shetland Islands, the Scilly Isles, and the Channel Islands.

The official dictionary definition of the British Isles (Oxford).

Also, Collins
> a group of¬†islands¬†in¬†WEurope, consisting of¬†GreatBritain,¬†Ireland, the¬†Isle¬†of¬†Man, Orkney,¬†Shetland, the¬†Channel¬†Islands¬†belonging¬†to Great Britain, and the islands¬†adjacent¬†to these

Even the yanks
> island group of western Europe comprising Great Britain, Ireland, and adjacent islands

British Islands is the political term for the islands (excluding the Republic).

But clearly, by your definition, Iceland is part of North America, Malta, Africa and Cyprus, Asia. So it looks like we have to kick them out of the EU/EEA. Also, the Island of Ireland is geographically much closer to the UK than the rest of the EU, so realistically it should be part of the UK and not the EU after Brexit.

Mr Chairman,

It is imperative that we as a nation look outwards to new opportunities, and that we maintain our invaluable membership of this group.

It is imperative that we maintain this to promote our common values of freedom, democracy and most consequentially human rights, not only in the commonwealth, but across the globe.

I strongly believe we should look to create strong trading ties with our closest allies: Canada, Australia and New Zealand, to counterbalance trading giants, such as the United States, European Union and China, and that we look to expand this partnership to others as well. With these nations we share not only a common culture, language and history, but a common identity and people.

We ought to be considering our Commonwealth partners as our warmest and most welcoming friends in a possibly forbidding and frigid Post\-Brexit world, and as such must forge fabulously beneficial trade relationships with them as well.
Look on AQA.ORG.UK there are loads of practice.

Yeah, in books 1-6 students were only killed by hostile forces (like having terrorists barge into a school and blaming it on the teachers). In book 7, students were killed by a tyrannical government.

"Oh but students were also killed by teachers"

Ok...

1 - Quirell tries to kill Harry - literally has Hitler on the back of his head. Looks like they should have done some more back*head* checks.  
2 - Lockhart tries to kill the Students - but he's a mentally deranged narcissist. Then the armed students wipe his memory.  
3 - Lupin (tries to) kills students because he's a werewolf. That's like someone holding a gun, but killing someone with a chair and it being the guns fault.  
4 - Fake moody tries to murder harry - that's like inviting a terrorist into your school.  
5 - Umbridge - she's a powerhungry dictator (tyrranical govt)

It is, by any definition, like Ireland is part of "the British Isles". However, (the Republic of) Ireland is not a British Island, but Northern Ireland is (confusing)?

British Isles is a geographic term for any islands ownesby the UK or Ireland in NW Europe basically.

British Islands refers to any island owned by the UK (or for which it is responsible) (although I'm not sure if that has to be in NW Europe, I don't think so).

Fun fact: If it weren't for Gibraltar, the UK would be an entirely island country.

"Ms McGill then looked at how often men and women were proven right in these questions. When men‚Äôs competence was questioned, they were proven right 44 per cent of the time. Women were proven right 41 per cent of the time.

"So not only does this book set the example that it is OK to question women more often, it also tells you that women are more likely to be wrong than men," she said."

Well it's true. Currently women get disadvantaged because they're likely (especially women of a certain age) to have to take time off work. If you're an employer with two candidates, one of whom is a woman and the other a man, both newlyweds, it's likely that the woman will soon take off work to raise their child - whilst you have to get a temporary, doubling your costs. Furthermore, women might be disadvantaged in promoting because a higher temp. costs more. Because of this, it's likely that the man will have to still be the "breadwinner" of the family, so will be working hard to earn more money.

If we give men paternity leave, employers can't disadvantage women, because both are likely to need time off work.

It's up to Gibraltar whether it wants to join Schengen (and it could, see: Monaco), but they don't so as to not blind the border with Spain.

I don't think anyone was suggesting that Northern Ireland would have a passport border where "civilians" are checked. The Common Travel Area \(as well as the Schengen Area \(see Switzerland\)\) transcends the EU, after all. 

What is contentious is if we leave without a customs arrangement \(like the government wants to negotiate\), then the EU would force Ireland to check all goods coming into it \(and we'd likely do something similar, although we wouldn't be forced to, but if we did it would undermine our own customs system.

Some people have proposed a technology\-based solution, but it isn't entirely clear what that means\). Basically, all in all, This means people would no longer be able to take 600kg of cigarettes across the border, say if they wanted to, without checks.
Northern Ireland's exports to Great Britain make up ¬£14bn, their exports to the EU make up ¬£6 billion.
That'll never happen \- and it never should. Northern Ireland is an integral part of the \(future\) UK single market, just as much as Ireland is an integral part of the EU Single Market.

The article specifically said that:

>This "backstop" option has been ruled out by Theresa May and any deal creating a difference between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK is opposed by her DUP allies.

Hence, we won't be seeing that. It doesn't make any logical sense for a country to be split internally based on customs. It makes no sense that one manufacturer in one part of the UK wouldn't be able to sell as well as another.
They really want that to stay in the SM/CU.

> but we want to put up a hard border.

*Under no circumstances,* will there be a full hard border (passport checks) - not in a million years - between UK and RoI.

However, yes there may be a customs border, but it's not something we *want*. We want a technologically-based solution and May has explicitly said she is open to a customs arrangement. For both sides, without the agreement we'd like,  it's up to them what level of customs checks they wish to implement.

Yet, I imagine, even in situation in which there was a hard border going into the Republic and no reciprocal going into the UK, the media would still manage to blame it all on the UK.

A comprehensive FTA doesn't have to mean a hard border because Ireland is a unique international situation, where no-one, not Ireland nor the UK, except the EU seemingly, where no-one wants a hard border of any sort (at least nothing beyond the extent of the Norway border for an extreme).

We would commit to a Capital Cost investment reform nationwide to inspire international investment in Scottish Industries.

From the Conservative Manifesto:
> At the moment, British
businesses can only deduct 46.7% of their capital
investments - one of the worst rates in the
industrialised world. As part of our pro-growth
agenda, we would commit allowing businesses to
immediately deduct at least 75% of the cost of new
capital investments.

We would also promote Local Authority Business Powers which would allow councils to develop local industries and business more easily for a more focused economy.
> To help local authorities create strong local
economies, building on the retention of business
rates in 2012, by allowing councils to keep a higher
proportion of the business rates revenue that is
generated in their area. This will provide a strong
financial incentive for councils to promote
economic growth and investment in local business
startups. We will also review local governments tax
raising powers to ensure local residents are always
getting a fair deal for what there taxes pay for.

Semi-private all boys day school (Y4-Y13) (owned by the government but a selective fee pay school) (there is a similar all girls school with whom we share lessons at 6th form).

8:30-3:30 5 1 hour lessons (2-2-1), + Registration in the Afternoon, 55 mins for lunch and 20 for break.

At lunchtime Y7-11 aren't allowed out of school. School Canteen pretty good (~¬£3 for a meal, ¬£2.50 for a panini). At lunch, you can hang around in the playground, study/hmwk in the library. There's a grassy lawn infront of the building to play on in the summer .

We have 5 houses. Relitavely strong house culture. 2 EoY cups (Sports and Arts)

Quite a big campus, around 10-15 mins walk from one end to the other, but quite close to town centre, in multiple different buildings.

Terrible IT facilities (Windows 7 !!!), only 2 IT suites + Library. No Computer Science GCSE offered (only ICT) because there's only one (ancient) ICT teacher. No Wi-fi on campus for students (4G I guess) and the Edu. department block everything they can get their hands on (violations mean you get locked out of the internet until you restart the computer).

Great sports facilities (shared with the girls school). Proper lesiure centre with pool, sports hall, gym, gymnasium. 3 football pitch sized fields and an astro.

Teachers all quite good (bar a few, e.g. once someone played a bell sound 15 mins early and he let the whole class out).

Strict no phone and no eating outside the canteen policy.

OP

> Wah!  I don't want to pay money for a service! Everything should be free!
> organized crime and the mob?

Then it's *illegal* money and therefore *illegal* ownership. If you can provide substantial evidence that the money was illegal, the property can go to from whomever the illegal money was taken.

E.g. P1 steals $300,000 from P2 and buys a house. 3 generations later, P1.3 owns the house. Evidence is unearthed that P1.3 illegally owns the property, so it goes to P2.3. However, P2.3 doesn't exist, so it goes to P2.3's closer descendent.
If there is one customer (the tenant, W) and two competing suppliers (the landlords, LL1 and LL2).

LL1 offers an appartement for lets say 100e (where a W makes 200e after tax). In a monopolistic society, she could raise that to 200e without consequences.

However, someone else (LL2) sees that people are being exploited and uses his money to build a block of flats. He offers rent for 70e (against 100e) or he offers a nicer flat for 100e. In both cases, W would choose LL2. LL2 put in 1000e to get 70e extra income each month. He took a risk. The building could burn down, so he loses 1000e. 

In a society where LL2 doesn't get any money from building flats, there would be no incentive to undercut LL1 (in the case of socialism, the state), so living conditions never improve.
Restraining order against everyone?

Yeah they look similar. Welcome to the light side.

Do you have Gboard? You can search emoji using it (just search rose).
But why do they joke about themselves I don't get it.
Tulip? Did you mean this:üåπ?
I'd say EFTA until we can organise a FTA for a full brexit, meanwhile unraveling all we are going through.

EFTA allows us to make int'l deals (important to me), we could probably get some breaks on FoM (provided some reciprocal deals, I would support a US-CAN style situation where it's VISA free for tourism, business (incl. Finance, Truckers), but not for proper immigration (to protect from expansion the UK doesn't agree to (e.g. Ukraine or Turkey)).

The only conceivable issue is EU policy and trade. I don't entirely mind paying into the pot, but equivalent to our current net contribution only (and it is counted as foreign aid).
It's the EU's laws that would cause a hard border in NI. We have no obligation to set up physical checks in NI.
You'll still need the go-ahead from Westminster for a referendum, as it's outside the SP's rights to govern. A UDI wouldn't be recognized by the UK, hence no access to the UN/NATO, nor by our allies (see Spain), hence no access to the EU or even EFTA (see Faroe Islands). It would be difficult for an independent Scotland with only partial recognition.
You realise how much the UK has contributed net to the EU over the years? Surely they could use some of that money to cover the costs?

I support a clean break + FTA and we honour our commitments as a part of our foreign aid/investments budget, but we contribute our *own* money into projects we have agreed to help finance.
Oh my god, it was *not* David Cameron's fault! He called the referendum then adamantly supported Remain. It was people who voted leave's fault. It probably would've happened anyway under a Con-UKIP Coalition. 

Corbyn *was* and still *is* an adamant Eurosceptic. It was his policy *far* before even becoming Labour leader.
Our teachers gave us booklets with all the questions in.

Just ask your teacher if you can have a list of their questions. If not, there are some Gen. Conversation Question at the back of the book.
Darn it, your counter's broken.

We've clearly already conquered all the sea in a square around Europe. We're more efficient than the Germans and rule the waves better than the Mainlanders.
Yeah but not everyone can access a tertiary level (or even an advanced secondary level) education. There will always be standards for uni education.
He also never thought it could happen and just wanted to throw the question out the window.
As long as we can still make international trade deals, basically everyone would be up for it. There's no way we should be in an agreement where a foreign body is negotiating trade deals for us.

And Turkey still has border checks.
Increasing Corporation Tax would only drive away bisinezz.
Everyone is entitled to take advantage of a pension, not everyone is entitled to a university education.

Every child benefits from having their mother home for the first few months.
It'd be funnier if it said "Finds out trans people can be teacher."
I'm assuming AQA.

Well Northern Ireland is part of the UK, so as the UK's yellow (mostly London acid/knife attacks or Islamic bombings), NI must be yellow as well.
For ‚Ç¨25 as well.

Nah.
From your opinion, yes. From my opinion, it'd be worse for the economy than Brexit.
Yeah but Nigel Farage agreed that if Remain won, it won. He would accept the result and continue fighting for Brexit.
Plan questions for your chosen themes for the Gen. conv.

For 'Quest quilya sur la photo?' use PALMW (Person, Action, Location, Mood and Weather). E.G. Sur la photo, he peux voir un famille** de cinq personnes qui sont en traine de diner. Il y a chez eux et il semble qu'ils soient tr√®s heureux. Il fait beau.

Practice using the specimen paper preparing under timed conditions, write a sentence for each point then expand. After that, extend each of your answers with vocab from the book.

Remember that the photo card won't be your chosen theme and you will have to answer questions on another theme as well.
So should we assume that all non votes are always pro-status quo. So if you're in an ex-Tory seat that gets a 50/40 vote in favour of Labour with a 80% turnout, the Tories win that seat.
Yeah, if she's voted against, she resigns. Tbf, it's the best thing the Tories could do politically. JC couldn't win without the SNP or LDs. They'd be taking the reigns of a cart crashing into a wall.
Would you be happy if everyone payed into a pot, you paying the most, but some people get more drinks than you?

John McDonnell, who would be in charge of the economy, is a Marxist.
Yeah, but clearly socialists agree with his plans, so they have to be pretty socialist.
> Norway isn't in the CU, but *is* in the SM. Why are you tying them together?

If your in the CU proper, you have to be in the single market.

If we're in their Customs Union, we abide by their rules and their trade deals.
Union - we are in the EU Customs Union, not even Norway is. ECJ, SM.

Partnership - Work together to take into account both sides wwants and wishes. No ECJ, FTA/SM likely.

Agreement - Sides have separate customs systems but try to harmonize theirs.
If the rebate discontinues to apply, any funding discontinues as well.
The EU wouldn't want it either.
Gran Bretagna! Gran Bretagna! Want to see me set fire to documenti negotiate di Europea Unione?

Yes, *please*
Well, it would matter if say France legalised weed and Italy didn't
It's likely that nothing will change for the average person. They'll probably have to have customs checks for trucks though.
For the Irish, it's 100 times more important to have no border with the UK. It isn't like you can just walk across the Channel/what ever is between Ireland and France.

Tbf the (current) EU-UK border consists of giving your ID (or passport if your country doesn't have National ID) to a border card.
Just look at Romania or Bulgaria for that. I guess you could look at the UK for air/sea but not really for land (,you know there's a sea in the way).
> The peg to the franc did not last but, in 1912, the gourde was pegged to the¬†US dollar¬†at a value of 5 gourdes to the US dollar. Although this peg was abandoned in 1989 and the currency now floats, because of the old link, five gourdes is often referred to as a "Haitian dollar". Likewise, 5 centimes is a "Haitian penny". Indeed, in many places, prices are given not in gourdes, but rather in "Haitian dollars", which must be multiplied by five to convert to gourdes.
If you're interested, there was a film recently about the island during the occupation called Another Mother's Son.
They could hand it in at the start of the exam. It says on the regualtion to hand any "banned items" in to the invigilator. For us, one of our teachers holds a box at the door and you pick it up at the office after your exam.
They take it from a variety of sources (mock grades, general attainment, teacher recommendation, coursework, even homeworks/classworks maybe) I believe.
Furthermore, and this is **really** important.

If you're found breaking regulation (cheating, communication, phones, apple watches etc.), you get disqualified from the whole exam board.

So if you do all AQA, for example, and you bring a phone in and it's found (even if it's on silent, if someone else's goes off, they'll search you too), you won't get a single GCSE.
