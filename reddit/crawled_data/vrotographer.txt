Hey, what's that theme you're using?
Haha fun! I love the look of lighter inks in a bottle but for some reason I can't bring myself to actually buy one - I feel like it'll be unreadable. I wanna try [[Noodler's Georgia Peach]] and [[Noodler's Apache Sunset]].
Holy heck dude, and I thought my collection was big at ~20!
[Here's the Moonman!](https://imgur.com/0fmtziR) I'm really loving it. I thought I wouldn't like it very much when I bought it, but it was only like $9 so I figured why not. I inked it with Syo-ro and I love it! It's a great little pen. I was a total idiot at first and put all the ink into the cap, not the body, so there was a little ink rescue mission involved there, haha.
Oh, huh! That's really cool. What pens do you have, by the way?
Hey just FYI, instead of typing **#6**, try **\\\#6** to avoid turning it into a header. :)

*Also apparently I didn't look at the other comments when I wrote this, turns out /u/Agent_03 got here first haha
For someone who's not good at IDing pens, what *is* pictured? :)
Oh, well look at Mister Fancy Pants over here with his *two* rolls of film
I did that the first time, but the next time I unscrewed it I touched the clip, and the whole thing came apart again. Should I glue it by the screw-in pin on the top?
Interesting. Since I already have some silicone grease, should I just throw it out? 
Thanks! I was shooting on a manual lens so unfortunately I didn't have the option of DOF preview. I'll probably go out and shoot the same flower again stopped down just a tiny bit.
Alright, will do.
Yep it was sort of ridiculous.
Awesome to hear! I'll probably grab some when I get the camera then.
Do they keep their charge when not in use? I've seen Amazon reviews saying they're terrible at keeping a charge.
My old Pentax 50mm *f*/2. I use it almost exclusively anyway!
Please link if you find it again! I'd love to take a look.
I love these little guys! I have my first one coming from Taobao hopefully this Tuesday. How do you like it?
>Nothing is going to work if you're not going to put effort into engaging yourself.

Yeah, I guess so. Maybe I'll try it again.

>That's probably a skill problem more than an equipment problem. What's the issue?

Not to be obstinate, but I think it is more of an equipment problem. The RAW buffer on a Canon T5 is only 6 shots and then it gets super slow until it clears. Plus when I do astrophotography, it has minor banding problems and *lots* of noise. Plus the video capabilities are basically none. And I use old manual lenses without focus peaking, which is a much slower process than with. So I'm gonna sell it soon and hopefully buy a Sony A6000. 

But also, I'm just running out of things to shoot - or so it seems. I usually just take a walk in the neighborhood, but there's not a whole lot to shoot there, and driving isn't really an option currently.
Oh ok.
For the Nikon or the Pentax?
My only problem with selling the Pentax is that the lenses for the Nikon are *really* crappy. Slow, sticky, etc. Plus I use the Pentax lenses on my Canon and it'd be nice to keep the set together.
I have a nice 28 /2.8 and a 50 /2 for the Pentax. On the Nikon I have a sticky Tamron Adaptall 28-70 /3.5-4.5 and a foggy Sigma 80-200 /3.5-4.
:(
That's ok, I'm not planning to shoot 4K - 1080p is fine for me currently. How do you find the battery life? Someone else said the battery life was pretty awful.
Oh, okay. Makes sense.
Do you keep sensor swabs on you when you travel with it, or do you just use a blower? Also, how well does the sensor cleaning mode work?
Oh, good to know. So I should just let it go idle when not using it (obviously not when storing it)?
Yeah, at this point the A6000 is all I can afford. Guess I'll be switching it off and on all day lol
YES I've heard pretty bad stories about mirrorless battery life.

>Oh, by the way. The battery life on the a6000 sucks.

Oh

Time to sink another $50 into batteries :(
Yep, that'll be awesome! I'm super ready to switch to mirrorless. I'd die for that EVF. ^^You ^^really ^^are ^^a ^^very ^^helpful ^^cherry!
That's ok, I only have one on my T5 - the select button right in the center. Not a great place for a DOF-preview button IMO.
I tried Instagram awhile back but found it to be too high maintenance to keep a steady, engaged following. At this point, I'm shooting a little less as I'm more busy and saving up for a new camera - I'm a little frustrated with my current one.
That's good to hear. When I was using it at the store it felt super weird! I do like the infinite turning of the ring however.

Oh thank the Lord there's custom buttons. This thing is gonna be a HUGE step up from a Canon T5. I never really use autofocus on my T5 because of the crappy lenses I own and that my manuals are way better quality. I'll definitely be trying out AF, especially in video!
I got off social media awhile back so I'd like to use Flickr to show others my images (not to make money, just for others to look at). And I'd like to find others to appreciate their work and maybe even make some friends. :)
Huh. How do you suggest sharing your images and finding others? Just looking here on Reddit?
Oh, that really sucks. I always liked the idea of having an online place to share photos (besides Reddit haha), but it doesn't seem like there are any good ones right now.
Oh weird. That's good at least that the zoom ring turns into a focusing ring. Focus-by-wire is definitely a con in my book - I do a lot of manual focusing.
Now that Flickr has been acquired by SmugMug, I'm planning to use Flickr more. I don't really know which groups are good to join. I'd like some exposure, and I'd also like to see others' work too. No matter the genre, what are your favorite groups?
You see that one duck on the left that's cut off? If you cropped him out I think it'd help a lot.
I THINK IT SUPPORTS 4G BUT NOT CDMA. HOPE THIS HELPS
Alright, I'll do that then. Thanks for the help!
That's really cool!
I'm planning to buy some batteries for it soon. If it works at all, is it better than the Pentax? I think I messed up the focusing screen a little bit on the Nikon when cleaning it :(
Wow, did you do all the leather work yourself?
"Well I'm sorry, but I'm not Tony Stark."
Who's that floating lady?

Oh, haha rip me
Weird, I guess people are just butts sometimes. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
To login to the game or something else? I can't even log into WeChat because they banned me when trying to sign up.
Why do you need WeChat first?
It's downloaded, (not from the official site, I kept forgetting the link so I had to get it somewhere else), but after launching the game, it downloaded an update and it won't let me install the update.
Good to hear that the fins are strong. I don't have any rubber sheets (they're actually coming in a Taobao order in a week or so), so I'm planning on using some latex gloves. I hope they're grippy enough! Haha don't worry, I won't twist. :)

^*Edit* Welp I'm pretty sure it's impossible. I used a latex glove and kept pulling it for twenty minutes. I ended up breaking one of the fins a tiny bit. Can I try using something to poke it out from the other end, or is that a bad idea?
Yep, it's all cleaned out now. I'm gonna grab some latex gloves in a minute and try to pull it out.
Oh that's it? The worst part is that I can't even get the nib and feed *out.* I'm afraid if I pull harder than I have been, I'm gonna break the nib.
Oh, alright, thanks! Yep I was using Sync
That stinks. Mine is a Shimmering Sands and I really wanna use it, but this makes it impossible.

Does it leak all the time or only when your finger touches that lip? For me it's only when my finger touches it.
Oh that sucks :/
> The image you are requesting does not exist or is no longer available.
Dog
u ok bud
Yes that's what I'm looking for, thanks!
Ohhh makes sense. Thank you!
Unfortunately there's nothing like that on Android 
Thanks!
I'll probably get the 698 on another run, I can't afford it this time around. :(

But I'm really excited for all mine to come! I'll definitely look into the Jinhaos too.
I mean it doesn't have to be real leather specifically, just looking for something cheap to carry around a single pen in.

Also, what's the difference between "暗尖" and "明尖"?
Great to hear! I'll probably pick one up in my Taobao order. Is the Lambitou fine otherwise? They look nice, I might snag a few too if they work well (with wet inks).
!doublecheck

Lol apparently that didn't work. But the translation did. Thanks!
What? I have a 7X and it works almost flawlessly.
Oh, haha! Yeah I saw your other post and I was a little confused. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  

Nice pens though!
Does this mean I can have a gold nib on my Metro?

*Literally three seconds after I made this comment I see "May not ship to United States" lol
We're all held in suspense! ^I ^meant ^this ^in ^a ^nice ^way ^:)
Hey what are those pink inks near the top? I've been looking for a good pink ink.
A bunch of stuff, all from Taobao! 

* Moonman Wancai Mini
* Live In You pen in yellow
* Wing Sung 818, 616, 336
* Pen tuning supplies, rubber grips, syringes, silicone grease, etc.
* A Pilot Con-50
* A couple different brands of notebooks

I'm really excited!

What phone do you use?
I'll help you out with comment karma!
*Wow* this is awesome! Thanks for doing the theme! It really makes the sub more inviting and attractive.

The only thing I'm noticing is that there's no link to the rules in the sidebar, which would be nice. But other than that it's awesome!
One of us ^one ^of ^us ^^one ^^of ^^us ^^^one ^^^of ^^^us
No
Wow that's gorgeous. What's the yellow pen?
Sure :)
Where did you get them for three bucks? Taobao? (I'd look myself but I can't right now)
Guys what's going on with this thread
Absolutely do NOT get the 2gb one. I had it for three years and it was abysmal with anything more than three tabs open.
Not actually a game (sorry about that), but this app called PhotoPills has a ton of really helpful tools for photographers, and it's exactly $10, so the gift card is the perfect amount! Thanks for doing this giveaway! :)

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.photopills.android.photopills
Yeah a weekly sticky thread for this would be great!
Weird. My brother just installed it on his R13 and he said it was trash.
Oh okay :)
Wait how many gigs does Chrome OS itself take up? 
Huh, I might do the same. Thanks for telling me! I would've been really confused otherwise, haha.
Woowww that's weird.
Oh that's awesome!
Sounds awesome! Concerning your edit, that's wacky. I wonder why they made it that way.
Lol, that's fine, how's overall performance?
Sorry if I sound dumb, but what's the difference?
^I'm ^sorry ^I ^still ^don't ^get ^it
Ok am I the only one that's confused about the Canon thing
Just judging by looks, I like the last one the best. From my family's experience, Tudia is a solid brand.
That's really sad :(
COOL I CAN'T WAIT
Is the FE2 also a good one? Since it's more electronic then the FM2, will it not last as long?
Which films are still being made? Is Superia X-Tra still made?
Oh no I don't want that right now D:

^^But ^^I ^^actually ^^totally ^^do ^^:D
Huh, interesting. I'm thinking about getting a Preppy and eyedropping it.
Ok now I have five syringes lol
Heh I'll probably skip out on the sandpaper then. Do I need multiple syringes? I added 3 to my cart. And I added two of the rubber pieces.
Is nib tuning difficult? Judging from the fact that you use sandpaper, it sounds like it could be dangerous potentially haha

Woah, that syringe and rubber piece are gonna be priceless.
Oh no :(
Wait why is there no Safari?
Nice!
Holy heck! That's really cool. How long have you been painting?
Other than changing the white balance (I like the warm aesthetic) this is solid advice.
Oh yay :)

Also just realized how angry my first comment sounded, sorry /u/ClinchWork
I don't like it but you do and that's what matters :)
The problem is that I don't really have a sense of what looks good. I was gonna wear my olive green jacket with my Nikes but my older brother (who is way more into fashion than I am) said they would clash. Plus my wardrobe isn't very big at all haha
Awesome! Sounds just like what I'm looking for. I wonder if it's available somewhere near me ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Woooaaaaah that's what X-Tra looks like. I shot a bunch of it but haven't developed it yet. Awesome shot!
I don't even see that in dev options on Oreo, maybe it moved?
Alright, cool! I've actually been looking at buying a Kaweco or a Lamy, just not sure if I'd afford both rn lol
Where are you planning to sell them? If it's on eBay or something, would you mind PMing me a link? :)
No, I still have it. I never noticed it before I updated but now I see it in almost every app :(
This happened to my silver one too :(

[Now it's an extra body!](https://i.imgur.com/ePAfuMp.jpg)
I'm just speaking from experience ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Will do! I probably won't try it if it voids my warranty; I did this on my last phone and then I ended up finding a weird spot on the display, which would've been covered under warranty if I hadn't unlocked the bootloader. 
It's totally awesome! Great speed, awesome battery life (anywhere from 4.5 hrs to 6 depending on how you use it, I use a lot of navigation at max brightness), camera is great for the price, storage and RAM is good, etc. For $200 it's great!
No, not yet. I really want to soon, might try this weekend :)
Honor 7X is $200 in the US, and it'll get Oreo (with Treble) in April-June. I joined the Oreo beta, so I have Treble right now. Might not be your best option if you want Treble right now, but it's worth a look!
Lol exactly what I've done, besides actually getting the ROMs
Do you develop it yourself too?
No
Awesome! That's a pretty crazy process, I would've given up before ever thinking to use an old US SIM. Glad it worked!
Yep same
Hooray! :)
:(
Just did, super hoping it works!
Lol I still don't have it either
So excited! I'm really hoping I get it today.

*Edit: I got it! Woohoo!
Nothing here yet ._.
Nope I haven't gotten it either. I'm really hoping I get it by tomorrow.
The problem is it's been going on for several months at this point, growing slowly but steadily worse. Sometimes she pants too. But the weird thing is that it's kinda cold in my room, and I had the windows open all day. She likes Louis, and she's tolerated him for five years. But she's been on a seed diet her whole life and I'm afraid that she's just declining.
Thanks! Yeah, he's really cute. He's really hyper though! We stopped at our neighbors' on the walk and he was pulling and tugging to see their dog.
Nice!
Sure! You could even use your super spitting powers and run a window washing business.
Nice and functional!
I think of it more as Chaotic Neutral than Lawful Good.
How did the shoes turn out? I think I'd draw some sort of pattern on them, or maybe a bunch of things that I like: cameras, guitars, music notes, dogs, etc. We have a four-month-old labradoodle named [Murphy](https://i.imgur.com/LNuG8LK.jpg)! We got him on New Years day and we love him!
You can spit on people from over a mile away!

... That's it.
Nice! I wanna try doing something to white Converse.
Your superhero name is Pinkpaca!
Woah that's crazy! Do you have any pictures of it? It sounds really cool!
That's awesome! I really wanna get some white Converse and sharpie the heck out of them. It was really nice here today, we just went for a walk with our puppy.
I tried clicking on some of the cameras and most of the links were dead. I sent them an email about it and [here's their response](https://i.imgur.com/AfnOfvg.png).
Just something to improve ergonomics.
Has anyone here tried making their own custom camera grip? How did it turn out?
Interesting, and no blur. I *love* the depth that the image has, that 3D feeling.
Huh, I'll have to try that. Did you use a tripod?

I know one of my lenses (actually one I'm planning on getting rid of, haha) has some pretty significant vignette wide open.
Nice cat :)
Wow. What an awesome image! How did you get that nice vignette?
Heck yes
Yeah, I had the original Smart Lock on my Moto G4+ and I miss it :(
Oh weird. Mine has "Smart Unlock with Bluetooth device" but not anything location-based.
Not my Honor 7X, although I'm pretty sure it's an EMUI thing.
🌚
Yeah. I signed up for the beta, I expect "major bugs". They never said anything about an alpha before the beta.
Interesting. Why will the plus be supported longer than the pro? Do you know?
Dang it I haven't gotten it yet. Signed up the same way you did, been waiting for awhile.
I do like to tinker with Linux and stuff, but honestly I probably won't do a whole lot of it on a new $400-600 device. Besides much less Linux support, how do you like the plus?
Lol this is the first time a phone of mine will have ever gotten an update

But has anyone actually gotten it yet? I haven't.
Not sure, though I'm guessing it won't.
Dang it, there goes my wallet lol
Cool! It sounds like a really nice device. Thanks for the input!
Honestly sounds good for me. Plus the price difference is pretty significant
I don't have it here yet
Thanks!
Me too! Haha I posted on the 12th that I was excited for the beta "today", and then I found out that the 12th was the release for the EU beta. But I'm even more excited now!
Everything seems to be working! I haven't put a battery in it yet, but I'll probably do that over the next few days. I have one roll of Superia Xtra 400 left, so I'm really excited to use it!
Whee^ee^ee^ee^ee^ee!
Which phone do you have?
This is probably a little nitpicky of me, but I'd love if you guys used a theme like Naut (like /r/Android and other subs do).

Oh, and maybe add more links to the sidebar: XDA forums, maybe a link to that EMUI Themes Factory app, etc. 

It's a great little sub even right now, though! :)
Yeah I didn't get it yesterday. Turns out March 12 was for the EU beta 🤦‍♂️
That's really cool! I was given an old Minolta telephoto awhile back, but that's it for me. Haha I'm still trying to sell it, because it doesn't fit on any of my cameras. 

I think that'd be so fun to have a job working with cameras/imaging! That film looks nice, thanks for the recommendation. :)
Even if it doesn't, it still looks super awesome. I can't use them yet (film is too expensive for me currently), but I've gotten [two old SLRs](https://i.imgur.com/jkQP3oo.jpg) in the past year. I just use them as decorations right now :)
Congrats! I'm sure it's awesome. Does it work?
:(
Yeah, I hadn't thought of it that way. I love fixing them up too! On my FE2 and my K1000, I always wipe them down and rub off the lens mounts with rubbing alcohol. Then I make sure everything works. It's super fun!
Sounds like your phone is a bit of a defect. I have a screen protector on and I've had no trouble with random touches. I'd recommend contacting Huawei/Honor customer service about it.

/u/monster4210 
Yeah! It came with a dirty Tamron 28-70 3.5 and an 80-210 (I think), a crappy Vivitar flash that the guy bought after his old one died, a macro filter, two skylight filters (no idea what they do), and a UV filter that's loose and dirty. ^^I ^^also ^^bought ^^a ^^Coca ^^Cola ^^watch ^^from ^^the ^^guy ^^but ^^that's ^^unrelated ^^lol

What's really irritating is that no matter how much can air I use on the mirror and focus screen, it doesn't seem to come off all the way. [Here's a photo.](https://imgur.com/0Sh51YJ) Got any ideas? :)
Haha thanks! I'd been searching "film" and "old camera" on Letgo for a week or so, when it popped up for $5. It's not in the greatest cosmetic condition, but everything seems to work perfectly! I've never gotten lucky like this before.
Haha I think I accidentally picked up an Adaptall lens yesterday with my Nikon FE2
I really want a Canon AE-1. It's pretty much my grail camera. I picked up a [Nikon FE2](https://imgur.com/a/K2iXg) yesterday though, and I love it!
Huh interesting, I'll have to try it!
Haha, goes to show how much I know. Where would you get chemicals? I can't seem to find anything.
Jeez I probably have to Google a lot more than I have at this point.
There isn't anything nearby currently in my area. Are there any places (Amazon, eBay, AliExpress, etc.) that carry them? Is it a good idea to purchase from them?

Haha I have four rolls of Fuji Superia Xtra, when I probably should've gone black and white. I was never planning to get them developed (I would've done it myself in the far future), but I guess I have to, I'm not gonna go through the hassle of developing C-41 film lol
[Seems to be!](https://imgur.com/a/Intte) Although in the fourth picture, it won't let me join any betas currently, it says that my "phone cannot currently participate in any projects." But I signed up via the Google Forms link, so I don't know about that.
I forgot I own the manual too ._.

Thanks for that, haha!
You did it!! Haha I had disabled the app when I'd gotten the phone. I opened it up and signed in, and now the beta works! Thanks a ton!
Does that [LAB-BOX](http://www.lab-box.it/) Kickstarter from Feb 2017 look good as a darkroom alternative? I really want to start shooting film, but it looks expensive to get film developed externally all the time and I don't have the space/money for a darkroom.
I bought a Nikon FE2 yesterday. It's all cleaned up, everything seems to be working. I opened the focusing screen frame yesterday, but I tried to do it again today and it won't come down. Am I supposed to push on the tiny little lever, or pull? Either way I try, it won't come down. There's a lot of dust in it. :(
I haven't personally confirmed, but a lot of people in the EMUI 8 Discord have said they've talked to Honor customer support and they've said that the OTA will be pushed March 12. 

How did you sign into the app? I hit "agree" but it said that Huawei Mobile Services had been disabled. It downloaded HMS, I installed it, and I still got the same error message, even after a restart.
Lol I've been doing [this](https://i.imgur.com/wTCqQFI.png) all day
Heck yeah! It's a must-play with me and my brother all the time. Have fun!
Its called [Drive Ahead!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dodreams.driveahead)

Basically it's you and an opponent, and you have to hit his head with your car. If your head gets hit, you lose. It's really fun!

Weird. It's pretty mild in our house (usually 66-68°f) and she doesn't come out of the cage too much because she's not tame.
Okay, that's reassuring. Sometimes if I open my window (even if it's 34° outside like it is now), she seems to get better. We keep our house at 68° tough, and it's fine for our other budgie. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Don't worry, you're not being rude :)

I was a lot littler when I got the birds, and they were a gift from my parents, so I didn't really know that I'd need to have a bird vet nearby. I definitely know that now though.
Alright, thanks

And what's VSC?
If I slow down, my hand gets really shaky and my letters look like I'm about seven.
How should I take the clip off? Do I just pull, and it clicks back in? Haha I forgot to tape off the plastic band at first and there's a few scratches on it now. 

Did the Italix come with that marbley look to it, or is that a result of the sanding?
What does the coating do? Is it a finish?

[I'm sanding my Metro!](https://i.imgur.com/ngYzqrm.jpg)
Looks like an awesome pen! I love brass. I'm thinking about sanding one of my old Pilot Metros down to raw brass.
Wow, that's really really cool! How did you sand around the clip? Did you take the clip out somehow? I have 3 Metros and one of them has a broken nib, so maybe I could sand one down and use it as an extra body.
Wow. That's really cool! Might have to try and copy that (though it'll look crappy lol)
Yep, I got it in a Goulet sample and was amazed by the sheen, but disappointed by pretty much every single other factor. 4/10 would not recommend as a daily ink :(

*What* thank you, you've made my day. I just downloaded street view earlier but I hadn't opened yet so I didn't know that was even a thing. Thanks so much!
YES! In all honesty I'm okay without HDR+ (although I don't really know what I'm missing as I've never used it before). But I really miss being able to make photo spheres. Can't find any apps to do that, and my phone doesn't have a Snapdragon processor.
Alright, about that Nitrogen: (Sorry it took so long for me to respond!)

* It's definitely a shiny ink. It's a nice dark cyan that sheens magenta-ish-red.
* It's also definitely a wet ink. My hands are slightly moist, and it smears a crap ton. But I'm left-handed so that probably contributes.
* It seems to behave okay on crappy paper, there's basically no sheen though. If you want the sheen, you'll have to use Rhodia or Tomoe River or something.

Because of the smearing problem (and my left-handedness), I probably wouldn't buy a bottle of this ink *for everyday writing.* For drawing or art projects, definitely! But I might try [[Organic Studios Walden Pond Blue]] - sounds like basically the same ink, just less smeary.
About four or five days, as expected since I just used the free shipping.
Yep, it's what I did.
Oh I see, thanks for clarifying.
Thanks for catching it :)
Oh no! My Reddit app kept saying "failed to submit comment" and I kept clicking "retry" until it went through. Sorry about that!

I don't know if you are in the US, but of you are, just beware that you only get 3gb of RAM and 32gb of storage. I got the US model, and coming from 4gb of RAM on my G⁴ Plus, it's still works great.
Welcome, we're glad to have you! My old phone was a Moto G⁴ Plus. Crappy processor, constantly overheating, terrible battery life, and all-around choppiness. So so so glad that I switched to this phone!
It's been amazing so far! I'm coming from Moto G4 Plus that would get maximum 3¾ hours SoT everyday, and I got 5h 32m today without charging.

WOW! That's a lot of snow. I always used to wonder why adults hated snow when I was little, but now I'm starting to drive more, so I guess I understand now. 
Oh, that really sucks dude. I don't have to drive my own car yet so I guess I just don't think about things like that 
... maybe
Yeah, there are a ton of closings in my area. 

Haha it's kinda funny how we're all talking about getting snowed in and we have no idea if we live in the same area
Me too! Im so excited to go out with our new little puppy, [Murphy](https://i.imgur.com/nIM7VCn.jpg), and play in the snow together. Every time it snows he loves to romp around and play. 
:(
I never thought to check Marshalls! I'd go out tonight and look but we're gonna be snowed in :(
Cool, I'll look into it!
Oh yeah, that's a good idea!
Good bot. 
Yeah, I might try that first. Do you think the paper would be good enough for a fountain pen?
op where is our update
Wow, looks really cool! I wouldn't have thought it'd get that many scratches in a week, but I honestly like that look.
Awesome, thanks for your help! Pretty sure it's going on my birthday wish list now :)
Awesome to hear! So a leather waterproofing spray probably isn't necessary then? How long have you had yours, and do you mind sharing a picture?
I have a few Pilot Metropolitans. A black one with a medium nib was my first one, and I still use it as my daily driver. It's about $12 currently on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Collection-Fountain-91107/dp/B009X9Z2FW/ref=sr_1_5?s=office-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1518030661&sr=1-5&keywords=pilot+metropolitan&pldnSite=1), so if I were you, I'd start with that. 

^^Ninja ^^edit also be aware that fountain pens are different from dip pens (I assume that's what you meant by drip pen? :) ). Fountain pens can be used for art projects, but they're mainly for writing. And also DON'T PUSH ON THE NIB unless you're sure it's a flex nib! Pens like the Noodler's Konrad or Noodler's Ahab are flex nibs, so you can push on them to get a thicker line. (Sorry if that was a little confusing!)
^^
Good luck!
He didn't even get the ball in the hole :(
Sorta unrelated but happy cake day!
Great to hear! I'm so excited! :)
Congrats! I have a Metro and I love it, it's my daily driver currently. My favorite thing is the weight of the pen, it feels so natural. 
Haha I just bought a Shimmering Seas sample (with 4 others) and an x750 from Goulet! Yeah, I'd totally be interested in seeing the new inks! 
Congrats! I just made my first order today. Five ink samples, Tomorrow River and a Jinhao x750. I was reading about their shipping process and I'm glad to see that they ship things carefully!
F
Wow, that's quite the collection! 

If you want to, Google how much they're worth (maybe ask for IDs on pens here?), pick a few to keep, and sell/give the rest away. If you have friends that do a fair amount of writing, I'm sure they'd appreciate a new pen!
Most of the changes are cosmetic. Status bar looks a little different, [the settings app](https://i.imgur.com/WmOcghe.png) looks more like iOS than stock Android's does, etc. I think the main difference for me is the [notification center](https://i.imgur.com/mfhdyYW.png), which behaves a little bit differently from stock Android. 

And the EMUI default launcher is garbage imo. I use Nova launcher, so I don't have to deal with it. 

But EMUI does add some useful features, like [scrolling screenshots](https://i.imgur.com/P9pCJwY.jpg).

EMUI took a little getting used to coming from Stock 7.1.2, but I'm used to it now and honestly, after a little tweaking, I prefer it!
I have Nova on it, the skin affects more than that. 
YES the ink variety is getting to me. Goulet Pens (fountain pen/ink/notebook seller) is having a 20% off sale tomorrow on ink samples and I'm getting like 12 :(
It's like a storm trooper pen! 
Great phone for the price. Only things I wish I had are 5ghz wifi support and NFC but otherwise it's awesome! The only thing you have to get used to is the skin on Android. Not a big deal to me (it used to be though), and after a few weeks of owning it I'm used to it.
Dang it, now I have to buy a matte black VP *and* a white one. The Ahab looks interesting, but I'm a leftie, so I don't know how flex nibs would work out for me. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
YES matte black. How do you like the VP? a matte black one with a fine nib is my grail pen <3

Why did I ask for suggestions, I'm already buying like 12 ink samples, I'm gonna be broke lol
I fall for matte black everything.

Well now I guess with Goulet's 20% off ink samples tomorrow, I'm gonna be buying like 12 ink samples, and one will be Earl Grey!

Haha I didn't even read to the end of your comment before writing my reply, and then I see

>Speaking of, I got an email about Goulet having a sale tomorrow on samples! So it might be something to keep an eye out for.

So yeah, I'm gonna be getting some ink from that. 😂

I'm also finally pulling the trigger on an x750 and Tomoe River paper! So excited!
Ooh a VP! It's definitely out of my price range, but I want a matte black one. 

Isn't Earl Grey something /r/FountainPens actually helped create? It looks like a cool ink!

Shimmering inks have always intimidated me. Do you have any experience with them? I've heard that they tend to not start as readily and that kind of scares me off, haha
Yeah, I've always favored Pilot more too. 
Nice pick! I'm using the Metro right now and I love it. What made you pick the Metro specifically?
Not sure if it's related but it seems the landfill south of Rockford is burning a lot right now. Getting a lot of crappy smells here.

>Do you the way
I open from the "bottom" (aka where the stem isn't), so I'm doing it right? And what's the benefit?
So which ever should you peel from?
1. No NFC/wireless charging, although that's sort of to be expected at this price range. 
2. No 5ghz wifi support. Family recently put in a new modem to take advantage of the speed were paying for but I can only get 20mbps instead of 100mbps. 
3. My experience with screen protectors has been awful. The one I currently have (which apparently isn't sold on Amazon anymore) has a terrible halo effect.
You're welcome!
It's actually not an audio output, it's for a remote. You can plug in a remote shutter and take shots with that instead, which is especially useful for star photos.
Mine does this too, I'd love to know the answer. It used to grab the thumbnail :(
Thanks for the encouragement! I'm in a more rural area so there aren't a whole lot, but I have yet to explore most of them. I'm super excited to this summer!
It's a little ~~puppy~~ pulpy, not moldy yet. I'll probably trash it then.

Haha, I was kinda discouraged by that other guy. I was really hoping the test of this sub wouldn't be like that, I want to contribute here :)
Okay. Should I get rid of *all* the paper and add some new paper then?
Sorry, pretty new to this thing and thought I was helping. The cache owner hasn't done anything with it since they left it in 2016. What does NM stand for? And should I remove my new paper?
No.
This might be the cutest thing I've seen on this sub. Does he just like to jump like that?
I just took the cover off for the shot, and I didn't wanna steal the old paper :(

What's the update status of the 7X?
You're welcome! :)
Not sure about folders, but I can help with the status bar. 

1. Head to Nova settings by talking and holding on an empty area of the screen. 
2. Tap on the "Look and feel" tab. 
3. Scroll down until you see a switch called "Dark icons", and turn it off.

Hooray!
Thanks for the music recommendations! My brother really loves My Chemical Romance. 

Right now it's kind of a weird purple here. 

I like that quote!
Hooray cake day buddies!
Ok /u/RamsesThePigeon
Yeah, that was a problem with our last dog, Casey. 
Yeah, my family specifically didn't want a shedding dog (like my last one) so we got a labradoodle.
Thanks! It took a lot of convincing for my little brother but we finally settled on it. He's a labradoodle
Haha my cousins have a spoiled dog, and she's faaat. Murphy is supposed to be around 60 pounds all grown up, so we'll have a big boi
Ty yours too :)

He's grown so much since when we got him on the 1^st . He was 12 pounds on the 3^rd and now he's like 21!
YES <3

Here's my 11-week-old [Murphy](https://i.imgur.com/tNv381L.jpg)
Eesh, sounds bad

Pls send pics of the pups if you can I need this in my life

We are all sweet thoughts on this blessed day ^^did ^^I ^^do ^^the ^^meme ^^right
Alright, I'll check it out!

How big is the fire? Is it like a forest fire? Hope you stay safe <3
Yes don't interrupt my online cake comsumimg
Thanks! 

Is that still the California wildfires? I have no idea if those are over or not (I don't follow the news that closely at all). I looked up Coldplay's most recent. Is it Kaleidoscope or A Head Full Of Dreams? And I love the quote!
(Late) congrats to you to! I'll have to listen to that album. I'm getting a lot of recommendations and I think I'm gonna make a list of all the albums suggested. It's 6pm for me, and it's dark here too. We just had a mini thunderstorm, and we're supposed to get rain for another few hours! We haven't had rain here in months (although it's January so makes sense). I like the quotes!
I second the ants.
Thanks! I'm gonna journal tonight, I guess that'll be my celebration.
Hey, we share a cake day! ^^Idk ^^basically ^^anything ^^about ^^sneakers ^^that's ^^all ^^I ^^had ^^to ^^say
Thanks! I'll have to check out those albums too. The sun is almost set by me, and we've had weird brown/grey/sunny skies here for the last hour. I think it's about to rain. Also, it's like 40°, practically a heatwave!
>A few we thought of: sports, gaming, movies and shows (tv?), pets and animals, books and reading, music, thoughts and ideas (meta?), advice and questions, anecdote

I think a writing category would be awesome.

> What do you want more or less of?

I definitely want a lot less romance-related posts, plus things like job searches and "got my license" posts, things like that. They're all good things, I just feel like there's so many of them that it could be put in a megathread, and if someone posts one romance-related, they could be sent a PM by AutoModerator reminding them that there's a megathread for it.
Nice! I'm about halfway through mine, started it in January 2015. (I'm a slow journaler lol)
That's so awesome! How long did it take to complete? And what pens are those in the back? I think I recognize a Kaweco Sport and a Jinhao... x750?
Thanks a ton!!
Oh sorry! I forgot to specify vertical 18:9. And if Yoshi could be like 1.5x bigger that'd be great :)
Woah, I didn't know they were interchangeable with Pilot nibs!
Yeah, that's the thing. I can't afford a new one currently but I really wanna make this one work again. I guess I'll be trying the pliers thing, thanks for the idea!
Thanks!
Nice! I really love matte black.
Haha, this is the *exact* one I've been looking on Amazon at! Well now I know what the interior looks like. Thanks a lot!
Wow, that's really cool! Which one of those has that matte black nib?
Dude, this is awesome! Where do you find pen cases? All I can find is super expensive leather knees. I just need a boxy one that can hold like ten pens. This one would work great.
I dropped my silver Metropolitan two years ago, and I kind of just left it to sit there until recently. I've tried timing with it over the past two years, but nothing seems to get it back to its original glory. It seems like one of the tines is slightly dented. Is there any way to fix that, Or will I just have to live with a scratchy pen? ^^Also ^^sorry ^^for ^^the ^^terrible ^^photos
Well guess we'll just have to unleash some *upvote* bots on them then!
Okay I'm super confused here. Why is this being downvoted?
How's the rhodia paper? I'm thinking about getting a couple mini ones for travel.
Awesome! I've been looking for them and it seems like there's a couple different 4 packs. Which one did you buy?
Woah. I gotta check that out!
Jeez, might as well get all the other x750 colors too
So all of my worst contributions to this site, basically

No idea but I see them everywhere now.
Nope, I had dropped it (the pen itself was fine) and I just never cleaned up the ink splatters.
Haven't tried it yet, but I downloaded it. Not quite what I'm looking for but it looks cool!
No, although that game is really fun. The one I'm thinking of had retro music and [this aesthetic](https://imgur.com/a/cYwOt), but more purpley.
Linkme: Shadowverse, Hearthstone, Crashlands, Mobius Final Fantasy, Antihero
I think I have two in each slot, and there's slots  total.
So far I'm just using Pilot Namiki black cartridges, but I'd really like to put a converter in it and use Diamine Eclipse.

They're so cute! :)
Thanks! So am I :D
You're welcome! It's really cool. What always boggles my mind is how artists like you choose a color palette to work with. They're totally not NASA colors but they work really well together! 

Don't worry, I'll be sending pics! I'm super excited to see how it looks. I had to stay home from school today because I'm sick, but at least I'll get to pick up my phone right away :)
Yep! I'm super excited to try it out tomorrow afternoon :)

[Here's a picture of it on my current phone](https://i.imgur.com/0NJ5pYI.png), I'll send a pic of it tomorrow afternoon on my new phone. Thanks so much, I really love it!
*DUDE.* You're the bomb. My phone's arriving tomorrow afternoon and I'm so excited to put this as the wallpaper! Thanks a million!
How any months of gold do you have at this point?
Woah I didn't know you could do that 
. Cool!
Oh I didn't even know ikea was a meme lol

I just kinda wanna get them as summer beaters, no idea what they would go with though
Oh :(
... I kinda want them ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I reposted ^^^I'm ^^^sorry this a few months ago and everyone got mad at me :(
Nope, no aliwangwang.
Not sure yet, hasn't arrived haha. I'm super excited for Thursday/Friday when it arrives though! Hopefully it'll be an upgrade from my crazy slow Moto G⁴ Plus. I'm really looking forward to the 2:1 screen ratio too!
Hey, it's you again! Haha seeing those Wing Sungs is gonna make me wanna buy a bunch of different colors :P
My laptop can't open the window to message the seller. Thanks, stupid Chromebook :(

The main reason I want to use a seller is because it'll just be easier for me. I'm not super comfortable buying direct, so maybe this is a good option. Plus they send quality control pics and your stuff will all send in on box. 

Thank you for all your help and time though!
Wow, that's pretty sucky, haha! Maybe buying *directly* on my first try wasn't such a great idea. I ended up canceling all my orders and adding them to my cart in Superbuy. Do you think it'll be easier to purchase the stuff through an agent?
So that means that where it says "(____ pieces ~~availabe~~ available)" next to the quantity selector means nothing? ^Ninja ^edit And even though it says every item is in the "Pending payment" page, that doesn't mean that they're actually in stock?

Also, would you mind translating something for me real quick? :)

I'm getting ready to pay for my stuff now and I get "交易付款或账户信息更改时需输入（不能与淘宝或支付宝登录密码相同）". According to what I understand from GTranslate, it's asking me to put in a password. Is this what my AliPay password will be?
:(
Thanks so much for your help! I'll be selecting the first option. Yeah Chrome isn't that great with translating the site but I get by most of the time. 

Yep, I'm planning to send them to the global warehouse.
I assume these camera ports don't work on an Honor 7x? 
Looks like a crazy deal. Besides things like sub-par camera and lack of NFC and quick/wireless charging, what are its main downsides?
Oh no
Always great to see some idiot from my hometown.
Alright, thank you! Yep, it's a Chinese site, so that would explain it I guess.

I don't remember being subbed but this is amazing.
I'm gonna try to explore more on my bike, take more photos, and get a job!

And really sorry to hear about your breakup, I hope you're doing well.
I got a PS2 for Christmas. Guess I know which games I need to get now ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
I was smiling! Guess I'll be doing a lot of that :)
Yeah! He gave me custom text for my eclipse flair :) ^^^/u/tizorres
YES I loved that one!
My main resolution for 2018 is just exploring more. On my bike, in the car, whatever. I just want to get out more.

Plus, I could bring my camera with me and go take photos!
I started in a crappy composition notebook before I moved to a Moleskine in January 2015. Since then [I've only gotten about halfway through it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Journaling/comments/7mywn0/after_two_years_im_finally_more_than_halfway/), but I'm planning to buy a LT1917 and stick with those. I like continuity but I haven't found something that I really want to stick to for years to come, so I'm hoping LT1917 will deliver.
**1)** I tried electronic journaling at one point to see if I liked it over writing. For me, writing is better in every way, hands down. The main thing I like about it is that it really helps me slow down. Plus, there's an element of freedom that I like about paper and pen: I can do whatever I want to that piece of paper and I'm not restricted to just letters and numbers. And writing my entries out on paper really helps me slow down and think about what I'm writing. I write with a pen, so once something's down on paper, there's not really any going back.

**2)** I write a few different things: What happened today, how I'm feeling, goals for the future, what I've been thinking about, etc. Right now I'm especially focused on reviewing this past year. I try to stay away from shopping lists and calendar-type stuff; I save that for my phone (although I'm gonna order a Bullet Journal soon!) I also don't do a whole lot of drawing in mine. I don't know why, I just don't do it.
Awesome! I have three: one with a bent nib that I never totally fixed, a stub nib (doesn't really work for me cause I'm left-handed) and a normal M nib (a replacement for the bent one). They're really great little pens!
Awesome! How are you liking the Metropolitan?
I use a PS4 controller. Wireless, comfy, does everything I need it to for SDV. Is there anything I'm missing by using it over a keyboard and mouse?
What's the quest glitch?
That's really cool! I'm gonna buy an official bujo too. It kinda sucks that it's not gonna be here on January 1^st though, but I'll be fine ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Thanks!
Yeah, I think I might! I'm probably gonna shovel my grandparents' driveway soon so I'll probably buy another LT1917 and start fresh. 

Also your handwriting is awesome!
Thanks! I needed the inspiration. :)
Wuh oh
I learned that my Moleskine actually *doesn't* have very nice paper, and I'm going to buy a LT1917 for 2018.

I learned that I can't really write with a stub nib (left handed and I overwrite).

I learned that when purchasing just a few pens and accessories, the price can really add up!
I probably write in it a few times a week, but how many pages I write per entry varies a lot. In October and November combined, I write two pages. This month I've written twenty-two!
Thanks!
I have a Pilot Metropolitan that I've been using for about a year now. When I was journaling tonight I noticed that the left tine is just *sliiiightly* above the right one. How hard is this to fix? I have no pen tuning supplies currently.
Latching onto this comment. How about ones in northern Illinois, but not necessarily Chicagoland?
YES. I'm so freaking sick of "Oh it'll be fine hon". No it won't. I just messed up. Now my book is tainted with a mistake.

I'll have to try the watercolor tip when I pick up another journal! That sounds like a really good idea. Have you tried it?

My only problem with knockoff notebooks is the paper quality. I need like 70gsm or higher. (I know, I'm picky!)

And I never thought about using an old notebook for layout ideas! I'm totally gonna try that.

Would you mind sharing a couple pics of your favorite pages?
I've never really been a physical planner person before I discovered bullet journaling. It looks really attractive but I don't have a notebook with fountain pen-friendly paper yet, so it's on the shelf for now. I tried with an old Moleskine and it was terrible. I was trying *waaay* too hard to be artsy fartsy like I'd seen all over Instagram and Pinterest.

I think I tried the Ryder Carrol method and then I kind of abandoned/tweaked it to do my own thing. 

I really wanna try it again but I can't afford another good notebook right now :(

I just want to use it as a daily planner and calendar, along with maybe something like a gratitude log. I want it simple and clean, only black ink, nothing like the mess I had before. Don't get me wrong, I really liked the way it looked. It was just too high-maintenance and I was crazy inconsistent. And there's something really attractive to me about something simple and clean, not cluttered and artsy.

I think it'd take effort but I could definitely make it work if I just stayed consistent. 

How long have you been bullet journaling?
I have a couple spots in my journal where I doodled, but I don't like how they look so I stopped doing that in here. 

How do you like your bullet journal? Did you ever use apps and then you switched over? What do you do if you make a mistake or accidentally skip a day? I want to try it again but don't really know if it's right for me.
Glad you like it! I used to be really inconsistent - I'd go a month sometimes before writing again, and the entries were super short. Whatever that was when I was like eleven. But this month I've really started to journal more. I have 22 pages from this month, my most ever!

My style used to just be the date. Sometimes all caps, sometimes the month was abbreviated, sometimes I forgot to put the year, etc. Now I'm a lot more consistent with it because it's just reflex at this point to write that every time I sit at my journal.

Which pen do you like to use? I like my black Pilot Metropolitan fountain pen. I'm planning on ordering two more fountain pens after New Year's. 
Yeah! It seems like so many people fill up a notebook in a few months. But they use it as a shopping list, sketchbook, etc. I just use it as a "diary" (goodness I hate that word).
Good to know! Maybe when Goulet's website gets its crap together I'll be able to actually place my order :(
Ooh, is that the shimmering sands Jinhao? I just bought one an hour ago!
I started a journal on January 3^rd (5^th ?), 2015, to just document how I've been feeling and what's been going on. I don't have the greatest memory so it kinda helps with remembering, although that wasn't my intended purpose.

It's great that you want to start journaling! Everything you said sounds great. My piece of advice is: When you want to start a new entry, stick to something simpler for your header (date, location, weather, etc.) and get more complex if you want to. I tried that awhile ago and it made me dread starting a new entry because I felt obliged to keep up a really artsy standard in every entry.

I date every entry like this:

>Month day, year - location

I hope you like journaling; it's really fun and relaxing!
This is a great post! I always appreciate what you write here. Haha one time I thought you were a mod and I had to go check the list :P

I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it this year - I still have like 140 pages to go in my current one lol. Maybe next year though!
Idk about him but we can be friends if you want!
Wait is this in Rockford Illinois??
I spend most of my time with my fountain pens journaling because I don't really have any other paper that works well for fountain pens.

I do all the same things, except for game notes and campaign planning. Do you play DnD? 
Awesome! I never really thought about using a broad stub with it. My only hopes are that it's easy to clean and has a subtle color to it.
Haha I'm shopping too! I'm thinking about treating myself to a Jinhao x750 for my EDC and a Platinum Carbon as my journaling / desk pen. I'm also buying a sample of [[Diamine Eclipse]] based on [another redditor's request](https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/7mj9r2/favorite_darkdarkgrey_inks/drv3t3d/?context=3).

I'm also *finally* getting away from Moleskine and buying an LT1917 (black, blank, A5) as a new journal after I finish up my Moleskine.

I'm definitely gonna say **yes** to the Metros! I have three (one broke, one is a replacement, one is a stub nib) and they all work great (... except for the broken one lol). I'd also like to make it a fountain pen in my pocket, but I don't really wanna splurge for a Kaweco Sport yet (although it looks awesome!) so I'm gonna buy the Jinhao. Although I'm sure others will testify for the Kaweco!
Right now I'm sticking to my trusty black Pilot Metropolitan M with black ink cartridges, but I'm thinking about buying a Jinhao x750 and a Platinum Carbon, both with converters. 

I'm also gonna try a new ink, [[Diamine Eclipse]], based on /u/bit0114's recommendation. If I like the ink sample, I'll buy a bottle.

I'm finally starting to move away from Moleskine and I'm getting my first LT1917 (black, blank, A5) as a new journal after I finish up my Moleskine.

I'm super excited for the new year!
Yes yes yes, welcome!
Nice! So far I've only bought three Metros (one broke so I had to get a new one, and the third one is a stub nib), but I'm considering buying a Jinhao x750 and a Platinum Carbon. What do you like to write about / draw with the pens?
Sorry if I'm not understanding, but do you want an [ink converter](https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-CON-40-Fountain-Pen-Converter/pd/16562?gclid=Cj0KCQiAyZLSBRDpARIsAH66VQKfj-v9WWV_6gKY1S4LxHvYyJUKc_th59fYt5uGEdxcjPeXj8rzb-IaAso6EALw_wcB)? An ink converter is basically an empty cartridge that holds any ink you put in it. They make specific ones for specific pens, and I think the [Con-40](https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-CON-40-Fountain-Pen-Converter/pd/16562?gclid=Cj0KCQiAyZLSBRDpARIsAH66VQKfj-v9WWV_6gKY1S4LxHvYyJUKc_th59fYt5uGEdxcjPeXj8rzb-IaAso6EALw_wcB) works in the Pilot Metropolitan.

Hope this helps! :)
I think he meant make them yourself ;)
Alright, thanks for the heads-up!
Great to know that it's a comfy pen. I journal a lot with my Pilot Metro and I can get cramps (I'm a lefty) after writing for long periods of time. Also the fact that it's consistent is awesome!
Alright, thanks! Since the feed channel is deeper, does that mean it's a wetter writer with a normal ink than a Pilot Metro, for example?
Awesome, I'll get a sample. Thanks for the recommendation!
Woah yes please

So it doesn't make your Jinhao skip at all, and it doesn't feather a ton? What paper are you using? It looks like it's fountain pen-friendly in the pic.

I gotta get a sample of this stuff.
YES this is it. How does it behave, and what pen do you use to write with it?
Wuh oh, looks like a bunch of the images have been deleted. Do you have a mirror?
Oh haha, then happy (merry??) Boxing Day!
Awesome, thanks for the tip! Merry Christmas!
Alright, thanks for the answer. Sorry if that was a stupid question! It was late last night and I wasn't finding anything by Googling it. 

Merry Christmas!
Oh that makes more sense. I only use mine to write down what happened during the day, my feelings, my thoughts, etc. I just use my phone for everything else, but I want to try bullet journaling again. Haha I guess that explains why I've only been through a half a journal so far!
Thanks so much for launching and keeping it going! It's really been awesome to get new security updates and stay on the latest version of Android. 

Merry Christmas. 😊

Seeing people with like 20 journals after a couple years is always crazy to me. I've been journaling since January 2015, and I'm only halfway through my A5 Moleskine!

How do you do it??
Nope, never heard of them ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
I can't really speak for or against it too much, as I don't practice *daily* journaling. I just journal when I want to or I feel necessary. 

I did try daily journaling a year ago, and the biggest problem I found with it was kicking myself for forgetting sometimes. So I just said "screw it, I'll journal when I want." ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Geez, that's crazy! Haha I've been journaling since the beginning of January 2015, and I've filled up *almost* half of an A5 Moleskine. How often do you journal?? ^^Also ^^pretty ^^cool ^^to ^^see ^^a ^^fellow ^^Christian ^^on ^^here ^^:)
Wow, that's really cool! How many years have you been journaling? And how do you find so much stuff to write all the time? I've been journaling in my Moleskine since January 2015 and I'm only almost halfway through.
My current journal is a Moleskine and I don't like it :(
Haha I was gifted one of those a week ago!

Oh nice!
Woah what pen is that
Haha I posted about this on /r/FountainPens the other day and someone else had the same story.

How long did it take you to finally start having legible handwriting? And when did it start getting consistent?

Something I noticed was how tired my hand got after just ten minutes of practice. :(

By the way, welcome to Reddit!
Oh, that sucks dude. I'm homeschooled, and two of my family members are also lefties, so it wasn't really an issue with me.

My handwriting used to be a lot neater though :(
[Sorry if this is still a terrible angle](https://imgur.com/a/vOM1a)

>But it doesn’t really matter if it writes well and doesn’t cramp up your hand, which is what’s really important

Yeah I agree. 

One of the reasons I really wanna learn to be right handed is using other fountain pens, especially stub nibs. I own a stub nib (the blue ink in the photo above) and it's really scratchy. And then I could use dip pens too!
Thanks!
I think the main reason I wanna be a righty is that the fountain pen will glide across the page better. Sometimes I feel like I'm just pushing it forward as it fights against me, haha
Yeah, I guess it's a perspective thing. Haha I'm terrible at drawing too!
I dunno. I've always done over-writing, and the pen still glides along like a fountain pen should. IMO my handwriting looks best when I over-write, and writing any other way gives me hand cramps.

Someone noticed the Metros <3
Love you too bud <3

A5 for me currently. It's the perfect balance of page size to portability. It fits in pretty much any bag and it's lightweight. The idea of an A4 appeals to me though; being able to see so much writing on one page sounds awesome!

Anyone here use an A4? How's your experience?
Ever since the beginning of my journal, I've always written *Month Day, Year - Location*

It's not really something I do intentionally; I just started doing it and it stuck.
Alright, I'll do it right after school.
Sometimes during gameplay, usually after I open a menu, the game will drop down to about 25-30fps. Then usually after I enter a new area of the map, the game will go back up to 60fps.

Sorry for the confusing language!
OH MY GOSH. Knowing that there were more than one page on that website would've been so helpful to know last night, haha! I guess I was just really tired and not paying attention.

Idk if you'll be able to answer this, but after I enabled FXAA, Stardew Valley would drop frames noticeably as I moved about the map. Do you know why this is? I had the laptop plugged in so it was using full power (like it wasn't in eco-battery mode), but it still happened.
*Ctrl+f "anti", "FXAA", "aliasing"*

Nothing :(

That was actually one of the first threads I looked at, haha
You're telling me lol
Good bot
I love people who write detailed replies :)

>I've been accumulating excuses to use fountain pens for ~5 years now :)

Haha I've been doing it for one year

>Moleskine is known for that. They're popular journals, but definitely not designed for fountain pens.

Yeah, it's probably time to get an LT1917. I actually have an old commonplace book (basically a notebook dedicated to others' writing that you want to remember) that was Black n' Red; I used my silver MR in it and it worked great! Unfortunately the book is beat to heck now.

>I have an ultra-extra-fine nib with [[Noodler's X-Feather]] for crappy paper or just writing tiny.

I hope to be like this someday; a pen for every occasion.
Well it's because I over-write (my hand is arched over the paper) and it only gets scratchy on downstrokes, when I'm literally pushing the pen down across the paper.
> nanami seven seas

Thanks, I'm looking into it now!
Dang that's nice.
Sorry, but unfortunately I don't have an answer. You're right, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but at least it works!

Although I did notice that Stardew Valley would suddenly drop down from 60fps to about 30fps sometimes, and then jump back up after twenty seconds.
I've heard the paper is really fountain pen-friendly, so I'm definitely interested in one for my next journal.

Oh, that stinks. If I could afford it I'd send you one and some ink for Christmas :(

But yeah, they're definitely a hobby. People think we're insane, but it's just another hobby. If mechanical pencils work, then great! Honestly learning how to write with a fountain pen can be a little tricky anyway. 
Haha let's hope they don't dry out before you use them all!
How big is the capacity in an aeromatic? My Pilot Metro only gets about 0.9ml in.
>The hooded nib makes it a low profile fountain pen, if you care about drawing attention

Oh thank goodness. Crap, there goes $60 on another pen lol
>well, I meant that if the nib is damaged, it's worthless to write with - I wouldn't disparage the MR :)

Oh, haha

So I assume nib tuning isn't something you do with an inked pen?

>The pens in the EDC pouch all get used fairly frequently

Dang, you must be writing way more than me.

How often do you use "normal", non-fountain-pen-friendly paper? How do you deal with feathering? Should I just tune my pen to write drier? I get a crap ton of feathering from my Pilot MR in my Moleskine.
Ooh how do you like the Leuchtturm?

Dude, get the Pilot MR, it's great! It can be scratchy if you get one with a "stub" nib, but if you just get the medium (which is more like a fine nib honestly), then it writes great. I've pretty much just used Pilot Namiki black ink cartridges so far, but I've been wanting to try a new ink.
>FP when I can, BP when I can’t.

Words to live by
Haha I think someone else told me too stay away from those!

What's the advantage of the 51s?
Comment saved!
Wow, saved that comment
Woah

Hmm. I prefer a medium on my Pilot MR, but Japanese mediums are smaller then other ones.
[Crappy example photo of overwriting](https://i.imgur.com/ZX8lqvX.jpg)

Sometimes I even turn my wrist more clockwise than that. I really wish I could write another way, but I'm so used to writing that way that I can't really switch right now.
Alright, I'll look into getting a loupe. Haha yeah it's a pretty cheap pen!

So tuning the pen also includes spreading the tines apart or squishing them together?

Holy crap that EDC is something else. Did any of them ever dry out, or did you use them so frequently that that never happened?
Thanks for the recommendation!
Are you right-handed?
Nice, and thanks for telling me which paper you use! I've looked online but all I can find is Tomoe River, which is way too see-through for me and too small.
How scratchy is the nib for you? I'm left-handed so using my stub-nib Pilot Metro is really annoying.
Not bad at all! How many pens do you have inked so far?
I got a bunch of mixed opinions on the pen. Did you have to do any nib tuning before it would write reliably, or was it just good out of the box?
I'm also a student, but we have to use cheaper composition notebooks, so I end up just using a Pilot G2 07 for that. But every time I journal, I always use my Pilot Metro. 

When I go to college, I'll definitely be using a nice notebook (or nice paper) and a fountain pen.

How scratchy do you find a stub nib? I have one, but I don't really use it too much as a left-hander. I'm an overwriter, so when I write downstrokes, it gets really scratchy.
My black Pilot Metro has started getting really loose on the cap. The clip is starting to move back and forth and it uncaps a little to easily for my taste now. Fortunately I got a new one for my birthday last year, and that one has been my journaling pen all year.

Do you know what notebook it is? I've been looking for a cheaper one than an LT1917 but I can't really find any.

I don't really have any basis for this opinion, but my Pilot Metro (medium) seems like a really wet writer. Do you have any recommendations for a drier black ink?
>but i’m about to buy a TWSBI Eco (Fine Nib)

That's one of the ones on my birthday wishlist! I asked about it a few days ago and people said it was a really good pen. I hope you get it!

>i’m thinking about buying a LT1917

Yeah they look like really good notebooks. I heard it takes a little longer to dry because of the paper they use - which might be an issue for me as a left-hander - but I would definitely get it over a Rhodia. I might buy a Rhodia eventually just as a drawing book though.

>I'm also a lover of washi tape!

Same! I'd love to use it more but every time I pick up my journal, I just grab my Pilot Metro and start writing.
Wow, next time my brother does a Taobao haul (he loves rep sneakers), I might try this. How many pens/books did you buy total? And how long did it take to ship? Also, if you don't mind me asking, how much was shipping? I know my brother always tries to buy the lightest stuff possible due to crazy shipping costs.
>>Get a sturdy one like that Kaweco, maybe in stone-washed so you won't notice wear... or get a case for it... or get a cheap pen and don't care if it's dropped.

I posted about the Kaweco Sport (just the $20 plastic one) and I got really mixed reviews. "Smooth and reliable" "I had two and they were too scratchy" "Wet writer" etc. I guess if it's just $20 then it's not too much of a big deal.

>An excellent opportunity to learn how to tune a nib :P

Haha I tried tuning the nib and it didn't work too well. I didn't try too ~~heard~~ hard though, maybe it's time to try and resurrect it again

>My current EDC overflows my 12-pen case.

Holy crap the EDC is *huge!* Do you have all of them inked all the time? Which one is your favorite? Least favorite?
Yeah that's true.

It's not that it's so much of a risk, it's just that I'm super cheap and put way too much research into something prior to buying it, haha.
How hard was it to find? And if you don't mind me asking, how much was it? I've been looking for a 51 but they all seem like they're a little out of my price range.
Dude, that pen looks awesome! What color do you have?
Do you use a fp-friendly notebook or looseleaf paper like Tomoe River?
I'd like to try a Lamy 2000 or a Safari. What nib do you use?
True! I like my Metro, other than ink capacity. I need more. But it's a beast for its price!
How do I escape the grind and make the most money right out of the gate? I've played eight and a half hours so far but I've only made about $9,000. I'm constantly in the mines and farming, but I don't seen to make much profit.

Also, what tool is worth upgrading first? I'm at a point in the mines where stones are harder to break, but I also farm a lot. Which will get me the most bang for my buck?
Happy cake day!

Alright, thanks!
Hey, glad you're taking an interest in journaling! I'll try to answer your questions as best I can.

>1 What should I write?

Anything you want. It sounds cliche but I write pretty much everything and I love it. How my day was, what happened, how I'm feeling, anything I'm currently nervous/sad about, grateful for, confused about, want to remember, etc.

>And when?

I think 5-7 days a week is good, usually at night so you can just dump out everything that happened that day. I'll admit, I'm horrendous at keeping consistent with my journaling. But writing what you want to do in the morning also sounds like a great thing to do; try it if you want!

>2 Should I use a notebook or an app?

*Notebook notebook notebook notebook notebook notebook notebook notebook notebook noteb-*

Seriously though, use a notebook and your favorite pen. It really helps you stay focused. I've tried electronic journaling before, but it just feels like I'm *disconnected* from what I'm writing, Plus, with a laptop or a phone, it's easy to get distracted by notifications or just flitting between apps. If you use a notebook, it's really almost soothing to feel the scratch of the pen against the paper, and it can help with your handwriting too. You might get hand cramps when you start but it's worth it. So I'd just stick with the notebook and pen.

Another thing I'd like to add is totally optional (well so is all the other advice, this one is just something I like to do): try a fountain pen. You know those pens that people use to sign fancy documents and stuff? Yeah, those. Try a [Pilot Metropolitan](https://www.amazon.com/Pilot-Metropolitan-Collection-Fountain-91107/dp/B009X9Z2FW) or a [Lamy Safari](https://www.amazon.com/Lamy-Safari-Fountain-Pen-Charcoal/dp/B0002T401Y) for starters. Fountain pens and ink can get expensive, but if you just use the more basic stuff, it's cheaper and easier to try. Just my extra little thought.

Don't worry about your english! Haha I couldn't even tell.

Hope this helps, and good luck!

**Edit:** If you do use a fountain pen, make sure the notebook you use has paper that works well with a fountain pen. Try a [Leuchtturm1917 notebook.](https://www.amazon.com/Leuchtturm1917-Medium-Size-Hardcover-Notebook/dp/B002TSIMW4/ref=sr_1_4?s=office-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1512354423&sr=1-4&keywords=leuchtturm1917) Hardcover with dotted pages works best for me.

Hey man, huge thanks to you and your team for making this app.
Unfortunately when I took this shot I didn't know to use live view, so that's probably the issue. The lens is a Pentax 50mm *f*/2 (adapted to my T5). The T5 does let you zoom in for live view and I've been using it a lot lately. It doesn't show focus confirmation with manual lenses (I feel like that shouldn't be THAT hard to implement though).

I always zoom in on the playback screen, but I had just spotted the berries and took a quick shot.

Thanks for the link to the Lighting 101!

Lol I didn't get your first sentence until I saw your username

Unfortunately I can't redo the composition and focus: this shot was from a friend's house who lives an hour away. Plus, I don't have contrast detection on my Canon T5, so manual focus (I was using a manual lens) is hard to nail. 

I was going for a darker, moodier look them I usually do, maybe it was a bit too much. The light was found. 

Do you have any tips for next time? I'd love to take more shots like this.
Wow, that's really crazy. I've always used Anker Powerline cables, and I've never had this problem. Guess that's why!

Yeah, I have the Lr free trial but I only use it on my phone and my Chromebook - I don't own a PC currently.
Yeah, it was a little windy, probably the cause.
Thanks for the advice, I appreciate it!
Haha, that's actually exactly what I did. Does it look out of focus or fuzzy? Maybe it's just the lens being funky
Oh my goodness, those colors are gorgeous.

I actually don't use it on my K1000 - I adapt it to my Canon T5. But the chromatic aberration is nothing compared to my K-mount SMC-A 50mm *f*/2. Plus it's tack sharp, focus ring is buttery smooth, and though the aperture ring wiggles a tiny bit, it's still clicky and works well. Good lens for $4 if you ask me!

[Sample from tonight's sunset](https://i.imgur.com/zhd5aNp.jpg)
Yeah! I also have a Pentax SMC-A 50mm *f*/2, and the chromatic aberration is abysmal compared to my new 28mm. It's tack sharp too!

I actually just started learning Python! I still don't get it though 🤔
We always watch Elf, have you seen that?
Christmas smells are the best. We have an essential oil blend (trust me we're not big into oils lol) that smells like Christmas; I think it's called Holiday Spirit or something. 

Our food tradition is monkey bread. It's super unhealthy so we only have it once a year, but it's so good!

I put *It's Beginning To Look a Lot Like Christmas* by Michael Bublé on my playlist.
Hanging with parents is pretty chill. I'm sorry to hear about your grandpa and other family.

Christmas music, *yes!*
I mean hey, it is a bit blasphemous! We can be blasphemous together lol

Decorations are the *best!* I like to string my bed with white Christmas lights and put a little Christmas tree on my desk.
Haha  sounds like me on weekends, besides the math.

Do you like watching any Christmas specials?
What do you usually do?
Any way I can get in a little late?

Hello, I'm really sorry to hear about your cousin. That was a beautiful song.

I hope you're coping well.
1. Yes! I went camping at a lake, and it was really fun. We saw lots of deer and I had my first Casey's gas station pizza.

2. Never, I only use my garbage Chromebook.

3. Too much

4. I know this is a stupid answer but I don't actually have a favorite movie, so I'll go with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. I really like the camera work and the color theme of the movie, they go really well with the theme of the book.

5. Eesh that's a hard one. I'll have to go with coffee, although tea isn't very far behind!
Nope :(
They look so happy it makes me happy :)
Haha glad I could help!
What's the other app besides GPlay? Is it Shuttle?
Nope
[Another unexpected advantage of Sync!](https://i.imgur.com/MaohYPe.png)

[Mod tools](https://i.imgur.com/lk5Vral.png)

Plus automatic light-dark mode switching, tons of different post views, and lockscreen shortcuts in 7.1.2! It's a really great app. The pro version is well worth it to get rid of ads and support the developer, /u/ljdawson. He's pretty active on /r/RedditSync and is always open to suggestions!

GIF with a *hard* G??

I'm afraid we can't be friends.
Oh boy you're gonna wish you hadn't said that... For some reason. 

Sync has a native GIF player, swipe to go back (like iOS), and offline syncing for posts *and* comments! Beat that, hecking loser!

[Oooooh, look at all these theming options](https://i.imgur.com/ODwndue.png)

On a side note, how do you pronounce GIF?
Hey I like your flair, where can I buy one of those phones?
How about the S8 rooting/custom ROM community? Is it active? If it is, I'd totally consider getting one!

Yeah, it might be that. 

It's definitely not my on-device synthesis, that sounds a lot different. This change that I noticed is a lot more subtle than when I use Google Assistant offline.

Please OP!
Happy cake day!
Hey man - no pressure, take your time. This is an amazing app that you've made and I understand how hard it is to push major updates like this. Keep rockin!
Oops! I don't know anything about the G4, only the G4+ - I get them confused a lot. 

Yeah, I wouldn't mind updates either! I got mine after it was updated to Nougat, so I've never personally gotten an update.
Don't get the G4+. I've only had problems with it - UI is slow for some reason, gets really hot quickly, fingerprint scanner isn't very fast, camera is slow... Etc. 

Plus, if you care about updates (I do), this probably isn't the phone for you. We got Nougat, and then there was a whole controversy over whether we would get Oreo or not. I'm still pretty skeptical that we'll ever get it.

I made the wrong decision :(

Hey guys, come on over to my Anchor station!

I just started posting today and I think it'll be a fun little learning experience for me, and entertaining for you guys.

Dude.

You just made my day.

Yeah, I'll totally follow! It's really crazy to me that I inspired someone totally random to *do* something. Thanks for the link!
Yes, yes, *yes!* That's *exactly* how I feel. 
Don't worry about it! I saw a quote by Henri Cartier-Bresson, a famous old street photographer: *"Your first ten thousand photographs are your worst."*

I think he means that your work is going to be trash at first, but the only way to get better is to just *start now.* That's advice that I need to follow too!
What kinds of art do you like?
Yeah, his videos and work are really inspiring! And thanks for the recommendations, I'll be sure to check them out!
Thanks for the recommendations; I'll check them out!

Honestly, I don't really have any favorites, besides Thomas Heaton. His work is really inspiring. I mostly just shoot and edit and admire my own work (not to sound boastful).

Which subreddit is that? Haha I honestly can't remember talking about birds here on Reddit.

I got this phone six freaking months ago. Seriously.
I dunno what I was thinking. My brother had an X Pure. How did I think this would be different?

:(
It's... Okay. Not very fast, HDR mode literally just makes the photos take longer and makes them brighter. Video is meh. No Optical image stabilization, and the electronic and stabilization is pretty bad. But otherwise, it's good at autofocus, lowlight shots are pretty good, and the photos come out clean and sharp 90% of the time.

*I forgot to mention this: The double-twist gesture to open the camera. Super useful and reliabe 99% of the time. It's way better than the annoying (IMO) double-power-button press, and I wish other phone manufacturers had it. Not relevant to camera quality, but I've found the feature useful quite a bit.
Oh nice! I just hope it isn't another X Pure situation. :(
Unfortunately, I don't know. I really wanna try custom ROMing and things like that, but I don't want to void my warranty yet. If Lineage OS 15.0 comes to the G4 Plus in six months, I'm totally getting it though!
*The image you are requesting does not exist or is no longer available.*
No G4+, dang it.
Ohhhhhhh, okay, thanks!
Seriously, no G4+?
Could someone ELI5? What's the notch approach?
Yeah, maybe it's worth the unsubscribe. What other photography Youtubers would you recommend?

Eh, although I got downvoted, at least I started a discussion.
I feel like you're being a bit strong. Yes, he does get worked up, and yes, he's also a jerk a lot of the time, but you can't deny the fact that at least some of what he says is definitely true and good advice. I just try to look past his personality and listen to his advice instead.
What language is that?
1. Did you ever think anything like this would happen?

2. How did your co-workers react?

3. What are you planning to do with your new-found fame?
Thanks, that really answered my question!

I may be wrong, but I think that's a [juvenile yellow-bellied sapsucker.](https://i.imgur.com/zp2NCVZ.jpg) Downy and hairy woodpeckers have a tiny patch of red the back of their head, but this one seems to have red on the top of his head. ;)

There's not a lot you can do with a black disc and some white stuff, so I tried adding a little color. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Yeah, it can get pretty expensive, but if you know what you're looking for, you can find some pretty crazy deals.

And if you're feeling discouraged because of your gear, don't worry about it! Sure, it can limit you, but think of the limits as creative challenges to overcome. When people look at a photograph, they won't judge it by what camera it was taken on - they'll judge whether it's an appealing photograph.

Anyway, I hope you enjoy taking photos - it's a really fun and relaxing hobby, and after experimenting for awhile, it really pays off! Good luck!

Wow, those are awesome dude! I especially like the yellow spongy stuff and the log. If I may ask, what camera did you use?

Yeah, she was pretty brown for awhile when she was younger, but *sloooooowly* turned more and more blue. My other budgie, Louis, has a super dark, almost purple-blue cere, and he's definitely a male.

I think Jane is female also because she's a lot smaller and doesn't sing hardly at all. When she does though, she *screams*!

Hey, it's you! I read that article awhile back and it blew my mind how much the gear was damaged.

Have you tried any other protective gear to shield your camera while on a shoot, or are you still using the grocery bag?

Also, that's a killer photo, great job!
Fine, I just *won't* be polite then.

Haha in all seriousness, I'm with you on the "too polite" thing. I think part of it is that most everyone here is a total stranger to one another, which makes people think they should be really polite.  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Phone in one hand, camera in the other...?
Dude, it looks awesome! 

I did notice a few things:

1. When I'm in an artist and I hit the back button, the animations are a bit buggy and it always takes me to the top of my artists, even if I was near the bottom before. 

2. The now playing screen seems a little inconsistent. I think the app tries too hard to find any color and will ignore the overall theme of the album art, especially if the main color of the album art is white or gray. I was listening to Pure Heroine by Lorde, and the [background for the controls turned green.](http://i.imgur.com/IZBXfTg.png)

Probably a stupid question, but did you have a good protective case and a screen protector on those broken phones? It really helps a lot, if you haven't looked into those.
Interesting, so which one is your favorite? Is it your Decimo?

Also, do you have any experience with the glass pen?

I have an A5 Moleskine that is only half used, and I started it on January 2, 2015.
Wow, nice collection! How long did it take to collect all of them, and which one is your daily driver?
Solved... ☹️
I'm heeeeeeeeeeere
Yay!
I have no experience with the G5 Plus, but I can definitely recommend the G4 Plus! The 64gb with 4gb of RAM is really nice to have, and I can leave apps in my recents and come back to them right where I left off after several hours. The phone tends to get pretty warm due to the Snapdragon 617, but I've gotten used to it and it doesn't bother me.

I want to add that the G4 Plus has a 5.5" 1080p display, while the G5 Plus's display is a 5.2" 1080p, considerably smaller than the G4 Plus. If you have small hands, you might want to consider the G5 Plus, but the G4 Plus has worked well for me even in my tiny hands - I just hold the phone differently now. 

Also, this is just personal taste, but the bezel-to-screen ratio on the G4 Plus is *significantly* better than the G5 Plus.

**And and and** the G4 Plus with 64gb and 4gb RAM (in black) is currently $230 in the US. [Link](https://www.amazon.com/Moto-XT1644-Storage-Unlocked-Warranty/dp/B01DZJFWNC/ref=sr_1_1/134-4044906-4495918?ie=UTF8&qid=1501966689&sr=8-1&keywords=moto+g4+plus)

Hope this helps!
Yeah, the phone tends to get pretty warm with heavy ur or while fast charging. Plus, very rarely, I'll get ghost touches which are always solved by hitting the sleep button and unlocking the phone again. 

Otherwise, it's a budget beast. Great camera, pretty fast and smooth, and killer battery life. I regularly get 4-4.5 hours of SOT. 

I got the black 64gb/4gb RAM model on Amazon for $250, and I couldn't be happier!

Sounds like the Moto G4 Plus is the phone for you. It's my daily driver, and it's a really good phone for $250!

Yes, yes, yes! I got a little tired of photography after using my PowerShot for a long time, and getting a DSLR really helped me get back into it. Being able to experiment on my own and *really* manipulate an image is so exciting!
The students will love those! I started on a PowerShot and moved to a T5 a year and a half ago. Having a DSLR is so much better because it's a whole new level of camera control they haven't experienced yet. Nice!

5. Mine is a mix of both. The first day I got my phone, I got a screen protector and a case, and they both went on right away. The case is understated; a dark grey case that doesn't add too much bulk, but is still thick enough to protect my phone.
That's okay!
Yep, it's installed in the right place and I double-checked to make sure I was using the right come in. I guess it just doesn't work with mods right now! ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
This might sound like a stupid question, but after I type in the command to install it (after making sure it's extracted into the world save and the texture pack is enabled), I get "No such function '(function name)'". Is there any way to fix this? Am I doing something wrong?

I'm running a modded 1.12 version of Minecraft, with OptiFine enabled.
Hey man! 

First of all, thanks for doing this. The people that receive the keys will be super happy, I'm sure.

My older brother got this game about a year ago, and ever since he got it, my younger brother has been wanting to play it with him. They can't play together since my younger bro doesn't own the game. I haven't told my younger brother that I'm doing this, and I can't wait to see his reaction if this game appears in his Steam library.

Thanks so much for doing this!

Yes, Nova is the best!

[Here's my current setup.](http://imgur.com/jCNDIVR)

/u/TheBravePoro Nova truly is the best. It's fast, clean, ad-free, and there's so many different things you can do with it. Tweak to your heart's content!
I wonder how much they're worth collectively.
Well I use the command in your top comment to install the software center, and it works fine. I just have to use that second command to actually install things from the software center. I think you also have to give the software center some privileges or something. I don't really remember, I haven't messed with it in days, sorry!
Good bot.
Yep!
Yep, that's the one! Thanks!
There was someone here on /r/Minecraft recently who was talking about a sound mod that he was making. I can't remember what it was called. What's the name of the mod your using? That might trigger my memory.
Photography. As a high school student, I can tell you that it's super expensive.

Also, fountain pens. Another big cost there.
Oh, was she the lady in the video by Great Big Story? I watched that one and it was really cool!

My last name has an O in it (pronounced "oh"), but people say it like "ah" all the time. Or they don't even try, and when I ask, they have to confirm it like five times.

Another thing is when people don't push their chairs in at the dinner table or in a restaurant. Seriously, you can't be bothered to take seven seconds to give everyone else space when you leave?
I tried ramen with a poached egg in it. It was *revolutionary.* Definitely a meal I'm saving!
I'm obsessed with pens. I wish more people liked writing on pen and paper, because there's something so soothing and therapeutic about it that I feel like people are missing out on. Especially with fountain pens! Those things are the writing instruments of the gods. But everyone sticks to cheap BiC pens and stuff. Maybe I sound like someone out of /r/IAmVerySmart, I dunno. I just feel like people would enjoy it so much more if they knew what was out there.

**Small Poppies** by *Courtney Barnett*

**Stardust** by *John Coltrane*

**Paper Mache Dream Balloon,** an album by *King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard*

**Ponciana,** an album by *Ahmad Jamal*

**Lovely Day** by *Bill Withers*

That's my list for now, but there's still a ton of music to explore!
And that's how Atlantis happened.
Wow, thanks so much for the detailed response. I'll look into them!
Is it worth it over a normal bound notebook, especially when used as a journal?
Yep, and to launch the software center, I use:

     gksu software-center

Otherwise you can't install things from the software center.
Yes, mods are great! I added Quark, Optifine, and InventoryTweaks, along with Lagless shaders, and the game feels new again. I feel like I'll never get sick of it!

Also, happy cake day!
Aww, thanks!
Uh oh, you dropped this:

Wow, that's really cool! What kinds of things do they teach in Chinese calligraphy classes?
* My family. They're the most wonderful people in the world and I don't know what I'd do without them.

* Reading my Bible. It keeps me grounded in my faith.

* Fountain pens and writing! I absolutely *love* writing, and fountain pens are like the holy grail of writing instruments.

* Also coffee, but never caffeinated. I know, I'm a heretic, but caffeine wrecks me, and I absolutely love the taste of the coffee, so it's decaf for me.

* Courtney Barnett, instrumental jazz, and King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard. Highly recommend all three.
Solid advice.
Wow, nice pen, and *wow* even nicer handwriting! Seriously, that handwriting is amazing. The top line is especially gorgeous. How long have you been practicing?
I have three from Amazon; they all work great and are sturdy, so I'm assuming they aren't.
Louis and Jane, my four-year-old parakeets! They're super loud all day, but they're adorable and love each other. They're kind of scared of my hands, but love it when I talk to them. I love waking up to their singing every morning.

Louis is a loud coward. He screams and sings all day long, but as soon as you stick your hand in the cage, he nopes all the way to the other side of the cage. He's a little bigger than Jane. 

Jane goes through mood swings. Sometimes she's content to just sit, other times she runs around the cage, flapping her wings and screaming, and other times she attacks everything and wants to *destroy destroy destroy.*. She likes Louis, but Jane is definitely the top birb.

They make a lot of mess (feathers and bird seed *everywhere!*), but I think it's worth it. I was a huge bird nerd for a few years, and I've always wanted a bird or two to call my own. I got them on October 12, 2013, and they've been super happy ever since.

Alright, I'm ready!
I passed my driving test today with a perfect 0!
It's okay, next time, you got it.
I found heaven.
Everyone here is a bot except for you.
If you don't mind sharing, what are the specs of your computer, and does it run at 60fps or close? I've been looking for something besides Lagless Shaders (barely any options) and SEUS (runs at 30fps tops).
Sorry I'm fifteen hours late, but happy birthday man!
What upvotes

Huh, guess my first car will be a stick-shift. 

Thanks dude!
I did parallel parking for the first time on Friday, and let me tell you, it's pretty difficult. Although having a nice instructor helps! Good luck!
1. Magnolia blooms

2. Night owl!

3. Passing my road test. 

4. Starting a career in landscape photography!

5. Waffly!
I use Sync for Reddit (Pro) and it's awesome! I highly recommend it, worth getting the pro version.
Passing my road test so I can get the "waiver", getting a job and saving up for a laptop and REAL photo editing software.
So let's say you had TEN machine guns, all firing simultaneously. How long would it take then?
Just to clarify, do you mean so that all the land on earth is completely submerged?
Thanks dude! :D
Oh boy. Here we go.
Buy a Fuji X-T2 with a 50mm lens (about $1800 right there ☹️), save the rest!
I got my permit recently, and I have my road test on Monday, then I'll be done with driver's ed!

My first time wasn't too terrible. A little herky jerky, but my first time driving *stick* was something else. Lots of car shuddering, killed it once, and starting uphill is a nightmare. But there's something about it that makes me want to do it more!
Good bot

FTFY 😉
There are some pretty funny ones on there, but I'm looking for ones in picture format that I can easily send to my friends.
I actually ended up powerwashing my Chromebook and reinstalling XFCE, and I got Anbox to work. Thanks for your help though!
Oh, sorry!

I ran the command, in XFCE and the Chrome terminal, but it said "No such file or directory" both times.
Yep, installed Xubuntu running XFCE
Forgive me if this is a stupid question, but how do I find out what version of Ubuntu I'm running on XFCE?
I'm running XFCE version 4.12. Is that what you mean?
Yep, 4.12, must have read it wrong inside XFCE. I have Xubuntu (I think that's the distro?) I don't think snap is installed because "sudo snap" doesn't work inside the terminal.
Oops! I'm running Xubuntu, sorry. I'm a total newbie at the whole Linux thing, so I apologize for any mistakes made in writing.
Yep, I'm running Chrome OS, but also running XFCE (Xubuntu) separately. I used crouton to install it, if that helps.
I'm so pumped for the final product! Keep up the rad work!
