White chocolate always smells sickening, especially those Lindt truffles. The taste is just sweetened butter, as you would expect, but the fragrance is not remotely close to real chocolate.
The top of the line brands are Valrhona and Scharffen Berger, but there are plenty of cheaper ones that are excellent. I remember Trader Joe's having a really good store brand a while back. As a rule, they really don't make "bad" chocolate with more than 50% cocoa. If you do prefer milk chocolate, Lindt is the most popular option.

That's a rabbit hole you shouldn't use as an example. The Wehrmacht-SS distinction is actually a fairly complex topic, so the scholarly consensus is different from what you see in entertainment media and even most schoolbooks. If you're suggesting a sort of "neutral Wehrmacht vs. evil SS" theme, you're actually spreading an outdated idea.

I want less of a focus on mashing buttons in combat and more of "everything else" of RPGs, something more akin to Elder Scrolls but built from scratch for the multiplayer experience.

There are three main ways of making money. Solo money objects are just watching your sim interact with an object for several minutes, with the payout determined by your skills and the number of people also working on the lot. Group money objects involve a simple minigame with up to three other people. Jobs involve going to an instance map once an in-game day with several other players and performing a more intricate co-operative minigame.

You also get money from donations from visitors, owning money lots, being in the top 100 lots of your category, selling objects on money lots, and gambling on casino lots.

The phrase "papers, please" used to be a jab at how totalitarian governments worked their way into everyday lives.

A wizardry post-war trial would be extremely complicated. Magic allows all sorts of deception, and we know that even mind control is available to dishonest wizards. Not everybody who commits crimes in the HP universe is necessarily acting through their own will.

Of course, the wizarding world is a literal slave society, so we can't imagine that their victor's justice would be squeaky clean. Aurors are probably less Sherlock Holmes and more NKVD.

It's always a sad day when an old franchise stops supporting cheats. Rome: Total War had incredibly creative cheat codes, but newer titles have none. Total War is one of those games that does have a highly-customizable skirmish mode, so players still have freedom. However, this is rare outside of the strategy and tactics genre. Assassin's Creed, for example, has to be played linearly except for a fairly restrictive "replay" mode. There's a lot of content in that game, but you have to experience it the way the developers intended it.

I honestly think that micro-transaction culture is damaging single-player game design. Publishers now have an incentive to make unavoidably difficult games, and not many games support modding.

Determining a game's worth by "hours of content" is pointless, and all reviews should discuss replayability. Would any reasonable person describe chess or SimCity using units of time?

As a kid, I never played cinematic story-based games, so it always seemed strange for people for fork over good money for something that only provides a week or so of entertainment. For example, I really loved playing through *Assassin's Creed II*. It's a masterpiece. However, I'm unwilling to pick it up again. There's a story with unskippable missions and cutscenes, and no game in the series has what strategy games call a "skirmish mode" where you can create your own scenarios without the restrictions of your current campaign progression. To me, that's a severe mark against *Assassin's Creed II* as a product.

And this doesn't mean that I hate games that invest in writing or lack deep gameplay. *Dishonored* is basically the same genre as *Bioshock: Infinite*, but it does something intelligent. Not only does the campaign have enough flexibility to reward repeated playthroughs, you can even select individual levels to play again. Reviews should mention this.
I don't like levels where most of the surfaces are blocked off. To me, just jumping and shooting portals everywhere is half the fun.

What's the current stance of future support? For some reason, people get convinced that each expansion is going to be the last.
The game is surprisingly deep with no expansions at all! However, if you were to buy two pieces of DLC, they would be **The Old Gods** and **Way of Life**. The former extends the timeline earlier and unlocks exciting pagan religions in many regions. The latter adds more role-playing depth to the game by letting your character do more things outside of war.

If you want to know about the paid expansions, the official wiki has summaries of all the features, including what kinds of religions or governments can be played. For a new player, I would stay away from the newer ones (**The Conclave** and later).
For me, Conclave was an expensive sidegrade. The council system didn't make the game any more enjoyable for me, and the minor features were forgettable. It's the last "depth" (as opposed to breadth) expansion anybody should buy.
Unlike EU4, this game is perfectly enjoyable without DLC, although The Old Gods and Way of Life do add an enormous amount of replayability.

There's no precedent of people carrying explosives to protests with peaceful intentions (because the act itself is criminal), so that would be a legitimate threat.
One of my favorite genres is the slow-burning thriller of the 70s. These were action movies, of course, but ones with a certain "style" that fell out of favor in the 80s. I'm talking about things like The Mechanic, which is a story about murder, yet the first half hour has no dialogue or violence.

That's your preference, and most consumers share it. Some people have a higher tolerance of risk, by which I mean the risk that a game will be drastically changed in the future or the risk that game will abandoned in an unfinished state.

Thanks to Early Access, developers can raise funds and get feedback from adventurous players, while consumers more like yourself can continue to buy complete games published with the traditional expectation of quality. It's the best solution for everyone.
In Revelations, they use a hook attached to their bracer. This solves the hand problem, but it does make you wonder how long those ropes last.

I'm glad that the internet makes it easy to patch games after release, but we've entered an era where publishers know they can sell games in a broken state and promise to fix them later. It's gone from being a shameful exception to the industry standard.

In response to this trend, Valve had the excellent idea of allowing indie devs to advertise their games as works in progress to avoid upsetting customers who only want games that are guaranteed to be complete, but stupid people ruined it. Too many players buy games in Early Access and then complain that development is slow.

One must imagine Sisyphus happy
There's a whole lot of /r/badhistory in that thread (thank you, Cold War-era historiography), so let's make some things clear:

**The SS was not a fanatical volunteer elite**.  It turns out that quite a few people died in combat around the time of Stalingrad. As in, "there's no way we can replenish these divisions if we only accept the Aryan gods we put on the propaganda posters" many people. The standards for the SS were debased so far that *non-Germans* were subject to the draft, along with graduating Hitler Youths who were too young to even remember a time before Nazi terror. Of course, the linked thread mentions an actual convicted felon, whom we can all agree is not Nazi Navy SEAL material.

**The Wehrmacht wasn't so squeaky clean**. Immediately after the war, leaders from every branch were prosecuted for the brutal atrocities they oversaw. However, western post-war propaganda switched to a different narrative for interesting strategic reasons. The world was told that the Wehrmacht was actually not particularly cruel, and that German soldiers and officers fought bravely and honorably. Modern day historians know much better, and if you're still in doubt, just ask survivors in occupied Europe what they thought of the "noble" German army.

**David Irving is a smug charlatan**. You might have been forgiven in 1980 for using Irving as a source on the Holocaust, but nowadays it's abundantly clear that he's a Nazi sympathizer who's willing to spread misinformation to suit his needs. Read a different book about the Holocaust, and at least you'll have a chance at seeing the academic consensus. At this point, Irving's life and work are considered strictly entertainment.

Not at all. The SS even became a conscript force during the war, which by definition cannot maintain "ideological purity".
