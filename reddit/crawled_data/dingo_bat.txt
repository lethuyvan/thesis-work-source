You can just decline the update I think. But you won't get security updates either.
Don't stress it man Oreo literally has no new features. You'll see zero difference in day to day usage. 
There are many adblocks for the samsung broswer in the play store. Also there used to be system-wide knox-based adblockers that would block ads everywhere, but samsung forced them off the play store for some stupid reason.

I pre-ordered my S7e. So it is fully 2 years old now. I don't use package disablers or any other such apps. I install apps and games. I did a reset once a few months ago. The phone works *better* than it did on launch. Only the battery has degraded. Still getting a full day of use though.
No slowdown in my 2 year old S7e either. And I install a lot of apps and games. I did reset it once a few months ago. 
They will keep adding shitty stuff until they cancel it for "lack of traction". But they won't try to get traction by adding features that matter.

SEARCH ENHANCED MESSAGING. 
When did I say that??! I said the opposite!
Nobody copies pixel.
In India every single person is on whatsapp. It works perfectly across carriers, states, countries, wifis. It works for sharing pictures, videos, texts, emojis, location, contacts, documents. It works for audio calls, video calls, voice messages. It works for groups, it works on ios, on android, on feature phones. My SMS app is only to check my bank messages.
Soon Apple will "innovate" e-Sim cards which you cannot remove. Only carriers can reprogram it. Then all androids will copy the fuck out of it. Then even in India we will experience the lock-in. Say bye bye to the fun and convenience.
Nope. Search enhanced messaging.
Hangouts works very well on ios.
People can ditch it though.
Apple doesn't care and nor do their users.
That is Samsung's own imessage clone I think. It works regardless of carrier. Just both sender and recipient should be on Samsung. It's quite useful. Auto-switches to SMS too when there's no data coverage.
They were not doing *anything* under google.
> The whole team is being moved to Chat

The reason for that is:

Oh no! What will all those 12 allo users do now?
> it's primarily an update to the APIs provided to app developers

Exactly. The entire release is just stuff they neglected to include in the main .0 release. 
> The changes listed on this page are new APIs and changes to APIs, not bug fixes. It's the documentation for API level 27 for app developers.

Extremely minor. Should not need a point release. I'm sure Samsung can add it in a security patch.

Sounds useful.

Already a feature on most phones.

Something wrong with your unit or maybe the apps you are using. Mine is as fast as it was at launch. Try doing a full factory reset and don't restore backup. Not from Google not from Samsung. Start fresh. See if it is still slow.

Not only the The Williams sisters were found out of depth, their best shots were easily countered. He beat Serena 6-1 and Venus 6-2.

Anandtech used to be very technically correct earlier. But nowadays it seems their quality has gone down a lot.

Agreed, only anandtech encountered such extreme differences. Nobody else did. Probably a defective exynos device. Or maybe old software or something.

Modem and screen are definitely not needed. For most of telephones' history, people have used phones with just a dial pad and mic/speaker.
Taking that logic a bit further, it's much easier to design a phone without a camera. Just have a much more awesome camera in an external module. Why not? Remove the fucking modem also! Oh you want to use a screen? Just connect this awesome external display! It's bigger so easy touching, more viewing space, easily replaceable if you crack it, etc.

I see what you mean. You need to go to display settings, then status bar and turn off the battery percentage. Then AOD will also stop showing the percentage.
I have been able to turn off the battery percentage quite simply since aod first came out in s7.

What if I want to send small texts like links etc during a video call? It'd be great if they can integrate a basic chat feature into duo. Nothing major just simple text box and send button. Active only during the call.
They can use whatever engine they want. It's not like ios.

It shows 74% which is close to accubattery's 70% estimate. However the number of cycles is 133 which is utterly wrong. I have had this for 2 full years now.

That won't happen. If the same generation of exynos is much better than that of qualcom, they will just use exynos everywhere. Look at galaxy s6. That year all competitors got fucked by SD810, but Sammy used exynos everywhere and S6 had no issues.
Google will make fun of it this year and have their own the next year.

None of those is high end. And I am talking about android. Iphonex is quite reasonably sized and packs very high-end hardware.
Any examples?
I too won't consider an iPhone, but saying it has "less" hardware is wrong. They pack a lot of great hardware into a relatively small form factor.
The S8 does not have:

- kinect
- pressure sensing screen
- dual camera

The iphone does and is slightly smaller.
No this is just AR. It works on your screen.
That's the biggest battery Samsung has packed into a phone in any flagship for the last 4 years (barring Note7). So of course it makes sense it will last more. What about more recent offerings that are comparable to ipx in features and size? You'll find that ipx and S9/S8 (not the + versions) are basically identical in battery life.
> Small-ass battery

Still lasts longer or same as any Samsung phone.

> No SD Card slot

> Need I say more to drop the damn thing like a hot potato?

I don't disagree with you. Just saying that iphonex has a different set of hardware. Not "less" than any android flagship. And they managed to pack it in a form that's smaller than S9, which doesn't even have Samsung's top features.


S7 flat is substantially smaller than S9: https://www.phonearena.com/phones/size#/phones/size/Samsung-Galaxy-S9,Samsung-Galaxy-S7/phones/10716,9817

Why couldn't they have just kept the same size as S7 flat and decreased the bezels? Also, S7 was fully featured at this size. Except the battery size, it was identical to S7 edge. Now the S9 is substantially inferior to S9+ in features. 
Spoken like a dumb retard. My entire point is that Samsung's best should be available in a reasonable size like S9 and Iphonex. Not in a humongous S9+.
> It's fitting less into a smaller chassis.

Lolwut?! Can you tell me what iphone x is missing in terms of hardware?

- it has a top class amoled screen
- it has a freaking kinect built into the front
- it has the best haptic feedback
- it has a pressure sensing screen
- it has the best mobile CPU ever made
- it has the best mobile GPU ever made
- it has a top-class dual camera setup
- it has wireless charging

It lacks a headphone jack but you cannot say that it is packing less hardware, just a different set.

Yes, that's what. Iphone x is the best apple has to offer. Why is S9 not the best Samsung has to offer? Why doesn't it have 6gb of ram? Why doesn't it have 2 cameras? Why do I need to buy the humongous S9+ for that?
I think it is cheaper to build big phones. That's why Samsung et al are conspiring to make high end phones as big as possible. Look at iPhone x. They were able to fit all high end hardware inside a decent sized phone.
Oh I didn't know that it works only on some phones. What does that play store link tell you?
Because manufacturers are simply not making high end reasonably sized phones.
It's such an awesome phone but I wouldn't buy it. Just because it's so fucking big! The regular S9 is as big as my S7 edge, which was a massive phone when I bought it 2 years ago. And now to get the best features I have to buy S9+ which is as big as a note phone. This is an area where iPhone excels. The size of their best phone is still reasonable.

I don't think slowing down is always the safe option. What if it slows down in the middle of the autobahn? What if it stops in the middle of train tracks just to be "safe"? Autonomous cars need to act like a human would, in any scenario.
I'm sure Uber is doing the exact opposite of this.
By that logic any new thing is not a necessity. If you consider hundreds of deaths every day on the road, I think a point can be made that perfect universal autonomous vehicles are urgently needed.

They use combo iris and face for unlocking, not just face recognition.
I just want them to take a S7 flat and cut out the bezels. Don't stretch the ratio, don't curve the screen, just make the phone smaller.
Just because the ratio is common now does not mean it is not wrong. The point made by OP makes sense. They should have made the phone a bit smaller and had a 16:9 bezelless screen.

Doesn't seem to be correct. Even my 2 year old s7e with much inferior brightness becomes super-bright in sunlight. If you fiddle with the slider manually it doesn't go to the max possible. So try to leave it on auto and don't mess with the slider. It is impossible to reach the max manually.
Maybe because they spent $1000 on their phone.
That was just inefficient engineering though.

#Absolute unit.
Well we've both put our points across. No point arguing too much about it. It's quite irrelevant in the bigger scheme of things. Have a good day!
We just proved above that this feature in itself will produce better pictures, faster shutter times and, in some cases, better ISO. The difference is slight, but it is there. I'd call this innovation.

Mechanical failures on camera apertures are unheard of in normal usage scenarios. Unless you have evidence that Samsung's implementation is especially flaky, it's not an issue, even a potential hypothetical one.
So any feature that doesn't change your life is a marketing gimmick?
> crap attack

Does not sound fun.
Plot twist: It's the college who is applying for the loan from Gates.
Unless we know the other settings (shutter speed and ISO), we cannot really compare these. 
I see what you mean. But there *is* a small difference in brightness. It's not life-changing or anything, for sure. But a lens that can switch between 1.5 and 2.4 is still better than one that is fixed at 1.7. You can get slightly better low-light performance and more sharpness in good light. 
It's only available to Bill Gates.
Ubuntu on Windows 10, probably.

https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH4MSV6
Incorrect. The best answer says that shutter speed has increased in this particular case. Which is in itself a big gain for low-light. Also, depending on the exact condition the camera may modify the ISO too. Just that in this case it thought making the shutter slower was enough.

> It sounds likely that you are taking your image in very low light, where the shutter speed is slow enough in either case that the camera's auto-exposure program is choosing the higher ISO in either case. There are probably some situations where it might leave the shutter alone and lower ISO first. It depends on the situation, your camera, and the settings you've chosen.

> If you want the camera to do something outside of its program, you will need to take it out of auto mode, where, yes, you'll find that your faster lens lets you use about half the ISO at the same shutter speed. That's not a huge advantage — really, when you get to f/2.8 and faster, you kind of get diminishing returns for increasingly steep costs. If you are going to be using a tripod and don't care about exposure time, you're absolutely right that it isn't crucial to spend more for faster aperture alone.

> If you care about taking photos hand-held in low light, though, it really may be worth it, and the camera is probably doing the right thing for you. It's impossible to hold completely still, and having the shutter speed can make a big difference.

> But the faster lens may have some other advantages — it may have nicer rendering independent of exposure, be sharper stopped down, or have other features.

They're way overpriced for mediocre quality earphones. I don't care about the whole "market segment". 
Yes I am a complete noob. Please show me a comparison so I can understand.
Can you point me to a comparison between 1.5 and 1.7 mobile lens in low light conditions? If not then you're just talking out of your ass.
I'm not going to point anything to you. You're clearly a troll.
You're being disingenuous. 1.7 to 1.5 makes a lot of difference for low light conditions. And I think it was clear from my comment.
Actually notch has no purpose. It is an engineering failure.
But then every time you click auto update you have to manually say no for each app you have excluded with this method.
Not true. I think you are mistaking noise for detail. For example, zoom into the white rectangle in both photos.

It's quite true. iVerge has earned this reputation.
Are you serious? That's an insane range of aperture. He'll just going from 1.5 to 1.7 will give you a very different picture.
Equally difficult for both is more accurate.
That's not what the S9 has. S9 specifically triggers the 960fps mode when it detects movement in a user-set area. So you have a better chance of recording something good. Whereas in xperia if you mis-time the shutter pressing you lose the interesting moment.

Not at all. They are way overpriced.
I don't think it is there in S7. 
NFC pairing works awesome on Samsung phones with Sony or Samsung headsets. It's literally just a touch and you don't even have to turn on the headphone or anything.
Also try recording 4k video with Google upload turned on. Battery gets fucked.
Only $259.

$399 if you want both ears.
Also wired headsets of same quality are 10x cheaper and last longer due to not needing inbuilt batteries.

I believe this was the actual motto for some iPhone S version. Which changes nothing except minor spec bumps.

UV sensor? Where's that located?
For one, apple cannot design or manufacture screens as good as Samsung can.
Does this mean Samsung can sell Exynos unlocked phones in the USA with the caveat that you can't use it on Verizon? Qualcomm patents wouldn't apply if the phones don't support CDMA, right?
I like the simple square design. Very understated and classy. Now just figure out a way to make an under-screen selfie camera!
I know you're kidding but Samsung does have an iMessage clone. I was kind of surprised when I found out.
The non+ model is too fucking big. Is it so hard to make a bit smaller phone?
This demonstrates the fact that the Indian market does not give a fuck about quality. If given a choice to buy good quality product for ₹x, and buy chinese piece of shit for ₹(x-1), Indian consumer will always go for chinese shit. Not really surprising.
Not for Samsung phones.

Good bot.
Notification contains name of sender. Also many apps (whatsapp, skype) populate the system address book with their contacts. So it should be easy.
Repeat after me: there are no two parties. There are two brands.
What if they figured out a way to pump all that data into the main RAM? 6GB of RAM! That means 0.182*6*1024/128=8.736 seconds of 1000fps video. Still kind of shitty though.
Selective focus is really not up to the mark, at least on S7.

I'm curious. what did google perfect before dropping?

Bullshit. They need to port it to S7, can't wait to use it. The macro features sound awesome. I don't have much use for the stuff assistant/siri try to do. I can order pizza easily enough, voice search works fine from the browser, I don't have smart lights, etc. But being able to say "Goodnight Bixby" and setting the phone to do not disturb, while turning down brightness to minimum, that sounds awesomely useful.
No it hasn't. I just created it. Is that why?
For me it just keeps rotating after I enter my wallet address. Could it be something wrong with my wallet? I've never made any kind of crypto wallet before.
So by this logic we should have a burger-neutrality law. It would prevent any burger joint from making people wait if they don't pay extra.

No it doesn't. It's a Samsung panel. Apple didn't cheap out on their $1000 device, unlike google.
The screen on your phone isn't high quality enough to differentiate between the colors. It's called "crushing the blacks".
Same here. Can't wait.
> the last two iterations of the Galaxy and note series were a letdown in terms of camera upgrades

If true, I'm ready to be letdown in all other areas too. Seriously the cameras on every device since the S7 have been amazing.

My DV3's Nvidia card literally died from overheating. One day I booted Windows and the GPU was just gone. As if it never existed. I took it to HP service they told me the GPU had melted inside the laptop and quoted some ridiculous amount of money to replace it. They also blamed me for running it too hot! Never bought any HP product after that.
It's not a gain. HP has a huge number of people working for them. A lot of them are software developers, with a lot of layers of management. They have to justify their existence. So they keep pushing crap like this. 
Lol, that's rich coming from the designer of a phone that looks 5 years old!
So is there a way to remap it? Google assistant is a waste for me. I'd rather have it turn on the flashlight or something.
Batman is the best by far.
Then how will you tell the elevator where you want to go?

But if the screen in a pixel is bad, you blame LG.
But you cannot send money to a debit card, right? Whereas you can send money to a ledger. So where is the money actually going?

Same here for all the other crap google forces (drive, play magazines, play tv, assistant, etc.). I hate companies forcing apps on me, even google.
Sometimes I'll dismiss the notification, start my commute from work. Just driving, not using maps. And sometimes when I'm stopped at a traffic light, new notification about how long it will take to reach home from *here*. Kind of helpful sometimes but usually irritating.

I'll try when I get some time. It's very disruptive to change a launcher!

I don't have an answer for this.

> It is ip68 waterproofed. 

I think the fact that you don't even know the specs of the phone you spent a lot of money on tells me everything about who is buying pixels. Won't bother reading further.
> What is the pixel 2 missing?

Decent screen, decent VR, headphone jack, stable wifi, stable bluetooth, decent design, wireless charging, fast wireless charging, ip68 waterproofing, replaceable battery, micro sd slot, dual sim, pro mode in camera... should i go on?
Not at all. The screen is shit, for starters.
> Both are $159, yet google thinks they can do Apple prices with half the features.

It worked for pixel so I can't really fault them.
> Apple manufactures their iPhone products for under $300. Why should they be profiting 300%

The selling price of stuff like cellphones is not at all dependant on the bill of materials. It's a fallacy to think like that. It's dependant on what people are willing to pay.
Also I'd like a continuous mode unlike sony which only works for milliseconds.
I must say fb is right on this one. I can't see wide adoption of stuff like rift or vive. Nobody wants to build a $3000 custom rig just to get tethered to your room. GearVR, if it can let you move around in the world, would be a game changer.
Bullshit like this is exactly why Huawei needs to be ignored by non-Chinese people. 
I use Gogole play because Spotify isn't available in India, and iMusic is just horrible for android and windows. I tried to use it, paid the subscription for a few months, but the software is just utter crap. Not to say play music is perfect, but it is 100x better than iMusic. Also used to use Spotify using my office network (Spotify thinks I'm in Houston if I use my office WiFi), but then I still couldn't subscribe to premium (needs US credit card). So play music it is. The app and service are great, but the music discovery stuff is just lacking, compared to spotify.
My wallet is waiting Samsung, release the S9 already!
There's a lot of difference between an HTC mid-range phone and one from Samsung. In fact I'd argue the A8 is a better phone than any HTC phone ever made. Maybe that's why there's a "double standard".

> There's no way that they fitted a mechanism that mechanicly opens the aperture blades in that small space.

I think they already did that in a flip (!) phone.

S7 doesn't have any RAM problems unless you do crazy ridiculous stuff like open 5 different 1GB games one after the other.
64GB is too less. 128GB should be standard.
USA guarantees freedom for American citizens. Not chinese companies.
I see no hypocrisy at all. The US government has one job: protect interests of Americans. To do that, they will ban every Chinese company that seems to be gaining any kind of traction in the domestic market. No hypocrisy.

You can install it from play store on your computer I think. But yeah you would have to set it up first.
Can you connect a regular keyboard to the USB port and try?
No no apparently American corps should compete while everyone else just leeches off government money. If you pit the fucking government with all its money and power against any company of course the company will lose.

China forces apple and Google and Microsoft to commit massive human rights violations to let them participate. And the US government is just supposed to open up he entire market to every random child-labour supported manufacturer, who also give the entire data on American users to the Chinese government?
China has banned entire Google, Facebook, Skype etc and USA bans one manufacturer and it's hypocrisy? Fucking hilarious.
This is the biggest issue IMO. I think most versions of the feed and now app have been good enough. Just that I cannot rely on anything to stay the same for more than 2 months. I started using the parking feature. It was awesome. Then gone. So now I just turn it off. No disappointments.

S8 works like that because they have a pressure sensor under the screen. Unless they can cram the fingerprint sensor and a pressure sensor both in the same location below the screen, I don't see how it could work while screen is off.

> it points to an ISA implementation bug

If that's true, why not just check for "Intel" and enable the patch, since ISA implementation must be vastly different among vendors? IMO the bug must be something fundamental about x86 and AMD has avoided it with a lucky implementation detail. That's why the patch is enabled on all x86 CPUs. 
By default they assume all x86 CPUs are vulnerable and they will apply exceptions as they are verified. This too points towards a huge general architectural bug.
There is nothing new that it brings to the market. Every new phone has something unique. What's unique about essential? And I mean something good. For example pixel has an amazing camera, even though it may be lacking in other things like headphone jack, it still has a unique experience to offer. iPhone x has face 3d scanning. Galaxy Note8 has a nice pen. Razer has a 120Hz screen.

Remind me why this is black mirror?? There is no tech dystopia or anything like that. Just this woman who has lost all sense of right and wrong apparently.
I don't buy it. This is a standard dramatic shot. Show the main character in stress by showing a reflection of his/her eyes in the car rear view mirror.

No it doesn't once you factor in the cost of your time and the difference in the price of lithium batery and coin cell. Unless you're earning less than a hobo. Then your time would be cheap enough.
Coin cells are literally cheaper than a few cents.
Why? Is recharging every month better than replacing a cheap cell once a year?
Not being shipped with iOS.
No, pixel 2 xl is known to be using the cheapest components. Those are usually the least efficient. So the results are exactly what was expected.
Swapping battery takes less than 15 minutes and you have to do it only once a year. Compare that to recharging once a month for 15 minutes.
Can it last for a year though?
Still much worse than a watch battery so I don't know what's your point.
Still 12x worse as a watch battery.
How long does the miband battery last? This one here lasts for a year. I'd take this over recharging every few days. After a year, a quick battery swap and you're good for another year.
What else would you expect? Reset generally means all changes you made to the phone will be wiped.
I'm out of the loop on this one. Can someone explain please?
I did this. I imagined myself running along, a bird flying along, and even a cheetah. Weird that this is a common thought!

Try a regular headphone. Apple earphones sometimes don't work because of different pin layout.
Thanks, will check out.
I can try but I'm not good with this stuff and I'm scared of messing it up beyond hope. I'll probably plan a trip to SP Road. Thanks.
If there is an internal flywheel in the bullet that can be spun up and down at a certain time, the bullet can change orientation in mid air. The change can cause a trajectory change due to the interaction with the air. It's possible, right?
There is no focussing mechanism in the front camera.
I'm also fed up of ACT. Every few weeks it goes down for 3-4 days. I don't know how to get their attention to fix whatever base issue exists. They just lodge a complaint then fix it in a couple of days. Airtel used to be expensive but the service was much better.
While your point is correct, I doubt this will have any real effect on the decision.
My S7e performs as well as it did the first day. I bought it right at the launch, too. So it has been a lot more than a year. Battery life has significantly gone down though.
What country are you talking about? Certainly not India.
It's kind of useless. I don't see much of a point. It's like apple's force touch shortcuts. Neat but useless in practice.

I'll upgrade my S7e to an S9. 2 years is a nice cycle for me. 
Agreed. 2.5mm is worst of both worlds.
> ARCore is coming to lots more Android devices.

Real Soon Now^TM
2.5mm is as bad as USB c. It offers no benefits to the user over 3.5 and presents a significant obstacle.
Of course it has lost. AR kit is on the best selling phone people are actually buying. AR core is on some mediocre also-ran Pixel that nobody even knows about, let alone buy.
Take it again in a blue light condition, and compare the GS8 screen with itself. People have remarked that the degree to which the color is varied is less in Galaxy phones compared to iphone. So both are adjusting the screen, but iphone is adjusting it by a greater degree. 
What?! Have I missed something?? I thought the whole allure of android one was that it will be well updated because google is in charge of the software?

No, if the display is set to adaptive (default setting), it changes color based on ambient light.

Already works like that on Galaxy phones.

What if there are 2 cameras and the fingerprinter is under the screen!? It would be an awesome troll.
This is a toggle for Samsung phones. Settings->Display->Keep screen turned off in pocket. Just FYI.
My headphone starts up and connects when I touch my phone on the right speaker. It takes the whole pain out of bluetooth pairing and turning on and connecting.
One time I dropped my S7e into a pool and it took almost 24 hours for the moisture warning to go away.
Samsung just add the under-screen fingerprinter and it will be an insta-buy for me!
That's not true. My S7 sends them to a folder called screenshots.
Maybe that's because the echos are genuinely much more useful.

I need more leaks to get hype!
Maybe, sorry.
Probably because they wanted to include phones that were relevant to the actual market?
Whatever is the cause of the problem is irrelevant. Bottom line is that it's a shitty phone.
Oh I forgot they're a "[camera company](https://investor.snap.com/company-profile)".
It replicates the best parts though. And Instagram pics are so much nicer to look at. It seems everyone tries to put only good looking stuff on instagram. 
No snapchat's trouble is that their initial idea is easily copyable and they didn't bother to innovate further.

As long as people are ready to argue logically and not resort to name-calling, I am ok. But reddit has been totally stupid about it. 

As far as I can see, before net neutrality was enacted in 2014/15, the internet was completely fine. Things were working. Net neutrality imposed extra regulations of the industry. On principle I'm opposed to regulation where not needed. So I don't see a problem with returning to that pre-2014 state of minimal regulation.
I know I didn't. So no danger of that happening. Don't worry.

I don't get all the Prius hate! It's a good car!
I think it was justified too. Netflix produces a huge amount of data. Why should they not be charged extra?
It's exactly the same situation. Why do you think we all are still on reddit and haven't gone over to one of the multiple clones? Because there cab only be one reddit at a time. Others are simply not popular enough. Same is applicable for websites like Facebook and YouTube. If you are actually going for an unbiased internet, then reddit shouldn't be able to block me or downvotes me. YouTube shouldn't be allowed to block my account or remove advertising from my videos based on content.

As a consumer, I have zero reasons to buy this phone over others. Literally nothing that it offers is not available in a better phone from a reputable company. I really don't see why anybody would invest 1$ in this company. There is *nothing* new or innovative.

Just saying it's technically not a carrier feature. If they want, they can easily support volte on all phones across all carriers. No new hardware or software needed. Everything is built in to the phone.
Chrome is slow af compared to other browsers on android. That is a good reason to switch.
> carrier features like VoLTE

Just want to say that volte is not a carrier feature. In India, we always buy unlocked phones. And any phone bought from anywhere works with volte, on any network that offers it.
Maybe because chrome is a piece of shit?

They say S8 should have much less battery degradation. Dunno how true it is.

Loading time is a big problem for all UWP apps. Wonder if they care. One of my friend works for Microsoft and they all have insanely powerful dev machines. They never experience the slow load times. Maybe that's why so many UWP apps are slow to load and Microsoft hasn't noticed it.
It's a system app. Try doing the same thing on iOS and see how successful you are. 
You can change the last operator just by entering a new one, right? But you're right that the text field should act like a normal text field and keep accepting input until you actually click =.
Calculator is one of the few modern apps I like. For me copy paste works normally. What is it about it that you don't like?
For me the search has gotten much improved in the latest builds.
Why is teams terrible? It looks very good. Waiting for my company to enable it for everyone.
I think the UWP app has caught up and surpassed the older app. There are a few glitches but they are rare. For the most part this is a better app than the atrocity we've been using for years.
Not to mention the build materials and colors were awesome. So different from the shiny iPods.
Another fun moment is when you have a modern app on one virtual desktop and switch from another desktop to this one. You'll see a blank page first and then content will fill up. It just breaks the entire animation feel. Sometimes the same windows will show up in another desktop for a split second.

Also try to right click on the address bar in edge. The copy paste menu takes literally a second to open. Every single time.
Telegram and imessage also have proper desktop clients. Is there any hope for that?

You can make the keyboard just small enough from the sides so it doesn't appear at all on the curves. That helped improve my typing a lot. However finally I installed gboard and the autocorrect is wonderful. I make mistakes in almost every sentence but it takes care of it. Sometimes it will even go back a few words and correct it if it thinks my current word doesn't match with what I typed a few words ago.
Can you post some samples? Also post an image of the same scene with another camera you think is working fine. Otherwise we won't know how it should look like.
Noticed it with gboard.
There is negligible improvement for quite a bit of hardwork. No need to bother with it if you're satisfied with the camera.

You sign a contract with the devil when you buy an android phone. In this case, the devil is google. And instead of your soul, you've sold them your entire living life. Given this, I am not surprised that Google is not bothered by such things as pointed out in the article.
What a fucking mess.
Found the screen to be used in pixel 3.
Again, it's irrelevant what your personal preference is. Because it is just that, a preference. 
OK, but we're talking about "best" phone, not smoothest phone.
It's a tautology.
I see the pause on mine too. Wasn't an issue before nougat. Also many more apps were supported.

All Android updates have only brought sorrow to me. The biggest fail was when Samsung multi window was replaced with the buggy inferior mess that Google has implemented.

Are those disney ads gone in the new google homes? Also, get it in your heads people: Google is an advertising company. That's their job. If you buy anything from google, expect your private data to be mined and expect to be shown ads.

> Says it’s the best phone he’s used so far. 

If a caveman uses a Nokia 1100 he will think it's the best phone ever too. Just saying that this argument does not tell us anything about the phone's quality. You must compare it against other flagships.
In my opinion, if the buses are not clean enough let's focus on fixing that. Instead of every one of us going to office in our own cars. This type of thinking has led to the current state, where it takes 1 hour to go 10 km. 

PS: I travel by bus every day and I think they are quite clean by Indian standards.
You're right. These people are really poor, I also feel bad that they have to struggle for a small amount of money.
Stop using Paytm for uber and complain to uber telling them to refund your cancellation charge because cab guy was at fault. They usually agree after seeing location logs and all.
This is the best advice. Always take an uber. If it's expensive or maybe cabs are not available take an auto but don't haggle. I just walk off after saying no. And hail another one. But fighting just spoils the mood. And fighting over 20-30 ₹ is just a waste.

I'm not surprised. Google has developed Android for the sole purpose of collecting your data. Why would they *ever* let you disable it? Remember, you are not the customer if you're not paying.
> I just told you that we've had a data transfer solution that “even copies my wifi passwords”

I just told you we've had a data transfer solution that copies every single thing *including* wifi passwords. Plus everything op said and more. 

> You're generalizing Android as Samsung. LG devices didn't have this even last year, I don't know if their new devices have it, but it didn't last year. That's an Android device.

OK, let me rephrase it. Every damn fucking flagship worth the fucking money they ask for it has had this feature standard. Happy now?

> Nobody said it was new, OP said it was convenient and hopes it becomes a general thing, which unless LG just added this recently, it's not a general thing.

OP seemed pleasantly surprised. I just want to say that he shouldn't have been. All of this has been available for years now.

> Also, according to the description of Samsung's Smart Switch app, the oldest phone of theirs that it supports is the S7 which came out March last year. That doesn't sound like two years...

Oh pardon me 1 year and 9 months. You got me.
Yes and I'm telling you that's not new. Wired transfer has existed for Android phones for more than 2 years now. It's sad that you guys are thinking this super-old feature is something new. But as I said, I'm glad more people are able to use this well-established feature now.
I get it, you didn't have any actual argument.
> The data transfer tool was great. I just hooked up the USB C cable between the two phones as prompted, and it basically copied all the apps and data straight over in a few minutes. I wonder if this tool will become a general use thing, because it seems pretty slick.

This is already standard. Switched from my S4 to S7e just like this. It even copied my wifi passwords. Glad that more phones have it now.

> The screen seems great to my eye. I know it's the XL that's had all the various problems, but the regular screen here seems noticeably brighter and more vivid than the Nexus 5x.

Yeah it's great, because Google actually used a good Samsung screen for the regular pixel 2.
Can't compare pixel to a galaxy phone. Galaxy does way more stuff, so it is logical that it needs more hardware.
Yeah they make sure not to add too many things at once. Otherwise they can't charge for every single feature separately. 
NN has nothing to do with privacy.

Guess that makes it OK.

I mean you paid ~$1000 for a phone with a shitty screen and no headphone jack. I can see why you would want the opposite of what normal consumers want.
Are you kidding? 
🖖
The truth is most people don't need a "real computer". They need a Facebook machine. And an iPad is more than adequate for that.
Nice! My point is that this is a 3 year old feature. It wasn't made simple for apple converts, it was just copying what Samsung already did years ago. But copying is good, glad that you had a good experience!
Not a big deal at all for a phone whose single selling point is fast updates. I mean people sacrificed screen quality, headphone jack, analog audio, etc. and paid $1000 just because they expected fast updates lol!
Courage.
> It even transferred all of the WiFi networks I know and messages I have

Is that a new thing? I remember this happening automatically when I switched from my S4 about 2 years ago. Well, better late than never.

LOL! Couldn't have put it better myself.
You're mostly right. Google cares about one thing: data. They will do anything that gets them more data. If the customer benefits while they collect his life history, good enough! The problem with pixel phones is that they don't give google much more data than any other android phone. So expect shitty components, shitty service and general lack of features. They do not care. They are getting your data, and if you get irritated and switch, they still get your data!

Can somebody try this with computer memory instead of paper? Let me try:

One decimal character needs 4 bits to store or 1/2 byte. The number of digits is 10^120 . So it needs 5 x 10^119 bytes. The largest capacity micro SD card can hold 400GB. The volume of a microSD card is 1.65 x 10^-7 m^3. The number of cards needed to hold 5 x 10^119 bytes is 1.25 x 10^108. The volume of the observable universe is 4 x 10^80 m^3. So our universe can hold 2.4 x 10^87 microSD cards. 

It will take 5.2 x 10^20 universes to hold the number in microSD cards. 
I'll instantly buy that.

Yup, I think it'll be time for my S7 to retire!
Doesn't explain why it keeps changing randomly.
You just bought a new phone (that's why you have this problem). So just return it and get a non-shit one. No extra charge needed. Instead you will save money (because the better phone will cost < $1000).
Can somebody with Note8 or S8 test if Bixby supports spotify?
You're an idiot if you think the quality depends only on codecs. The most important part is the quality of the headphone drivers and circuitry. And to get a good quality earphone that has bluetooth, you need to pay 2-3x more than wired earphones with the same quality.
Most frugal solution to this "problem": get a better phone.
With all the flagships (except Note8) removing useful features and charging massive bux, OP5 is probably the best choice right now. Fully featured, no bullshit software, good quality hardware (unlike Pixel), better battery life (as shown here) and even affordable price. If you have money to spare, you can go for Note8, you'll get some nice extra features (s-pen, waterproof screen, better screen, better cameras, gear vr. But all these are not essential to a great smartphone.
Ice cooled setup, I assume.
Yeah the milkshake was good and large too. Burger tasted good but too small for the price. 

Edit: I'm in India. And this place is newly opened. 
Yeah first time. Is it well known?
0 to Mach 4 in 2 minutes.
Whatsapp will probably start using server time and squash this entire class of bugs.
Yeah I was expecting a much better burger looking at the price. But at least it tasted good.
Yup lol! Should have taken a pic of that too!
No it doesn't. Samsung OLED is not susceptible in timeframes like this.
Antenna gate was not design philosophy. It was bad parts. The antenna portion was supposed to be shielded. Foxconn didn't do it and apple didn't catch it. Exactly the same as this screen in the Google pixel phone.
Sirius Black.
So would expect users to blame Foxconn for the "you're holding it wrong" debacle?
Working fine for me
Then how do they flash it at the factory?
Specially since removing the OS saves so much space! They can put all the magic machine learning pixies inside it now!
Drop meteorite and start again ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Ummm... Are you being sarcastic?
Both pics have slightly different colour ಠ_ಠ
About your decision to buy a turd of a phone.
I think you got the wrong post.
Because it doesn't happen on those.
It's been there for about 2 years now. Very awesome.
Well *you* bought it. So lol.
Apple sells the iphones to retailers at MSRP. Do you want BB to sell it for a loss?
For me all of the points as must haves. Probably because my current 2 year old phone satisfies al of them except 1. So I don't wanna downgrade.
Fast wireless charging is pretty fast. Not slow at all.
I meant to say that in these times of economic hardship it is unwise to invite millions of people who are poorer than the poorest people in the country.
Then why isn't it there on mine?
No I don't have this issue in my S7e.
It's like Microsoft *wants* UWP to fail.
I hope something nuclear happens. Always wanted to see the effects of nuclear fallout.
Ah! I was thinking the IR camera would allow it to scan your iris without any visible light at all.
No lag or delay on the share menu here. Maybe it's a problem with your phone.
No. Headphone jack or fuck off. I'm not carrying stupid dongles around. End of story.
Fucking lol. My condolences to the tools who paid $1000 for this shit.
Is there anything new at all?
And not to mention all of that works on any Android phone! Headphone jack is on top of that.
Isn't the iris scanner supposed to work in the dark?
You seem really upset about somebody else's reddit comments.
But the xl is out of the question because for the price and the quality of components.
Yeah they really didn't push anything to the max in this phone. Every single thing is underwhelming. From small battery to huge bezels to the missing headphone jack. To be honest this tethering thing is useless for me. When I create a hotspot I don't see much battery drain anyway. It doesn't make sense to optimise such a rare case which already works well.
It won't start or end anything. This is a super niche device that will sell even less units than pixel phones. Kind of like essential, maybe a bit more. At these numbers you're not a trendsetter.
Nobody at Google looked at the pic. The same pic will go to multiple people over some time and their answers will validate each other and also train the AI monster Google is creating.
Although very clunky, I use RDP to connect and copy paste files out. Works every time.
You can click uninstall and windows will reinstall a generic driver that's pretty much guaranteed to work. Although it may be missing some features specific to your hardware.
I recall that push notifications used to work before on sync. Before there was any official app. Did reddit purposely sabotage that?

Use the home button instead of back.
Go near the access point and try. I can only think of physical damage to the WiFi antennas that can cause this.
#Refugees welcome.
To be honest, only V30 and Note8 are the true flagships of this year. No compromises, most features, best everything. All else are just fluff.
Nothing because op knows that OP5 is superior in every way. Nobody is gonna pay a quarter of what OP5 costs, for an essential phone.
What about headphone jack updates?
> Care to explain why? What's ugly about it? The logo (I agree the razer logo is shit and they should've gone with their text one instead), the body? The materials?


The bezels.
100%
Gboard is better than SwiftKey.
You are right that the brick itself contains the logic to do the fast charging. But some USB cables are too thin internally. So they cannot handle the extra current. In that case your brick and phone will detect that and switch to slow charging.
If I was playing an audio CD in the windows disc player and shut down the system, it would keep playing the CD even after it reached that "You can safely turn off your computer" screen. To this day I don't know how that's possible.
Exactly. Talk shit get hit. Too many people avoid confronting somebody who has deliberately done something wrong and won't own up or shift blame. I'd love to work with Linus. I wish my co-workers we're like him.
I'd love to work with people who don't hesitate to voice their honest opinion. And I'd love to see people chewed out for being deceptive. 
Don't the usual justifications for being gay also equally apply to incest? So if being gay is fine and not trashy, the same should be true of incest.
See, there is no argument against "you're lying!".
A 13 year old kissing and not getting a boner would be weird.
> panned out

Not at all! Video out of a software stabilized camera is worse than what people get from OIS cameras. Many comparisons between pixel and others on youtube show that the video is not as well stabilized on pixel.

> working well

Oh really? So it's outputting lossless zoomed images like iphone or note8? Working well means nothing if you compare different things. A 10 year old nokia 1100 also worked very well. Doesn't mean it's a better device than a note8.

>  I'm just saying that they've shown a willingness to update the settings with more profiles based on feedback so who knows what this screen will look like in a couple months.

I'm just saying that 10 different new color profiles will not change the fact that the screen is inherently inaccurate and bad. They cannot make people care about color spaces with this screen, period. There is no play. There is no grand scheme. They just don't care about user experience.
I gave it a shot. No burn in, good as new. Of course now you'll say I'm also lying. That argument certainly is bulletproof.
As I commented in [another comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/79zwch/ive_permanently_damaged_my_pixel_2_xl_screen_via/dp6iks6/), I could not find any study or anything about this, but months of continuous screen use at max brightness is the common case when burn-in occurs. If you know of a proven study that tells us the number of hours of continued use before burn-in occurs on a proper OLED (last 3 years Samsung), please do share. Otherwise the reality is very clear: 3 days should not be nearly enough to cause easily visible burn-in or image retention or whatever you want to call it on a 2017 flagship that costs almost $1000.
Even if he did that the phone should last for months without showing burn in.
Well he said 3 days. Do you think OP is lying?
Setting a black and white wallpaper is not the same as drop testing. Be logical.
A lot of people have cards here. Almost every bank account holder has a debit card. And almost everybody has a bank account. I think it's a big market.
Months of continued use at maximum brightness. Not normal usage. Normal usage will last years.
I don't think this is conclusive proof but still informative: https://forums.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s7-edge/670083-how-bad-amoled-screen-burn-problem.html

> For instance, the Galaxy S6 edge store units I've seen have suffered from pretty bad burn-in after a **year** of service, as they're powered on for almost the **entire day at maximum brightness without the screen going to sleep**.

I couldn't find a proper study or anything, but this seems to be consistent of most opinions I could find. Not proof, but I am willing to believe that burn-in is indeed measured in months of continuous use, not days. 
So they'll replace the burned-in screen with a new one? Highly unlikely. And if they will, then that means burning it in more doesn't matter.
Does it work at cash counters like android pay? It seems like a generic UPI app to me.
What's not moral is enabling them to hide this defect from future users.
I agree, but that doesn't mean I can't complain about it! It's a shitty practice and I won't support it. People bought tens of millions of iphones without headphone jack and it looks like I will have to suffer due to that when other manufacturers start doing that. It reduces my choice and increases prices for me.
He shouldn't be able to do this in a couple of days. That's my point.
You connect to your shield tv over bluetooth?
The disable is more than regular disable. It literally just leaves an 8kb stub. That's more like a shortcut.
It's probably using AMP. You can't do anything about that. Google's cancer is really hard to avoid.
Just search Samsung sync in the Chrome Web store.
This is the first thing to install on any Samsung phone.
Hope you're using ublock origin and not ublock.
You can install a Samsung sync extension from the chrome store. It will sync your chrome tabs and history with the mobile browser.
100x this. Why does Samsung need to do this shit?
The performance. The features like night mode, reading view, add-ons, video player, Samsung pass, etc.
The ones that silently mine Bitcoin?
Fuck ads and advertisers.
If you have a galaxy, another option is to use something like adhell. It will do system wide ad blocking. No need to install add-on for the browser.
Make sure to fuck up the screen real bad before returning. They shouldn't be able to sell this shit for $1000.
Brave OP.
Not a chance. It literally takes months of continued screen time on proper OLEDs.
Meanwhile not a peep in India.
Oneplus gives ample storage so not including sd card is not a big deal. But apple charging $200 to go from 32GB to 128GB is just a cash grab.
I really don't think that happens, unless you overclock or drive the chip beyond it's specs. Which is not the case here.
Maybe use Bixby lol.
I used Apple music on Android for about 3 months. The music library was awesome but the app is just horrible. Switched to Google play. It syncs my library from my laptop too.
The basic mode on galaxy phones is already more accurate than sRGB on pixel 2. So I don't know how Google is making any case for "color space". By having a less accurate display?
Of course it's not unusable. People even managed to use monochrome screen phones just fine.
I've done it. No bad effects.
I don't like Google photo sharing at all. You cannot download a bunch of pics! You can share or something. But no batch download.
Yeah convince them when it has more features. That's gonna work.
Fuck gestures. They are non intuitive and hidden. Buttons are always better. Labelled buttons are even better.
The main reason is $$$.
Google users are not us. Their customers are advertisers.
I doubt you can "wear out" a CPU.
Can't you hold the function key and try?
This is probably the most likely situation.
Kind of suspect survey. I would have thought Karnataka to be one of the least corrupt.
Terror attacks are part and parcel of living in a big city.
What is this tool? Why is it needed apart from the built in OTA?
