Darnold is nowhere near ready. McCown is a far better option for this year.
McCarron starts in Buffalo. I don't think it's a question until 2019.
Callaway/Coleman will technically be the third option, but they'll play outside at WR2. They're Z receivers while Landry is a slot.
Costs more than the entire park at DAEdar Point. Gotta be a great ride but I can't convince dad to let me ride it.
So I live in NE Ohio, with Cedar Point as my home park, and have only ever been there and to Geauga Lake (RIP). I plan on hitting Cedar Point several times this summer, and got to thinking if it wouldn't be worth it to get a Platinum Pass so I'd get admission to every CF park. Basically my plan is to potentially take ten days to go to all the closest CF parks: CP, Michigan's Adventure, Canada's Wonderland, Dorney Park, Kings Dominion, Carowinds, and Kings Island. 

First: are all those parks worth it? MA and Dorney seem to get the worst reviews, but Dorney is very much along the way and MA has a very highly acclaimed woodie in Shivering Timbers - opinions on value relative to the drive time?

Second: what are the must-ride, must-do, must-eat, etc attractions at each park? I'm not in this for credits specifically, so if there are rides that are just plain bad or boring, I'd rather not waste my time as I'll only be spending one day at each park if I do pull the trigger on this. At the same time, I'm not too worried about painful or rough rides, so I'd prefer you didn't advise me against all the Vekomas or old woodens. 

Thanks to anybody who has advice!
I guarantee you Baker Mayfield will never see this subreddit or will page.
For anybody else who wants to add to The List: /r/bakerslist is keeping track so Baker doesn't have to!
Nope nope nope. No redditors or otherwise private figures will be put on the List.
This isn't for legitimate criticisms really. It's for things like criticizing a shitty first pitch.
It's intended as a joke. I hope I set the tone with my opening post - an article written by a golf columnist about Baker's first pitch. Nothing serious at all.
No idea. Maybe bots crawling a new subreddit?
Nope, but I'm thinking I'll make a wiki page with all the detractors on it.
It was more the history, without getting into specifics.
All numbers are the official combine numbers. "Playing weight" numbers are all reported by the player and are inaccurate.
This team has a coach who is \*very well respected around the league as a leader and this team \*has no serious problems anymore.
I think Collins was, then when he got injured, it went to Joe. I would have chosen Kirksey to be captain after Collins, tbh.
35?... I got 80 hours for a speeding ticket. What the fuck.
Considering he's one of the best run stopping ends in the game, that's patently ridiculous.
That's been a thing since at least 08. Take a bad LB, move him to DE, watch his overall jump 20 points. I stopped paying attention to overall and looking for specific ratings and traits I want in a player for a position or role.
I don't think anybody can properly evaluate OL players unless they have ample time to watch film. Pro scouts get paid to do just that. I have faith :)
Those guys are almost all better than Chubb. Chubb is Ogbah's identical twin - stellar run stopper, mediocre at best pass rusher. We needed a rotational pass rusher.
Me too in hindsight. Clearly NFL GMs weren't as high on Josh Jackson, Harold Landry, Derrius Guice, and especially Mo Hurst as I was. When there's an enormous discrepancy between my rankings and the NFL's draft order, I tend to trust the NFL GMs to know what they're doing more than I trust myself.
Not to mention the statements from the Giants ("with the board falling the way it did, Barkley was the only choice") and Jets ("Darnold was up there" on hierarchy of QBs) seemed to very firmly not place Barkley and Darnold as the top players on their boards.
/r/steelers is that way. Go fuck yourself over there so we don't have to watch over here.
Sean fucking Taylor.
Let's take a look at the top 5 QBs' BMI, shall we?

Josh Rosen: 27.5

Sam Darnold: 27.6

Lamar Jackson: 27.7

Josh Allen: 28.1

Baker Mayfield: 28.4

Conclusion: Baker is more T H I C C than even Josh Allen. He can take a damn hit.
Sashi was sealed too, to the point where there were Trubisky rumors on draft day.
He's got much more in common with Brees :)
Baker sighs. "I've only chosen one number since high school."
Check service maps and change providers if one covers better than your existing?
Yeah that's custom. OP wanted it to look like that.
It does help the poor when the rich aren't allowed to exploit them.
I'd say to knock on wood, but there doesn't seem to be much in the RMC arena.
Hey fellow Summit enthusiast!
A healthy Coleman on top of that... Mmf.
Quarterbacking singlehandedly lost us seven games last year alone.
Facts:

Corey Coleman is a good wide receiver and second option when healthy, and his injuries aren't soft tissue injuries and as such aren't chronic. 

Joe Schobert is a Pro Bowler. 

Derrick Kindred is a very strong backup with the ability to be a spot starter and rotational run defender.
Lmao that's exactly what the winner did: five top 10 picks, one more taken in the first, and the remaining two taken in the second.
Hahahahahahaha I am smart draft analyst
Heh.
That's not what he said. 

>If 99 percent of all the new income goes to the top 1 percent, you could triple it, it wouldn't matter much to the average middle class person. The whole size of the economy and the GDP doesn't matter if people continue to work longer hours for low wages and you have 45 million people living in poverty. You can't just continue growth for the sake of growth in a world in which we are struggling with climate change and all kinds of environmental problems. All right?Â You don't necessarily need a choice of 23 underarm spray deodorants or of 18 different pairs of sneakers when children are hungry in this country.

This is his SpongeBob mocking meme of people who respond to redistribution of national income with "but muh innovation and growth". Sanders was saying he'd gladly cut poverty and inequality even if it meant a reduction in superficial product "innovation".
Yeah the Giants said that with Baker off the board, Barkley was the only option, implying that they would have seriously considered Baker. The Jets refused to say that Darnold was the top QB on their board, instead saying he was "up there", implying that the top QB on their board was no longer available. There's zero chance Baker fell to 4.
I thought you hated literally every pick just yesterday?
I'm more concerned with Guice's apparent lack of drive. They say he wasn't committed in college, and the Skins don't seem like the team to turn that around.

Meanwhile a healthy Chubb is the best running back in the draft.
The Bucs wanted Ward. The Broncos wanted Ward. We wanted Ward. The trade offers weren't good enough to justify giving up Ward. So we stayed put and took Ward.
Even Brees was a second rounder, and Wilson was a third rounder.
Kirksey has been better in coverage than against the run every season but last year.
Gaines, Carrie, BBC, and Mitchell is a solid top 4 without even considering the developmental players Ward and Wilson who have never played an NFL snap. 

Randall is a question mark, but he was the top FS in his class and believes he is a better FS than CB. 

DT is covered with Ogunjobi, Brantley, Coley, and even Meder. Not ideal, but not bad. 

DE we have Garrett and Ogbah, clearly, but we also have Chris Smith, Orchard, Nassib, and of course Chad Thomas. There's some good players in that rotation.
Especially if you look at the draft through the lens of expected value. You expect a starter from the first two rounds, strong backups from the third and fourth, and role/depth/ST players from the last three rounds. 

#Expected starters:

Corey Coleman - a solid WR2 when healthy, and suffered from multiple injuries, none of which was soft tissue. **Equal value**. 

Emmanuel Ogbah - one of the best run defending EDGE players in the league. His absence last year hurt the defense more than anything else did. **Positive value**. 

#Expected strong backups:

Carl Nassib - doesn't excel rushing the passer, stiff, not a great run defender, lacks requisite strength. **Negative value**. 

Shon Coleman - Solid starter at RT, moving to natural position. **Positive value**. 

Cody Kessler - I'd call him a strong backup. Doesn't lose games, conservative, doesn't take chances. Won't be starting quality, lacks arm strength, pocket presence, and poise among others. **Equal value**. 

Joe Schobert - Pro Bowler. **Positive value**. 

Ricardo Louis - good ST player, reasonable fourth WR. **Equal value**. 

Derrick Kindred - stellar backup SS who can start in a pinch. **Positive value**. 

Seth DeValve - see Kindred. **Positive value**. 

#Expected role/depth/ST players

Jordan Payton - couldn't make the team. **Negative value**. 

Spencer Drango - stellar swing depth with spot starter ability. **Positive value**. 

Rashard Higgins - good slot backup, decent ST player. **Positive value**. 

Trey Caldwell, Scooby Wright - couldn't make the team. **Negative value**.
T H I C C
Nah he's just a pessimistic idiot who thinks that any player who he wasn't high on is a bust. Since the Browns didn't take anybody he was high on, he's just pissing in the subreddit about how we can't be good because we weren't good in the past.
So a reverse Geno Smith?
>I was against them taking two QBs....until they took Baker

Who has such a diverse game it's almost like we drafted two. I understand you.
Yep. You go get your fucking guy. QB prospects aren't interchangeable.
>Mayfield was damn near a consensus top\-5 pick.

Not only that but McVeigh said if he didn't have his ride-or-die he'd sell the farm for Baker, and Bowles heavily implied that Darnold wasn't the top QB on the Jets board but was instead "up there".
Quit your pessimism, we don't need more Ls.
And I can call myself an eggplant parmesan. Doesn't make me one.
I always preferred it aesthetically, didn't have a computer until I was 10 and the habit was engrained before that.
Yeah they're not going to fix it for free. They let you know what the issue is, then if you ask they'll recommend parts to fix it, or you can take it to your mechanic and tell them what the code is.
It's by county in Ohio. Summit does emissions checks, Stark doesn't. Happily, e-check is free. 

What I really want is the ultimate goal of Cash 4 Clunkers: mandatory inspections, where if a car fails, the state offers to buy it for a flat price just to get it off the road if the owner doesn't want to invest in fixing it or try its market value elsewhere.
Please look up the definition of communist and explain how it reasonably describes Bernie. He's a democratic socialist.

If said under their breath, quickly, and heavily accented (like any native speaker) it would be hard for anybody who hasn't delved deep into pronunciation and speed/conversational listening to pick it up.
Yeah no for every server busting their ass for 80k (very rough estimate) there's several busting their ass trapped under minimum wage because the fucking tip sharing cuts in the managers, chef, event coordinator, and others before the waitstaff get their share, and cash tips just don't happen. And they're forced to bus, clear, and flip their own tables, work hours after close to prep for events, and be on call to help with whatever else needs doing because when the restaurant is dead (which is most of the time) the establishment sees no ethical issue with paying $2.10 an hour for non-serving duties. 

Yeah I'm still fucking salty, ClubCorp.
Yeah that phrase that you put in quotes appeared nowhere in the monologue - you're being misleading and completely disingenuous **at best**. She made a joke about Sanders acting like a softball coach, referring to the way she treats reporters - news flash, many straight women coach softball. She made a joke about Sanders's perfect smokey eye being made from lies - news flash, that's a compliment on her makeup. She made a joke about Sanders acting like an Aunt from The Handmaid's Tale - news flash, that has nothing to do with appearance.
Pretty accurate from an international perspective. Democrats are pretty centrist, and have tended as a party towards neoconservatism. Bernie is a moderate leftist. Trump is listed too far to the right - but if that's his typical supporters being represented, not him, it's spot on.

>criticizing the (somehow popular) "smokey eye"

She called it "the perfect smokey eye". That's not even criticism, that's complimenting her on her makeup.
I don't think that's possible without a second input - a handlebar-based speed selector, possibly? - and adding a lot of complexity and weight to the bike. Because I doubt it could react responsively enough to changes in pedaling power to not mess with the resistance and therefore the cadence.
That's a seriously personable dude.
Ah, you're a wealthy Australian conservative who doesn't understand why people can't just be well-off like you are. Excellent.
The written part honestly did go well. He just needs to not accept questions - all he did was interrupt and talk over the person asking, misinterpret their questions, make personal assumptions and even attacks on those asking, and create word salads of barely tangentially related topics. The rudeness was absolutely astounding and indicative of severe narcissism.
Hahaha making fun of her voice, how original. So original that she herself made a joke about her own voice in the monologue.

But that's uncalled for, mean, and extreme hyperbole where not wholly false.
Lemme guess - you're a Republican, the party that calls those they disagree with "snowflakes".
Intentional misunderstanding not serious comment.
Heh - stretch.
Yeah I imagine it would be difficult to get a thing of infinite size to fly.
I definitely put an X in boxes instead of a check mark. He's not wrong.
So... Take a building. Run a plane through it. Suddenly, you have a gap in the supports - two or three floors just no longer exist, and the floors above find themselves unsupported to the point where heat allows the remaining support holding the upper floors to bend and give way. The floors above the gap:

a. Fall downward, accelerating at 9.8 meters per second per second and impacting the top of the remaining building with enough force to render the topmost floor structurally unsound and triggering a chain reaction that increases in energy until reaching the ground, or

b. Tip sideways, gaining angular velocity from God knows where.
Maybe they had news that Building 7 was rendered structurally unstable by the shockwaves and would collapse soon, but the game of fast paced telephone that is breaking news resulted in it being transformed into a report that building 7 had already collapsed?
Great to see WDW getting an RMC, and a single rail at that!
No it's definitely loopty loop.
Pacing looks incredible.
Yeah. I swear a strawman isn't necessary to make flat Earth theory look ridiculous.
Thank fucking Christ we finally have somebody putting some respeck on the name ð

Don't forget that Kizer lost us *seven games* last year if his turnovers inside the 35 are converted into points, and an eighth with an OT turnover.
That's a strawman - most Flerfers either believe that what we know as Earth is a never-ending infinite plane - accelerating "upwards" at 9.8m/s/s to account for gravity - or that Earth is "domed off" outside of the ice wall they believe contains us, where the sky meets the ground - think of a flat bottomed snow globe.
I don't understand this political compass.
Doesn't fit because it's somehow even fucking more stupid.
Not really. Jon Bois shows that field position (on kickoffs specifically) doesn't really correlate with a successful drive.  https://youtu.be/t_SsIKgwvz4, here's a link to the relevant [timestamp](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_SsIKgwvz4&t=5m10s), watch through 7:10.
No because it's a ridiculous comparison.
He plays so much slower than Schobert on the field, though.
By "hacked" you mean they logged the username and password you put into their clearly insecure form. I don't understand why people would log into Facebook on a site that has nothing to do with their Facebook account...
Louis is a better 4, Higgins is a better backup slot. Not sure which the FO sees as more valuable, but with one of Coleman or Callaway as well as Janis being relegated to WR4 or lower, I'm inclined to think a backup slot is more important. I've been a huge defender of Louis, but I think the time has come where we have a much better set of options at WR4.
Eh, he's pretty good.
Denzel is a good looking dude too. Those eyes are dreamy.
Jewell is way slow and I don't think he translates in the modern NFL.

And Reid isn't a starting quality player now, so FS would be an issue whether Randall struggles or we start a rookie on Reid's caliber.
Too bad Mason Rudolph has been Baker Mayfield's bitch his entire career.
General Kinkobi
Eh wasn't trying to brag but I do see how it comes off as tasteless. I'll edit.
Riskiest QB in the league, threw more interceptable passes than Kizer I believe in the timeframe where he was healthy.
Because Hubbard is a Nassib clone, and because we clearly weren't comfortable with Hurst's heart in the 5th. Shepherd isn't much of a penetrator and doesn't project well to a single gap 4-3.
I know you don't mean it this way, but I love that the wording implies that doing good work for his community is a red flag outside of which he's clean.
J.C. Jackson to the Pats hurts me deep inside.
He's a perfectly viable option at tackle, regardless of what X draftnik thinks.
Seven or eight, to be exact.

Lmao right.
Yeah he pinned his successful predictions. All two of them.
That's crazy to hear that admitted, that Darnold was "very high up there" and not the clear cut choice in New York.
I don't get how you could want Allen and be so upset with Mayfield. Unless of course you think Allen is just a big QB with a strong arm (in which case why the fuck would you want him?), and Baker is a small QB with an accurate noodle arm, neither of which is close to covering them as players. Baker is probably the closest to Allen in terms of potential, arm strength, intelligence, work ethic, drive, mobility... Anybody who's done research on their film would see Mayfield as a more polished, more accurate, more likely to succeed Allen.
This draft has shown me that you don't know what you're talking about, and any pick that wasn't your preferred guy is automatically a bust. Put your preferred selections here and I'll set a reminder for two years or so so we can see who picked better - a random armchair scout on Reddit or some of the best, most respected talent evaluators in the NFL. 

Here's mine, for reference - they all dropped, and we took different players at their positions around where I valued them, making me believe maybe there's something I didn't know or see about them:

Josh Rosen (Baker Mayfield): I'm happier with Baker in the long run, as I think he's clearly a better player in 2022 than Rosen is. 

Josh Jackson (Denzel Ward): Again, this is a pick of upside over current talent. Ward also allows Gregg to play more man if he wants to - Jackson fits his current zone splits though, and has better technique and aggressiveness to contrast Ward's superior athleticism and ball skills. 

Harold Landry (Chad Thomas): Thomas is a better interior pass rusher, Landry is better from the outside. A passing down line of Garrett/Ogunjobi/Thomas/Ogbah is about as strong as a passing down line of Garrett/Ogunjobi/Ogbah/Landry. Landry also had serious injury concerns. 

Derrius Guice (Nick Chubb): A healthy Chubb (who received the highest grade possible in his combine medical exam) is arguably the best back in the class - easily the best runner - and Guice's character concerns are not great. 

Mo Hurst: No true DI player taken makes me think we didn't see it as a need, and Hurst's heart issue seems a bit more serious than I thought. Thomas is a versatile DL who can play the interior and edge. 

Chukwuma Okorafor (Austin Corbett): I'll admit I'm terrible at scouting OL players. Many teams had Corbett as their #3 OT, however, and I'm not going to argue, especially when Okorafor fell to the mid third. 

JC Jackson (Simeon Thomas): Maybe his character didn't check out? I would have liked this character flier better than Calloway, and he's a much better corner than Thomas, but Dorsey is a good character evaluator and I obviously haven't spoken with any of these guys to judge for myself. 

Skai Moore (Genard Avery): Off-ball LB being a depth need, I gravitated towards Moore, but Avery seems more of a Gregg guy with his interior blitzing prowess.
Darnold is so much more Bortles than Kizer.
Sadly? You have strong comps to Wentz, Brees, Ryan, and Bortles, and you're sad that he didn't want Bortles?
And just like the championship Buckeyes, they wouldn't have done it if they actually got paid for their play by the most profitable sports organization in the world.
Was Carl Nassib a steal in the 3rd? Hubbard isn't either, in a deeper DE class to boot.
Why is Tyrod so tall and Gordon so short?
Worked for Dak.
It's really telling that the Giants, who through the process said they wouldn't take any QB but Darnold, passed on Sammy boy. It's also telling that the Jets, who said they had Rosen over Darnold, took Sammy boy.
Hurst and JC Jackson.
Ahem... /u/dontkillgamefish with your $1,000 bet on Darnold.
We cut Darius Hillary in December though. I wouldn't worry.
We did that after a TD last year.
Over Johnson definitely, I'd take Fournette over him too. Probably over Bell, and it's a toss-up with him and Zeke but I think I like Todd's style better.
Yep. Had the video of his takeover against San Antonio in the Extras section too.
Plays like one too.
It's a Vekoma? I thought it was classic enough that it was an Arrow like CP's Corkscrew.
I was excited for my first adult trip to my local park, Cedar Point, last year, and decided to look up some information on the coasters and such. I found Coaster Studios on YouTube through their parodies and fell in from there.
Yeah I've been busy and will be again tomorrow, so I'll just put my short list. 

Early second round: Derrius Guice, Harold Landry, Josh Jackson (if disregarding actual Browns picks made before this selection). 

Early third round: Royce Freeman, Rasheem Green, Chukwuma Okorafor (again if disregarding actual picks)

Mid fourth: Skai Moore

Mid fifth: JC Jackson

Sixth: Mo Hurst

If he's on the board, Auden Tate is a compelling pick as well. Maybe move Jackson to the sixth but I think he goes before that. Ideally we trade up with two of the sixths (and Jamar Taylor?) to take Moore and Tate in the fourth followed by Jackson and Hurst.
HAHAHAHA YOUR SOURCE AINT SHIT, GAMEFISH. 

I fucking told you.
It turned me into a newt
"Nothing personnel, kid" - Honor Landry
Well, I mean, thanks for the safety at least
We're getting there.
Gurley was in the fucking MVP conversation. It was Brady, Wentz, and Gurley.
Oof
A healthy Chubb is arguably the best runner in the class. Apparently he passed his medical with flying colors - I wasn't aware of that and wanted Guice.
Because Crowell was fucking shit as an early down runner.
Hyde is more of a goal line and short yardage power back. Chubb is a first and second down back, like we tried to use Crowell as last year.
Ward had one of the best PFF profiles of any CB.
You mean taking the top player on their board, Mel Kiper's hair be damned?
Sucks man.
Sucks.
Hubbard is not better than Thomas. Key has serious personality issues. Sweat I'm not high on.
Don't forget Duke/Chubb/DeValve as the fifth receiver, and honestly Louis and Higgins are solid options at WR4.
"Ricardo Louis dropped a pass from Baker Mayfield today-"

"**BUST!**" - /u/HOLYREGIME
Allen and Mayfield will be the best two in five years. Book it.
He's got the size of Allen but none of the arm talent. I'm also not a fan of Jackson in Baltimore - I don't think Flacco gives him the time he needs by keeping him on the bench.
Have you forgotten Gaines already? And Carrie isn't the slot. He's the #2 coming into camp, with Ward and probably Wilson fighting for the spot. BBC and Mitchell will battle for the nickel.
Gaines is better than Ward, legitimately one of the best in the league. Carrie isn't bad. BBC and Mitchell are fantastic nickels, and Wilson should battle with Ward and Carrie for the 2. We don't need a corner.
That would be a reach and a half.
>3rd best QB

Second highest floor, behind Rosen, who has a much lower ceiling. Second highest potential, behind Josh Allen, who has a much lower floor. You have Wentz, Brees, Matt Ryan, and Bortles on the board; how are you upset with Brees?

>Over drafting a CB

If he's the top player on your board, you don't get cute and trade down - Ward almost certainly goes to Denver or Tampa if we don't take him. 

>Picking a G/C that we don't need

Um he plays T at a high level. At worst, he's a more versatile Drango, a combination of him and Greco. Depth is important along the OL. 

>The 3rd best available RB that has a reconstructed knee

Tested as well as possible medically. A healthy Chubb is literally the best RB in the class, above Barkley and Guice. And Guice's personality issues are serious red flags - a lack of effort, work ethic, and honesty doesn't sound like a recipe for success.
Chubb is a running back. Michel is a scatback. The Browns need a running back, not a scatback.
Would have been better than stunting Kizer's growth.
Healthy Chubb is the best back in the class, better than both Barkley and Guice. I'm stoked - this seems to indicate that we're good on his medical report.
As arguably the best *running* back in the draft, it absolutely speaks volumes that he fell so far. And the teams that passed on him for another back - Seattle, NE, Tampa, Detroit - aren't exactly the teams who pass on anybody with the tiniest blemish on their record.
ððð I like Thomas much better.
Gets penetration outside and inside.
Myles was "disinterested" because of poetry and paleontology.
Yeah I don't even pretend to have an evaluation on the guys I didn't watch on the OL. I liked Okorafor, but aside from him I really didn't look into the tackles.
And alcohol.
Took Ingram quite a while to gain his footing in the league, and he needed an elite back to share the backfield with to do it.
I wanted Guice, but if Chubb is healthy, he's even better, and doesn't have the questions about effort or work ethic or even basic honesty. Great first and second down back to pair with Duke.
I miss that damn team. Nash, STAT, Marion, Barbosa, Bell... Richardson too I think? Ugh they were my shit in Live 07.
It still looks to me like a shift in momentum due to the finger roll - Oladipo's hand would have had to be against or through the backboard if the backboard was what changed the ball's direction. I try not to be a homer with stuff like that - but it looked clean to me.
Imagine if they start calling moving screens.
Day 3? Hell no, I don't let him fall past 64. He's too good.
Fluid as hell. That's the kind of smooth movement that translates to the pocket.
Tarkenton. Vick. Tyrod. Brees. Wilson. Flutie. HOFer Sonny Jurgenson. All 6'1" or shorter. 

And here's some interesting numbers in defense of Trubisky's speculated 6'1" measurement at the combine last year: http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2017/02/stats_show_shorter_nfl_quarter.html
Exactly. And this guy is actually good and driven to be the best.
Dilly dilly is dead. Thank fucking Christ.
Rosen was expected at 3 at the earliest, and that's with the specific Mayfield/Darnold 1&2 picks. Darnold and Allen were the only guys routinely expected at 1. Rosen's fall wasn't unexpected. He was nowhere near the #1 QB. Darnold absolutely was.
Did you see the Super Bowl yesterday? We came in first *and* fourth!
Life rules to live by.
heck out
Yep. I saw better ball placement than implied by 56%, better throws on the move than Darnold, insane arm strength letting him laser the ball to the sideline on out routes, a decent ability to anticipate a receiver getting a bit of space, and a lot more in the way of translatable positives.
No way. Gaines at #1, Carrie, Ward and Wilson fighting for #2, and BBC and Mitchell battling for nickel already make Taylor very expendable as a fallback dime. I think we target a guy day 3, I like JC Jackson and I think he makes sense with Dorsey.
Saints and Patriots are the only places I'd have been confident he'd develop properly. Chargers and Steelers were my B list for him. I don't like him anywhere else. He needs a lot of time and a lot of development.
Hahahahahahaha that's why Rosen went #10. Nobody had Rosen mocked to the Browns.
Broken bones aren't an injury risk. Gordon seems like he's got a renewed focus on football. Ricardo Louis and Rashard Higgins are absolutely fine WR4s.
Ah, right, because my team is bad, I clearly have no knowledge about football. Fuck yourself.
Jets fan, where were you when Baker was draft

I was on my couch

"Baker is draft"

"no"
That's why we took Baker over Allen. From the sound of it, they were the shortlist.
I assumed as much with Ward but wanted to outline that Wilson has similar #1 potential.
It's also about time we had our own prime JLew or Rudi or Jeremy Hill or Bettis - the guy who's just going to run the rest of the AFCN right the fuck over. Richardson wasn't it - Guice just runs hard, fast, and angry.
No he wasn't. He was the best QB *now* but you don't draft a QB in 2018 to be a reasonable starter from 2018-2025. You draft a QB in 2018 to be an MVP candidate from 2020-2028. Rosen has a ceiling around Eli or Matt Ryan. Maybe an MVP candidate once or twice, a solid starter. Baker has a ceiling around Brees. Allen has a ceiling that looks to follow the Wentz trajectory. I'll take Brees or Wentz any day over Eli or Ryan.
1(4) Bradley Chubb, DE, NC State

Was waiting for a trade down and was busy, so I didn't record my pick. Would have preferred a trade down with Buffalo, and would have taken Josh Jackson and Harold Landry at 12 and 22.
#SAY IT LOUDER FOR THE GROSSIS IN THE BACK
Open mouth and subpar angle, I'd wager.
Darnold was never my friend.
Denzel Ward is a project. Gaines is one of the best corners in football. Wilson is a very promising player and won't be cut in camp unless his recovery is far behind schedule. Carrie is a serviceable but unspectacular outside starter. And Randall won't line up 40 yards deep, because he wouldn't have to backpedal that far for his instincts and anticipation to keep him in the play like Peppers would have.
Don't underestimate Gettleman's powers. 

His running backs have doubled since the last time we met.
Taylor is our 7th CB right now. 7 CBs don't make the roster. I listed him as our fallback dime, but he's probably out. Even so, as much as I love Jackson (my #1 CB in the class for the Browns), we don't need him, and don't really have room for him anyway.
Gaines is incredibly good. Carrie is solid if unimpressive. Wilson has a ton of potential as does Ward. Mitchell is a quite good nickel.
Because Hyde isn't an early downs chain mover. Guice is. Besides, what holes do we have left? RB and EDGE/DPR are about it for guys who will be asked to make an impact.
And he went to Baltimore. He's fucked.
Except that the consensus was that Darnold was the best prospect by a mile and a total no-brainer.
Because they're likely the better players in five years.
@ me in a year. His game doesn't translate at 4.4. He's Reggie Bush with a bigger body that he doesn't use.
I watched a ton of film. He wouldn't hit a hole if there was a hint of a LB on the other side. He didn't take on defenders. He went down easily to contact.
Guice runs like Lynch or Bettis but has the athleticism to back it up. He's easily the best runner in the class.
Nope.
Nah. They don't have the developmental infrastructure and there's no way Flacco keeps him on the bench long enough.
Gotta save room for JC Jackson on day 3.
He'd have been a good pick somewhere with the developmental infrastructure and the time to let him sit. Flacco can't keep him on the bench for long enough.
Gaines is the #1. Ward is going to battle Carrie and Wilson for the 2. BBC and Mitchell will battle for the slot. Jamar Taylor is the fallback at dime. We good at CB until day 3, when we can take a flier on JC Jackson.
Landry is the DPR our defensive line rotation needs. We didn't need an Ogbah clone with Chubb.
That's already a question with Ward and Wilson, as Gaines is the #1 into camp.
Jackson is redundant if you trust Ward (and if you don't, you don't take the guy at 4). Gaines at #1, Carrie, Ward, and Wilson battling for #2, Boddy-Calhoun and Mitchell fighting for the nickel, and Taylor as the dime is more than enough to take into day 3, where I think you target J.C. Jackson.
I'm pretty thrilled honestly. That's not a situation where he'll be able to sit and develop for years like he needs to - Flacco can't keep him on the bench for long enough. Baltimore may have just crippled their future.
Shit if we're looking at TEs (why exactly when we have Njoku and DeValve though?) we could pair Baker back with his favorite target.

As it is, my R2 starts with Guice, continues with Landry, and ends with Hurst even if we have to trade up for him.
Shon Coleman.
He's a better running back. Penny is a better receiver, but nobody is better than Guice at running north and south in this draft. Guice is a power back with very good speed. He compares with Marshawn Lynch on the field.
The second for sure. Rosen was above Mayfield for me by a slight margin, and Jackson was my CB1 over Ward - although both Mayfield and Ward have higher potential - but Guice is clearly a much better fit in Cleveland than Barkley.
Don't crown Ward yet. He's a bit of a project, needs some time and evaluation. I think he fights with Currie and Wilson for the #2 this year coming into camp.
And at 3.
Best move of the draft was not taking Darnold IMO.
Insanity. You're basically expecting nothing less than perennial All Pro play from a rookie receiving scatback who doesn't take contact.
Him, Allen, or Mayfield. I've said it the entire process, those ceilings are the highest.
Yeah I had him as my #1 CB - granted, I weighted zone prowess, technique, and aggression higher than most because that's what Gregg requires from his corners.
Lamar can't go to a team that needs a QB immediately, though. He needs time, and I mean years, in a place with an established but aging starter and a very good developmental framework.
Please please please please fall just one more pick
Guice is better alongside Duke.
Felt like a serious reach to me. Guice is a far better between the tackles back.
Please don't wear 1. It's a tacky number.
We had the proof all along.
You could try not being an asshole. He's happy. Let him be happy.
Some communities are STRICT about that shit. Probably just being safe.
On desktop, on the sidebar, there should be your username and an "edit" button next to it. Hit that edit button. Set your flair.
It's him. It's a shitty cross out job.
Gaines and Carrie will be fine holding down the fort TBH if Ward isn't ready to start. It's not a huge hole, but one of the biggest we had left. Now I'd say maybe RB is the biggest?
Coleman and Hubbard will be just fine. And Tyrod is fantastic at avoiding pressure.
Gotta think we treat it like Goff. If we're in the playoff hunt, it's Tyrod.
Oh me too, to target one of those three. But I meant from #4.
I can root for him in Arizona. I did with Warner. I'm not too upset.
Have you watched film, or just box scores?
8 wins. Easy. 

Kizer lost us 7 by himself last year. Improve CB, FS, WR, and RB like we did in FA and you have a much better team around a much better QB in Tyrod. Ward and Mayfield are really just icing on the cake tbh but they make the future much more promising as well - while Ward might just step in opposite Gaines on the outside, his real value will be seen in a year or two.
Best zone corner in the draft, best technique, most aggressive, excellent size. He's my top CB in the draft. Ward has ball skills and insane athleticism, and I'm not upset with the pick, but ugh JJ would have been a better fit. Considering he's still on the board along with Landry, Hurst, and Guice, I'd be chuffed as hell if we'd traded down a few times.
Start with your flair ð
Lamar needs work, but I fear for the league for the next 20 years if he goes to New England or New Orleans where he has time and strong development.
Landry Hurst or Guice. I'd be thrilled with any - I'd love Josh Jackson too if we hadn't taken Ward.
Similar timeframe according to Dorsey. Makes a lot of sense considering the similarities in their games that Dorsey knew beforehand. I don't think Baker is guaranteed to be ready week 1. And Dorsey has never been one to leave a question mark at QB.
Who, Darnold? Agreed.
And there is no analogous comparison from the past to Josh Allen. The best I have is Carson Wentz - but that won't satisfy you despite the incredible similarities on tape as individuals.
Mayfield's receivers got open, ran good routes, and ran Lincoln Riley's offense very well. They're also likely future day 1 and 2 picks. There's no comparison there.
Almost zero chance. Thank your for your reading comprehension.
These tweets were never a factor. Allen is firmly in contention for #1 - I'd say it's between him and Baker considering the timeline of when Dorsey said he made his decision, right after the combine, at which both Baker and Allen blew people away.
Nah. Just people speculating and one moron saying "NOOOOOOO"
I saw differently, especially on the run. Rosen's receivers were bad, dropping a fair few easy passes, but Allen's were atrocious. Struggled to get open, gave up on routes, made wrong reads on options, dropped a ton of passes, couldn't get in position to catch others.
Looks photoshopped? "Baker Mayfield" doesn't curve the way I'd expect it to based on the curve of the rest of the sign.
That's not different from any other year.
Rosen is a guy who I could see having a Matt Ryan MVP year or two. Allen is a guy I can easily see following a Wentz trajectory where he looks to be an MVP candidate into the foreseeable future. Mayfield - I have no idea. I can see him doing a Brees honestly and that's just scary to think about. And Darnold - well, I see Bortles, but Bortles handled properly (given time) would be decent I think.
I'm saying Allen's accuracy isn't quantified properly by 56%. His ball placement is far better than that, and with competent receivers, you'd expect a much higher completion percentage.
The issue is that Allen *is* a consensus top 5 pick. The previous guys with accuracy issues were not - even Favre was a second round pick. There's clearly something different about Allen. As such, I don't think comp % comparisons are plausible. And judging film, I see so much Wentz in Allen.
*Bad take
Allen placed the ball a lot more accurately than 56% implies. Especially on the run, when you're forced to have good lower body mechanics. That's why people don't worry about Darnold's atrocious lower body mechanics, and it's why people shouldn't worry about Allen's and the inaccuracy that stems from it.
Find a QB with a sub 57% or even sub 60% completion percentage who was a consensus top 5 pick. He's a severe outlier. He oozes potential and teases fixable mechanical accuracy. There is no comparison for him.
Baker if they want a guy to start in 2019, Allen if they want a guy to be MVP in 2021 IMO. Tyrod *is* on a one year contract... I'm leaning Baker.
His ball placement was so much better than 56%. That's something Wentz didn't have - his receivers helped his completion percentage, while Allen's hurt his.
Both are short, both are accurate, both are quick processors, both are mobile. Baker has a higher ceiling due to his stronger arm, better ball placement, and better football IQ.
His throwing motion isn't slow though. I see a lot of Bortles in Darnold honestly, and think Bortles handled properly (i.e. given time) is a decent QB. Not a better developmental prospect than Allen, but not bad.
But this statement alleges that they didn't know who the pick was at that time, but knew before Darnold's pro day. That's not a timeframe conducive to a decision made positively in favor of Darnold.
Compare him this year to him his rookie year. He's finally pieced some things together.
Remindme! 3 years
This screams Baker or Allen. I'm very happy with either.
Baker or Allen based on who would have impressed enough at and around the combine. Not Darnold as he would have had to be the pick before the combine to be assured that he could sit out the throwing drills.
That points strongly to Baker and Allen, both of whom impressed everybody at the combine. It points away from Darnold, as we would have decided before the combine to assure him that he'd be fine to sit out the throwing drills.
Bortles improved his mechanics for last season and was a much more effective QB. Wentz improved his mechanics and is a more effective QB. Nowhere did I say Bortles is the ceiling - I'd call him closer to the floor based on how poorly his development has been managed.
Gerrymandering doesn't affect the electoral college.
His ball placement is incredible. Doesn't matter if a defender is there or not, because he can throw to where his receiver needs it to be and the defender can't get to it. He also excels at finding the open man - Georgia had to revamp their defense in the third quarter because he'd find the open man and tear them apart. He struggled more in the third quarter because he didn't have an open man to read to as often, but he adjusted by the fourth and was back to his surgical self.
Bortles did. Wentz did. Top of my head there.
Who the fuck cares?
Out of curiosity, what's the racial makeup of this sample? I figure Lamar might be widely picked because he has a traditionally black name, and a black student might gravitate towards that? Either that, or they've heard his name because he's been electric at Louisville and made several appearances on ESPN highlight lists, or it's just random.
I think there are three QBs, potentially four as there are a lot of smart people who are higher on Darnold than I am, who are all better than Goff and Wentz. You don't pass on that.
1(1) Josh Rosen, QB, UCLA
Except actually a good player with a strong arm, great ball placement, high processing speed, stellar football IQ, and good mobility.
Not lazy. Just plain bad.
He's got the work ethic and - if we draft him - the coaching staff he needs to make it happen. Beyond that I can only speculate.
Jackson plays way faster than 4.5, and was clocked in the low 4.4s at his pro day. He isn't slow. He also has the potential to be an elite #1 CB.
He has room to improve with a lot of the little things, unlike Rosen. He also has better physical and uncoachable tools - a stronger arm, better ball placement, more mobility, a higher processing speed, a better football IQ.
Allen has correctable accuracy, though. Throwing on the run forces good footwork, and his ball placement on the run is better than even Darnold's. His footwork is the issue.
You clearly haven't watched him then. His middle of the field intermediate passes are a thing of beauty, and his ball placement is arguably better than Rosen's, and best in class.
He's limited by several physical attributes - his arm strength, third best in the class and only better than Darnold, is merely adequate and doesn't do him many favors throwing to the sideline. His athleticism outside the pocket won't allow him to extend many plays, although his moves inside the pocket are quite strong. His ball placement isn't always stellar, and Mayfield's may be stronger on a play to play basis.
No he isn't. Jackson is a far more aggressive and physical corner with better technique than Ward. Ward is a project with excellent athleticism and all the tools to succeed. Jackson also excels in zone, which requires better awareness and football IQ.
I haven't seen a reputable mock with Barkley in the top 3 unless Darnold goes #1 in months.
Nah. His footwork causes his inaccuracy. He's got a stellar work ethic. He'll get there.
Allen is much much more than a strong arm. He's a better prospect than Darnold.
Team anyonebutDarnold is here reporting for duty.
Watch the film. He's very very good. Accurate, mobile, with a stronger arm than anybody but Allen. He does many of the little things well - not as well as Rosen, but he has a higher ceiling than Rosen.
You should seriously just leave a comment with `&nbsp;` on the draft thread if he's the pick.
And that's the biggest thing IMO with both Mayfield and Allen. They're much more highly regarded than any other QB of their size or completion percentage than anybody has ever been. Even Brett Favre and Drew Brees, the two Hall of Fame comparisons, were second round prospects. You can look at how many sub 6'2" or 58% QBs succeed or fail in the NFL, but these are literally firsts as top 5 picks.
Josh Jackson is a much better fit.
After he was drafted.
Egad, not him. I'd rather have the one who looks like he gets his hair cut with a rusty hatchet.
I have three guys I'm okay with, and Rosen is probably still my #1. But the fact is that while he's the best QB in the draft *today*, there's almost zero chance he's the best QB in five years. He has a solid ceiling, but Mayfield, Darnold, and especially Allen have higher upside.
Yep, I'm 95% sure if we go Baker, the Giants go Darnold and the Jets go Rosen. If the Bills want Allen, which reports say they do, we're their only chance. That drives the price up to where 12, 22, one of their picks in the 50s, and their 2019 first rounder becomes a real possibility. Josh Jackson, Harold Landry, Derrius Guice, and Mo Hurst, come on down!
Jesus can I hop on that bet? Pissed I didn't see it.
Because the Giants have said they only like Darnold, and the Jets have been very strongly linked to Mayfield. There's clear indicators who they want. There aren't clear indicators who we want.
Right now? Yes. In five years? Who knows. Allen has much higher upside than any of the other three, and his issues are fixable.
Or maybe, just maybe, Allen has incredible upside and rather fixable issues.
Not so sure. He's the safe pick, but teams often prefer to gamble on astronomical upside with a guy like Allen or Darnold rather than a solid floor as a reasonable starter (Rosen) or a very strong backup (Mayfield) and a moderate ceiling.
Seriously it's quite cult-like.

>California since the election is usually over before they finish voting

That's just a projection, and can be completely invalidated by an unprecedented voting event - but that event won't happen because it hasn't happened before so people don't realize it could. 

>Texas where there is no need to vote unless you're Republican

That's the mentality that causes Texas to stay firmly red. If either party gets 100% voter turnout in a specific state while the other party gets their usual turnout, I believe that party would win that state in a landslide.
Not a chance. Again, Rosen is a better prospect in a very similar style to Goff. All four - yes, four - of the QBs this year are very strong prospects. There's just nobody who strings together astronomical upside and startable floor - but that's the Andrew Luck level.
He didn't go over Goff, and Rosen is a better prospect than Goff. Wentz is firmly in the top 5 QBs, but I really don't think he's #1 in this draft.
Dorsey forgave his soul enough to risk a day 3 pick on him. That's not a high vote of confidence.
Ah damn I'm an idiot, I knew I recognized the name but was too lazy to look it up. Brain saw Haden and told me Hamilton was a corner too.
Wentz was 100% considered a project who wouldn't be able to start year 1. In a worse situation than Philly, starting year 1 could completely destroy his development (see: Couch, Tim; Kizer, DeShone).
Hue is 100% in the loop on the board, and he said he had to stop talking specifically about QBs with Dorsey because if not, they'd talk for years. Sounds like two people with a lot of knowledge and information.
Jon Bois did it better.
Fuck that mentality. That goes to a tip share usually, which is often skewed heavily towards managers and other people who had nothing to do with your service, like event managers. Servers get a tiny fraction of that service charge.
Landry/Jackson/Guice/Hurst. Legitimate shot at all four trading with the Bills.
As far as late round CBs go, you can't beat JC Jackson.
Better than Darnold.
JT Barrett confirmed.
Who has been clean since entering the NFL. Your point?
From all reports, he hasn't had an interview where he didn't blow away the interviewer.
Hate to break it to you, but unless your name is Dorsey, Wolf, Highsmith, McCloughan, Berry, Jackson, Haley, or Zampese, you're probably part of the smokescreen.
No it isn't. The correct thing to do is to make a post like:

[Allbright] Oh no...

So that people understand that it's a quote of the tweet and not editorialization. I swear /r/NBA been doing it right for years.
Actually, yes, taking Wentz would have been a mistake. A project QB would not have been a good fit for our offense, would have been killed behind our OL, would have had nobody to throw to, and most importantly, would have had nobody good enough to keep him on the bench. 

And I still maintain Watson was a fluke. He threw more interceptable passes than Kizer before his injury. That sort of luck runs out fast in the NFL.
Seriously, I feel like few enough 6'1" QBs and QBs with 57% completion are considered consensus first round picks throughout history that it's fair to view Mayfield and Allen as much more likely to be the exception to the rule. Especially when you watch them on tape and see a ton of positives and fixable drawbacks to both.
I'm thinking of how vindicated I'll feel when Josh Allen wins a game.
>Change the facemasks back to grey/silver. 

Fuuuuuuccckk that. The brown masks are the best our orange helmets have ever looked.
Give me Harold Landry, Mo Hurst, and Derrius Guice instead of Fitzpatrick, Evans, and Chubb, and I'm on board. Each is an incredible fit for this team and coaching staff: Jackson is the best aggressive zone corner in the draft and gives Gregg Williams the size he loves outside, Landry as a DPR is absolutely best in class and represents a huge upgrade over Ogbah on passing downs, Hurst is the best interior penetrator in the draft and would give Gregg Williams wet dreams for months beside Ogunjobi, and Guice is the best north-south runner in the draft and pairs well with Duke.
Darnold's floor is maaaayyyyybe rookie Bortles. Rosen is the guy with a floor around Jared Goff (but reading the defenses himself) - somewhere near the top 20 in the league.
Same. Allen is just flat out a better prospect than Darnold. 

Basically you take Rosen if you want day 1 readiness and a reasonable ceiling, Allen if you want a developmental prospect with an astronomical ceiling, Mayfield to hedge your bet from Rosen in favor of a bit less readiness and a bit more ceiling, and Darnold if you want to hedge from Allen in favor of a bit more readiness and a bit less ceiling.
Same here. I'd prefer not Darnold, but if Dorsey/Wolf/Highsmith/McCloughan/DePodesta/Berry/Jackson/Haley/Zampese decide that Darnold is the best prospect for Cleveland, I'm not going to argue with that fucking brain trust.
Kill trophies and collect bad guys?
I approve of your ordering.
Yes but he was our best QB by a wide margin. There's no way Wentz, a better prospect and a better QB, stays off the field. Now, with Taylor and a veteran backup, Allen or Darnold are viable developmental options.
WE DIDNT HAVE THE TALENT TO KEEP KIZER OFF THE FIELD.
Yes, but we didn't have the talent to keep him on the bench. Just like with Kizer.
Allen has much better ball placement than his numbers imply on tape. Wentz had more consistent footwork, but that's not something you base an evaluation on - case in point, Darnold's footwork is far worse than Allen's.
Not really, not in the real world. But Bernie Sanders had much of that DemSoc ideology.
Wentz had a juggernaut of a team around him. Allen had Wyoming. That'll add 8% easily, especially factoring how much better even MW defenses are than FCS defenses.
No, but it's certainly part of it. His ball placement is much better on the move than stationary, and it's comparable to Darnold's.
It's the same thing as drafting Tim Couch in 1999 vs having him start for the first time in 2001 once we had a bit of a team around him. The first Couch fails horribly. The second has a serious chance.
Similar accuracy, both improving drastically on the run, fantastic athleticism, quick release, good quick eyes, decent anticipation. They're a lot more similar than just "big with a strong arm".
All the conflicting reports in the world surfaced today.
He's got a bit of bowling ball in him. I like Guice better as a violent north-south runner, but there's no reason for Royce to be that low on most boards.
One of Darnold's biggest strengths *is* throwing on the run. I've said many times that Allen is better there, though - looks like the numbers here bear that out.
Trade back with Buffalo. Target Josh Jackson, Mo Hurst, Harold Landry, and Derrius Guice.
Budda Baker ððððððð 

No way does he get traded. You're out of your goddamn mind.
Landry is available at 22. Trade back, get two of Josh Jackson, Landry, Hurst, and Guice, and see if one falls to where we can trade up from 33 or 35.
Aruna looked good against UCLA, getting some pocket movement quite often for Rosen. 

My guy is CB J.C. Jackson out of Maryland, who I see in the same conversation talent-wise as Ward and Jackson. He's a top 5 CB.
Except that, for our scheme and roster, Jackson is quality over Ward, Landry is quality over Chubb, Guice is quality over Barkley, and Hurst is the best interior penetrator in the draft. Trading for 12 and 22 gives us a shot at all four.
Josh Allen looks a hell of a lot like him.
Being better than Kessler would have been Wentz's downfall. Playing behind our trash OL and throwing to our awful targets (how's Ricardo Louis as the 1 and Rashard Higgins as the 2 sound? That's what you get with no Coleman) with our awful defense forcing him to constantly throw and go for big plays to stay in games is just a recipe for disaster, especially for a project QB.
Yeah and it was horrendous in 2016.
Carson Wentz on the 2016 Browns is a disaster of epic proportions, just as Kizer or Allen would have been. The 2018 Browns are entirely a different situation, which is why I have no problem with taking a project like Allen now, but Wentz would have been trash thrown into the fire of that dumpster rather than the competent Eagles team with a strong defense.
Look. Rosen is my 1. Has been all through the process. I'm just showing why Allen could be a more attractive prospect depending on GM philosophy. 

Also ew to Ward over Jackson. He's a much worse fit at CB. Landry would be a better fit over Chubb as a DPR is more needed than a three down run specialist like Ogbah. And Guice as a north-south runner is a better fit than Barkley at RB. The way I see it, a trade down from 4 to 12 and 22 is the best case - snag Rosen, Jackson, Landry, Guice, and Hurst in a perfect world.
Already better, yes. That doesn't mean he stays better. Goff was already better than Wentz, but Wentz developed into his higher ceiling and has become the better player. Rosen is Goff in this analogy, while Allen and Darnold (and Jackson) are Wentz.
I trust the guys who have made a career out of this far more than I trust us armchair analysts on Reddit and Twitter. That includes myself.
Rosen's attainable ceiling is high, but not as high as Darnold's or especially Allen's. The Browns are either going for the sure thing, or gambling on the future. If we're going for the sure thing, it has to be Rosen or Mayfield, and if we're gambling on the future, it has to be Allen or Darnold - both in that order.
I don't care if you dislike Rosen, Mayfield, Allen, or Darnold. 

Any of them is better than fucking Barkley and Chubb.

Considering that before he was given the trainwreck depth charts that included Cody Kessler, Kevin Hogan, and DeShone Kizer, Hue Jackson was considered one of the premier QB developers in the league. It's silly to change that narrative based on two prospects with no real NFL ceiling and a third who needed time but was forced to start by circumstances outside of the coach's control.
I'm saying that people don't call people racist because of the hat they wear. They call people racist because people who wear those hats often say racist things.
I'd say the people who sold the schools are more to blame than the person who imposed sanctions.
Sometimes quarterbacks just aren't good. It's not Hue's fault we went into the season with zero experienced QBs on the roster. Truth is, Kizer was the best of a very bad bunch, and his issues couldn't be improved while his time was consumed with the hectic schedule of being an NFL rookie starter.
I swear I know this guy. He's exactly this edgy and looks identical.

Hahahahaha DAE "it's the hat not the person wearing it"?

It acts like a duck, it dresses like a duck. You have to be Patrick Star levels of in denial to claim that it isn't a duck.
Oh you mean the guy with no ceiling, a very very very flawed prospect who was better running than throwing, and another extremely flawed prospect with very bad mechanics and eyes who was forced into a starting role where he had no time to learn?
Who is considered to be one of the premier QB developers in the league.
Allen didn't *have* open receivers to wait on at Wyoming. He had to anticipate separation on what felt like every play when I watched his film. I don't think anticipation is an issue for Allen.
Allen has the arm to do it though. It's what set Favre apart from say Romo.
Daily reminder that wins and losses are a team statistic.
HOFers Tom Brady and Brett Favre never separated themselves until they got to the NFL, and that's just off the top of my head.
Yeah Darnold's are way worse. But both improve dramatically when throwing off platform, indicating that the issue isn't deeper - throwing off platform forces good footwork, and with that "fixed" by throwing off platform, Allen and Darnold are both accurate passers.
Mora burned this bridge a while ago, didn't he? I don't believe any player in the draft is a guaranteed HOFer - that's insanity - but I agree much more with this take than with his previous one based on the film and my amateur psychological analysis of his interviews and statements.
Give me Arden Key or J.C. Jackson as character risks instead. Both are top 4 talents at their positions and will drop quite seriously because of relatively minor issues.
Give me Jackson, Hurst, or Landry at 4 (although I think all three will fall, to where we could get two at 12 and 22) and Guice (who likely won't be there) at 33 or 35 and I'm a happy man in this mock.
I don't dislike Allen, and I feel he's the highest of the ceiling guys (Allen, Darnold, and Jackson). I'd prefer Rosen or possibly Mayfield, though.
Oh my god how do you correct the word alot and not link the fucking [Hyperbole and a Half page](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html?m=1)?
Nassib needs to be a pure bullrusher because he has nowhere near the bend to get around the tackle. I honestly wonder if he's not better suited to put on weight and slide inside. I feel the same way about Hubbard in this year's draft.
Chicago had the Fridge. Cleveland has the Deinonychus - much faster, more agile, and more intelligent than his prey.

Ah, whataboutism. That your only defense? "Yeah sure my politician is scummy, but there's another politician who isn't holding office but was also a bit scummy!"
Same here. I've gone from hardcore social conservative to libertarian to full on liberal since I've been able to vote as my world view has changed. I chose the Tea Party folks for my parents and brother to vote for in 2010 and voted Romney and straight GOP and Constitution Party in 2012, voted more libertarian in the 2014 midterms - even voting for some *gasp* Democrats - then voted Bernie in the primary (since Rand Paul had dropped out) and Gary Johnson in the general in 2016. Now I identify closer to a DemSoc than to a libertarian.
Yep. No doubt he's had conversations with Hue, Haley, Gregg, etc, picking their brains, but from what Hue said, in their conversations, they haven't had a final answer on the QB. Dorsey seems like a black box that takes in the input of the coaches and scouts and outputs a draft pick without the result being visible from the outside.
Eh true. Wishful thinking I guess.
Jamar got taken advantage by anybody who had anything more than speed. He worked well with Haden because Joe locked down the other side, allowing help to shade to Taylor and letting Jamar take the more athletic, less polished receiver. McCourty didn't lock down his side, the help was inexperienced with bad instincts and anticipation, and it all led to Taylor's exposure.
Yeah I understand that, but if I'm the GM and our doctors cleared him, I sprint to the podium if he's there at 33. He's so talented, and he's exactly the type of interior penetrator Gregg Williams loves to have two of. A healthy Hurst beside Ogunjobi is the stuff of dreams.
I get the feeling Dorsey hasn't said shit to anybody who doesn't *need* to know.
Trade with the Bills, target two of Josh Jackson, Mo Hurst, Harold Landry, and Derrius Guice.
What is with your ordering?

Entering camp, Gaines and Carrie will be on the outside. BBC and Mitchell will battle for the nickel - neither is big enough to play outside. Taylor and Wilson should each be very fine dime options, but Taylor should not get any more snaps than necessary and I don't know what to expect from Wilson yet.
There is zero chance we pass on Jackson at 33 if he's on the board. There's also no way Hurst falls to 64 - I can understand him falling out of the first (although I think he should be a top half of the first round pick), but he's gone by 40 no matter what. If we're taking a corner late, I'd rather take a character flier on JC Jackson, who I see as a top 4 CB in the class.
Saying that Jamarco Jones is an immediate starter is infinitely more nuts.
Jamarco ð dude isn't going to plug and play. Luckily, we don't need a plug and play - Coleman is solid and Hubbard is quality - so we can draft for development. I like Okorafor, I think he's the best tackle in the draft in 4 years. We also have Penis Penis.

He was cleared at his pro day. I'm not worried - and on the field, he's a more polished Ogunjobi. That's a scary pair, and lets us sit back in coverage bringing four or five to get pressure.
Anticipation: Mayfield and Rosen are tops in the class. Allen is right with Darnold. 

Poise: Rosen is unquestionably best in class. Everybody else bails early from clean pockets, but Allen stands tall more often than Mayfield or Darnold. 

Throwing on the run: Allen is the best in the class with Darnold second and Mayfield third. 

Darnold's accuracy is worse than Mayfield or Rosen's, his size is worse than Allen's or Rosen's, his arm strength is worst of the top 4, his mobility is worse than Allen's and Mayfield's (and Rosen even does some things better, especially in the pocket). Mayfield won more, and Rosen and Allen won with less. Allen and Rosen are clean off field. 

I don't see how he's a clear top prospect like some are claiming.
It's okay, we'll have plenty of home games in January.
I've been banging the table for Mo Hurst at 12 or 22, but I could absolutely deal with passing if we got Ed next year.
So. Plain. Ugh these are bad. If Nike wanted to give me hope, they'd go back to the Brunell era Jags unis - those were clean as fuck but still spicy.

Allen is a much better prospect than Kizer - and we actually have the time, resources, and coaching staff to develop him. Why not take the guy with the highest ceiling?

It was a pun on the word "leaking" you absolute twat.
ARPANET is also not the internet. The internet is a network of many different networks using different protocols.
Tape has stopped looking like a word.
What goes at the start of literally every internet address you've ever used, right after the protocol? WWW. The World Wide Web is much more anologous to the modern Internet than the ARPANET was.
[Per the US Holocaust Memorial Museum](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/mobile/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007453), the Germans specifically discovered the symbol in excavations of ancient Troy:

>The symbol experienced a resurgence in the late nineteenth century, following extensive archaeological work such as that of the famous German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann. Schliemann discovered the hooked cross on the site of ancient Troy in modern Turkey. He connected it with similar shapes found on pottery in Germany and speculated that it was a âsignificant religious symbol of our remote ancestors.â

>However, the work of Schliemann soon was taken up by movements that wanted to evoke racial purity, âAryan identityâ and German nationalist pride.
>The ARPANET was decommissioned in 1990.
[I think you mean England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web)
And ancient Greece, from which the Germans discovered (and promptly bastardized into a symbol for racial purity) the swastika.
Yep, Fallout New Vegas got it right.
Ooh did the pee tape finally come out?
Yep. Hard work is enough to come back from being wiped out in one of the largest genocides in history. They just need to pull themselves out of smallpox by their bootstraps.
Bury the castle
That's not accuracy, that's decision making and eye speed, both of which Allen is much better at than Kizer.
Kizer never had an opportunity to improve his footwork. Starting 15 games doesn't give him the time he needed. That's what Hue was trying to do by playing hot potato with the QB room, but he realized he couldn't start anybody else and hope for anywhere near the same production.
>as a result of LSU's archaic offensive design,Â Derrius GuiceÂ faced a stacked box (defined as at least one extra defender in the box) on an otherworldly 73 percent of his carries. ThatÂ is by far the most in the class. It didn't matter, though. GuiceÂ destroyed extra attention in his sample, shredding opposing defenses for 5.88 Yards Created per attempt (third-best in the class).Â 

Hahahahahahahahahahahhahahahaha

Barkley's yards translate a lot more poorly to the faster, better coached (angles and tackling form) NFL. Guice's translate nearly 1:1.
That's literally what I just said.
>So Barkley gets killed for not taking on a LB even tho he has the skills to avoid it and make a big play.

Yes. I'd rather have a guy who runs for 3 or 4 yards every time than a guy who threatens a 3 yard loss every time he touches the ball. That's not sustainable, and it absolutely kills drives - many more drives than would benefit from his home run ability. 

>Barkley has the nastiest jump cut since sanders.

If that's the case (it's not) then he should hit the hole, get through it, then jump cut to avoid the LB. 

>Barkley was the best RB at making guys miss.

He was the worst at gaining yards after being contacted.
It's his feet. His step through is so inconsistent, but when he gets it right, his passes are a thing of beauty. 

Allen's inaccuracy seems mechanical as well. Experts say throwing off platform forces you to play with good lower body mechanics - and he is more accurate than Darnold from off platform.
Guice hit a hole and took on the linebacker behind it. Barkley, if he saw any sign of a linebacker through a hole, skipped the hole and bounced outside despite having the size to win against a linebacker.
His mechanics and accuracy are fixable. His eyes and decision making aren't. That's a big difference.
Ah damn. I thought maybe you were picking the brains of a creative future-minded community.
Hold. The. FUCK. On. 

You actually invented this? This isn't entirely hypothetical?

This is honestly huge if so. Friction is such a bitch in so many applications and industries.
Hubbard should fall to 2 with a solid crop of edges above him - Chubb, Landry, Davenport, and Key are all much better on the field (although Key probably drops to day 2 as well).

Williams gets reached on for sure because there's no transcendent OT prospects. McGlinchey is the consensus top, but beyond him, there's no real standouts. I think Okorafor especially will be better.
In which Artest apologizes to the person who spilled beer on him.
:(

Austin and Fred are national treasures
Austin and Fred are quite solid and pretty balanced - of course they get excited when the Cavs do something, but they definitely remove bias when talking about referees and their calls - often they'll use the entire free throw time to talk about how the Cavs player wasn't fouled.
Hubbard is basically a Nassib clone. Williams is a RT, and not the greatest prospect at that. I don't care how small the pool is, they're not first round talents.
I've seen a lot of mocks placing him in the 4th or even 5th. But I'd be 100% willing to take him in the 3rd.
Guice is a better runner (for the NFL), Barkley is a better receiver. But that kind of receiving back can be found elsewhere - I don't see much in Barkley that Duke Johnson can't do, and Johnson has the added benefit of finding a hole and turning upfield early on the ground. Barkley has elite size and very good speed for it, but until he uses that size to win contact and bang it up the middle, he'll never be transcendent.
Oh definitely, by "barely good" I didn't mean "nearly bad", just that it's pretty close to being average - which compared to Allen, Mayfield, and Rosen (and Jackson on tape) is kind of jarringly weak. 

I do think he will gain arm strength towards the end of games by fixing his mechanics, specifically his tendency to arm throw. He very clearly loses velocity over the course of the game, which I suspect is a result of his arm becoming tired. I'm not sure it will help the top end, though, and I highly doubt he'll ever throw like Favre or Rodgers.
Incredible work ethic too, which makes me think if his issues are fixable - and they look mostly mechanical on tape, corroborated by how much he improves when throwing on the run (similar to Darnold, and to Wentz before them) - he'll fix them. If we're going to pass up high floors (Rosen and Mayfield) for stellar ceilings, I want Allen.
Just because Rosen and Mayfield are the best *right now* doesn't mean you take one of them at #1. I get the feeling we'd be upset if we got Goff at 1 and Wentz became a fast MVP candidate after being considered a project while Goff stagnated - that's the argument for Allen or to a lesser extent Darnold. I'm a big fan of Rosen and I do think his ceiling is pretty high - Eli Manning being a reasonable cap - but Allen's ceiling is vastly higher.
Footwork and mechanics are miles better than Darnold.
Most. But not all. I'm so glad we haven't been swamped with "Draft Ward and Hubbard and Barrett etc" or "Why don't we ever draft OSU players but Pittsburgh does and they're always all so good" posts this year though...
A very good RB just isn't worth a top 5 pick. I'd say a guaranteed HOFer would be. But Barkley isn't a guaranteed HOF talent. And there's another very good RB right behind him in Guice - who is better between the tackles anyway.
Yeah it's barely even good tbh. Worst of the top 5 (but the other four all have very good to elite arm strength)
Hey I'm dyslexic and I think it's funny. It's not like it really affects functional ability (aside from spending five minutes just trying to sort out the long ass numbers on the damn tax forms), so I think it's fine to make fun of.
I'd go with Bortles for his floor. Like rookie Bortles, not the mildly improved 2017 Bortles.
J.C. Jackson. Top 3 CB in the class, but he will fall far because of off-the-field issues that seemed to be both wrong place at the wrong time stuff, and fixed upon transferring from Florida to Maryland.
His list is nearly identical to mine, aside from Mark Andrews who I see as a Jason Witten with worse blocking skills. 

But an interesting read on why Darnold, Barkley, Connor Williams, Sam Hubbard, and more aren't the super safe obvious picks many make them out to be.
/r/bonecleaningjuice
There's also the issue that Cohen basically only does cover-ups, so either Hannity had to cover something up - such as an affair - and is lying about never having employed Cohen (plausible - Cohen's team is under oath, Sean is not; not to mention, Cohen's fish are pretty fried and Hannity has a lot to lose from something like that coming out), or Hannity is attempting to abuse attorney-client privilege to speak to one of Cohen's clients - and I guarantee it wasn't Elliott Broidy - in a way that couldn't be uncovered by law enforcement (which Sean is now undermining by insisting that he never employed Cohen, giving the privilege a very shaky legal foundation at best - and at worst, completely undermining Cohen's claims of even being a lawyer whose communications are protected by privilege). 

Also, Hannity is talking like a kid who doesn't know how much information his parents have on him: A request to remain confidential before the proceedings, then an immediate rebuttal that Cohen was never his lawyer, and a later statement that their interactions were subject to attorney-client privilege sounds a lot like high schooler Billy telling his folks "I didn't go to that party. And even if I did, I know there wasn't any alcohol there, and I wouldn't have drank any if there was," but the parents are already aware that Billy told his friend Mike not to tell anybody whether he was there or not.
Wow. Discredit, deflect, deny, distract. Textbook.
Excited to see those start to disappear.
One of these is very clearly a professional journal. The other two run tabloidesque headlines and show very obvious bias - but bias that resonates with the base as a dogwhistle that doesn't feel like bias to those that would defend the sites.

Seriously: "Stormy Says" and "Stripper Storms Courthouse" should be on the rags in the Dollar General checkout aisles.
What's hilarious is that by denying that he employed Cohen, Hannity is putting that attorney-client privilege at serious legal risk. Either he changes his tune if questioned under oath, or he risks every relevant private communication he had with Cohen being open to warranted search and seizure, and by extension, dissemination to the public.
Hey, that comment sounds like legal advice to me. This conversation is now privileged! Take *THAT*, FBI!
Shit, they've *both* had MVP years back to back. Russ with the triple double average again, and Harden is doing the same stuff he did last year. Since Westbrook fell off the face of the media Earth, Harden gets heavily scrutinized two years in a row, especially with LeBron also having an MVP caliber season - and you know how bad we LBJ fans can be when he's having a good year and isn't the MVP favorite.
JFC don't even *try* and post something positive about Josh Allen or suggest that Josh Jackson and Derrius Guice are better fits than Denzel Ward and Saquon Barkley on /r/Browns unless you want 30+ people calling you a moron.

See I'm more of a proponent of religion as a personal, rather than societal, construct (i.e. you take from it the things that will make you a better person, which you can do from any type of church, regardless of the leadership structure - if it wasn't clear, I'm not a very religious person, so perhaps my opinion should hold less weight than those who are), but I definitely see where you're coming from. Thanks for the info (and not being a dick at all despite this conversation starting with what could have been taken as an attack on you), that's quite enlightening.
>Google apostolic succession Bishop of Rome for a ton of articles for Catholic claims. No serious scholar disputes Catholics tracing the Pope all the way back to Peter. Thatâs a given in theology, what they question is whether or not the successors to Peter have the ability to pass down the Holy Spirit or if that power ended with the death of the Apostles.

So it's a pyramid. Peter blessed some dude, that dude blessed fifteen people, those fifteen each blessed ten, and now all of the people blessed by a person who was blessed by a person etc etc etc who was blessed by a person who was blessed by Peter is somehow the true conduit of God? 

>And yes they are two different things. Just look at the practical implications of sola scriptura. Look at the theological differences between Protestant groups and even a quick glance will show you that they believe much more widely different theology than do Catholics and Orthodox communities. The implication of interpreting a book versus belonging to an organization founded by the Apostles is plain as day.

The implication of interpreting a book rather than having a person blessed etc by Peter interpret a book for you, you mean? Because I really don't see how that oral tradition is superior to the written tradition of the Bible - the written tradition is less open to poor interpretations, less prone to mistakes in retellings, etc. There's a reason society progressed from oral tradition to written tradition and not the other way around.
Gregg runs a very aggressive zone scheme with his corners. It requires great technique (why McCourty was very good much of last year, until his athleticism was taken advantage of) and ball skills, besides the ability to play with only a single deep safety for help. Jackson is far above the rest of the class in those regards, and as a plus, his size is much more conducive to that aggressive style.
Brett Favre. Tyrod Taylor. Carson Wentz.
Yeah it's scary, because you can't see the future, but god damn there's so much potential for not just greatness but full on excellence. I like the safety and relative comfort of Rosen and even Mayfield better, but if you're betting on ceiling with any of the other three, Allen is the only pick.
>They worship a real person that they actually can trace contact with

Proof?

>Bible Christianity is just picking up and book and doing what you think it says to do.

So... Following the only recorded copies of the teachings of Jesus isn't the same as following the teachings of Jesus?
The drugs are film.
That confirms my personal opinion that Darnold is QB4 so I'm going to believe that now.
Sounds like a lot of the people in this sub when anybody mentions Josh Allen, tbh. I'm personally sick of it.
Except the whole Trubisky thing... But yanno.
Fucking thank you. Everybody with an ounce of name recognition - no matter the position, age, or even talent or ability - gets posted here as a potential target and it's just irritating.
Dude it's Silky.
1 Rosen

2a Mayfield (if the GM wants a more ready prospect)

2b Allen (if the GM wants a less ready prospect with a cavernous ceiling)

3 Darnold
Yeah that's patently ridiculous, especially with the juggernaut NDSU team - clearly the best team in the entire FCS even without Wentz - taken into account.
Josh Jackson is a much better aggressive zone CB than either Ward or Alexander, which fits Gregg's scheme much better.
Kizer was nowhere near the prospect Goff was. Kizer had glaring unfixable issues, especially with his slow eyes, and had horribly inconsistent footwork.
And then the immediate flip to "I knew it all along" as soon as Allen starts and actually is good, exactly like what happened with Wentz.
And I want Allen a hell of a lot more than I want Darnold.
Rocket beats all three. 

#JOSH ALLEN CONFIRMED
Me too, and I trust Hue quite a bit. More than most on this sub, at least.
Josh Jackson is a better corner for Gregg Williams's defense than Denzel Ward. You also have the best interior penetrator in the class - Mo Hurst - and the best designated pass rusher in the class - Harold Landry - on the board, as well as the best between-the-tackles runner - Derrius Guice.
Shon Coleman isn't a hole. I'd rather add an excellent zone corner, a fantastic interior penetrator, or a designated pass rusher. Two of Josh Jackson, Mo Hurst, and Harold Landry, please!
The fact that he has Rosen at -20% has me convinced the Browns are taking him, because Grossi is a moron and rarely gets anything right.
You're saying Apostolic Christians *don't* worship the main character in an incomplete story contained in a book complied 350 years after the events?

Sounds to me like they do; they just take the additional ridiculous step of claiming to be the only true followers of Jesus.
>If you arenât a member of an Apostolic Church that can trace its history bishop by bishop to the Apostles you arenât a Christian

/r/gatekeeping
He'll be able to play closer to the line. Peppers, due to his instincts and anticipation as well as the cornerbacks' subpar play, would have had to backpedal much further than Randall should have to, and since the Angel position lines the FS up at the spot he would backpedal to, Randall will line up and play closer to the line.
Maybe prioritize your human companion over your keebs?
The risk is a lot higher than Rosen or Mayfield on the field, but only marginally higher than Darnold - neither is startable at their floors anyway.
Gotta be Allen. If we're betting entirely on upside for the future, Allen has the highest, and is the best equipped to reach it with his work ethic and intelligence.
Jamar is moving to the dime at the very least. Wilson could kick him all the way to ST.

Randall has better instincts and anticipation, plus our corners are *much* better.
The draft honestly shouldn't play much into our success this year. For once, we really don't have any enormous holes coming into April.
I think we were allowed to make one pick. We had somebody from England announce the pick, and they began it with their title, so we wound up with Duke Johnson II.
I'm convinced you're just trolling now. Bosh and Wade better than Rose? Lmao.

>Fuck your cousin.

Roll tide
To my admittedly undertrained eye, it doesn't look like he misses because he's trying to throw too hard. The ball looks effortless on most of his throws. It seems more like an issue with his footwork, especially considering how much more accurate he gets when he throws from off platform.
He's the absolute best at hitting intermediate sideline routes before the DB has a chance to jump them. That's where his strength is, not 70 yards downfield. I figured "throw with power" would imply that, because that's where usable arm strength comes into play in the NFL.
Throw accurately from off platform. Throw with strength. Gain yards with his feet. Reportedly his work ethic and intelligence are stellar as well.
Carson was a project. Similar concerns to Allen. He just had a juggernaut around him (which didn't miss a beat without him) and played against FCS defenses, which are worse than MW defenses.
What's wrong with a prospect coming from Bama?
Tyrod Taylor. Just off the top of my head. 

He's also best in class at throwing off platform, which points to a mechanical issue causing inaccuracy from the pocket, corroborating Jordan Palmer's diagnosis.
One of us has watched the film, and it's clearly not you.
Mayfield is attractive, Rosen is kind of a cute dopey face (sad hound dog vibes?), and I can see the farm boy charm in Allen. But yeah Darnold is just a blockhead.
I think you mean better.
Ah, that's why project Carson Wentz went #2 overall while the polished Cody Kessler went in the 3rd round.
Exactly. There's a reason Darren Sproles or Reggie Bush aren't going to Canton. You have to be literally the very best to ever bounce outside (Barry Sanders) to be a hall of fame back. I'm not willing to bet on that ability with Barkley, and I'm not willing to bet that he suddenly decides to start running between the tackles. Not with a top 5 pick, anyway.
Rather, his ghost. Tim Couch died in 1999.
I love his partner. "What the fuck are you talking about?"
And Watson threw the highest percent of interceptable balls in the league I believe. Low velocity gives the defense time to get to the ball. Allen, Rosen, and Mayfield have sufficiently strong arms that there's no worry.
"He just makes plays" isn't a reason to take a QB. That's how you draft a Tebow. 

Darnold is very much Bortles.
Darnold has drifted to my 4, and Rosen/Mayfield/Allen are my 1a through 1c depending on what I value as a hypothetical GM. With a good starting QB and a solid backup and mentor to keep the rookie on the bench, and with a very well respected QB-centric coaching staff, I'm very comfortable taking Allen and his stellar work ethic and intelligence.
For me, it's actually analyzing his tape and seeing all the uncoachable stuff jump off, like it does off of Wentz's film. Then looking at the intangibles - incredible work ethic, very strong intelligence both on and off the whiteboard - and seeing a guy who has enormous headroom and the ability to get there.
I trust Allen. Stellar work ethic, great intelligence on and off the board, very strong uncoachable traits and the tools to quickly learn and fix the coachable stuff from a very very competent QB-centric coaching staff.
Nah, Baker and Rosen are better. More accurate from the pocket, better anticipation, faster read speed.
Exactly. Allen's arm strength shines best on intermediate out routes - I saw one where I thought for sure he left it about a half a second too late - an eternity - but he lasered it in and let the receiver tiptoe it in bounds with a very well-placed pass.
>only good at stretching the field vertically

Has to be. Gordon excels on short slants and such, and Coleman is a huge threat on screens and other short YAC routes.
Boi I swear if the strike takes out a season right when we're actually poised to be competitive...
Don't forget Schwartz
He *is* a slot receiver - a prototype slot receiver who has performed very well when tasked as the #1 target. His route running and hands are stellar, as is his awareness and feel for the defense.

You're deluded. 

And somehow, even in that magical fairyland where Deng is an All Star, Boozer and Noah contributed immebsely despite playing 59 and 48 games respectively, Brewer, Gibson, and Asik were elite in any facet of the game but weren't asked to start, and FUCKING KURT THOMAS was great, you're saying that playing on a team with Dwayne fucking Wade and Chris Bosh - both of whom are better than *anybody* not named Rose on that Chicago team - isn't a reason to discount LeBron's performance?
Nah. Noah was not anywhere near his 2013 level and was injured much of the year, as was Boozer. Luol Deng is aggressively average, Keith Bogans sucks, and Kurt Thomas and Taj Gibson started meaningful games. Ronnie Brewer, CJ Watson, Kyle Korver, and Omer Asik are not a strong bench, but all of them played 80 games.
You are a very poor excuse for a troll and a disappointment to all internet tricksters.
LeBron added 40+ wins to the Cavaliers. From 61 with him to 19 without him. Kobe, though great, didn't have that kind of impact.
Dude. Rose carried that team to the top seed in the East. He was pretty clearly the best player in basketball that year, and LeBron himself said he thought Rose should win MVP. 

Take LeBron off of that Heat team and Wade and Bosh are still easily in the playoffs. 

Take Rose off that Bulls team and they might not even win 20. They were as bad as the 2005-2010 Cavs in terms of the supporting cast around their star.
I'd call him the consistent #2. He can't carry a team the way LeBron showed he still can - those 2015 Finals were fucking insane, and Dellavedova was arguably his best supporting player. Westbrook and Harden, as well as Curry and a few others, are in the conversation too though.
If he's not cranky anymore by Sunday - maybe you could convince him to give that momentum a try and cut it out entirely? I have a few good friends who quit smoking that way (although several took it up again).
I vote no, just because of Sum 41's song Dave's Possessed Hair.

We need a universal messaging system like WhatsApp to become standard - or at the very least, we need RCS to take over for SMS.
Also another reason to be /r/antiMLM
Third option, but he should definitely line up on the outside
As far as his all around game, yeah Chubb is better. But Landry is a much better pass rusher. Especially as Chubb seems to rely a bit too much on physical dominance, which won't work in the NFL.
Senastionalized and false in the same way that "Allen only has height and arm strength" is sensationalized and false.
I want him and J.C. Jackson late in the draft. Far more talented than their draft slots.
Nor is Chubb far above the other DEs. Landry is a better pass rusher, and Davenport is a similar, if less polished, all around end.
Funny that Israel never existed during Hitler's lifetime.
>That's not even necessarily true. It's a lot harder to hit something with bullets than it is to stab something. All sorts of other variables as well

Stab something from 15 feet away, then stab something next to it, then something next to that. Unless you're Inspector Gadget, you're gonna have a hard time. 

>But as for other "weapons" - what gets banned? Everyday items like knives and tools? How is that not asinine? Banning items that are primarily non-weapons is a good road to go down?

Switchblades are banned in many areas, because they're used *primarily* for violence against others. I assume similar logic would apply. 

>Do we not have other interests at play like life, liberty and property?

Yes - in that order. So somebody's life is more important than somebody else's rights, and both are more important than property.
Man we sure do have a problem with all those illegal switchblades that criminals get on the black market, don't we?
His feet aren't great. And he's a hell of a lot more accurate from off platform, which points to a mechanical issue.
That's absolutely ridiculous. I have watched the games. I posted the damn every-throws for my own personal use.
Allen had an atrocious offense around him, and MW defenses are better than FCS defenses. Wentz had a far easier time than Allen. Allen's film doesn't show a guy with 56% ball placement.
Speed with which he goes through his progressions. Kizer was one of the worst I've seen at that - alongside Geno Smith - and Allen's is ridiculous.
Are you kidding? Allen's eye speed is ridiculous. And his ball placement is consistently better than his completion percentage implies - not saying it's Rosen level, but it isn't bad.
His mechanics were atrocious! His accuracy was mediocre - 62% on by far the best team in the FCS, against FCS defenses.
Hell of a write-up. He articulates what I've seen on film much better than I can.
And to be absolutely fair, he was kind of trash by that time. He was just holding on because the fans absolutely worshipped him thanks to 1987-1989.
They had real WRs until about week 2. That killed them. Their team was better than ours - mostly because they didn't have any enormous holes at QB or in the defensive backfield.
It's important to qualify - either confirm or dispute - those analytical projections with study based on film. Allen's film disputes those projections.
That's 100% hindsight. He had a lot of questions, especially related to mechanics and ball placement.
Yes he absolutely was. It was the main reason I was against him. We didn't have the infrastructure in place to develop a project QB in 2016. We do in 2018.
You act like I have an annotated and chopped up set of game films or something. I'm just a hobbyist.
So you don't want the best QB in the class in five years? You didn't want Carson Wentz because he wasn't that great a QB *right now* coming into the draft?
Statistics, film study, and projection based on both can *coexist* in a front office, isn't that a novel concept? Allen on film shows a lot of positive traits that translate to the NFL, and a projection taking into account our competent starting QB, experienced backup and mentor, and well respected QB-centric coaching staff - as well as Allen's stellar work ethic and intelligence - will show a good probability of fixing stuff like lower body mechanics, which will fix his accuracy.
I had similar feelings about Wentz that I do about Allen - I thought he was a two year project. But Wentz's intelligence, work ethic, and physical ability allowed him to start at a high level his rookie year.
He needs serious mechanical work with his feet and kinetic chain, his accuracy when kept clean leaves a good bit to be desired, his decision making is suspect, as is his ability to read the field quickly. Those are all fixable, but it will take time. He won't be ready day 1, and I'm not sure he'll be ready to take over in 2019.
Yes, but Kessler was basically a finished product out of college. Not much coachable headroom. He was a better QB coming out of college than Allen (or Darnold) will be, and people weren't upset that we went to the seasoned veteran over him. 

NYG doesn't have a better team than we do. We had enormous issues at QB, WR, FS, CB, and RB last year, issues that have been solved before the draft. The rest of the team was quite solid, and still is.
He's not even close to comparable to Lynch. He's much more Wentz.
Both of which took QBs with serious flaws.
Carson Wentz went #2 overall and this sub has been furious about passing on him since last year.
His accuracy is mechanical. That's very coachable. 

Hue Jackson is a terrific QB-centric coach who is very well respected around the league for his work at the position, as is Ken Zampese. 

Why hedge your bet on the chance that the coaching staff might get fired by not taking the best prospect?

Allen is not much more of a project than Darnold, and his ceiling is vastly higher. Mayfield's ceiling is pretty laughable in comparison, as is Rosen's. 

Allen's tape shows much better ball placement, anticipation, accuracy off platform, eye speed, and pocket poise than the stats imply.
Darnold is nearly as much a project as Allen.
Film.
Not making excuses, just evaluating him through the lens of a project. If you're evaluating who the best QB is right now, it's Rosen or debatably Mayfield, and it's not even close back to Darnold in third. Evaluating as a project, though, puts Allen on top, followed by Jackson, then Darnold and Rosen and Mayfield.
0-5 is very possible with Kizer at QB. 0-5 is impossible with a QB better than Kizer. 

Did it piss fans off to go to McCown over Kessler when Griffin went down? It shouldn't have. And Kessler was far more NFL-ready than Allen or Darnold are.
Stanton is a capable backup. He's better than any of our three QBs from last year.
You're wrong.
It's not a lens to fit Allen's best attributes. It's the lens through which you scout any project QB. He measures better than Wentz through that lens, but Wentz measured very well through it.
First, 0-5 is just not a possibility with the roster we have. Second, Tyrod is the starter, and I don't think that anybody in the organization would be on board with a kneejerk benching unless Allen is absolutely lighting it up in practice or something - and even then, the feeling I've gotten from the entire organization is that the rookie WILL NOT START in 2018. Third, Stanton is a capable backup, and if Tyrod were to be hurt or otherwise incapable of playing, I have a strong feeling Stanton would play.
I'll be very excited and optimistic, I'm not going anywhere if we draft the prospect with the highest upside. Even if we take Mason Rudolph #1 overall, I'm still a fan, but yeah that would be a huge disappointment.
They also lacked touch, eye speed, decision making, accuracy from off platform, and pocket poise, all of which Allen has.
:( I have faith in Daddy Dorsey. But I feel it.
Fair, I'll edit.
Eye speed isn't fixable.
How is that not Cleveland? We finally have the infrastructure in place to let a guy sit a year or two, as well as two of the most respected QB coaches in the league in Hue Jackson and Ken Zampese.
I do, just not when the flawed rookie is forced to start day 1 because of the dearth of talent at QB. That just cements bad habits. 

Tyrod Taylor is the undisputed starter. Drew Stanton is a veteran backup and great locker room presence and mentor. Hue Jackson and Ken Zampese are very well respected QB-centric coaches in the NFL. Todd Haley is very well versed in creating offenses that can be successful with disparate QBs - he won with Ben, Vick, and Landry Jones.
Sorry, that was a bit rude. And for the record, any namecalling I do is probably for a joke - especially if it's something silly like pleb or dingus. I don't mean it in a dickish way.
His tape is better when you're looking at what you use to evaluate a project like Allen (or Darnold or Jackson) - uncoachable traits. He's the absolute best QB prospect through that lens.
Yeah that's more the media people, especially the local guys who see Johnny 2.0.
Nope, it's almost like I can like one QB over another but still like them both - and Jesus Christ does Allen get bashed, so yeah I'm setting the record straight on him. But he's my #3.
Allen's is elite as well. The film I've watched, he looks better off platform than Darnold does.
>When the actual stats suggest his receivers where above average in terms of drops

Drops are one of the least reliable stats - I remember Greg Little consistently not getting drops recorded against him. And they don't count passes where if the receiver runs a bit harder or makes his cut a bit stronger, the ball is perfectly on target, which I see on Allen's tape a lot. 

>If I'm taking a project (which I don't want to do) it's easily Darnold.

Nah. Darnold is better right now, but in 5 years, Allen has a higher probability of being the best in the class. Besides, Darnold is better than Allen much like Bortles was better than Tebow - neither is startable, and neither helps win you games, so there's no reason to use that floor as an argument. Allen is just a much better prospect.
Yes, I mean Tyrod "Quality starter with woefully few of the traits Josh Allen has" Taylor.
He's a lesser Duke as a runner. I'll pass. I'd rather have Royce Freeman, who is my sleeper pick.
>sub 55 completion percentage

Lmao [that's not even close to true](https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/josh-allen-7.html). And if you haven't seen his gorgeous throws on the move, or his ability to move through his progressions, you haven't watched anything but cherrypicked lowlight reels. I could put together a reel of Darnold or even Rosen missing easy reads - Mayfield would be tough because he just had a lot of open receivers and nearly always found them. I won't, because I believe in journalistic integrity, but I could. 

And using his stats as a "well if he was better he'd have better stats" is a ridiculous argument. His film, his ball placement, his traits are all better than his stats suggest. Yeah he needs work, but not much more than Darnold - and he's got one of the best work ethics in the class. If we're going with a project, Allen is the top choice.
Yep. A quick hit on a slant and a hand in the chest of the defender led to a ton of yards for him.
He's a more complete end, but he's not a better pass rusher. He's much more Ogbah than Garrett. We don't need another Ogbah - we need a guy on passing downs who can let Ogbah kick inside (or hit the bench if we land a second penetrating DT like Hurst to pair with Ogunjobi).
I know it's a positive for Darnold. It's an even bigger positive for Allen. 

Allen has questions on his mental acumen? He's fantastic on the whiteboard and scored best in class on the Wonderlic, and that certainly shows on film as his processing speed is high.
Disagree. Allen's accuracy from off platform is better than Darnold's, and his accuracy when kept clean isn't much worse than Darnold's. That points to a mechanical issue for both. Allen has a lot of unteachable positives that Darnold doesn't have.
True, but that's a copout and we can't hold the 2018 draft retroactively in 2021. As prospects, Landry is a better pass rusher than Chubb.
That's to override a veto. You hypothetically have no executive to veto.
He seems like very much a product of Josh Rosen to me.
True. Just technically he was available.
JG thrives on slants too though. Our receivers are all YAC monsters - Gordon, Coleman, Njoku, and Duke all have stupid athleticism, and Landry has a knack for finding a soft spot where he can turn upfield.
When he was clearly a better run defender than pass rusher. He's much more Ogbah than Garrett. Landry is the best pass rusher in the draft, and would be a fantastic rotational DPR, much moreso than Chubb.
And when we did, Crowell was one of the least efficient backs in the league, putting our offense - and Kizer - in far too many behind-the-sticks situations.
Regardless, if the executive branch can't perform its functions, the country falls into disarray as nothing can be accomplished in the legislature without a presidential signature.
Hey who do I got?

The cognitive dissonance is hilarious. 

>Darnold reported as likely #1 pick

"Haha yes all of these sources are correct, why would we like about who we're taking? The media says that this project QB will be good so I'm all aboard the Darnold Express!"

>Allen reported as likely #1 pick

"Holy shit these journalists are hacks and probably getting paid, this is such an obvious smokescreen to see what we the fans think of him as a possible pick. The media says this project QB will suck, so anybody but Allen! If we take Allen I riot!"

And just for funsies â¹ï¸

>Rosen not reported as likely #1 pick

"Wow, what a smokescreen, we're playing 16D Backgammon and totally taking Rosen. We have the most airtight FO and decision makers in the history of ever. We're gonna shock the world! My proof is that there's no smoke, and when there's no smoke, it's obvious that there's fire!"

>Mayfield not reported as likely #1 pick

"HEE HEE! Pied Piper! Baeker Baeker Touchdown Maker!"
He's MUCH better than Kizer. Accuracy off platform, eyes, touch... So many traits he has that Kizer didn't. And those aren't teachable.
Didn't we not have a lead all season until like the Titans game? Or was it the Vikings?
Ew god no

We need a QB. Why are some people so afraid of using our top pick on the position of greatest need, especially when there are five consensus first round prospects?
Mayfield or Allen would be absolutely glorious if they turned out to be our franchise QB, just because of the amount of shit people would be forced to eat. 

... I might be a bit too excited to tell people "I told you so" about both of them.
Lasley is consistently disappointing on Rosen's film. I'd pass. I really honestly think Jordan Payton was a better receiver and is still the best Rosen has had.
I'm not sure I follow. If the executive branch is vacant, how can it perform its functions? It would be the same as if it were nonexistent.
Still am. I just recognize that he's not the best prospect. Allen has a much higher ceiling. I'd rather bet on floor with Rosen and Mayfield, but good god if we're betting on upside, we have to take Allen.
Who has better attainable upside? Nobody.
That's fair. I just see the things Darnold does well and can't help but think "Allen does that better, Rosen does this better, Baker does the other better". He's also pretty woefully inaccurate when kept clean - not on the level of Allen, but pretty bad.
Film.
I'd rather have an executive branch than not have one. Checks and balances are important, and taking away one of those checks would be more detrimental than having even a caricature of Trump in the White House.
I meant the best prospect at QB ya dingus. Allen brings a hell of a lot more than height and arm strength, and if you don't see it, you're just being willfully ignorant. He's the best QB in the class throwing off platform. He has very good eyes, pocket poise, and a very fast release. He has good touch.
He's easily the best QB prospect.
God you're so wrong. His eyes are so much better than Kizer's, better at throwing off platform, better pocket poise, better decision making.
I really get the feeling that Dorsey isn't going to get cute with this.
Y'all burn down the city if you want, we'd be getting the best prospect in the draft, to pair with an undisputed starting QB, a very strong mentor, two very well respected QB centric coaches, and an offensive coordinator who has developed offenses for players with disparate skillsets, including one with a very similar set to Allen.
Yeah. The class isn't as top-heavy as, say, 2016 or 2012, but there's talent to be had at the top. The real question for those at the top is whether you want a high floor (Rosen/Mayfield), an astronomical ceiling (Allen/Jackson), or some sort of medium ground (Darnold), and which do you think your coaching staff can get the most of with the time you have.
Until 2020, when it's a party of Cleveland.
Under what circumstances would it hypothetically become vacant? Unless implicated in whatever hypothetically would depose Trump, Pence would take over as president.
Allen, Josh Jackson, and Mo Hurst/Harold Landry is an incredible day 1. Idc what you say, that's a party waiting to be thrown.
Considering there are three QBs I think are sure-fire starters at minimum (Rosen and Mayfield have such a short way to go, and I'm almost certain one of Allen, Darnold, or Jackson will land in the proper situation to develop properly - I'm leaning heavily towards Allen, especially in Cleveland, but dear god if one of those three goes to Buffalo they're screwed like Kizer was) this is probably the best class since 2004, right? Aside from late round surprises, have there been any drafts with three bonafide starters since then?
The best prospect at 1, and the Bills knocking down our door for 4 with Baker or Rosen on the board... Nearly ideal, although I'd prefer the high floor of Rosen or Mayfield.
If all you think Allen has is height and arm strength, you're doing everybody a disservice. He has very good accuracy when throwing from off platform - better even than Darnold - has incredible work ethic, great intelligence on and off the board, good eyes, decent pocket poise, and very good touch - he's not Weeden. He looks a hell of a lot like Wentz did coming out, and I think with Taylor, Stanton, and the QB-centric offensive coaching staff of Hue, Zampese, and Haley, we're finally in position to draft a Wentz-like prospect - whereas we weren't in 2016.
That's a loser's mentality. You shoot your shot. If it ends up being Bortles, oh well, you've still got a team around him and can continue to build it while the QB learns and improves - helped by the fact that he will not start in 2018. If it ends up being Wentz or Favre or Eli or Brees/Wilson, you're set.
Kessler also had extremely little physical talent. He was like if Rosen had a noodle arm, poor eyes, no pocket poise, and poor escapability - his only positive on the field was his mechanics. Allen has all the physical, uncoachable talent in the world to go with his work ethic and smarts.
Boller's deep touch was leagues below Allen's, and his pocket poise was absolutely non-existent - he felt pressure, and he'd just cringe away from it rather than escaping or taking the hit, like Allen does. Neither of those are coachable.
That's so childish.
Nobody doctored it, but internet scouts sure are abridging it to look worse than it is.
His eyes are so much better than Cam's, though, and he has a better feel for the game.
... not really?
He has a completely stellar work ethic, and is incredibly intelligent on and off the whiteboard. That alone puts him miles above JaMarcus.
We have Tyrod to start, Stanton to mentor, Hue and Zampese to teach, and Haley to design an offense to his strengths. I'm very optimistic. 

I'd wish it was Rosen or Mayfield, but I totally understand how ceiling is more important long term than floor, and we have the time to make decisions based on the long term. 

Gut reaction? At least it isn't Darnold.
Connor is a RT. I don't like his pass pro enough to entertain him at LT. If we take a tackle to groom at LT, we need to take Okorafor.
As a runner, he honestly reminds me of Duke. Small, good slasher, and surprising power to finish runs a lot better than his frame would suggest. I don't think he can be a feature back, much like Duke, and in situations where we'd run with him, Duke would do just as well.
Josh Jackson at #2 ð
Thing is, Allen's ball placement is much better than his completion percentage suggests - especially when he throws from off platform.
Darnold is pretty bad accuracy-wise from in the pocket, though. That's mechanical, and fixable, but when you move them both off their platform, they both shine - and Allen shines more than Darnold off platform.
The tape isn't even close though.
Please god yes, if it's Allen or Darnold, Allen is by far the better pick.
We had practically no choice but to start Kizer. Going into the season with Hogan and Kessler will do that. That meant Kizer had no chance to develop or learn. 

Tyrod Taylor makes the situation far different. And Darnold should sit at least one and probably two years anyway, so there's not really much difference there. Neither is startable off the bat.
You mean they vote for the party that literally let the government shut down because they didn't get everything they wanted? Makes sense.
Is rookie Bortles as bad as Tebow? No. But neither is startable on a team trying to compete. Hell, I'd call the much-improved 2017 Bortles just borderline startable. Darnold as a prospect is much like Bortles was. And honestly his personality seems very similar, and Bortles didn't work as hard as he could have to improve.
He's better when blitzed than when not, thanks to his quick eyes and release. I love Rosen, he's my #1. But he has his flaws, and they're not fixable. He's a quite capable quarterback as is, and he could get to an Eli Manning type level (which is damn good, for the record), but he's just as likely to stay near his floor, which would be a fringe top 20 starter from day 1.
Nah he was best against Minnesota and Detroit by far.
Exactly. Although I've been leaning more towards Eli with Rosen.
So Hue Jackson and Ken Zampese aren't very well respected in the NFL for their work with QBs? Todd Haley hasn't shown a proficiency at building successful offenses for the extremely disparate Ben Roethlisberger, Michael Vick, and Landry Jones?
So Darnold is mocked at 1 because he's likely to succeed, but Allen is mocked at 1 because he isn't likely to succeed?

And sure I'd rather have 2014-2016 Bortles than Tebow (even with a fast release and good eyes), but those aren't floors I'd actually want, and neither helps you win games. If we're taking a guy with a floor that isn't playable in the NFL, why not take the one with drastically more potential and a stellar work ethic?
I take the under, just because I don't think he's the best QB in the draft in 5 years. He will be the best immediately though. God I want him to be Peyton so badly but I really don't think he gets there. Conversely, there's a serious chance that Bortles, Wentz, Wilson, or Vick get the development they need and surpass the Manning brother. And I think the Browns have the staff to develop a QB.
Assuming no development, your assessment is correct - as long as you feel rookie Bortles to be safe. 

We have a coaching staff built to develop a QB, though. Hue Jackson and Ken Zampese are highly respected around the league on their work with QBs, and Todd Haley is an offensive mastermind who has built successful schemes for pocket passers, big mobile QBs, and small speedy QBs alike. 

Allen just reminds me too much of Wentz when I put on the film. Let him develop - whether it's a small tweak like Wentz ended up needing and Palmer reports Allen needs, or a long term revamp - and he's going to be ridiculous. Throw him to the wolves like Kizer was and he'll fail, but so will Darnold, and potentially even Mayfield.
I really think the draft isn't as loaded as we think at QB. 

Rosen is a strong prospect, but has his concerns - throwing under pressure, throwing off platform, and decision making when under duress are the big on-field issues, and those really don't improve through coaching and hard work. 

Mayfield has suspect arm strength, eye discipline, pocket poise, and ball placement on top of his less-than-ideal size. 

Darnold has below average arm strength, and struggles with accuracy from his regular platform, lower body mechanics, reading the field, pocket poise, and eye discipline. 

Allen struggles with accuracy from platform, lower body mechanics, eye discipline, and pocket poise. 

Basically, you have two guys who are playable day 1, but don't have stellar ceilings, a guy with a marginally better ceiling but who is far less playable day 1, and a guy with a much higher ceiling who is even less playable day 1 but has an incredible work ethic.
Fans have been wrong on far more busts than scouts. Remember when Cardale at 1 was a thing?
I think no matter what, he sits. Even Rosen or Mayfield, who IMO have floors as a bottom end starter and a mid tier backup respectively, will likely not see the field in 2018. I'd prefer either, but damn if Allen isn't a fantastic prospect.
Haha it was reddit's screwup, it's been fixed. 

Ward may be the best CB in the draft, but that's for all 32 teams. We run a bit of an unorthadox scheme that values zone proficiency, technique, aggression, and size over Ward's strengths of athleticism and man proficiency. See how McCourty, less athletic with better technique, thrived over Taylor last year. Jackson is a better McCourty, while Ward has more in common with Taylor - much more talented, don't get me wrong, but the play style is similar.

And absolutely. Hurst, Landry, even Payne or Vea.
Could say the same about Darnold though, and Allen has a higher ceiling and an absolutely stellar work ethic.
Dave-te is the guy you're thinking of, the ex Giants scout.
Unpopular opinion, but with an established starting QB and three highly respected offensive and QB specialists on the staff, it's a better choice than Darnold.
So if we the fans are so against Allen, but respected scouts who do this for a living are high on him - maybe we don't know what we're talking about. Maybe the important part of his evaluation isn't the stats, but rather the traits he exhibits on tape. 

No, no. It is the scouts who are wrong.
EVERYBODY PANIC
Darnold is very much like Blake Bortles the prospect. He is not a good QB. He's not startable. And he might not be startable year 2. His personality is similar, and Bortles has had difficulty improving his issues - only really showing improvement this year. 

Allen is very much like Carson Wentz the prospect. He is also not a good QB, nor is he startable. And he'll probably not be startable year two - unless, like Wentz, and like Jordan Palmer has reported, his issues are stemming from an easy-to-fix tweak to his mechanics. His ceiling is immensely higher than Darnold's, and he reportedly has an incredible work ethic. 

So if we're choosing a QB who is at least 50/50 to be ready year 2, why not take the guy with the better work ethic and the better uncoachable traits?
I can't see my comment or your reply for whatever reason - they both show up in each of our comment histories, but I can't view them to reply - but Ward is an enormous reach at 4 considering he isn't even the best CB for the Browns' board. If you pick at 4, it has to be Chubb, or if you feel differently about him than I do, Barkley. A trade down to the early to mid teens (hello Buffalo and Arizona) allows us to consider Josh Jackson, Mo Hurst, and Harold Landry, all of whom should be better fits than anybody we could conceivably consider at 4 - Jackson as a tall, aggressive, zone-skilled corner with excellent technique, Hurst as a penetrating, disruptive DT, and Landry as a very skilled rotational DPR. Getting 22 as well from Buffalo would let us target Derrius Guice, D.J. Moore, or an OT on top of any of the earlier three who could fall.
He's deleted all his old predictions (which he said he's made - in his Gordon post, his first prediction still in his Reddit post history (and I went all the way back, as much as I wanted to cringe from all the t_d posts), he complained that people always question his credibility and say they can't find his claimed previous predictions in his post history), he said Trubisky was the Browns' #1 QB and gave us a 50/50 chance of taking him - it's come out since that the Browns were gunning for Mahomes - and there's a distinct possibility that whoever leaked the Manziel and Gordon stories he broke has either dried up, left the organization, or is intentionally leaking misinformation as a part of the persistent "everybody in Berea is saying Darnold" potential smokescreen. Gamefish is just a redditor, after all. He'd be an easy-to-mislead pawn in the smokescreen, as he clearly believes anything his source tells him - if his source isn't just him making stuff up at this point, after a leak was patched.
Absolutely fair, I was just complimenting your telling of the story and thought it deserved a wider audience. Completely understand where you're coming from though.
There's way too many people on here who are serious about the whole "draft all the OSU players" thing.
So why is the floor of 60% treated as gospel when the ceiling is thrown out so easily?
Disappointed, excited, excited, optimistic.
I've got Rosen, Baker, then Allen, then Jackson. Jackson requires more work for similar upside to Allen. Both have a good bit higher upside than Darnold without much more risk.
Allen is more accurate from off platform. Allen is ridiculous on the run.
If the choice is him or Darnold, please god be Allen. If we're betting on upside of a guy who will take time to develop, let's do it right.
I'm beginning to think gamefish might be full of shit. ð¤ð¤ð¤
Fuck off, let's actually draft some good football players and not worry about where they played their college ball.
There's apparently a 0.00075% chance I am.

My only credits are from Cedar Point - I'm too poor to take a long trip and can't justify it just to go to an amusement park anyway :( so I'm not gonna post a list, but I just wanna know how people have Magnum XL as their top steel coaster? I've never had a comfortable ride on it.
When in the fuck is it okay to suggest an armed uprising as a response to a warrant being served as a part of a fair trial?
What a story - and told very well. Post this on /r/nosleep for some serious karma.
Accidental album cover?
Oh damn. I been sleepin on Frank.
I don't think any of those guys, aside from Chubb at either, James at 12, or Fitzpatrick at 12, are reasonable picks at 4 or 12. 

Also lmao at "incorrect player"

As if scheme fit doesn't matter more than what player Daniel Jeremiah says is best. As if Jackson isn't a much better scheme fit than Ward. As if Hurst isn't possibly the best scheme fit in the draft.
Agree to disagree. 

>He's got issues when pressured and when timing is off... Both of which he will see plenty of in the nfl.

True, but the thing is, he's the best in the class when the defense brings a blitz, and that behind a line that gave him routinely less than two seconds to throw. So do you take that chance as a DC and send an extra guy, knowing that if you don't get to him fast enough, he's going to absolutely pick you apart?

>it's always better to have a player better at the "uncoachable" aspects since the rest can be improved via coaching. Choosing Rosen considering that is inept since that means he needs less coaching but you're less likely to fix his flaws. Allen and Darnold need more coaching, but Darnold doesn't have the uncoachable flaws, and Allen just needs more time to develop than the others.

Rosen has a very high floor and has plusses in several of the coachable traits. Allen and Darnold will likely never have plus mechanics or pocket poise. Rosen does. So the argument is do you bet on upside and time with Darnold or Allen, or do you bet on floor with Rosen or Mayfield, which are the safer picks?

>Hue isn't going to last 2 bad seasons waiting for Allen.

Bad seasons? What part of our team with Tyrod at the helm looks poised for a bad season?
Press X to doubt
I'll make sure to provide you with a supply of plastic.
It really depends on the situation. If Darnold is expected to start day 1, odds are he follows the Bortles trajectory. If Allen gets to sit until he fixes his mechanics, he could follow in the footsteps of Wentz.
Riiiiiight. The Cavs totally aren't built to play the Warriors. The Raps are too, and have an even better bench.
Wat. The important bit is *what those flaws are*. Rosen's flaws are uncoachable. Allen's are coachable. Dude I'm a huge Rosen fan. He's QB1 for me. But acting like he has as much room to improve and as high a ceiling as Allen is asinine.
I don't think Rosen's ceiling is quite Peyton, but it's above prime Eli, who was damn good. Allen's floor is Tebow with a fast release. Darnold's floor is rookie Bortles.
A, P, and O. Hmm.
List the days of the week in English. 

I just about guarantee, if you're American, you started with Monday. Hell, Sunday is part of the week*end*. 

But what's a week anyway? Damn social constructs.
That's Rosen's *absolute floor*. You wouldn't keep rookie Matt Ryan as your starter if he was 30 and never improved. So, a backup. Odds are, he improves a lot of the little things he can improve, but he likely doesn't touch his ceiling, which is somewhere around the Manning brothers.
And you've failed your reading comprehension course. Congratulations.
I'm not suggesting a specific change in his mechanics. He answered the question as if he wouldn't (bad) or couldn't (worse) change his mechanics, even if there was something to be gained out of it.
Could you lend me that crystal ball you've got there? With your obviously concrete knowledge of the future, there's a few bets I'd like to place.
I disagree on Barkley but that's a contested opinion and we'll gain nothing from arguing about him, so let's start elsewhere. Nelson is not a Cleveland Browns prospect, not with two top 5 guards. Neither is James with Peppers and a viable backup in Kindred. Ward is not the best fit at CB for a Gregg Williams defense. Vita Vea is a space eater, not the type of penetrating disruptive DT Gregg Williams likes. Payne at 4... Wat? Hurst is a much better fit. Edmunds is so raw that there's no guarantee he develops into anything good, and Roquan is a bit undersized to play a single gap system where the DL penetrates and leaves the OL to block the second level. So... Good god, no.
The concussions are worrying, sure, but any QB is just an injury or two from being out of the league - see Cody Kessler, with a clean NCAA bill of health. The shoulder, however, is not. It hasn't affected his throwing ability, and in fact, he came back throwing better than ever - as did Allen with his injury. 

I don't give a shit about an athlete using his platform and his time to be an activist. And his personality may be closer to Manziel than Brady, but so is Rodgers. 

Rosen's mistakes (yes, I admit he makes them, as shocking as that might be to you) mostly stem from trying to do too much - instead of throwing the ball away or taking a sack, he tries to force a pass. Or, late in a game, he throws a risky pass to try and make up a deficit. 

Glad you have a personal connection to Dorsey and know that he doesn't like him. But yeah, in terms of becoming an elite QB, the post confirms that Darnold is better at several of the innate characteristics, while Rosen dominates the coachable traits. But Allen is even better than Darnold at the uncoachable stuff, and his mechanics should be as easy as Darnold's to fix.
Actually it's the asshole. Just like you.
They are in my behind
Those things *can't* be fixed. They're innate, intrinsic qualities of a QB. Sure a certain player might not be able to fix his coachable issues. But that's just the 62% chance of failure from a first round QB. And be honest, if your failure cases are Tebow with an actually good release or 2014-2016 Bortles, is there really a difference? I'd rather pick the guy with a failure case of rookie Matt Ryan - a serviceable backup - like Rosen, or a solid backup like Mayfield. But if we're betting on upside, Allen has it in spades, and isn't a much more disastrous failure than Darnold in the worst case.
Wentz had 62% completion percentage, decreasing every year, and played on an absolute juggernaut. That's not "playing well".
And I never called that into question once you claimed it.
His floor is not significantly lower than Darnold's, and it's higher than Jackson's. Tebow with a fast release or Bortles are both not going to win you any games. He has a higher ceiling than anybody else, though, because his main issues are footwork and mechanics, affecting his consistency and accuracy. Those are fixable. And his work ethic and intelligence mean they should be fixed. Rosen won't improve his off platform throws. Mayfield won't improve his pocket poise. Darnold won't improve his decision making. Those all hamper ceilings, and they're not fixable traits.
Yeah I'm a bit mad. You question my findings on the QBs because I'm young, or because I might not have watched football for long enough, or because I didn't play football (I was very young for my grade and graduated high school before I hit my growth spurt, so I was way too small to play any organized sports), or because I don't have a dream job with an NFL franchise. 

I didn't question that you put work in, just said that we clearly have different priorities with a QB, and yours don't include any of Allen's positives. The "calling yourself an expert because you read Bucky and Mel" wasn't an attack on you, it was just explaining why reading scouting reports doesn't really mean much in terms of actually evaluating a prospect - it's just leaning on somebody else's evaluation.
>They are each unique prospects with different strengths and weaknesses and, as a result, very different pro potential.

Uh... Duh? It's just that different evaluators value different traits differently.
>I've done waaayyy more "scouting" then any average fan.  

I've watched every throw from each of the top 4 in 2017. And you're questioning my scouting?

>How long have you even been watching football?  

About twenty fucking years. 

>Are you a professional football player?

How many of the talent evaluators are?

>Do you work for the NFL or an NFL franchise?

Do you? 

Fuck you.
... you're missing the point entirely. The point was that Darnold, Rosen, Mayfield, and Allen are all in the conversation for top QB with both of those analysts. When your top QB is 6 on your board, and your fourth QB is 13th, they're all in the picture, and depending on what you value, they're interchangeable.
His decision making, processing speed, and anticipation are fine. I swear you're conflating Allen with Kizer. 

He also has incredible ability from off platform, a remarkable work ethic, and a very fast release, something Joe Six-Foot-Five isn't going to have.
No, scouting reports are reports created after scouting a prospect. They're not to be used as a replacement for scouting. You can't act like an expert because you've read Bucky Brooks or Mel Kiper talk about a prospect. 

I don't see what you see in Allen. Maybe we watch for and value different aspects of a QB. I personally value a floor over upside, and so prefer Rosen, then Mayfield, but if you're going to take a chance on a guy with a sub-NFL floor like Darnold, Allen, and Jackson, take the biggest swing - and that's Allen, who has insane upside with only a marginally lower floor than Darnold.
Except Allen is actually a good prospect with stupendous upside. Would Carson Wentz have been a boneheaded move? In 2016, I said yes, because who the fuck was going to keep him on the bench for two or three years? In 2018, I say no, because we have Tyrod Taylor.
Because you can have four people in a conversation? Is that really so hard to conceptualize? Say you want dinner. You think to yourself, "I want Red Lobster. But I'm also feeling Outback Steakhouse, could go for Mission BBQ, and honestly have a craving for pizza". There's four things in the conversation.
So you just read scouting reports? That's nice. I've actually done the scouting.
McCrystal's breakdown is a case of footwork, footwork, footwork, with a bit of pocket poise thrown in for good measure. No he's not a starting QB right now. But neither is Darnold, and I'd argue neither is Baker. Give him time to learn the traits he doesn't have - and he has the work ethic to do it - and he'll be very good.
So you're saying Jeremiah doesn't have anybody in the conversation? Or is the cutoff at Baker Mayfield, one spot above Allen? And how does #4 put him out of the conversation from Casserly?
Completion rate â  accuracy. Ball placement = accuracy. Allen's ball placement is far better than 56% implies. 

He's able to read the entire field, and does it pretty efficiently. Not as well as Wentz, but it's not a weakness. 

His touch downfield is nice. He drops balls into the receiver's basket very frequently. 

When he can anticipate a receiver breaking open, i.e. a receiver is going to break open, he often throws to the spot before the receiver makes his break. 

Also, not mentioned, but holy shit is he good off platform. Folks can talk about Darnold on the move all they want, Allen is better.
Find me three reputable analysts who don't have him in the conversation. I'll wait.
Did *you* read Wentz's profile? It's very similar, and nearly every positive has an analogue with Allen.
Professionals who see him as a potential #1 pick.
Wentz played for the juggernaut of the FCS, against FCS defenses. If you say Allen should have done better because he played MW defenses, Wentz should have put up Baker Mayfield numbers against FCS defenses with the talent around him, which won a championship without him. Allen also dragged that team to 8 wins, and they lost to fucking Fresno State and SDSU without him. 

Allen and Wentz have similar play styles, builds, positives, *and negatives*. Wentz was inaccurate, and seen as a multi-year project. Shit, Wentz had mechanical issues with his arm that Allen doesn't. Both are smart as hell and have stellar work ethics.
Decision making is the art of finding the open receiver. He anticipates a receiver breaking open very well, and throws to the spot before he does break. His corps was bad enough that he didn't have the open receivers Mayfield had.
Allen actually has functioning eyes that don't stick to his first read so long he's still staring him down when he gets back to the line for the next play. Allen actually anticipates receivers breaking open and throws to the spot before they do. Allen is infinitely more accurate when throwing off platform, and is actually more accurate when throwing from a clean pocket than Kizer too.
That was one of the most painful games I've scouted. Allen does so many things right in this game. Two passes were just misses, but the rest were very catchable. His receivers were shit, letting the ball sail through their hands. His line was shit, letting him get immediately pressured off the read option PA play especially. And he clearly had no run game, given that he was asked to do it himself. But despite all that, good god if he didn't make a lot of NFL plays. That out route to the sideline - I thought he threw that late, that it was an incompletion, the first time I watched it at speed. Holy hell. And the throws off platform - he's better than Darnold throwing on the run. More accurate.
Why does every single thread have some comment bashing Allen?
>The Browns QBs has zero career wins at the beginning of the season. Donât be a douche

>has

Way to go. 

Also get your head out of the past and out of your ass.
We'd better take Rosen or Allen? Agreed.
I saw differently. I saw a guy who recognized and anticipated receivers breaking open (when they did). The risky throws seemed to be more a result of the receivers just not coming open, and Allen not being able to wait 7 seconds for them to break.
>You just think Allen looks the part.

Nice strawman. Allen is so damn much better than Kizer. Would you draft Wentz #1 overall? If so, you'd draft Allen. They're incredibly similar, with Allen having better upside.
Plus his timing at the start was awful. He didn't give the setups any chance to breathe. You can really tell when he hits his stride around 20 minutes in.
Alternatively, why would a word keep the same meaning despite adding -fore to the end?
Funny, I can only seem to remember the useless shit. All of it.
Meh, agree to disagree. If we take Darnold, I hope my fears are unfounded. I'd just prefer Rosen/Mayfield/Allen. Rosen and Mayfield because they're much safer picks with higher floors, and Allen because his potential is top in the class while having only a marginally worse floor - Bortles, remaining at his 2014-2016 level, is still a bust, just like Tebow even with a very fast release and not-trash mechanics is. Both need to improve a lot, so I'd rather bet on the HOF upside than settle for a perceived safer pick.
...............

That's a very popular opinion among scouts and pundits, though. It's not just me saying it. You're just discounting the kid because you've been told he's just like Kizer, which he absolutely is not. He's like Wentz.
I really don't like Darnold. He's QB4 for me, after watching all the film on these guys. But I see his floor being Bortles. If that doesn't improve, yeah he's a bust, but he has the ability to get better, assuming my fears about his work ethic are unfounded. (If they aren't, then yeah, he has a much higher potential to stay at his floor and bust than anybody else in the class.)
Actually very similar. I didn't like Wentz as a prospect, but looking back at him, he's incredibly close to Allen. Allen is a better prospect, with higher upside and better, just inconsistent, mechanics.
Also

>If you change Darnold's work ethic to a positive (which everyone here is telling you to do) then even by your own list he has the same amount of inherent (uncoachable) traits as Allen while also having more coachable traits locked down.  Are you aware of that?

Nah his decision making is still way worse than Allen's.
>Why on earth would we as a team who hasn't had a QB in 20 years (the most pathetic streak in NFL history?) gamble on a project with #1 overall. 

Because I trust the talent evaluators and the coaches. 

And trust me, I haven't forgotten the last 20 years - considering I'm 22. The real issue I have is that Darnold is also a big project, just with lower upside than Allen. The difference in floors is marginal - is there really a reason you'd beg for Bortles over Tebow, especially if Tim had inconsistent, not awful mechanics and a very quick release? So Allen is a better pick for the Browns than Darnold, but Rosen and Mayfield are too.
no u
Yeah for me it was in Prisoner when she hit Malfoy. That shirt ð
Right, forgot that Graham Harrell was superior to anybody else coming into the NFL in 2009, including that bum Matthew Stafford with his NCAA career 57.2 completion percentage.
National media narratives.
Oh good, you're not just closed-minded to the possibility of Allen being a good prospect, you're also a horribly opinionated Darnold Stan.
>Also take a look at the last qb we drafted. He was exactly the same thing in the nfl as he was in college. 

Couldn't have anything to do with the last QB we drafted being a bigger project than Allen or Jackson and starting day 1 because of an utter dearth of QB talent. Definitely not. 

>Edit and if all these guys rely on 7 other guys for this stat why does it seem to work for the good ones?

So every QB with a comp % greater than 60 has been successful? And how many with a comp % below 60 were considered first round talents based on traits? You're dealing with a 38% chance to hit on a QB in the first round. So few players with a comp % under 60 have been taken in the first round that there's no relevant sample size.
On literally the FCS's most dominant juggernaut, against shitty FCS defenses. And just barely at that.
Yep. Bris knows. We've had this talk before :)
And VERY nearly Wentz, who is nearly a 1 for 1 comparison to Allen, just on a FCS juggernaut against shithouse FCS defenses.
>No because itâs not an accurate stat, itâs applied correctly some of the time, some of it not, I saw how it made Kizer look even worse that he really was by failing to properly document his WRs faults, back in the Greg little days it vastly understated his issues...

And on the other side, it exaggerated Braylon Edwards's drops, corroborating your point that it's applied incredibly inconsistently.
We have three of the best, most respected QB/offensive minds in the league with Jackson, Haley, and Zampese. We'll develop a QB just fine if he doesn't have to start immediately - and that's what Tyrod Taylor is for.
And Carson Wentz regressed every year, and played against extremely soft defenses with the FCS's most dominant team, which only barely skewed his stats to mediocre. Allen is a similar prospect to Wentz.
"I don't think it's changing. My throwing motion is fine."

That's a red flag and a half, dude. 

And yeah sorry I couldn't be arsed to look up the original quotes, which are surprisingly hard to find if you don't know the exact wording. The paraphrase was accurate, though. He'd be fine being the backup â he'd be happy, and he refused to work on his arm mechanics â he doesn't think it's changing and the motion is fine. Those are both saying the same things.
It's not that I think his motion is an issue. The only problem I see with it is that it seems to fatigue him late in games. My issue with the statement is that he refused to consider changing the motion, even if it brought an incremental improvement. That speaks to a low work ethic - an unwillingness to even consider a change from something that's "good enough" for something that should be better.
Calling a guy a bust is just lazy. But I agree, Darnold's extra upside over Rosen isn't worth the risk of him staying at his Bortles floor against Rosen staying at his serviceable starter floor, and Allen's upside is so astronomically higher than Darnold's that I'd be willing to risk a Tebow with Favre-like uncoachable traits instead of bank on the Bortles floor, which still won't help you win games.
The hate against JA is absolutely baffling. Like I get if you prefer Darnold or Rosen or Mayfield, but to say he's a 100% bust and the most obvious player to stay away from is absolutely ridiculous - they also clearly don't remember Carson Wentz, a very similar prospect with numbers that were inflated to barely mediocre by playing on the FCS's most dominant team.
>I was more of that Darnold mindset. I wanted to be the #1 SP, but they told me to go to the bullpen. So I did and I was stellar to the point hey had to put me in the rotation. Then was great in the rotation. And worked my way to #1. I was the only player from my class to play in college, and I talked about it less than some of my teammates.

That's more the Rosen mindset, the "I'm gonna be the best damn backup I can be, and you bet your ass if I can compete, I will". Darnold just sounds happy to be there. 

I agree Baker's mindset can be toxic. But it's better to have supreme confidence in yourself than to say you'll just go with the flow. At least say you'll study under the starter and prepare yourself to be better, like Allen did. 

>And I donât think arm motion is the issue for Darnold. I think itâs his front leg. He doesnât step properly. He kicks out, which throws off his kinetic chain and saps energy from his throws. Him not fixing that is the red flag for me.

Incidentally, I agree (notice I gave him a check for quick release above). But that's not the issue. The issue is that he isn't open to changing it at all, because it works as it is. He won't chase after an incremental advantage if it means changing something that is good enough for him.
He's also one of a very exclusive club of players with Favre-like uncoachable traits. That group includes Wentz, who had a pretty pathetic pair of starting seasons despite playing for the FCS's most dominant team.
>Oh really?  I must have missed the part where Allen couldn't even win the award for best QB in the Mountain West Conference. 

Oh really? I must have missed the part where I said that NFL success hinges 100% on college stats and success, and Graham Harrell is the greatest NFL QB of all time. 

>You are basing your perspective on Allen based on all these attributes that you personally have no way of measuring.  You don't know Allen's decision making, the same way you don't know Darnold's work ethic.

Decision making is a trait that shows up on film. Allen is quick to throw when he sees an opening, and anticipates those openings well. He makes good throws. Darnold's work ethic may be a bit of a guess, but the quotes raise a flag, and his lack of improvement from the end of the season to his pro day point to an issue. 

>You know what we ALL know?  That Allen couldn't consistently play the game of football well in a dogshit conference.  We know that Allen struggled to complete PASSES TO WR's.  We also know that Allen (if he were to succeed) would be such an extreme outlier that you'd have to put him in the same sentence as Brett Favre, literally the only QB ever to go on and have a great NFL career after < 60% completion in college.

You know what else we all know? Allen is one of very very few prospects since Favre with the same uncoachable traits. That list includes Carson Wentz, who had poor completion percentages despite playing on the FCS's most dominant team.
That's being a good person and teammate. You can be a great person and not have the drive to improve yourself.
ð Kizer was nowhere near "all the inherent traits". Slow to process, not great off platform, and 1.5/3 on arm talent - touch was iffy, accuracy poor.
You don't want a guy who's just happy to be there. You want a guy with the drive and work ethic to make sure he's the best.
Sure you're not confusing him with Kizer? Because those are the things Kizer struggled with that Allen does not.
Carson Wentz. Brett Favre. There's your evidence.
http://m.giants.com/news-and-blogs/article-1/QB-prospects-would-embrace-being-Elis-backup/3a0e6474-5621-42a0-9be1-bfd049a009a8

>If an organization wants to draft me, it's their choice of what they do with me when I get there. So I would just be happy and make the most of any opportunity. 

Contrast with Rosen, wanting to be the best backup in the league and compete his ass off when the time comes, Allen recognizing the opportunity to learn, and Mayfield saying "fuck that". 

>The motion I have is what got me to this point, and I really haven't gotten into trouble with it," Darnold said. "It doesn't change how fast I get the ball out. If I need to shorten up and get the ball in right now, I'm able to shorten my release and get it to them. But if I need to throw it downfield, I've had a tendency of really cocking back and trying to let it go, where I just have to get my hip through more. That's something I've been working on, but I don't think it's changing. My throwing motion is fine. 

Ugh.
There's a tiny sample size of guys with the traits Allen has that also had a poor completion percentage. Hell, there's a miniscule sample size of guys with a sub 60% completion rate that have been considered first round prospects. It reeks of non-causation - the players who have bad completion percentages are bad players aside from that, so they're bad players in the NFL. Allen is not a bad player aside from that.
Eh, improve mechanics and footwork and you improve your accuracy when kept clean.
On here, yeah. Nowhere else.
Strength wasn't always ideal, and his placement could have been better. He had a tendency to throw at his receivers instead of leading them.
When's the last time you heard ANYTHING about Rosen at 1? He's my favored prospect, and I have to admit that there's no smoke at all. No smoke means no fire - it's Occam's razor.
I put in hours of scouting work and an hour of writing to make this post and this dude counters with "I disagree". Yeah I'm gonna trash him. He's shown no educated opinion whatsoever. He's just echoing the hivemind.
>nothing else

God you're willfully ignorant.
That's a very skewed bet in your favor, as [36.8% of first round QBs in the last 10 years can be classified as successes](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/agents-take-recent-draft-history-shows-first-round-qbs-are-more-likely-to-fail/). Find one Rosen Stan, one Mayfield Stan, one Darnold Stan, one Allen Stan, and one Jackson Stan and make that bet with each of them, and you're likely up $1000.
The article was just to show that these traits - all of them objectively important to a successful QB - are quantifiably coachable or uncoachable. Then, based on my own film study, and the study of other trusted talent evaluators, I marked which prospects exhibited which traits.
My favorite guy isn't Allen. First sentence. 

And Allen has put in serious work over the offseason, and *unlike Darnold*, it's shown - at the Senior Bowl, at the combine, at his pro day, etc. He's been better at each than the last.
Whereas Mayfield said he wanted to play and would do anything he could to be the best QB in the room. Huge difference. 

And if you don't see why refusing to work on something and improve it even if it isn't "bad" is an issue, you're lost.
Not a valid comparison. Kizer had shit mental processing speed, pocket poise, and decision making. Allen is far superior at all three.
Just like they have with Wentz. I'm up front and admit that I didn't like Wentz. But he was highly rated for the same reasons Allen is. He does things that just can't be taught, and he does them better than practically anybody else. Give him time and coaching, under two of the most respected QB coaches in the league, and he could be great, not good.
Ah good, a stat that relies on at least 7 players doing their job, and is skewed by one player on the other team not doing his job. You're right, I'm convinced. Allen, despite having better uncoachable traits than Rodgers, is trash and will never be successful because his stats aren't as good. Although Rodgers will never hold a candle to the GOATs Graham Harrell or Kellen Moore.
Well I mean Wentz is a solid comp for Allen. Went was better at the uncoachable traits than Bortles, just like Allen is, but Wentz, again like Allen, was a bit worse at the coachable stuff.
Excellent point, thanks for the information. I changed my mind, I agree with you now! Your "I disagree" definitely successfully counters all the information I've researched and put forward in this post.
Because it doesn't affect his play, just like Rosen's repaired shoulder doesn't affect his play. The worry with Rosen is concussions, which do have a self-causative effect, especially when experienced in close proximity to each other.
Arm strength + accuracy + touch. Having two of the three with the third being iffy was enough to bump down to Ã·.
I agree, fuck Darnold.
>made up a scouting game

Bullshit. http://insidethepylon.com/nfl/2016-nfl-draft/2016/03/17/quarterback-traits-the-attainable-versus-the-inherent/

>Josh Allen is a kid who deserves to be in the same peewee 2nd tier bunch as Mason âI only exist to give Baker Mayfield someone to kick in the groin in interviewsâ Rudolph.

Except that Allen is in all ways superior to Rudolph.
That's all I have to go by. Dorsey is doing 1 on 1 interviews with these guys, I'm not. The information I have gives me concerns there.
"I'm perfectly fine being the backup" shows complacency. 

"I'm not willing to consider working on my arm mechanics" shows that he won't work to improve something that he thinks is "good enough".
Allen is a better prospect than Rosen, Mayfield, or Darnold. It's not even close. There's just a pretty high potential of failure with any QB, and Allen's floor in the worst case scenario, if he turns out to be uncoachable, is LOW. Whereas Rosen's floor in the worst case scenario is a serviceable starter. Darnold's floor is pretty low, too, though, which few people recognize. He's very much like Bortles coming out, and could wind up never being better than 2014-2016 Bortles. That's his floor, and that's not a floor that helps win games.
No, he's not. He's bad to inconsistent at all the traits that are proven to be coachable. He's fantastic at the things that aren't coachable.
He's also got clearly the highest ceiling of anybody in the draft. And I'd be willing to accept that point, but these are the same people who crucify Sashi Brown for passing on Carson Wentz at 2, a player with similarly inconsistent coachable traits but very strong (though not to Allen's level) inherent traits. 

Also, in 2014, Blake Bortles was the first QB off the board, despite being a longer term project than any of Manziel, Bridgewater, or Carr. That's because he had the best inherent traits of the class - more on the level of Darnold than Allen, but compared to the rest, it wasn't even close. 

Teams value those inherent traits far more than you do. They also value the coachable traits far less. That's why Rosen, despite clearly being the best QB in the draft, isn't in the conversation to go #1 overall, and why Darnold, a decent mix of inherent and coachable traits, and Allen, the most inherently talented QB in the class, are the frontrunners.
His pocket poise and work ethic aren't there either. And work ethic is the most important inherent trait when it comes to realizing the coachable traits.
... you didn't even read the post, did you?
You made me write up a whole post about this. Enjoy.
The safest is easily Rosen, followed by Mayfield. They have the teachable traits better than anybody else, and are more ready than anybody else - I don't see either having to sit more than a year, and Rosen especially should be ready week 1. They're just limited by the unteachable traits. Darnold is in the middle, reasonable unteachable traits, not entirely unpolished, should sit for 2 years. Jackson and Allen are completely unpolished, but Allen has the best unteachable traits in the class, closely followed by Jackson. The timeline on both is probably around 3 years, but the upside is absolutely astronomical.
Allen is so much better than Kizer. Quick reads, good anticipation, and he's a better freelancer than Darnold is. He just displays often lazy mechanics, especially in the lower body, much like Kizer. But in all other ways, he's superior to Kizer. And for the same reasons Darnold is considered a better prospect than Rosen, Allen is the best prospect of the bunch, because he has all the things you can't teach. 

The issue is that he's less polished than anybody but Jackson, and that means he'll take more time and effort to reach that potential - 3 years of development for him and LJ seems about right, but both have the upside of being absolutely great. Contrast that with the still unpolished Darnold, who I see as a 2 year developer but who has fewer of those unteachable traits, and the relatively polished but not nearly as gifted in the unteachables Mayfield and Rosen who should be ready to start after one year or less, and you get why this class is so hotly debated. 

My stance is unless we're confident we can re-sign Taylor and use him to keep the QBOTF on the bench, we have to take Rosen or Mayfield. If we are confident in Taylor for two years but not three, Darnold is the best option, and if we think Taylor is a 3+ year option, we should take Allen.

I'm not saying Sashi would have traded for Landry, Taylor, and Randall, thus opening the floodgates. I'm saying he paved the way for those moves to be made without hamstringing the upcoming draft. I'm of the opinion that Sashi held draft picks as a bit too valuable, and wouldn't have been able to make the trades work because Buffalo doesn't take a 4 for Tyrod. 

Dorsey is clearly the catalyst, but crediting him without acknowledging what Sashi did to give the team the capital to pull off those moves is unfair to all involved.
That cap space allowed us to fill all of those holes, most with experienced young veterans. Those draft picks will allow us to set our foundation for the better part of a decade if used right. We didn't have a chance at signing a top FS or CB last year, but this year, we made aggressive moves to make the team more attractive and landed some top players.
Landry isn't a 3 down DE, but as a DPR to primarily come in for Ogbah on passing downs, we could do a hell of a lot worse.
I mean, Google Wallet saves all my cards, all I have to do is remember my CVV. It's even fucking worse. Ugh.
But who secures the AI?
And tweeting publicly about it is like calling your local PD and informing them of the route you're taking home from the bar. If they don't change their encryption immediately, they *will* be targeted by an attack. They should just hope it's by white-hats like the initial stuff has been.
While probably still a bit short for vital services like bank or Google accounts, 12 random characters would take years to brute-force crack even with a botnet. The important thing to do nowadays is to use a password manager, like Keepass - which is FOSS so you can go through and make sure there are no security holes in the code - and secure your password manager with 2fa *and* a complex, easy to remember password - Keepass recommends using the first letter of every word in a long sentence, keeping the punctuation intact. So you could do one like "Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starshipÂ Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds; to seek out new life and new civilisations; to boldly go where no man has gone before." and turn it into "S:tff.TatvotsE.Ifym:tesnw;tsonlanc;tbgwnmhgb." If you're a Trek nerd, you'll never forget it, and it's sufficiently complex that a brute force attack would be unlikely to succeed. 

Beyond 12 characters, or really beyond 8, with a random password, the weak point is the site's hashing, which can be "solved" with brute force attacks on weaker, short passwords. And as always, the weakest point is where the human becomes involved. That's why phishing phone calls and physical "hacks" are the most common sources of security breaches - many people have no qualms giving personal information, including answers to security questions or even just straight up their password, to a caller who sounds sufficiently professional, and an incredible amount of people put a sticky note etc with "Google Password: ********" on their desk or similar, making a physical breach elementary.
... do you make your users change their password monthly? That's how you get insecure passwords that just iterate on the previous one.
We didn't have the personnel to field a complete NFL defense, period.
Hurst is insanely disruptive. Trading down for him has the added benefit of being in position to take Josh Jackson or Harold Landry, too.
You're not Freddie Mercury. Don't try it.
#BAKE&JACK&HURST
Jeff Garcia was 35ish when we signed him and was never a guy to exceed expectations with a poor supporting cast. TT is still in his 20s and took *last year's Bills* to the playoffs.
BECAUSE THE ANGEL LITERALLY IS JUST "HEY LET'S LINE THE FS UP WHERE HE'D HAVE TO BACKPEDAL TO SO HE CAN READ THE PLAY MORE FULLY WITHOUT FOCUSING ON HIS BACKPEDAL"

you numpty
You ever read HumperMonkey/50FootAnt? It's my absolute favorite creepypasta series.
Yes, yes it is. Just because one player's skillset requires him to backpedal to 25 yards before being able to read the play while another can read from 15 doesn't mean their responsibilities are different. Gregg referred to the position Taylor played as angel. It's the same defense, the same position.
Oh man if we have our QB, Josh Jackson, and Maurice Hurst already and are staring at the 22nd pick, there's no way I could pass on Guice. Then 33 goes to Okorafor, who I think will be better than Williams or Miller anyway. 

Regardless, those first three picks, to me, are a damn successful draft.
Also I think the trade with Buffalo is the best option by far. Jackson is a better fit in Gregg's defense than Ward, Hurst is incredible and plays at one of the final positions of need for us, Landry is a better DPR than Chubb, and there's still an opportunity to snag a top talent at RB and OT - if Guice and Okorafor are 33 and 35 I'll be ecstatic, but even if we get say Freeman on day 3 it'll be a good pick.
The LBs are fine. Coverage issues started with CBs, where McCourty struggled against anybody with size and speed and Taylor couldn't hang with anybody who could run a route, continued into SS where Kindred put up some of the worst coverage I've seen, and culminated at FS where Peppers's lack of instincts and anticipation forced him to play back much further than the scheme calls for. This meant the LBs had twice the responsibility that most LBs have, because they had to cover the CBs' asses inside, as well as roam deep because Peppers didn't have their backs until 20 yards downfield. 

Those issues have been solved. Randall should be able to play closer to the line than Peppers was. Peppers is a much better coverage safety than Kindred. Gaines and Carrie are a huge upgrade over McCourty and Taylor. 

Kirksey and Collins have regularly been in the top 10 at their positions in coverage. In fact, in every year except 2017, Kirksey was a better pass defender than run defender.

And Burgess was the replacement for Collins.
Yep. I posted them about a month ago, along with a complete rebrand to the Bulldogs that used the Indians blue and the Cavs gold as the primary colors.
Defensive back. Replacing the four seives we fielded last year will be one of the biggest keys to success for this team, behind QB. 

Randall has the instincts and anticipation to play angel closer to the line than Peppers was forced to, turning the defense into a more traditional cover 1 just without the requirement to backpedal like Gregg Williams ran with Sean Taylor in Washington. 

Peppers near the line of scrimmage was a bit of a game changer the final two weeks, and he likely builds upon that. His college resume at SS/LB close to the line in coverage, blitz, and run support is fantastic, and he showed that it can translate to the NFL. If not, Kindred is serviceable despite his very poor coverage skills. 

Gaines and Currie are far better all around corner than McCourty or Taylor, and the battle for slot CB should be interesting to watch with BBC and Mitchell fighting it out at a position both have excelled at. 

And moving Jamar Taylor to the battle for dime will be one of the best moves we could make, as his athleticism and size will allow him to bully the one trick speedsters at WR4. He won't need technique in the dime because there aren't many route runners at WR4. He'll be competing with Howard Wilson, who I'm very excited to see play, and who may jump the ranks and fight for an outside position.
Don't forget Landry, who is a better pass rusher than Chubb or Davenport and thus is a better player for a DPR role and would let Ogbah or Garrett slide inside on passing downs. Jackson/Hurst/Landry/Guice are my short list for 12/22.
I mean, I saw Kizer routinely miss sliding the protection to catch the DB obviously showing blitz, so... I'm not sold.
So like [these](https://i.imgur.com/MG1t2lqh.jpg)?
Trade down for a CB with good size and great fit in Gregg's zone heavy defense, a DT with extremely strong penetration, a RB who excels at running north and south, or an EDGE who slots in as a designated pass rusher. Josh Jackson, Mo Hurst, Derrius Guice, and Harold Landry are all better picks for the Browns than Chubb, Barkley, Nelson, or Ward, and we can get *two* of them.
Maybe, just maybe, the Broncos and Cowboys had killer rosters and could let Morton just manage the game, which he wouldn't have been able to do in Chicago. 

This is why I hate mock re-drafts that have McNabb going #1 overall.
Hey Bris, do you need a Darnold safe space? /r/the_darnold is over that way ð
Drango can play G/T, not sure he's a C. But Tretter and Reiter are a perfectly capable starter and backup.
That's important when there are several comparable pass rushers who differentiate themselves through their varying levels of competence against the run. You could honestly bring that up this year if there was a feeling that Chubb and Landry were fighting for the same draft slots.
Yeah it's important to be a leader, and a fiery leader is one type that both Mayfield and Rosen fit into, but it's ridiculous to imply that other types of leaders are inferior or even nonexistent. 

And yeah intangibles are a dumb argument - what should really be taken into account, as long as you feel the prospect is coachable, is what they have that isn't coachable (size, arm strength, competitiveness, etc). The coachable traits (mechanics, etc) aren't irrelevant, because they mean there's less time required for the prospect to reach their potential, but the uncoachable traits determine their potential. That's why Allen (arm strength, size, etc) and Darnold (improvisation, etc) are seen as having stellar ceilings despite being worse players *right now* than Rosen or Mayfield.
One doesn't have problems with his eyes or anticipation or really his footwork, his only serious issue is his accuracy. 

Kizer had (and has) slow eyes, a trait that sunk Geno Smith's career, poor anticipation, meaning he waited until a guy had broken open before throwing, and poor and inconsistent lower half mechanics, especially with regards to pulling his leg through the throw. Allen has none of those issues.
But that's just the combination of arm strength, accuracy, and touch.
I was responding to "But why should normal people include obvious information?" Which is frankly just that dude being an asshole.
No penalty was assessed to the dump truck.
If Kizer had 4 INTs instead of TWENTY FUCKING TWO we'd be a .500 team. Tyrod Taylor had similar production to Kizer, better in all categories, and 18 fewer interceptions - all with a poorer supporting cast. So this, going into 2018, is a .500 team.
We had a .500 team that Kizer turned into a .000 team. The numbers back that up - that's what I showed in my post. We had nine winnable games where the points differential was created by Kizer turnovers that either statistically should have led to Browns points, or that became opposing points.
Angel is literally single high without the requirement to backpedal at the snap. Same responsibilities, just more opportunity to read the field. Peppers needed more time and space to read and react because of his unpolished instincts and anticipation, whereas Taylor, being better at FS than Peppers, could play a bit closer to the line. He still lined up at his play depth, which is the definition of angel.
There's always the F-Droid market for open source stuff. There's some quality stuff there.
Or *maybe* the issue with the defense was awful personnel in the secondary with the best player relegated to slot because of his size, the second best unable to cover receivers with size and athleticism, and the third best playing out of position due to injuries in the one place scouting reports unanimously said he shouldn't play - because despite that, he represented the best player at the position that wouldn't leave another void at his natural position. Couple that with atrocious penetration from Shelton, Coley, and Meder and you have yourself a recipe for defensive disaster.
Because being nonbinary isn't abnormal and shouldn't be treated as such.
"You" is still the second person pronoun. It's not gendered. You're making a big deal out of something that really doesn't affect anybody's day-to-day - except for the person who is nonbinary.
So you're being ostracized by your peers for being ignorant on a topic? Happens all the time - that's *their* freedom of speech. Two way street and all that.
I mostly visualize. If I do think in words, I have a habit of focusing on them, then slowing them to a mind numbing pace. All subconsciously. So I find myself listening to my head voice imitate Dory from Finding Nemo speaking in whale and then when I ask myself what the fuck I'm doing, that gets repeated and slowed too... it's weird as fuck.
If the FO feels that way, he's my pick at 12. I'm more confident in Hurst, Landry, and Guice making it to 22 anyway.
Nobody made the volume of mistakes that Kizer did, and especially not the volume of detrimental mistakes. We can play what if with everything else, but it's statistically likely for an offense to score 3 points inside the 35, just as it's statistically likely for an offense to score 7 inside the 10. It's not statistically likely for a player to fumble or otherwise make a mistake - the added snaps in this scenario are a very small percent of the snaps in the season. 

I'm not piling on Kizer; instead, I'm lifting up the other 52 and the coaching staff, showing how they were competitive most of the year - if you remove the play of one player - and could very easily have won half of their games with a competent QB. Now we have that competent QB; add into consideration much-needed upgrades at FS, CB, WR, OT, and RB, and this is a team that should be better than last year's team that could easily have won 8 games.
The Rams unger Gregg ran literally 2% less zone than the Browns did this season. A Rams type defense is zone heavy.
That's literally what I did.
>Kizer should be in a great spot to sit and learn.

Being behind a Hall of Famer in Green Bay has historically been a solid position. I look forward to seeing how he progresses. 

And no, he shouldn't have been the best QB in the room, but he was, and he was the reason we lost all 16 games.
>Angel is just an inherently bad DB setup that is too easily countered by a half decent gameplan. Peppers started most plays 15-20 yards away from our linebackers, thats a huge crossing cushion that anyone can make use of. You pretty much force yourself into a 10 on 11 game no matter who plays FS

The original comment that I replied to. 

FOH with your goalpost moving, dude.
"Angel is dumb"

"It worked fine with a better FS in Washington"

"But it's never worked with the scheme warped for a bad FS like Peppers"

I think the question is what's *your* point?
I don't like the Haden comp for Jaire - he seems to have lesser ball skills and technique, and besides, Joe Haden (the prospect) is a good deal less valuable in 2018 than he was in 2010, because size, physicality, and aggression for a CB are much more highly valued than they were. If you don't have those traits, you better be athletic as fuck if you want to be a first round prospect - that's why Ward is there and Jaire isn't. 

Jackson, meanwhile, is big, strong, and aggressive, with very good technique, which make up for his mediocre to good athleticism. He's a more athletic and bigger McCourty who won't get torched by literally anybody with speed and size like JMac was. 

Oliver's tape looking like Gilbert's is a positive. Gilbert's college film was incredible, the way he flipped the game on receivers and turned them into the defenders. As long as you believe his work ethic is there, he's a top 4 CB.
No Taylor didn't, you're right, because Taylor actually had skills at deep safety and wasn't just a warm body put back there because he was the best of the uninjured candidates for the position - taking into account drop-off at his natural position as well, considering that our CB4 was far worse than our SS2. Taylor's instincts and anticipation were off the charts, and he had the speed to cover ground and make a play based on what those traits told him. That allowed him to play closer to the LOS, because a better safety requires a smaller backpedal to be effective playing deep.
Williams has always run aggressive zone while claiming to run man. I don't get it, but he's always been in the top 5 or so of percent of snaps running zone coverage. Jackson is also an enigma - extremely talented, a top 3 corner along with Ward, Oliver, and J.C. Jackson, but excelling in zone means he has few suitors. He could go early if Ward and Oliver come off the board and a CB needy team decides to roll the dice on coaching him into a man scheme, but he could conceivably even be there at 33.
>2\. (disclaimer: unverified) Someone posted here or /r/NFL where if we had just kicked a field goal whenever we got inside the 20, even if it was first and ten, we would have won 3 games last year. Now we have a QB that doesn't make bad decisions in the red zone.

I did the research at the end of the season, and Kizer turnovers inside the 35 took away scoring chances that could have led to ties or wins against Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Indianapolis, New York, Tennessee, Jacksonville, and Los Angeles. That's 7 games single-handedly lost by Kizer, not including his game-ending turnover against Green Bay, or his destructive turnovers against Detroit, Chicago, and Pittsburgh. 11 winnable games without Kizer, 12 if you count the already winnable game against Minnesota. So with a competent and careful QB, we could have been anywhere between 6-10 (calling the resulting tie @ Baltimore a loss) and 12-4. 

Basically, Cincinnati had our number twice, Baltimore had us beat at home the entire way, and Houston rolled over Hogan; those were the only games we outright lost. Interestingly, the two games I went to this year were vs Cincinnati and vs Baltimore...
Alexander over Jackson? They're not even comparable in terms of talent, and Jackson is a better fit to boot.
Jackson is all over the place. Fit-wise he's perfect here, but doesn't really have many suitors. In terms of overall ability and talent, he's the second or third best CB in the class with Ward, Oliver, and J.C. Jackson near him, so he could get taken as a value pick by a man-heavier team hoping to coach him up a bit if Ward and Oliver are off the board - but I think they'd probably take the drop-off in raw talent to go with a better man corner like Jaire Alexander, or just address a different position. There's a possibility that Jackson goes before 15, and there's a possibility he falls to 33. 

Coming out of the first with Jackson and Hurst makes me tingly. Coming out of the second with two of Hurst/Landry/Guice at 12 and 22, Jackson at 33, and an OT like Chukwuma Okorafor or Connor Williams at 35 is just unfair. Especially if we can snag J.C. Jackson on day 3.
I think Jackson is the best DB fit in the draft for us, and Hurst is clearly the best penetrating DI in the draft and would be dangerous beside Ogunjobi. This is a much better scenario than one of Barkley, Chubb, Fitzpatrick, or Ward.
That 2013 defense was underrated as fuck and actually fierce.
I can't fucking believe that there are NFL players younger than me. I mean our starting QB last year was younger than me. Crazy shit.
Not knocking the talent, but Landry is hall of very good material, not HOF material. He's a high volume slot target, not an explosive playmaker like Flash and OBJ.
The joke wasn't funny, original, or clever, so I don't blame him for commenting on something else.
McCourty was awful against any receiver with speed and size. See the way AJ Green absolutely fucking torched him. His technique was good to great, but he was such a liability against the better, more athletic WRs in the league. Taylor, on the other hand, got beat by anybody with route running technique; he couldn't stick with receivers into and out of breaks.
It's not though? It was successful in Washington, and nobody could argue that it took Sean Taylor out of the game. Angel is still a very impactful position - it's literally just Cover 1 but without the necessity of backpedaling at the snap. It lets the FS read the play better and use less energy getting into position.
Wow this is more efficient than the [[City of Brass]] kill!
It was still cheap before that, though, wasn't it? Idk it just seems like way too powerful a card to be under 50 cents for the original printing.
Spa ð

I definitely ate shit many times in Eau Rouge on GTR2 (god what a sim that game was). That and La Source were so hard to carry the proper speed through without losing control.
>The Sixers were crappy because they had crappy talent and *couldn't* win. **That** is why it didn't create the "losing" culture everyone was worried about.

Off topic kinda but this is why I'm very excited about the Browns. Similar situation - naturally bad, off the backs of a couple of positions that have been 100% overhauled this offseason.

Lmao I really couldn't give a shit, I just don't see how anybody could watch Harden and LBJ and think "oh Harden is clearly having a better season and is a more valuable player to his team". LeBron been putting together a career highlight film this last month or two especially.
From a shelter, or as a non-pure breed, it's rather affordable. Not more affordable than a wooden stick and some printed cardboard, sure, but in most areas where you could conceivably afford to pay for home security (i.e. the ADT signs actually make sense and pose a real threat) you'd most likely be able to afford the one time expense of a dog, along with the much smaller expense of food and the regular preventative health care.
Homosexuality is not a disorder, according to any reputable health organization. You're building a strawman. 

And honestly, yeah, minor depression should probably be a flag when looking to buy a gun. I'd imagine there would be a point system, where psychosis etc is an immediate fail, but you'd need a bunch of minor disorders to be fully disqualified. After a certain point, maybe registration of the firearm along with the records of the mental health exam would be mandatory - of course, it would need to some how comply with HIPAA. Just spitballing here, not writing the bill. 

Mentally ill people are less likely to be emotionally stable and judgementally sound, and as such can pose a greater danger to themselves and others when armed.
Because I came here to enjoy Harden being a goofball and this fool is saying he has the MVP locked. Not that he's the favorite, that it's *locked*. That would be as big a travesty as Brady not winning MVP this year, after the best three year stretch of quarterbacking in NFL history with zero MVPs to show for it and a career year.

/r/gatekeeping. You're doing it.
Why are you making this about him specifically? He's posting that he's frustrated that the people he admires are getting called out for making personal attacks on these people instead of actually having a discourse. We're talking about those who are making those personal attacks, whether it includes this transphobic dickhead or not.

Bananarchism.
I mean, the left emphasizes the new testament's "love thy neighbor", while the right emphasizes the Mosaic laws. Why does the old law take precedence in your mind over Jesus' new commandment? Assuming the truth of the Bible (neckbeards beware!), He made it so the penalty for breaking Mosaic law is no longer death and damnation, because His sacrifice already atoned for that. The penalty for breaking Jesus' commandment is lack of recognition by Christ on Judgement Day, which means you, like the Jewish people, will be relying on your works to save you. 

So, make sure you know every jot and tittle of the Mosaic law, because if you ever break it - or ever have broken it - you're fucked.
How about a mandatory mental health check by an independent psychologist before the sale of any firearm? And a mandatory firearm safety course would be a good idea too - before ownership, not just before being permitted to carry.
**TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON!**

Thought you ought to know.
Receivers are golden. Safety looks good with Peppers and Randall. Shit, I honestly have faith in Shon Coleman to step up at LT - he was solid at RT the back half of this year, essentially his rookie season, and LT is his natural position. Our offense is pretty set outside of QB - I'd still like a gap-hitting downhill runner for first and second downs, but Hyde should be okay in that role. We could more use a rotational pass rushing DE for the strong side, another outside corner (aggressive zone preference), and an interior penetrator to pair with Ogunjobi. 

Trading with the Bills for 12 and 22 and coming out of the first round (plus 33 and 35) with a QB and, say, Mo Hurst, Harold Landry, Josh Jackson, and Derrius Guice is the absolute dream, although Chubb - seemingly an Ogbah clone - would be decent too.
>Where did you read that the guy got both the pizza and the refund? He went in because his food *never arrived* and they hung up on him every time he, rightfully, demanded to know where it was. He did *not* get the service he was paying for.

You're assuming that this guy wasn't just harassing the store because his pizza hadn't arrived after a half hour or so. OP's post corroborates that - he said the guy's food didn't arrive fast enough, not that it didn't arrive at all.
>Sure, you can't account for everything, but a decent store will attempt to keep its customers happy.

Fuck this "the customer is always right" American bullshit. 

>Do you go into a restaurant and just accept when your meal, say a steak, is brought out to you completely cold? 

No, I ask politely to have it reheated. 

>Would you pay for that? 

Yes, because I'm still going to be eating the food, and have still used the service I paid for. If I send it back without having them remake it, then of course not. But I'm not entitled to both the service and the product for free just because it wasn't perfect coming out. 

>If someone pays for a service, they are well within their rights to ask for a refund if that service is not fulfilled.

They are nowhere near their rights to harass and verbally abuse a worker, though, no matter what the situation. They're also not entitled to their food *and* a refund, as many of the people who flip their shit in these situations ask for.
Why are you here? Go back to fucking your 20ga barrel.
>Apparently my apartment neighbor, who shared my address (apt 1 vs apt 2) had ordered and not gotten his food *for too long* before calling and belligerently arguing on the phone.

His food was late. You don't get a refund for late food, it gets to you when it gets to you. "30 minutes or less" was phased out in 1993, but entitled dickholes like OP's neighbor still treat it as gospel (even if not ordering from the cascading pizza chain).

>They hung up on him (a trend) and he kept calling (to get his fucking food) and they hung up everytime. He went into the store angry and yelling to get a refund and they did eventually refund, but refused to serve him ever again. 

Hanging up is wrong, unless he was verbally abusing them - which I wouldn't put past the guy, considering he *came into the store and yelled at the workers*. Regardless, the asshole created an unsafe situation by his actions. He argued belligerently, he kept trying to argue after the workers had said everything they could over the phone (taking up the workers' time and lessening their ability to earn money by tying up a line and pulling a worker off his or her job), then came to the store still being belligerent. 

The situation was created by OP's neighbor. 

Then OP refused to order carryout, his only option to be served, thus taking away a worker's time that could be otherwise spent answering a paying call, taking a delivery, or making food. The worker shouldn't have hung up abruptly, but if OP was just trying to argue and explain about the situation, that sort of thing is better done in person, at a non-peak time, and with a manager rather than a regular pizza jockey.
Definitely right there, the groove rules all, especially with Take Five - you can tap your foot on the quarters and not even notice that you're counting five of them. 

With Schism, I can see how that's difficult to feel, especially on a chart-based representation like RB - you have to translate the subdivisions in the chart into the musical notes you hear. My biggest talents as a musician are playing by ear and improvising; I'm absolutely shit at reading music so I would probably struggle trying to play by sight on RB, but I have this ability to subdivide a measure in my head on the fly so that the timing makes sense to me.
By arguing and coming to the store and yelling at the workers *until the manager banned him for life*.
I'm a huge fan of peak warp gen4, especially with the new Monte Carlo headlights and the Charger body - so 2005 through 2007, 2004 was still a bit boxy. 2007 was such a damn weird year for me. One week they were driving (IMO) the absolute best looking cars in the history of the sport, the next week they'd be driving the worst looking car of the modern era and arguably in the sport's history - the 2007-2010 COT was an absolute visual travesty until they changed the nose for 2011.
Last I checked, you can't reveiw your next door neighbor on Yelp or TripAdvisor. He created a situation that the store feels is unsafe at that apartment. Yeah the employees shouldn't just hang up, but they get paid (much) less than minimum wage. They literally don't get paid enough to deal with worthless calls.
Ah yes, because the distinction is very apparent when one is being fired at you. And for the most part, in practice, the difference between a fully automatic and a semiautomatic weapon is an increase in accuracy, a smaller number of bullets fired, and a moderate, not severe, decrease in fire rate.
That's just a feel, and it's so easy to replicate. It's a double slide up, at the and of 1 and directly on the 3, pulled ever so slightly off the beat - most likely unintentionally.
Schism is so easy to feel, though. It's not difficult to drum with, knowing how the song goes. The time signatures aren't fucked if you can feel the song's pulse through them.
Yeah he sure killed us when we played the Jaguars in 2014. 122 yards? Just fucking how?
We had seven games swung by the lost points from a Kizer turnover or two inside the 35: PIT I, BAL I, IND, NYJ, TEN, LAC, and JAX. Those seven are wins with Taylor, and that's not counting Detroit, Green Bay, Chicago, or Pittsburgh II, where we lost games that weren't helped by Kizer turnovers, though they didn't occur in scoring position. 

That's 11 games that become very winnable, to the point of nearly being should-wins, with Taylor. Minnesota and Baltimore II become the 50/50 games. 

Side note, why the fuck were we so outclassed by the Bengals (twice) and the Texans?
*Door flies open*

Like a bridge jumper yo I ain't nothing to play with
I do expect Williams to stick. He stayed after last year, Fielding one of the worst defenses in the league - now that he actually has a competent secondary, including a natural FS who has experience playing deep, as well as a chance to get a disruptive DT to pair with Ogunjobi (please please please trade with the Bills and target Hurst at 12 and Jackson at 22), I expect the defense to be very much improved.
You dense motherfucker, that's not the point of this post. Vea is a prospect I'm not a big fan of. The point was to post his positives so we can be more objective and rational as a community (clearly nobody else but Smash cared enough to join me). Regardless of whether there are better options or whatever.
I see you, Mike Bibby and Paul Pierce.
Not a better receiver, but comparable to the best in the league, and a more efficient and powerful runner.
Gesicki is too one dimensional a player for me; his blocking leaves a lot to be desired. Worse than Njoku by a long while coming out. Goedert is interesting but has a similar issue. Hurst is probably my 1, but I really like Andrews too as an all around TE.
So the companies with less than 40 stations are all shell companies for sOrOs but the company with 74 stations doesn't need shell companies? That's patently false anyway, as Sinclair has companies that basically just mirror their content, which are for all intents and purposes shell companies.
Maybe not to like this, but almost definitely to know about them. Japanese and Korean music tends to stay separate from American music aside from weebs.
Duke Johnson is one of the most efficient receiving backs in the league, on a level with David Johnson. Adding a receiving back is absolutely redundant, especially when Barkley also doesn't run as efficiently or powerfully as Duke.
Not asking about mocks, asking about an amateur scout's opinion.
Maybe learn how football works. Start there. Then get back with me.
Josh and JC are my fucking dudes.
Ah so you're an asshole. Good to know.
