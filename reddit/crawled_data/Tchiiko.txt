Yeah, in France with have the public hospitals that respect the prices set by the Social Security, but with longer awaiting times for non life threatening issues. 

Then you can go to private hospitals and clinics, where you can pay more than what is refunded by the SS, and get through faster. But some private hospitals offer the same prices that the ones at the public hospitals, so they get a full cover by our SS.

I’m happy to live where I live... Despite being represented as one of the most taxed countries in the world, I enjoy being able to basically getting paid to get my bachelor degree (got paid 800/900/900 € each year while living with my mom) then go on my master’s degree being paid 1200€ last year and the same this one, my last year before going to work at full time. I love my apprenticeship system, where I go to school 40% of the time and then I work in my field. I will graduate at 23yo, debt free with a bit of money appart so I can look for my own house / appartement. 

I feel you, and hope you’ll be able to someday get the same things as Europe on some things (stud debt, healthcare etc...). 

Have a nice day mate :) 
What the... 
Yeah. Basically people know of Tesla cars because they are invested in tech. They like things that Musk has done in the past, like Paypal, Space X, Tesla Motors, etc. 

People shit on Mercedez-Benz for being an "overrated manufacturer". 

I just disagree. We could say exactly the same of American car makers and a not so good build quality, when in Europe there is : 
Mercedes-Benz / Audi, WW, BMW, (for the high end but still affordable cars).

Technically speaking the Wehrmacht stayed "as clean as possible", and most of the horrors linked to the Jew, etc are to be given to the SS, and the Nazi command. 
Well the world is not black and white. He did many things that were bad for the colonies of France at the time, but helped doing great things too. 

Every country got people like this all along its history. And motives, at the time, can be understood (some at least). 
Yeah, to be accurate it comes like this : 

During the 1940 Blitzkrieg, the Luftwaffe often struck under the cover of darkness. In order to make it more difficult for the German planes to hit targets, the British government issued citywide blackouts. The Royal Air Force were able to repel the German fighters in part because of the development of a new, secret radar technology. The on-board Airborne Interception Radar (AI), first used by the RAF in 1939, had the ability to pinpoint enemy bombers before they reached the English Channel. But to keep that under wraps, the Ministry provided another reason for their success: carrots.
Yeah it seems that the British rendered it completly useless, or at least to heavily damaged, but it was sank thanks to sabotage of the crew. 
:( 
The secret is to just undertake it. My account shares my fun content with my NSFW content. (͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖)👌 
250 000 of debt?... only for your school? I can't get my mind right on this topic... 

(I'm a European, and I'm not shitting on the USA, but I can't understand, no matter how many times it's explained to me, how you are supposed to make a living when you start your "adult life" working with 250K$ in debt... And that's without buying a house / flat... Geez). 
same for France (not the same rates though). 
Yeah latin based languages are quite similar (spanish / italian / french / portuguese). So it's quite easy to learn the other ones. + English and you're good for the rest. 
I'm late to the party, but here are my two cents. 

I'm French myself and was wondering what you were talking about when you talked about "French doors". I looked it up and I'm amused now, because it's sometimes called the American Fridge in France. :D

I’m having a lot of trouble with (some not all) americans, as it seems that many are pursuing the money before anything else. 

Clearly the objective seems to be « earn more / earn the most ». 

I don’t say that it doesn’t exist in Europe (in my case France), but I feel it to a lesser extent. People are more focused about personal accomplishments, rather than earn the most while you can so you can live your hobbies laters, so you can get treated if you need, so you can have a good retirement fund. 

Sorry about giving my opinion which may be a little off regarding the subject. Feel free to downvote / report / delete if it breaks rules. (I’m a long time lurker / first time commenting).

Wait... Hold on a minute. the US don't have a National ID (except for the Passport?). Wow... 

That explains why the driving licence can be used sometimes as an ID, or same for the SS card.

Here in France for exemple you have the *Carte Nationale d'Identité (CNI)* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_identity_card_(France) which is the ID you can use in th listed countries. Then if you want to travel abroad where the CNI isn't accepted you have to buy a passport. 

Edit : Still I don't get how people can think that a National ID is something bad, and it's giving away your freedom to your government. Federal government fear is really a thing in the US? 

(I don't mean to be offensive, or condescending by any means, I'm just intrigued by your system).

Oh so that's real in the US? That's why in GTA people can just take random cars?

I don't get it...

Every cars I've been in (in Europe at least), for years, have auto lock on all doors and car trunk, when you start moving above 5km/h. And it doesn't unlock untill you try to open the doors from the inside, or if you manually unlock the doors with the control panel.

And they have systems that auto unlock the doors if the car happens to have a collision, or gets in an accident of any sorts, to allow the emergency services to get the persons out easily.

Yes, the circlejerk about Musk is unbelievable... 

You should take a look at r/teslamotors. You can't even dare to question the quality of the car (the outside is nice, but the interior feels so cheap for the price it is in Europe...). They are trying to compare themleves to Mercedes-Benz, Audi, BMW, which are CLEARLY better at making car than Tesla. 

But on the other hand it doesn't stop me from thinking that the "revolution" Tesla brought to the car market is one of the nicest things that happened. Making the public enjoy fully electric cars.

Nan mais de toute façon les gens veulent des avantages dans leur super boites privées (Thalès, Airbus, Safran), mais par contre un employé du public ou d'une entreprise exerçant une mission de service public ne peut que juste se contenter de son salaire et doit fermer sa gueule (avec bien sûr des salaires moins élevés que l'équivalent du privé). 
Ouais vive le nivellement par le bas. Ça a la cote auprès des politiques et des français. Jusqu’à ce que ça les touche... Vive le capitalisme à l’excès et à outrance. 
Oui et avec plaisir, mais bon l'aménagement du territoire ça parle à personne en région parisienne ou en métropole j'ai l'impression. On aurait plus vite fait de tous nous foutre dans des villes géantes (on a qu'à faire comme la mégalopole de Tokyo : la population française dedans et on se fait pas chier comme ça avec l'aménagement, on a juste à faire des super métro, super trams, super trains de banlieue, etc.). 
Et à côté de ça on nous fait chier pour l'écologie, etc mais on remplace des trains par des bus... Super 

(Et à côté de ça on a Hulot le "grand écologiste de renom" ( ^lol ) qui n'en branle par une). 
Oui mais le nivellement par le bas c'est un truc qui a la côte depuis des années parmi nos politiques, et même chez nos compatriotes. 

Sauf quand on commence à toquer à leur porte, et là devant le fait accompli ils commencent à pleurer. Ca me fait penser à cette citation : 



    «  Quand les nazis sont venus chercher les communistes, je n’ai rien dit, je n’étais pas communiste.

    Quand ils ont enfermé les sociaux-démocrates, je n’ai rien dit, je n’étais pas social-démocrate.

    Quand ils sont venus chercher les syndicalistes, je n’ai rien dit, je n’étais pas syndicaliste.

    Quand ils sont venus me chercher, il ne restait plus personne pour protester.  »

(Alors je suis d'accord ce n'est pas aussi terrible que les Nazis mais l'idée reste du même style). 

[Lien Wikipédia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quand_ils_sont_venus_chercher...)
Oui mais les gens préfèrent se battre pour des miettes de pain entre pauvres et moins pauvres (nous cheminots par exemple). Au lieu de regarder plus haut et de remarquer la gabegie de l'état au plus haut niveau ou du patronat. 

J'ai vraiment envie d'en pleurer... 
Par ce que pour que la SNCF fonctionne y a foutre un gus dans la cabine et il pousse ses manettes et on est bon, on vire les 130 000 autres personnels de la SNCF car ils servent à rien. On garde que les 10 000 et quelques (13K je crois) conducteurs. 

^^^^^^/s 
Mais la désinformation elle marche à 200% sur les français, c'est déprimant pour des gens qui se croient "cultivés" et "instruits"... 

La possibilité de partir à ces âges (52 pour les roulants / 57 pour les "sédentaires") n'équivaut pas à une retraite à taux plein... Il faut quand même cotiser un nombre d'année équivalent (le même d'ailleurs), pour obtenir une retraite à taux plein (soit avec les réformes qui ont commencées en 1995, un âge presque équivalent au "privé"). 

De plus pour parler du temps de travail, il est limité légalement pour beaucoup de métiers qui exercent bien souvent des fonctions de sécurité réglementées par la France, ou même l'Europe (je pense aux agents de circulation, agents régulateurs, régulateurs sous station, conducteurs, etc...). 
Pourtant au Japon (qu'on aime prendre comme modèle) le nombre de cheminots est beaucoup plus important que chez nous à la SNCF, ou même à la DB. Mais bon 
Le moins va t en grève c'est la CFDT... "Réformistes"... Pff 
On est dans la merde :( 

De tout cœur avec toi cher collègue!.. 
I'm sorry but I would like to give my French view on the subject, because it's always interesting to share experiences or points of view! :) 

And be advised, I don't want to feel condescending for saying this (and please forgive me if I happen to make some mistakes in my English)... 

Just a bit of "overview" : 

The 35-hour working week is a measure adopted first in France, in February 2000. The previous legal duration of the working week was 39 hours (since 1982), and earlier than the 39 hours we had the 40h / week since 1936. 

But many workers often end up doing some overtime (5 to 10 hours a week). And we have some special treatment for the OT : employers can either pay those extra hours, or they can chose to give you extra leave days depending on how many hours you made OT. 

There is also another exception : we have a special status for "upper employees" (management, but also specialized or expert workers), which is the "statut cadre" [French Wikipédia page](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadre_d%27entreprise). Those workers often end up being with a status of a fixed working day number than with a fixed hour contract. This means that they can end up working 40 / 45 hours a week without getting overpaid for it. But on the other side it allows them to get a better retirement pension at the end of their careers, some extra leave days, and other benefits. 

It does not explain everything in our working system, but I wanted to try and give an overview for you arround the globe (checkmate flat Earth members!).

But to answer to your advice on meeting more girls, it’s not the problem (I think?). I’m currently preparing a masters degree, and my last 5 years of school were in HR, which is a « sector » with a very big number of females. For exemple we are currently 3 guys for 18 girls in my class. 

Another thing is that I like to know if the girl and I can get along (so become friends) before trying or thinking of anything « more » (ie : a date or a relationship or even a hookup).

While I do take an extreme care of my belongings, and I have had iphone since the 5, and never took nor needed AC+. Still going clean and no broke phones until now!
I run my iPhone X without a screen protector, and only the official Apple leather case in Leather Brown. iPhone X Silver btw. 

No screen scratch so far (have my phone since it's out), but many scratches on the side of the phone, and that's annoying af. 
They do have faster ones :

I enjoy being able to see every service that is available to me in a certain area :(


Yeah I remember using Apple Pay with my iPhone 6 as soon as it was out in France, in July 2016. People were a bit freaked out. 

I even remember going to Italy and other European countries using Apple pay on their NFC terminals, when Apple pay wasn't released yet in their countries. So many question they had. 

=D 
To answer your question, I can help a bit, as I'm French myself and happy to help :)

So first, you have different levels of organization like in the US I suppose (Police, FBI, SWAT, this kind of things). 

In France you have, from the most local police to the army : 

- La Police Municipale [Municipal Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_Police_(France) : it's the local police of towns and cities in France outside the capital (Paris). BROKEN LINK ==> See at the end of my comment

- La Police Nationale [National Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Police_(France) : The National Police operates mostly in large cities and towns. BROKEN LINK ==> See at the end of my comment

- La Gendarmerie Nationale [National Gendarmerie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Gendarmerie) : They are part of the army, as a military unit, specialized in Police missions. Its area of responsibility includes smaller towns, rural and suburban areas, while the Police Nationale—a civilian force—is in charge of cities and downtowns.

- L'Armée de Terre (French Army / Branch of the Land Army) [French Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Army) : the land-based and largest component of the French Armed Forces. They are in the mission of protecting important monuments, touristic areas, transports (all of this mainly in the Paris Metropolitan area) according to the Vigipirate plan [Vigipirate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigipirate). 

Then you have some specialized units, like the [CRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compagnies_R%C3%A9publicaines_de_S%C3%A9curit%C3%A9) which is the Compagnie Républicaine de Sécurité : They are primarily involved in general security missions but the task for which they are best known is crowd and riot control.

You can also have the [GIGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIGN) which is a specialized part of the Gendarmerie Nationale. Its missions include counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, surveillance of national threats, protection of government officials, and targeting organized crime.

Specialized units in counter terrorism also exist in the French Police forces, such as the [BRI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_Intervention_Brigade) or the [GIPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Police_Intervention_Groups). 

I hope it helped! :)

That's fun (paging u/futurespace too). 

I live in France, and got some black or mixed (black and white Idk how you say it in English), friends, and we have absolutely zero shame or problems with calling them "niggers" or "negro" or "black" etc. 

And I rarely had any problems with my fellow French people looking at me like I'm a racist or something. 

(And I'm a white male, with Asian friends, and white friends, and we have zero shame in using the stereotypes when we are talking to each other). 

Edit : Am I being downvoted for saying how my life is and that what may cause you troubles get me nothing? I don’t understand Reddit...

Oui la situation ne change pas pour nous. Mais bon dire qu’on se retrouve à payer pour un bien simplement par ce que ça a prit de la valeur c’est triste, surtout quand on l’a depuis si longtemps. 

Et c’est en ça que c’est mal foutu, même si on a un abattement de 30% comme c’est une résidence principale. Mais on a moins les moyens de payer que des « vrais riches ». 
Un gros problème de l'IFI étant qu'une personne qui hérite d'un bien immobilier à l'Ile d'Oléron, aux Bassin d'Arcachon, ou un appartement à paris ou en banlieue proche, peut risquer de se retrouver dedans. 

Car je prends mon exemple, en banlieue au niveau de Versailles, notre maison familiale était dans un trou perdu, or aujourd'hui on se retrouve avec un bien qui vaut quelques petits millions, mais qui appartiens à notre famille depuis un peu plus de 60 ans, là où l'immobilier c'était pas cher. J'ai peur pour l'avenir de la maison que mon grand père et ma grand mère ont construit. 
Non mais on est encore dans la "politique de l'autruche". Le réveil sera tout de même difficile pour certains... 

Et je tiens à préciser qu'en étant tout de même plus sensible à la droite en termes de politiques, je reste néanmoins convaincu que le "modèle" français de redistribution des richesses est une bonne idée. Après effectivement sur l'exécution beaucoup de choses peuvent être optimisées. 

Je pense notamment aux aides conditionnées aux revenus (fin du principe d'égalité, car une famille aisée, comme celle dont je fait partie, n'a pas besoin d'aide à la rentrée, de caf, d'alloc etc.), la protection sociale pour tous (j'entends personnes présentes légalement sur le territoire national). 
Je pense pouvoir affirmer même que les démocrates, qui peuvent être vus très à gauche aux États-Unis d'Amérique comme par exemple Sanders, seraient tout de même relativement à droite dans la politique française. 
It's actually quite "old" in France. In facts, France has been known to use nuclear energy as soon as the early 60's, but it really grew in % of the total of energy in the late 70's.

Yeah it might work if Apple negotiated a cut on those subscriptions. If not I see no win for Apple. 
Yeah people only see their side of the story, but when it's the opposite and they are now suffering from it they will even deny you have problems too...

First, how do you find your Bose, did you consider it first and directly? Is it really worth the 4490€ (I believe it’s 4000$). 

Did you try/look at buying all the parts (mixer / speakers / etc) before going for this all in one? 

Do you have any trouble configuring it, and in its day to day use? 

I’m trying to think about other questions when I’m sleeping and I may get new ones :)

So that’s why it works better than many people, myself included. Because we use « requires attention » to work :) 
But they are the ones to approve apps on the AppStore. 
Do you have the "requires attention" (or whatever it's called in English) deactivated? 

Because mine is on, and it fails like 1/4 times because it starts scanning my face when i'm not even looking for the phone.

Yeah. Many low cost airlines are often annoying as fuck when it's about compensations for any delays or when the flight is deleted. 

Whereas "big" **regular** airlines, like Air France-KLM, British Airways (not for so long when they'll leave the EU), Lufthansa etc. don't make any problems when you get a problem because of a strike, because of delays, etc. (At least from my now quite important experience). 
I gotta love how communism and socialism are very often confused by Americans. 

I know that you've been learning for generations that socialism is bad (the difference between communism and socialism being blurred by your politicians for generations is a real issue), but man... 

I can't help but think that the USA would be so much better of a contry with social policies... At least for 75% of the population. But here we are :( 


PSA : Don't take personal offense for my sayings, or as an attack about the USA. I know that many things are great too.

BIC is still a French company to this day. And by looking at their [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9_Bic), TIL that they even made sailboard, boats, kayaks, surfboard.. as stated in the French Wikipedia page : https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bic_(entreprise)

r/hairypussy would love this! 

Anyway nice one 😏
Yes but it has more to do with taxes than Apple putting the price higher up. 

In France for exemple, the phone is under a VAT of 20%, from 10 to 15% tax on "private copy" depending on the storage capacity (it's a tax on every support that allow people to store musics, films etc, to pay for the author's rights and producers' rights etc, so it's paid on external hard drive, usb key, cd's, and so on), etc... 

So it's not more expensive directly because of Apple, but to be sincere about it, I prefer to pay a bit more on many products, but benefit from my healthcare and now going into debt to pay for medicine, hospital bills etc. We also get a real retirement pension and the list goes on.

Well Paris is one of the biggest cities in Europe. I think only London is on par. 

For exemple in Paris the density is 21 067 inhab./km^2 ; 
it's 5 518 inhab./km^2 in London. 

The total population is 2M2 in Paris, while it's 8M6 in London, but the metropolitan area pop is 12M5 in Paris while it's 12M3 in London. 


And furthermore, a lot of people work in Paris, coming from the suburban areas and even coming from the countryside (like Lille / Rennes / Strasbourg / Orlean / Tours etc). 

The city is quite overcrowded and all the time. 

Edit : km^2 and not km2

Technically iPhone's LCD screens are the best ones available, so it's a downgrade sure, but not THAT much imo. 
Nono you are making up bs here. 

In France no other phone maker can compete with Apple service. Even in tablets and laptops or desktops. 

Buuuut, there is a but : 

European laws force the companies to have a better consideration for the consummer, and not screw them over. The aftersale service and repair, warranty are enforced by law here. 

But I'll repeat myself and I've never been more considered than in an Apple Store where Customer satisfaction is the number 1 objective for the workers.  
Oh man now this is a circlejerk! Damn haters ahah. 

Is there a sub for android so I can be a hater myself? 
I do care about your politics because unlike too many Americans, I do care about what is happening around the globe. And I’m really curious about the fact that so many people are « afraid » of Regulated markets. In Western Europe there is no such government mistrust for regulated markets (Telecoms, Drucs [treatments], water supply, electricity, et .). 

I do believe that regulations are a necessity on certain markets to prevent colonies from taking too much power over the people and the countries and their elected representatives. 

Edit : Drugs not drucs 
SERIOUSLY I DONT EVEN GET HOW YOU COULD BE AGAINST NN AS A CONSUMMER... HOW CAN YOU BE SO AFRAID OF YOUR GOVERNMENT IN THE US AND LET CORPORATE FUCK YOU OVER?

Just an unrelated question, how did you get your flair as I want the exact same eheh (Friday can’t come fast enough!) 
Obviously Apple knows this with the 7/7+ 

A lot of people, myself included, bought a 128 GB because it was enough to store my videos, films, musics, photos (currently running at 75GB used). 

But I don't want to delete things from my phone so I would have have gone with a 128 if it was available on the X, sadly they knew this was going to be the case, so why not force people to to 256 or force the "cheap" ones to get back to 64 (and maybe they'll buy some iCloud space who know)... 

Just my 2 cents... 
I can answer to that. I got myself many accessories : 

Mophie charging pad (for my bedroom as it's where I charge my phone overnight). 

Fast charger adaptater (yes the expensive one) for mobility charging 

And I'm planning on buying the Airpower mat when it comes out as I already have an Apple Watch, so then I'll use it home to replace my Mophie, and my Mophie will come with me to work. 

I hope it's clear x)

Not sure but... W... Why? 
Good bot
It's a question that comes out often... 

I discovered it too, that once you have a notification on the Watch, you don't get it on the iPhone. 

Working as intended ^tm 
Source?
Source ?
Source please? :)

And : r/colorfulporn 
Only time will let us know this though.. 
Well I own an Apple Watch so I can track my sleep, and my sport sessions (swimming, weightlifting, badminton)... 

But with only the iPhone I guess it’s harder to use it except for number of steps, distance, etc...
But they seem to have a lower production for the iPhone X than they had with the regular 6(s) / 6(s)+ phones. 

I guess february to march isn't that much of an exageration. 
You'd be better sell one kidney or a piece of liver. It's good enough to live without one (for the kidney) or a piece of it (for the liver). 

:D 
I love the health app somehow. But for me it's the iMessage that's killing it. (And I'm Lucky enough to have almost all my besties and family using iPhones) 

:)

Edit : I know it's not really an app but more of a feature of the Message app but hey let me be happy \o/ 
Nothing? 
Ordered mine with Apple directly, everything went as smooth as a baby's arse using Apple Pay. :)  

10/10 would do it again. 
Damn millenials! Responsible for every ill down on Earth...

Those are the only apps I found useful for me. But check out the recommended apps by exploring r/applewatch :) 

Enjoy anyway 
Pre auth in France is this : 

That means that they see if they can charge your card (ie : check the numbers / name). They also make your bank "block" the money on your card, so it can be charged on shipping day of the day before. 
My Apple leather folio case is expected to arrive today, while my X is planned to arrive home on november 30.

I'm sad as this case will be a reminder that my phone is still not here :( 
No actually I believe that you have 14 days to come and pickup your phone, until it gets released to new Customer. Obviously it's best to call the store or give them a visit to explain the situation. 

Hope this helps. 
Oh, then my watch is not working correctly too! I have the same problem 
You can get nice apps on the App Store : 

Transit : Surroundings public transport services and countdown before they get to the stop. 
Carrot Weather : Accurate weather app (with a bit of fun hidden Inside, I'll let you check it :p)
Autosleep : Automatic sleep tracker 
Heartwatch : Tracks your heart rate and some other things (works well with autosleep). 

I put Shazam on my Watch too (easier than getting the phone). 
I currently have a 7+ bought in january and picked up the S3 SS Cellular this month. I preordered the X to replace my 7+ because it's just too sexy for me to handle the hype :)
DND is working as intended. I don't get it. If you really want to pick up your notifications use your phone and that's it? 
Only time will be able to tell us the devs’ laziness or not 
It’s when the user base becomes large enough to pay for the fees. Right now it’s not so they charge each user every time they update. 

The objective is to get a 1time billing to be profitable I guess? 
Nice ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
To tag a user use just type :

Mine is still working. Latest Update of both my iPhone (7+) and watch (S3 SS Cellular). 

And never had a drop like some people said. ^yet

Beam - The orchestral mix is my commuting music almost every day. I just love it 
And here I was crying because my delivery date through my carrier in France is 11/30/2017 :( 
I... know
I plan on using my Milanese every day (that’s what I’m doing) and use my sport loop for the swimming sessions, and fitness)
Is it? 
same fear. The preorder is at 9:00 am in France on the 27 and it's my time of arrival at work. The thing is the cellular isn't good in my building but I need to be at work because of a meeting. I've never been so stressed in my life :( 
. 
My Watch was shipped with a milanese band, and I buoght the sport loop for... you guessed it! SPORT. 

But I've not done any sport yet ^^ 

Edit : Bought and not “buoght” 
Yes in 256 GB <3
wat? I don't agree at all (4k Videos, live pictures, heaviers apps, etc). 

I see that you can point out streaming services but I dislike it, and in the metro or suburban trains the signal may not be that good. 
Damn battery is going to suffer from this 
I was wondering if the folio case is subject to demagnetization, because the card holder is in front of the screen (See link below). 

Thank you if anyone has an anwser because I plan on buying this case with my X tomorrow :)

Holy Shit! And here I was crying that in France the iPhone X 256GB is going to be 1 571$... 

Damn that's 300 more $ there wow 

Edit : Just to clarify, for today's current exchange rate, 1329€ (iPhone X 256 GB's price in France) is 1571$ 
r/kingdomofporn for the lazy 
Fuck, me too... 
I’m more of a guy who tries things before judging that’s it. Because there is always a big difference between the paper and the reality. 
Sigh... ^Third-Party 

I kinda dislike buying third party things that are related to the cables or powering. Always scared of damaging my gagets (iPhone or anything else). 

But for bands, cases, that's another story :) 
Or just stop using the AM/PM system and use the "military" clock (As someone from a country where we use the 24h clock I just hate the 12h clock :( )
I agree with u/FrigginGuy. Why would you wear an AW in a place where you fear either for you or for your items? 

And this problem isn't specific to the AW, but with regular watches too like Tissot, Seiko, Rolex etc... 

But to finish, I guess you shouldn't be worried about your band being easy to be pulled off. I disagree with u/abunnylivesinside for the milanese band. I've got one myselft and I challenged my brother to take my Watch off my wrist by force. The magnet and the AW links are good enough. And that's even better with real "locks" (don't know the word in English), like the sport band or something like this. 

Anyway good luck with your choice :) 

Edit : Words
I always heard that when you were feeling thirsty you were already a bit dehydrated. 
How can you say that's it's better even when "It's not available yet"? 

I don't get it :/ 

^(Justasking)
IKR!? I think they are doing some^BlackMagic
Be happy... In France for exemple there is only 1 carrier (over 4) that supports the Apple Watch Series 3 Cellular... 

Thank god they were already my carrier :) 
Autosleep has been great since their 4.0 version also. 

And the thing is that it's being automatic, as it tracks movement. Quite accurate also. I like it :)
For the story I actually like being looked at like a demigod when I'm paying with Apple Pay in Germany (French's banks are cool on this matter, as AP has been available for quite a while now). :)
I'm French myself and I've been an Apple Pay user basically since it came out (My bank, BPCE (Banque Populaire Caisse d'Epargne), has been pushing it since day 1 of it's availability).

I've found myself using my phone to pay almost every time I could (although the limit per use is the same as the Credit Card (20€ / payment), and it's fast to be limited). 

They are going to up the limit to 30€ / transaction soon^tm btw. 
But what about musics, apps etc? I've got currently 75 GB used on my 7+ :( 

That makes me forced to buy the X 129GB too and this shit hurts... It's going to be 1330€ in France ouch
I think I'll go for the Apple folio case. I know it's fucking expensive but I find it so nice looking! 

Probably in blue with silver iPhone X :)

Browsing "new" in askreddit. 

I'm bored at work yeah... Thank god there is still 1 hour and 15 minutes to go! 
Damn it looks great, but... the price :( 

I guess I'll add it on my Christmas List :)
oh cool! I hope i’ll get it next week then :) 

Thank you again fellow redditor ;) 
Nice pun there
And I’ve got one more question, if you don’t mind? 

What are the delivering times? Because I didn’t find it after ordering the band. 
[Speidel](http://www.speidel.com/index.php/apple-watch-bands/00139902.html) makes good bands. They have a good history of making Watch bands, and it looks like their AW bands are sick. I ordered one, I can show it when I receive it! :)

Edit : spelling
!Redditsilver
Oh thank you very much! A 15$ shipping cost is WAYY better ahah. 

I was sad because I was very interested in those bands! You saved me thank you kind redditor!  

!RedditSilver

Edit : Doesn't work ... :( 
Holy sh*t! I was going to order one on their website, then they applied the delivery cost to France, and then I just laughed at the website's face. 

They were trying to charge me 125$ for international delivery. So that's almost 3 bands JUST IN DELIVERY fee. What the heck is wrong with this. 

If someone knows where I can get those models in Europe I would be grateful! 

Thanks (sorry for the broken English by the way)...
I’m sorry I’m late and if this has already been asked, but what about the ISS ? (Assuming it will still en in use)...
I find that the Shadow is adding a little "something" to this pic. 

Great pic OP! :) 
Alright thanks for the tip! :)
Oh nice! I wanted a milanese but I ordered exactly this one too because the reviews were nice and so were the buyers’ pics. I’m glad then if it’s a nice one 👍🏻 

Edit : I can’t wait to get the delivery guy or gal showing up on my doorstep to hand me my first AW! (Series 3 Cellular Aluminium in 42mm). 
Good bot ♡ 
Im sad there is no black or silver left for 4mm watch :(

Edit : Obviously I meant 42 mm and not 4 mm! I’m not a tiny human. 
Idd ! 
Now I REALLY hope for the hitboxes to get fixed. I look forward to that GIF or Video of you eating toothpaste :)

Not found :(
TGV are the High Speed Trains in France. Never had any problem in my 22 years of using them almost monthly, across France. 

And I'm not saying it because I'm French, but because I believe I have enough experience with travelling in my own country with the many different types of trains (TGV/High Speed Trains; TER/Express regional train; and Transilien/RER Suburban trains in the Paris area). 

Don't confuse them with RER or Transilien, which are the suburban trains for the Paris area (Île de France) which is a lower quality train. 
Let me know if you find the answer please! 😏
Anyone got the specific video?
I think it's not possible for an open visit, because many locs are still "drivable" (is that proper English?) and that some trains gets to pass around in the main lines just close to the parked trains. (Security concerns and law forbidding people about getting on the railroad allowance).

In France you need to be allowed formally to get on the tracks, otherwise you could be prosecuted if found by the Railway Police. 

But if you get some contacts with the local company slicing those machines or some SNCF Staff they can make you visit (extremely rare, even for me or a SNCF worker). 
Oh man I have used this expression for a while now and I just found out that there was a subreddit for it! Damn thanks for the hours of fun incoming :)
Exactly this! EU "regulation" sucks on this part. Private rail company is a very bad idea.
They do sell they to a company that scraps them. The thing is that no company would take them because they are not brand new, and it would cost money to repair them as they are. 

They would have been able to use them first because it was supposed to be a temporary solution by sticking them here. But the temporary soon became permanent as the freight never really recovered from the crisis, and that many other companies are running freight lines all over Europe. 
Sadly it's been again on the table with the election of the pro liberalization Macron... He's ready to sell us piece by piece to his friends of big companies like Transdev, and some other private companies... 

But it's obvious that we will fight to try to save our pride... 
Damn this girl is curvy just the perfect way... I'm in love (again) <3
Sadly it already started with a law in 2014 (most important law concerning the rail sector in France in decades and splitting the SNCF Group in 3 entities). SNCF Holding (Directors' Board and strategic development) SNCF Réseau (Infrastructure) : rail maintenance, powering of the trains etc) and finally SNCF Mobilité (Mobility) in charge of planning the trains, and making them run with their mechanics etc. 

Since 1 January 2015 SNCF consists of five divisions (split
in the 3 separate companies seen before). 

     SNCF Réseau is the infrastructure division of SNCF, and carries out track and other infrastructure maintenance, design and construction. Subsidiaries in the group include Systra, Inexia and SNCF International.

     SNCF Voyages is responsible for passenger transport. Constituent parts include TGV, TER, Transilien and Intercités (formerly Corail Intercités, Lunéa and Téoz).

     Keolis is responsible for urban transport (tramways, bus networks).

      SNCF Logistics is the rail and general freight logistics section of SNCF, including Fret SNCF, VFLI and other European rail freight companies (since 2010 collected under the brand Captrain), as well as rail-freight stock management companies including France Wagons and Ermewa.

      SNCF Immobilier. (They own very SNCF buildings).

Indeed, but we went from governments who understood the NEED for a good rail work system and managed to get amazing things out like the TGV [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TGV) and forced it upon Europe (Eurostar TGV between the U.K. and France, and later expanded and started including Belgium, NL soon etc; TGV Lyria, Thalys etc...) 

Now the company is on the edge to being privatized which saddens most of the workers, but the customers think they can get lower prices and better service with upcoming private companies... (What a joke... just take a look at UK s rail work and see that they want to go back to public service). 
Indeed. But it's mostly inhabited by the company that works for us to scavenge the trains, and take what can be saved as parts for the remaining working trains, and some dudes who like to steal copper and other metals...
Sadly, many trains here have not even reached half of their planned lifespan... That's very sad that the crisis came in 2008/2009 and stopped the expansion of the rail transport. 

And it's even more frustrating that in France, we have a wonderful railroad all around our country, but no government took a step forward to push the companies to use railroad transport instead of the polluting truck transport... 

Sincerely, 

A random french railway worker. 
Additional info : 

Sotteville-lès-Rouen in northern France is a suburb of Rouen. It has an extensive yard and the Quatre-Mares railway workshops. Due to a combination of the economic downturn and competition many unused locos have been dumped in the yard. In 2010 Sotteville yard held over 100 engines and in 2014 it held more than 430 stopped locomotives.

As a French rail worker (SNCF), this saddens me so much to see valuable machines left for dead in this place... 
Usually they do. It's maybe because the plane was on another parking spot prior or in maintenance and it wasn't worth it to start the engines to move it, so they used the airport truck to move it.
Let me believe! :( 
Not very old 
Well that was what was implied. I basically told her to send me back if she did not like who I was. (A jerk at the time)
I am an adopted child (from Russia), by a French mother.

When she was angry at me for something I didn't make properly, or the chores not done, or something else, I told her she could join the "customer service" and try to make the warranty work as I was not working as intended. 

Now that I'm 22, I feel so bad for telling this her... :(
We say GIF like in English :>
Yes please! The LAAT is my fav ship in SW (appart for capital ships). Make it possible!
