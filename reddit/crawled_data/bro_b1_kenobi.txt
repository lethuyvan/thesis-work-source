Yeah there's Tumblr gifs and this... This is like a telegraph gif.
It's after they redesigned the uniforms to a two piece top. His top uniform is still Command Red, but the bottom part, an purple-grey undershirt, is shared by all class of officers. They are usually worn separate as an informal uniform when off duty. Later (movies, DS9) this design was inverted (colors inside, purple-grey top)

He's wearing it here because he was off duty when unexpectedly transported to the surface with an alien captain. Like other user said, Darmok is one of the best episodes of all Star Trek, DEFINITELY watch it.

I think Grosjean is an early contender for my favorite F1 driver... I'm guessing this is before the race starts *and* he did that twice this season?! Poor guy.
By "celebrity" could have been a cover for something else that... Wouldn't care about such laws.

As for legality, it definitely violates international maritime law, not sure about DR's. If the USCG/USN caught you doing that shit, theyd probably treat you as a pirate.

I feel like I could appreciate the subtle techniques rather than wanting to see crashes and who wins (that's fun too though). I enjoy soccer a lot and as any fan of the sport would tell you, it's not just the goals that's makes it entertaining, but the technical progression between two teams as well.
Yeah I do enjoy WWC just wish it was more readily available to watch online.
Damn, I gotta get into F1
As a poly dude, damn how much more do you need?! If Jeri was my wife, I'd probably go monogamous haha.

My brother in law did exactly this. Said he was nervous as hell trying to clutch the secret shell in his BC.
Golden Gate Park was designed by the same guy as Central Park, he preferred GGP because the city let him "hide" all the monuments and statues inside the natural landscape design of the park.

Also GGP *feels* like a natural forest, it's designed as such there's no simple egress from one side to the other, creating a sense of being able to lose yourself in it. Which you def can.

I liked that for a brief moment, both leaders gestured to each other to enter their respective countries simultaneously. Pretty powerful images today.
Haha that sounds almost surreal.
I live with a married lesbian couple. They call it shark week whenever they're aligned. It's funny, but also a reminder to give them a wide berth haha.
Reminds me of that Bill Burr skit. He's like black people got it right, they put the fucking on the end. When I say "this mother fuckin asian" people are like woooww slow down. When a black dude says "this asian mother fucker" people don't notice the mother fucker.
Damn. I got a lot of respect for that guy. He didn't just take some ceremonial position. The guy was a fuckin Apache gunner stationed at a FOB.

"The second deadliest thing in the system is a UN Marine" - Bobbie Draper, MMC

Also Fred Johnson was was Colonel in the UNMC and they're mentioned more in the books.
Yeah they could have been just armored UNN security - def not a power suit though - which seems like the one from S3E3 is
Ah yeah you're right, he was a friend of Bobbie's
He was wearing armor, but what looked like standard body armor (ie the guys at the UN building on Earth) with a vac-suit. This is the first we've seen what looks like UNMC power armor.

["standard" UN armor](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/01/6e/9a/016e9a3790d0f7e7f7b6c6076a1824b5.jpg) kinda closer to what Johnson was wearing.
Funny because it's a sign of disrespect/untrust in the US - after desegregation, many people working would place the money on the counter for african americans. The crazy thing is living in Brooklyn I see it today from the other perspective, african americans placing money on the counter. I wonder if it's some sort of social conditioning from generations of distrust and mistreatment.
In the books they mention the UNMC have powered suites like the MMC's but less advanced. They also mention UNMC using powered mechs too (CW IIRC) when Bobbie fights the PM monster alongside UNMC on Ganymede.
More like ReDANNNNG Island amirite? Guys...?
Sidenote: when we gettin the Roci back? #bringbacktheroci!
Also seeing Earth's planetary defenses in action was fuckin sweet. Watching them pick off 19 nukes like gnats was awesome. I'm surprised they only let 1 get through.
They also did a great job illustrating that it's a generation behind MCRN ships. The loose wires, electrical issues, and cramped CIC all highlight she's an old bird \(also how the Admiral talks to the ship was a nice touch\). Compared to the Donenger, it feels old and out of date, but I love its aesthetics.

I'm in the same boat. Just started playing FFVII again (via steam link w/ steam controller on my projector) and bought a Brady Games guide on eBay to use alongside the game. Just like my childhood... Used to read it in class eagerly deciding what I was going to work on when I got home.

That and I've completely forgotten all the secrets in that game haha.

PS - aside from the US, New Zealand has lead more expeditions of Antarctica than any other nation. My buddy works for NASA Antarctica and he said they'd often venture out to the Kiwi's compound because they had better booze and movies.

Double PS - NASA is using McMurdo Station, AN as a case study for how humans could apply sustainability practicies and a semi psychological barometer for off-word colonies like Mars.

How the fuck did the security guy escape the white faced dudes?! He just pops back up on the shore like "Hey what's up guys? Yeah the park is pretty fucked right?"

Also, damn QA has to be like an all time record worst security force. They let a few dudes armed with antiques go kill hundreds of people while armed with P90s - that shoot like 800rpm recoilless... All without alerting the outside.

You try Lagorith (sp?) AVI? It's a pretty good alternative intermediary. I once used it for some specialized plugins my colleague had in AE (prior to directlink). I hear DNxHD/DNxHR (the Avid one) is solid too - also works with Premiere.

ProRes is still the standard though. It is so flexible
Yup. Really wish Apple would officially release the liscense even for a fee. I'd pay $300 to encode ProRes on my home workstation.

Yup. Production company that switched to Adobe and used to OSX. Also ProRes, a common intermediary, is pretty complicated to get on Win10 (not MS fault).

My home workstation is PC though.

What about Dell's 5K panel? It's not too steep.
Naw if it's the highest end iMP then it's well over $10K - Dual Intel Xeon E7 16c, 1Tb DDR4,   Vega GPU, PCIe SSD etc

OP is right though, it's Apple's first decent spec computer in a while, but there's no fuckin way it won't have CRAZY heating problems cramming all that in the back of a monitor... I've seen previous gen i7 iM fans scream trying to cool itself off. They're already releasing a new Mac Pro design this year (super rare)- a sign that the iMP was probably a mistake

Also, as usual, has shit I/O and PC identical specs is cheaper.
Except not as good of a lawyer
Oh believe me, we know. This sub has a collective fear of this show being cancelled. Which would suck since there is going to be 9 books + novellas to draw from...

Sadly, I feel like Syfy shouldn't take on massive shows like a space opera. They don't have the adshare and auidence like HBO/Netflix/APV does, honestly it's irresponsible. But maybe they'll put it off.

The good news is it made #7 on Amazon top shows and I've seen some random comments on the show on other subs... Just keep spreadin da word baretna.

Don't forget Little Five Points for the eclectic side of the city. Solid thrift and vinyl shops. And EAV/Edgewood (home to MLK's church also) for nightlife.

Aside from the parts where he get's donations from across the system, I agree. I love the show Prax more than the books Prax so far.
Yeah I do like it goes by stardate. Think I'll use this one as a watch order instead with TAS/DSC shoehorned in.
Just check any post mildly criticizing DSC. I gets brigaded by bots pretty heavily. The nature of discourse in this sub has *dramatically* changed since Aug 2017.

I wrote a comment about it a few months ago. Everyone who commented in a an extreme response on mine, and a few other threads that wanted to dissect DSC's canon in a reasonable way, were created exactly 11mo prior to the premiere of DSC...
It's pretty common knowledge that /r/StarTrek is infected with bots... Ever since the premiere of DSC.
Hmm.. I like that it includes temporal anomalies. But no DSC/TAS.
Yeah.. I use semi-release clips like a goof. Either way, I cant see how these are better than clips/springs. Even more so... I can't imagine you get nearly as much thrust from your tow tips than the fins being around your entire foot. My guess these are more for free divers than SCUBA divers.
Yeah, but the update after them [look fuckin sweet](https://pre00.deviantart.net/b2f5/th/pre/f/2014/198/3/f/phaser_rifle__24th_century__tech_readout__new__by_unusualsuspex-d7qzf78.jpg)

Still, my fav is the [MACO Particle Carbine](https://pre00.deviantart.net/7865/th/pre/f/2014/163/7/f/maco_particle_rifle__22nd_century__tech_readout_by_unusualsuspex-d7jvuor.jpg) - they look like proper naval ship warfare rifles. Short and compact for close quarter, room to room combat, and customizable for ranged engagements.
Did Abrams really say that?!
I felt the same way, until I powered through Season 1. It actually gets a lot better. Season 3 might be one of the coolest story lines in all of Trek.
Well that's it. Time to make a trip to New Hampshire! Anything I can do while there that's fun? Never been to NH, might as well find something fun to do.

Current resident of Brooklyn, former San Franciscan can confirm. BART is like the Renoir of strange shit you'll see on a subway.

That would be a pretty big NDA breach
This is so great. The fact that the show is a smaller budget kinda makes it better... Restraints make artist just that more creative. Also you guys seem to be a family makes it even better. Good luck with season 3!
Naw he didn't "switch" in the books, just said something like why he follows his captain. Because he's his moral compass.
That wouldn't make sense though. Dawes would never want to live on a planet. It only makes sense if a Martian does it.

A) Great username. 

B) As a fellow filmmaker, I am urging all my colleagues and friends to do the same and watch too. This really is one of the BEST TV shows on right now - not just Sci-fi. George RR Martin's critique of it really highlights how amazing the show really is.

C) Finally, how is it working on the show? Seems like it's put together with so much love - really respects the source material and everything from the chemistry of talent, set design, and editing flow perfectly.
Think about it, last season they mention the "cry outs" of the Ganymede PM when Eros hit Venus.. So yes, it would seem that the PM can communicate in *realtime* - ie faster than light.

For more info, check the books. Can't say more than that.
Soooo... Drummer doing pull ups while still bleeding.... HHHNGG
 In the trailers for S3, I could've sworn I saw Earth being bombed. Think we'll get the rocks falling on Earth this season?

Oh it better be MOTHER FUCKIN THOMAS JANE! I shall sharpen my pitchfork in the event it's not.
ALL ABOARD DAT IO TRAIN. TOOT TOOT!
I disagree, I think she's Pa. I know Bull had the background with Johnson, but he was UNMC, Drummer is pure Belter. 

Which leads me to think she's Pa, not only because Johnson asks her to go to the Nauvoo, but because the show really is setting her up to be the real future leader of the Belters, the President of the Transport Union - ie her saying Dawes is shit, etc
Quick question: Drummer in the show is Pa right? Think I remember reading somewhere they combined the characters for the show.
Is it [this](https://i.imgur.com/iUbChSy.png)?
Agreed. Several times in the books Amos mentions Holden as being "the guy who makes the right choices, ones I wouldn't make and that's why I follow him" etc. Admitting he'd be a psychopath if it wasn't for Holden's morality.

Basically WWJHD
Haha Intel i9000, *Miller Inside*
https://i.imgur.com/vB9B5.gifv

Naw like /u/pancake117 said, it'll prob be a way for them to reunite as a family - ie Prax saying "we must be reborn from the ashes". Prob when Holden addresses the system again telling everyone what's up, almost certainly after he gets back on Naomi's sweet Belta ass.

So I'm just assuming it's just a writing tool to signify their alliances to each other. Otherwise we gotta start a #BringBackdaRoci on twitter haha
Yeah was 100% Dawes. Just think the choice to give him a shitty profile picture just added to his "underground mystique" credibility.

That being said, with the pace of this show I'm SUPER excited to see the Duarte reveal... dollars to doughnuts we see him this season at least as an introductory, background character. Maybe in a random scene of the UNN and MCRN fighting we go aboard a Martian ship and randomly see a mid level officer with the nameplate "Duarte"...
Drummer is such a badass. When she executed those two OPA guys and walked away after being gut shot...

Shame though, kinda liked that one OPA guy before he committed treason.

Head on over to /r/TheExpanse for all your Expansey needs.

So happy to see this show on the front page. It really is the best modern space opera, and Syfy has done a surprisingly good job for their brand by carrying it. George RR Martin said if Game of Thrones was in space, these are the books he'd want to write. 
My grandpa was a dive bomber in the USN during the Pacific WWII. Still amazed he lived through all of that + flying the first naval jets in Korea.
I think a lot of that comes from Georgia being a relatively well off state compared to the rest of the South with some solid education programs.

I too grew up in rural Georgia, and yeah it's strange to think there's so many racist asshats around us. For a reference, the most overtly racist thing I've ever seen happened while I lived in California - my mixed race couple friends (also from GA) got openly harassed in a bar. I was dumbfound, because that shit would never fly anywhere I lived in GA. Especially in Atlanta, that would be a one way ticket to an ass beating.
As Georgian raised in a small town by cultured, wordly parents I can say we're not all the strerotype. I'm definitely in the minority coming from a Southern liberal family, but even that aside, I know a lot of good people from living there. None of which hold prejudices against others for being any kind of different from themselves.
Then it's war.
Pretty sure Amos would be smiling as she crushes him.

As a filmmaker, I didn't realize I immulated Steve Jobs' management style. I surround myself with people more talented than me. A PA once suggested a different way to shoot a scene on set that changed the ending. I took it and I'm convinced it's why I got the film in festivals.

It's something you have to rigorously train for, and requires a great deal of prep and planning, which I enjoy.

But the real thrill, as the other Redditor mentioned, is what you can find swimming below the surface of our planet. It is definitely different than what you see in open water and it really is like being on a different planet as the things down there exist nowhere else on Earth.

It's also a lot of work to get through the caves to the cool stuff, like "pinches" which is where the cave walls are so narrow you have to literally contort yourself through as it's too tight for you+your tank. Which makes it more rewarding.

It's only as dangerous as your training. Like any high risk activity, you're specially trained repeatedly over a long period of time. For instance, my instructor (former USN Master Diver) would routinely rip our mask/regulators off without warning to simulate the real terror of it. While in a cave that had dead 0 visibility (torches don't work) due to high salinity, I got stuck in a pinch and lost my regulatory/mask. Because of my training, I was able to calmly stop myself from drowning in the dark.
Huh? 9/11 happened on Republican watch. Obama (he's black btw) ordered the deaths of more foreign military leaders than any president since WWII.

Actually not really. There's speculation of /r/StarTrek boting since the release of STD. A LOT of the randomly hostile posts against anyone genuinely questioning STDs direction come from accounts all created exactly 11mo prior to the August release.

Not saying it's the case here, but there definitely has been a big paradigm shift in the way people bash anyone asking some pretty obvious questions since STD. People disliked the last movies, sure, but they didn't get nearly as much brigading as STD "fans" give. Why I mostly stay in other ST subs...

Am I the only one who wants to see some goddamn UNN Marines? I was so hoping theyd show what they look like. In my own head cannon, it would've been fuckin sweet to see the UNN Marines make it to Draper's MMC team and turn to fight alongside before they all inevitably fail against the proto beast. 

A professional Marine like Draper would've instantly realized the UN team were retreating against some sort of powerful aggressor (their tech being in the same ballpark as MMC) and prob would've at least tried to combine forces at least to improve surviability of her own grunts. Both in the books and the show, it's pretty obvious she notices there's a 3rd element on the ground and they're thrashing the UN Marines, just makes sense more in my mind that way.

I know the UNMC is more outdated than the MMC, but it would be cool to see what their power mechs look like.

DayZ SO is the greatest example of "Alphaization" in the industry. They botched so many things along the way, but it's a good learning experience.

The biggest problem with the game is hiring a [overtly cocky] modder to lead the dev team. BIS is renowned for their maticuously crafted games, and clearly the matching between the two was a failure. Modding =/= game dev. He took a popular mod and tried to shoehorn his own code leading to rewriting the engine. The engine, VRBS, which BIS has made for the US DOD is over 10 years old and doesn't do well to amateur changes - there's a reason why Arma releases are 5 years apart.

Games like Arma turn out AMAZING mods from a dedicated community, and I can see the appeal of trying to make some money and recreate the success of CS, but it almost never works. See also: the buggy PUBG, another game based off an Arma mod. 
Yeah, they tried to rewrite code of a 10 year before of engine... Not a great idea.

Naw it's not as emotionally intense as Tears of The Sun or Blood Diamond, it's more like Siege of Firebase Gloria or 13 Hours.

I'd highly recommend it. It's a great example of how both disorganized and cocky the UN were in their early days. Jadotville was a turning point in their military strategies.

Moved to NYC last year. I learned to deal with the filth of SOMA, but I can say it's nice to actually be in clean streets again.

Yeah, Brooklyn is cleaner than SF...
Can confirm: seen several people defecate in broad daylight in SF. Former San Francisco resident of SOMA in NYC. First thing I noticed when I moved here was, "wow this city is like, way cleaner than I thought." I would routinely have to avoid stepping on needles, human/dog shit (yes I can tell the difference... sadly), and dozens of homeless screaming at walls/each other/people. You get used to it, but I've been to developing countries that were cleaner.

San Francisco is **miles** away filthier than here. Even after the snow trash piles, NYC is far more effective at cleaning its streets and managing waste.

That makes sense because the 1701 was the first long range 5yr+ starship. The 1701-C I know was a newer design, but less familiar with. And the 1701-E was a super heavy cruiser loaded with experimental Quantum Torpedos. Also the Excelsior was originally NX-2000. It's logical these would be "Skunkworks" projects.

The 1701-D naturally was made in Utopia Planicia because it was eventually meant to replace the existing Constitution Class in service as the bulk of Starfleet heavy cruisers, and thus required Mars' larger production facilities. 
Yeah, I was just referring to the fact that ships were mostly stopped in production in San Francisco, except for the experimental NX designated ships. Seems like Starfleet wanted to play their cards close to their chest when it came to building the latest, classified ships like the NX-74205, the first sanctioned Starfleet cloaked ship. So, probably for security reasons, they constructed these vessels at Starfleet command instead of Utopia Plancia which doesnt just construct NCC ships, but civilian vessels as well.
Was lucky to snag a ticket from my sister a couple years ago (the wait is months long). Holy shitsnacks it's **fucking intense**. The curators are extremely effective at forcing the visitors to come as close to feeling what it's like to be black in America. After I left I shakingly smoked half a pack. 

They also, ingeniously, added a gourmet cafeteria at the end featuring African American cuisines from around the country. Do not avoid this, you will need that 3 course meal of soul food after you disembark from that emotional roller-coaster. 
Late to the party, but I have CA plates, which use both O and 0 in them. Naturally the NYPD parking tickets are incorrect and display the incorrect plate numbers. Since they failed to input my VIN (expect for 1) I'm not paying the tickets. Only wish I could reregister my car to CA and keep these plate numbers. Maybe I'll pay the $50 and get something like "9D013O", see if it pays itself off in the future.
Also San Francisco Fleet Yards is where the NX-01(first Starfleet USS Enterprise) was built. IIRC the SFFY wasn't used much after the creation of Utopia Planicia Fleet Yards on Mars until the Dominion Wars, when Starfleet continued the NX line with the NX-74205 (USS Defiant). Basically Starfleet's Skunkworks. 
Thought the same thing. But that's half my life. So it's not so bad.

Yeah that's what I mean. The spore drive is an FTL jump drive, whereas warp is just a factor of c. Warp isn't *slow*, but the spore drive is instintanious. Which doesn't exist in Star Trek even up to DS9 era (100+ years later).

And honestly that's kinda my biggest problem with the show. They want to make a prequel because they sell better, but shoehorn tech that would be perfectly fine in a sequel. I not saying the ship has to have nobs and tube TVs like TOS but you can't put something like the spore drive in. It basically nullifies the entire series of Voyager. 
I heard they had some explanation of the Kelvin Klingon looks? Also are they still FTLing across space? That eventually has to be explained why 1701-A, the flagship of Starfleet, doesn't have that tech 10-20 years later...

Naw Posse Comitatus prevents that luckily.

Exactly. Is there a lion overpopulation issue? No. Now, a rancher killing a lion preying on his stock, that's an exception and legal in SA.

>And I am, beyond a shadow of a doubt, certain conservation officers have hunters kill the biggest, oldest members of animal groups because (I know the whole alpha, beta, ect systems false but) essentially they grow into alpha males, and claim every female as their own, not letting the young healthy animals breed, which severely fucks the overall group health by making inbreeding all the more common.

As a hunter, you only hunt for 2 reasons: culling a population, and/or to eat. Hunting a "soft caged" animal for trophies gives the rest of us a bad name.

First off, no idea where you got the info on "old, forced out" stock, but nature has its own way of taking care of that. The money spent on this is large, and having been to several developing countries, I can assure you very little if none of it's going to conservation.

Finally, "canned" lion hunting is illegal in South Africa. So no matter how much you project your insecurities, it shouldn't be done. There's no grey area, period.

I've seen these in person. They are profoundly beautiful, no photo does them justice. Blows my mind the Japanese people would be so generous in not just donating such a priceless piece of their cultural heritage, but give it to the very transgressors that nearly destroyed it.

dB is more accurate measure than percentages because it's the actual output of sound pressure.

It's negative because 0dB is the maximum optimum output for the signal, you can go over it (~+5dB) but it may lead to distortion. Since you can't go over 100%, it's more accurate to use the dB system as well. Furthermore, .5 increments are just more precise adjustment than 2 or 5%.

For my setup, I typically play movies at "full sound" around -12 to - 18dB. Anything past that and I risk shaking my neighbors. 
Until ya get a decent receiver, then it's .5dB increments.

The way they describe the view of the ring in NG (no spoilers) lends me to think the opening is pretty wide, so two ships could probably fit in it pretty easily.

I mean, he did compose the entire musical part of Moana. Honestly, it's more fascinating to hear Dwayne Johnson sing it as he's had, AFAIK, zero background in singing and because he adds Maui's character so well in the song. 
I'm less concerned with violence in DSC than the crews *confrontational aditude* towards each other. It reeks of comic book style of "let's just fight for the sake of it" (ala MCU). Which, lMO, really misses the whole point of Starfleet and Star Trek.

Tension between crewmembers is one thing, but outright discent and "squaring off" is something I'd think would get your ass court martialed. After all Starfleet is loosely based off Roddenberrys service in the Army Air Force.

Damn I think I'm even more lucky, I don't know how I'd cope with speech impediment. For the most part, the only noticible symptoms are retelling the same stories or jokes. Internally, I do struggle trying to manage tasks, which I typically manage well with higher order stuff (work, etc) but I do occasionally double clean things like laundry or vacuuming. Lists definitely help.

The worst is when things become kinda fuzzy. I cant tell you what I ate the previous night or what time I woke up. Which can be annoying and dangerous. Luckily my longterm memory is fine, so if something is done enough times or put to muscle memory, I'm totally fine.

The best example of that is in my work (post production film). I have to double and triple check new footage imported (super basic process to anyone else), but I can tell you verbatim how to do complex tasks like match framing, proxy linking, the hiarchy of timelines, and every codec's optimized bitrates and their appropriate application - things some seasoned editors have to lookup.

Oh and I also spend an inordinate amount of time looking for my keys and wallet if I clumsily forget to put them in their home. Everything has "a home" at my house, if things stay static, I can't forget its location (muscle memory) - one benefit of shit memory is organizational skills. Silver lining I guess haha.

Haha this was my first coop mission, after playing a bit of solo. I loved it. Had me blind firing several times as we approached the final standoff part, just like the movie. My team formed a star pattern around the ammo chest and on comms we were like "look for his tell-tale shimmer" and making the clicking noises. 

Only took us two tries to get the mechanics right: break LOS on lasers, shoot him often in stealth, and dodge his drone attacks. It was a really fun intro to coop and really felt like I was fighting the Predator. Probably helped I had a great team I randomly joined.

Omg... Is that where the band name came from? I feel so stupid right now.

I just finished watching Episode I in preparation for Episode VIII. After seeing him pumble Maul for killing his master (and remembing him absolutely devistating Anakin in III), I  literally said a loud, "Don't EVER piss off Obi-Wan." He's a berserker style fighter: someone who uses overwhelming force in a fast, unrelenting assault to make an opponent submit. And it's something rare in a Jedi, because they're usually more reserved, using their enemy's power against them. We also see this display of furious, blindly fast retaliation in IV when, almost unprovoked, he cuts off the arm of a dude starting a bar fight.

But no one alive can display the utter brilliance that is the civilized warrior of Obi-Wan Kenobi as well as Ewan McGregor. I could be biased though...

Being that it's Reserves unit, could it be they the US government actually gives a shred of a damn about antiquities? 

Look, if we wanted to cement ourselves as the moral authority we claim to be, what better way than to use our most volunteer of  volunteer soliders (Reservist) towards recovering humanity's most precious artifacts? If this truly is the case, then I have a whole new level of profound respect for the US armed forces... 
I agree with you that the majority of Star Trek series needed to "find its legs" after the first season. TNG probably being the prime example (with S3 bringing back Gates McFadden). Knowing that, I gave DSC a healthy, wide berth: I told myself I'd withhold judgment until after S1, but it you note my comment history, I just couldn't. The simple fact is that while a lot of Trek had rough takeoffs, DSC really only paves its way towards disaster on various levels. Not least of which is a quality of writing that would fail you out of any film or creative writing program. 

But I'll say it here and now as both a professional filmmaker and a cynic of Seth MacFarlane: The Orville *will* have more seasons than Star Trek Discovery. And it's because of writing.    
True. I'm thinking through the optics of someone who lived in Denmark, not visiting for a week. 
So the USCG is one big reserves branch? I always thought they were an independent, military police force. 

In times of war, as a domestic coastal police force, how do they avoid Posse Comitatus? Interestingly, the only modern story that could involve that question: "The Last Ship" never answered that question. I guess it makes sense, it's about the USN, but I think if shit really hit the fan *that* badly, the USCG would be one of the first responders.    

On a technical level, I get that the USN would assume command of the USCG in that their typically more seasoned commanders, but USCG officers go to school in Connecticut, not Annapolis like their USN/USMC cousins... 
*looks up*

Yeah fuck this.

Naw theyre just that stealthy. Hiding in the snow endlessly bidding their time. 
Why I've been sticking to /r/DaystromInstitute and /r/StarTrekGifs. I'm not entirely convinced the torrent of pro DSC comments and shockingly attacking anyone who mildly disagrees isn't some sort of bot/paid account war. I remember around episode 6, I saw a ton of users slam people who questioned DSC (not saying any antiSJC stuff too) and every user was suspeciously exactly like 11mo old. 

I mean there's no way there's so many tyrannical Trekies who both love DSC and think "omg big deal the timeline is ruined". Unless ST 2009 really did pick up a whole bunch of new fans that prefer that style. 

Anyway here's the bottom line. I don't give a shit about their casting of minorities, forget the blaring time change, and even the untrek like style: Star Trek Discovery, at its core, is just plain poorly written. There's little emotional development of characters, I don't care what happens to them, and several performances only highlight those flaws (1st officer and CMO in particular). Not to mention several plot holes that no other TV show would have: "oh we need to have the crew prove their worth to themselves" OK, cut to captain on a small shuttle with ZERO setup to why. Just to shoehorn his obvious capture to then give us r guided tour of watching the crew work together.   

It just sucks because Star Trek has given us great sagas like The Dominion Wars, physics based mind benders like Time Squared, the first African American woman kissed by a white man on TV, and the legendary well written and performed Chain of Command... But now we have people yelling at each other constantly in space + lens flairs. Yay.

Check the course offering throughout the previous year. Sometimes different professors are available during different parts of the year for various reasons (adjuct, etc). Doing this saved me from one of my institution's least liked professors. Just opted to complete the remainder of my electives all at once instead. 

Mind you, he was disliked because of his poor knowledge of the subject matter, not because he was a dick. To this day, my best professor was the one universally feared because of his tyrannical rules. Of which were: "do everything exactly how I say, and you'll get a C", "5min late to class is 5min late to a set (film school), you'd lose your job so you don't get to be in class", and my favorite was towards me "you're wearing sandles?! You can't wear sandles on a set. Go home." - it was a cinematography class, but we were just in the classroom that day. Still had to go home and be counted absent. Oh and we had to attend 2x 5hr Saturday classes to know all the answers to the midterm - the nicknames of all the studio lights and gaff equipment on a set. 

Michael Hoffstein: you're a son of a bitch, but goddamnit if one of my proudest moments wasn't when you saw my final and said: "you're a damn good director... but don't ever try to be a cinematographer. B-".

As a filmmaker, I'm insulted they call this disaster artist one our own. Hell, he gives a bad name to the *actual* disaster artist - least his screned in theaters.  
Terrain Avoidance and Warning Systems (TAWS) are triggered past a certain altitude when the trajectory of the plane is such that it'll hit the ground (or obstacles like mountains) unless the pilot intervenes. After some pretty avoidable crashes, they're mandatory on all commercial and military aircraft. I'm not sure at what point exactly it goes off though. 

Sadly, if competent pilots are actively using the plane and the TAWS goes off, it's more than likely too late to change it. It's mostly meant as a tool to notify a distracted or incompassitated pilot. If you listen to black box recordings, often you can hear that alarm going off in the background even as pilots are failing to correct it. Pretty dark stuff.     
Dear Google:

Then Cumcast and the rest will get their regulated network... with no one on it. 
That's his TAWS going off. In any other plane, that's usually the last sound you hear before you die. Since this is clearly a trained fighter pilot doing maneuvers, he's probably ignoring it. 
This. Blew my mind when I found that out. Thank God they met each other and went the book route. 
Just finished Babylon's Ashes today, The Churn, and Drive over the weekend. Started the series in June. I'm completely obsessed now. I think The Expanse may be one of the great scifi epics. George R R Martin loves it too, and a lot of people say it's SFs answer to A Song of Ice and Fire. 

I listen to them on audible, Jefferson Mayes does an amazing job narrating them. Can't recommend them enough. The SyFy show is about as good as a cable channel could make of it. However I would've liked to see it more fleshed out and tackle darker stuff from a Netflix/HBO platform. Also I'd suggest not watching it until you're done with the books, it kinda blends things from several books, as shows have to do.

Look, I'm just against foreign occupations. The way I see it is the Falkland Islands are an remnant of colonialism. There's no modern value in the land for the UK, so if there's a legal and peaceful option to exchange the land, then London should take it. To an extent, I feel the same way with Northern Ireland, but that's more complex.

Same goes with Guam and Puerto Rico for the US - let them become full states or do what they want. I just don't like seeing people abused and even die because of some shit decided centuries ago he liked hanging out there for holiday. Or even worse, liked their natural resources.    
I... love the idea of this movie. I also love John Candy. I just *really* hate his character in it. I realize you're supposed to, but it's not that. It's the repetitive, and obsurd predictability of him.

OMG time traveling Soviets? I wanna watch that movie.
I did too! My dad used to work on Dobbins NAFB, got to see one up close shortly after they declassified it when I was a kid. Straight up thought it was an alien spaceship.

Halo has taught me that a pistol reigns supreme on the battlefield.
I know this is funny, but aggg F-35 isn't the same class of craft (hence the different first letters). F-35 is a supersonic mutli-roll - CAS, AA, ELW, Recon made in 2000s. A-10 is a subsonic, low flying CAS tank made in the 60s. 

I love, LOVE the A-10, but comparing it to an F-35 is like comparing a pistol to a long range rifle - both have their uses with little cross over. 

Now my ultimate favorite could do circles around both of them, and slag anything that decides to fly in its domain: the F-22 Raptor... Just as long as its working that day haha.

Yeah I drove up Pac Heights and just sat on my car a good hour or so feeling really... strange too. Like all the scenerios of what might have been playing out in my head. Granted, the guy didn't break down or reveal anything, but he definitely was in a "zombie" state (like you guiding the woman) that clearly only would do something if compelled by another human - opened the door and even ordered for him. 
Thanks stranger. I really hope I am. However, I just feel like I did the only thing I could think of at the time. My father raised me to put myself in front of others, but truthfully I often feel I fail to meet that standard.
That is accurate. His destination was the GGB's visitor center, which has a, albeit shitty, taxi/rideshare drop-off lane. 
You can end a trip at any time, for any reason. I just elected to drive him the last ~2 miles for free. 
I mean, I hope it was just all in my mind. A non suicidal person with a free sandwich is better than the potential alternative. Either way, a good sandwich is bound to make anyone perk up.

Just figure if that was really the case he was going through, I'm sure by that point he has heard pretty much everything someone could possibly say to him (or at least expected as such), all I could think to do was just delay a little and at the very least give him something small.

The place was The Sandwich Spot in Marina
Sorry just a colloquialism for ending the trip early, as not to charge him for the change in destination.
