Ford has done this on Lincoln's for 30+ years so I wouldn't be surprised. It actively bothers me when I'm in a car that doesn't do this.
My MKZ also "only" has 265hp but [it's rev happy](https://youtu.be/oUTeUAhue-o) and the AWD makes it way more fun than it should be. It's the fastest car in our driveway, but not the most powerful. The Aviator has 300hp and the Silverado is pushing something above that. Both being larger more utilitarian vehicles they are noticeably slow in comparison though.
Reminds me of /u/doug-demuro's early videos about the Modena detailing a lot of the more annoying aspects of having a bright red Ferrari. The attention would be cool.. for a moment. After a while it would become the equivalent of the "haha, it didn't scan so it's free right??" joke.
Oooo, I really really like that.
Driving through town on the way to work. Doing the speed limit, around 30-35mph. I was coming up behind a line of 3 cars. One sedan, one pickup, and another small sedan in that order. What I didn't notice as I was closing in on them was that the car in the front of the line was stopped and signalling to turn down a road I've never once seen someone turn onto (out of yes, but not into). The pickup completely blocked my view of this.

Now, I don't remember if I saw any brake lights or not. It's possible I didn't notice, it's also possible that the pickup truck being old was a manual and not sitting on the brake and the car being something small and cheap like a Chevy Sonic could have been doing the same thing. All I remember is that right about when I would've had ample braking distance a god damned house fly hit me in the eye. I swatted it away and noticed immediately that the cars weren't moving, I had what looked/felt like 20 feet left and was still going upwards of 30mph. I hit the brakes and at the last second performed the moose test and swerved around them still holding the brakes. I stopped with the grill of my car aligned with their side view mirrors. I'm lucky for a few things: 1, that my car handles very well under full braking, 2 that there was no one parked on the side of the road since it is street parking there, and 3 that nobody happened to be standing there (it's not far from a school, albeit outside of the school zone).

I'm just glad that having driven the 2.2 ton Town Car with it's tiny disc brakes  I got used to quickly deciding whether or not I actually had time to stop or if I had to move around them. I'm also glad for electronic brake force distribution. Afterwards since there were no cars parked in the way I just continued on around the 3 stopped cars. I have no idea if the first car noticed that I almost hit them or if they just thought "Look at this douchebag, can't even wait for traffic for 30 seconds!"
Yup, patent hoarding is a thing. A lot of companies (like Google) tend to buy small startups for instance just to take their patents and go. A more tangible example of this was when Ford sold Aston Martin they kept the rights/patents to the design of the grill. They allow Aston Martin to use the design (it would be rude otherwise) but Ford retains ownership. [That's why we have cars like the Fusion that look so damn similar.](http://www.autotribute.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Aston-Martin-New-Ford-Fusion-Mondeo-3.jpg) 
I'm not finding much about this problem at all. The most I can find is what this website says, "The only real problem we could find that's consistent across all 2gr-Fe's is the idler pulley going bad" which is nothing. https://dustrunnersauto.com/2gr-fe/

Wait really? That's a bit crazy to me. A quick Google and someone said, "I was reading the manual today and it said that "normal" oil consumption can be as high as 1 quart per 600 miles. And do not bother calling the dealer unless it burns more than this amount."

Alright the title *is* crap so I'll explain what I actually mean: Basically a Feral Ghoul "Reaver" is a specific type of Feral Ghoul that appears at higher levels. They have a huge amount of hit points, do tons of damage and have a ranged attack which is that they pull chunks of flesh off them themselves and throw it at you. The projectile isn't actually a solid object until it's thrown so if you happen to kill the ghoul right as they're throwing it the gore becomes solid and they sometimes get stuck to it causing weird physics.

It shares the CD4 platform with the Fusion, MKZ and Taurus so it's possible. But I will say I didn't notice that the CD4 platform is also what the MKX/Nautilus is built on so it's possible the MKZ and Continental will be safe.

Because restarting isn't that necessary really. I mean look, it took 83 days for him to be sick of it. I used to just hibernate my PC for weeks at a time without restarting as well since waiting for Windows to boot from a hard disk is ridiculously slow if you have 4+ startup programs. So Windows 10 just hibernates instead and gets restarted (usually) when it forces updates upon you.

Also FYI the only reason I don't hibernate my PC often anymore is because even in hibernation sometimes the fucking thing turns on in the middle of the night and wakes me up.

It was just to cash in on the truck craze. They tried once with the Blackwood in the early 2000's and canned it. The Mark LT came later around ~~2009~~ 2005 or so when the truck craze started again but was canned after more people bought the Platinum/Titanium Ford's than the LT's and the recession hit. They only produced about 35,000 of them so they're weirdly somewhat rare.
They just want that sweet sweet picnic table.
Alright I'll admit defeat here but legitimate question then: Why would they make it possible to use them in a drill at all? Wouldn't they rather force people to buy a separate tool altogether? 
Did you see the Home Depot link I sent about the same time? They have an entire section on their website of driver drill bits, some even made by Dewalt for their drills.
Or here is also the entire catalog of driver drill bits from Home Depot: https://www.homedepot.com/b/Tools-Power-Tool-Accessories-Drill-Bits-Driving-Bits/N-5yc1vZc267

Dewalt even makes them for their own drills except the light is entirely useless and inconvenient when using them.
> they don't make driver bits specifically for drill.

I put it in a few seconds after I commented but it literally says even in the link itself above "Square head driver drill bit".

Here it is again:  https://www.jakesales.com/Square-Head-Driver-Drill-Bit-2-inch-2-Square-p/2-pack-n2-square-head-driver.htm
I'm talking about driver bits yes and they do make them for drills as well and have for decades.
4 inches long if it's drilling through wood, not drilling a screw into wood. You can also put the bit into the drill farther than just the tip. So that 4 inch bit is now 2.

Edit: These for instance are 2 inches. I have a whole set of bits that are this long and shorter for drills and the screwdrivers you can switch the bits on. https://www.jakesales.com/Square-Head-Driver-Drill-Bit-2-inch-2-Square-p/2-pack-n2-square-head-driver.htm
> either a bit driver or a drill bit that's already sunken, 

Have you never used a drill? They can be used to you know, screw things in with different drill bits that stick out maybe at most an inch from the drill itself like in the photo above. It's an extremely common use for a drill that was completely overlooked in the design of this product. There should not be a light there and there doesn't need to be one. It's nothing but an inconvenience and Hotrod reasonably thinks that someone at Dewalt would stop and think "This is crap, we should take the light off. Saves money *and* makes the drill more useful."
What I mean is that they took an alfalfa cube, carved it out and then just covered it in glue. They didn't make a cube of grass and glue they just used one that's already made. If you've ever handled an alfalfa cube you'd see just how solid they are.
Looks like they just carved out an alfalfa cube to me which is less impressive since it's pre-made: https://www.pestellminerals.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/feed-ingredients-alfalfa-cubes-16-percent.jpg

It doesn't reflect anywhere near as easily as glass so it's easier to see the dash in any lighting conditions. At night for instance even the dash lights themselves would reflect off the glass in front of it. Another reason is probably safety. In the event of a crash if your air bag deploys it would probably shatter the glass so close to it that it could pose more of a threat having shattered glass in the cabin. And in the end it is also cheaper than trying to fit a piece of glass there since 1: you'd probably want it curved like a lot of the current plastic ones are and 2 for safety you'd want it to be laminated like the windshield which would definitely up the price. It would also have to be laminated and secured in a way that would prevent it from cracking due to sudden temperature changes or even just from a rough road (hell I've seen rear view mirrors crack from cold winters). Since the entire point would be to make it scratchless you'f also have to use a very hard and therefore brittle glass. Smartphone gorilla glass isn't that hard to scratch realistically. Any kind of mineral/rock will do it which is why most people keep a screen protector on them. It is possible to make them way more scratch resistant by making the glass literally harder but then it's much more prone to shattering from slight hits.

Well, you're in some serious shit. http://www.illinoistrafficlaws.us/2012/05/31/speeding-40-mph-over-the-limit-in-illinois-class-a-misdemeanor/

Just some excerpts from that site: 

Speeding 40 mph over the limit, years ago, was called aggravated speeding. If the name of an offense gives a sense of how serious it is, consider that most crimes that are described as “aggravated” are felonies (eg, aggravated battery).

The minimum penalty for speeding this fast is conviction. A conviction is a permanent record, and it can be disseminated nationwide.

Speeding 40 miles an hour over the limit is a Class A misdemeanor. Other Class A misdemeanors include domestic battery, resisting arrest, and driving under the influence. Even though it is just a speeding ticket, it is treated the same as these crimes.

The maximum fine is up to $2500.

A conviction may cause the Secretary of State to suspend, and on rare occasions, even revoke driving privileges the offender.

It is common for motorists to go to traffic court and express their surprise when the judge tells them they have to hire a lawyer. It is not just common. It is a daily occurrence. The reason that courts want the defendant to be represented by counsel is courts want to preserve the right to sentence the offender to jail.
> consisting of two or more inspection lanes may accept prescheduled appointments for the safety inspection of a motor vehicle

Two or more "inspection lanes". Not bays. There's nothing to say that the other bays of the garage you went to were set up to inspect a vehicle. In NH for instance it has to be done a specific way by specific equipment, they may only have it for one car at a time.

>Stations that take in vehicles for inspection at the beginning of the work day shall not be required to stop inspecting those vehicles to provide an inspection for a drive-in request

So he told you you had to wait per the law? If they have one inspection bay and someone was already there then it is not unreasonable to expect a two hour wait. Even the state of Virginia recognizes this: 

>Stations may suggest to motorists a timeframe of no greater than three hours

No greater than also means up to. As in he could have said you have to wait 3 hours and it's fine and legal.

If you need *any* kind of vehicle service and are extremely impatient then you are free to call and make an appointment. It's not the shops fault if you're unprepared.

I have a OnePlus X that I've had since February of 2016. Why haven't I changed? Well, money. I bought it originally because it was $200 and that's a lot of money when you're poor and in debt.

But I'll admit I've also felt no reason to get a new one. With Android 7 and different kernel settings it works great. It's smooth, it's quick to load apps (the camera comes up almost instantly so I don't actually miss anything like with the shitty Moto G3 I had) and the battery still tends to last all day with 3+ hours of SOT. It's got a screen protector that put on day 1 and the shitty rubber case that it came with. It's been dropped, used in the rain and thrown around and it's fine, no cracks and no obvious scratches.

Also it still manages to get pretty decent pictures by complete accident: https://i.imgur.com/GGKOW4Z.jpg

It started banging like crazy yesterday though so I think it's done for. It did stop after a couple minutes of limping home though weirdly enough... anyways I have one of those sketchy aftermarket warranties that *should* cover it, and the local dealer is willing to work with them.

>  My driving instructor told me that when you make a decision, you have to commit and you can't debate in your head

He's talking about a situation like making a turn onto a road as a car is coming, not parking at all. In the former situation people sometimes panic "oh no, that car is actually going really fast, I'm not going to make it in time!" so they jam on the brakes and end up being hit because they're now stopped in front of a moving vehicle. If you're going to go, GO. Be predictable so that other drivers can guess what you're about to do. 

But in this case you're parking, just park. Take 20 minutes to do it if you have to to get it right.
I get this. My car seems to cut fuel in first when you let off the gas so it slows down quick. It's extremely obnoxious in slow moving stop and go traffic (like outside a school).
When I do this in my automatic car if someone's behind me I just lightly put my foot on the brake. Not enough to even begin stopping, just enough to let the brake light switch out.

Sorry I was sitting on hold for 3 hours at that point and must have missed it. Still, I've never been in a car that hasn't had a working clock.

Does your car not have a working clock? I couldn't even tell you if Google Maps hides the clock on Android since I just look at my cars instead.
I mean... add a snowblower motor that's always running the alternator and A/C compressor so that the engine can shut down at stop lights and then use the snowblower motor as the starter (kind of like how the Prius uses the electric motor to turn over) for a more seemless take off?
And with 90% less weight than a car haha.
To be fair on /r/Android if you want to be attacked just say you dislike the almighty Samsung. 
On most cars it is just a head unit that drives all the speakers as one unit. The panther bodies just had a weird setup where the head unit was basically just a remote for the radio in the trunk. The Town Car's also had a 6" subwoofer that is incompatible with any aftermarket head unit since it uses a weird Ford proprietary connection.
To be fair if I remember correctly a friend of Danny Elfman dared him that he wouldn't do it and he said, "Haha, watch this." The song is a joke.
Wait is this from something recent? Cause that was a Family Guy joke like, 4 years ago.
That's.... that's broken. It doesn't need to be broken "enough" for them to replace under warranty. Go back and demand or try a different dealer. Or call Ford.

I've got a 95 Town Car, all stock original speakers. It sounds alright to be honest, it's Ford's "Premium Sound" from back in the day. Even after all these years it doesn't rattle and has okay sound. The system is 85 watts total if I remember right. Luckily most of the bass frequencies are filtered to the rear deck 6x9's so it does alright in that department, it's just not great in the upper range anymore.

/u/njrajio you'll want to read this: On my car the stereo and it's amplifier are one unit in the trunk of the car to the right of the spare tire up against the back seats. The antenna *and* rear defroster are routed through the amplifier so wiring an aftermarket radio gets tricky.
First time I saw one in person it was an overcast day after a rain. The MKT was black with blacked out windows. The whole thing had this feeling of death and despair surrounding it. It was kinda cool.
Just got hit this morning by a massive chunk of snow/ice coming off another going the other way on Route 10. Luckily no damage but damn it made me mad.
Volkswagen basically ripped off the design of the Beetle from a car in Czechoslovakia called the [Tatra 570.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/Tatra_570.JPG/1024px-Tatra_570.JPG) When Tatra saw the success of the Beetle in Germany and how closely it resembled their own car they sued Volkswagen and the German government. So what's a country to do when it's being sued by a relatively small company far away? You invade their country and take over the factory of course!
Oh interesting, they're going turbo now which makes sense. Although it's confusing because I'm seeing articles that are literally titled "Honda does away with VTEC!" followed by "Honda has unveiled the 2017 Honda Civic Turbo VTEC"
As soon as you said "I shut my laptop" I knew where this was going. I got into the habit of muting every computer I have before bed (mainly because my desktop likes to come out of hibernation sometimes and will start auto playing youtube and wake me up)
The Civic is one of mine as well. It's always come across as either a teenagers car or an old ladies car and I just don't give two craps about VTEC. Oh your car halves its power most of the time? That's cool but I prefer as much torque through the rev range as possible.

Have you ever slammed on the brakes in a midsized pickup truck before? Even at 30mph it's a bouncy almost frightening experience. I can imagine from *95* that it's way more exciting.
That's literally the point of SUV's. Every time a company makes a somewhat nimble one the general consensus is: Uncomfortable because of the sporty suspension and can't take turns worth a damn still because it's a bloody SUV. Acceleration is meh because it weighs 3 tons because it's a bloody SUV.

Do you hate semi's too because they don't drive like a 911? C'mon man.
Seriously. I had to clean off my damn car before work. I'm sick of this white bullshit :(

I think it was Gen 4 Hughes net, I can't remember honestly. It's really just a limitation of satellite technology as a whole. Here's people talking about how at best you'll get about 650ms ping (which is downright terrible) from only last year: https://community.hughesnet.com/t5/Tech-Support/Echostar-19-and-ping/td-p/49021
Can Android P also be the first version of Android to not immediately try connecting to devices when bluetooth is turned on?
They did as well and it's actually hurt Genesis sales a lot. At least they're reasoning is that Hyundai would like their own luxury brand like how Lincoln is to Ford, Cadillac to GM, Infiniti to Nissan, etc. But in the FCA lineup it doesn't make sense to separate Ram pickups from the rest of Dodge since it's known as the iconic Dodge Ram.

You might struggle with any kind of video conferencing on it to be honest. I don't have it but most if not all satellite internet providers have really small data caps like a cell phone carrier. They also tend to have a very high ping so everything will be delayed noticeably.

> thing is the car won't wait until the battery is completely dead before charging it 

Iirc it can't. The Prius doesn't have a starter motor, it uses the electric motor that normally drives the car to start the engine. So if the hybrid batteries die it can't use the normal car battery (which they do have) to start the car.
I could like the car if I just didn't despise how it looks. Every generation is absolutely hideous to me and the interiors got worse with every update. If it looked like a normal car inside and out I'd have no issue with it.
The worst part about the Fusion is that it's sold in Australia as the Falcon which actually was a fairly iconic name in the States. I don't know why we got Fusion instead.
That's one thing Lincoln did away with when they started naming everything MK(letter). No more trim levels, just the car. The only downside is that every website ever has my car listed as "BASE MODEL".
> I freaking hate Ram pickups.

I still don't know what a Laramie is but can we talk about how confusing it is still that the Dodge Ram is now just a Ram? Why?? Did anyone actually notice the change? Why is Ram its own brand now? The Ram is iconic to *Dodge*. Can you imagine if Ford said the Mustang is no longer a Ford? It's just a Mustang. Ford's not involved. Ignore the fact that every piece on the interior says FoMoCo.
>into the cruise

There's another. Give me my internet point please.
There's 2 versions of the 3 cylinder ecoboost. One is garbage and puts out 100 horsepower (slightly less than the Cruze's base model engine) and the other puts out 197hp which is more than the Turbocharged Cruze with one less cylinder.
>  the upgraded suspension made huge difference in the way it drove.

I should hope. My sister had a base 2013 Cruze and the ride was absolutely terrible. 
My sister got a base model manual 2013 Cruze brand new for around $20k. Awful car for the price.

Toyota seems to love solid suspension and rock hard seats.
One of my favorite artists started this way actually.
Nah, let that shit stay in your history.
The MKZ wasn't even on my radar until I discovered they actually had everything I wanted when optioned out haha. Check your transmission cooler lines by the way, mine were rusted and gave way at 130k miles. Everything else is spotless, those weren't apparently.
I like the US Army one because it mainly just details how a simple torque converter works. I've seen other videos that try and go in depth about how modern ones work and that's fine, but if you just want to understand the basic principles this video is easier.
Going back and playing FO2, 3 and NV really made me realize just how bland and boring FO4 is.
I honestly can't even tel it's a facelift. There's so little different with it.
Real talk I think the reason it looks that way is that the only other fandom that draws just as much is anime which is supposed to be a "cheap" style of animation (or was originally).

>"estimates placed the actual output was close to 600 hp"
Light taps yeah, hitting it hard like he's saying can just finish off killing the starter. Use a 2 by 4 if you've got one. Also from a quick look around it seems like the easiest way to get to it may be from underneath the car. Some cars are like that.
IANAM but it sounds like the heads of cylinders 2 and 3 were cracked from the get-go. The misfiring was coolant getting into the cylinders and pressure escaping as well. I don't think you could get them to do anything about it but you can try. When talking to them don't say you put water in it, say you put coolant in. Their excuse would be that the water boiled off.
>I just want to signal to people that the vehicle is locked in parking lots 

I'm curious as to why? If someone were going to try and break into it they'd just pull the handle anyways since more than likely they A) wouldn't know it was your car that beeped and B) probably weren't around to hear it anyways. If they really want something from your car they'll just smash their way in regardless. The beep is to let *you* know the car is locked and to find it in the parking lot.

And as someone else said the beep is a feature of the car, not the fob. Programming a third spare fob will let it behave exactly the same as the other ones.

Lastly, don't worry so much. Just keep valuables like phones, laptops and money out of sight.
Nah, let's just make a weird ski slope that's too steep to rest your arms on, move the cup holders even further back out of the drivers reach and leave a huge gap under the center console where nothing can be stored. Also while we're at it, buttons for selecting gears is too costly, let's integrate them into the infotainment! Ahhhhh modern design~
I knew you had a Toyota without even looking at your flair. My only problem with the Toyota shifter is that you can too easily put the car in 3rd when going for drive and passengers can bump it into third as well. It doesn't hurt anything, it just takes a minute to notice that the car is being sluggish as all hell.
Ford did as well, the Edsel had buttons for shifting as an example. They called it [teletouch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletouch).

My manager drives a Focus and called my car a land barge once. At first I thought she had forgotten that I had bought my current car and she was referring to my Town Car which is literally 2.3 feet longer than the MKZ (and the CTS-V). I'm starting to wonder if that's where we're at now.
Aside from the tail lights it always kind of looked like a bigger Cruze.
RCR on the 2014 Malibu applies here: "This is a car... it's fine."

On another note it looks identical to the 2018. This is a refresh to general motors now?
You should be able to pull back any of the trunk/cargo area carpet lining by the tail light. On every car the light housing is usually just held in by a few bolts/screws, remove them and the light should come off. Here's a video but it doesn't look super informative honestly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5Icf-lBVxQ

The US army did a good video on how it works way back in the 50's as well. This is where I first learned how it works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm8EHTTNPEg
Is a sub-16 foot car really a land barge now?
I've got an idea for you if your Odyssey has similar seats. The key fob has a button to open the rear hatch right? Keep the spare fob with a fresh battery in the space where the seats fold into. Just tape it in place down there so if it were to ever happen to your kids, they could reach down and open the hatch.
Ohhhhh! That's a good visual. I won't be surprised if they at least put an emergency release in the floor there for the back hatch. The government only requires them if it's classified as a trunk but there's no reason a minivan shouldn't have one as well.
Depending on how he was pinned he could've been stuck using muscles that aren't really worked. I got pinned under my dirtbike once as a teenager and couldn't get out from under it. The back wheel slid out and I fell off the bike forward, the bike landed in a way that one leg was under the middle of it and the other foot was stuck between the back tire and fender. I reached back and hit the kill switch but in that position I had no muscle power to move the bike off of me, my arms weren't strong enough outstretched like that and I didn't have the leg strength to lift the bike up. It's not like I didn't have the overall body strength to lift the bike up, just not the individual muscle strength at an awkward angle.
Even old automatics aren't this stupid either, they won't shift into reverse at speed. The worst you'll get is it'll coast down to maybe 5 to 10mph and then shift into reverse.
Luckily if you've got the parts and find a local mechanic it'll probably be around 50 bucks. Could be way worse.
And that's where I draw the line, there's no way this is serious at all. 
To be fair that call really could've been accidental. I've hit it so many times on accident just because I was trying to choose a different chat and missed. Even if you hit END immediately it says that they missed your call.
That's a fantastic way to reheat a sub if you don't want soggy bread from the microwave or toasted bread from the oven. 10/10

When I got them replaced on my old car they had to blow torch the fuckers off. 
It wasn't specific to the Mustangs but a lot of Ford's from that time period were recalled because the cruise control switch could short and cause a fire under the hood and burn the whole thing down. It could happen while driving or just parked overnight: https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/08/ford_massive_recall.html
I would start it up with the hood open and listen closely to see if you can pinpoint where the noise is coming from. If it is the fan knocking something I'd be worried about what it's knocking so it's hard to say.
That fan yeah. There should also be one or two electric fans in front of the radiator but could be difficult to see (on a silverado they're blacked out so it's literally difficult to see them) If you can't see all the blades on the big fan see if you can spin it around and check it out. I don't think it should be moving back and forth at all either so I wonder if it's loose, out of balance and touching something.
I told a coworker "I'd rather eat a bullet but sure" when she asked if I could come in early for a day next week. She thought it was a bit "severe" lmao
Re-reading your post I thought of something, have you checked the radiator fans? I know on my 95 Town Car even in the winter time when you first start the car all of the fans, electric and mechanical will be active for the first few minutes of running. I wonder if the mechanical fan is knocking on something? When you move the steering wheel the RPM's will pick up to compensate for the power steering pump so it would make the fan speed up as well.
Get it done. A common theme with BMW's and other German cars is that they're built to very close tolerances. In other words, if something is even slightly off or wrong it will behave like it's dying (and might actually die). Winter or no, do oil changes on time. It'll hate you otherwise. There's not a lot of room for error with these cars.
>I'm seeing a lot of sentiment where anyone who puts an LED bulb in a reflector housing headlight is an automatic douchebag

This is all I've gotten. The LED bulbs I have are emitting light around the bulb the same as a halogen and the reflector housing has an anti-glare cap that covers the top of the bulb. It's not blinding anybody, it's aimed properly, and the key is that I didn't need to re-wire the car to get the halogens to be at full brightness.

But no, fuck me because I dared to be able to see while driving at night. I'm either better off driving with lights dimmer than a $1 gas station flashlight or not driving at night at all and not having a job.
I think I've read before that you can ask a dealer to disable it. I remember seeing people say it was annoying on bimmers since it also chimes and if you're in a climate where it's changing above and below freezing as you're driving it gets extremely annoying.
My manager had a Versa SL hatch with the torque converter automatic. That thing is pathetically slow and definitely struggles to get up to speed on the interstate... or 50mph back roads... or out of the driveway..

I swear my cars idle faster off the line than that thing can at full chat.
To me the fifth looks like a really rushed design. Like, "Shit, the Mustang is selling really well with its retro look! Johnson, hand me that toy car, we need to make it full size!" 

The sixth looks like after they had pushed out the fifth they had time to relax without upper management breathing down their necks and actually attempt to design the Camaro.
You've checked the oil level yeah? 
As someone who watches a lot of Urbex videos I can tell you what most of them do: If they can't find a way into an abandoned building or property without breaking something, then they won't go in as this is "Breaking and entering" whereas walking into an unlocked or open building is just trespassing, a much smaller fine if caught.
"Gee that truck is signalling to move over, I better put myself right in its blind spot!"

Last Camaro I liked was the IROC-Z. The rest have been.. eh. The catfish was ugly for obvious reasons, the transformers one looks like a toy that was trying very hard to capitalize on the fifth generation Mustang's success and the latest one is trying to be too edgy.
I wonder if that gate is designed to stop the more common smaller cars in Europe. Less than 2 liters isn't uncommon at all over there.

All they did was round out the old design which was an awful thing to do. These things were always compared to the Town Cars but look at the late 90's generation of those, it's no wonder it won out. http://en.lincoln-club.com/graphics/gallery/full/205_ltc-signature-1998-2002.jpg
*Malaise era*
Oh yeah, that one. I always thought they looked like squashed Prius's.
> The new Eclipse is a new vehicle with an old name of a retired car

Which I don't get from a marketing perspective. Usually you reuse a name like that because it elicits a good feeling from happy memories. "Introducing the 2019 Chevrolet Chevelle!" might make people happy because even if the car isn't or wasn't special it'll invoke nostalgia for the new version and the brand. The Eclipse was loved by people for what it was, a snappy little sports car. So to use the name Eclipse for a crossover is just going to piss those people off and they'll hate it by instinct.

So you're saying now that Mitsubishi doesn't care about the enthusiasts that loved it before, and that's true and fine. But the people who aren't enthusiasts didn't buy the original Eclipse: **That's why they stopped making it in the first place. Non-enthusiasts hated the car.** So the only feelings you'll invoke are "Hey, I remember the Eclipse, I looked at them and thought it was a useless car so I bought an Accord instead."

So let's bring back a car that the average person didn't want and make it something that the not so average person won't buy!
Heavy, uncomfortable, ugly, had weird design choices like how the hard top is made from aluminum to cut down on weight whereas the interior is filled with "maple wood". I want to say it was also just horrendously boring to drive. Meanwhile the same company makes the LFA and it's obvious they know what they're doing but the SC seemed to really drop the ball in all categories. It's an all-rounder car that's not good at anything basically.
Oh yeah, I forgot about that. Looks better to me than the production models.
Find the starter, should be on the back of the engine block above the transmission, and give it a few good knocks with a 2 by 4. Turn the key, if it doesn't start hit it again. At least that's the classic way to get a starter to engage.

Could also be one of the underhood fuses or relays as well.
"The invite is invalid or expired" fyi.
It would be the funniest thing I've heard all month if they added the telescopic steering wheel but made the seat fixed.
Maybe someone has a better answer but honestly I'm not finding good things. I've read about this transmission before since my mother has an Aviator that has it as well. It's pretty infamous for being an unreliable piece of garbage across all vehicles it's in. Basically no one has a definitive answer for the common failures of the 5R transmissions but some people agree that in your specific scenario that the "overdrive sprag" has gone bad. In Drive and reverse it uses the overdrive sprag for gear engagement. It works in manual 1 and 2 because it's using the coast clutch instead of the overdrive sprag. Overdrive however should still work since it uses the overdrive band and not the sprag. So theoretically it can be shifted from 2/3 to drive once you're moving. 

I couldn't tell you if that'll be cheap or not since it looks like they'll need to open up the tranny and disassemble it.
If you're driving, up past 35mph or so can you put it in Drive?
So you can put it into 1 and 2, but not 3 or drive? Park works?
I also normally just complain! I've always been an extremely cynical person so maybe that's why I've been so happy with the service I've gotten at this dealer.
This is something a local mechanic should be able to diagnose in 10 minutes honestly for basically no money. I brought two cars to my local guy and he just poked around with one of those electric probes which let him force the compressor to turn on. On one car it was just a wiring fault in the climate control, the compressor turned on and ran fine when given power. On the other the compressor crunched and grinded when it turned on.
Do you have PRND321? Or is it PRNDL?
Fair point, I'm half expecting the dealer posts to be banned before too long. Figured I'd drop a nice one before that happens.
Mainly I'm just saying that people here keep posting that "Oh I drove up in a Civic and they treated me like dirt". So I'm countering with "I've been driving up with a decade old cheaper car and they're treating me respectfully".
At my last job a coworker quit because his paycheck was just paying for day care. His wife made more than him so it made more sense for him to just stay home and raise their kid instead of paying someone else to do it.

Nah. With the distant land mod you get the same effect as Skyrim and Oblivion. And since Morrowind is larger than both of those the sense of it being a massive world isn't lost at all. 
Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad game by any means. I did play it and finish it but I really only did to finish Ezio's story arc. 
There's a mod out there that removes a lot of the distance fog (since it's not actually part of the lore, it was just a limitation of the console and PC's at the time) and it makes navigating a hell of a lot easier. "You'll see a fort on the hill" except I won't because the fog ends 30 feet in front of me, not 200 feet up a hill damn you!

> But if I moved closer to fix that issue then I was too close to the wheel.

This is the problem I have with my grandmothers Rav4. I'm either uncomfortably close to the pedals so it hurts my ankles (especially when braking since the Toyota brake pedal just HAS to stick out much farther than the gas pedal) but stretches my arms out because the wheel is so far away or I'm so close to the pedals that I can't reasonably drive and my arms are mildly uncomfortable. I learned later that even a base 2007 Rav4 has a telescopic steering wheel and felt like an idiot.... until I had to drive it again. It's extended all the way, you can push it even *further* away from you.

This was the first thing I noticed in the picture on that site. The head restraints are way too far forward.
Definitely, but the wazer wifle is easier to get earlier in the game. Don't even need to pay him if you've got the Child At Heart perk :D

Not just you, I know a lot of people love the way the Challenger looks. 
> 1998 to one that came out in 2005

All Sebrings have the battery in the wheel well. All the way up to 2010. [Here's a video showing how to remove the wheel and get to it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4cCGYawKVc) By 2010 the Sebring wasn't even on the same platform it started with and used different engines. It was a different car and they kept the same garbage placement.
The style just doesn't sit right with me. I think a lot of it's the headlights but some of it I can say is that the cars are very blobby. They have that late 90's "melted bar of soap" look to them that I've never liked. [Just like the old Ford Taurus.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/05-07_Ford_Taurus_SE_sedan.jpg/1200px-05-07_Ford_Taurus_SE_sedan.jpg) Another thing I've noticed is that I'm not a huge fan of cars that don't have many side profile details? Take the Challenger for instance, there's just nothing to look at on the sides of the car, there's nothing there.[ No real styling cues or eye catching lines.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/2012_Dodge_Challenger_SRT_392_%2812606344774%29.jpg/1200px-2012_Dodge_Challenger_SRT_392_%2812606344774%29.jpg)

I honestly can't stand those, not that generation. I don't even know why, the style just bugs me.
They're not selling a crate motor, they're selling a car that anybody can buy. 
> Some other applications still use tubes tho.

Mainly dirt bikes and applications where the tire might hit hard objects. A tubeless tire can "pop" from hitting a curb because you break the seal whereas the tube is safe from the impact.
>  you see pennies being taken out everywhere to save thousands per vehicle

True but this was also on one of GM's cheapest vehicles.
True, but you can't download or install apps so you're stuck with the basic Android calculator.
It's got a parking brake yeah? Does it work?
[One could argue the GM EV1 was a cancelled production car.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_EV1) They made 1100 of them, leased a bunch, and then took them all back and crushed them. Since they didn't ever sell them, just leased them, no one could really stop them from doing so. I think there's only a couple still in existence.
>  Yes, there are people out there who will actually defend the battery placement in those cars.

Who in there right mind would defend that? There's nothing about it to defend, it's just bad design haha. You can't even argue that it's to save space when even a Chevy Cobalt has the battery in the trunk.
This is a valid concern. I'm going to hope that OP here is going to hire a manager and let them run the business. Otherwise the idea of going to a shop and them not knowing anything about the most ***fundamental and basic service of any vehicle going back a full fucking century*** is absolutely terrifying.
Unless you get the fantastic Car Max warranty then don't touch any used Range Rover. If there was ever a car that was designed for rich people with multiple vehicles who only buy new, it's the Range Rover.

> air suspensions need to be put in to some sort of service mode when put on a lift.

Usually it needs to be shut off. In my Town Car there's a switch in the trunk that you flip or else it can mess up the systems perception of when the car is level so it may do weird things like overfilling the bags. Also turn it off to keep it from randomly turning on the compressor when somebody has their hand in it.
Plus depending on the vehicle it's not that expensive. My Town Car has rear air suspension for instance. The air bags last for about 7 years before they start to leak (they don't just fail entirely, they just stop holding air as easily). Each bag costs anywhere from $60 to $120. If you replace them both at the same time it's around $300 to $400 parts and labor *in seven years*. It's not that terrible and it rides like a damn cloud.
Same reason the "corporate grill" exists. It makes the brand recognizable from a quick glance. The average person doesn't seem to really care about what model a car is, just what brand it is. So the hope is someone will say, see Cadillacs everywhere (even though they're all different shapes and sizes) and will go their local Cadillac dealer. Now the dealer doesn't have to work as hard because the customer saw one sedan that looked good but they want an SUV because they all just look like Cadillacs. 
The old Leaf to me is the pinnacle of Nissan's horrible design language of the time. They're getting better looking with this last generation but man between 2003 and 2013 Nissan's were.... blobby.
>  It's the dumbest looking car on the road today as far I am concerned

I'm glad you agree. I'm sure it's a fine car but man are they weird looking.
> Enthusiasm for cars, regardless of what it is.

That's always what I thought but sometimes that's just not what happens.

My coworker has an e46. What he did instead was make new regulators out of zip ties because he got sick of buying news. So far the zip ties have outlasted the actual regulators.
Which year? Looks like his S2000 should be about 5.4 seconds to 60 and the 2017 MDX is 5.7. Every other year is 6 and up though.
My Town Car's got those cupholders that come out of the dashboard and they're terrible. There's not a can, bottle or cup on this planet that will stay in them if you're not on the interstate. My MKZ though has really deep cupholders. They're as deep as a normal can of soda is tall so everything stays put. It's nice. But I feel your pain. "We're turning, hold the drinks!"
Yeah these are the same people that put a battery in the wheel well, I'm not surprised.
Which I'm glad for since the only reason I switched is that I couldn't view pictures in the actual Twitter app without it locking up. If the official app wasn't unstable garbage I would use it.

Then how do you expect them to enforce the law and hopefully prevent speeders? They can't just magically appear behind you, they have to go a little *faster than you* to catch up. 
Well yeah, he was speeding. I don't understand how reddit thinks cops can pull people over without speeding. 
Doesn't appear to be going that much faster than the rest of the traffic and pulled into the lane a few car lengths ahead of the only other car he passed. There's nothing unsafe about what he did.

I'm struggling to find a picture since I don't know the name of it but they make pickups similar to this that have a cage over the cab (like the picture above but made of metal) for carrying specific things like wheat bundles or hay. I'm thinking it's a homemade version of that.
What makes me feel old is knowing that OP here was more than likely born after the Millennium.
Being a somewhat large pickup truck you'd think a Silverado 1500 would be really accessible but with the 5.3 the last two cylinders are just crammed under the cowl behind the firewall. The sparkplugs are a pain in the ass to replace if they've fused themselves into the engine.

Edit: I'm not joking by the way. If it's not there ask for a discount because you're missing a nice feature of the car.
Things in the cabin have started to rattle and it's driving me insane. It would be fine if I could get the car to stop vibrating at 30mph though. It's quiet for the most part on the highway but anything below 40 and things won't shut the fuck up. It was quiet in the summer time so I'm hoping that once it warms up and the panels can expand it will settle and be quiet again.
I still don't understand why this is a problem.
> Not unpopular in the real world.

>Most products in stores now are "frozen dairy treat" or just "Frozen desert treat"

When it's not true. It's usually brought up specifically about Breyer's Ice Cream on Reddit that they sell their ice cream as "frozen dairy dessert" when you can see for yourself in the store that all of it's labeled "All natural ice cream!". The only time I see it written otherwise are on ice cream like products like Gelato which are still ice cream in their own right but are marketed differently in the States.


You know, I keep hearing this on Reddit, especially in reference to Breyer's ice cream. How it says "frozen dairy dessert" because it's not really ice cream. Just go to your store and see, they all say ice cream. Not one brand says it's a dairy dessert, they're ALL ice cream. If you see "Breyer's frozen dairy dessert" then you're seeing one of the other hundreds of products they and these companies make that are literally just not ice cream. It's like saying Ford only makes pickups because you only saw F-150's when driving by the lot.

Regulations don't allow "exposed headlamps" on cars which is why we even have lenses to begin with.

Fair point. I've never been to the Chevy dealer so they could be total garbage, and my experience with this Ford dealer has been downright fantastic.
Alright I think I'll give you that. After digging around some a lot of articles state that it's the F150 specifically but other sites list it as the F-series as a whole.

Edit: Not sure why I'm downvoted for something you can just Google for yourself and see. Half of the articles state the F150 is the best selling vehicle in the US and the other have say that the F Series is the best selling vehicle in the US. 
I see you're also a man of culture.

NV and FO3 are very stable for me on the PC, but on the PS3 they were both nearly unplayable messes. NV would occasionally lock up the entire system so that I'd have to physically hold the power button to shut it off. I love the games, but not on consoles.
More than the Fusion? That's... really odd. As far as I know most of the safety features of the MKZ were on the Fusion as well. And in 2008 they offered ESC on the Z but not on the 07 model year so I'd assume the 08 would be less likely to be in an accident.

Edit: It's also double the horsepower of the Fusion but still, that seems odd.
I didn't learn how to back into a parking spot for the first two years that I drove. It's just not something that's ever been necessary, and neither has parallel parking been.

> But doesn't gm combined sell more trucks than Ford?

F-150 has been the best selling *vehicle*, not even the best selling truck, in the US for decades now. It's weird. But more to answer your question: That's not including the F-250, 350, 450, 550, 650 which also sell decently well. I want to say the F-250 hovers around the 3rd most sold vehicle most years?
Anytime the wheels are detected as "slipping" it could activate. A failing wheel speed sensor (one could have a loose connection for instance, they're just plugged in) could be telling the ECU periodically that the wheel is moving slower than the others or not at all which will trigger ABS or TCS. If it's just triggering the ABS then it will only do something about it when you step on the brakes.
My "boring sedan" was more powerful than the 4.6 Mustang GT's so there's that.

Edit: [This thread.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KquFZYi6L0)
TCS will usually light if it's engaging but I've never seen an ABS light come on unless the system recognizes a failure and shuts itself off entirely. You could try pulling the fuses for both and seeing if the problem goes away. When my mother's car had a failing wheel speed sensor the ABS would activate randomly when braking.
I feel like this would be useful if you were traveling long distance for work for a few months and wanted a nice car while you were there but didn't want to either drive your own (like going from NH to CA) or rent one for so long. Renting could get really expensive.
Could be the ABS going a bit apeshit or if it has Traction Control that could having an issue as well.
My car's nowhere on those lists. Probably for two reasons: Aside from the takata airbag lurking in the dashboard it's fairly safe, and nobody drives them so the numbers are low.

Interesting fact though: The 2007 MKZ was the first car with side curtain airbags designed to unfold down the window glass in order to protect occupants who may be resting or sleeping with their on the window by pushing its way between them and the glass.
In the Torque app you need to go into the settings, one of the options is something like "Manage extra Sensors/PID's", tap the triple dot menu in the corner and add the ones for Volvo. I have to do it for Ford as well or else it can't see most of the sensors that are Ford specific.

Edit: Just checked and there's no Volvo specific set. Nevermind.
You know, I remember this coming up once in another thread on here and I'll say this again: Auto-unlocking when the car is put in park is really dumb and unsafe. On my MKZ and Town Car (which is 23 years old) the doors only unlock when you pull the drivers side handle after parking. You can disable this feature and still be able to exit the front doors of the car by just pulling the handle since pulling the handle manually unlocks the door simultaneously. It's not unsafe because it doesn't unlock when you stop and is still hella convenient. Unless Ford can sue other car companies for doing this then other car companies are just being stupid.
You've got key, probably has buttons on it. Press buttons til car is found. Congrats, u found car.

I don't fault them for making a crossover but they didn't need to use the name from a completely different vehicle. Especially if the name was from a car that didn't even sell. Anyone who liked the Eclipse is insulted that it's a crossover and the people that didn't want to own one in the first place will remember the name as a car they didn't want. It's bad marketing but I guess that's what you get when you want a Mitsubishi Motors.

For the record from what I can tell the 2011 Accent is drive-by-cable meaning there's a physical cable running from your gas pedal to the throttle body. Cruise control for drive by cable is so god damn complicated it's not worth trying. The people who tend to just swap in parts to get cruise control do so on things like the Chevy Sonic where the only thing preventing you from having cruise control is not having the buttons on the steering wheel. The equipment is there you just can't activate it. Your car is missing the entirety of a system that relies on physically pulling on cables and using sensor data it won't be able to get.
I wouldn't even call it a brand, it's just a trim level of GMC's. Ford sells a buttload of Platinum and Titanium vehicles too.

The biggest problem with traffic lights are the drivers to be fair, not so much the light placement. In this situation for instance usually every light facing you is red so it's hard to mess it up and assume you can go. But more importantly too many people try to "beat the light" and fly through yellow lights which is probably what happened in the video. Light was yellow, the guy floored it, light turned red probably 30 feet before he entered the intersection which gave opposing traffic time to start going. At this point the guy is going way too fast to stop and bam.
I'm back to FO3 myself. I do enjoy playing FO4 but for the love of god everything in that game is a disappointment it seems. The final straw was when I finally got the lever action rifle in Far Harbor. I was so happy because I *love* the lever action in NV. It was just a satisfying weapon. I enjoyed it in FO4 too, for a few minutes. The gunfire itself isn't very satisfying, it's not the same cracking sound as NV but whatever. The problem is the reload animation. It's too quick so it looks odd but more importantly it's just a single animation. Fired 1 shot out of 5? Well you reload 5 bullets. Fire 3 out of 5? Reload 5 bullets. It's fucking lazy. In NV it reloads the correct amount of bullets and you can also interrupt reloading to fire off a round if you're desperate. You can't in 4.

But literally everything is like that in 4. Everything is a mild disappointment. So I'm going to spend another 1000 hours in FO3 probably before moving right on back to the Mojave to live out the rest of my days.

Edit: Also FO3 and NV are way more gritty than 4. FO4 feels so damn *happy* in comparison, I guess to pull in a larger audience. Playing a good chunk of Fallout 2 made me notice that when I lost an arm wrestling competition and got raped by a super mutant named Frank. I woke up with a ballgag in my inventory. I put it in the dresser but I took the sex doll that I found in there. Oh and FO3 has child skeletons because you know, children would die in nuclear fire too.

Another thing I wonder about is the DPFE. It can cause weird performance problems if it's not working right (and pretty much every 90's Ford needs it replaced after 10 years or so). It's probably still trying to give data on the EGR pressures but since it's gone it can't do it and is feeding false info to the ECU.
Oh weird, my Town Car is a 95 so I assumed a 97 Ford would have one as well.
Because CRT's don't turn on instantly. It can take a few seconds to even start displaying an image and even longer before it's the correct color and clarity. Why wait when you can just set a screen saver?
CRT's are the reason it's even called "burn in". The image is projected onto the glass of the display with a beam of light, if the image is static the beam burns a spot into the glass that can be seen even if it's turned off. My old TV when I was a kid had a few TV channel logos burned into the lower corner.

I don't see any mention of replacing or cleaning the MAF sensor. Give that a try; if the sensor is just failing instead of being flat out dead it will cause your fuel mixture to do dumb shit. I sprayed the one on my Town Car (so Ford) with electronics cleaner I had lying around and it got it's power and torque back (and stopped throwing a lean code on both banks).
Yup, they have to warm up for a few minutes to reach full brightness and the correct color. It's why most (if not all) manufacturers use halogen lamps for high beams even if you have HID low beams. Since the high beams aren't used as often or for only short bursts of time it's better to use halogens that can reach full brightness immediately.
> Yes, it is normal for HID bulbs to change hue as they age. It's not automatically indicative of an impending failure, it just happens over time.

He's right that they change hue but HID's will typically turn more blue or even pink as they begin to fail. They start out blue when you first turn them on for instance because they aren't warm and making the best connection (HID's work like an arc lamp, there's a spark arcing between two tungsten spikes). As they age the spikes degrade and the connection isn't great so they end up turning blue or pink.

To be fair sometimes people just really want a clean car. I was bored one day looking up what my old Town Car goes for on Ebay and there was one on there, a 96 Cartier (top trim level) that had sold for around $18,000. The car was 22 years old with no modern equipment (aside from power everything and automatic climate control) but it was a showroom clean car with around 15,000 miles on it. They aren't rare by any means, in 96 they sold 93,598 Town Cars and most were Signature's or Cartiers since the price difference wasn't huge and the Executive wasn't worth it.
I want a new Thunderbird, a respectable muscle car. I would also love a new Lincoln LS: A slightly boxy, RWD V8 sedan available with a 6 speed manual. I mean [these things](http://consumerguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/03115201990001.jpg) are just [downright beautiful](http://www.auto123.com/ArtImages/47864/2006-Lincoln-LS-01.jpg).

Bring back the LS and then use the same platform for the Thunderbird.
Vermont and NH also both use Chargers for their staties.
So I did some looking around since I figured that the Explorer must be faster but from what I can find, not really. The old P71 Crown Vics had a top speed of roughly 130mph and the Interceptor Utility is 132. The 0-60 of the P71 by the end of it's run was 7.5 seconds while the current Utility with the 3.7 puts down 7.9. 
From a quick glance at [this website](https://www.topspeed.com/cars/car-news/ford-s-pursuit-vehicles-ranked-highest-in-police-department-testing-ar171896.html) I'm going to say that since the Taurus "Ford Sedan" has a top speed of a 150 there's no way an Explorer could hit that with the same engine. If they're referring to the Explorer as the "Ford Utility 3.7" then it's only 132mph. As someone who has been pulled over by an Explorer while doing somewhere just above 115 I'm going to say it's probably correct.

> this is the most user friendly and good looking modern OS out there

I still think this statement is true however I came into Mac OS with OS X Tiger, 10.4. It was extremely user friendly and uncomplicated, everything "just worked" so I got curious and tried out Mac OS 8 and 9. They're also ridiculously user friendly. Mac OS stayed very consistent from OS 7 all the way up to OS X Lion, 10.7. After that it started feeling crowded.. too many gestures and the whole full screen apps thing (with multiple desktops) started making it difficult for people to actually use. It makes sense and is easy *once you've learned it* but it used to be that I could hand a MacBook to a 70 year old woman with no computer experience and she could get herself to Google and write her recipes down.

Edit: Also a lot of the ease of use you're experiencing in High Sierra has been there since OS 7. Things like minimizing by double clicking the titlebar, being able to drag text onto the desktop to save it as a snippet or link, being able to drag an item through multiple folders without letting go of the mouse, etc have been there for decades. Anything that feels mildly complicated has been tacked on since 10.7
Ah yes, I see someone else has played Fallout 4.
This was my first thought but honestly in the US I've never been somewhere that didn't have WiFi. The ethernet ports in my hotel's lobby for instance are so nasty and caked with shit from lack of use that I'm not sure they could even be used.

> gas pedal move under your foot as the cruise system does its thing.

It's very surreal. My mother's car has drive by cable so it moves the pedal. The moment you set your speed it feels like it's taking the gas pedal away from your foot like "DON'T TOUCH, ME HANDLE IT"
Not just Mercedes, a lot of "electronics" on older cars are vacuum driven. The automatic climate control on my old Town Car for instance has 6 or 7 vacuum tubes plugged into the back of it. 
Looks like the powertrain warranty on it would have been 60 months (5 years) and 60,000 miles. It could just barely be out of warranty depending on what month in 2013 OP bought it. If they bought it in 2012 it would have just run out.

I'm not talking about cornering at high speeds through intersections or busy neighborhoods by the way. I'm talking rural back roads where the speed limit can be 45 and the recommend speed for a corner coming up is 30 because it's a sharp turn. In the Town Car it's best to slow down to the recommended speed and take it easy but in my daily I can run around it at 50 with no troubles at all. The worst thing you'll hit out there is a deer.
>  than im not interested because thats dangerous

If the car is fully capable of taking fast turns it's not all that dangerous really. If anything I love having a flat cornering car because it's safer overall; I can actually maneuver around obstacles instead of hoping I can stop in time haha.
> I can easily take my buick around turns fast enough to get a ticket.

I can in my Town Car too, the body roll is extra terrifying. Have you ever driven a really flat handling car though? It's a really different experience. One that Miata owners are obsessed with.
In a nuclear holocaust scenario? Not really. The biggest problem with a nuclear summer for instance is basically this: Bombs detonate across the globe. Nuclear detonations expel a **lot** of heat. Water in the air, lakes, ponds and rivers gets displaced and evaporated quickly leaving a dry and arid landscape. The water doesn't just leave the planet though, it goes up into the atmosphere like it does on any hot summer day except there's just a lot of it this time around. I don't remember why exactly but the theory is that it won't rain and come back for a few weeks or even months as the climate stabilizes. Now the problem with this is two fold: Major drought killing off a lot of plant and animal life, and all that time in the atmosphere makes the rain extremely radioactive as fallout tends to drift with winds and rain. So when it does finally rain it won't be fun and it will last for months. It'll burn and kill most if not all plant life, animal life and more importantly micro organisms as well. Bacteria that causes decomposition will be killed off which makes it impossible for dead animals and plant life to become nutrients in the now desert floor meaning new growth will difficult if not completely impossible.
Here's some advice that I had to force onto a coworker about oversells: The biggest thing these systems look at is how many rooms were booked versus how many reservations went into no-show. If you're sold out one night and 4 people don't show up the system will assume (based on past trends) that it can more than likely oversell the hotel that same night next year since people will probably not show up. 

Anyways, it's important to understand that you should NOT be making fake reservations to hold a room if you're close to selling out. My coworker did this. All that happens is that if you don't need that room by night audit and you cancel the fake reservation, the system sees that you didn't sell a room and will assume that it can oversell you next year. The more you do it, the more it will fight back and screw you over. 

There's only two things you can do: Put a room out of order, or you can be more sneaky and start a reservation without finishing it. In Milton's system if you open the screen to make a res and choose the date and room type it will remove that room from the systems inventory to keep people from booking it while you're already selling it. So just do that and then minimize the window for the night.
Guess where I'm from: Modern cars can be pretty amazing, I think the Ford GT is wicked cool.
My guess is until the planet "dies". There's reason to believe Earth has gone through multiple planet deaths already where most life on the planet dies entirely for millennia before returning form evolving micro-organisms. There's theories for instance that Mars is currently in a death cycle and was once similar to Earth as it is now.
And heck a lot of us are willing to check you in early if we can. But if the hotel is sold out there just isn't a room for you and housekeeping won't be in until around 8 or 9 to start cleaning rooms that have been checked out of. 
A Buick LaSabre is pretty terrifying cornering above 30 to be honest. Good ol' boats those are. There's a lot of them in my area and even in my car I end up coming up right behind them on turnpikes and a lot of back roads because they have to slow way down on corners whereas my car doesn't.

Anyways, the people that can afford supercars can usually afford a couple hundred bucks to take it on an actual track.
Oh! I'm sorry, I thought you were referring to the US.

I mean it doesn't taste like real cheese but who gives a crap, it's still good. It's like people complaining that Chicken McNuggets don't taste like chicken. Why would you expect them too?
Basically yes. People surmise that if there's worldwide nuclear detonations it'll fuck up the Earth's weather and create one of  two things: a scorching hot permanent summer or a deathly freezing permanent winter. Everywhere.

Handling and speed mainly. The Aventador and Huracan are mid engined cars with extremely precise steering and very flat handling around corners. It's not like you can't get an insane MB, but they don't make a mid-engined car.
I'm being semi-sarcastic. But yeah as others have pointed out a car like this is a toy to the people that would have been able to afford it. The average person that owns a modern Lamborghini doesn't just have the Lambo, they've got other cars. An S550 is a wonderful car, but a supercar is a plaything and will be ultimately way more fun in comparison. No you can't drive it in the rain, or snow or go grocery shopping with it, but that's not the point of it.
The canopy is automatic, the headlights have doors that go down, it's got sequential turn signals, rudimentary navigation (I assume didn't work as it was a concept in 69), and a big ol' V8. Oh my lord. 
Yes of course every multi-million/billionaire should obviously be driving a Honda Civic.
Alright good point, there's nobody there.
Where do you get one minute? The article says nothing and the Twitter post in the OP just says the video was shot "after the men were pulled from the vehicle". Doesn't say at all how long it took to get them out.
Well I'd say this is interesting for the price alone. [2009 Maxima with 109k miles, new tires, new battery, runs and drives for $1500.](https://nh.craigslist.org/cto/d/2009-nissan-maxima/6508893031.html)

A dealer would sell it for 7 to 10k but there's no pictures of the outside so maybe it's trashed.
>while we empathize with the desire to put the hammer down when crossing a Midwestern state, doing 160 mph is actually slower than following the speed limit when you factor in the inevitable night in jail.

Unless you've got the displacement you've got to rev it damn it. 2/3k rpm in my car isn't much either, it's not until it's up past 4k that you feel power coming on. I don't know why anyone expects a 4 cylinder to have low end torque like a V8.
> No one is going to be impressed by an a3 or 3 series

Maybe not enthusiasts but the average person will be impressed. Every here hates my car but I've legitimately gotten compliments from people for it.
I've never needed to, rain just rolls off of both of my cars. My mothers and grandmothers SUV's however have rear wipers and it's necessary because a ton of dirt and spray covers it.
My thought is that it looks like they had to pull the driver out with the jaws of life. I imagine the doors are jammed shut and it was easier to go in from the front. Considering the frunk is just missing entirely, their job was half done.
Wow that place looks really familiar. Reminds me of that video from last year of a Tesla on auto-pilot that (supposedly) disengaged at the last second before slamming into the concrete barrier. 

Edit: I don't mean this negatively, I just remember a video blowing up last year of a Tesla slamming into a concrete barrier and it looks weirdly similar.
Only because people like you refuse to touch them on the brand name alone. It's no better than people buying a CLA because it's got a Mercedes badge.

Seriously. Even for their time period these are extremely un-Apple concepts all around. "iPhone ELITE"? These were only a few years after Apple switched to Intel and calling things "Pro", why would they ever say Elite?

I still find this interesting because even on my Lincoln the HID's were an *option*. Why? Why weren't they just standard? And it's even more confusing when you realize that Ford was the first manufacturer to ship a car with HID headlights in 1998 with the Lincoln Mark VIII.
A better reason to own a Ford would be to get one with the keypad and never worry about locking your keys in the car again.

My dad used this for years as a trucker when doing maintenance on his semi. It works pretty damn good.
With my first car the CEL had been stuck on for literally 6 years (no mechanic could figure it out, P0401 EGR Insufficient flow. DPFE sensor was dying). One night driving it home after work I got about halfway home and something felt off... something was different... The bright orange CEL was out, for no apparent reason. I pulled over into an empty parking lot and restarted the car just to see if the light had burnt out. It hadn't, it just went out for a day for no apparent reason.

Boost as well. 
Engine braking in a lower gear at a higher RPM will create more compression/resistance in the engine and slow the vehicle more yes. In fact my car (automatic) will keep the car in the "lowest gear possible" if it's engine braking. If that means it can shift to 2nd and put the engine at 5500rpm it will because it's more effective.

Thanks for reminding me that Ebay exists and sells random junk. I wanted to buy CD's for my car (it's got aux but for shorter drives I don't feel like plugging it in) but the stores all have them way too expensive. Stop in Walmart and you'll find 5 to 10 packs for $20+. On Amazon they're much cheaper: 50 packs for $10. But then you add $15 shipping to it and suddenly I lose interest.. Meanwhile I just bought a 50 pack from Ebay for $16 with free shipping. Woot.

It probably depends on the state. In NH you can't have any lights facing forward that aren't orange or white. That includes DRL's.

What car? Some let you open the windows and moonroof (and I presume the panoramic roof) with the keyfob to air it out before getting in. I know some MB's also turn on the cooled seats as well.
Wait is that why I see so many early 2010's Ford's not signaling on the interstate? Is the BMW effect actually a real thing??
My car seems to handle this alright. I think it matters what conditions the car starts in. So if I start the car in the daylight the headlights will be off and pretty much stay off until dusk or until I turn the wipers on. Going through dark shaded areas or tunnels doesn't make them turn on. But if I start the car at night and they turn on they'll just stay on until it's very bright out (like if I'm driving in the morning).

Did one of them happen to fall into the bumper?
In my car (Ford product) the cruise control is smooth as butter, I imagine like your F150. 

Edit: I tend to use it through certain towns on my daily drive since these two specific places have very watchful cops and love to stop people. There's a lot of tiny hills in these two towns and it can keep a steady 32mph without any jarring acceleration or engine braking.
The ultra-assisted power steering on my Town Car feels incredible driving around town or in parking lots (can you steer your car with your pinky?) but it can be absolutely terrifying on the interstate since there's no feeling to it at all.

Edit: also my MKZ beeps when I have less than 50 miles worth of fuel left and it usually scares me but for some reason that has just stopped for the past month or so... it'll still beep for other things, but not fuel.
*This isn't the ocean cruise I was expecting!*
Have you checked the wires to the plugs and back? I remember reading (because of my 2007 MKZ (Ford product) having a dead injector) a few forum posts from mid-2000's F150 owners that said that the wiring to the coils was actually beginning to melt with age and heat. After the engine warmed the wires would be able to make a short and cause a misfire.
I feel like the early 90's BMW 850csi could still be sold today (minus the popup headlights) and nobody would know it's an old design. It's so [beautiful.](https://www.carscoops.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/BMW-850i-5.jpg)
>  I’ve heard those lubricate with fuel, not oil. 

They lubricate by having oil mixed into the gasoline. No gas to the engine, no oil either. I know some cars had a spinning flywheel (I remember this extremely vaguely so I'm probably using the wrong wording) that allowed fuel/oil to flow into the cylinders even when coasting but some didn't. The Trabant for instance could only coast in its final gear.

To be fair I don't think electronics as a whole was advanced enough to support what people wanted or needed until more recently.
My Town Car has eaten through the right lower balljoint at least once every two years. The first time it broke it happened at the end of the driveway right as my mother was about to get onto the highway. The second time it happened after we backed up to leave for work/school and it let go in the driveway. That one in particular was lucky because it stopped in the best place to be towed.

I used to think that until I got my current car which has navigation. It's an 07 so it's an old nav but it's honestly just simpler. I don't need to plug my phone in so the battery doesn't die, I don't need to jam my phone into a phone holder that may or may not stay suction cupped to my windshield and I don't have to deal with the google maps voice screaming through my radio since I'm usually playing music fairly loudly through the aux.

Yeah I'd actually be kind of annoyed if they called the 300 an Imperial. An old Imperial is nicer than a modern 300 as far as I'm concerned (and I don't mean that to hate on the 300, the Imperial's were just awesome).
Well that's even more confusing since Ford made the Lincoln Futura concept back in the 50's (it's the Adam West batmobile even).

Modern engines are pretty incredible at putting things off until they're truly a problem. I had an injector fail in my car recently but I assume it was more of a steady failure over the course of a month or two. When I drove it home from the garage the car felt really weird for a minute. All of a sudden it kind of stuttered, engine speed dropped and the "powertrain fault" light came on. Got home, restarted the car and it's been fine ever since. I assume it had changed timing among other things as the injector went bad so the moment it had a working one it had to readjust everything again.
Nobody likes my car because it's a dressed up Ford Fusion (which the base, no options model with FWD kind of is) so I understand the feeling brother.

It's the V6 though, and while I have no problems with that this community has put down the Mustang V6 for a very long time as being less than the V8 *and* the I4.

A lot of them had [column shifters](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Column_shift.JPG/1280px-Column_shift.JPG) sure but it came out of the steering column at a horizontal angle, not from the dashboard sticking straight up. 

Edit: also column shifters don't have a button to press. You step on the brake and pull the shifter towards you then move it up or down. It kind of just slots into the gear selections. Super satisfying. 
I think it's part of the middle screen on top of the dash but I can't remember.
I'm surprised no one's mentioned the first generation Prius with it's [dildo shaped shifter](http://consumerguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/01812221990002.jpg).

>You'll notice the news article you linked to doesn't even mention maintenance.

CTRL+F and reading is a wonderful thing because this is quoted directly from the second article:

>“Run away from this car! My transmission was reprogrammed at 12k miles. Drove well, no issues and all scheduled maintenance done regularly at the dealer. At 65k transmission started shuddering and then vehicle would stall and die in traffic, very dangerous.

And continuing right below that is Nissan literally recognizing that there is an issue by issuing a TSB: 

>A Technical Service Bulletin (NTB05-084A) regarding hesitations while accelerating was released to Nissan service departments in November 2006. The TSB, which was written for the 2003-2007 Murano, tells mechanics to check for these conditions if an owner complains about hesitations:

>The Service Engine Soon (SES) light is not illuminated on your gauge cluster.
Code P0868 is stored in the Transmission Control Module (TCM).
The terrifying reality is that acting like you belong is a great way to get into places you shouldn't be in.
> Again, no data, just wild anecdotal claims.

Google and you'll find the myriad of forum posts about the LS, Aviator, Explorer and most frequently the Mustang. It wasn't news worthy back in the early 2000's so it's hard to nail down one post for you to look at. And once again Google searching shows that most of Nissan's CVT's failed around 40,000 miles which regardless of maintenance is a ridiculously low number.

It's not hard to find: [Here's an article for instance detailing the older CVT's failing consistently still.](https://www.wcpo.com/money/consumer/dont-waste-your-money/nissan-owners-say-transmissions-still-going-bad)

And [here's an article from last September talking about how the newer ones "stutter" among other issues while carrying out Nissan's scheduled maintenance.](http://www.nissanproblems.com/trends/cvt/) Now stuttering *can* just be a programming issue, that's very true, but with the past reputation it would be extremely unnerving.

That's just listings of cars for sale.. nothing on there is going to state whether or not either have had transmission replacements in their lifetime.[ Here's a list of Ford Explorers for sale](https://www.cars.com/for-sale/searchresults.action/?mdId=21105&mkId=20015&mlgId=28858&page=1&perPage=20&prMx=10000&searchSource=GN_REFINEMENT&showMore=true&sort=relevance&stkTypId=28881&yrId=20199&yrId=20143&yrId=20198&yrId=20142&yrId=20197&yrId=20141&zc=52722) that have the infamous 5R55S transmission that usually grenades itself around 80k miles. There's a *huge* possibility that the vehicles in this list have had replacements put in but you'd never know.

As someone with a "gas guzzler" that gets 22mpg between city and highway: I don't notice much when it comes to gas prices at the pump. I fill up once a week for about $35 and enjoy my car. An extra 10mpg for something much less fun and comfortable isn't worth it to me.
>Sometimes it might be a issue of the hardware not being strong enough.

I'm saying there was another Ford issue where the hardware (casing) wasn't strong enough. 
>  the technology is advancing regardless.

I'm glad that it is! In other brands. When a 10 year old car is $10k+ with lowish mileage (low enough to consider buying a used car and low enough to actually get a loan for one) most people would prefer to have the transmission replaced and know that it should theoretically last the rest of the life of the vehicle then buy a used car that may or may not break down in the same fashion in short time. 
It's almost like people fix their cheap cars when they can't afford to buy another one ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Seriously this is just common now ever since GM's massive recall for the ignition issue. It's not that anything is more wrong with modern cars than before just that now manufacturers are more comfortable actually fixing issues. 
One of the proposed solutions to the Mustang/Explorer/Aviator/LS automatic transmission shifting issue is because of the "servo bore" being made of steel and the part of the case that it slides into being made of aluminum. The bore just strips away the casing until it can't make a seal anymore. 

As a sidenote I have a slightly above basic understanding of automatic transmissions. I'm going off of what a guy on YouTube said.
Good bot
I don't think that had much to do with regulations so much as manufacturers just not implementing it for various reasons. It's still unique that you can get turning assist lamps on a panther body car and 80's Chrysler's since that's about all that had them for some reason.
No the thing is that I already knew I *really* didn't want one because it's one of the ugliest things I've ever seen.

True but I've had to speak to a lot of people from Central myself when they have property specific questions and as a born and raised white American I've never struggled to understand them. I say "racists" because they'll get me sometimes and when I say "yes I am at the hotel" they say something like, "Good! I don't wanna take to some Ab-dool in zanzibar or wherever Indians come from". Like they didn't even attempt to talk to them, they just said they're from India and got pissed about it.
I've had people get to me and ask "are you at the hotel?" to which I respond yes (because I am, I know though that some people at central just say yes). Then they proceed to book the most basic reservation possible, no special rate, no requests, it's for months from now on a slow night. They didn't need to waste my time but "OH SOME INDIAN GUYS GONNA MESS IT UP". Racist idiots.
"Is it set to "cool"?"

"YES, I'VE TURNED IT DOWN AND IT'S CLEARLY BROKEN"

Maintenance then radios me to tell me it was set to Heat, not cool.

Someone else in here was joking but the Aztek. I seriously don't think it's bad, at least not the second "gen" one's without the body colored skirt. A lot of the cars in this list are way uglier to me (Prius, Juke/Nissan's in general)

I'd say a '16 Spark is nicer overall than anything Nissan's putting out.
Not only ugliest, but least practical as well! Doug did a decent job at highlighting why the cross cabriolet is fairly useless. The biggest problem being that because it's a retractable soft top there's no third row, so there's no storage behind the back seats, and the soft top takes up about half of the trunk space as well. So you have a bloated 2 door crossover with less interior room than a crossover and less trunk space than a traditional sedan. It doesn't drive well, the windshield itself rattles over everything, and getting into the back seats is a massive pain because it's a 2 door, but they also made those 2 doors much larger (presumably to make it easier to get into the back, which it doesn't) which means you can't get in or out of the car if people park within a reasonable distance of you in a car park. The whole car is garbage.

Hey it's the game of life.
Yeah it does, my car does too. If I remember right in the video he mentions that as well but it was just another thing that was blatantly cheap. They're visible on my car for instance but not obvious. They're mostly obscured by the seat and you won't notice them, but in the Mirage they're just bright steel and you see them the moment you open the door. The car has so many cheap aspects to it he just added that as an "and of course the seat rails are obvious. You think a company that calls your car a 'Mitsubishi Motors' in the manual would make any attempt to hide the rails?" 
This is a 14 second video, why? It just repeats so leave it at 3 seconds and don't waste my bandwidth. 
He takes loans for a lot of these cars from Penfed since they'll give loans on old cars (his 20 year old Viper was on a loan for instance) and then sells them before they've depreciated any if all. 
His point was that there are other cars in the same price bracket that aren't as cheap as the Mirage. He ripped on it hard because it's a terrible deal overall when a Versa, Fiesta or Sonic are much nicer cars for a few dollars more a month.

It's really not. Her work schedule was deemed unacceptable for the well being of a dog. A child could be left with a nanny or daycare though.
As someone who loves cars an S550 AMG would make me pretty happy to be honest.
A coworker/family friend of mine had an easier time adopting a human child than she did a dog. The Humane Society makes it extremely difficult.
Seriously, buy Acetaminophen, not Tylenol. It's *literally* the same thing.
My grandmother was having this problem with her reusable K-cup. The trick is that it only sits perfectly in the machine one way. If it's upside down or sideways it looks okay and the machine will run but it fucks up the coffee.
I know the German brands tend to use young male human blood for it's performance capabilities. Ever wonder why the lube tech position is always open at your local BMW or Mercedes dealer? The average lube tech has just over 5 quarts of blood. Only a quarter of it has to be lubricant so they just put the final quart in a bottle for later.
It's all a corporate conspiracy to get people to break their old devices and cars so that they'll have to purchase a new one. Well I'm on to them and not falling for it; everything I own is 10 years old!
You know why ATF is usually a dark pink? It's 25% lubricant and 75% sacrificial blood.
I think quite a few do. Even a Camaro can have it's speed and acceleration limited for "teen" drivers.
As someone sitting in a Ford/Lincoln dealer right now for an oil change I can say this is one of the best dealers I've ever dealt with. Super friendly people, always smiling and they actually listen to people. I've seen a Chevy in here for service even which might say more than I originally thought..
That and when you ask questions about the underpinnings of the car you can expect them not to know (within reason). Want to know if the Camaro has a limited slip rear differential? Ask the service department, they're the ones paid to know.
If you're a GM tech why are you driving that foreign piece of junk??
> If it’s illegal, will the profits offset the fines and bad publicity?

It's not like this hasn't happened in modern times either. Look at the Ford Pinto fires that injured and killed people. Ford weighed the costs of updating the design and manufacturing process with paying off the families of those hurt and killed and found it was more profitable to leave the Pinto as it was. 
Everyone in the comments is sad but he's literally saying hello from the grave. Even in death he won't STOP.
You know what, I'm with you. The wheels are disproportionately small but if you just went up an inch or two it would look silly without lowering it.
Because when you need a minivan you're probably a grumpy person and it should reflect that. Nothing worse than chipper things all around you if you're pissed off.
Hey I've never balanced a wheel or have been trained to do so or have even touched a balancer, but even I can tell you that if you line the wheel with the same weights all the way around you're not actually balancing anything.
I've been told by management that I can refuse service to anyone I see fit, within reason (as-in if they're just annoying then I can't' kick them out). A lot of times if you have a guest like this and they're are a snowflake member then they'll have a history of crap like this with the snowflake program which makes it real easy for management to back you up.
Ah right, OP's referring to the BIOS. That's not a fault of the SSD though, that's a fault of the manufacturer.
Similar to Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain.
Because he doesn't know that's why it's not working. They disabled it in Windows 8+ after two decades.
That's just my guess. The part is cheap which is great, and judging from pictures it looks like you can remove the front fascia and the cooler is just right there in the open, hence how he probably broke it.
Parts.com puts the oil cooler itself at about $250 so I'd say probably $500 with labor. Could be WAY worse.

Oh
I too love touching the disgusting piss covered wall in public restrooms with every wipe.
My problem with the notch is that there's no point to the notch on these phones. Apple has their reasons, OnePlus does not and the execution is poor since Android will not account for it. Put your thumb over the top middle of your Pixel every time you use it and see if the notch is right for you. It's just a cash grab to try and get idiots who want to go "LOL I have an iPhony"
I remember this happening once when they first started the DMCA crap. Panic! At the Disco had a video on their Vevo from a concert and they had it embedded on their own website. Lo and behold it got taken down because of a DMCA from Viacom.
Why does everything General Motors attract people like this?
Piloted.
I'm going to guess they're referring to the fact that parts of the window are artificially blurred. It almost looks like it's just a clean part of the glass but the car's A pillar is obviously blurred.
I'm okay with this because man does this artist draw... weirdly. They look like the Navi (spelling) from Avatar.

On my own 95 Town Car I can tell you that while it's fairly easy access, the angle you have to go in at to get the bulb in without touching anything isn't super fun. 
Gotta love the X it puts over the icon when it refuses to charge it.
And that makes sense but this is closure because of a snow storm that's going to make traveling dangerous. Nobody should have to be there.
First flat tire I ever got and the same thing happened. Took the lugs off and low and behold the wheel still felt bolted on. Kept trying to pull it off (without pulling the car off the shitty little temp jack) until a city dump truck stopped and asked if we needed help. He took a look at it for a second, and then just gave it one big kick and it fell off.
Oh man, if I heard someone say "I'd have reached across the desk" they would've lost their room right then and there. You do NOT threaten me or my coworkers and get to stay the night with us. Your room is gone, you will leave peacefully or the cops will drag you out.
There's a sign that points to the elevators at my property and it's just there for show since no one reads it. They also don't believe me when I say it's straight down the hall because they usually stop 10 feet down and come back. Seriously, it's down the hall, keep walking til you fucking find it.

But, more to the point, no they don't listen or read. Case in point this is in my parking lot tonight: https://imgur.com/FJJCKeF

If it's still there in the morning then they'll have to get it from the towing company!
"Hell-oh this is Jamesh cawling from Ex-sped-ia on behalf of a mutual guest, I'm calling because the guest would like to cancel his reservation and was wondering if it could be done so without penalty?"
I knew a lot of people who were complete idiots as teenagers and have grown up to be good people. I mean as an example (not someone I knew personally obviously) Bill Gates was known to speed (100+) and street race, would it be good for the world if he had just died? I'm not trying to justify street racing or driving like an idiot, just trying to point out why I feel differently about a teenager versus a full on adult.
I wouldn't say that's similar. When teenagers throw rocks off a bridge it's to intentionally cause damage and hurt someone else (usually by hurting their car). A kid street racing is trying to have fun, they aren't going out of their way to actually hurt anyone else, they just aren't thinking about how they could hurt someone or even kill them. It's like the kids that start dumpster fires. They just want the thrill and "fun" of doing something they aren't supposed to do. They aren't thinking about how the dumpster could catch the building on fire and kill it's occupants.
This looks sexual. Why does this look sexual?
The Proper People did a video at Clinton Road and there were tons of kids stoned off their asses hanging out all over it. Helps explain some of the weird things like the stones and wheelchair.
Yeah teenagers are fucking dumb, doesn't mean they deserve to die.
Yup, I've got an old Town Car (panther bodies unite!) and it's built like a tank, or a brick. I hit a Prius once with it when it ran a red light and crossed in front of me. Pushed in his quarter panel quite a bit and my car looks like nothing ever happened.
Depends. I don't feel bad if he's 20+ years old and should know better, but if he was just some dumb teenager then it sucks that he learned a lesson the hard way.'

Edit: Jesus Christ yes he died, he didn't learn a lesson because he's fucking dead. 
Yup that's a Crown Vic alright. Looks like it may have skipped over a median or something because they may be large but they aren't taller than most cars. This one landed in their windows, completely missed most of it's side crash structure.
I never have furry dreams, or even horny ones... Closest I had to one was like a YouTube video about how large two different latex suits could get before bursting. I mean I love inflation and bursting and all, but it was like a badly done educational film. No one's turned on by sex ed haha.
They put the upper coolant hose right on top of the alternator in the Aviator. Recommended procedure is to remove the alternator (which is you know, on top of the engine bay) from underneath the car.
A friend of mine has a 92 Cadillac something or other that looks exactly like the one in the picture, which is why I went with 90's.
If you Google mark viii interior you'll some of the other color choices it came in (I picked that picture because it shows the shape of the interior better). Some of them still have a more modern look (namely the cream/white) 
I still don't understand how we've invented so many things just for the sake of convenience but for some reason velcro shoes are for children and the elderly. 
Oh shit, I actually like the way it looks. 
Looks really good for an early 90's car in what looks like the city though.
Looks like a squashed Odyssey to me. I literally said "Ew!" when the picture loaded.
Anyone else think the Tourer looks like a squashed Odyssey?
That would be the 98 in the picture if I'm not mistaken.

It gets away with it by not technically being a car. Kind of like how in the UK the Reliant Robin was popular because teenagers could get a motorcycle license before a car license. Since the Robin was a 3 wheeler it was technically a motorcycle.

Edit: [It depends on the state](https://slingshot.polaris.com/en-us/license-requirements/)
Yeah I saw people praising i.reddit over imgur and I just don't get it. It takes so long to actually connect and even start downloading a picture that sometimes I just downvote and move on.

To be fair though one president has been shot (and lived) and it was with a revolver if I'm not mistaken. Another was flat out assassinated with a bolt action rifle. Neither of these would be taken away since they are not assault weapons.

Edit: Double checked, Reagan was in fact shot with a .22LR revolver.

From what I can see only Motortrend claims 5.8, [videos show it doing 7.1 to 7.8 with stock everything.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wzq3JbQzEek). It's even slower than my car which weighs 1300lbs more and is considered slow on here.

I do remember the shaders looked much better, I think they pulled in the same shaders from Fallout 4 which still impress me occasionally.
I noticed a lot of the 4k textures/mods look terrible anyways. They always end up looking way sharper than real life which makes everything look even more fake. I usually stuck to the "lower quality" ones.
> Except higher texture quality

I've had the high quality texture pack for the old one and never noticed a difference between it and SE.
I *always* get: Fallout 3/4/NV/Skyrim/Obvlivion will now detect your hardware....... hardware unrecognized, video quality set to Low. Then I have to open the game, set the settings (specifically Oblivion) and then restart the game.
Fuckin serious? I love Reddit sometimes.
It's a good way to make a few bucks when you clean out your closet in 5 to 10 years. I've got a box for Final Cut Studio (I forget which version, I want to say 3, so early 2000's) without the software. Tons of the manuals and other information for it are in the box and I only keep it because someone will buy it when I decide to get rid of it.
Bejeweled 2 Deluxe was the best for the music and theme alone.
Yes but if I'm not mistaken he's talking about the special made ones that are a more cardboard like paper and actually fit the product box near perfect. People went nuts for the HomePod bag for instance.
The thing is, just like NES/SNES games, the boxes of the product often sell for quite a bit years later and people often save them just for that.
The framerate drops as more come into view, damn graphics card needs to be updated.
Honestly the [Lincoln LS](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--wWaUstqj--/c_scale,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/1381255446371406994.jpg) catches my attention whenever I see them, which is rare. They're not new, but not too old. You could get them with a V8 and a manual. And I think it's just a nice looking car, like an old 5 series.

God I can still hear that damn roar/growl they do right before they run out of the bushes at you.
It used to irritate me back when the iPad came out because people wouldn't shut up about Apple claiming they "invented" the tablet when Tablet PC's existed long before that. "Apple should stop saying they're innovative when all they did was use an old idea!" -okay, they never said they were innovative. They did not say the first iPad was an innovative product, they said it was a *revolutionary* device. They "revolutionized the tablet" because if you ever used an old Windows XP tablet they were all complete garbage. All they did was claim to make a tablet that was actually useful for once. 

Just like how people attribute the invention of the assembly line to Henry Ford. Ford did not invent it, they did not claim to invent it, they were just the first company to refine it and make it useful for their products.
Ok..Yeah, no. 
Oh! Well that's more interesting than it sounded at first.

Are you talking about barcode being persistent? Because my store had these exact scanners and the image moves at a pretty slow speed.
Honestly I like Ellen, she's always come across as an extremely genuine and lovely person. Her fans only bug me because they're *very* over the top nowadays about everything. When she makes a joke it's just screaming, which is fine, but when she just sneezes and says "excuse me" they scream just as hard and I don't get it. It's a bit excessive. Makes it feel like The Price Is Right where Drew Carey is an awesome guy but when the bell is just going DING DING DING for a full minute it gets irritating.

OBDII was mandatory in 1996 but it was definitely out before then.

It's all it is. In Europe the diesels are more popular than NA so you can purchase a 330ci or 330cd.
Never thought I'd see the day someone wanted a Sonic for more torque but yes actually. More torque at a lower RPM. 
Can attest to this. I put ceramics on my Town Car and it was an obvious difference.

~~My MKZ's headlights look like god damn spotlights compared to my Town Car since the Town Car's are just so horrible.

So I went from half brightness halogens to full brightness HID's, big difference.~~

There's one at my local mcdonalds on a corner. The thing is though that the corner is wide enough so that a semi and its trailer can make it around the back of the building so me and everyone else in town just goes around it.
I want to say I tried that and it managed to glitch its way into the trailer in classic Bethesda fashion.

Truck, cars, vans, SUV's... they've all been stuck since 2005.
For the life of me I can't remember what I did in that scenario. I remember the actual spawning of the deathclaw clear as day but how I ever got out is beyond me. I can even picture the trailer. It was sat on the right side of the road, the open door facing to the left, and another highway was like a hundred feet above.
It's not really the twist, just a minor one. The real twist involving Shaun is more interesting so don't worry.

> no one knows what an Abarth is.

Name alone is one of the reasons I don't care for it. It seems every other company has a "cool" sounding name:

Mercedes-Benz AMG

BMW Motorsports

Nissan Nismo

Saturn Redline

Then you've got more one-off kind of names like WRX, RS, ST, ZR, etc.

Then you've got Abarth, which doesn't roll off the tongue and is dangerously close to barf :/ I know it's entirely stupid and superficial but it's always tainted my view of it.
Took a while reading through this thread to remember one of mine: The Passat. It's always been a "cheap" economy car in my mind for one reason or another and has always looked the part. But more recently they've started to just look really nice to me. They look like well built car, something akin to BMW. They finally look like a German car and I like that.
> Chrysler Sebring covertible

Okay that's a fine reason for wanting a Solara but not a Sebring. The Sebring (even with a convertible) is one of the worst cars ever made. You can't even change the battery in it in under an hour.
My first car has it but it hasn't worked longer than I've been driving it.
I imagine most cars do what mine does: If there's any hint of losing traction then cruise control shuts off automatically.

That is exactly how English grammar works, yes. As human beings though we can surmise that there is a certain level of error in other human beings when understanding a complicated rule set for something so extremely mundane. As such it is normal for us to infer what other people are attempting to say regardless of how it was actually said since even native English speakers are rarely perfect. You've more than likely misused grammar in multiple interactions with other people today in your life for instance and nobody stood there to give you a lesson.
He said they run the weaponry off of floppy disks and don't have internet. As in the weaponry isn't connected to the internet thank god.

Comfortable cooled/heated seats and a 14 speaker THX surround sound radio is pretty enjoyable, yeah.
Replying to your edit I just saw: The only extensions I've found that do that sync things like bookmarks and history. I like how FF sync and Chrome sync can keep things like passwords as well.

"-so then you need to know the square footage of the rooms! Who is your manager?! I want to speak to them since they definitely know and YOU should know too!"

"His name is [redacted]"

He didn't know, the GM doesn't know, the maintenance guys don't know, and the property manager has no clue.

There are people who enjoy driving and don't buy boring econoboxes.
A car should have no issues of any kind at 22k. When it's made it to 100k we'll see what happens. 
Probably because those have been more recent while Nissan's CVT's have sucked for decades and they've done nothing about it.
Any transmission should be fine at 53k.
I kind of wish I could experience this then since what you've described just sounds like my car which has a normal 6 speed torque converter automatic. Sits comfortably around 2k rpm at 80 to 90mph and if you floor it it [starts moving.](https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=oUTeUAhue-o)

On some older vehicles you can spin the mirror around and the back side of it is the dim mirror.

> I get blinded by goddamn Corollas

This is a known issue to be fair. Corolla's have ungodly bright and seemingly unfocused headlights now.
I still think it should be mandated that pickups have their lowbeams on the bumper and the high beams can be up top where they are now.
If you've ever driven a base model older Rav4 you'll understand that there's no other way to drive one.
And you walked them both with that sweet V6 right?
In my area at least every Mustang I see drives really normally. The only time I've seen one drive aggressively was a brand new Shelby GT (it had transport plates on it!) on the route to my town. There's a couple passing spots and I shot around him and 3 other cars. As soon as we got to the second one he floored it around me and I followed. We did about 85 in a 50.. Really fucking dumb, but it was fun. It's not like my car is anywhere near as powerful but it was fun to be in a "race" like that.
Part of me still really hates the spinner since I remember around 2010 it felt like *everything* just used a spinner instead of providing any information that something was actually happening.
Every computer I've had with Windows does this exact same thing and it's outright infuriating. In the end, after it sits at 95% for a good 20 minutes or so, it doesn't even find anything. "No search results"? Fuck you. Get Everything and shut Windows search completely down.
Don't know about NT4 but I think windows 2000 had cleartype, but I could be wrong.

Same thing used to happen when I worked retail.

Edit: and to further my point the dad in this scenario grabbed a dress and headed to the counter, he knew what he wanted and just needed to buy it. The other man was more than likely waiting on someone else's decision.
For the love of god this sub is officially complete garbage now. Every pixelated shit picture that's been circulated around Facebook has been upvoted to the heavens the past few months and it's awful, it's not funny, it's just bots. I've only stayed because there have been occasionally actually funny things but this is too much.

Gee, I'm surprised they changed it from such a good name!
