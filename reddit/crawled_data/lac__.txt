I realized the issue was in Nvidia Control Panel, there’s a button to disable or enable monitors on the left hand side. 
Internships don't always mean little to no pay. Companies should always pay a fair wage, but ultimately students should be smart enough not to take a non-paying internship, no matter how nice it'll look on a resume.

I get that not everyone wants to be an employee, and I get it. You want to try to make a living on your own, go for it. But if you want a much more secure route in life - you need a degree. 
I’m not disagreeing that that’s possible, but it isn’t the common case. 
That is absolutely not true. If you’re trying to support yourself, by yourself, you’ll need to have some decent business skills. 
Just like there is a chance you’ll get a good job without a degree, there’s a chance you could support yourself the same way. But it’s not a good one. To each his own though. 
It’s not about how useless it is, it’s about how employable it makes you.

If this were to happen, it'd be a ways out. Split screen games only work by lowering graphics quality in order to preserve frame rate. For a vast open-world type game like Fortnite this would take *a lot* more processing power than the Xbox/PlayStation could handle even with graphics compromises.

One of the apps recommended should do the job. I’m curious as to why you’d like to do this though. 
It’s unfortunate, but any battery powered device will have its battery degrade overtime. In Apple’s case, they try to mitigate this by throttling in certain situations. By no means will it act like a $100 phone in a few years. 
Have both of you guys toggled the on switch for iMessage in settings? 
As soon as the phone reconnects to a data source, be it cellular or WiFi, the notifications will start flooding in. You must have some pretty bad stuff on GroupMe.

The price of the case is irrelevant. I accept that if I drop the phone it’ll probably end up messed up in some way. I don’t want to ruin it with a _MILITARY GRADE FULL BODY AND SCREEN PROTECTION LIFE PROOF CASE_. I use a case for a little extra grip to prevent the inevitable drop as much as I can. 
My experience has been perfect, no issues.
This is happening on a very small number of devices, and if it happens to you, Apple will fix it.

Broke the case in half trying to remove it, hurt like a bitch. Thought I would break the phone.
I believe he’s talking about the animation. 
This is absolutely incorrect. 
If they confirmed that the damage happened in their possession, it sounds like they just took responsibility.  
At least use the Reddit app instead of Safari.
False. 
No. 
What feature...?
How is having a full screen a copy? The Mi Mix doesn’t have a notch.. it’s not like they copied them there. 
I like your review. The only thing I would disagree with is the sunglasses with Face ID. The first time I put on sunglasses it failed once, I put in my password, and it worked fine. Next day, worked fine. 
Doesn’t fix it for “it”. 
I’d love to try it. So far I’ve only needed to charge the phone at night, so the slow wireless charging is fine. 
If there are any defects they will replace it, no questions asked. 
I highly doubt Apple will enable access to the IR camera, but rather allow access to the face mapping as a whole.

I don’t understand why there are complaints about the keyboard. Imagine how hard it would be to hold the phone if the keyboard was mashed against the bottom bezel.

This is an effect of OLED on black colors, better emphasized in low brightness. 
I almost guarantee you that this is a software bug, force reset should fix it.
After using battery percentage for years, it’s almost therapeutical not having it show up top. 
Let it drain, then charge it.  Out of the box I couldn’t get past 82%, decided I would just use it throughout the day down to about 20%, then it charged just fine. 
It’s due to Apple Pay. Disable double press to pay. 
No it was part of the email. 
Reboot

You need to install the beta profile on the X..
That doesn't sound like an X glitch, that's software. And it's not a 'glitch' it's just poor design.
One of the reviews I read mentioned that the notch was absolutely a compromise, but a welcomed one. I couldn't agree more. 
So now we're back to bezels..? They don't need a Plus model to do this. They could have left more room at the top on the X.
Where would the Face ID sensors go?
Maybe click "why did I receive this message?"..
Way to hyjack the thread. 

They'll work just fine. 
I wouldn't say best. But sure, it's got a good camera. 
This is what mine says: 

> Your Coverage End Date will automatically adjust to two years from the date you first activate your iPhone.
Physics. 
They've got the same specs under the hood. X has OLED + higher resolution screen + Face ID - Touch ID + Better front camera.
Well stop trying to scroll to fast, by the time it detects you've lifted you've already placed it back on the screen.
I believe that's why demo units have a 'Face ID' app.
Good plan
Sounds like you want to return it, so return it.

That being said, I hate when people ask what's the new thing it does. Face ID is new, the OLED display might as well be 'new', the form factor is 'new', the front-facing camera is 'new'.

So it might not have one brand new killer feature, it improves a lot on existing features. 
It'll charge from one of them, not both.
If I had to guess, you'll be okay. From the videos I've seen, the home 'button' is very forgiving, and you can swipe it from a decent distance up.
Best of luck. Please don't pre-order from a carrier ever again.
What happened?
Makes sense, thanks!
Is there any haptic feedback when swiping up to go home?
I would get to the checkout screen on ATT Next, then cancel the IUP and see what happens.
I assume you can cancel but the hard credit pull won't go away. 
I _believe_ you've gotta restore your phone from a backup, but I could totally be wrong.
If you get it redirected to a customer center you'll be fine.
I'm sure you'll have a better experience on iOS. I don't play many games on my phone so I can't accurately answer your question though. 
True.
I would assume those are the people who were unable to get it on Nov. 3rd.
Most applications support a left to right swipe to go back, but theres always a button at the top. You'll figure everything out within the first 30 minutes.
I wouldn't mess with trying to down-grade, and I don't think the Apple Watch can be down-graded anyways. 

Just install the profile on the X.
Expectations when switching to iOS? Once you set everything up, it'll just work.

Edit: _Compared to Android, it'll just work._
Can you explain a little further? Are you referring to the iPhone Upgrade Program?
Are you talking about official Apple cables? It could be the power brick.
Totally agree there should be a way to force a message to be silent. I assume that Apple is worried people will accidentally start doing it, and then complain iMessage isn't working.
I was hoping you weren't going to take a /r/conspiracy twist on this post. 

Unfortunately, the iPhone 6 came out in 2014. We all want Apple to continue to innovate their hardware and software, not one or the other. Software will continue to demand more and more from the hardware. Would you prefer if Apple took the route that many Android manufactures do and not update their devices often once they're released? 

You can call this 'planned obsolescence' or whatever you would like.
I think eventually he would have settled on the notch, but it would have been a battle. Even without Steve, Apple has continued to innovate and push the market in a positive direction. 
Maybe a black keyboard.. but I've enjoyed having a wallpaper ever since iOS 4.
I'm just trolling you, best of luck.
Pixel 2 is ugly, and Pixel 2 XL has screen issues. If you are truly having issues with your iPhone 6, I would reset it and start from scratch.

While this is a cool idea, wireless charging is wildly inefficient. 
You should reset your phone. The iPhone 7 is only a year old, and I've had no issues with mine. 
Oh boy. Same. 
This still works..

3D Touch the music icon, tap the song.
Are you sure? 
A couple minutes makes sense, as your phone reconnect to WiFi, LTE and miscellaneous services. 

You'd need more evidence that someone called you even though your phone was on to prove there was an issue. 

Why turn it off at night? 
Unfortunately, it's not why. 
Let me get this right. 

You want a feature to not need to swipe up to unlock. 

But, you also want a feature to automatically show the notification without unlocking, meaning you'd need to swipe up to unlock. 
Are you asking why your phone doesn't ring when it's off..?
You're good.
I think it's totally a personal decision. If I want to risk needed to pay to get the screen / back replaced, that's up to me.
They wouldn't be able to do anything for shock absorption. The outside would still be damaged. They continue to add more hardware year after year. 

I won't be putting a case on my phone. 
You're right, that's why they're thicker. But it doesn't change the fast they obviously aren't focusing on thinness. 
No wireless charger will give you speeds of the fast charging via a wall outlet. 
While I agree there's a point where they shouldn't focus on thinness, I think we're already seeing that. This generation iPhone are thicker than the last. 

Also, the iPhone 6 bent due to a flawed material choice, and was rectified the next year. 
Most of your internet traffic is download. 
Force touch along the left side of the phone and push slightly to the right.
Ah. Gotcha. 
No problem! 
You need to login to UPS and create a MyChoice account. 
Absolutely update. 
Any app that uses the Touch ID for authentication will automatically adapt Face ID as well because of Apple’s API. 
When I upgraded to the 7 from the 6S I downloaded the newest public beta while still in store then restored it from backup. Wasn’t too big of a hassle. 
If you download the beta on the X, yes. 
Because this is something you'll never have to do.
In a little more constructive and nicer way, I agree.
I've heard you can just call them, complain, and they'll waive it.

Once it ships, the order page will update. No one's has updated yet - don't worry.
If you ordered through Apple, once the phone ships and they provide you a tracking number you can pre-sign and leave the form at the door.
If you write to the company and attach pictures they should either refund you or send another one. These cases cost them pennies to produce.

I guess. 
He incorrectly mentions that the X has a 120hz panel. 
The notch isn't the issue, it's the new screen size. 
I totally see what you're saying and was just looking into this as you posted that. I'm going to buy the 50GB for $0.99/mo iCloud storage to pull this off this time around.
>As much as I’m sure there is no tech backing to this, I still feel as if there is more to get wonky (technical term) by restoring from a back up. That’s all I’m going to say about that.

I couldn't agree more. A common bug fixer is to start all over. I can only imagine that restoring backups that were originally created in 2013 would bring issues eventually.
How do you comfortably use the mouse up there?
You can install the profile on the X then restore. 
You’re fine. It’s an issue with retailers in general. 
As you continue to pay for the 7 you will have eventually paid the full price of the phone. 
I’ve had the exact same thing for weeks now. 
I wouldn't hide Safari, when she clicks a link from a text or whatnot it'll open in Safari and she'll end up split between Chrome and Safari.
They will be instructed to hold it until Friday.
They'll require a signature, but you can pre-sign for it once it ships. If you've ordered through Apple, the order status page will have an option for it once it's shipped.
If you're on the fence about it, then don't do it. You'll have a lot of buyers remorse. While we could give you reasons to upgrade all day long, what matters is if you want to. 
Because while the screen is taller, its being used by the status bar and home 'button' area.
Where did you order it from?
You should head over to /r/jailbreak. I don't think anyone here can or will help you with that issue.
I'm not sure when it'll be officially lifted, but I would guess by Wednesday we'll start seeing some more reviews.
How?

Screen vs non-plus model.
That might just be when he's getting the phone.
How consistent is FaceID when used properly?
It will be automatic. Developers just reference an Apple provided API for authentication. As long as Apple doesn't break the API, everything should be good. 
If I wasn't able to pre-order for Nov. 3rd I was going to show up at like 5AM the morning of. Granted I'm not in a crazy area such as LA.
No. 

/r/jailbreak might be able to help you out.
Just hold that button combination until the phone turns off, then turn it back on. I'm not sure _exactly_ what it does, but its known as a hard reset for a reason.
I would think you have 14 days to return it, but I doubt a silver model will come in stock within those 14 days, so I hope you've got a backup.
I believe you can pay the remainder, then the phone is yours to sell.
I don't see why anyone thought this was a controlled leak. She's only got a few thousand subscribers. 
Did you restart it with Power + Volume Down?
I think it's the aspect ratio that brings the diagonal screen size closer to the Plus. You're basically right, it's a tiny bit wider than the 7.
If they've got it in stock, then yes. 
Keep in mind that the actual screen size is very close to the Plus. I'm sure it'll take some getting used to, but in the long run will be better.
I think Apple Maps has come a long way since it's inception. In the years that I've been using it, it's only mislead me once. Furthermore, it's got great integration with the rest of the features in the OS. 
I would volume down + power button reboot it.
The 5 was definitely a better designed 4.
We're still in a weird spot in the transition to USB-C. I think they should bundle either a small Type A to Type C, or a Type C to Type A adapter in the box. 
The last time I had a battery case was for the iPhone 5S. I only used it a handful of times throughout the year, and when I needed it, it came in handy. If I knew I was going to have a long day away from an outlet, then I'd put my phone into it in the morning and sure enough, it would save me later in the day. It added a ton of extra bulk, but wasn't really an issue for once in a while use.

That being said, I didn't own a battery case for my 6S, 7, and don't plan to for the X. 
Same. 
Sweet. Thanks for checking it out. 
It'll be the tax, and upon delivery, the first month's fee.

You can’t move a new version backwards, but you could install the beta profile on the X then recover. 
It has nothing to do with your carrier. 
I’ve had the same thing. 
And how you want to pay.
Software has bugs. Bugs are not equal to planned obsolescence.

/r/conspiracy is leaking.
This is a total guess, but because you're not associating it with the ATT plan, you can ship it wherever you like. If the payments were attached to the ATT plan then it probably has to go home.

I️ just did it right from the App Store on top of the existing OS. Once I️ recovered from my issue I️ waited a few weeks and tried again, no issues. 
Not the most elegant word choice, but it absolutely was 'boning' computers. My install attempt ended with it saying the file system was corrupt, and I had to boot into recovery to get Sierra to boot normally.
Mom upgraded to the iPhone 8 on via IUP a few weeks ago, at the time my IUP eligibility said I was eligible for an upgrade, also via IUP but was going to wait for the iPhone X.

I could see that happening. While Apple gets hate for being late to the party, and 'copying' other products, they get their iteration right. They consistently sell a boat-load of products, and as long as their current trend continues, there isn't anything stopping them.

There’s a third party keyboard for converting handwriting to text.. but I don’t know why you’d use it. 
I’m not sure I even understand your question. But the answer is no. 
If you’ve got a Pro and you want a stylus do yourself a favor and shell out the $100 for the Pencil. 
You may have lost money but how would this take your account overall negative? 
It will literally be like using the computer that your VNCed into. 
No screen protector. Not going to sacrifice screen quality - if it gets a little hairline scratch then it gets a little hairline scratch, oh well. 
😝
I had the same thing, hard reboot it, turn on low power mode, and plug it in and let it charge to 100. 
I don’t think it was ever hundreds of thousands of megabytes.. 
Go home, pick up the app you want to add, double tap home button, place the app over it and release it.  I do think Apple needs to better think this one out. 
I think you should think about how much you really want or need an iPad. An iPad mini is really not in the same ballpark use case wise as a full sized iPad. 
Because that’s not how to do multitasking in iOS 11. 
That’s irrelevant. He’s saying to clean the port on the iPad. 
Number 5 is a formatting issue I believe. 

Everything else seems reasonable I guess - but is very centered around an external keyboard. 
Weird 
That might be your explanation. Try deleting Reddit and reinstalling. 
Did you by any chance restore from a backup when you setup the iPad? 
[This](https://m.imgur.com/sKYKXWg?r) is mine. 
I don’t notice that for Reddit. 

The battery was how I could tell originally but that was on Spotify where it is very obvious. 
For example: Reddit, MS Office apps, Netflix, you already said Notability. 

From what I can tell, Spotify and HBO Go are the only ones I have that scale. 
I should have added when I get home and _if I remember_. 
When I get home later today and look through and try to find a few popular ones. 
This has happened to me. I think it’s when you start using the Pencil too quickly after using a multitouch gesture. Just try to give it a half second after moving to use the Pencil. 
You’re just using the wrong apps 😀 
Ah, gotcha. I’d just go with Apple’s official one then. People love it, and it’ll be hard to find something with more shortcut keys because you’re already tight on space. 
Not everything upscales. Spotify is the obvious one for me that does though. Just give it some time and developers will fix it. 
If you’re using your iPad for strictly desk work, get a full sized Bluetooth keyboard. 
You asked two separate questions. For me, it works well enough for a daily driver. Is it as snappy at iOS 10? Not quite. 
/r/titlegore 
This isn’t Apple just being Apple and having silly restrictions. Building a compiler for multiple different languages on top of iOS is no small effort. 
No. Not in the way you’d want it. It’ll SSH into a remote machine just fine, but so can a web browser on any device. 
You’ll learn the basics of programming sure. You won’t learn about using or deploying said program. 
We’re not fortunate to be on the beta. Most of us are using a profile that we found online. 
IT WAS NEVER GONE. 
It's beta 2. Not the GM.. 
I’d recommend dropping to $0.99. A full featured art studio app (Procreate) is $5.99. People are a lot more likely to purchase something for a dollar than something that stands out pricing wise. 
You won’t see a sale. You _might_ see a bundle. 
There is definitely an improvement. 
Wouldn’t it never happen because the JVM won’t run on iOS..? 
Just get the 256. The anxiety of filling up 64GB is too much. 
There is no need. Screen protectors are better suited for a phone that is constantly sliding in and out of a pocket and coming in contact with all sorts of grime. When I’m not using my iPad I flip the Smart Cover back over and it’s good to go. 
This just reloads the App Store. Don’t get too excited. 
Get it - if you need it. 
The inside has a felt feeling to it, the outside cover is a rubbery plastic, and the case part is a textured plastic that is decently grippy. 
[This one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07175N8XP/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_3U-rzbGG9ZHA1) works pretty well for me. 
Sure, get an iPad for notes. But don't expect to do any programming on it seriously. 
Not currently, no. 
Isn't OLED with 120Hz hard to pull off properly? That's why we don't see many OLED gaming monitors, if any. 
A lot of I-5 is 70. GPS could be the wrong one. 
It was never removed.. 
The magnetic force presses the reset button on the camera. 
This is an iPad sub, so I might be biased and you might get bias recommendations here - but I’d recommend the iPad. The Surface is a great device but the iPad has executed the ultra-portable, ultra-useable tablet perfectly with the iPad Pro 10.5. Combined with the Pencil, it’s probably the perfect device for a designer deciding between the two. 
>won’t update to iOS 9 because it ruins iPad 2

Part of the problem is running an old iOS version. Sounds like it’s already a bad experience, why not update it. 
As long as you’re 100% confident that you won’t download games or media - 64GB should be fine. 
If you're going to take notes on an iPad, you've gotta commit to it and get the Pro. The Apple Pencil is leaps and bounds better than using a capacitive stylus on a regular iPad.
I don't think that is true. It adds more thickness to the display, which is laminated to make it as thin as possible. 
I'm all for people using screen protectors, but you pay a lot of money for a beautiful screen. Why cover it with a cheap piece of glass or plastic?
I think it's the same glass panel, the best thing you can do is to wipe down the screen before you start drawing on it. 
You don't need to use a screen protector.
It's also a cable. You need a USB-C to Lightning - which is also sold separately.
If it's not an app for iOS, the answer is no. 
Interesting theory - but the only time I've felt my iPad getting warm at all is when it's charging. 
While I'm not a lefty, the palm rejection is outstanding.
A big part of the iPad Pro selling point is the ability to use the Apple Pencil. Maybe I misspoke by saying it’s a must have - but I think for 95% of iPad Pro owners, it’s a must have. 
Thanks!
It doesn’t look _bad_ but it’s obvious when it scales. Annoying that a lot of popular apps don’t use Apple’s auto scale, but I don’t think it’ll take long to get some updates. 
The Pencil is definitely a must have. The keyboard maybe not so much though. 
_Private Safari_ ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
MyScript Memo maybe? They have a keyboard app that works pretty well. 
Cool, I assume the iPad sleeve is similar? On the sleeve it looks like the end where the Pencil goes will flap around. 
 Love my iPad. But Phil Spencer is right. The market that the Xbox and PlayStation cater to is not the same market that the iPad caters to. 
Same here. I’m glad to hear others have this issue as well. 
Is it sturdy when there’s no Pencil in there? Like is the back of it thick enough to stop it from flexing.
Well if you can search them then it’s gotta be converting it somewhere - it’s just a matter of if you can see it somewhere. 
If you were - for example - my grandmother, who only uses a computer for checking her email and keeping up with her family on Facebook, the iPad is perfect, if not better than a desktop. 

Take it up a notch to a student, who uses a computer for the above as well as typing their papers, reading textbooks, and doing research. The iPad could potentially be a good replacement. 

But that’s about as far as it goes. For the rest of us, the iPad may _complement_ their main computer very well, but it hasn’t and won’t replace it for now. 
I’ll add to what everyone is saying already. Procreate. Hands down. I’m a terrible artist and can’t draw if my life depended on it, but I bought the Apple Pencil and Procreate anyways because of how enjoyable it is. 
I’ve never used the 12.9” and I’m not good at drawing but I bought Procreate because, why not. The app feels nearly perfect. Plenty of room on the 10.5” to draw. 
I’ve said it before - having the time be hidden behind and action would be idiotic. 
As long as there's not other damage I'm sure they will replace it no questions asked.
I'm sure it has some effect on color accuracy. You can watch the screen tint as you turn it on, so it must do _something_. 

I think if you're a graphics professional you'd want to leave it off. 
[Procreate](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/procreate-sketch-paint-create/id425073498?mt=8)
It is not included, but is well worth the price. It adds a whole new layer of interaction. 

It’s the same Pencil from before. 
The biggest factor hands down was the 120Hz refresh rate. It’s unbelievably beautiful to look at. 

Is it worth it? Not sure. 
I opted for the 256GB 10.5”. 

I was looking at a $649 investment, thinking that the last thing I’d want was to be regretting the 64GB a month from now. So I spent the extra $100 to make sure I’d have enough room. 

I highly advise that if you have the spare change for an iPad that you save an extra $100 to get more storage. 
I don’t use one. Pencil works fine with them, but a matte protector will most likely wear down the tip faster. 
I got [this](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07175N8XP/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_9BvqzbHQKTHVA). Fits my 10.5” great and has a nice texture on the back. 
Good luck! 
I _believe_ that iOS 11 will provide this functionally in the default Notes app. I could be wrong though.
I may have misunderstood - maybe most drawing apps have too much post processing to smooth lines maybe? If you want a drawing app, I’m not sure what to recommend then. But for notes have you tried Notability to see if the latency is there? 
I would try to test it against another iPad maybe. I may be biased but in my experience the latency is very low and the Pencil is very accurate. 
Procreate. Well worth the one-time $6 fee. 
I can’t describe it. I moved from 60Hz to 144Hz monitors for my desktop a few months ago. That was a massive change. 

But something about seeing the 120Hz on the iPad was a game changer. Animations are amazingly smooth and reading text while scrolling is great. I didn’t realize how bad I wanted a higher refresh rate on a mobile device - but I do. It makes the experience so much more enjoyable and I hope we see the high refresh rate on the next iPhone.

_Harvard, “Cheaper than prison!”_
Isn’t there plenty of extra latency with Duet Display.. I don’t see how you’d game with that. 
I’m sorry I don’t have a source - but in a review I read, the author said that the iPad almost fit better with a case on. 
FaceTime _audio_. 
/r/thatpeelingfeeling
They’re the best Apple product you’ll buy. 
Good thing I use a full screen app maybe once for every hundredth time a use a regular app. 
There’s no way the clock will be hidden behind an action. 
Why did you like sealing envelopes so much? 
You just summed up what a business is. 
No.. but the Touch ID is a selling point.
The i7 gives you hyperthreading - which isn't quad core, but it's a significant increase in performance over the i5.
120hz is not the reason we get HDR.
And that's why only the Touch Bar version has it.
I don’t understand the hype of the Files app. It doesn’t add very much new functionality and is _far_ from an actual file explorer. 
From Apple's point of view they want some level of consistency. But I would really like to fully customize it. I only use half the amount of customizable buttons I want to because I still want to be able to easily reach the media controls at the top with a single hand.
Genuine question - why are we assuming Apple is shifting away from their typical release cycle by having a redesign when we should be due for a 7s 'refresh'.
Sorry - should have read your post. 
It’s not “dark mode”. And: Beta. 
That’s the only _end-user_ difference. 
Works totally fine. 
As far as betas go I’m having a great time. Few crashes, laggy animations, I _feel_ like the battery life is worse but I’m also using it more. 
They did not do it. This is just when playing videos, it’s moved from bottom left to top right. 
No it doesn’t. 
It’s not fully customizable. 
You and all the rest of us will have to wait until December to see. 
I would say that's not the issue. When video plays it's always been in the video controls anyways.

Auto-brightness is enabled. System Preferences > Keyboard > Uncheck "Auto adjust for low light", something like that.
The screen taking over the space where the sensors / earpiece is will definitely not happen. It would look _horrendous_.

Because Unity does it all for you. 
A debit card is a straight forward withdraw from your bank account. Credit cards will spend money that you potentially don't have up until your approved credit limit. If you don't pay the credit card at the end of the month, expect a nice hit from the interest rate. With that being said, credit cards usually have rewards programs, and other benefits of being a card holder, such as insurance on purchases, etc. Credit cards can be dangerous if you start spending money you don't have.

I think the weirder thing is the start menu search is way faster, almost instant. I think it's because it indexes every file. Don't know why explorer can't have the same functionality.

I would 100% change your first priority to 144hz
If you happen to have an EVGA 1080, you could possibly take advantage of their Step Up program.
I mean that best case is the PSU is fried. Sucks, but better than the entire thing being broken. I suggest trying to find a friend that has a PSU and try it on your computer. If it turns on fine, then you've either gotta get a new PSU or steal your friends.
Pray that its the PSU and get a loaner to test it.
What size are you shooting for? And M.2 or SATA?
Hmm, well I'm no expert, but something's gotta be up with the GPU, or something. Hopefully someone sees this an can help more.
Is there another computer you can try the monitor with? What monitor is it?
I'm sure you checked the monitor input, right?
I think the Fury is more around the 70-75% mark. The 1070 could stand a little bit of a price drop, but right now there isn't the competition to force it to. 
Sorry - companies like EVGA or MSI, who attach their coolers to Nvidia or AMDs graphics cards. 
I wouldn't be too upset. I doubt you as a consumer will see much of these price cuts. Especially buying third party cooler cards.

Looks like the 1080 will be $499 and the 1070 $349. 
These things were this price a little bit after Black Friday, caved and go them. Not disappointed.
Don't rush through it, take your time, and enjoy it.
I think you'd need something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Maeline-Female-Plated-Headphone-Splitter/dp/B00PYZ2BT4/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1488099363&sr=8-3&keywords=3.5mm+audio+splitter), although I'm pretty sure it merges the Left and Right channels into Mono. 

Edit: That actually probably isn't what you're looking for.
I've had that happen to me too, I cant remember if I just restarted or ended that process. If you end it I'm pretty sure you'll loose sound, but a restart should fix it.
144hz and 60hz is the difference between the lights on, and the lights off. It will change your life.
I'd get yourself some sort of different CPU cooler, Something like the Hyper 212 Evo is fairly inexpensive, and _should_ be quieter. 
Go check Task Scheduler and see what the last task to wake up was.
What monitor are you using? The Asus VG248QE sometimes has this issue, and needs to be unplugged from the wall and restarted.
Nice! Do you have two PC's there?

IPS will give far superior colors, but usually will come with some input lag, in this example, 5ms. Most TN displays will be 1ms. Of course low response time is better, but IPS monitors are and have been used for gaming just fine.
That's a 1440p monitor.

Thank you for your help!

EDIT: Cable Matters is sending a free replacement. 
Yes, I have two VG248QE, both on DisplayPort. That's an interesting point. Before yesterday I had one on DP and one on DVI-D.

I don't have any experience with less than a full-key layout, but the Blackwidow Tournament Edition is commonly referred to as an 87-key keyboard, so maybe that will help your search? 

If you don't want the arrow keys, I think its something like a 61-key keyboard.

But obviously it would run out of juice eventually.

I would agree, except even after unplugging the PSU nothing changes.
Please do, then naturally it'll go up for me.

MSI's website shows that this board does have a nice & easy to navigate BIOS. As for XMP, /u/jamvanderloeff has your answer.

EDIT: Don't take my word for it, but the memory should still work, as it will underclock. Can anyone confirm?


Higher price either means more features and/or higher quality. I think with a name brand like MSI, the $60 price point just means lack of features. Which as long as you're okay with, should be perfectly fine. 

I have an MSI Z97 Krait, I think I payed a bit over $100 for it, and it has been perfect for me.
