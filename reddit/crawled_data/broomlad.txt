Haha. Did you draw that blue arrow before or after the picture was taken? 🤣
Your story surprises me - I've always given my old landlords my forwarding address / contact information after moving out.  I thought that was standard (if not actually required by law).
It's not a hidden amount.  I had my first experience with equal billing over the last two years with Union Gas up north; they adjust how much they charge you twice a year - before the summer months, and then again before the cooler months.  That way you're not over-paying for what you're using in the summer, or under-paying in the winter.  

I haven't yet signed up for equal billing for Hydro Ottawa so I don't know if they do that, but it sounds like they don't - they just adjust at the end of the year.  

Their equal payment is based on a yearly average, and they need to "true up" at the end of the year based on what you actually used.  

So if you paid $100 in a month but you used $300, and that continues through the year, at some point they need to make up that amount of money that you haven't paid for yet.
The Mr. Lube in Sudbury does this very well.  I say "The" meaning there is only one.  

They keep track of which cars arrive first and queue them up accordingly.
> possibility for a mistake at the 3rd spot. 

Let's be fair, any draft pick can be considered a "mistake" at any spot, even number 1.
You're going to have a tough time finding something at that price - we are renting our place for $1600 and it has almost everything you list except for the fenced in back yard.  And not in the west end.  

Most of the 3 bedroom townhomes I've seen lately start at $1500.  

Your best bet honestly to get something in that price range would be Minto.  Look into South Centrepointe (aka Craig Henry).  
Try Make Dad Read Comics. Not exactly a book club but Patrick and his Dad Read a large spectrum of books. It's a great podcast. 
I don't have any great tips but a lot of it has to do with shot composition. In other words, how you're framing the subject of the photo, lighting (natural or otherwise), etc.  I think lighting is half the battle no matter what camera you're using. 

I mostly use my camera on auto, but you could probably get some interesting results of you use Samsung's camera modes for specific situations (like the food camera, or if you're doing a close up shot - selective focus is great). 

Pro mode also gives you ultimate control over the shot. I'm not the greatest with it but you can learn a lot by playing with the pro mode. Look up some articles about how to manipulate different settings from ISO to Aperture to shutter speed, and play with your phone. 

Hope this helps!
Okay, so that was helpful in my case. We were having trouble finding a place. 
Don't know that store, assuming it's US. I'm in Canada. 
Try finding a real estate agent that can see rental listings that aren't listed elsewhere (such as Kijiji).  We just found our house that way.  

Other than that though, I will be honest, we were lucky to be able to stay at my parents' while we were house hunting.  We essentially didn't bother looking while we were still outside the city, because we couldn't go view anything.
Unless Pierre Dorian is a different meme I'm unaware of, you actually mean Pierre Dorion.
Good idea re: sports stores!
Just a quick question about running; I think I may need to start jogging with my dog (she still has some leash training to master, so I'm not *quite* there yet) to burn off all her energy.  

What kind of shoes should I be looking at?  I'm definitely not a jogger or runner at all.  

I may just consider longer walks but am curious about shoes.
Unrelated - since you have been helpful with other suggestions, do you know how to get back to the default white/orange theme?  I've played around with some other themes - I like the default but don't know how to get back to it (it doesn't seem to be listed in the themes) if I don't like what I'm playing around with.
I was wondering what the advantage was to loading in person. Wasn't sure if it was immediate or not. Thanks!
> 24-48 hours or something to load.

Unless passes are different, it's max 24 hours.  It's sometimes shorter depending on when the presto systems are refreshed.
I was using a most recent version.  I thought I might have seen this option but I couldn't remember.  I'll check it out again.

would still be nice to mark individual messages as read.  I think I understand why clicking on the notification doesn't mark it as read - it brings me to the comment context rather than the message inbox, which makes sense from a user perspective.  

If there was a way to make it mark it as read too that'd be great.
Thanks! Hadn't seen that article. That's slightly disappointing but I totally get it.
I understand but if they already have the same price there's nothing to match it to.

Edit to clarify: price matching is for when an item at another store is **cheaper** than the store you're at.
What you're saying makes no sense. If everywhere else is offering the same deal, there's nothing to price match.
I haven't tried it yet, but my brother's wife's sister (is that still an in-law at that level?) got hers done at 4 My Auto on Canotek for $150. Planning on doing the same.
Look into OSSC. They cater to your age group big time with all the sports you mentioned.
Thanks everyone for the advice. I appreciate it. Already trying some different things with her - getting mixed results. I'm trying to keep my cool :-)
I get what you're saying, but if I were to give her back shoes for instance, she would chew them and destroy them. 
Thanks! I'll have a look. For what it's worth, she's really good with leave it when it comes to food. Proud of her progress with that, at least.
Almost seems like QR / that awesome RFID system would work better. But as for autoweb - the path for the API call seems to be incorrect. I had to register to see the full API call path, so I think that's probably why the autoweb service no longer works. 
That's amazing. Me, I would have either printed it out or tried tracing. Definitely do not have a steady hand. 
Maybe Samsung changed their built in filter for the SO, I don't know...but on my s7 edge I have the option for the filter to be on at sunrise/sunset built in.

Yeah not expecting this to be a perfect system ;-) 

I was testing the barcode read on some CDs at my parents and a Gordon Lightfoot CD came up with a completely incorrect reading. It was still a CD but nothing close to what it should have been. Quite amusing. 
> I have automated the process to access my bank app using my fingerprint.

Care to elaborate on this one a bit?  My banking app doesn't allow fingerprints for logging in, would be neat to be able to do this.  I'm assuming it's based on when the banking app is open - then what?  Is there a plugin that "listens" for fingerprints?
Following up with ya...did you have issues getting AutoWeb / EAN database checking to work?  I haven't had any luck with it.  However I've figured out how to check the EAN database using AutoTools JSON Read so that should work out fine.
Pursuant to my thread yesterday (scanning CD barcodes and finding in Spotify), I've got something set up with Barcode Scanner + Autoweb to search the EAN database.  

However I can't seem to get the EAN database to tell me anything, using some basic stuff for testing: a Grand & Toy Highlighter, and a pack of Ruffles All Dressed chips.  

When I scan, I have it set right now to give me the product name (`%name`).  Currently, it just flashes `%name` so clearly it's not returning the information correctly.  

Am I doing something wrong?  I can share the task in a bit, just busy right now.  

**Edit:**

I couldn't get the API action in Autoweb to work, so I tried a different method and used AutoTools JSON Read.  I was able to test the barcode scan out on a highlighter at my desk and got it to correctly display product info.  

In order to properly test it I needed to get my own free API key - the only limit is how often you can check the database.  Head to http://www.eandata.com/feed/ for more details.  

I'm still working on this project - don't have a CD handy to figure out what info I get from scanning one or trying to combine with looking up in Spotify yet.  
Bankers boxes only if they're not the cheap ones. They're not the sturdiest boxes. 
For free?  McDonald's, any department store.  

Dymon sells boxes, as does UHaul I imagine.  

Edit to add: Canadian Tire sells boxes as well, and you can get some smaller shipping boxes from Staples.  Canadian Tire boxes are good, they have useful handles.

> I'll lay out a decoy sock 

Before we moved, we would save up socks that had holes in them for exactly this purpose.  Our dog loves socks no matter the level of cleanliness.  

We have yet to move to our new house (we're staying somewhere temporarily) so no "decoy socks" as of yet, we threw them all out before we moved ;) 
$50 for the pair? I've never been to the Lansdowne theatre - is that basically just the going price for VIP tickets or are there other extras added to the tickets? I.e. 3D, etc. 

Not really interested in spending $50 on a pair of movie tickets, more just curious what the ticket gets you. 
What I'm hearing is abandon my plans to try Skip the Dishes tonight.
Yeah I was just poking fun, no hard feelings :) 

I stand by my recommendation of posting on Kijiji though.
Haha yeah that's true, this is being produced by Sportsnet (I believe) so understandably there's a Blue Jays focus.
Putting this in separately because it's related only in that it's a podcast rec for baseball: 

pr0ductive Outs.  It's a siller podcast and not so serious about the game, but these guys are good.  Two of the Thrice members host this show.
I listen to this one too.  Less about baseball by the numbers, and more about the people behind baseball.  

I wouldn't describe Shulman as a Jays fan first though - while he did grow up in Toronto he was most recently an ESPN national broadcaster.  He has tons of access to people in the game, and usually interviews players / coaches as they come through Toronto (or as he goes through if he is on road trips with the team).  

The most recent one I heard had a fantastic interview with John Gibbons.  His CC Sabathia interview was great too!
Hence "short term answer" in my reply.
To an uneducated person (about real estate), on the surface that seems to be the short term answer, to create more inventory. 
> (All the **basic** store **needs**: **Alcohol, Fast food**, Groceries, Hardware, etc.)
(emphasis mine)

I wonder about OP's priorities but I don't judge them.  

Seriously speaking have you posted on Kijiji at all?  I'm sure there would be quite a few people looking.
For what it's worth, I tried using old.reddit.com to login.  Didn't work.

So I logged out, made sure in Edge I selected the old design, cleared all my history etc. in Chrome, and logged in again - and it gave me the old design.
NSV - coworker commented today that I was looking trim, and asked what I was doing. Cool, I hadn't thought that of myself so nice to hear :-) 
I've tried logging into [old.reddit.com](https://old.reddit.com) or [og.reddit.com](https://og.reddit.com) in Chrome and just keep getting a login error.  

Seems to work fine in Edge, though.  I should probably try to remember that going forward.
Copies of IDs? Gotta be honest, if we already have the other info not sure why a landlord needs a copy of my photo ID...
Further observations...I have to use Edge to view my messages \(both modmail and inbox\) because they don't work in Chrome.  

But if I want to reply / post, the buttons don't work in Edge.  I can only comment/reply in Chrome.
The two on Sunday were both in Kanata South \- Stonehaven area.  The one coming up this weekend is in Barrhaven, I believe it's in Half Moon Bay.  Would need to look it up.  

For context as well, these aren't big houses they're holding the open houses for.  One was a 3\-storey terrace home \(one of those row houses that have a driveway \+ garage, but no yard\), and the other was a townhouse.  The latter was really nice but we didn't happen to snag that one :\( 
I went to two separate open houses for rentals this weekend, and know of another one coming up this weekend for another house we were looking at (rent date is a bit later than we'd like so might not go to it, but at this point...we're not being picky).
You're not the only one further behind with the savings.  Life happens differently for some people.  Even 5&#37; down on some house prices is quite a lot to reach if you don't start saving early enough \(which, I suspect, we're in the same boat and I didn't\).
I'm looking for a house to rent and one of the more frustrating things we're coming across is people doing open houses for rental properties.  This seems like a new thing and it makes it difficult \(I think\) to secure a place.  Do you know if this is something that's going to become the norm?  I certainly hope not.
Nice, like the flat look to it. I feel like a lot of watch faces go for a 3D look but they end up not looking so good. 
1 week seems like a really short period.  For example, I just recently moved but am not in a permanent address yet.  I'm expected to change to my temporary address immediately, and then again when I do find my permanent place of residence?

Edit: Turns out you are correct.  [https://www.ontario.ca/page/change\-address\-drivers\-licence\-vehicle\-permit\-and\-health\-card](https://www.ontario.ca/page/change-address-drivers-licence-vehicle-permit-and-health-card) 6 Days, and health card is within 30.
You have to change your address on your registration papers \- this is where I assume they would charge the difference, if they were to do that.  

I'm curious about it myself since I paid for two years on both our vehicles in NO for this reason \($120 for two years\).  Haven't updated my registration yet since we haven't found a permanent residence as of yet.
That's correct.  Technically you can file without receipts, esp. if you're doing it electronically, but if audited you definitely need them for back-up.  

Edit: to clarify, we use Liberty Tax.  When claiming rent we would use cheque images and were told that's fine, but we would need an actual receipt from landlord as back-up in case of an audit.
Unfortunately you still need a receipt from the landlord in case the CRA needs proof, at least according to where I get my taxes done.
I'm perfectly happy to use the Tab S2 as a laptop replacement in a pinch.  For a few weeks it's what I was doing, using a micro USB OTG adaptor to attach a mouse.  It's a very versatile device.
Traditionally ignoring any previous comments and leaving my own complaints:  

* Clicking "go back to old Reddit" reloads the design \- would like to go back and forth while trying to learn the new design
* Clicking modmail loads the reddit main site with its own title bar \(menu, mail icons, etc.\) underneath the existing title bar
* Clicking on inbox icon generates the same behaviour

For what it's worth, I'm using Chrome.  Haven't tried Edge to see how it behaves.  

Edit: Edge seems to behave with intended results with the re-design.
Got a question about a specific plugin: [FeedWordPress](http://feedwordpress.radgeek.com/).  Short description of the plugin is that it checks RSS feeds and imports posts \(either as a link to the original item or as a native post\).  

Overall it works great for me.  However, for one site it imports my posts twice.  For a different blog, it imports properly, once.  I can't see any differences in settings that would indicate why it's importing a post twice.  

Has anyone else tried using this plugin and can offer insight?
Yeah, that's what I mean. Don't see the rose gold shade around the watch face personally. Just looks gold.
Starbucks in most places, probably.
Not seeing the rose gold colour but the peach looks good. Colours are colours.
Maybe I haven't received the update? My watch is running fine. Battery drain is pretty hefty only when I have AOD turned on but that's understandable. Otherwise my battery lasts quite a while.
Didn't see any mention of the Tab S2 getting Oreo. Not sure how old that device is but it's still super capable.
Thanks, looks pretty close to me!
I haven't tried, mainly because the only supported card I have is ScotiaBank - they're not really my main bank.
Also, unless you fiddle with region settings, Gear watches in Canada don't let you use Samsung Pay.
Not exactly what you're looking for because I haven't come across any myself, but one of the watch faces I bought - MD82 - has a music player icon that you could click on to bring you straight to the music page.

I was lamenting earlier that drivers weren't treating these intersections as a four way stop. I realize now that I was wrong - drivers are ignoring them just the same as stop signs. I must apologize to the other drivers out there.
Or you know, having ice from the CN Tower fall on them.
Our dog (passed away last April) used to get into trouble like this - he'd eat toilet paper, underwear, stuff from the garbage - you name it.  We didn't crate-train him so he had free reign of the house.  The way we got around this was closing off access to things we didn't want him to get into.  

Yeah, we forgot to close doors sometimes, we just paid the price (sometimes literally, when we had to buy more toilet paper sooner or new pairs of underwear).
I weigh myself every day; I *was* going to stop that and just weigh myself weekly, but I'm in the habit of it ;)  

You already know to expect fluctuations in your weight, so just remember that.  If you think you're going to have a specific problem with that, maybe stick a note somewhere near your scale to act as a reminder.  

You're logging food every day, right?  If you see your number go up and get frustrated / discouraged, take a look at what you ate the night before.  You might have an "oh yeah" moment.  Like, "Oh yeah, I did eat some salty foods, that's right."
372 Pages We'll Never Get Back; season 1 covered Ready Player One, and season 2 covered Armada.  I don't anticipate they'll be doing any additional books for the time being.
I'm not a fan of the gimmick; I think some people think they're being funny and edgy, while they end up just sounding stupid.
I enjoy Mission Log but they're covering episodes in order of air date (currently on season 1 DS9) so that might not be your bag.  They have a separate feed that is primarily devoted to Discovery, but talking about Trek in general during the off-season.  

Transporter Room 3 is also awesome if you're OK not being so serious about Trek.
Great reply, thank you.

I just looked up Vizlas, and I think potentially now I might have a Beagle / Vizla mix.  Thought she was Beagle / Boxer but after seeing a full Vizla, and doing an image search for beagle / vizla mix...resemblance is uncanny.  My dog is super high energy.  I think I need to do one of those dog DNA kits.  Haha!
Hijacking OP's post here ;) 

I'm still dealing with a young dog who is leash reactive (really, she just wants to go say hello but she growls and barks to signify that - not really the brightest).  We want to take her to get some obedience training because there are some things we just need help with.  Do you think being in a class with many other dogs is probably not a good idea?  She's mostly fine to sniff and greet the other dogs and people, it's just that she pulls and barks so hard to see them.  

At our local Petsmart they offer one-on-one sessions.  Better to go through one of these first?
>  But to now put all the good content on Patreon seems wrong to me since the content used to be free. I guess I am alone in that.

I think people are challenging you on this because podcasts don't put their regular content as paid-only, they put up additional content.  The free product is still there and the quality doesn't change.  

> But I’m not going to pay $5/month each for 10 different podcasts. And that’s ok. 

I'm with you there.  I only support one podcast via patreon right now.  I wouldn't do any more than that.  But the thing is, you don't *have* to pay / subscribe to Patreon to listen to a show.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not agreeing with OP in terms of being against podcasts monetizing.  I have zero issues with it.  

Mind you, I work in media for a living, and I can see that every avenue for generating revenue is going to be explored - it's harder and harder to get ads to eyeballs.  This is only tangentially related to the original post but just giving some background on my thoughts.
You're getting beat up for this opinion and that's not fair.  I think there are two sides to this.  

I think your feeling about things going behind a paywall is completely valid - there are a number of podcasts out there that have gone this route (whether completely subscription based or back episodes).  It's a strategy that's best followed that way from the beginning - definitely hurts when a previously free show is now not free.   

Where I (and many) disagree with you is your stance on offering new content behind a paywall.  Think of it this way: as I said in another post, they're creating this content to get people to join their patreon.  If they didn't have a Patreon page, they wouldn't have this new content (most likely).  

You could argue, "Well why do they need a Patreon page then?"  It does indeed cost money to produce a show.  Patreon is one of the easiest ways for listeners to support the show.  Offering new content that is Patreon-only is just another way to drive subscriptions.  

This isn't a new business model at all - there are plenty of services out there that provide perks based on paid subscriptions.  
I will point out that archive.org doesn't operate for free; they rely on grants and donations etc. to function.  One of the reasons why I stopped using them to host my own content and switched to a paid host.  I didn't want to leech off them anymore.
> This is not content you were getting before. You can still get the content you got before for free. The only thing funding the new content is the patreon. Without the patreon the new content wouldn't exist.

This is my feeling as well.  I understand feeling annoyed by patreon if they were to put their entire show, which was free before, behind a paywall, but there's nothing wrong with creating side content that can only be accessed by patreon supporters.  In fact, that's usually the incentive to offer for podcasts when creating a patreon.  

If they didn't offer incentive content behind a paywall, no one would feel any incentive to purchase it.  

Patreon as a model works better than offering one-off products to purchase, but that's a model some podcasts use as well.
> Toronto is a terrible comparison for Ottawa anyway

So I was originally the one to bring in the comparison to Toronto - I wasn't using it in terms of *who* comes to the games or how many, but *location* of the arena.  
sorry, I replied to the wrong person.  Cheers!
That's fair re: transportation, but you're presenting the arena as something that is SO FAR out of town when it's not.  It's in town.  Ottawa has grown and things take time to get to on either end of the city.  
> So let's have an arena 30 minutes out of town

That is an exaggeration.  30 minutes away from another part of town sure.  

Yeah, a city like Toronto has their arena downtown.  But I'm sure that there are parts of the city where it takes 30 minutes (at least) to get there while still being within Toronto.  
I would say 9 times out of 10 podcasters are not getting sued or shut down.  The medium just isn't that popular (yet).  

However, unless they have purchased rights or obtained permission from the artists to play these songs (or they are using creative commons licensed music), they are violating copyright law and are subject to legal action.  That legal action can vary, and will likely consist of a cease and desist before any courts are involved, but it's possible.  

If you're trying to infer that it's OK to use copyrighted material because nobody does anything about it, you could theoretically argue that you're a proponent of "stealing from a store is okay as long as you don't get caught".  That particular logic is a bit of a fallacy but just thought I would point it out.
> Question 1 was a loaded question for me.

The entire poll was loaded.  I didn't answer it as a result.
Haha yeah. I find it particularly hilarious that someone is complaining about being regionally locked out of a Canadian broadcast. Something we deal with all the time with US streams.
Agreed. 

Thinking now that Shadows of the Vampire + What We Do in the Shadows would make a great double feature.
It's easiest to send a modmail.
I enjoyed it as well!  Haven't caught up to the most recent episode so disappointed to find out it's coming to an end.  Ah well.  All good things...
I think you're right.  So I set it up as 3 major categories, but there are still a bunch of subcategories beneath those.  But that would make it easier to set up as 3 separate pages instead of well, more ;) 
Yeah, no reason I can't make subcategories.  I decided to do that right now.  


Ah ok.  Already using categories.  Perhaps what I need to do is focus them a bit more.  I have 21 categories (including uncategorized) - is that maybe too many? ;) 
> (yes fans actually use that as an argument that the movie is good) 

My argument for it being good is just my personal opinion, in that I enjoyed it, so therefore, it was good for me.  I don't really see it as setting up future films other than introducing new characters and giving existing characters an arc to follow through in future movies.  It stood on its own fine.
You probably want to check out the app Fit and Healthy ([Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jsonlo.fitandhealthy)).  Steps imported this way don't count toward competitions, etc. though.  
Not quite.  Story was (according to Dreger, I think?) that there was a trade in place, but while Dorion waited for clearance from Melnyk (standard procedure for GMs to get owner approval for trades), Chiarelli pulled the trigger with New Jersey instead.
Somebody read Ian Mendes' tweet.
He has a point, though.

I once watched Tim Horton's batch activate like 100 Tim Cards.  I imagine McDonald's has the same sort of process.  If you make a mistake you could wind up with a bunch of cards that didn't get activated / loaded with money.  

The optics are bad, sure, but hard to put all the blame on the Senators here.
It's actually YTV that is holding it back, for who knows what reason.  Likely they have other programming lined up and they don't have room for it until June.  

Edit: or they have a 10 week hole in June.
Definitely non-scale, but not sure I would quantify it as a "victory".  

I entered my calories today, which admittedly contained some estimations, and they wound up totalling my daily goal *exactly*.  

Now, I'm not *done* entering my calories, so I'm definitely going to exceed my calorie limit (will need to offset with some exercise, I guess?).  But I was amused, so I'll count it as a victory.
And he also makes sure to point out that there have been no studies that show CICO works or something along those lines.
The article is full of logical fallacies. The final bit of advice essentially works out to eating fewer calories and eating food that contain fewer calories but are better at satiating. In basic terms it's CICO but your just not counting it.
"other" sites you say ;-) haha I'm sure you're correct.
Thanks for posting these. I'm not sure if I want to wade into spoilers yet (Canada doesn't get the series until June, unfortunately).
No one is ruining your childhood. Are they in possession of a time machine?
That's OK - I am mainly comparing them in terms of I remember the 90's version being really cool.  I never read the entire series (I think I downloaded an ebook collection, haven't gotten through it yet), but thought the 2099 suit looked cool.  

I'm not disappointed with what I've read so far, I assure you.  I just started reading Out of Time, and thoroughly enjoyed the first issue.  Still don't know how Miguel got to 2014 but T.O.T.E.M. was a lot of fun.
Good luck.
Could you just manually record your sleep start/end times?  I'm not sure what you're trying to do here.
OK - so it's ultimately not terrible that I've read that one first.  

Other than the first issue in the collection being a *little* confusing, I think it did a pretty good job of catching me up / proceeding with the story.  
If you don't get many suggestions here, try asking on /r/loseit - there would probably be some podcast listeners in there.
Yeah, they're tricking the people coming to the games.  OK there.
Great framing with the 'self checkout' sign.
That is fantastic, I love it.  And I have watchmaker.

Do you have more?
Thank you for bringing your cynicism to an otherwise positive thread.
Thanks for sharing this.  I think it's refreshing to hear about people enjoying the game day experience.  I still enjoy going to the games.  

You hear too many people complain about the GDE but I figure that's coming from people who go to a lot of games and get the same thing game in, game out.  It's refreshing to hear that a person going to their first game can get a thrill out of it.  

OP, where were your seats?
Thanks for the head's up.  $59.99 in Canada for the complete series!  A comparable price.
SJ were in the 1991 draft weren't they?  

Anyway, Ottawa was one of the teams that helped shape the expansion draft to what it was for Vegas, primarily because of how the team fared in the inaugural season.
I have the premium version - I got a free year with my Samsung Gear S3.

Unfortunately I can't give you an extensive review - I'm currently on an "MFP Break" (I'm moving and all my measuring stuff is packed away, and yadda yadda yadda I'm making excuses right now).  

Things I like about the premium version, though:

- You can specify different Mon-Fri or Sat-Sun goals, which I've done  


Actually that's the biggest plus I can think of right now.  For my usage right now, I wouldn't pay for premium over the free version.  But like I said, I haven't really taken advantage of it.
> I just really wanted to know why none of these "broadcasters" have spoken up about it. 

Because they don't need to, really.  

There are probably a ton of shows that get shopped around that networks aren't interested in, and we never hear about it.

You're probably right about a kickstarter fund for something fan made, or not distributed to major networks, but that's not the way you get something on TV to a wide audience if that's your goal.
There are apparently workarounds that involve installing a different region or something - I haven't really looked into it too much because I'm getting along fine without Samsung Pay.  It's in the category of, "I wish I had it, but I can live without it."
What's the learning curve?  Nice watch face, btw.
Same.  I think that s/he might be talking about the part where OP said "...look at your habits and look at what you're doing/eating/tracking and really consider if tracking [everything] and overthinking about whta you eat is "healthy"..."

I didn't take it personally though.
You probably don't want any advice but I'll leave some anyway.  Have you tried at least writing down what you're eating?  You don't need to track calories, or nutrients, or portion sizes...just write down what you're eating.  It might help.  

Best of luck!
> The way the show is being set up, it's not just about technology or a device. It's how that device is utilized.

I hope that there are some elements of this actually in the show.  It doesn't seem that way from the trailers, though.  Granted this interview is from 3 years ago.
Agreed with /u/Jargen.  You can either choose to believe it or choose not to - unless other networks come out and confirm the statement, there's no way to corroborate the statement.  

There's probably a grain of truth in there somewhere, and then exaggerated out from there.
Reminds me of that one episode of The Critic where they change classic movies.
Country restrictions!!! Grr.
Fan made merchandise. Rianmaker recently started sending cease and desist notices.
Honest question - and I'm not trying to bring down your argument here. But would most viewers watching this show pick up on it that it's an iron lung? Most viewers being kids. 

I will admit that before seeing your tweet I wouldn't have recognized it as an iron lung. But that's just me.
I can't put any stock one way or another whether you have inside information with the actual producers of the show; I tend not to be very trustworthy of what people say online.  

It's fine if you're angry about the producers lying to you, specifically, about the show.  

Where I draw the line with your posts is your attitude toward things like a simple prop (which many others have pointed out is not uncommon for props to be made from real life items).  Or your anger about the company exercising their right to prevent people from infringing copyright to make money.  

You are also constantly ragging on the quality of the show itself when you haven't seen the final product (nor has anyone).  I don't really like the looks of it either, but I'm also recognizing that they're obviously not designing a show aimed at 34-year olds.  

I hope you aren't one of those people who make claims like "Oh, this has RUINED my childhood!" for things that do nothing to take away from the original product, which you can still watch at any time.  

I've been re-watching ReBoot, starting with season 1.  The first few episodes are poorly paced and have some funny animation problems going on.  In fact, the show didn't really get into its groove until the last half of the season, and season 2.  

Who knows - maybe they're going to do something interesting with TGC.  I certainly won't know until June, so I hope someone has a relatively objective review of the show when it comes out in the US this weekend.
I've said it before, but OP is being extremely unfair to the show and has been running a very lengthy campaign against them.  I don't disagree that this show looks bad in comparison to the original cartoon, but some of the posts and reactions to news about the show are way out there and very reaching.  

And if you even show an opposing view point in this sub you usually get downvoted.  Oh well.
Eh.  It's a pretty popular trope for shows like this.  Doesn't make it any less cringe-worthy, but this isn't the first show to do it.  

I looked up "recombinant" and this is the definition:

"relating to or denoting an organism, cell, or genetic material formed by recombination."  

So I guess Vera was always designed to have an organic body.  Why it's a teenager, I don't know.
Haha nice. I have the Frontier model so it feels somewhat glitch-like as it is. 

With the rotating bezel it's already very much like a keytool. I'm good with just seeing a watchface for the time being rather than a physical housing 🤣
Battery life indication for you.  On Friday I left my house for the weekend without my charger, and when I came back Sunday afternoon, I was at around 26%.  

Note that I turned it off Saturday night and didn't wear it.  

I also have a bunch of watch faces downloaded.  

As for when to charge it, I just charge it while I'm in the shower.  I charged it overnight last night to get it to 100%.  I don't think it's any more harmful than charging your phone overnight.  I usually wear my S3 overnight to track sleep.

I would say with confidence that my watch lasts me at least 3 days without needing a charge.
I'm okay with longer term for younger players like Stone. An 8 year deal for Turris would not be so good for example.

It is probably in Stone's best interests financially to sign a shorter deal though. You're right that most RFA's that aren't franchise players tend to sign shorter deals.
Really glossing over the list but I find it interesting that a lot of the actor-directed DS9 episodes are comedic or involve ferengi.
I think it's the 8 year term that makes it better for the Sens, really.
https://xkcd.com/1053/
That's a good question I'd like to see asked but as has been pointed out, the Sens are actually close-ish to the cap due to artificial means (like not putting MacArthur on LTIR).
I don't think that's true at all. Muckler was the GM at the time - I do not believe for a second that he was subservient to Melnyk (which in my opinion is one reason he was fired).
I can't speak to the OP's comment but actually I think it's the other way around. The potential ownership group in QC butt heads with Bettman, though I can't recall the specifics as to why. Similar to Belisille and his attempts to relocate a team to Hamilton.
I hope you don't think that a downtown arena will magically solve all of the issues the team faces. It scares me a little when so many fans seem to think that with the arena downtown, everything will be A-OK. 

The arena's current location is not as big a problem as people make it out to be. The infrastructure to get out there and back is much improved over when it first opened. And even though I said "out there" it's not that far to travel. 

I'm not saying they should stick with the CTC and not move downtown, just saying that a downtown arena isn't the answer to all of the franchise's problems.
Lately there hasn't been much SciFi but that's not a bad thing. He's picked good stories.
Yeah, it definitely doesn't fit with the rest of the movie.  But it's voiced by Jermaine Clement so I gave it a pass.
Yup, when I clear on one device it clears on the other.  From what I can tell the watch is basically mirroring the phone's notifications.
I wonder if maybe it could be a Doctor Who episode?
Yeah, I am fairly certain it wasn't star trek (but you never know - I'm not as familiar with Voyager or Enterprise) but I haven't seen enough Stargate to rule that franchise out haha.
Sounds more like star Trek or Stargate.
They definitely look a lot more stylized and made to fit with the rest of the animation.  

I noticed in the trailer that the overall CG animation looks very dark compared to how light season 1 was.  Looks to me like Dot's Diner is accurately rendered though?  Hard to tell from that shot.
I haven't seen any solutions. The problem hasn't resurfaced for me (yet).
Chicago made the playoffs 1992-1996? I'm not skeptical of your claim, just foggy on playoff records for teams other than Ottawa.
Huh.  I hadn't seen that particular trailer.  Thanks!
Didn't gather that from the trailer - tentatively withdrawing my comment, then.
So, this looks terrible but I can imagine kids getting behind it.  Right up until that girl who is talking about not revealing identities.  Probably the weakest delivery of the bunch; the other actors at least seem to be into it.
So I guess it's impossible that opinions on a film are subjective, and The Last Jedi is objectively terrible.

OK.
I don't think so. I was mainly joking. But now a little bit interested in watching Anakin / Vader's portrayal on screen through the movies. 

However I am currently packing stuff away so can't do that at the moment.
Happened to me on Monday. I've seen others complain about it on the sub too. Seems to be related to disconnecting / reconnecting to your phone.
Is he blowing a kiss to someone there? 

Great posters btw
I think of Hot Fuzz every time I see the sign for Simcoe County in Ontario. 

(Their slogan is "For the greater good".)
You could also just end with season 3 musical and make up your own Daemon story.  

I haven't watched either movie in a long time so I don't quite remember how many good parts there really were (though I do remember liking the movies overall).
> And then you could even spawn more sequels off that idea, to the point where the entire Earth is one big set for Truman.

No, no, Earth was built by the Magratheans.
What this addition to ESB does is show how vain Vader really is.  Every time his shuttle lands he needs all the Imperial troops to stand at attention just as they would for the Emperor.

(I don't really like the scene either, just trying to make an omelette here.)
Watch face is Suunto Vector - available in Watchmaker.

Edit: also if the face looks a little odd, I got some screen protectors for the s3, which don't seem to fit entirely on the screen. For the most part I don't really notice it which is fine by me.
I think your evaluation of the situation fits with my view completely. It's not a black and white situation, but has plenty of shades of gray.
I would say the reality is somewhere in between both of you. I agree with you re: Fisher. And Chara was probably a result of Muckler's treatment of Hossa.
Playing devil's advocate here; the other person is crediting Melnyk with losing players because of either money or personality related issues.
No idea but I'd rather see Celsius than Farenheit personally ;-)
I don't know what to tell you - the links work for me from my Samsung device. They don't work via desktop.
I think I probably downloaded some of these at one point in my fandom. Nice find.
Havlat on the front, Hossa on the back? Guessing based on 9 and 18, looks like the letter H in both sides to me.
Yes, I worded that wrong. I was also sure they meant western as in western world.
Yes! I agree with this 100%. I try not to follow behind large trucks for this reason. If you can't pass them then just stay further behind them
I didn't miss that part. What you're saying is it's okay to infringe copyright for a property that isn't producing new content. 

It's not. Maybe I compared the wrong franchises for you. But at the end of the day, as you acknowledged, if they decided they want to enforce their copyright it's within their right. 

And actually, in order to be able to make future claims, they need to show that they've made efforts to protect their property. 

But okay, sure, they're a terrible company because they want to enforce their copyrights.
I get where you're coming from - it looks bad to a fan when a company chooses to enforce its copyright for small time stuff like this.  But really, you're villifying the company for stopping people from making money on their intellectual property? 

Are you suggesting that it's okay / legal for fans to do this for a property like Star Wars or Star Trek? 

Maybe tone down the hyperbole for this one.
I can confirm that not tailgating has little effect in terms of avoiding getting hit by rocks etc. after being up north. All I mean by that is you don't need to be following close behind someone to get hit with a rock. I once had a rock hit me from the opposite lane. 

However you are less likely to experience stone chips etc when following at a reasonable distance and like you said, not tailgating.
Oh haha. Yeah that's the same then. Right on :-)
So, didn't know it had a different colour scheme available. Mine is black and gold. How did you get white?
So before you shared the link I went looking for it in the Gear store. I prefer this Aviator face: http://apps.samsung.com/gear/appDetail.as?appId=com.watchface.aviator_clear_health_aod
I think it has an airplane in it yes
No but I've heard of similar reactions for Fitbit. Try changing which wrist you wear it on (I wear it on the opposite wrist when I sleep) or just removing it every now and then. 

I've never had any issues personally.
The Nighttime Podcast
All true - but you'll get an idea of rates there if you have a look around the site.
It does. I suggested it mostly because the contrast between the start and end of the show is wild.
Battlestar Galactica. I don't know whether you'd count the miniseries as the pilot, or use '33' as the "pilot".
Really great look. Thanks for sharing!
nothing at all
Ah, it defaults to the extra dials showing. That's why I didn't recognize it :-)
Don't wait. Sales on all the time.
Very nice. What's the watch face?
Pretty sure that was an intentional spelling of SNES -it's a common meme on Twitter and here.
I believe OP simply meant "unofficial" merchandise and not "anti-Melnyk". 

But these shirts were sold for a charity (possibly Sens Foundation?) and I doubt anyone would get into any trouble here.
Those shirts were sold to in support of a charity weren't they? They have nothing to do with the MelnykOut movement.
Fyi Samsung will tell you to contact the developer for a refund unless the app in question is defective. I doubt Samsung considers this a defect.
Not a texting app but I can make full replies with Allo, so wouldn't surprise me to learn many others work.
You're getting downvoted but I somewhat agree. I would rather see nothing than constant posts about how this new show is terrible / isn't reboot.
Thanks for this! I will snoop around and see what I'm comfortable with haha.
It's nice! Is it a Galaxy App store face or something in watchmaker?

Edit: found it in the Galaxy apps. Trying out one of their free faces, not too bad!
Same for me on pocket Casts.
I don't have S Pay as an app for my Gear though. And in the Gear app, there's no setting option to click on for it.
Well darn!  Oh well.
For anyone interested in some context about the link above, it seems to be about the launch of a podcast called The Daily by the New York Times.
I think people really like the future parts / nostalgia has an effect. Personally I find III to be superior to II. The first is obviously the best.
I disagree with you about it being the greatest sequel of all time.
I don't know the quality of the movie until I watch it. 

But there are plenty of trailers that don't interest me / don't make the movie look good in my eyes. I would say the purpose of a trailer is primarily to generate interest in the movie, and awareness of it.
I think most of the reactions are to the marketing yes. Personally the first trailer just didn't impress me very much. I'm familiar with the source material and it's honestly not something I feel I really need to see on the big screen. Like I said though, I appreciated the most recent trailer more and think it does better justice to what the final product might look like. The first trailer just seemed like an incoherent mash up of "stuff"; at least in the most recent trailer I can recognize plot points from the story I'm familiar with.
Just read the article, and viewed the latest trailer.  I had written it off as something I wasn't interested in seeing in the theatres and would catch whenever available via streaming; but the latest trailer makes it look like it's actually pretty good.  I will still likely put my movie dollars toward other things, but it doesn't look as bad as people are pre-judging it to be.
Let's read the wording again and see if any plausible deniability was built in.
I don't complain about battery life, but care to share what your set up is?  I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking at.
Pricey!  But maybe something I might save up for.  We'll see :) 

Aren't the Gear Icon X headphones mainly supposed to act as self-contained units that can hold music/podcasts/etc. though?
Have a listen to [Anthology Pod](https://anthologypod.com) (forget the username of the /r/podcasts member that does it); sounds like a similar show.  He does his solo.  Might give you an idea of how it might work for you.  
Just start recording and releasing. Don't overthink it. That's how you started, right? 

Worst case scenario you're starting from scratch, which is where you started the first time. You'll find your audience.
Me too! My wife calls me old but now it's 100% certain.
Alrighty, I'll go down your list ;) 

> - Get Spotify app. 

Already got it!  I haven't made much use of it yet, as I don't have good BT headphones right now.  

> If you have a Galaxy device, the integration is so much better with Samsung health, emaill, messages and phone calls.  

Check!  And I added MyFitnessPal as well, which gave me a year's worth of Premium MFP for free.  

> If you are into home automation, and have Samsung SmartHub, then get the Samsung connect app and you will be able to control your home using your watch! 

I am into home automation, but don't have anything like that set up in the house :( But good to know for the future!  

> Since I am into NBA a lot, get the NBA app. It will give you all the scores and stuff right on the display.  

Not a basketball fan.  Perhaps there's a similar NHL or MLB app?  

> Also get the pipboy watch face. Why? Because it's the BEST.  

Where is this one available?
I thought I saw somewhere recently that Bixby is coming to the Gear S3.
I got mine this past Saturday, and love it.  At first I didn't realize I could reply with more than pre-populated messages - now that I know there's a T9 keyboard, I think it's amazing.  

What I dislike about the watch is not really the fault of the watch; I can't use Samsung Pay because in Canada, only CIBC supports the service, and I don't use CIBC.  

Other than that, maybe the fact that I can't change the snooze time to anything but 5 minutes.  

I'm still learning the ins and outs of the watch so I'm sure I'll discover more as I go!  

/u/insertcoin86 do you have any tips for a new user?
I don't think the book had an issue with the number of female characters, but it was written with a very heavy male gaze and not women-friendly.
Awesome, thanks!  
> a return to Spielberg's adventure roots 

OK 

> like Jaws 

I don't put Jaws in the adventure category, personally...


> Some other 'pros' I guess are adding exercise without increasing calorie limits

I remember seeing this setting somewhere but can't find it right now.  What part of the website can you find this in?
I just got it for free for a year with my Samsung Gear S3, and I'm just dipping my toes into it.  I love that you can set different daily calorie goals - for example I took out 200 calories per day (200x5=1000) and added to Saturday/Sunday, days I tend to eat more.  Haven't done much else with it yet.
Oof, $5 / year?  That's not too high a price, I just can't see myself using that many watch faces ;) Is it basically the same idea as a music subscription service, where you could pay $x per year and stream unlimited music, or pay *a la carte* per track?
Good to know.  Came to this thread to find this out too ;) 
Nice. I take it that this is available on the Watchmaker app? 

How do those apps compare to Facer? So far I've not been too impressed with Facer. They look a little too fake.
You might enjoy Cynical Cartoons. Doesn't fit your criteria 100% but is close.
Agreed. However I think there might be some use cases for activating tasks from my watch. I have a task that randomly updates my phone lock screen wallpaper for instance, activating that from my watch would be neat.
That's a really good point, especially when you think about the negative connotations behind just the word "diet".  

At the end of it, it's just a misunderstanding of how CICO is represented here.  

CICO is the *mechanism* of weight loss.  As can be seen in this subreddit, there are many different ways of using the mechanism.  These articles are missing the point, but I think at the same time CICO gets a little misrepresented here as well.
The weight loss industry can't make any money on CICO, so it discredits it - even though the methods they sell are actually based on CICO.  At the same time, most weight loss programs are designed to allow for failure so that you keep coming back (that might be a bit cynical to look at, but it's definitely a business model for gyms - they sell more gym memberships than they have actual space for).  

What these articles take away from CICO is that they don't realize people on /r/loseit realize that you can't sustain yourself on junk food - just that scientifically, if you eat nothing but junk food at a caloric deficit, you *will lose weight*.  

You learn pretty quick with CICO that if you eat healthier foods you'll eat less and still feel full.  If you read these articles, that's basically what they're saying.  They're just taking the extreme viewpoints and telling you that you need to buy X Weight Loss Program to be successful, because it's not that easy.

(And it's not easy - like I said, they just can't sell CICO as a product.)  

Edit: Also in that first article you linked to - they mention the difference between 300 calories in a blueberry muffin and 300 calories "from cooked oats topped with almonds and blueberries".  This is what CICO teaches you.  If you just eat junk food, you run out of calories in a day really quickly and you have to learn to eat better, more calorie dense foods.
> was I burning calories in addition to my normal daily calorie burn (if I hadn't gone for the walk, for example) or was I just burning the normal amount and the Fitbit just thinks it's a workout and credited those calories to it? Sorry if that's not incredibly clear.

Because the Charge 2 has the heart rate measuring built-in (not sure if you have it turned on or not, but it works best if you do), FitBit constantly registers how many calories you burn throughout the day.  You're probably familiar with TDEE / BMR etc.  This is what it's measuring.  

FitBit registers ALL calories as one total, but your exercise will show how many calories you burned specifically on your walk.  It adds this total to your daily calories.  So if you burned 100 calories on your walk, and your daily calorie burn says something like 2580, that 2580 *includes* your 100 calories burned on your walk.  

This is why sometimes people get confused or alarmed when they see such a high number of calories burned.  FitBit is counting what you burn to exist.
What's "better" is what works for you.  If you feel like you can keep on top of it go with weekly.  If you find that it's not working stick with daily.  

I suppose also you could look at it sort of like the 'eating back calories' question.  Some people do, some people don't, with variances in between.  

Personally, if I'm under my calorie goal I leave it as-is.  I don't consciously eat extra food the next day to balance it out.  
It will help. Always best to keep record of the survey number for these reasons.
> Interestingly for PocketCasts the bezel just skips ahead in the track

I think that's because that's what the 'next' function is for pocket casts.  If the music app you were using defaulted to fast forward or rewind it'd have the same functionality.

In my car, the 'back' and 'forward' buttons on my steering wheel skip ahead or skip back when I listen to pocket casts, change tracks when I'm on music, or change pre-sets when I'm using the radio.  

It's perfect.
That's still ignoring the structure of the story.  A movie with multiple parts would all be structured like movies.  

Star Wars are distinctly movies, you would agree with me there?  They're structured as movies.  You could not break them up into TV episodes because they're not structured that way.  They wouldn't make any sense.
TV episodes, whether or not they are released all at once or weekly, have a distinctly different structure from movies.
This makes sense to me; the plugins are essentially worthless if they don't have Tasker to, well, plug into.  

I think Join is the only standalone app that uses Tasker plugin actions but it doesn't rely on Tasker.  I don't know if that makes any sense ;) 

Joao, Tasker support from other apps need to be implemented by the app developers themselves, right?  For example, if I wanted built-in Tasker functions for say, the Goodreads app, the Goodreads developers would have to add that, right?  It's not something that can be done from the Tasker end?
Nice!  This is not related to your walking there other than where you went: I'm not familiar with Chick-fil-a at all (I don't believe we have that in Canada).  Is the coffee good there, or was it basically a decision based on it being the closest place that sold coffee, but still presented a reasonable distance for a walk?  
> This is like my fourth or fifth Day One...

You and me both.  I took an extended MFP break (somewhat on purpose, but also not, at the same time), and gained 7 pounds back on what I lost.  I know exactly why, too, it's not a mystery.  

I just got a free MFP premium account for a year with my Gear S3 so going to see how that helps my journey.  Re-adjusted my goals, and just taking it one week at a time.


Understood!  Haha.  It is a nice shot of it.
This is from The Force Awakens.  Not really classic?
Great post. I haven't listened to any podcasts all weekend but I've got Overthinking It Episode 503 cued up after watching Black Panther last night.
Hey OP, I just got upgraded to a free premium MFP membership for 1 year with my Samsung Gear S3. I will keep notes on my experience with it and review it at some point. This was a surprise to me so thought I'd share what I can about it!
Not really familiar with BP lore so that's something I'll have to look up now haha.
We saw the mid UN credits but left before seeing that. Had to pee. Basically a set up for Infinity War?
Not *exactly* what you're looking for, but 31 Thoughts: The Podcast often has good stories from the hosts plus the interviews they get. (It's an NHL podcast if you didn't know).
I don't know what to think about Ceci.  Apparently he's highly sought-after by many other teams in the league.  It almost seems to make sense to jump on that and move him along - it might be better for both sides (I'm sure Ceci is aware of what the more vocal members of the fanbase think of him).  

On the other hand...if he's so highly valued, maybe there's a reason to keep him.
You just did! </inception> 

^(^I ^don't ^know ^if ^that's ^how ^that ^works)
Note that I know nothing about Sanheim before continuing with this comment.

But...I wonder if this trade had gone through, would there have been a greater chance that Karlsson got traded?  Sens would have a defenceman coming back for sure, and at least one first round pick (perhaps in 2019?).  


Exactly.  Though for brevity's sake I just mentally included those in a bracket for the second time (first being Roswell That Ends Well).
I think you have to assume Karlsson is staying until a trade is announced or one side comes out and says he's leaving.  

Mainly because we have no idea what would be coming back in a trade - hard to speculate how the team would look without Karlsson.
I think it's more likely that the Terminator franchise might not have taken off.  
Unfortunately I'm not really familiar with either.  But it also could be your equipment the mics are hooked up to...either of you using a mixer, or pre-amp, or just straight to the computer?  

There are all sorts of variables.  You might want to ask /u/bangsnaughtybits for help, he stops by here every now and then.
I think the paid version is really only necessary if you really feel you need to drill down to specific numbers in your journey.  I've never tried the pro version.  Hopefully someone who uses it might shed some light.

I wonder also if you're more likely to find someone on /r/fitness who has paid for it.
I imagine it's a difference in the equipment that you're using.  What are you using anyway?  

I think what people often do is what you're already doing...each of you record your own side, and then stitch it together.  Provides the cleanest version possible.
> **Just knowing that I'm going to have to write down what I did for food and exercise that day** is a helpful push to make me eat well and do something physical, without the tedium of actual calorie counting.

 (emphasis mine)

This is, without a doubt, exactly why your method works for you.  While you're not tracking calories, you're holding yourself accountable.  Writing your food intake down helps you visualize what you're putting in your body.  

Calorie counting is basically this process, just more specific.  

Great write-up, I support all of it!
Haha.  Also, the episode in question is Treehouse of Horrors VI, which aired in 1995; I'm not surprised that there'd be quite a few redditors (who skew on the "born after 1990" side of the scale) unfamiliar with it.
It's a Simpsons reference.
Twice!
I was hoping this was a thread asking if podcasts were self aware.  Not sure if that would be great or terrifying.
> can you imagine getting rid of a coach every time their team doesn't make the play offs?

This is sort of my line of thought to the people who were upset about Dorion's 3-year extension.  GMs usually are long-term hires - it's very rare that a GM will be fired after one disappointing season.  

I think Boucher at least deserves an opportunity to show he can adjust; but if we have more games where Ottawa can't score on the Powerplay, questionable player use, etc. then I think it's fair to let him go.
> That's your opinion, and I respect that. But I disagree.

I don't know, every single post I've seen from you has been extremely inflammatory and very close to personal attacks on the actual people at Rainmaker.  

I'm withholding any judgment of the show until the first episode is actually out.  And honestly, I probably won't ever end up watching it because I'm in Canada and it's not airing here until June, on YTV, and I'll probably not see any advertising for it since I don't watch YTV regularly because I'm not 13.  

Edit: also downvote button is not for disagreeing.
When was this cover photo updated?  

Is it not possible they just didn't have any character models to share?  

Anyway - I get that you're not happy with the product they're teasing, but you're kind of going over the top with bashing them.  
That's sad to hear :( 
Sublet would be a good idea - tons of summer sublets from students posted right now (I know this because I'm looking for a house to rent, but that's the majority of what I'm seeing right now...)
I read that on Twitter just now, 6th Sens posted it.

What doesn't make sense to me is this line:  
> As a team, we need to get younger, faster and more skilled.

The team is already pretty young and fast.  How much younger and faster can it get?
Better, pretend it was Spock & McCoy as intended rather than Scotty and Chekov.
Your question makes no sense.  Why should you ever feel bad for liking one thing more than another?

I will say I will always prefer TNG over TOS; but as I've gotten older and gone back to watch some TOS episodes, I've developed a new appreciation for them.  But I prefer DS9 to them all.
Me neither, realistically speaking.  But having used Google Assistant in the car, I could probably think of a few situations where having voice activated functions could be helpful.  Still not enough situations where I'd want to get a smart speaker though.  
I mean, I get that there are companies that make it *extremely difficult* to cancel, but there's no way that a company can prevent you from cancelling at all.
>However, her main issue is when we take her for a walk, she will always pull and bark at other people and dogs. She is no means aggressive though. She just want attention and what them to play with her

I have this problem too; my understanding of it is that it's partially because she's restrained on her leash and it's a bit threatening for her.  I haven't been able to figure out how to train this out of her yet.  Still working on it.  
I'm nowhere near being an expert (my own puppy is a brat herself, still in training) but need to work on recall.  At some point it will click if you keep working on it.  We decided one day a few weeks back to take our puppy on a little hike in an isolated area so she could be off-leash, and we knew there weren't any other people / dogs in the area.  She was fine running off exploring but would come running when we called or come looking for us when she lost sight of us.  She also comes inside from the backyard when called (mostly - like I said, work in progress).  

So that's basically my advice - just keep working with her.  It'll come with time. 
I find it hard to believe that a company would prevent you from cancelling the service and still be in business.  Hyperbole is great.  

Anyway I've never used them so have no experience.  
I just read a thread where someone was complaining about there not being a web browser, social media, or maps app for Tizen.  This confuses me, because why would I want to do some of these things on such a tiny screen?  

I think I fall under the "average user" category you're speaking of.
Do yourself a favour and throw on Nirvana's Nevermind, followed by early Foo Fighters.
> Whatsapp, Facebook messenger, android pay (I wish), Google maps, Web browser, twitter etc. Simple and basic apps that are available on other wearable OSs.

Maybe I'm in the minority here but I don't feel like one needs to use a web browser or maps on a watch.  If I *really* want to access social media I think I'll just pull out my phone.
Gotcha.  I'm turning 34 on Monday so I remember a time when this was a new song :) 
Interesting that the Gear Sport doesn't seem to perform well as a sports watch, since that's what it's geared for (no pun intended).  I'm looking at the Gear S3 Frontier edition which from what I understand is a tiny bit more feature intensive than the Gear Sport.
Yeah.  My one regret for when I switch to the Gear S3...FitBit's corresponding app is amazing.
Ah geez you're probably right.  

I think the reason I'm going with Samsung's watches is because I have a Samsung device.  It's built to work with their products.  Similar to how Apple Watch is built to work with iPhones.  

Everything else is just too fragmented to gain traction, in my opinion.
I've got a FitBit Charge 2, will be moving to the Gear S3 soon.  

I briefly considered the Ionic but from opinions I've received, most people recommend the Garmin if you're looking for a fitness smart watch.  Development just isn't there for the Ionic.  

How many watch OS's are out there anyway?  There's Apple, Android, Tizen (Samsung), and FitBit OS.  Am I missing any?  I think that's the problem right there.
Nirvana - Smells Like Teen Spirit.  It is a **90's** song.

It surprises and shocks me that people don't immediately recognize it.  No offense OP, I'm genuinely curious; how old are you?
So I was going to disagree that this is a terrible thing until I saw your comment that they were on the 417.  Not a good idea, at all.  
> Fitbit is way more niche in the smartwatch categories.

From what I understand, FitBit's Ionic is a fitness wearable first, smart watch second.  More like a fitness tracker with smart watch features, and those aren't even fully developed.
This article surprises me in suggesting that FitBit is in the race.  Everything I read over at /r/fitbit & in asking around about the Ionic suggests doom and gloom for their smart watches.
I'm guessing there's no way to use Google Assistant with it rather than S Voice?  

My S7 default for the home button is Google Assistant, haven't been subjected to S Voice since I used an S3.
I've been impressed with the level that some of the team's draft picks are playing.  Hoffman has proven me wrong over the last three seasons - I didn't think he would continue his level of play after his breakout year, but I've been pleasantly surprised.  

Others have mentioned Dzingle - he's been great this year.  

I have no issues with player development overall.  The problem this season has been player usage at the NHL level, but that's on the coach.
The only thing I don't like about the way Levar Burton reads is you can hear his lips a lot. But he's been that way for as long as I can remember (Reading Rainbow) so I just live with it.
Haha fair enough. That's a terrible way to spend the day with the flu, sorry to hear that!
...did you seriously take a day off? I guess I shouldn't judge - it's okay to have different priorities. Personally I don't understand the need to break the news as soon as possible or being the first. 

All of the information ends up being available and summarized at the end of the day. It's not a big deal for me as it is for some I guess.
Sort of. Are you familiar with Rifftrax? The hosts are Mike J. Nelson and Conor Lastowka, who if I'm not mistaken were also involved with Mystery Science Theater 3000. 

They went into RP1 assuming that they would hate it (they did, but they had fun with it). They have a "fan fiction or real" segment as well as "dumbest sentence of the week" segment if that tells you anything. 

It's more of a book club that makes fun of the book on top of discussing it.
TIL people think it's death nail.
I use reddit on PC most of the time (I mean, I am at work after all).
The way these things are presented make a big difference too.  

Bob McKenzie & Elliot Friedman are great - they say it in such a way that absolves them completely if they're wrong.  They always say that "they think" or "they believe" that something is happening based on the information received.  

The tweets that Yost was sending out had no such couching and were worded with such a certainty that make it harder to trust.
It's the problem with sports writers not wanting to reveal their source so that they can remain insiders.  

The minute one of those reporters divulges their source is the minute their well runs dry.
My bet is that the deal they signed was cheap - Netflix is all about securing content and if it doesn't cost them too much, they'll do it.  
>I can't believe Netflix would pull something like this.

This isn't Netflix \- they just snagged up the broadcast rights.  Just so you don't feel any ill will toward Netflix :\)
Where'd the sticky note come from?  Looks like the 'scrap book' type of material.  I like it.
Umm.  Isn't Samsung's Gear S3 AMOLED and uses Always On Display technology?  I don't know how it compares with the Ionic in terms of brightness.  Unfortunately stores don't tend to have these watches on functional display so I haven't really played around with either watch.
372 Pages We'll Never Get Back

The first season covered Ready Player One; the second season is currently covering Armada.  
Please post in the weekly episode thread; thanks!
Maybe /u/infinitygoof wants to draft someone with skills equivalent to a 30+ year old hockey player.
> Depending on when you bought your DVDs and/or whether or not you utilized the disc replacement program your DVDs of the sequels might not even be properly framed.

Pretty sure that the DVDs I have are the mis-framed sets, I remember hearing about that.  Awesome.  Thanks for the help!
Gee thanks. I totally spent hours framing those shots for a quick post. I'm so glad that you recognize the time I poured into these photos. I feel like you truly "get" me. /s
How old is the son? I removed being terrified of Judge Doom when seeing this in theatres. Given that it was released in 1988 I would have been 4 (possibly 3, depending on the month I guess).

Edit: read the article. I understand the premise now! I would recommend a younger age is okay. Between 7 and 12 maybe?
Detroit also almost traded Yzerman for Yashin. But that was a different situation.
> Stamkos and signed him to an absurdly cheap contract.

I don't know Stamkos' contract details, but you have to also consider the value that no tax represents in Florida.  Take Stamkos' deal and add a few million in any other market, basically.
Ah OK.  What an odd thing to specify.  I shouldn't be surprised at things Melnyk says, though.
They contradict each other, but only a little.  

A GM can take phone calls from other GMs, and ask for things once the other GM has made an offer.  But that's fundamentally different from a GM taking the initiative and calling other GMs and saying, "what can you give me for Karlsson?"  

End of the day - it's semantics, and it still looks bad.
You keep referencing a $68M internal cap; is there any evidence anywhere pointing to this number?  I don't mean to say they *don't* have an internal spending cap, but I'm just curious where this number comes from.  
Oh don't get me wrong, I don't think he's wrong - I just don't like the style he's doing it.  Not my cup of tea.  

The biggest reason I decided to unsubscribe was that there was too much content for me to keep up with (and it's usually all at least an hour long) in a given week.  
That's why I mentioned that I think this works fine if you're looking at it at a weekly level. 

What I actually did in my experience was track it daily, but also add the overage divided over the rest of the week (using the quick add calories). Say if I went over Monday by 300, I'd split that over 6 days to reduce my limit the rest of the week. 

It got to be too tedious so I went back to daily logging and not worrying about the weekly picture.
 I disagree.  In a given week you want to eat x amount of calories.  What difference does it make when you're logging them?  It doesn't, really, as long as you stick with your plan and log 500 calories fewer than you entered.  

I can see that this process might not be helpful if you keep going over 500 calories each day, but if you're strict to your calorie count and go over one day, adding them to your next day's log isn't all that bad.  

I used to do this when I was tracking my numbers weekly rather than daily; but I no longer do this because my mechanism for tracking weekly isn't all that great, and it stopped working for me.  
I'll tune into the Mendo interview but I stopped subscribing to his show because I thought it was too long and had too many "here's all the stuff I'm doing and why you should give me money" breaks. I think it's just maybe the style he's doing it rubs me the wrong way. But the actual content is gold!
So it's prequel memes then.
Except that this is a joke account and s/he did make it up.
> Don't remember where I read it, but apparently he gets his skin scrubbed either daily or weekly.

I bet he uses Dove, so it's not so hard on his skin.
Oh geez.  I remember when he \<File Not Found\> and \<Error: 404\>.  He'll be missed.
> Even if you post a cover of a song they do own because that's considered fair use.

That's not fair use.  You need to obtain proper licensing to publicly perform someone else's song.  

And fair use is a legal defense, that you have to prove that it's fair use.
> PKs already signed long term.

I'm not suggesting that I think they would acquire PK or that they should, but it would certainly fit with previous deals Dorion's done.  

Consistently they've made deals based on contracts and how much time is left on them.  Most recently they dumped Turris for an extra year of Duchene.  It's not crazy to me that they would swap Karlsson for Subban because Subban's contract doesn't expire for a while.
Something that floated around on Twitter yesterday.  I can't remember where it started but it was from an "official" media account (i.e. member of the media).
Just mentioned in another comment the most recent 31 Thoughts podcast; they had some GM interviews and in at least one of them they mentioned needing owner approval on trades.  This is a common thing.  

I don't think that it's normal for the owner to be in the same room, mind you, but it might expedite certain deals.
Go listen to the most recent 31 Thoughts Podcast.  Some interesting comments from Friedman & former GMs about the difference between a team getting offers and actively making overtures to trade a player.  

I forget which GM was talking about it but he mentioned specifically how toxic situations like this can get because of semantics in the media.
I think the general acceptance is that they started building both at the same time or something. But ROTJ opening crawl implies construction started relatively close to the time the movie started.
It was changed for the DVDs for sure. Same with Hayden Christensen replacing Sebastien Shaw as the Force ghost. 

I think *most* of the changes that we see on the BluRay edition were done on the DVDs, with minor tweaks on the BluRay.
OP, how old were you when TPM came out? Just curious. I would have been 15 which I guess qualifies me as a kid. 

What a time to be alive back then :-)
Oh yeah, well aware that his voice is drastically different from 30+ years ago. I just thought it was interesting that you can hear his voice is a bit closer in ROTJ to what we get now than in ANH/ESB.
He did not age well apparently! Thanks
Also his choices were limited due to not being in league with the directors Guild, or something like that?
The shuttle originally first appeared in rotj, was added to the special edition for ESB though. They used a version of the same rotj scene in ESB se for whatever reason.
I can't remember which movie I have it for but I think it's The Phantom Menace; they released an "ultimate" version that does exactly what you're asking about. It's pretty fantastic. I can't dig it up right now because it's in a box in another house.
Just imagining what you'd have to do to acquire 26 first round picks. 

I think you get the Coyotes as a result.
[I'll just leave this here. ](https://i.imgur.com/regy7vA.jpg)
Yeah, I'm not putting any stock into Jagr or Hoffman rumours like that. The Hoffman one that was mentioned is pretty silly in comparison though.
Thanks everyone for the suggestions! I was able to return the destroyed toys and found these just so I at least don't lose money: 

[new toys](https://i.imgur.com/c7fAqPX.jpg)

The green one is supposed to be made of real fire hose, the other one is just tougher than the last couple I bought. She's already chewed one ear on the rhino but I'm okay with that. She loves it! I will probably just try to limit her time with it for now ;-)
Sounds like the rumor about jagr leaving for the KHL fit the same reason.
Anything soft that might take her longer than an hour to get through? She likes soft toys better than hard toys (like Kong etc. She likes these but I think sometimes she wants to chew through stuff).
But he's not being flipped right this second is his problem I think. Can't wait til Monday.
I gather that there are details of it that we don't know about yet.
I think you're reading it wrong.  

If the 2018 1st round pick is top 10, the Sens have a choice of keeping that pick, or giving it to Colorado and keeping the 2019 pick instead.  

If the 2018 1st round pick is NOT top 10, then the Sens automatically lose it and keep their 2019 pick.  

All trades need to be approved by the league.
What kind of influence does Yost actually have in the hockey news world?  I just got a notification from CBS Sports with the title something like "Report: Karlsson to be traded by June" and their only real source was Yost's tweet about it being a "binary situation" of Karlsson being traded now or in June.  

There's no other source whatsoever.  Man, I hate clickbait.
Duchene for Turris was all about the extra contract year that Duchene had vs Turris.  I imagine if they had been able to sign Turris to a deal, they would have tried to bring in Duchene without losing Turris (maybe by sending Brassard - who knows?).  
Mostly I agree with you about the lack of long-term planning, but you could also say that they realized it didn't work out and made the best of it.  

I would rather they come up with a productive solution to move on from something rather than double-down and not be accountable for something not working.  You don't want to get into sunk cost fallacies.
Sens only lose their 1st if it's not a top 10 pick.  No problem here.
Hell of a team right there.
There's a lot of talk around Tavares as well right now, if I'm not mistaken.
Especially in relation to Toronto, right?  Toronto really wanted him to go to the Leafs.
This is what I'm thinking.  Had a conversation not too long ago saying something similar.  Previously they just didn't have the same standards \(i.e. cancelling based on X Forecast\), likely if you applied today's standards to 20 years ago we'd have the same amount of cancellations.
Most people when they post TIL's will post at least *some* of the content.  Here, would have been nice to see what the favourite line was.  Instead I have to click on the link.  That's great that you learned it today, I'm not really interested enough to click through the link...
The first TIL that I've come across that makes you actually read the article / watch the video.  I can't be bothered.
Clearly different people in charge of the show / content though.
Team Homan, while they each have jobs, are as close as you can get to professional curlers as well. From what I've heard (I curled in the club they started in, City View), they were pretty much built to be an olympic team. 

But you're right, it's definitely a different level in Europe when it comes to funding etc.
It's as if petitions on change.org hold no weight.  My world is crumbling around me!
> I hate that argument, "it's for kids, so it's okay if it's bad!"

I think you misunderstand me.  I didn't say it's okay that it's bad.  

I'm referring to the elements of the original ReBoot IP - they're obviously not designing this show to appeal to the original fans based on the trailer.  It's not fair to hate it just because it doesn't look like what we know is familiar, which seems to be 90% of the complaints.  

I think they definitely are trying to get some of the older audience to introduce the show to the younger audience but that's about the only connection I see.
Let me translate this post for everyone:

"Paul is dead."
I'm not disagreeing with people's comments here, but remember: this isn't being made for ReBoot fans (we've grown up); this is being made for the current kid demographic.  It's not for us.  If you don't like what you see in the trailer then just don't watch it.
What I'm saying is that there's no sense in getting worked up when there are two sides using Twitter as their main source.  The first side said, "hearing this about a potential Karlsson deal"...and then this side, Dreger says "not likely to be a deal" or whatever.  But we don't know who THEIR sources are.  

These articles and posts are all hearsay and not worth putting stock into.  If this was a court proceeding, the evidence would be thrown out.
this is the kind of shitpost I come here for.
Yzerman and Dorion just having fun with waivers.
> Karlsson would tell him to do this with an agreement he will sign back in two years.

Isn't that considered tampering?
Their team strength is hitting, so it's not surprising that she doesn't do well with draws.  The other teams know this too.  They looked so much better last year at the World Championships, this year they just didn't look as well-rounded.  

> I don't recall it being this bad before

Short memory perhaps because they're always this bad.  It's the thaw/freeze cycle that makes them pop up everywhere.  
Unpopular what if: Sens trade Karlsson for Tavares, Tavares extends with Ottawa.
> I've heard tell of peaking at -3dbs

10+ years ago when I was in radio broadcasting at college, our production class taught us to normalize to -3 for digital audio.  That's usually what I stick with.  You've got some good replies in this already that are more helpful though.
Basically, there's no reason to believe either side.  Both stories are stemming from a twitter quote.
This happens a lot with players, and I doubt it's any different with any other group of fans.  People will defend a player until they turn blue, but once he's traded, all of a sudden the articles / opinions about how bad a player he is come out of the woodwork.  It's basically a coping mechanism.
General Manager Pierre Dorion
I don't think you're replying to the right person but I will go ahead and disagree with you that it's not about money.
> I can't believe they're even considering this.

Look at the owner, and his comments, and it's pretty easy to believe.  

I don't want to see it happen but at this point I'm not surprised.  What's unfortunate is that the return won't be as high because they'd be bundling in Ryan's contract.
I wasn't a fan of that Star Wars short - however because I watched it YouTube gave me recommendations for other short Star Wars fan films.  The one I clicked on was a Han Solo short - "Smuggler's Trade" I believe.  Well done, and the actor they got for Han was really close physically to Harrison Ford and had the mannerisms down to a tee.  

I wouldn't go as far as saying he'd make a better Han for the upcoming Solo movie, but at the very least it's interesting that they couldn't find a closer resemblance for the film.  

Edit: link to the film: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvPfCTyd3X8&t=740s 
Ah okay. So likely not on the regular BluRay release that I probably picked up cheap at a discount store somewhere. 

Thanks!
What is the rogue cut and is it something that's legally available / easy to find?
Also, isn't that shot him coming in after missing Japan concede the match? So he missed the win?
I don't exactly know what you mean. Mobile and web app you mean? Yes, it syncs between all platforms as long as you're logged in.
Bernard isn't going to see any playing time.
Well, that's pretty much the way you get the result you want.  Your show needs to be popular enough to merit it.  I'm pretty sure iTunes approaches you, not the other way around.
Be as famous as Marc Maron.
I have had zero issues syncing between Android and iOS on Pocket Casts.  Don't let /u/SChrisDm's bad experience deter you from Pocket Casts if that's the app you like.  

I actively use both platforms for listening and they both sync in the background.  The key is that you login so that you can sync.
I don't feel like this question warrants its own post - but it's not really a stupid question either.  

I've wanted to launch a new show for a while now - something short, like 20 minutes or less, that's just me on a mic, and easy to produce.  I already host one podcast that can be a time-sink (to the point where I don't do it regularly anymore, and focus on the blogging portion of it primarily now), and co-host another one, so I already know the basics of how podcasting works.  The point of what I want to create is that it's low-effort and I can just push something out weekly and not think too much about it.  

Do you think there's *any* interest out there in a virtual nobody launching a 'catch-all' show?  No single niche, just me talking.  The idea that's come to mind right now is that each episode would be a single topic, but there's no unifying theme to the show.  Simply because I think any other kind of show would involve too much of a time commitment.  

Or am I overthinking this and should just do what I feel like, and not worry about making sure there's an audience for it?  

I've only been able to watch bits of the Canada/Korea game, and that end they gave up three utterly baffled me.  They were discussing taking the single point with the draw but opted to go with the hit instead, which obviously did not go right.  

It's strange.  Their strength is definitely with the hits, but I recall in recent tournaments commentators noting that they've worked on their draw game a lot more to be more well-rounded.  And for the most part, they display this.  Just not in the Olympics so far.
I think part of what you're struggling with is that it looks a lot easier with the overhead view compared to how it looks at ice level.  Effectively placed guards can greatly cut down chances for the other team to take out your rocks.  

On the flip side - in the last end, if you're leading and don't have hammer, you usually DON'T want to put up a guard, for the exact reason that you would normally throw one - you don't want to give the other team the chance to set up their rocks to score in the last end.  
On Space it sure is!  On Netflix it doesn't look too bad.
There's no such thing as remastered versions of DS9...DVD quality is the best it comes in.  It's definitely not in HD.

I don't know anything about CraveTV though, I've never subscribed.   
> Bumblebee regained his voice somehow,

Don't forget, he regained it at the end of 1, and then lost it with no explanation.  Par for the course.
I agree with you.  Plus, look at the moves they've already made.  They're moving the spare parts right now.  

Actually, I think they'll probably keep Smith but move Brassard.  There, I don't fully agree with you, this thread can remain un-boring.
> then they go and pull this stunt

I hardly call it a stunt, but OK.  
A lot of people don't like Rachel Homan.  This is just giving them an excuse to pile on.  Adding fantasy scenarios ("she would never have done this in the Scotties!") to make this occasion seem even worse.  

If I were making the call I'd definitely leave the stone, but I haven't "lost respect" for Homan because of it.
> -Karlsson (Retained Salary) to Tampa Bay for Sustr+(Point or Sergachev)+(3 1st round tier assets in picks or prospects)

> -Hoffman stays (For now) 

I think if they trade Karlsson, they're trading Hoffman too.  

> -Ceci to COL for OTT 2018/19 1st Round Pick+Depth Defender 

So they trade Karlsson and Ceci.  Who do they have left on D going forward?

Sounds like you're predicting a full rebuild.
I was being a little facetious with options 1 and 2.  The speculation among many people when the deal was announced was that a buyout is coming as Gaborik's buyout is cheaper than what it would be for Phaneuf.  I don't actually know what the financial / cap implications are for either player, but I trust what I'm reading.  

Again, it's basically another contract / salary-based trade for the organization.  The best case scenario for the team is that they hold onto him and he plays well next year.  
Which is the best quality we can get in Canada; I recorded a couple of airings of DS9 on Space, and the quality there is horrible!  Looks like a re-broadcast of an original feed...the "cut to commercials" title card still says "StarTrek.Msn.Com".  
Oh I'm following now.  NTC + bonuses.
Will admit to not knowing his contract details.  

However since he got traded wouldn't he have had to waive his NTC, meaning it's effectively waived for good?  
This thread is great.  

Anyway, one of three things are going to happen with Gaborik; this list is not in any particular order.  Willing to accept bets as to which is more likely.  

1) Gaborik tears it up from now until the trade deadline.  Senators flip him to a playoff team for picks.  
2) Gaborik tears it up from now until the end of the season.  Senators extend him another 10 years, because the team is results-oriented; Gaborik proceeds to frustrate fan base for remainder of his contract.  
3) Gaborik is bought out at the end of the season.  


Yes, but the arbitration process involves the other side trying to pay him less.  Players know this.  
Lots of places.  Start here: https://www.reddit.com/r/podcasts/search?q=music&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all  

Briefly, there's jamendo.com, freemusicarchive.org, and archive.org.  Be sure to check the license before using.
Same here.  I still experience random freezing, and the latest W10 update won't finish installing, but it runs pretty well otherwise.
I think the team has been a seller more than once, but selling at the deadline !=rebuild, necessarily.
This seems like something fun to track.  I would start, but have been pretty lazy with MFP lately.  In fact I don't think I've weighed myself in a few days, either.  

(Just going through one of those 'I need a break from logging' funks I get every now and then.)
Where are you getting the articles from?  If they're posted as archives from a newspaper, try getting in contact with the content owners and just ask for blanket permission.  Chances are they probably won't object.  But that would CYA legally.  

I don't know the copyright limits for text / articles as well as I do for music, so I can't be of much more help.  

tl;dr: You're probably OK, but I would ask the content owners for permission.

> yet another Senators’ rebuild.

They've really only had one rebuild before, and it was halted prematurely thanks to early positive results.  Not sure this deserves the negative connotation.
I don't think the Canadian women's curling team is disappointing.  

I guess you have different priorities.
I'd say that's not fair use, unfortunately for you.
Not at the moment for podcasts, but the technology is out there to make it happen.
Fair use does not mean using a specific length of a song.  Fair use implies to the context in which it's used.  If you're playing a snippet of a song to support critical discussion (i.e. a music review show) that would be considered fair use - however it is up to YOU to prove that it is fair use.  

In other words, as another person said, if someone came after you with a take-down request you have to comply, and then prove that it's fair use, after which you can put it back up.  Or if you get sued in court (unlikely to happen), you have to prove you have a valid case for 'fair use'.  

There's no provision in copyright law as to whether or not you're making money while using it.
Going to assume a clock appears in the movie. 

Just kidding. My actual assumption is someone worked a flux capacitor in the background.
Positive side in all of this - it won't bother me so much when I can't listen to the home Jays feed on satellite (though my circumstances might be changing soon and I'll have regular access to radio pbp anyway so this point might be moot).  
I think it's because he probably just has way more practice with the colour commentary.  You're talking about the play, rather than describing each action.  I can easily see how without practice someone could be really bad at play-by-play.  The commentary probably comes more naturally to him.  

I know I would likely suck at the play-by-play, but I've never tried it either.
> The Hilarious World of Depression is an interview style podcast where comedians have a fun convocation about their mental heath and the like. The only one I've actually lessened to is with author John Green

It's a really good show, I've listened to almost every guest since Wil Wheaton.  My only gripe with it (and it's a personal, subjective gripe) is that the stories eventually start to blur together and wash over me and I find I don't pay close attention all the time.  I think I might be experiencing an overload, and might take a break from the show.  

But the John Green show was particularly good.
If you want to hear celebrities talk about their struggles, I recommend The Hilarious World of Depression.
Great suggestions!  Thank you :) 
Chewing the blanket, yeah.  

Hadn't thought of a bottle in a sock - she loves chewing socks and bottles, that would be like the best of both worlds for her, haha!  

But yeah...I think she likes chewing fabric-y stuff.  The problem is that she is a very focused chewer.  So if we buy her a toy that's easily chewed, it's done within hours of bringing it home.  

We keep socks away from her but if we have a sock with a hole in it we'll give it to her because she loves them.  She'll at least carry a sock around and chew on it for a few days before it stops resembling a sock.
We use "No" with the blankets all the time, haha!

She does have a pair of blankets that we put in here little pen area (small section of the house that's a bit bigger than the size of a crate, I'd say, and closed off with a baby gate).  She takes those blankets and chews them when she can - lately she's figured out how to get the blankets out of the pen to chew on.  

I would let her do it, but then she wouldn't have any blankets left.  I'm not sure she knows enough to tell what "her" blanket is vs not hers.  

We do have some sprays...haven't needed to spray too much lately but might as well give it another try with the blankets / pillows.
I think the idea is that the discussion centres on a specific film as presented by OP; it's basically a book club, but for movies.  

At least, that's the only difference I can see between /r/movies and the description the OP provides.
Misleading title.  Should have been, "Betty White's marriage ended World War 2."  Though that might be too much clickbait, because in all likelihood it was her honeymoon AFTER the marriage that ended World War 2.
Is this part of the inspiration for when Flight of the Conchords did their [own version of Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Actor_\(Flight_of_the_Conchords\)) in the first season?

> The first half of this article reads like a jealous neck beard thats unhappy that Melnyk did interviews with the bigger national media at Sportsnet instead of with him.

I don't know, it is a little weird that the owner of the **Ottawa** Senators chooses to talk to Toronto media almost all the time ahead of Ottawa media.  

These days, it doesn't take much to take a local story and make it a national piece seeing as how the national media owns most of the local media anyway.  

If you're trying to win back fans, you'd think you'd do it in the city where the team is located.

At least for that one, it most definitely was an aesthetic design choice because the designer had an obsession with 1950's sci-fi aesthetic design.
Either Twitter, or regular column.  I don't follow either when it comes to Garrioch (I usually see his quotes shared here or on some of my other Twitter followers).
That's the asking price, probably it'll come down to the top-ish prospect & second piece.  

But if Dorion can get the asking price for Brassard, I hope that he earns back some of the respect he lost.  That's a really good return for him.

That sounds like something Kirk would buy.
They have every right to be rude to him, just like I have the right to be rude to you (but I won't be).  I think what you mean is, are they justified?  Which is really hard to answer but I would say probably no, their initial reactions were not justified without seeing who he is.
I noticed a delay.  I haven't had too many notifications today though so can't really test it.  

I would say report it to FitBit rather than here though?
There's got to be a bug or something in that listing.  I clicked the link you shared, and I'm seeing 1,820 calories.  

I picked 1 Cup Chopped further down and it corrected to 30 calories.  Picking the original serving size brings it back to 30 calories.  I've never seen this behaviour on MFP.  Have you reported it to MFP?  


Is it really blasting Bowie though? Thought sound didn't travel in space.
Haha thanks. Looks like I have normal cruise control on my vehicle. Slightly disappointed but not the end of the world ;-)
I hear that's the new Vegas logo
This is an immaculate troll job.
Oh good, that fits with most of my walks.
I hadn't heard of this, so I looked it up.  [It sounds really cool](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/01/13/walk-podcast-preview/1026981001/) and is a different take on the produced audio drama.  

How long are the episodes?  Wondering if I can incorporate this into my normal walking routines (or if I need to extend their length / split up listening).
By the way - be sure to drop by /r/podcasts and share your podcast in the weekly episode thread!  (I'm a mod there)
> They were kind enough to give a local callback number, took a minute and reported it to the Ottawa Police - maybe they'll take a minute and have a chat with these jerks.

Probably should be the first thing you mention in posts like this - call the police first, then report to Reddit.  

But often the caller ID numbers are faked; I've received a call from my own phone number before.
Well, and you don't want to raise suspicion by buying them all from one spot.
Yeah I use Fit Notifications all the time with my Charge 2 now (I used to use it when it worked with the Charge HR, before functionality got taken away).  It's pretty great.  I wrote about my set up last week:

Not sure what to suggest. Try contacting João again (surprised you haven't heard from him, he's usually pretty quick to reply). Just in case, paging /u/joaoapps ...
How are the notifications? That seems to be the common complaint I see (though that could be the same person I see complaining about it). Can you control phone audio from the Ionic?
Do you have an RSS feed?  I use Pocket Casts.
The organization seems to make trades / signings based on "what have you done for me lately".  Signing long-term contracts to players who probably deserved them at one point, but are getting them 1-2 seasons too late.  

I don't see a lot of long-term planning involved with the moves that the team makes, unless it's about contract value (while I truly think Duchene is an upgrade over Turris, the basis of the deal was an extra contract year because they weren't extending Turris; Brassard for Zbad also came down to money).  

The head of the organization is Melnyk.  As we've seen he is a pretty impulsive owner, so it trickles down.  

I initially misread the tweet up there as "OK, Hoffman scored a few goals, I think we'll keep him" but that's not the context of the tweet.  

That's pretty much all that I meant.
It's probably in their TOS when signing up.  I shall give it a try and find out.  I'll use your ref code if I'm able.  

Edit: it tells me I have no eligible devices to install it on, so I would say definitely not available in Canada.
This isn't going to help you decide one way or the other about leaving FitBit, but there was a time I considered the Ionic, but now want to get the Gear S3.  Which version do you have? (i.e. Classic, Frontier, or Sport)  How do you like the device itself?  Are its steps / HR monitoring comparable to what you've had with FitBit in the past?  

I also have the Fit & Healthy app, though I find it doesn't seem to sync in the background despite turning it on in the settings (I'm syncing my FitBit stats to S Health right now in quasi-preparation of switching to the Gear 3).   Not a big deal, it handles syncing stuff in bulk pretty well.
Nice, I didn't know that my friend's cousin's pizza delivery man got a job writing sports headlines.

The idea of making my own journal to my own specifications is tempting.  My wife has the ARC system from Staples (I got her the hole punch for Christmas) - I might try it out for my next work notebook.  I've still got Shinola Detroit notebook to use after my current LT1917 runs out (still many pages to go for that).  
It concerns me sometimes how results-oriented this organization can be, but considering who is at the top of the chain, it doesn't necessarily surprise me.  

Edit: I misread the tweet.  My statement still stands, but I left it out of proper context.
I think until Fall 2018.

Edit: the story I initially read about this says "fall".  https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/05/wolverine-the-long-night-is-marvels-first-scripted-podcast/amp/ 
My understanding is that they'll be releasing it to all platforms available in the Fall.

AutoInput has an "unlock screen" option that should take care of this - /u/patatesboy mentioned s/he has no password on the device so this shouldn't be a problem.  

Also shouldn't matter that your saved page is on the home screen, you can just use Browse URL and enter the saved URL after the screen is unlocked.
Have you tried running the diagnostics on the phone / chrome extension to make sure everything is running properly?  I had issues recently, and running the diagnostics helped identify where the problems were & fixed them.

That's my reaction too, but more related to the fact that I'm surprised it hasn't been longer than that. Feels like longer than 20 years.

You can discuss them here!  Just start a thread about it.
Pretty good parody of Serial; the music is spot on.  I found that it wasn't too over the top with the humour, and had a very dry delivery.  

All the episodes are short too, I'm pretty sure I'll get through all 7 episodes today.
I was advocating for Boucher to be let go too, but he seems to have made *some* adjustments. Where he was doing nothing to adapt and hoping things would go okay, that's what had me angry. We'll see what the rest of the season has in store. I doubt he'll be fired before the end of the season.
I'd say the refined version of those uniforms in Star Trek VI are the best.  They're essentially the same, but I feel like they're classed up a notch.
This season reminds me a lot of the 2017 Blue Jays (and now the 2018 Blue Jays). Disappointing season but still plenty of good pieces in place. They sold on a couple of players they could let go of without hurting the future and while they may not be the class of the AL East (hello Yankees), they at least retooled to make a better team than last year. 

I see the same thing for the Senators. They should have a look at some of their better performing depth players and try to move them to playoff teams for prospects (not draft picks). Hold onto the core and focus on making the team better for next year.

This trailer at least made me pause to consider my decision to skip seeing this in the theatres.  Still leaning toward not, but at least now I might be convinced otherwise.  Pretty decent trailer.
For sure it is. The only downside is that now I feel kind of locked in the ecosystem. 

Still, with the way I consume music this is a much better set up than buying CDs / digital albums and managing my music through iTunes.
I got a Surface 3 secondhand in 2016 - feels just about right for that. Agreed that buying it new is a tad late.
Just got an update. Both text fields are identical so I would just search antext and keep it simple. 

[Screenshot. stupid Canadiens. ](https://i.imgur.com/UhoQUbc.jpg)
So I decided to test this out and see what's going on with the notification.  I think the issue is where you're looking for the text. 

For me at least, %antitlebig is "NHL Update".  Have a look: 
[screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/82fGwJg.jpg)

I think you should be checking for `*St. Louis Goal*` in %antext.

Edit: realized actually you're looking at %antextbig ...I'll check again what shows up on next goal. If there is one.
My service provider offers Spotify as a perk. My employer happens to be my service provider as well so I get 50%off. If not for that I'd probably be with Google Play. As it is I pay $9.99 for 3 accounts so Spotify works great for now.
Hahaha! I know the feeling. 

Good luck with your profile :-)
Harold Lloyd silent film Safety Last.
What about still using "~" but adding asterisks - `*St. Louis Goal*` ?  I don't know what the notification looks like but if the problem is that you're looking for a match and it's not finding one, adding wild cards might help.
Hmmm, interesting solution! Something I'll have to play with.
And another follow-up - uninstalling and reinstalling the FitBit app seemed to help matters.  It now seems to be syncing without having the 'Keep-Alive' widget turned on.  Well, sort of.  I just opened it now and the last sync was half an hour ago, but 1) notifications are still going through to my Charge 2, and 2) it synced right away once I opened it, rather than delaying.  It's working well enough for my purposes.
To answer this question, go watch Hot Tub Time Machine.
Did some searching...turns out that they have made some changes to the app that might affect syncing.  It seems most users affected are just 8.0 (seems to be improper use of the background notifications or something - I'm not familiar with that), but I'd say the issues are related.  

https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Android-App/Persistent-Notification-Version-2-65-1/td-p/2481183 
Anyone know of any services / APIs for sports scores?  I know, I can get apps that will give me notifications, and IFTTT can connect with ESPN.  But I feel like Tasker might be a better solution sometimes.  I don't have any specific use-cases in mind right now though.
Yeah, I figured it wasn't after you mentioned it wasn't a newer film.  I've got that one on my list to watch too, I've heard mostly good things about it.
I haven't seen this movie but for a brief second it sounded like maybe you were describing It Follows.
Expos for me mainly, but Angels too.  I never remember him playing for Baltimore.
Not quite.  See my comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/OttawaSenators/comments/7usxus/the_sens_jerseys/dtmv10k/
The league gave them permission to wear them for an additional 7 games - I believe this was game # 4?  

But yes, it seems to be a 99% given that they are going to be using either the black heritage jerseys or something similar to these next year.  Their primary logo everywhere else but the jerseys is the "O" - they were forced into using the current jerseys because of timing issues related to the new league-wide jerseys.
Right!  I thought it was something like that but couldn't remember the wording.

I'm going to go back and read your post in a bit (so it's possible you've tried my solution or trying to do something else), but the immediate solution that comes to mind is using the NHL app.  They have an option in notifications to play your team's goal horn sound when they score.  I haven't tested it out so I don't know if it works (plus, Ottawa hasn't scored very much lately).  

Edit: OK, re-read your post.  I agree with /u/allisio, what you've got should work.  I'm curious to know if you get this to work, let us know!
I think you're confused.  

Canadian Thanksgiving is the second Monday in October, and we do not celebrate American independence at all.  We have a holiday on July 1st (Canada Day).  If July 1st lands on a weekend we get the Monday off, but if it's during the week, we get that weekday off  (which sucks when it's a Wednesday).  
> Did it start after exercising?

Nah, not directly at least.  I think it did start after my last curling game (Wednesday), so then I guess that's probably a "Yes".  

> Make sure your computer screen is at eye level. Get up every hour to stretch and move around for a couple of minutes. Ibuprofen for the swelling. I also personally love CBD oil/gummies for pain and swelling.

I've got back pain.  Let's talk about it!  

Specifically it's my lower back.  I really should go to a doctor to get it checked out (it's off and on) for the exact cause.  

But forgetting the *cause* of it for now.  I'm sure I can't be the only one that deals with back pain every now and then.  What are your best methods of coping with it during the day?  

I had the epiphany today that I probably would be better off using a standing work desk but that's not really possible.  My trade off should probably be to get up and walk around as often as I can.

Can vouch for Drop.  It's super simple to use, and points rack up fast if you pick the right offers.

Clearly they want to know if Maple Leafs hockey puts you to sleep (as it should).
Please don't turn this into another fan-shaming thread...
> Like, even if they are considering it, just lie to me, please.

Soo....as a fan you want the ownership group to lie to you?  I think that's the worst option on the table.
After listening to the full interview, it's pretty clear that Richardson cherry picked that line to create some buzz around the interview.  The full quote itself seemed reasonable to me (paraphrasing, but basically he said that it makes sense to look at everything, but it remains their priority to keep Karlsson).  

People are asking why he doesn't come out and say "Karlsson is not going anywhere."  But what he says is also true - it's not just the team's decision, it's gotta come down to whether Karlsson wants to stay.  Theoretical take: maybe they're not getting strong indications from Karlsson that he wants to stay.  They definitely should be trying to trade him rather than let him walk for nothing.

We don't know what the negotiations are like right now.  I think people are crazy to think that Melnyk / the team are oblivious to the ramifications of losing Karlsson and how the fan base will react.  

And it's true, they can't come out and say "Karlsson is not going anywhere, end of story."  Because there is always that scenario that he doesn't want to stay; I don't believe that they want to trade him to save money.  My feeling on the matter is that the trade scenarios are a "Plan B" if they're forced into a corner.  

Flip side - I do think that they should drop the line of "...but anybody can be traded".  They are saying the right thing in saying that keeping Karlsson is a priority, but they need to lose the "...but" part of that sentence.

What Melnyk is doing right now is what he should have been doing all along - speaking through a PR firm.  They just need to tighten the reigns just a *little* more.
Never heard of the app, checking it out now.  Learning new things even by just reading the app description!  
Thanks. "ADB" was what I was looking for, just couldn't remember the name ;-)
Ah gotcha. Usually I'm outside when I use my activities. 

Still on the fence though, I really don't experience bad battery life. It's 11pm and I'm at 58%. Haven't plugged my phone in to charge all day.
You might be able to do it without the plugin, but I'm not 100% sure. I definitely recommend the autoapps suite either way. Pretty cheap monthly subscription for some fun toys and functionality.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't Google Maps display a persistent notification while in Navigation Mode?  

You could launch a task when that notification appears.  

I don't know anything about night mode vs day mode...that largely depends on sunset times doesn't it?  You could probably do something with that based on available information but I don't think you can get the info of night mode vs day mode from the maps app itself.
> and root.

I don't think you need root to do this.  I haven't tried it, so I can't say for certain, but I thought the point of using AT Secure Settings was that you could perform certain actions w/o root.
Curious, you think a fitness tracker that uses the phone's GPS would suffer in terms of getting GPS data if I lowered GPS accuracy?  

Honestly, I don't worry too much about stretching my battery life anymore, so I have GPS set to high accuracy all the time.  

However if I were to start a workout on my Charge 2, I'd want the GPS to kick in...there's not really any way to force that via Tasker.
Your battery is a removable 3000 mAh vs my S7 edge's 3600 mAh battery...impressive results!

I think I might use your settings as an inspiration for a "work" profile so that when I use my phone less often (i.e. while I'm at work), it focuses on saving battery life like that.  

Edit: currently while working today without any special modifications, I'm at 77%...started my day at ~9am working from home.  So not like I've got it terrible, but sometimes I feel like my battery should be closer to 100 when I don't use it very much ;)
I was briefly focusing on this too.  At first I passed it over, and then I looked at it - what's the point of writing 2k18 vs 2018?  Anyway, glad I wasn't the only one to obsess over it.

I don't know about anyone else but I can still support the team while kind of hoping they don't win. All I want to see is an entertaining game on the ice; what I don't want is to watch an uninterested team doing nothing on the ice. 

Anyway, my real point is you shouldn't tell people how to be fans of the team. The only fake fans showing up are Redditors coming in to troll. 

Don't take the "team tank" stuff too seriously.
Found out today that Hannah John-Kamen is Ghost.  I know nothing about Ghost (beyond what I just read today on IGN) but John-Kamen is pretty great in Killjoys.  I haven't finished watching season 2 of that show yet but I really liked the first season and her role in it.
I'm in the same boat as /u/TVsNoah.  I listen while I work (though not as much as I used to; I used to have the problem of *not having enough*).  I also drive an hour to / from work each day, so there's plenty of time to listen there, too.  

There are still times I fall behind, though, too.  At Christmas I didn't get a chance to listen to very many shows.  When that happens I just get picky in terms of what I want to listen to, and skip episodes that don't seem interesting.  

Sometimes it's not worth worrying about a backlog and just listen to what you feel like listening to.  
Nice, has a noticeable film feel to it. 

If you don’t mind me asking...what is the GCmod? And what kind of edits did you make in snapseed? 

I’m always looking for tips using snapseed. 
We have that one too!
Echoing other people - what kind of show are you looking for? 

Side note - I find it interesting that people are starting to specifically refer to "indie" podcasts; there was a time when corporately owned shows were the minority.
That's a reference to Harold Lloyd and the silent film I forget the name of right now. And Doc's scene at the end is an homage to that as well.

Health + Wellness category: meh.  Nothing really stands out to me, but that's based on my own personal use-case.  Not apps I'd use, but they at least seem like they're well-designed.

Sport + Fitness: The winner (Cadence Coach) looks promising.  Reminds me of the machines I used to use in the gym that would tell you to work harder or slow down based on your pulse for optimal cardio zones.  

Transportation + Local: The winning app looks cool.  Would love to try it out on my father in law's boat.  

Overall...I fear perhaps the quality of the apps is showing the limitations of the Ionic.  They don't impress but they seem neat in their own way!
Is that the "burnt orange / slate blue" Ionic?  I'm looking at getting that one...really like the colour scheme.  It's sold out in stores locally so I'll have to order it online, seems like it's a popular option.
I'm not familiar with syncing between apps and the web interface as I don't use it, so it's possible.
> Also, stitcher sucks. I don’t know if they still do but in the past they’ve taken high quality pods, crushed down the sound quality.

They don't do this anymore.  They switched to a model that delivers the audio as downloaded from the source.
Yep, the reason Netflix works so well (and music subscription services, too) is because it combines what you used to spend a lot more money on collectively (think rentals, movie purchases, etc.) is condensed to one monthly fee that lets you watch unlimited content.  

Podcasts are already free, so there's no real incentive to pay a monthly fee to get content you'd already get for free.  I said in another comment that I like the subscription model for premium content that's over and above the free content, because at that point you're creating new content that wasn't previously freely available.
I think it works as a model for delivering premium content, but not for podcasts in general.  Stitcher Premium is listed as an example - I like their model right now.  You can listen to any show for free (and it doesn't have to be within Stitcher, either), but subscribe to premium and you get extras, including hearing the next episode right away, etc.  

I also posted late last year about a new X-Men serial coming in 2018 - I believe it's coming exclusively to Stitcher Premium early this year, but everyone else gets it in the Fall.  

This kind of model works for me, because I'm fine sticking with the free stuff.  
Gotcha.  I see someone replied to you with what looks like a fix.  

Either way, works fine for me.  You should probably note in your table that it didn't work **for you**, or YMMV or something.  
Let me guess.  You heard it from your friend's cousin's roommate who buys from the same dealer.
Care to expand on what you mean by "claims to but no" for Pocket Casts re: Sync?  

I am able to sync between iOS and Android flawlessly with Pocket Casts.  You have to be logged in to sync, maybe that's the problem for you?  

At first when I set it up I had some issues but now that I have it all working, it's great.  I can pause an episode on one device, and pick it up on another in the same spot once I sync.  

You should probably include Google Play Music and Spotify as they both contain podcasts, even though they are not primarily podcast players.  Also, Stitcher.
It looks good!  Definitely something I'd consider if I get an Ionic.
> It got an 8.1 on IMDb, and a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes.

Should have no bearing on whether or not it gets an Oscar nomination.  

It did get an adapted screenplay nomination; just about the only category I would nominate it for (except maybe for cinematography).  I enjoyed the movie but I don't put it up at Best Picture level.
Indeed, /u/ActualButt.  I don't know what's significant about "47" for the Star Trek writers, I think it's just a number they picked and they throw it in everywhere.  For example, in *Generations* Scotty was able to save **47** crewmembers in the opening scene.  Shields often fall to 47%.  

I don't think there's much to it other than writers just started using it as an inside joke.
Cool - just reporting back the theories I read :) 

In any case, it doesn't matter because we all know it was two Ferengi and a shapeshifter that landed in Roswell.  We don't need NT3 to cover that ground.
I live in Canada and have been to DC once before when I was younger.  I think it would be cool to do a cross-country National Treasure tour - include South Dakota in there to visit Mount Rushmore.  

Definitely would want to see the FBI HQ, I've seen it on TV often enough in various shows!  Throw in Quantico as well to see if a tour of NCIS is in the cards.
I looked this up the other night after they showed both movies on TV; some people theorize that it has something to do with Area 51 - the crash in 1947, page 47...and apparently there are multiple references to it from the characters during the film.  

Honestly before I read all of that, I figured "page 47" was just a writer's nod to Star Trek's constant use of the number 47.
So I ould have been 19 when it came out. OP says he was a kid. Thus I feel old.
How many games in hand does the team have on the teams below?  

(never mind the question, I'm trying to figure out a clever way of reversing the "x points out of the playoffs, x games in hand" for "x points from dead last")
Listening to the pre-game show last night, it sounds like Minnesota needed the win a lot more than Ottawa did - so run with it! :) 
> Personally, I consume some of these sweeteners but my consumption is way below the ADI. I'd say I average one can of diet soda per day, one artificially sweetened protein powder serving, plus two sweetener packets.

Same here.  There are some days where I might have a few cups of coffee with sweetner packets but that's still *well* below the ADI you shared above.  Also don't drink that much diet pepsi / coke zero daily.  

Thanks for confirming that I have nothing to be worried about re: artificial sweetners.
Trust me I know the feeling (I produce a couple shows too)
I charge mine maybe once a week, usually not until it's below 25%. I can't say whether or not this is the case for the Charge 2, but modern batteries are built to handle being charged often. If you prefer to charge it while you shower I don't think there's any harm done there.
When you say English (United States) do you mean US grammar / spelling rules, or only open to US residents?
I don't think it's fair to compare something remastered in HD to something that wasn't; I am pretty sure that the OP is referring to story and writing quality vs just picture quality.
Yup, same here.  Most of the time the "verified" stuff is from restaurants who you can check the info against anyway.
"National Treasure" ... "When I was a kid" 

Sometimes Reddit makes me feel old :-(
I use Pocket Casts, but only because I want to sync between iOS and Android.  It works really well.
Thank you! Pretty sure the iPhone I'm using is running the latest available iOS so I'll check it out.

Edit: worked like a charm.  Built myself a spreadsheet.  Some well-deserving podcasts are going to get a few new reviews this year!
OK, so your problem is still that you're trying to run it with 0 time in between the "FROM" and "TILL".  

Try creating a new variable...I don't know what format %SUNSET is in but maybe set it to %SUNSET+5 or whatever.   Call it %SUNSETEND or something.  

Then it would run From %SUNSET to %SUNSETEND.  Try that first to see if it'll run the task, but I also think there might be a way to get it to run at your specified time rather than as a range.  I'll let someone else chime in because I don't have time to play around with it.
Well, for starters you're going from %SUNSET to %SUNSET.  There's no chance for it to run.  For example if it's 4:15pm you're trying to get it to run from 4:15pm to 4:15pm.  It'll never work.  

Perhaps you meant %SUNRISE to %SUNSET?  

I'm not sure what your profile / task is trying to accomplish...maybe you could elaborate?  Where is %SUNSET assigned?
Thanks for sharing - I didn't know that!  I usually stick with the green checkmarks because I feel like they're more reliable...but I guess that's not always the case.  I'm more concerned about the calorie count though rather than the nutrient information, and usually these entries are calorie-accurate according to the informaiton available.
How big is the cumulative update for 1709? I'm already on 1709 - can't update to the latest version. Have 15gb free.
The one time I'd prefer someone use "resign" instead of "re-sign" ☹️
You're not going to get a goalie from a team who wants to add Karlsson. They need their own goalie if they want to win.
Doesn't seem to help. It's stuck saying "awaiting restart", and no matter how many times I restart - it doesn't finish installing the update.
Filmspotting is a long running movie review podcast if you're looking for that kind of thing. Generally they stay away from spoilers and don't do a lot of analysis unless it's part of a marathon (where they catch up on a specific aspect of cinema - such as the Iranian cinema for example, or a specific director) or a much older film.
No, but I like your alliteration.
Thanks again for your detailed notes. I did some more reading and it seems that HR accuracy is hit or miss with some people. 

Based on your notes, it seems it's not good for weight lifting. I don't do much of that (I do bootcamp twice a week which includes some weight lifting, but not much). 

I think despite some of the reported issues the Ionic sounds like a fit for me (excuse the pun). I am still happy with my Charge 2 but upgrading is tempting.
Thanks for the detailed reply. That's a little concerning that it should take so long to load a podcast. 

Not sure if your second issue would affect me. The first issue would - not sure switching trackers for some exercises makes much sense.  I'll have to research that issue and see if it's common.
I do not - but the other comment suggested to try removing my sd card
I do have an SD card loaded. I'll try removing it - thanks for the tip!
No :-(
Am 33 and have zero skill. Excellent.
The one thing I know is possibly the Samsung Gear S3 (which I mentioned in my OP) - it's built to work with Samsung devices obviously, and Samsung's Health app is fairly robust.
Source: NHL 18.
Always nice to feel wanted.
Maybe I should tweet my phone number to Dorion and he'll call me at 5pm.
I used archive.org until I switched over to paid hosting.  It involves some work-arounds but well worth it.
Thanks for the answer!
Yeah, I see that being an issue.  I wonder if they will eventually move to allowing other methods of payment (i.e. debit/credit, Apple / Android Pay, etc.).
huh?  I said that I do have a Presto card.  And I was asking if the $1.60 tickets needed to be topped up with cash.  

But I am now given to understand that you can bring in old tickets and get the balance added to a Presto card so I'm not worrying about trying to use the old tickets now.  

Incidentally I drive, but sometimes when I'm in town I use the bus.  Not very often, which is why I have leftover tickets.  

Edit: I think I misunderstood your post and you were perhaps asking in general, not me specifically.  
Looks like /u/outdatedopinion is the OP.  This is a crosspost.
Fitness tracker question!  Actually specifically it's a Smart Watch question.  

I'm considering entering the realm of smart watches; I have a Charge 2 right now, and am generally a fan of the FitBit world.  

Anyone have any experience with the FitBit Ionic, or Samsung's Gear S3?  I'd love to hear what you think!  Especially with Samsung's Gear S3 because I tend to think of that one as more of a smart watch than it is geared toward the health tracking aspects.

Thanks :) 
That's what I figured.  I don't even remember how old these ones are.  

The orange tickets are still accepted though?  I would have bought them sometime in the last few months on one of my previous trips in town.
I currently use Pinecast - $5 for the basic tier.  

I've also used Zencast in the past, which is $14 (AUD) for their basic tier, but you get more robust stats than Pinecast gives you.  

The trade off is Pinecast gives you an unlimited amount of podcasts for $5; Zencast has an unlimited tier, but it's at least $10 more than the first tier I think.
Ohhhhhh

> There's a new AutoInput beta, and it includes an new action to turn the screen on or off without locking or un-locking it 
Actually, it's the opposite - when I first started I posted twice weekly, and I had tons of content.  However lately I've not felt as creative so I needed to cut down how often I was posting to once a week.  This is why I want to schedule out my posts so I don't run out ;) 

I might consider some shorter pieces in between the scheduled posts though.  But yeah, generally I tend to also get busy so having a backlog scheduled as my goal is to combat against forgotten weeks where I don't write anything.
Gotcha.  Well, I figure because the movie is constantly out there, the conversations about it probably never die either.  
It's on TV almost all the time.  Just yesterday the Paramount Network (formerly Spike, formerly TNN) had it on during the day.  It might be 23 years old, but it's constantly available.
I only just saw Logan this week; while I enjoyed it a lot, I think it would really only qualify for technical awards rather than the bigger ones. It doesn't stand out to me like a typical "awards" movie does.
"More for D'Ghor!"
Not sure if you seriously meant to imply McDonalds is local business...I mean technically if it's just franchise locations I guess this is true.
Well, the logo for one. I know you didn't design it, it was originally released as a secondary logo 11 years ago and was never fully utilized. 

I think the laurels don't quite work either, and the colours seem a bit "off" to me. Hard to describe exactly, but suffice it to say I'm just not a fan. I don't actively dislike it but I wouldn't go out and drop money on one of these if the team were to announce these as the new jerseys.

Edit: actually I will say your first concept works, except for the logo. I'd rather see an O there or the original centurion.
I'm not a fan of these. Nice presentation though.
Thanks for finding that!  I'm not the OP, but I've been curious about the musical but could never find a reference to it.  Must not have looked in IMDB hard enough.
I think what /u/TheShadyGuy is saying, which is what I'm saying, is that it seems likely that Quentin's statement about only doing 10 movies is probably just something he said and will go back against.  Whether it's digital or shot on film makes no difference, really.
That's putting a lot of stock into believing that he'll stop at 10 films.
I agree, I just mean that most media sources are going toward video because that's what generates advertising revenue online these days.  

Spotify is very much in the visual space what with them incorporating genius lyrics for newer songs.  

I'm not sure of the play for doing that, because often I don't have Spotify open and staring at it while I'm playing music.  Who knows what the long term goal here is.


Because video is king when it comes to content.  This bugs me, since I prefer reading articles than watching a video (when a headline has video only with no article, I skip it).  

But without reading the article, based on the quote above along, "...more easily skip between different stories and topics..." - sounds like something similar to what Apple tried before with Enhanced Podcasts.  

I remember listening on my ipod to CBC Radio 3 podcast - they had basically a click-able track listing with album artwork showing for the artists they played, etc.  

If Spotify can do something similar that would be neat.
Listen to more podcasts!  Have a look through the subreddit for suggestions, there are tons.  I bet if you search for 'Dan Carlin suggestions' or something you might find something that way.  
Did you mean to share this in a music subreddit maybe?
If you want to do it, just do it.

For what it's worth, there are at least a few others out there.  I don't follow them so I couldn't give you any names to look up.
\*whispers\* I leave my wifi on all the time
No such thing as "running a yellow", since yellow only means to stop when it's safe to do so. It's more of a warning that the lights are about to change so maybe don't drive through.

That said, I think I agree with you - so many times cars have plenty of time and room to slow down to a stop when the light turns yellow, but they just keep going. Because everybody is in a hurry.

And as for left turns...yup.  I believe this is also what causes people to do illegal uturns on a red light, or jumping ahead in the intersection just before the lights turn green (when there's no advance green at the intersection).
Not sure if the OP did this, but you can list your postal code on your Kijiji posting. I don't think there's an area for an address though. But with a postal code you could narrow down at least the neighbourhood.
OP, if you're looking for smaller podcasts from people in the sub, check out the weekly episode threads.  

Rather than have this be a space for advertising your own podcast, why not suggest something you listen to that fits OP's request?  
> resign Karlsson

**re-sign**

We need a bot to flag this.  Resign means to quit.  Unless you want to drop Karlsson, I don't think you meant to write that.
Me too!  Though less regularly.  However I was pleasantly surprised to find out that some of the Wii Shop is still supported - I was able to install Netflix (had to hook it up to a 4:3 TV for reasons...blessing in disguise that the Wii was never an HD machine).
Well to be fair, isn't that how most people played Star Trek at home?
Podxiety maybe?  

But no, I don't worry too much about episodes piling up.  As /u/louiseber said if I get too far behind I just delete episodes where the subject matter doesn't hold my interest as much.  There are some episodes / shows that I will listen to their entire backlog no matter what; but others I will just mark as read and move on.  

The Christmas/New Year's holidays really put some of my listening behind, but I am pretty well "caught up".
This design keeps popping up and I still don't like it. It's not the centurion - it's the rest of the design itself.
Cool, I saved this post for later and will come back to it but I am totally okay with you guys running this, I'll just sticky threads.
If you guys wanted to put a weekly post up I can sticky it - Thursdays work for you? We don't really have anything lined up on those days. 

Send a modmail with any other suggestions and we can do something. I wanted to do something for listeners, this fits the bill.
Do you have it set up via wordpress.com?  It's because they want you to buy their own hosting packages which includes a personal domain.  On the other hand, Blogger allows you to use any domain you want for free.
Glad you mentioned McDonald's.  When you order on their in-store kiosk, they DO give you a break down of the calories on the screen.  Why they can't put that on the paper receipt is beyond my comprehension.  

I like your mock-up - could probably be made a little neater to read but otherwise looks good.
How generous!  Haha.  Thanks for sharing the code, either way!
Haha.  Or my podcast doesn't have a rank ;) It's not very popular.
Hmm...my URL doesn't seem to work.  I get an error.  It's possible I've got the wrong feed I suppose?  

`=IMPORTXML(“https://itunes.apple.com/ca/rss/topaudiopodcasts/limit=200/genre=1310/xml”,”count(//*[local-name()=’entry’][contains(.,’Alternative Airwaves’)]/preceding-sibling::*)”)-7`

It says "formula parse error".
Thanks for posting this!  Do you know where genre numbers are listed?
Thanks!  Had a quick browse through some of your posts.  Good stuff!
Care to share your URL?
Thank you!!  I activated it on my blog.  I especially like the way it displays the categories.  Been looking for something like this for a while.
Has anyone in Canada ever found these in a brick & mortar retail store, or are they only available online?
What WP theme are you using? I really like your layout.
Sometimes I browse and pick a podcast based on its cover art (cover art is important!) and name.  If it sounds intriguing, I'll give it a shot.  

Other times people recommend something I've not heard of before and I check it out, or I hear about something coming down the pipe.  

For me it's largely organic in nature.
Cool, thanks for sharing! I'll look into some of these.

You're not the first person I've seen mention the nosleep podcast. What's that one about?
Try to mute and sync your tv with the radio feed. Only works if you have a pvr and can pause live tv.
Which one would you say is your favourite? If you can't name one, what are your top 5? Some unfamiliar names to me on your list, would love to learn more about some of them.
We do have link flair activated but we only just turned it on. Work in progress.

And I think the toxic reaction is toward the attitudes espoused by the OP. No one is opposed to talking about content. The OP came in here writing a PSA saying "this sub is meant for this, you guys not talking about this should go away." Pretty much a recipe for toxic reactions. 

Threads about podcasts (i.e. not shop talk) don't get aggressively downvoted. They just don't get upvoted much. I don't have any stats for you (mookler is better for that stuff) though.

My opinion is that it doesn't make any sense to split the sub. It also doesn't make any sense to tell a certain segment to go away and start their own sub. 

The best solution is for people to post about what they want to see. Instead of lamenting that there aren't enough content posts, make more. 

I really don't buy the excuse that new users are intimidated. It's the internet. No one's ego is getting hurt here.
You could do this with Tasker (or likely other similar automation apps) I'm sure.
This won't solve it for you but have you tried tracking it via Google Sheets?  You could create an interface via Tasker and send data to Google Sheets automatically for you.  Heck even simpler I'm sure there's a way to set it up with IFTTT.  

To get you by until someone creates a full app experience, that might help.
Someone already suggested headphones, but a nice Bluetooth speaker would be great too imo. Maybe merch from their favourite podcast?
Car and at work. Occasionally at home, but usually I listen in those two places.
> Instead of cracking down on the shop talk podcast I think mods should crack down on these ones. I’ve answered so many true crime recommendation threads that I have a copy and paste in my notes with a list of them.

Here's the thing about reddit (and any type of internet forum); no matter how many previous threads there are about a subject, people never, ever use the search function.  I'm only a mod here, but I see the same thing come up in /r/Ottawa.  People lose their minds every now and then and create a call out thread saying "stop posting the 'looking for...' threads and use the search!".  The idea being that someone else has likely already asked the same question, so searching will give you the answer without having to create a new, repetitive post.  

But it doesn't work.  

1) Search is not a prominent feature on mobile, which is where a large majority of users come from.  Similarly this is why relying on Sidebars for rules is not a good idea.  

2) In general, people feel like the information in a search might be dated; that maybe some things have changed.  Sometimes this is true, sometimes it isn't - depends on the subject matter.  

3) You suggested a sticky thread - in theory, a good idea.  But just as much as people don't use the search function, they tend not to look at what's already posted before jumping in and creating their own thread.  

(By the way, I'm not attacking you or your suggestion, or trying to say that we shouldn't implement any of what you're suggesting.  I think adding more listener-themed sticky threads is a good idea and will try to make some - but I'm just outlining some realities explaining why we will never get rid of people asking for the same show recommendations or what gear to use.)  

Edit: also, subreddits are only allowed two sticky threads.  So having a sticky thread for each genre is unfortunately not feasible.  Many of the active mods don't have access to the wiki or CSS so that's why those things are not updated too quickly.
Honestly, I don't think I would use one of these for a bullet journal - I still have more than half my current leuchtturm to fill up, and then I have a Shinola Detroit notebook lined up next.  

But I've been using a lined moleskine for work lately, and almost wondering if I wouldn't mind using something A4+ in size for work...thanks for the input re: paper weight!  Very good to know.
OK but they're not ignoring the prequels is all I'm saying.
> First off, Lucasfilm is now highly allergic to the prequels, so no Mustafar

Mustafar appears in Rogue One though...
RSS feeds are essentially free; where you need to pay is for hosting costs.  If you sign up with a podcast hosting service they will take care of the RSS feed for you - to make it easier to distribute your podcast.  
Any particular A4+ notebook you'd recommend? 

Edit: a word.
This is the only thread I've found by search about the new profile overview - I find it hard to find posts that need to be approved.  In /r/podcasts the automod bot removes posts for low-karma users, which is usually new users; but when you go to their overview page the comments look like they are already approved.  In fact, the only mod button that appears says "remove".  

Anyone else come across this?  I'm fine being forced to the new profile overview, but it's next to impossible to find posts that need approval.
Still a work in progress but in response to a question to the mods we implemented link flair.  If people submitting used link flair more regularly you could filter out the posts you don't want to see.  

Like I said though - still a work in progress.  The majority of threads don't have flair attached.
/r/movies is different from /r/filmmaking (I don't know if that sub exists, but it probably does) because whoever is running it decided that /r/movies should be about discussing films.  Big surprise, the movie industry is a lot larger than podcasting and there are more movie fans than movie makers.  Same goes for Television.  

This sub is geared for both, and clearly says so in the side bar.  The mod team does its best to keep the self promotion to a minimum so that it's not just about "listen to my show!", but has actual discussion on both sides of the coin (listening & producing).  

Thank you for your input.  

Edit to add: Despite the prevalence of podcast in media lately, and of larger media companies producing podcasts, it's still a hobby medium.  This is why you're always going to have people in this sub talking about making podcasts and asking questions.  If you took that away from the sub, it would be VERY quiet.  If you want to discuss podcasts and shows you listen to, start a thread!  Be the change you want to see.
I use Google Keep and Samsung Notes but not extensively. Keep is great because I can take notes via Google Assistant while I'm driving. I think you could use it alongside calendar effectively.
Maybe a week and a half when I use it extensively I guess? But yeah I really stretch the battery out. 

I don't use the exercise function a lot, and I only have it set to alert me for phone calls. Sometimes I use alarms but mostly I just wear it on my wrist and let it be.
> Edit: And just saying OK Google, even with the music blasting, to control the phone is pretty cool.

Whoa - so you don't need to press the button on the steering wheel to activate the Assistant?  I learned something today.
I just bought a 2018 vehicle and I've been using Android Auto nearly every day.  Pocket Casts works amazingly well (so much so that I've created new filters so I can more easily choose episodes to listen to) with it.  I dare say that I probably would plug my phone in 100% of the time while driving.  Probably not for shorter distances within the city, but I figure it will probably be plugged in and using Android Auto 80%+ of the time.  
Yes and no.  I find that writing things out daily on paper works best for me, but occasionally when I don't have anything nearby I use my phone's resources for reminders or memos.  I don't usually transfer these to paper, though.  

I use Google Calendar all the time.  I will take THESE events and put them into my analog journal, though.  Google Calendar is amazingly helpful so I'd recommend using that with your digital portfolio.  

Sorry I can't be of more help to you!
Similarly I've been really impressed with the FitBit battery on the Charge 2.  I go weeks without having to charge it.  They must have put a lot of work into battery life with their new devices.
> I moved back in May, but some of my family still can’t clue in to the fact that I no longer live there. 

This is the number one reason I buy Canada Post's mail forwarding service for moving.  You can do 6 months or a year - they automatically forward anything sent to you at your old address, to your new address.  
There have been "hints" at this all season long (such as the O logo appearing on all official publications, at centre ice, etc.).  ;)
Just listening to the end of an episode of The Hilarious World of Depression - the episode with Jenny Lawson.  
Thanks for doing the math!  I didn't look at any numbers in proposing my theory.
Theoretically speaking, wouldn't the effect of removing the buses be the same as what the city faces on days like this anyway?  Buses are frequently cancelled & run late, causing delays, etc.  Effectively the buses are removed from service already, so the service would be the same.  
This is why often I price an item above what I'm expecting to get for it, knowing full well people offer below the asking price.  Usually I get the price that I'm *actually* looking for this way.
Upvote pity party, basically.
It's Happening®
His number is 69 right?
I only log via FitBit so I don't have that issue. I have noticed that when I log a workout via FitBit (e.g. I press and hold my button for a walk, or bootcamp) it will list those calories separately and doesn't include them in the Fitbit Calorie adjustment totals. It just keeps them as a separate exercise.

Edit: I just reread your comment. I think we are doing the same thing, but for some reason my device / set up doesn't double dip. I have a Charge 2 - what are you using?
I honestly think it depends on the bluetooth device.  Most that I've run into have volume control independent of the phone media volume.  Two I'm using right now work that way: the JBL Charge 3 and my car's bluetooth system (uses Chevrolet's MyLink).  

The only devices I've seen that control media volume with the device controls are the Samsung headphones that came with my phone.  And they're not BT.
> Keep in mind that "sedentary" still includes a basic amount of movement. FitBit doesn't account for that when it adds calories into your allowance. From your very first step in considers you to be burning calories.

I'm not sure what you mean by this.  FitBit's calories burned include everything - BMR + activity.  FitBit sends it all to MFP; on MFP's side, they have an equation that essentially separates your BMR from your activity calories, and uses that as your exercise calories in MFP.  If you're not moving enough compared to what MFP projects, then they give you a negative adjustment if you have it enabled.  

Here's my day so far as an example:
[Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/BcR6qWj.png)  

I've burned 2718 calories; MFP thinks I should have burned 2637 so far today; so I've only gained 81 calories that I can eat back if I want to.
Also note that "do not eat the calories you burned in exercise" isn't the only answer.  Some people choose to eat back some of them and it works.  

The reason I like to keep my exercise calories from FitBit synced to MFP is that if I'm not active enough, MFP *subtracts* calories from my goal, meaning I have to eat *less* than my daily goal.  I usually try to avoid eating back my calories, but I'm also OK with having a bit of a buffer zone.  My weight trend is downward overall so I know I'm doing the right thing for me.
> Now to figure out the cleanest way to actually close the apps. Kill Apps doesn't seem to work

You could always try "Go Home" (also found under 'apps').  Sure, it doesn't technically close the app but Android memory management is much better so leaving an app open like that isn't the worst thing in the world.
Plowing doesn't absolve drivers of their responsibility to drive according to conditions, just as driving according to conditions doesn't negate the need for plows.  
I remember having a discussion once re: baseball players getting significantly more injuries than hockey players; the crux of their argument (that hockey players are tougher / more susceptible to injury) was that the sport itself is much tougher because of all the hits, etc.  However I maintained that baseball players, despite the "softer" sport, get far more serious injuries (in relation to how it affects their career or ability to play) because of all the intricacies and moving parts involved in baseball.  

What's my point?  That I agree with you - it's not just about how hard you get hit, there are other things involved with getting injured in hockey.  His ability to stay injury-free has nothing to do with what size players are hitting him.
Yeah, so that's where you'd want to indicate a specific bluetooth device in the 'bluetooth connected' screen.  Like so...

[Bluetooth Connected](https://i.imgur.com/eVW49zD.png) 

I think I usually just use the device name, but I think the one I was using for this was unpaired so the name was removed.  Or maybe I just used the address - either way, if you use the magnifying glass you can pick the device.  

That way your profile only activates / exit task fires when Bluetooth is connected to THAT device.  If it's another device that's connected then nothing will happen.  
No problem!  I just got some alarm tasks back up and running, your post inspired me to play around with them again ;) 

I'm starting from scratch though, building them back as I go.  Not sure why my previous tasks were broken, but they work fine brand new!
I would also say that one tournament is not a good way to judge a player.  

But most of the sub will think that way.  Drake Batherson is the next chosen one if you believe some people.
Currently they're tooling around, they should be at least re-tooling.
That does seem more straightforward - thanks!  Something to play around with.  You think that something similar might work with say, Pocket Casts?  

Edit: referring to the "android.intent.action.SEARCH" for pocket casts.
You're The Best - from Karate Kid. I think it might even be the same artist? I can't be sure (or bothered to look it up right now).
That would be ideal.  I was definitely a fan of what the Leafs did to shed salary / make smart deals.  
Is that a specific tasker profile / task that you set up?  i.e. to search Spotify, you need Tasker to do it?  I know that there is some Tasker / Spotify compatibility via AutoWeb.  Is that what you're doing there?
> Sometimes when it opens the Sirius XM app it doesnt begin playing. I assume this is because it is paused from the last time it was closed. **Clicking "Go Live" gets it back to live radio and starts to play again. Anyway to automate that?**

Do you have AutoInput?  That would solve this issue for you easily.  Your screen would need to be on, I believe.  

> Is there a way to automatically close Sirius and Android Auto when I turn my car off (so, when it disconnects from bluetooh)? I still want to be able to manually turn them back on when not connected to bluetooth, so I can't just do a "when not connected", right? I tried doing an invert BT Connected state, but that didn't seem to work either.

You can specify which bluetooth device you want your profile to react to.  It's an optional field so might be why you haven't used it.  
Cool - what data would that be? Basic stuff like it's at fill-up? Guessing you don't need to specify date as that's done automatically.
OP's father's colleague. Just about the same as "my friend's cousin's brother". I would tend to agree with you.
Hey there!  I have *sort of* a helpful reply for you.  

So there is no FitBit Tasker plugin, but if you have the AutoTools suite you can use AutoWeb to tap into the FitBit API.  Check out http://dev.fitbit.com to get an API key.  

A year ago I created a weekly task that tracked my FitBit km's walked to track my progress to Mordor.  

I also at one point had alarms set on my FitBit from Tasker based on calendar events; but I haven't had much use for that lately.  I might pick that one up again.  

Try a search in /r/tasker for FitBit - undoubtedly you'll see one of my threads show up.  Unfortunately I don't have any direct links handy right now.  I'm not currently using Tasker / FitBit together so don't have any good ideas for you. 

Edit: here are a couple links I found that might help:

Haha!  That's pretty clever!

Thought desktop was $9.99?  
I enjoyed Looper but Brick was the other Rian Johnson film I didn't particularly like / get.
Yes, but I think what you said about Melnyk being "too drunk in Barbados" to approve the deal is the large leap here.
> So basically Dorion couldn't get a hold of the Euge who was probably drunk somewhere in the Barbados. Love this team.

That's a large leap.  But it's also on Edmonton - they could have waited for Ottawa to get clearance but they didn't.  How long was this period of waiting?  

Definitely requiring Melnyk's clearance hindered the deal but it's not all on Ottawa's side...
Where does this even come from?  I don't recall gleaning that information from any of the usual sources.  

Edit: Woops.  I saw a few posts down it *just* came out.  Carry on.
Or, just listen to the soundtrack if you weren't interested in the movie?  (:
cool, thanks!  I have a long drive coming up so was hoping to play with that feature.  

Related note...automatic high-beams - is that a switch-activated feature as well?  I was using high-beams last night but didn't trust that it would deactivate them for oncoming traffic so I was still manually turning them on / off.
The only gap related switch on the wheel that I see is the centre button, which toggles the forward collision alert distance (far / medium / near) - there's a blank button spot but I haven't found in the manual what that one is supposed to be when it's equipped. It's the button spot above the lane keep assist button. 

But thanks for the heads up re: codes, I'll have a look for that.
Wednesday night is usually a national Sportsnet game. I was surprised last week to see the game on TSN, not the other way around.
Yeah. Went with buying it again (tried the official Apple app for a bit but I'm not a fan. The sync between devices for pocket Casts is great
I'm confused. You linked to something called Captain's Chair which is what the person pointed out to you?
Try movies or games or apps or books.
Haha! For me it's movies or books (usually comic books that I catch up on).
Good to know but honestly I go through my balance fairly quickly anyway.
Yeah, that's what I assumed. Re-alignment really only needs to be done if you're experiencing problems either with wear or maybe your car veers to another direction than it should (although at that point your alignment has to be quite bad doesn't it?).
I'm assuming you have a truck? Or larger tires? Either way - you know what you're asking for when you're replacing tires it sounds like. 

In general most mechanics will recommend replacing 2 or 4 at a time but if they run into someone like you they would probably be in agreement with you. 

Luckily for me I have found two very good mechanics in two different towns so I'm happy. I trust their recommendations. Also, they aren't too expensive.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.  Only once have we had to replace all four tires due to one tire dying spectacularly, but the other three didn't have great life left in them.
> He insisted I needed a wheel alignment because of uneven wear on one of the older tyres and that you needed one every 6 months. I had gotten a wheel alignment a few weeks beforehand.

Yeah, that part is most definitely a load.  I don't think you need an alignment done every 6 months.
Well, can't say anything about the battery but it's generally recommended to replace all tires at the same time if you need to replace one. I suppose the middle ground would be to replace at least two. 

The alignment would be necessary with new tires too.
I'm not talking about not sending out TIEs but the impression I got was basically the dreadnaught being unable to effectively fire on the x-wing was analogous to it being hard to shoot someone with a rifle when they're right in front of you throwing punches.
I saw a twitter update - apparently two of the hosts both have newborns and that's pretty much what has been holding them up from recording new episodes.  Let me see...

Ah yes - [here is their update from Dec 27](https://twitter.com/GoodJobBrain/status/946119511270309888).
> And the last jedi takes this to comedic proportions with Poe going solo vs a dreadnaught.

They addressed the fact that their guns were not meant for close quarters - they couldn't shoot at Poe because he was too close.  

But also they addressed the attack on the dreadnaught on the Resistance side because it was a massive failure and they lost a lot of people.
You could be right.  

Also I'm surprised he didn't destroy the TIEs that killed his mother (assumed at that point that she was dead after all) out of anger.  He clearly wasn't ready to pull the trigger.
> he’s saving Ben from killing his mother, from going another step beyond "too far." He saves Ben from killing his uncle by force-teleporting. 

This might be addressed in the comments - I haven't seen yet.  But does Ben know that Leia is still alive?  
These questions were pretty loaded.
I have a monthly calendar (basically, list of dates with important things written beside them) and I fill it out daily as needed. Usually to-do items, but I also note down where I'm working (e.g. from home or in the office), what I'm doing that day, and if I happen to think of anything to note down. This month I've been using a very basic habit tracker - I have four things I'm keeping track of and they have a score of 1 (or 2 for something I'm doing twice in a day). On the 15th I added up my scores to see how I was doing. 

The score part of it is fun but to be honest, the simple fact that I'm keeping track of it is what's most helpful for me to keep up with the habit. It's writing it down every day that cements it for me, not putting it in a fancy graph and colouring it in. Not that I'm disparaging people who do that; it just doesn't work for me. :-)
I am a dude, but probably not a *cool* dude.  

I'm not very artistic with my journal - it's mostly functional.  I've dabbled here and there out of boredom but primarily I use it to keep myself organized.
Yeah...I have a Surface 3 that's *new to me* but bought second hand.  I don't think anywhere close to me sells anything but the new Surface Pro, and *maybe* the Surface Pro 4.
Reminds me of something I saw recently that I want to try - redacted newspaper poetry.  Definitely something that I can throw onto one of my journal pages.
The First Duty was great too.  

I wish he had a better exit than Journey's End though.
> I think Wil Wheaton is taking this a bit too seriously. It's a joke

It's also not a very good joke.  

Get strangers telling you to shut up and laugh at you all the time, maybe you'll have a different opinion about it.
I'm not a religious watcher of the show but I would say "referring to someone in the past tense" is not a definite indication of their vital signs ;) 
Yup, just left a comment saying basically the characters have a magic ability to shake off being drunk when they need to drive.
They still seem to drink and drive a LOT on Gilmore Girls.  The worst episode for this however is the one when Luke & Lorelei go to dinner (for the first time I think? it's when they get all the insurance horror stories) and they've both clearly established that they're basically drunk.  And yet they drive home.  

The characters on Gilmore Girls seem to have the uncanny ability to shake off being drunk when it's convenient (i.e. driving), but not when it's inconvenient (i.e. when Lorelei has her embarrassing moments expressing her love for Luke).
>  This isn’t commercial radio or tv. I would think most podcasters are able to use sound judgement about reasonable promo length when putting together or deciding to air a promo.

That's the thing - *because* it isn't a professional medium such as TV or Radio, most podcasters don't actually know what sounds good.  Case in point - OP wants a max 90 second promo.  That's 1:30.  As a listener, do you really want to listen to someone advertise their show for 1:30?  That's a *long* time.  

As I said earlier, above - the max should be 30, aiming for 15.  

But when it comes to show promos, podcast creators tend to get a bit overzealous and over-produce, which leads to long, unlisten-able promos.  

Edit: My bad - the max in the original post is 60 seconds.  1:00 promoting a show is still far too long.
Recommendation for you - keep the promos to a shorter length.  30 seconds should be your max, not 60, but 15 seconds would be ideal.
More than likely you also changed other aspects of your diet - I don't think it was *just* the Green Tea.  You have to take a look at what else you changed when you started drinking green tea.  

And are you drinking the green tea black?  What did you drink before?  

It's not safe to assume that it was the green tea that caused the weight loss or burned extra calories - you might struggle later on and not know what you're doing wrong because "green tea is supposed to help burn calories!"
It's magic.
> Green tea is very helpful for dieting, not only it hydrates you; it helps you burn calories more.

This seems to be a very unscientific claim here.  

I don't think green tea has any magical properties that water doesn't have so I'll stick with water.  I do enjoy green tea when I'm under the weather, however.  It's just not my cup of tea (oops - somewhat unintended pun).
I see this so many places - people are wrongly assuming net neutrality is the evil thing, not repealing it. 

But to OP - the common people of the USA did not vote to repeal.net neutrality anyway...that was made by the FCC who do not get voted in by anyone. 

I don't think RPO being released earlier would have any influence over Ajit Pai.
Ah, the comic itself is *Captain America: Steve Rogers*. Thanks for the link :-)
Oh yeah, I remember seeing that reveal. What series is that one in? Wouldn't mind taking down the issues.
I don't know much about the comics but I've seen many rumblings about Sebastian Stan (Winter Soldier) taking over as Captain America. Partly because he signed onto a large amount of Marvel movies. But there is a comic story line about the death of Captain America, so it's possible they go that route somewhere in the movies too.
Oh geez. I'm pretty sure I've had at least one sleepover in that church as a member of Beavers/Cubs. Always a mainstay next to Merivale Public.
Crazy as it sounds driving under the influence was a much bigger problem too. It's still a problem but people are more into looking for alternatives to getting behind the wheel.
We all assume he had a Mrs. Claus; but if the Mrs Clause was forgotten until 8 years after Scott Calvin became Santa, who's to say there even *was* a Mrs. Claus?
Some people are only just catching on.
> Anyway, you can be sure that you can't be wrong with plain water 

That much is true.
Hmm, OK.

> Weight gain and obesity are driven by hormones-in everyone-and only by understanding the effects of insulin and insulin resistance can we achieve lasting weight loss. 

While I believe that this is true - that there are many variables that make it hard to control your weight - weight loss is the science of consuming fewer calories than you burn.  

Anyway, I think you missed my point; when you said "When have you seen a thin person with a Coke Zero?" stripped any credibility out of your post.  As far as studies confirming zero calorie drinks make you fat - I don't put a lot of stock into any of these studies about artificial sweetners.  Why?  Because there are conflicting studies every time.  Some say there are no adverse health effects, while others insist that there are.  There has not been a single conclusive study done to show adverse health effects.  

The description of the book sounds very gimmicky as well, in my opinion.
...that doesn't sound remotely credible.  Especially the last sentence.  

Nice try.
Oh good, perhaps you can related it to me?  Any joke there is purely unintentional I assure you.
> For the timing, do they say in the movie it's been 8 years? Yes obviously Charlie is grown and a lot has changed, but I've always thought that was more movie magic, and it's really just the year following.

It's pretty clearly established that Charlie is in high school, and his ex and Judge Reinhold have a young daughter together.  

Maybe the clause doesn't get triggered if someone hadn't found it.
OP is using an existing podcast (Side Hustle School) and posting their own channel on YouTube.  I don't believe this account belongs to Chris Guillebeau.
http://dev.fitbit.com probably has all the documentation needed.
NPR probably pays for a license.
I doubt that would fly as fair use. Review / commentary would put it closer to fair use territory.
Phillips / Volchenkov
My guess on what happened with Anna/Jess' Step-mom is that the episode where she appears was a back-door pilot to what was supposed to be a spin-off.  The spin-off never happened, but they probably liked working with the actress, so found a role for her later as Anna Nardini.
This is the second comment that maybe leads me to believe people are misreading what I'm saying.  I don't think the Sens will make up the ground that they've lost - they're too far back.  Mathematically possible, but not probable in practice.
iTunes isn't a podcast host. I get what you're trying to say though.
Ha, cool! The dev should try implementing the Fitbit API, it's super easy and free.
Yeah, different problem if we're talking a few points here and there, but 10 is a lot of ground.
Right above the form:

> We will only use your email address to notify you that registration has opened and not for Loblaw customer marketing or any other purpose, unless you have already given us your consent to do so. 

So if you've previously given them consent to use your email for marketing purposes, nothing changes.  If you haven't given them consent to use your email for marketing purposes, nothing changes.  
>  She was then given a recurring role on the popular Canadian sketch comedy series Kids in the Hall, on which Star Trek: Voyager guest star Scott Thompson was a regular performer. On this series, de Boer usually played Laura, the girlfriend of the angst-filled teenager Bob, played by Bruce McCulloch.

I had no idea!  Loved Kids in the Hall.
When I first got my FitBit I used Tasker on Android integration to track my progress.  That was fun!
Your best bet would be to source a blanket license that would allow you to pay a fee to play those songs.  

This is what radio stations do - they don't need to pay for each individual song.
Awesome!  I've forgotten about doing anything about this.  
I'm not suggesting it's impossible but it is improbable. Yeah, 10 points back with 50 games to go sounds like it's really doable.  But the other teams are still playing too.
You can record in stereo and have the L & R channels balanced. In effect it's the same as mono, but gives you a bit of a nicer sound. 

I agree with the above though, I often listen with one ear bud. Would miss out on one channel completely.
I think in the spirit of the NC attribute, you'll be fine.  I believe that attribute is specifically referring to creating content with the purpose of selling it / making a profit.  

I would talk to the owner of the music and ask them about it directly; but I think generally the idea is that if you were to use the music for commercial purposes (e.g. an advertisement, or something you're trying to sell), that's when you would seek out licensing from the original artist.   

Edit: here's some more information about the Creative Commons definition of commercial purposes: "...primarily intended for commercial advantage or monetary compensation."  Their FAQ: https://creativecommons.org/faq/#does-my-use-violate-the-noncommercial-clause-of-the-licenses
Honestly I'm not the greatest source to answer your question, but I would say no.  While I don't think Hoffman would take a king's ransom, I think it would definitely start with a Top pairing D as losing Hoffman would hurt more than what the team would gain by adding on defense.  I'm saying that even though I think Hoffman is probably the most available forward on the team.  

I *think* they would need someone to play LD immediately rather than a prospect as well.  

It would definitely be interesting to see the Stone brothers on the same team though.
They really need some help on D with Boroweicky (excuse the spelling - I don't know it off the top of my head and not looking it up) out.  I don't know how far away he is, but they're also missing Methot.  

I honestly don't think that offense is a problem - well, I mean, it *is*, but that's related to the system they're playing.  I think they have the offensive talent to score goals, they're just having some trouble.  

Other than that, I think they're otherwise just trying to shake things up.
Translation:  

"Spicy-sounding tweet that is actually very generic, but worded in a way that sounds like I have some insider information."
Thanks!  That worked for some of them - I'll try a different computer later.  

As for Sears, this happened the last time too and they changed it eventually.
Canada has Sears again...no swagbanner to click.

I've already had multiple stores fail to work on the swagbanner (it comes through as clicked already).  

Fun times.
You'd think Melnyk might take some cues from his quasi boss
The thing is, not all government employees might be Sens fans or wanting to go to a sens game. You can't make any kind of blanket statement about how the payroll issues are affecting game day attendance because you can't know how many of the employees would go to the games anyway, making it impossible to know exactly how many are affected.
You're dreaming if you think moving to a downtown arena will result in lower ticket prices. They will most definitely increase.

Edit: a word
You can't have expected a positive reaction after admitting to be a rival team fan and telling everyone how to be a fan of this team?
My understanding of that process was that the first part was a bid to **enter negotiations** to develop LeBreton. It wasn't a done deal that whoever won the bid of that first process would get to secure the development deal. So something could have gone sour between the parties.
🤣 well played
> just like his idiotic idea to stick an arena out in the middle of nowhere. 

Huh? I think you're confused. The arena was there when he bought it. Melnyk has absolutely nothing to do with where the arena is located right now. 

That doesn't mean he has no influence on whether or not they push to move to LeBreton or stay in Kanata. But I get the impression some fans think Melnyk was the one who picked the current location...
From the article: 

> The owner himself says he attended a game as regular customer in the 300 level to get an everyman experience and was frustrated by the arena parking: “What a hell to get out of that place.”

I don't believe he did that at all.
But he is a veteran
I highly doubt that community TV broadcasts are regionally locked. At least I hope not!
Yeah, probably the timing is not the greatest if the Sens want to improve the team now. But if they decide they're out of the running Hoffman is a great tempting piece.
It might not be such a bad idea. I think Hoffman is realistically the only top 6 forward the Sens could afford to lose and still get something different in return. 

But that's like, my opinion man.
Gotta say, I really like the photos they used in this article for Dorion/Boucher and that other Boucher photo.
Yeah, I think that's the one.
Honestly I don't know, but if it's on YouTube I would guess that will be the case.
When I tried it, I had somewhat buggy issues with it. Took a long time to activate once I turned it on, and then again took a while to turn off when I disabled it. I imagine that's why it's still a lab feature.
Yes. Friend of mine that works for RTV says it'll be on Facebook / YouTube RTV streams :-)
Those jerseys look even better.
Date says 2014. Is that accurate or OP just didn't update date settings? Anyway I also notice at the end that the driver's car also slides a bit. So obviously winter tires aren't immune to sliding around (or else the driver also doesn't have winter tires). 

And I agree with other posters - all season tires can handle winter, albeit not as well. It is definitely safer with winter tires, but if you drive according to conditions you can make it with all season tires. The sentiment of "always use winter tires!" leads to people thinking they are invulnerable when driving which can lead to accidents anyway.
It doesn't matter whether or not you are monetizing your show. You need to have proper licenses to play any type of music. 

If you're not willing to pay for a license, consider using music licensed under Creative Commons. Check out www.jamendo.com, www.freemusicarchive.com, or archive.org. 

To;dr: it doesn't matter if you make money or not, you can't use full copyrighted tracks.
Take "might be" out of your sentence. There are definitely license issues with what OP wants to do (which sounds like "play full songs").
Cool! I think I got at least one survey with double SB. Just don't have the time to do surveys all the time, or else I might've got more done.

the worst  

I don't have a favourite, but I want to know which Rules of Acquisition match up with Gibbs' rules from NCIS?
I can only listen to podcasts + work if I'm not also reading / concentrating too hard at the same time.  Luckily I have work that allows me to focus on what I'm listening to.  

But beyond that I'm the same way - I can't listen to podcasts and read/type at the same time, or else I ignore the podcasts.  
Confirmed, Disney is buying the Ottawa Senators (they just need to wait until they announce the Fox buyout details first).
> But I also don't think it's realistic for people to paint going to a game in Kanata as not being a big inconvenience. For a good segment of people, it is. 

That's fair - but it's also not realistic to paint the location of the arena as being in as far away as Pembroke (as another person claimed in this post).
I just heard about this yesterday, and thought that it made no sense to pass the fees onto the contributors.  

Glad to hear they've reversed the decision, but wouldn't be surprised if they try to roll this out again in the future (with a bit more notice and communication).
I saw a comment further down from someone that said "I'll go to games when they don't play in Pembroke" (paraphrasing).  I definitely get the sense in this thread that people in Ottawa, in general, have no concept of distance in this region.
Have you actually been to Pembroke?  Do you have any concept of how far away it is vs the actual location of the CTC?
>  plus you have the outdoor game this weekend

You know, I hadn't considered this point, so I imagine not many others have either.

Ticket prices for this game are enormous compared to a single game.  Is it that crazy to imagine that people are skipping regular games to save up for one, once in a lifetime (probably) game?
I think a lot of people are just holding onto the dream of having a "downtown" arena.  The common comment I've seen are along the lines of "everything will be solved once they move to Lebreton".  

I don't disagree that it could definitely improve the situation, but it's not going to perform some sort of magic that will miraculously change everything.
I'll give you that.  Getting to/from the game in Lebreton won't be any easier if you live in Orleans.  

I've lived in Barrhaven and Nepean (Craig Henry area) and it's super easy to get to/from the game.  Nepean was easiest.  

I hope that buses / LRT will make it super simple to get to Lebreton when that happens.
Hyperbole much? 

I've never had a problem "making my way way back to Ottawa" after a game. It's just getting out of the parking lot. 

Kanata is NOT that far outside of the city. 

People make it seem like it's an hour outside of the city. 

I'm not saying this to oppose the move to LeBreton, just that the current situation is exaggerated beyond reality. 

Anyway as others have pointed out that picture was taken before the start of the game. Also must weekday games are a 7:30 start, so some people might not have realized it was a 7 start.
So what you're saying is someone is tilting the flat plane earth and causing the accidents.
For anyone (like me) travelling to Espanola - from the sounds of things Jacklin Rd *should* be open for detour.  No details on the MTO site yet but the highway is closed starting at Spooner.  

http://www.mto.gov.on.ca/english/traveller/trip/road_closures.shtml#Event556463  

Here's my question though.  Second time in 2 days the highway has closed due to a crash.  

There have been several crashes in the region over the last month, and not always has it been snow-related.  

What's going on? 
Stick with Sparty.  

There are a ton of mascots out there that are loosely affiliated with the team's name.  

However if you wanted to change it, I'd be in favour of bringing back Lenny the Lynx.
For making his employees wear t-shirts protesting the wage increase?  Yes, absolutely.
Haha wow.  I thought you were kidding too.  Honestly thought the team was off until the outdoor game.  Which would be terrible.  Think of all that press time to fill.
You got me.
Sort of like Brent Spiner / Data. It was starting to get to be a stretch for him to be playing an android - plus you can definitely see a difference between season 1 and even season 3 Data. 

But I agree with you - it really doesn't make much sense that not much would happen in 10 years. As for ASP being mature, based on the interviews and what Graham wrote in her book, I don't see any kind of change in her ever happening.
Pretending a year had gone by would be incredibly difficult with how some of the actors have aged.
Oh!  I haven't actually seen the Blu-ray edition of the movies.  

From that clip, CG Yoda looks like an improvement to me. 
> Episode I to get a Blu-ray release with puppet Yoda instead of CG Yoda

Did you mean that the other way around?  Episode I used a puppet, whereas II & III used CG.
Right on.  I'll slap something together and share your podcast link.  

Edit: [podcast](http://www.alternativeairwaves.com/2017/12/110-battle-for-net.html)
Haha!  No, he'll scratch Harpur, and they'll lose Ceci mid-game; the logic being that Boucher would rather the team play through adversity.
That's really up to you - if you want a dedicated intro then go for it.  If the different CC track is working for you then stick with that.  It's very subjective.
> That said, you CAN also use public Google Drive files

Drive doesn't generally work - for it to show up properly on iTunes you need a file extension, and Google's sharing links don't display these.  

The best bet for hosting MP3's free is archive.org.  It's a bit of a pain to set up but once you're up and running, it works fine.  

I agree though, for ease of use it's better to use a dedicated podcast service.  Many of the paid hosts will give you a free trial, and there are some that have a free tier to let you test it out (albeit the free tiers are usually severely limited in terms of what you can do with them).  
iTunes (now Apple Podcasts) is probably the largest source for podcasts, so they have quite a bit of pull. Most other sources get their feeds from the Apple listings, so there's that too.
My wife doesn't really like it.
So you can't say you don't enjoy it either. Still fits your post premise. ;-)
If they are doing this, it's probably because they're switching podcasts to two types: episodic or serial. They'll be doing episode numbers automatically. Don't have a link handy as a source.
I'm not going, but would love to know if it's televised.
To get it to display as a link, try throwing in "http://".  Some links don't play nice without it on reddit, I find.
Let's run with this, and change it to Chris Martin.  We're getting Coldplay, guys.
Good idea.  I'm sure I can find a crappy Android somewhere.  I have a tablet too, I guess I could try using that one!
Do you use a separate device for the videos?  

The only reason I don't do the videos is because I just have an older iPod Touch (so I run SBTV only - the other apps are broken on my version of iOS), and my primary phone (Android).  I actually like to *use* my phone during the day, so running videos on it is not really a good option.
Just saw this tweet: https://twitter.com/TSN1200/status/940279450796740608  

Not sure if anyone's linked to it yet, but thought it highly relevant.
But what does Auston Matthews think about the situation?
I've seen plenty of "normal" cars do this.

What I've seen even more often are cars that do U-turns on red lights.  
I think eventually it might be worth it - they are adding premium-only shows or other exclusives - if you're not worried about those, then don't get it.

> If you're going to build a personal blog, then please don't expect to get any income from it anytime soon.

My goal for my personal blog is reader interaction.  Hasn't happened yet, really and coming up on a full year.  

I think you probably don't need to worry so much about strategising your monetization plans for a personal blog - but I'm also somewhat new to the game so take my advice lightly.  I can't even spell words today.
Really normal.  Keep doing what you're doing.

> Chicago let Oduya walk and signed Franson to the same contract. Dorion is the kind of guy to pass up Franson for Oduya.

I feel like that's probably not a fair comparison to make; that suggests that both players were available to Ottawa and Dorion made the choice to sign Oduya.  

Are you sure that's how it happened?  Easy to say in hindsight.
Yeah, that's a huge consideration - Ottawa (and most Canadian teams) tend to pay more than US markets because of the higher tax here.
> Oduya we just signed and looks bad to trade him instantly.

This happens a fair amount in the league; I can't think of a recent example but it's not unheard of to trade someone recently signed when things don't work out.  Both sides usually understand.  

This is only a problem in video games when it affects your GM rating.
I don't think Stitcher Premium is about hosting though?  It's a paid listening service...
> You can play 30 seconds of a track and then discuss.

Note /u/DerengerFettt that there is no "magic number" of seconds that makes it legally OK to play.  Even if you played 10 seconds and you couldn't defend what you were doing as fair use, you could see some legal action (that doesn't necessarily mean you will get sued - it could just mean a c&d order).  

But in general what /u/caffeinated_pirate is saying is correct - in order to play music you don't have permission to use, you're totally fine if you're doing it in the context of a review.  I hesitate to say "commentary" because I don't think it would be fair use if you played a few seconds from a song and then just say "that track is cool, I like it".  

If you want an alternative check out music licensed under creative commons - lots of good stuff at freemusicarchive.org or jamendo.com or blocsonic.com.
Replace everything with "You need to not be a bad team and we didn't do that and it killed us."
Thanks for the breakdown! Watching movies tonight and not HNIC so caught off guard by sudden mentions of "Karlsson" and "trade chatter" in the same sentence.
It looks like a real city's transit map 🙃
I didn't watch the game, but I was hoping the team would come out of California with 3 points - that's still doable so I'm happy.
So far the trip is going as well as I could hope. Was hoping 1-1-1 So there's still a chance!
Yeah, I could see it as a one-off jersey that would look nice.  I don't think I'd like the team to use this kind of jersey as a regular or 3rd jersey at all.  Numbers look terrible though.
Yeah that's where I'm coming from.  The Buffalo game is probably The Most Important Game Of The Season so far.
> If Boucher refuses, fire him.

"...Out of a cannon.  Into the sun."
Haha glad I'm not the only one.  My license has me at 173 cm (5'8") but I got it when I was 16, so not surprised that I might have grown a bit since then ;)
Has anyone else out there been wrong about their height for the longest time?  

For some reason I was sure I was 5'10", but it turns out I'm only 5'9".  
Thanks!  I got 2 results but on a quick glance I'm not seeing a link anywhere.  I'll take a closer look when I have more time.
Cool!  I see it's $21, not bad.  Think I will add this to my wishlist now.  
Good discussion post.  

> Perhaps a meeting to lay out expectations and point out some of the obvious flaws with his choices and system would suffice, however, in the past you have given Guy plenty of control over his domain. It seems now like a good time to intervene in this regard.

If **I** were Dorion, I would wait until after the California road trip.  My expectation is to come out with minimum 2 points, ideally 3 - so 1-1-1.  1-2 is acceptable.  

If the team comes out of the trip 0-3, a meeting is happening for sure.  If the team matches my expectations, I wait until at least the Buffalo game.  

Buffalo is last in the Atlantic.  I expect the team to have a firm grip of the game (I don't need to see a blow out, but they should be winning by 2+ goals - if it's a one goal game, that's far too close than it should be).  

Basically my answer is - it's a game-by-game case.  He's on a short leash.
What game is that one?

In my alternate universe (NHL 15) the Sens just won the cup in 5 games vs Colorado, led by a 29-goal performance from Taylor Hall (acquired from Edmonton for Lehner).  
> The don't do what the fired guy did is a solid strategy to not get fired yourself.

Gives you a solid 2 weeks to work with at least.
The iPhone 6 still has the 3.5mm jack, right?  

You could easily get a microphone that would work with the iPhone.  Or even use the headphone/mic earbuds that come with it.  

The best thing you can do is control your environment as much as possible - that will be the biggest influence on sound quality while you're recording.  

Side note though - one time I recorded a quick podcast with my friend in the middle of a comic convention.  While you could hear background noise etc. our voices were quite clear and you could tell they were the focus audio.  

You'll be fine :) 
I've done some tests with my Galaxy S7 edge; smartphone mics are pretty good these days.  The audio is passable, but it won't be the same as a dedicated microphone.  As long as you know that going in, you should be fine.  

Personally that level of audio quality would be OK with me.  Others might disagree though.
I shudder to think that you assume someone out there created a bot that pops up on the mention of the word "price" to talk about Carey Price.
He won the Cup with Colorado in 1996: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Crawford  

So yes I'd say he's experienced.  

His official role is "associate" coach, so I'm not sure if he's part of the problem or not.  

However, if it were me taking over for someone being fired, I think I would try to NOT do what they were doing that got them fired.
> …paying the price

I see the problem.  The players and coaching staff are too focused on Carey Price.  

Edit: For the record, I was trying to make a joke.  That's how I deal with adversity!
That's pretty much hitting the nail on the head.  

I thought the hiring of Boucher & his staff was a good move & an investment into a strong veteran coach.  

If he's not the right fit, then he's not the right fit.  But this narrative will continue if they go on and hire someone without a strong track record (although at the same time - eventually new coaches need to be given a chance, but ideally not on a team that's supposed to be a ~~cup~~ playoff contender).
I'm not in the 'fire Boucher' camp yet, but getting close.  I'd like to see him adapt and try something different.  But not having seen many games lately I can't say I can see how the team is playing.  

As for Crawford taking over and making the same decisions - you would think that he would be smart enough to do something different from what got his predecessor fired (if that happens).
> People are naive if they think Turris would have made the team win all these games right now.

How many times has Turris gone through long pointless streaks with the Sens?  

He'd be struggling right with everyone else right now, I'm sure.  
Nice hyperbole.  I disagree, it was not the worst idea ever.
I was going to recommend this one as well.
How about try something really crazy.

Scratch both Anderson and Condon all game.  Dress 7 D, 12 F.  Play 3 D on the ice at a time with 3 forwards.  

That seems like a really good idea.

/s
Yeah none of what you're saying makes any sense.  

If the requirement for sharing ad revenue with Stitcher is that you do an ad read on your podcast, then you do it.  

The only way I would have a problem with Stitcher is if they took RSS feeds and modified them to include ads.  They do not do this.  To be on Stitcher you need to submit your show's feed.  

It seems reasonable to me to request that you include an ad read if you are going to share revenue.  

It does not matter to me who owns Stitcher.  

I don't know what you mean by Stitcher stealing download numbers - Stitcher stats report into overall statistics as another stream/download source.  I can't provide proof right now as my current statistics provider doesn't show me those details, but when I was paying for more detailed stats, Stitcher showed as a separate line.  

Here are some details from a recent email from Stitcher:  

> Last year, we began a process of implementing changes to the way Stitcher communicates with podcasters’ hosting providers. We started by moving all podcasters to direct streaming from the source -- the Stitcher apps now make a direct file request to your hosting infrastructure whenever a user chooses to play or download an episode of a show. 
  

> This change, which we previously made on an ad-hoc basis for podcasters who requested it, gives you better insight into your overall download metrics and better facilitates server-side dynamic ad insertion.  

Yes, I've read about that situation; that was 6 years ago.  

When you submit your show to Stitcher, they now use the original RSS feed rather than re-hosting.  

They do share ad revenue but I'm not sure how they determine who gets a piece (it's based on downloads/streams in some way).  

It might sound like I'm defending Stitcher, I'm just suggesting that maybe they're not quite as nefarious as you make them out to be.  

Just for anyone else stumbling in the discussion so that they get a balanced view.  

Anyway, I'm still going to listen to this new show when it becomes available.
> I can appreciate where you're coming from, but if someone wants to lose weight to look better and fit into smaller cloths, that's still not misogynistic in the least.

Oh no, don't get me wrong.  *I* don't think it's misogynistic either.  

What I'm saying is that I simply understand the reasoning that might lead to someone thinking "I want to look good in a particular outfit" is the same as "the media thinks I'm too fat because I'm a girl and I'm at X weight".   There are some strawman arguments that come into play here too that really fall apart the more you look at it.

> As an afterthought though, maybe his friend was actually mocking people with that mentality and it came off as she was supporting it. 

One can hope!
I mean, the only Stitcher Premium ad I've heard has been on Levar Burton's show - and that's just "sign up for Stitcher Premium to hear the next episode early" or something like that.  Haven't heard one anywhere else.
Ah.  That seems acceptable to me too, though?  If they're bankrolling the show they should be able to ask them to read ads.  

My podcasts are on Stitcher; I'm not required to do ad reads for them.  
I don't think Stitcher inserts ads into podcasts (unless they are producing the podcast) - they insert ads between podcasts.  That's very acceptable to me.  I don't use Stitcher to listen to podcasts though, but I don't have a problem with their platform.
Noted in another comment, it's coming out of the Stitcher paywall in the Fall at least.  

Hate to break it to you, all media (public-funded stuff notwithstanding, though even CBC in Canada sells ads on TV and is launching a streaming platform which is ad-supported, or ad-free for $4.99 a month) is interested in selling advertising.  That's the model.  The audience is the product.
> "You're a misogynists for trying to lose weight and be healthy!", seriously WTF?

I think the friend who wrote that is probably conflating issues, and is speaking about body image issues rather than weight loss for health reasons.  

Not to read in too much to what was written, but if you were to give them two scenarios: 1) "I'm trying to lose weight for health reasons" vs. 2) "I'm trying to lose weight so I can fit into smaller clothes!"  

They would likely support case \#1, but be against case \#2.  There are likely many issues going on behind the thought to that post.
Am I missing something?  Other than the delivery address being in Ottawa, what else is going on here?  Can I just move on from this post and enjoy my day or is there another level to this post?
It's definitely a smart move for Stitcher - I think it will draw some people into the premium model that might not otherwise have done so.  I just don't like paying for my podcasts ;) 

Unless it's absolutely terrible it'll probably still generate some buzz when it leaves the paywall.
Yeah me too.  Actually kind of looking forward to putting this on during my commute to work.  Slightly disappointed that it's a Stitcher Premium exclusive until the Fall though :( 
I'm trying to word this in as friendly and sensitive way as possible, but it's somewhat difficult.  

It sounds like the person who posted this is having trouble with their own journey - whether it's weight loss or accepting their body.  

I agree that the topic of body image is what you might call a "Hot Topic" - but there is a difference between being proud of your accomplishments and sharing them with people, and body shaming others.  

If you are posting updates about your progress and belittling others who aren't doing as well as you at the same time, then of course you probably should stop doing that.  

Personally, I am able to accept two mutually exclusive scenarios as true, so people posting about their progress does not bother me at all.  I'm trying to lose weight as well so that's part of it.  

But I also know that I'm not offended because someone has lost 100 pounds and I'm struggling with 40 or whatever.  

Let's distill my thoughts: unless you, yourself, are specifically being rude or offensive with your posts, don't stop what you're sharing because one person can't handle it.  As others have said, it's a fairly simple process to stop seeing those posts, so if they can't support your progress then it's on them to stop seeing the posts, not on you to stop sharing them.
Haha.  I saw the same ad on Facebook but happened to be looking at it on Instagram.  

I ended up clicking on the site, just to see what they had.  

The weirdest thing I've seen: a black Sens jersey.  I don't think I've seen even an official variation of this one.

I forgot to mention in my original post that it's going to be a Stitcher Premium exclusive in Spring 2018, but be available to everyone in the Fall.
Short answer: yes, you're fine to play some short clips of the music you are reviewing.  

Note that 'fair use' is a legal defense and not based on a set amount of seconds of the track you're playing (e.g. it doesn't mean you're fine playing 5 seconds, but play 6 seconds and you'll get a lawsuit automatically).  

Your best bet would be to edit your podcast together in a way that it's easy enough to remove the music clips should you be approached from the copyright holders.  From the sounds of things, that shouldn't interfere with how you structure your show.
These game day times are great when I have the late ice for curling. 

Except I'm still going to bed before the end of the first period.
Oh goodness yes. Like the plague.
SC2 was pretty good as a sequel, and they got all the original actors back (kid included).  
Yeah, you're right.  I forgot that IM3 was before Avengers 2...which was a silly assumption because IM3 is AFTER the first Avengers (hence the post traumatic stuff).  There are a lot of Marvel movies to keep track of.
Oh that's right.  I forgot that was in between.  Thematically I feel like it should go IM3 > Civil War.  I stand corrected.
>end choose to blow up his suits. Then in the next movie he has his suits again even more impressive versions and is fine jumping into battle 

I think the next movie you mean is Civil War?  He just has the one suit in that movie.  He definitely destroys the suits that he uses as drones at the end of Iron Man 3; in Civil War he's pretty much done being Iron Man, he only suits up to fight Captain America.
Thanks!  Same to you (although you seem to be doing fairly well!) :) 
Thanks!  What you're saying makes sense.  I tend not to overthink what I'm doing, until what I'm doing stops working ;) Then I try to figure out what I need to change.  

But this is the first time in a while where I've seen drastic change as a result of some minor changes (basically, lowering my calories-in maximum number).  Thanks! :) 
Yes, I'm well aware that my traffic is low.  On my personal blog I'm not worried about the money side of things.  My goal for that one is reader engagement.  Obviously still have a lot of work.  

I've only recently re-started my music blog (my main use of it for the last few years has been to host show notes for my podcast), but I've seen some great growth since getting back to writing.
Ads for both of my blogs - Adsense for my music blog which gets 10-50 visitors per day (depending on what I publish I guess; last month was 1200+ total).  

On my personal blog, I use Project Wonderful.  That blog gets under 100 per month, average of 40 per month since Feb of this year.  

I've made $0.03 between the two of them ;) I only just activated Adsense on my music blog though.
My scale seems to be really consistent when I go for a weigh-in - no matter how many times I step on it I end up getting the same number.  So on that front, I think my scale is functioning properly.  

What you say about eating something salty several days in a row - I've had lots of popcorn & chips in the last few days, so that's a possibility I hadn't considered.  

But yeah, as for averaging out the weight over time, that's why I expected some fluctuations UP rather than continuing to drop down this week.  Bodies are weird.
So totally not complaining, but hoping to get some understanding of how my numbers have been behaving over the last little while.  

[Here are my numbers for the last 30 days](https://i.imgur.com/4lB9DUi.png)  

What's got me a little puzzled is the sharp drop this week.  I haven't been the most diligent in logging over the last few weeks in November, so wasn't surprised that I went up a little bit.  

I adjusted my plan using [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/78n72e/myfitnesspal_question/dov58cm/) as a guideline; I reduced my calorie budget quite a lot, and was expecting a slow loss - 1 pound per week, so 0.14 pounds per day should be reasonable to see.  

Instead I've "whooshed" down from 264 to 261 (this morning) - all in a span of 4 days.  [You can see my 7-day chart here.](https://i.imgur.com/wCChyBW.png)  

**Anyway, my question:** Since I'm expecting a *slow* weight loss, I figured that my weight would crawl back up a bit after I went from 264 to 262.  What's more likely of these two scenarios: 

1) That I had a lot of water weight and I just got rid of it all?  
2) I'm actually overestimating my calorie intake for the last few days / underestimating how much I've burned?  

I realize that it's hard to determine without seeing all of my numbers so just looking for a generalized answer.  Even if it's just confirming what I've already guessed!
Yeah.  More realistic outcome of my imaginary 15-game record is a flipped version...4-6-5 or something.
Here's the good news, though, if you want to go with this hypothetical 9-game streak (7-2 or otherwise):  

Of the next 9 games, 4 of them are against Atlantic Division opponents (Buffalo, Montreal, Tampa Bay, Florida).  Stretch it out to 15 games, and you're looking at a total of 8 Atlantic opponents, which includes Montreal, Boston and Detroit.  

30 points available, half of those are against divisional opponents.  If the Sens can get 22-25 points (the .750-.850 clip you mention) that'd be amazing, but even better if they get them against the division rivals.  

As I type this I realize that means they'd need to go at least 11-4.  Ouch.  But, that also doesn't mean they need to win 11 in a row or anything.  

I figure during the western trip they'll go 1-2, but let's be generous and say 1-1-1.  There's 3 points.  

I would be happy if they only won the games against the Atlantic teams - which is something like 8-4.  Would leave them with a record of 9-5-1, or 19 points.  

That's not *terrible*.  But much improved over what they've done in the last bunch of games.  

In a perfect world some more of those losses in my fantasy 15-game record would be OTL's, so let's be more generous and say they go 9-3-3.  21 points, and you still beat your division rivals.  

We can dream...
Not knowing anything about how Moulson is / isn't performing, I'd say yes based on the name.  

After reading this thread, I'd say no.  

But to my first point - this does seem like the kind of pick-up that Melnyk might encourage, to generate some buzz for the team.  Who knows.  
> I'm not sure why were even having a back and forth about this it's very simple.

But it's not very simple.  If it was, wouldn't Dorion already have done something?  

He has made some changes since the Duchene trade, actually.  But they haven't really done anything.  

The reason we're having this 'back and forth' is because you can't just say "make a move!" and wipe your hands.  That's why I want to hear what you have in mind specifically, because then we can actually have a discussion about it.  

I'd rather them *not* just make a trade for the sake of making a trade.  You should be making a move to improve the team, not just to "shake things up".  

Edit: This isn't that scene from *Moneyball* where Billy Beane traded some players seemingly at random (which hides what actually happened for a dramatic moment) to send the team on a magical winning streak.
Yes...but what move? Of course you don't do a blockbuster - Dorion already did that with Duchene. But what can you add? The team needs an upgrade on Defense and Goaltending primarily. I don't think it's the right move to give up on Andy or Condon right now. Who do you move to improve on D though? 

I'm asking seriously, because it's easy to say "make an impact trade" without backing it up with some examples. 

And you can't "just add" a player either. Yeah, draft picks for a player, but you're limited in what you can get with a draft pick.
Oh totally.  I said it in another thread - it's not the right time for a rebuild.  That time was before Karlsson hit his prime.  Eventually the Sens will be forced to enter the rebuild process, but that's not this season.  
What kind of move would you make if you were running the team?  

It's easy to say "add a player" but there are many problems with this, not the least of which is Dorion would be dealing from a position of weakness (other GMs can see the standings just as well as we can).  
> Then you can leave this sub then.

Disagreed.  This is just this fan's opinion.  It seems silly to demand that every fan posting here share the same opinion or else leave.  How do you have any kind of discussions?
That's a fair take, IMO.  They have lost far too many games  for their own good.  If they don't waste the games in hand they have a chance, but yeah...signs don't point to greatness at the moment.
Yeah, that seems realistic to me.  It'd be nice if one of those losses is in OT/Shootout at least.
Yep, the team has the opportunity to turn it around.  I'm hoping that they can take at least 3 points on the California trip.  Best case scenario they go 2-1 in Cali.
Yep, that's exactly what would happen.
On the flip side, Duchene has another year left too!
The thought crossed my mind too, but while the team has the contracts it does (not to mention Karlsson) they have to go for it. They cut the rebuild short when it was effective - before Karlsson hit his prime.
Duchene isn't a significant upgrade in terms of points. His upgrade comes in the form of skill + an extra contract year.
Gives the opposing team a false sense of security.
Dang, they're not in the league? My knowledge of the NBA teams comes from Tecmo NBA for the NES + the Raptors.
Slight correction. You have net neutrality now. You are fighting to keep it.
Cool, hadn't seen the other info. Thanks for the heads up! Now I'll need to remember again at game time that Oduya is a member of the Senators. Keep forgetting. Every time.
I think that means they're running 7 D instead of 6. So a forward is out.

Damn, I'm too slow. Would have loved to use the star trek one. Oh well! Thanks for the generosity.
Vague recollection but it was several years ago on HNIC and after a segment with Petrillo MacLean said "those cans" - can't remember the context but I'm sure there's something documented online somewhere.
Am I the only one who remembers the "those cans" comment from a few years back re: Andi Petrillo?
So did you have this list of things you wanted to do/accomplish at the beginning of the month, and track daily?
Yes, in the context of how good the team should be, a top 10 pick shouldn't be the end result, I agree with you there.  

I just mean that when talking about the moves made to stock up for a run, it's not as if the team's ability to draft good talent has been crippled.
Not much to see here.  Pretty much the perfect answer, can't expect much more than that.  It's up to both sides to make it happen.
> And tanking is not an option given the moves to stock up for a run, and the quality of our team.

Well, the team isn't screwed if they get a lottery pick.  The pick traded for Duchene is top 10 protected, so the team keeps it if they perform that badly.  

Edit to add:

I've been to one game this year, and was lucky enough to sit at ice level.  I saw first-hand the skill the top 6 players have; they definitely should be playing better than their current record.  
But he *could*

I'm sorry but this feels very imprecise and very "guestimate"-y.  I'd go with /u/funchords's advice.
Yeah I've been really impressed with Edge - guess it helps to build from the ground up.  

Like I said though, my primary computer is a work-issued Laptop; I can only sign into my corporate Office 365 account in Edge, which means I can't easily sync things.  

I suppose I could log into my Office 365 account on mobile & on my Surface, but multi-factor authentication can be a pain to deal with sometimes.  

Edit: turns out, I can't add my 365 account on mobile anyway :P 
Haha no problem.  I only used it recently (the reason I linked to an article, is because right now I can't remember where that option is off the top of my head).  I think it was recently added.
https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/import-chrome-firefox-bookmarks-to-edge
Not sure I'm following what you need to do here, but you can definitely import Chrome bookmarks into Edge.  Edge can then sync bookmarks.  

I'd also like Google integration, as the primary computer I use on a day-to-day basis doesn't allow me to add my personal microsoft account to Edge, just my corporate account. 
I can only compare to Chrome - haven't tried Firefox so can't help to compare there.
There are better answers in the thread from the other day about the new updates to the Edge preview, but one thing I like about Edge over Chrome is that the interface feels "cleaner".  Hard to explain but that's one for the win column for me.  
I still contend that deal was done primarily with team finances in mind.  I don't disagree that Zibanejad is the better player; but he would have ultimately cost the team a lot more money if they held onto him.  

Edit: added a word.
Well, I imagine doing a lot of surveys helps ;) 

That's pretty much what I do exclusively - I don't run the apps much, and don't do much SB Shop or Discovery.
Brassard/Turris trades are what I'm referring to when I talk of lateral moves for contractual reasons.  

With Duchene we get a similar player to Turris with an extra contract year.  

Brassard is considerably less expensive than Zbad.  

Burrows I thought was good at the time, but that is definitely an outlier.
350 is still better than the Quarter Pounder.  That's 530!  My lunch today altogether is less than that.
> And what about Dorion himself? He's made a lot of big moves in his short tenure, if Duchene doesn't start scoring soon is his job on the line? 

The funny thing about the big moves Dorion has made is that they are mostly lateral moves, and done primarily for contractual reasons.  

Everything else in between has been fairly "minor" or at least "normal".  

I think for that reason Melnyk is probably really happy with Dorion.  He's not costing the team any money (yet), and is actually saving money with his moves.  

I think Dorion is doing very well with the restraints put on him (I don't know what those might be - but considering the moves made, it's clear he has a budget to work with).  I think he has a longer window of job security for now.
Yep.  So I think I will stick to Chrome, pretty much for that reason.  I still like Edge on mobile though.  It's easy enough to share stuff using Join anyway.
OP was referring to nightmares, where hamburgers eat you! (same as in Soviet Russia) (and Rand McNally)

Edit: almost forgot a Simpsons reference
Numbers aside, your graphs look really neat!  What are you using to generate it?
I usually just bundle up and keep walking.  The only time I don't is usually when it's too wet / snowy to walk.  If you dress appropriately the cold's not an issue at all.
He's going to end up missing one game (tonight's).  Next game is Dec 1st.  It's probably fine.
I've dabbled; but I think at this point it's just second-nature to use Chrome.  I have my Surface set to open Edge by default at least.  

Is the bookmark syncing decent between PC/Mobile?  

Edit: remembered the other reason I still prefer Chrome; I can't link my personal Microsoft account with Edge on my work computer; only my work account.  So effectively I can only sync between my phone & Surface, but I use my work laptop far more than my Surface.
> Cleaner interface besides Chrome's new interface seems unnecessarily complicated to me. 

I was until recently using Edge; happened to switch back to Chrome one day and found that the interfaces are suddenly similar.  However I still prefer Edge's functionality - not really a fan of the way Chrome handles new tabs.  

One thing holding me back from switching to Edge again: bookmarks.  I love the way Chrome syncs bookmarks between devices.  Since I use Chrome on desktop all the time this is more useful to me.  If Edge and Chrome could talk to each other and share bookmarks more easily...that would be perfect.
...where is your information from?  I don't mean "tell me exactly who your source is and their phone number" but there's literally nothing backing this post.  

Logically it makes sense, but hard to take a post from username "johnnylovesbjs" with no sources talking with certainty that a deal is in place.
> I have just recently heard about this Net neutrality thing. 

Honestly, it's pretty bad if you've only just recently heard about Net Neutrality.  

I have a couple of questions for you:  

1) How old are you?  
2) Are you in the US?  

Please don't read these questions as condescending or anything - I'm honestly curious because if you're fairly young and in the US, and you're only JUST recently hearing about it, then it means people trying to gut net neutrality are doing a good job of keeping people in the dark.
The Coyotes under his term didn't have a lot of good players either.
I don't think there's anything wrong with taking a break from MFP.  I do it frequently - it can be mentally taxing to log everything every day.  

My tip would be even if you're not logging it, keep measuring.  When I take my MFP break I try to make sure I stick to serving sizes.  The fact that you're using an app to track it still is good (never heard of YouAte).
Yep, no one is stopping you from sharing.  Just letting you know why some people (like myself) don't take these stories seriously, that's all.  

The simple matter is - nobody knows who you are.  It doesn't matter that you did or didn't divulge where you work; it's anonymous so you could be anybody.  There's no reason to believe hearsay, that's all.  
It's not about trolling, but a lot of people have stories that go, "a friend of mine who talked to X player" or "a coworker talked to X player".  

I would rather not bother with hearsay, if we're being honest here.  

This level of hearsay is not so bad - it's the ones where it's about some sort of negative story that are the worst.  "I heard from some guy who talked to a player that said they're playing too many video games between periods, that's why they're losing."  That kind of thing.  

I take ALL of these kinds of stories very lightly.
> bauhaus light

I think you're likely right - looks like the text just has no fill (outline only).  Shapes seem to fit.
Huh. I just watched this last night. Nice timing / creepy, OP.
Thought for a second you were saying rumours were Drake was interested.
What I learned through this article was that there are USB versions of most game controllers. This is great, because the only USB controller I have is basically a PS2 clone (Logitech) which works great, but sometimes I'd like the simplicity of an NES or SNES pad. Thinking of getting into N64 and GameCube emulators too, so having gamepads for those systems especially would be awesome. 

Woohoo!
I would be surprised if Canada doesn't get pressured to follow suit. 

I also don't believe that doing away with net neutrality would happen only in the US. I feel like it would be a case of dominoes falling into place from country to country.   There's too much money to be made by ISPs.
I didn't activate the wallpapers honestly. So I can't help you there :-(
Haha. I haven't used Evie in a long time so couldn't tell you. I eventually switched back to Nova when I was using Evie, does that help?
Since I don't know the answer, hoping someone else does (or is less lazy to do the research).  Is it maybe a handedness issue that Oduya is in over Claesson with Harpur/Chabot in?
Clementine season is the best season.
I would just not worry about it :P 
[this guy knows what's up](https://i.imgur.com/eQaQEdJ.jpg) 👏
Hmm okay I'll try to be as specific as possible in terms of what I like about Microsoft's launcher.  

- It's simple, but still customizable.  What I mean is that it starts you out with a basic layout - home screen plus swipe right to get to a "today" type of screen.  You can customize this screen to include as much or as little info as you see fit, and support for non-Microsoft widgets is there (although, not all widgets play nice in this space).  
- Continuing from point \#1, you can customize icons etc. using combinations of icon themes and what not.  I like how it grouped Google & Microsoft icons on my home screen for me.  
- I like the way they've implemented the dock and app drawer.  The dock has room for 5 app shortcuts, and swiping up gives you access to some additional shortcuts, plus some toggles (wi-fi, Flashlight, data, etc.).  
- Swipe up anywhere else on the main screen gives you the app drawer, which also has built-in search, though I think I do prefer Nova's app drawer.  

Anyway, all that to say that yes, it is geared to give you access to Microsoft apps first, but it's completely customizable and not reliant on those same Microsoft apps.  I happen to use Microsoft apps so this is not a big deal for me.  

I think eventually I will probably return to Nova but I like the way this works right now.  Probably I would recreate the functions of the MS Launcher in Nova Launcher (pretty simple to do, though I don't think you can recreate the dock part of it easily).  
I figured out what's gone wrong these last four games - my Karlsson bobblehead's stick blade was facing the wrong way.  I fixed it, so we should be good now.
Awesome!  Thanks for the head's up.  I really like the way Microsoft Launcher works.  So far, I haven't come across too many things that Nova does that I wish MS Launcher would do.  I think probably I'm a "light" Nova user so I think I'm covered by most functions in this launcher.

Those are some major updates!  Updating it now...
> prince of whales

This is a much better name for the road.
I thought Billy Zane was in the first one only?
I'm teasing a bit - you're right that most people prefer II over III.  Definitely not unanimous though.  

I prefer III for some of the same reasons that some people dislike it (the main reason being it's a mirror for the first film - better than revisiting it in II imo).
Well, I'll probably start worrying when they're in danger of *making* the playoffs.  They're not at that point yet though.
I prefer it over \#2.  Looks like others do as well.

It's *possible* some people might have a different opinion than yours.  I'm not 100% sure though.
> Gary Oldman - Sirius Black  

I know your post says you're looking for 'three movies' but if you go by "trilogy" then Harry Potter doesn't really represent a trilogy.  I imagine this removes several other names from this list if you want to use that technicality.
It's the same question as who takes care of the Enterprise when the senior staff is off duty.  TNG showed us some episodes showing different shifts.

Why would it be different on DS9?  

Anyway, there have been DS9 episodes where something bad happens to the station when the Defiant is away.  Couldn't give you prime examples right now.
Meh, I view the Defiant as basically an extension of DS9 itself - so the command crew *should* be on board for extended missions.  It's been shown that there are times when the Defiant is crewed by only *some* of the senior staff.  

The only point I'll concede is when they bring along Bashir.  He's only there for real world contractual purposes.  They wouldn't really need the CMO on a ship that small.
Ah well.  Worth a try ;) Thanks!
Nope, there are a lot of those podcasts out there. 

The thing you need to keep in mind is that there are far more amateur sounding (ie not professional) podcasts out there because it's super simple to start a podcast, and it's a popular hobby.
Mono is definitely better. Unless you have a specific reason to use stereo, you don't need it. As the other user mentioned lots of people listen with one earbud so potentially you're missing half the audio if you accidentally pan the audio to one side.
Yep. And I can't stay away. ❤️
I have a few squares not cooperating. That Sears one is at least amusing.
> Too many players want #95 to get his first point, and Duch in turn passing when he should be shooting (not as much a problem the last game).

Is that really the case though?  I don't know his full totals but at one point over the weekend I saw he had 10 shots in 2 games?  He definitely had 5 shots vs Pittsburgh.
I got a free Surface Pro sweepstakes entry. Good enough for me I guess.
Retired league wide.
Fun fact: when I was a kid, I remember calling the movie "Princess Leia with No Clothes On". I don't think at the time I really knew what the movie was called.
Crystal Skull had a lot of great moments that harken back to Raiders and Last Crusade. Overall it had more bad moments than good ones, but I'm not going to lie, I enjoyed it too.
Wait til OP finds out what happened to \#99 in the NHL.
The Leafs were happy to unload Phaneuf's contract before - unlikely that they would take it back.
Designed for viewing from a stadium/tv. Probably the reason for the 100 logo being on the top
If you guys don't like this one, look up some of the previous Stadium Series jerseys. They are a lot flashier (i.e. shiny silver everywhere, especially on logos) and not as sharp as this one. 

Ottawa came out pretty great with this jersey imo. The thing with these jerseys is that often they're also made to look good on the ice from far away (though I think it's cool that both jerseys have Stanley Cup details on the striping up close) and on TV. 

Definitely their jersey for the Vancouver game was better; but I think this one is pretty solid.
Do you mean 16? Cause I have NHL 15 for PS3, currently up 3 games to 1 vs the Leafs in my second year. Taylor Hall had a 65 goal season for Ottawa. In other unlikely events Greening had a 25+ goal season.
Yup I like all those three. 

I like BTTF 3 because the plot mirrors the first movie, but Doc gets an actual story beyond bring a crazy scientist. 

As far as Last Crusade goes - could be the higher production value that helps with enjoyment of the film.
Return of the Jedi has always been my favourite. That tape got the most rewatches as a kid in our house. It wasn't until the special editions came out that I finally saw all of Jabba's dialogue. 

You see, my parents must have taped it when they had a free preview of one of the movie channels. Several times the "call now to order the channel!" messages would scroll over top of Jabba's subtitles. 

Still didn't ruin the experience for me though.
Gotcha. That seems a bit easier to convert people to buy than a recurring monthly fee. However a recurring monthly fee is more enticing to me than selling a one-off product. 

Theoretically you could use Patreon this way.
What you're describing sounds exactly like Patreon to me.  

With the Patreon model, the main feed is 100% free; many podcasters provide a Patreon-only RSS feed that you can only access by contributing monthly (in whatever amount) to the Patreon feed.
The phrasing "...in recent weeks on Reddit..." in this particular case is code for "we just found it last week, but we'll tell people it's new because the general public doesn't understand Reddit".
I'm aware of that part, but that was still the best option because there was nothing available (either physically, or in terms of practicality) downtown.
Built in Kanata partially because there was no viable land available downtown and also the public transport infrastructure and roads were not able to handle game traffic. Things are different now than 1992. 

Considering the team had to fund the onramps I'd hardly say it's greed related.
It did on Space in Canada.
You're thinking of TNG with Dr Crusher. DS9 did have some same sex kisses. But they were also somewhat cop outs
A few on DS9...well one mirror universe, one between two female trills. Don't think that counts as gay.
Such an underrated film. I don't think enough people know about it.
Does this look a bit better?  Not 100% final on the colours.

I think I need to change that. Pretty sure I got this from a free image database and the patch was part of it.
