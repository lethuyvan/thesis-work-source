I received a phone call from him on the store phone. He told me there were things to clean if I wasn't busy and technically he was right.
I think she *is* the soul stone at this point.
They do it silently because you can always sell your cars for a loss, but you can't sell kids. It's pointless to give someone shit about kids they already have, and it's really difficult to say "don't have kids" to someone without it being a huge insult.
I worked at speedway long ago and the district manager called in to ask me how the Harry Potter book I was reading was going. Made me put it away. 
I run a highly optimized nomad and only matchmake. It works out great because the aggro I pull from facetanking so much lets any of the lower geared players put a lot of bullets on target. I like to get up high and suppress/distract, and then pop revives when I need to. It's a good balance of attack and utility that makes the game really fun for me.

I was put on it about 14 years ago. It made me incredibly lethargic all day long and I would see flashes on my peripheral vision while trying to sleep at night. I didn't stay on it long.
Damn you got a better deal than I did. I remember bitching about the ram price to my buddy on Hangouts while waiting at the checkout line for this one.

I'm not totally up on my alien lore, but weyland was a megacorp I believe that got bought and merged with yutani corp some time before the first alien movie takes place.

I think you may underestimate how easily entertained *most* people are. Look at the shit they got on YouTube with millions of views. Most of these probably aren't getting watched(autoplay), but the ad man doesn't care.
Nothing he's ever done in his entire life has led me to believe he's that smart. If anything it was Bannon, or probably when the gavel finally falls Putin is the genius here. He's a fucking spy and he didn't get to where he is now by sucking dick. If anything he is good at pretending to suck dick when it mattered.
I had a problem with the cliffhanger, but thinking about it from a different perspective helped me a lot(as it does most times I'm stuck in conflict about something). Looking over the movie and seeing Thanos as the main character, watching all the plot events as objects to push his narrative forward, and seeing the avengers as the bad guys, the movie changes for me and I can accept the ending they gave us. It seems like less of a cliffhanger to me. He reached his goal. The next infinity movie will be from the avengers perspective, likely. I doubt it will offer you the closure you are looking for.
A man, veteran of world war 2, dies and goes to heaven. He easily makes it past the pearly gates but learns from St. Peter that because of his heroism, he gets to speak directly to The Boss. He hurries along and finally meets his maker. He tells God "I've got the greatest Holocaust joke to tell you," and he tells it. It's a real knee slapper, but God doesn't seem amused. He looks over at God and says, "Eh, you really had to be there I guess."
Also if someone(usually Florence) gets excommunicated, you can vassalize them for practically pennies in AE. I did that in my Lucca game recently and it easily doubled my power early on.
It feels good to know people care. Thank you.

The weird quick turn radius on PC was one of the things that originally fascinated me about the game. I can honestly say the stairwells in lexington are probably the only interesting thing about that place, to me. It's a bit mesmerizing.
There are a lot more people in Russia though. I hate the idea, but starving Russia economically, ergo the Russian people, will put pressure on Putin that he can either solve diplomatically or the people can solve through revolution. No more softball shit. Messing around in our election(and France, AND UK, AND Ukraine, AND Greece, and on and on) is, imho, a deliberate act of war. He has already fired the first shot and anything short of NATO troops crossing into the pre-crimean annexation borders of Russia is absolutely necessary for the safety of our people's and governments. 
There's also a really funny movie about one that got sent to the wrong person. I wish I could remember the name, though. *"Auntieeeee...."* 
If you're doing a fun rp game, I'd suggest getting cheat engine and finding the popular tables and table extensions.

It makes you feel like you can solo any legendary mission. Until you try it and the NPCs chase you out of the fucking mission and down the block, then shotgun snipe you from 40 yards away.

They have to not hire idiots to be cops in that case, people who can think for themselves. Most places have made it clear the opposite is what they're looking for. 
I've seen this bot all over and it amazes me how wholesome the reaction is to it. Mostly people say thanks and I've never seen anyone hostile to it. It's taken the Nazi out of grammar Nazi. I think if it's somehow not really a bot and is instead a person, it's probably the most successful troll ever.
I think the movies are all non canon/alternate universe stuff. I'd go through Kai and then the movies in order, and just talk about the setup in popular theories(eg. Coolers revenge is supposedly a universe where Goku kills freeza with the spirit bomb and doesn't go super saiyan.) My SO enjoys doing it this way because it provides a lot of interesting conversation. She learns way more about the DB universe and lore than otherwise just watching it and being confused by all the one-off characters.
I can't speak for the mods as I never use them, but threat for me seems to be directly tied to how many bullets I put on target. If I lay into a heavy or sniper with 100 shots of my lmg, it doesn't seem to matter what my teammates do. There will be 5-8 NPCs all shooting at me before long. I run nomad so I can facetank a lot longer, I think that's why I tend to beat out my teammates all the time on threat. Given what the others have said a -threat mod may help someone in my sort of situation a lot.
Curious, what skills do you guys prefer to see with randoms? I run nomad and my SP barely hits 3.8 for the unlock, so my damage skills are pathetic but I'm pretty good at laying down a bead of gunfire. I normally run the revive gun and one other I've been rotating to see which is more useful. I like smart cover for the stability and bonuses, so I've been using that recently after finding the sticky bomb variants to be ineffective.

I even had to unbind the B button because I kept opening my bag, in combat, when trying to use a medkit. Even in cover, opening a menu stands you right up and no amount of mashing escape will make it go faster.
I once had the balls to catch a fly ball barehanded. Only once. That flesh is more delicate than it seems.
This is the greatest gift in most games. I cherish it. Normally the gp you're fighting makes a beeline for you even if it isn't your damn war.
Nomad stacking dte and ead here. I chew up elites and can facetank a good amount. It also pulls a lot of aggro so you can be credit to team keeping those fucking snipers off the rest.
PSA for anyone, if you're on a ledge and downed, you can usually fall off if you hit the right angle. I don't think it let's you do a damage fall from too high though.
You know how many times I've been running to the next objective doing my reload and I accidentally hit my super? I'm always looking like such a dumbass in missions it's a wonder I never get kicked.
Yeah fuck allies. We won't need them, we only need ourselves, like the Koch's want. Kindly fuck off, we'll continue to advocate for you even after you've gone.
I once got a letter from a collector that basically said "the original company can't sue you any more for this debt, so give us a call and we'll do it for them!" Nope. Right in the bin.
The NPCs definitely do something similar. I shock a guy running in one direction and he moonsquats all the way to where he was going. Hilarious but frustrating.
*cue some bullshit anecdote from that guy who had a bad union experience once*
I think there are lots of people who aren't in tune with their own mind or body, so they might not know what they really want. It may not be  as easy as we'd like for it to be.

I did acid in a hotel room once, alone while my girlfriend was off at a music festival. There were kids playing outside in the pool or whatever and I found myself falling into the middle of a black hole for about six hours with the wailing of the damned outside. I just laid down on the bed and did a trust fall into the back of my own mind. I remember the last thought I had was "I don't know if I'll come back from this." and then melted off into nothing. That was a really fun trip and I'm still different because of it.
Is clear skies one of those missions with a clear path or whatever like Hudson(IIRC)? I've never done it before and don't want to waste some group's patience not knowing where to go to save time. Thanks!
I got my striker filled before nomad, honestly I'll take the damage hit. I am sick of how much I used to die so I'll cling to nomad until the end.
BuzzFeed has been reputable for years. Just because it says something you don't like doesn't mean it isn't. Also own your shit comments. Don't delete.

Bigger companies are also more set in their ways and way overconfident. I bet lots of 'bigger companies' want to waste a bunch of money trying blockchain their way before letting another(more established) player show them how to do it.
At least you don't have to deal with screws now if you don't want to.
Sometimes the only thing those dogs waiting on death row get is a good walk from someone who cares about them. If I can give a being I can't save something to feel normal or cared for about, that is much more valuable than a lot of the things I can do to make myself feel better. For some dogs, that feeling of sniffing around and experiencing the world with a pack is the only normal feeling they get in their entire lives. And then they're put down. It is sad, but giving someone their only normal moment in their entire life eventually stops feeling like a pity you "offer up" and becomes your duty. Because you know nobody else will stand up for the excitable Pit in the corner who loves snorting in the wild flower patch.

God damn. OP is a horrible fucking person.
PETA lost credibility years ago. Anything they do now is a flailing waste of donor money. Don't donate to PETA ever.
PETA is a profit scheme for the top tiers of the organization and it can get royally fucked. I do more for animals volunteering at my local SPCA than it does all year screeching and euthanizing hundreds of animals to pad its bottom line.

I have six hours to burn, what should I do:

1. Install a rom on my difficult-to-flash phone
2. Jailbreak some device I have and then forget about it
3. Install an old game, play it for some time(alternatively, Install old game, download all the mods, and then play for 1/8 the time)
4. build a PC for some project around the house to prove that $150 thingamajig isn't worth it
I've seen this coming from a mile away in the IT field. So many people I know checked all the boxes. White, Republican parents, angsty about republicans, gun owners, "free market" bullshit everywhere they go, "as a black man" mentality(one girl I knew tried defending the defunding of planned Parenthood by shutting down the argument with "My opinion is more valuable than yours because I've been raped before"), casual racism with the "I have colored friends" defense, and one big thing I noticed was they all went to college but were by far the most uneducated. They all fell for Trump head over heels. They'll never be turned back and I think Trump's removal will probably give them an excuse to be more racist, spiteful and hateful.
This looks just like Ohio but with more color.
Seems like a good excuse to filter OP's username in RES.
I suspect the comment you're replying to is a joke about psychedelics.
Lots of divisive propaganda out lately to keep Americans hating each other. 
Nice. Thanks for looking out!
What applications do you use, if I may ask? 
Also, why the hell are they complaining about it here? To stir up shit about people who don't like capitalism? They can miss me with that bad vibes shit.
It took me about four hours for the first panel, but that one was my first one like it. The second two I did together and were a lot easier, I think if I get really good at it I can do a few pages in a day. The really tedious part is clipping out the comic into several images, I'm not good enough at Photoshop yet to know how to do it quicker than zooming in with the lasso tool and snipping out the pixels in small chunks at a time.
And in many circles is considered a pejorative and insulting. Obviously not OP's match, but I'd always be careful using it.

It isn't on the end screen, only the stats screen. They look the same but are definitely different. You might not be able to do it once the game is at the end screen, I haven't tried personally.

Trump was besties with Epstein until the guy got too hot to be around. He *may* have been procuring, but he was definitely banging kiddies with the dude. A woman from one of his 'modeling agencies' said in a court filing:

>I traveled by bus to New York City in June 1994 in the hope of starting a modeling career. I went to several modeling agencies but was told that I needed to put together a modeling portfolio before I would be considered. I then went to the Port Authority in New York City to start to make my way back home. There I met a woman who introduced herself to me as Tiffany. She told me about the parties and said that, if I would join her at the parties, I would be introduced to people who could get me into the modeling profession. Tiffany also told me I would be paid for attending.

>The parties were held at a New York City residence that was being used by Defendant Jeffrey Epstein. Each of the parties had other minor females and a number of guests of Mr. Epstein, including Defendant Donald Trump at four of the parties I attended. I understood that both Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein knew I was 13 years old.

>Defendant Trump had sexual contact with me at four different parties in the summer of 1994. On the fourth and fnial sexual encounter with Defendant Trump, Defendant Trump tied me to a bed, exposed himself to me, and then proceeded to forcibly rape me. During the course of this savage sexual attack, I loudly pleaded with Defendant Trump to stop but he did not. Defendant Trump responded to my pleas by violently striking me in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted,

>Immediately following this rape, Defendant Trump threatened me that, were I ever to reveal any of the details of Defendant Trump’s sexual and physical abuse of me, my family and I wold be physically harmed if not killed.

They are quickly becoming obsessed with /r/russialago as well. Best thing to do is filter out accounts of these goofballs with res or your favorite app. You'll never see their drivel and they won't even know their message isn't getting out.

I did this as Japan, it crippled the us Navy and they never recovered. 
I think it is probably because of the way AI is hardcoded to counter some player actions, if they can. If you pay close attention to the other side of the world in games you play, you start to notice a pattern of chaos or instability in regions most removed from the player.
They really want us to hate each other, hmm? It should be important for people on every shade of our political spectrum to understand: ***Russian intelligence has no desire for any of us to like each other. They won't push any propaganda that promotes American unity.***

I bought a game from the German gamesplanet a while ago. No troubles at all. I'm a fan of their store.
If anyone here gets the division, hit me up and I'll give you my Uplay or steam. I'll be happy to help people that are stuck in that game because it can be tough to matchmake when leveling and sometimes the loot luck is pretty bad leaving you at a disadvantage. Money gains aren't great lower levels and they are trivial at 30. I mostly play solo and helping people out is definitely a motivator for me to get in the game more.
I'd do RoF jus on the fact that the sound quality in the movie is so much better than the show. Sounds great on the surround.

I think the idea is that whoever fills the power vacuum in the investigation and in the Justice department will be more favorable(read: I'm not a puppet you're the puppet) to Trump and will squash any additional lines of inquiry.
"Whatever! We just don't like you okay?"
I agree, though if you put on your six piece nomad you feel a bit like neo in the matrix and that's fun for a bit.

There are a million warehouses in Kentucky that hire literally anyone. The one I used to work at got so desperate for hires they loosened the rules for a guy who was so fucked up all the time we ended up just teaching him how to build pallets all wrong, sending him over to piss off the dock guy constantly. The things we did for entertainment at the produce warehouse...the food fights we had. That was a shitty job but rednecks sure do know how to have fun with what you have.
I've swept the LZ bosses a few dozen times and only just today did I get an exotic(Eir I believe. One of those two SMGs I never plan to use.), I don't even see set pieces drop, much less classified. I can't say it bothers me much because I  actually have something to hunt for in the LZ now. If I hadn't completed a few good sets during the GEs I would probably be a lot more frustrated.

>How exactly does some random person's hyperbolic language change someone else's political ideology? 

They're pliable to indoctrination because they've been ministered to their whole life to buy into faith and letting the group think for themselves. Someone else being weak willed doesn't make their vote my fault, they need to read a fucking book for once. I would say nonfiction, but honestly most don't even read the Bible, you can learn a lot of charity from it still, even while ignoring the deistic parts.

Yeah the "white christians only who mate with white christians too but no poors please and if you're gay you're not allowed in the cool heaven club(except if you say gays are bad) sponsored by Amway and the Dallas cowboys" club is totally the left's fault. Even better with the dog whistles. The Alt right hides from their own flaws by saying "liberals do it worse" and stamp around like a petulant child crying "hypocrisy!" when groups aren't inclusive of their hate.

The thing is, they don't stop identifying and just stop being Republicans. They just stop identifying. We aren't going through some kind of paradigm shift, the same thing happened toward the end of the bush years and Republicans hibernated until the big scary black man woke them up. They'll be missing until a stronger and clearer message comes along and they'll be goose stepping in no time again.

I personally think writing is their big struggle. If they're doing a dub I have confidence because their voices are pretty strong. They otherwise suffer from some maturity issues in the writing that just misses me really often.
I don't think they're stupid per se, I think their circumstances don't warrant much investigation. First, they have a dog king which throws traditional thought out the window. Second, they don't have the internet, and if you remember before the internet there were things you just didn't know. No quick Google, and if your encyclopedia is out of date, what will you do? For people not well connected to sources of information, the search generally stops here(or at the local library). I bet humans in the Dragonball world are very religious given the unexplainable miracles. They revere Satan because he spoke to them from heaven once and presumably saved the world a few times.

I've lurked here for a few years. I've observed the subreddit is full of mostly later stage learners. The group is filled with (many, not all)elitists who seem to relish the idea of new learners struggling like they did, or worse. New learners are certainly welcome here, but this gatekeeping cabal will downvote any nuanced discussion between anyone without a strong grasp on the language and anyone else. When I was new to Japanese I found it most useful to lurk and scrape useful resources from the actually helpful subscribers here until I'd built my own foundation.
That is some world-class projection right there lol

The real plan is to ruin NAFTA relations. They want to set up the strawman that our allies don't even like us and throw that at the base. Add the 'trade war' and there's economic hardship that no one on the far right will look at  objectively. Just watch, next week he will antagonize Canada to make them mad. Deploying the same NG troops because "Canada legalized weed and we can't have another cartel country on our border." We can't forget destroying NAFTA was one of his bullet points during the campaign and his base is thoroughly convinced NAFTA means "any American out of work is a result of Mexicans or Canadians carrying their job across the border, definitely not economic trends or the viability of an industry falling through the floor."

Same here. I'm on PC and aside from the new patch I don't play much but would be more than happy to help out in tough spots. I did the leveling completely solo and found it very frustrating at times just like OP, probably because of how hard it is sometimes to find or buy useful loot.
Overextension reduces dip rep up to -1 based on overextension percent I think. Might have parts of that wrong.
I think this behavior starts as a defense against ridicule from others. Because of the way our minds work it quickly becomes tiresome to keep up the charade, and once you've worn yourself down enough trying to justify this wrong answer, you have to internalize this lie in order to keep yourself "in the right." It probably helps a lot to be in a group of "High energy people" with the same internalized lie, the others you are exposed to will help reinforce your internalized lie with the endorphin release of upvotes, likes, shares, or whatever. It seems so insidious when you start to realize most of the community are bots parroting the same "high energy" confirmation biases. 

I don't believe this disinformation campaign stops at bullshit news deceiving those on the far right. I think they're everywhere those on the left and right discuss their position. I think they sit and wait for the potential for positive discourse between both sides, and derail it by "smashing" the weaker side and spreading high fives to the group. I think they do this to keep us divided and reinforce any hate between us.
I don't think it'll change. Both games I've played so far(England to GB and Lucca to Italy) have left the same tree. You can test it by making a copy of your save if Ironman.
I see the plastic cell kit with a light blowtorching. It kind of all looks like melted plastic to me.
Your modmail you got is telling. The ad team is just as scum as the admins(or probably the same people) are and nothing they say can be trusted. The whitelist is a bullshit bandaid to get /r/stopadvertising off their backs and out of their pockets. Maybe they should get a small loan from thiel again.
Yeah I used that pakhan a lot when I hit wt5 and started collecting good set pieces. Good stuff when you can't get anything else to drop.

"Oh no, you accidentally caught us."
I guess so. I don't think they've given any other footage.
yeah its just a GIF I made of the trailer with only the animation.
If they changed the capitalization, it could be a funny play on words. "European union has left the European Union."
Oh yeah I definitely don't complain, that striker set and a hungry hog I got at the same time moved me from "carried" to "sometimes carrier." It gave me another 20+ hours of enjoyment in the game, easily. I usually don't like the grindy part unless I get a little luck from the loot gods, I probably would have stopped playing for a while otherwise.
Sometime you feel like you did a good job and that's satisfying enough.
Wasn't mortis some kind of weird pocket force singularity or something? I watched those episodes recently but I have to admit I don't remember the fine details.
+1 for Gboard. You can swipe if you want(I personally don't) and use a bunch of different layouts or themes. Also one of the few good ones I tried that lets you change the #ms delay for long press.
An It company I worked for had a huge cryptolocker problem in 2015. It turned out the contract for Symantec ran out in February, and nobody noticed until March, when a guy(one of those way-too-nosy guys) calls in and says his definitions are way out of date. 2 weeks of bureaucracy and blame game later, we switch to McAfee because of favorable contracts already in place with Intel or something. Operations managed to make that process as painful as possible too.
I think this is for SEO, I doubt most people writing recipes on a blog really want to write 1200 words for their favorite bangers and mash.
90% of my recipes started on serious eats. I've been so successful cooking meals from that site I'm honestly disappointed when they have no data on a recipe I'm looking for.
I wouldn't be surprised if that one didn't perform as well in markets as they'd hoped and that result dictated their remake policy moving forward.
Maybe if you tried turning off the shit faucet and actually communicated like an adult?

Nature does things that sometimes work accidentally and passes them on if they are genetic. Humans do the same but have the ability to pass complex ideas through generations, and this ability by its own nature refines itself as time passes. It is natural, but unnatural at the same time.

Knowing how dumb goku is sometimes, I think he's going to find creative new ways to get his ass beat to a pulp by opponents that are inferior to jiren. Cue Vegeta's angst and a flashback to when he tried the same thing and still wasn't strong enough to beat Freeza. Bonus points if Goku becomes addicted to the asswhoopings and we get a Whis scene scolding goku for losing sight of the prize. Double bonus points if we get a "get help" style goku vs vegeta double cross scene where they fight each other while the villain is watching(confused?) in order to unlock MUI. Since they clearly push each other to the limits, I won't be surprised if that becomes the 'Arc lesson.'
I did this a while ago and use /r/all when I get bored. I spend a few minutes a day scanning account karma on frontpage posts and filtering any account with more than 100,000 post karma per year. I think even that is pretty generous. After a bit you stop seeing posts from the huge regurgitation accounts and you start noticing the spammy useless accounts when they pop up by the post types(generally gifs or image shitposting) and title scheme. 
They don't seem to get that pretending to be racist for an audience is not something non-racist people want or think would be fun to do.

I don't know if that counts the port authority, who watches all the bridges, tunnels, airports and bus terminals. They're basically cops too. I used to do tech support for the PANYNJ and the cops were surprisingly the coolest of the bunch. "Eyy buddy you a pollack?

I am curious, as someone with no coding experience(not for lack of trying), and a narrow knowledge of that side of Ethereum. I have an idea for an app, but I have many questions about how gas, contracts, and the like are and can be used. If someone made an app on the ethereum blockchain, would the blocks *have* to have some sort of monetary value? Is there some sort of way to avoid mining by having all users do a bit of mining in the process of using said application? 
I've also taken to blocking users with absurd amounts of post karma. Checking high posts on /r/all and blocking clear content regurgitation accounts. Personally I don't want a small group of people(regardless of left or right alignment) being a majority of what I see on reddit, so I filter users with an average more than 100,000 post karma per year. it's cleaning my reddit up a whole lot.
I think this subreddit getting banned would probably gain us a lot of supporters against reddit. Especially when everyone sees why. They were banned for cussing at the admins? wow. This guy over here openly thinks blacks and jews should be skinned.

Not that I'm advocating that sort of behavior. I just think in the grand scheme of our attempts to fight unwanted content by attacking their revenue stream, it's worth discussing.

I found before 30 I needed to find a good weapon to help me out, so I would scout the advanced weapons vendor for days until I got a black market m60. I stacked as much stability as I could and it really got me going a lot faster.
I was in wt5 in just a few hours after hitting 30 because I followed this strategy. Best advice for someone leveling imo.

I started doing this a little over a year ago, inviting people over, offering to cook meals, sharing the best weed. Its made me a generally happier person. I enjoy the company of others so much more and they seem to feel the same way about me. Giving simple things without expecting anything in return is very fulfilling.
It really stretches your suspension of disbelief, doesn't it? I know dragonball universes are portrayed in sort of a teacup size, but only 28 planets is difficult to even intentionally happen.
They're namekians so I'd presume they have non-warrior class people who weren't absorbed, and therefore dragonballs on their end are possible and might be able to undo the damage. They might not be able to because the dragon's wish powers are limited(I believe Shenron's said he can't grant a wish over a being who's power dwarfs his own.

That is how you do it in iron man nowadays. You open the stats screen before the game is over and press continue. It gives you no notification that it worked other than the warning that dates after 1821 is not developed for the regular game. It will breeze right past the end date. 
That's a downvote troll. Their normal opinion isn't good enough so they have to fill it in with something people especially don't like, just to feel normal. It is remarkably pathetic.
Pause the game and click the button that shows the stats(same as the endgame screen) and press continue playing.

I'll switch over. I'm sick of youtube and pornhub had just the right foundation for good video content(fair rules, supporting amateur content creators, etc) and a clean video platform with all the same features will be the next big adspace. If they do it right they will be fucking BIG.

I honestly don't remember the character creation in this game. My guy looks almost exactly like Bernard from Westworld, and I've been playing under the assumption this appearance was randomly chosen. I quit shortly after release and only recently started playing again.
Yeah this is definitely the answer. Let's get a discord together and the admins have no control of the narrative. They can delete posts and comments here outright if they want, but not on discord.

All I ask is we get this over before the season begins. If burrow loses out and wants to transfer he shouldn't have to wait until half the year's over to figure it out. The whole team deserves better for what it's worth.
From what I've seen/heard, he has a huge superiority complex over the fact that he voices goku, won't interact with former VA's that did goku, even to the extent that he gets them shut out of cons/panels he wants to attend.

I've checked openraid a few times in the past year and it really is on life support. I'm a solo player that barely ever wants to deal with others ingame and even I found the IG group finder much superior to openraid by the quantity of available raids alone.
I am working on figuring out a way to do this with all the software I have and use. I'm a hobbyist so I really don't know probably 90% of the tools available to me but I'll definitely get back to you on this, even if I can't figure it out.
I think there's probably someone out there willing to do the math on the difference between flying(which they call [bukujutsu](https://thedaoofdragonball.com/blog/martial-arts/bukujutsu-explained/)), and shooting max power blasts in the opposite direction. I know Krillin used it once to save 18, I don't doubt there's some kind of pushback from these universe shattering shots they're taking.
You're right! I'm fixing them right now. I made a pretty simple mistake and I can't believe I didn't spot it. I think they'll look way better in a minute and I'll edit the OP.
I finally feel like I'm a credit to the team after the loot I managed to get in these GE's. I felt like a carry before and that was why I originally stopped playing.

NPCs seem to have some sort of table separate from their aggro table specifically for grenades. I started noticing a pattern during lex runs when I'd be the last one off the start point. I'd barely make line of sight to the guys but they would lob a grenade at me like they knew I was coming, no shots fired.

Okay I'll throw my OKC profile out there. The Division has been way up in my list since their awful state at release. I started playing again, got the season pass on a really good discount, and I'm having more fun than ever. They have a loot patch coming out too that will increase drop rates and give more opportunities for gear set pieces that will let lots more people get in on the endgame gear meta. I'll have to remember the name but the division subreddit sees destiny 2 converts all the time and is very welcome to friendly new and returning players. /r/thedivision is the sub and there is a huge discord group for finding squads as well. I bet prices will see more drops soon since the sequel got announced. 

Edit: looks like the sub is /r/thedivision. sorry y'all
my mother pretended beets were a delicious candy in front of my sister when she was an infant and she continues to like beets to this day. I believe it works.
Yeah I held off the US Navy with about 10 carriers and 25 battleships(as Japan) They had a 300+ fleet originally, they were never the same after I triggered a fascist civil war though. 90 ships after they beat the fascists.
He'll tell you for about tree fiddy OBO
Because I started playing again, of course. Isn't that how it works for everyone else?
I once ran lex with the wrong gear on, thinking it was my striker set. I had played around in my inventory before logging out previously and forgot about it. I died so many times. I noticed at the end and felt crappy, I changed it back and on the next run I killed it like I used to. I try not to judge when people have a hard time because the interface is more than a little janky sometimes, it is easy to overlook a lot of stuff that might accidentally make you terrible.
I remember that. I think along with Encarta(maybe?) it also had a magic School bus themed animation studio game.

Can confirm, weird analysis is my only appreciated party trick.
They're just trying to drum up public support. That's all their organization has been good for in the past, so they fall on what worked. At this point they don't have any new smarts on their team other than the nixon lawyer(and they don't know who else might be a snitch, remember when spicer was checking staffer phones to find leaks?), so he's likely just telling them how to exercise their options less dumbly. They are far worse at genuine grassroots efforts than they think.

Our stray rescue ended up having the name 'Jace' on his tag. Owner didn't want him and he didn't respond to it, so we started calling him 'Butter' and he loves it. People look at me like I'm crazy, nobody ever catches the reference and just go "why Butter?"

Well because he's the fastest in the universe!

That is a false equivalence. Sugar has a destructive effect and can cause diseases with simple overconsumption. Cannabis doesn't have this, governments use the fact that it is illegal as a reason to keep it illegal. They used racism to push it's illegality in the first place. If sugar were illegal, people *would* kill each other over it. It is a delicacy compared to other sweeteners.
Everything is deceptive. They are a content provider and this is all marketing.they don't care if any of us knows what is going on TBH.
I got that green Drake on my first egg and never went back to those dailies on any character, ever since. I didn't want to look a gift Drake in the mouth, and I hated dailies.
 I think cutting them off while the crimes are happening is showing your cards too early. If that doesn't work they know who their enemies are and after the election can purge undesired elements from the government.

That's basically what I ended up with on tinder. Starting a conversation,trying to give personality, but getting none. I was usually the one who stopped talking.

They have GOT to get Democrats into their state government. Only then can they fight back against all those companies using the place as a dumpster.
I think Dan and Arin have good chemistry and are funny a lot. Sometimes they get stuck on something and can't stop doing something incredibly annoying, but otherwise their banter is pretty awesome. They are intelligent on lots of differing subjects so they have good flow in what they talk about, and they catch all the Simpsons references everywhere. 
How many did I matchmake into that were doing challenging and crucial assault, giving the enemies the bonus and not the players. After a while of finding bad groups that didn't know how to set the modifiers right I gave up and farmed Lexington. Outside of that I just loved matchmaking into groups that were using the tool to do "no downs" runs, who would just say that when you show up, wasting a few minutes of your time.

The dope in prison's even better than ever, so we got that goin for us.
My experience makes me think it's a mod. By comparison the meiou mod for eu4 does this to my game without fail every time. I would test a new game without it for a bit and see if it behaves better.
For current version I think you choose "no beta" or maybe it says "opt out"
I only ever remember seeing raid buffed warlocks and hunters in sunwell hit a sustained 3k+ in BC.
Whenever people use carefully pointed attacks against a group (like "you people" or "liberals always...") I don't see any reason to acknowledge the post. There are Russian elements trying to divide every part of US society, even people on the same "team". Let's just ignore those sort of divisive posts about this group or that group and hopefully we can fight for all Americans at once and hopefully help both sides be a little more empathetic towards one another. They want us to hate 'them' and when we crush one of 'them' and high five each other they won, but we think we did. It's a victory for the agent. The only way we win is to downvote and not acknowledge the troll.

I heard *we're* actually the fascists because we won't let them put on their hoods and play "pretend to be fascist but not really" and try to scare black people.
I didn't necessarily say I thought we weren't coming back.
One of the OST songs released recently is called "ChōzetsuDynamic! (Defeat Ver. )" and it sounds fucking depressing as hell. I haven't seen it in the show yet, I think we're going to lose.
I wish I could watch the Buu saga again for the first time.
Wait this is out already? The preview was just a couple of days ago. I gotta get it haha.
He even needed a Dragonball senzu bean wish to beat Buu. The spirit bomb itself wasn't even enough.
I think we see it in the preview. Goku gets run through by something Jiren throws at him and he's already powered up. It looks like it really hurts too.
I think Vegeta owes Yemma a favor first. STRIP
[Its important that everyone understands what Russia did, the Trump campaign accepting that, asking for it, and directing its release are all illegal as fuck under US Law.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/30121)

That stupid thing with Garrosh, I was so mad because I went into a free carry(The only one I got into) on my warrior hoping to get a 2H, which would be my mainspec weapon in WoD. It gave me the 1h Sword. I had no idea fury spec would give me that weapon and ended up guardian spec leveling. It really turned me off my warrior in a big way.

with abridged you can easily use keywords to find exactly which episode and it works on most of them. Just start off with 'DBZ abridged' and end with whatever keywords apply. For example try searching 'DBZ abridged vegeta gets his ass kicked' and it should return all of said episodes.
What are some links to the most popular scene groups? I've Googled a few occasionally and it's hard to sift through the fakes sometime(I'm on mobile so if this is in a wiki page somewhere I apologize, let me know and I'll dig around there.) Thanks.
I always thought it was Ohio because they are a "Northern Kentucky family."
I think Buu is a hax level character in the universe. He's a counter to almost every opposing fighter in the tournament, so I wasn't surprised when he took a nap. The writers would have had to make up a lot of shit to make his fights feasible, I think he would win and we'd never stop complaining about it.
Then he should have gotten a finder's fee
Trump didn't even need to get into a war to waste a trillion dollars, it seems worse to me. Plus the millions of people losing insurance will probably translate to more deaths than the 4500 or so from Iraq and Afghanistan.
I bought that 5000g for epic flying on my first toon in 2007, from a gold farming website for 200 dollars.

It's funny how this guy calls out projection by projecting even worse.
I think most of the Trump supporters will try and pretend they never voted for him anyway. It falls in line with their and his thinking when confronted.

and we'd likely be watching it a whole 12 hours earlier.
I think it is less of that and more "buyer's remorse." They don't care if a game is good or bad or not at all their taste, they talk shit about it(often exposing how little they know about the game or genre) just to make themselves feel better about the ones they do play and like, sometimes getting bonus vindication from another tool who dropped by just to hate.
These are probably the same people that think all the noobs are going to go be noobs again for classic and bring back their fun.
If Jiren was knocked off, the tournament would just be over then and there. They wouldn't let freeza just up and steal the win after it was over. Goku would have to double out jiren knowing that freeza was still there, or frieza would have to kill or out goku just before he was about to win. 
I think there's an interaction in the show where Beerus basically says "Yeah but you don't know when he was planning on doing that, if he ever will" regarding that point, which is a good one(I might be making this up, I have to check.). Zeno only seemed to ever do something when someone reminded him about it.
I have been wondering for a while if they were going to give jiren the wish at the end. He asks Goku how this all came about, how he became in possession of the god power. Goku loves telling a good tale so he talks about Beerus's dream of the super saiyan god. Jiren knocks goku off, becomes winner, and then wishes away the dream that brought beerus to goku, leaving him asleep for years and years more, letting the earth and all the other universes live in peace.
I never thought I would get so sick of seeing familiar characters talking in this show. The tournament has been kind of a disappointment to me just because the writers and animators were in a corner from the start as to what they were allowed to do. I think we kind of see the strain from this when we see the universe tuning into their own defeat(was it 4 I think?). Previously we had been told the void realm was outside of time. They just had no choices for what the audience was doing so they always ended up reusing animations, or had them narrate what we were already seeing just to fill up screen time.

I used my legion boost on a mage so I wouldn't have these problems on any toon.
Nobody on the left even has the ratings numbers to even suggest the same as the right.
Also, the port fad has been on since the Switch was announced. One of the few games available on launch was a port of a popular 2-year old PS4 game.
Dbz was in an evening slot and super is a Sunday morning show so the violence has to be muted.
There's also a drive thru liquor store made out of what I believe was an old Burger King not too far from there, a hilarious landmark I always point out to friends.

I logged out and back in, no toons on any servers.

No, it didn't. Also, source your claim.
There isn't a systemic cultural distrust in the government here in the US because of that. There is a retarded subset of our population who believes that vaccines cause autism, and the group doesn't really overlap with the group you're talking about. It's mostly middle aged white women who think they're smarter than a doctor. 
Make a ticket and they'll make you GM if you aren't already.
I think you're out of luck. I've had that happen in colony shenanigans(feeding native or colony land to OPM vassals to make lots of 10 province colonies upon integration) and it's something you can't really avoid. The colonies don't have any ruler of ruler logic so they rival and fight just like they would otherwise.

There is no way to 'make' them do it outside of core, add, and release. If they're small enough and feel threatened from outside the HRE however, they will add themselves if they can.
I live in a TWC area and about 5 months before the merger I got a letter from TWC stating, because I was one of their 'extreme' customers(the max I could get was 50 down, which I consistently got 80 of) they would be upgrading my service in the coming months to 250 down as part of a gigabit overhaul. That came and went and I don't think they ever came through for any of their customers. I'll never be a customer of charter or Time Warner in either of their forms, ever. I'm sick of being lied to and no internet is better than their version of it.

It's portals for me. I have to spam click the fuckers.
all the bosses in raids are scaled to fuck you levels now.
I think this is the best option. Since zones, loot, and quest rewards are now normalized, there is no justification for keeping all 110 levels in the game. By doing another stat squish they are going to make the problem even worse.
can confirm, I had RAF accounts of mine from wrath days that I resubbed during cata to get the free 80, and then the obsidian nightwing passenger mount. The system picked up right where it left off, and I think you can still see your RAF buddies in your account settings page.
I did this for my grandmother's birthday. She always made me simple but delicious things when I was a kid, so for her 77th birthday I went to her place and made a giant pot of homemade macaroni and cheese. She was absolutely delighted and it really made my year. 
American cheese is good combined with certain flavors, but only really when melted. The texture is everything. I put some American cheese(among the main cheeses I use) in my recipe for macaroni and cheese and the texture it adds to the whole thing just works.

Trump turns out to be the best GOTV strategy the Democratic party ever put in place.
Also since a snowflake reproduces asexually it cannot be a virgin.
if bitcoin or any crypto came even close to eliminating banks, there would be an army of lobbyists with millions in hand ready to destroy it. Nobody would be able to buy crypto in the united states and any country harboring an exchange selling to Americans would get cut out. Look at what the feds did to monero and it's private transactions. You are essentially branded a criminal just for buying it.
Yeah anecdotes don't really mean anything in this discussion. It doesn't matter that there are 30-50s crypto investors on this sub, the ones that matter way more are the vast majority of those outside of this community who don't have a clue about it.

She thought I had messaged, then saw the trans part, and got mad when I didn't respond to her response after an hour or so. Said something super mean off the cuff, I told her basically I was an ally and didn't really consider that a big deal. She apologized but by that point I was upset by the whole thing and decided not to continue the conversation.

I matched a trans woman on OKC and made an innocent comment about my favorite golden girl to break the ice. I watched a movie and came back to something to the tune of "problem with your masculinity talking to a trans person?" I was pretty devastated. Lesson I learned is there are assholes everywhere.
I agree. Any tank class definitely, my rogue is mostly untouched but it was my main in WoD and maybe with leech it can burn things fast enough. I've done nithogg easily on the lock and will probably give heroics a go when I have enough time. Either way it's a great time to be a lock, even if it's just to level up a toon really quick.
I can solo 5 man normals with my lock, using prydaz and sacrolash. Face tank bosses no problem.

I share the sentiment about legion, for myself lately I've been really weirdly nostalgic about MoP. I mostly play solo and do old raids and stuff for fun, and the music and setting of the expansion makes me really wish I could play it as current content again. I loved my warlock back then.

OP said they use multiple exchanges and they don't think other exchanges have deposit fees. I am just confirming one that I have used has deposit fees. Thank you for letting me know you already know this.
Bitfinex has a deposit fee if you do lower than a certain amount I believe. I took all my funds off there a week ago or so though so and I haven't checked.
I regret the cash shop mounts mostly because I judge people when I see them riding one. I've spent a long time trying to be less of a dick in the game and that is one I have trouble shaking off.
You can, you just need to make a mod for it. A long time ago I modded the notify windows for stuff like techs and focuses finishing to close with 'c' instead of enter like eu4 because my hand is *never* over there. 
The coinbase photo is being pulled by people's apps(maybe it's Reddit?) From your first link on the page. It has a bunch of crypto logos but about the fourth one is coinbase. I don't think you can fix it without just deleting the link, and even then it might not fix it.
I don't think it's bad at all. It's beautiful and very well developed. I bought it on PS4 when I first bought the console and I just couldn't play the game like I did other RPGs. It had way too much going on at once be fun for *me* and I lost interest after trying.
It is entirely possible all of the gains up to the ATH were just people looking to cash in on coinbase and they're now bailing because of no coinbase.
Fuck now it makes so much sense why they've been trying to gaslight us with pizzagate so long. If he goes down for child prostitution, I don't know how to feel. All the Republicans need to burn in that scenario.
Buying at an ATH seems like a winning strategy
Fair enough, I took mine back. I was drinking last night but no excuse for me to be so presumptive. I still disagree that we would have won, I'm just not that sure about our play calling this year in really big games. I think with a better QB for the system we will be much better next year though. I hope we see a rematch and best of luck!
I thought for sure the guy filming was going to eat shit on the way back. So I guess the gif as-is was kind of unexpected?

Muh daddy tole me
The system I built for my SO has a Q8300 in it and an RX 540(I believe) and it runs great. She plays wow and Sonic mania with no trouble at all. I think socket 775 has been out of production for 6 years now?
I still have a beta invite in my inventory for the Android client
I guess we should all just pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and try enjoying our shitty work.
I'll give you gold if that prediction is true within 10 points either way or even if we end up losing by that much.
You basically said nothing and are bitching about downvotes? Get outta here
Anything to demonize someone you're told not to like. It's pretty pathetic how hard he tries to imply his own intelligence
In some places, yes it is.
That's a good way to have destiny manifested
I can't believe I never knew Russia owned that little bit near Poland. I stare at maps all the time and I still never knew it.
Haha guys I was just kidding I was only pretending to be retarded
No. The supreme Court found that bans on either are unconstitutional.
I think unless a character says something about it, it's probably nothing. Vegeta obviously does something new next episode though, so maybe they're just holding off? I do really like how both Goku and Vegeta moved around together this episode though, I think one of the next two episodes is going to be incredible for both.
He still can't fucking get over Obama lol these people saying respect the president are seriously out of touch with humanity
Pointing out short-sighted thinking isn't going to convince a short-sighted person
Participate is way too big a word for actual Trump fans
Watch as their hero gets the same treatment they're subbed to TRP for, she ends up mooching off of him for years!
I saw that. I remarked that the lightning was something I had never seen before.
I agree. I think they're going to end up doing nothing with freeza, which was my only other personal theory.
Its for this reason I don't ever feel bad pirating anything. If the ISPs had ownership of all the content providers, we would have to pay for *previews* of shit. 
[The DBZ manga doesn't say they ran out of fusion early at any point.](https://i.imgur.com/UrjNqif.png)
do you want to give someone the opportunity to try? 
I wouldn't be surprised if they retcon it at some point, but I don't think Gotenks ever had a "broken apart before we expected it" moment. That said gogeta would be a huge fanservice moment and people who take the show too seriously would be mad. Personally, I would do terrible favors to see gogeta blue end up in the show.
I want to see the post yuuzhan vong map
I think smart money still bets on no. Until one of the cryptos puts the market cap idea to bed then you shouldn't be planning on gigantic increases into the double digits with an ultra-high circulation.
I just traded in all mine because I figured they'd be a gray item I could vendor eventually. Dammit.
They don't salt the water. I can't ever give money to a company that fucks up cooking noodles that badly.
There were two years where bitcoin was the entire crypto market cap before another was introduced. Not the same thing in the least bit. 
Maybe they're Scottish or Irish?
I am, but I am also terrible at the competitive fighting games. I'm torn between buying it because its DBZ, but not because I really don't like the genre.
I haven't personally heard of him but I wonder where his recruiting pipeline is.
I've had a death stalker keyboard for years and I love it. I've taken it apart to clean and fix issues and I've probably spilled beer on the damn thing ten times. Except for that shitty Razer software that keeps wanting to install itself, I have no complaints about it.
Adding slices of American in my homemade macaroni and cheese recipe gives it a delightful texture.
I have no ties to UCF or Florida the state and I would proudly wear a UCF Natty shirt.
I'd trade almost all the ssrs I've pulled this banner for a UI at this point. I'm laughing at how disappointed in this pull I am.

Or just taste the powder. That would be a lot easier to sleuth out than taking a whole mysterious pill
And then you get the slow ring and suddenly you don't even care about the wq tickers anymore, you just kill everything and walk away slowly.
Me too. All my XRP is on bitfinex but I'm afraid to withdraw because I see stories about people having fees all jacked up(on the bfx side) and losing their money.
I think the committee is ESPN handwavy bullshit. It's hosted on their TV channels and gets a 12 hour special to maximize commercials. It all feels like I'm being taken for a ride by a dude who never got disciplined for stealing from the cookie jar as a kid and now thinks he can get away with anything.
I loved this movie because it felt stylistically like a real movie that could have come out before ANH, barring a few cgi moments.
I did this right after Charlie's announcement and it worked out pretty well.
Shit for me it was always for their beauty section so I just paid for the faster shipping.
I like that gogeta figure. I don't think I've ever seen it before. It has great coloring.
Maybe department of public safety or something similarly conglomerated?
I already have a switch and will probably get one of these for the massive modding capability it has. I might also just hack it and sell it to someone dumb on facebook for twice as much.
Except "Slamming the door" is subjective. Notice I didn't say "too hard by my standards." as I would not slam(by my definition of the word) any car door.
Oh I just noticed that. I feel kind of dumb now.
Aw they even said it politely
I once shut a door too hard and then noticed the sign saying "don't slam the door!!!" In the car. I don't know what they expect.
I sold my last eth(bought @ 300) for XRP the other day at 700 lol. I think I'm going to make more with XRP but its been a nice laugh each time I check the price.
Why of course it's the dumb white people we duped into voting for us
I'm mostly mad they seasoned the eggs before cooking them.
Yeah I can't be mad when we don't get all the 5*s. They're still young adults and deserve a chance at a good experience.
I did a France RP game recently and I think having a CoR inside a big country will stall out the Reformation for decades while it converts your provinces(if you flip religions and need converting.) I think it prioritizes those ones somehow.
I mean this sub is basically adspace for those companies and the tech rags that review them.
This was your fault
I know if it was me I'd end up getting doinked in the head trying to get out from under it

That dude literally lives off trolling people in this subreddit. Tag them or ignore them so you won't get caught up in a pointless exchange in the future.
I assume we don't see an after shot because Scotland took a white peace or something.
your dudes look like they're rolling up to a dogpile on roller skates, I am having so much fun.
Someone told them they weren't allowed to throw past the line of scrimmage.
Are you fucking kidding me I had to slow everything with corruption and run around like an idiot 500 times to beat that.
I had a single eth for a bit that I bought at 300 and just traded over to ripple last night. I'm more confident in ripple not falling with Bitcoin even though eth has been a safe place to keep it for a while.
+1 for mighty Mo. My favorite player when I was just getting into football.
Clemson is okay because they're the easy pick. The SEC needs to die on the cross for us this year for the good of all of football.
ALL ABOARD THE DWAYNE PAYNE TRAYNE
We get to claim this as a title right?
All aboard the Dwayne Trayne
Those games are a godsend. The commercials drove me away from being an NFL fan, for real. This Superior Bitching brought to you by Superior Auto.
Is it a controversial thought to not care about watching the natty if its two SEC teams? I will accept my fate on this one.
I really wish there were fewer commercials in football and it might justify me watching more games. I just can't offer my time to stuff like that.
in before "b-but they were ranked that week!"
Ripple made me $400 this last few hours! I'm fucking wasted
All aboard the Dwayne trayne
I do not. Buckeyes have almost guaranteed cushy jobs in c-bus.
At least it was in our weakest area. Defense is on fucking point
I find solace in my biggest defeats. I made it past them and look forward.
That was like 5 guys on the tackle
Fuck that if we 31-0 meme darnold we deserve redemption it's like a final boss
Well until now my plan was always a helium bag, but the crypto market is starting to pay off...
Can I get a 31-0? Is this how we reverse the meme?
I earned another few hundred XRP in this dip. I'm ready for the coinbase bump.
Yes perhaps I meant to say I lost my faith in the LTC market. LTC is a good tech I just don't think news is playing in its favor until most people forget about everything going on this month.
I sold all of my LTC for ripple when LTC was $314 shortly after the 'announcement' and I've made a fair amount. 
I sold litecoin at 314 and I don't think it's been that high since I did, a few hours after Charlie sold all his LTC. Lost all my faith in LTC.
A sexbot Lamborghini hybrid- the sexlambo!
Yeah he is quite a bit chunkier.
Yeah but that's a lot harder than pissing all over myself on reddit
Correct but since they were talking about note 4's I figured I would chime in because most note 4's are easily rooted.
Titanium backup all your apps, wipe reset, restore a few at a time. Never fails to help me root out bad apps and keep everything fresh.
Where the obvious ads are called out every time so they said fuck it and just post the logo. Then sprinkle a little bit of "I love this brand they have there" and "I spend so much money there it's like a steam sale" and you're basically posting the Tuesday sales on Reddit while uaranteeing views.
Half a million "users" lol
I could probably donate just as much as I spend to charity each year and still live super well.
I think I read somewhere that most of the gold on the planet is near or at the core because of how dense it is and how molten early earth used to be, but I don't recall where I read it.
Who has also likely been watching liars' faces and vitals for more than 40 years.
When I used to play jp I would screenshot on my phone, and run the pic through the Google translate app.
I think they're used to awaken more   common cards, like srs. I spent some on mine earlier because I had maxed out too.
You just started using actual legal terms? That's ableist. These T_D posters haven't had their US government classes in high school yet, no fair.
Yeah but our warlocks in sunwell also did like 4000 DPS so I can't fault them for doing what worked as boring as it might be.
Man I wish I could get that damn starter card for Gohan. I picked up global again around Thanksgiving and though I've seen him on a couple of banner lists since then I haven't been lucky. I've been super lucky in other ways though so I'm still enjoying myself.
I don't know if it is still the same, but if your corpse makes it to another zone via load screen somehow and you don't release, the game would bring you back to life. I used to hellfire to death on the boat to northrend long ago and it would rez you on the other side. I would get really confused whispers from other passengers.
As much as I want to attribute maliciousness to it I'm beginning to think he's going to have records subpoenaed detailing Russian activity and terroristic planning. Once Twitter and Facebook began making news for their involvement on the ad front I had much less doubt that we'd see spez in the news for similar information. T_D user info would just be icing and if Reddit did in fact sell adspace to KGB trolls then keeping the sub open may just be them building leverage. I could also very likely be totally wrong.
I transferred .5 eth from coinbase(sp. Gdax) to bitfinex last night around 10 my time and didn't see it deposited until after noon today. Lots of angry users on the CB reddit today.
I bought almost 400 more last night before today's jump, feeling good!
Humanity as a whole should be ashamed. Normal people with futures in every aspect of society, so much knowledge just deleted from history. Part of our identity as a species was lost and we can never get it back. We'll never know the diseases that might have been cured, the pieces that might have been composed, the technologies that might have been invented. They probably would have too because many famous doctors, scientists, composers and inventors died along with so many children who never even got a chance. 
"I need to find a rest stop I've been driving way too long"
I thought it was the same in the show. I'll have to go back and check because I just can't recall.
I recall a raid tool or something, maybe ORA? Which would give you a recap of your raid's deaths and you could output to chat.
Can also confirm. Perhaps this one has compatibility to more sockets?

Honestly why would this hacker know who the customer is? I firmly believe there is collusion but I don't think the Russian government would let an asset get anywhere near the Trump team. I don't know how he would have any info that would help us outside of the DNC hack investigation.
Nobody pays attention. Even intelligent Americans can be too dumb to actually pay attention to the political system.
I bought 2 at 87 and another .8 at 170, I feel great every time I check it 😁
Found this on all, I think this is an interesting niche with poor other options. ESPN sucks ass and you might be able to steal some of the market if your product is well made.
I believe they patched this recently.
I've found I can solo dungeons at level as a lock, albeit slowly.

Alabama doesn't deserve any land they can go be some county in Mississippi if they want land
The NEP has Goku and Vegeta standing side by side in a brief clip and their lip flaps say the same thing. I looked up some old movies and episodes with fusion and I don't think they're saying fusion like they do in the dance, so I'm left wondering. I think it's speculation bait.
If you want a good read, check out the Sherman letters. It follows WT Sherman the general from a young age through his time at West Point Academy and on. He corresponds with his younger brother who eventually became a senator. Easily one of my favorite books from 19th century American history.
Because Putin will kill children in order to kill terrorists. The theater hostages were a political trap for him but the message it sent was "no negotiations, only death."
And they are doubling down on that front by adding all the Facebook shit. This willful ignorance amazes me.
The editing in this gif gave me motion sickness. How can one get it so fucking wrong?
In a recent job the 40 year vet that trained my group used the "no block" proxy on our smart board and later went to lunch without locking it up. We just went over and copied it down and shared it with the whole class as the few in there with IT background.
You ever use the console to buff a country that you aren't playing? I love the emergent story part of PDX games but sometimes the game balance prevents actual fun stories in my games. I like setting up darth vader so I can fight him later in my campaign, or shattering a longtime power, introducing potential for tons of emergent story in the region.
What the person in the comment above said- Implicit biases. It's the stuff some people bag in with racism and others get defensive about(because I think everyone does it on some level and nobody wants to be seen as a bad person, not excusing it). I'd go as far as saying it's a watering down of the term prejudice and a seed in the mind that can grow into actual racism.
Herbie got caught up in being a media figure and forgot how to be fair to people. 
I think this might not be canon because the manga didn't show it. 
That Black Goten reveal had me speaking in tongues
I worked at a few warehouses and we would absolutely do shit like this if the dock guy was being an asshole(sometimes orders were fucked up and it would give you stuff like this out of order). He'd just have to restack the whole pallet or if the sv or ops manager owed him a favor they could make you do it yourself. 
I bet the people who have heard the song and not seen Hamilton are a much much much bigger group than the people who have seen and heard both.
I mean slowly as in the paid stuff is all cosmetic. Those mounts don't move any faster, and switching from night elf to orc arguably doesn't give one any advantages. The closest thing to p2w in wow right now is the tokens. They want to push loot boxes so hard, they're basically setting us up for it with the emissary caches. I would casually bet that next expansion you can buy the equivalent of emissary caches with gold and probably enough will celebrate it that they get away with it. "Only an idiot would sell a token for caches, I'm spending my millions in saved up gold" people will say, but the whales they want will pay on unnoticed.
One crime at a time.
I came here from all, I've only played a few minutes of hearthstone personally. I'm not sure what news people are mad or happy with blizzard about around here, but I think as a long time wow player it is fair to say you need to always keep blizzard on their heels if you want to be happy as a customer. They are merged with Activision, who has been doing this nickel and dime shit to it's customers since before it became cool, and they're trying their hardest to slowly shoehorn it into wow so we as customers don't notice. Outrage is the only thing this company will listen to anymore. If it isn't severely impacting the public image of the company and the game, they will care less and less as the money keeps coming in. Stay vigilant and own your game!
I sometimes I'll end up in PvP realm world quests on my lock or I'll go do the PvP tower wq for kicks and I have never had anyone engage me. I don't attack either since I don't have to but I found it interesting. I wonder if PvP realms see a lot of scrapping in those quest zones.
I soloed nithogg the other day, I health funneled a lot but otherwise it was remarkably easy.
I've been affliction for years now, the state of Aff at the moment is the most fun I've had since the moving while casting days in pandaria. I hope paladins get their day soon too because I mained it so long ago.
I spilled water on my n3dsxl and it won't turn on anymore(single blue flash). I was looking forward to ultra moon too.
Which is why we must be vigilant and not let big money slip their charismatic Hitler in after the buffoon exits.

Dude our team would fucking demolish bama in a bowl this year.
Some people take karma so serious they spin shitty insults out of it. I don't DV based on flair but when I see DV bitching I can't help it.
I'm not complaining. I would argue for any other team in our position over bama though.
I felt the same way in reverse for FSU when we won the title.
If they give us bama I would be ecstatic. I would have so much confidence going into that game.
In before "bu-but they were ranked that week!"
Alabama isn't number one? Then it isn't the darkest timeline.
Bret Bielema has the biggest fucking head I ever seen.
I would be okay with this.

Dear Committee,

We bent over for you last year. Please do us a solid and give us the year off. 

Best wishes

/u/_TunnelSnakes_Rule 
is it a break though?
*Long drawn-out sigh*
It'll be a roughing the passer or offsides.
Lose and we only get laughed at for a few weeks as opposed to the whole offseason with a win?
I don't think our players want to go to the playoff 
The media wants it so they can talk about it and get views. I don't want to get plugged by Clemson again.
Why on earth would we throw it? oh yea.
They're punting? lmao this must be a fake.
I hope not. Let us beat up on ND or USC this year.
We didn't deserve it with that play call.
we were running out of play clock too, that's probably why they called it.
Ball needs to cross the plane I believe.
maybe we'll fumble it into our own endzone next drive just to fuck with you.

Isiah Prince was like the worst OL in the country last year but he's improved a lot, to my surprise.
man fuck all that I'd rather not even go to a bowl

This sponsoring of this discover card timeout has been sponsored by Buick.
Yay we somehow stopped their momentum by cutting up the field. Good thinking urbs.
I don't want to impress the committee lol
He can honestly stay in for all I care. We are running a train all over them on the ground.
Cincy here, all chain chili restaurants are fucking garbage
Dobbins makes me make sounds I didn't know you could make during football.
lets throw a bomb on 3 and 1?
One of those NCAA plays that fucks up the defense so badly linemen just stand there.
Dobbins gets out into the flat so fucking fast, Jt could have checked to him for 5-8 yards there I bet.
They did score tho
Defense has been saving us from our dumbass turnovers for a few years now it seems.
I agree, though my main theory on the tournament is it isn't going to end as scheduled and some crazy shit happens. I think it wraps everything up too neatly for the universes to get wished back and everything go as planned. Freeza's temporary revival going completely uneventful seems like a waste of potential in the story too.
And they threw out the filibuster rules so they won't be able to protest it.
I don't know if I'll see it in my lifetime but paradox please give me EU4 2444
If you aren't disenchanting stuff and vendor instead, your trip from 60-90 should make you at least 10-15k if you mostly quest.
Thats us!

"They can't keep getting away with it"


You should be ashamed.
They only have one timeout and our defense has been lockdown. Take the points to make it two possessions definitely
Let's see how we do next week.

Gus said Cardale Jones, Fulfilling another part of the prophecy!!!!
I thought so too.
Eat dicks, Duracell
This might fulfill the prophecy:

1. JT goes down with an ankle injury in the michigan game. out for the season. 

2. OSU uses a backup qb to throttle wisconsin a bajillion to nothing in the B1G CG to impress the comittee.

3. OSU kills the bama

4. OSU wins the title

I managed to luck out and pull both last time. I don't know if this banner is even meant for someone in my situation. I guess I can do the discounts trying to unlock more of ssj4 gogeta.
Aww I just wanted you to owe me ;)
Wait, is that how that works? I think we need some rocket appliances in here to make sure.
This is what not having strong consumer protection regulations probably gets us.
...Which is kind of the only thing you can do anymore to hope for a change, annoy the company on social media. I hate the TV industrial complex. We deserve better than what they provide and pay too much as it is.
My guess is they try making VPNs illegal like the UK tried(is trying?)
You seem like the kind of person who thinks Idiocracy is about the stupid people.
But if you do get some good ones, hoo boy are you about to have a lot of fun. I got the slow ring after it was buffed for my first legion legendary, it makes the open world the easiest thing to play solo in. That plus prydaz will make you able to pull entire wq zones worth of mobs(some invasions too) without taking any damage.
Very much this. On my paladin I have the "face of death" shield from naxx 40. It is my prized possession as nobody can get it anymore and the alternative is a different named shield that uses the same model from naxx 25. It seems silly for that reason but I keep it anyway, along with my tier 6 set from the last time I did progression raiding.
As a precaution I would delete settings.cfg from your documents/paradox/eu4 folder. This will reset the game settings to default and clear up any issues that might have come if that got corrupted. It usually fixes startup issues for me.
Also diplovassalize everyone you can
It is a very good school. People who take the football and drag other things into it like school ranking and demographics and shit like that are fucking idiots that don't deserve a soapbox. It says to me "I don't really know  anything about football I just like hearing them say 'Mine is the best!'" We can be friends and still hate each other.
Their point is a joke. Someone revoked with Kazan and posted it here recently. Think "0/10 France still exists"
Time to do a Japan run.
This made me laugh so goddamn hard it shifted the ear of corn stuffed up my ass.
As a solo player I feel it's completely worth it. Especially if you're a big fan of the show, creating a character and doing the storyline is lots of fun. I haven't found big frame rate issues for me outside of the main city.
No matter how much I try I cannot beat this one on my warlock(affliction). I'm at 930 and have alright legendaries for it, just can't get the boss down before he finishes the ritual and then that guy stomps me.
I really want to see him take it off too.
Maximum over-awesome!
This would be the best timeline if it weren't for other events in football that happened this year.
Other people above are saying it is called MeetMe. I personally had never seen it before.
Probably just as strong as he thinks though, so if that isn't a turn on, I can't judge for that.
I imagine for famous people it's probably the first person that hits all the buttons and seems trustworthy, and feels the same way back. They're people like all of us, so you see the ones who have more trouble seeing through that part on TMZ going through bad breakups and shit. I bet that first time she spoke to him she saw someone who looked into her eyes and enjoyed her company for exactly who she is and not who he aspires to be with. When you're that famous you can probably tell just by the look in people's eyes when you first meet.
Nobody cares. 
Tap your Rosy 2016 goggles together and say "make America great again" three times, and you'll be at the hearing!

>TIL EA actually wants to make money

>**COUNTERJERK** No one wants EA developers to starve because they cannot till the hard and barren ground of game consumers. People are mad because EA is being greedy beyond normal comprehension. P2W is trash. Purchase-incentivized progression is trash. Both are trash in a F2P game, and are mind-bogglingly trash in a full-priced retail game. On top of that steaming pile of shit, it has lootbox kiddie-gambling which means you can dump money and not necessarily get the thing that you want/need. And the entire game is designed to push people into paying into this trash system. This counterjerk goes so far that it's actually insulting.

I have yet to hear anyone on EA's side of this defend this part convincingly. This is absolutely "you have money? We will take all of it if you are dumb enough to give it to us." And we as consumers do not deserve it in our gaming culture. Is this(lootbox model), Art like classics from before it erupted onto every big new hit AAA game? 


That makes sense though, as people grow older they understand themselves better(usually). If they got married and had kids together they must be pretty good friends to have made it that far. I would have a lot of respect for them because they managed to save the good parts of their relationship while sacrificing the deal breaker parts and move on in both their lives.

Yeah I might just flag pvp now to bait people.
I haven't PvPed since BC, but when I started seeing "PvP Power" on gear I had to stop and wonder what they were thinking.
I would love to see some kind of city siege instanced battleground. Make one for each capital city. Let players rank up and deploy different and better AI siege troops and weapons, make it slightly moba-ish in that way so there's combat everywhere even if there aren't players around. Give both sides 'rallying cries' to work for or fall back on, so each new push feels like a stage in a big battle. As either side gets pushed to their corner, their fighting gets more concentrated and difficult to push- culminating in a huge commander or king style raid boss. Make it a huge map and a huge player limit so tons of players can come or go without making too big of a shift in balance.

...I think I just described AV in major cities and didn't know how much I really wanted that.
On my druid, which isn't a main so I'm not used to all the forms and their utilities, I stay resto for my WQ's. being able to heal myself mostly to full is just great and I can bring others up by just spot healing people as I pass by or attack a rare with them. Also, after you get to around 900 Ilvl you can kill most regular broken shore mobs with a sunfire and moonfire.
You are correct.

It's a projection, a gaslight. They called snowflake for years at legitimate issues the left has argued about, eliminating the legitimacy of the phrase. Now that they've shown themselves to be a caricature of their own 'feared liberal snowflake,' they're so mad we call them the same thing. It's a buffer so they don't have to look at their thoughts and actions in any sort of critical manner. They're children from birth to death and refuse to take responsibility for themselves.
They want to ban abortion because their parents wish they had?
Joe Burrow deserves better than what we're able to give him. He's good but is stuck in a mix of recruits when he was a really big fan :(
"Alright you finally figured out head coaching sucks so please come coach our defense again"
If your "uneducated nincompoops" do something, ANYTHING to better their own position themselves instead of blame their problems on "Mexicans and Niggers taking our jobs", then you would have half a point. Instead they try to kick hard working LEGAL immigrants out of the country so they can, ironically, steal the jobs that were supposedly stolen from them.

Here you go. I don't do much 3dprinting but the OP of this thread has good advice and a reliable printer found on treatstock so I did everything they said with the V3 version and it turned out perfect.
Yeah I have it saved somewhere I'll dig it up. 
Get him one of those 3d printed handheld mode grips and he'll marry you twice. I swear its worth more to me at this point than most of the games I've played with my gnarly man hands.
They need to revamp bowl season for that to work imo. We can't have bowl games in the second half of January. They need to fix that or end the charade of 'student athleticism'
I assume the correct answer to that confusing question is 'playing down'
I think we were worn the fuck out for that Iowa game. 
You have spectrum? I think they do that just to remind you who's boss.
Lol basketball. Let me know when a single non final four tourney game nets millions of dollars for a conference even if they lose.

Hi 2002! I'm 2007 and I have cable.
I accidentally kicked my bedframe today hard enough to bleed from my shin lol fuck I'm a mess on Saturday.
Love that preemptive flag though right?
Disgusted even.
I think it was announced last week as a "noon OR 330 game" depending on the rest of the schedule
Not even just us too. Targeting is a fucking half baked rule.
+1 for sure. I think targeting should not have the ejection, considering you get thrown out if you have another PF anyway. By targeting logic any PF should get you thrown out.
Targeting in its current form needs to have the ejection aspect removed until they can learn a better way to call it. You already get ejected for 2 PF anyway right?
Fuck I hate that. I thank the stars microcenter is within my city highway loop.
59-0 go
I'll put more than that into your mouth if you consent to it.
Interesting and definitely worth a look. Thanks!

Care to share?
Along this line, you can see a few moments(the SSBKK kick when Jiren grabs Goku's foot) where he is genuinely surprised at goku's power. Someone naturally that powerful shouldn't be that surprised by an exertion far below his or her maximum.
I've been thinking about jiren and how DB has let its storylines develop in the past. I think Jiren is getting help from Belmod somehow, and its either bending the rules or breaking them outright.  I think Goku(or Vegeta) is going to ring out Jiren and this is going to have a catastrophic ripple effect on the rest of the tournament. I don't think we're going to see the end of the tournament according to the rules and all bets are going to be off or some kind of mortals vs gods kind of insane craziness. Remember. If it looks cool, Zeno will allow it.
Of all things, our country should despise an autocratic monarchy the most

This is the best/safest answer on all of the internet right now. Most of the good streams here are even better than the official provider websites.
I got a free trial from the wc3 battle chest in 2007, that's how I got into the game.
Would this also make it just as easy to accelerate learning something the wrong way? I guess if you're not doing it right the body doesn't have a clue either way, right?
Yeah that whole thing was a mess. I'm not even going to try and recover it.
I feel the same way. I get it, but that's how every saiyan seems to handle their new transformations.
Argentina, where this video was taken does not submit to the authority of the FCC. Also you're thinking of the FAA.
I rarely comment here because of how hateful people are with their ideas. It is impossible to disagree most times and how dare you assume something in the show means anything other than what the 'experts' think. I don't think there's anything wrong with your comment, this sub is just really jaded with people's theories, but at the same time fetishizes them.
If there's one thing I learned in IT it's that your counterpart is just as vital as you and is a perfect excuse to relax when you have Nazi upper management. They are so blinded that they don't see "so and so's out so we are basically paralyzed." Not worrying about the service desk mailbox was one of the best things I ever did. "There are still unread emails from last Thursday..." Never fails.
I honestly disagree on Davis. The hire was criticized at the time and he isn't proving his worth. We pay our assistants shitloads and he makes 500k base salary for this year. Is this LB corps worth 500k? This talent is easily worth 250k and I don't know if he's made up the second half of that so far. It remains to be seen what we will get from the remaining season. If there isn't a significant improvement in discipline at the very least then I feel the experiment is a failure.
I feel this, though I've played for a long time and all my characters gradually sifted down into my bank guild. It's tough to break that habit of playing solo even when you really want to.
They're gonna have to rework so much stuff I bet they release a separate game client. Imagine how fucked up add-ons would be if you loaded your retail and classic toons in the same client. I think this project is probably two years off but I think they'll take a lot of the sting out of the vanilla process and leave the opportunity for fun.
This indeed. I'll finish some of my current leveling alts but no more unless there's an incentive
I don't see people up in arms, even on the elevenwarriors boards. Sure there are those 'argue-politics-on-facebook' types who don't have a rational thought about football in their heads, but I think we all have those. Most people seem mad over the coaching situation and for us, it usually leads to picking apart coaching hires like our new LB coach who seemed to be a questionable hire anyway.

I wouldn't call either of us in panic mode because after this week they should both move past playoff aspirations and devote themselves back to winning the rest of their games. That is, if either team has leaders(coach or player) that can step up to meet the adversity head on.
I enjoy playing Japan but have this problem where I try to play them like I do Portugal and end up way too spread out. What are your typical colonization targets as Japan?

All the response you're going to get is rt56. It's almost a meme here that if you're running RT56 and have bugs, it's that mod's fault because it is buggy as shit.
I think this might be a custom job. I'm generally pretty good at digging anything from the depths of google but I don't think there's anyone with this sweater advertised in their storefront. Do you know who this person is?
I think z is way too long to consume nowadays(at least as an adult) Kai is about 160 episodes and moves at a really good pace. Goku turns ssj at around episode 45, Gohan defeats cell around 99 Majin Vegeta around 125. The Japanese dub of Kai is really good where the English one lost some of my favorite actors from Z.

That's how it usually works for us, didn't you see Zeke tap heels in his 85yd run?
I don't trust our offense to adjust, but I bet our defense has this locked down by the end of the game.
We've never done tempo right in the entire time Meyer has been here. When you have less than 5 seconds on the play clock, you aren't tempo. This is every single play!
I think we'll come back but if we do win I think it's an upset. Our guys are undisciplined af

It's okay we don't need special teams, we just wanted the ball back so our vaunted offense is just gonna take over and *sobs*

It's funny how they want it okay to refuse black or gay people but then act like they're a protected class or a sexual orientation. Maybe fascism is some kind of power fetish after all.

This is what I want the next story arc to be, Vegeta just had a fucking kid too.
yeah but I'm kinda fat, not in the bear kind of way just like a dude who would otherwise be really fit if he didn't play so many video games.

Switzerland is very fun, one thing about it is you don't really have to avoid the coast completely, you can take sea provinces and then give them to vassals or clients to get the acievement. Easily the hardest part of that run for me was counting the landlocked provinces because tearing the sea ones off into vassals pretty much cripples you for a while and I didn't want to have to deal with that mess.

They mean the problem you're having is probably in your head more than anything. There aren't blueprints to friendships and it isnt always easy.

 I'm on the spectrum and personal relationships can be very hard for me to build because I just don't understand people most of the time. What I needed to figure out is that I was holding myself back because I had mental blocks preventing me from leaving my comfort zone and join someone else. To do this I needed to find the qualities in myself I liked the most(charity, teaching, silly inoffensive one liners) and get confident in them. I sought out opportunities to be there for the people I wanted to be around more, got joy from it, and also spread joy to their lives. 

Sometimes it means sacrifice, sometimes it means shutting up, lots of times we don't know what it means and fail, but that's why the world is beautiful, we can get better.

Maybe it's boring to you, and that's fair. I like it a lot, it gives me satisfaction to do it well and not mess up or let dots fall off, and make big numbers.
I don't have much to say about the other specs. I just have way more fun on affliction than any of my other specs or even characters at this point. I'll be sad when they shuffle up the specs for the next expansion. The last time I had so much fun was the move+cast talent from pandaria days, or in cata when my rogue had tons of leech and recuperate.

Go to any flea market you haven't been to in years, and the shops that used to sell beanie babies are now Funko Pop stores. Gullible masses have always existed and they will continue too. Merch companies have also gotten great at switching between artificial scarcity(limited production) and "rarity" with all the dumb blind hype for new releases.
I worked at Staples for a bit and they would do the gift card racket there too but they were Chinese, not Indian. It was totally legit, they would buy electronics with gift card specials, and clean out all the stock. They flipped the tablets and shit online and then used the cards to buy more tablets. I have to believe they made a profit on it.
I might start saying it out loud in public now.

Maybe they aren't sure what they don't like about it yet? Flavors can be complex and difficult to pick apart sometimes, food isn't necessarily the only thing this applies to. I liked all the new episodes but have shows that simply turned me off for reasons I didn't understand until I took a good look at how I felt about it. I don't think it's fair to criticize someone because they won't or can't articulate their opinion in a way that is palatable to you.

Don't take too much land at once, weaken your enemies and break their big alliances but keep the opportune small ones.

I'm curious if you know of any mods that adjust game balance a bit, I seem to always end up with a disaster in my games that are total annihilation level. I mean if every empire in the galaxy allied up and stacked together we still couldn't beat these fleets. I have to either cheat or turn off disasters to continue having any fun. I've looked around and maybe I'm just not using the right keywords or something.
I also have an amd card, R9 390. Game runs flawlessly on my system.
Have you seen the top gear episode where the gang goes through alabama in beaters with pro-liberal stuff all over their cars? Used to be funny, probably still is.

They don't care. It isn't about education or abortion to them. Keeping young people poor and desperate to survive keeps them from doing anything else, like learning or thinking.  A teen Mom isn't going to march for her or her child's rights.

I hope so. They've already set up our universe as being basically the most boring universe. There aren't even any good villains left in 7 that aren't dead or deities already, and the last few arcs have all featured antagonists from other universes. I think the super Dragonball wish combining universes is the only logical choice from the show runners' perspective, because it ensures the longevity of the show and breaks lots of established 'rules' in the series without consequences for the main cast.
So glad I was a healer in those runs, half of my guild didn't get one.
these were the zone invasions in the pre legion launch event, they aren't around anymore but you could start a dwarf, go to kharanos, farm the first two waves, and then log out in a inn. Log back in and the invasion was reset for you. I went from 1-100 on a toon in about a day doing this and then they nerfed it, but it was still good XP. You can level from invasions in Legion, but they're only on the broken isle.
This was just a one time run, probably a month or more before the expansion patch dropped. We were able to bruteforce most fights, but the mechanically tough ones were very difficult. I doubt most people did more than a cusory look at the mechanics and just followed the raid leaders' instructions. I think also by the time we got to KT, at least 15-20 people had dropped out because we'd been at it for hours.
I hate leveling so much I grinded out like 6 Toons to 100 in the legion prelaunch invasions. That old world lowbie stuff is just so old at this point to me.
I went in with my guild and other guilds during sunwell progression. We had 35-40 people and couldn't beat KT. Wiped on 4h easily 15 times.
Is this REAL tempo, or the ridiculous look we give every down where JT stares down the sideline for 30 seconds waiting for the calls? What we have been doing is not what say, Oregon was known for recently. Frequent delays and poor preparation at the line drives me insane.
>shitposting is a art

You had one job
In sunwell we had shadow priests only for their Mana Regen. We had them in the healer groups and they did all of about 1200 DPS, where tops on many fights were the warlocks and hunters at over 3500. These were the best geared priests on our server too.
Not the above user, but I found this thread scrolling all for highly upvoted porn. I don't have this game(some friends do though) but considering how shitty the studio is I probably never will.

Yeah I have no sympathy for how much people choose to ignore learning. You know how to plug in your toaster, but not check to see if a monitor is plugged in? You forgot your password and you even wrote it down? Oh no, that's too bad. But before I can even fix it you're hurling abuse at me? At this point in my career I consider it a privilege  making them wait longer to have their problem fixed.
I dunno, for the first time in a while my warlock feels OP just wandering around. I haven't raided other than LFR or openraid for years though.
if you press continue from the menu before the game ends, it somehow borks the save into not caring about the end date.

I really enjoyed watching a let's play of this game.
Can this Ruckert kid block? I watched the video and they say a lot about his catching skills but not a lot about how well he blocks. 
I got the head on my first alone in the dark kill. I was wasted so of course I gave all my gold away in celebration.
Other than the big player numbers it was janky as hell, came out right around modern warfare 2 and bad company 2, so anyone who really wanted a solid experience probably played one of those already. 
I did this but with my paladin in front of org. I would stay dead, flagged and wait for a duel to finish, res and one shot the loser. I was such a punk bitch back then lmao.

I agree with this. He was a very good player. I think most of his meme around here was the weird boner ESPN had for him.
Wow they didn't like one thing he did. That changes everything.
People bought the idea because ignorance is beginning to dominate this country and most people have no idea how the government actually works.
I watched some of his videos in 2009 or so, the pauses made him sound like a whiny bitch to me and I have never watched since.
My old copy of oblivion didn't have a serial. The first thing I did was rip it on another dvd and give it to my buddy at college in exchange for some ripped red vs blue seasons.
There were a few that didn't have the range, but making client states in ireland seemed to work it all out. Most HRE revoked vassals with a port were able to go just about anywhere in the new world, I had a dithmarschner oregon for example.
I usually end up doing it with vassals I feed along the way. You basically give them enough to get a 10 province CN, then annex them. It isn't really that useful because once you can do it you don't much need to. I played a game way past the end date to see if I could put a merchant in every node, here's the only screenshot I have that sort of illustrates how I went about doing it- [steam link](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/854971213074395359/7ABAF59AC469C1A20779AE24CA644146D4D8DB06/)

I thought evil Buu was reincarnated because Goku pulled some favors or asked the dragon for it?
Didn't partition the new world into 40 10 province colonies to maximize trade revenue/10
I thought so too, then I did the same thing from another computer at home(also 1920x1080) and the issue persisted. I wasn't bothered too much by it but my need to fix everything was a bit disappointed.
At one point I could do any other game through windows RDP at work, but wow has some odd mouse thing that always fucked it up for me. Like the camera moved 1000% faster than it should have, couldn't do anything but set missions and the mobile app made even that not necessary.

Re: food- if you're on a budget you can take food into the park. It is in the park rules that you can do it, too.
Krokodil strikes again
Also, you can take sea provinces. You just have to meet the criteria and give the coastal land to a vassal or client state and it will pop no problem for you.
Been ruining players for years
I'd like to poach FSU somehow. Pipe dream I know.
I mean at this point he's died twice, anything is possible.
Honestly most of the reason this doesn't happen is because the enemies of the state not knowing what our defensive capabilities are is just as much of a weapon as using it on them. Scammers are small fish on a national defense level.
Most people are missing this, the biggest point of all. Jiren can be the strongest but if he punches the old-timer barely hard enough and splatters him, he's out. Keeping weaker fighters on the team is a legit, albeit horrifying strategy.
I understand the reactionary opposition to the sjw movement, and think it is necessary in ways to moderate it. That said, anyone who seriously tries to push an argument without knowing at least some of the historical complexities of what they're trying to say, even a cursory look at a fucking Wikipedia summary, they are the worst voices on both sides.

The mods in this subreddit make it not worth being subbed anymore.
After the last few years it isn't difficult to keep expectations low. I'm just happy to see the basketball squad in the news again to be honest. We're spoiled with football and these guys deserve some love too.
I got my Jetta's tires replaced at Sam's and they stole my key. I had to pay a dealership like 12 bucks to have the lock nuts removed and replaced with normal ones.
