Wait, who was in the wrong here?  It depends on if the guy maintaining the right lane was speeding up to force the guy off.  We need to use triathlon rules, if you someone pulls in front of you, you have to back off and let them pass.  
For leisure activities I basically go to parks and non-car zones.  Agreed that life isn't worth just staying inside all the time.  

I would be surprised if pedestrians would have some risks because at least they can see danger coming at them (e.g. against traffic).  

My problem is the disconnect between how much people care about not hitting bikers and how much bikers care about not being hit. 
I think the car-bike dynamic is a lost cause.  You can't fix stupid.  No amount of policing etc. will fix that.  

I'm riding indoors (e.g. Zwift) until we get full car AI autonomy.
Tl;dr: biking is safer than cancer or heart disease, so actually pretty safe! 
It's not an investigation, it's a matter.

Too late for Google bro, should have done that before submitting.  I hope you got the 2018 Patriots Super Bowl commemorative championship jersey to wear to your national security briefings on Syria.

Edit: Alright, I'll stop making fun of you. I'll let you have the last word, go for it. 
Lol...but I was referencing when the Patriots won in 2002...honest.  Dude just take the L.  Thanks for the laughs. It's better when you wet the bed to own up to it, not try to be defensive. 
> Ah it’s simple, I joined the patriots the day of the Super Bowl, mid game. I played one pass, patriots won, I lead them to victory throughout the entire season, and then the super bowl.  /u/farlack 

You must have missed that the Patriots didn't win the Super Bowl, that would be the Eagles.  Ouch. Probably want that one back.

Wouldn't go around claiming that you've got your finger on the pulse of current events and then go around claiming that the Patriots beat the Eagles.

How much did the Patriots beat them by in your universe?

Who won the NCAA tournament? Michigan? 
I watch ESPN everyday, I don't know why I'm not in the NBA yet. How did you do it? 
Hillary said that if Trump got elected then ISIS would be able to thrive.  So you'll have to look into her reasoning. 
That's not what makes someone objective. What makes someone objective is having a legit judgment criteria and sticking to it.

The left pretends not to care about merit based immigration even though 90% of people are actually for it.  They disparage the president because they have no honor and make up random Russian conspiracies because they wet the bed in 2016 election.  

Being objective is acknowledging that problems like the deficit are legitimate criticisms of the president while stuff like Russia, Twitter, porn stars is there to appeal to the most ignorant among us.

Here you have actual statements by actual leaders (China, North Korea) and the left is to blind to see reality. 
It doesn't matter, I just think it's odd that the 2 most powerful people in the US disagree with you but you think you've got a better foreign policy resume. Pretty bold. Or naive.

How do you reconcile that with any of the campaigning done by HRC who was heralded as an international expert?

Either HRC was wrong, or you're wrong.  Which one? Why would HRC make ISIS her #1 foreign policy objective if they were "on the run."  
Is this your favorite victory speech over ISIS by HRC?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIxrEGW-hlA

Isis is metastasizing = collapsing apparently

When Trump is candidate: ISIS wants Trump to win and they will destroy us

When Trump is president: ISIS is already gone, why is Trump talking about ISIS

Logic is legit
Yep, like the guy looking in the mirror and saying "look at this guy, what an idiot"
This is why Liberals have lower IQ's than Conservatives.  We need mandatory education programs for people like /u/silentsandwich who post these kinds of arguments.

Maybe when we start merit based immigration we can eventually weed these kinds of retards out of the American gene pool.
Yea, there was no way ISIS was a campaign issue because it was already solved.  Maybe it was Hillary Clinton's #1 terrorism threat...

https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/combating-terrorism/

#1: Take out ISIS’s stronghold in Iraq and Syria

But /u/farlack thinks the battle was already won ("steamrolled in every direction"), so let's go home, HRC doesn't know what's she's talking about. 

Liberals don't even read their own candidates talking points.  Zero intelligence, all they care about is feelings.  Not the economy, not immigration, not trade.  Feelings and more feelings.

There is a reason Conservatives have a higher IQ than Liberals.
> He could shut up. That'd be a win.

Nice well thought out argument.  Guy gets China to agree to opening up more trade agreements, NK to denuclearize.  And the left is crying like a 13 yo girl because he's not being nice on social media.  
Guy defeats ISIS, pumps up markets, opens up trade with China, and bangs porn stars. And Mr. Issue Voter here would rather have a politician with good Twitter manners.  Sounds like you have your priorities straight. 
Even if the USA was a laughing stock, it wouldn't matter because we'd be up 20% in value over the past year like everything else.

If only people would have honked more, this could have been avoided.  
Agreed. The altruism is very click-baity if not asked about correctly.  

* Would a conservative viewpoint of self-determination (e.g. you choose your own destiny, in exchange for higher risk you can achieve higher rewards) be altruistic (because of the higher potential rewards) or not altruistic (because of the higher risk+penalties)?
* Would a liberal viewpoint of higher taxation in order to provide a more robust safety net be considered altruistic (because of the safety net) or not altruistic (because of the high taxation)?

I think "altruistic" was the wrong word choice here, this diminishes the quality of the study and the perceived integrity of the authors.

Why does this matter? It's a gun free zone so it's impossible for a gun to exist in that environment. 
Yea, it kind of sucks because debates about what actually matters to the country: immigration policies, minimum wage, universal basic income, universal health care are actually really interesting.  Framing them with identity politics makes the argument more accessible and attractive to people (its main draw), but it destroys the potential of the argument itself.

I really only talk about politics now on the NeutralPolitics subreddit because it's heavily modded, basically source your arguments or GTFO.  Troll posts barely see the light of day so it's not even worth it to troll there.  I love it. 
> I'm sorry, weren't you the one trying to call out one side while ignoring the other side existed during Obama's two terms?

No, not calling out one side.  It's a political strategy, not an evil plot by the Devil.  Strategies can be used by both sides.  Lack of intelligence is shared by the political spectrum.  Identity politics is the disease that manifests in the petri dish of stupidity, _because it works_.
If you have a multiple businesses in a portfolio, I don't see looking at individual bankruptcies as an appropriate metric (due to sample size problems) to determine business acumen of the person in charge of the portfolio.  Wouldn't net worth across those portfolios be the best metric?

If the argument is that he is a socially irresponsible or unethical businessman, then we should consider that separately from the $ argument.

Most of the concern trolling you'll see is on a few day delay from left leaning media. The average person doesn't have a real clue and thinks they're an enlightened individual if they can accurately rehash/replicate what they hear on the news.  

Couple that with the tried and true defense of identity politics and thought manipulators can tell you what you should think and why you should think that passionately. Regardless if it actually matters or if it's true. 

You'll see a lot more of these fanciful Trump is bad for the economy trolling narratives as we lead up to 2018 midterms.  Democrats need to have a strategy to win the economic values voter, and most voters are unfortunately swayed with emotional but otherwise groundless arguments.  If you read about different political strategies, the Democratic party fully embraced a get out the base over convince independents strategy.  For the former you base your platform on identity politics, for the latter you try to have appealing arguments.  We see the fruits of that identity politics every day now. 


Yes, that's what I was saying. 
This is an interesting article: https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/the-right-to-refuse-service-can-a-business-refuse-service-to-someone-because-of-appearance

> If there’s an anti-discrimination law, does that mean that a business can never refuse service to a member of a group that is protected from discrimination?

> The answer is that you can refuse to serve someone even if they’re in a protected group [race, color, religion, national origin...maybe age], but the refusal can’t be arbitrary and you can’t apply it to just one group of people.

The point of this article was that businesses can create policies that permit them to not serve anyone but it can't be based on any of the protected classes.  So they could refuse to sell firearms to people who aren't wearing blue shirts, because blue shirts aren't a protected class. But they couldn't refuse to sell firearms based on age because that is a disallowed group.  I wonder if this was their plan all along.  Virtue signal that they wanted to stop selling to 18-20, get shut down in the courts, and then say: "We tried, I guess we'll have to make more money selling to everyone now."
I would be careful about chalking this up to hip flexors. Would also consider a stress fracture. If you're not able to reasonably stretch out the discomfort, then it may be a stress fracture.

It's going to be tough to diagnose for sure without an MRI and pretty legit clinical interrogation of hip flexor pain versus stress fracture.

Agreed.  My understanding was the Austin is pretty landlocked and so traffic will only get worse.  It looks like SA has a couple big interstate projects that will hopefully do something about the traffic inferno that is 1604 and I-10.  Get rid of that and a lot more room for growth.
I don't know. I've been doing research on the investment potential for $300k price point homes and they've been big money losses for investor owned properties.  

Put that up against new tax disadvantages, tax advantages for non real estate companies which increases your opportunity cost, and the potential for rising interest rates. 

I'm not sure where your optimism is coming from, but I want what you're drinking. 

You wouldn't happen to know how many homes here are investor owned, that would make a big difference. If it's pretty low I'd be more in your camp. 



Anyone got a source for this?
I'm not sure where Vanessa's chart puts politifact on the bias spectrum, but here is a source from politifact that goes back to 2000.  The argument you made is that discussions are "impossible" because the "lack of good unbiased data." Do you see the same kind of cherry picking in this source?  Do you think that politifact was also "cherry picking."

> The data shows that it clearly happens in other countries, and in at least three of them, there’s evidence that the rate of killings in mass-shooting events occurred at a higher per-capita rate than in the United States between 2000 and 2014. 

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-correct-mass-killings-dont-happen-oth/
Would be happy to look at another source.  What data are you looking at that refutes that study?

Also, Drudge is a link aggregator, not a news site (source: drudgereport.com) as you contend. 
> Unfortunately, Other countries without these mass shootings have the same media as we do, the same mental illnesses as we do.

Just adding some facts/context to this statement.

Have you ever found one? 
It should settle down now that there aren't tax incentives to own a home. Your mortgage and property taxes aren't tax deductible anymore in the vast majority of cases which make owning versus renting a pretty neutral decision now. 

More selling is going on as people are trying to get out of real estate investments when they start doing the math.  Just be patient. 
I think you have 1 legit security officer, armed, and then a few concealed and trained teachers who receive additional training to serve as backup to the security officer.


This comment is genius
My guess would be a personal hatred.

The only thing Putin wanted more than destabilization was preservation of his power and continued Russian existence.  I would lump that in with a personal hatred motive. 

http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/07/the-kremlin-really-believes-that-hillary-clinton-will-start-a-war-with-russia-donald-trump-vladimir-putin/

Agreed, replaced pro Clinton with anti Trump as it pertains to after election. Thanks for correction. 
This has been addressed in my top level comment. Please include arguments or sources if you're making a claim, otherwise this entire chain will get deleted by the mods. 
Both

+meddling
-collusion

Are you agreeing to the definitions?  I didn't see a source or argument refuting. 

Is your argument also refuting the Rosenstein quotes?  I didn't see a source or argument refuting.
My claim was that there was no evidence of collusion in the op source.  

This is the definition of collusion per Google: "secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy, especially in order to cheat or deceive others."  Do we agree on the definition? 

You reference claims of DNC hacking and obstruction.  However, this is off topic as it pertains to collusion. In terms of definitions, collusion is different from money laundering, lying to the fbi, and obstruction.  If you'd like to discuss DNC hacking and/or obstruction I believe there already are threads for that.  The OP source article and my original comment pertain to collusion because it is what I believe the main new finding is from the document. 

> That brings us back to "unwitting." Not only did the indictment clearly say that no one in the Trump campaign was wittingly or knowingly involved with the Russians, it explains how the Russians used fake names and groups to hide their real identities. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein gave a press conference and drove home that point, stating that there was no evidence of any knowing involvement by the Trump campaign, as well as no evidence that this effort impacted the election. Indeed, Rosenstein stated that there is "no allegation in this indictment that any American had any knowledge" of the Russian effort.

http://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/374312-mueller-indictments-still-miss-the-mark-on-trump-russia-collusion

If you want to say that we don't have 100% proof of no collusion, I think that would be fair. However, how meaningful that sort of standard is, is debatable. 

Using the probability argument above, I would interpret the statement as collusion is unlikely given proven meddling, motive, and post election never Trumping. Perhaps we should decide on what level of proof is required to adjudicate yes/no collusion. 

At this point based on the op source and the interpretation by the cnbc article I provided, if your argument is that colluding is likely then you have to believe that meddling was occurring alongside collision. Specifically, that a great opportunity for collusion (the meddling mentioned in the indictment) did not happen by either oversight or by design. Additionally the motives  documented in the op source of creating disarray in the election system would not be served by a united front via Trump collusion.

I would be interested in hearing the argument or sources that these indictments support the existence of collusion.  


See my comment about probability. Your use of "categorical" implies 100% threshold, that's not possible with disproving a negative.

What is your source or argument for the use of the categorical threshold versus probability threshold?
That's one part of it. As the article I referenced above states, we now have a plausible motive and evidence to support that motive for Russian actions. In the article and in the indictment referenced by op, there is specific language ("unwitting", "no American") which would refute the collusion narrative and lists multiple examples of the meddling paradigm. As more and more evidence as referenced in the op source and the cnbc article, the collusion narrative seems unlikely and the meddling narrative is likely, bordering on already established.

Since we're in the https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance territory of disproving a negative, we have to make a reasonable assumption on probability of likelihood. The lack of proof is not lack of innocence. 

I fail to see how this indictment increases the probability of collusion. What would be the source behind that sort of argument? 
Source is at bottom of my post
The takeaways are these :

* Russia had a primary objective of meddling in the election, both before and after. 
* Russia had a secondary objective of bias towards Trump and Bernie Sanders.
* Russia played both sides : anti - Trump and pro - Trump  (sometimes organizing rallies against and for Trump, ON THE SAME DAY) in order to sow chaos.
* No collusion by Trump or the Trump campaign.

Edit : removed pro Clinton and replaced with anti Trump 
This is a fine detail but conservatives hired Fusion GPS for op research. Once the DNC was involved Steele came on board through Fusion GPS. So when we talk about Fusion GPS then it's Republican to Democrat (maybe you could say Fusion dossier?). When we talk about the Steele dossier then that's DNC.  Most of the excitement and allegations seemed to have involved Steele as it pertains to Russia.

Plenty of people use headlights to be seen, in some places it's the law to increase your visibility.

I think I have to give props to cyclists after seeing these noise arguments. They are the least protected on the road, and the most silent.  


Like driving with your bright headlights on? I'm doing it to make sure you see me.... 

Bogus argument because the 100% of the time under muffled bikes make excessive noise vastly outweighs the 0.1% of time that noise is necessary.  And there is already an invention for that, when you need to be loud to let someone know you're there.. a horn.  
I think there are mitigating factors for why people do that. But I don't have sympathy for people who make a moral  conscious decision to enter into a zero sum game to enjoy themselves at the direct detriment and expense of others.

The same reason I don't fart in an elevator. Just because it reduces my discomfort and I have the right to do it, doesn't make it a moral decision. 


Agreed.  That's why I like my idea about putting guilty offenders into a temporary read only (no posting/commenting) penalty box.  Part (or all) of the pleasure of being a troll is exposure, reduce the exposure and you kill the trolls.  

For Counterstrike, ESEA (the anti-cheat) would give you a 1 min penalty for 1st violation, 1 hr violation for 2nd violation, 1 day violation for 3rd, etc.  Having some sort of graded penalty for confirmed trolling would suffocate the trolls.  Why can't we do that?  I feel like 50% of my time on here is spent arguing with trolls where I'm in the position of say nothing (and act like I conceded their point) or feed the troll and waste my time.  You can't win in that framework and it just clutters the comment section.  If we both had something to actually lose (a cooldown penalty)     then we might be more honest.   
I think people would behave themselves more if the time between report and removal was either more transparent or consistent.  I have a vague idea of it being somewhere around an hour or two.  If the time between report and deleted is decreased for something that is deserved, then I feel less obliged to feed the troll.

Maybe if we restrict the number of topics per day so that we can have 1 or 2 good heavily modded discussions.  **We could even do it Hunger Games style: put up 3+ approved posts on Monday that are locked.  Pick the 2 with the most upvotes and we discuss those on Tuesday, the other ones are perma-locked.** It's similar to how AMAs are done across reddit and it would help solve the problem of post quality control and give people a stake into what they're discussing. The OP for the perma-locked posts can come back with a better argument or better sourced argument that is more appealing to the sub.   


Being a conservative, I haven't felt any censorship from posts or comments.  If anything I'm surprised I'm not penalized more.  Maybe because the mods think my arguments are so good ( :D ).

Even when on one of the last posts when I couldn't post a Youtube link that provided video evidence for a claim I was making about a video, the rules have helped me 100x more than they have inconvenienced/censored me.  
Suggestions:

* Keep the moderation approval for posts required before being publicly visible to the subreddit.  This keeps out trolling.
* Require a more accessible and organized format for posts.  I know I'm guilty of this sometimes, but it can be easy to bury a controversial opinion between two facts, cite a source to prove the 2 facts, and then the controversial opinion can get swept in under the rug.  For example, to fix it, we could do something like this:

Post: NP Mods need to take more of /u/soco suggestions

* [mild moderation] Context: The NP sub has seen an increasing amount of troll posts.
* [moderate moderation] Main Claim: On 9/10/2017 a post entitled "XXXXXX" used specific language and sources intended to mislead fellow redditors.
* [heavy moderation] Sub-claim 1  (Source 1): XXXXXXXXXXXX
* [heavy moderation] Pattern of intentionally using poor-sources (Source 2): The post used a collection of sources which was not in good faith (TMZ, RT, etc)

Where we get into trouble is when it's not easy to see what claims are based on which sources or to tell when someone is providing an opinionated context/background to an actual claim.

This would make it easier to mod the comments because sometimes we are discussing the context behind a post (where moderation does not need to be as heavy) versus specific claims.     

It would organize/structure more like a Lincoln-Douglas debate, which is the gold-standard for debating: http://debateclash.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Flow5.jpg 

Question: Is there a way to temp-ban someone from posting for like 24 hours if they have a post warning+violation that is not corrected? I imagine most of the mod work comes from curating flame-wars between 2 redditors that get into a argument death spiral.  Having a public NP penalty box (side-bar?) would keep the incentive of aligning to the rules that much more in your face, and provide some public humiliation (and justice for the OP) for the people who abuse the system.

It's an interesting point but if your metric is safety, then credit default swaps not interest rates are the best metric to judge risk. Germany is only slightly higher risk than the US, to be fair though. I think the problem is there are a multitude of central bank factors that go into interest rate levels whereas credit default swaps are a more pure estimate of sovereign debt risk.

Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, and Japan for example have negative interest rates, but only Sweden has lower cds prices than the US.

Provided transcripts to video portions in question and source article for the 93% negative - 7% positive bias/tone study
Source added at the bottom
I wasn't claiming that CNN didn't cover the post-election day market surge.  My specific claim (with references above) was that the narrative on election night from left-leaning pundits was that markets were tanking, i.e. "biggest loss after 9/11," "markets not enjoying."  Then I used the presence/absence of the stock ticker as a fun surrogate/example of when in time that Democrat narrative no longer made sense.

I looked at your article, my takeaway was the claim your prior comment was making was that left-leaning news agencies had more sources than right-leaning news agencies; therefore, bias is unlikely or mitigated because it's the left leaning tone is sourced.  Is that correct?  I'm not sure what that means unless we know the quality of those sources.  

So we're left with answering the fundamental question: "He may have had negative coverage, but did he deserve it?"

We have reasonable data on his performance relating to the top things Americans care about, the top 2: Economy, Terrorism (http://www.people-press.org/2016/07/07/4-top-voting-issues-in-2016-election/).  I use that as the gold standard to judge if coverage is biased or not.  What I ask myself is: does Trump's performance on the economy or terrorism justify 93% negative bias/tone in media coverage.  If the answer is yes, then one would assert that the media is covering him accurately.  If the answer is no, then one could assert that there is some kind of disconnect between performance and coverage tone/bias.

  
That's a great question, check the breakdown below of who holds US debt.  I completely agree with you about the US being the safest place to put money, and so we have the luxury of borrowing money for cheap interest prices.  If the Federal Reserve taps out and we increase the amount we borrow, then presumably rates have to rise.  I have no idea how much, but for the reasons you cited, I don't think it'll make a huge difference in interest rates.  Also presumably, as the interest cost to the overall federal budget gets larger as interest rates rise, then the call for limiting federal spending increases will become more urgent; there should be an element of self-correction for our deficit spending. (Disclosure, I'm for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, except in declared war).

Here's the breakdown of non-government holders (approx 70% of total debt) of public debt as of December 2016:

* Foreign - $6.004 trillion
* **Federal Reserve - $2.465 trillion**
* Mutual funds - $1.671 trillion
* State and local government, including their pension funds - $905 billion
* Private pension funds - $553 billion
* Banks - $663 billion
* Insurance companies - $347 billion
* U.S. savings bonds - $166 billion
* Other (individuals, government-sponsored enterprises, brokers and dealers, bank personal trusts and estates, corporate and non-corporate businesses, and other investors) - $1.662 trillion. 

Source for breakdown: https://www.thebalance.com/who-owns-the-u-s-national-debt-3306124
> That's a cute conspiracy story with the stock tickers but I am extremely doubtful of that. So back up your claim: Which stations, if any actually did this? Did anyone actually say that that was what it was meant to show? Did the stock market ticker not show up after other presidential election? News stations kind of have their tickets randomly show up and go away. I get it fits the beliefs of many that Trump is persecuted by the media but even by that standard that narrative is stretching it.  /u/Shaky_Balance

Here you go, was pretty fun, I need to save this post; had never full parsed it out before.  FYI this was for CNN.  CNN may (or may not be) the best example.  I chose CNN because Harvard's Kennedy School of Government showed that it had 93% negative - 7% positive bias/tone (13X negative bias/tone against Trump, source: https://shorensteincenter.org/news-coverage-donald-trumps-first-100-days/).  It would be interesting to repeat this with other less biased outlets.

I was referring to it as Trump's bull market because the context of the OP was to discuss it in terms of presidents ("How Does The Recent Stock Market Drop Compare To Market Activity Under Past Presidencies?").  If you want to use dates that's fine with me.

If you look at my original comment I provide a link to the interactive content at CNBC which shows that is a continuation of Obama's bull market that began after the 2009 recession.  In fact Obama and Truman are the biggest winners of the 1-yr performance time frame.    
I'm familiar with the stock market anti-Trump selloff theory but to artificially tank the markets 3 years before re-election and 9 months before midterms don't make a lot of sense to me because it would require a large amount of money that would be overpowered by other people with larger amounts of money.  It would make more sense to crash it a few days before voting day; I don't put a lot of stock into that specific argument (pun intended).

The viewpoint I'm taking is that this was a normal volatile trading day with profit taking which was significantly compounded by mathematical/electronic trading to keep portfolio's overall risk models in-line.  You can read about that theory in the link below or the quote here: 

> We've talked with technical experts who believe much of yesterday's move was "forced selling," dictated by electronic risk management models; it was not about inflation fears or the Fed, which were factors last Friday. The panicky selling yesterday sent S&P bid/offer spreads as wide as $50 (typically they are $1 or less), and there were times when prices simply weren't quoted, a phenomenon not seen since the "Flash Crash" on May 6, 2010.

My QE comment here about overall long-term US economy risk: https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7vkjhz/how_has_trumps_presidency_affected_the_stock/dttnxwy/

  


Parlaying into the QE argument, the negatives going against the US economy right now are debt and low inflation related to QE.  Presumably, since the Fed has recently stopped buying US debt, we'll have to find a home for the 1 trillion of debt we're supposed to issue this year. (http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-spending-debt-analysis-20180203-story.html).  

 
On election night, it was forecasted that a Trump presidency would cause markets to crash. Most major news stations had stock futures tickers on their screen.

However after the stock market started rallying, pricing in tax cuts, deregulation, and improved global growth we've seen one of the biggest bull runs in history.  (trivia point : after the market started rallying on election night, news agencies took off the stock tickers from their screen). Different agencies are predicting different end points for the bull market. 

I think what was remarkable about the Trump bull market was that it didn't come after deep recessions, so stocks weren't artificially cheap when he came into office.  In other first year terms, the numbers look great but were ~~indicated~~ initiated by relatively large recessions that had taken place immediately before they took office.

I agree with Gowdy.  My full explanation is in another comment in this thread but basically I wouldn't use the term fabricated, I would use conscious or subconscious ignorance. To reiterate, I doubt the officials in question did anything illegal. 

Basically there was a chance that the dossier was true, what we are arguing about is how true should we have put those odds? Since the FBI put the odds of that as high we have to ask was that faith misplaced? The FISA Nunes memo gets at the core of whether the normal discretion we expect of career intelligence and justice officials was tainted by political objectives.

The Democrats and the HRC campaign thought this was a blood in the water opportunity to take down Trump before and after he was elected, using the collusion argument.  What the Democrats thought was collusion was just Russian bait as part of a multifaceted campaign on both sides to sow chaos.

My comment about Democrats weaponizing is regarding the Democrats making themselves an unwitting vehicle for Russian meddling because it served Democrat interests at the time (winning the election, embarrassing Trump).

At the end of the day, Putin won, America got played, and the sooner we stop this fantasy about collusion or Democrat's spy/Obamagate intelligence scandal the sooner we can move on.

We all got fooled.

Here are 6:

https://www.vox.com/2018/1/5/16845704/steele-dossier-russia-trump

Are you asking for proof that Russia was meddling in US elections or that the dossier is 100% true?

The FISA memo documents that the dossier is not completely verifiable and as such was not suitable as a sole basis for a FISA warrant. The Russian meddling is documented by multiple intelligence agencies.

I'm not sure which proof you are asking for. I'll be happy to provide if you tell me which point you would like cleared up. 
It's interesting you didn't mention the second half of your source which references the main claims about collision which are not proven. It's also interesting that none of the items which you state the Newsweek article refutes are mentioned in my source and aren't my contentions. For example, it's not my position that Trump doesn't have relationships with people from Azerbaijan.  Is there a reason you think this refutes?

My argument was never about who was "in control." I don't see what point you're referencing there. My point is that Russia tried multiple pathways to create disarray into the American electoral system.  One of the many bait traps was information fed to Steele to make it feel amongst the Democrats that Trump was cheating (i.e. collusion). Instead of recognizing it and moving to address the problem which is Russian meddling, Democrats have used it as an excuse for losing the election (read Shattered which details how HRC, immediately after election night wanted to focus on blaming Russia to defuse personal responsibility for the loss).

To be fair, I doubt that anyone did anything illegal here on either side relating to collusion or FISA impropriety. But the 2015-2016 intelligence leadership allowed its disdain for Trump to permit itself to get tricked by the dossier.  Being duped is not illegal, but at least admit that you were duped. 

The main lesson to learn here is simple but poignant : if it's too good to be true, it probably is... 
That article confirms my own, did you mean to link that one?  

What's your response to Russia using the dossier to further its political aims?  You wanted an explanation and received it, but haven't countered it yet.  
I addressed this already in the link above.

You didn't make a statement, you restated my own statement. That's why I was asking what your point was.  If you're saying you didn't offer a position then my own argument speaks for itself. 
If you're calling for an investigation into the FISA warrants, I think we are in agreement.

You are making the argument that inadequate evidence is bad evidence because it's not all the evidence. That's a logical fallacy. 
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-25/anti-trump-fbi-agents-missing-texts-found-by-inspector-general


> One exchange frequently cited included remarks “that there’s no way” Trump would win the election but “we can’t take that risk.” Page departed Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team investigating Russian meddling in July, and Mueller removed Strzok after learning of the texts.

> Your comment: The FBI, AG, and the FISC are all professionals who know how to view information objectively and put their personal opinions aside.  To suggest otherwise is a slap in their face.  It's  the same stupid logic Trump used when he accused Judge Curiel of bias simply because he has a Spanish last name.  

It seems you're disagreeing with Mueller here because you're saying Strozk should have been able to maintain impartiality even with the released text messages since you assert ALL are impartial.  Based on that, do you think Mueller made a poor judgment decision on Page's ability to be impartial or do you think that your statement should be conditioned? You seem to be using lots of passionate words "crap" "insane" referring to my argument. That same kind of misplaced and unbridled passion is part of what obfuscated normal decision making at our places of power and allowed Russia to deligitimize our democracy. 
What is your reference for claiming this is not the best perspective we have for the investigation in its entirety as it relates to the FISA warrant.

What is the alternative you are proposing? 

What are the omissions or inconsistencies?  Would not and should not any confidential memo have material omissions to protect sources and methods? 
The memo is a summary of the process, the best insight we currently have into the entirety of the process.

Having discussions about individual components of the process is reductionist without an appropriate acknowledgement of its place in context. 
I'm not sure what point you're making here. The point from "team Trump" is that an application for probable cause for FISA warrants should be adjudicated at some point by an impartial party. If layer upon layer of fact checking failed at the level of the courts, the FBI, the DOJ, don't you think that is worth speaking out over? If your overarching value is national security, then it may be okay to trample on due process rights (i.e. get it wrong) but you should hold yourself accountable after it's said and done. In this case Democrats aren't even apologizing for wasting everyone's time and allowing Russia to impart illegitimacy on our election process, they're doubling down now. 

It's ironic that Russia's goal was to cast illegitimacy on Western democracy and the Democrats weaponized it for them.

In a nuclear explosion you have fallout which is radioactive sediment or debris.  If it touches you or you eat or breathe it, it can do damage. You also have radiation itself from the explosion and from fallout around you which will damage dividing cells in your body; they either die, repair themselves, or cause cancer. If you have a piece of meat in your fridge that is exposed to radiation, because it's dead, it isn't affected by the radiation in a way that would affect someone eating it.  On the other hand if you have a piece of dead meat that is sitting outside and fallout drops on it, then it's contaminated, but it's the fallout that's dangerous not the meat. 
Hypothetical: With the new tax plan with $24k standard deduction for a married person, a $200k house with a mortgage you're looking at $8000 in mortgage interest, $3000-4000 in property tax per year (total $11,000-$12,000/year in leveraging costs). None of that is tax deductible because it doesn't reach the standard deduction amount.  For a comparable house you're looking at renting for $1000 / month ($12,000/year).

Just in the interest costs and property tax costs you're trading a significant down payment ($40k) and other sunk costs for the opportunity to leverage.  Doesn't make any sense from an investment standpoint when there are better opportunities to leverage (as OP pointed out).  

The only way I can make home ownership make sense is either: you have significant other deductions (e.g. high health costs, high charitable giving) which push you above the $24k mark, or you derive "emotional" value from owning a home.

It doesn't trickle down? 
It is explained here: 

https://budget.house.gov/budgets/fy18/

* The argument with respect to tax reform is that the CBO is undershooting GDP growth estimates and estimates for positive impacts on labor participation rates.  Small differences in these estimates can make the difference between the policy being budget neutral versus creating deficits (with respect to taxes).
* As for how it more generally fits into the "how to pay for it" question: Entitlement spending cuts/reforms are slated for next year.  That coupled with increased economic productivity is how the following graphs are created and overall government deficits are decreased and eliminated by 2027: https://budget.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Chart-deck-for-FY18-budget.pdf

* troll your Republican friends who don't know anything about how bad the Kansas tax policy was structured and how the current federal tax reform policy is structured
* make fun of Kansas

This doesn't belong in an Economics sub, it belongs in a politics sub.
Agreed. I haven't seen a lot of cited case law in analysis regarding this which is why it seemed useful. Unfortunately I don't think Trump will take this to the courts.  Either he thinks he would lose or that it would create negative publicity.  Since Mueller already has the emails there's nothing for him to gain. The only hope would be if someone that has already been indicted might challenge it.   I'm not sure if that can nullify a plea bargain. 

http://www.cnn.com/2017/12/18/politics/johnson-gowdy-mueller-email-dispute/index.html
I just read this but he uses similar language and reasoning as me, and his sources are better cited.

https://lawandcrime.com/legal-analysis/legal-analysis-heres-why-muellers-seizure-of-transition-emails-likely-violated-the-law/

My opinion is that the GSA didn't act reasonably in producing the memos.  First, they didn't provide them under subpoena or compulsory method that we know of so far.  Based on the statement of Mueller, the GSA was asked and the emails were delivered. 

Because there was no grand jury subpoena, it will be hard for the GSA and therefore Mueller to argue that notifying the transition team would have been unreasonable.  This lack of notification prevented the transition team from pursuing normal legal channels to protect privileged communications or their communications altogether. 

Where I center my argument is that the GSA + transition team is a special contractual relationship with special status afforded by agencies and regulations.  The disclosure of the emails in this case would be permitted in employer - employee relationships, and private commercial email systems (based on legal precedent).  The reasonable expectation of the transition team would be that the right to audit these emails was limited to their role in maintaining the security and integrity of the system, it doesn't extend to actual ownership of the emails.   

Regardless of what's in the emails, I hope we get to see a real legal opinion on the case.  It's an interesting legal situation. 

I think the assumption here is that Mueller asked the GSA for them (without subpoena) and they were given on a flash drive.  GSA would be the "owner" in this context.  What's at issue is if the GSA is the owner versus a custodian. 
Yes I agree there is a difference between public and gov.  But the main conduit for government to achieve those aims: subpoena power, was not used.  It comes down to a threshold or balance test.  Without the use of subpoena and taint teams, I think it will be hard to prove that Mueller tried to balance a reasonable expectation of privacy.  
Yea, I read that one.  I think where his argument breaks down is that he's trying to draw an analogy: GSA is like Google, Trump is like a Gmail user.  

It's not the appropriate analogy because transition teams enjoy protected status (can't FOIA, aren't federal agencies, are separate from the GSA).  Add in that Mueller didn't get a subpoena, it'll be an interesting court case but I think he just tanked the entire investigation.  
I think we're getting to the point of contention: why do you think that staying past 9 forfeits your 
rights?  Why is it obviously unenforceable?  It's because you cannot write a contract or agreement that directly conflicts with current law.  I guess you can write a contract, but it won't hold up.  It's interesting that you state the GSA cannot publicly disseminate these documents.  If they own the emails why can they not?  Why can't the NYTimes just FOIA these emails?  I think if you answer that question, you'll have the larger answer.

We have to employ a balancing test: the right to privacy versus the advisement that the emails could be audited.

What you're arguing is that the generic GSA advisement that there is a right to audit outweighs the right to privacy.  I think that is overly simplistic.

Points for right to privacy:

* no subpoena used
* precedent with other transition teams
* Presidential Transition Act of 1963
* advisement from the National Archives
* advisement from the department of justice
* MOU with the GSA counsel's office (debatable)

Points for no right to privacy:

* A law enforcement agency asked without a subpoena for the documents
* the GSA stated that the emails were subject to auditing

The points for no right to privacy are too weak here to hold up against legal scrutiny.  I don't see how the right to "audit" emails allows them to turn over privileged communications.  

Evidence: 

National Archives advisement: “[t]he materials that [presidential transition team] members create or receive are not Federal or Presidential records, but are considered private materials.” 

U.S. Department of Justice: nearly 30 years maintained that presidential transition entities are not “agencies” within the meaning of the Freedom of Information Act.

Presidential Transition Act of 1963:  provides that a presidential transition must be organized as a “separate fund” and operated as a private social welfare corporation pursuant to section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. 

The multiple memorandums of understanding historically between the GSA and: Hillary, Romney, Obama, Biden reflecting the protections of the transition documents.

The GSA agreed in the MOU that they would delete all emails after the transition: this wouldn't be allowed (based on FOIA) if the transition was a governmental agency.
 


I think most of my reasoning for this comes from experience with "shrink wrap" agreements: http://euro.ecom.cmu.edu/program/law/08-732/Transactions/ShrinkwrapFenwick.pdf  

For example, if a city puts a sign in front of a park that says "Open until 9pm, those staying beyond that time agree to forfeiture of all property."  You would argue that since the person entered onto the property after 9pm, they forfeited their rights to property.  It's an unenforceable contract because no city has the right to do that.  

Or check out this: http://employment.findlaw.com/workplace-privacy/privacy-at-work-what-are-your-rights.html

The employer can listen to your phone calls and emails but has to hang up after identifying the call as personal.  It doesn't matter what the employer makes you sign, the legal protections supercede that.  

My point is that like other contracts, the wording is overly broad and consequently not enforceable in GSA's case, not intended for private organizations who contract with the GSA, and runs counter to legal precedent regarding this situation.  The argument that the GSA has a disclaimer that users shouldn't have an expectation of privacy seems pretty weak.  Can the GSA publish all the emails on the internet?  Can the GSA use insider information seen in the emails as the basis for insider trading?  Based on the Trump lawyer statement, there are multitudes of legal precedents which specifically reference this type of situation. Someone at the GSA basically made a generic disclaimer that we see all the time when loading onto a website, I doubt that is going to carry the day.  

In regards to Mueller's argument and in the context of the Trump lawyer document, he is saying that he got permission from GSA for the transition team emails without a subpoena. 
Based on my reading of the letter from Trump's lawyer with the arguments below and the argument from Mueller that basically says: we asked the GSA for them and they provided them, Mueller gets destroyed in this exchange.  In the context of the judicial proceedings, I think that all the actors where this information was relied on get released on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_of_the_poisonous_tree.  I don't see how Mueller makes it through the rest of the year because this seems like a fail with respect to due process.  Mueller never obtained a subpoena and likely violated the Presidential Transition Act.  Armchair quarterbacking here, but he probably couldn't find anything of substance, got desperate and obtained these emails illegally, and that allowed him to get Flynn.  Without anything on Trump (which I'm not sure what happens if you violate the 4th amendment), he has no counterargument other than the GSA gave them to me, so I used them.  That will be seen as highly unethical for an experienced law enforcement officer and he'll likely get fired/replaced.


I'm including the relevant arguments from the Trump transition lawyer based on their letter to Congress:

https://graphics.axios.com/pdf/letter-to-congressional-committees.pdf?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sendto_newslettertest&stream=top-stories

* Presidential Transition Act of 1963: "Disclosing emails will prevent policy and internal matters that benefit the country as a whole."
* The Trump Foundation for America was a private entity, not a public employee/division of the government
* The Presidential Transition Act of 1963, as amended, provides that a presidential transition must be organized as a “separate fund” and operated as a private social welfare corporation pursuant to
section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. See 3 U.S.C. § 2 note § 3(h)(3)(A). If presidential transition teams were governmental agencies, this requirement would be unnecessary. See generally Internal Revenue Service, 1990 Exempt Organization CPE, available at https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/eotopice90.pdf (discussing tax exemption for governmental entities).
* The U.S. Department of Justice has for nearly 30 years maintained that presidential transition
entities are not “agencies” within the meaning of the Freedom of Information Act. 
* The National Archives recently advised that “[t]he materials that [presidential transition team]
members create or receive are not Federal or Presidential records, but are considered private
materials.”
* The MOU provided that the GSA would delete “all data on [computing] devices” used by the PTT. See MOU ¶ pp. 3, 10. This is both (a) is consistent with memoranda of understanding that the GSA executed with Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney and (b) would be unlawful if presidential transition records were public records
* The agreement between the Obama White House and TFA expressly stated that the parties intended to “protect the confidentiality of transition information made available to the Government.” See Memorandum of Understanding Regarding Transition Procedures, Identification, of Transition 
Contacts, and Access to Non-Public Government and Transition Information ¶ 3, Nov. 8, 2016. Such a confidentiality provision would be unlawful if TFA were a government agency.
I think there is a new post up there re: the emails, so we probably don't need 2 right?
> Civics, what civics?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civics
> No one said anything about impeachment. This is about impeding the special counsel investigation.

I.e. obstruction of justice

For the president, that goes through the Legislative branch, not the Judicial branch.
Real question: should there be attorney-client privilege in government emails?  
>If Mueller didn’t follow the law, a court would suppress the evidence so it couldn’t be used. The reason Trump’s lawyers are writing letters to Congress instead of Mueller or a court is because their legal arguments have no merit.

To impeach the president, you don't go through the judicial branch.  This is like 2nd grade civics.  Impeachment proceedings are Congressional actions (presided over by the Chief Justice who can't influence the action). There is no "court" to "suppress".  It's basic separation of powers.

the dotted line is current results, the solid line is the prediction
http://ceimn.org/ceimn-state-recount-laws-searchable-database/states/Alabama 

Has to be within 0.5%, decent shot of that happening tonight
The NYT prediction effect is strong is here
68% Hillary
Back to tossup boyzzzzzzzzzzz
Here we go.....
Have to use predictions because each precinct is it's own bag, the NYT predictions never swapped back after going for Trump in 2016 fairly early on.  That's why this race is all of the sudden getting exciting.
Can't take this, Moore ahead, Jones ahead, it's going back and forth.  Better than the KY Derby
Yea, I think where this is getting interesting is that this race is going back and forth.  Once the NYT swapped to Trump they never went back
https://www.nytimes.com/elections/forecast/president
I think that was like at 1-2% reporting, it had Trump ahead for most of the night
the NYT always had Trump at tossup or winning.  Reversing from Jones 90% chance of winning to a Moore win would be an even bigger ball buster for libs than MAGA night
Moore is making comeback
Wow, this is Beanie babies all over again.
see my post above on Kansas: the jist is the new plans appeared to have learned from the Kansas experiment because there are new "Kansas" type protections in place.  Because of that, the Kansas example is analogous but not similar.

I'm still looking for some kind of analysis of the potential of these type of supply-side strategies without the obvious Kansas-style abuse loopholes.  If you find some, please share.

Kansas had no protections for preventing abuse related to the recharacterization of business income,  nor did it have a professional exclusion (the best I can tell, maybe someone knows otherwise).  The comparison to Kansas is useful to see what recharacterization abuse looks like, but there are protections against that recharacterization abuse in the current proposals (i.e. not usable by professionals, only a portion of income can be passed-through for wage-type work).  In short, the main reasons cited for Kansas failing are not present (at least to the same degree) in the current proposals.

I blew this post off at first but after reading some legal analyses it actually seemed kind of interesting.

Source of Nixon and Clinton legal claims: https://theintercept.com/2017/05/17/for-donald-trump-a-short-history-of-presidential-obstruction-of-justice/

I think everyone can agree that Trump was trying to influence/sway Comey's investigation.  However, it doesn't appear that he asked someone to lie under oath (what got Clinton and Nixon).  Here is the parallel to Nixon:

> rather a vague offer from a Nixon underling to the judge overseeing the prosecution of Daniel Ellsberg that the judge might be hired as FBI director. According to the Bill of Particulars attached to the three articles of impeachment, this violated 18 U.S. Code § 1503.

I don't think we've seen a quid pro quo (although you could argue that firing Comey would be implied evidence of a quid pro quo that Comey didn't take).  One of the tests I've been using is to what extent would this be irregular if instead of Trump we put your regular district attorney into the role of Trump.  A local prosecutor presumably has the facts of the case and can decide whether to move forward with the case or not.

I tend to agree with the reasoning that the prior examples of obstruction of justice are to a different higher level than Trump is right now and that Trump is fine because he stayed within his constitutional bounds, regardless of what knowledge he had.  What would go outside of those bounds is witness tampering, perjury, or coercing false affidavits; I haven't seen evidence of that.
Yes, I'm frankly surprised that the Obama administration on the video said they had no problem with the transition team reaching out to Russia.  I would venture that it had to do with Obama's Secretary of State department not being in lockstep with the higher up administration.
ABC has deleted and corrected its reporting due to inaccuracies as it relates to candidate Trump: see my post here (https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/7gwibj/what_have_we_learned_from_the_plea_agreement/dqnmnbw/)
Just important to note, as I don't think the OP has stated in the post, that ABC has made several corrections and retractions to its reporting.  This affects several of the above comment threads where people were operating under the assumption that Trump (the candidate) directed the Flynn-Russia talks and not Trump (the President-elect) (edit: it looks like it's now Kushner, and not Trump).  I'm not commenting on the substance of those discussions, just pointing out the corrected new source information since it was used as the source for the post.

* The original ABC tweet about discussions taking place with Trump being a candidate: http://archive.is/whZwl has now been retracted by ABC as inaccurate and deleted
* The original ABC story about the contact being directed by ~~Trump (the candidate) and Flynn~~, ~~Trump (the president-elect) and Flynn~~, now is Flynn and Kushner http://abcnews.go.com/US/senior-trump-transition-official-directed-flynn-contact-russia/story?id=51515179. 
* The original ABC story http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/michael-flynn-charged-making-false-statements-fbi-documents/story?id=50849354 cited by the OP has now been declared partially inaccurate by ABC and corrected by ABC as follows:  

> Correction: During a live Special Report, ABC News reported that a confidant of Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn said Flynn was prepared to testify that then-candidate Donald Trump instructed him to contact Russian officials during the campaign. That source later clarified that during the campaign, Trump assigned Flynn and a small circle of other senior advisers to find ways to repair relations with Russia and other hot spots. It was shortly after the election, that President-elect Trump directed Flynn to contact Russian officials on topics that included working jointly against ISIS.

Even though the GOP is messing up the tax cuts by not pairing with spending cuts, the stock market skyrocketing just shows how much Obama and dems don't have a clue.

That's the part I'm taking issue with, I think yield signs refer to who gets priority (i.e. who doesn't have to stop) in a merge from 2 lanes to 1.
I would agree with normal highway driving but when you have the on-ramp backed up for half a mile and the slow highway lane backed up for a mile then having the on-ramp perpetually yield to the highway would result in no-one being able to use the on-ramp.

Caveat here: except in normal AM/PM commute with heavy traffic on both on-ramp and highway, you should be zipper-merging with the on-ramp and the slow lane.

The website doesn't specifically mention this for the on-ramp traffic situation but I think it's still valid: http://txdotsanantonio.blogspot.com/2016/10/is-zipper-merge-rude.html

The solution to this healthcare process won't come out of Congress, the significant majority of it is a science and economics problem.  I don't want to write a treatise here because it's easier just to read other people who talk about the main cost-drivers of healthcare.  But expecting Congress to solve the healthcare problem is like asking Congress to figure out how to put a man on Mars.
Just to be clear, you're talking about an additional $7000 of costs each year to accurately reflect the taxes on a large benefit you receive from the university. Meanwhile, if your income is already low enough that this is causing a financial burden, then good news your standardized deduction is also getting increased to compensate.  Since you're not taking education loans for the tuition, why are graduate students different from all other people getting loans for an education (professional degrees, undergraduate, nursing, etc)


Alright here it is: https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/reports/53300-individualmandate.pdf

The relevant stat is:

Why are people upvoting a link to a twitter page?
I really enjoyed that link.  

If we look at Paul Ryan's website, under his education issue page: https://paulryan.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=9972#3:

> Higher Education and Student Loan Rates

> In order to improve our system of higher education, we need a framework that accounts for student loans in a way that reflects their true costs, that uses federal dollars more resourcefully, and invests in a sustainable future for all stakeholders, including students, taxpayers, and the institutions themselves.  Today, Americans hold over $1.2 trillion in outstanding student loan debt, a figure that surpasses the total amount of credit card debt held in the United States.

> Decades of policies supported by both political parties have resulted in students racking up dangerous levels of student loan debt.  The goal of federal financial student aid is to make college more affordable; however, the federal government's policies are a contributing factor to the core structural challenge in higher-education financing.  While students continue to chase skyrocketing tuition with ever higher levels of borrowing, economists such as Richard Vedder, have testified before Congress that the structure of the federal government's aid programs is a key driver of higher tuition costs.  In other words, some economists argue that the more funding Congress provides for student loans and grants, the more colleges and universities raise tuition.  Congress must make certain student financial assistance programs are sustainable, while also ensuring policies exist to continue to help those most in need of assistance.

My thought of the reasoning goes like this:

* The tax plan needs additional revenues
* The GOP philosophy is that in cases of healthcare, education (e.g. what we're discussing here), state and local taxes, etc. the federal government is subsidizing market inefficiencies.  Employment health benefits wouldn't be as strong, education benefits wouldn't be as high, state and local taxes wouldn't be as high if the federal government wasn't indirectly paying/subsidizing them.

* To answer your question:

> why shouldn't university employees be offered the tuition waiver as a fringe benefit for their employment at the institution?

I think the reasoning would be because it drives artificially high levels of graduate student enrollment beyond what market rates would dictate (and artificially low graduate student wages).  Since that artificially high level of graduate student benefit is ultimately funded either directly through tax-breaks for that benefit (not collecting revenues on the benefit) or indirectly through higher tuition costs by other students (whose debt is subsidized by the federal government), then it should be removed.  In the healthcare realm we are seeing the same thing, over-generous health benefits create a market distortion because they are tax exempt, I think we can discuss those things in parallel and the same reasoning for that debate can be used here.

What I'm having trouble reconciling is if we do away with this benefit will the costs to the taxpayer ultimately increase because we're creating a new employment class: the graduate-student-teacher (as opposed to the pure graduate-student)?  In order for the university to now employ graduate-student-teachers they can no longer use artificially inflated (and subsidized) education prices to cross-subsidize wages.  I would imagine that wages will now have to increase and that would increase education costs. 

Where are the economists in this sub, wtf are you guys/girls doing, get in here....     

Agreed, that's why it went through the committee.  The caveat was that it wasn't going to be exported because it allayed further national security scrutiny.  It was exported.  The question is why.
My understanding was that this was the timeline of events:

* Tweeden accuses Franken of sexual assault
* Franken says he doubts veracity of account: "Franken first issued a brief apology, saying his actions were intended to be funny and that he didn’t recall the incident the way Leeann Tweeden did."
* At least half a dozen Senate Democrats urged their chamber’s six-member, bipartisan ethics committee to investigate the allegations.
* Franken criticized for "not really apologizing"
* Picture comes out of second Franken sexual assault while Tweeden sleeping (? I'm not sure where in the timeline this fits in ??? )
* Franken comes out with a second extended statement where he more fully apologizes. 
* Franken then says he'll “gladly cooperate” with an ethics investigation
* Franken then says he'll join call for ethics investigation into himself

Commentary: I think we have a long way to go in rooting out sexual assault in the US.  In regards to the OP initial statement we need to clarify what "beginning" means.  Did Franken originate the idea for the ethics investigation or did he agree to it after it had already been proposed, after the picture had been published, and after the backlash.  If he originated the idea then that would be much more benevolent.

You answered the relevant point and are making my point.  What I'm alluding to is that it's not the amount of uranium that is going into Russia (I'm not saying it's necessarily going to Russia...) which is important, it's what amount of uranium is going out of the US or rather what percentage of uranium the US "controls".  Russia has one of the largest stockpiles and largest natural deposits (9% of world reserves), the US doesn't (1% of world reserves).

http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/uranium-resources/supply-of-uranium.aspx#ECSArticleLink4

If Russia has 90 cows, and the US has 10 cows then saying that: "hey Russia now controls 2 more (US) cows, but who cares if they get more, they already have plenty"  doesn't acknowledge that those cows come from the US which sees a relatively more significant reduction in its controlled potential.  


If you can find a source that backs your claim that uranium isn't a strategic national security asset, then I'll take a look.  The vast vast majority of all national security experts consider uranium a strategic nuclear security asset.

Here's another clue that might help you.  Why do you think the reports talk about the size of the deal in terms of US capacity instead of Russian capacity? Where do you think the largest uranium deposits are in the world (and simultaneously where they're not)?  Answering those questions will get you where you need to go.


> expect he he only gave these as examples for irelevant arguments.

You're missing the point because op set up a false logic chain.  The national security concern is not directly or indirectly related to Russia's weapon stockpile inventory.
There's a difference between commenting on assumptions of fact and commenting on the relevance or merit of a point.  It's a common fallacy.

For example: Kids are ruthless killers, therefore it's a ridiculous premise that kids should be able to own weapons without their parents permission.  

No one would suggest that the point is invalid, but the premise is nonsense.  It's rule #2 of the sub FYI.

Agreed. I think the implication is that there is a trade-off between physician fatigue and handoff, and does one have a predominant effect?  Increase the physician fatigue to decrease the handoffs, or decrease the physician fatigue to increase the handoffs.  It seems that of the strategies tried so far they create effects in opposite directions of around the same magnitude; no free lunch.  
edit: I should ask, are you talking about the education part or the patient care part?

I would agree with "evidence indicates" but not "clearly" indicates (see below).  These are randomized controlled studies, which is the gold standard in science, so I think they're credible.  

It's controversial.  Would appreciate any evidence that you have that makes your point though, always looking to learn.  

> The ACGME modified its duty hour regulations in 2017. The new regulations were based in part on randomized trials of different duty hour structures conducted in general surgery and internal medicine residency programs. The Flexibility in Duty Hour Requirements for Surgical Trainees (FIRST) trial, published in 2015, randomized 118 general surgery residency programs to adhere to the 2011 ACGME regulations or to abide by more flexible rules that essentially followed the prior standard of a maximum 80-hour workweek. The study found no significant differences in patient outcomes, including death and serious complications. The iCompare trial, a similar study involving internal medicine residency programs, completed data collection in 2016. On the basis of these results, the ACGME eliminated the 16-hour shift limit for first-year residents, but kept the remainder of the 2011 regulations: an overall 80 hour per week work limit, maximum shift duration of 24 hours (plus 4 hours for transitioning care), one day off per week (averaged over a 4-week period), and on-call no more than once every 3 nights.

https://psnet.ahrq.gov/primers/primer/19/duty-hours-and-patient-safety
The (debatable) reason is continuity of care.  Is it better to have the same tired doctor or 2 different well-rested doctors? The reasoning goes like this: let's say you get into a car-wreck and you're going to go in for emergency surgery that night.  

Is it better for Dr. A who saw you in the ER, worked you up, and started your surgery be the one to finish it, and make sure you are alright after your surgery?  Or should (like happens in the flight attendant world) halfway through the surgery the doctor that originally saw you goes over their shot-clock and has to get subbed out for a new doctor.  People argue that this handoff diminishes patient care (because there isn't continuity) and doctor education (because the experience is interrupted).

You don't understand how things work on reddit.  Let me educate you:

* First we must read something and identify how it makes us feel.  This feeling will guide us the rest of the way so embrace it and internalize it as much as you can.**
* To make sure what you're feeling is appropriate, check around you and in other comments to make sure that what you're feeling is what everyone is feeling.  If the two align, then you're good.  If they are not aligned, then go watch CNN for an hour, and come back.  Repeat this process until everything aligns.**
* Next to every comment (to the right of a person's username) there is a score (X points).  This is the feeling alignment score.  You want a high score because that ensures that you have a high feelings alignment with the community.** 
* Be careful of people who try to use facts without any feelings.  Like we said in the beginning, facts are the natural born children of feelings (the parents); facts without feeling are therefore illegitimate.  Science proves that children come from parents so this is a logical certainty; people that disagree with you therefore don't believe in science.**

> From what I know no uranium was transferred because the Nuclear Regulatory Committee never approved any transfer based on the clintons approval or influence.

Since you've asked me to parse out your original response.  First, the sentence is improperly constructed because you have two ideas juxtaposed: uranium transfer, and transfer based on Clinton's approval or influence.  My guess is what you were trying to say is that no uranium was transferred due to Clinton's influence or approval.  That would fit more with the responses you've followed with.  Is that what you're trying to say?

Please try to be courteous to other posters.  Any intelligent person will just think less of you when you adhom attack, because it generally means you've lost the argument.


My quote of you is verbatim.  If you want to talk about Clinton that's fine, I'm not talking about Clinton.  I'm talking about the transfer of uranium.  Within the scope of uranium transfer (ignoring anything Clinton related) you are incorrect.
You made the assertion that no uranium was transferred. I just fact checked and showed that that is false.

Please tell me where I referenced the Clintons and I'll remove it.  OP isn't asking about the Clintons.  Your response will get deleted anyways, so it actually doesn't matter.

If they want to kick him out of the university, then the onus is on Eve.
The bigger problem with this conversation is that I didn't see any engagement on the context and scope of the Muslim conversation.  Frame and define the problem before arguing about it whether it was appropriate or not.

We need to know what was said during the Muslim conversation, even a brief synopsis.  If you had given Eve this synopsis it would have gone a long way to forcing her to adjudicate the difference between protecting "politeness" and "freedom of speech."  Without agreeing on these original principles you gave her an easy and plausible winning strategy by granting her the point that the conversation must have been inappropriate in tone and therefore the goal of politeness was an overriding principle.

> Just to point out: Association != correlation.

Let me debug your code, you skipped a step which makes your statement not true:

Causation != correlation

Correlation is a type of association (I'm still giving you an up vote for bringing out the stats lingo, I'm glad someone appreciates stats :D ).  Check out the studies though, they referenced correlation.
Low sweating is associated with lower "physical fitness" (overall longterm fitness level) and lower physical intensity.  Your sweating will go up significantly (both statistically and physiologically speaking) as you train. 

On a trivia note: women have more sweat glands but men produce more sweat per gland.

Side note, other things that can decrease your sweat rate:

* Dehydration: Make sure you drink enough water before working out
* Being from a colder climate (no "heat acclimatization")
* Exercising naked

I think I see what you're saying.  Is this close: was Steele getting opposition research (true opposition research) that was potentially removed from the Kremlin election destabilization mission (mix of true and fake opposition research)?  

Furthermore, is a good way to separate the former from the latter looking at whether Steele approached informants (presumably yielding less tainted intel) versus being approached (presumably yielding more likely tainted intel)?

If my characterization is accurate, that would be interesting to see if election law makes that intent distinction for foreign "interference".  It seems like there is a moral difference, which when you say important difference, I assume that's what you're implying.

Since you're making a legal claim here I'll make your claim a little more accurate.  Illegal immigration can be a criminal or civil offense.  Continuing  the metaphor, illegal/improper entry is a criminal offense which is closest to the example used above.  You would be right if the metaphor ran as something like: "I invited a friend over and he wouldn't leave."  That would be a civil offense because is unlawful presence.

I don't think we know that.  If you're suspecting collusion then you could say that the DNC hired Perkins who hired FusionGPS who hired Steele to produce the dossier, so the DNC wanted Steele; therefore they wanted a/the dossier.  If you're not suspecting collusion then the DNC hired Perkins etc. etc. and FusionGPS decided to try harder this time around (more money given by Perkins?, more leads?, more pressure?) by hiring Steele who produced the dossier.

At the end of the day it could be as innocuous as the DNC saying, hey get me something on Trump; and the FISA Steele-Russia stuff is unrelated or non-sense.  Or it could be as bad as Steele funneling Russian intelligence up the chain to the DNC.  

The only we can find out is someone in the DNC-PerkinsCoie-Elias-FusionGPS-Steele chain would have to talk or there would have to be some kind of surveillance intel on what was going on.  All we have right now is failure to disclose properly by listing the DNC-PerkinsCoie first chain as "legal services" when instead it should be listed as "research."  


Started by Republicans, continued by DNC.  The argument/difference is Steele came on after DNC took it over.  Most accusations are leveled around Steele's involvement, the best I can tell (see my main post above).
This is somewhat complicated, and I thought Ben Shapiro (who is a Republican but not pro-Trump) over at the dailywire, in his opinion piece yesterday (http://www.dailywire.com/podcasts/22728/ep-403-clintonian-lies-and-republican-flake-out) did a good job of breaking it down and being fair to both sides on what is proven (not that much) and what is not (a lot). I haven't seen it completely mentioned in the comments yet so I'll paraphrase below:

What we know:

* Opposition research file was originally commissioned by Republican donor but was discontinued after Trump won primary.  In April 2016 Perkins Coy law firm owned by Mark Elias (represents Clinton presidential campaign and DNC) took it over.  Not until after Mark Elias came on board did Steele (the former British spy) come on board.
* June 2016 DNC hacked (allegedly by Russia).  Fusion GPS hired Orbis Business Intelligence Services (British firm, but undertaken by Steele).  
* Steele didn't think FBI were taking his reports seriously so he gave it to McCain, who brought it to Comey.
* Comey brings it to Trump in 1/2017. 

Potential implications and things we wish we knew:

* If the DNC and HRC knew that what Steele was getting this from Russia, and the dossier was being used as the basis of the Obama administration to get Trump campaign wiretaps, then that's a big deal.  We don't know if this is true.
* If HRC and DNC knew that Russia was funneling opposition research to Steele, then it means that Russia was colluding with the DNC against Trump.  We don't know if this is true.
* Mark Elias (the lawyer for DNC, who hired Fusion GPS) has been lying for a year to the NYT saying he wasn't involved in the dossier.  Why was he lying?  We don't know why.
* FusionGPS has pled the 5th when asked about who funded the dossier.  This is not an admission of guilt, but why are they taking the 5th?  We don't know.
* Fusion GPS vs Browder (who pushed for sanctions on Russia) case may show that FusionGPS has a history of illicitly (illegally?) working with the Russian government on political items, based on a Browder accusation against FusionGPS where he alleges a smear campaign done with assistance from the Russian government (http://www.businessinsider.com/fusion-gps-trump-russia-dossier-bill-browder-2017-7) "Browder has argued that Fusion would have broken the law if it lobbied on behalf of the Russian government without registering as a foreign agent. In December, he lodged a formal complaint with the Department of Justice alleging that Fusion's work for BakerHostetler on behalf of Prevezon violated disclosure requirements".

edit: If you're trying to wrap your mind around everyone's relationships, here is the chain between DNC and dossier from what we know right now: DNC (hired Perkins & Elias) -> Perkins Coie + Mark Elias (hired Fusion GPS) -> Fusion GPS (did original opp research against Trump in primary, hired Steele after DNC joined) -> Steele (former British spy, also worked on DNC hack) -> Dossier
Oic, I think people are assuming this is being bid out by the USA government.  I can imagine why getting linemen to go to Puerto Rico (who may not have power, food, water) AND not get paid, might have to get paid a nice premium to take the risk.  I'm still concerned and would like to see it investigated but I can imagine how the costs may be in the expected range for the situation.
What were the other bids? That would tell us most of what we need to know.
What does hesitating over concerns about payment mean?  
Yea, I think getting people to work in Puerto Rico is a little tougher than Florida.  That being said I'd like to see the other bids and an investigation before getting my pitchfork.  It does seem very pricey though.  

Doesn't a can of coke cost something like $50 to get to a soldier in the middle east?  
Only thing that sucks about 401K is no pension healthcare benefit.  As far as $$$ (without health) goes, 401K > pension annuity because of inflation rape.

https://federalnewsradio.com/retirement/2017/05/trumps-proposed-retirement-changes-would-have-major-impacts-on-current-feds-and-retirees/
I looked at pensions versus 401K and the pensions always look good until you see that the cost of living adjustments suck so it's awesome for the first 10 years of retirement, then you just start getting demolished in inflation.  401K + match is where it's at b/c you can beat inflation, just have to have discipline.

The real awesomeness in pensions is the health-insurance benefit, not the annuity, which is why employers/cities hate them.
Why don't they just not match so you can at least utilize the tax-benefits?  I'm not sure what the requirements are for 401K though, do employers have to contribute?
I think they are trying to say: you will get $4000 more in your bank account after everything is said and done because of various tax policy changes.  I think they used the word "raise" to be more plain-spoken.  

Tl;dr: Instead of $1000 to spend on alcohol, you will now have $5000.
What's your thought on the estate tax?  I listened to the Cruz-Sanders youtube tax debate and couldn't decide on where I stood on this.  

I believe that cutting taxes starves out the federal government and by Darwinism kills wasteful spending, so cutting taxes is good.  At the same time, the theory behind allowing people to keep more of what they earn is that you want to incentivize independent wealth creation, a social good.  However, all of these billionaires shielding their wealth from kids through donating makes me think there is something intrinsically/ethically bad about not doing some kind of redistribution after the person we've been incentivizing is dead.  What is the goal of getting rid of the estate tax in terms of policy, rewarding the kids for doing what, being born?

Not to go all Pocahontas in here, but I kind of like the idea of when you're alive we (the US) does everything in our power to make you as super-wealthy as we can, because that sort of behavior helps everyone around them.  The contract though is that after you die, you pay back that "investment" the US made in you to help the next cycle of entrepreneurs and workers.  Additionally, I'm worried about the arguments made in "Why Nations Fail" that creating an hereditary elite dooms countries to a slow-spiral into failure as wealth, then power, gets concentrated by birthright. 

What if the estate tax proceeds went into some kind of small-business development fund and was shielded from pork-barrel?
My tldr of the argument for deficit spending is that over a long time horizon (50 years) it will net benefit the economy like any intelligent investment.  

However that assumes the spending is useful and not wasteful.  Balancing the budget is not about getting rid of the deficit per se, it's about the hypothesis that with a finite amount of money available, the "bad" investments get pushed out by the "good" investments.   
How does making a profit support your narrative of the Russian taking "huge losses" as a money laundering scheme.  Interesting you left that part out....  fyi, that was your main argument, nt though.

At least you're consistent using the same pseudomath to say that Obama didn't increase the debt and that he "decreased the deficit" (he doubled the entire country's history of debt).   That's so patently false I can tell you're trolling now.  Sorry, I block trolls.
Right, the cost of financing is very low for us.  I think the argument is that even with high deficit spending are we really getting our national priorities or is it being wasted?
Dude, if you want to trans, you don't have to make excuses to us.
The toe thing is only going to work for 6 weeks max.

Tie a rope to your swimsuit and save gas in the boat by pulling it.  Everyone wins.
Currency inflation is like jumping off a bridge, it's fun but you only get to do it once.
I wish republicans would balance the budget.  Doing it when they hold all the power would give them a generation of superiority on economic issues.  Especially if they do it off of Obama equaling the debt of the entire USA history.
Yea, we really need a balanced budget amendment (I'm republican).  Winning any election doesn't mean you get to go on a celebratory shopping spree.  Although, I wonder how if we could ever have a growth based economy if we didn't allow some deficit spending.  For example, you could deficit spend but it would have to be repaid completely every 10 years.  That would prevent selfish generations like the baby boomers from suiciding the country on their way out but at the same time give some leeway for "investments" when deficit spending might make sense.
So you're accusing Trump of money laundering on a deal with the proof being the Russian took a huge loss where the Russian is actually going to make money http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/why-did-russian-oligarch-pay-so-much-for-mansion-owned-by-trump/2316032 .  Do you see why I think you're crazy?

And the reason Uranium one is in the news now is the gag order on the informant and figuring out whether the fbi and the approval panel had any contact before the sale went through.  That you've missed that important point means that you're either ignorant (best case) because it's been in nearly every article about the new allegations.  It's interesting how you are so worried about Russia until it doesn't fit your narrative.  Why not hear what the informant who had a gag order about real money laundering, bribery, and extortion has to say.

Here is the difference between us.  You have no concept of likelihood or equal application of justice.  You don't like Trump?  That's fine.  But it's intellectually dishonest to say: we are going to treat X accusation as likely because it aligns with my narrative.  

If the informant on the Clinton-Obama uranium investigation comes back empty, that's fine with me, but it should be completely investigated.  You are obviously not okay with being wrong and are making up whatever conspiracies you can because it's your narrative that matters, not the truth.  At the end of the day, people won't remember the wild goose chase of Russia, they'll remember that Democrats wasted at least a year of American time because they couldn't intellectually reconcile losing an election on their own terms.  You don't care that Podesta crafted this we lost because of Russia narrative hours after the election results came back (read Shattered).  

Democrats are all narrative and no substance.  Where is the proof?  You've wasted a year on this investigation, where are the convictions?  How long do you plan on keeping this up?  https://www.inverse.com/article/37463-conspiracy-beliefs-illusory-pattern-perception


I know that if you're a Dem, facts don't matter and that the hurricane was probably racist but you don't have to hang out in the situation room as president in order to respond.

You should hold him to real world standards instead of using the principles and expectations you saw in Moana.  I think you would only be satisfied if Trump replaced the heart of Tafiti and Puerto Rico was restored to a tropical paradise as a magical fog swept through the island.

Just so we're clear.  Your argument is that Russia has been prepping Trump (who hasn't held political office before) since 2004 as a sleeper agent for the Kremlin in hopes that he would run and win in the 2016 presidential election, by overpaying for his mansion.  Meanwhile we have actual evidence of bribery via the Clinton foundation and Uranium one being investigated by the Fbi to the tune of $140 million.  

Is that the Democrat argument?
wtf, why would they be also transporting casino chips?
Thanks for the link, will look into it.
So based on your response, you disagree with uranium being a strategic resource because we already have enough of it?  So you think this bribery/kickback/extortion/money-laundering Obama-Clinton thing was just for money?
http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/355749-fbi-uncovered-russian-bribery-plot-before-obama-administration

> Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.

> They also obtained an eyewitness account — backed by documents — indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton’s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.

Could you comment on the practical implications of Moscow "controlling" 20% of America's uranium?  If Russia "controlled" a portion of US uranium, would that actually impede our ability to create as many nuclear weapons as we wanted?  Couldn't we source from other locations if Russia embargoed our own uranium?  Overall, did this agreement have actual strategic military effect/implications or was it purely financial?

> Eliminating corporate taxes would cause the stock market to rise at least in the short to medium term. This would not increase tax receipts.

> Run away inflation would cause the stock market to rise, it would not be indivative of a health economy.

> Lowing the interest rate would cause the stock market to rise, it would not be indicative of a health economy.

These are all incorrect because there are many counter-examples with less than a minute of google searching.  You're falling for your own fallacy of over-simplistic reasoning.  Lower corporate taxes doesn't necessarily translate into increase in stock prices.  The stock market is a lot better economic indicator than what you're giving it credit for.  

http://gersteinfisher.com/viewpoints/politics-tax-rates-stock-market/

Do you have any sources or are you just making this stuff up on the fly?  The only think you've provided was to the bolivar denominated Venezuelan market which I've already shown is a false analogy that doesn't apply to the US.  
Every businessman has a lot of asteriks.  Democrats were just trying to play off vulnerable uneducated people without business experience.   No one seriously believes that every business idea will be successful.  I'd bet 100% of entrepreneurship books have that in there somewhere.  
Good question.  The answer is that the link you provided has a denomination of bolivar, which is in an inflationary crisis.  The stock market is being used partly as a hedge for inflationary risk, and part of the rally you are seeing is a currency in crisis.  Both factors can be deceiving.  

I haven't seen an argument that the us stock market is being used as an inflationary hedge or that the US dollar is undergoing hyperinflation, but if what you're implying by your analogy is accurate I'd like to see your sources.
I know right.  You know where I get my news: finance.google.com
He's trying to put it into perspective for the American people.  What he said is factually correct.  Higher stock market values generally means healthier national industry and wealth which translates into higher tax receipts etc... 

Democrats just trying to deflect for pedogate and Awangate.  I liked the 90s when it was the Republicans with their pure business, low taxes mantra and the Democrats with generally intelligent social and fiscal policies which were a little less pro-business.  Now the only thing I see coming out of Democrats is race-baiting, corruption, and pedophilia.  The Republicans meanwhile can't balance the budget to save their lives.  

With those options, I'll take Trump making a pretty loose metaphor any day.  Hopefully the US citizens can blow up both parties and we can go back to some semblance of pure economic growth without race-baiting, deficit spending, and corruption.
I love that they're trying to make a point about how bad the President's math/econ judgement is by calling a billionaire a failure.  The irony.

I think what you're getting at: 

* Is it morally wrong for a police officer to limit the suspects options from: 1) stop or flee to 2) stop or kill the police. 

I think you're getting confused because things are happening almost simultaneously. Let's think about a different example. What would you think about a guy robbing a convenience store and the cop pulls up and stands in the door blocking his exit?  Would that be acceptable behavior on the part of the police.  What you're missing here is that cop is not preventing the suspect from stopping, the cop has still given the suspect a choice.  The suspect has chosen to kill the police; lethal force is justified. 

No jury would ever come close to convicting this officer in this situation.  This one is cut and dry. It's part of the police's job to protect the society around, it's the not the police's job to make the suspect's getaway convenient.

For insurance purposes, would this be considered two accidents?  The first accident happens, then there is a break, they resume normal operations, and then the second accident happens.

Sharia is not outlawed on Nevada.  This just shows the prejudice out there that people assume Muslim practices should be outlawed.

We can show that we are not racist bigots by supporting new communities.  If they want to pursue their religion and practice Sharia then they should be allowed.  I'm not saying this was an honor killing but we shouldn't rush to judgment.
Wow, that is very bigoted.  What if this was an attempted honor killing which is permitted under Sharia law?  We should be tolerant and not jump to conclusions just because people have different beliefs.  Muslims have gone through enough persecution and we shouldn't further it on this sub.

Your own link disproves your theory: 

> "The second part — the Trump Tower part — is also possibly true based on what CNN reported"

All we know for sure was that Manifort was "tapped", Manifort was involved in Trump's campaign, and Manifort had an apartment at Trump tower.  Whether or not the things he did were illegal (i.e. he was "a illegal"), or if Manafort was a foreign agent, remains to be seen.  You prejudging those items without any additional information is fundamentally flawed and that type of reasoning is ignorant.  In any moderated forum your comments would be deleted because they aren't sourced; you shouldn't mistake an opinion for an informed opinion.
You brought up the idea of Trump colluding with Russia twice in your post.  That you are not willing to provide any evidence to back it up proves my original point.
The problem with your reasoning is you're making the non-sequitur off Russia interfered, Trump won, therefore Trump colluded with Russia.  It's impossible to convince anyone of anything if you're going to start the journey in that kind of wasteland.  

It's easy to see the motive behind Putin's actions: retribution for prior meddling in their internal affairs, and damaging the confidence of the electors.  

You're buying into the conspiracy that was hatched as the narrative by Podesta the day after the election as a way to delegitimize the victory and soften the defeat.  You should check out the book "Shattered."  

If all the intelligence agencies and the FBI statements, and the lack of any evidence to support your position of fact that: yes, Trump colluded with Russia.  You're just doing yourself and the country a disservice when you make up things to push your policy preferences.  If you disagree about immigration policy or healthcare policy that's fine, but if you're too much of a chicken to actually recognize those are the real policy discussions and instead want to play in the fantasy land of strawman conspiracy, then you should just leave the rest of the nation out of it because it's a waste of time.

But hey, you can prove me wrong: what facts do you have that Trump colluded with Russia?
My basic take on Russia is that it wants to keep the status quo and wants to prevent any more US-backed regime change in the middle east and Russia (which would impact Russia's strong sphere of influence in the region).  That is partly why he hates Hillary because of her pro-regime change in Russia policy.  

Whether or not we need to be more friendly with Russia is a complicated discussion and hyperbole by Democrats making it look like an obvious decision and that Trump must be treasonous to consider it just does disservice to the credibility of the Democratic Party as being incapable of having balanced discourse.  In a few words, the Democrats are embodying Antifa policies: any opinion alternative to their own is a "violent" thought crime.  That is definitely more dangerous than Russia.

I don't think you know what those words mean.
Hearings are coming up about the DNC leak, Awan story.  Lots of corruption to go around.  
It's hard to tell how many Democrats are involved but I'd start with Susan Rice.

Obama blowing off Russia: https://youtu.be/5z0WrEb6p6I?t=1m44s
I agree with this.  I just wanted acknowledgment that suspicions of Trump collusion does not substitute for blame everywhere in 2016.  Trump deserves not to be a scapegoat just as much as Obama.  

And to be real we all know that the US and Russia spy like crazy on each other.  Trump trying to recreate a partnership with Russia is not stupid.
Republicans and Democrats should be held accountable.  But the Executive branch failed to protect us, and slow played this because they thought Hillary was going to win and didn't want to be seen as supporting Trump, I.e. they were playing politics.  Once Congress got involved there was no good solution because it was only a couple months before the election and the Russian strategy was to create uncertainty about our elections.

It's like Obama saying: hey Congress there's a nuclear missile on the way to the USA, now that you know we can all share the blame.  This was a huge national security blunder by Obama and deflecting it to Trump makes no sense.  Further exacerbated by Obama coming out and saying it was ignorant for anyone to question the sanctity of our elections.


Then you don't know what rigged means.  
You need to read about what a FISA court actually is.  FISA courts don't submit applications for warrants.
https://youtu.be/ZPpt7-QOGKc

If this is true then the Democrats both lied about surveillance of the opposition party and showed great ineptitude by allowing Russia to influence the election.  If they knew about it and the situation was so dire, why did they not try to stop it?  Obama said it wasn't an issue.  And remember that Trump was cleared by Comey.  

Either way it shows the Democrats as corrupt or inept, now it is just a matter of which one is more.  You can't care so much about Russian interference and then not hold the Democrats responsible for letting it happen.  Only when they don't win do they want to cry about it.  We can't allow such corruption of the Democrats, who would allow perversion of our election system, to go unpunished.
When there is evidence of collusion by Trump then you're right, but there isn't and hasn't been; that was confirmed by Comey.  Foreign governments take positions on elections all of the time.  That Hillary was so internationally inept that Russia didn't want her to win just further proves how dangerous she was in the international scene.  If you understood why Russia hates HRC you would get it.  It's Obama's job to protect the election, not Trump (if there is no collusion).  If you care so much about interference why don't you want to remove the party that was in power that allowed it?  That's right, you don't, you just want to whine about losing an election.  Hypocritical and illogical.
Would love to be smoking what you're smoking if shitposting by Russia is worse than cheating during a debate or wiretapping the opposition party campaign.
Yea, Russians hacked the election and the DNC computers so the DNC was so upset about democracy that they didn't let the FBI examine them.  Does that make sense to you?

In terms of election tampering, when the head of the DNC gives Hillary the debate questions illicitly before the debate but democrats want to get upset about shitposts regarding Hillary's health when she passes out on 9/11 and can't even get in a car.

This is why Democrats don't deserve leadership.  They focus on Russian shitposts instead of cleaning up their own party.  Trump calls it like it is, a swamp that needs to be cleaned of corruption, and he's ridiculed.  The Democrats want the corruption to continue, they're the pro-corruption party.
Why did you think the idea the election could be rigged was crazy when Hillary was given the debate questions by the head of the DNC?  That's proven, all this Trump stuff is not.  Seems hypocritical.
Shitposting is not voter fraud.  You should look up what voter fraud means.
That all sounds nice but it's not financially feasible.  I'd like for everything to be affordable and awesome but that's naive given how much that philosophy costs to implement.  

What you described was the general philosophy of Obama with the healthcare philosophy of Bernie Sanders.  

And so what happened with the Obama experiment: Obama equaled the debt of all prior presidents combined (now $20 trillion), the healthcare policies led to high unsustainable premiums with insurance companies exiting the market (healthcare insurance technically yes but premiums and deductibles are not affordable), costs of education skyrocketed and a shrinking middle class with stagnant wages. 
 
So if your goals are what you stated, why do you think the Democrats and their policies deserve a second chance given their track record?

Trump wants to decrease healthcare premiums by increasing personal responsibility and increasing health insurance competition, loosening regulations to expand economic opportunities for the middle class, and refocusing educational priorities so that people are actually educated for the jobs that our economy needs.  

I hear a lot of platitudes from Democrats but no real concept of how to implement them or pay for them.  

How are you judging your ideas: gdp growth, unemployment, median incomes, federal debt?

Yea, the racist voting block is huge. Love how Robert Byrd and the Democrats call the GOP racist when the mentor of your party leader in 16 was a KKK leader.

What's the Democrat party platform now a days: Russia and illegal immigration in exchange for votes?  What do Democrats stand for?
You should use the term "merit based immigration" because that solves 2&3.
You know that more than 1 person does polls right

Actually Gallup only has 5 point spread between the worst Obama numbers and the worst Trump numbers.  That was closer than I thought.
I will, just don't wear any pants or shirts so we know we're on the same team.

How am I supposed to get my Apple sticker though?  The biggest tool alert for me is seeing someone with a case and a hole that's created just to show the Apple sticker.  I point that out to my kids and say: "that's why we call those people a-holes."
Consumer confidence and small business confidence has a lot to do with Trump which affects those things.  If you remember on election night, they had a stock ticker on the screen because the Democrats believed that Trump was going to affect world stock prices...that night.  It's quite funny that Democrats don't understand the economy enough to think that Trump was going to cause a stock market crash that night and even more hilarious that after it started going up they removed the stock ticker.  

But if your argument is that Democrats believe Trump has nothing to do with the economy then that's not really a valid place to start a conversation and fairly disingenuous.  

You can find plenty of Democrats who sold their stock when Trump was elected and missed out on the huge bull market the last year.  It just shows you that Democrats are out of touch with the economy and immigration.  They want to run on an identity politics platform and then Democrats just decimate the Latino and black communities.  As those groups get on the Trump train they'll realize that having a larger paycheck and a better run country is more important than buying into the identity politics of Democrats.  When you don't have legit ideas, all you have left is confusing your base with identity politics.  Trump doesn't care about your race, if you smoke weed, what gender you are, he wants to dominate the world economy and he wants to be known as business president.  Don't buy into the cries for help from Democrats.
My first point is that comparing 12months*8years=96 data points to 9 months = 9 data points isn't as useful from a statistic standpoint as having at least a full term to compare.  That being said, Obama's polls fell a lot more (but from higher) his first few months in office. 
I ran the numbers, however, and it only ends up influencing his average overall number by less than a point, so not a big deal.  

Obama average across entire presidency: 47

Trump average across first 9 months: 39

http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/popularity.php?pres=45&sort=time&direct=DESC&Submit=DISPLAY

We're talking 8 points using all of Obama's "golden years" of which there was an ebb and flow.  He dipped several times <40 and lived at low 40s for over a year.  For example if you look from 11/2013-11/2014 = 12 months, Obama's average was 42.  If you take out Trump's last month (which was a lot lower than his prior) then you get around 42.  

Obama had low numbers probably because he alienated the inner-cities, doubled the deficit (relative to all prior presidents combined) and had a failed foreign policy. He barely beats Truman on your suck scale.  Trump has low numbers mainly because of a false narrative about a Russian conspiracy.  Obama had poor numbers for legitimate reasons.  Trump would go up 10 points if Mueller exonerates him.    

I agree if you compare Trump to JFK he'd lose on polling numbers, but so would Obama.  Both would lose by >20 points.

Edit tl;dr: I'll agree that there is an 8 point approval difference between Trump and Obama.
   
Do you know how statistics work?  Tell me: what does statistical significance and sampling mean to you.  If you can answer me that question I'll take you seriously.  Otherwise you're just putting on a cheap impersonation of someone with legitimate arguments.  Sorry it's tough to differentiate which crowd you're a part.

Edit/update: I checked the first 3 pages of your comment/post history.  Considering your average arguments are approximately 1 line long, I think we can all see what kind of level you're operating on.  Please go to the kid table if you want to argue.  Or at least make 1 well-thought out argument that lasts more than 3 lines and I'll take it seriously and respond.  I'm not going to respond to background noise.
Yea, just like the KKK was originally part of the Democratic party. Blah blah blah.  Too easy.  You got anything else?  I need a challenge.

Oh and the TL;DR of my prior exchange was that I wasn't ascribing the Birther movement to Hillary, I conceded that it was Hillary supporters.  Looks like your narrative is the only thing getting run-over with a Dodge Challenger, ha!  I may use that metaphor in the future.
McCallister park is pretty legit trail running (you can get lost), I think that will eventually be my longer loop run, just have to figure out how to stay oriented.  Hardberger and Medical center trail is more hybrid standard loop trails, but you'll have to repeat to get 7.  
I don't know for all presidents, but Obama's didn't.  They bounced back and forth for 7 years.  

Considering Democrats think Trump is actually Vladimir Putin wearing a mask, Trump has lots of room to go up.  It's hard to not approve of a president with record stock market levels, highest median incomes, and shrinking deficits.  If he can just get the merit based immigration platform through, there's no stopping him.
Trump average for 9 months is 39.  Obama average for 96 months is 48.  Ask any statistician if that's statistically significant....Nope.  Especially considering how Obama's approval ratings fell off a cliff after the first few months, that's why his numbers are even that high.

I'm sorry if you think it was a solely republican fault, but the Muslim and Birther movements had Hillary "supporters" all over it, using your own cited evidence.  No Democrat should be proud about their role there.  Plus I'm giving you charity by letting you use politifact as the only source.  I would venture other sources wouldn't be as kind, but I'm fine with living with Hillary supporters instead of Hillary campaign, in addition to Trump and Republicans.  

Did you ever see Arpaio's birther video.  Did that ever get debunked?
I agree he pushed it but the takeaway is that multiple people on the Democrat and Republican party have pushed it for political expediency.  The Republicans don't own this alone.
Alright, so the link you posted says it was started by "Supporters of Hillary." So I apologize, it was started by Hillary supporters, not by the Hillary campaign.

Interestingly it says the the theory that Obama is a Muslim was promoted (who started?) by people in her campaign (at the bottom).  Didn't know that.  
Alright, if Clinton didn't start it, I'll take a look again.  I could be wrong. You have any go to sources?
You aren't even using the term hypernormalisation correctly, lol.  Do you see what I mean now?  If you're going to be arrogant at least know what you're talking about.  
If you represent you know data but you don't then it's better to read a book than try to argue.  

Coming on here to prove you have no facts to back up your data is just publicly humiliating yourself.  Where are your facts?  Why don't you use real numbers?  That's right, you don't know them.  You're quite arrogant for that amount of ignorance.
Trump just doesn't care.  Mueller was just his way of compartmentalizing it.  The way I think of it: if Hillary lost an election because she couldn't find anything on Russia, the chances are pretty low they're going to find it now. Also keep in mind that Podesta came up with the Russia narrative the day after Hillary's loss.  I would agree that Trump embellished the support he had for Obama birth certificate stuff, interestingly that was started by Hillary's campaign.

But, if the Democrats want to dig their grave for 2018 then they have every right to.
Calling 95% negative coverage of Trump as just bias shows all we need to know about the intelligence of the speaker.  
Trump is at 40, Obama bottomed out at 41.  Check out realclearpolitics, they have lots of data.
Same amount of time Trump was...0.
Exactly.  Except Republicans expect cover because "their guy won."  However the Republican party of the future is merit based immigration, low taxes, and the freedom to live in your state how you want to live.  The old Republican ideals will die.  Meanwhile, the Democrats stand for what now, a universal healthcare system they don't know how to pay for, and unbridled illegal immigration forcing legal immigrant applicants to constantly wait in the back of line.  The Democrats are about illegal immigration because they have no clear path to American success and they have to bribe people with citizenship to vote for them.
Take a look at the Harvard analysis of news coverage based on company and tell me it's not super biased.  It's a joke, not real news.  What's the real news?  Highest median incomes ever, deficit going down, stock market up.  What do liberals have to show for their 9 months, a wasteful Russia investigation that's going no where.  The liberals have become the low intellect party for how easy they're getting manipulated.
Yea, he's at the average polling levels of Obama.  Not too bad with all the liberal media cannibalizing itself to push it lower.  Turns out Americans just care about the economy, and Trump is bringing the heat.
I hope it continues all the way to the primaries just to showcase that Democrats are focused on "getting" Trump on some conspiracy which hasn't revealed anything since the general.  Meanwhile Trump is focused on tax cuts, infrastructure, and immigration.  What's the Democrat party position going to be in 2018: elect us if you want the government to be focused on 2 more years of investigations into President Trump?  Meanwhile Democrat Senators getting convicted of bribery...lol.   Please keep the investigations going, we need to get more Trumplicans in office and we need Republican and Democrat seats to do it.
Wasn't a defense, just an observation.
You guys realize that's about how much we pay (the 10000 is in Norway's local currency, approx $1300)?  Every man, woman, and child in the US pays approx $1100/yr extra for every illegal immigrant in the USA.

Hey, don't make light of the 6 houses they built.  Maybe they actually cost approx $100 million a piece.  We should give them the benefit of the doubt.
Yea, Red Cross sounds like an administrative bloated waste.  Salvation Army sounds like they use funds more appropriately.
Repeal generally refers to a congressional act or law.  DACA is neither.  The title of the post using the repeal language is probably going to confuse people. 

https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/repeal

Edit: Let me explain why I'm being a stickler on this. The legality of Trump's threatened revocation of the DACA "whatever" is heavily dependent on language, namely what is DACA.  Substantive changes to regulations (may) require a commentary period.  However, DACA does not appear to be a regulation because of the format of the letter (see the memo:  https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/s1-exercising-prosecutorial-discretion-individuals-who-came-to-us-as-children.pdf).  The correct way to define DACA is a policy directive.  Those have very weak legal protections from being altered.
Saw pictures with water completely out, cases of untouched Gatorade sitting right next to the empty shelves.

I think most people buying water are worried about the implications of not following instructions to the letter from Hurricane Wife.
(I'm aligned with the first argument, with only 1 change (at the bottom))

I think based on the court cases cited that there is a high bar to apply the "deference" standard (i.e. bona fide and facially legitimate).  I interpret that to mean they turn a nearly blind eye as long as the President has a potentially valid reason to deny immigration based on current law and that was actually the reason why they were banned ("suggesting that if plaintiff had sufficiently alleged that government denied visa in bad faith, court should inquire whether the government’s stated statutory basis for denying the visa was the actual reason for the denial" pg 50).  I think we could both agree that actual reason Trump is banning them is because he thinks they could be terrorists or are at high risk of becoming terrorists (I'll give you that to what extent they could be terrorists is debatable and potentially negligible.)

In order to survive the challenge the plaintiffs have to essentially prove that there is no political/non-religious component to the ban. If the President's valid reason is the exclusion of the political secular component of Islam (e.g. "radical Islamic terrorists) then it's game over because it meets both requirements.  I think Trump's "extreme vetting" approach to the EO will be read as how you can parse apart the political and apolitical components of Islam. In order to win the argument the plaintiffs will have to argue (with high threshold) that Trump is no interest in stopping the political arm of Islam, only the religious arm of Islam.  I don't think that is possible.

On a side note of why I think the 4th circuit opinion is flawed, what worries me is that in the 4th circuit opinion they never explore what is Islam, political Islam, Islamists, or radical Islamic terrorism which could tie this to current immigration laws.  They seem to basically say: "this is a purely religious test EO, Establishment clause, done." Where is the evidence of the number of Muslims in the United States who would not support the Constitution (important for establishing the reasonableness of the ideological tests)?  The answer is: it's in the footnotes as part of a Trump speech quote (page 19, footnote); but it's never acknowledged or parsed in the actual opinion.  That is a large error.  It may be because this is Judeo-Christian court and they are unfamiliar with the political+nonpolitical mixing of Islam (Christian doesn't provide for a designated political structure, Judaism does somewhat, but not to the level of Islam).  

My prediction is that the SC tells the 4th circuit they erred in not acknowledging and exploring the uncertainty of what someone means when they say "Muslim" and not allowing Trump wide enough scope to parse out that difference with the "vetting".

------

This one:

> Islam ~~is~~ can be interwoven with politics, such that, by definition, it has both a religious and a secular, political component.
> Thus, one could implement a "Muslim ban" because the basis could be the political, secular component of Islam.
> Thus, the Supreme Court should hold that it is a valid ideological restriction on immigration, as opposed to a violation of the Constitution.

In the interests of the United States goes beyond the legal standard necessary, so not the following one. It's basically along the lines of my argument though, that we should respect the Establishment clause by at least making a reasonable attempt to parse out the religious and political arms of Islam; in my opinion the "vetting" would be a reasonable attempt.  Note that Trump has always said "temporary" along the lines of (paraphrasing closely) "until our leaders can figure out what's going on."  I think a reasonable/possible interpretation of "until our leaders can figure out what's going" means how to differentiate the purely religious Muslims versus the Islamist. 

> Blocking immigration of political Islamists is in the interests of the United States.
> Implementing a broad ban on a majority Muslim country can be legal, as it can serve a primary purpose of blocking immigration of political Islamists.
Fpp driving is exhilarating and more difficult.  If you want Mario kart driving then tpp is for you.
So I think we would both agree that sometime in mid 2016 Trump changed from a ban with "Muslim" terminology to territory terminology.  Your argument and what the 4th circuit decided was that based on those pre-mid 2016 statements his statements served a primarily religious exclusionary purpose via the Establishment clause of not condoning a specific religion and therefore failed the good faith clause of the Mandel immigration decision.  The heavily relied on Mandel decision is explained on pg 45 of the 4th circuit ruling.  I think it's also important to note that the courts have not fully spelled out 1st amendment protections regarding immigration so this is ripe for discussion. 

And here is why I think you're wrong:

* Calling Islam a religion is too simplistic as Islam is a complicated religious and non-religious framework intended to act as both a religion and political system, and provides for the implementation of a government and legal system (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism).  Therefore...
* The 4th circuit erred in assuming Trump had no non-religious primary basis for his ban. And the Immigration laws do not allow political Islamists to hide behind the veil of religious liberty just because they happen to also be Muslim (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideological_restrictions_on_naturalization_in_U.S._law#Ideological_requirements_and_the_First_Amendment).  In much the same way I think the Supreme Court will rightfully reference the ability of laws limiting Communists not to fail because those members happened to be atheists. First, Trump has always held important exclusions from the beginning: namely Muslims currently in the US, Muslim athletes, and Muslim politicians, among others ("TRUMP: By the way, it's not total and complete. And it's temporary. Dec 2015", source 2). I don't think anyone argues that Trump would ever ban Muslims who are US citizens, so this is not a "ban on all Muslims"; he's giving a reductionist headline which is not appropriate to interpret literally.  So we have to decide what exactly does he mean when says "ban on all Muslims," and for that we need to look at all the evidence. My argument is that his "ban on Muslims" is a actually a ban on "radical Islamic terror" which is a primarily political class not a religious class.  To succeed in this argument based on Mandel all I need to prove is that Trump's intentions serve a primarily secular goal on its face, namely the exclusion of a secular group.  

To identify to what extent there is a religious versus secular purpose to the ban I think we look again to the 2015,early 2016 evidence.  The first question is if Trump called for a blanket ban on Muslims for being Muslim regardless of their Islamism (secular and non-secular) component.  Since I think we'll both agree that the end 2015 was in his most expansive "ban window" here is a 12 minute interview with Tapper https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKtcdn0zAqw (transcript http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1512/13/sotu.01.html).  A few important points that Trump acknowledges: 1) the ban would be temporary, 2) there will be exclusions, and 3) he is grappling with problem of a certain class ("TRUMP: Jake, we have got to stop the problem. We can talk about it. We can talk about it forever. There's a real problem. And it's called radical Islamic terrorism.")  The fact that Trump has repeatedly and unendlessly referred to the problem as radical Islamic terrorism which argues for a political Islamic distinction and then crafted a future executive order tailored towards the exclusion of that political radical Islamism component makes the high burden of proof required by Mandel fail.  

From Wikipedia about how to define radical Islamism: 
> In Western media usage the term tends to refer to groups who aim to establish a sharia-based Islamic state, often with implication of violent tactics and human rights violations, and has acquired connotations of political extremism.

Immigration law allows for the exclusion of aliens with political extremist views which do not signify a likelihood to adhere to the constitution of the US. "First is the requirement that the applicant be "attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same." 8 U.S.C. § 1427(a) also source 1.

For a new developing game it's important to invest resources in the most valuable parts of the game.  Wasting money improving 3pp which will die soon enough is definitely important to discuss.
They're just using the same argument over and over.  The Pubg tourney was all the evidence you need.  They can live in their fantasy land all they want but the gamemode is a joke casual haven.
Dude, no one takes 3pp seriously. Why is that a problem for you?  Why not just own it?  It's a casual fun mode, but don't pretend 3pp is on the same tier.
Right, I think the economic explanation is that there is a monopoly on supply (due to natural disaster limiting suppliers), and inelastic demand due to necessary supplies.  The fundamental economics are just fundamentals, I don't think there is a different rulebook for poor countries.  For an emergency supply, the time frame for purchase are the same so it doesn't matter if it's a week emergency or a month long emergency.  And talking about a black market being illegal in a corrupt system seems to be not that illegal if the authorities are condoning it illicitly.  I'm sure there is a lot of research that supports that opinion for the developing world, I don't know of any rich country examples.  I'd be glad to look at counter evidence you have.
From Venezuela:

> Dr. Luis Briceño, the hospital’s director, said it was a common situation at his hospital, which is stretched thin. Sometimes his emergency room, with a capacity for 200 people, is packed with 450 patients seeking help.

> “There is always someone who doesn’t receive treatment,” Dr. Briceño said.

> He said medical shortages were so common that patients often had to find and buy their own supplies, like intravenous solutions, though he thought the hospital probably had some the night Kevin arrived.

> But Ms. Lugo said a nurse had told the family to go out and buy the intravenous solution itself. Relatives found it from a black-market seller. The cost — about $4 — was more than they could afford.

Here is an additional source on Obama's comments on DACA.  Here he highlights the program is temporary and not a pathway to citizenship.
The argument has been on here before but the reasoning is:

1) Delay the DACA enforcement for 6 months which will force an immigration vote and realignment of the Republican representatives (more to the right) via the 2018 elections.

2) The president signs DACA reaffirming his soft heart but rule of law campaign pledge.  Further reinforces his 2020 re-election campaign.

3) Republicans+Trump get credit for going across the aisle and fixing immigration when the Democrats failed from 2012-2014.

The argument from intent is a valid one (in terms of Trump being anti Muslim, I don't think it impacts the constitutionality of the EO).  The easiest way to counter is to look at Trump's statements in their entirety.  Most people arguing against the ban due to intent isolate the times he said "Muslim ban" but do not take into account his more lengthy policy explanations and pro Muslim statements.  


Iraq was removed from the ban in exchange for having better vetting procedures.  I think this is evidence supporting his stated intent of banning countries which cannot adequately prevent Muslim extremism migration.
You are placing a lot of weight on the quote below.  However if you are trying to make a judgment of intent then you should take into account additional evidence and judge that evidence in its entirety.  While it's true that the countries on the ban are Muslim, Trump has repeatedly denied being against all Muslims and repeatedly referenced Muslim extremism (see below Middle East speech).  I believe the trap your falling into is reading too much into a quote that was reduced by convenience.  To make the point simplistic, if I go attend an event called "the walk for diabetes", we are expecting a degree of reasonableness in not interpreting that to mean we do not want to expand diabetes across the world.  Instead we are referencing it in its reduced fashion for convenience, not because we are making a policy decision.  That's why I think the quote you provided, when judged across all of Trump's (particularly more lengthy) statements, is being incorrectly interpreted.

Yes
No you started it with your sarcasm.  
1) You don't know how to read your own links.

2) If you don' know how to read your own links I'm not wasting my time giving you more to read.

3) My definition of intellectually challenged is people who cite evidence which actually disproves their argument because they didn't read their own link.  I'm willing to support this argument with actual data provided by your responses.  Is that better?
Your numbers are way off.  I doubt you'll read anything I post here so I would encourage you to explore the data yourself.  You're right they pay some taxes, but that's a simplistic approach.  Look up total net costs.  There are analyses available by multiple groups.  The politifact article is a good place to start.

On a side note, if you're going to talk big game at least know what you're talking about.  It just makes you look childish and trying to compensate for low intelligence by sarcasm and personal attacks.  
At least with your sarcasm we know you are somewhat intellectually challenged so let me break this down.  His immigration policies will easily pay for the wall.  If we're not paying for illegal immigrant health care costs and welfare costs that is a direct wealth transfer from Mexico to USA.  That would also allow us to expand legal merit based immigration which would expand tax base.  Not even taking to account up-and-coming NAFTA negotiations.  

That's how you run a country. Much better than the liberal position of promoting illegal immigration at the expense of legal immigrants, Russian conspiracy theories, and promoting Antifa terrorist groups.
I just want to see the hoarders take the $$$ hit.  I think we're at peak price right now so hoarders are just contributing to our tax base, ha.
Decided to venture out, utsa chevron gas available.  Waited maybe 20 mins because tanker was there.  Maybe 6 cars in line now.
Looks like stuff is opening up.  If the hoarding model is correct, once there is even the hint of easy availability, it immediately cascades to normal or even excess capacity/availability.
I appreciate the backpedaling, but you can't just change the definition of medium to your personal definition.  



Thanks for that, I can see where we disagree. It's a reasonable summary except I would take out "simpler" and change it to "accessible" which is what I think you mean?  Also you should be careful about the definition of medium because you're using it incorrectly, language is a medium of communication (just Google "language medium communication" and there are several references).  Therefore, saying a medium has nothing to do with a medium doesn't really make sense.  

After that, I think you've already convinced yourself here: 

> Use of one standardized language with which to communicate made exchanging and preserving ideas much simpler.

Enjoyed it. Appreciated the discussion, it looks like you're interested in communication theory as well.  See you around reddit :)
I think that's still 101.  
Look it up for yourself.  I'm not going to spoon-feed/teach you information.
I think the counter argument is that the leadership structure is not the same as the other examples you gave.  The normal safeguards for pulling the trigger aren't there in North Korea. That's the conventional opinion on why containment is not viable.
Where did he say that wiretap was different than unmasking?
So you think the economic impact of nuclear war between North Korea and South Korea would have less economic repercussions than a temporary embargo of China.  That's what your argument is.
It's because this sub isn't as heavily curated as the neutral politics sub.  This is just circle jerk, ad hom attacks where people substitute analysis with "stupid", etc.  You should check that sub out.  It's pretty fun.  This is the place I go when I'm drunk, ha.

Over triple the number of unmasking requests and then Rice refuses to testify.  I'm sure Rice catalogs all of her illegal activity with the DOJ.
You haven't provided a flaw, you just said there were "some".  I can't rebut if you're not going to make an argument.
Do all embargoes end in net depressions?
Are you familiar with what I'm talking about?  Your reply makes it seem you don't understand the reference.
You think China is going to choose fallout 3 over the alternatives?
So you're saying the US has never implemented an economic embargo?

This might be useful reading to start to understand that economic sanctions are real.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_sanctions
Sounds like when they debated whether they should write in any other language than Latin for science and philosophy.

Should we get rid of newspaper headlines too? How about titles of books?  
You think China would rather do that than to just take out North Korea?  
You don't understand the choice here: 1) War with North Korea, 2) Accepting North Korea as a nuclear power, 3) Blackmailing China into neutralizing North Korea.

This is an easy and obvious choice.  Your use of the word stupid seems to be a self fulfilling prophecy that's not useful in discussion.
Yes it's crazy that all the instability is causing the stock market to crash.  What's your definition of chaos president because you don't support it with evidence.
So your assertion is that economic embargoes are not useful policy instruments?
What's wrong with using Twitter to push ideas?  Do you think it's too insecure or you just don't like the name (i.e. too informal)?  Do you think it's appropriate to tweet out disaster information during Harvey?

You say that there is something wrong about bluffing.  Any historical data on  that because threats are the lynchpin of any negotiation.  They've been used in every conflict since the beginning of time, why do you think they aren't appropriate here?
Why do you think it's not working?  Would you rather see a military option?  I don't see what your argument is.
Your mistaking negotiations and bluffing with policy.  Threatening to do something is negotiation 101.

I'm fairly certain if we pooled all the gas in San Antonio into 1 big gas station we would have enough gas for everyone.  We have a pump availability problem, we don't have a gas problem.

It's like if you want to buy peanut butter at the grocery store, and it's for sale in aisle 1,2,3, and 4.  Just because there isn't enough peanut butter in aisle 4 doesn't mean there isn't enough peanut butter for everyone and the people who are panicking in aisle 4 because they think there isn't enough peanut butter (and post on fb) are retarded because all they need to do is go to aisle 1-3.

I think where you're getting tripped up is what you mean by "plan."  Cutting regulations and removing subsidies isn't a "plan" in the context you're using it.  Clinton was arguing for government subsidies to manipulate the market in order to push non-coal technologies.

Free market capitalism isn't "no plan," it's the most popular and successful economic philosophy of the modern era.
Instead of just saying supply and demand bla bla bla...going to come at you with some data here:

https://www.minneapolisfed.org/~/media/images/pubs/fedgaz/05-11/gasprices.gif?la=en

Check that out.  Katrina hit 8/29ish, prices jumped, gas supply disruptions, gas dropped off the peak, and returned back down after about 1.5-2 weeks.  

Moral of the story: All those people who filled up their huge gas drums to stockpile probably just wasted a decent amount of money.  I do think completely filling up your primary tank is reasonable ("worth it") given the near term uncertainty and convenience factor.
After this run up, I can't wait for a couple days when the prices drop as no one needs to fill up and gas stations are sitting on inventory.
Any early/late birds in here going to check out the scene in a few hours?  I may target around 3am.
I bet the trucks are coming in early AM too so maybe more stations have gas
Because of lines at 11pm or just not finding any stations with gas?
This is a good point.  If this isn't a gas shortage, then I can't even imagine what a real gas shortage would look like.
I don't even think there is a gas shortage, I think there is a gas pump shortage.  What the mayor should be saying is that there is enough gas in San Antonio for every person to fill up.  Because of the panic people aren't able to distribute themselves normally across space and time which creates these desolation zones of gas (i.e. cross streets of X and X at 5pm) which overwhelms the capacity for gas pumps to put gas into people's cars.  This leads to long lines but not to a lack of gas if you look at San Antonio as a whole.

TL;DR I'm going to go fill up at 3am somewhere.
My plan is just to wake up super early like 3AM and try to get gas.  If there isn't a shortage then that means the gas exists.  I just don't want to wait in the line.
Can we go one weekend without there being a mad dash for items?  Two weekends ago eclipse glasses, last weekend water, this weekend gas.
> Now, it is important to note that law schools (and I believe med schools) are a slightly different matter (at least this is my understanding), since soft factors are barely considered at all except for race. For law schools, LSAT/undergrad GPA = ~90% of admissions, with extraordinary soft factors (i.e., if you've won national recognition in some field) constituting the remaining 10%) with a racial consideration overlaid on top of this entire analysis.

I think the context or allusion of your response mentioning: "edge cases," LSAT/undergrad GPA being the predominant factor in admissions; is that your argument is that the racial (plus) factor is small enough that the "competition" between races is fair, or fair enough to not be statistically significant.  I think we have evidence to ascertain to what extent this is true.

What the opinion and LSAT score distributions scores show me (excerpts/links below): a white person has to be at approximately the 90th percentile to achieve a 50% acceptance rate, while a black person has to be at the 60ish percentile to achieve a 80% acceptance rate.  The Court is not judging whether or not this competition is fair, only that there is a binary competition.  That puts us in a tough position because the Court isn't telling us what is right/fair, only what is legal.  What is legal is not always what is moral. Figuring out whether this is fair enough must be done as a society or by the citizens of Michigan (or by us on reddit). If what you say is true that law schools ignore other soft factors outside of race, then we have to ascribe this performance disparity nearly entirely to the racial component.

My personal opinion is that all mentions of race must be removed from application materials.  You are still allowed to write/explain hardships and diverse life experiences in your application but you can never mention your racial group.  That way we can still include the valuable experiences that diversity brings without making the assumption a person's skin color indicates how much diversity you bring to the table.

From google (LSAT score distributions):
https://wmx-api-production.s3.amazonaws.com/Raw%20Scores.png

From the Grutter opinion:
> Indeed, the very existence of racial discrimination of the type practiced by the Law School may impede the narrowing of the LSAT testing gap. An applicant's LSAT score can improve dramatically with preparation, but such preparation is a cost, and there must be sufficient benefits attached to an improved score to justify additional study. ** Whites scoring between 163 and 167 on the LSAT are routinely rejected by the Law School, and thus whites aspiring to admission at the Law School have every incentive to improve their score to levels above that range. See App. 199 (showing that in 2000, 209 out of 422 white applicants were rejected in this scoring range). Blacks, on the other hand, are nearly guaranteed admission if they score above 155. Id., at 198 (showing that 63 out of 77 black applicants are accepted with LSAT scores above 155). ** As admission prospects approach certainty, there is no incentive for the black applicant to continue to prepare for the LSAT once he is reasonably assured of achieving the requisite score. It is far from certain that the LSAT test-taker's behavior is responsive to the Law School's admissions policies.[Footnote 16] Nevertheless, the possibility remains that this racial discrimination will help fulfill the bigot's prophecy about black underperformance-just as it confirms the conspiracy theorist's belief that "institutional racism" is at fault for every racial disparity in our society.  
Except it was dinosaur 50" D
I agree there could be other reasons, I was just giving the opinion of the authors and through hearsay, Bill Clinton and HRC's strategists.  If you're interested in politics it's an interesting read because HRC doubled down on urban laser beam voter targeting to the exclusion of the suburbs + rural areas because of mathematical modeling (this drove Bill crazy because he thought it was a suicide strategy).

I highlight that decision as the reason they lost because it was their "main" thesis/plan on how to win, because WJC thought it was why they lost, and because I'm heavily weighting the opinion of insiders.

Do you have counter evidence?

> I think that a university's right to consider race as a factor has to tie to their mission to correct for past social injustices 

The Court held this was unconstitutional and not a valid (legal) argument in Bakke (see Powell).

The Court's accepted argument is that affirmative action allows for creating a diverse student body.

(PS: I'm not saying you don't have an argument, I'm just saying what the courts have decided is a legally accepted argument.  I'm totally open to discussing the pros-cons of affirmative action to compensate for past social injustices.)  I've included the relevant paragraphs from the Grutter decision below:

>We last addressed the use of race in public higher education over 25 years ago. In the landmark Bakke case, we reviewed a racial set-aside program that reserved 16 out of 100 seats in a medical school class for members of certain minority groups. 438 U.S. 265 (1978). The decision produced six separate opinions, none of which commanded a majority of the Court. Four Justices would have upheld the program against all attack on the ground that the government can use race to “remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice.” Id., at 325 (joint opinion of Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Four other Justices avoided the constitutional question altogether and struck down the program on statutory grounds. Id., at 408 (opinion of Stevens, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Stewart and Rehnquist, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). Justice Powell provided a fifth vote not only for invalidating the set-aside program, but also for reversing the state court’s injunction against any use of race whatsoever. The only holding for the Court in Bakke was that a “State has a substantial interest that legitimately may be served by a properly devised admissions program involving the competitive consideration of race and ethnic origin.” Id., at 320. Thus, we reversed that part of the lower court’s judgment that enjoined the university “from any consideration of the race of any applicant.” Ibid.

> Since this Court’s splintered decision in Bakke, Justice Powell’s opinion announcing the judgment of the Court has served as the touchstone for constitutional analysis of race-conscious admissions policies. Public and private universities across the Nation have modeled their own admissions programs on Justice Powell’s views on permissible race-conscious policies. See, e.g., Brief for Judith Areen et al. as Amici Curiae 12—13 (law school admissions programs employ “methods designed from and based on Justice Powell’s opinion in Bakke”); Brief for Amherst College et al. as Amici Curiae 27 (“After Bakke, each of the amici (and undoubtedly other selective colleges and universities as well) reviewed their admissions procedures in light of Justice Powell’s opinion … and set sail accordingly”). We therefore discuss Justice Powell’s opinion in some detail.

> Justice Powell began by stating that “[t]he guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of another color. If both are not accorded the same protection, then it is not equal.” Bakke, 438 U.S., at 289—
290. In Justice Powell’s view, when governmental decisions “touch upon an individual’s race or ethnic background, he is entitled to a judicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear on that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest.” Id., at 299. Under this exacting standard, only one of the interests asserted by the university survived Justice Powell’s scrutiny.

> First, Justice Powell rejected an interest in “ ‘reducing the historic deficit of traditionally disfavored minorities in medical schools and in the medical profession’ ” as an unlawful interest in racial balancing. Id., at 306—307. Second, Justice Powell rejected an interest in remedying societal discrimination because such measures would risk placing unnecessary burdens on innocent third parties “who bear no responsibility for whatever harm the beneficiaries of the special admissions program are thought to have suffered.” Id., at 310. Third, Justice Powell rejected an interest in “increasing the number of physicians who will practice in communities currently underserved,” concluding that even if such an interest could be compelling in some circumstances the program under review was not “geared to promote that goal.” Id., at 306, 310.

> Justice Powell approved the university’s use of race to further only one interest: “the attainment of a diverse student body.” Id., at 311. With the important proviso that “constitutional limitations protecting individual rights may not be disregarded,” Justice Powell grounded his analysis in the academic freedom that “long has been viewed as a special concern of the First Amendment.” Id., at 312, 314. Justice Powell emphasized that nothing less than the “ ‘nation’s future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure’ to the ideas and mores of students as diverse as this Nation of many peoples.” Id., at 313 (quoting Keyishian v. Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y., 385 U.S. 589, 603 (1967)). In seeking the “right to select those students who will contribute the most to the ‘robust exchange of ideas,’ ” a university seeks “to achieve a goal that is of paramount importance in the fulfillment of its mission.” 438 U.S., at 313. Both “tradition and experience lend support to the view that the contribution of diversity is substantial.” Ibid.

> Justice Powell was, however, careful to emphasize that in his view race “is only one element in a range of factors a university properly may consider in attaining the goal of a heterogeneous student body.” Id., at 314. For Justice Powell, “[i]t is not an interest in simple ethnic diversity, in which a specified percentage of the student body is in effect guaranteed to be members of selected ethnic groups,” that can justify the use of race. Id., at 315. Rather, “[t]he diversity that furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which racial or ethnic origin is but a single though important element.” Ibid.
I coincidentally think you are also underplaying the race factor of admissions. I think you're also misunderstanding the term "soft" but I'm not sure as you haven't defined it, so could be wrong.  If you're using the definition of "soft" as in the case (meaning not test scores) then that's the definition I'm using as well. The Court is not using it to imply its limited importance (easily confusing point here).

What the Grutter opinion held was that at some point black student A has to "compete" against white student B (for sake of argument since that's what the court was hearing, let's assume black student A has worse scores than white student B). At some point there has to be some situation where student B can overwhelm the racial plus factor enough to win the seat over student A. To your original point, by acting in that narrow sense, the government deferred that fairness of that competition to the "self-determination" rights of the university you mentioned earlier.  The majority did not rule what would constitute fair competition.  What I believe most of America is arguing about today is whether that system is fair or not.

To judge whether that system is fair we need to take into account disparities of test scores (hard factors) and disparities of diversity (soft factors).  Because disparities of diversity (of which Justice Powell said race is not enough) are tough to evaluate/measure I'll concede that diversity is important in admissions but I would also ask you to concede that given the heterogeneity of diversity among racial groups that perhaps a color-blind diversity policy (taking into account the other factors you mentioned) could better accomplish the University's goals. The disparities of test scores I believe is settled fact that minority races are accepted with statistically significant lower test scores.  


> If race were not a factor the proportion of African-Americans would have gone from 35% to 10% based on the evidence presented.

From the Opinion:

> Dr. Stephen Raudenbush, the Law School’s expert, focused on the predicted effect of eliminating race as a factor in the Law School’s admission process. In Dr. Raudenbush’s view, a race-blind admissions system would have a “ ‘very dramatic,’ ” negative effect on underrepresented minority admissions. App. to Pet. for Cert. 223a. He testified that in 2000, 35 percent of underrepresented minority applicants were admitted. Ibid. Dr. Raudenbush predicted that if race were not considered, only 10 percent of those applicants would have been admitted. Ibid. Under this scenario, underrepresented minority students would have comprised 4 percent of the entering class in 2000 instead of the actual figure of 14.5 percent. Ibid.

The context of the Affirmative Action debate for new readers (Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke has heavily influenced affirmative action school policies):

> Justice Powell began by stating that “[t]he guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of another color. If both are not accorded the same protection, then it is not equal.” Bakke, 438 U.S., at 289—

> The idea is that when two candidates are virtually identical in terms of merit, the opening should go to the member of the disenfranchised race

I think you're misreading this opinion.  The difference between Grutter v. Bollinger (succeeded) and Gratz v Bollinger (failed) was that Grutter did not assign "points" to race, Gratz did assign "points" to race.  The Grutter system did not lead to virtually identical identical candidates (see below).  The Court's opinion was that the quickly evaporating basis for affirmative action could still be used on a discretionary (not quantitative basis) regardless if it allowed in two widely disparate candidates on LSAT scores and GPA as long as it was not the predominant factor. 

> In an attempt to quantify the extent to which the Law School actually considers race in making admissions decisions, the parties introduced voluminous evidence at trial. Relying on data obtained from the Law School, petitioner’s expert, Dr. Kinley Larntz, generated and analyzed “admissions grids” for the years in question (1995—2000). These grids show the number of applicants and the number of admittees for all combinations of GPAs and LSAT scores. Dr. Larntz made “ ‘cell-by-cell’ ” comparisons between applicants of different races to determine whether a statistically significant relationship existed between race and admission rates. He concluded that membership in certain minority groups “ ‘is an extremely strong factor in the decision for acceptance,’ ” and that applicants from these minority groups “ ‘are given an extremely large allowance for admission’ ” as compared to applicants who are members of nonfavored groups. Id., at 218a—220a. Dr. Larntz conceded, however, that race is not the predominant factor in the Law School’s admissions calculus. 12 Tr. 11—13 (Feb. 10, 2001).

https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/02-241.ZO.html
Given that this opinion was written in 2003 I think this part of the opinion is telling:

> The Court takes the Law School at its word that it would like nothing better than to find a race-neutral admissions formula and will terminate its use of racial preferences as soon as practicable. The Court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.

What we ~~are~~ should be arguing about today is where we are on that continuum of the Affirmative Action phase out.  If we assign Republicans anti Affirmative Action and Democrats pro affirmative action, then could not Republicans successfully argue that the conditions discussed above have been reached and a phase-out should occur?  Perhaps a more useful discussion would go like this: at what point do Democrats believe the affirmative action program should be phased out because it appears The Court is arguing that it should be (4 Justices now, 3 justices soon, 2 justices potentially never).  It seems that affirmative action as a necessary structure in society is a minority opinion (2 Justices) while affirmative action as something that should be at least phased out relatively quickly is the majority opinion (7 Justices). 
> Democrats win when they play to their strengths

This was considered to be the reason the Democrats lost the 2016 election because they only focused on their base with leverage issues, not on courting independents with policy issues.  That was the premise of the book "Shattered," and why WJC was so angry at HRC's campaign staff, HRC/Mook thought it was too expensive to try and convince people in the center.
It's useful to define what you mean be racism in this post.  If we define racism as the preferential treatment of one person over another person purely based on the color of their skin then affirmative action is by definition "racist."  If we define racism as the preferential treatment of one person over another person purely based on the color of their skin **using a historical average over the last 200 years** then affirmative action is not racist.  

The problem with either narrative is that the African American population is heterogeneous (which makes this historical-average vs no historical-average problem possible) so there are plenty and easy examples of white/hispanic/asian children who have lived in generations of poverty being not let into college because a spot went to a African American whose parents are millionaires, just because his/her skin was dark.  This argument fits perfectly with the meritocracy/self-determination approach of the right (as seen in the immigration agenda): you should be judged on your merits, and we should give preference to those with merit. The left arguing that we should instead use a historical average approach is a debatable point, but too easily criticized to be a viable strategy. The left calling the right racist is seen as myopic and hyperbolic because it does not include the historical averaging versus real-time qualifier.
Damn, my power is out.  No more fun and games now.
I think you're misunderstanding what AMA means.  Maybe you should approach it from a different perspective.....

Nope, awesome in FPP for competitive gaming, trash in 3PP.  Everyone was swearing on their mother that 3PP was the best game mode and had esports potential.  Today we proved that wrong, like I predicted.
> awhile

AKA today (and front page on subreddit), #3PP_logic
Where are all the arguments for 3PP being the competitive mode?  Why so salty now?  I thought 3PP was the best mode??  What changed?? LOL!
Wow, where did all the 3pp defenders go?  It's gotten pretty quiet.  I thought 3pp was competitive? Right?
Sounds like a milk wine home brew in the making
Like not having air conditioning when it's 90 degrees outside?

Definitely agree it's more expensive than water.  Gatorade is not necessary if you're just trying to stay hydrated in normal circumstances.
Why hasn't Trump disavowed the hurricane?
My favorite pictures are the ones with the water stocks empty but several cases of Gatorade sitting next to the empty shelves.  If you're in a crisis situation the electrolytes from Gatorade will be way more helpful than plain water.  
I paid $2/gallon at the gas station for water (and gas incidentally) while filling up b/c of the horror stories I read about HEB right now.  When I drove by HEB Plus! on 1604 the parking lot looked packed. 
We need a grocery water status comment thread.  I thought groceries were out of water.  I just went through all this hunting over SA for eclipse glasses last weekend, now I'm doing it for water this weekend.
What Amazon delivery service is involved with tipping?  Like same-day Prime shipping? 
Why would they try this in California where it doesn't really matter for the presidential race?  My thought is that California is so corrupt what we're seeing is all the down party races taking advantage of the system, fighting fire (fraud) with fire (more fraud) in an attempt to win.
Don't drive in water if you can't see the bottom (or if there is a guy tubing).  
Yea, I'm of this opinion too.  I don't want to buy a house with a location premium because with self driving cars that won't really matter and that premium evaporates.  I'm not sure how far out I need to go to avoid that premium.
It will take full med kit to recover from this burn.
Why are you listening to the sound if you don't like the casters?  Just watch it on mute.  This isn't a debate about the casters.
I liked how Pansy came out and called 3PP for the trash comp mode it is.  I love playing 3PP for giggles, but for a competitive mode, come on.  Anyone who watched those matches saw why it's meaningless.  
Yea, you can get double the heals.  I kind of want to see that now.
It doesn't have to be aggression.  It can be flanking or setting up a hidden defensive position, those are nearly impossible to do with a 3PP.  

I don't think it should become a competition of whose free-look and prone button breaks first.  Move 3PP to casual and keep 1PP for esports.
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/169182662?t=02h54m19s

This is fun?

FYI: This is how Evermore played the 3rd game and won the tournament.  
3PP penalizes movement, just watch the FPP Duo matches tomorrow.  There's a reason why casters were asking spectators to turn off the player cams and just go to the map to put them out of their misery, because 3PP is a joke to watch (and play).  
You can't change the scoring system if you keep 3PP.  If you overweight kills then people just will sit even more than they already do in prone+free-look waiting for blue to push people out of their own prone+free-look.  There won't be an incentive to even try to win.  If you overweight placement then you just heal in the rocks for the whole game and be the overall winner like we saw today.

You only fix this by not having 3PP be a legitimate competitive mode.
You can't play aggressively in 3PP.  Ask anyone who knows anything about competitive shooters gaming.  

I'm glad that 3PP got exposed for the cheap POS it is today. What we learned about 3PP "competitive" today:

* Overall winner got stuck in rocks and healed for half the game, spent the other game healing in the island base.
* You can stay in a shack for the majority of the game and just get cheap 3PP kills to lead the server in kill points.

No one wants to watch that.  We see today why 3PP ranks are meaningless.  Even the casters were getting tired of it and wanted to just have the map view because watching the players was too painful in "3PP mode".

Can't wait for the Duo FPP so you guys can see what PUBG esports will really look like.
I love it that a guy won the tournament by getting stuck in the rocks and healing himself for half of the game.  I was cheering for him.
I think you missed the other 97% of the game.  He was in the shack for 90% of the time, at 1 tree for 5%, and at 1 rock for 5% of the time.  

Actual quote: "With 3rd person you just stay in the shack and hope for the best." 
-1st place

Sounds like competitive to me.  Why not just admit that it's not a viable esports mode and move on?  It's fun, but it's a joke to watch and to play for any competitive game-play.  Does anyone seriously play 3PP beyond beginners?

We listened to the 3PP crowd, saying that it would be awesome gameplay, but it was 1 guy...in a shack...for 97% of the game.  With an ending that was 1 guy standing behind a rock in 3PP mode waiting for the blue to kill him.  Narrative exploded.
I think he was doing it to show how much a joke 3PP is.  The guy with the most kills just sat in a shack the entire game and then at the end, just 3PP a rock until the guy pushed from the blue.  Total waste of time watching.

Can you imagine how exciting that last 1v1 would have been FPP (i.e. you can't just sit behind a rock for 3 minutes for the finale).

I think 3PP dies after this for comp play.
What's the correct way?
Why hasn't anyone interviewed the "white supremacists" to see how they organized this?
Why don't we just refer to ourselves as the anti-Nazi anti-Antifa party or movement?

Woah, woah, chill.  I was just pointing it out, not agreeing with it.  The point was: are Dems going to use that as a sacrificial lamb to say look, "we are doing the same thing as Trump, see how wrong it is?"

I agree that immigration policy is not first amendment policy.  I'm just forecasting where the narrative goes from here.  I can't think of a reason why they would make it sound the same unless they were up to something.
It kind of sounds like they used the language from Trump's EO refugee ban:

* temporary
* 90 day
* let's see what's going on to create failsafe regulations


Any new updates on where to buy?
Look, on the brightside, when you leave things will get better instantly in SA.  :-)
Right, he should just separate it out:

1) Violence: Running over someone in a car is very bad.  Throwing rocks at someone is bad.

Alt-right: -4

Antifa+BLM: -1  


pause....


2) Hate speech content: Hate speech is not who we are as Americans.  I disavow that.

-1 alt right


pause....


3) Hate speech delivery protection: Non-violence and protection of people to say what they want, even if it's hate speech is one of the fundamental protections we have as Americans. While we may not like what people say, that is the price we pay for living in a free nation.

Antifa/BLM: -1

Alt-right: -1
This thread is people conflating two issues: 1) do you have a right to say hate speech and 2) is hate speech worse than violence?  

No one is condoning hate speech.  But protecting all speech is what makes America special. #1 is clearly legal. The second point, #2, is completely arbitrary which is why we have the first amendment.
Here you go: https://youtu.be/PwjjV_p2Yew?t=53
It doesn't really get any stronger or more specific condemnation than that.  Dems are just trying to trigger their base to gear up 2018, I think they're running on some kind of Antifa platform, I have no idea what they stand for now.

I agree with updating labor laws.  
The immigration thread here is actually pretty good in the same subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/6sfwp8/how_much_immigration_do_we_want_and_how_should_we/

My position is: 1) pro merit-based immigration citizenship coupled with 2) a refugee settlement policy that is multinational and based off of likelihood of integration and ability to contribute to the host society. 

Race, religion, age should have nothing to do with it.
The parts that you based your arguments on.  I'm not doing your research for you.   And I'm not really expecting a lot from someone who leads their arguments with: "Whether its constitutional or not is irrelevant," when talking about a judicial review.

I just want to see if you can actually read the opinion and form an opinion on your own since you told me originally to get my facts straight coming in like a big shot.  Let's see those facts, here's your chance.  If you give me something to work with I'll actually put effort into a response.

If you had read the opinion you would see why constitutionality would matter.

So you're putting more weight in the judgement of the Hawaii court than the Supreme Court?  What did you think of the reasoning in the Supreme Court stay opinion for why it's constitutional?
I can agree with pretty much everything you said in principle.  The immigration debate is whether it should be skills based versus unrestricted or what mix of both.  And then to what extent we extend citizenship to those groups.
> the times where he actually called it a muslim ban...
edit: and get your facts straight... the supreme court is going to hear it in oct... that's not the same thing as 'constitutional'....

Read the supreme court decision and then get back to me.  You realize they reversed the lower court ruling and allowed it to go into effect for people without bona fide relationships?  Why do you think they did that if they thought it was a Muslim ban?

The basic way I think of globalism is what it would look like in its extremes: no country borders, all people belonging to one world government.  That is in the extreme but it helps to imagine what pure globalism looks like: free trade, world government, unrestricted migration.

Free trade I think is where globalists and the Trump economic policy relatively align.  Trump is for negotiated trade deals grounded in the basic tenets of free trade (reduction of tariffs) but with the goal of extracting as much wealth from the trading partner due to the USA's dominant economic policy, incidentally using the threat of tariffs.  That is a complicated statement but the threat of tariffs is the only way you can really extract wealth in trade deals.

Globalization seeks to stabilize international affairs by subjecting each government to a central stabilizing power; i.e. WTO, UN, NATO.  This can definitely be a net good as it can serve to spread the costs of enforcing international social norms (e.g. North Korean nuclear policy, international trade disputes).  Trump's policy so far has been that the USA cannot bear a disproportionate financial and military cost of being the muscle behind these international bodies.  You can read about the financial commitments Trump is requiring other nations to make.

The last and most publicized component of globalism is unrestricted migration.  Unfortunately and fortunately, the USA enjoys a position of wealth in a world of heterogeneous wealth.  The question that has to be answered is: should all wealth be redistributed across the people of the world and should people have unrestricted movement across the world.  Most people would answer no.  My argument here borrows from three ideas/principles: 1) tragedy of the commons, 2) maintaining self-determination and 3) capitalism.  To prevent this post from becoming a thesis, basically unrestrained immigration overwhelms the social safety net, prevent social community integration, and socializes the losses of the world to the nations of wealth reducing the incentive for wealth building.

Overall, I believe Trump's strategy is aligned with globalism on the first two points with more of an emphasis on wealth extraction in negotiations to benefit the American worker. He departs from the recent Democrat position of the 2000's regarding immigration (incidentally he is aligned with the Bill Clinton immigration policy of the 1990's) which I believe was changed from the Bill Clinton position by the DNC in order to bribe the Hispanic vote (i.e. we'll give you citizenship if you use it to vote for us). 
Enjoyed your post.

I think your assessment of the first amendment is fair, most of our laws are socially ingrained and we self police fairly well (cops can't be everywhere).  Certainly no right is absolute and as you provided, the limits of your rights are generally when they infringe on others.

On immigration, we could easily expand guest worker permits with neither giving out citizenship nor allowing illegal immigration.  I could give you dozens of examples where Trump says he's for legal immigration.  However the left keeps putting out there that he's anti-immigration because they conflate illegal and legal immigration into just "immigration".  It's what finally made me realize that the Democrats were just out to win at all costs regardless if it was truthful. Republicans have been doing this too with their fiscal conservatism overtures only to pork it up when it came time to rule during GW Bush era. Without penalties for this dishonesty, politics is doomed.

The way I see it, the only issue we fundamentally disagree on in this country is globalism versus nationalism.  The whole racism, bigotry, Russia, disavow etc fanfare is just entertainment, bs that makes people feel like they have an opinion and that they're involved.  But it's just psychological manipulation by the political establishment who realizes that your average American isn't going to sit down and analyze the pros and cons of globalization.

To be fair Trump has come to the center by taking on a leadership role for America in international affairs, which was a worry for globalist champions.

In summary, the real issues are: globalism, climate change policy, immigration, health care.  We have serious issues there with different values and stances.

The fake issues intended for triggering and psychological manipulation are: Russia, racism, immigration conflation between illegal and legal.

"Recent threats targeting Jewish Community Centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week's shooting in Kansas City, remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms," Trump said.

It's disconcerting that the left went from the intellectual party of the 20th century to the conspiracy theory party of the 21st century that completely buys into everything they're told because Democrat politicians know that it's easier to shore up their base than to try and have reasonable arguments intended to convince (sourced from the book Shattered about the HRC campaign).  I think the right went that way early into Obama's presidency but now the left has followed. What happened to reasoned debate and actual arguments?  I've decided to venture into this thread to see what kind of arguments are proffered by the left and I've seen 0 citations of actual sources, several people not even reading posts before responding, and feigned indignation.  The problem is with that kind of ignorance it's hard to convince or be convinced.

If people actually read what Trump has said you can see Trump is not anti-Muslim.  Check out some of my other comments regarding Muslim arguments.  

I'm not sure what the solution is to this general problem with lack of debate ability.

https://twitter.com/nedoliver/status/896386414065188864

Have you ever seen a leader condone neo-Nazis?  Nazi policies are incidentally held to some degree by both the left (economic policies) and the right (nationalism) mainstream groups and other policies are held by the left and right extremist wings. 

We could do more harm than good by mentioning extremist groups who are out for media attention; bringing attention to those groups like the governor and mayor could have done more to publicize those groups than to actually help.  
  
So he should condone the Antifa violence?  I don't think the president should be condoning violence by anyone. Violence is never the answer and all people should be afforded the security to express the 1st amendment rights without threat of physical harm.
> blacks are disproportionately incarcerated for drug crimes

If you see my entire post: do you see how jumping to conclusions makes you seem disingenuous?  I think it's telling that the first 2 pages of your post history do not include any links to evidence or citations.  I'm all for discussion but won't be continuing with people who argue with emotions and without evidence because you've shown yourself to be an ideologue who is more concerned with fundamentalism than an honest debate; I think that my point has been proven.  Good luck. 
White people suffer disproportionately regarding death from drugs: ~~http://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/2010_Treatment_Episode_Data_Set_National/Images/TEDS2010NFig21.gif?w=240~~

edit: https://goo.gl/RacNdR better chart from Kaiser Foundation

So in fact, there is evidence non-blacks suffer disproportionately from drugs.  But it's not that simple is it because blacks are disproportionately incarcerated for drug crimes.  But even that's not that simple because of how drug policy was championed by all races in order to try and cleanup the crack epidemic.  

Do you see how complicated an issue this is and why trying to create policy initiatives exclusive to races may not be the best fix?  Maybe we need policies that are crafted to each situation instead of by skin color?
Gotcha.  I think it makes sense to single out the driver if he is judged competent and was acting maliciously.  I'm not sure how useful it is for Trump to read the naughty and nice list every time there is a violent incident in the US. The Antifa is renowned for its violence so I don't think it should get a pass based on the videos I've seen of the clashes, or its prior history.
There is no evidence that white people don't suffer from economic, drug-related, and education issues.  That's because it's not a race issue and the societal and economic realities are not homogenized across racial groups.  White people are disproportionately affected from opioid related deaths; but it's not appropriate to create a white reparations opioid fund. 

If the goal is better a criminal justice system, economy, and political framework there are much better ways.  Racism (using BLM's system, the KKK, Neo-Nazi, or any other form) is not acceptable in today's society.      
> It's "limp" because he didn't gloss over the fact that both sides were responsible for the violence that was going on at the time of the address

I don't understand what you're saying here.
I'm aware of the Civil Rights movement but the time for treating all minority groups as homogeneous is passed and is an outdated mentality.  What we need now is the current enforcement of all prior Civil Rights laws and refocusing towards policies that target disadvantaged groups of all races.  The 21st century civil rights movement should be based on improving upward mobility from poverty for all races.  Why should we condone racism in any form by acknowledging that we should treat people differently regardless of their circumstances?

For example, how is affirmative action not being harmed by your race?  If you are black coming from a family making $1 million/yr and get preferential treatment for college admissions relative to a white or Asian coming from a family making $10,000/yr, how is that black oppression?

What is your opinion of the disproportionate effect on whites of the opioid epidemic?  Do you think we should craft policies benefiting white people because whites die more often from these types of drugs?
https://twitter.com/nedoliver/status/896386414065188864

Both sides.  That obviously condone fighting and doesn't condone driving a car into protesters.  But if you're trying to say Antifa doesn't use and condone violence I don't think you have any evidence for that.  Is your argument that Antifa doesn't use or condone violence?
What is your definition for BLM movement, we should probably start with that.

Would you consider this racist?:

* End the war on white people.
* Reparations for past and continuing harms.
* Divestment from the institutions that criminalize, cage and harm white people; and investment in the education, health and safety of white people.
* Economic justice for all and a reconstruction of the economy to ensure our communities have collective ownership, not merely access.
* Community control of the laws, institutions and policies that most impact us.
* Independent white political power and white self-determination in all areas of society.

Because that is the BLM policy agenda except with white and black substituted: http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/black-lives-matter-releases-policy-agenda-n620966

I would consider that policy agenda racist because it does not include other groups disproportionately affected by current policies.  A better non-racist policy would seek to reform government without singling out any group based on race.
I'm not sure what your argument is:

> speaking to a room full of white people

Did he prevent black people from attending his rally?  I don't think meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus (http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-black-caucus-idUSKBN16T390) is considered a room full of white people.
> saying their neighborhoods are crap, their lives are crap, what do they have to lose

I think most statistics support that African Americans on average suffer from higher rates of unemployment and crime.  Do you have evidence to suggest otherwise?  Trump's agenda is that by decreasing illegal immigration and increasing workforce participation that this will help African-American communities.  Is your argument that this will negatively affect African-Americans?
Breaking out your points:
> Donald Trump isn't particularly careful or good at moderating his tone and message for broad appeal - he is perhaps the estuary where subversive racist language meets abject racist language

The claim here is that Trump is acting as the gateway for people to espouse racist language.  Trump hasn't prevented or denied someone's 1st amendment rights, which would have to be true in order for the analogy to work.  If the claim is that by the President being a right-wing politician that extremities of the right wing movement feel more powerful to express their already guaranteed rights then I think that is supported.  Trump has disavowed these groups before so if you could provide an example of how he has increased the 1st amendment protections of these groups or decreased the 1st amendment rights of other groups then we could further discuss this point.  

>But his rhetoric has been somewhat consistent in antagonizing and demonizing foreigners (Mexicans and Muslims in particular) is in line with current neo-racist ideology.

I think this a popular misconception with the differentiation between legal and illegal immigration.  Trump is currently working on a skill-based immigration system as seen in multiple other countries (i.e. Canada, UK).  Is your argument that a skill-based immigration system is racist?  Trump has touted that by reducing illegal-immigration that unemployment levels will decrease.  African-Americans are disproportionately affected by unemployment.  Is your argument that the policy is racist towards non-American Africans or just all blacks.

Tl;dr: Calling Trump racist or neo-Nazi is a straw-man argument to prevent the real discussion which is determining whether nationalism is an appropriate governmental philosophy for the current times.  The beauty of the straw man argument is that it makes you feel like you know what you're talking about in a short amount of time, and makes you feel like you have the moral high ground; that's why it's so popular.  But it's not real. The real arguments however are more nuanced: do we have a moral duty to allow illegal immigration and to allow refugees from countries without functional governments and intelligence networks?  Saudi Arabia for instance has been instrumental with intelligence assistance and has a functional government; consequently it wasn't on the ban list.  Case in point is Iraq which initially restricted intelligence sharing and was originally on the ban list, subsequently it increased intelligence sharing and was removed from the ban list (https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/us/politics/travel-ban-muslim-trump.html).  Presumably, the proportion of Muslims in this country didn't change so it's hard to ascribe it to Muslim racism.



>So are you saying you only condemn bigotry hatred and violence from some sides but not all?

Great point! (I'm borrowing it :-) )
> "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides."

How is "strongest possible terms" limp?

Most commonly this tactic is employed as a straw man argument to obfuscate not being able to have a legit policy discussion on nationalism, legal immigration vs open immigration, and capitalism vs socialism.
What policies of Trump are racist?  I think you're confusing racism with nationalism. Politically correct is not the same thing as anti-racist.  Affirmative action is by definition racist, but people consider AA politically correct.
"We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides."

How do you get from that to "didn't condemn?"

So are you saying you only condemn bigotry hatred and violence from some sides but not all?
Conservatism isn't Christian or white.  You're conflating the spectrum of the right with the general principles of the right.  It's the same error as saying Liberalism is Communism.

Trump didn't lend a voice to "these groups," the 1st amendment did, as it does all groups.  What aspect of Trump's policies condones racism?  I thought he tried to court the black vote in 2016?    
The societal acceptance of BLM's tactic of policy arguments engineered to improve only one specific race regardless of economic or societal circumstances makes it difficult for people to rationalize the condemnation of white supremacy movements.  I'm sure in the minds of these white supremacy protesters, they see themselves as balancing by counter-protesting the BLM movement.

We should in fact be condemning all aspects of racial extremism (BLM, white supremacy).

This is perfect advice.  Would you give a random person on the street struggling with drugs some free cocaine, or an alcoholic a free drink?  That's basically what you're doing when your handing out cash to people without doing your homework on what they're actually using it for.

How can a new entrant into the Autopilot space compete with a company that has already amassed an enormous amount translatable road data?  What consumer is going to be a guinea pig for a "dumb" EV when Tesla already has a "smart" EV (i.e. lots of data)?  Will Tesla just eventually control the data and license it out?

She probably has damage to her swallowing function which will cause "aspiration" and liquids pooling around your vocal cords.  That's what causes your voice to be hoarse.  In medical parlance, any lung abnormality related to "aspiration" (food/liquid going down the wrong pipe i.e. trachea) is also called "aspiration pneumonia."  

It's reasonable therefore that she has some kind of illness related to swallowing function and that the "pneumonia" wasn't infectious in the normal sense of how the everyday person thinks of it but pneumonia in the "aspiration pneumonia" category.

Usually the FBI makes a non-public recommendation to the Justice Department.  The Justice Department then announces charges or no charges. By Lynch making that open invitation, Comey felt compelled to make his recommendations public and to offer reasoning for his decision.  

The point of my prior source was that #1) Comey commenting publicly was inappropriate and #2) noting everything that HRC did wrong is not appropriate for someone who is not going to be indicted and consequently doesn't have an opportunity to defend themself.  

Based on the above reasoning the most prudent course of action would have been for Comey to tell Lynch that he recommended no charges and then defer questions to the AG office regardless what Lynch said.
Radiology captchas incoming?
True.  The problem was that Comey decided to insert himself into the void created by Lynch's deferral, when it is assumed to be improper for the FBI to do so.  Whether Lynch should have recused herself is, as you've inferred, is a separate point.

I think this will boil down to a timing issue.  It seems like there is plenty to fire Comey for, but was the timing suspicious.

That's not the way the AG office works.  It doesn't go AG -> FBI Director -> the rest of the Justice department.  The AG doesn't get to name their own surrogate outside of the Justice Department.  There are clear rules regarding who takes over if a prosecutor has a conflict of interest.

I think you're confusing Facebook and Facebook Inc.  Facebook itself is a joke.  You can google the advertising value proposition if you want to and how that ROI proposition is shaping out (it's not).  What you're seeing with Twitter, Snap is the devaluing of the user numbers advertising dollar potential relationship.  The problem is figuring out when that explosion will happen because facebook will be the last casualty.  Twitter will be the first death.  Snapchat will die or be bought.  

I don't know what percentage of Facebook's value is Oculus but investing in Facebook Inc is a risky way of investing in Oculus which by itself has significant competition.

If you have some research that you're basing what you said on I'll gladly take a look.

Yea, Tesla obviously the dud in the group.
Your source was the nytimes which editorialized that intelligence agencies were alarmed.  That's an inference.  So you're not contesting that this happens frequently in presidential campaigns?  Have you read any of the former heads of spy agencies comments about how this is not out of the ordinary?

I'd be happy to continue the discussion but you're not responding to or reading any of the stuff I'm providing.  If you're not interested in a real discussion I'll stop wasting my time.
I'm not disputing that they happened or that they are considered "alarming" by some less-experienced people.  The question was if they were normal.  I think you're granting me the first point that it's normal for foreign leaders to meet with foreign leaders.  Going to the next point (less verifiable) of how often foreign intelligence officials are in contact with campaigns.  Since the rise of the intelligence services they have been trying (and succeeding) to influence/spy on campaign officials.  That is what espionage is; espionage happens.  This is nothing new.  That's why I called it normal (without it being ideal).  

What you really want to be asking is if there was bribery or extortion, not contact.

Look at slide 2   
Source?
Yes.  Campaigning and President-Elects have always had meetings with foreign leaders prior to taking the oath. It seems readily obvious to me that if the Constitution is expecting your branch of government to have a strong grip on foreign relations, able to launch foreign military strikes with allies inside of 24 hours, foreign trade agreements etc... that you would want to talk to the pivotal world players before you move into the White House.

Trump talked about during the campaign how important Russia is in destroying ISIS.  If ISIS is one of your main policy initiatives why would you not want to have a close relationship with the main state which is part of your strategy?

Acceleration on the 0-60 curve is the most common aspect of driving in America.  Are you over 16 because it seems you don't drive a car.  Basically acceleration along the 0-60 is one of the most important performance features of a consumer vehicle.  It describes things that are done commonly in driving such as merging and city driving.  Acceleration on the 60-100 curve is a secondary performance measure useful on highways.

Just ask your parents how often they do the things above.
Except that one category is daily road use.  0-60 is all that matters for mass appeal. No one cares about track performance.  You'll get blown away by a Tesla at a red light, that's what people are buying.  
The other thing you have to keep in mind that the luxury good right now is a Tesla Model S.  No one cares that you drive a BMW/Mercedes/non-Tesla now.  It's like carrying around a Blackberry.  People just look at you and say "have you been under a rock for the past few years?"  Best performance: Tesla @ 2.3s (which is insane). Best for the environment: Tesla.  Best for commuting to work: Tesla.  Best safety profile: Tesla.  

It will dominate any market it wants the moment it's announced.  The only thing holding it back is it can't make enough of them.  

That's where the market valuation is coming from.  
Can someone tell me why we're doing an AMA with this author?  This belongs on some other subreddit. I looked at the title assuming it was going to be some kind of satirical nuanced play on the political theme but after reading the first few lines of the article it's already hyperbolic and out of control.  

Why wouldn't we get someone who is trying to analyze Trump supporters from a neutral mathematical and psychological standpoint if we're going to do an AMA on this?  We're literally doing an AMA with someone who has "rabid" in their article title. 

Is it April 1st already?

edit: I'll ask a question.  OP, based on the mission of this sub, do you think it's appropriate for you to be doing an AMA here?
Put down the camera.  It could be a weapon.
I think this is exactly it.  The whole Russian deflection seems out of place for the Dems.  Normally you would spotlight an issue that simultaneously makes the opposition look bad but make you look good.  I don't see what is in it for the dems to bring the national focus on the Russians. That makes me think this is more of a proactive defensive move to get in front of Obama-gate than it is about going on offense against Trump.
Great point.  The US doesn't even really care, tbh.  The World Cup is just a money making machine for FIFA, which they explicitly recognize.  The world cup cost Brazil $15 billion dollars.  Would rather let some other country line the pockets of FIFA.

This is extreme vetting: http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-trumps-order-on-extreme-vetting-includes-2017-1

The history of the executive order went like this: 
During the campaign Trump made fun of Obama because Obama would telegraph every military move which would allow leaders to escape before our assault.  Trump is shifting from that policy by trying to keep matters of intelligence out of the public realm.  The original executive order was supposed to go into effect 60-90 days after being published.  However this was countered because his advisers though that would allow a wave of people applying in order to get exempted from the system.   

On the face of the EO is an implicit recognition that certain states lack the capability to maintain accurate intelligence about their citizens.  We don't include Saudi Arabia on the "list" because the intelligence divisions of these countries generally don't have a problem giving us basic intel about their citizens.  For the countries that are on the list, their intel is basically garbage.  Extreme vetting is an attempt to recreate that missing intelligence through in-person interviews or through expanding the databases that we use to vet these people.  In cases where people are a total blank slate and the in-person interview is equivocal, that is a really tough question ethically. 

Sweden I think gives us a perfect example of your proposed solution.  Sweden is doing more than the US could ever reasonably do to integrate these refugees.  I agree there is a certain hypervigilence about immigrants and refugees because of the current political climate.  The way I rationalize this is that we morally should admit refugees and immigrants but that it's morally okay if we temporarily suspend this in order to make sure we're doing it as intelligently as possible.
* For your first point:

> id wager that a refugee is a refugee, and an asylum seeker is an asylum seeker regardless of nationality

Current and prior US policy does differentiate based on a myriad of factors.  Prior association with the US is one (historically one factor has association through being an ally or employee assigns special priority).
  https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/refugees-asylum/refugees/united-states-refugee-admissions-program-usrap-consultation-worldwide-processing-priorities

* For your 2nd point regarding france.  I would hardly call France unified in their opinions.  There are significant ideological differences among the population regarding refugees.  

http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/07/11/negative-views-of-minorities-refugees-common-in-eu/

* I don't see the utility in drawing a distinction between successfully completing a terrorist attack and conspiring to commit one.  Our own intelligence agencies are telling us that ISIL is trying to infiltrate refugee flows to foreign countries.  And your statement is certainly note true about refugees plotting to commit terrorist attacks. Part of the fallacy of the "no attacks by refugee" argument is that it assumes that ISIL only wants to recruit refugees.  That is not true.  The point of the argument is that the lack of documentation created by the refugee crisis allows any terrorist (not just refugees) to pose as refugees in order to gain entry.  (1st grade metaphor incoming). Think of the wolf in sheep's clothing children's story.  No attacks have ever been committed by sheep, so why are we worried?  The point is we don't know who are sheep and who are wolves.  After the fact we do, but is that really helpful (i.e. one of the Paris terrorists had a Syrian passport)

* Overall point: I see the points you are trying to make.  In total we can surmise that the current batch of refugees from the Middle East do not integrate well into Western culture, have led to increased violence in the areas where they have settled, have led to increased economic costs, and create long-term vulnerabilities to radical Islam.  These seem to influence countries proportionally to the openness of their borders and how "Western" they are.  There is a moral responsibility to accept asylum seekers and refugees however each country should be able to take all of these factors into consideration when deciding how they are going to approach it.  Note that the American Executive Order is a temporary ban, not an outright ban, and is consistent with other instances of temporary suspensions in order to create a better policy.  

First point: a Canadian refugee would derive additional benefits because of prior nation state agreements.  

I think because of the US-Canadian strategic and cultural relationships we would owe them more to a theoretical Canadian refugee than a Syrian one.  The same reasoning that is based on why we take care of our "own" through welfare, military protection, etc is where this derives from.  Because we are closer allies to Canada, we would treat them more like "our own."   

Second point: Cultural assimilation.  Refugees would ideally go to a country were they could culturally assimilate easier; a place where they spoke Arabic.  A Canadian typically speaks French or English.

Third point: Crime or terrorism is a key concern.  For this point.  Are you saying that Syrians are a low-risk crime population or that ISIS hasn't tried to infiltrate refugee populations?  **If you agree that they are a high-risk population and that they are an ISIS concern, is your point that those risks aren't great enough to outweigh the humanitarian concerns of accepting refugee?**  I think that's a valid argument that is open to debate.  
I converted Kr to USD based on exchange rates from 1 week ago.  The converted USD is what I have listed.

As for your other points regarding the economics and morality of refugees, I personally think that on the spectrum between denouncing the country all the way to hosting the refugees in your home, it is a very difficult decision and tough to make broad generalizations about.  Each refugee population is different, with their own vetting/security, cultural, and economic realities.  

The conversation we're having about Syria is a lot different than if the refugees were coming from Canada.  I think Turkey would say that the conversation they would have about Syrian refugees would also be a lot different than if the refugees were coming from Canada.  
This is a great question because there is so much at stake for very brief interactions.  
Why is it so hard to:

* Figure out how many dead people voted
* Figure out how many illegals voted

Don't we have: a) who is dead, and b) who is not a citizen.  Why can't we just cross-reference, statistics magic, and have a reasonable ball-park number?

My friend and I fact-checked the Sweden stuff last weekend (he's liberal and I'm conservative so we counterbalanced each other, cross-fire style).  Basically refugees can be on unemployment for several years with government stipend.  Average adult refugee unemployed for 8-10 years.  If you are <18 (OR SAY YOU'RE UNDER 18) then you get stipends up to **$200/day** (not straight cash, but value) b/c they pay for room+board plus stipend.  This is what creates the situation of refugee "kids" that are actually 30 years old being in normal family houses that are geared towards taking care of 12 year olds.  

This was the best article, out of anything, that we could find looking at liberal, government, and conservative news sources:
http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/02/19/claim-2015-migrant-crisis-cost-sweden-same-as-14-years-of-defence-budgets/ 

Local Swedish pediatrician talking about how old "kids" are: http://www.thelocal.se/20160903/swedish-pediatrician-some-refugee-children-nearly-40

Edit: $200/day figures were vetted from looking at the articles and then corroborating with Swedish executive statements on what it costs to provide the placement for these "kids," costs varied $200-250/day benefits, and matched the article.  This **does not include pensions** which they qualify for.

In terms of underrepresented person placement and team creation. Does your research argue more for a clustering strategy to give underrepresented people a team/culture similar to themselves in the beginning, or an immersion strategy where the underrepresented are spread out, potentially being the only minority in their stem group?

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2017/02/17/student-lefts-culture-intolereance-creating-new-generation-ofconservatives/

Point 1: Obama+Bush presided over the steady consistent rate of income inequality.  This proved the point that the new right conservative liberalism requires more intelligence than the left pseudo-liberalism.  

If you look at the definition of liberalism in the 2nd article you'll note that they talk about a lot of variation in the term.  Liberalism as defined in the article is basically income equality (this is debatable, but we'll use for sake of argument).  Income inequality has been riding steadily and consistently during the Bush and Obama administrations.  Dems rejected the policy based method of reducing inequality (i.e. Bernie and socialism) arguing instead to continue this tradition under HRC who embraced Obama's doctrine. Meanwhile conservatives rejected the Bush+Obama income inequality doctrine and embraced Trump who promised to reduce income inequality by basically unionizing the American workforce (i.e. bringing jobs back to America via political or economic pressure on corporations or by direct government spending such as infracture).  I can further explain what I mean by unionizing the American workforce if you don't see how income inequality is reduced through Trump's economic nationalism.

Point 2: Intelligence (according to the article) is measured by your ability to resist tribalism and be open to new viewpoints

Did I ever imagine Trump would wave a gay pride flag or keep on key LGBT Obama rights activists, or that he would be able to resist the calls from the evangelical right? No.  That conservative liberalism is coming to define the "right" is something that requires a lot of maturity and "intelligence" to accept or consider.  This is a good strategy because the right has chosen libertarian-ism as its route to "liberalism".  Meanwhile, the left has resorted to political conservatism/xenophobia to advance their "liberalism" (e.g. shutting down Milo, preventing controversial speakers, safe spaces, making emotional appeals) which stands in stark contrast to the OP article which showcased how UNC College Republicans welcomed diverse opinions and fought for free speech.  Liberalism through censorship is a terrible strategy.

As far as the article goes on about monogamy and atheism, I don't think really pertains to our discussion but would happy to explore if you wanted to.
You realize you just proved the point, against your favor, of the second paper in your post?  

I could give you some better guidance or more specific points but you seem to like sweeping generalizations.  I don't want to discourage you from citing papers, because that is a good thing, but it shouldn't substitute for your own critical thinking.  Thanks for the two links though, enjoyed them.  
I'd love to respond but you referenced a piece that encourages homosexuals increasing their proportion in the gene pool and the superiority of homosexuals.  So I'm not sure if you're trolling or you didn't read the article you posted.
My feeling is that all Trump has to do is convince labor leaders and if the economy improves the blue collar vote and minorities will go Trump because there won't be any social issues (besides abortion) remaining that can galvanize a moderate dem voting block.  
How often have you seen a republican president waving a gay pride flag? Or an outspoken conservative media personality being homosexual (and getting shut down by dems, I.e. Milo)?  It's like we're for promoting lgbtq unless you disagree with us, then we're going to silence you. Dems are giving up their title as tolerant ones and I just don't understand why.
It was pretty impressive that the college republican student leader they interviewed was standing up for the right for these people to hand out fliers.  It's crazy to see that republicans are now replacing democrats as the moderate mature party who champions freedom of speech, even from people they disagree with.  I don't really see what democrats are offering anymore unless you champion a socialism centric economic philosophy.  Minority rights, anti poverty programs, religious liberty, and lgbtq have all gone republican.
How much does a primary care visit cost in terms of copay (without getting any labs/xrays, i.e. just to talk about a problem)
So let me get this straight.  You realize you're in the Trump subreddit who has signed several executive orders targeting crime, in the face of democrats who says there isn't a crime problem.  And then you have a problem with his tough stance on radical Islam, which has the most systemic barbaric treatment of women in the world?  And you say allowing the spread of radical Islam here improves or doesn't affect the safety of women?  If what I'm saying doesn't make sense to you it's probably because the stuff you're writing is a lot of words without clear points.  What more can Trump do here?
Your comment doesn't make sense.  Allowing illegal immigration or unvetted refugees doesn't reduce crime against women.
Ladies and gents, this ruling was actually good news, because the 9th completely ducked the EO and set up a straw man to tear down due to not being able to fight the actual order. See below.

The decision went through an intellectual maze to get to the cheese (rotten)

* Point 1: The president never officially amended the order saying that it did not apply to green card holders already in the US
* Point 2: Therefore (as everyone already knows) we have jurisdiction and have to judge the legality of this as it applies to people in/have-been in the US (we have to judge the legality of the original order)
* Point 3: For the people who are in the US you have to follow due-process
* Point 4: Due process was not followed so we are going to deny the motion

Basically, they set up an argument against the original order (that doesn't even exist anymore) to shoot it down.  That they didn't try to shoot down the order as it stands likely means that couldn't justify that type of ruling.  That is good news.

At issue is this: "Does the President have the power to prevent people (caveat: not citizens, not green card holders, not aliens already here) being able to come to the US?"
The answer is yes.  

Instead, the Appeals Court answered the question: "Does the President have the power to prevent people from coming into the US who have already been here and want to come back, or already have a green card?"  The answer is no.  **But we already knew that.**
Welcome to the internet. You must be new here. 
 
Unfortunately it's easier to be douchey than helpful.  It's a never ending battle convincing people to come to the light.
Not on the current house but it would on the next one.
The way I'm thinking about this is Trump is creating a super union of US workers.  Trump forces companies to locate here which creates artificial shortage of manufacturing labor which drives up salaries and makes unions possible again.  

The question is what destroyed unions? Globalisation.  Reverse globalisation and you reverse the degradation of unions.
Looking for a house?  Last question before buying a new construction: "where did the lumber come from?"
Right, I'm not saying we need to artificially change the automated proportion done in a factory, just that we need more factories.  That's what I mean about bringing manufacturing back.
I agree with this 100%.  I have heard similar stories (and tax returns) with the trades being a lucrative path to small business ownership.  Seems like a solid career path where you can make good money early in life.  

Trades got incorrectly demonized during the liberal arts education push in order to push up college rates.  It's swinging back to the trades now.
This is why it's important to bring back manufacturing.  It's true that a lot of manufacturing is automated, but only a certain %.  We'll need a ton of manufacturing to come back but the way I read stuff online is that the workforce is nearly fully "employed" albeit underemployed.  We just need to move people to jobs that they want instead of jobs that are currently available.
I think this is the key policy and point of contention.  The mainstream belief is that some immigration is good.  I'll take a look at your sources.  Before reading them, my thought is I would rather be as selfish as possible and then decide how much charity to give out.  Trying to balance the two in 1 policy can get messy.
I don't understand why trump doesn't match his toughening stance on illegal immigration with an expansion of legal immigration.  It would counter the libs and improve the overall quality of the country.
Don't we want the brains over here?  We should have quotas but then fill it with the best from other countries.  Then sell to those other countries.
What do you think about having merit based immigration? I'd like to get exceptional people from other countries without damaging our own.
Just read the whole thing, a little long, but interesting account of Lafayette.  The part about welcoming those who want to contribute to America (while preventing those who don't support our laws) is at the end.

Given that this in Canada I think we should use the text of the Declaration of Independence which talks more about universal human rights.  The Constitution is more US focused.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

I read a Vox post where 5 different docs got released, the original 7 country terrorist ban was supposed to go into effect in 60 days or something.  It looks like it got upgraded to immediately and green cards, maybe for the reasons you stated.

The other stuff:

1) Revocation of DREAMer

2) Limitation of the fringe benefits of the H1B (work permits for spouse)

3) Require immigrants to prove that they can support themselves before being admitted

OP seems consistent TD poster, not a throwaway account.  
>So it's cool to limit the freedoms of legitimate immigrants from places that Trump doesn't like, but we can't do anything about the attacks from domestic sources? Hm.

Basically yes, if we say citizenship grants you X rights, then if you want to call it less rights for non-citizens or more rights for citizens that's correct.  

>Y'know, there are some people who would say that discrimination against immigrants coming in is a certain kind of radicalism, which means that our inability to actually rein in our batshit crazy leader means we should suffer internationally for electing him, right?

Yes, in a democracy we're responsible for our leader.

>We have a crazy amount of vetting to get people into the U.S.. Depending on where they're coming from, this shit can take years, thousands of dollars, and one single misstep will waste it all and return you to square one. Which is where a lot of people with legitimate green cards currently are, thanks to Fuckface in the Oval Office.

Agreed, it should be streamlined. I would like to see less illegal immigration and more+easier legal immigration.

So basically, at the end of all of this, we agree on everything except if US Citizens should be granted more rights than non-US citizens inside the United States.  If you want to discuss that point then I'm happy to.  But I don't think it's world ending if you fall on the more globalist or nationalist side of that debate.
Besides 9/11, damaging attacks have been perpetrated by people who are US citizens.  However, I don't see a policy way of stopping this without reducing citizen freedoms or without demonizing an entire religious citizen community.  That is unacceptable.  

But what freedoms that are true for citizens are not true for non-citizens, this is the "reward" for citizenship, and what generations of my parents have fought and died for.  That is something that you don't earn by jumping over a fence or filling out an application.  When you do earn it, you take an oath to protect it.

What I hope will happen is that we increase the pressure on other countries that radicalism will not be tolerated and each state bears a reasonable amount of responsibility to prevent its occurence.  We are trying, have tried, regime change in these countries with disastrous consequences, in order to relieve the nation's people from responsibility, the death and destruction, of revolution on their own terms.  This has failed.  

The people of the individual countries must take ownership of their own country and not tolerate radicalism, as a state.  And by the same token, they must be willing to accept the international consequences of decisions their leaders have made, even though they may have to pay for the inaction or decisions of prior generations.  

At the same time we do a reasonable amount of "vetting" of people who are not citizens and consequently do not have the same Constitutional expectation of innonence, but at the same time treat people as people and afford them the universal rights of dignity and respect that all people should have.  
Ok, help me understand.  Are you here legally?  If so, you followed the rules and I would fight to protect your rights here.  Are you concerned that Muslim citizens here are going to be persecuted?  I can only speak for myself but I would be protesting right alongside other people if that ever happened.  

I think you'll find that America is a country of immigrants who acknowledge the importance of diversity.  There are racial/political/ethnic fundamentalists in every country and we have them here but they are the minority, not the majority.  The difficulty arises because people can create strawman arguments out of a bigotry accusation a lot easier than they can a nuanced argument regarding the pros and cons of a legal immigration system's effect on diversity, success of the US, and humanitarian efforts.  The former fits onto paper signs, the latter does not.  Consequently, we have threads about bigotry instead of the real issues. 

We also have ways of combating presidential overreach through Congressional and Judicial means.  Part of that involves trying to convince fellow citizens who may have differing opinions from your own.  There is no convincing happening on this thread as I mentioned in a different comment.  You protest to bring attention to your argument.  But if you have no support or evidence for your argument, then what good does it to do to bring attention to it?
I have no problem with people downvoting.  I think it'll be instructive for the future to see how emotion can cloud judgement and create hysteria among people that let emotion cloud reason.  To support that we have the following observations.  So far on this thread people have put out as facts: 1) Donald Trump made/limited this list because of financial business ties, 2) Muslim mosques are being burned because of bigotry inspired by Trump, 3) None of the 9/11 hijackers came from the countries on the list.  

1) The list was created under the leadership of Obama, not Trump. 

2) The person who made the accusation that mosques were being burned actually linked an article that referenced a mosque that was burned down by a Muslim.

3) This is true but ignores the distinction between state sponsors of terror and terrorists.  Saudi intelligence has helped to prevent instances of terrorism in the United States.  This ban is not directed towards Muslims, this ban is directed towards states that either actively or passively are not stringent enough in establishing the credentials of people in their country.

I think questioning if Saudi Arabia should be on the list would be a legitimate discussion but no one wants to have that discussion because everyone is too busy in their hysteria to have legitimate discussions.  I'm staying on this thread to showcase the political discourse intolerance of the same people who are now claiming bigotry.  If I get downvoted in that process, it only makes my argument stronger.   

  
Did you actually say anything in 2011 or 2015 when this basis for the stuff happened?  Or just now?
if you're a history buff then you'll know where the ban list came from 
Yes, as long as we keep separate in our minds radical extremism and religion we'll be on the right side of history.

We need to apply the same criteria to any radical Christian extremism (i.e. when the planned parenthood debate starts winding up in the us).
That wasn't my question.  I'm trying to show you that Trump didn't make the list.  

However, to your point.  I could see a position that only instances of terrorism on U.S. soil that resulted in U.S. citizen casualties should be considered for terrorist state classification.  Is that your position?
Right, I was just pointing out that you were making the point that there was a new resurgence of bigotry against Muslims, but the only cases you cited was one that was unsolved and one that was perpetrated by a Muslim.  I'm just saying I don't think that is good evidence for your point.  Good evidence would be one that is perpetrated by a non Muslim against a Muslim.
Do you know where the ban list came from? That will answer most of your questions.  I can tell you, but you'll believe it more if you find it.
Keep reading, the Houston one is at the bottom
Alright, so if a majority Muslim country was not on ban list and he didn't have business ties there you would possibly change your position?

>Probably because racists and xenophobes tend to be emboldened by shit like this, which has less to do with terrorism and more to do with discrimination concerning religions the Orange Asshole doesn't like. Said assholes then tend to act out against people they feel superior against. Source: http://time.com/4652725/texas-mosque-fire/

You realize the article you linked references a Houston mosque fire that was ignited by a Muslim right?
Why do you think certain majority Muslim regions were left off the ban list?

I'm not saying that you're wrong, just what evidence do you have? There are a lot of >90% Muslim countries that aren't on the list, which doesn't support the narrative.
What do you mean?  If he's instituting more rigorous checks on the documentation originating from countries with history of terrorism, wouldn't you feel more safe?  I don't know who you are, though.  The only people that would be less "safe" are people here illegally.

Why do you feel less safe?
I heard a npr report that Iran had a line item in their government budget which basically said "terrorism".  Based on my brief review of wahabbism it is a product of the Sauds.  The question is did Iran weaponize it?
Thanks for this.  I like how you're able to explain the difference between state funding of terror and non-state actors that happen to be from Saudi Arabia.

I enjoy both and advocate supporting both (excluding cucks).  But for the love of god, never go to the movie theater thirsty or hungry, otherwise you'll never have enough money to send your kids to college.

in his early policy speeches he says "illegal immigrants." I have yet to find one example where he says "immigrants" are doing anything bad.  It's always "illegals."  He has said multiple times that he loves "legal immigrants." The problem is that love of "legal immigrants" by the right don't fit the liberal narrative.

The legal vs illegal-immigrant Trump stance litmus test is how I decide to take a liberal argument/discussion seriously.  If they lump all immigrants together then I know they've been brainwashed and haven't tried to do any research on their own.  If they don't lump them all together then I know that at least we can have an intelligent policy discussion.
Two points were made during interview:

* Teaching math should take priority: I thought this was Tucker's only good (secondary) point.  Why focus on teaching about the danger of fake news when your math comprehension is 20%.  I thought this was too straw man for me.  This was first interview where I thought Tucker was pushing it too far just to argue.
* Fake news: I'm all about preventing the brainwashing of American youth and riding the Trump train, however I want the movement to be legit and not another SJW circlejerk. I thought Tucker was trying to make too much out of this guy's bill. Basically the guy was saying that he wanted the youth of CA to know to check footnotes, references on news reports regardless of who the news outlet is.  Isn't that what this subreddit is all about, taking every report with a grain of salt and verifying?  I actually agree with Gomez on this one, I don't see a problem with the fundamentals of the bill.
>Trump’s Presidential Inaugural Committee has raised a record $90 million-plus in private donations, far more than President Barack Obama’s two inaugural committees. They collected $55 million in 2009 and $43 million in 2013, and had some left over on the first go-round.

> But the president-elect has raised a record breaking-amount for the festivities of his momentous day — in fact, he’s **raised more than President Obama’s two inaugurations combined**.

55+43 = 98

90 = 90

98 > 90

Math?
> wind farms

This takes like 5 seconds to debunk. He doesn't hate wind farms.  He didn't like a Scottish wind farm that would disrupt the view from his golf course.  Just because I don't like kids playing in my backyard doesn't mean I'm anti-kid.

i think you're confusing the terms corroboration and evidence
I would love to help but Obama said that the Russians control everything so why are we even trying?
Lpt: airlines generally give a decent amount of flexibility rescheduling and canceling your tickets around snow storms.  I usually book several southwest tickets on the day itinerary to hold my seat in case they start canceling flights.

This is also how I ended up volunteering for two different flights at two different gates at the same time.
Can you enlighten us how you decided that number?
If you read Trump's stuff and listen to his interviews, it's not a full ban. 
I've actually had this thesis a while too.  The only thing I'd add (and that will answer some of the critics you have below), autopilot will not only improve life for the ev users, most traffic is man-made, autopilot will also significantly decrease traffic so the market saturation you need to hit is not that high.
Hello fellow vde bottom picker, pretty fun ride eh?
If your friend is that intolerant, is it a friend worth having?
Yeah, what if they had families here and had been here for years? Are we really going to go around and round up these Russians. Obama called all Russians anti-american hackers.

Guys, how is this Obama deportation force meme not catching on more?

most of the liberals I talk to think that Trump is dangerous for the country, mainly because they think he is unpredictable and the "bigot" "racist" "war-mongerer" has been a long-standing battle cry for the left.  When Bush was running he was willing to concede those labels because he was going for the evangelicals.  Trump started pretty left of the evangelicals and then continued moving left, basically conceding the evangelical agenda as a state's right issue, putting the onus on the Supreme Court which absolves him of having to push any direct executive evangelical agenda, and directly appealing to the black and Hispanic voter.  Instead of appealing to the whites via evangelical issues, he appealed to them through immigration and economic paths.  The only real counter to that was through the Bernie approach of socialism which the left rejected.  The left embraced an out-dated strategy that has left Trumpland kind of dumb-founded because how do we argue with people who say Trump is anti-Hispanic and anti-AA when he tried to court that voting block.  That confusion will eventually resolve itself in our favor for the reasons you mentioned, namely rebuilding cities starting with entry-level manufacturing jobs and infrastructure projects.  The fad of calling Trump supporters racists and bigots will blow over.  The real battle in 3 years will be a watered down socialism (Bernie 2.0) with the left pushing more subsidized health coverage and probably some sort of universal basic income.  I think Trump is so far left on social issues (because of his pushing issues to the states stance) that the left can't fight him there.  We just have to sit tight, and wait for the results to speak for themselves.  The left are just making themselves look ignorant and childish, which is something that they have successfully labeled the right with for years; the tides are reversing. 
How is a graph showing near 30 year PE lows support for your argument?  Is your argument that the slope is positive?
Yea, I feel like Trump just has to walk it over the goal line with Hispanics or African Americans and the entire Liberal narrative evaporates.  All that remains is the sore loser, manipulative group that was exposed after the election on Facebook and MSM.  I used to think that the liberals were the balanced contemplative group and that I was taking a chance on Trump's more aggressive style.  Now I think Trump was actually the safe choice.
yea, I don't see why all the hate on HTC.  USPS is so bad.  When I tried to refuse delivery of a battery, the lady looked at the package trying to figure out if I'd opened it, like she was some kind of Perry Mason.  She tried to eye me like she could peer into my soul and see if I was lying.  I just looked at her weird and was like, "I didn't open it.  Can you give me proof of refusal?"  "No, sorry, I can't."  USPS is so ghetto.  Even though UPS or FedEx can be a little more expensive, I refuse to support any agency that is that unprofessional.  
I thought your CNN article seemed fairly reasonable. 
I think Al-Assad rejected the Qatari pipeline but supported the pipeline on the Iranian side right?

http://www.politico.eu/article/why-the-arabs-dont-want-us-in-syria-mideast-conflict-oil-intervention/
What's the source for it being a false argument?

I think the question is whether there is 1 argument or many arguments.  I've been trying to tease apart this argument which is almost 17 pages (below link) and makes the argument that the pipeline argument was a proxy for the the Sunni-Shia, Russia vs USA, secular vs Islam government conflicts.

http://www.politico.eu/article/why-the-arabs-dont-want-us-in-syria-mideast-conflict-oil-intervention/

What we need to figure out is if like you said, the dates don't match up or if the dates are close enough to be possible, realizing that sometimes official statement may lag actual decisions by weeks/months.

Facebook is in big decline.  Talk to any teenager.  Facebook is becoming the old folks home, once it reaches the impending tipping point it falls off cliff.  It's the beauty and beast of social media. Facebook is easy short.

That's fine if you have a different opinion on globalism versus nationalism.  It's just cheap when people reduce the argument to tabloid sensationalism because they can't handle that the country chose an antiglobalism direction for the next 4 years. 
What policy absence?  I'll provide an example of one if you say one that is lacking.  
I wouldn't say look the other way, I would say look up.  This election was about globalism, not about the apprentice, trump university, etc.  You can argue about those things but it's meaningless.  People argue about those things because it's easy and they can act like experts by reading 1 tmz interview.  Understanding the globalism debate requires effort.  The faster we realize that the faster we respect each other and realize what decisions we're actually making.

Yea, should we get this on the 2018 ballot for swing states?  It would be easier to do for PA, NC, MI, WI, OH, FL, VA than to hit all the states.

I thought I read somewhere that 3 million undocumented people voted.  It would fix voter fraud and illegals voting.
If only we could convince them the election was rigged so we could have them push voter ID.
Yes.  I've found the following works well to explain the electoral college, which is sad that people don't understand the concept behind it: When our country was founded we had 2 parts of congress.  One with the senators to protect the small states, and one with the representatives to protect the big states.  Since we can only have 1 president, we added each states senators to their representatives so we protected the little states a bit and the big states a bit.  

I feel like I'm explaining it to a 3 year old but it is literally the only way I can explain the rationale behind the EC to people.
The best was when Roger Stone was trying to listen to Trump speak during the acceptance speech and Alex is just talking the entire time. 
No way he puts this in the White House.
And they didn't vote.  Their owners voted.  Terminal retard.

Dem policy was all about quid pro quo with illegal immigrants: we'll look the other way if you vote for us.

I think Assange is giving opportunity for fbi to handle.  It must be so significant that even Assange doesn't want blood on his hands.
I think this supports fbi anon about it being unrelated case (i.e. Clinton foundation).  Wikileaks probably thought the emails so damaging (as fbi anon said) that they are giving the opportunity to the fbi to handle.  If it is true government scale corruption, Wikileaks wouldn't want to be held responsible for riots or wars.  Assange basically told fbi you have a chance to do this right and redeem yourself, otherwise I'm releasing.
Remember from fbi anon, the emails are basically peanuts when it comes to the foundation.

No, they are homogeneous which makes them ideal for novice users.  At the top end of users it doesn't make a difference but things like tethering, streaming movies, file sharing can be done out of the box which makes power user lives easier. 
This is why I tell family members if you just want a phone then iPhone vs Android doesn't really make a diff.  If they're relatively low tech I recommend that they get an iPhone because I think added functionality comes at a cost of increased confusion (i.e. think manual vs automatic car). Where Android shines is the open file system: books, movies etc.  It's a hard drive with a screen, unbeatable.

Agreed, I don't know about the specifics, but that sounds like tax refusal.  That is an appropriate example of when not paying taxes is bad.  

I'm fine with calling people out on their faults but I just want it to be called straight.
Psychologically I think this thread is interesting because there's only 1 amount of taxes that is mandated.  It's not like the irs has a suggested amount and a minimum amount.  I wonder if people are applying some kind of tipping philosophy, or it's coming from Christian tithing philosophy. 

Make no mistake.  Trump should be held accountable if he refuses taxes, but the amount of hyperbole and fundamental misunderstanding of taxes in the comments is troubling.
The argument (made by Sanders and Trump) is that if it's only reasonably possible with a lot of lawyers then it's not practical for your average person.  But I agree with what you're saying.
I can't believe I'm the first person to mention this (I read all top level comments).  There's a difference between avoiding taxes and refusing to pay taxes.  "Avoiding" taxes is legal (and a fiduciary responsibility for public companies). "Refusing" to pay taxes is illegal.  Just because it's hard to figure out how to avoid taxes doesn't make it immoral. Trump is saying he's avoiding taxes which is what the vast majority of wealthy individuals do.  You guys are hating the player instead of the game.  Don't conflate "avoiding" and "refusing."
yes, the media has cried wolf so many times it's actually working in trump's favor now
I think you're making the stiff->rigidity assumption which I would agree with is not being correct.  I'm using the stiffness -> freeze connection which would fit with the video.  
Hey I was with you until yesterday's thing.  I'm probably not being forthcoming enough with how significant that video is.  There are so many pieces to unpack but I think I've communicated my opinion enough.  Let's just wait and find out.
Diagnosing Parkinson's is hard even when you have all the information. You don't really know until after starting treatment. I'm not diagnosing, I'm predicting on the evidence we have.

Water in your lungs isn't pneumonia.  Cancer patients can get water in their lungs though.  
Would be happy to add citations if there was something you disagree with or I could offer counter argument.  What's your opinion of what's going on?  Sounds like you're convinced she fainted.  Is her behavior in the video and that of the secret service look like how you deal with someone who is dehydrated?


Yes, I've been really looking into the video of him talking to HRC in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azUpfzDNxpw and trying my best to analyze what's going on here.  I think in a few months after we know for sure what's going on, people will look back and point to this video in retrospect as an early tell of her disease.  I think the freeze she is having in that video is a Parkinson's freeze which is caused by sudden unexpected stimulus (protestor/disruption in the crowd).  What is most interesting is HRC face and Okunola's words (it's really the only time we get a chance to see their interaction during an episode).  I think she has a momentary freeze and he is trying to "cue" her or help her out of it with "keep talking."  Once he does that she goes completely back to normal.       
Hi, vascular dementia is an umbrella term for basically disease of the vessels in the brain.  Depending on where the disease is in the brain you will get different symptoms.  You can have a problem 1mm away in the brain and have completely different symptoms.  

While vascular dementia can cause multiple problems: movement, swallowing (putting you at risk for aspiration pneumonia), and the ability to think, they aren't reversible and don't get better and worse (cognitive could be an exception but this is really complicated).  We can see something is obviously wrong with HRC but what is most striking to me is there is such a difference between her "good" and "bad" hours/days.  Sometimes she looks completely normal and sometimes she seems to have significant problems.  Having that kind of distinction would support a more complicated disorder like Parkinson's or Alzheimer's.
Aspiration pneumonia occurs **more often** in Parkinson's patients who are typically bed bound.  

Facts:

* Problems with swallowing can be an initial symptom of Parkinson's.  
* A common cause of chronic cough is aspiration from problems with swallowing.
* HRC has had a coughing problem lately.

This link is helpful: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3740808/
> Parkinson's patients who die from aspiration pneumonia are advanced enough to where they're typically bed bound.

The qualifier you're putting on this is "who die from aspiration pneumonia." I'm not suggesting HRC is going to die, just that this is one common way for Parkinson's patients to have pneumonia that doesn't involve looking sick in the conventional way (i.e. inflammatory pneumonitis) that we think about pneumonia.     

> Orthostatic hypotension is just that, it's a blood pressure change due to change in position. You don't become orthostatically hypotensive by standing for long periods of time.

The reason the blood pressure changes with position is because of either a) autonomic problems or b) dehydration/blood-loss.  It's the first thing you'll experience when you start to get dehydrated. The statement from HRC was that she was experiencing dizziness/orthostasis (symptom) because of dehydration (reason).  People with Parkinson's can be exquisitely sensitive to this effect because of their lack of ability to make sure enough blood is getting to the brain.

> Parkinson's patients movement abnormalities are not associated with seizure-like movements.

I was putting the "seizure" in quotation marks to reference what the popular opinion is and to contrast it with the Parkinson's theory. Freezing is absolutely a Parkinson's symptom.

> I don't understand what you're talking about with chronicity and having episodes.

She has had modifications made to her vehicles, people propping her up during speeches, multiple falls.  I'm using that as the basis for the argument that this is not a short-term problem, instead a long-term.
The discussion for the glasses being for post-concussion problems seems reasonable.
I could see the reasoning behind that but difficulty swallowing which is the risk factor for aspiration pneumonia is one of the early signs of Parkinson's which the patient may not even recognize.

http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353802003000452
Thanks.  Not sure on first point.  On second point, Parkinson's is variable in how hard it hits and when it hits.  And just because you have it doesn't mean you can't be 100% functional early on in the disease and sometimes for a long period of time in the middle of the disease.  Can you imagine trying to convince yourself that you were going to give up the presidency when you were feeling awesome because of the possibility you may get worse during your term. It's conceivable that she decided a few years back that it was doing okay and decided to go for it.  Now she's in the situation where it's hit her too hard to function but it's too late to go back. 

Any West Wing fans in here could liken it to the series premise where the president had MS.  The discussions of MS and Parkinson's would have very similar story lines because of the variability of their effects and the seriousness of the condition.
The only ones that are documented are the clots she had in her brain, her concussion, and her thyroid problem.  Her clots resolved, she's on blood thinners, and she's being treated for her thyroid problem.  I don't see any residual concussion symptoms or possibility this is from her thyroid disease.  Short answer would be: no.
I can cite sources if you want but you can't diagnose Parkinson's except with in-depth medical information and even then it's very hard.  Just doing the best I can :-)
No one else I know of has said that her fall today and her dramatic recovery, was a result of Parkinson's.
Polio and back pain don't affect your thinking processes.  What she has (Parkinson's) does.
>you have no idea what a parkinson's patient looks like apparently.   /u/angry_cucumber

RemindMe! 30 days

You would be surpised then
The Parkinson's (maybe even Parkinson's plus syndrome) theory actually has pretty good merit after the latest episode.  This is mostly a medical discussion argument, but I wanted to distill down the pure fundamentals of the argument, regardless of who the person is.  What follows is a purely objective discussion based on medical facts in the context of the video we have of HRC:

First Parkinson's is a disease affecting your motor/movement processes.  Look it up online to see complete explanations or videos.

* "Coughing spells": Parkinson's patients die from aspiration pneumonia because they lose movement coordination of their esophagus.  Most Parkinson's patients suffer from "aspiration" (stuff going down the airway) to some degree.  Think of having reflux all of the time and that hanging out around your airway.  Aspiration is one of the most common causes of chronic cough.   (for fact checkers: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3740808/) . I think it's true that HRC has pneumonia but it's probably aspiration pneumonia or infection related to aspiration pneumonia, not your everyday pneumonia.  That she was allowed to walk around later today hugging kids and that she didn't look visibly sick supports this.  You could hang around people with aspiration inflammatory pneumonia without infecting them, you CAN'T hang around people with infectious common pneumonia.  People don't rebound for infectious pneumonia in a few hours (more on this further down).  
* "Weakness": I think this is autonomic dysfunction. This is where I differ from other people and I haven't seen this brought up by others.  Parkinson's also affects your ability to maintain normal blood pressure and can give you orthostatic hypotension (you stand up and can't maintain blood pressure to your brain, which leads to confusion and essentially passing out).  I think today's episode is our first and most dramatic support for this Parkinson's autonomic dysfunction effect.  That she was able to rebound so quickly is also in support because orthostatic hypotension related to Parkinson's is intermittent and can be rectified/treated.  Sometimes you can just run a high blood pressure to help with this but she's on blood thinners and any doctor wouldn't want to run her at a high blood pressure because of risk of hemorrhage into the brain; if she was on blood thinners then bleeding into the brain would be catastrophic.
* "Seizures": I think these are movement disorders. Plenty of people have chalked this up to seizures but she doesn't really have the normal confusion after seizure, I think there is something less dramatic going on.  The types of movement abnormalities she's demonstrated would be more in line with Parkinson's which you're not going to have residual deficits for.  When you watch the video of her getting into the motorcade you have to ask yourself if she looks stiff or if she just looks wobbly.  Stiffness would be more consistent with Parkinson's, wobbly would be more consistent with autonomic dysfunction argument (#2).  I think she looks more stiff.  Additionally the first thing you want to do with someone who is lightheaded is to let them sit down; leaving her to stand up the entire time would be unusual.
* Chronicity: Treated Parkinson's patients steadily decline and then start a rapid decline after years of treatments.  I think we are just starting on the rapid decline.  That she is having vehicle modifications and that her staff seem so coordinated in dealing with her episodes makes me think this is not a new thing.  This would support a more chronic disease process.  
* Avoiding public appearances: Treatment of Parkinson's involves an ebb-and-flow of being functional and non-functional.  Using medication you can ramp yourself up for special events to make yourself functional but you can't do this for a prolonged period of time successfully. One of things that can happen is what's called a Parkinson's freeze.  Coincidentally people have talked about Hillary Clinton "freezing up," but not in this context. See here (look under common triggers): http://movementdisorders.ufhealth.org/2011/11/23/physical-therapy-tips-for-freezing-of-gait/
* Wikileaks October Surprise: A simple email to/from any friend, relative, or doctor that looks into Parkinson's treatment; a medical record; anything that mentions Parkinson's and she's done.  It would take 1 email from her doctor to slip through the cracks and her presidential career would be over.  

tl;dr I think HRC has Parkinson's and what we saw today is just a gradually worsening manifestation of her disease (see autonomic dysfunction under "Weakness").
The Parkinson's (maybe even Parkinson's plus syndrome) theory actually has pretty good merit and I'm glad you posted it.  This is mostly a medical discussion argument, but I wanted to distill down the pure fundamentals of the argument, regardless of who the person is.  What follows is a purely objective discussion based on medical facts in the context of the video we have of HRC:

First Parkinson's is a disease affecting your motor/movement processes.  Look it up online to see complete explanations or videos.

* "Coughing spells": Parkinson's patients die from aspiration pneumonia because they lose movement coordination of their esophagus.  Think of having reflux all of the time and that hanging out around your airway.  I think it's true that HRC has pneumonia but it's probably aspiration pneumonia or infection related to aspiration pneumonia, not your everyday pneumonia.  That she was allowed to walk around later today hugging kids and that she didn't look visibly sick supports this.  You could hang around people with aspiration inflammatory pneumonia without infecting them, you CAN'T hang around people.  People don't rebound for infectious pneumonia in a few hours (more on this further down). 
* "Weakness": I think this is autonomic dysfunction. This is where I differ from other people and I haven't seen this brought up by others.  Parkinson's also affects your ability to maintain normal blood pressure and can give you orthostatic hypotension (you stand up and can't maintain blood pressure to your brain, which leads to confusion and essentially passing out).  I think today's episode is our first support for this Parkinson's autonomic dysfunction effect.  That she was able to rebound so quickly is also in support because orthostatic hypotension related to Parkinson's is intermittent and can be rectified/treated.  Sometimes you can just run a high blood pressure to help with this but she's on blood thinners and any doctor wouldn't want to run her at a high blood pressure because of risk of hemorrhage into the brain; if she was on blood thinners then bleeding into the brain would be catastrophic.
* "Seizures": I think these are movement disorders. Plenty of people have chalked this up to seizures but she doesn't really have the normal confusion after seizure, I think there is something less dramatic going on.  The types of movement abnormalities she's demonstrated would be more in line with Parkinson's which you're not going to have residual deficits for.
* Chronicity: Treated Parkinson's patients steadily decline and then start a rapid decline after years of treatments.  I think we are just starting on the rapid decline.  That she is having vehicle modifications and that her staff seem so coordinated in dealing with her episodes makes me think this is not a new thing.  This would support a more chronic disease process.  
* Avoiding public appearances: Treatment of Parkinson's involves an ebb-and-flow of being functional and non-functional.  Using medication you can ramp yourself up for special events to make yourself functional but you can't do this for a prolonged period of time successfully.
* Wikileaks October Surprise: A simple email to/from any friend, relative, or doctor that looks into Parkinson's treatment; a medical record; anything that mentions Parkinson's and she's done.  It would take 1 email from her doctor to slip through the cracks and her presidential career would be over.  

tl;dr I think HRC has Parkinson's and what we saw today is just a gradually worsening manifestation of her disease (see autonomic dysfunction).

It's the same thing as:  oh my boss is a child molester but I really need this job so I never told anyone.  Some things are bigger than just you.  If you read his clarification he basically addresses this exact point.

At least with Trump he's a guy whose motive is to maximize his "winning" legacy which will be measured by how great America is economically in 2020.  With Clinton what is her goal: more money for Clinton foundation? power? payoffs for her friends?  My guess is that average American economic success doesn't even make her top 5.  I don't see how Democrats can support such open-faced corruption.  It should be either Bernie "spread the wealth" Sanders, or Donald "America Inc" Trump.  

The Democrats once considered themselves the sophisticated party.  Now the Democratic party is just a few delegates away from being the party of corruption and incompetence.
I think this is a more non-South viewpoint/opinion.  You can't actually pass authority to the federal government except through Constitutional amendments or SCOTUS interpretation.  A state can permit/delegate certain things to the federal government but as we've seen with Obamacare that power can be quickly returned to the states.  Power which can be quickly removed is not real power.  The Constitution neutered the federal government and since we haven't had any amendments to change that balance of power the states ultimately retain significant power.

The U.S. Constitution uses terms pass and approve fairly liberally with regards to laws and bills.  Congress doesn't sign a bill but a president can pass a bill if you are using it under it's "approval" meaning. 

For example, in section 9 it says no ex post facto law shall be passed.  Since congress can't really pass a law then it's hard to make sense of it unless the president can be part of its passing.
The president must sign a bill in order for it to become law so saying he passes a bill is correct. 


>Bills passed by the legislature usually require the approval of the executive such as the monarch, president, or governor to become law

No, he said had he known he needed to buy two seats he would have.  He didn't try to buy two seats ahead of time.
The airlines need to either compensate someone already on the airplane to allow spillage of the overweight passenger or the overweight passenger needs to buy two seats.  If you're overweight and need 2 seats, then you need to make that determination ahead of time.  Don't hope for an empty seat next to you and then ask to buy once you're already there, because by then the seats have already been assigned.

The other passenger was right to hold his ground.  He bought something and deserves to have it.  If the airlines wants to deprive him of seat space because they didn't manage bookings appropriately then they should compensate him.  I've been offered $$$ to sit next to overweight people before and it hasn't been an issue.

You said your flight was in a week.  If I were you and I was really worried about it, I would just check on the app around the time when I expect to arrive in a week.  All you need to do is move your pickup location to RDU and it will show you availability.  If you see nothing available either of the two days then I would schedule something.  If you see multiple cars then you don't have anything to worry about.  
I take Uber or Lyft frequently since the days when they would have to drop me off in the airport parking lot.  I've found Uber/Lyft coverage to be spotty right around 4-5am going to the airport and then after 1am when going back from the airport.  If you're arriving during normal airport times then you'll be fine.

I pay $20 for Uber and would pay $35-40 for taxis.  I would rather walk than use a taxi now (50% kidding).

The first line of the article:

> Donald Trump is likely on the verge of losing the Republican primary.

Starting off your first sentence being factually inaccurate ("losing") saves me the trouble of reading any further.  "Losing" the primary is the same as a soccer team "losing" a match with a score of 0-0.  I enjoy reading thoughtful opinion pieces but really, the author can't even keep it together further than the 9th word.

Your lack of evidence probably indicates you don't understand ESEA.  Let me explain for you:

Scenario A: I play aggressive YOLO style and we lose 16-14.  14*100 = 1400 RWS points avail split among the team.

Scenario B: I play smart and we win 16-10.  16*100=1600 RWS points avail split among the team.

Once you've got a several round lead (i.e. you're going to win the match) there is no reason to not frag-hunt if it maximizes your round score. There's no reason to be anything other than an entry-fragger in ESEA. Because there's no real penalty for losing rounds RWS is broken which is why ESEA just fixed it. I think ESEA is the best service out there, this was a huge upgrade. Do you see why you're wrong yet?
all you have to do is play super aggressive.  If you die then your team will probably lose the round and it doesn't affect your rws.  If you get a kill then you're more likely to win the round.  I can lose the team the match but still win the rws race.  Makes no sense.
You mean I can't Yolo rush on anti-eco rounds to get easy 4ks and dominate rws anymore?
The Republican view is a combination of a **social values perspective** and a **government theory**.  Conservatism could be thought as a strict interpretation of the Bible (social values) and strict interpretation of the Constitution (government theory). 

**Social values**: Most aligned with a Protestant religious perspective coupled with a: if it ain't broke don't fix it conservativsm philosophy.  Christianity places a high premium on protecting life and there is an underlying distrust of human interpretations of when life begins, or changing the definition of when life beings.  It's entirely conceivable that if Republicans believed that life begins at birth originally that they would be holding on to that belief now.  With social conservatism, it's not so much what you believe but that once you believe in something you should continue to believe it and resist people that tell you otherwise.  Because there is a perceived risk in that human interpretation it's best to err on the side of caution and believe life begins at conception because that was the default view originally.  Gay marriage conservatism also reflects the inherent mistrust of introducing a new interpretation of what marriage means.

**Government theory**: Republicans believe that the benefits of keeping the power in the hands of the individual (through more retained wealth, less regulation) outperforms keeping that power in the hands of the state.  The underlying belief is that because the state has no real competitor and no threat of extinction it can do what it wants, however it wants, as unprofitably as it wants.  It taps into that self-determination ideology that you live and die by your deeds.

**Tea party movement**: This started due to a disappointment with Republicans who embraced more flexible social values interpretations and higher government spending (moving away from that conservative government theory belief).  You can see the Republican fracture in government policy because during the Bush era because Bush did a large amount of deficit spending which bruised support for the core foundation of the efficient-less government hypothesis. 

**Trump movement**: What you see with the Trump movement is conservatives returning towards that less-government efficiency narrative.

~~In the top 10 list of how Triangle drivers could improve this would be #11.~~  edit: it probably is an outcome of the biggest problem: braking on the highway

The same number of cars could theoretically fit on the road going 5 mph as going 60 mph.  The biggest culprit of traffic is braking which does happen with "Looky-loos."  Each time you brake you introduce a "traffic wave" just like if you were in the ocean.  Add these waves up across the thousands of people traveling and you get traffic jams which is what happens when the waves/cars are close enough to build up.  If you smooth out your driving by not tailgaiting the driver in front of you then you'll save gas, reduce traffic, and everyone gets to where they're going faster.  Do this process in reverse and you can actually break up traffic jams but there are enough ignorant people on the roads that this won't be possible until driving is automated.

We honestly need to teach this in drivers ed because 90% of licensed drivers probably don't know this.
This is the best video of it by far.  It the buffer space around Trump and that the outer ring is supposed to stop people rushing Trump and then the inner ring of security and USSS are tasked with putting up a human barrier between the guy and Trump.

It's fairly average with nothing seriously bad going on.  The "perfect" swallow would look like almost milking a cow where the esophagus squeezes liquid/solid down without anything ever going in the up direction.  This video has a brief moment where it reverses which could give you a brief sensation of reflux but it seems to go down fine after that.

Peristalsis is occuring all the time so that we can deal with our normal saliva and secretions.  The esophagus is kind of automatic like how a venus flytrap will shut if anything touches inside of it.  All the esophagus sees is that something is distending it so it will respond with peristalsis.


Yeah
Yes its possible (I assume you're talking about dysphagia instead of aphasia or are you saying there is aphasia which impacts the person's ability to know when to swallow?) especially if its giving swallowing problems.  The test to see if there is food/liquid going into the lung is the easiest test in radiology IMO so I would do that personally.  Its so standardized of a test you can get it practically anywhere.  
Aphasia you could look for severe reflux or heartburn.  Difficulty with liquids. The visual part of swallowing like jaw and such should look normal so there's not much you can just sit there and watch.
Am I **doing this** right? Love you guys lol.
Woah cool!  Do you have to sedate them pretty heavily?  How can you even do that?
It's less than the increased amount someone gets from living at higher elevation relative to sea level but your point is right.  It's more of an issue with people who have to get multiple scans are at higher risk of cancer.  Barium just tastes awful, it's not bad for you.

But probably 100x more expensive when used medically if I had to guess.
It's about 2% of what I do in radiology but we're the only ones who do it. To answer your question in the middle of college.  Speech therapists on the other hand spend a significant portion of their time looking at swallowing.

The top level comment is correct.  My job is related to taking pictures/videos of people swallowing.  This link is an example of what swallowing looks like.  We give you liquid that is dark on xray.  Since the rest of your body is basically see through I can watch what your esophagus does while swallowing the liquid.  Sometimes we give patients air tablets which balloon out their esophagus to help us see it better, which is somewhat uncomfortable.  When you have that uncomfortable sensation after swallowing air your esophagus muscles can ripple.

I know, right? All you have to do is literally open a book on this stuff.  Read and interpret based on evidence, it's really easy.  But most people think with their gut as Colbert would say.  It's what makes fleecing a nation so easy nowadays.
Okay, first let's settle the geography. Turkey is part of Europe and Asia.  It's not all in Asia.  Consequently you can talk about Turkey in an Asian context or a European context, or Eurasian if you want to be totally accurate.  Second, ask yourself who suggested the agreement? The Soviets.  Who tried to cover up the agreement? The USA.  Originally the agreement was to not invade Cuba.  Then the Soviet's upped the agreement by demanding the missile withdrawal from NATO Turkey.  I don't know on what world that's a compromise.   

The Soviets wanted to make the agreement public.  Where did you read that they were the original ones that wanted it to make it private.

I'll sell you a house for $200k.  Alright let's compromise, I'll sell it to you for $250k.  

And of course the deal is complicated.  That's like saying the sky is blue.  But the terms were as clear as day.  At least know how to read a map before you start throwing around insults.
Tell that to the Czechs. Cold war was over after Cuban missile crisis /s
Please read beyond the first paragraph of Wikipedia before acting like you know something about history.  Sorry I don't appreciate being criticized by history novices with an attitude.  Read about the impact on NATO, who made the initial trade recommendation, and Turkey's opinion.  Why do you think the U.S.wanted to keep the trade secret if it was such a good deal?  All of this information is available online.  If you think you can judge the decision based on: "our missiles small, Soviet missiles big" logic then you don't understand this issue.
The trade wasn't considered bad because of their tactical impact. It politically damaged NATO and emboldened the Soviets.
I'm sure I could accomplish things if I could add $9 trillion to the national debt.  I'm the first comment to highlight how much Obama raided the American people.

Doc playing csgo here.  Most likely it's a ganglion cyst which can happen with repetitive movements and is very common.  Less likely lipoma (squishy) or neuroma. Chance of it being a bone is basically 0 if you're young.  Chance of it being something worrisome is super small.  If you go to a doctor they'll probably tell you to do hand exercises or offer treatment if it is causing significant discomfort.  Best thing you can do is hand exercises like squeezing tennis ball, stretching your hands.

As always, advice on the internet is not an official medical opinion and if you're concerned schedule a quick visit with a doctor that specializes in ortho.  You will probably get referred to one if you go to your primary doc (depending on their skill).

Good luck.

Just like they had no intention to revert xmas update.  Valve is just a flag in the wind.  

This is how it plays out. Ibp gets unbanned from league in Jan.  Destroys NA teams.  Na team makes it to major.  Everyone is like this is retarded, torqued is better, this valve major isn't even real. Ibp gets unbanned by valve.  If valve doesn't unban they lose legitimacy as major.
It's because iBP unban will be part of NA shuffle but iBP players can't talk about it
You think Valve is going to not unban them when most of community wants them unbanned, Valve can make more $$$ from unban, CSGO thought leaders are calling Valve idiots over their handling of ban (Thorin, RLewis), and leagues are going to unban them anyways.  You remember what happened with the R8? #freeSteel
They could say that the bans will be removed Jan 26th which would complicate the NA shuffle

The vast majority of CSGO community is calling Valve out for handling the bans like morons plus Valve would make more money with them playing so it's going to happen; just a matter of when.

It only helps Valve if NA scene is better
Yea, why I love steel.  Plus he takes it like a man when someone calls him out so he can give and take.   
Adren queue dodged and then Adren banned him on his twitch when Steel called him out on it
Wow, pretty douchey of Adren.  Screws over a fellow streamer and then bans him on their stream.  Sounds like something Desi would do.  
World is pretty pro climate change science so pro climate change survey probably not very representative.
guy makes post, his evidence gets destroyed in replies, still thinks he's right, gg 
Problem is that Valve doesn't run events by themselves.  So you think for the Valve ESL/ESEA cosponsored major tourneys that Valve won't pressure ESEA to say that Valve's ban has priority even though ESEA says they've served their punishment?  This is why Richard Lewis now regrets ever bringing this evidence up because he never realized Valve would go full retard.
My problem is that I think Valve doesn't have full control.  For a split second it did and inserted itself into the domain of ESEA/FaceIT/CEVO but for the day to day admin of CS it's all ESEA/FaceIT/CEVO.  The only reason Valve did so is because it owned the servers and backend which allowed it to obtain proof that was unavailable to the leagues.  Just because it happened to have the intel doesn't make Valve all of the sudden good at being a league.  Valve could become a league if it wanted to, but it would have to make the commitment (i.e. hiring PR people, admins, etc.) to deal with policing the CSGO community which it does not want to do.

Valve is starting to realize the error of its ways because it's backing off and allowing leagues to recoup their authority by agreeing to not pressure the leagues if they want to allow iBP to play again.  The argument about it ruining the game no longer applies because Valve is acknowledging that it trusts the leagues to apply their own version of justice.  Valve is saving face by retaining a small sliver of control in the form of the majors.  Why that doesn't work is because no T1 team is going to take them if they can't compete in majors.    
Thanks man.  Based on my understanding of economics and law and how it could be applied to this situation is that you assign responsibility to the organization with greatest capacity to deal with those responsibilities.  A practical example: All of the airbags that are killing people now.  Who is responsible for paying for injuries related to faulty airbags:  The driver because they bought the car and used the airbags (do they have a duty to check the car before driving)?  The car company because they used the airbags (do they have a duty to check the airbags before installing)?  Or the airbag company because they made the airbags?  You think this is a ridiculous example but the answer that the airbag company has primary responsibility was not so obvious a few decades ago and relies on relatively recent court decisions and legal opinions. 

To answer your question: It has to be ESEA/FaceIT/CEVO.  It would be a simple meeting between the leagues to discuss: 1) how to investigate and 2) how to determine punishment: would it be based on how much money was made, how important the tourney was, repeat offenders, etc and 3) how to deal with infractions where no rules are explicitly addressing the situation.  Just because Valve funds a tournament doesn't make it a league or give it the know-how on how to deal with the types of issues leagues have been dealing with since the beginning of esports.  Right now Valve thinks because it supplies $ for a major that it has the capacities of a league.  Unfortunately, it doesn't and the iBP players by being perpetrators of the crime are being the victims of Valve's incompetence.
here is my more complete argument: https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/3y5wef/thorin_video_on_ibp_ban_broken_down_by_issue/
Alright, let me break this down.  For the iBP ban there are several intertwined issues. Just because you disagree with one part of the argument doesn't mean you disagree with all parts of the argument.  Here are the different separate arguments:

* #1: Should they be punished: Yes.  The vast majority agree with this.
* #2: How long should they be punished for: I have no idea.  This is completely arbitrary and should be decided among the leagues +/- Valve.  
* #3: Should Valve be the one punishing: No.  The vast majority don't agree with this but this is what Thorin is getting at because Valve is not taking responsibility and is behaving in a way that no competent esports league rules enforcer would act.
* #4: Should punishments ever be indefinite?: No.  They should be clear and decisive.  In cases where punishments are indefinite (i.e. parole) there are established criteria which are used to clarify what indefinite will ultimately mean.
* #5: Is criminal law philosophy a useful basis for arguments? Yes.  Criminal law philosophy is based off of centuries of evidence and application.  Trying to reinvent the wheel for esports is naive.  


|You are saying they should have been allowed to throw matches and steal from their fans because valve doesn't control every competitive match. Do you honestly believe this?

You're throwing out straw-mans or can't read.  Did you listen to Thorin in the video that this thread is about?  I'm saying exactly what's he saying and then in addition saying that Valve can provide item info and chat intel but they shouldn't function as a 1st line defense/prosecutor role because that involves significant time and effort that they're not willing to do.

Let's start there and see if you can manage that.  We can discuss the rest after.  Most people in this thread (and Valve) can't handle a complicated/nuanced situation.

Edit: Valve got lucky in this situation because they actually had intel that the leagues didn't, mainly because iBP was retarded in how they did the transactions.  Just because Valve got lucky doesn't mean they should take the primary role.  Whoever is best at policing the pros should be policing the pros.  Valve literally did this because they wanted the credit for exposing the pros but wanted none of the responsibility.
This is just like having a 1st grader who shows up late to school.  You write a note home to their parents or have a parent teacher conference.  The principal doesn't drive over to the kids house and wake them up in the morning.  

Just because Valve wouldn't be the one doling out punishment doesn't mean they can't be backup.  They never even gave the leagues the opportunity to deliver justice. Valve failed on this one and they're getting called out on it now.  Valve has turned iBP into the victims which is just making the problem worse.

Valve doesn't understand management scope and basic justice philosophy.
Iraq=Counter-Strike scene

Saddam Hussein=iBP

USA = Valve

ESEA/ESL = Middle East Nations

Valve comes in an decides that they don't like what's going on in league play.  Instead of getting the proof and giving it to the leagues, they think they can do a better job than leagues who have been doing this for years.  That's when they come in thinking they are the best and totally screw everything up.  If you read other posts, people talk about how letting them not go to Valve but allow them to go to other events is straw-man argument for T1 players.  

|It's unbelievable that people are acting like these guys are victims. They should have been VAC banned. If this was a traditional sport they would have gone to jail.

If the state executes a guy for stealing an apple without ever establishing that as an executable offense, at what point does he become the victim and the state becomes the aggressor? 
| how is valve the bad guy??

Just like the Iraq War.  If you're going to come in and disrupt everything (make new rules/policies, be the new police), you have to be prepared to own it.  Valve rode in on their white horse, decreed a bunch of stuff, and then locked themselves in their castle.  Valve should have just provided proof to the leagues and let the leagues deal with it.
Why did Valve act instead of just proving it and leaving the leagues to deal with the consequences and dole out the punishments?  Valve came in and took 100% control and then just faded into oblivion on the issue.   
I was really surprised Richard Lewis was oblivious to this point.  

Valve should have just provided the proof that match fixing happened and left it to the various leagues to deal with.  If the leagues didn't handle it then they could of stepped in.  But, they rode in like crusaders acting like they were gonna own all this and then after they figured out it wasn't going to be so easy, are trying to back out now.  Now they've put themselves in an awkward position that neither Valve nor the CSGO community wants them in.  
Which ones??
If there is a controversial point, it's easier for me to just watch the clip in its entirety on my own via Youtube than to listen for a 30 minute bias laced commentary on it.  For the most part I don't really care about anything but the economy and balancing the budget.  Everything else won't matter if those things aren't fixed.

I'm glad op looks at actual evidence instead of using gut feel to decide.  Valve is kind of running this like medieval England banishing people by royal decree without any legal framework.  How hard is it to make rules?

Interesting question:

* Most publicity: FaceIT
* Highest ranked players: FaceIT
* Highest average skill: ESEA
* Most subscribers: ESEA
* Queue times: FaceIT=ESEA (faster than) FaceIT premium
* Highest average league skill: ESEA
* Most teamplay: FaceIT 5v5 premium
* Least teamplay: FaceIT free
* Frag-hunting, f@#$ the team: ESEA
* Best anticheat: ESEA
* Best servers: ESEA
* Best teambalance: 5v5 FaceIT premium
* Worst teambalance: ESEA=FaceIT free
Seems like the OP compared the free version of faceit with the paid version of esea.  The paid version of faceit has option for premium queue which puts you against other people with premium.  

Since introduction of fpl:

5v5 premium queue faceit > esea

5v5 free faceit queue < esea
There has been an influx of players since you could qualify for fpl, maybe due to exposure.  I can't honestly tell difference between the two except that on faceit there is less lone wolfing.
It's same as if you were to play with your original rank

no u get ur rank back after first game
All standard screening labs and clinical measurements have different levels of risk, and have an artificial abnormal threshold.  Since there are different level of risk which rise as they approach abnormal, one could assign descriptors: like poor, average, excellent to those levels of risk.

Blood pressure is one of the factors used to determine heart attack risk.  In a person with no cardiovascular risk factors, "prehypertension" or borderline hypertension isn't defacto hypertension and may not be treated like hypertension.  Someone with excellent blood pressure would not have hypertension nor would have borderline hypertension.

PSA can be detectable and still be normal.  Someone who has an excellent psa would be someone whose psa falls below the median normal psa and is the same or less than prior values.
Lab results that can be "good":

* coronary calcium score
* cholesterol
* blood pressure
* PSA

I don't see anything wrong with this letter. 
And Lyft is good too
I don't think they play against eu
No idea about eu.  Only know NA.

pre fpl na: esea>faceit

Now tier 1 pugs are faceit.  Tier 2 esea. Tier 3 faceit.

Post fpl na: faceit > esea for tier 1
I think just pugs and tourneys, no dedicated pro queue.  In ESEA, pros are thrown in random PUGS which is why I've played with complexity and NME players before.  
I think we're talking about faceit pre and post fpl.  I don't see the real benefit of esea if there is something to shoot for with fpl.

why not faceit?
Gaming doesn't require a fast connection.  They just use that because gaming is popular.  If you want to make your gamer happy then utilize the QoS feature on your router so that they get priority if your connection is being used a lot.  It makes no difference to other users but to the gamer it is everything.

How many concurrent Netflix users is the only question that matters for average American family.
Op has twc maxx.  They gave everyone free speed boosts which allows you to downgrade if you don't need that much speed.  My guess is you don't have twc maxx.
