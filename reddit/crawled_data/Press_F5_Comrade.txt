Suggest it to Stephen Miller, I'm sure Trump will consider it. 
Love the response:

This is the era in which the US becomes the wealthiest and most dominant force in human history. 
But... It's Obama. He has a D next to his name. 

Serious, this redditor is cherry picking and ignoring half of what I said. (S)he unconditionally loves Obama just like those who love Trump. Same shit, different bowl. 
What's amazing is... I did mention other things. Let BP off the hook, drilled in the Arctic. He's the most domestic oil drillingest President ever. Fracking exploded on his watch.  Obama is shit.

> Obama intervened in DAPL

On Dec. 4 of '16.  This was a song-and-dance. He knew Trump would reverse it. 
I feel for you.  Empathetically and sympathetically.  I cannot with your rape experiences, but it pains me that you had to go through that.  It pains me to see what women go through.  Seeing what my wife and two daughters deal with fills me with a rage that is unquenchable.  When men make sexual comments to them, I'm NEVER around....fucking cowards.  If I were I'd go berserk.  I mean... men will tell my wife that they'd like to meet my 3 year old daughter in a bar in 15 years.  WTF!?!!!!  It makes me hate men.  Anyway.... I'm sorry that so many men are shit.  However, I have felt like you've felt.  Aimless. I found my purpose in personal quest for knowledge and be a bastion of it for my high school students, and my daughters. Meditation, therapy and philosophy are my personal coping strategies.

Your ivy league experience reminds me of an article I read a few years ago about how ivy league schools, particularly Harvard, only want students who can represent their brand/product properly after graduation in social settings.  A walking advertisement. Hence the enrollment interview process. It's not about academics.  For some...for few it is.  Our hollow economic system as successfully sucked the life out of our institutions, K-12 and beyond.  I think to think that neoliberalism killed what was left of the Enlightenment.  Read George Ritzer's McDonaldization of Society, and/or Education and the Cult of Efficiency by Raymond Callahan.  Our learning institutions aren't about learning anymore.  Look at University Presidents around the country.  They're run by [non-academics](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/12/college-president-mizzou-tim-wolfe/418599/) in a for-profit style. I teach my high school students to take ownership of learning, most don't.  I aim to teach them to discriminate against sources, etc.  Be critical.  We're living in a world where it seems people don't do this anymore.  They label themselves with an ideological brand and buy whatever that ideology tells them to.  Being required to remember why Aaron Burr shot Hamilton isn't more important than that. Actually that's not even important to schools anymore.  Kids aren't expected to know things anymore, but to know skills in which employers can program. This "21-century grading" nonesense is code for dumbing down schools and turning them in to programmable instruments of labor. 

>In college I found myself in a group that could discuss literature and philosophy for hours, but the subtext was always more about who was the most agreeable, datable, and likely to succeed. Nobody cared about just learning for learnings sake.

Personally, I feel blessed that I went to a mid-tier state school, and this is why.  I majored in sociology and US History.  I found out that taking the night classes were better for discussion and social development.  In those classes you get a diverse group of people across different ages and backgrounds.  Day classes, everyone was the same age, etc. We'd meet outside school in a sociology club to carry on class discussions even after the class topic had moved on. 

>But I felt that as an institution the school discouraged real inquiry and encouraged instead the strategy of managing time for maximum productivity rather than learning. 

Even at that mid-level state school, this was apparent and it came from above.  Often times ironically.  I had a Prof I admired.  In his class, we actually read that Ritzer book I mentioned above.  Later in the class, he began using University mandated online assessments/modules.  I brought up that online is just a form of de-valuing, dehumanizing and hurting education for the sake of efficiency and profit.  He got up-set.  I was disillusioned.  

>I dropped out, and transferred somewhere else and am now getting a teaching degree. Because it's the system that's fucked up, as well as me. We focus so hard on teaching kids to be good workers we forget to teach them to be humans. 

You're not alone. Before my mid-tier school, I was at a Big Ten school.  I majored in something for the purpose of making money.  It was awful.  I was basically being taught to devalue humanity into business/customer/money relationships.  I dropped out. 

>What do we do? How can we stop this?

When I was younger this would literally keep me up at night.  When I look around I see society in decay.  I have learned to accept it, but still actively do what I can to change it for the better.  People of the past have experienced it, we're experiencing it.  I try what I can with my children, friends and students.  But the powers are massive.  However, my ray of hope is the youth.  People under 40.  People are growing tried of this nonsense.  The American's rejection of Hillary is a good thing in the long run.  Trump is an exposure of America's long overdue self-reflection. I don't think older people will reflect, but youth will.... that's my hope. 

>I want to teach kids these skills but I barely have them myself.

But you do... because you realize things that it seems others don't.  Focus on this.  Master it.  While you teach them, allow them to teach you at the same time. 

> They were openly carrying AR15's as well I remember seeing one with a glock strapped to his leg.

This is sacrilege in left-wing groups.  AR15s and Glocks are the weapons of bourgeoisie capitalists. 

Here, the reason why leftists cover their faces isn't to cause crimes, but to protect themselves from fascist doxxing.  However, many leftists see the need to crush fascism in it's infancy, just like Hitler suggested. "Only one thing could have stopped our movement – if our adversaries had understood its principle and from the first day smashed with the utmost brutality the nucleus of our new movement." - Hitler - 1939  Arguably, liberals coddle proto-fascists until it's too late.
This just in.... a letter admitting to everything with the name Trump on the bottom proves that letter was written by Trump. 


Obama, did the neoliberal minimal for the environment.  Even drilled in the Arctic... let police beat DAPL protesters.  It's funny... When Obama does this... it's fine.  When Trump does it, he's a maniac. 
> "Film the police"

Why would they shout this?  I think we have pretty solid evidence that police cameras are more for them than protecting us.  

>"Kill the police"

If they're killing you, is this not a viable option?  I'm not advocating hunting them down, but... for fucks sake, cops murder people all the time and society seems to be okay with that.  I'm of a Black Panther mind that you have to protect your community for oppressive forces, such as the police. 
Good point.  They aren't heroes, and frankly, they never were.  They clampdown on worker protests and killed union leaders.  They sick dogs and water hoses on black protesters.  They (at least) turned a blind eye if not participated in lynchings.  I don't even have to do in to today. Fuck the police.  I know it's cliche, but fuck them.

[Just like Obama](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/here-s-why-obama-is-approving-arctic-drilling-again/).  

Remember how Obama threw the book at BP for the oil spill?  Or when he stood by American treaties with Native Tribes? Me neither. 

>Could they have done more, of course. Are they at least doing something? YES.

But not doing enough in a situation like this is basically not doing anything.  It's like getting chemo, and getting only half of the treatment needed to attack cancer.  
> The point Obama was making there is that the entire political spectrum of the country has moved so far to the right that "liberal" policies today would've been moderate Republican stances 30 years ago.

This is exactly my point!  People are upset that I can't vote for someone like Hillary and complain about her, when in reality she's a Republican and people are just accepting of that?! These are faux, bullshit choices.  Had someone other than Trump won the nomination, the same people would have been running against eachother. 

>Explain to us how Obama is the same as Trump when it comes to environmental policy?

Sure... they're both shit and not fixing our massive environmental problems. You can't put a band aid on a wound that requires stitches and assume that is good because at least it's something.

PS- Since when did "trolling" mean, someone who disagrees? I'm not trolling, I have legit concerns and valid points. 
Clinton was a guaranteed continuation of neoliberal Reaganomics.  She has a history of saying what's popular but maintaining that neoliberalism.  Why would I believe her any more than Trump? 
Why are you here if you really think Dems care about the environment beyond mentioning it as a talking point to conjure support.  What actions... substantial actions have they accomplished?

[The fact oil companies like it](https://www.npr.org/2017/05/18/528998592/energy-companies-urge-trump-to-remain-in-paris-climate-agreement) doesn't fill me with confidence it's worth much.  Besides, many feel [it has major flaws](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/mar/28/climate-scientists-debate-a-flaw-in-the-paris-climate-agreement).  I'm not saying it's not a good step, but it's too little too late, so this issue and Clinton is a non-starter.  More needs done now. 

>She campaigned on cutting subsidies for gas and oil while increasing them for wind, solar, and other cleaner technologies.

Right, and her problem... like Trump is... I can't and don't believe her. She has two personalities, remember?  One for the public and another for Wall St.  She, like Obama is full of shit.

[Clinton is such a politician](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/sep/20/hillary-clinton-dropped-climate-change-from-speeches-after-bernie-sanders-endorsement) she says things for votes, not presenting what she plans on doing.

>no one is forcing you to go to college

This implies that there isn't a correlation between attainment of post secondary education, especially 4-year institutions, and wages. The running joke, which is taken from reality is that employers want college educated workers with 3 years experience fo letting entry level, $30k positions. Those who fail to conform are implied things will be even worse. 

Capitalism amplifies these problems. Worker exploitation, and outsourcing the costs of educating and training employees on the employee themselves. 
Consider the fact that if everyone majored in STEM, the market would be saturated and wages would plummet. 

Also, being a child of the 90's, society constantly told us two things. 1: Do what your heart tells you and follow your dreams. 2: You have to go to college. Now, they're going to wag their fingers at us. "Well... This is your fault, you didn't have the right dream."

As a teacher. I have seen quite outrageous clothes. I have seen nipples coming over the edge of tops and butt cheeks appearing below skirt lines. Regardless of ethnicity, there has to be a line.  It the same with guys. I see underwear and ass cheeks all the time. I see open jackets with no shirts underneath. 

>Disturbingly, schools tell girls they must change in order to avoid “distracting” their male classmates — or to avoid being sexually harassed. These punishments interrupt girls’ educations while sending dangerous messages to the school community: how a girl looks is more important than what she thinks, and girls are ultimately responsible for the misbehavior of boys.

Behavior modification is a two pronged attack for both involved. This piece makes it sound like boys are never held responsible. Perhaps, but it glosses over the issue. Are we going to allow race be the excuse to not set dress codes. I'm literally seeing butts, chests and breasts from both sexes. 
Just doing their job.
I'm pretty sure both parties are damaging democracy. Dems confirm outrageous Trump appointees. Also are willing and able to shift right if it means you get to attack Trump. They too are proponents of war, exalting the rich and censorship against dissent. If you don't see it, you're in denial.

> Okay, is the problem that what you want is not popular, or that people who are up for election don't have popular opinions? In the latter case, it seems entirely resolvable by having different candidates. The former is not a problem, it is the very nature of a democracy and should not be fixed.

The problem is that we're born and bred to accept that elections are about voting against the other, not for the person. 

>democratic institutions are still in place

This is the problem.  These aren't in place, and [both parties](https://theintercept.com/2018/04/26/steny-hoyer-audio-levi-tillemann/) have their own version. 
>The anti-capitalist regimes haven't had a great track record for the environment, economic development, and not least human rights.

Regardless on the accuracy on this, it doesn't change the fact that capitalism is destroying the environment. 

>Ultimately, the solution is going to have to be technological.

Waiting on the market to fix the problems it created will happen too late if it happens at all.  The system generates too much power in the hands of those responsible; they are sustaining the problems. Waiting on a scientific magic-bullet is far too big of a gamble.  The oceans are now plastic on a molecular level. There's essentially zero initiative to fix this.  We cut trees, burn coal, and go to war for fossil fuel.  I don't know when and where this science will come from.  


>inaccurate testimony

I'm in a union, and I don't like our leadership.  However, my options... like US elections, aren't ones I actually want.

>The alternative to the ballot box is what? Violent imposition of will upon the populace by a totalitarian?

This was the response liberals used to say to civil disobedient Civil Rights leaders of the 20th Century.  civil disobedience doesn't equate to violence.  However, we as a people are being oppressed by violence.  

Consider the civil rights gains of the 20th century or the Progressive Era to the 70's.  Change requires demonstrations and civil disobedience.  The past 40 years are a testament to that. Waiting to vote problems away doesn't work.  People voted for Obama for "Change" and didn't get it. Hillary was more faux "Change".  Trump is the irony of our times.

Thanks, I wish I wasn't.  I wish I was simply being my pessimistic self.  But in this world my pessimism is actually me being pragmatic, which I used to find depressing, but I'm now more accepting of. 
I think it is the same problem in government. Only [29% of Americans](http://news.gallup.com/poll/1669/general-mood-country.aspx) think the US is on the right track.  That % peaked at 36% over the past decade.  Simple replacement isn't working. 

I'd wager, soon both with be demanded to change outside the realm of the ballot box. 
>I'm only 36 and I can clearly see how the weather has changed over the past years in central Europe. Winters come much later but last longer into the year. There's no spring, summer follows winter. It's hot in September but rainy in July.

I too am 36 and have noticed, here in Mid-West US, the same things you have.  We had a snow storm last week.  Today the high is 67 (19C).  There's still snow on the ground in some places.  This winter essentially lasted from November to mid-April.  Last "fall" it was in the 70-80s until October, then immediately it was in the low 40's/upper 30's.  

I too worry of climate change, but this is just one piece of the puzzle.  I fear the ocean, what we're doing to it and our unforeseen dependency on it.  Also, the toxification of our environment that seems to spread to all corners of the Earth.  

People's apathy and/or overwhelming feelings of not being able to do anything about.  Couple that with other who think driving a hybrid and recycling will save us.  We're not demanding of our politicians... even the energy company sanctioned Paris Climate Accords aren't enough.  We need to act now, and we aren't and we're unwilling to.  

Our only true hope is the abolishment of capitalism.  The power it gives to those who wield it aren't willing to concede.  They have too much power and that will be our demise.  

I agree with the late, great George Carlin.  [Humans are so anthro-centric, we actually believe the Earth won't fix our mess over the eons](https://youtu.be/tncnWp67wQI?t=1m12s).  It will.  We just won't be here.  Why would Earth keep us.  We're parasites... or at least our socioeconomic system is.

> Harder to strike without a union.

I'd argue that it's harder to sustain a strike with one.  Especially if you're a member of a massive one that simply encourages you to vote for Democrats in November. These teachers in WV and OK had to circumnavigate their unions and use FB to organize.  Then the union tried to take the helm and reign in the strike.  The poll on one of the OK teachers FB pages had nearly 80% wanting to continue the strikes.  In WV, the unions claimed they got 95% of their demands.  Which isn't true.

I agree. Voter suppression is a huge issue. If we're going to overcome it, Democrats are going to have to put 2016 behind them and attack Trump on is lies, broken promises and bullshit policy. They will have to move left, not further right like they are now. They will have to talk of issues. The "not Trump" angle isn't working. Not looking in the mirror and realizing Hillary was a bad candidate seems to be something they can't do. 

All I know if this is they type of shit on the ballot this year, I'm not voting for them. All it will do it have a resistance against Trump, and more of the same neoliberal policy of the past 40 years. 
Isn't this always the excuse?

Tell me... Where are Democrats pumping the airwaves of the Trump admin's true, and provable issues?  Rampant corruption, gutting and tax cuts for the rich while they pass bi-partisan military spending increases and $1.3T spending bills. They don't speak of them. All they speak of is Russia and the election. Oh... And WikiLeaks. 

Isn't it interesting that they attack Assange, yet the topic of what Assange actually released is strangly absent?  They speak of rigged elections and collusion yet the DNC is guilty of the same thing in their primary.

Democrats the nation over are attacking Trump with right-wing talking points. Liberal editorials about how Trump isn't bombing Syria enough. Hating the FBI one day, then loving it the next?  Scratch a liberal and a fascist bleeds.


What we need to do... cut taxes.  Let the job creators a greater ability to hire people.  The past 40 years of this hasn't been enough. 
Nobody is doing shit.  The only opposition still can't get over the 2016 election and are fixated on Russia.  They could go after him on true corruption and violations of the Constitution.  They aren't.  The media only fuels Russiagate and other non-starters. They could go after these things, but they don't.

I think our media sells us on the idea that to get there you don't need education.  Look at TV and music.  They get it in their head that that can and will be them, because they're them and they will get there.

"Globalist" * *ears bleed from high frequency dog whistle*
I get what you're saying and I agree. However, the propaganda of the era in which I grew up in was less-so, much less.  I'm sure the collapse of the USSR was a major factor.  Boomers parents lived in a time where you could have been arrested for being a communist.  Classrooms spoke about communism and heavily against it, whereas myself I didn't know what it was until high school.  Only mentions in history class.  Later it was a shunning. Even later it wasn't praised, but it was allowed.  I did have a Marxist college professor.  He wouldn't had been able to say what he said if it was the 50's or earlier. 
These boomers were brainwashed from the day they were born to blindly reject all forms of socialism.

It almost make them worse because they're well-versed enough and still maintain their liberalism.  I feel that many (not all) "liberals" in the FDR sense of the word may not use that term the way we do.  Or at least are of a mind to be more of a socialist. 
Unions, by-and-large are failing.  They're there to keep the peace and keep teachers working.  Just look how they will hype-up most deals between state and teacher no matter what it is.  "Asked for $10K but were offered $6K?  Take it, and get back to work!"  Teacher wages are just one piece of what's needed to be done, but it's as if it's the focus for two reasons. 1: Anything more than just teachers will cost even more.  2: If it remains the narrative, they can still frame teachers as greedy (as pathetic as that is). 
That line has always stuck with me too. I've actually quoted it a few times in conversation. Or at least paraphrased.

In light of current news, and reasoning for starting yet another war, it's important to remember truths when our leaders are recalling other leaders' MO.  Assad being known for gassing people is simply based on knee-jerk media assumptions.  A tell is how quickly they want Trump to strike back.

>I agree that the US is guilty of many terrible things but that doesn't mean we should write them off as harmless.

I agree.  However, breaking down the fact that the US spends $800B a year on military vs $50B.  How big of a threat are they?  

I think it's that they want to ensure the drums of war continue to bang, and they get their nearly trillion dollar military budgets.

Because they need to show a strong NATO alliance. Because the country needs never ending conflict.  Because they're Congress and often irrational. 

>I'm not personally worried about Russia but if you don't think they're up to some shady shit

I'm not saying that.  I'm saying every nation is, but our media is leading us on as if to think they're the only ones and a threat... as if prepping us for war with them. 

Going after Russia is easy because of how corrupt the country is.  But so is the US.  I feel like they're cherry-picking.  If you really wanted to, many politicians, like Trump could probably be investigated and found guilty of something.  Off-shore money, whatever...  

My bottom line isn't that Russia is crooked, it is.  But the megaphone of it since the election and the rise is acceptance of what the media says... couple that with the media ignoring all the other stuff.  It telling, and will lead to more conflict, war, and disparity. 

If the "meddled" (whatever the fuck that means aside from Twitter trolls) in the election.  The way I see it is that we reap what we sow.  They give us shit candidates nobody wants, while we overthrow governments, bomb innocent children, and bully the planet.  Fuck... we fucking deserve it and more. 

>If you think "the Deep State" and Soros are some serious threat you need to take off your tinfoil hat.

I don't think this either.  My point above was both sides seem to have reactionary "bad guys".  
...and when people fall for it, they get pissed if you point it out. 

Even if you ask them to take a step back for just a moment.  Why does every media outlet cover Russia under the pre-disposition that all speculation is true.  Couple that with the fact its all they're talking about.

Everywhere I go on Reddit, if I question Russiagate I'm down voted into oblivion.  Like... why hasn't Porton Down shared the nerve agent sample, as per international treaty?

You've got to look at the Western world as a whole.  Right wing extremism is on the rise.
Neoliberal policy, propped up by the New York Times is what is helping facilitate the rise of right-wing extremism.  The NYT propagates war and economic liberalism that creates massive wealth inequality that leads people to turn to these alternatives.  Hillary's loss is testament to the failures of the past 40 years of neoliberalism.  She lost to Trump.  Trump!  How's that not a huge red flag?  They will tell you it's Russia, sexists, fake news, whatever... but that's all cover of the underlying fact that wealth is only going to the top, and people are sick of it.  Liberals are failing by moving center and right of center, while the right moves further right, then seem to be at least different. Seem to be.

TIL Adopting pieces of socialism to save capitalism is socialism. 
>FDR was

FDR was a capitalist who adopted some socialist policy to keep capitalism alive, which was his intent. What he did is what the west is failing to do now and driving people to the extreme left and right. 

I agree that Bernie is like FDR, but to apply the term "socialist" to their ideology seem to be a sign of ignorance about socialism.  I don't hear either talk about democratizing the workplace. 

>individualism and the freedom of a single person to achieve their own capital and use it as they choose

This isn't entirely true. 

>Capitalism is the diriving force of modern civilization

The null of this is that the Soviet Union attained no progress, which is very untrue. 

>MLK would never have approved of labeling somebody a class enemy

"In a sense, you could say we're in a class struggle." - MLK 

Source: Taylor Branch, At Canaan’s Edge: America in the King Years 1965–1968 (New York: Simon & Schuster, 2006), 654.

Does that not sound Marxist? One cannot be both socialist and a capitalist.  The ideologies are incomparable. I feel as though people think of this when in reality they're thinking of Keynesian Capitalism, which heavily influenced FDR (and in turn Bernie). 
MLK's three global evils:

Militarism

Racism

Economic exploitation - An essential element of capitalism! 

>“Capitalism forgets that life is social. And the kingdom of brotherhood is found neither in the thesis of communism nor the antithesis of capitalism, but in a higher synthesis.” 

August 16, 1967.

>“I imagine you already know that I am much more socialistic in my economic theory than capitalistic… [Capitalism] started out with a noble and high motive… but like most human systems it fell victim to the very thing it was revolting against. So today capitalism has out-lived its usefulness.”

July 1952

>“In a sense, you could say we’re involved in the class struggle.”

1968

>“The evils of capitalism are as real as the evils of militarism and evils of racism.”

1967

>“You can’t talk about solving the economic problem of the Negro without talking about billions of dollars. You can’t talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums. You’re really tampering and getting on dangerous ground because you are messing with folk then. You are messing with captains of industry. Now this means that we are treading in difficult water, because it really means that we are saying that something is wrong with capitalism.”

1966

>“And one day we must ask the question, ‘Why are there forty million poor people in America? And when you begin to ask that question, you are raising questions about the economic system, about a broader distribution of wealth.’ When you ask that question, you begin to question the capitalistic economy. And I’m simply saying that more and more, we’ve got to begin to ask questions about the whole society…”

Also, this has been a norm since Bush.  Why would Trump of all people, stop? 
We have to look at this beyond Trump.  This has been a problem since Bush and won't go away when Trump goes away.  Unless we collectively insist that our government stop the murder of innocent people.  
>I am leaning towards assimilation because it is not in Native American culture to open a business let alone a casino.

I'm in complete agreement. A casino is a major indication of assimilation simply based on the fact that they're engaged in casino gambling itself. It's an manner to generate wealth for the tribe within the framework of the dominate culture, Eurocentric America. 

Something to consider that adds to assimilation is that the ultimate entity that allows Indian gaming itself isn't their sovereignty but the Federal Government.  Look into the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. 

Indian Casinos weren't organically derived, they were a reaction the problems of outside influence: oppression by the US government, broken treaties, etc. The games that are played aren't derived from Indian culture, but adoptions from already established, typical casino games.

If you approach this from a null angle, or "if this was pluralism would it look like this?"  The answer would have to be "no".  They speak English, they're dependent on mainstream "everyday" Americans, etc.  

Hope that helps.

Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection."

They either get sick of constantly trying to keep things straight with someone who doesn't have original thoughts (or when he does, those around him make him take it back, i.e., the time he attacked the NRA) or he fires them because people cannot do their jobs properly while maintaining this insane, dysfunctional ideology.

Where are these jobs?  How do you get them?  I have 2 bachelor's degrees and a Master's degree. I have a job that pays okay now... but that'd because I got here just before the 08 bubble burst.  I have colleagues with the same education that make 3/5ths of what I make.  If you look at jobs... even ones where you're education.  They start at $30K a year entry level job... 3 years experience minimum.  These are the sought-after jobs.  

>Or just not have children until your out of those govt programs.

This is the conundrum where blaming the victim isn't the root of the problem.  As you've mentioned.  Absent parents (for whatever reasons) coupled with a degrading and constantly budget slashed education system, >40 kids to a classroom... (some districts don't even teach sex ed) and the dismantling of entities like Planned Parenthood add to the problem.  

>Yes the mega corporations are evil scum and yes they do shit on the lower class. But since things are the way they are and probably not going to change soon, why set yourself up to become another statistic?

How? Just saying do it doesn't make it happen. People don't want to be a statistic, mostly. People in these corporations actively seek to make these problems in society more substantial.  If you look at history, especially the 1920's, things are very similar.  Then you at the 1930's for our potential future. 

>Why is it always a certain race that puts themselves in this position?

Is it a race, or a social class? If you want to talk race, look at history.  It's society that has always put certain limitations on specific races. The past and causality has a direct impact on the now.  

Something to consider... and this is just an example.  The suburbs... why are they mostly white?  There's well documented reasons.  After WWII soldiers had GI Bills and  government breaks (handouts if you will) to buy new homes for cheap. However, banks were only lending to non-Jewish whites.  [It was literally their policy](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/the-racist-housing-policy-that-made-your-neighborhood/371439/).  Even if you didn't want to leave the city [banks made the economic burden so great, that you had to if you wanted to sustain a decent financial position](http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/147.html).  [So when blacks from the South moved North to escape racist Jim Crow laws, and looking for better jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Migration_(African_American)#/media/File:GreatMigration1910to1970-UrbanPopulation.png) after WWII, their only option was the inner-city.  Whites (pushed by banks) flocked to the burbs, while blacks were only allowed to live in the older city. This was when jobs were also starting to leave the cities as well. Factory jobs we're branching out even to other countries (Made in China) so that when blacks got here, the jobs fled at the same time whites did.  And since education is determined by property taxes.  Suburban schools were and are better funded, while city schools suffer (this is why today, politicians like Betsy DeVos want to privatize "bad schools".  Tax funded suburb schools stay intact, while innercity schools become cheap, underfunded and deregulated).  Today's people are victims of the past, as well as their own ignorance.  If we continue to cut funding to schools, especially those who need it most, it will only get worse. 

PS- [Today, banks still racially discriminate](http://www.mcall.com/news/nationworld/pennsylvania/mc-nws-racial-discrimination-home-loans-redlining-20180214-story.html).  With the same education and financial status, blacks are approved for loans at a rate 1/3rd to that of whites. 

It's tough to solely blame the individual when powerful social forces work against you.

This is the result of two centuries of racial divide and conquer in action.  Those in power what the working class to think they're somewhat kin to them by skin, when in reality we have more in common with other races of the same social class than we do with the ruling rich.  But if they keep us fighting over something as stupid as skin color, we'll never wise-up to their oppression.

>Looking up wikipedia, 2010 census reports 72% of America's population is white, America is heavily influenced and controlled by white people.

Yes, and even bleeding heart liberals who want to have their hearts in the right place are often mis-informed or complacent. And/or they simply have the luxury of race not being a major issue to them.  Consider in his lifetime, the last opinion poll of MLK in 1966, only 32% of Americans view him positively whereas 63% viewed him negatively.  They didn't like him because they thought he was impatient, disruptive and going about it the wrong way (just like how people see many protesters today).  People believe you should only change things at the ballot box.  Look at the last 40 years... today is where that mentality has gotten us. 

>white people make better parents because it was more beneficial to be white than black before

Yes, [but it is still the case](https://www.vox.com/2018/3/5/17080218/school-segregation-getting-worse-data). We're led to think that whites are better parents.  It's not that, it's that they and their children have more, and better opportunities.  

PS...

>Martin Luther King's speech

Look at the last few MLK speeches.  Look into his three evils: racism, economic exploitation (rich vs. poor), and militarism (war for oppression, power and money). He was evolving from a racial civil rights leader to an economic civil rights leader, and which is probably what got him shot. Look at this thread of this post, the Civil Rights movement needs a resurrection. People still blame victims of inter-generational racism.  This whole thread (excluding yourself and some others) are peppering racist sentiments while claiming that these people simply need to do things for themselves.  They are so blinded by their racism they don't see the irony. 
Lots of what you're saying here is culturally bias, racist and knee-jerk reactionary stereotypes. 

>Has it ever occurred to you that maybe there needs to start being personal accountability and its the parents fault of those children that those children act like fools, refuse to learn and are affecting their OWN education?

Try something.  Step out of your comfort zone of blaming the victims for a moment and try to come up with ways in which society has an impact on these individuals.  

Quick hypothetical: 

Imagine there is a girl who wishes to look thin and fair but somehow she cannot achieve this look. Now this girl goes into a chronic depression and suffers from inferiority complex. In order to be thin she becomes anorexic and faces severe health problems. Now, if we see this case in isolation, we will think that it’s her personal problem and she is spoiling her life on her own. But if we apply a boarder analytical lens, we would realize that it's the obsession of society in general for the fair skin and thin body that has indirectly affected this girl. It is the media, that represents society, portrays beautiful and desirable girls as thin and fair. This kind of representation affects many people directly or indirectly, as it happened in case of this particular girl. If only few girls suffered from anorexia in society then we could have called it individual or personal problem. But, when there are many girls suffering from the similar problem then it becomes a social issue where stereotypical attitude towards women and social media needs to be scrutinized. 

Another, and more relevant:

Suppose, there is a boy who is not getting a job. He tries very hard to get a job that will pay him enough but fails. Now he joins the underworld gang and engages in illegal and criminal activities. If you analyze this case individually, then you may say that this boy did not try hard enough to get a job and performed illegal activities to get easy money. But if you see this case more analytically, then you would see that the larger forces such as, a bad economy, unemployment, and the lack of government assistance, etc. had a direct impact on the life of this boy. What if this is 2009, right after the mortgage bubble and the economy was collapsing, jobs weren't hiring? We could have blamed the personal character of the individual if very few people went through the similar situation.  But when there is a significant number of youth facing the same problem then it becomes a social or public problem where government policies about employment and banking needs to be looked at. 

Ignoring the impact society has on the individual renders us blind to the social forces in our lives we don't have control over.  

Last one.  Imagine a person who doesn't ever interact with anyone outside his or her ethnicity.  This person is a member of the majority and finds its rather easy to maintain company of those most like you.  The entire live of this person, they rarely ever interact with any other ethnicity.  The most they see is what's on media.  They develop a negative opinion of those people based on how the media portrays them.  Not all the time, but most of the time, these ethnicities are shown as violent, ignorant, and maladjusted. Imagine if this is the only way you've ever seen these people and what your opinion of them might start to become... negative, hateful, etc. 

Now... reverse the above.  Imagine a child that's a minority growing up, and when you see people in the media that most resemble you, it's mostly negative.  How will you start to view yourself? This is called [self fulfilling prophecy](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~sfos0060/prophecies.shtml) and has been researched and proven. 
> How much worse is it that the students can't take advantage of it? The teachers still teach don't they? If the student is committed and supported by their parents, they could succeed at any school in the country.

You definitely didn't grow up in this situation.  This is victim blaming, which is a classic reasoning in America but very shortsighted. 

>If the student is committed and supported by their parents, they could succeed at any school in the country.

This is not true whatsoever.  Many kids aren't to no fault of their own but your logic blames them.  There are kids who have parent(s) who work so much, they aren't there to help with homework or check-up on them.  They busy working.  My single parent mother worked three jobs.  One full time and two part time.  How can she do more?  She can't.  When you're paid wages you cannot live on, how is that not society's problem?  Had she not done this we would have been broke.  If that were the case, your logic blames the parent.  Is working to keep your head above water also the parent's fault? How can it be both ways?  This logic is "poverty is your fault and any negativity that comes out of it is your fault."  It's illogical. 

Life isn't as simple as this.
> Everyone in America has access to free public education until they're 18.

Is that education equal?  Are the homes those children go home to after school equal? 

>What they choose to do during that time is their own responsibility and if you fail every class and drop out.

Where are reasons why people under a certain age cannot be held culpable.  Their brain isn't developed enough for them to make good decisions. If there aren't people in that person's life helping them... guiding them.  Then what kind of decisions do you think they'll resort to.  Life isn't as simple as this. 

>Hence why hospital emergency rooms in inner cities are always filled with mostly black people

WOW!  Got a source citation?  One thing that pops into my mind immediately is... IF this is accurate.  Could it me due to the fact that the innercity to predominately people of color?  

>There's also a handful of organizations specifically created in order to give ONLY black people scholarships and colleges and jobs are required BY LAW now to hire at least a certain percentage of black people or accept black people into their schools through "affirmative action" whether they actually deserve to be there or not. 

I urge you to educate yourself on this topics.  This sounds like an ignorant parroted talking point. 

> having had fully functioning arms and legs the entire time

Let me know as soon as having a job (one you earn enough to survive on) becomes a guaranteed right. 

[Also consider that many people who get government assistance work](http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/pdf/2015/the-high-public-cost-of-low-wages.pdf)!  They need assistance because [they aren't paid enough](https://www.thenation.com/article/walmart-wages-are-the-main-reason-people-depend-on-food-stamps/). 

[Lastly, many government assistance programs require you to be working to receive them](http://www.welfareinfo.org/). It's bullshit right-wing smear that people just sit at home and rake in government cash.  

>Then yes its a damn hand out.

No, it isn't. It's subsidized payroll so that mega corporations can get away with paying employees unlivable wages. 
Haha, nevermind that China... the world's most population country had a communist revolution. 

>as much as other brown people

Looking good Adolf.

I think Americans seem to think they're experts on everything.  From climate change to their medical expertise.  Their perspectives are better than that of educated experts.

Being anti-Semitic but also a Zionist (like Trump) isn't anti-Semitic.

NPR is shit.  This Trump-era, Russia-scare era is once again showing people their true colors. A couple weeks ago, they had a story about the Austin bombings, and 80% of it was about Russia trolls/bots that "spread division" in our utopia.

Imagine being a teen social leader from the ashes of your peers being randomly shot. And shitheads think you're a problem. 
This shit is getting fucking pathetic now. 
When people make mention of this, the concept of relative poverty gets sidelined. It's like a talking point for the ruling class to try to make the citizens of the global North to feel better about themselves. Me... It just pisses me off more.

>Trump only won Wisconsin in 2016 because voter turnout was the lowest it had been in Wisconsin in 20 years.

This mentality is bullshit. Trump won, because the DNC served up up a shit candidate. It wasn't just because people didn't feel like voting.  They didn't have anyone to legitimately vote FOR. 
They aren't covering the Israeli murdering of innocent Palestinians either.  NPR was too worried about how peace in Syria will HELP THE RUSSIANS!
Liberals claim to be all about equality, then... Like you said, they pander to the "Hispanic vote". They contort their ideology to stereotypes for votes.
Multiple responses....it seems you're trying to convince yourself. I'm not trying to be a dick, just being honest. 
It's responses like this... You're putting words in my mouth. Stereotyping me. This isn't helping your argument.

Haha. We've got a horseshoe theorist here. 
It's as if she assumed so much... Played politics so much... Even got the party to make it so nobody else had a shot... She knew, up until election night that she would be president. Now she seems to be searching for excuses and places to point her finger.  What she needs to do is point in the fucking mirror. 
They the media ownership doesn't want there to be public support for them.

Unions are there... In their current forms, to protect business owners, maintain the peace, and keep workers working for minimal cost. The NEA, for example, endorced Hillary and other corporate Dems. My union does the same and I fucking hate it. Myself and one other at our meetings will have the nerve to actually speak out, but we're always met with essentially the lesser of two evils argument. And it works on people. Fear.

If you're surprised... I'm sorry, but you're an idiot. 
I love these shit-from-the-hip types like this. Once they actually explain WHY, I just assume they're parroting. 
Unions work with the government as a buffer to maintain order and get workers working. They often take deals that seems to cater to the oppressors rather than the workers. 
The argument is that the unions work with, not against the corporate controlled government. If you look at their overall argument it's compelling. Unions maintain stability and seem to be likely to have at the smallest deals. Just look at WV. They still got screwed.

I'm wait for the time when the state starts telling teachers they're in debt to them for allowing them to live in the school. The only way they can work it off is teaching. However, their waged earned teaching won't covered their "living in school fee". It's like sharecropping, but with teaching.
Submit a paper for peer review in a reputable journal. Give it a shot.

Prison is only for commonfolk workers. 
I agree.
Democracy itself carries partisan bias. 
I look at this in two ways. One positive, one more negative. 

Positive: These kids are waking up to the reality that adults seem to know but shrug-off. Civic activism beyond a voting booth. We need to nuture the young's desire to seek social change through direct protest against authory. It's what baby boomers and gen x-ers desperately need to do as well, but don't. 

Negative: This is obviously more through an ideological lens. They're trying to fix the problem at the symptom, not the cause. I've read that you can tell about someone's health (in some respects) by their toe nails. If you're nails are the warning sign of a larger disease. You don't cut your toe nails off and assume the problem is solved. I believe in a armed working class as well, but I also believe some form of open, transparent regulation. We're facing a massive mental health crisis that is another symptom of the ills of society. Guns really don't kill people. People make that decision, yet that is lost when the claim is labeled (by the mainstream) as "right-wing"/conservative. (People label then plug their ears these days.) We're losing sight of that with the attack on guns themselves. The corporate Democrats don't want it to go any further than this. So, this is the story we're fed. 

I truly wonder if this would be happening with a Democrat majority/President. I would assume the shootings would have still occurred, but had this been two years ago. We would have gotten some Obama lip-service and people would have had some candle rallies and that would have probably been that. I could be wrong. I hope I'm wrong, but I guess we'll never know. 

Back to the positive outlook. We have to consider that socialism is becoming favorable with youth. This needs nuturing. I think they could be off to a good start. I just worry about the psudo-"left" driving the key points. It's why I felt indifferent about the mass school walkouts. I work at a school and literally it was an authority led protest. It didn't sit well.

Tools of the political establishment. They revoked laws Panthers were using within their rights...for example 

Another way to apporach is Malcolm's quote about white people's opinion of John Brown. 
I simply look at history. Look at what Black Panthers we're and how quickly they moved in on them. The response, regardless of your ideology, one must admit the government response speak to what they represented. Meanwhile, white groups do similar but under flags of inequality, hate and oppression and aren't preyed upon like Panthers were.  
This isn't supposed to be taken in a judgemental way, for it's not my intent. 

Your disclaimer is attribute to a "them and us" mentality. Your race shouldn't mean that you shouldn't have an opinion to what happens to your fellow human. This isn't to say you ignore race like some patheticially ignorant sheltered person. On the contrary. We need to apporach social issues from the bottom up.

The lottery teases us. Literally, the American dream is to have wealth in mass abundance. The interests and concerns of the rich are plastered on our "news" channels nightly to make us think we have a stake. Also, something like <10% of Americans own 90% of all stocks. People seem to accept that it's okay that three American billionaires have wealth equal to the lower 165 million Americans. A product of brainwashing.

I will be looking into this. Right now I'm stuck on the Intercept and WSWS podcasts. 
Don't worry. [They're going to raise interest rates due to "wages rising"](http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-federal-reserve-interest-rates-impact-20180322-story.html).

> At the end of the day, everyone is self-interested at some level as it is basic human nature (or any living being for that matter).

What the fuck is this non-sense!? 

The idea that humans are greedy and selfish is rooted in ruling-class ideology and has no business on this sub.  [For thousands of years people lived in egalitarian societies](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/14/early-men-women-equal-scientists).  Class dominance came after the agricultural revolution a few thousand years ago.  And with it inequality.  
> Your comments pretty consistently go after those who criticize Trump, or defend his actions (often, of course, while also saying that you don't support him).

You can be right for the wrong reasons, I'd guess Trump supporters are at times.  It's like Trump and the TPP.  I'm glad he nixed it.  But his reasons are ridiculous. 
I used to feel this way.  But like u/Jboi_75 says.  Liberals may just be comrades who haven't figured it out yet.  I'd like to think most are.  I rarely find a liberal who actually likes neoliberalism.  It seems most liberals I know are of an FDR-like Keynesian. If/when politics comes up... truly comes up, I'm surprised how open people are to my communism.  Most (not all) people I know like the idea of unions and democratic workplaces. 

You can channel hate of the system into positive outlets.  Here on online forums.  But also in civic activism.  Turn hate on it's head:  The ruling class wants us divided.  Even if/when some of us are communists.  Love those you love if that's how you feel.  You can branch the scope of love to those you love.  The ruling class would love for you to lose those you love.  It feeds into our divisions which allow them to rule. Don't let them win.  Talk to your loved ones and be open to agreeing to disagree and continue the conversation later. People, like everything, change. 


Also remember: 

“Don't be in a hurry to condemn because he doesn't do what you do or think as you think or as fast. There was a time when you didn't know what you know today.” - Malcolm X

>I don't get this whole fallacy from Trump defenders

Questioning a known liar from the State Dept isn't a Trump defense, nor does it make me a Trump defender. Using your logic of...

> It's possible to support what he's doing now, without supporting something he did in the past.

It's possible to not like Trump as well as suspect people from the FBI and CIA. 
We're well met.  Sorry, this place attacks me so much over this I assumed you were being sarcastic. 

It's frightening how willing people are to just whole-heartedly agree and accept (the thing they assume about Trump voters and/or Conservatives). Also the embracing of Mueller. The guy lied us into Iraq, yet now I'm to praise the guy.  Yikes.
So only one spreads propaganda?  Ever watch Rachel Maddow?  This was her MO [before Trump and Russia](https://original.antiwar.com/justin/2012/12/04/rachel-maddow-war-propagandist/). She will even stretch [theory as truth](https://theintercept.com/2017/04/12/msnbcs-rachel-maddow-sees-a-russia-connection-lurking-around-every-corner/), the same thing Glen Beck used to get ridiculed for.  They may talk of different things, yet they do the same. 

PS- Let me know when [NBC starts their heavy coverage of Obama data mining Facebook](https://youtu.be/fDMLtkqDEeI?t=15m18s).  A topic they seem quite interested in these days. 
I think we're now though the looking-glass. 
Is Russia hysteria not fed to us on MSNBC nightly.  People talk as if Russia really rigged the election and ruined our utopia.  Isn't it odd that Oct of 2016, nobody cared? 
> It's not hard to spot a bad argument, especially when you attempt to cover for it with a truckload of other weak points.

Like what?  Enlighten me.  
> He definitely played a part in radicalizing me

This is what fills me with hope. I was actually in agreement with Zizek when [he said, the day before the election, he'd rather Trump win in the hopes of waking people up](https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/upfront/2016/11/zizek-electing-trump-shake-system-161116062713933.html).  He caught a lot of hate over it (which is funny because this means one of two things.  People either don't know he's a communist, or they don't know what communism is.)  Funny how it seems that he was right.  Liberals seem to continue to bash him for it, unable to see the forest for the trees. But I suppose these are devout neoliberals who see The Clinton's/and Obama for what they really are and actually like it. 
Just as the oil company has a vested interest in the destruction of the environment, Facebook has an interest in propaganda.  It's how they make money.  I don't get how these FB articles are making more people simply respond: "well... duh".  
I would argue Trump is better than Hillary with one element.  He's pissing people off and some are realizing that government has been fucked up for awhile and in need of change.  Yes, there are some who think Trump is the problem, however I think more see Trump as a symptom of a bigger problem.  40+ years of neoliberalism from both parties. 

Had Hillary won, people would/do assume things would be better.  These are people who blindly think Obama was a good president.

> Because it's literally the only hope people have for rule of law holding Republicans accountable.

Is this true?  If so that sad, and they will win.  Aren't elections a way through this?  Or by organizing and protesting?  Americans used to take protesting more seriously and it got results.  

>Paul Ryan selling stocks the same day as a private briefing on that industry

[Sounds about right](https://theintercept.com/2015/05/07/congress-argues-cant-investigated-insider-trading/). 
> Muller is literally the only person in Trump's government that is protecting america.

From what? Foreign influence? Consider the fact that there's already a lot of [foreign influence that people seem to not care about](https://www.aipac.org/).  Why do they only care about Russia? I'm not against being concerned of foreign influence, but why cherry-pick this one country? Also, it's tough to take such a hypocritical stance when the US sow it around the world. We don't really have the right to be that pissed about it if we're just now concerned. 

>Republicans have threw the towel in and refused to uphold their oath of offices. 

This isn't new. Throughout history, both parties are guilty of this be especially Republicans. Our government sells us out to the highest bidder constantly. From mass incarceration for profits, to slashing social programs for the sake of war, stomping on out Constitutional rights.  They've been fucking us over for a long time. 
Why trust him?  He, as well as many in the state department have blood on their hands. I get it... I don't like Trump either.  They could be getting him for so much more, but they aren't.  People are obsessed with Russia (spare me the whole: "they disrupted our democracy" because the US does this the world over, and with more fervor).  The irony is, if what Russia wants is to disrupt America... they don't need to.  We do it enough to ourselves and our media is the major instigator. Fox News... and MSNBC.  They both are guilty of it. 
[Stop worshiping Mueller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDO-kuOGTQ).  An enemy of your enemy doesn't have to be your friend.  Especially when that enemy of your enemy is also your enemy.

It sits on the table while he uses his Royal Presidential Golden Silly-Straw. 
Even a basic history book will tell you Stalin signed the non-aggression pact with Hitler so he could build the Russian military. Or would you have rather the Soviets not had a strong enough military?  Judging by people's lack of history knowledge I would assume they may be okay with that.  Yikes. 
If you voted against Hillary, you're sexist!

>there's a neoliberal Supreme Court

FTFY

Are you open to the idea that Hillary would have been worse in the long term?  The Obama years seem to result in worse times for the vast majority of us, but people still paint him in a positive light. Hillary would have been more of this. The slow boat over the waterfall. Trump is a speedboat towards the waterfall. We're moving so fast now, people are noticing. But that slow boat was so slow it was hard to tell. 
>obstruction and lies from Republicans

Why are we so shift to ignore corruption in the DNC?  I agree with you. Trump is better in the long-run. He's getting people active, but also aware that liberalism (conservative lite) of the past 40 years was/is a failure. Hillary's narcissism and corruption is exposing the DNC for the faux opposition party they've been these past few decades. Fuck Republicans, but if Democrats refuse to change, well fuck them too. 
Grab'em by the pussy. 
More like, "My 4th grade child could make a better poster-board project". 

The best part about this is if you see the live video. Trump fumbles through it and it's obvious he has no clue what's going on. He literally reads the captions on the board while peppering in how great each war machine is.

It's two sides of the same coin yet people seem to think you cannot be critial of both. It's like how, seemingly overnight liberals are cool with the FBI, CIA, NSA, etc... Simply because they're at odds at Trump. It's the same with Russia and Trump. Neocons we're up in arms when Obama bows to another leader, now they're cool with Putin. 

This is the frightening thing. People are going full reactionary on both sides. They're just picking their brand. 

My post above is at -9 yet no true discussion. We should be afraid that CIA people are literally running for Congress. Plus, they're running for the "liberal" party that is supposed to be against state oppression. The FBI/CIA etc. are the oppression. 

They claim Putin/Russia/Trump is dividing us. First of all, we've been divided for awhile. This isn't Putin's doing. Second, the media, both sides, it's exploiting the division and making it worse and literally playing into Putin's desire for American termoil. They're making it worse, and we're taking the bait. While we do, they roll-back economic protections... Bipartisanly. CIA people running for govenwmt, Torutuers in high level positions. Putin is exploiting what's already there, and while we're even more distracted, our government plays us against each other for all (not just Russian) oligarchs. I mean..  they're trying to start a fucking war over this nonsense. 
It's frightening that people are so okay with this. It's like history didn't happen.

I feel like the damage Trump is doing can be remedied much more easily than something like the TPP.
I feel like with Trump it's amplified.  This is becoming InfoWars' party.  The fascism is being exposed because it's being exalted.  The ruling class and capitalism itself is forsaking workers.

I'm very open to debate, but finding a true one is difficult.  Anything I bring up that is relevant but goes beyond just surface-value, I'm plagued with my points being labeled with "whataboutism".  Example: with the UK spy assassination, and May's freezing of oligarch assets.  I brought up that it's interesting to punish citizen of a nation that may have done something as such.  I also mentioned that it's a double standard that American oligarchs are never punished for what the US does.  Apparently that was irrelevant, it was whataboutism and I was a Russian troll. 

The other obvious remark once the word communism surfaces is communism killed 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,521,000 people. I dismiss this for several reasons. One, the ideology doesn't kill. Two, you could make the same claim about liberal capitalism.

Right-on, it's just... when do we ever see that American oligarchs in the same light on a post with >7000 upvotes?  The discussion needs to happen in tandem.  If they expect us to swallow this, they need not be hypocrites. 
Okay, fine.  I have realized this, however, do they know for sure it was Russia beyond May's statement "Russia has the ability to make this chemical"?

I'm not being a troll, I'm truly asking. 
This is why the story is so odd to me.  Russia did their punishment.  Why kill him?  In this fashion, Russia would have to know it would come back to them, so why kill him this way?  Why not just assassinate him elsewhere? Why be this grandiose?  It's bizarre. 
> What they did was used chemical weapons in another sovereign nation.

At this point, isn't this still suspicion?  Isn't the "proof" simply that Russia CAN produce this chemical.  Or has there been more evidence?  

>Especially a well respected European nation with lots of international pull.

This is as if the West have never lied about anything.  These leaders aren't saints. 

>And cut the whataboutism

Pathetic.  I'm on topic and raising relevant questions and you dare spout this dismissive catch-phrase. 

>Putin is clearest threat to the current world order.

[America is the clearest threat to the world](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/08/01/u-s-power-and-influence-increasingly-seen-as-threat-in-other-countries/).  The US spends about $800B a year on the military, Russia spends about $50B.  How the fuck is the US not the threat?! 
No, did I say she was?  Are there not civilian casualties in war?  I'm not condoning what happened, I just fear this hysteria and ignorance of their excuses which are double standards, will lead us to yet more militarism and nationalism. 

The US assassinated US citizen terror suspects along with [un-named innocent people and nobody gives a fuck because our leaders and their complacent media ignores it](https://theintercept.com/2017/01/30/obama-killed-a-16-year-old-american-in-yemen-trump-just-killed-his-8-year-old-sister/).  But here, they're now telling us to give a fuck, and people are falling in line.  It's amazing, and scary at the same time.  It's Vietnam/Iraq/Lybia all over again. Fear pumping. 

[Where's the outrage?!](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/yemen/7806882/US-cluster-bombs-killed-35-women-and-children.html) When will we go after the rich people who finded Obama and his murder of the innocent? We won't, and that's my point.  We're told what to think, how to think, and we seem to do it.  
What's crazy to me is that they're selling us that killing a double-agent is terrorism.  Imagine if James Bond was condemned a terrorist when he killed 006 (Ned Stark) in Golden Eye.  Edit: I get it, chemical weapons were used in public, but this makes things even more bizarre about this story.  If it turns out Russia did it, then they're fucking dumb.  Wouldn't doing something like this be obvious? 

And I'm not really hearing people question it.  In this case, I'm seeing it an activation word used on the public to excuse due process and evoke fear.  Making the whole thing suspicious. Why the double standard?  It's as if they WANT war with Russia.  Or at the very least an excuse for another Cold War. 

>But I'm a big fan of going after their assets, because that would weaken them in the eyes of the Russian people, which is the first step to curtailing their power and influence.

I wish we would also do this in the US.  I don't get why people are up in arms about rich Russians flexing political muscle and influence, yet when American oligarchs do it... it's not even an issue.  After Citizens United especially, our elections are controlled by the ultra rich, much more so than whatever it is Russia did in 2016. Hillary even said she has a public position and a private one she only tells Wall Street. 
Dear God, wouldn't want to take the wealth other nation's oligarchs. 
How is it, that only crooked Russians are being clamped down upon?  They act as if they're the only oligarchs.  They act as if the UK and US aren't oligarchies.  

Also, can you imagine if countries started doing this because of the CIA/US's torture policy?  It would be amazing to punish "innocent" rich people because of the suspected acts of government.

Consider that American wouldn't allow [Jewish refugee into the country](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005267) even after making it here.  The humanistic reasoning wasn't part of FDR's pro-war propaganda push.  Rather it was more, ["if they get the UK they're coming here next"](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/be/a0/81/bea0819b28866267c5bcb33a5579b9c6--s-religion.jpg).  The humanitarian aspect wasn't completely absent, but it wasn't the center-piece. Once Pearl Harbor happened it solidified the reasoning was self preservation. 

An excerpt from 2nd link:

>Quotas established in the US Immigration and Nationality Act of 1924 strictly limited the number of immigrants who could be admitted to the United States each year. In 1939, the annual combined German-Austrian immigration quota was 27,370 and was quickly filled. In fact, there was a waiting list of at least several years. US officials could only have granted visas to the St. Louis passengers by denying them to the thousands of German Jews placed further up on the waiting list. Public opinion in the United States, although ostensibly sympathetic to the plight of refugees and critical of Hitler's policies, continued to favor immigration restrictions. 

There was sympathy, but they didn't want them here.  It's somewhat like today.  How American right-wingers are seemingly anti-Semite Zionists.

This isn't the case yet, but it does seem that it's going to be choked out in the name of combating "fake news" and/or anti-Russian "aggression".  Example, the teachers in WV and now in Oklahoma are using social media to organize and even circumnavigating their no-nothing unions.

Had he not done what he did, America would had a revolution.  It's the same reason they have to keep up appearances today.  To stage-off revolution.

> Nirvana was a good band with good songs, and Kurt Cobain had a decent voice. Pearl Jam was a good band with good songs, but Eddie Vedder has the best voice that a human being has ever had. Ever.

I completely agree. I loved Pearl Jam growing up and still do.  I actually never liked Nirvana.  I didn't dislike them, but I liked Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and Mother Love Bone way more. 

>Had Nirvana stayed together, I don't think they'd be as huge as they became after Cobain became a martyr.

Completely agree.
> If it did, they wouldn’t need to do PR stunts. We’d be beholden to them no matter what they did.

They have to maintain appearances to maintain the system, keeping up with the changing paradigm.  It's why Exxon tries to promote how they fund environmental initiative. Or why WalMart likes to donate to schools and advertise about it. If you don't you fall behind.

Especially with as much rampant inequality as we have now. Last time it was this unequal the Great Depression happened and there was a capitalist crisis. FDR literally had to convince the rich to pay a 94% income tax rate or else they'd probably lose it all through revolution. 

This isn't just Disney, it's a major American/Western cultural shift. [If you have a few minutes, this explains it well](https://youtu.be/hpAMbpQ8J7g?t=1m48s).  This cultural shift in consumption.  Charitable consumption. You're consuming more then just the item, but an ideology. These warm feelings are a means of sustaining capitalism. 
I can't see how government isn't (at least currently) an extension of them, when things are "too big to fail".  Which is my point.  Corporations do PR moves like this to make us feel good about them, as well as consuming. Their wealth controls our democracy, not the other way around.

> a private entity can fail

We live in a "too big to fail" world.  

>governments can’t be fired

In a democracy they can be voted out. 

We have to look at this from an angle that our current government, at least in the US and other parts of the West, are an arm of corporate interests. Hence, my "too big to fail" comment.  I have a problem trusting both at the moment, however I'd much rather something democratic rather than a private entity that's top priority is profit at all costs. 

>That’s not reliance because, in a free market, you can choose to support competitors if you don’t support one company or another.

This is a fantasy in our "race-to-the-bottom" economic system.  Especially in our current health insurance situation.  Many people, if they have insurance, can virtually only go to places they're covered.  So the free market is out the window.  Our medial industry is completely out of control.  

>They make family movies. It’s not funding terrorist organizations.

[They do a lot more than make family movies.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_Disney)  [They're #52](http://fortune.com/fortune500/disney/) on the fortune 500.   Besides, cultural capitalism itself undermines democracy.  It doesn't matter what that entity specializes in if they are assuming roles in this manner. 

I don't think I'm being over dramatic.  I think this is in a similar lens in the belief that corporate monopolies need to be broken up because that concentration of wealth undermines democracy.  
Right. That's how I am. I like Prince okay, Purple Rain, a few random other songs and the Batman Soundtrack. But disqualify quality music due to be alive is absurd. 
...and Prince.

...and Nirvana.

...and Motorhead.

(As someone who remembers Nirvana before Cobain killed himself.  I recall them being trendy.  However, I'd assume had he not, they'd be about as popular as Pearl Jam is now.)
You're not good until you're dead. 

I have a wide taste in music, but in all reality, how many people truly love both Prince AND Motorhead? 
> Is that a bad thing?

It can be for several reasons.  Dependence on a private entity rather than government in a democracy revokes democratic control over social welfare.  

It issue with cultural capitalism as a whole is that you are to believe that you're helping by consuming.  It's a false positive.  "Oh boy, if I watch Disney movies I'll be helping!"  When in reality, Disney is a mega-media conglomerate that undermines our democracy.

Expansion is the only valuable aspect of it, but that expansion relies on it's success. It's quite a conundrum.

Indeed, however, we still have the highest homicide rate in the western world. North Korea, Lebanon, Egypt, India and Bangladesh (among others) are lower.  The next highest homicide rate in the western world is Canada, 68 ranks lower (4.8 to 1.6 per 100,000)
I'm on the fence with these planned walkouts.

Positives: 

Solidarity and trying to force government's hand to do something.  Engaging in civic activism is impostant and shouldn't end once you can vote.

I love the idea that kids have realized that the adults who run this society seem to not care about them more then their wealth, which is a fundamental problem in this society. 

Schools allowing this shows support for their students.

Issues:

When protests are sanctioned and provided by authority, is it still a protest?  Is it still effective if it's only sustained for 17 minutes?  If government doesn't act will districts allow another protest? 

Inorganic, what's the protest about? If it's about gun control, fine but how many kids are just doing this for peer pressure?  

Gun control focus ignores the overwhelming issue of mass shootings and general rampant violence in this society. 

I suppose it's overall a good thing.  It's a step in civic engagement that is much needed in this country.  The argument "we can't vote" is valid, however it's not good.  People should protest AND vote.  Voting and that's it hasn't worked for the part 40 years.

Propaganda
People act like there's some sort of magic bullet for education (and like you say it's often commodified). However, it seems that people who learn best are those more comfortable in life, i.e. socially stable. You can sell iPads and VR robots all day, but that won't get people to find value in learning if it's not a cultural value at home.

You're making assumptions here:

2. There are equal policing of all ethnicites. [This is very open to debate](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/11/chokehold-police-black-men-paul-butler-race-america)

3. Police and DAs treat everyone equally. [They don't](https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/findings/) Blacks are much more likely pulled over and searched by police. 

>95% of people killed are men 

This stat is false.  It's 79% [source](https://ovc.ncjrs.gov/ncvrw2017/images/en_artwork/Fact_Sheets/2017NCVRW_Homicide_508.pdf)

Men are socialized to be violent.  Women aren't.  This "stat" if accurate helps prove that.  


Democratic ownership of production and the workplace. 
I do know that Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. was worried the impact she would have on his career, given her rebellious nature. He never visited her while she was institutionalized either. Rosemary's name "was never mentioned in the house" according to Janet Des Rosiers, Kennedy's secretary and mistress of nine years. 

I know this isn't a direct answer, but it seems he never appeared to feel guilty.  The family even allowed a rumor that she was too focused on teaching poor kids to be seen ride until JFK was elected President. 
Considering blacks are 13% of the population, IF your ratio is accurate , they're 2.5 times over represented.

>The Founders knew that slavery violated the “self-evident truth” of the Declaration and the promise of equality in the Declaration of Independence. They were aware of the immorality of slavery and the need for action, yet were—sometime by their own admission—not active enough. Despite this fact, some scholars portray the Founders as racists who on the principle of racial superiority theories sought to protect slavery and its expansion.

Jefferson actually promoted a potential idea that there was inherit inferiority between races and says races cannot co-exist.

To quote the late great George Carlin:

["The planet isn't going anywhere. We are."](https://youtu.be/nBbResOr5mo)

This planet has survived a lot. The end of the Permian Era killed 96% of all species. We have elevated the extinction rate over 1000 times the background level since the end of the 19th century. We've done so much in just 100 (hell even the past 20 years). Something will give, soon. Even if it's a 96% wipe out, which is doubtful... Here we are.  
I feel like every couple months a study comes out where atmospheric scientists have under predicted the toll of greenhouse gases.

Even shooing black people out of the restaurant if he didn't like how they acted. Once he got this couple to leave the told someone at they bar that "it's hard to keep this place classy". I witnessed this the same night I quit.

> I'm pretty sure we should just buy and do less until there's sufficient scientific breakthroughs to make consumption sustainable.

Or, we could abandon a ridiculous economic system that rewards wastefulness and mass consumption.  We don't need science to stop mass consumption.  Quite the opposite.  

We can't simply sit on our hands and wait for a miracle.  Science isn't going to magically fix it.  Even if someone invented something that did fix it, if it isn't profitable, it isn't happening. And even if it is profitable, it seems that establishment energy companies that cling to dirty energy, plastic companies that love one-use tossers, meat companies who want to make sure you think you're not having a true meal until something's flesh is the center-piece... nothing will change.  

Even if we did something, the wheels of the sixth extinction are in motion.  How do we stop all these wasteful things, plus fix 200 years of industrialization?  At best we will slow mass extinction, at best.  I used to think we'll figure it out, but I fear we will only as we're (humans, not other species because they are already screwed) truly free-falling off a cliff. 

I know it's not popular but, I think our only chance is communism.  Period.  Liberal policy got us here, it's not getting us out. This is the crowning factor as to why I'm a communist.  (If you plan on replying about Stalin, etc. please spare me.  Stain is dead and has been for nearly 70 years. There are other forms and theories.  Lenin wrote often about how something as such will need to be perfected and he was far from it.)  Humans have proven to be able to collectively act towards a goal.

I would talk to him.  Preface it that you are going to talk to him in a mature manner, and have a discussion with him.  He needs guidance on this regardless if he knows it or not.  Doing nothing is not helpful at best, and probably damaging.  A state of reality today is that kids watch porn at much younger ages now.  Since they're usually on their own when it comes to sex, porn can severely damage their perception of intimate relationships. You have to talk to him. 

Coming out with an ironfist and telling him to simply not do it probably won't work.  Level with him.  Talk to him about pregnancy, STDs, porn and how it's not typically reality (though it seems kids imitate it and now normalizing it).  If you want help, there's a documentary called [The Mask You Live In](http://therepresentationproject.org/film/the-mask-you-live-in/) (I believe it's on Netflix, if not PM me and I can hook you up).  There's part of it where they discuss how porn is damaging boy's abilities to have romantic relationships. Talk to him about it.  Watch the movie with him.  Level with him in that if he wants these things later in life, he needs to back off now.  

Last but not least, condoms.  People here are telling you not to, but you should.  You have got to talk to him about it because if dissuading him from having doesn't work, he has got to protect himself, and at least attempt to not impregnate someone.  I would do this, only as a mention.  Don't present it as a sex tip.  You could even say it like, "do you even know about condoms?!" so you're actually discussing it, but in a way that you're not suggesting he have sex.   

If you can, counseling would be ideal. Also, notify the others involved parents.  They need to have this discussion with their child as well. 
> She got her passion for gaming and anime from me.

I feel like my 5 y o daughter is turning into this.  One of her favorite things to do with me is play PS4. We play tabletop games as well. 

Since you're the one who got her into this, perhaps have her branch out into other interests.  Do you ladies play tabletop games?  If not, perhaps looking into getting her involved with that and finding friends through that.  I guess that's just an example.  My point is, branch out interests.  Anime...?  Perhaps get her in an art class where she can potentially find friends.  Video games?  Try to find a table top club.  
Let it ride.  See it as a chance for her to develop confidence, and strengthen your bond.  Think of it as her returning the favor.  

If you really want to maintain reading to her.  Try trading off. She read one, then you read one.  Perhaps read her something that's more progressed/advanced than what she's currently used to.

This is irrelevant, a larger population generates more wealth so it's all relative.

The sidewalk is actually more unsafe.  Most car/bike collisions are due to the driver not seeing the cyclist.  Drivers aren't looking for non-walking pedestrians on sidewalks.  You're more visible in the street.  

You shouldn't ride on the sidewalk.  It actually, probably illegal where you live.  Your child may even be safer in the bike lane too (considering the specific configuration of course). If a child is solo, then yes, they should stick to sidewalks, but taught (and only after you know they understand) to watch for cars in driveways, allies, etc. If a child is solo, then yes, they should stick to sidewalks, but taught (and only after you know they understand) to watch for cars in driveways, allies, etc.

Yes.  This man is an asshole. 

If your child is wearing a helmet they're all good. 
Godspeed.  Positive thoughts and vibes to you and yours.  It hurts my heart that you're in this situation.

I can't imagine all the anguish, but it sounds like you are doing what's best.  That doesn't make it easier, but in the long run you will look back and know it was right.  

Now you need to focus on you, which is that you're doing so for her.  You can do it.  Do what you can now, for the tomorrow that's better.  It will be, you just have to will it. 
I don't dislike it.  However, the only thing odd to me about it is it looks just like Obama's symbol. 
The sixth extinction 
The scary thing is how people are accepting of Bush simply due to comparison.

> tires, chains, and derailleurs

I always think this.  All that chain metal... I just recently got rid of my 1990 Cannondale M300.  Only because the frame finally cracked. I chucked it in my recycling bin. 
>The bill, introduced by Democratic state senators Frank Ciccone and Hanna Gallo, would require Internet service providers to automatically block all "sexual content and/or patently offensive material."

I wonder how much censorship falls under "patently offensive material".
I'm still riding my '06 Trek 2200. I love it. New group set... It's great.

>“The Russians accomplished what they wanted to accomplish,” he says. “They took our freedoms – freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, a free press – and they used them against us.”

We only do what we allow them to do.  They don't tell us what to believe, or how to believe it.  Articles like this make it sound like they literally have the power to tell us what to think.

Came here to make a similar point.

>Carbon fiber, for example, is increasingly popular for new bicycles, particularly racing bikes.

What percent of bikes manufactured do you think are carbon? 

>It’s also incredibly wasteful. Most people replace a racing bike every three years, adding to carbon fiber scrap, says James Marr, founder of the Bamboo Bicycle Club and a former wind turbine engineer.

This sounds like they're disposable.  This guy knows they aren't.  He's trying to sell bamboo bikes. 

>“We don’t as a society make much anymore,” says Marr, who says he was shocked by photos of thousands of unwanted bicycles dumped in cities across China.

This is a major problem.  China tried to decrease pollution with these shared bikes, and they were so poorly maintained, people just dumped them.  Which is understandable.  But to a laymen reading this, it almost implies these are carbon bikes.  

I like the idea of bamboo bikes, but they didn't have to attack other materials.  It's unproductive and hacky. 
Can I keep spreading non-Russian propaganda? 
Market research led to them to target baby boomers like this. 

Let's not invest in children and make an investment in something that loses its value the second you sign the paperwork. 
Don't like being held responsible?

Don't like it when reporters don't blindly ignore what you say?

Just say "fake news" and all these problems go away!  
Got this on PS4, the graphics are fantastic. 
So, they admit the flag is about slavery and not "pride/heritage/history/"
Paw Patrol... 

Paw Patrol...

Be there on the double!
They wanted to make a Southern state in the North.  They're getting it. 
This is why I can never wrap my head around how people can support leaders who support and/or are responsible for things like this.  Then have the nerve to sugarcoat their creation of hell on Earth. 

"Well... their war is defeating misogyny!  Sowing liberalism works!" 
Great UI, dev constantly updating and such.  It's by far the best. 
Reminds me of Klein Bikes. They always had awesome paint jobs.

Can't have that.  You may stop unconsciously consuming.

Fascists are okay, but not Russian trolls. 
I'm really racking my brain as to liberals' view of free speech. I fucking hate T_D, and Trump, and fucking fascists and their platforms. But, a year ago people (many liberals) were defending allowing fucks like Richard Spencer to speak and spread his hate. However, if you slap a Russian flag on it, people demand censorship. It's really confusing. Especially since [other countries do it and since it's not Russia, nobody seems to care](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-43211896). 
Society is paying credence to these idiots, yet they allow no leftist voice. Places have seemed to have seen it a mistake to have Slovoj Zizek on their shows because he was there and gone as fast as he came. 
Single digits. I think it's 4-6%
I can understand that. But, you got to do you sometimes too. 
I thought so too. 
10% vape

In the 90's over 25% of 12th graders smoked. 
> "We're here today with chief NASA director arguing that the Earth is in fact round, and the Chief Editer of 'Flat Earth Monthly' who contests this claim. We'll be reporting live on this controversial topic."

Just was discussing this with my sociology students.... a similar situation.  On CNN when they had a Neo-Nazi ("Alt-Righter) on to discuss if Jews were people. 
> Acting like both sides are always equal is a mistake of course

I don't know anyone who thinks they're equal.  However, I do see them as both being parts of the problem to varying degrees. 
It's still much less of a factor.  

Ten percent vape routinely today. In the 70's then later in the 90's, 25% 12th graders smoked.
