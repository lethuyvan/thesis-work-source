1:10 - oh that’s not too bad

1:15 - well that escalated quickly
If they’re doing solo albums why not be on the song alone? Shouldn’t this one go on the Rae Sremmurd album?
Probably not a high probability, but definitely possible. I’m 20 and a gay male, and my 16-year-old sister just came out to me as lesbian a few weeks ago.
We've been holding hands when we go to the movies, and I feel like he wanted to kiss when we were sitting in my car after one of the movies, but I wasn't sure and I was scared/nervous so I didn't do it :/
Thank you for all the suggestions, I used creddle.io for my updated resume, and I'll definitely check out the book. But yeah, I actually realized at my last interview, once I finished talking about the question they asked, I didn't know what to say for the few seconds until the interviewer stopped writing. I'll work on that too.
Thank you for the advice, I put an updated resume above, but left McDonald's for now (at the very bottom)... should I add a few more minor projects in place of McDonald's? I just figured McDonald's would somewhat help, showing leadership/teamwork, but I'm also not a recruiter, so maybe the projects would look better to them.
Thank you very much. What would you suggest putting in the summary? The career service people at my university always just said something along the lines of "Looking for a computer engineering-related internship for the summer of 2018", which I think sounds bad, because it's obvious that's what I'm looking for, otherwise I wouldn't be applying to those positions.

EDIT: Also, when you say academic products, not McDonald's... do you mean things I've done outside of class, or would I include large class projects/final projects that would show what I'm capable of doing?
Added
I've had a few friends as well as someone in Engineering career services look at my resume, and they all said it looked fine.

And the only interview prep I have done is studying some common behavioral questions, because my interviews have all been behavioral so far, and included questions where they wanted STAR responses.
I usually do manage my finances alright, but I'm in college and broke and have been hovering around $500 in the bank... until this unexpected car issue, which is going to cost me quite a bit
It’s all profit from crypto, I invested $1,000 and got it to $8,000. So I was willing to lose it, but it’s still sad to see it cut in half :(
I put $8,000 in when it was $3 though... I’m kinda panicking...
What would I say? Nothing has happened yet besides my employer giving the wrong check and the bank cashing it in someone else’s name, so I’m not sure what to do
I haven’t yet, my manager told me “he said he would bring in the cash”... I don’t know when that will be though, and I’m heading back to college tomorrow...
This isn’t from the USA though...
I second this
He's right, we haven't seen prices this low since yesterday! Quick, sell!    ^^/s
Damn, I'm only 20 and I used to play it in the 2nd grade computer lab. ^My ^school ^was ^poor ^^?

If I’ve gotten 34/50 on all 3 tests so far, and do about the same on the final, am I looking at around a C?
Slight curve? That’s like 70% for an A, right?

Ha ^ha ^^ha ^^^there’s ^^^no ^^^hope ^^^for ^^^me
He's in collage, not college
Too bad there's no verified checkmark, and a tweet like that would get more than 0 likes/retweets
I mean at the current pace, we'll hit negative values in 2018

Not looking forward to the 265 final now
One murder doesn’t make it a bad city, it’s only about half the average national crime rate, and less than 1/3 of the murder rate...

I wish it was a snow-covered moonscape right now, the mid-90's with dew points near 80 every day is really starting to suck
Friday 3pm update, warmer than expected, mid-70's and rising, Des Moines is as warm as Orlando, and it feels more like early June than mid February.
I should add that we've also had 3 severe storms (2 tornado producing) in the past two winters, also unprecedented in my life in Iowa.
.75 years or -1 years?
It won't go away!

^^help ^^me
"J" is for JOHN CENA
Hillary supporters be like "Bernie needs 58% per state to win, not possible"

*starts getting ~80% per state*
To be on track...

State // 538 "On Track" // Actual (As of 9:40 PM PST)

Florida // 45.8% // 33.3%

Illinois // 45.5% // 48.8%

Missouri // 49.3% // 49.4%

North Carolina // 46.7% // 40.7%

Ohio // 50.3% // 42.7%

I love Bernie, I do. But I'm starting to feel bad. He's already behind according to 538, and being not on track tonight will just make him more behind.
I said this about Michigan, and Bernie did it, so I gladly donated $100. Hope you get to as well ;)
[I can't phonebank today, but I made my biggest donation yet...](http://imgur.com/Qoj9qav)
Hey, I was a delegate there too, D51. Our table had 6 Bernie and 2 Hillary delegates.
This. 1 delegate might not matter much if it wasn't currently 50-50, but it is, so this should be looked into.
You have your gay professor's phone number?

EDIT: I understand sometimes teachers give out their numbers, a few of mine have as well. It was a joke and some people took it too seriously.

Bernie Sanders is much better, ~~no offense~~ actually yes. Check him out if you haven't already.
At the event I attended in Iowa, a lot of people didn't even RSVP. Bernie came a few minutes late and was surprised by the crowd of nearly 1,000 when he expected 200. They had to open up another room because it was too crowded.
My face sometimes contorts into a text post as well when I come up with an idea before it becomes popular
There's too many naysayers here who don't think he'll win, so they're saying he isn't gonna be the future president. Well, I don't care what mainstream media says about "no chance of winning," let's take Bernie to the White House.
I'm sorry, I wasn't aware it was an issue, and I was excited.
Definitely. I got a handful to come with me to see Bernie Sanders last night, and today we had a discussion about him in AP Calculus, so more and more people are starting to love him.
1) I'm not too young to vote.

2) Sanders can definitely win. The number of supporters he has keeps increasing while the number of Hillary's supporters keeps decreasing, and ~~he has more support than all of the Republican candidates~~ he is currently polling higher than any single Republican candidate. I'm actually very educated, more so than you it seems. Finally, the only thing I feel entitled to here is my opinion. At least you knew that I was a redditor. Have a good day!

**Edit:** Fixed
Yes, I'll be nearly 19 by the election.
Yeah, I'll turn 18 this December, so I'll be nearly 19 by the election.

If you play an hour or two a day, and are an average player, I would guess around a month.
[Like this 15 laffer with level 1 gags I saw on Sunday that was going for their Glad Hander promotion?](http://i.gyazo.com/8e9e617748f6798cf4207c944228b548.png)

I don't think so, they have many blog posts to go. It would be nice, though.
Yeah, why is it getting downvoted... it was great in my opinion...
People are arguing over the color of that dress, he made a joke with the title and slipped the dress in the picture.
[What color is this dress?](http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/28/business/28dress1-web/28dress1-web-blog427.jpg)

"It's white and gold" "No, it's black and blue"
Yes
The picture of the dress in one of the picture frames.
And it took me until just now to understand the title, it's 2 people arguing about whether it's PNG or JPG. XD

Hint: Look at all the pictures in Flippy's office.
Just keep playing and working your other cog suits/fishing/gardening/etc, you're gonna need the extra laff and all max gags when BBHQ comes out.
The only problem I've had with linking to Toonfest is that I don't know the hood name. For example, the golf zone's hood name is gz (can be found in the name, "linktunnel_gz_17000_DNARoot").

I've tried prop name="linktunnel_toonfest_7000_DNARoot", as well as prop name="linktunnel_tf_7000_DNARoot", but neither worked.

You could always just edit the model.
Are you logged in to the website? You have to be logged in first, then go there.

(Its also singular "cookie", if you've been trying "cookies")
With a cookie and a batch file
It's probably DNA/model editing or a private server.
Where?

[Edit: Still looks fake to me.](http://i.gyazo.com/0da2f906c9ffbcb3a79e7933f4326972.jpg)
Why did you cover your Toon?
unfortunately, yes.
He finished a 5 minute race in 6 seconds using DNA editing.
I'm only sitting at 120 laff right now, I maxed sell at the end of July 2014. I haven't encountered this "noob spam" you speak of. If it happens to you, can't you just ignore them?

The bottom line is this: you're considering turning off chat for everyone you meet, including your friends, because of a few cold callers every once in a while? Seems extreme to me.
No fishing laff, he's at 25.
I doubt it will, I've known about it since June lol
Why yes, yes it is :p
TTO: 118 laff in 10 years

TTR: 120 laff in 6 months
Aaaand it was announced today!
They showed a picture of that several weeks ago, so most likely.
yeah, took a bit of digging but here it is, from August 15: http://prntscr.com/5u7fr7
I also have my Sellbot one somewhere haha
This is why we can't have nice things
Minimus is 107, Maximus is 16... That's ironic
I use that phrase a lot in bullions, but for some reason many people don't know what it means and they call me rude because they think I'm telling them to use their fog.
He's just mad he only made it to 15 laff.
Black cats were available during Beta.
I'm not sure if it's considered a glitch when you use Cheat Engine...
