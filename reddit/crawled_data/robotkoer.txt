"Unneeded" is an irrelevant claim, every permission is needed for something. "Unwanted" is better, but still vague as it depends on the person.

I've found DigiCal to be a faithful alternative, though it's not open-source. Not sure if it *requires* Gapps to work per se, but it uses the calendars that sync with Android API, so you will need to find a way to make GCal sync regardless.

Mi Mix series from Xiaomi seems promising.
In their defense, the Oppo R15 has a pretty small bottom bezel too (compared to some), which is nice. However, they could've still done it the Mi Mix way - even with an earpiece on the top because it fits there - this blog post sounds like a defense of Oppo's design.
>The thing with secure contexts isn't that vague, it basically means new features will only be available over HTTPS and I guess every major browser will follow the same road there also.

I am aware of different config options being developed and released for optional usage. What I am wondering, though, is when will these changes get shown for all users.
Ah well, gonna post it to their GitHub then.
It is an interesting project for sure. Some feedback though:

* Why are you asking for location and storage on startup? Why are you forcing storage permission?
* Settings could use more visuals, like icons, grouping (sections), subtexts for explaining advanced features. For now all rows look the same, so it is very hard to scan for useful options.
* When I last tried this browser, I noticed several "deprecated" options. (Right now though, I only saw it on "kill process on exit".) What's up with that? If it is deprecated, you could disable the toggle and add a subtext for explaining why it is, or just remove it completely right away and note it in changelog.
* Presets would help less experienced users. For example, some common toolbar layouts, some common privacy options (incognito, anti-fingerprinting,  etc.), gesture presets... Maybe even expose the most wanted settings - such as dark mode - in the way Android 7+ settings do it.

Because it is a DP**1**. As different articles have pointed out, the visual changes they've made already seem to work towards having gestures.
But then the gestures are kind of pointless when many apps with a drawer nullify the back action. In my opinion the back action could be done from the *right*, as that gesture is empty most of the time.
I'd say it can be easily solved by swapping home and recents actions. Home could even be a FAB in recents if users get confused.

* Don't default to a blue icon, use an enlarged favicon or randomly colored first letter circle (like Contacts does for example)

>Big screen (5.7"+ preferred, 6" best), small bezels as possible 

Tip: phone screens aren't as easy to compare in 2018. 
The OnePlus 5T has a screen of 6.01" with screen ratio 2:1, which would translate to a 5.48" phone's width if it was 16:9. 

Similarly G6 has a screen of 5.7" which is about 5.2" if it was 16:9. 

Samsung makes things even more complicated as they give the navigation bar extra screen space, therefore Note 8's 6.3" is more like 5.62".

To better compare the screens, you can do some [visual calculations ](http://www.displaywars.com/) or just [compare the phones as they are](https://www.phonearena.com/phones/size).
If you are looking for no slowdowns, don't look for a Samsung in the first place. There are better options like Pixel, OnePlus, Nokia, Sony, Razer.

How is a phone being a flagship related to how new it is? And *what* exactly do *which* phones collect in your opinion? If anything, newer phones instead give users more privacy due to new features like [runtime permissions (6.0)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/10/android-6-0-marshmallow-thoroughly-reviewed/5/#h1) and [less background processes (8.0)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/09/android-8-0-oreo-thoroughly-reviewed/4/#h1), to name a few.

* Vibrate should be a DND mode, just like the three kinds of silent are. 
* Location settings should be respected in the quick settings toggle - if I use device only, don't switch it to high accuracy when toggled. Also would be nice if it is only enabled for a minute unless an app actively uses it (like how Bluetooth works).

Turned off location, NFC, auto-rotation. 

* Location because I can never be sure *when* it's enabled otherwise, surely I can toggle which apps get access to it in the first place, but not when they use it. 
* NFC because I don't have application for it now, and even when I will I don't need it 24/7. Would make sense to keep it enabled during the day only for example. 
* Auto-rotation because like other commenters claim, it is more of a nuisanse than not. It would be useful if it either looked at my eyes before attempting, displayed a confirmation prompt like iPad or just worked with more rotations in general (reading in a vehicle stabilization for example).

>Size Preference: 5.5 inch if normal phone, 5.8 is okay if samsung (because of the lack of bezels)

You've probably mixed up some numbers here.

When you mean 5.5 inch, you likely mean a standard 16:9 ratio used for most non-movie video, the one used in many phones before 2017.

However, when you mean 5.8 inch, I believe you are referring to Galaxy S8, which uses a 18.5:9 (37:18) ratio, which is even taller than most "full-screen" 18:9 (2:1) displays produced nowadays. 

Therefore, the Galaxy S8's screen is pretty much 5.18" (if it was 16:9), just some mm taller.

Not sure how other browsers handle that, but Firefox has a special site and feature to detect and redirect such pages.
Or close the tab, which works just as good.

Sounds funny, but is actually a valid reason. OEMs put their additions: 

* in big closed frameworks 
* at the expense (delay) of updates 
* without considering the UX of AOSP, but rather their own experience

[GMD Gesture Control](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.goodmooddroid.gesturecontrol) for infinite gestures that can use every action on your phone.
[GMD Gesture Control](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.goodmooddroid.gesturecontrol) is paid, requires root and optionally build.prop edit to remove navbar, but you will get infinite customizable gestures for lots of device actions, including launching apps. 

Or if you can't have any of that, try [AIOG](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.phoenixstudios.aiogestures) at least.
Why do you prefer it over Android (AOSP)?
That would still make sense only for DND and speech. 

Blue light filter is not useful when set only when you go to sleep (by then, something darker like lowest brightness would make sense) and alarm still activates for predefined time, doesn't matter when you enable it (unless you explicitly say the time, or course).
I meant automating with automatic triggers, which are built-in to the OS. 

DND can be automated by time or events, blue light filter can use fixed time or sunset, alarm can be set for specific days/times anyway. The speech would only need a specific app like Bixby.
Isn't it more convenient to automate all of this (except reading perhaps)?
There are some communities on Google Plus, such as [this](https://plus.google.com/communities/116821616252548925340).
The phones are different, but that doesn't mean the OS decryption method is.
But it has been worked around on unofficial builds, at least for 5T.
>The only other phone with as much community support is the Pixel, and that thing is out of my price range.

That "community support" feels more like some small tweaks and mods. I saw two custom ROMs for 5T available before any on Pixels (even though Pixels were launched earlier) and that surely says something.
No, I mean that when people install an app, they will very likely run it right away (even if they can't use it right away), that time could be used for showing ads.
Settings > Theme > White
They could place ads while the phone is *not* under 5% though.
My gripe is that Firefox didn't dim the notification bar, aka make it grayish, so it looks like an iOS app.
Wish there were some open-source dialers to choose from, so users wouldn't have to suffer this.
That is true, but a closed-down phone is still more water resistant than an "open" one, especially because you don't need to keep it in a certain condition (port cover closed for example). 

> Removable battery, so if it gets wet you can take it apart to dry.

Pretty sure that's not how this works, if the battery is wet the water has probably reached places it shouldn't, causing internal damage.
Don't have to buy from their site then.
If you have the whole year to wait anyway, why consider only two phones? Pick a month, season or event (if you know them) to wait for and you'll get lots of options for new devices.

I remember patiently waiting for a specific phone release but ending up buying something totally different 😉
Don't forget that it uses a non-standard (or new standard?) screen ratio. That means if you know what a normal 16:9 5.5" phone feels like in hand, a 18:9 6" phone will just give you a taller screen with same width. 

Whether you like that fact or not is obviously up to you though.
Xiaomi Mi A1
>How do you like it? Display and battery life are what I really care about.

The display feels more vibrant compared to OP3, though that may also be caused by me removing the screen protector for the very first time (and got some microscratches, oh well). The added screen space of 2:1 is nice, but the device doesn't feel "bezelless" per se. 

After a year of OP3 with OOS I got fed up with it, so I flashed 5T straight to OmniROM. One day I got to 35% with 7h SoT, so no complaints, could last for two days if needed 👌 

>I have a rant in this thread about OnePlus and stolen credit card info, so I will still be a hard sell. 

Yikes. Well, I bought OP3 from the site and 5T from a store, plus some accessories recently (from the site), and since my card was already stored there, it wasn't affected by the hack.
It is just a matter of promotion in this case, just like the tracking protection in Firefox. The real usefulness comes when you enable them for all browsing, not just "private" browsing.
Downgrading is almost always bad (security, drivers, performance), compared to upgrading to an official or unofficial ROM.
Bootloader, recovery, ROM swap, root, systemless tweaks (Magisk), ADB commands for some stuff, system-deep tweaks (Xposed). What else are you looking for?
Ooh, open-source is even better!
[Telecine](https://github.com/JakeWharton/Telecine) is also a good option, albeit not available on F-droid.
Developer edition gets new versions a few days earlier than beta 😛
It is rather about S8 dropping to 5T price, which is already done I believe. Either way, I'd say they cater to a different audience anyway.
What about Edge? Just for the lulz

[Snapped Padlocks](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/snap-http-padlocks/), for people who don't use FX59. [Breached](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/breached/), because people loved the reaction when something similar was proposed to be built-in to Firefox.
Just being E2EE to Lite and desktop, that would contribute significantly for making it a little less shittier.
>mic/push notifications 

Can you elaborate?
Well, for icons you can use [this](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-launcher.html) and for example wrap the flat share icon in a shape. For screenshots just take them again without device frames or with a newer device frame like Galaxy S8.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect
Judging by the Play Store listing, the app looks cool, but the icon and old device frames really ruin the impression.
OmniROM
A hoe in one of the snapshots behaved like that.
It is just a front-end for the built-in ADB commands (unlike some old ones that tried to open a hidden activity instead), so yes, it works even on 8.1.
Customizable world presets? Or make an old world, load it as much as you need, upgrade it to newest and modify it so it is the world type that doesn't generate land (forgot name).
Why not just make a function file? I believe most old mechanics can be replicated using current commands.
As someone who upgraded from 3 to 5T, I prefer the fact that I don't the front fps as a dust-collecting eyesore and can have some swipe gestures (Oreo custom ROM), but other than that I think that the screen would be still better because you will touch it afterwards anyway, why not start it by touching too.
Sometimes it stretches well to 2:1 display, sometimes it shows a white bottom bar. Also, I don't see a reason for hiding the notification bar, make it an option at least.
Any plans for publishing this in F-Droid itself? Would get a lot more exposure.
Weird, seems like this row doesn't exist for you. Why are you not using 57.0.3 though?
There is still a capitalized error code on the bottom of the error page, what does that say?
Not all apps that are outdated are dead, it depends on their purpose too.

From what it seems, you only lose the access to modify them, not the permissions themselves.

`browser.tabs.tabMinWidth` is the minimum width, but IIRC it goes down only to 50 px, so try `.tabbrowser-tab {
  min-width: 1em !important;
  clip-width: 1em !important;
}`
Why not make the Chrome on Android as powerful as it is on the desktop OSes though?
I used to use a self-cut Micro SIM in a phone where it was inserted sideways, like a SD card on some laptops. Didn't have any problems using the phone for 3 years. 

When getting an OP3 though, I replaced it with a pre-cut one just in case so it wouldn't get stuck or bulge in the "drawer", didn't want to mess up a new phone.
Substratum.
Use an app like [andOTP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp) instead, which supports encrypted backups.
You could try OOS with an unlocked bootloader. 

I got fed up with it after a year with 3 though, seeing how it started to look and feel much less like AOSP when moving from Marshmallow to Oreo.
A very easy workaround would be to use a legacy userStyle manager extension in the old version, so it will automatically not work in the newer one.
Not seeing the option, so no.
Looks great, especially since it seems to be associated with Qwant. 

>association with spammers 

That seems more like very bad experience or big stupidity by one person. Why not block `.com` too while you're at it, surely there must be some spammers using that.
I may be missing something, but I simply installed the app from ApkMirror and it ran without crashing.
Well, it lets you do the gesture on the top edge, so in that sense yes.
[This is the closest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clownface.volumeslider), but doesn't work as smoothly as it interferes with the top bar of the app.
`visibility: hidden;` `display: none;` `opacity: 0;` `width: 0;`

As long as you can target it (know the class/id), it should be doable.
[5T already has a 8.1 ROM](https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-5t/development/rom-omnirom-8-x-t3713775), though not *this one*, true.

Even lower than that. $499 for 6/64 and $559 for 8/128 GB.
Can you hide them somehow? You could [use these](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/%E9%87%91%E7%AB%8B%E9%BE%99/) as a replacement.

Simply right click and hide them. They are available in the 3-dot menu.

Firefox will only show tabs if your DPI or screen size is high enough, aka a tablet. IMO the best tabbed browser is [Peregrine](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marc.browse), but [Frost](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crowbar.beaverlite) is also worthy of a mention due to its unique way of managing tabs.
[Better use the original. ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=acr.browser.barebones)
I would much prefer sliding the status bar, but haven't found an app that lets me do that without interfering with that or the top area of the app.
From recents (Overview) you can do that by holding down the title bar of the app preview and tapping the info icon on the right. 

Might or might not work on LG UX, not too sure.
Have you tried opening the app info page for that? It should tell you the name, permissions (draw over other apps) and let you uninstall, among other things.
Maybe Samsung Dex? Though that is niche anyway...
OxygenOS has rounded corners for no reason. Luckily, a custom ROM fixes that.
Well, it has the width of a typical 5,5 screen, just is taller.
Focus makes sense indeed, thought it was something more hacky.
I wonder how does that differ from the second layer of skins, which do support transparency.
No. Try opening [YouTube TV](https://youtube.com/tv), start a video and switch tabs.
On the desktop browser?
I pasted it to the console and it didn't fix the problem :( It is probably YouTube using some other JS hacks to detect this besides the API.
By the description it seems to do exactly what I need, but it still does not work. I think it might be using some other JS hacks to determine this...

>Someone might even make a screen with a small dimple where the reader is.

Please no. I'd understand if someone wanted a screen protector or a flip case like that, but I would certainly not want a dynamic area to look different than the rest, that just breaks immersion.
Linkme: Brain Focus
I think the Gallery is the best app from OnePlus. It is simple, clean and functional. 

Only problem is that the design has gone downhill from 1.7.0...
I understand that there are many CSS approaches to this, but that popularity is exactly the reason why it should be built in. What do you think?
IIRC: 

* US carriers lock the bootloader completely 
* OEMs besides Google and OnePlus make you download or sign up somewhere to get it unlocked, that option may not be available on day one 
* Unknown chinese phones don't have option or support to do it 

I might have confused the SoC relevance to custom ROM support though, so root/recovery may be supported regardless.
I remember my support experience. 

1. Through conversation, but rep left randomly 
2. Rep didn't even start the conversation, left right away 
3. Got a good rep who answered all my questions
Selfies with back camera, always-on display are some ideas i can think of. 

To me it would actually seem useful if the screens were split, aka the foldable phone.
Nope, OEMs make it harder than it needs to be, and some OEMs/carriers don't let you do it at all.
Disable subreddit style?
I especially agree with the picture. In the old AMO, every extension had one, I don't understand why is that no longer a requirement.
Why not just claim that you want an unlockable bootloader? Or what else do you have against a specific chipset?
I see, that is certainly more compelling.
>stupid question: can you deactivate the finger print sensor on the E4 for multi-person usage?

Most phones support 10 fingerprints, which do not have to be from one person. Better register everyone's fingerprints than use no security at all.

>btw. the PLUS is only 9 € more

With that difference certainly get it.
Essential is probably easier to get in the US, but I would consider OnePlus 5T to be better value for the price.
LG V20 perhaps.
It seems very weird Mozilla allows anonymous users to *publish* extensions. I'd understand if they just let everyone to *sign* them, but publish? Come on.
Thanks, worked for me now too.
To me it sounded like a network/JS error, but if so many people see it, it might just be "not lucky, try again".
There are tons of immersive mode apps that don't require root or Xposed...
I don't think the design is *that* bad, only three things bother me: 

* No reason to use bottom tabs instead of top ones (even in those 5 new sections) 
* While it is nice to see the "Near me" feature more exposed, I think that tab should be used for installed apps instead, which is in settings now 
* The update mechanism seems buggy
There [actually is one](https://developers.google.com/vision/android/barcodes-overview) nowadays, built into Google Play Services.
[Here you go. ](https://www.thenophone.com)
RIP Ara.
Then again, many people don't even prefer software updates "because it already works". If only other phones adopted Pixel's dual partition system...
Yeah, but maybe OP wants a confirmation for accidental activations where it isn't too obvious that its on (daylight). Hence I suggested a better alternative to a prompt.
So why would the confirmation be necessary?
For add-ons, you could check their settings or make feature requests. For everything else, there is r/firefoxcss.
>Firefox on Android can use native app to scan urls directly to location bar anyway.

I knew I had seen from somewhere that this feature should be there, but never saw it myself. [Apparently just needs an app to work. ](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/scan-qr-codes-firefox-android)
Android Oreo has a proper fingerprint gesture API, on Nougat you will have to rely on hacks (misreads) unfortunately.

[See this thread. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/7in769/_/)
Have you considered making an extension for *scanning* them too? Would be useful for mobile.
>I personally would like a confirmation pop up when I turn on the flashlight as well, if this is here to stay.

Please no, flashlight is meant to be used *quickly*. If anything, it could use one of these to draw attention: 

* animation 
* toast 
* notification
Wow, even more bloat by Verizon. 

Anyway, if you enabled ADB on the device and downloaded it to the computer, you can try this: 

1. Open the folder where ADB is located, shift+right click > Open command prompt here 
2. Type `adb devices` and wait
3. You should get a prompt on your phone, check the checkbox and click OK 
4. Check if you see a small combination (8 chars I believe) of letters and numbers on the device list 
5. If not, retry connecting your phone with different modes (charging, MTP, etc.). You can change the modes in the permanent notification that appears when connected 
6. If it worked, continue with my 2nd suggestion on original comment
Who knows, follow this sub to see. 

5th is possible with root or Oreo.
There is one simple way to fix it, but is not implemented yet because legitimate sites still use HTTP. 

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1310842
Hence I linked to tutorial articles.
If you have Andromeda and Substratum, you don't even need root.
Sorry about that, don't have access to a computer at the moment and on Android it did appear on some about: pages, like addons. Shift doesn't work because WEs can't do something like that yet.
Yes.
By now there are at least 6 extensions that do this. The most feature-rich is probably Reloader.
Why would you want a phone with 256 GB internal storage, especially when you're using a microSD card? Surely the more, the better, but I just don't think it is something worth waiting for while it is not widespread.
Treble is not yet a guarantee for 3+ major updates, at least until an OEM actually proves us wrong. The 3T got Nougat and Oreo.
Why do you think an older Pixel will get more updates than a newer OP?
I agree, but *most*? I can only think of Ubuntu Touch.
> Why would I ever need my back button to go anywhere other than backwards in the app I have open?

So that you could easily go back where you came from.
There is an [Xposed module](http://repo.xposed.info/module/de.theknut.xposedgelsettings) that used to do this, don't think it works anymore though. [Screenshot](https://img.xda-cdn.com/iD2e_Br-R9Mp4BFmfUZyu_XgZ2g=/http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2FFhyekPr.png)
Oh yeah, I forgot that the proper API was added in Oreo, which the 5T officially doesn't have yet. 

So unless you want to use a custom ROM, you might have some luck with apps that rely on hacks (fingerprint misreads) in order to execute actions.

OEMs and custom ROMs have yet to prove that they can really release updates faster with Treble, while the 3T already has Oreo and a bunch of ROMs.
Huawei Mate 10 seems to be what you're looking for.

r/androidquestions 

However, there suggestions I can think of: 

* You could download a [keyboard APK](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/gboard/gboard-6-7-15-175732024-release/) to your computer and move it to the device with an USB cable, then install it from a file manager like Downloads. [Here's how.](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-install-apps-outside-of-google-play/) 
* Like previous one, but [install it using ADB](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7076240/install-an-apk-file-from-command-prompt). Here's [how to setup ADB.](https://www.howtogeek.com/125769/how-to-install-and-use-abd-the-android-debug-bridge-utility/) 
* If you have an OTG cable, you could hook it up and use a physical keyboard. 

As for the *why*, maybe you messed up a software update?
Better software too.
It would be much easier and more beneficial to 

1. Buy a domain 
2. Rent a host 
3. Use some shopping service platform 
4. Make sure the site is responsive (looks good on all devices) 
5. Make an app that simply wraps your site in a WebView 
6. Profit!
You can try an [app like this one. ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aecampos.android.fingerprintgestures)
>I'm not sure what those are.

Small colored rectangles in the corner of the extension icon, usually with a number inside to indicate something, such as amount of blocked ads. I can't remember if they work in the overflow menu, hence the question.
Looks great, I've been trying to do the same but haven't got it to work so far. It is sad though that you need to define the exact rows and columns, so it isn't as flexible as Chrome's menu. 

Some questions though: 

* Do badges work? 
* Why not use `em`s for better screen independence? 
* Can I [republish this here](https://github.com/Timvde/UserChrome-Tweaks)?

A pinned tab for [YouTube TV](youtube.com/tv) with [YouTubeAUDIO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/youtubeaudio/).
I guess then we can do what Vivaldi users do, aka just modify the browser HTML itself to make it accept injections from a file.
>volume slider works well but no customization options 

Fair enough. Stock DND tile and timers are present though?

I was thinking of [something like this](https://androidcentral.com/how-adjust-lg-g6-app-scaling-settings), though I don't know if it is even necessary to have. 

>magisk works perfectly 

Great! Latest or specific (14.0, I've heard)? 

>there's a dark ui option 

Eh, I don't want everything to be dark though. I was thinking about [this feature](http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/10/25/android-8-1-feature-spotlight-automatic-light-dark-themes-no-longer-exclusive-pixel-2/) being configurable. 

>There's no OP5T specific customizations in general. 

That's great, I won't really miss the OOS looks and bugs, features can be replicated somehow anyway. 

>The main benefit of switching to this from OOS is oreo (obviously) and a proper navbar. 

Oh yeah, that reminded me - is there a built-in toggle to disable navbar completely? I much prefer using gestures to navigate.
Some things I am wondering: 

* Are the volume slider ("mute switch") actions customizable? 
* Do 16:9 apps fall back well? Any settings for that? 
* Have you succeeded in using a root method? From the thread it seems neither SuperSU or Magisk work yet.
* Is there an option to switch notification shade to black?
Nice! While it is not completely stable yet, I like that it gets daily updates, even if the porter doesn't have the device. 

https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-5t/development/rom-omnirom-8-x-t3713775/
For what it's worth, there seems to be an [Oreo custom ROM](https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-5t/development/rom-omnirom-8-x-t3713775) available though, that gets more stable every day 

Edit: [a reddit thread ](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/7iamhw/_/)
I was considering the two, so I made a list of my pros for each device: 

OP5

* sharper corners
* stockish, ROMs
* available in physical shops (for my area)
* lower initial price 
* slimmer side bezels
* 6/8 GB RAM
* dual SIM guaranteed
* no glass back
* Dash Charge

V30

* QHD
* good battery life 
* should go on sale soon
* slimmer top/bottom bezels 
* SD-card
* no silent slider, FPS is a button
* looks rather like an S8 than an iPhone 7
And how many people actually did it?
I don't disagree, but my point was the misleading title.

I do like the tab management, reminds me of the Frost browser. But unlike that one, the UI seems to take up so much space, even though it hides after scrolling. I just hate browsers with extra bottom toolbars ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Now? They already announced that they will stop doing it.
As it is still not mentioned in the issue: 

On 59 Nightly, you can now mark all HTTP pages as insecure. For that, set the following on `about:config`:

* `security.insecure_connection_icon.pbmode.enabled = true` for private windows only 

[Bug 1310447](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1310447)
How are any of these relevant to *this* app though? 

* Checking for a license uses a different permission 
* Pretty sure you can track user count from Play Developer Console
Why make the tabs so small if they are centered anyway? 😀
I had a look at some root videos where TWRP is shown and I can't really understand if it is rounded or the video is blurry. [Here's an example](https://youtu.be/dseDcaKOEt8?t=1m10s), perhaps someone with a bigger screen can confirm.
The apps that provide rounded corners simply add an overlay to the screen, it is not related to a hidden setting or such.
The interface looks interesting. 

I like that the address bar is so compact, yet fits a lot of the URL. The bottom bar seems like a waste of space though, which could be replaced with a single FAB if anything.

You seem to like 4K phones a lot. What do you watch on them? AFAIK, there isn't even much VR content on 4K...
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wire
Yes, but right now it is a marketing term for 2:1 screen ratios, that create a slightly smaller bezel as a result.
It will make sense eventually, when phones lose all of the bezel. But yeah, for now it is just because every other OEM does it.
128 GB Pixel 2 XL costs $949 on Google Store.
Time and money. Why bother on supporting Treble on 5T now when you can do it on 6 later?
It would probably be the easiest to compare it to how Windows compares to Linux-based OSes. 

* With **nothing/Linux** you lose things that were implemented *using Play Services/for Windows*, even though they could just as well be implemented without it, which would need more work. For example, notifications in most apps. 

* With **MicroG/Wine**, you get the features that were reimplemented using open-source code, therefore the newest, coolest stuff may not be implemented at the moment. For example, Play Games perhaps? (haven't used MicroG yet, cannot confirm) 

* With **Google Play Services/Windows** you get the most and latest features that were implemented using closed-source code and work with proprietary environments *(Google/Microsoft servers)*. Therefore, apps that take advantage of the latest APIs.
I agree. It is much better to use gestures that don't depend on absolute position (switching tabs, opening the drawer) than to be forced to find specific buttons to press.
>Your hand is always shifting up and down because down is where all the buttons are anyways.

That means we need even more gesture input, (ironically) like Apple. 

>Next up: moving the Windows taskbar to the top of the screen, where virtually all the toolbars (most notably the browser stuff) are.

What about Mac, Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora etc)? Not the task bars (docks), but navigational elements are on top.
Wire doesn't, you can sign up from a computer too.
Makes me wonder why the X-Window system does this, I can already see lots of miscopying due to accidental text selection. 

Anyway, for address bar I can think of a workaround, which could be made to an extension: create a new tab and close the old one. For search bar, I'm not sure.
Then you can use a keyboard that can detach and hover.

I would like to finally [hide https:// and show http:// on the address bar.](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1379247). I'm glad the [broken lock preference has been implemented](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1420752) to 59 though.

There is a WE of the same name though. Also, [an alternative](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/display-inline/).
In that case install a messaging app of choice (would suggest something encrypted like Signal or Wire), add your contacts to it and turn the device to a kiosk mode with [App Pinning](https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/6118421?hl=en).

Why have a tablet for just one purpose when you can use the phone the kid is already familiar with?
The biggest drawback IMO is the do not disturb mode not being accessible outside the slider, including no automation.
With Fleksy, you can swipe for space anyway...

Well, I understand decoupling stuff like the bubble, WiFi rating system and Google's compression servers, but something as simple as a full mobile data disabling toggle should be built-in.

It does, because it was implemented under that same setting.

Quoting [comment 124](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=967895#c124):
>I think it's a bad idea to advertise this to the general public, because you have to enable the "privacy.resistFingerprinting" pref for this to work. A lot of people are unaware of the consequence of enabling this pref: the UA is spoofed to Firefox 50 (hence AMO thinks you can't use webextensions), timezones are spoofed to UTC (which can be annoying on Calendar websites), ...


>If advertising this feature is something that's wanted, then the feature should probably have its own preference.
From the screenshot it looks like just a blue background and old bookmark folder/search-thing icons. One could just use a lightweight theme for the background...
So it will get a separate, default-on setting? Based on what info, [the bug doesn't state that](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=967895). 

Right now it is available under `privacy.resistFingerprinting` which does (and breaks) a lot of things, so I doubt it will get enabled by default.
>Well the 3T had quite minimal side bezels to start with. It was the upper and bottom "lips" that were massive.

True, but 5(T) has a different shell, hence the question.

It surprises me, because they are *not* Chrome. They are Chromium, which is open source. 

So if Chromecast is there, I assume one can take a look at its implementation and attempt to port it over. Or search the web for an old version which used to be an extension by itself (though I'm not sure if an "independent" one).
As of 8.0 it needs an app, I remember there being an option for 8.1 though. 

Personally I just set the priority to low, because it is good to keep an eye on things that should not be there (for example, I found an accessibility service that I didn't actively use, but it kept running in the background anyways)

Search bar is hidable from the cog menu, the Firefox icon is

It is a must for every device that wants to ship with Oreo and get Play Store.
Use the [Extension Source Viewer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/crxviewer/) to view that info before installing.
* Launcher: [Smart Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ginlemon.flowerfree), because I prefer to keep apps organized in the drawer.
* SMS: [Signal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.thoughtcrime.securesms), because it has a pretty stock-like interface while also supporting one of the most secure IM platforms.
* Gallery: [OnePlus Gallery](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/oneplus-ltd/oneplus-gallery/) - is a stock app for me anyway, but I like it because it does everything I need and looks pretty. I prefer [1.6.0](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/oneplus-ltd/oneplus-gallery/oneplus-gallery-1-6-0-release/).

No, because people will start to overuse it to make their builds more realistic and less blocky.
I wonder if they will do a Christmas sale on accessories too. I want a 5T but not *today*.
And that is why they won't add them.
I feel like the opposite. The phone and it's animations feel much smoother.
Well, with a referral you can basically get an extra charger+cable for free, so it is a pretty good deal.
I can't seem to understand why does it use the same color for toolbar and status bar on Android though. Especially since the UI does not look the same on iOS anyway. 

Luckily, [a theme like this](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/transparent-only/) fixes that.
Something not mentioned in the issue, but I think is notable: a preference that would mark all HTTP insecure, [is now in active development](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1310447).

uBlock's default settings block more than just ads though. Can't remember exact defaults, but I think it was social media buttons,  Bitcoin miners, malware and analytics collection.

Well, you could also consider it as an easier way to bypass the check.
I don't recommend hiding all of them, they can be useful for security and accessing site features. Here's how to hide the less useful ones: 

* To hide the certificate name, try [one of the solutions posted here. ](https://superuser.com/questions/751720/how-do-you-hide-the-extended-validation-text-in-firefox)
* To hide Pocket and bookmark star, right click them and select "remove from address bar"
[With this app. ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iboalali.sysnotifsnooze) I just held the notification down and changed its priority to low though.
"Screen calibration" under display settings.
>You just have to swipe once, the api exposes 4 directions; up, down, left and right.

I meant for continuous brightness change, like with volume keys you can hold down to keep changing the volume.
>FingerPrint Gesture API

TIL, looks promising!

In terms of your app, I have a few questions too! (Don't have a compatible device yet) 

* Just to confirm, does the user have to swipe repeatedly or can they just slide the finger?
* Is that "docking" feature multi-window, [exposing a hidden feature](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xda.onehandedmode) or you are just talking about moving the on-screen slider around? 
* From the app description I got an impression that one can map actions other than brightness to swipes. Is that true? I would like to see media volume controls, for example.
It's irrelevant even if you don't. It is comparing the existence of feature to an absence of a feature.
[I'm struck with the bug](https://askubuntu.com/questions/969762/black-screen-random-log-out) where the system logs out randomly, so not that big of a fan for 17.10.
The top bar reminds me of Chrome when it had an option to combine tabs with apps... I would love to get that feature in Firefox! 

The bottom bar seems unnecessary to me though.
No, in AOSP you can click the title on some tiles to open a panel, like in Lollipop/Marshmallow. 

http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/21/android-o-feature-spotlight-expandable-quick-settings-work-tapping-text-not-icon/
Nice! Now that I saw the introduction text: 

* "Read *carefully*"
* You could adjust all input fields to not accept keyboard input and show a toast message as a warning.
Well, it is worse in terms of features/speed becauze it is an old version. But compared to stable 56, ESR 52 will recieve security updates for several months.
There are several apps in Play Store that add quick settings tiles, this is often one of them.
Seems like it allows only specific apps to be parallel though 😞
Crouching for blocking makes sense, but I don't really see a reason to nerf offhand. 

From what I've seen, PE already has a "left click" and "right click" - left is a long tap and right is short. I assume a similar thing goes for other platforms, like console, too.
By adjusting it's margins and width with CSS. 

[This is what I use](https://github.com/Madis0/UserChrome-Tweaks/blob/c4095a881bd4958acba564fb40c8fb6f052b7c1b/navbar/merge-tabbar-navbar-linux.css) - it moves the whole navigation bar to the left of the tabbar.

I'm not exactly sure how to get it on the right though, you could try swapping a few `margin-left`s with `margin-right`s.
You can't move the urlbar by hand. You either move the buttons around it in the same toolbar or the toolbar section itself.
Pretty sure it requires YouTube Red. Try it from a browser.
>No sensible person should be looking for a new phone after only 7 months of ownership.

I think of it as a good business deal. Sell it while it's worth a lot in order to get a new phone "cheaper".
[Here you go.](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefoxcss/comments/7dclp7/_/)

In any case, do NOT use Firefox 56 as it has security-critical bugs, better use ESR 52 if needed.
I've liked Moto Camera in the past, as it's simple and can work without a shutter button. 

Also, OnePlus Gallery 1.6.0 (later versions look less Material) is a minimalistic gallery app and its UI reminds me of Google Photos.
Try Firefox. On slower devices it is definitely faster than Chrome.

Something's up with the default locale.

Other than that, here's my feedback: 

* Animations are a bit too slow in my opinion, gets annoying 
* It doesn't bring enough nostalgia if half of the UI is old and half modern. IMO you could just do two themes: IE6 and mobile Chrome - so one looks old and bloated, another is convenient and simple 
* Changing the date is harder than it needs to be. Bring a proper timeline for modern and maybe a Win95 slider for old. 
* Add a way to disable sending user's bookmarks to you 
* Add pan and zoom
Optic AMOLED has been their marketing term for a long time now, "Full" is just the 2:1 screen ratio.
It is located on https://start.mozilla.org/firefox/ but you might need some tweaking like using a cached version to get it to work.
[Somebody has](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/re-style/), but the problem is that this extension requires the Stylish format with proper declarations and barely any userChrome.css tweak has that so far (of Quantum, of course). 

If you edit userChrome.css through [Browser Toolbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Browser_Toolbox), the changes will appear live.
[There is a new page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Preferences/Preference_reference), but that is also very partial.

That is correct. I feel like the OP3 is strong enough on its own due to materials used, so I don't need a case.

Great! But what if the friend is in another country compared to what I will make a purchase from (ineligible one)? 

Edit: confirmed from support that this is not a good idea, can cause delays and other problems.
You will need an extension for one of them, as CSS can't duplicate elements (the application button of CustomCSSforFx is a reskinned and moved hamburger button). [Perhaps you'd like this? ](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/application-menu/)

Anyone know if they care for the name used? Aka, can I use a student friend for this? ☺
Well, it would be good to have, but I expect it to have some good ROMs regardless.
Now they could include it in OOS to make consumers be more aware of it.
IMO the camera bump is fine if the rest of the phone is thin enough to be held with small hands. 

Yes, I know you all would fill the space with battery, but if you can't hold the phone comfortably, you won't use it for long.
That is what I read from the website, yes. 

I got confused by your text: 

>Damn... 70€ disc would be awesome. :(
That's because the architecture for building extensions changed greatly (for the better) and it is a matter of new abilities, time and motivation for them to remake their entire extensions. 

Good news though: 

* NoScript will get ported very soon 
* Tab Mix Plus and Tab Groups are planned (but individual features can be done by other extensions too)
* Cookie Monster may be replaceable by other cookie-management extensions 
* There is a proper sidebar API now, so All-In-One Sidebar panels could be made too, as individual extensions
Wait, what? I thought referrals don't reduce the price but give you accessories of a specific value?
>It does nothing for the Firefox's core browsing functionality 

I agree, the only integration seems to be the adding button, it doesn't even display the items in the native UI. 

Though it is planned for the Library menu, I feel like it should also be integrated to bookmarks bar in some way. Or a sidebar...
Well, [there is this](https://github.com/Aris-t2/CustomCSSforFx) by the creator of CTR. It lacks a GUI though, all changes are done by enabling specific files.
The screenshots show it is used for "audio output". Not sure why is that needed so much it needs a permanent location in the UI...
Your `!important;` lacks a semicolon.
You'll need an extension that replicates its feature.
>Wouldn't it be cool if the "addons" system for quantum firefox

https://mozilla.github.io/extension-finder/
Okay, I've got an example for you. 

```#PanelUI-button {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0.1em; 
}``` 

Replace `#PanelUI-button` with the back and forward elements, if you don't know them, use Browser Toolbox to find out.
Not sure if you understood, but I meant moving the individual buttons with CSS, using the spacer only as a place to move them onto. Can't test/make an example at the moment unfortunately.
Hell yes. I am glad Apple executed the gestures well, can't wait for OEMs to copy that.
GMD is good too, and doesn't require Xposed.
Well, you might test this more to confirm, but in my experience every "delivered" message seemed to be also read by the recipient.
>However, there's no read receipts with this client, making it difficult to know if my wife has received a message. There's also a weird loading screen when first loading the client. No other messaging client has to "load" before opening up my messages.

The word "Delivered" next to the message is the read recipe you're looking for. The loading may be caused by decrypting messages cached to the device.
That doesn't stop them from emulating a toolbar.
What makes it so ugly then? The icons are similar, the animations are similar...
>Download Status Bar 

>FindBar Tweak 

Pretty sure they can be ported, don't know if anyone has started to do so, though. 

>Tab Wheel Scroll 

Can't be ported yet, but [this is similar. ](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wheeltab/)

>Tabs on Bottom 

Search in r/firefoxcss
Now is also a good time to ask the devs to port them.
Stylish doesn't handle userscripts, rather try Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey. But now that Greasemonkey is WE by itself, you might not need any alternatives.
>The address bar needs to move up, which it can't because like I said the address bar won't move into the bookmarks bar...

Right, that's what I forgot. 

One idea I came up with would be adding a dynamic spacer to the bookmarks bar and moving the back-forward buttons with paddings and fixed property.
I meant moving the bookmark elements, not the toolbar.
What if you just move bookmarks to the navigation bar?
>firefox is no better addon wise 

That is incorrect, even now Firefox has different APIs to take advantage of, such as sidebars, theme features, find in page. 

But if you must, r/waterfox or ESR 52.
>Don't install random .debs 

>Don't install random ppa's 

>Don't install random tar.gz, git repos 

So don't install anything from outside Software? That suggestion won't satisfy most users.
Perhaps you could just try some full-featured RSS reader?

Chances are your extensions are easy to port, just ask the developer (assuming you switch from another browser).
It is made by Xiaomi, so yes, seems likely. I know that the original Mi Mix got LineageOS too.
Can't remember actually, the maintainer posted it here very long ago. Could try requesting permission for access though.

Yes, at least until the developers choose to port them to the new system (if at all). You can use [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TFcEXMcKrwoIAECIVyBU0GPoSmRqZ7A0VBvqeKYVSww/edit#gid=0) to find alternatives to at least some of your extensions.
Depends on whether they have the Legacy tags.
[This community spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TFcEXMcKrwoIAECIVyBU0GPoSmRqZ7A0VBvqeKYVSww/edit#gid=0) has lots of alternatives for popular extensions. It is unfortunately locked now though.
What is up with EME-free builds? Aren't all builds EME-free until the user has accepted to download it (the notification infobar)?
Simply adjust your toolbar so that every button fits to window? That's the only purpose of that button, showing buttons that don't fit.
If you truly want Android's flexibility and custom ROMs, you should pick a device that supports them well. Samsung and LG surely aren't those. 

You could search XDA forums and Lineage OS' list of supported devices, but just to give an idea of some good OEMs: Google (Nexus/Pixel), Lenovo (Moto), OnePlus, Sony, Xiaomi.

It is resolved because [there is a Find API now](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/find).
The most reasonable explanation would probably be that Firefox has the settings for toggling those as a legacy feature, but in reality, [you still couldn't enable them anyway. ](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/npapi-plugins)
Chrome bundles Flash, true. But Firefox doesn't bundle any kind of plugins, even for EME it asks you if you want it before installing.

Regardless, neither browser support QuickTime, Real Player or Microsoft Silverlight anymore so there is nothing to disable, the content won't play anyways.

Maybe the sites you use have just moved to HTML5?
It is currently the latest beta version, but soon it will be the latest stable version.
>If you find what I've found, you will discover that Firefox continues to load plugins for profiles that you may have deleted years ago, and for software that you may have uninstalled for security or other reasons.

That makes no sense though. If it is deleted, there is nothing to load.
I think even the Samsung's fingerprint scanner position is well reachable.

Doubt it. If they truly wanted to help, they could become a contributor to help in the official channels, instead of setting up a shady phone line.
>Motorola: no announcements but every phone theyve released including the last one days ago has a headphone jack

> I can't know before the update if my extensions are getting updated

Well, you can't know if they will be updated *eventually*. You can, however know if they work *right away,* and that is what you can work on if needed.
Enable hardware buttons and install an overlay for launching apps? For example, [this one.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farmerbb.taskbar)
I truly hope this will include [mouse event support](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1246706), that can cover a lot of use cases at once.
[The Forget button. ](https://support.mozilla.org/ee/kb/forget-button-quickly-delete-your-browsing-history)
If an extension does something that should not be done in private mode, it should implement measures to fix it.

For example, Smart HTTPS logs HTTP domains but has an option to disable that on private mode.
I have collections for [Material](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/tulirebane/material-personas/), [Windows](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/tulirebane/windows-personas/) and [transparent](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/tulirebane/transparent-personas/) themes, perhaps you like one of those designs?
What if every unreviewed addon was marked experimental until it has been reviewed? (+ those where the dev chooses to mark their extension experimental)
This is my first Firefox extension and one of my first attempts to use Javascript. I wanted to share it because the idea is kind of unique and it is probably the first extension on AMO to use the [Find API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/find).

>Actually it is Chromium. With custom GUI. Currently we are early Alpha and plan major rewrite with Miniature One.

I see, but it will still take years to complete, especially for a small team. 

>I think 5 tabs in a row is far from *information overload* but if you like call it *user interface overload* . Which it isn't. :) Practically, these context switchers appear very useful when you actively work with and organize information.

Surely they are useful when the user needs and wants them, but feel like bloat when they are forced upon them. 

>We will improve these recommedations drastically, also make it adaptable to user (age, e.t.c)

My point was rather, why bother at all? Do you have any statistics for seeing that they actually help users? 

>Apart from *original* Miniature GUI we will ship optional, [conform](https://i.imgur.com/miAHYYn.png) view.

Hmm, okay. Could use more icons instead of text.
Seems like [this exists](https://github.com/chintown/monocle). If you create an issue and ask the developer nicely, they may be able to port it to Firefox ;)

Since Firefox has sidebars, I imagine it could work even better than on Chrome, as it doesn't have to inject anything to the page, just scroll it on click.
One big problem I see is that the [official site](https://mozilla.github.io/extension-finder/) still has much less alternatives than the [community version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TFcEXMcKrwoIAECIVyBU0GPoSmRqZ7A0VBvqeKYVSww/edit#gid=0) (now locked, apparently).
> Miniature

Reviewing your browser, I've come up with some feedback and questions.

1. Why didn't you base your browser off a popular one, like Firefox or Chromium? It is pretty hard to compete in 2017 with a featureless browser, even if you use someone else's engine. Or you just want to make it as small as possible?
Edit: just realized it is based on Min. Still, the question remains.
2. Talking about *information overload*, your browser unfortunately has plenty. 
  * At least 5 tabs and tab groups are forced, even if empty
  * Tab groups itself is forced, it is still a niche feature that most users either don't need or don't care enough to use
    * The Overview sidebar button-thing takes too much space - I see that you did it for visual consistency with the buttons above, but why not make the menu a menu and tuck a menu item for opening it inside? The menu could also be used for other things that are evident by keyboard shortcuts but have no visual clues (buttons) in other UI.
    * A catalogue of your recommendations of pages to visit. It is 2017 and we, users know what to visit and know how to get things we don't know exactly (search engines). Better replace it with user's bookmarks.
3. I found a bookmarking star, but not a way to show bookmarked pages.
4. The icons appear grayed out at all times. Maybe add some saturation on hover?
5. There seems to be a concept of "private tabs", but no way to view/clear history on normal tabs.
6. The menu bar doesn't work on my Ubuntu and I'm not sure if the swipe navigation should work on non-touch devices, no description about it.d
>User may want to see title instead. Like me :)

I've been thinking about this for long, surely the title looks prettier than an URL (I know [some](https://minbrowser.github.io/min/) [more](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crowbar.beaverlite) browsers that use this approach), but it is much more important to see the URL because of phishing. And no, showing just the domain (Safari) won't suffice, because bad sites can host themselves on good or good-looking domains.
I think that the browser UIs are still way too large. 

Sure, we've gone a long way removing pointless buttons, menus, search bars while also adding tabs that are more powerful than ever. Tabs on top is a great thing, cheers to Chrome for popularizing that.

However, why stop there? There are still lots of things to simplify and screen real estate to gain. 

* First we could [merge the tabs and address bar like IE does](https://www.eightforums.com/attachments/tutorials/33126d1386579570-internet-explorer-11-synced-tabs-open-windows-8-1-a-desktop_ie11_new_tab.jpg), just without the pointless titlebar. 
* Going a step further, why not merge the address bar with the active tab? You don't need to see the title when you see the page itself, like mobile browsers.
* The extra toolbars. Bookmarks bar could be just an entry of the autocomplete popup, maybe even appearing before you type (just focus the address bar). The find bar could be an address bar search engine, for example accessible by *f (keyword)*. [It could even autocomplete!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spot-better-find-in-page/bbpdiffmmobnnngmfigpgddgjpgjgbol)
* The smaller stuff. Let's [get rid of the green locks and space-wasting "https" in URL, just mark http as insecure](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1310842) and be done with it. A bit more advanced, but we could [remove back-forward and use the height of the monitor](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/milewideback-webext/) for navigation. Page-related things could appear in the address bar (like modern browsers do already, but downloads too), user-added (extensions) will appear in the toolbar, moved to where the user wants to see them ([or even to the main menu, like Chrome conveniently lets you do](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/UdrwjzoUgXDj2buee86jAdZs3FiMMsjwLx1m2Vc2fT5dre-QyxcHeADReI73GEEgYXl5aBZ-OY8v_2cywnK27XnY3NHWwJ4ewlkoZzE8LtGuat0QLfkZBGpbqHhJ3OnEioCDKlWH)).

> I should have just waited :/

Why so?
Perhaps it is a script that can be blocked with uBlock Origin? As I haven't seen that so far.

There are many alternatives, [such as this](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/contextual-search/).
>example.com is HTTP only 

No it's not, HTTPS is just optional at the moment.
[WheelTab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/wheeltab/) is the closest you can get, but you might also want to try [MileWideBack](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/milewideback-webext/).
I would rather ask you some questions back instead of making the decision for you.

> Violentmonkey vs Greasemonkey (the beta version) 

Oh cool, the beta version is already out! More mature as a WebExtension vs bigger name/dev team?

> Decentraleyes vs Local CDN

More popular and bigger development vs small fork with more CDNs (as you say)?

> HTTPS Everywhere vs Smart HTTPS (revived)

Crowd-sourced and tested rules vs trying HTTPS on literally every site (ironic name swap, haha)? [See](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/766hs9/how_many_securityprivacyadblock_extensions/dobrnmf/) [also](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/5qnq6j/time_to_stop_recommending_https_everywhere/).

> Link Cleaner vs Neat URL

Primarily popular sites/parameters vs configurable and more global?

> Stylus (beta) vs Website Theme Manager vs reStyle vs xStyle

I would only consider the Stylish forks, as the other two are too barebones in my opinion (why not use userContent.css at that point?). Though reStyle seems to support UI styles, if you're into that sort of thing. In my opinion it comes down to more popular/more features (Stylus) vs subjectively prettier UI (xStyle)?

> Unload Tab – Tab Suspender (Tab Unloader)

Haven't used (needed) either, judging by what I see on the AMO page/code. More lightweight vs more popular?

> Also: Is No Cookies For Old Men needed when using Cookie AutoDelete?

No, because the first attempts to limit the cookies and their expiration while the latter just deletes everything from a site.
Didn't have a 2:1 screen, so didn't see a reason to upgrade.
> 1 VAB (virtual action button).

[Floating Action Button](https://material.io/guidelines/components/buttons-floating-action-button.html).
The lightweight themes Firefox promotes are certainly safe, they are just images with some displaying parameters. 

The legacy full themes, however, can change the UI elements directly, therefore you may have security/privacy concerns when the HTTPS icon looks unknown or missing, for example. But these themes will be deprecated with Firefox 57 anyway (probably still work in Thunderbird).

>For example, when I tried installing [TT Deep Dark theme](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/tt-deepdark/) in Thunderbird, a prompt appeared saying that I should only [allow/install addons I trust](https://i.imgur.com/ZJ4RYg8.png).

That is a standard warning for all Thunderbird extensions and previously Firefox's too. Good news is that with the newest Firefox extensions you can clearly see which permissions an extension uses.
Firefox permissions are actually easy to access, and have been that for years.

>no forced material design bullshit 

I'm glad you like it, but don't you think Firefox's UI also resembles Material Design in a way?
The accent color reminds me of Jelly Bean, but I prefer the dark background and 4 columns.
In Oreo it should open the panel when you tap the text.

>it doesn't protect from SSL striping 

That depends on how fast can it redirect the user, which I'm not too sure of. 

>content for the HTTP version differs from it 

That is possible, yes, but a very stupid thing to do. Like the websites that exist today and don't work without *www*. 

>some websites may require complex rules such as `https://www.example.com` may not actually work, but `https://secure.example.com` may work 

Again, kind of stupid. But yeah, Smart HTTPS does what a user would do instead of searching for "secret" versions of the sites.
You certainly don't need Disconnect with uBlock Origin, it's filters include the tracking domains anyway  
You can check HTTPS Everywhere's effectiveness by clicking on it on different sites, however as it bases on a ruleset, it may not be effective on rare or regional sites, therefore you can try Smart HTTPS (revived) instead.

As an answer to the title, it is not about *how many* but rather *for what* you need the extensions for. [I have made a collection](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/collections/tulirebane/security-privacy/) for different privacy and security needs, that should work well together, but it's up to you to pick what you need.
Theory: change the assist app to something like [Swipeup Utility](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AdrianCampos.swipeuputility)?
*about:config* is still there, feel free to tweak what you want.
Depends on your definition of "configurable". 

Surely, extensions can't change the UI too much anymore (like in Chrome), but they still can right now and soon do more than of Chrome's, such as having sidebars or changing themes dynamically. The themes are currently just background images, but should also get more "powerful" soon.
They are available, there are more than 5000 of them. The only difference is that they will work like they do in Chrome now, like one button per extension, visible permissions, badges and so on.
What is the issue though? Too drastic change?
Wire, Signal
The API is nice, could make the autocomplete entries even more useful.
>I don't think an API to make the features in Add Bookmark Here has been created yet.

I haven't read the thread nor used the extension, but I think it could theoretically be possible if extensions can manage any bookmarks in a folder. 

* The extension makes sure a special bookmarklet is placed on top of every folder (can't be moved/removed - will be recreated at the same place) 
* When user clicks the bookmarklet, the extension receives signal for which folder it was clicked on. 
* Extension does the rest - creates a bookmark in the folder and opens the management popup.
[Try this.](https://www.extensiontest.com/)
But how does the normal tab bar look in Safari when filled?
I haven't had a chance to test this, but I do like seeing that Mozilla is considering adding this back. 

My personal preference is Chrome, but improved - make the tabs as small as they can be and if they become unclickable, add a scroll bar.
FYI, these are just the [Firefox Quantum](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/quantum/) (Quantum is a marketing name for the improvements) improvements you've seen, therefore version channels Beta, DevEd and Nightly are all as smooth, and Stable will become too on November 14.

Simply put, your default will become like that soon.
[Only if this gets implemented.](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1246706)
[This](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/undo-closed-tabs-revived/?src=search) seems to be more suited for the OP, since it provides a menu instead of just restoring the last one.
Or it could just let us add our own filter lists...
Unless they pull a Pixel and use a 18:9 screen with no size benefit (smaller bezels)...
Do you notice the side bezels when using the device? Or any bezels, because of the rounded corners?
Not really, they will be inaccessible but still take storage space.
Moto X? 😁
I want a V30 this year and it would be my first phone with a glass back, so I'm thinking of getting a skin to somewhat protect it. Not going to get a case or screen protector though.
I wonder why CSS even has that property. `content` kind of makes sense, but replacing whole files?
Perhaps it's an embedded WE?
If you don't activate any of them, I don't think they can affect performance.
1. Can't autofill apps help with that? 

`3`. Switch keyboards?
To get rid of hardware buttons without reducing screen space. Assuming you are talking about Galaxies, that is also probably why they chose 18.5:9 instead of 18:9.
* Easy e10s disabling (which you won't need, hopefully) 
* Works in a separate profile by default 
* Some web dev tool button which I can't remember 

I mostly use it just because it receives (or has received) early releases faster than Beta, but slower than Nightly.
Isn't it easier to just print a new one? The only app I know that can use a random (but specific) QR-code for something is Morning Routine, an alarm app.
For now, [this extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multiselect-tabs/) lets you do the same, although it is less intuitive.
Could've looked better without the lighter shade and camera text on the back.
You might be able to reuse the full screen mode for that, as in removing or keeping the tabs only in that mode.
I do not recommend doing that, rather follow some Bugzilla bugs like [this](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1379247) and [this](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1310842) in order to make your address bar contents cleaner for secure connections. (latter can be done now with the combination of [an extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/snap-http-padlocks/) and [some css](https://github.com/Timvde/UserChrome-Tweaks/blob/master/navbar/hide-ssl-lock.css))
[Google also tried that](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/181657-google-moves-to-kill-off-the-url-entirely-in-new-version-of-chrome), but scrapped it for phishing purposes.

Nope, I was [referring to this](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/inlinedisposition-webexts/), there is [an alternative too](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/display-inline/). The Findbar Tweak might be able to port soon, as Mozilla just announced the Find API.
This help article explains it: https://support.mozilla.org/et/kb/firefox-add-technology-modernizing
I don't really think you can expect the same size, from the Pixel 2 XL images top and bottom bezels are larger and side bezels are smaller.
Is it possible to make the tabs close by double click too? Without a visible close button, that is.
So they do donate to charities after all. Didn't seem so when they dug the hole.
Seems so, yes. But I'd even be happy to just see the one-tab-find reimplemented in another way (address bar search engine, pretty please?).
I didn't mean that to be a replacement to the review system, but rather to not be afraid of *every* "random" add-on, like the commenter said.
> Now the only question that remains is how to inspect the individual things in Tree Style tabs. I guess the issue is that it's in the sidebar.

*about:debugging* > Tree Style Tabs > Debug > open it's sidebar
Find API seems interesting, can't wait to see extensions built upon it. Same goes for optional permissions, which I truly hope many developers take advantage of.
If you know how addons work, you can inspect them with [Extension source viewer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/crxviewer/). For example, I've used it to compare extensions with a similar purpose to see which one is more efficient or smaller.
Depends on how often you're using the device and its primary functions. 

Examples: OnePlus' navigation keys, most phones' volume and power buttons, fact that notification tray exists despite no down-facing arrows on notification bar, etc.
Tasker and Tasker App Builder can do this, but are probably not very efficient for this simple purpose.
That's true, I've been "fixing" that by using a white-gray shade theme in order to get notification bar separated at least.
>When folks complain that they are losing functionality they've relied on for a decade and the response is a lazy  referral to CSS, then the community has lost touch with users to a very worrisome extent.

>It's just not a reasonable reply. Yes, *I* can navigate that kludge, *but it isn't about me.* It's about the much bigger chunk of Firefox users who just want the best browser experience they can get for the effort they can muster and not making things significantly worse for them.

So it is better to say it cannot be done at all instead of suggesting something that may be a little harder than one click install? I don't get that logic.
>terribly imperfect replacement attempt 

doesn't really have to be an extension, especially when it cannot be anymore, hence I was guiding that person to what they were looking for.

You might want to repost this to r/firefox.
I actually don't need the brightness that much, it would just be better than nothing (ahem, Bixby button). 

I'm interested in that app though, would you say it is better than All-in-one Gestures?
Maybe it's because I have power notification controls enabled on System Tuner, try that.
Open the app info > On the lock screen > Hide sensitive notification content.
Make all three options fully customizable (like the front buttons, plus a custom app/shortcut support would be nice) and place back my beloved DND tile. 

Personally I would use the slider for setting screen brightness.
Blame Lenovo, white status bar is an official Android API.
Contact the dev of whichever app (system?) made a white icon. White statusbar is a feature of Android 6.0 IIRC and Firefox is not the only app to take advantage of it.
You can't theme the notification bar unfortunately, but you can theme the top bar. Maybe Firefox mobile will regain the dark theme eventually...
The latter is available as a WebExtension.
Perhaps try this? https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bookmarklets-context-menu/
I think of it as broken because while it was nice and all to make your own menu, it didn't include *everything* so it couldn't fully replace the aging menu bar.
Unless Mozilla handles it well in the UI. Right now it only redirects users to their collection, but I hope it will suggest specific extensions in the future.
I understand this may not be your job, but you should pressure the organization to use HTTPS, [with this page for example](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/why-https).
You can emulate the old one though, by moving items to the overflow menu. [Or if you prefer the even older one... ](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/application-menu/)

Not *private* per se (as in no history/cache), but a similar isolation idea is provided by Mozilla's [Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/fi/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/).

I'm aware of that, but thanks.
I've found [this bookmarklet generator](https://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet/) and attempted to use the line and the file, but got some errors (see OP). Maybe someone more familiar with JS can do something to fix it?

UI-wise (from screenshots), the attachment buttons look very close to each other, making it hard to click, the phone icon is rotated wrong.

IM-wise, why reinvent the wheel by making yet another IM service? It would be much more useful to people if you just forked Signal (most similar to your idea), WhatsApp or Telegram and just built your own extras upon it.
That is correct, edited my comment.
Yes, because Stylish itself will stop working and your theme is based on Australis UI, which will be gone too. 

However, the good news is that ~~full themes~~ skins like that will still be possible to create and apply to [userChrome.css](http://kb.mozillazine.org/index.php?title=UserChrome.css&printable=yes) (ask your theme developer!), and the upcoming [Photon UI](http://design.firefox.com/people/shorlander/photon/Mockups/windows-10.html) will look much more Edge-like anyway.

Yes, it would be nice to see Apple finally do something with bezels. Would also want the touchscreen fingerprint scanner and gestures instead of buttons (at least home).
>But wasn't available to O. 

In O, overlays can't overlap the status bar, so it wouldn't be usable anyways.
The notification shade looks nice, but the app's settings themselves look hideous...

Also, flashlight shouldn't require camera permission since 6.0.
I recommend [these extensions](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/tulirebane/security-privacy/) (some of those overlap in features) and [these tweaks](https://gist.github.com/Madis0/a74876bb00721916211e054f77045d44).
Is the first link even describing the new system? It looks as simple as the current lightweight themes, just with the addition of letting them be dynamic.
Interesting approach to tabs, however they keep reloading when switched.
I meant that Mozilla's XUL extensions will run after 57 anyways (as they are meant to be integrated and all that), so why not display the tag too.
They could make an internal exception to show "Compatible with Firefox 57" on this add-on.
You could move them to the right side of the tab bar though.

Mm, you have a point. I'll make an issue with some of my styles that work in 57+, so you could make files for them in this repo.
>I am planning to also release a Python script to manage your `userChrome.css` using this repo. It'll automatically clone the repo and edit `userChrome.css` automatically :)

Ooh, sounds cool! Have you considered making an extension too in order to get an easy management interface for the styles? [I have some ideas here.](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/issues/92#issuecomment-311944577) 

Edit: you already saw my ideas when I initially posted them 😁 

>I'm also not very familiar with the in-browser devtools to change Firefox itself, so I'm probably not the right person to write that out. 

Will do, though I can't access a computer for a few weeks to verify my tutorial. 

Also some problems I thought about: 

* How can users discuss a specific style? 
* What if the style description is very long? (compared to others, when placed in the list) 
* How to deal with FX version support? Will you test all styles over in every release? 
* License problems. I'm fine with all my styles being public domain, but I'm not sure about others. 

If the project succeeds, I'll contribute some of my own styles too when I get a chance, getting really tired of the userstyles.org mess.
Some ideas for this: 

* Add guides to what the repo is for, simplest way of using the css codes (open profile from about:support etc) in user's browser and simplest way of previewing the codes (dev tools > advanced settings...) 
* Create a list in a wiki page with the mod title, link to file, purpose (description) and screenshot(s)
* Encourage adding comments to files to help newbies adjust the styles to their liking

Yeah, but Reddit

* doesn't support a native way of showing screenshots 
* locks old posts after 6 months 
* doesn't have a compact way of showing many lines of code 
* isn't the place where current Stylish/userChrome.css users look for content 

I'd say we need a new complete website to replace Us.o, and many [users of the site](https://forum.userstyles.org/discussion/55351/update-about-userstyles-new-design-release/p9) [and Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/issues/32) agree.

userstyles.org is a better place for that, even if the site redesign broke a lot of features. I don't think Reddit is good for dynamically updatable content...

>non-website pages (like blank or addons or newtab) ?

New tab and blank pages may be compatible, if the extension implements integration somehow (by replacing the pages, probably), but if you want addons and internal pages, you're better off using a system program for gestures.
At the same time, there are options in about:config that should be exposed instead. For example, *browser.urlbar.oneOffSearches*.

No add-on bar, no close button to remove 😁

You can move these in customize view. 

>Extra Buttons: spacers and separators.

The dynamic spacer has been readded to Firefox in 57.

>The ability to remove any and every icon/button from the URLbar 

Somewhat possible natively - Firefox 57 lets you hide the right side icons that appear on three dot menu.
>Add "Reload" button on the right side of "Home" button.

You can do that by simply using the toolbar customizer in Firefox 57+.
[Wachete](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wachete-monitor-web-changes/)
The light themes can't base off the built-in compact themes, they still use the default theme as a base. You might be more happy when Photon lands, there you can make the default theme compact (without a special theme, it is just a setting).
It looked promising, but after seeing how much the notification bar wastes space, I lost my interest.

Because ESR still receives security updates.
There has been a feature [Find as you type ](http://website-archive.mozilla.org/www.mozilla.org/access/access/type-ahead/), not sure if it still exists.
Wow, this layout is more popular than I thought. Makes me wonder what is Mozilla's stance on this (for native support).
Why not use the built-in reader mode? Just hit the Aa button to change colors.
I'd like to see it in a page action, so it could hide itself when it is not needed (like it is planned for default one in Photon).
This one feels less hacky than the other commenter's solution. Thanks!
[This version is cleaner code-wise,](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/6lb3m4/chrome_styled_tabs/djsmatf/) I'd even do just

Seems to work well.
Other commenters seem to have missed the Android part of your question, though they are right in the sense that the Android version will also support only WebExtensions soon, so it wouldn't become (nor is it currently) possible to make it with an extension.

I don't think there was ever a guarantee for that. 

My overall point is that while it is not a great solution, it is an option that continues to work in the future. I [have suggested a slightly better potential solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/68gc8w/nightly_is_now_tagging_nonwebextensions_as_legacy/dgz9jzf/?context=3), though and [Stylus contributors also have discussed this](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/issues/92).
Unfortunately yes.
The only difference is the install method and lack of automatic updates. Whether you understand CSS or not is irrelevant (when you previously clicked "Install", now you'd just copy the code manually from site to file).
Yes, but it will get security updates with major updates postponed (next ESR is 58 I think). If you still want 56 for longer, you could try a Firefox fork r/waterfox.
That is how ESR works.
Yes, but Stylus and userChrome.css won't be.
>Is there anything Nextcloud can do better than Dropbox or Google Drive? 

Free storage as much as you can afford harddrives.
That looks quite clean! Is it alright to fork and publish it?
Then update Flash manually? 
It wouldn't warn you if there wasn't a security reason behind this.
Just to give an idea, I think it is possible to make with CSS by 

* using flexible spaces in tab bar as placeholders 
* moving address bar, menu and other unmovable buttons (if any) with negative margin 
* setting navigation bar height to zero 

Unfortunately I haven't had time to try making this - I love that layout too - and the toolbar customization options might change before Firefox 57 release anyway.

Are you sure? Because to me it seems that is exactly how crashes behave on this phone, haven't seen a single crash pop-up since I've got it (but have crashed apps on purpose).

Link Cleaner and Clean URLs are slightly different - the first one focuses more on site-specific redirects and the second one removes more global tracking parameters.

Read my comments of the extensions in collection and developer's descriptions if you have more questions.

Clean URLs is a WebExtension, so it will work in Firefox 57+, while Pure URL will stop working if not converted. 

>And i've problems with "Open Link Directly (No Redirect)".

Might be a case of wrong redirect skipping. You can try using Skip Redirect and setting an exception for Google (I think that one supported exceptions).

[Dark Mode](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dark-mode-webextension/)
It should work, if your extension is a WebExtension that modifies webpages. Then you just have to target the same pages and CSS classes in your style.

If you just want to make a minor CSS modification, it is much easier to use Stylus to create and manage the modification, than to repackage the whole extension, resulting in resigning mess, no automatic updates etc.

It's mostly for internal pages. But there are internal page replacement extensions for Chrome, so it can probably be ported as a FX WE eventually (just the creator doesn't want to).

S8 has a better feel IMO because it is a bit wider but thinner.
If the data is important, the webpages should prompt by themselves when user tries to close the tab or click a link with form data unsent.

However, browsers have built ways to fix this. Last year, Chrome [disabled the backspace key from going to previous page](https://www.engadget.com/2016/05/20/google-tests-killing-backspace-chrome/). Firefox [has had a hidden setting](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/disable-backspace-chrome-ie-firefox) for a long time, not sure why it is not exposed in main settings page.
For now, r/waterfox does what you want.

But when Firefox 57 gets released, I would recommend using that instead, as it will get a lot of performance improvements and you can disable all those extras manually anyway (through about:config).
It was very stockish on Aquos Crystal, but that's because it was available in US too. The Japanese UI is bloated as always.
It was done few months ago and someone posted it here too. Can't find the post now though.

You ran Firefox 54 after 56 on the same profile? The [release notes of 55](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/55.0beta/releasenotes/) specifically say not to do that.

For the next time, don't run unstable software (Nightly) in the same place (profile) you run stable software.
There is nothing wrong with a GUI approach and my question wasn't sarcastic (if it seemed so). 

My point was just that lots of software provide PPAs instead of DEBs (or at least suggest them as a preferred way for Ubuntu) and even if they do, they stay insecure (no updates through PPA).

And if you'd add a PPA through Software and Updates, how would you get the package from it? Will the PPA packages show up in the software manager?

Maybe I'm misunderstanding something, correct me if that is the case.

It was a joke on the pronunciation "q want" ~ "you want" as most people don't know about it, compared to "Google".
I want what?
I believe it's because bottom bars should be used in places where swiping doesn't make sense/isn't possible, like maps. 

But Google being Google, will probably replace all top tabs on their apps with it ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
That means you will get even bigger screens for the same width. Think Mi Mix.
Because there is still hardware inside that needs fitting.
But IE is using the OS to push Edge and not getting the same results, so I don't think it's the biggest thing that contributed to it.

Why not simply ask the devs of the extensions you use to port to Firefox?

Waterfox plans to support it and extend it (and is based on Australis), Cyberfox is dead, SeaMonkey will support it as long as it is feasible for them.
For desktop use, how about the desktop [GIMP or Inkscape](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.gimp.inkscape)?

You should elaborate or rather search for extensions that do the specific features you want (instead of an all-in-one extension).

>As far as multiple alternatives, I believe that each alternative on its own separate line is much more legible

Maybe, but that means everyone has to move the whole table in order to make room for an extension link. I have added plenty of alternatives now though, so you can check out how it looks. 

I also added the color-coding.
It should be possible with userChrome.css though, I remember seeing similar stuff on userstyles.org.
I think you should place the status column before alternatives (so people know whether they even need to look for alternatives) and color-code them automatically - there is an easy option for that. 

Also the alternatives should have at least 3 columns for people to actually have a choice.  

I will contribute to this soon 😉
>keep until browser exit, keep forever.

Assuming you don't care about specific sites, these options are built-in to Firefox.
In some sense, Mozilla seems to reiterate the concept with Containers. There is just no overview or session storing, but it would make sense to implement them when it gets enabled for all.
Or use [Browserling](https://www.browserling.com) for more convenient (but very short) nostalgia sessions.
I was a huge fan of Aero too, but nowadays I think Material Design is just as good if not better. Just need to emphasize color more (like Vivaldi) instead of going all white like Google seems to do (Android O).
I liked [the mockups](https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Tro/Firefox_4.0_Windows_Theme_Mockups) more than the real thing 😀
>The main problem is that the functionality being lost are some of the most important aspects unique to Firefox, and the main reason some of us still use FF at all.

Look at Opera. They did similar changes and handled transition worse (tons of built-in features lost that don't ever seem to come back) and they still have a huge number of users that follow them. 

Sure, there is Vivaldi, but that doesn't have half as many users.
>Cookie AutoDelete

Pretty sure that goes to the last category too, it takes a lot of whitelisting to use the web properly.

There are news and chess websites that don't use Flash. Heck, does your news website not support mobile because of this?

The bottom line is that you/your dad should be angry at the **website** for still using Flash, not Mozilla for disabling Flash by default.

I agree with that, it can be confusing and/or offensive without any context. Still, not getting any kind of alerts is worse than a confusing one, the user should expect the permissions they agreed with on install. 

I hope the optional permissions come soon (and developers implement it), to make this less of a problem.

Yes, they are a fail way because it requires a complete rewrite to nearly all extensions. Some have planned the transition (wrapped webextension was it called I think), some already completed it (without tag) and some will not port it at all.
>  I had mostly all compatible - addons, but now I have TWO that are not non-legacy. Where's the logic? 

You're talking about e10s-compatibility.

The logic is that they changed their mind later in order to let Firefox have the kind of extensions that are already supported in other major browsers - consistent API, easy ports, future-proofing.

You might be interested in these [blog](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2015/08/21/the-future-of-developing-firefox-add-ons/) [posts](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2016/11/23/add-ons-in-2017/comment-page-1/).
[Here are some good explanations](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/6cw7ig/why_is_firefox_moving_to_web_extensions_and_why/) and [here is the official support article](https://support.mozilla.org/et/kb/firefox-add-technology-modernizing).

TL;DR: 

Bad news: Things will break and several features won't be possible to port.

Good news: This will probably be the last big extension breaking Firefox will have, and the future is bright with better stability, security, speed for the browser itself. Also, easy ports from Chrome/Opera/Edge extensions, so less excuses not to support Firefox.
I am using a bunch of conflicting CSS at the moment, but I can certainly confirm the new horizontal menu.
What changes do you see? I don't see anything new on Nightly.

Edit: well, besides the legacy tag, but I don't think that is in beta yet.

Edit2: just got beta and the tag is indeed there, pretty cool in my opinion.

What app is that on top of the nag notification?
> that usually matters the most

That is also a naive thing to say. Just because XUL extensions *can do* more, doesn't mean they (or their advanced features) *are needed* more.
You should try downloading or finding the URL of the SWF and running it in the [Flash Player projector](https://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/debug_downloads.html)

Benefits:

* better performance as it's isolated
* support does not rely on browsers (use potentially forever) 
* better full screen and other controls
* easy access to the last files you opened
* can launch files directly if you make a shortcut like `flashplayer_26_sa.exe http://example.com/cool.swf`

Downsides:

* harder setup if you don't know how to get the file

What about [FormSave](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/formsave/)?
At least half of those already have WE equivalents, and some features are even built-in [to Firefox]. 

Isn't ChatZilla a part of SeaMonkey anyway?
In that case alpha sale I think, I've heard of people having gotten it with 4-5 dollars. 

My point was that the sale has not occurred recently, but only in the beginning of the app, therefore I wouldn't expect any future sales for it (while it's popular at least).
Eh, that sounds like the low price Java alpha used to have.
>whereas I got the other version for 10c during an Android sale, for example.

I've read [an article about canvas blockers](https://multiloginapp.com/how-canvas-fingerprint-blockers-make-you-easily-trackable/) and therefore used [Canvas Defender](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/no-canvas-fingerprinting/), but while it is available on Chrome too, it isn't even e10s-compatible on Firefox, hence I removed it.

This extension seems to fall to the second category of the article, so I'm not sure...

[App Cloner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.applisto.appcloner) has this and similar functions if you get the upgrade.
On the contrary, there are also hundreds of icon packs that to temporarily free every day.
Users could check it out before adding an extension (for daily use). Also it would be an alternative way of access if they were worried about the permissions or just used mobile. 

>you don't use Chrome

That's also something to note: since all popular browsers support the same extension system nowadays, you should seriously consider porting it and uploading to other extension stores too. If not Opera and Edge, at least do it for Firefox.
How about manual generation/access without the extension?
Seems like 1.12 has a (stricter?) JSON check system, so if any resource packs suddenly disappear from the list, check their `pack.mcmeta` with [JSON lint](https://jsonlint.com/).

FYI, there is a [similar test pilot experiment](https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/snooze-tabs), so if enough people use it/give feedback, it may get built to Firefox, too.
It is more worth it to highlight things that actually get fixed and that's what "These weeks in Firefox" is made for.

I wonder if Firefox 55 will have the Photon flag on beta... 🤔
In the tutorial screens they are adding to Photon, I recall one of them being made for customizing the toolbar. There they could write something like that:

> If you ever change your mind, simply click Reset defaults to make it look like new again.
I don't think it has that good sandboxing yet, as the core redesign has only been going on for months. 

What it does have though, is caring about privacy as a main principle (less invasive telemetry that is off by default in release channel, DRM first launch asks if you want to enable it, porting features back from the locked down TOR browser, built-in tracker blocker for private mode etc.)
> especially not wanting to see functionality bloat like being able to move the 3-line-menu-button.

Adding exceptions to *prevent* moving it would be bloat in my opinion. Just teach users how to reset the toolbar in case they do something stupid!
Brave browser.
Refreshing means creating a new profile (settings, extensions) and backing up the old one.
>Reasons like this make me stick with Firefox Beta. I get new features early, but I rarely have to deal with frigging bugs like that.

Completely makes sense, as Nightly was never meant to be the daily driver browser, even though some people here use it as such. 

You might be interested in Developer Edition though, if you want to be on the bleeding edge. I learned from another thread here that while Aurora is gone, the Dev edition will still receive some kind of pre-betas, before the Beta channel itself.

What you must understand is that the reason they don't work in Nightly by default is because they may not work in Firefox in the future at all. Switch to Firefox 57-compatible alternatives whenever possible.

Not exactly what you (and I) want, but [there is a similar WE](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wheeltab/) that lets you hold down right click on a page and scroll to switch tabs. It worked for me at the beginning, but right now I can't get it to work...

I also hope that [EdgeWise](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/edgewise/) will be ported to WE - that one lets you switch tabs by scrolling on the left edge of the page. (There are similar extensions on Chrome too, based on the good ol' MileWideBack)
Seems like it, but this site doesn't link to it, nor does the AMO page link to the site...
Why is it not in AMO?
Probably because it was replaced with an encrypted alternative, Standard Notes
>The point I am trying to make is add ons are meant to basically reformat the raw data the web request returns and I don't see why doing that should be obstructed by the engine developers which is why I mentioned Stylish for instance (which I assume may have an equally functional WE equivalent).

That's how WebExtensions work, yes. 

There are some Stylish WE alternatives in AMO (most notably Stylus) and the authors might port their Chrome version to Firefox, too. 

> The addons should just read them and use them and if some browser behaviour is to be modified, such as intercepting download clicks such as cliget for instance, then it should be done with express user permissions.

So you want XUL extensions with WE permissions. 

Luckily Mozilla is considering some added APIs like toolbars, but providing an API for every XUL feature would get very hard to manage for the devs.
The web has advanced too much for anyone to create a competing browser without forking one first. It's not just the engine, but also features, settings, extensions.
🖕bottom tabs, there are very few applications where they actually make sense (maps/transit is one for example, as they can't be swiped there).

Seems like a cool idea. Some feedback:

* On my OP3, it says aarch64, note the double a. 
* The notification icon should be white only, like it has been for years in apps.
* You might want to add an extra notification or text line for picking the correct Google Play Services app too.
[HomeUX](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dravite.homeux) is a beautiful drawerless launcher that can do this, but unfortunately it is still buggy and memory-intensive.
> disable it for sites where it causes problems.

That's the point. Static blocklists usually update themselves to prevent any breakage, but with this the users would need to make their own exceptions (on every device/browser).

Not to mention they need to know that *this* broke the site, and not any of the other factors that can break a site.
I am aware of extensions like that, but that doesn't mean everyone is. Though Privacy Badger needs more user interaction than a static blocklist.
Yes, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Australis looks unique but the round tabs and button positions are not liked by many, hence CTR's existence.
>  Our privacy is under attack, and Mozilla is one of the few companies that can (and would want to) help. [...] It's time for Mozilla to declare victory, high five the Chrome team, and move on to the next big challenge.

As a start, they could copy Brave a bit and integrate a powerful content blocking and HTTPS-enforcing system to the browser. 

Yes, there is a content blocker in Firefox, but

* that's still only available in private mode only (at least visibly to user)
* it has two (!) filter choices from one source, with no option to add more (come on, even old Opera had and current IE has options to add more)
Oh okay. I do remember other browsers having it too though, seems to be present on Vivaldi for example.
I see. Well, in that case you could retry when v57 arrives, as it will look more familiar.
>A recent example I saw was switching tabs with the scroll wheel: on chrome, this feature can't be turned off but it would be an about:config switch in Firefox.

So, is it an option? I would gladly remove an extension that does this if it's built-in.
You mean autocomplete? What's better about that?
> is much work to switch 

Maybe debunk that then? Firefox literally asks to import everything when you switch.
Enable and customize the menu bar? Unless you're on Mac. 

The individual menus should be fairly easily removable with CSS.
>I've been doing my best to make it look like Firefox 2 for Mac

Themes will be able to swap icons.

>Classic Toolbar Buttons, Tree Style Tabs

Possible to recreate with WE APIs.
Try [Minuum](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whirlscape.minuumfree), similar behaviour and somewhat updated.
[userChrome.css](http://kb.mozillazine.org/index.php?title=UserChrome.css&printable=yes) still exists though, and will continue existing after FX57.
Pinned tabs hide the close button and therefore could theoretically replace locked tabs, if that is your primary method of closing tabs.
It might become possible to some extent (probably a full-page preview like Opera) when addons can [listen for tab mouse events](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1246706). For now, no.
>Separate profiles in Firefox sound interesting, but I'm assuming you can't have two profiles open and running simultaneously.

Yes, you can. It's like having multiple versions of Firefox installed at the same time 😉 As said in the link, you can also easily launch them separately by making a shortcut to `firefox.exe -P ProfileName` or `firefox -P ProfileName` in non-Windows. 

> If you don't think the level of individualization I described is likely to be present in containers right now 

Well, I don't think they will be in future either because splitting the whole browser core (settings, history, bookmarks, all that) with just *tabs* would be much harder to do in my opinion than simply using separate windows and processes (as profiles do).

Even if it was possible, I bet it would make tab switching very slow. Instead of just switching to a simultaneously opened window in a multitasking environment (that uses a separate process and RAM), you'd basically switch and reload all the internal files of the browser to match the opened tab. I hope that makes sense. 

>Essentially, I want to have a container where website passwords will be remembered for me - which I assume will require enabling cookies, turning off cookie-destroying addons, and not using private browsing mode -, and then other containers where I can still have all of those things.

By this quote, it seems like you only need two profiles anyway - one for passwords and one for other stuff, and within the other profile you can further split the web with Containers. The Containers profile will use one set of addons, bookmarks, history and the password profile uses another set - you could even use themes to easily differentiate the profiles.
> These lines in the test pilot privacy statement did give me pause 

There are some things you can try, ordered by difficulty: 

* Disable telemetry, anonymize the user agent string (something common) in about:config 
* Try removing Test Pilot without removing the Containers add-on. 
* [You could theoretically build your own add-on from source](https://github.com/mozilla/testpilot-containers). 
* You could block the network requests completely with hosts or something. 

>Have you used containers before? If you have, can you answer me this - can you pick and choose which addons will apply to individual containers?

Not much, but I doubt that this feature is there. While you could suggest it to them, you are probably better off [using full-featured separate profiles in Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles) (old, built-in feature).
Yes, they are official Mozilla's experiments in add-on form. If they get enough users and feedback, they may also build the features into future Firefox releases :)

The experiments do respect your privacy, see the "Your privacy" link next on the left of enabling button on the details page to read more, or just [read this](https://testpilot.firefox.com/privacy) for a global statement.

If you want to delay the transition, use 52 ESR (instead of 56 normal). If you want XUL permanently without the old design of Pale Moon, try r/waterfox. 

Otherwise, if you are just worried about the *exact* addons you have installed, have an open mind and search for alternatives (or ask us for ideas). Look at the Chrome Web Store to see how creative the developers can be even with a little amount of APIs! 

Yes, you can't have an identical featureset, but there are several benefits to the new system in other ways (read ITT) and the main goals of a browser - stability, security and compatibility will be improved.

Username checks out.
I like the way EmojiOne has applied gradients in their latest release, not too iOS-y but more visible than before. 

Still prefer the latest Google blobs though.
> Do you think most of the features that are only available in nightly builds will be made available when this happens? I've been pretty excited for some features (especially containers), but have always been too nervous to use nightly. 

I can't tell, because containers are an experimental feature. What I know, though, is that [you can use them without having Nightly](https://testpilot.firefox.com/experiments/containers)! Make sure to give them feedback too.
> How do you know the option to move the sidebar to the right will be built-in though?

It was tested in Nightly and there is a [tracking bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1355331) for it. 

>Is there any place to check which addons will be phased out?

Unless the developer writes specifically whether they do plan to continue the development, you can't be certain whether an extension will be phased out or not. What you can do, however, is to make sure you are choosing extensions wisely on your end. 

First, install [Add-on compatibility reporter](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/add-on-compatibility-reporter/?src=ss) and make sure none of your extensions have a yellow triangle - that means they prevent you right now from having a better performing multiprocess Firefox. 

Then, you can slowly start looking for extensions that are marked with the tag "Compatible with Firefox 57+". This is more important to do for less popular add-ons that might not get updated (in time), popular ones like uBlock Origin and HTTPS Everywhere will he fine.
With Firefox 57, every extension will have to move over to a [new extension system](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-add-technology-modernizing). With that, the extensions can only modify a predefined set of actions in the browser, similar to other browser's extensions (including Chrome). 

That means the extensions are less likely to break with FX updates and less likely to slow FX down. The users will have more control by seeing exactly what an extension can do, however some features like modifying the CSS of browser can no longer be done with an extension (Stylish).

In terms of your extensions, you probably don't have to worry too much: 

> I have an extension that adds a bookmarks sidebar button to the toolbar 

There already is a built-in button for toggling the sidebar. 

> another extension that moves the bookmarks sidebar to the right side of the browser. 

The option will be built in.
You could try metasearch [Searx](searx.me) then.

>although I did think it would be sort of cool to get the userChrome.css file working, since I've never modified my browser before. 

It's good that you try, because you will need to use it instead of Stylish at the end of this year.
[App Ops](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rikka.appops), if you trust it.
There are other alternatives, like StartPage, which does take results from Google.
