You turned it very personal, and psychotic I must say. 

You‚Äôve got some shit you should really talk to someone about. Maybe someone other than Jesus?


‚ÄúHelp me out by speaking to me on a higher level‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck you.‚Äù

You‚Äôre a toon but your shtick is rather amusing in an absurdist kind of way. Thanks for the free entertainment nutjob.
Re-read our exchange from the beginning guy. It started with you offering that eloquent argument that ‚ÄúNJ is a shithole.‚Äù Is that how you begin an intelligent debate and exchange of ideas?

Your ranting is straight up laughable. You seem to suffer from an utter lack of self awareness and self control. What would your lord and savior think of the things you said to me, a stranger on the internet. I find it fascinating that you are so easily offended and yet dish out paragraphs full of offensive childish insults. 


üëå sure it will 
You only know what you‚Äôve been told. When will you break the cycle. Do if for yourself man. Before it‚Äôs too late

Maybe the unconventional approach by Dickhead Donald helped but it wasn‚Äôt a main factor.

Eh. South Carolina? Seems excessive just to save a few thousand in taxes

South Jersey (or Central) is reasonably affordable with homes 300k and under. Even less if you do your legwork and can navigate the foreclosure market. It‚Äôll need work if you buy one of those but I know coworkers with kids who bought as low as 100k (Port Monmouth, 2 br, 1 ba). Leaves a lot of room in the budget for renovations.
Can you share some Zillow examples of places in NC with those criteria? 30 min max to beach pls

Edit: I checked it out myself. Nothing remotely like what you described available.

I did see a 4 br, 3 ba new construction house in Watts Landing. It‚Äôs about $200k but doesn‚Äôt say what taxes are. It‚Äôs on a small lot. Likely has an HOA fee too. It‚Äôs not bad at all but not what you claimed.

Btw, when searching for lot sizes 2 acres or more with 4 br and 3 ba minimum, under 200k I get 3 results in the whole state of NC. Two are near the coast. Both are total gutjobs
It is pretty cool that Philly, NYC, and even Baltimore are within range for daytrips.

No but once your income becomes fixed and or reduced it‚Äôs definitely something to think about. Every year is going to reduce your standard of living a hair. 

That‚Äôs why we have 55+ communities. Shit I would buy one now if I could.

Fuck that man. You want 30 minutes or less

Wow. This is kind of amazing to see a real life example of the NJ-leaver cliche. I wonder if they sold their place or walked away. Hope they find what they‚Äôre looking for.
Get a place near Yanticaw Park or any of the individually named parks that link together between Kingsland St and Center St. Great place to go for a run or a bike or a picnic. bring the dog, feed the ducks, shoot some hoops. Nice place

Cool man. I wanted to buy a place in AP a couple years ago but could only afford a place in a questionable area so bought in Toms River instead.  I‚Äôd love to live in AP it would save me a lot of driving since I‚Äôm there pretty much every weekend!

I‚Äôm about to buy a new pen leaning towards this one because of the variable voltage. Is it actually useful? 

For weed oil will it vaporize at the lowest setting? Also 350 mah seems low and that I‚Äôd have to charge it frequently . What do you think
No. It‚Äôs a very strange and morbid picture of dead animals frozen in the throes of agonizing suffocation; slung over the shoulder of their smiling killer.

Same. I grew up in North Jersey calling it Taylor ham because I didn‚Äôt know any better. Now I live in OC and I call it pork roll although I don‚Äôt eat it anymore since going mostly vegan. 

Taylor Ham sounds euphemistic and uppity to me. It‚Äôs like people don‚Äôt want to say ‚Äúpork roll‚Äù because they think it sounds beneath them.

And that‚Äôs all that you would deserve
I need to get a kayak this year I keep putting it off. Got a river a block away

Can I use this vape with weed oil carts?

I assume yes but the part it says how it‚Äôs meant for essential oils makes me doubt. 

I have a knockoff ego-t I bought for $7 off eBay looking for something higher quality.

Execute them 
Ten cents per gallon or more. It comes out to at least $2-3 dollars and the higher gas prices are the more you save. And you earn 4% cashback with Costco credit card. 

But yea when it‚Äôs a long line I don‚Äôt go unless I don‚Äôt mind chilling for a bit. Although the wait is rarely more than 5 minutes. 10 at most. This is at the Lakewood location on 70.

If you have someone else in the car send them in for beer while you wait
I‚Äôm pretty high rn and I enjoyed this and want to play dog of war
It definitely does for me because I no longer care when I arrive or that I got ‚Äústuck‚Äù behind a truck or bus or someone going the speed limit or that some asshole cut me off.

If there is ever a road test for intoxication I hope there is a reasonable legal limit like there is for alcohol
Sure
Yea just a puff it‚Äôs fine

I do make a point to drive slower when doing this though. I stay in the right lane or middle. With traffic and not in a rush. 

I‚Äôm not recklessly speeding down the parkway blasting music changing lanes, etc. It‚Äôs a relaxing ride. I will also say I see lots of bad drivers out there driving with no situational awareness, with their cellphone in hand, or talking emphatically with their passengers obviously not paying full attention. These people are a much bigger risk.
That sucks. My job didn‚Äôt even do an initial test
I will partake after work on way home. Parkway south, vape, tunes, TGIF

What about all the other jobs people have and the spouse dies or is not able to work? That‚Äôs what insurance is for. And disability, and Social Security.

It is not the responsibility of the taxpayer to subsidize a police officer‚Äôs lifestyle. There is nothing that says a police officer or any other public sector job in NJ is entitled to a salary that lets them buy a house and support a family by themselves.
This is why in many households both people in a couple work.

The American Egg Board advertises eggs
How stupid must someone be to fail to read and comprehend a post before commenting with childish bullshit

The milk industry does it too. Ever stop and think why?
Better late than never but this is really late
It also keeps things like the dresser and crib from damaging the walls

Also, aesthetics

Aren‚Äôt they paying property taxes though? 

At what point is their land put up for auction? Is no one else interested in buying these lots? Would they only cost the amount of taxes in arrear? Hmmm
Yes, this is serious business
No silly, pics of the fireworks from Eagle Rock!

It‚Äôs fine, still tacky to me but that‚Äôs coming from someone with a certain affinity for the statue. It is cool to see the town embrace the team. 
You‚Äôre cute
This.
Every seat there is great. I usually just buy the cheapest ticket I can get, as long as it‚Äôs away from the visitors section.
Everyplace really there‚Äôs so many. pick the one closest to you and go
$750 first year
$2,000 second
$3,000 third
$5,000 each year thereafter

This would be in addition to the property taxes they are paying. 

Lots of $. But I‚Äôm not sure how it solves the eyesore of abandoned properties. Or are these registration fees like a fine for letting the property languish. Does the town then use that money to maintain the property? So many questions
Pics OIDH
Tell all your friends too. Spread the good word. We are better than this
Technically sure but this is a matter of the heart. For many New Jerseyans Lady Liberty is a cherished monument. I‚Äôd say more people from NJ have actually visited it than people from NYC. We have Liberty Park that many of us have been to numerous times which is a park dedicated to the statue and all she represents. 
Yea this just looks all kinds of weird to me. A Devils jersey belongs there. I could see a Rangers one too if they were in the playoffs. 

But the Vegas GK logo looks so out of place on the Statue of Liberty

It‚Äôd be like putting a Vegas jersey on a fake Washington monument, or Gateway Arch, or Utah‚Äôs Delicate arch. 

But it‚Äôs cool. Vegas is Vegas. A facsimile of someplace else 
That‚Äôs disrespectful and tacky. But it‚Äôs Vegas cant expect too much I guess
Would love to hear what you have to say when one of these guys hurts or kills someone, or crashes into someone‚Äôs car and then rides off.

Aww feel better?

When the fun and stupid thing involves breaking the law, putting other peoples‚Äô property and health and lives at risk, disturbing the peace, driving uninsured vehicles through crowded urban streets, ignoring road signs, obstructing traffic, etc the ‚Äúfun and stupid thing‚Äù becomes a big problem. 

There‚Äôs good reasons for the law that bans this. Need to figure out a better way to enforce it

Yea fuck this tree right. It‚Äôs only been standing there for decades. Growing slowly year by year before these kids were even born. One moment of stupidity and this tree loses a branch for nothing.
They are not climbing on the tree they are hanging on weak branches.
Yes, this tree is not a mature/strong tree. Hanging on thin branches like that damages the tree and can result in injuries. I stand by my comment

yea and that has nothing to do with Mueller. he can't impeach. obviously
nice projection
most likely it won't. but the American people deserve the truth. with that information we can vote accordingly this November and in two years.
so that would mean Powell lied, not Mueller. Or Powell had false evidence unbeknownst or beknownst to him.

Mueller stated that Powell presented evidence. If you're questioning the evidence that's one thing, but he didn't lie in that statement.

If you come in summer Mogo has a spot on the boardwalk. Silverball Pinball is worth a couple hours at least. 

Oh and in Red Bank Earth Pizza makes a great vegan pie. Good Karma Cafe is there too, all plant based food. It‚Äôs ok but I‚Äôve had better. Like Kaya‚Äôs Kitchen in Belmar.

My two person, two dogs, and one cat household uses 3,000-4,000 gallons a month. I‚Äôll round up to 50k/yr. 

Adding a couple of kids I could see that usage doubling. I don‚Äôt think we use a lot of water. Don‚Äôt water the grass (hoa covers that), only wash our cars a few times a year, the animals don‚Äôt get baths (dog gets a grooming appointment every few months), we don‚Äôt take long showers, we do take bath soaks a few times a month, newer HE washer. The toilets are basic and will eventually be replaced with multi-flush units. 

100,000 seems just about right for a family

Thanks. I see after looking around some that the ability to browse music library on the phone from the watch was restored. I'm finally updating my watch from version 3. good stuff
sweet! finally updating my watch from 3.whatever

genres would be nice to have though
No see it is. Because it is on a news show. Delivered by news reporters. To people watching it, it is "news." 

And most of them will never know that their friendly local news reporters are being instructed what message to deliver to their audience.
true. thought the contamination is caused by animal agriculture (i.e. feces)
not to mention all the other crap you're ingesting with your meat. antibiotics, hormones, puss, feces, filler, and rotting flesh

I do have a lovely narrative.

Go vegan and no one gets hurt
Thanks. It says ability to control music on iphone from watch is restored. but can I start playing music from the watch? I can browse my library and pick something to play? 
Hmm is this accurate? On 4.3 can I browse the music library stored on my iphone from my watch? And select things to play from the watch?
yup sure do. do you have a point you are trying to make or you just like asking leading questions

It is nice though. Wife and I went the weekend before St Pats. Stayed in a carriage house found on Airbnb. Brought our dog and our bikes. It was a really good time. Paid about $500 for three nights but bought $500 Airbnb credit off eBay for $450.
Because of this most digital purchases I‚Äôve made for a while are almost all on Steam. I don‚Äôt like how PS3 games are stuck on that console. 

Same goes for my Wii U. Got a bunch of games on there that are trapped on that system.

The Steam model seems the most consumer friendly

I would skip it. You‚Äôre still getting slot of use out of Wii U. Wait for Switch 2. You‚Äôll get a more powerful console and hopefully by then Nintendo will get its online/digital platform act together.

Personally I‚Äôm not getting another Nintendo console until backwards compatibility or some kind of permanent digital library that is not locked to one console (ala Steam).

I have NES and SNES and Wii I games I own digitally but locked to my Wii U. I don‚Äôt care to spend money ‚Äúbuying‚Äù digital games that are trapped on one piece of hardware.

I have original Pax. I loved it but moved on to using liquid. Cleaning the Pax is such a pain in the ass and the mouthpiece constantly gets stuck. I use a vapor brothers box vape at home for herb and an Ego-T for portable.

Is Pax 2 any better as far as maintaining it? Doubt I‚Äôll ever buy another herb portable vape though since the carts and batteries are so convenient 
I don‚Äôt have an answer but oh boy. Good luck with this one. I‚Äôve read some horror stories. Keep us posted on the process 
That‚Äôs sad to hear. I don‚Äôt mind the Island-ers
ALDI has good avocados, nice and big and sometimes on sale for 59 cents. I see no problem with their red potatoes either. Or sliced mushrooms, squash, cucumber, carrots, bagged spinach, celery, tomatoes, onions, cilantro.

Most fruit is good but be careful with their berries sometimes not so fresh. I had a pack of strawberries grow mold the day after bringing them home. Keep your receipt so you can return if there‚Äôs a problem. The policy is you get the money back and a replacement but you have to ask.

Almond milk yes. Organic ketchup. Mustard. Canned beans, tomatoes. Sauce, pasta. Nuts and dried fruit. Tortilla chips. Sprouted grain bread. Veggie chips. Excellent chocolate. Good veggie patties, and I love those hash browns. And double stuff cookies.
Take it again. Isn‚Äôt it in April?
sole purpose is to be eaten? says who? spend time around a cow and you see they have personality, and consciousness, and feel pain and sadness and fear.

Keep telling yourself it‚Äôs delicious.

And keep ignoring everything else about it besides taste. You sound like a child who will only eat pizza

I‚Äôll go eat my grass, and spinach, kale, lettuce, tomatoes, cucumber, carrots, onions, beets, broccoli, cauliflower, olives, avocado, corn, peas, potatoes, beans of all colors and types, lentils, hummus, nuts, fruit, bread, pasta, rice, quinoa, couscous, veg tacos, chili, pizza, stuffed shells, lasagna, veg burgers with all the fixings, stir fry, and on and on and on

Do you not realize that most of the food everyone on the planet eats is vegan? meat, dairy, and eggs (and fish). Everything else is vegan. That‚Äôs a lot more food than ‚Äúgrass.‚Äù
That‚Äôs just the end of the torture though
You do you but no thanks. Dad has prostate cancer and meat increases that risk.

Also I don‚Äôt want to eat a sentient creature that lived its short unnatural life in captivity, pumped with antibiotics and hormones and crap filler before being slaughtered 
not a great idea to rely on milk for your protein intake
haven't had dairy milk in over a year and don't miss it at all.

I get unsweetened almond milk from ALDI, $2 a half gallon.I use it with cereal, with cookies, in cooking, it's great and like you say lasts much longer.
now ask your soul how satisfied it is to be consuming something that was likely literally tortured so you could eat its dead flesh.

I do like me some Central Jersey. Like you say fairly close to both the city and the shore and a few cool towns of its own to do stuff in.

I started out in North Jersey but now in South Jersey, or at least South Central (Toms River). It feels like South Jersey anyway. More spread out, you drive on highways pretty much to get anywhere. 

I do like being closer to IBSP though and having hiking trails a block away is nice. Cheaper housing and taxes too.

Makes sense though. I pay near that for a 3 br townhouse (mortgage, prop taxes, home insurance, pmi, and hoa) and that‚Äôs after putting down 20%.

Oh yea definitely. Re-reading my comment it was a bit rough. I have a cat rescue and a dog we bought from an Amish family breeder.

Of course all animals deserve our love, patience, and care. Just saying that not everyone can handle that with obviously abused dogs and cats. Bless them they are truly good people
Couple reasons 

They want a dog other humans haven‚Äôt already fucked  up. Not everyone wants to or is capable of handling that responsibility, either because of their temperament or their lack of ability.

Dog insurance. I imagine more people who buy puppies from a breeder get health insurance for their dog. This way they are covered since there will be no pre-existing condition exclusions. I‚Äôm guessing after the company look at the dog‚Äôs history they‚Äôre going to have a full list of things they won‚Äôt cover.

Hope it doesn‚Äôt change the place too much but I fear it will.

I was paying close to $3,000 in West Orange for 2 br, 1.5 ba. Got out of that shit thankfully. Too much for what the place was. 100 yr old house with issues

You‚Äôre right I should have directed my comment towards the Hasids moving into towns around Lakewood and other areas. They are being directed to do so as policy by their leadership, the so-called ‚Äúschtickle pioneers.‚Äù

You are making assumptions and generalizations yourself. You like to throw that word around quite liberally. Do you think it is supposed to scare people into not offering criticism of what these people engage in? 

Yes my initial comment was reductionist. But that‚Äôs the reaction many of us who live in the communities they are moving into have to their blatant abuse. It is their actions that paint themselves in a negative light.

I suspect you don‚Äôt live where this is happening. It is difficult for people to fully realize how they are impacting communities and peoples‚Äô financial situations (real estate) if they don‚Äôt see it regularly. From afar you jump to conclusions and label critics bigots but there is much more to the story.

To recognize this doesn‚Äôt make me a bigot. They can‚Äôt hide behind the anti-Semitic banner that‚Äôs not what this is about.

Nice. I‚Äôm 30 minutes south via the parkway and go there often so it‚Äôll be convenient to stop for supplies if it ever comes to pass. 

I‚Äôm in Toms River and they‚Äôve talked about a preemptive ban but it‚Äôs been tabled for now. They‚Äôre going to revisit it if the state legalizes.
Thank god for Asbury Park

Rocket League, of course

I‚Äôve never played a game this frequently (almost daily) for so long (since launch) before

Although I play it on PC most these days
Yea. Was cheap though. Bought them using amazon no rush credits and Plus was on sale too
Here‚Äôs the thing. They are walkable towns with a lot of  amenities and they are more affordable than places closer to NYC.

For people who work in NJ they are great places to either live in or be close to. 

I‚Äôm even further from NYC bc I bought the space I wanted at a price I could afford. RB and AP (mostly AP) are my go to spots for weekend fun. Not everyone wants to or can afford to live in a dense urban environment. 


I‚Äôm subbed til March 2021

Not sure after that. PS4 might be last console I buy. I use PC much more and I don‚Äôt like the idea of content trapped on old systems

The landscape is different. But it is beautiful. Pine forests, sandy soils, marshes, rivers, lakes, ocean, bays. 

The commute part is an issue if you work outside of the state. But if you can find work in-state it‚Äôs a reasonable drive from many points south in Monmouth and Ocean counties. 

I am really enjoying life here. Great parks and Open Spaces for hiking and other recreation, various beach towns within 20-30 minutes, and reasonable real estate prices and taxes.

Doesn‚Äôt say much about the company you keep. Boring people are naturally bored.
The first half of that word salad of a paragraph is pure deflection. This is such a tired and weak tactic.

The rest of your ranting is a scare-mongering word jumble.
Eh, don't want to buy a whole new machine. We like the K250  we have now. It's not that big a deal. Certainly not enough to replace it
Good point. But there is a major difference between them. The GOP has shown their willingness to throw their hat in with an anti-government corrupt business tycoon who violates Constitutional norms and arguably Constitutional laws. As long as it lets them engage in their power grab under the radar they are happy. Despite the long term damage being done to our democratic society.

What a letdown, I thought there was going to be an actual reason instead of a rhetorical comeback worthy of a toddler. Try harder

this is a wonderful feeling. Looking forward to it
not much reason yes, but there is some reason.

I turn ours off after each use as well since we usually only have one cup a day in the morning. It would be useful to tell Alexa to warm up the coffee machine instead of pressing the button. And then to turn it off without having to press the button.

I'm going to hook up my Keurig to smart plug, even just to turn it off it could be useful. 
How sheltered must someone be to think a whole goddamned state with so much history and natural beauty in literally every single direction, and all around it for hundreds of miles is nothing more than just a place to shit and sleep between visits to New York City?

You gotta be a youngin with that attitude. It‚Äôs not my job to explain to you all that one gets from living their life within these boundaries. It‚Äôs your job to go out there and explore and have experiences and expand your horizons. There is so much to do and see here that people have written books about it. Feel free to google it.


You did the right thing. Yea it sucks but it‚Äôs worth it. I thought though you had to wait 30 days to be new customer, or use a different name could make it work earlier?

If they do call you though please update your post. Would like to hear what happened.
‚ÄúWithout any of the good‚Äù

This is true if the only good thing you think is here is proximity to NY. Which many people will tell you is just silly.
I hear you. I‚Äôm not in a position to get a job paying me 6 figures. The job I do now would likely be less salary in other states with cheaper COL so it‚Äôs all relative. 

NYC a reasonable drive away. I went to a concert at the Beacon last week. After work, drove in. Was home just after midnight. Went to work the next day no problem. Philly the same. I don‚Äôt go often but it‚Äôs nice to be able to when I want.

Lots of parks and hiking around me, lots of beach towns. Asbury Park 30 min away, I visit throughout the year. IBSP season pass for summer beach days is the shit. 

Some people actually like living in NJ go figure.

Houston? Checking Zillow lots of places under/near $300k with prop taxes 40-50% less. Not bad bu it‚Äôs not mind blowingly more affordable. In comparison NJ is not ‚Äúridiculously expensive‚Äù unless you‚Äôre talking about places worth more than 500k close in to NY. And you have to want to live in Houston. I am suspicious of their school quality. The weather is another issue for me since I like having four seasons. Also, no tornados in Jersey. The flood prone-ness of Houston revealed another potential strike for their unchecked/unwise over-development. Traffic I hear is bad too.



Lol guess you‚Äôre not ready to self-actualize. Pity. Good luck in life
I notice you didn‚Äôt answer the question. Interesting.

I‚Äôll still try answering yours though.

Most of a team‚Äôs fan base comes from the geographical area the team represents. That obviously doesn‚Äôt mean people not within the market area shouldn‚Äôt be fans. But, those fans‚Äô reasons are different than the motivations of typical team fans and vary widely.

Anyway, go ahead and be a fan of whoever you want but expect to be ridiculed for it. Just know your Rangers fandom for a person from NJ makes you look like just another wannabe New Yorker from New Jersey. 

Have some fucking self-pride man and don‚Äôt be yet another NY lemming. 


The Devils are New Jersey‚Äôs team. Our only team. 

For many of us pride in the team is part of the pride we feel about where we are from. What is it you get out of being a Rangers fan? From New Jersey?
Just a hunch

You‚Äôre self-hating because (assuming) you are from NJ you don‚Äôt root for the team that represents your home.

You glom onto the NY franchise because it is more popular and ‚Äúcool‚Äù to like NY things than NJ things.

Same goes for the rest of the wannabe NYer New Jerseyans


Sprouts FTW

"not because they want to"

what does that mean? sure no one wants to pay more than they think the place is worth point is it is worth what they are asking, despite what the renter feels. The rent price is based on the ownership cost and physical maintenance, plus profit.

if you want more than a 1br for $1,000 a month housing payment then you'll have to come up with a down payment and take on a mortgage.
because lots of people are moving in, and being born, and growing up

I just moved to somewhere I could comfortably afford and that was close enough to the beach to go to IBSP most  weekends in the summer and have no more than an hour commute to work (I work in NJ). Yes it meant moving out of NE Jersey where I have lived all my life but I get more home for my money down here. The equivalent of my townhouse condo up there would be near $400k with double the tax bill, and then hoa fee on top of that.

Yea we're not going to retire off the value of our homes like people buying in the in-demand, nyc and philly commuter towns but you get more for your money. Plus a lot of us living in these areas actually like it.
Too much work, same for curtailing their annoying ass yapping at every person and dog passing by. 
Try Belleville. I had a 1br in an apartment building on Washington ave from 2012 to 2015.

Dude I‚Äôm telling you, you don‚Äôt need meat to feel satisfied or to completely nourish you. NFL players have gone vegan, NBA too. These guys are probably bigger than you with greater caloric and nutritional demands and they are thriving.
I rarely eat pizza since going mostly vegan but hot damn when I do Denino‚Äôs in Brick is on point
You see what they do to provide you with your precious dead flesh? Animal abuse happens everywhere everyday in the meat and dairy industry.  They don‚Äôt have to suffer. Change your ways. Stop buying dairy milk, severely reduce your meat intake, you‚Äôll feel better about not supporting torture and by not consuming the dead flesh of animals that endured torture for you.  Throw off your chains and you‚Äôll free them of theirs too.
I am the best and smartest vegan I took a test. I have the best fruits and veggies believe me.

Can't since I'm not in the area. do I really need a ticket? it's going to be so crammed with people they can't check everyone right. I have no idea how Patco works never rode it

I like my bike idea. Never done it before it'll be an adventure!
I wonder by what time the lots are going to fill up
I'm an atheist but I'd ride or die with Jesus anytime
bike?
it's beautiful man

In line for tickets or to get on the train? 
Oh man I‚Äôm having second thoughts now sounds like a shit show!  PATCO is releasing a special Thursday schedule later today. I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôll just head out very early and try to park at the furthest station from Philly. 
Oo boy this sounds like it could be a mess. 

Maybe I should just drive into Philly and walk . Any areas where I can get a street spot? I don‚Äôt mind a long walk to the parade route
Thanks. Seems I‚Äôd be going out of my way a bit. I‚Äôd have to drive the same distance to AC as Camden do I might as well make the drive towards Philly. I‚Äôll probably take 70 W
Can they be bought online? I won‚Äôt be in the area for anything until Thursday 
Damn how did you get those doors to align so perfectly. I took out standard hinged double doors in my bedroom and put in barn doors but they don‚Äôt line up very well it‚Äôs not a seamless closure like yours. Frankly it‚Äôs janky as fuck and I spent $800 :(

The doors were made of pine planks and I think they warped or weren‚Äôt squared off to begin with. I spend a lot on the material alone. :( I wish yours were mine
Thanks
Thanks this is part of the point I was trying to make. They have and continue to benefit greatly through tactics like gerrymandering
it‚Äôll take me just as long to get to Camden or AC that‚Äôs why I figured Patco.  Ride will take a while with all the stops I guess. 

Is Amtrak direct? much more $? Thanks 
Ah didn't think of that thanks. A seat would be nice. maybe I'll do Lindenwold. I've never ridden on PATCO, I'm driving from Toms River

So then a 30 yr is perfect for you. You can pay more as well to reduce the interest you pay. Anything extra you pay directly reduces the principal balance.

If you plan to live in the place that long buying a place even with a 30 yr is much better financially for you than renting the equivalent.

It‚Äôs tiresome always having to be nice about it. And when being reminded of the literal despoiling of such an important natural resource as the Amazon rainforest that‚Äôs the simple reaction I have.

I am about 99% plant based food. Even if everyone who says they care about the environment cut their meat intake in half it would do a lot of good.

Like fuck fine you don‚Äôt have to be vegan but stop eating so much meat and dairy. Baby steps 


What are you trying to say 
Umm bro?
Stop eating meat assholes

We were and are obviously under attack.

But to get rid of Trump collusion would have to be proven. Which to me it seems pretty clear has already happened. Once the Russians approached his campaign with opposition research and were not reported seems to me an unlawful action.

The propaganda campaign for American hearts and minds continues unabated even today.
THIS. let Meuller do his job and come what may. I fear what the altright and the extremists they are encouraging and inspiring may do if Trump were going to be forcibly removed from office. And I think he and the Repubs complicity is doing them a lot of damage among swing voters/independents.

So it might be best for the country if he were to resign instead of get kicked out.

But no matter what happens we must win as many seats in the House as we can. That should be the focus of our efforts
The internet is a cesspool 
What threat was she to other students that they wouldn‚Äôt even let her attend graduation in the audience.  The school could have handled this with more compassion. 
It‚Äôs not really an issue. The things last a long time and people generally switch them out at home when they‚Äôre kicked. Or they save the old ones for those dry times üòâ
It‚Äôs not for gaming
next time take a shit in the recycle bin
that's cheap. I'm looking at tickets for NY  they're a hundo for something decent
Hah love the sports jacket
That‚Äôs an op-ed you know that right?
I'll have to check it out. Hopefully they have lots of veg options!
I like the idea of adding the property to the town's Open Spaces inventory and maybe extending Huddy Park  with the land

why the million dollar premium over the market value though I wonder
nope, moved here end of 2015

all I'd need for a night out there is a cool theater and like an ocean organics or something. :) if only that area could be more of a destination
Do they each serve a different purpose 
Very very nice. Love the built in light overhead. Can you control it while sitting at the desk
What‚Äôre all the backpacks for
This is basic functionality I use a hundred times a day
BYOB
For me a theater showing indie/art/classic movies would be a destination itself
Yea. It‚Äôs the master plan being updated. It will take years to see the effects. 

What I‚Äôd love to see is a small movie theater downtown. 
But he‚Äôs all over the ad. It‚Äôs a bad for him as much as it is anything else
Lame. But I‚Äôm an infrequent buyer and am in Asbury Park regularly so not too concerned. Would be nice for the town to get in on some extra revenue though.
why type 5 letters instead of 4
Sad they got rid of google by sms too
Sure I‚Äôll give him some credit for the performance of the stock market. Which of course is merely one facet of the economy.

Funny how the unemployment numbers under Obama were somehow fake but now they‚Äôre real? He is plainly dishonest to say the least.
