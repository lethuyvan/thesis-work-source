What a stupid, pretentious comment. People work on shows and movies every day who “do their job right”.

You’re gonna need to provide a source for that. 
He never was gonna not be free, idiots. I don’t get why this sub made such a big fucking deal about this as if they were actually gonna send him to prison for something as stupid as filming his pug do the nazi salute. 
Shut up. People leave the Midwest in droves for a reason. It sucks there. 
Wow. I never would have expected this. 
Very true. I walked out of the theater forgetting about the first 40 minutes. It was like I just walked out of a short film 
All of 2 minutes. 
Sorry, what other kids have been in these movies besides Jake Lloyd?  
He’s starting to look like Malcolm McDowell 
True. I just don’t see how they could have fixed the weird pacing in the edit.  I would have wanted to see a young Jyn learning the ropes of being a rebel with Saw as her mentor. I felt like there was too much of a gap between her as a kid and as an adult. 
Go fuck yourself, OP
Wow talk about a costume no one will get 🙄
You said film though not television. Don’t change what you said just to fit your agenda. Brick was an indie movie no one but movie nerds saw. Brothers Grimm was mediocre and Looper was a great film but that’s just ONE good film he’s made. Yet Disney put  him on for the biggest movie franchise wholesale.  He must have Bob Iger’s dick pics or something. 
Why should people have to google it?  The burden of proof is on you. 
>	Disney feels safer bringing in seasoned veteran directors

Rian Johnson is a seasoned director?  He literally had three movies under his belt before TLJ 
He’s a good director but he needs a better writer. Rogue One felt rushed and at the same time had some weird pacing issues. It’s funny how often people talk about who he director is but no one cares about the writer. That’s where a good story starts. 
Eat a cinder block. 
I’ve very very low expectations for this movie so I’ll probably have to catch a matinee showing. 
You sound like the kinda piece of shit who goes to Walmart in crocs. 
Hilarious!!!
maddox is an idiot but at least he made an effort to lose a bunch of weight.  madcucks is still a fat fuck.
No joke.  That video I uploaded of Mental Jess acting like an idiot before they started recording an episode of Best Debate got taken down within a matter of hours.
> sebastian Stan

He barely look likes like Mark Hamill.  Mark Hamill's son looks more like young Mark Hamill.
Even better question: How do you not see its two pictures side by side?
Han shoots first, no shitty CGI Jabba, no random critters at Mos Eisley, no Vader yelling "Nooooo" like an idiot, no awkward force-ghost Hayden Christensen, the list goes on.  The only thing weird is the shitty looking Emperor hologram in ESB.

Yeah because deporting people’s husbands/fathers and shooting people like fish in a barrel is okay as long as you get to keep ‘muh muh muh assault rifles’. Fuck off. 
You probably live in some shitty part of the country like the south or Midwest. Bigger cities have skinnier, hotter nurses.  Don’t like your fat nurses?  Move.

No need to be ashamed. Maddox was actually funny between ‘98 and 2005. He had an actual fan base that respected him. If you think about it he was Dick 1.0 as every article he wrote was about what made him a rage. 
Deep reference. 
He’s the best satirist in existence. 
Uh...okay?  Don’t see how not liking the movie would ruin a hobby for you but whatevs. 

I subbed to this place just to see the cool shit people are buying/making,  it’s fun. I have a black series Luke ANH and don’t have the funds to buy anything right now but I still enjoy seeing what people here have to share. 

By the way posting on the internet/social media that you’re leaving is just a way to get attention. If you really didn’t care you wouldn’t have made this post.

Joel Chaco?  Really?  That right wing faggot that did a show where he and that fat faggot madcucks sucked each other off? I bet Dick forgot he even exists. 

Did you not listen to this weeks episode where he gets completely grossed out by Digibro’s borderline pedo-fetish?  You’re an idiot.

Oh I’m not sure how durable they are at all for dueling but to be fair the Hasbro ones aren’t made for dueling either so I guess at the end of the day they’re just made to look pretty. I know of one guy on YouTube who reviews lightsabers and I think he’s used a thin neck Obi Wan hilt for dueling and it was pretty sturdy. 
Well they still make it that way when plenty of other companies make thin-necked versions of this saber...
The neck of the lightsaber is fat. Compared to the movie [version](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/starwars/images/7/7d/LukeROTJsaber-MR.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100616172523)

The Matrix trilogy. The sequels are crap. 
Nevermind Schindler’s List. 
Are you an idiot? Since when does budget determine cult status
Haha!
Funny since montages were a thing in the 80’s...
Wtf are you babbling about?  AI is a great film. 
That sub is shit. Should be called /r/ObviousMovieDetails 
Literally zero. Wtf. 
ITT: Paid Disney shills out in full force.
Oh look, found the Disney shill.
They weren’t fat. 
Judging by the speaker holes on the bottom of the hilt I’d say it’s a modded Rey Black Series lightsaber hilt. 
Jesus. If his wife wants to act so badly join a fucking theater or acting group on fb or something. 
When you say format do you mean film vs digital?  Because as far as I know both TFA and TLJ were shot on 35mm. It’s very likely that RJ used different lenses and film stock to achieve a certain look. Lighting also has a lot to do with it. 
Literally everything south of the mason Dixon line. Oh and Montana, Idaho and the Dakotas are useless. 
Gay
It’s not your computer. I watched that fight scene clip the other day then I watched a scene from TFA and her face looks noticeably thinner in that movie.  John Boyega also looks slightly chubbier in TLJ. The only person that looks exactly the same is Oscar Isaac. 
The difference is Bryan Cranston’s a good actor. 
Did her face get chubbier in TLJ?  
But but but you can’t destroy the things you hate!  Instead instead you-you-you gotta protect the things you loooooovvvveeeee
If you have a big social media following, dealing with assholes it’s par for the course. Bitching about it won’t help.

Oh brother 🙄 
So why hire him? 
Vintage?  Really?
> says Dick is a bit of a shit talker 

I mean thats not untrue.
You're gonna look like such a faggot wearing that around.
He cheated.  Fuck him.
What an asshole
Wasn’t Marquand a puppet director and it was GL pulling the strings the whole time? 
It’s like poetry. 
The ESB hilt changed scene to scene. It didn’t always have two red buttons. So you’re right and wrong. 
Underrated comment 
Fuck you. 
Ugh.  Shut up.
No one wants to hire you

Eh?
Not even close but to be fair he has to FEEL like a young Ford. Michael Fassbender doesn’t look a thing like Steve Jobs but he pulled it off because he felt like Steve Jobs. 
Noncey?
Young Hayden looks like young Macaulay Culkin. 
This is shit. No video should be 3 hours long. 
I doubt 80’s girl would ever have a kid with Dick. 
Just because it's shopped doesn't make it "misleading" 
Not implying anything.  Pretty clear in what I said, I'm sorry you're a moron.
Minus the sexual assault 
You’re just saying that because he spoke truth about that idiot trump. Fucking idiot. 
I understand he tried to kill him. I just wanted some green saber action either fighting/training with Rey or fighting Kylo Ren. 
 Of all the things I wanted in TLJ it was Luke using his lightsaber in a COOL way. Instead we got him about to kill his nephew with it. Oh well. 
Dick speaking ill of Trump?  What world are we in?!
Good enough reason. 
Spoiler tag, really? 
Either use CG Padme and Jimmy Smits or live action Padme and Jimmy Smits. This just looks awful. 
What’s the story behind this meme?  Feel like I missed something. 
To be fair Cracked was never really funny. 
No love for Rogue One?
Thats the guy from those stupid Wix commercials you see on YouTube.
What's great about Conan is that he can legit make any situation funny and weird.  He doesn't have to fake it like Fallon or that awful british guy on CBS.
Wow that poor ipad didn't deserve that lol
Cheap. I’ve seen 3d printed hilts on eBay for as little as $50 bucks. 
🤣
Doubt it. See the antenna?  That’s a motion tracker for rotoscoping the lightsaber
That’s a pretty big oversight. Does Daisy Ridley not like holding the hero saber?  It’s not that uncomfortable to hold. 
It’s a picture of a bag. That’s just a light reflection. 
This movie is turning out to be the Fantastic 4 of this year. 

Let’s just hope Rob Howard doesn’t take to twitter to blame Disney for everything. 
Awesome, thanks. 
Him and Frankito should hang out. 
He went from fat to looking like a junkie. 
Thanks for the info. Do you know if they do Black Series conversions?  I have the Luke ANH lightsaber. 
Well deserved.  He's infamously awful to work with.
How much do they charge for conversions?

What’s the pic in the background?  I recognize it from The Last Jedi as the tile art but I could never make out exactly what it was
Where’d you get it ?
That game was awesome. Almost felt like Halo but in the Star Wars universe. 
Tl;dr
Because nerdwriter and the people who hype his videos are pretentious. 
Where’s this from ?
THX-1138 is also an underrated sci-fi flick 
>leveled the boom

Huh?
I’ve also seen “born day”.
Oh, did you watch the trailer?  
He’s just pointing out a common Reddit trope of quoting the video everyone just watched. Relax. 
I too watched the trailer. 
I like that he’s out of the mask more. It makes it more realistic even in an unrealistic world. 
I mean I can appreciate wanting the best quality but not everyone can afford that. I have a black series Luke ANH saber I got at GameStop and I love it. I do wanna get upgrade the emitter though since the stock one is shitty plastic. 
Question: why do people here hate them so much? 
Perfection. 
He looks awful in Rebels. 
They won’t band t_d which is a worse cesspool than this place so why would they ever touch TDS? 
Can’t you dumb hicks just buy your guns off craigslist?  I’m assuming that’s the same place you buy meth. 
They have the NHS. What does the US have again?  OH WAIT...
From my experience working with actors they’re more focused on doing the scene than anything else. 
Pretty sure they get used to it. 
Except they’re not “stage lights”.  
 No 
I thought they were the same guy...
Their helmets reminded me of the robo-cops in THX-1138. Very retro-futuristic. 
Seriously?  Thought it was pretty obvious 
Sure sure which is why you still have a patreon account to fund your dumbass YouTube videos of your maddox character. 
I saw a FB screenshot where that was debunked though...
As long as he leaned his lesson and never offends again.  
It’s a word now. 
Jesus man, lay off the celebrity kool aid.

You’re right. You can’t be  a comedian since you’re not funny. 

You’re still fat. And stupid. And fat. 
Ehh
I make fun of the people you mentioned but I only hate YOU. The way you ride on dick’s coattails. Denzel doesn’t do that and he’s doing just fine. Larry doesn’t do that and he’s doing just fine. Be more like Larry and Denzel and keep your fat, greasy face out of TDS and it won’t be so bad. 
>I’m not a comedian

You play a character that’s a maddox spoof

>I’ve never said I was a comedian

Hahahahaha I’m a SJW now?  Great, you got me pegged. 
Isn’t this because he helped Yoda escape at the end of ROTS?  I like the theory but I always felt he was really shoe-horned into that movie. 
Lol something about paper towel dispensers. 
Dick doesn’t play my voicemails let alone have me on. 
>	Also, if we’re being honest, there was a period where Asterios turned into a bit of a gossip girl

The whole show is about hot goss. Why the fuck does that matter? 
I mean why does anybody hate Asterios?

Why does /u/madcucks hate him?  Aside from the fact he’s jealous Asterios is actually a professional comedian who is actually funny.  But because Asterios’ political views don’t align with Dick’s, madcucks gets center stage like the right-wing, fat, mongrol that he is. 
TDS is great. Just because you’re single handedly the worst thing about it doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy it.

Well said. 
Leia looks like a man and Obi Wan looks like his eyes are rolled back in his head because he’s summoning demons. 
I hadn’t noticed that. I wonder why. 
Wait what?  Is Disney against legacy aliens being in the films ?
Do you have a source on this?  Not that I don’t believe you but I’ve read this before but never seen where it came from. 

Also would the mouse even allow him to just “go rogue”. I feel like they’d have a lot of control over the story. 
They should have had him do this instead of directing TLJ. Seems like he has some unique ideas but some of them just didn’t work in the main saga. 
Makes me wonder when the last time her and George were in the same room together was. 
That’s somehow cute and depressing at the same time. 
Pretty sure that was answered in the boardroom scene in ANH. 
It should be astroturfing but apparently not. 
How will the movie ruin the book?  Its two very different mediums. If it's one of your favorite books that shouldn't change because the movie is bad. 
Wait what? I've never heard his about Spielberg...
Why would Ripley have it?  This is most likely a replica. 
You’re absolutely right. I believe the ANH lightsabers were rented so when they wrapped production they were sent back to the people they rented them from. 
It’s uncanny
BULL SHIT 
Gross.
The movie will probably be a complete bomb but this looks really cool.

At least it’s not as smug as that godawful “what’s a computer?!?!” ad. Who ever wrote that should be taken out and shot.  

Also this is the same ad with the text glitch pointed out by The Verge recently. 
Interesting. Did they have any other lightsabers?  I always see the Luke and Kylo ones at Game Stop. Target now carries the Obi Wan. 
Oh wow so was it just wrapped in bubble wrap?
Okay so dumb question time: I see these pico boards and such mentioned on here a lot.  If I was serious about modding a saber like this one where would I even start?
Damn, $88???  I paid $150 for it at GameStop when I got it a year ago. I’m assuming it’s cheaper now because of the Rey Black Series saber they released?  


😅

Great pics. Are you able to add a blade and sound to it if you want ?

Wow this is ridiculous lol
Ah, I see. I only ask because I was looking at the pictures and it look really accurate to me. I love the aging effects they added to the hilt. 
What’s not accurate about the gullwing?  I’m curious. 
Please no Rose in the next one. For the love of the force no rose. Please.

Vader looks so sick in ESB. I don’t think we ever see his helmet that shiny again. 
Such an awful, awful character. Worse than JarJar even. 
Nice of you to think of those poor poor shareholders 🙄
You should consider it since it’s deeply discounted on the Xbox store.

Do you seriously think EA is out on the streets with a tin cup begging people for money?  
Ironically neither was ‘The Last Jedi’.

How do we know for sure even was the third lesson? Cant you interpret her facing off against Snoke and Kylo the third lesson? Or why not just leave it ambiguous. Maybe the third lesson doesn’t really matter
🙄
How much ?
Oh, it’s beautiful. 
Love the Luke ROTJ saber. Where did you get it? 
Kinky
Obi-Wan vs Vader in ANH. It’s not flashy and fast by any means but it’s too old men who used to be best friends meeting again after so many years. So much importance and gravitas in one fight. 
Great, now I’m hungry.  
That scene with the kid picking up a broom was cheesy. Prequel level cheesy. 
No John Boyega?  Must think he’s too good to take a group pic. Or wants to distance himself from TLJ (can’t blame him) 
Ian McDiarmid turning into Sidious is possibly the best acting in all three prequel films. The contrast in his acting skills compared to Hayden’s in that scene is shocking. 
Should have shown Bride vs...Bill?  (shocking I know)
Solo. He was just a guy trying to get by in the Galaxy and gets tangled up with a princess/senator and farm boy/Jedi. Falls in love, has a kid who turns to the dark side so he takes off with his best buddy then gets tangled up in the drama again only to be killed via lightsaber. He didn’t choose to go out that way but did it anyway and it was very emotional. At least Luke chose to go out the way he did and did so when he was ready. 
Kill Bill fight...shows The Bride vs. O’ren...
Sounds tasty 😋
Are you kidding?  That raiding party scene was on some Ewok-level of awfulness. Glad it was cut. 
Wait where is this ?  South America? 
Just make sure to invite /u/PeachSaliva so she can complain about getting her tits grabbed.  
Just get it over with now. Only because I hate you.

True.

It’s not on the same level sure but it’s funny how dick turned that into what is easily the most awkward moment on the show ever instead of talking about it off air.  

It’s also funny how dick didn’t get Asterios was fucking joking around. For a satirist he sure is bad at picking up on satire. 
Funny how three people could take over the front page of this sub for two straight weeks by getting upvotes from the majority of idiots who frequent his sub. 
/r/PussyPassDenied  
Gab is shit. I hope it gets shutdown. 
Underrated comment 
Remember when Asterios made a crack about peach getting groped, dick flipped the fuck out on the show and in turn this sub lost their collective shit and turned against Asterios?  It’s amazing how fickle this sub is. 

Not to mention the time he called out madcucks for being a lying, unfunny faggot and people defended that moron even though he is a lying,  unfunny faggit who cannot stay in character to save his life. 

I’m glad Asterios is getting help but he better enjoy it while it lasts. 
You know me so well.

Yes
Shut up
I will make it legal
 Wow. So what I’m learning from these deleted scenes is that this movie could have been a whole lot cringier than it already is. 
Undeserved. 
Well what do you expect? Rian Johnson killed any and all gravitas that scene has. 
If this doesn’t prove to all the TLJ apologists how much Rian Johnson ruined Star Wars I don’t know what will. 
Wow, very well made. How the hell did they get that last shot of the moon blown up like that though?  That’s insane.

Not all the way through but after 20 minutes I couldn’t stand Cloverfield Paradox. What an awful, pointless movie. 
I don’t actively buy things that are bad for the environment 
Why does GL engage these idiots?  Just keep your mouth shut and keep walking. 
I imagine it requires multiple layers of paint so that it actually sticks? 
It’s amazing how much detail they put in when you don’t even get to see most of it on screen. Especially for a movie with such dark lighting. This was awesome either way, I wish more productions would release timelapses like this. 
You’re not missing much. 
Like that blatant ad for Cliff bars that’s made it to the front page of at least three subreddits?  This site was bought and paid for a long time ago. 
Rian Johnson and the soy boys over at Disney Corp. ruined Star Wars.

Oh well. Should have seen the movie when it came out.

Meh. She signed the release.

Interesting. I remember watching a video of the prop maker of ANH and him saying he found the old graflex handles in a shop. He made it seem like he bought them from the guy. Didn’t mention that they were rented or anything. 
What do you mean no hero props survived ANH?  Like what happened to them?  They wrapped filming and they just disappeared ? 
>	Luke doesn’t give a fuck about it in TLJ...

Thanks to Rian Johnson.  TFA ended on such a powerful moment with Rey handing it to Luke. 

>	I found the whole force vision thing totally unnecessary as well.

Again, ruined by RJ.  This was supposed to carry over and have some meaning/explanation. Instead we got alien titty milk. 
What do I look like I have patreon bucks?
Link?
I’m sure a megacorp like Disney can’t afford to grease a few palms. 
Yeah but RO was meant to be a gritty story. 
He doesn’t like how the new movies are handling Luke. Remember he had to back-peddle about it on twitter after Disney brought the iron fist down on him. 

It sucks because he obviously cares a lot about the character and he hates to see it get destroyed by the mouse and RJ. 
Why is the box on the same side as the bunny ears/red button?  First of all it’s not canon and second it looks weird. 
🤣
Let’s hope not. 
>gem

No. 
What did I just watch?  Looks awfully low budget. 
But those are books and comics and a video game campaign that most people won’t read/play. It would be cool to have a show or mini-series showing the fall of the empire post-Endor and the rise of the resistance and FO. I really just wanna see Han, Luke and Leia go on their own paths. 

Maybe at some point we get to see a young Kylo and Rey growing up. We could see hints of him leaning towards the dark side and see Rey’s shitty parents and how they end up abandoning her on Jakku. 
I like the idea of a Resistance show but why would you want it between episodes 8 and 9?  I’d wanna see it post Endor-battle and maybe have it go right up to when Force Awakens starts. 
I don’t blame him for being bitter about that. All that hoopla about Star Wars coming back and he’s on screen for 10 seconds at the very end and has no dialogue.  
The critics are shills.

Wait what?  Battle droids were a prequel/TCW era characters. Why are they in Rebels ?
I would hate to be the author of this book and have it in any way confused with the movie. 
I don’t blame him.  Poor guy had to struggle through watching TLJ multiple times.
KOTOR is such a renowned game I don’t think any new game would ever live up to it. 
More like Star Wars fans hate The Last Jedi and for good reason. 
Finally someone who actually has some cred in making more than one good movie (see: Looper). 
>radioactive wasteland

2120?  With the current regime you can expect that by 2020. 
Why do all those women have the same eyes??? Is it the makeup of the time? 
Episode 9 will literally be 3 hours of Rey drinking green alien titty milk and the fans on this sub will talk about how "courageous" it is and praise the film for "pushing the envelope". 
I'm pretty sure I've seen this video on here before and I'm pretty sure you just freebooted it and upload it to reddit's shitty video hosting service.  
> than what the prop department can dish out

hahaha I'm sure the producers of THE biggest movie franchise on the planet trust their prop department to make hilts with some plastic led tubes on them.  It's not rocket science.  They're not re-inventing the goddam wheel for a light-up plastic tube.  Get over yourself.  Its a multi-million dollar movie.  They're not gonna rely on some yokel to make their props for them.

Edit: I'm sure all the lightsaber props in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48mYdWodhR4) could have been made by Ultrasabers right?  Even the rubber ones used for stunts? LOL
Madcucks is the only person whom I hope gets sued for every penny he has. 
No they didn’t. That was just a rumor on r/lightsabers. The owner of the company who supposedly made props for the new films even denied it. Those lightsabers you see in the movies were made by the prop department. Why would a bunch of professionals outsource that? 

Edit: also how do you make a prop for a movie that’s not even out yet ? 
The whole movie was a sitcom. 
If this comment “broke” you must have a pretty easy life. 
>	the fact that they play it off as a joke is the problem

You mean the entirety of The Last Jedi?  The most expensive Spaceballs sequel ever made. 
>How was this cut?

They didn’t want the final film to be even crappier. 
Most Star Wars movies are a thousand times better than what we got with TLJ. 
Why would the stormtroopers believe a traitor?  Kinda dumb.  
Those two hosts are obnoxious. 

The deleted scene was super cringey (as if TLJ wasn’t full of cringe already). 

>Phasma: You’re scum
Finn: Rebel scum

Oh lord. Who writes that??? 

I like John Boyega but his acting in that scene was atrocious. 
What the hell is wrong with him?
>	his characters are often annoying as hell

Like the Jedi kid in Rebels?  I don’t get how he’s the main character. He’s so whiny.  
I know it’s been discussed to death on here but this was painfully obvious when RJ said “fuck Rey’s parents/backstory. Fuck Snoke’s backstory. Rey’s vision?  Throw it in the garbage. Anakin’s lightsaber, the most iconic weapon in movie history?  Let’s have crabby old Luke toss it like yesterday’s garbage. Speaking of Luke let’s make him tell bad jokes and drink alien titty milk”. 

RJ completely undermined everything JJ set up and basically slaughtered any respectability this franchise still had. 

Still gonna buy the Blu-ray tho. 
So at some point they skip over the OT movies?  Do Han, Luke or Leia ever make an appearance?  So many questions...
Yoda looks awful in Rebels. What happened??? Also Anakin looks like a weird surfer bro. The only character that improved in Rebels is Mon Mothma. 
Pacing issues aside, Rogue One is a great movie. Sad that a much smaller story is better than what TLJ did. 
Maybe he’s born-again with it...
Glad you’re okay being a shill
Oh should they?  Please tell me what makes you an expert in broadcast television?  It’s a morning news program.  Fluff comes with the territory. 
Eww why does he look like he’s made of grease?  He looks like meth Jim Belucci.  
Why does everyone in japan look healthy and happy?  If this was done in an American restaurant it would be quite the opposite. 
/r/HailCorporate 
Oh it’s beautiful. 
The more I read the more this movie sounds like a one big disaster. 
There was no ship. You’re just seeing what you want to see. 
Looks more badass like this than with that weird cone head. 
How much money does Lucas have that he could afford that ?  I mean I know he must be filthy rich but pre-Disney sale was he a billionaire?  
Her holding that little wooden pendant Anakin gave her in Ep 1 was a really nice touch. 
I think Rogue One did a great job of capturing a darker, grittier Star Wars universe. There was no fluff in that movie. No stupid porgs, no jar jar or Ewoks.
But does he smell crime? 
Oh wow op I really enjoyed seeing this picture the last time it was posted a couple weeks ago 
😮
Her last IMDb credit lists her as asst. to George Lucas. 
¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
I’ve never felt the need to brute force my way into a show. I’ve also never started a shitty, right-wing podcast hosted by faggots. 
That would be badass to see them fighting with lightsabers. 
Maybe it’s made of vibranium? Lol 
Not fat enough. Or dumb enough. Not unfunny enough. 
Named after Albert Gary of judiciary fame. 
What are you doing to combat astroturfing and obvious posts meant to shill for a product or company?  It’s pretty bad especially with Tesla. Constant shills everywhere.  
An iPad with a Bluetooth keyboard. 
So much for equality right? 
A way to hire token minorities on all film productions. 
You didn’t host a successful sketch show on Comedy Central and gained enough exposure to get a movie made?  
Mans not hot. 
Perfection. 
You should show it to your dad so he can cry about it then post about it to Reddit. 
I agree. No ones gonna speak truth to power when their career is in the balance. It’s not until things come to a head that they turn around and act shocked about this shit going on for so long even though everyone knew it was happening. Then they have the nerve to lecture us about it. 
An OLD idiot. 
>What does it mean

More Hollywood liberal bullshit. 
Let’s see her make him have an “inclusion rider” on his films. 
Christ what a terrible speech “Hurr hurr inclusion rider duuurrrr!!!!”  
Makes it even worse that he knew something was wrong and didn’t say anything until it was too late. 
Here we fucking go. Let people celebrate one of their own getting a win. Why do idiots like you have to come in every time “DUUURRRRR IT SHOULDNT BE ABOUT RACE DUUURRRRR”.   Idiots on reddit are so fucking out of touch. 

Edit: oh look a the Donald user. Makes sense.  
“Oh shit oh shit this would never actually happen oh shit oh shit you’re an idiot.”
Warren Beaty is an idiot. Why would they have him do it again?
And Jezebel will write an article about how "creepy" this is in 3...2..1...
Ugh. Shut up. 
>	I really hope r/movies doesn’t become so insufferable 

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA where the fuck have you been?  
That’s Hollywood for you. 
Or maybe the fuckin guy should have been at the mic a lot sooner instead of taking his sweet time. 
You’re so smart. 
Holy shit I didn’t notice that 🤣
Nuts. 
This is the first RPG I ever played. Amazing.  
LOL!
Guardians of the Galaxy: A Star Wars Story. 
Haven’t seen this movie and I don’t mind spoilers. Context? 
You call those decent?
Force push. I’d push slow people and cars out of my way. 
Just being realistic.  Half of all marriages end in divorce and with marines I bet it’s even higher. 
Hurr hurr so funny 
No. 
Try saying this at r/Apple and you’ll get crucified. 
You’re a sleazy douchebag. How does it feel?
What a wonderful and misunderstood culture. 
Go fuck yourself. 
Do you know what a downvote is?  have one. 
/r/HailCorporate 
Quit spamming your shit, OP
[Watch this clip ](https://youtu.be/ZoiRJnr-rtU) from TFA when Finn fights the stormtrooper. It’s subtle but the flicker is there. 
Nuts. 
‘Anakin’s’ lightsaber that Rey uses does flicker in the new films. It doesn’t flicker a lot but it does enough to notice it. 
>	the housing prices are high AF

And L.A. is a cheap place to live. 🙄🖕🏼
I thought hera was in rebels. Isn’t this clone wars?
Shill. 
Makes sense. 
I thought she mentioned the Old Testament because he’s Jewish?  Isn’t the OT the Jewish version of the Bible? 
Oh snap you’re the guy who did Domestic?! Fucking great video man. I love how it just is without rhyme or reason. 
“Hurr hurr  Internet memes hurr hurr hurr” -Wreck It Ralph writers probably. 
Stupid. Edgy but stupid. 
Found the autist. 
Whys that kid wearing capri pants and sandals?  Looks like a chick. 
😼
In the OT I believe they painted the blades by hand. In the prequels and sequel trilogy I’m pretty sure they’re rotoscoped which is easy to do in After Effects. I just don’t know why they’d rotoscope them so different between the prequels and sequels. 
God damn.  Where did you get all those graflex handles from??? I thought they were extremely rare. 
Fuck OFF gallowboob
She looks 40?  Crazy to think this was in high school. 
“Genius”
Hell yes. Three day weekends. 
Why does Vader have a pointy snout?
Heard it was a PUBG ripoff 
Lived there. Not that easy but I agree on the breweries. Uinta is awesome. 
I mean any place in the US is better than the south. 
>	so he could get Anakin closer to being trained by the Jedi by an impulsive young Jedi, knowing that would rub off on him. 

Who’s this impulsive young Jedi you’re referring to here? 
From this angle you can’t see the oppressive Mormon culture. 
Libertarians are retards 
Is fortnite any good ?
Why would they cut this?  This is hilarious. 
I'm all for legalization but potheads are an insufferable bunch.  This stupid kid deserved it.
Those movies you listed are okay, semi-boring movies no one remembers except film nerds who wanna show off their film "cred".  

edit: and Barton Fink isn't about making a movie as it is about writing one.  Doesn't count.
Well he also didn't direct it (officially) but the guy who did was english and he probably just wanted an english actor.
This looks like an ad. Nice job OP
