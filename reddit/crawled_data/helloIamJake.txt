Odd request but can we get some energetic electronic music instead? I don't get it FeelsBadMan
Fuck r9k mode

I JUST got a 144hz. lmao
I feel like I probably can't do this on my 85 ping. FeelsBadMan
Crowd is noticebly more hype today. I love it. 
Neuromancer?
THEY'RE SPECTATING THE DEFENDERS! PogChamp
I wanted Dallas to 4-0 just because of Flame
The team itself has been around since beta, and they've been called the boys in blue since they became nV.
PRODUCTION NEEDS TO GET THEIR SHIT TOGETHER. this is painful. 
Now I know why they put this on mlg and not twitch for the preseason... "VALIANT WINS!" LUL
The plan is just to play 4 maps. If they are 2-2 then a tiebreaker on koth. The purpose is scheduling, if I had to guess.

Idk, he's married I think so that's why I thought that
Who's the oldest SK player? I'm guessing Saebyolbe?
monkaS
Oh true. I forgot how he's the #1 most humble and generous player. 
Lmao. If it was pretty simple, then how is mykl, the #2 tracer and genji in the world, not top500? I rest my case.
Wait what? Not Haksal BibleThump
Yes. I normally get 65, I'm now getting 80. Not a huge difference but every ms matters imo.

Rez is a mechanic that should not exist. 
Me too :D

>add 10 gb of video files to the game. 
An example would be making riskier plays, playing heroes you're not as good at, etc.
I really hope something like this comes to Overwatch. I would do this a lot, I want to help improve the community and ban cheaters/throwers as much as I can.

1. Play every hero, at least for a little while. When you know every hero's ultimate, abilities, what they're good at, their synergies (such as pharah and mercy) then you will improve when you play with and against these heroes. 


2. Pay attention to the ultimate callouts:

For example: When you're playing Soldier and you use your ultimate, you say "I've got you in my sights". You hear the same callout when the enemy soldier ults. If the soldier on *your* team ults, however, he says "tactical visor activated."



He feeds ult charge like no other tank though. 
"pick up that can."

That's just the ping I get on the PTR, because there is only one PTR server and it's in California. In the live game is get 60ms :D
Yeah there are tons more colors, I edited my original comment with pics of the choices
Correct!
Yes it's real, it's on the PTR!

6 ping? How?? Does he live next door to a server or something?? My ping is literally 11 times his. 
You said you played hog in another comment, so if you still want to be a tank, try d.va. Your‚Äã defense matrix can protect your team and completely nullify her rockets and ultimate. You can also force her to retreat by flying on her and doing some damage.

I'm ok with this. As long as we get new map/modes/better training range, I'm good. 
Hey, I'm one of the scrubs in this! :D

Wow, I never noticed.
Like Genji, with wall climb and dash, or Lucio , with speed boost and wall ride.

as opposed to Mercy, a high mobility healer who depends on her team for points to fly to. 
Good point, but with his radius changes he has to stay close to his team, sacrificing mobility. 
I really want them to work on more healers. 

I hope we get a high mobility healer (not one that depends on their teams positions)
Best of luck to you dude, hope you have fun playing. 
I would honestly queue for this even if there is no SR reward. I'd love the practice, and to be able to help a team that would otherwise be steamrolled. 
I loved the world cup, because it was so unique. Players from different teams playing together was awesome to watch. 

Keeping a full team together would kinda ruin the point. There are many tourneys (and the upcoming OWL) where we'll get to watch full teams face off. 
Yes it's based off your season high. 
It does that automatically if there is no healer. 
How embarrassing.

Press these keys to pause the practice range for any amount of time, press them again to unpause.

They just wanted a random map to test the 2CP changes. Could have been volskaya or Anubis, didn't matter. 
I can give you some advice if you post a vod. 
Wait a while, but keep in mind that she will be disabled in competitive for a week after she goes live. 
Yes, exactly this. I always avoid comp on weekends, especially Sunday. 
Thank you, that's great advice. I'll keep that in mind. 
Thank you!
This vid has multiple matches in it. First match starts at 35 seconds.

Also /r/Overwatchuniversity. I suggest this one over /r/competitiveoverwatch because it talks a lot more about the actual game, and not the pro scene.

Thank you dude, I hope so :)
