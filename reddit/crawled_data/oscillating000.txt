Yea, it definitely sounds good. I just felt like shitting on DSI for their high prices.
Title: "Facebook rolls out trial of 'dislike' button for downvoting comments"

Quote from article: "The spokeswoman said the new feature was not an official “dislike” button but an additional feature,"
The more people think these "leaks" are real, the less I think they actually listen to Nine Inch Nails. This sounds absolutely nothing like NIN apart from the vocal sample at the end.

Besides...why would someone only leak 7 seconds of a track? Actually, who renders 7 random seconds of audio from a full song anyways (seemingly for no reason; this length isn't really useful for anything that would require it to be exported from the DAW), then leaves it unsecured?
Everyone sees what was done there.
low energy, even.
It's just a $200 volca with a $300 DSI logo on it.
I think it was a joke, bro.

**Edit:** Replying to tell me "fuck off" is also an appropriate response, I guess...
These two will have magnificently illiterate babies.
Last time I checked, Discogs wasn’t allowing people to sell the bootlegs in their marketplace.
To be fair, “/r/prequelmemes is leaking” is in every thread because it’s usually true. That sub and its users are cancer.
Where do you guys even find these 10k Days and Ænima bootlegs? I want one!

>not making sense.

Welcome to music "journalism."
Beyond the top 5, things are generally pretty messy, but this is how I currently feel.

1. NTS Sessions 1-4
2. elseq 1–5
3. Quaristice (Versions) / Quaristice.Quadrange.ep.ae / Quaristice
4. Exai / L-event
5. Move of Ten / Oversteps

Coincidentally, I don't know of any other artist/group I listen to with all 5 of their most recent studio albums in my top 5 favorites from them. Æ just continue to evolve so much.

**Edit:** I also will concede that I haven't spent nearly enough time with NTS Sessions 1-4 yet. Regardless, it's currently my favorite, and likely will be for a long time. It's like they decided they needed a Greatest Hits compilation, so they just made new material that contains the best aspects of everything they've ever done, then released that instead.

elseq 1–5 came close to this level of greatness, but somehow the NTS Sessions (despite being twice as long) feel more focused. Even when they're retreading the same territory as some of the elseq material, the new tracks feel like they have more depth to them, and the greater lengths give them even more time to expand and morph over time to reveal underlying subtleties that might have otherwise been buried. All of the tracks on the NTS Sessions could have been easily cut down to 4-6 minutes, and they would have been fantastic, but instead, we got the exploded diagrams of those songs with all the details laid bare and given their own time in the spotlight.

The previously massive amount of material we got during the Quaristice era was a sort of "proof of concept" of this idea; that the same parameters that were used to make one of the album's tracks could be tweaked slightly, and made into a totally new creation that is still rooted somewhere in the original. My biggest issue with Exai is that they didn't take the same approach, though we've been seeing bits of those tracks popping up occasionally in newer material.
>Cowboyitis

Inflammation of the cowboy?
The stupidity fits the sub perfectly, tbh
Oh, so you *weren't* actually joking. You just have no idea what you're talking about.
>iPhones that give the US government and the Apple government front door access, making back doors redundant. Nexus Android is not much better.

That's not a joke. That's just an unsubstantiated claim.  
Jokes are funny. All you did was make a false statement.
>It's not outrageous, that was a joke, and you're an idiot.

JK guys I was only pretending to be stupid.
I would ask for a source on this outrageous claim, but:

\>Apple government

Yea...I'm gonna pass.
>CD pressings are compressed

I've just got a minor nitpick here:

If mastered properly, CD-DA is not "compressed" in the sense you're talking about. It is likely resampled and dithered (if the source audio was digital; there's obviously some ADC involved if there's an analog medium like tape in the lineage), but not compressed in any way that has an impact on the audio (again, if the mastering engineer knows what he/she is doing).

There have been CD releases sourced from lossy master material (usually a huge no-no unless higher-quality source material is just absolutely not available), but as you likely know, that's not the norm.

Beyond that, you're totally right. The differences in the audio pressed to vinyl and the audio pressed to CD are imperceptible to any human's ear, as long as the source material is identical (*i.e.*, the same master was used to press both formats). Once the audio makes it onto the medium, CD routinely outperforms vinyl as a matter of course; it has a lower noise floor, no surface noise, and tracks identically across the vast majority of playback systems. Anyone claiming that vinyl is a technically superior format is simply misinformed, and anyone claiming that they can actually hear a difference between 16/44.1 and some higher resolution like 24/96+ is either experiencing a playback system malfunction (like intermodulation distortion, or coloration from some component in the signal chain) or the placebo effect; otherwise, their hearing is a scientific anomaly and they would likely be paid well for their participation in some medical studies.
I get the feeling from the review that the writer is either one of us (here in the ae sub), or was at least following our discussion during the live streams.
Mad jealous of that Analog Heat. I bet that sounds awesome with the 37.

How do you like the Tempest?
That doesn't make it funny. That makes it sad. That person probably needs counseling.
>When in comes to limited, special boxes, etc. You should know no rules apply. 

Which is exactly why it's relevant. We're talking about a limited pressing.
Not really.

Source: the new Sleep album.

As soon as the first RSD copies appeared on shelves, they were being listed on discogs for $420 (because lololol marijuana amiriteguise?!).

Same with the new John Maus box set. They were $110 directly from the label, but priced upwards of $350 just days after the first shipments went out.

Same with the latest Frank Ocean vinyl. They were reasonably priced while the general sale was up (I think $40 or so?), but the flippers immediately tried to sell their copies on Discogs and eBay for $300+, often before they had even arrived at their doorstep.

See also: the stupid expensive copies of *Ænima* which go unsold on Discogs for years because nobody in their right mind wants to pay $600 for a single LP from a 2-disc set with no sleeve.

The Discogs marketplace and eBay are just the enablers, but record flippers are seeking insane profits from limited vinyl releases these days. I guarantee that the 12xLP set will start appearing for absurd prices on Discogs within minutes of the announcement that they're being shipped.
>for truly soulless automated music look no further than auto-engineered pop

Sorry bro, but if Pop music engineered itself, I'd be rich as fuck right now.

While Pop can be formulaic at times, writing a good Pop song/album and actually engineering and mixing it so that is fits in with the million-dollar productions on Pop radio is just as much art as it is science.

Just FYI OP, the word you were looking for is "drivel."
I'm really hoping it's just referring to the "all end" of the NTS Sessions.
Hey buddy. Remember this post?
That last title has me worried...
It just changed to 5 tracks a minute ago, but the download isn't starting yet.

...and it's downloading now. 5 tracks. Last one is called "all end". I might cry...
At least an hour, but probably closer to 1h 10m
So ready to download this. My account page just changed and now shows NTS4 with "0 tracks," so it's happening.
Even the mp3 files are very high quality; they're encoded with LAME at 320 kbps, which is the absolute highest quality supported by the mp3 codec. There will be very little audio information missing from those files compared to the FLAC or WAV versions, and what little is missing is going to be 99.999% inaudible, especially on cheap earbuds.
They might actually have to split this track in half across two sides to get it to fit on the vinyl.
I seriously cannot wait to put this whole collection on shuffle one day and see what kind of adventure I end up on.
Seriously, if this thing's title doesn't reference bladelores, I'm gonna feel very bamboozled.

**Edit:** Anyone else here just now realizing that the treatment of this sound (which was present in bladelores as well) is very reminiscent of *The Disintegration Loops*?
Would be nuts if one of the sides ended with a locked groove of ambient
o shit waddup
35 minutes; something is coming
I guess it's possible, but there are so many elements of Exai and elseq in these tracks that they feel like new creations.
So this is pretty much definitely getting it's own side of one of the 12 LPs
For real though, this has heavy Oversteps/Move of Ten vibes
Oh shit here we go
Yea, this stuff is great.
💀 S C A R Y 💀
You guys who wanted more ambient stuff are definitely getting your wish today.
gonk subrange casual
Right, because it's still technically an unauthorized duplication of copyrighted material. Nevermind the fact that it's useless without a license key, or that you could freely download all of the software included on this disc on your own without legal repercussions (though it would still be equally useless without a license to use the OS).

Copyright law in this country is in serious need of reform if this is the sort of thing that can land a person in a federal prison.
Well...this is off to a very interesting start
>Well Mono is just summed up Stereo.

Mono is a single channel of audio. If you try to play two channels of audio on a monaural speaker, it's likely that they will be summed to mono, but mono recordings — by definition — only contain one audio channel, not two identical channels panned hard left and right.

The result might be practically the same, but "mono is just summed up stereo" is not true.
>The retail value of these disks was $25.

Except they have no license attached, so they are worth nothing.
I just dumped my entire mp3 library into my personal music directory on my work PC, and I manually add new stuff to it as I buy/rip it. Computer use policy in my position is pretty lenient b/c I'm in a mid-tier IT support role, so you should try to find out if your workplace is gonna freak out if they find 80 GB of music on your computer, but even with all the streaming services and home media servers I've tried out, just playing the files locally has never failed me.
I can only assume people are upvoting this without looking at the screenshots. This looks horrible.
>the other contents himself with saying "hmm interesting" whenever I play it on the car stereo. 

To be fair, that's a perfectly appropriate reaction if Autechre is the most leftfield/experimental music you've ever been exposed to, and quite a lot better than "it's just noise."
Almost exactly 1 year ago, I lost a close friend who was the only person I ever knew IRL who appreciated Autechre even close to as much as I do. Exai was his favorite, and I wish he were still around to hear the amazing stuff R&S are doing these days. I'd give just about anything to have a few drinks and spin the new box set with him when it shows up.

Sorry to get sappy, but with all the mental shit I've been dealing with lately, and the anniversary of his death coming up, it's gonna be a tough week for me.
I've already got the CDs preordered, so I keep telling myself that I don't need the LPs, but a small part of me wants to just buy it anyway.
Yes. Embrace the gonk. Gonk is life. Gonk is everything.

Welcome to the fan club, though.
Donald Trump became very close with Roger Ailes and other big-wigs at FNC, especially once he found household-name status with The Apprentice. They practically groomed him for his Presidential runs, and are likely responsible for many of his hardline policy shifts post-9/11. The sort of stances he currently has on topics like immigration, nuclear proliferation, and election law (among other things) were rarely — if ever — discussed in public prior to his first run for President; what little information we do have about his earlier stances on those issues is mostly gathered from courtroom documentation or on-air calls he made to programs on FNC or other large media corporations.

Trump wasn't much of a political figure during the '80s and '90s, but he certainly became one during the '00s.
No. It looks like cartoonish CGI because of the weird lighting effects on the photo.
Today, you learned a valuable lesson about WikiHow.
Your first mistake was expecting someone who listens to Xxxteensensation to know things ~~about music~~.

You want moogmusic.com

There are at least two other manufacturers that I know of — in completely unrelated fields — who brand their products with the name “Moog.”

>Exactly...

This only works if your assumption is correct.
>I don’t use optical media, so obviously nobody does
No. It’s just a really shitty pun.
No. “So” is the correct spelling.
If your CD plays, the remaining audio hasn’t lost any information. Once it’s degraded to any significant degree, it just stops playing.

You could theoretically play a vinyl recording so many times that it sounds like someone put a bandpass filter on the whole thing because the very high and low frequency content has just been rounded off.

The CD *may* physically deteriorate faster than its vinyl counterpart, but making a verbatim, 1:1 copy of the audio data on a CD is trivial. The audio on the CD doesn’t experience subtle changes over time.

I gotta ask: did this thing come with a download card for FLACs?

I managed to find a lossless version of it at a place on the Internet which claims it was sourced from the web (i.e., not a CD rip), but I can't find anywhere on the TMR website to actually buy the FLAC. I'd hate to buy both the CD and vinyl if I can get lossless digital downloads with my vinyl copy.
The one time SWIM dabbled with that stuff, he tried to stay as far away from æ as humanly possible. He probably figured it would make for a very disturbing time, and being so gonked out of his mind, he was having a hard time remembering which tracks were the chill ones, so he just played *Lateralus* instead.
Friendship ended with *elseq*. Now *NTS Sessions 1-4* is my best friend.
Uh...no shit, guys.
Dopesmoker was originally released in '99. It hasn't quite been 20 years yet.
This post is bad and you should feel bad.
>For example, the complaint writes that Russia repeatedly communicated with agents of the campaign about its desire to hurt Clinton, **which is true**. It goes on to say that “the Trump Campaign and its agents” welcomed that help. **Agents did**. Did “the campaign”? There’s a nebulous border to where “the campaign” is drawn, which has certainly been to Trump’s advantage over the past year. But is it fair to say that “the campaign” welcomed help because adviser George Papadopoulos didn’t tell federal authorities that he’d been told about the Russians having dirt on Clinton?

[emphasis added]

Those two statements of fact there? That stuff is important.  
Those questions the analyst is asking? Those are the questions *everyone* who cares about this is asking. None of these questions get answered without investigation, and the answers never come to light without reporting.


>The DNC complaint tries to have it both ways. In one section, they tout Trump’s public praise of WikiLeaks as incriminating. In the next, they detail various times that the campaign tried to cover up its connections to the Russians. Look, either they didn’t want attention drawn to their criminal conspiracy — which is what the DNC alleges existed — or they did.

The interesting thing about that? It's the DNC making those claims; *i.e.*, not me. I didn't file that lawsuit. My affiliation with the DNC extends only as far as being registered as a Democrat voter in my state and occasionally receiving their mailers in my mailbox. I think this lawsuit is just as dumb as you probably do (though likely for different reasons), but if the mountain of circumstantial evidence that is already public knowledge could help find empirical proof of wrongdoing (or lack thereof), it deserves to be investigated.

It's also worth noting that the President has not been indicted, because trying to pin conspiracy on someone based solely upon circumstantial evidence is shaky ground. The ones who *have* gone down were not indicted on spurious charges, though. That's the point of having an investigation.

**Edit:** Another point you might be missing, is that this lawsuit is probably just a ploy by the DNC to compel discovery.
In my experience, it's been the '85–'95 kids who seem to have the best grasp on this type of stuff; not because they grew up with computers, but because computers grew up with them. Lots of them remember a time before search engines and online support communities were available on every device you owned to help solve basic computer problems, and you either had to ask someone who knew what they were doing for help IRL, or you figured it out on your own.

Not to say that younger kids can't be just as proficient, but the progression that a lot of people my age experienced throughout the '90s and '00s probably gave us a different insight into how things worked.
Dodged when he should have weaved
When the demand and money are right, I guess it would be hard to resist leaving cash on the table, but...it's still a choice. I can't imagine wanting to do *anything* that demanding for every day of the year.
Countless leaked and verified documents which paint this damning picture, and multiple indictments of members of Trump's campaign is just "circumstantial" I guess...
>but what new did we learn from it?

We learned that there is proof of it. Actual recordings. Something more than hearsay or speculation.

>This new only appeals to those who don't like Trump and re-emphasis what we already know.

It also appeals to us people who think that facts and sources matter when you're making allegations against someone. It appeals to people who understand that empirical proof is stronger than circumstantial evidence.
>It’s just funny the thing that was supposed to get him didn’t.

You're still misinterpreting the entirety of the progression of the story. The IAs investigating this mess have yet to release any information which flatly denies that Trump and his campaign staff conspired with Russian government operatives to influence the 2016 elections; on the contrary, all of the newest revelations have shown evidence that the conspiracy probably goes deeper than what was originally suspected.

It's not "the thing that was supposed to get him didn't," it's "the thing that's going to get him leads to a hundred other equally disturbing things."

In threads like these, there are a lot of disingenuous and baiting questions. Yours *could have* been read as an accusatory rhetorical question, so people probably downvoted thinking you were trolling.

It’s a sad reality of political discussion on Reddit, but it is what it is.
Mongo only pawn in game of life.
This is not the same story just because he used the same stupid trick more than once in his life.

Double jeopardy doesn’t apply if you commit the same crime twice.
> Trump is Putin’s puppet. Then trump colluded with Russia. Then trump had members of his political party that were colluding. Now it’s about if they got money from Russia. 

These things are all related. You’re confusing the reporting of newly available information as the moving of goalposts.

Nobody who is actually paying attention has stopped or will stop paying attention to the progression of those stories just because a new scandal arises.
Absolutely. If Trump’s carefully curated multi-billionaire image didn’t stick, nobody outside of a small group of NYC real estate tycoons would have ever even heard of him.

His entire claim to fame is being worth a lot of money, but stories like this show that he’s been lying to inflate the numbers since *at least* 30 years ago.

If it weren’t for the his appearances on the Forbes list, he never would have become the household name he is, he would never have become famous for being rich and famous, and President Trump would have never happened.

Edit: Not to mention the large swaths of people who claimed Trump would be a good President because he’s so rich that he couldn’t be corrupted. As if.
Damn, son. That’s some nice projection you got there. 1080p? 4K? How expensive are the bulbs? You thinking about selling it anytime soon?

This story is no less sad/stupid/disgusting/hilarious just because it describes events that took place in the ‘80s.
No. Wrong tapes.
Just saying, if this is something “we all knew,” you’d have asked yourself that question a long time ago.
I went to RSD in 2011, showed up in the middle of the day, and got the last of my local store's 2 copies of both items I went in after: the 2xLP version of *The OF Tape, Vol. 2*, Yeasayer's *End Blood* 7", and I even managed to snag a Minus the Bear 7" that I didn't know was being released that day.

I went a few years later, much earlier in the day this time, looking for Green Day's *Demolicious* **on CD**, and they were apparently gone not long after the place opened, despite the fact that even the more hardcore GD fans I know didn't like *Uno...Dos...Tre!* very much (not to mention the demo versions). Those things showed up sealed on eBay within hours for at least twice the original retail price.

Not saying that flipping wasn't a problem in the first few years of RSD, but it seems to have gotten progressively worse over the years. At this point, I don't even bother going anymore. The diminishing number of legitimately good releases all get sold out within a matter of minutes, then the random novelty crap that nobody wants hangs out on the discount shelves for years. I've never run a record store, but I can't imagine what a nightmare RSD stock management is for the owners of small shops like the ones I frequent.
God damn this is accurate.
That is a Giorgio Moroder cut called "From Here to Eternity", from an album of the same name. It was also recently covered by Shooter Jennings on his EP *Countach (for Giorgio)*. I highly recommend both releases.
They weren't far off, tbh
Oh okay. Well point me to a manufacturer that “throttles” their smartphone’s battery after 90 days so I can avoid them.
I became a fan of NIN shortly after *The Slip* was released. I declined to purchase tickets to see them live on the LitSNA tour, figuring I'd have the chance when they came through again and I was a bigger fan, and they announced the "hiatus" shortly after. I was shook for real.
Yep. 10 years between *Double Vulgar II* and *The Golden Communion*.

Still, the wait from *Channel Orange* to *Endless* and *Blonde* felt like forever. And most people didn’t start actually getting the album version of *Endless* until last week.

Tool is just plain torture.

NIN has been good to us recently, but that’s really not a norm for TR.
OH, okay. I'm with you now.
I agree with that. It would have been more funny if it wasn't fake, but I just don't think that it's not funny at all because it *is* fake.
Look, man...I don't know what to tell you. I think this post is funny even if it's fake, and it very likely is fake. It's probably less funny if you don't think Trump's base is a large group of stupid/ignorant people, since you won't think there's anything ironic about the combination of those two bumper stickers.
Well...irony ≠ coincidence, so you might want to reevaluate your position on this once you've got all the necessary data.
Plenty of fictional comedies employ situational irony. Those shows and movies are no less funny just because they're being played on soundstages by actors.
This just in: All fictional comedies are not funny.

Shut it all down, boys!
They don't work nearly as well as they claim to.

Edit: And not just this particular product, but probably all similar ones. I bought a stainless steel version that was about three times the price of this plastic crap and it did little more than nothing.

Thankfully, the HS8s handle sub-bass well enough for me not to need a subwoofer most of the time, but Autechre makes me want one pretty bad lately.
I love how this session has sounded on my monitors (HS8s represent!), but I can't wait to hear the FLACs on headphones. Moments like this are exactly why headphones exist.
Some nice panned syncopation happening now. I'm really digging this current vibe.
I'm in love with that noisy shaker sound that crept in over the past few minutes.
Autechre are proving that music is just a theory.

Y'all need to relax with the downvotes. This man speaks truth. Current track is definitely full of familiar sounds, and it *is* a very nice new arrangement of those sounds. This shit ~~slaps~~ gonks.
This sub bass is rattling my bones.
Æ feature on new Death Grips confirmed!
Fuck 'em. This is extremely soothing. I love it when æ do this stuff.
Yea, they're a little painful for me as well, but that's mostly because of how much cranking I did at the beginning of the set. S&R frequently remind me to be careful with the volume knob. Gotta set it at a comfortable level and leave it alone.

Autechre is probably the only "band" that I will ever allow to literally abuse my ears with their music, though. It's usually worth it.
This track has been a very wild ride.
**30 minutes left**

Very heavy sub-bass happening now at **1h 23m**

Sounds like this one is going to undergo some big changes
You killed it, bro. :(
True, but it didn't have as much of an overt melody and/or harmony progression going on as this current track.
More like they tortured an Oversteps track.
Which obviously makes it the most fun to hang out and bend face with.
...aaaaaaand it's gone.
Oh shit, we have an actual melody.
Agreed. I feel like most of their post-*Chiastic* sounds have been well represented throughout these sessions so far, with the exception of ~~*Oversteps*/*Move of Ten*~~

**Edit**: Scratch that last part. This newest track is giving me the Mo10 feels.
New thing coming at **1h 14m**
Well, I think you got your wish. Very little distortion here, but lots of clangy metallics and more of that dense reverb.
Alright, that beat switch was *definitely* some Exai trickery. I think this is how Autechre makes a greatest hits album.

This track got me closing my eyes and feeling like I'm in a large haunted/abandoned warehouse.
They make both types of music: Country *and* Western. ^^^/s
GAAAHT DAAAAAYM that sub
I only disagree because I don't feel like anyone else would put as much effort into the sonics of such a relatively simplistic track as æ do.
And here we go again. Something completely different.
This is actually a perfectly elegant description of the sound of this track. Good one.
We're passing the **1 hour** mark now, for those playing along at home.
Getting strong "Closer" (NIN) vibes from this drum pattern combined with the current snare sound.
Well this took a turn.
Something new is on the horizon at **54 minutes**
Jungle DnB v. A literal jungle
You're right, I'm doing this wrong. xD
I can't tell if the stream quality is just not good enough for this section, or if there's some wavefolding/bitcrush happening here. For something so ambient, this is a bit more grating than I'd expect from æ.
Yea, those noise washes definitely remind me of some kind of forest-ish ambience, and that sound occupying the mids reminds me of a hang pan drum.
Opposite for me. When this current thing started, it felt like something heavy was just dropped on top of me. Pretty sure my brain's wiring is out of whack, though.
For those complaining at all about any of this ever, get lost tbh
oman just wait till you hear the first 40 minutes. This is definitely a bit of a cooldown lap for all the people whose flesh was just melted off their faces.
The Flæming Lips
So far, ambient only in the most technical sense of the term. Giving the people what they want, but begrudgingly.
I can't believe they've done this
I'm not wrong. This is not clean enough nor nonsensical enough for sbubby. FFS, you can see cropping on the edges of the letters.
Thanks for making me realize I'd been hypnotized. I didn't even notice.
Personally, I hope the last hour of NTS4 has some "y7" or "M62" vibes.
True facts. These reverbs are super dense, but the level reacts so perfectly to the input signal it feels like a part of the original. These guys are masters of their tools.
I sympathize b/c I had to do this for the first two sessions and kept getting lost. :)
There's other things? I dunno man, I think you're mistaken.
For those trying to follow the comments when listening later, we're about 33 minutes in now. Make sure you sort by *New*.
This whole collection has been so fucking amazing so far that I'm starting to become legitimately worried that it'll be their last. I don't know how they'll ever manage to top it.
For almost 30 straight minutes now. My neck is gonna kill me tomorrow.
This one is definitely going to slapulate in the whippitron.
Fuck it. Send them a copy of NTS 3. If they're wavy, they'll thank you.
I think you're gonna have to revisit it at another time. I think sometimes it takes a while for Ae's new stuff to do its magic on your brainstuff if you're not in the right mental space for it.

IMO, this one just keeps getting better and better.
OH SHIT WHAT?
I really can't wait for this one in FLAC. I have a feeling it's gonna sound much more ridiculous in the sub-bass frequencies.
Then retreating again...
Yea, that first track could have lasted for an hour and I would've been perfectly okay with it.
Seems like you were onto something
It gets harder and harder to resist the vinyl box set every week.
They'll be on the autechre.bleepstore.com page for the release when the broadcast is over.
oh u
This beat is juicy as fuck.

**Edit:** I really hope this is one that stretches out to 20 minutes or so. I'm in love with this sound.
Word. Thanks!
HERE WE GO!
While I'm thinking about it, what exactly does "NTS" stand for?
Wrong sub
I’m actually awake and ready this time. So excited.

AptX Lossless over Bluetooth disagrees with you.
Shhhh. Don’t interrupt the sacred anti-Apple circlejerk.
For anyone who wants it, [here's another iteration with the foil color effect amplified](https://i.imgur.com/F8uNYiC.jpg).
Wait, have you not seen the tracklists posted at autechre.bleepstore.com or are you talking about something else?
>Over 21 days, we will have received eight hours of new music.

My current favorite musical acts (aside from Autechre) are Nine Inch Nails, Tool, Frank Ocean, and Thighpaulsandra. I can confirm that I'm definitely not used to eating this much.

Meanwhile, us Autechre fans are nearing hibernation levels of eating.

OP, I truly hope everything is good in your life right now, 'cause you've been gone from this thread for three days, but I *neeeeed* you to please kindly add this holographic effect to the [updated/more accurate vinyl cover.](https://i.imgur.com/ngWtzuW.jpg)

I've tried but every attempt just looks like garbage compared to this.
Thunderdome > geodesic domes > Superdome > Astrodome > Under the Dome
Your liberal usage of the word "liberal" is not nearly liberal enough for liberals.
Yes! I've always wanted a cleaner version of this cover.
Worth every penny. It's one of the best roguelikes I've ever played on a mobile platform (IMO).
What a splendid pi.
Hey bro. Not sure if you've read this anywhere yet, but there are already giant loudspeakers at the DMZ. Seems like not a lot of people are aware of that, but just in case nobody else has told you, now you know.   
^^^/s
I really need an acapella for "So Appalled" so I can mix it with "bladelores"
Perhaps the most underrated aspect of this release is the fact that they're putting it out in two-hour segments. It's *much* easier to digest each individual part of this over the course of a week before getting more, unlike when *elseq 1–5* just dropped all at once.
I bought their Game One headset to use for basic chat while playing simple co-op stuff like Minecraft with friends, and was actually extremely impressed with how well they handled music.

So impressed I bought another pair to use with my computer at work; our offices are all on softphones, so it's a quick switch between great sounding music and a phone conversation.

IMO, they outperform my Q701s.
>banning Catholics from Facebook for being pro-lifers is ok

It's not, though.

>not baking someone a gay wedding cake is a violation of their civil rights

It is, though.

>What do liberals mean by this?

What do you mean by this? 
I always internally pronounce that word as “propane o lol” and it’s always fun.

\>privately owned companies

but muh free market capitalism!!
>He held the press conference b/c that info would obviously have been disclosed by Repubs

Which is honestly the more important part of the equation here. If he decided *not* to notify Congress or hold a press conference and it later came to light that the investigation had been reopened, the GOP sycophants would have instantly accused him and the FBI at large of trying to hide it, and would have been foaming at the mouth for his removal.
>Scalpers take a ticket away from a fan

Then they sell them to a fan at a higher price. That's the whole point.

>there was no limit on vinyl so this guy really added more to the market. 

Eh. I kinda see your point on this, but...you can't exactly buy the vinyl from official outlets now, so there was *some* limit.

How are you connecting your monitors to your computer? If they're connected to a different audio device than your other speakers, it's likely related to the buffer size, sample rate, or bit depth settings in your DAW for that device.
>4.8

Was really thinking I missed some huge developments for a moment there. This is version **0.4.8**.
>I'm betting sales statistics don't include streaming services in their numbers

Again, you're making losing bets. Single and album sales figures (at least in the U.S.) have been [formulated with streaming numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Album-equivalent_unit) for many years now.

>Listening habits are overwhelmingly in the realm of portables as a majority so there's no way vinyl makes a dent in the overall market.

Read the second link I posted. Vinyl sales have generally been increasing year-over-year for over a decade. A quick and simple web search will yield many many articles about the resurgence in vinyl sales and production, even during periods where sales of other physical media were declining. Even if vinyl sales still technically make up a minority share of the market, they're certainly beyond niche at this point.
This is very well done. Combines the holographic effect and white background of the physical product with the original layout of the streaming cover very nicely.

The only thing missing is the "Frank Ocean" text under the title.

Edit: If you made this in Photoshop would you mind sharing the project file?
bad bot
But...you ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy?
On one hand: these guys are no better than ticket scalpers. Fuck 'em.

On the other hand, I wouldn't have a copy of Endless on the way if it weren't for someone buying extra to resell.

I can even understand wanting to make a little profit off of reselling to "the fans who missed out." You floated the money to stock up on something limited so that someone who couldn't afford one at the time could get one later. A few bucks on the top is totally fine by me. But don't lie to yourself and say you're looking out for anyone by selling it for 5-times the original price.
>Am I better off leaving my songs quiet when posting them online

You want your overall volume levels to be around the same as other material on the service, but you should not be sacrificing all of your dynamic range to that end. Indiscriminately brickwalling your entire mix with a single limiter on the master buss is certainly going to make your audio louder — whatever is left of it, anyways — but it will be fatiguing to listen to, and the type of distortions it causes are not musical or pleasing. To answer your question, it is *very* noticeable, even to people who aren't necessarily trained to hear bad compression/limiting.

If you have no plans to have your music professionally mastered, but just need to get the levels up a little without sacrificing too much quality, you may be better off using a free or cheap service like Landr than trying to do it on your own without fully understanding how the tools work. Please don't take that offensively; it's just very *very* easy to do more bad than good when you're trying to master a track (especially one of your own) if you don't have much experience doing it.

If you're really interested in the topic of mastering, I'd very strongly suggest checking out Ian Shepherd's podcast, "[The Mastering Show](http://themasteringshow.com/page/5/)." (Start from the beginning; the very first episode. The sequence of the first few episodes was intentional, and it's worth the time it takes to listen to all of them.) The topic itself is very technical and can be boring as hell if this sort of stuff isn't what you're into, but Shepherd is a professional mastering engineer, and he and his guests actually do quite a good job of explaining the concepts, provided that you have at least a tiny bit of prerequisite knowledge of how tools like compressors, limiters, meters, equalizers, etc. work or what they do.
But...it is still stupid.
Still super cute, tho.
There are certain words that aren't capitalized in titles, but it's a loose standard. Most words commonly excluded are "to, the, a, an, from, for, and, at, by, but, with, into, of" and etc., but not everyone agrees.

That isn't this, though. Whoever made this title is just not even trying.
> The vocals leave something to be desired

Oh geez, you weren't kidding.


LMAO at this moron posting that link to the old ETS "drama" as proof of anything.
Thanks for reminding me how much I need more Yeezy.
I posted it on Synths4Sale once and haven't gotten a single response, but I haven't tried posting it somewhere like Craigslist or Reverb yet. Just basing all this on what I've seen selling (and not selling) lately.
>Ah yes, the newest passive-aggressive phrase to hit the streets.

Damn these kids and their devil rock music and their hippity hoppity.
This is interesting coming from the guy who used to check in to literally every other place he went on Foursquare.
\>Yeah that right fuck immigration law.. Idiots.

Maynard himself also said Tool fanatics are insufferable retards, so there's that.
Way to miss the point.
+1 for FM8. One of the best things about it in comparison to something like Dexed is that you're not limited to predefined algorithms. The matrix editor is fucking nuts.
>I'm willing to bet the vast majority of people don't care about vinyl. I'm willing to bet the market is dominated by streaming, followed by digital sales, and then everything else (cd, tape, vinyl) is a tiny fraction of a percentage. 

Reality disagrees with you:

https://blog.discogs.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/State-of-Discogs-2017.pdf

>Sales in the Discogs Marketplace increased by 20.42% in 2017. Vinyl had thehighest sales numbers with 7,949,932, with an increase of 18.81% year-over-year. Both CDs (28.39%) and Cassettes (29.54%) saw double-digit percentage growth year-over-year.

**Edit:** Some more data for you to chew on

https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8085951/us-vinyl-album-sales-nielsen-music-record-high-2017

>2017 marks the 12th straight year of growth in vinyl album sales. The format continues to increase in sales as more new and classic albums are issued on vinyl, promotion from retailers like Amazon, Urban Outfitters and Barnes & Noble, as well as annual vinyl-oriented celebrations like Record Store Day.
Alternative to this approach which would be less difficult to keep track of on this sub:

After the submission deadline, we take a poll of all the presented material, and the best ones get included on the vinyl.

Once we know which tracks are included, we take a ranked choice poll where people make their own tracklist from the winning tracks, then use the data from that poll to determine where tracks showed up most often in the sequence, and order them that way.
This is actually a really great idea. I'd love to contribute.

**Edit:** I'd contribute even harder if we can get some kind of fancy color scheme going on the discs.
You'd be surprised at what's possible with Melodyne.

Edit to expand on this: With a copy of software like Melodyne, you can change not just the pitch, but the timing, pitch variation, and volume of every syllable. Actually, you're not even restricted by syllables; you can turn a single syllable sung at one pitch into a full run of multiple pitches, shorten the sound of inhales/exhales, make the pitch dive or rise at the end of a phrase...the possibilities are literally endless.

It takes time to do, but the results can be extremely convincing if you know what you're doing.

In conjunction with that, ask yourself this: why are these snippets we're hearing with vocals so short? but the other "leaked" audio that was posted with the vocals "removed" was the length of a full song? Why are the "leaks" with vocals mastered with ridiculous dynamic range compression which would mask deficiencies in the quality of the source material? Why did the guy disappear before actually leaking any full tracks with vocals?

If you suspect it's because re-pitching and polishing a bunch of vocals comped solely from publicly-available multitracks just to fake a new NIN EP leak for a bunch of skeptical people on Reddit would be way too much work for an Internet troll, you're probably onto something.

Edit 2: Not to mention the fact that this has happened every single time there have been rumors of new NIN material on this sub. Someone *always* uploads fake leaks, claiming to have some insider knowledge, then a few weeks later when the real thing is released, it's absolutely nothing like the purported leaks. Usually, it's some loser trying to pass off his own NIN-biting original music as official NIN material to draw more attention to himself.
CD-DA can contain some basic metadata via CD-TEXT (*i.e.*, artist name, album title, track title), but not artwork.

If any artwork is displayed when you put the disc into your computer and try to rip it with something like iTunes, the artwork is being downloaded from somewhere on the Internet based on the artist and title fields when the software tries to retrieve metadata for the album. If you have a CD version of an album that exists in the iTunes Store or on Apple Music and you retrieve the metadata for the disc automatically before ripping in iTunes, it'll usually just copy the tags from the store.
>But the m4a is 256kbps variable bitrate, (which as you may know is as high as a lossy audio format can be)

320 CBR (either AAC or LAME mp3) would be higher quality.
I want to hear someone spit bars over bladelores.
The "can you see it" line is literally lifted from the multitrack of "In This Twilight" and pitch-shifted.
The drums playing in the "leaks" are made with very stereotypical brostep kick and snare samples. Not that I'm saying TR/AR would never dabble, but those drums are just...not the NIN sound, especially not recently.
You right, tho.

I never saw that photo, and I found a couple of other versions of that article which specified Morello was with Tool in their rehearsal space when he heard the album (though it doesn't specify if they played the new material live or if he had listened to an instrumental demo, not that it really matters).


>you are aware 9/10 bands record music as a demo first right...

Yes, I do know about demos.
Yea, he's right and I'm out of the loop. I had read the story but never saw the photo. One outlet even reported he was with them in their rehearsal space.

Whoops.
How is Ænima better than Lateralus if they're both equally good?
>Did you not see the formatting you posted

You mean the part where I quoted your post?

>with my words smashed in to some bizarre wording.

You mean where I copied the message from my inbox — verbatim — and included your name so you couldn't delete it later and deny it happened?

I think one of your problems is you don't realize that not everyone is as stupid as you are.

**WTF#44327:** DID YOU KNOW that Miley Cyrus' 2013 album, *Bangerz* was unanimously voted the Best Musical Recording of All Time by a taxpayer-funded panel of experts called the Federal Music Preservation Administration? It narrowly beat out Tool's 1996 epic, *Ænima*, in the semifinal round, and was pitted against A Tribe Called Quest's *The Low End Theory*, which received no votes in the final round.

The comments he made implied he had heard a recording of the instrumental recordings. I guess it's possible to interpret that he had been in a rehearsal space with Tool-sans-MJK, but...idk, that just seems implausible.

>The chorus deals with the alienation you experience by having a battle raging in your head while you're supposed to just act normal and buy groceries and shit.

IMO, the song is more about coming to grips with the fact that the uniqueness you try to base your individuality upon is a myth ("I guess they've got a way of reading my mind/I guess I've got to adjust" ... "I'm not looking to stand up real high/I'd be happy to crawl").

It's about being a human in a society full of humans who all think they're the center of the universe ("I'm just a face in the crowd/Nothing to worry about/Don't even try to stand out").

It's about the struggle to understand that your angst and outrage doesn't make you special or immortal ("I have nothing to say/it's all been taken away/I just behave and obey/I'm afraid I am starting to fade away"), and the difficult process of accepting your flaws and your place in the world ("My world is getting smaller every day, and that's okay").
It sounds like generic brostep with re-pitched vocals on top, slammed into a brickwall limiter.

This is 100,000% fake. If it's not, I will eat my *Add Violence* patches.
These are fake as fuck.
I have a feeling /u/Meowtz8 has the correct answer.

Seriously, aren't your arms getting tired from all this pointless digging? Put down your fucking shovel.
Yea, that was debunked hard. Tom Morello was just talking out of his ass.

>I love how you're the third, not the first or the second but the third to repeat what the others have been trying to convey

It's because denying simple facts just because the semantics of language threatens your worldview makes you look like a fool; a person who acts unwisely or imprudently; a person who is easily duped.
Sonically, I think BP is much lighter than most of the stuff on NLDW or Jenny Death. Subject matter is a different discussion, I guess.
Should I even bother trying to sell my TR-8 (7x7) at this point? I don't use it much anymore because it doesn't really fit my workflow, but it seems like nobody cares about it now that the TR-8S has been released.

I understand it's not going to be worth nearly as much now, but I expected it would be worth more than nothing, and nobody seems to be interested in buying one. I was hoping to get at least $300 out of it, but now I'm starting to worry even that's too much.
So...you don't understand that there *are* differences between STIs and STDs, and yet your ignorance is still somehow the fault of "the left."

Pick only one
I certainly view it that way myself because I'm not on the same wavelength the TDR guys are operating on when they're designing this stuff, but I really think the patterns on the *elseq 1–5* artwork were intentional. They probably signify something, but I have no idea what. My only thoughts are that the sizes and locations of the squares and circles are probably a visual representation of some set of data related to/gathered from the music, but beyond that I've got nothing.
ok this gonks

**Edit:** I'm about halfway through my second listen. I think this one definitely gonks much harder than NTS1. Slightly less noodle\-y, and the sound feels warmer overall. The sequence from "six of eight \(midst\)" through "violvoic" has been fucking crazy. There's so much energy and depth in these tracks.

I feel like lots of NTS1 was minimalist and sparsely arranged, with a few moments where it feels like that unravels and shows an underlying "implied" intensity, but NTS2 has been a wide\-open\-throttle experience the entire way so far.

As much as I love *elseq 1–5*, the NTS Sessions are quickly revealing themselves as the album I really wanted elseq to be, and just this first half of the release legitimately contains some of æ's best work. Ever. Period.
The Paper Chase is legit af, and John Congleton is a master producer. Have you checked out his latest project, The Nighty Nite?

I used to think the same thing, then I was blessed with the opportunity to see them live on the NA tour in 2015. The place was far from packed \(Asheville\), but I was still surprised by the number of people in attendance, and it was the best crowd of any live music I've ever seen. Everyone I interacted with there was very chill and easy to talk to, even for someone like myself with crippling depression and anxiety.
These titles are so great. I think the AI known as Rob & Sean is becoming self\-aware.

Edit: Just noticed this, too. They're selling vinyl editions of these sessions individually/separate from the giant box set. That's pretty interesting.
Man’s not hot
Sorry, but not really. Couldn't help myself...
Those bird-like sounds are super convincing at times. Great work on this one.
>I know wav is far superior

It's not. WAV, ALAC, and FLAC are all lossless audio formats. The compression used in ALAC and FLAC have no affect on the audio, so rest assured you're not losing anything by using ALAC.

That said, you may want to check your converter's settings if you were transcoding from 24-Bit WAV to 16-Bit ALAC, as it's possible that the audio may not have been dithered properly. Aside from that, I can't imagine why you'd be having any issue with volume, and even then, it's a bit of a stretch.

For the record, the volume levels seem fine to me.
>I'm not really sure how you can listen to this first NTS Session and not hear throwbacks to stuff like LP5 or Confield.

It's because those people have short attention spans, and lots of the newer material has been 10+ minutes long.

I've got a good feeling that even if Autechre literally looped a track from LP5 for 20 minutes and gave it a different name, some people would still claim it didn't sound enough like LP5.
What kind of savage copies and pastes with a mouse?
If you're using it as a "traditional" drum machine (that is, generating relatively simple kick, snare, hat, etc. patterns), I think it really comes alive with a bit of tape or tube distortion to soften out the harsh edges it can have sometimes.
Not quite, but I've been playing my 0-coast and Little Phatty with the Launchpad Pro I got a couple weeks ago and can confirm that the note/scale mode is super fun to use with a hardware synth.
This really confused me, as "thermal runaway" is a common term for a condition that happens in batteries.

Glad your server isn't on fire, though!
Well for starters, Garage Band is a heavily stripped-down version of Logic, Apple's own DAW software for macOS. It's lacking in a lot of the functions that most DAWs provide, such as custom signal routing, deeper automation control, and more advanced editing techniques. For all intents and purposes, Garage Band can be thought of as a sort of "Logic Lite Edition". It's a good starting point if you've never worked with a DAW before, but most people will quickly outgrow it.
>Garage Band, that appears to be just as good as FL Studio or comparable DAWs

Eh...not really.
I'm getting really tired of these limited editions. I never even knew that Endless was actually getting a proper physical release, and now that a rip is available, I'm learning I already missed the fuckin' boat.
I'll definitely be giving that a try. Might be interesting to run the result through something like Beat Repeat and a transient shaper to get some weird percussive sounds.

Edit: Nevermind. That wasn't the part that changed.
Well look at Mr. Awesome over here. Getting invited places and going to parties and shit.
Like others are saying, it costs quite a bit of money to press, package, store, and ship a single vinyl LP. There's a lot more quality control involved than with preparing a CD package (and obviously much more than releasing digitally) as well. Physically speaking, it's also simply more mass; the discs are large and heavy, the sleeves are a little over 12", the box that holds it all is slightly larger and made of heavier material. The whole process is just expensive.

That said, it's honestly amazing that this set is priced the way it is. $140 for 12 LPs, even without the fancy packaging, is quite a bargain.
Thx for reminding me to spin Oversteps. It's been a while, and it's the only Ae vinyl I own.
Exai is 2 hours  
Elseq 1–5 is 4 hours  
NTS Sessions 1-4 is 8 hours  

So the next album is either gonna be 16 hours to keep the pattern going, or it's going to be ridiculously short.
I had this thought for a split second, then read that "ONE TIME PRESSING" thing and, very much remembering the limited edition of Quaristice, instantly bought it anyways.
Honestly, I don't know of any way to classify this other than an album. Ever since Exai, they've become about as much of a "jam band" as you could ever expect an IDM duo to be, and an 8-hour release of essentially new material, is about as close to an "album" of this type of sound as I think we're ever gonna get from them.

They're really into these long progressions with slow builds and small tweaks and changes throughout, so this type of release where they're free to explore that without caring about the overall length is perfect, IMO. I think we've just been spoiled with so much AE material in the past few years (relatively speaking) that we've forgotten what it was like to wait two years and only get an hour of new music.

Honestly, pre-Exai, a single track from AE_LIVE would have been a new album in its own right! Now we're getting 8 hours of material all at once!
~~Yea, as much as I'd enjoy having that massive 12xLP box, it's just completely impractical.~~ I'm gonna love the fuck out of that 8xCD box though.

Disregard that. I couldn't resist. Just bought the 12xLP because this is officially my favorite Autechre album.
Imagine that. The most popular tMG album wins the tMG album popularity contest. Who'da thought?!
So is this a straight transfer of the original reels, or has some post-production trickery been applied?

Only asking because I tend to not trust fan-made "remasters" to be any good.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!
>Haven't even listened to the first session yet lmao

You are about to seriously not regret this purchase. Like...so little regret. The first broadcast was awesome.
You won't be regretting it when that awesome package shows up, tho!

>Ok, then, by that definition assault rifles are already illegal, with the exception of ones that were privately owned before the ban in the 80's. In fact, since then not a single mass shooting has taken place [using an assault rifle by your definition](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/)

Are we moving the goalposts again? Now we're talking about legality. Looks like we're moving the goalposts again.

So since we're talking about mass shootings, I'm going to have to assume that you're concerned about the outcry against assault weapons, since many of the weapons used in mass shootings — including the ever-popular AR-15 — are [classified by many state and local governments as "assault weapons."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapons_legislation_in_the_United_States) This is *not* the same thing as an "assault rifle." They are two different terms which are used to classify weapons in two different ways.

Something of note when you're reading about assault weapons legislation: these classifications also rarely have anything to do with looks, but are more concerned with the maximum number of rounds supported by the magazine, the type of stock and/or grip, and other functional attachments or modifications. This taxonomy is used in conjunction with the naming of all fully-automatic rifles as "assault rifles" to further restrict some types of firearms in state or local jurisdictions.

The confusion likely stems from the fact that some people may incorrectly think the "AR" in "AR-15" is not a model number, but rather an abbreviation for "assault rifle," and an unmodified AR-15 is not prohibited by any current federal firearms legislation, including the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 (which specifically targeted "machineguns"). Nonetheless, what most modern-day gun control reform advocates are apparently interested in would be a ban on consumer ownership of "assault weapons."
>[Enlighten us then, what is the actual distintion between the two?](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/55/f2/dc/55f2dc36fb3045cd9f6bdd2673d7641d.png) The classification is meaningless when it comes to what the weapon is capable of.

Between the two what? An assault rifle and...not an assault rifle? Let's go with that.

For one, looks have nothing to do with it. An assault rifle is a lightweight machine gun that is designed and manufactured to fire in different ways, using a switching mechanism to change between firing a single round, a burst of some number of rounds, or in a fully automatic fashion when the trigger is pulled.

>Calling assault rifles more dangerous is almost as stupid as calling red cars faster.

Moving the goalpoasts is just as stupid. I did not say that assault rifles are more dangerous in my rant about the classification, but if you want to go there: a weapon that can fire more ammunition in some given period of time than another weapon is inherently more dangerous than the other weapon.
Most likely, you'll need to find the overscan setting in your TV's settings and turn it off. Not all TVs have this setting, though.
You could probably do this with a hair dryer (or a heat gun if you're really careful). Apply heat and bend the vinyl into shape.
No worries. The guy who recorded it said it was a reverb as well.
Imagine still defending the Vietnam war in 2018.
>assault rifles (yes I know it's a stupid umbrella term)

It's fucking not, and it is disingenuous for anyone advocating for "gun rights" to say so. An assault rifle is a specific type/classification of firearm, and anyone who claims to be informed about guns — *i.e.*, the majority of the gun nuts who claim to be arguing for gun rights from a point of some superior knowledge — should know that.

It's not some meaningless term made up by the media, as these people claim. The people perpetuating this ignorant drivel are simply trying to muddy the waters with disinformation, and judging solely by the recent increase in the number of people who believe it, it's working.
As much as I've always wanted to own a copy of this record, the format seems wrong. Having the song stop at the end of the first three sides must be very jarring.
I'm pretty sure that's a delay, not a reverb.
Who?
How are people so hilariously bad at rapping to a beat?
I'd really love it if people would stop giving this assclown a platform to spew his bitchassness.
Oh, right. Thank you! Not sure what I'm gonna do with this, but it's going into something.
YAAAS!
Very musical, actually. With a cleaner recording, this could be sampled in interesting ways.
It's gonna be hard to block something that doesn't exist, but I guess I'll have to see what happens.
Wow dude, you're so cool.
Don't cut yourself on that edge.
This happens all the time.

>wouldn't shut down properly afterwards like some Windows bitch machine.

Ouch. I cut myself on that edge.
I've learned quite a bit by listening to Thighpaulsandra. Not necessarily about synthesis, since most of his synth work is complete madness, but about creating spaces, transitions, and depth in music. I'll probably never be able to perfectly apply what I've learned from his material, but it has nudged me to try new things so many times I've lost count.
Monark is good. Scary good. When I first got it, I didn't turn on my Phatty for months because I was getting the Moog sounds I was usually looking for without having to warm up a piece of hardware. 

I've had Monark for about two years now, and it's still very impressive. I use the Phatty more these days when I don't know what kind of sound I'm looking for and need some inspiration, and I'll probably never replace the Phatty with Monark in a production once it's recorded or anything crazy like that, but I go to it far more often than I thought I would.
I used to talk myself out of buying software instruments and effects that I *really* liked because of this logic, that it'll eventually be unsupported and I won't be able to use it anymore because it's just too outdated.

Lately, I'm saying "fuck it" a lot more. If I come across a reasonably priced softsynth or plugin that I *actually* need (emphasis on actually), and it will help me make a sound that I'll enjoy right now, today, I'm gonna get it.

That said, it is important to do some research on what you're buying in the software realm just as much as when you're GASing over a shiny hardware synth. There are differences in what you need to be critical of — how long has the software been available? is the developer reputable? when was the most recent update? are people with my DAW complaining about some obscure compatibility issue with it? — but for the most part, the hunt and the trial and error process aren't much different.
+1 for Reaktor.

With Blocks, my Eurorack itch is mostly scratched. I miss out on the physical interaction of plugging the patch cables and turning real knobs, but the possibilities are just as limitless (as long as your computer is decent).
This weekend, I plan to tackle a subject that has caused me much pain, suffering, and grief over the years: background noise. Not eliminating it, but synthesizing it. I'm thinking of noisy pads, weird ambience, stuff like that, but not sampled.

I recently began to notice how much of my favorite music (mostly Industrial stuff) has something noisy happening quietly in the background to make the whole mix feel more dense. It's usually mixed so quietly that it's unnoticeable unless I'm listening for it, and often times it's something as simple as filtered tape hiss, but that sort of subtle density is often missing from my productions, and there must be a good way to synthesize it with the ridiculous amount of software at my disposal. I'm hoping to have a nice quiet weekend at work, so I'm packing my laptop, Launchpad, and a pair of good headphones, and zoning out at every available opportunity.

If anyone knows the sort of sound I'm talking about and has any tips on how to make interesting, subtle, likely unmusical noises, I'd greatly appreciate it.

**Edit:** One other quick thing. I've been eyeing the Grain Space plugin from Audiority pretty hard over the past few days. If anyone has any experience with it, how does it run for you? Is it good quality? A CPU hog? Worth the low price of entry?
If this material *is* the new album, I don't even know how to comprehend it. If they're planning to release this stuff in a traditional "album" sense, and the upcoming 3 shows are at all similar to this, it would almost make more sense for it to be four separate albums. But, at two hours each, that makes each of those four albums a double album.

If they just put the whole thing out as a "live" release similar to AE_LIVE, that's still new territory. Most of those recordings were right around 1 hour each, and all of the currently available tracks are (more or less) variations of the same set of tracks. Eight hours of totally new or remixed material is a hell of a lot to absorb.

I feel like most of the stuff we heard yesterday was *very* reminiscent of the elseq 1–5 and AE_LIVE sound, though; almost too much. Up until now, every new album has shown a definite shift in style, so I can't imagine that they'd be doing more of the same for another album two years later. Maybe this is the elseq 1–5 EP that we never got? It wouldn't be the first time they've released an EP that's much longer than the companion album.

Yea, that’s a bit much. Either way, you’re missing out on lots of great music, seemingly just to hold a contrarian and controversial opinion.
The only time this is acceptable is “A E S T H E T I C,” IMO.
I mean...your opinion is wrong, or at the very least, based on incomplete data. There have definitely been great albums released this year prior to today. Isolation might be your favorite — that’s a perfectly normal opinion to have — but saying you think it’s the first great album of the year, despite the fact that you haven’t listened to all the other great albums released this year, is ignorant. It just is.
But you said this is the “first great album of 2018.” That’s just not true.
Is this like...the only new album you’ve heard this year? You’re claiming it’s the “first great album of 2018” a few hours after its release, and just ignoring all the examples people are providing of why you’re wrong.

Either this album is about to blow my fucking mind, or you’re ignorant as fuck.
I managed to grab a copy of the mp3 directly from the website (i.e., no recording or transcoding on my end). If someone can recommend a good simple file hosting site for me to upload it to, I'd be happy to share.

**Edit:** Just checked the file and it is indeed 128kbps CBR mp3. ~~Not sure yet what encoder was used.~~

**Edit 2:** It looks like the file was encoded with iTunes' mp3 encoder. Not great, but whatever. This still beats having a rerecorded and lossy transcoded mp3 version.

Cheap frozen vegetables often contain lots of added sodium (among other things), which is *not* something you want in your veggies, considering how hard it can be to avoid sodium in so many other foods, as well as the low potassium and magnesium content in the average American diet. This is especially true for people who are at risk for heart or kidney diseases.

If you must buy frozen vegetables, your best bet is to look for "fresh frozen" products, which don't tend to have as much added sodium and other preservatives.

I finally bought myself a Launchpad Pro this weekend. Immediately updated the firmware for scale mode and jammed like I haven't in a very long time.

I feel like the workflow on this thing is really going to broaden my horizons.

In the past three weeks, I've also added a DFAM and BSP to my arsenal, as well as some Audio Damage software that has been on my list for a while (namely, Axon and Basic). I think now is the time to stop buying gear and actually make music. Wish me luck!

If you're going to be pedantic, House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence are *definitely* not mixtapes. They were albums released for free to skirt sample clearance issues, then rereleased in a compilation with the offending samples removed.

That said, the track list is disappointing; all the skits and intermission tracks are missing, so the flow of he album just feels wrong.
Hey, if both you and I do, there must be others. I'm also glad I'm not the only one who is really worried that CDs will vanish before I can legally purchase anything I want in a lossless digital format.
March has been a long, strange month for me, but I still managed to pick up some new vinyl for my collection along the way.

1. "**Jericho Sirens**" by **Hot Snakes** — Sadly, my first encounter with this band, but definitely not my last. I saw this on the shelf at a local record store and was intrigued by the cover (and the shiny packaging). I decided it to check it out once I got home, and I think I bought it sometime during my second listen. Inside is 30 unrelenting minutes of poppy, face-melting Punk/Post-Hardcore, and an almost comical amount of bass. The vinyl itself is a little noisy, but the recording is so loud it doesn't really bother me. Regardless of what the band says, I think this clear pressing looks way cooler than the limited black edition.

2. "**20 Jazz Funk Greats**" by **Throbbing Gristle** — This was a complete impulse buy. I've heard this album many times and never bothered to buy a copy, but the hype sticker said "green vinyl" and I'm easily amused.

3. "**Opiate**" by **Tool** — I feel as if I can never own enough of Tool's music (since there's far less than enough of it in existence), and this thing cost $10, so it was an instant buy. Sadly, it's the version with the hidden track at the end of the 2nd side — unlike other versions which place it in a hidden concurrent groove during the first track on side B — but it is apparently official, and it sounds great.

4. "**The College Dropout**" by **Kanye West** — Another instant purchase. I've got over 100 records in my collection now, but [no fuckin' Yeezy](https://youtu.be/fN-xq7t6pKw?t=148) was just inexplicable.

5. "**Bish Bosch**" by **Scott Walker** — I've wanted a vinyl copy of this album forever, but never bothered to buy it for whatever reason. To make a long story short, I was listening to this album almost non-stop for the first half of the month while going through a depressive episode and dealing with a lot of anxiety attacks, and despite what one might think, it really helped me to relax and keep my mind off my troubles in some strange way (maybe don't try this at home?). Regardless, it felt like a good time to finally add it to my collection.  
Sadly, it is also *very* warped. I unknowingly ordered a copy of the first pressing, which comes with a copy of the album on CD and – more relevantly – a booklet containing the album's lyrics. The thickness of the booklet, combined with the album sitting sealed on some shelf for several years, eventually led to both records being [hilariously bent out of shape](https://i.imgur.com/G7SwDpJ.gifv). Thankfully, both LPs track correctly throughout, and sound perfectly normal.

6. "**Run the Jewels 3**" by **Run the Jewels** — Yep.

7. "**Countach (for Giorgio)**" by **Shooter Jennings** — One of my favorite purchases this month. I don't even remember how I discovered this; I'm not a huge Shooter fan, I've never listened to a ton of Waylon's stuff either; maybe Amazon recommended it for some reason? Either way, what an interesting thing this is. Outlaw-Pop-Country-Disco-Alt-Funk-Rock or something. There's a straightforward Country track sandwiched between a funky cover of Elvis Presley's "I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone" and an instrumental track with a voice-over by game developer Richard Garriott [de Cayeux]. Side B closes with a beautiful cover of "The Neverending Story" sung by Brandi Carlile, and a damn good cover of Bowie's "Cat People" with vocals from Marilyn Manson. It's also pressed on an eye-catching transparent hot pink vinyl, which actually appears to be a neon orange color from certain angles.

I’m also shocked by the number of CD sales, but very happy about it. It’s still generally the cheapest [or only] way to buy lossless digital music from major label artists, and until that changes, CD needs to stick around.

Turns out people like owning a permanent copy of the music they enjoy.
I mean...he’s a fucking idiot, but he’s not wrong. You should absolutely ride more defensively knowing people like that are on the roads.
Just remember: the sample rate and bit depth of CDDA wasn’t blindly chosen at random. People put a lot of effort and research into determining those things.
This is easily my least favorite episode of NCIS. The plot isn’t even believable.
Probably because it’s two completely pointless comments rolled into one.

That, and intentional misspellings are played the fuck out.
Obligatory: The song "Old College Try" by The Mountain Goats (released in 2002) uses "trashcan fire" as a simile for a dismal, abusive, and codependent relationship. It's not far off from "dumpster fire."
Unless the TR-8S turns out to be a total flop for some strange reason, I doubt it'll happen anytime soon. Especially now that the TR-08 and TR-09 exist, the TR-8 is gonna have a very hard time attracting anyone who just really wants a modern hardware version of those old units.
I'm trying to get rid of mine at the moment, but have no interest in the TR-8S whatsoever. Looks like I should've been less lazy and tried to sell it months ago when I first realized I hadn't used it in forever.

I guess the worst case scenario is that I have an extra drum machine hanging around my workspace. Meh.

Perhaps.
I should have clarified. I was talking about the sarcastic comment above his.
This is just a classic fallacy employed by climate change deniers. It's important to remember that localized problems are not fixed immediately by widescale trends.

For instance: Just because the weather is cold outside your house, that does not mean the average global temperature isn't still increasing.

Likewise: Just because the absolute poorest parts of the globe are generally faring better (if only by some marginal amount), that does not mean that there aren't still localized wealth and income inequality problems that need to be addressed.
Oh fuck off. Context clues or not, "narc" is not commonly used to mean "narcissist," except apparently in some subreddits where people talk about narcissists. It's not beyond reason that someone might not know that.
I still think that's a far too lenient explanation of what he's saying, since he literally said this earlier:

>They don't need your passwords, they use their own.

The thing is...they *do* need your passwords. Whether you hand them over or not, there's not some master key that will let them in (unless, of course, there's a backdoor). If someone unlocks your data, they used *your* key.

I think you might be mistaking his conspiratorial rambling for a different argument which actually makes sense.
Just FYI, "narc" is generally a truncation of "narcotics" as in "narcotics officer," applied colloquially to mean "snitch." It is unrelated to narcissism.
hi every1 im new \*holds up spork\*
The problem isn't that the albums that have survived aren't good. All of the tMG albums are extremely good (with maybe one exception, which I won't mention). The problem is that people are predictably only voting to keep the four most popular tMG albums alive.

I'd almost guarantee that the winner will be *All Hail West Texas*. *The Sunset Tree* won't win because it's too obvious, and either *We Shall All Be Healed* or *Tallahassee* will go down in the final round because people will feel their indie cred e-penis get larger by saying they like one of the boombox albums better.

And again, those are all great albums. AHWT has some of my favorite tMG songs on it. But some people in this fanbase love to be contrarian in their opinions about the post-Sunset Tree albums. For some reason, being dismissive of everything from *Get Lonely* and onward is just the "cool" thing to do among elitist tMG fanboys.
Also, useless bots are in every fucking thread.

>You know the one.

Oh my god. He absolutely would. This is scary accurate.
Agreed on the Reface DX. I came really close to buying one multiple times, but then I'd get home and fire up FM8 and realize I'd be wasting money.
Just curious: what was it about the Sub37 you didn't like in comparison to the features of the Model D?
Bingo. Except for me, i actually liked the process of making tracks on the e2. The thing that kept me from using it was just how limited it is. By the time I had a decent idea developing into something resembling a song, I couldn't add anything more without running into voice stealing.
I init'd a patch on my Micron once. It took about an hour, IIRC. AMA

(don't actually ask me anything; I haven't turned on the Micron in ages)
Just a bit of a hint for the Micron:

http://ctrlr.org/  
http://ctrlr.org/akai-miniak-alesis-micron/

That software makes patch editing on the Micron much less infuriating. It can be a little fiddly until you get the hang of it, but it's totally worth the small amount of effort to get it connected and working correctly. It opens up the Micron so much, and proves there really is a monster of a VA synth behind that tiny LCD and single value entry knob.
From my experience watching videos of the Streichfett, it's a huge mix hog. As cool as it looks and as interesting as it sounds on its own, that cheesy string effect is only going to fit in exactly the type of music it was designed for, which is apparently cheesy 80's synthpop.
I've only had mine for a few days, so I'm probably still in the honeymoon phase, but I'm liking it so far. Granted, all it's doing is sending CV to my 0-Coast and DFAM for synchronization with Live, but it does that job very well. The layout of the sequencer is also making me use it in ways I wouldn't use my other keyboard-based controllers, so I've come up with several interesting melodies and ideas that I probably never would have otherwise.

The biggest letdown for me was that I mistook "Control Mode" to mean "Controller Mode," and expected it to be great for working with some of my softsynths. Then I realized it's not possible to shift octaves while playing notes with the pads in "Control Mode," and instantly felt a bit of buyer's remorse — that's not the primary reason I bought it, but I was really looking forward to being able to use this thing as a pad controller.

It's also completely ridiculous that when you set a key and mode/scale, the pads don't change in any way to reflect that; it's just chromatic all the time.

I think I'll be getting a Launchpad Pro and just leaving the BSP to its duties as a basic sequencer and MIDI-to-CV clock sending device.
Correct.
It's definitely not designed for "traditional" drum sounds, but it can play the role of a drum machine very well if you understand what it's doing. I've been using mine to generate kick and snare patterns, then adding sliced samples and granular synth patches to take the place of hats and crashes. It's really great as the foundation for glitchy percussion loops.
I definitely prefer this version to the album version, but I still think I like the 2013+ version better. They're both great for entirely different reasons, though.
This is almost always much easier said than done.

To be quite honest, the fact that *Zopilote Machine* and *Goths* have both been eliminated already is proof positive that nobody here knows what a "certified classic" actually is. People are primarily just voting down anything that isn't *The Sunset Tree*, *Tallahassee*, and *All Hail West Texas*, since those are the "correct" best tMG albums.
Exactly. It sounds forced because it is.
No. Deadass is slang for "dead serious." It sounds forced because it is.
P&S is just t_d for bootlickers. It's best to ignore them.
We already know [from recent reporting](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/26/facebook-russia-trump-sanders-stein-243172) that Russian trolls and bots were churning out pro-Bernie content on social media in the same way that they used those sites to rile up Trump supporters. I know several people who, like myself, were surprised to learn this, and had to seriously reexamine how they framed/perceived the outcome of the 2016 election and their feelings about it; looking back, it seems so obvious that this was happening, but it can be frustratingly easy to ignore the signs of something like this if you harbor even the slightest amount of cognitive bias (which most people on either side of any given issue are guilty of).

It's quite a few steps removed from direct financial support of his campaign, and a far cry from the consensual quid pro quo that Trump's campaign is/was suspected to be involved in, but we sadly cannot rule out the possibility that Russian money made its way into the Sanders campaign. If it did, and especially if Sanders knowingly accepted that money (which still I highly doubt), he should be subject to the same amount of scrutiny as Trump, and not a single ounce less.

It's really cool that this is being downvoted, btw.
I'd also be very interested in this. I have a feeling you could use a newer version of the Magic Keyboard with the power button in the upper right instead of the eject button, but I haven't confirmed that.
It’s the “Back to Black” pressing, which was not authorized by TR & co., but still official. It sounds good.

>Hip-Hop has a troubled past, so why bother holding its future to higher standards?
Fuck...I'm realizing I say that because I *have* had an experience with a Tool fan in "public."

I used to work with a guy who was obsessed with Tool (fine by me), but wouldn't shut up about how "intellectual" Tool's music was. It was just one annoying, unprovoked verbal essay after another about the Fibonacci sequence and Euclid and the golden ratio and "psychedelics are so awesome! lol I trip on drugs." He was also an insufferable conspiracy theorist who took every availed opportunity to spew his elitist, pseudo-intellectual bullshit in the direction of anyone who would listen.

I imagine that encountering anyone in public who could be easily identified as a fan of Tool would not be a dissimilar experience. I know this because I'm also a huge fan of NIN, I know exactly what *those people* are like anytime anyone mentions Trent Reznor, and there's a lot of overlap between the two fanbases.
"Political correctness" (nowadays, frequently used as shorthand for "liberal political correctness") is no longer anything more than a dog-whistle used by people harboring racist, sexist, or otherwise prejudiced viewpoints to complain about the fact that they cannot espouse those viewpoints without receiving criticism. It's a blanket insult used by the political right whenever they feel victimized by inclusive language and/or policy which might benefit minorities.

The term itself has a long and troubled past, and at one time was used more literally on both ends of the political spectrum to decry any perceived censorship of political ideas by the opposing party, but these days it is rarely used seriously by anyone on the left at all. The term's continued relevance is largely due to its use in right-leaning media as a pejorative term for liberal ideology.

More to the point: Nobody complains that something isn't politically correct. People complain (usually without provocation) about being unable to say outrageous or prejudiced things because they fear their statements will be labeled as "politically incorrect." The term is used to veil the desire to say something hateful beneath the fear of being called out for saying hateful things.
You're right. Maybe I should have said "prejudice" instead of using "bigotry" colloquially.

Exactly.

He/she is referring to the constant predictions (from people on *both* sides of the aisle) during the 2016 primary season that Hillary Clinton would be indicted for something at any moment. That never came to pass.

I disagree with the comparison — make no mistake; this is a completely different situation — but these sorts of "Trump will be indicted tomorrow!" comments do reek of the same stench that surrounds the constant "Obama and Hillary are going to prison this weekend!" bullshit that spews out of t_d and similar subreddits.
Close, but I'd describe it more as "intolerance to bigotry."

First of all, let me just say that I do not understand the amount of hatred this album tends to receive. I do get that both Sunn O))) and Scott Walker are very polarizing, but I was a bit shocked to find that so many fans of either half of this collaboration seemed to hate it so much. Regardless, this album is one of my personal favorites, primarily because I'm a huge fan of both Scott Walker *and* Sunn, and the simple fact that this album even exists makes me very happy.

Sunn's signature droning amplifier sound is the perfect backdrop for these few tracks, which at times feel like an extension of some of the darkest moments of *The Drift*. One of the most interesting parts of the "30 Century Man" documentary (IMO), is the bit where Brian Gascoigne talks about how Scott tended to want the orchestra play one single discordant cluster of tones for up to 16 bars at a time; with that in mind, Sunn O))) feels even more like a natural fit here. Beyond the compositions and lyrics though, it's just awesome to hear Scott's inimitable voice atop some of Sunn's heaviest drone riffs since the *GrimmRobe Demos* era, and with some of the synth and sound design techniques used in parts of *Bish Bosch* scattered throughout for accent.

As for the pressing itself, it sounds incredible to my ears. These songs are very dynamic, and this is some of the quietest vinyl in my collection. Though I'm not a huge snob about sound quality when it comes to vinyl, it feels more important on a record like this.

For the uninitiated and curious, ["Lullaby"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFi8_zO8DrA) is my favorite track from the album. The bit at the end of the first verse where Scott sings "In vain I bind another foot / in vain, and now the other foot" gives me goosebumps every single time I hear it.
It's okay. I can't fight either.

But still...AED is pure magic. The only way it could have been any better is if it included proper studio versions of "Catherine Antrim's Kid" and "Rotten Stinking Mouthpiece."
Well...there was [this thing that happened](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/09/ccleaner-malware-outbreak-is-much-worse-than-it-first-appeared/) not very long ago, but CCleaner is just generally a trash piece of software designed to solve problems that either a.) do not exist, or b.) should be fixed manually.

I've listened to my copy of Lateralus at least 10 times since I picked it up a few weeks ago, despite the fact that it sounds pretty bad. It's such a good album, and it's a different experience from just putting on the CD and zoning out.

Still really hoping for a non-picture disc version at some point, though.
This sounds like a limitation of the sound generator rather than your sequencer.

If you send two notes in succession to a monophonic synthesizer — that is, a synth with only one voice which can only play one note at a time — the first note will be stopped once the second note begins to play. An oscillator — or group of oscillators which make up a single voice on a monophonic synth — can only generate a single fundamental pitch at a time.
Just chiming in as someone else who also owns the HS8s: They're fantastic monitors; by far the best out of all the monitors I auditioned at a similar price point. Unless you're looking to spend a lot more money, you probably won't grow out of them for a long time.

Well, I guess it's time to replace Outlook on my smartphones.
Sadly, most consumers don't care about that. They just want to spend the least amount of money possible while getting the absolute best product available.
>Unfortunately they idolise the US in education, health care, business practices...

Holy shit. Those are like...the top three worst things about the US. Are Brexiters even watching the same ball game?
Oh my god. This physically hurts.
Not my favorite of theirs, but much better than I was expecting after hearing "Young and Menace" on The Tonight Show all that time ago. Even that song grew on me after hearing it in the context of the others on the album.

"Stay Frosty Royal Milk Tea" and "Heaven's Gate" are my favorites, but each of those songs has its own charm to it, even if they're a little...cheesy at times. I think I let FOB get away with a lot of stuff because of how amazing Patrick's voice is.
IMO, they're a lot better than most people give them credit for. They became extremely popular almost overnight when FUtCT was released so lots of people like to complain that they "sold out" and abandoned their Pop-Punk sound/Chicago roots/whateverthefuck, some folks complain that their lyrics are "whiny" or pretentious, or people just hate Pete Wentz for whatever reasons, but they really have made some great music.
Personally, my favorite is *Folie à Deux* because it covers the most musical territory and has some the most interesting production of all their albums. It's also by far their most ambitious, and didn't spawn a lot of popular singles.

If you're only familiar with FOB from hearing some of their singles, *From Under the Cork Tree* or *Infinity on High* would probably be the best place to start, but they're also very very good albums.

If you're into their more recent singles — which tend to be more poppy — I think their best post-hiatus album is *American Beauty/American Psycho*, but all three have some great songs.
>If no one cared, then there would not have been such widespread discussion

What widespread discussion? Hell, what discussion?

The vast majority of the "conversation" that I've witnessed both here and elsewhere is little-to-nothing more than people incessantly screeching about the supposed implications of the new Code of Conduct, and how annoyed they are with feminism or "leftist" ideology. There has been little to no discussion about the actual impact of the CoC on FreeBSD itself, beyond the fact that the CoC annoys people, or the fact that other people got annoyed with other projects when they tried similar things.

As far as I can tell, the only impact of the new CoC so far is all the complaining that's happened around it, usually wrought with slippery slope fallacies, or just totally off-topic rants about sexual and gender identity issues from people with no credentials proclaiming their expertise on the DSM-5.

It's one thing to make legitimate, merit-based arguments about the need — or lack thereof — to codify a position about these sorts of things into the project's Code of Conduct, but it's a totally different thing to have an onslaught of spam about how "identity politics" is ruining a project where these sorts of social issues should realistically never be relevant discussion anyhow, the presence of which all but inherently validates the need to address the problem with a Code of Conduct.
It's a slightly fancier version of PuTTY.
Let's not kid ourselves; it's all sad.
I love how they're making no effort to hide the fact that they're sync'd to the studio recording. The '80s were a magical time.
To be perfectly honest, I'm a die-hard fan of Fall Out Boy. There's quite a few artists/bands that I'm obsessed with, but I usually get a lot of shit for liking FOB.
>You know that you probably would have had the privilge to subsidize this dudes healthcare?

Is that a bad thing? I'd be more than happy about my tax dollars subsidizing some dude's healthcare if it means he's getting the help he needs, *especially* if it's for mental health issues. That shit is no joke.

**Edit:** Also:

>Lol liberalism is a mental disorder truly.

Wasn't expecting /r/AccidentalCommunism in the_dump.
Agreed. It feels like the most cohesive non-concept and non-boombox TMG album, but also manages to showcase a wide variety of JD's songwriting styles.
Yea, that 2nd one looks more like a cry for help than a legitimate attempt at robbery. Looks like he's going through some shit (and probably shouldn't have a gun).
Pointless comment.

Take my downvote.
Absolutely. It's hugely popular among NIN fans, but five years after TDS, radio was looking for another "Closer" and didn't get one. Sales started high, but didn't stay there for long.
Nothing wrong with that, IMO.
It's not gatekeeping if it's the truth. For all intents and purposes, the A+ certification is meaningless resume filler, and many other CompTIA certifications are experiencing a huge decline in reputation because of entry-level cert mills.

This is pretty much universally acknowledged by everyone other than the people currently studying for a CompTIA exam.
What the actual fuck is any of that? I legitimately felt like I was actively going insane while trying to read the comments there.

If any of that stuff is remotely serious, those people need professional help.

The best part is that they apparently *still* haven't figured out that the name /r/TopMindsOfReddit is sarcastic. It's like they think that TMoR posters are calling themselves the "top minds" or something.
I think all of us who really love music and are passionate about creating it have thought about this at some point; leaving behind a personal musical creation/expression in the hopes that it might live on long after we're gone. I know I personally have thought about it a lot, and it's one of the main driving forces behind my songwriting and production.

I'm sorry that you've received such terrible news, but as you've already seen, this sub is mostly a wonderful place full of helpful people, and we collectively should be able to help with whatever you're trying to figure out.

>I'm torn between making something fun and danceable, or something dark and more experimental

Personally, I most enjoy music that strikes a good balance between the two, but both are equally enjoyable when done well. Make whatever it is you feel you need to make, and know that someone somewhere is going to appreciate the sound.

As for gear, if you've got a decent computer, you're already halfway there. You'll need a Digital Audio Workstation of some kind, an audio interface for low-latency recording and playback, a good set of studio monitor speakers to work on, and probably a MIDI controller to help with getting your ideas into the computer.

[Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) is an excellent choice of DAW that's capable of great things; don't be fooled by the price. [Bitwig Studio](https://www.bitwig.com/en/home.html) is another good piece of software that has recently been gaining a lot of traction in the electronic music community because of its extensive modulation and automation capabilities. [Live](https://www.ableton.com/) is my personal favorite because I vibe with its workflow the best, but it may not be for you. Thankfully, all the popular DAWs have trial versions so you can try them all and get a sense of which one fits your needs best.

Looking for an audio interface can be daunting at first, but if you're not going to be hooking up expensive microphones and/or instruments that need high-quality pre-amplification, you can go a long way without spending a lot of money by getting an "entry level" interface with a smaller number of inputs and outputs. I've personally been looking at getting a [Scarlett 2i2](https://us.focusrite.com/usb-audio-interfaces/scarlett-2i2) or [Behringer U-Phoria UMC202HD](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/UMC202HD--behringer-u-phoria-umc202hd) to keep in my laptop bag for working on my tracks while away from home, but I used a similarly "entry-level" interface for years without needing to expand until I got more hardware and got too lazy to plug and unplug audio cables all the time.

Monitors are another difficult decision, especially if you plan to mix everything yourself, but they are arguably the most important thing you'll buy. Being able to hear your music clearly is going to have a huge impact on your ability to work efficiently and get consistently good results. You don't need to go too crazy in this department and buy state-of-the-art speakers, but this is the area where it pays to not cheap out. I'm using a pair of [Yamaha HS8s](http://www.guitarcenter.com/Yamaha/HS8-Powered-Studio-Monitor-Pair.gc) in my home studio, and I can hardly work without them. Of course, there are many other options in this price range; some larger, some smaller, some more expensive, some cheaper. I'd recommend you try to spend at least around $500 on monitors, but not above $1000 unless you've got an acoustically treated room to put them in. Monitors are a subjective beast though, and what works for me may not work for you. It's best to try to find a place you can listen to a few different kinds of monitors before deciding which ones to buy.

MIDI keyboards/controllers come in all shapes and sizes these days, and can be had for relatively cheap. Combined with the software instruments and effects that ship with most DAWs, and with the addition of some of the excellent free software synthesizers and effects out there, you can do practically anything inside your workstation without ever buying a single hardware synth. There are also some good free resources for learning the basics of synthesis that can be used in conjunction with softsynths to help you understand what to look for in a hardware synth if you ever do decide to purchase one (or more).

I had an extra-legal version of Synplant many years ago, and it was really fun. The ability to generate truly random patches made it very entertaining to play, and often led to lots of musical ideas I never would have thought to try otherwise.

Maybe it’s time I take it for another spin.
TN6 really is fantastic. It's actually pretty damn amazing that it's available for free, considering how good it sounds. The modulation possibilities are somewhat limited, but still fairly flexible; it can do everything from basic plucky bassline arps to totally unpredictable noisy chaos, and almost everything in between.
Either “13x0 step,” “Perlence range 7,” Surripere,” or “Cipater.”

This is a really tough choice.
I doubt it, but I seriously wish it was like...a KMS key or something.

This was just a random find from the used section of my local record store. It was in good shape, it was $5, and it's *Sports*, so I basically had to have it.
**Records pictured, from left to right:**  
Thighpaulsandra - *I, Thighpaulsandra* + *The Michel Publicity Window E.P.*  
Alt-J - *An Awesome Wave*  
Alt-J - *This Is All Yours*  
Huey Lewis and the News - *Sports*  
Mount Moriah - *How to Dance*  
Nine Inch Nails - *Add Violence*  

It's been a while since I added any new vinyl to my collection, but I recently started working on 1st shift for the first time in a few years, and the local record store is kinda sorta on my way home from work, so the bug bit me again.

All of these are favorites of mine that I've wanted in my collection for a while, but I'm most excited about the Thighpaulsandra album. It's not the cleanest sounding album I've ever purchased, but I bought it directly from the man himself, and it's pressed on beautiful semi-transparent "Moon's Milk White" vinyl. (R.I.P. Jhonn and Sleazy)

The others I just happened upon while browsing the shelves at the local indie record shop.

*Sports* was a used find that I grabbed for about $5, but it's in pretty great shape aside from a separated edge on the inner sleeve. Not sure which exact pressing this is, but I also don't care very much. It's a great album and it sounds good on my meager setup, so I'm pleased.

The two Alt-J albums (sadly, *Relaxer* wasn't in stock the day I bought these) really should have been in my collection sooner.

Same goes for *How to Dance*. If you aren't familiar with Mount Moriah, and you like "Alternative Country," but you aren't really too pleased with the groups the hype machine has been dredging up lately, give their albums a shot. Heather McEntire (ex-Bellafea) has a voice that reaches a part of my being that none other really does, and with her bandmate in Mount Moriah, Jenks Miller (Horseback, etc.), they create something approaching medicine for the soul in their music.

Nothing really needs to be said about *Add Violence*. It's excellent. Reznor can do no wrong. Atticus Ross is awesome. End of discussion.
We clearly have different definitions of "amazing."
It's genuinely confusing to me that anyone would go to such great lengths  to clone a $100 microphone, try to pass it off as the real thing, but also sell it as "used."
It's a little known fact because it's completely false. Urine is not sterile.
It's funny because "urine" sounds like "you're in." So clever.
This has been the perfect soundtrack to a lazy Saturday morning at work. Thanks for sharing.
Yep. I sold off a Machinedrum because I didn't get along with the workflow, despite it making some pretty great sounds.

I'm also about to sell my Minilogue for a similar reason. It can sound great, but I've had a tough time integrating it into my workflow, and I can get equally great sounds out of some of my poly softsynths which cost a fraction of the price and take up no physical space.
And the amount of time it takes for them to assemble one of these is probably much greater than folks here realize. It's a few people in a small room soldering modules by hand all day.

Yep. The recent uptick in anti-vaping articles has made me wish I bookmarked all those asterisk-laden studies from a few years ago, but this is exactly the type of dishonest methodology that makes informed vapers skeptical.

>We’re in a position of knowing that cheap products are poisonous but most of the premier branded products are just the cheap ones with branding added. 

In the e-cig market, QC and crafstmanship on "premier" devices tend to be *much* better, but even cheaper e-cigarettes can be high in quality. There are very very few popular mods or atomizers that are truly just cheap versions of more premium products with branding removed (though there are "clones," which is a whole separate topic of discussion).

The thing is, some people in this thread are confusing the issue and talking about two very different things. The materials used in manufacturing a "mod" (the power source for the atomizer) should have absolutely no effect on the makeup of the "vapor" that comes from the heating coil in the atomizer (*i.e.*, drippers, tanks, cartridges, pods, etc.). This is important because it's the mods that are most prominent in the so-called "premium" market and most ripe for modification or ripping-off by manufacturers in search of a cheaper product (again, not including clones; many atomizers are subject to cheap cloning by Chinese manufacturers, even the cheapest atomizers). While there are some premium tanks and drippers, they usually sell at higher prices because of intricate machining or high quality control costs, and not necessarily because they are made with less questionable materials.

There are also many different types of atomizers on the market, but they are mostly similar in the materials used to make the conducting wires which heat the liquid. Some are "rebuildable" and require the user to wrap, terminate, and wick their own coils; others use pre-built, disposable coil "heads," or some similarly replaceable part like pods or cartridges. The conducting wire used to make coils for e-cigs is pretty much standardized at this point, though; most folks use Kanthal A1 (iron, chromium, aluminum) or Stainless Steel 316L (chromium, nickel) when building their own coils  — titanium is another less common conductor — and those wires are also used in most pre-built disposable coils.

A properly wicked and saturated coil in an e-cigarette should never become red hot in practical use, but they do need to get quite hot to aerosolize the liquid. This is *definitely* something that warrants further study if there's even a slight possibility that the metals we're using are finding their way into our vapor in dangerous concentrations, but many of us e-cig users are skeptical of bombshell claims like the ones in this headline because vaping has been so heavily demonized in recent years, with these studies frequently conducted by people who have no idea what devices people are actually using or how they're properly used.
>He also included the name “Annie” in ‘The Becoming’ yet overzealous fans didn’t find out and harass that person.

Don't give them any ideas.

But I agree with you. It is 100% *not* Trent's fault that some of his fans are creepy busybodies with no situational awareness.
>If it looks stupid but it works, it ain't stupid

Still looks stupid, tho
Probably because of the potential for doxxing. The main takeaway that I got from reading the other Reddit threads and the ETS thread is this:

If the WP site itself isn't an extremely elaborate and well hidden part of a NIN-related ARG (highly unlikely), the inclusion of the extra "lyrics" in the packaging and digital files made it much easier to find the WP site. 

Despite the fact that there is almost no personal identifying information on the WP site, some members of the NIN fanbase have a tendency to be ... we'll say "rabid," to put it mildly. Whoever decided to include the more unique parts of the blog in those lyrics must have known it would eventually lead to someone finding the original site.

Therefore, including those extra "lyrics" was irresponsible because of the potential for some overzealous fans to try digging into it too far, creating connections where none exist, or maybe even discovering the WP author's identity and potentially harassing someone who has at least claimed to have a serious mental illness, possibly bringing unwanted negative attention/stress into that person's life.

I get the feeling that most folks aren't upset because they think Reznor has "ripped off" some random oddity from a dark corner of the Internet, but because we know that the Internet (and NIN fans, especially) tend to take some things too far.
Judging by the comments here, I'm guessing it's for the best that I never bothered to look up how much it would cost me to buy a Polysix.

I'll just stick to the Legacy Collection plugin version :(

I've heard a lot of boring — or just...bad (sorry folks) — stuff here, but there is occasionally some *very* interesting music here as well. I've actually bought a couple of the EPs and LPs folks have posted, and they were worth every penny.

I'd much rather hear disappointing music, and be very pleasantly surprised from time to time by something really good, than just see pictures of the same 10 synthesizers posted over and over and over and over ...
IMO, They Might Be Giants have been onto something for the past few years with the Instant Fan Club. Tons and tons of exclusive music and related errata for the diehards. I don't feel that the artwork surrounding each of their albums bears a lot of weight on the perception of the music in the same way that NIN does, but they've just been spewing awesome and weird songs, one after another, year after year for so long that it took me forever to actually listen to "everything."

Autechre also comes to mind, though their brand of this leaves a sour taste in some fans' mouths. The limited edition CD version of *Quaristice* is one of the absolute coolest packages I've ever seen, but it was waaaaay too limited, and the bonus disc — which many people agree is a better version of the proper album — was impossible to obtain legally in any other way. Regardless, the stuff that The Designers' Republic has created for their music always seems to fit it perfectly, and the minimalism lends itself to beautiful physical packages.

Sadly, I think most artists/bands are limited in what they can realistically afford to do on the physical side of things. I think those who do occasionally release a gorgeous physical product or tons of bonus material just aren't always in the financial position to make it a consistent part of their output, or they're being limited in some way by their label or distributor(s).

I also don't think that's a terrible thing, though. Sometimes it's best to let the music stand on its own and not put too much emphasis on what the physical product looks like, especially now that it'll spend most of its lifespan on someone's shelf, or won't even be bought in a physical format.

NIN squarely beats the competition there most of the time as well, though. When the only thing your listeners are getting is audio, it's more rewarding when the audio sounds fantastic, and the Nine Inch Nails logo has never been officially stamped onto anything that wasn't sonically impeccable (IMO), or — at the very least — extremely interesting.
Fuck.

It really hurts my soul to read "the Donald J. Trump Presidential Library"

Like...that's a thing that will happen.
Which is exactly why you’re doing such a good job of taking regular backups! :)
Because this isn't a shitty /r/surrealmemes post.

There are a lot of variables at play here.

If you're sending MIDI to an external device like a synthesizer or effects processor, then yes. Absolutely. Save a backup of your project so that you can return to the MIDI data and modify it if necessary, but get its output recorded and remove the MIDI tracks. It'll help to keep things organized, and you won't have to worry as much about latency or recalling presets, etc. while you're trying to concentrate on mixing.

If it's a software instrument or effect...maybe. It really depends on how CPU intensive it is. Also, if you know that the part is going to be problematic at some point during the mixing process, but haven't decided how to deal with it yet, it might be best to just leave it alone until the time comes to finalize it's spot in the mix. People are going to screech about how this is "fixing it in the mix" and how you should never ever ever do it, but sometimes that's just how it is.

Regardless, you should *always* be rendering audio of your external and software instruments at some point before you shelve or archive the project. Like others have mentioned, you never know what kind of problems you might run into in the future if you need to go back to the project and make changes. Plugins get uninstalled, license keys get lost, software gets abandoned and stops working on new OS or DAW versions, etc., but your audio files should always work just fine.

Also: gentle reminder that you should be rigorously and routinely backing up everything.
Without the sabotage by propaganda and foreign intervention.

We're *way* further down the list now. We passed "And if it is, that's not my fault" on Friday when his surrogates kept parroting the "unwitting" line from Mueller's recent indictment as if it proves that Trump is now somehow vindicated.

"And if it was, I didn't mean it" is the defense that his legal counsel will be using if he ends up in front of the Grand Jury.
To be quite honest, the absolute most compact and versatile setup would be a mid-tier laptop with a small external audio interface and MIDI controller. With a DAW and a handful of plugins, you could put a similarly-priced set of outboard gear to shame, and you'd probably still end up with a smaller physical footprint.

Of course, the workflow will be very different, but I'm thinking in terms of the amount of sonic versatility for the money.

Looks like you've already made your decision, and you've picked some *very* nice hardware, but...I figured I'd throw in my $0.02 for anyone else who comes along with a similar predicament, or so people can argue with me.
It depends on how much the plastic is punctured. If you make a small, pinhole incision in the plastic wrapping, it'll take forever to expand. If you stab it with a chef's knife, it springs into shape quickly.
Despite anecdotal evidence to the contrary on StackExchange, there *can* be problems in twisted-pair cables which are too short. The reason you'll probably never find a 100% standardized minimum stated anywhere has to do with the fact that many manufacturers make these cables differently; while they may meet the same specifications for their category, the physical properties can still differ.

Specifically, this has to do with the fact that there are twists in the pairs of conducting wires that make up the cable, and the fact that those pairs are themselves twisted around one another inside the sheathing. This is, of course, done to eliminate crosstalk and help mitigate small amounts of electromagnetic interference, but the length of cabling required for this benefit can vary with the number of twists in each pair over a given length.

If you're buying the cheapest of cheap CAT5e (for instance), there's a good possibility that the manufacturer only twisted the pairs inside the cable as little as possible to meet the specifications for classification; after all, it takes more copper to make 100 m. of cable with two conductors twisted together than it does to make a 100 m. cable with two perfectly straight conducting wires inside of it. Depending on the length, the amount of cable being produced, the amount paid for the copper, and the price of the end product, the bottom-line cost of extra twists per inch — which might ultimately be unnecessary if the manufacturer is just trying to meet the minimum requirements for classification — adds up quickly.

**Edit:** Additionally, the quality and amount of sheathing on the conducting wires inside of the cable can also differ dramatically from manufacturer to manufacturer. This also plays a role in the amount of crosstalk which is inherent in the cable, and the amount of twists in the wires required to counteract the effect.

This is why you'll see many people say that they've made 1" patches that result in no errors or discards, while others will say that their 6" patch cables are almost unusable; the quality of the cable used probably differs.

**Edit 2:** Another thing worth mentioning: The length of the untwisted conductors at the terminations on each end of the cable can also impact how well the cable functions. Even something as small as *where* on the cable you put a termination can have an effect on its reliability, since you may be disrupting the "natural" twist of the pairs inside the cable as you move them into place at the end for termination. As you can see, there are a lot of variables.

I honestly don't see what the issue is here. Just be nice to people.
Taking ownership of the dll and moving it would likely work, but it’s a huge hassle that will inevitably lead to laziness and missing out on important security updates.

IMO, the only people who should be doing this are the ones who didn’t have to have the process described to them in a Reddit comment. I really hate to sound so elitist about this, but we got to where we are — Windows relentlessly forcing updates on non-domain workstations — because people are disproportionately annoyed by installing updates, and most absolutely wouldn’t do it if they had a choice.

2. All accusations levied against Trump and/or anyone on his staff and/or any of his appointments are lies made up by liberal Democrats and the Fake News Media who are buttmad that they lost the 2016 election because they hate America.

3. "I'm not racist, but brown immigrants are ruining this country."

Do not do what this commenter is telling you to do if recovering this data is important to you. Until you know the precise nature of the failure, anything you do with that disk puts your data at risk.

It's extremely important that anything you use to try to recover your data *does not perform write operations*. Do not rely on your computer's OS tools to resolve this problem. There are many utilities available that can recover data that is lost in the event of a software failure/error, but I'd caution that you shouldn't be using them if you don't already know how to.

If anything on that disk is important to you, keep it disconnected from your computer and find someplace locally that specializes in data recovery.
SSDs are more reliable in the sense that there are no moving parts which can be physically damaged during normal use — *e.g.*, you accidentally drop a traditional HDD that is in use, the heads crash into the platters, and you destroy the drive. (obligatory: Yes. I know about the mitigations that some manufacturers have baked in like drop sensors, *et. al.*)

If an HDD just decides to stop working, it may be possible to recover the data by removing the platters and placing them into a functioning drive; the data is still physically accessible because it is stored on the platters using magnetism. As long as you don't absolutely wreck the surface of the platters or expose them to a very strong magnet, the contents are recoverable. Whether or not the data recovered is actually useful is another topic, but assuming your disk was performing correctly prior to a sudden physical failure and then was immediately powered off and taken to a professional for recovery, it's a fairly straightforward process that tends to yield good results.

SSDs, on the other hand, store your data in non-volatile flash memory. There's no\* component of the drive that can be removed and physically examined for its contents in the event of a failure. At the moment, the jury is still out on whether or not there is any way to reliably recover data from a failed SSD; if there is, it would likely be even more cost prohibitive than HDD recovery. (Actual, real HDD recovery performed by a skilled technician; not some shot-in-the-dark freeware you downloaded to try to restore that one file you deleted 5 minutes ago).


\* — caveat: There are, of course, physical changes happening in your SSD as you use it to store data. Electricity is a physical phenomenon. However, at the moment, it's a risky and expensive process to remove the chips which store data in your SSD and transplant them to a working device for recovering lost data. It's much cheaper (and just plain smarter) to have backups.

I'm not conceding that you're correct about ellipses. I'm on the prescriptivist bandwagon most of the time, but you're arguing against a widely-adopted usage that has been around for much longer than modern annoyances like "literally" meaning "figuratively."

You can write using so-called "real words" all you want, but sounds like "uh" and "hmm" do convey a more conversational tone in casual writing, whether you like it or not.

>Want freedom of music? Buy or illegally download it, and create your own library.

It works pretty well for that, so why not use it?

Oh, right. Then you wouldn't get to show off your superior vocabulary or whatever.
It really depends on what parts of those releases you liked most. Every NIN album has a different sound and approach.

If you're after the more aggressive and noisy stuff, you should start with *The Downward Spiral* and *Broken*.

If you're more into the melodic stuff or the more "traditional" electronic music elements, I'd say start with *Hesitation Marks* or *Pretty Hate Machine*.

If you want more of a straightforward Rock album, *With Teeth* and *The Slip* are the way to go.

Whatever you do, I'd suggest saving *The Fragile* for last. It's dense, it's long, and it's amazing. I didn't fully appreciate it until I'd already gone through various stages of obsession with the other NIN albums.
>Put a play button on the album cover and they start screaming.

This reminds me of the old Beats Music "Now Playing" screen, where the album artwork was ≈66% covered by that giant circular seekbar and play/pause button. Do not miss.
XLD/sbooth's Tag/Fidelia step to me son.
I took it one step further. I'd look up the full release date for albums (as in YYYYMMDD), and add it to the beginning of the "Sort Album" field in iTunes so that my entire library was sorted chronologically when sorting by Album.

I didn't have many friends, but they all wanted me to download music for them :D
Same here. I spent a lot of time in my teens discovering music by downloading full discographies and organizing them while checking out new music. Then I got a real job and decided to build a CD and vinyl collection.

I also have depression, coupled with random panic attacks. I still enjoy discovering music and maintaining my music library in some of my spare time, though. It's relaxing to me.
This looks interesting. It's a shame that it relies on YouTube, though; I can't imagine the audio quality is very good.
Which is a fairly big oversight by the streaming platforms, IMO. Poorly tagged content breaks any cohesion attempted by the service's interface, and cheapens the look & feel of their product (at best). It also doesn't help when bands/labels decide to stylize their songs or albums by substituting homoglyphs, adding unnecessary whitespace characters, or putting things in ALL CAPS BECAUSE CRUISE CONTROL MAKES MORE PEOPLE LISTEN TO YOUR STUFF.

Thankfully, at least the services I've tried (Apple Music, GPM, Spotify, Tidal) all have search functionality that is capable of returning something like "Ke$ha" when searching for "kesha," etc., but it still makes the end user's library views look awful.
You're not wrong, but the entire point of a streaming service is to be able to listen to music I don't already own. I personally used one to audition albums I was interested in hearing but not committed to buying yet.

If I have to go out of my way to fill gaps in their catalog, I'll just maintain my own media server.
That makes sense. Hadn't thought about time zones.
I still use iTunes (have iPhone; no choice), but most players do that. All the text in the sort field has to match, or the software considers it to be a different thing (as it should, IMO).

This is partly why having a library on a streaming service is so annoying, though. You add one song featuring multiple artists to a playlist, and suddenly there's a separate entry in your artists view. It's especially frustrating on Apple Music, since iTunes makes it pretty easy to organize compilations or albums containing tracks by multiple musicians, but they sometimes fail to adhere to their own standard for things in their own streaming library.

Or worse, you add "Aqualung (40th Anniversary Edition) (Steven Wilson Stereo Remix) (2014 Remaster)" by "Jethro Tull" to your library, then add "Thick as a Brick (Special Collector\`s Edition) (2011 Remaster) (Remixed by Steven Wilson)" by "Jethro Tull - Remixed by Steven Wilson" to your library, and now you have two separate artists in the Artists view just because someone couldn't simplify their tags.
Nope. Not even AKG why.

Hell, if they gave me access, I'd fix tags and metadata for free. There's nothing worse than looking up an album and seeing information in the wrong fields, or "SONG TITLES THAT LOOK LIKE THIS" for no reason, or poorly scanned cover artwork that was literally just the first 300x300 image they could find with a Google Image search.

**Edit:** I liked Apple Music better than Spotify. There is some very basic playback functionality that Spotify gets completely wrong:

If I tap the play button on an album, I want to play that album, and only that album, once, and then I want playback to stop; I do not want the album's tracklist repeated 3.6 times in my queue, and I do not want another album by the same artist or another album with a similar name added to my queue.

If I search for a song, find what I'm looking for, and tap the play button on that song, that song should play, and then playback should stop. The entire search results list should not be added to my playback queue.
Not Shure why either, but I'm also not Neumann why, or Røde why.
I want Tidal's lossless and gapless streaming combined with Apple Music's interface, Google's playlist management, and Spotify's library, but with a local tag editor for organizing your personal library.

It'll never happen, but that's what I want.
The disparity between the content on all the major services is a major part of why I stopped subscribing altogether, especially when it comes to non-US musicians and/or small labels. I run my own media server now and just acquire the music I'm interested in from other avenues. I always end up buying a CD or FLAC copy of the things I like anyways, so it was hard to justify the cost of the subscription.
Aside from the fact that the app *still* doesn't display album artwork without cropping it on the Now Playing screen, their library was lacking a lot of stuff I was interested in when I first tried it. Admittedly, that's been a few years, but I still dislike the app's interface.
It's not too late. John Oliver just needs better writers.
Interesting. My experience was the complete opposite of yours, though my use case is probably different, too.

I had Apple Music prior to switching to an iPhone and loved the fact that my AM library was essentially contained within its own app and separate from my local storage. I have a large music library that is tagged and organized perfectly, and Apple Music's library is...well...not. When I switched to iOS, I unsubscribed from AM after about a month because I got tired of having it all blended together in the Music app.

Feature-wise, I never encountered anything missing from the Android version, but I also don't use playlists or radio. The search worked well enough, the interface wasn't cluttered, and albums always played and downloaded correctly for me, so I was happy with it.

This is funny because Apple Music took much less time to arrive on Android after the Beats buyout, and worked a million times better than Spotify.
Spotify's free users don't technically pay anything, and they're spread across all their platforms.
It's 2018, and all major music streaming platforms still do a shit job of organizing and tagging their content.

**Edit:** This thread...I've found my people.
Okay. So not to discount your experience, but this is pretty common practice in these suits.

The owner of some copyright/IP pays a firm to 1) find a torrent for distributing their content and scrape the peerlist, or 2) create a honeypot torrent and monitor the peers who connect for a while. That firm then contacts ISPs to discover the owners of the network addresses scraped from the peerlist, and provides the information to the client's legal team.

Because of the way the information is obtained, and the nature of the information used to request a person's identity from the ISP, it may be possible to discredit it in legal proceedings if the defendant(s) retain experienced representation and really want to put up a fight — *i.e.*, spoofing an IP address is a trivial process, making it difficult to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the IP address scraped from a peerlist actually belonged to the person whose information was provided by the ISP.

The plaintiff(s) in such cases typically don't actually intend to prove the defendant(s) guilty in a court of law, because doing so could involve a drawn-out proceeding they may ultimately lose. Instead, they sue a few dozen individuals, and try to settle out-of-court with as many of them as possible for the most money they can get away with; it makes for a nice payday if your content isn't generating the revenue you were expecting. Oftentimes, if it looks like the defendant isn't playing ball, they'll drop the suit.

Maybe none of this is news to you, but you should look up "copyright trolling" and "patent trolling" if it is. It's an interesting practice to read about, and there's a lot of well-documented cases of this exact thing happening.
I really don't want this name to stick. The Watergate scandal was named after the Watergate Hotel, which was actually a part of the events described by the term "the Watergate scandal." While there are certainly similarities between the two, this thing has nothing to do with the Watergate complex (that we know of).

If we're going with the standard set by Watergate, this should be referred to as something like "the Moscow Ritz-Carlton scandal."
Just curious: Did you settle with the plaintiff(s) out of court?
Shit, forget the customization. The ability to edit your collection's metadata without modifying the original files is huge.

If I could find a streaming music platform that even came close to the level of organization and uniformity in my Plex library, I'd sign up instantly.

I'm just saying that I can understand when folks say they are frustrated by the other networks as well.

You're right, though. CNN/MSNBC and FNC are frustrating for totally different reasons, and only one of the three is pushing literal propaganda and trying to masquerade it as absolute truth. CNN/MSNBC's commentary is sometimes annoying because of their thinly-veiled liberal bias, but Fox is a rage-inducing shitshow of deliberate deception.
>Seriously, tho, out of my face with this "both sides are the same" shit.

It's like...you didn't even read it.
>The only difference is that MSM is actually "news", and Fox is "entertainment".

Let's be fair, though.

There *are* non-FNC entities in the mainstream media that are just as prone to hyperbole and exaggerated freakouts as Fox. Even as a very liberal person, I find it just as hard to watch MSNBC or CNN on some days. They might be operating on more factual information than FNC, but their spin can be just as dizzying — depending on the topic — and their opinion show hosts love jumping to outrageous conclusions or using fallacies to characterize the opposition just as much as the FNC primetime lineup (though they do tend to be more subtle about it, most of the time).

Not to mention the fact that all of the cable news networks have some issues with the variety of the topics they cover, and the amount of time they give to headlines which paint the network's side of the aisle in a negative light. FNC might be the most egregious offender, but none of the cable networks are perfect.

All this is not to say, "They're all the same!" or any such nonsense, because there are some mainstream news outlets that do good work. Though, as far as cable news goes, the choices aren't really all that great.
/r/weaponizedconsumers was off to a promising start, but it quickly turned into full-blown stupidity.

I think the mods over there are trying to reboot the project, though. Might be worth following just in case it becomes something useful, but don't put all your eggs in one basket.

**Edit:** If you really want to contribute to "the effort," remember to not let perfect be the enemy of good. Watch FNC for a few hours and see who's advertising, then don't buy their products or services, and tell your friends to do the same and why you're doing it.

...and yes, you should contact the businesses you're boycotting and tell them you're doing so because of their support of FNC. It might feel like you're shouting into the void, but they need to know why they're being boycotted if they're to be expected to do anything about it.

I went down a rabbit-hole. Elsewhere on the net, people were suggesting that the chipset on the card I'm using was incompatible with Linux; that turned out to not be the case.

The card just simply didn't function without that additional power connection. Once I had the cable, it was plug and play on 16.04 LTS
>If the room isn’t treated (which it doesn’t look like is) will it really make that much difference?

At the "budget" level, it absolutely does.

Obviously, having a properly treated listening environment and positioning your monitors correctly would have a *huge* impact on their performance — and, by extension, their usefulness as tools for mixing — but the Rockits are notorious as some of the most colorful monitors in their price range.

While there aren't really any monitors around their cost that are anywhere near perfectly flat, they're just a particularly bad example of exaggerated and unrealistic frequency response.

Is there actually any precedent for this?

I agree. They do sound close, but there are just so many ways to generate sounds that it's nearly impossible to know for sure how they got it (unless S&R just came out and said it). Maybe it was that sample, maybe it's two or three separate snare sounds layered and sculpted in a way that sounds similar, maybe it was the product of a chaotic granular patch, maybe it was a happy accident in Max or Reaktor.

I was just saying that sometimes resemblances like these are purely coincidental, but sometimes they're not.
This is the worst reddit meme.
Not on the Push (since I don't own one (yet)), but I noticed the waxy coating he's talking about on my electribe2 and both of my MIDI controllers' pads when I first bought them.

I'm not sure that rubbing that stuff off really made any difference in their responsiveness, but I definitely noticed a difference in the texture after getting rid of it; more like a stiff rubber than a soft plastic.
I have the E2, but don't really use it much anymore (or can't rather, but I'll get there).

I used to work in a place where I wasn't allowed to bring bring any personal computing device apart from my smartphone into the building. Specifically, iPads and laptops were strictly forbidden because of information security guidelines. I had a *ton* of downtime though, and really wanted something I could use to make music in my spare time. I bought the e2 (non-sampler) and used it for a few weeks with varying levels of success. I rely heavily on effects to process and mangle my synth sounds, so it was difficult to work with the limited effects available in the e2, but I found it to be pretty useful for quickly recording melodies or drum patterns and other ideas that I could revisit once I was at home with all my gear.

Sadly, my fascination with it didn't last long. I didn't get along well with the menus, the relatively limited polyphony made it difficult to use the synth engines on more than a couple of tracks at a time, and even when trying to rein in my expectations, the built-in effects left a lot to be desired.

I ended up forgetting about it for months, eventually boxing it back up and putting it away once I got a new job where I could bring my laptop and work in a DAW when I had some downtime (and also had much less downtime). I tried "dusting it off" a few months ago and giving it another try, but the filter cutoff frequency knob has stopped tracking correctly, and the encoder knob for the menus is very erratic as well. I could probably fix these problems, but just felt it wasn't worth the hassle.

I'm honestly looking to sell mine to someone who could put it to better use. It looks like new, but I hate the idea of selling it in its current state.
That's good to hear. I'm about to buy myself a copy; after listening three times, I feel like I owe you guys the measly $4. This is way good.

Just finished listening to the first two tracks and this sounds great. Not at all what I was expecting, but this is really good stuff!

Edit: Currently on my 2nd play. Feeling a lot of good Porcupine Tree vibes off of this, with the occasional hint of Tool. Would recommend.
+1 shameless plug for Moog's customer support.

I'm a total novice with soldering. Needed a pot replaced on my Phatty, and I used it as an excuse to go visit the factory. Took it in for repair one day, picked it up after a tour the next afternoon, and the guy who handed it off to me told me exactly what part was replaced and how to fix it myself if it happens again. It wasn't a huge deal because I pretty much knew how to do the repair, and I just didn't want to risk messing something up, but I thought it was pretty cool that they were willing to take the time to explain stuff like that to me.

Their staff was super friendly and laid back all-around, and had no problems answering questions I had about their products (the released ones, anyways). I can't wait to go back this year and pick up a DFAM.
Reading classified information into the public Congressional record? That's...a terrible idea. It's like 500 steps further than a handful of classified messages on a personal mail server. Anyone who *actually* gives a shit about information security would crucify the person(s) who does anything resembling that.
Good luck explaining that to Trump supporters.
People have long discussed how the U.S. government is for sale, I just always figured it'd be worth more than $1.4T
There are probably a million different ways to create that sound. Maybe not so much "likely the source" as "one possibility."
No. Both work fine in most circumstances. Anyone who freaks out about this is literally making a big deal about nothing to make themselves feel superior.

You don't remember correctly. There are ways you can change the power button on the Start Menu to "hibernate" instead of "shut down," but the text changes as well. You could also change the action when your computer's power button is pressed from shut down to hibernate. An OEM may have even done this when they configured whatever computer you're on.

That said, shut down has always been shut down.

Maybe I don't know enough people who listen to shit like this, but I don't know a single person who legitimately likes "Gucci Gang." It's got generic production, awful vocal delivery, and an annoying amount of repetition. It's frequently posted elsewhere as an example of how shitty modern music is.

Remember when Rebecca Black's "Friday" was making the rounds on social media? Remember the level of shit that was talked about that track? "Gucci Gang" is almost there, tbh.
Eliminate the cardboard and blister pack. The small plastic container *is* the smaller package, but it's tiny, and its shape doesn't really lend itself to stacking, so finding a way to display them without them falling everywhere and getting knocked under the shelves would be a pain in the ass.

If anything, they need to make that plastic container slightly bigger and more flat, but then they're using more plastic.

Honestly, the whole product is wasteful.

Most people only know "Gucci Gang" (and by extension, Lil Pump) because of how bad it is. It's the only reason anybody outside of Soundcloud and /r/hhh talks about him at all. The song itself is a meme, and it birthed tons of stupid videos and image macros. I think that's pretty much the definition of meme rap.

Most of us just want a place to fucking live and aren't interested in gaming the real estate market. Housing and rent prices in Raleigh and the surrounding areas are already on the way to completely out of control. I hope Amazon stays far away.
Absolutely. Like I mentioned in my rambling comment elsewhere ITT, I'm 100% positive my GAS is directly driven by writer's block. It's so easy to see a new piece of gear in someone else's hands and think that it'll get me over whatever problem I'm having, but it almost never does.

Out of all the stuff I own, the first synth I bought with my own money (the Phatty) has seen the most use and contributed to the most completed tracks. Every piece of hardware I bought afterwards has been nice, fun to play with, and maybe even contributed to those finished tracks on a few occasions, but it's all been ancillary.

Hell, I was once stuck at my grandmother's house one week with nothing but a laptop — no controller or audio interface or anything, just a keyboard and a mouse (and a DAW, of course) — and I ended up making a track that is still one of my favorites to this day. I've been thinking about that a lot lately, and I'm starting to realize that I should just spend more time having fun with the stuff I've already got instead of constantly looking for new gear to solve my problems.
> Separate sound design from composition:  
> Spend some evenings just making presets.  
> Then spend some time later on, when you have an idea, writing songs with the presets and samples you made. 

I did this by accident a few weeks ago. I would start up my DAW, open a few softsynths, and experiment in ways that I never would when "writing a song," just trying to broaden my horizons and learn my tools better. But I'd save whatever I had done every night, expecting that I'd go back to it later because I was telling myself mentally, "I'm writing a song."

Then one day, I made a drum loop that I really liked and thought, "I bet that weird sound I made in Serum the other night would go really nicely with this." And that's how I made my first almost-complete track in months.
My beloved Moog hasn't even been powered on in months, and it breaks my heart a little every time I break out the detailing brushes to dust it off. In fact, the only hardware I own that *has* been used recently is my 0-Coast, because it's just so much fun to play around with (not that many songs are being written, but whatever). My near-mint Minilogue hasn't been used in forever, and I'm considering parting ways with everything but the Phatty and the 0-Coast because it's just become clutter.

My problem is that I have Live Suite, Komplete Ultimate, and a handful of other one-off purchases, and I can never figure out what the hell to do with all of it.

I hardly ever watch gear reviews because nothing affordable is all that impressive to me anymore. I can get a damn-near infinite variety of great sounds from the stuff in my laptop, and that's not even counting Reaktor, which is a whole other time suck of madness. Nowadays, I watch a review for a new piece of hardware and think, "Yea, that would be awesome to own, but all of the stuff I *already* own is awesome, and I haven't finished a single track in months."

Then my depression goes into overdrive, I sit down and try to work on something, but just end up hating everything I try. That, or I end up with an awesome loop that has potential, but never goes anywhere because I'm afraid to ruin it.

That said, apart from keeping up with NAMM because there's always something cool going on there, Live and Komplete paired with a decent keyboard controller made me all but totally uninterested in watching reviews and lusting over gear all the time. There was a short period of time where I thought I wanted to build a small Eurorack, but then I saw the amount of money I'd be spending and quickly realized it probably isn't worth it (Reaktor Blocks and the Model 15 app do a pretty decent job of scratching that itch these days).

As for "simply making music," I still haven't found the cure for that yet. Just about every night, I sit down at the keyboard and make a bunch of fun sounds, but I rarely end up with anything resembling a "song." Now that I've been dealing with it for a while, I think it's just plain, old-fashioned writer's block, and my recently-waning GAS was likely just a symptom. Without fail, I'd watch a review for some interesting new piece of gear, convince myself that *that's* what's gonna get me back to writing songs again because it'll be a fresh workflow and a new approach with new sounds will just magically fix everything, buy the thing, make one decent production with it, then fall back into my old habits.

If you or anyone else has any ideas on how to get out of this rut, I'm all ears. Otherwise, just know that I feel your pain.

People were predicting the end of Apple when they started removing FDDs from their desktop computers. There was never any real danger of Apple going under because their new computers needed external floppy readers, but people acted like the world was coming to an end.

Obviously, removing the 1/8" TRRS jack from the iPhone really doesn't make any sense, but people have this preconception that Apple hates their users and doesn't understand technology, so they ascribe any move Apple makes that they don't agree with to this supposed "pattern of abuse." They have made some truly bizarre changes to their products on a few occasions, and every time, the general public thinks that all Apple users will just accept and love it. In that sense, people have been making these claims about Apple and their users since the late '90s.

They're just an easy target because they have the smallest usage share in the PC market and their UX philosophy is totally different from Microsoft's (or at least it used to be).

On the total opposite end of the spectrum, I used to have a friend who would get super annoyed if someone asked waitstaff about the ingredients in a dish at a restaurant, as if it was some huge deal that someone would want to know what's in their food before they ordered it. Then again, was also the type of person who would end up ordering something with onions or peppers or something in it that he didn't like, then complain to the waitstaff and ask for another dish once he found out.

It was such a frequent problem that it was almost comical. Almost every time my friends and I went out to eat, we'd end up waiting on him to finish his meal before we could leave because he'd sent his first order back.

On the plus side, though, he also usually tipped way too much.

I've been looking at the [iRig Keys I/O](http://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/irigkeysio/) for a while now, but haven't quite pulled the trigger yet. I wouldn't be using it with an iPad, but it looks like it would be great to accompany my laptop for playing while I'm away from the house.

It's a little pricey ($200 for the 25-key model), but has its own audio interface built in, so you should be able to get MIDI into and audio out of the iPad with low-latency on a single device.

It has pitch/mod functions (touch though; no wheels) and drum pads, too.

Might be worth a look.
I bought a 0-Coast in basically the same situation as you. I wanted something West Coast-y and semi-modular, and it looked fun because of all the ridiculous timbres it's capable of.

It *is* a very fun thing to play with, but I have never managed to get it into any of my productions. It's a bit of a mix hog on its own, though I have had some success with connecting it to my Little Phatty and passing it through its LPF to tame it a little; that always results in monstrous bass tones. I've only recently started experimenting more with granular synthesis and sampling in my productions, and I definitely feel like recordings of the 0-Coast's mayhem could lead to some uncharted territory.

On one hand, I'd say don't buy it if you don't think it'll fit into your projects based on whatever recordings you've already heard of it.

On the other hand, it is *so* much fun, and worth every penny.

**Edit:** ...back on that first hand. The 0-Coast been a serious threat to my promise to myself that I would stop buying so much hardware and that I would never *ever* start dumping money into a Eurorack. I just cant help but think of how awesome this thing would be when paired with a Mother-32 and a DFAM...

**Edit 2:** I finally sat down with the 0-Coast and Live today to do some sampling. I dialed in the most noisy, un-musical thing I possibly could, then recorded for about 10 minutes while playing around with the contour and slope cycle, changing a patch cable to a different location, rinse, repeat, etc., and it has been real weird. I have only scratched the surface of the bizarre stuff that I recorded, but it's already yielded some very interesting results. Not sure why I hadn't done this before, but it's a whole new rabbit hole.
I'm trying very hard to keep myself from buying a DFAM, but I feel like I'm going to cave very soon. It seems like the perfect thing for the sort of minimal industrial tracks I've been making lately, but I just wanted to know if anyone knows of a software solution with a similar sound. I've been trying to stop amassing hardware now that I have a good controller and so many great softsynths.

If there's not a dedicated plug-in that emulates this style of drum synth, is there maybe a Reaktor or M4L device that already covers some of the same territory?

>Senate Republicans had been negotiating with them for months. That's why the CHIP re-authorization was in the bill.

Nothing was stopping CHIP re-authorization from happening prior to this C.R.

The GOP specifically refused to budge on CHIP so that they could use it to bargain with Dems when the last C.R. lapsed. *That's* why the CHIP reauthorization was in the bill.

>Republicans have far less to lose by the shutdown than Democrats

The majority party who couldn't manage to pass a budget resolution despite holding both houses of Congress and the Presidency has less to lose than the minority party in a midterm election year?

Yeah. Okay.

**Edit:** I've gotta go to bed. Just wanted to say, this has been a thing. I don't agree with how you describe the events, but I like that you're actually trying to discuss this instead of spewing MAGA shit. You're cool.
Democrats. /r/conspiracy's current talking points are that Ds only care about people who aren't citizens, so they voted ~~against the budget resolution~~ to shut down the federal government because they think we shouldn't have borders, or something.
That's mostly it, but McConnell doesn't realize that he doesn't work at the White House, and he doesn't answer to the President. If he *really* wanted to avoid a shutdown, he could have brought one of those many C.R.s to the floor for a vote, and put it on the President's desk. So what if Trump vetoed it? That's his own problem.

Fact is, Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress, there's a "Republican" in the White House, and they still couldn't make it a year without fumbling budgetary process.

Dude above you is right that both parties hold some amount of blame for the shutdown, but it never should have happened.
*cede

But you're right.
They voted against a C.R. that contained language they did not agree with. They did not vote *for* a government shutdown just because Senate Republicans refused to negotiate with them for months. CHIP and DACA should have been resolved long before the last C.R. ran out. Point blank. Period.

Nobody voted to shut down the government.

>Democrats and Republicans are using that leverage to get concessions.

FTFY. Republicans only have Senate majority by one seat. 49/51 is damn close to an even split. This is just simply not how negotiations are supposed to work. Both parties are unwilling to compromise on some things, which is to be expected, but the negotiation process has been so chaotic and disorganized because communication is breaking down.

The leadership on both sides needs to get their people in line and actually work on striking a deal that both parties can live with, and the President needs to make up his fucking mind about what it is that he wants.

Regardless, nobody voted for a shutdown. They voted against a funding resolution. The fact that the timing resulted in a shutdown is another completely separate issue.
Agreed. I don’t know how this is such a big deal. The intended sentence structure and punctuation are extremely obvious. It’s not like there’s some fancy wordplay going on. The line is broken up in a weird way as the melody returns to canon the first chorus, but it really only makes sense one way.

Nobody "voted for" a government shutdown. There was no special resolution to shut down the federal government, and no special Senatorial process by which it could pass with only 40 votes, and no 42 Senators who voted for it. I know that you understand that.

The C.R. which would have provided the necessary funding to keep the federal government afloat didn't pass because the two parties couldn't reach a compromise. It doesn't matter who you think is at fault. You can make your point without being misleading or dishonest.
Look, I want a fix for DACA from the legislative branch as much as the next guy, but don't buy into the narrative that DACA is about "the children." The opposition's message on DACA has been "won't SOMEONE think of the children?!" ever since the EO was rescinded, but it's a bit dishonest.

Many of the people whose legal status in this country is currently protected by DACA are no longer children; they *arrived* in America as children, but lots are in their 20s and 30s now. Of course, this does impact *some* children, but a significant number of the folks we're talking about here are adults, and that's just as bad.
That would be one hell of a payback for Gorsuch's stolen SCotUS seat, but neither majority party could afford to keep the federal government unfunded for ~10 months. No party participating in something that egregious would ever be in power again.
