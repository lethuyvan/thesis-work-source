I was also thinking about switching it to 3. The worst thing is that people still think everything is okay, and the "left way" is the way to go. It always has to be in the middle somewhere. Too far to the right and we've got Hitler, too far to the left and we've got a broken economy and are being overrun by others.

But yeah, those were all of the "budget phones" I've owned so far.
They generally run much smoother. Instagram loads up much faster and doesn't have microlagging, whatsapp is much faster when sending media, hangouts is day and night on iOS vs. Android. Chromecast casting on the youtube app works 1/3 of the time on Android, and most of the times on iOS... 
And that's why random Reddit users ususally don't develop flagship smartphones.
Insta, Snapchat, Whatsapp, Hangouts, Youtube, Spotify, Google Maps (generally speaking all Google apps, which is pretty ironic). 

For reference; I had 11 Android phones so far (mostly flagships), then switched to the iPhone 7, now the 8. 

I also don't understand why you bring up Apple putting development "behind a paywall". How does that matter to the end user that just wants a good working app?

Why? Honest question, since I don't understand that. When I was a kid I didn't even realize what a skin color meant. The media is making everything about race, trying to include race "minorities", thus making everything even more about race and dividing the world even more. Can't we all just get along?
Who cares which color someone has. Why does anybody keep track of how many "white heroes and black heroes" we have? WHO CARES? Just create interesting characters and movies. Who cares if Iron Man is white/black/yellow/~~orange~~ as long as it's a kick-ass movie with a kick-ass character.

But I admit, I've got that one wrong. A couple years back, when I bought my first gun, I talked with the owner of the shop I bought it in. We talked about the law, and he told me this. I never checked for myself, since I don't carry the gun on me anyway (except when going to the shooting range).
But you can drive your unloaded gun from home to work. You just have to be able to explain why you're carrying a gun ("self defense" is a viable reason)

I'm from Switzerland. I just wrote that because I don't know the hiring process of the US (where I guess you come from since most Redditors are from the US). 

For example my girlfriend recently applied for a pretty high-ranking job. Every candidate had to do multiple skill tests. She scored the hightest of them all, so she got the job. Nobody cares if you're a woman or a man.
I don't know where you come from, but where I'm from people definitely get selected solely by skill. A normal company can't afford to just go and hire random people. 
Maybe I'm just crazy, but why don't we just hire the people best suited for the job, regardless of gender?

Why do you people always need to bring in other things that are not even remotely related to the cause. I'd prefer parfume and sweaty people smell 100 times over cigarette smoke. It's just so utterly disgusting for non-smokers
Or those who are still smoking when the train arrives, then decide to fill their lungs up one last time just before entering the train. Then throw the burning cigarette to the ground and breat out all of the smoke inside of the train
For me it's the smell and the damage it does to my lungs. My lungs are already damaged, I don't need more damage done to them

So I did the math. Counting only from 2000 to 2017, there were 3088 deaths from islamist terror attacks in the US. It's kind of difficult to find the deathcount of "old white guys", so I just used a list of rampage killers in general. According to this list there were 117 deaths from rampage killers. I don't know how many of them were "old white guys", but I guess it's not the majority.

So we have 3088 against 117. 

&nbsp;

Let's go further. The US has a total population of ~325'000'000 people. 

70.9% of them are Christians. That's ~230'500'000 people.

0.9% are Muslims. That's ~3'000'000 people.

&nbsp;

So a religious group of 3'000'000 people are responsible for 3088 deaths and a religious group of 230'000'000 people are responsible for 117 deaths. 

&nbsp;

Okay, 3 facts:

1. Donald is hated by the majority of the people

2. Donald is constantly being over-analyzed, being looked at, standing under the radar of the public. 

3. Donald is pretty damn stupid (according to Reddit)

So how could such a stupid person, who is under the constant eye of the hateful public manage to cheat the tax system (illegally), without getting caught? 
> Tax "rate".

Damn, my bad. English isn't my first language. I meant percentually.

> Remember when your master said he would release them? 

He's not my "master", as I don't even live on the same continent as he does. But I generally don't understand the uproar because of that. I don't think it will show fraud. A successful business man on this level, with his level of publicity (and hate from the public) can't allow himself even the smallest illegal sidestep... Where I come from, the tax departments don't fuck around. They will tear you a second asshole if you try yourself at tax fraud. No matter how rich/poor you are.

He "convinced" a lot of big companies to build new factories in the US, thus creating jobs. Jobs help with unemployment (duh), poverty, and possibly homelessness.

So North Korea is good. Unemployment is good. Homelessness is good. Poverty is good.

Hope I don't get downvoted to hell for having an iPhone. I like the new control center. Paired with 3d touch, I can access everything very easily. 3d touch on the music part, it opens a bigger control screen, in which I can skip etc. 3d touch the part with wlan/bluetooth and I have even more options (airdrop, hotspot etc.). 3d touch the flashlight and I can set its brightness. 3d touch the timer and I can set a timer from 5 minutes to 2 hours in 1 click.

Started 2.5 Weeks ago. But I've been training for 4 months on a demo account with different amounts of money as a start. I'm using Trading212. I'm mainly going with cryptos and indexes, because they're very volatile.

/r/investing  
/r/daytrading  
/r/stockmarket  
/r/forex  
/r/wallstreetbets (for the fun, don't take advice from there though)

I started with 1k (you can start with only 100 bucks with the broker I use, but that's pretty useless tbh). 

I'm trading in the Forex market. The Forex market uses leverage. You pay a certain % of the price of an asset (called margin). For example the Apple stock has a margin of 5%. ATM it costs about $160. So I pay 8 bucks for one stock (5% of 160). That way I can make (or lose...) a lot of money, without a big investment

Okay
I'm in the exact same situation as OP. I recently started daytrading. There's so much to learn about it, and as a bonus you can make a little bit of money on the side.

I think this is one of its advantages, because more and more people lose their trust in governments... 
I meant once every Bitcoin is mined, and the price gets somewhat "stable"... Wherever that will be. I think then it will be a very attractive option to put your money
I thought the same... The bigger it gets, the more shops and broker will accept it, the more accepted it is, the bigger it will get... 

I think with Bitcoins we see something that's never been there. It doesn't play after the typical "rules" of the stock market. That's why I'm also skeptical when someone says it's a bubble
> why are you assuming there's always an equal amount of buyers as sellers? 

I think because everyone knows of the potential gains on Bitcoin, they will throw their everything at it, when it drops... The past kinda shows this. BTC had a couple of "crashes", but always recovered pretty fast and shot up even higher... 

I think it could be a save space, because it doesn't work like anything we've ever seen. It's not physical money where you can just print more (causing inflation), it's not a stock of a company that can go bancrupt...

I'm just speculating tho. I'm interested in other opinions :)

That's true. It has an image of "the currency the bad guys use"... But I think over long term it will become something like Gold is today. A long term investing tool, to have some secured money on the side
Yeah some people might start to sell as the price drops, but just as many will buy them, because of the falling price... It's self sustaining I guess...

I think Bitcoin might also become a "save space", because a stock market crash will not do very much to Bitcoin... 
> Possibly quantum computing

How could that crash BTC? BTC has a maximum amount of possible bitcoins.

Why do you even come to these kind of threads? Just to get triggered and rant out people who disagree with your lifestyle? 
Veganism is a trend. People start to do it to "feel better" (about themselves), but after a couple of years (at most) they realize, that it's just not realistic to live a life like this. When you're young, your body is strong and can do amazing things, even go through a nutritional withdrawal over multiple YEARS. But as you get older and older, your body becomes more and more dependent on a well rounded diet. Yeah, you could probably eat pills for the rest of your life, to substitute for all the nutritional deficiencies a vegan diet brings, but that doesn't really sound appealing to me.
So, I can get a pack of beef, some rice or noodles, a bit of whole milk for sauce, and a pack of frozen veggies for around 10 bucks where I come from. This will last me for 3-4 meals, and pretty much give me all of the nutrients I need. 

If I wanted that meal in "vegan", I'd have to throw away the beef, the milk, probably the noodles if they have eggs in them, and the veggies will be disgusting, as I can't use butter. So then if I wanted to get the same amount of nutrients with just vegan food, I'd somehow have to substitute ~40g of protein, a whole lot of vitamins and minerals, ~100g carbs and a whole lot of healthy fats. 

Carbs is the smallest problem, since I'd still be able to eat rice, potatoes and most noodles.   
I could probably do the protein if I ate a shitton of beans (yay).  
I could get some fats, I guess.  
But a whole lot of vitamins and minerals I'd have to substitute artificially (like B12), which is pretty damn costly.

So why should I voluntarily go vegan, if it means I can only eat bland and boring food, have to constantly eat pills so my body will function over long term, and pay more? 

A vegan diet is a privilege for first world people who want to feel better about themselves, but don't want to actually do anything that requires work or real effort. It's the same as giving $20 a year to PETA. You don't do it because it changes anything, you do it because you then can feel better about yourself. 

That's the same reason vegans always have to tell everyone they're vegan. How should they get the confirmation, that they are *better human beings*, if they don't TELL people, that they are better human beings?

IMO acts speak louder than words, but to each their own I guess.

Y'all might not like Trump, but he is a business man. He makes decisions like a business man. 
Just calculated OP's numbers down from the numbers I remember. IIRC there are ~1.3m people in the army and ~6000 trans people. This means that 1.3m people cost $84m (in "dick pills"), whilst 6000 trans people cost $4m. That's ~$64 per "normal person" and ~$666 per trans person...

Homosexuality is a defect. Asexuality is a defect. Queer is a huge defect. Bisexuality is a defect.

Hetero is normal. If you're gay, that's okay. I just don't understand why suddenly every gay person has to come forward and BE PROUD for being gay.  
That's like if I have a tumor, then come forward and say I'm proud of that.

Yeah. The only reason we don't really eat dogs in the western world, is because cows/pigs are just better suited to be "mass produced".
The thing I observe is when Trump supporters actually try to argue on Reddit (outside of t_d) they get downvoted to hell.

They write a wall of text, exactly describing their thoughts, well documented claims etc. and get a -15 score. Then someone answers "you're a Trump supporter, your words mean nothing" or something like that, 80 upvotes.


Just look at /u/JimmyTwoTwo 's answer to your comment. He says what he thinks and gets downvoted

I don't understand this argument. We don't give foxes shit for hunting and eating animals, eventhough he could survive with just berries and stuff (a "vegan" diet). Why should I feel ashamed? I understand that buying a whole chicken for like $4 is not a very moral thing to do, so I avoid that. But I see cows, pigs, chicken, and a whole lot of other farm animals running around literally just outside my windows. Some time in the future some of them get killed, and their meat gets sold. They had an awesome life in the beautiful fields around here, eating fresh gras all day long, running around free. Then one day when they get older, the farmer takes them, then puts them down in a way, they don't even feel anything (the laws here prohibit anything unhuman).

Do you feel ashamed driving your car, because it harms the environment, and you kill a whole lot of insects while driving? Do you feel bad for walking outside, because sometimes you accidentally walk over a bug or a spider, killing them? Do you feel bad for eating food that has to be imported from other countries, harming the environment and thus animals wordwide?
Okay, let's look at the comic again then, shall we? Because [this](http://i.imgur.com/Ra1vqw0.png) doesn't really look like a BLACK man starving to me.
I am no Vegan. But when I buy a nice steak, I go to the local butcher. I also live in Switzerland. The animals here have it better than anywhere else. 
Yeah man, I'm gonna throw away the steaks in my fridge when I come home this evening. Why should I eat disgusting steaks, when I can have some awesome grass soup with some delicious grass bread?
It's probably because most countries with starving people are located in Africa, which is mostly inhabited by black people.

But yeah, let's make this a race issue
You live in a luxury first-world country that allows you to literally decide what you eat everyday, that allows you to go out of your way to eat only non-animal products. Then you have the audacity to tell someone who eats animal products (which is his free choice) to "tell that to starving people", while sitting there, feeling good about yourself, because you're "saving" the planet?

We people in the first world have no idea of the luxury we live in every day. 
But don't you want to eat all of that delicious grass those cows get?

Of all the arguments vegans could make up, they decide to go with this horseshit

"A couple decades ago", you mean back when the average life expectancy was around 25 years?

This is the best compliment one can get on the internet. Thank you
And I fully support that. But there are just things that are plain stupid. There's a lot of shady shit going on in the world, the government trying to kill or control you with vaccinations is just not true. 

Vaccinations should be mandatory IMO. Un-vaccinated people are a threat to other humans.

Because it's a lifestyle. They think they're a better human being, but after a couple of weeks most fall back and eat normal again. But during this time they have to make up for their insecurities, by pretending to be a better human being

It's ShareBlue's next sub they're promoting with bot upvotes to go against Trump. The ex-moderator and creator of /r/MarchAgainstTrump  is the creator of this sub, and one of the most frequent posters.

Good thing both of his accounts were suspended just days ago

Edit.  
Also, look at that. The 3rd post on top of all time has the mod of /r/MAT promote this sub https://np.reddit.com/r/MarchAgainstTrump/comments/6iq9uu/number_of_people_that_miss_president_obama/

You can't just go around, posting comments like this, and don't provide a link
Upvoted, fucking karma whore
I'm wondering when this sub will get banned
I think it's making people form their own opinion. For me, it made me do the research on Trump myself. I then realized, that the media (and Reddit) are spinning a lot of things around, to make him look bad. Now I'd call myself a Trump supporter (eventhough I'm from Switzerland, lol). But he also does a lot of things I don't agree on. But I formed my own opinion. 
I'd love to see OP living without eating carbs at all. I'd give him 2 weeks before collapsing

I don't really like "deep" quotes, but there's one that really stuck to me; Everyone dies, but not everyone lives.

I like how more and more people get pissed at all of this blind anti-Trump bashing. 
Awesome
Oh no, how sad
That's gotta be that strange asian group (like 20-30 people) walking 20 meters in front of me on a street. Suddenly they all stop, turn to their left, and start getting excited and taking pictures. There was a tree, so I didn't see what they were taking pictures off. It was also my way home, which I walk everyday, so I knew there couldn't be something THAT special. 

I kept on walking, then reached the group (which was still taking pics), looked to the left, and they were literally taking pictures of the roof of a house. The ROOF... of a HOUSE... I was so confused.

>And it is really difficult to find King Cornetto outside Switzerland

That's funny, I never realized that King Cornetto is something that special. When I want an ice, I always go to a gelateria, and get a fresh one. More expensive, but totally worth it!

What will you visit on your next trip to Switzerland? Which cities? 
You should drive to Interlaken, then Brienz, then over the Brünig-pass. You will drive over a mountain, thinking you're far away from any civilization, then turn around the next corner and stand in front of a pretty big town. Drive through it, further up the mountain. Nothingness as far as the eye reaches. Suddenly another town... It just keeps going like that, it's really funny.

King Cornetto is not THAT special. We have "Bauernhofglace", which is self-made ice, which you can only buy on certain farms! There's nothing better on a hot, sunny day!

I doubt I'd shake my head. I'm getting used to it, since I moved to the capital city (Bern). Everything is getting photographed, and I mean EVERYTHING
Is "schmutz" an english word?
True! I always get reminded of how beautiful my country is when I see a post of it somewhere on reddit. Where do you come from?
I live in Switzerland. It's really funny to watch tourists taking pics of literally ANYTHING. Some random house, a street, a train. Everything

I'm not from America, I just like to follow up on the things happening over there. I'm from Switzerland. We pay ~250-400 bucks per month for healthcare. But we have a system called "Prämienverbilligung" which pays your healthcare, if you don't earn enough money to realistically pay the fee.

Funniest thing; it's fake. The girl in the pics is apparently a ~~whale~~ plus-size model. She messaged me when I posted it here first a couple months back. She wrote that she will post my "reddit handle" on her insta page, and have everyone report me, and I will get banned. I laughed at her and kept shitposting.

I mean it's not nice to have someone take your pics and make such a fake pic. But on the other hand, if she would've just asked me to delete it, I would've done that, no questions asked. Also if you post pictures on the internet, you just have to expect them to get misused...

I live in Switzerland, so the average 1.5 litre soda bottle costs ~2.50
I also like coffe/soda etc. TBH the main reason I almost exclusively drink water is because I'm just too lazy to constantly buy soda. I drink ~5-7 litres per day, it's much easier to just open the tap and fill a glas up with water, than to carry tons of soda bottles into my home

True. People often look at me funny when I tell them I mainly drink water

> So, I live in London, UK and I'm just finishing my first year in a college where more than 90 percent of the students are Muslims. I'm white, cis and gay. I came to this college because I didn't really care about anyone's background (it's London, fucking mess of a city in this sense). Ever since I came I realised that I'm against nearly everything they stand for. Girls planning to get married at the age of 18 without having a bit of "fun" beforehand, guys being disgusting as hell etc. Muslim guys are the worse, they admit to not showering but one a week, they act like it's the third world (never seen a toilet so disgusting, even tho I've been to some sketchy places), they look awful, don't care about themselves etc. Girls are repressed and they think it's ok. Some students even think the London attacks were justified by religion and was OK?! Fucking hate them lot. There are some exceptions but rare. Call me racist but I've tried to go with an open heart. I was also told countless times that my sexuality was a sin and even got told that they "hope once the sharia law comes to uk so they can kill me freely". Tried reporting to higher authorities but my school keeps quite. It's devastating. As much as I'm for equality, I strongly believe their ideology has no place in Europe.

Hahaha yeah atm it's really bad... We have a huge heat wave since 2 weeks. The sun shines right through the window in the evening, and sets behind the mountains. It looks really nice, but it's so damn hot. I have to put the blinds down all the way. Then at ~9:30PM it gets a bit colder outside, so I can open the blinds and open every window in the apartment (as I did when this pic was taken).
I moved out 3 years ago, this is my second own apartment. 
I loved it in my previous apartment. It gets very, VERY bright! You have to face it away from the bed, because you wouldn't see shit waking up with this little sun in your face. 

Now I don't use it anymore, TBH. When I wake up at 6AM it's already very bright outside, so the whole room is filled with orange sunlight. 


Well in summer (so at the moment) the blanket is more to "look nice". I never use it in the night, it's so hot!

When I do use it, it's big enough for me. When the GF sleeps at my place, I have a second blanket. This one would be big enough though (if she wouldn't transform into a burrito with it, leaving no blanket space for me)

Very true. It's very hard to find a job as a non-swiss.

That's true. I think having a master degree is the only realistic way of getting a job here. 

Another possibility is to get a job in the US in a company that has a place in Switzerland as well. Then you could make a intern transfer...
Uh
No, it's big enough for me. And I have a second one for the GF, since she's always stealing mine.

Slow steps. Aim for 2100, do it for 3 days, then 2200 for 3, 2300 for 3 etc. until you reach 3000. This way your stomach adapts to more food and literally stretches itself. 

Also plan your calories. Milk is very good, 650kcal per liter.  
Don't eat when you're hungry, eat when you aren't full anymore. Always have some snack with you. If you get hungry, you fucked up. You will learn to hate the hunger feeling.

It can take a couple of months, just make sure you eat more and more over time. Don't go from 2000 to 3000 in 2 days.

Do you even do research before you say stuff?

So you're saying that making a couple million- into a couple billion dollars is no problem?

I think I might get banned for doxxing or something like that. Just look over at some similar subs, it's posted all over reddit, but without the censored information
You really convinced me with your logical reasoning and your astonishing arguments
Don't think so. I'm not allowed to post their Twitter handle here, but it looks pretty "serious"
Holy shit are you me? Quit weed a year ago, because of the exact same symptoms you described. Feeling "distant" to reality, sometimes like it's all just a dream. I have this basically all the time I'm not at home. It gets much MUCH worse when I'm looking someone in the eyes. 

It could also be some kind of vitamine deficiency though...

I'm on Reddit since 3 years, and I've never read the rediquette once. I feel bad now
Very true, I actually have the IQ of an average potato! Doctors still don't understand how I'm able to survive, since my IQ shouldn't even be high enough to breath
Same. This "lifestyle" got me out of my depression. The most important factor was to "enjoy the little things". 

I'd always sit at home, gaming the whole evening, until I went to bed. I never had the urge to go out, because I didn't know what to do.  
So I started to just go out of my house by myself. Just walk along the streets in the night, enjoying the stars in the sky, the silence, the darkness. Maybe sit on a bench somewhere higher up and enjoy the view.


Interesting point... I've never looked at it that way. 

I think Putin "likes" Trump because he's more right leaning and "extrem" than Obama was (since Putin is the same as well). 

I'm really looking forward to the next couple of years, I think it will be very interesting to watch what happens in the world.
You're like the niceguy of memes.

True, you can never really trust them 100%. Honestly, as long as there aren't any nukes flying over my head, I'm pretty much happy.
This is just my view. I don't think there's an official rule, just do what you think is good. If you get massive downvotes, you're doing it wrong :)
I know, I got it from /r/cats I think. 

I think if you see a post that would fit in another sub, then go ahead and repost it there :) 
I don't see it posted here already
As a random guy from Europe, I like the fact, that the 2 biggest nuclear powers on this planet finally "like each other" again. I don't see how this is bad.

I cringe so hard just thinking about this show. I can't understand how people actually watch this. The only people I know who watch this show are some grade A /r/iamversmart material
I think this is pretty important, that's why I posted it here, instead of /r/SRC_Meta.
I posted a fucking meme. I don't care what you wrote.
When will you fuckheads understand this, it's not about Trump. It's about Reddit admins manipulating posts, because they don't like them. This is a total no-go. It's not about which sub it's happening in, it's the fact that it's happening.

I guess they can't really put a patent on "pictures your followers/contacts can see, but disappear after 24 hours"... If they could, Facebook would still find a way to copy their features.

I love how pissed Facebook is. They want to buy Snapchat, but Snap won't sell. So they start throwing a tantrum and copy Snapchat functions into all of their apps (Instagram, Facebook, Whatsapp)
So let me get this straight, the only "evidence" (that's how you call it, I'll get to that later) of god is that we don't understand the whole concept of the big bang yet?

First of all, the Big Bang is a THEORY. 

> Had the Big Bang occurred as currently accepted then there should be an infinite amount of Big Bangs over time

And how do we know that's not the case? 

> you go from no matter to all of the matter in the universe in an instant

Big misconception. You don't go from "no matter to all of the matter". "All of the matter" is just compressed into a singularity. Similar to the core of black holes, in which all of its mass is compressed into a single point in space (-> singularity).

> Number 2 shows that what we had was a supernatural work

I like how you just assume something's supernatural, just because you can't explain it. 

Let's take a look back. When meteorites rained down on the earth, people didn't know what was happening, so they attributed it to something "supernatural". When there was a thunderstorm, they didn't understand those sudden flashes of light, so they thought it had to be something of greater power.

I think it's pretty interesting that we have more FACTUAL evidence to the theory of our reality being a simulation, than we have that god exists. 

Remove every religion and every religious book there is, 1000 years later hundreds of different "religions" will pop back up.  
Remove every science/math book, and our knowledge about it, 1000 years later everything will be back the same way it is today.
No, as long as you constantly smile at the camera, you'll be fine
I find it funny how people defending religion ALWAYS change the subject when someone brings up logic or evidence
extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence
The bible is a book that's been translated and re-written hundreds of times over 2 centuries. Everyone added or changed something.

I'd like to see some evidence from today.

The thing that made me not believe in a god anymore is mainly that there's nothing that would "prove" or show the existence of a god outside of our brains. Nothing in nature shows a presence of a higher being. Every single evidence is just an idea of us humans.

Also how there are so many completely different religions with different gods and belief systems. Why do people believe in god, but look at old greek gods (like Zeus) as a fantasy figure? What makes "god" different?
Why should they cry for impeachement when he has such a low chance of winning that "Hillary isn't even thinking about him anymore"?

Well they essentially are (physically). For example a team of female pro soccer players lost against a team of under 15 year old boys 7-0.[link](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3609949/Matildas-lose-7-0-Newcastle-Jets-15s-Rio-Olympics-warm-up.html)

Women are better than men at other things like showing empathy and giving emotional support. It has always been like that, men defend women because they're stronger, while women support their men emotionally.

I don't see why this is such a problem in 2017.

True. Also in this screenshot it's taken out of context. This was my whole comment:

> I see what you're saying, but this goes both ways. There are so many things men get treated worse than women, but nobody's screaming about that.

>I think western feminists need to shut their mouths. They are amongst the most privileged humans on this planet. They have everything, and they still complain and think they have it bad.

>Women from islamic countries have it bad. They get stoned, raped, tortured, beaten. They aren't allowed to show skin. If they get raped, they get stoned for sleeping with another man, etc.
You're a troll, I see. Didn't catch on the first time, my bad.
Did... Did you actually read what I posted? I said western feminists need to shut up, not western women. It's no secret that the "goals" of feminists changed from valid points, to utterly nonsense nowadays. 

I have no idea what your comment about conservatives has to do with this matter. I guess you just dislike them and wanted to bring it up.
I don't really get what this post has to do with this? Doesn't he just say he wants to "talk" with Russia?

English isn't my first language, so I don't know if "share with Russia" means something different
It's... It's literally [fake news](http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/05/breaking-mcmaster-makes-statement-following-wapo-crap-story-story-reported-false-video/). 

Yeah he was a stupid troll, and I don't understand why he's commenting if he has nothing to add to the conversation, but this one's pretty bad
I see what you're saying, but this goes both ways. There are so many things men get treated worse than women, but nobody's screaming about that.

I should've phrased it differently. I didn't mean hate, I meant laugh about, or letting him stand in a bad light. 

English isn't my first language, as you might've already guessed
I... I still don't see a single specific right western women lack nowadays. I also don't see a single way women are treated worse than men nowadays.

The only thing you're right about is women being treated like property in some countries. Mainly islamic countries. But somehow that's not what western "feminists" are fighting for. 
I'm sorry, but your post screams "I know if someone would do the stuff I say it would work, but I'm not doing it, because I lack the discipline and willpower". 

The fact that you blame everything but you, the fact that you can't take criticism, the fact that you won't even think about a tip or advice of someone else. 

A serious question on this matter; how old are you? 
You must be a fun person, if you decide to dislike someone just because they have a different view than you do
That's true, I still don't get it though. What rights do they miss nowadays compared to men?

I think equalism fits much better
If you keep using excuses as to why you fail with women, it won't ever work out.

A 1/10 has more romantic options in 2017, true. But a normal man also has it a lot easier to become the best version of himself. You can read how to workout, how to eat properly, how to "master life" in general online.  
Men have it a lot easier to meet women as well. We have dating sites, we have the internet. 15 years ago you had to walk up to a woman and ask her out. Nowadays even awkward idiots could get dates, if they play their cards right with Tinder/etc. 

Stop using excuses, stop blaming others and the circumstances and start working on yourself. See this as a life advice in general. If you just start taking responsibility, everything will become easier. 

It's not the womens fault if they ignore you, it's not your bosses fault if you don't earn enough, it's not life's fault if you work a tiring minimum-wage job for the rest of your life. It's your fault. And that's good, because that means it's in your power to CHANGE it.
> Or, someone forgot their medication.

Yeah, they're [atheists](https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c7171e6211316a901f1942dfcb5145e6-c) mostly
Here's what I noticed. I've seen countless medicines and technological advancements that save millions of lifes on the base of modern science, and not a single one coming from saints or religions.

Goes both ways
> the other is trying to ensure the first group doesn't wind up in the bad version of the afterlife

An atheist couldn't care less about "afterlife", because it doesn't exist (for him). I can't believe people still believe in this stuff so strongly. We have science, we have evidence that after you die, you're fucking dead. ATM we have more evidence that we might live in a fucking simulation, than that there's a god, an afterlife, heaven or hell.
> As an atheist one doesn't believe in any sort of afterlife so there it no reason to try and preach about the lack of a god 

What kind of logic is that? Religion is slowing our progress as a species down so much. In the last couple years it got better though, since more people think on their own and form their own opinion on things (a thing the church/religion doesn't want you to do). 

I still won't preach about atheism all the time, but if some religious guy tries to convince me of their religion, why shouldn't I conter their arguments? 
You really have to put an "/s" on every joke you make on Reddit...
That's true. If you want to believe in anything, go for it. Why should anyone stop you.

What I absolutely hate are those guys that try to convince you that god exists or anything. I let you believe what you want, so let me "not believe" if I want to. Also don't try to convince me of something without any prove. 
No, but if believing in god is punished by getting your balls chopped off, I'd bet religion would die out within 1 generation.


Ok
Believe in god? Get your balls chopped off. 

^^^^^^/s ^^^^^^just ^^^^^^in ^^^^^^case
Atheists can be cunts. Same goes for religious people. When you argue with a religious guy about prove or anything, it always comes down to "well I just KNOW there is something that's watching over us".

True. If your phone breaks you just have to reset it and redownload anything. If you're smart you set up some kind of back-up, but it's still a pain in the ass.

No, here in Switzerland you aren't allowed to ride those that young. When you're under 25 you are only allowed to drive <25kw motorcycles. To drive the big ones, you either have to be 25, or have to drive the <25kw one for at least 2 years.
