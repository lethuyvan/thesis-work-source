So if I plug in my i7+ into my friends  xbox it would make it an iPhoneX right?

Inb4removed
omg I freaking loved that game! Had all gold guns and several world records of all species. Its a shame they don’t make this kind of hunting games anymore. I mean besides thehunter of course. 
What problems would one run into? 
I always used my backups from my older, jailbroken phones and I never had any issues (at least not that I’m aware of). 
Been doing it since my iPhone 3G.
Like TheAdminRP ?
Maybe on r/shitty_car_mods
I don’t think he hit the breaks tbh
If it works like v0rtexnonce it will keep the nonce after reboot. 
Like I said, i would save them in a text file. 
I have my model (Axxxx / 9,4) and  ecid in hex and dec saved so and can easily access them. 
 
You could also save them in your phones notes app so you wouldn’t even meed that txt file from your pc.
Maybe tim sits in his office laughing his ass off while switching the signing on and off. Totally knowing a good amount of r/jailbreaker will ruin their downgrade bc the signing stops in the middle of the process.
Why did you wait for itunes?
You could have just went to the tss saver page and save them.

I saved my ecid and all infos in a txt file so i can save blobs without having to check ecid in itunes
As long as there is no SEP workaround its not possible
Just restore?
!remindme 31 days
Try cydia eraser or do it via find my iphone
Thanks for that picture. Not that I wouldn’t believe you otherwise ;)
However I never had my watch update without me doing anything so I think I’m good. Maybe I’ll try to reinstall.
[This might help. You’re welcome ](https://m.wikihow.com/Be-Patient) 
Did that but didn’t got that message. It just installed directly to the phone
Not sure if missing /s ... if not: weneta much?
How?
Your welcome! 
Unfortunately there is no way. Tbh i lost my 9.3.3 jb on my old i6 and I absolutely miss it. Even if it’s just for the sake of having had it on 9.3.3 for so long and being on a stable jb. 
Just stay on that version - believe me once you get a new device you’ll love it on 9.2
Restore in itunes (10.3.3 to 10.3.3)? Wont work as it loads the last signed SEP which is 11.2.x. Even with future restore you need a signed sep to work

However you could try cydia eraser to delete everything jb related, not sure if it deletes all data too. Better make a backup

E: Happy cake day
It works but only with A7 devices

E: assuming he has another device than stated in the flair
It also didn’t save it for my i6
Just had to update my precious i6 (ex pangu 9.3.3) to 11.2... fml
But at least i did so before they stop signing <11.2.5.
Although i rarely used my i6 it’s such a bloody shame that i lost my 9.3.3 jb
We’ll change happens all the time in life I guess 

E: hoping for a solution to set nonce on 11.2 before the sep won’t be compatible anymore 
Just to be clear, with FFZ enabled you dont see embedded clips? - not talking about legacy here oc
The thing I don’t understand is that they are a twitch feature not a ffz one. And they show up without ffz/bttv.
Most of the ppl don’t have this issue so I really don’t know what’s going on.
Especially now that I encountered this on a brand new laptop with a fresh firefox install.
Well, as one would expect it works fine on legacy as it literally is the „old twitch“.
But yes, I saw some features pop back up over time.
I just don’t understand how ffz could affect embedded clips if there isnt even an option to hide them?
bttv on the other hand has a switch to turn them off so you would only see the link but mine isn’t set.

I started to ask around in the channels I normaly hang out and have found other people saying they also have this bug. 
Hitting F12 in the browser doesn’t give any clue - although I sadly don’t exactly know what to look for.
I’m on 11.1.2 on my 7+ and watchOS 4.2 and only get the move goal achievements. Do I have to activate some settings to get those „personalized“ achievements?
Judging by his username he can’t be that experienced in life
Don’t feed the troll.. smh

Oh man did I have a crush on her back then
Doesn’t colorflow use MS?
or Damn NFO Viewer
v0rtexnonce to set nonce on 10.3.x
Bc people these days think “they know/can jelbrek” just because they hit a “jailbreak button” once or twice and read 2-3 posts in this sub.. smh
Or at least do some research on reddit or google
Not sure if theres a typo in your title but yes, upgrading to 11.2.2 will make you lose your jb
But only 3.60 games, right?
You should check out r/catsareassholes
You’re welcome

Just hide the app somewhere in a folder.

You could check in the settings - i think it’s in settings -> general -> storage or something like that and there should be the update files. 
Maybe deleting that could get rid of that red badge.
What device and iOS version?
Use tvOS beta profile (tvOS10) to stop your phone from downloading iOS11
I’m not 100% sure regarding yalu 10.2 and if cydia eraser is a must before restoring.
*NORMALY* you could just (backup if needed) and restore with future restore. 
Some jb related files will remain on your phones, but cydia eraser technically should delete them all.

E: note if you back up there will be some jb related files left behind. Iirc those files are tweak setting files and stuff like that. Thats just how itunes backup works.
I think your caps broke
Check [ipsw.me](www.ipsw.me) only 11.2+ are signed
What about:

r/ios
r/iphone
r/apple
The more you try to keep things away from people, the more they seek to get said things.
If you haven’t already done I suggest to x-post to r/legacyjailbreak
Dude you really should do some jailbreak homework... If you are not sure - and judging by your post history in r/jailbreak in some cases you are simply not - please don’t spread false information. At least google before commenting. We all had to learn jb related stuff sooner or later, but again if you’re not sure or just think you know the answer -> google is your friend. 
You may kill someone’s jailbreak, please keep that in mind.

Cydia Eraser doesn’t just delete Cydia:

> Running this tool will destroy all of your data: this is the goal. Do not run this unless you want to destroy all data.


> Cydia Eraser is a tool which has only one feature: to remove and revert all changes made to the device and return it to "stock" Apple iOS software without updating to a new version of iOS.

Was that the reason for your boot loop?
What did you do?
Any infos on folder enhancer?
What I meant was that you need a signed SEP (the ones from 11.2.x in that case) that will be compatible with 11.1.2. And I don’t know if the beta one would work 
There is a windows fork which was used be many people in this sub.
Oh the irony 
Just ignore it, he hasn’t done his homework. 11.2.2 SEP is still compatible with 11.1.2. Not sure about thebeta ones though 
One reason would be that the next ios update also updates SEP. You wouldn’t be able to update anymore
How is folderenhancer not on this list?
what are you talking about??
Why should he use ios11 sep on ios10? He wants to update so SEP isn’t even a problem here..


I mean we saw what happened...
I still don’t understand why the hell they did this..smh
They had both controls in one app. Also why is the now playing complication not available on every watch face.. I don’t get it
I’m on 4.2 but don’t seem to find that complication. Do you have to add it in the watch app?
[Thats one pic of the article posted in the comments](https://images.bonkersabouttech.com/image-server/vmgalyuzpfoot7pojt9eq9v8cdsinfqa.jpg) 
Do you mean Norway?
Cringe
I was talking about watchOS not iOS.

E: however I’m not sure if that makes a difference as ipsw.me does not show if they are signed. 
I’m not even sure if you could use those builds of watchOS with those $100 cables but that’s what I was referring to
Dang it. 

It seems kinda strange that we are not able to do that. I remember someone mentioning that all versions of watchOS are still being signed and could be installed at any given time. But I’m not 100% sure if thats true.
Yep
I know that, but afaik these version can eventually be jailbroken.

Forgot to add -> x-post from r/gifs
See sally? Told you I can jump over that bus!
I get that but I just try to understand whats going on.
Thing is I used the same passcode for years, why should I forget it? 
Also, doesn’t iOS count the same wrong passcode as one attempt? I think I read that somewhere..

However, I think 2-step verification (which I don’t blame) has a very confusing wording which can be seen [in this Apple Community post](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7537318) 

Well, I guess RIP my testing device as it is disabled now.
You don’t drag the future restore into cmd.exe.
First put all files into the future restore folder. Open cmd.exe and cd into that folder. Type in the command and drag in the shsh2/ipsw file where you are supposed to enter their file name. 
Is that a speck case?

I need to reinstall firefox and don't want to use sync as it syncs back all settings. For some reason I can't watch streams above 480p without heavy buffering and I guess it's because of some setting. 
However I installed chrome and imported my passwords and hope to reimport them to firefox.
is there a way to import them through passwordfox? 
like save them as *.html and import them to firefox?
If not we have to manually type in at least 30-50 username/password combos which would be a real pain in the backside tbh

I've never shot a rifle myself and I didn't have the time to do much research. To you it might seem very obvious that you wouldn't hear the clip eject.

What watchOS version is running on your watch?
I still don't see my perfect month achievement. I can see it the day I unlocked it (dec 31st) but it won't show up in achievement. Also my January (greyed out) isn't showing

Edit: restarted both iphone and watch several times and still nothing
Same problem here. 
7+ on 10.3.1 and S2 on 3.1.3. I got the achievement on my watch and I can see in the activity app on the day I got it but it's missing under achievements.
And like OP said I'm also missing the January achievement which normally is shown greyed out

Edit: OP what watchOS you've got installed?
I didn't get my monthly December achievement :( My watch is still on 3.1.3, so I'm wondering what version you've got installed?
*Fidget the spinner
Kinda true. You can read the title in two ways though: 
- Which jailbreak am I missing for those versions of iOS
- These are the only jailbreaks I know of, which am I missing
No offense and I really get your point, BUT it's like saying Mac OS X Lion (10.7) had nothing to do with OS X Mountain Lion (10.8). 
Its just the name of an operating system given by the company who developed it. It evolves in terms of coding AND naming. (Check wikipedia for the evolution of Macintosh System Software -> macOS)
However the "jump" from iPhone OS to iOS isn't that big of a change

You beat me to it.

[Here's the Air Crash Investigation Episode covering that accident](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1wq8tq) 
Did you close the activity apps on both devices before restarting? I had this bug several times but I resolved it in different ways.

 "Kill" the activity app on the watch by bringing it up, pressing the side button until the power down screen shows up and then press the crown until you see your watch face again. 

Optional: At this point you could close the activity app on the phone and reboot it. Unlock your phone and open the app switcher.

On your watch the activity app and wait until the "Activity - from "your_watch" tab shows up in the app switcher. Hit that and see what happens.
Your devices *should* now synch up again.

As last option you could play with the phone's date settings. Try setting it to yesterday/tomorrow and back again. Sometimes that triggers the rings to close in the activity app.

Thats how I resolve this bug. Sorry for the wall of text, hope it helps!
Restart the watch and maybe also your phone

Remember to use the right beta profile though. Beta 10 for ios 10 - beta 11 for ios 11
Stay and wait till a jailbreak drops (and enjoy it) or use that to set a nonce to upgrade to 11.1.2 (if wanted/needed). 
I second that. One should expect at least some will to wanting to understand what your doing BEFORE you do it. 
And I don't mean understanding a jailbreak in terms of how it works technically. But at least get some basic knowledge on the matter as it could totally brick your phone a few years back. Today it will only fuck up your jailbreak in the worst case.

Oh ok. I'm too lazy to test other reddit apps tbh
Nope, as SEP will be incompatible.
You could try julio vernes nonceseter112 (not sure if it is the exact name) and try to set nonce. If it works you can use futurerestore and one of the update/downgrade tutorials that match your device/computer setup to restore to the same fw

I see it on mobile though:) you're welcome

And you only watched that for ... science, right?
That's because those devices depend on each other when paired. Thats normal. 

Edit: The only thing you could do is to unpair them, but thats kinda useless right? Just in general: With iOS 10 you had to have watchOS 3.x, with iOS 11 came watchOS 4 etc
However, as long as your watch is still compatible with your iOS and therefore pairs with it you should be fine. 
What iOS and watchOS were you prior to that?

Edit:
What I mean is, did you update your SE before the watch forced an update?
lol was going to suggest r/mildlypenis but then I zoomed in.. 
I like the color combination of white and gold!

We reach last years level where everyone posted everything Luca tweeted.
Stay away from the eggnog for tonight
If you mean v0rtex-s then it is almost the same. And afaik the i7/+ offsets are the same as v0rtexnonce 
Isnt nonceset112 for <=11.1.2 only?
And as most of 7+ users (me included) say, they can't get v0rtexnonce to work
I don't get v0rtexnonce to work. Tried over 20times in a row and had to stop bc my battery was about to die
As of now, it isn't possible. But maybe someone finds a method of setting nonce permanently when the jailbreak drops

There are plenty of tutorials on how to use it. Search for one suitable for your phone
Try vmware
I get exploit failed, a white screen (lasts forever) or it insta reboots. But I'm not in a hurry right now so its ok.
It keept crashing the last time I checked it. Maybe I should redownload and compile again
Aww , sorry to hear that! I'd like to update both my phone and my S2 so yeah I hope they fix v0rtexnonce OR that there will be a nonce setter in the upcoming 64bit jailbreak
It got worse with the last app update.
Oh didn't notice at first, but yea our struggle is real these days (wanting to update to 11) 😂
Are you on mobile? 
For some odd reason I can't click the link.
Well done r/redditmobile 🙄

Edit: sorry OP wasn't meant to highjack your post!
Sweet girl ya have and adorable to see such a young rebel ;D
I never did that so I can say for sure. 
I mean there wasn't for over 3 years unlike iOS. Like I said you have to trigger the update by using the watch app. And even then you must have it on a charger so there is more than 1 moment to back out of an unwanted update process 
I get that but why? You will still be able to pair it with your phone? And as long as you don't click update in the watch app it will not update on its own.
At least my S2 didn't and is still running 3.1.3 
Why is that a problem? Serious question.

Edit: your phone wont update the watch to a version it wouldn't support.
TL;DR
As of now there is no way to set nonce on >=11.2

This won't help for newer devices with A8 or higher (i6 and up) as their SEP (the chip that handles touchid etc) will not work on older firmwares.
Just search for SEP, downgrade and blobs in this sub
Jesus... 
Listen wheneta kid. People like you are the reason why:
A) devs leave this scene and 
B) this sub gets more and more toxic
 And putting 10 question marks at the end of your question won't help you in the slightest.

No
I'm running vmware on my "shitty" laptop and I found that running ONLY vmware and once it's booted (takes a while) it runs surprisingly good.
However good luck with whatever route your going!
I don't know then. If you have the time to hand I would suggest to try out vmware as I see many people having issues with virtualbox in the past.
I used vmware.
The problem is most likely that your phone is "plugged in" into your host system and not tunneled to your guest (vm). Search for a unplug from host option. Or google it
"Unplug from host" in the bottom right (iphone icon).
Can take a few tries
Delete your phone through find my iPhone. 
But thats resetting not restoring
Please do :)
It seems that - besides the yalu 10.1.1 - we i7/+ users are kinda fucked in almost every situation regarding jailbreaking.

Edit: my only hope in case we don't get a working v0rtexnonce is that we can set nonce with a 10.3.x jailbreak and 11.2.1 is still signed then
Same here. Exploit failed, insta crash or white screen. 
7+ GSM 10.3.1
Not even in theory.. A fresh 10.x install on i7 isn't possible as the SEP will NOT be compatible. The only devices that can be downgraded/restored to 10.2-10.3 are A7s.
E: Just a friendly heads up
R/cutereveryloop
Wasn't meant to sound rude, and if it did I apologize. 
It's just that so many get things mixed up in the past few days that it leads to spreading "false" information and in worst case ppl will fuck up their phones.
He is talking about v0rtexnonce which is supposed to work on i7. The only thing that is for A7 devices is a fresh 10.2 or 10.3 install. 

Don't get things mixed up
I wonder if you use any reminder apps like waterminder or local calendar events and encounter the date bug?
If everything fails use find my iphone and delete it. 
[Secure Enclave Processor](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Secure_Enclave) 

Edit: the only devices capable to downgrade to iOS 10 are those with an [A7 chip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_A7#Products_that_include_the_Apple_A7) 
No. As iOS 11 SEP is the only one signed and is incompatible to iOS 10
Open source =/= free to modify and/or redistribute

Why not write some sort of a TL;DR of the  whole threads?


- People who care already read those comments IN context to the rest
- Others will misunderstand them and start to bully devs who may have /be involved in bullying other devs.

Can't set nonce on 11.2 afaik
Tbh I was never jailbroken on iOS 10. I will if I fail to use futurerestore on mac vm. 
However my i6 will remain on iOS 9.3.3 and my 7+ (if futurerestore/vmware doesn't fail) will be and most likely stay on 11.1.2.

I don't exactly know whats the difference between them. I was trying to set nonce to upgrade to 11.1.2
hi, mine is iphone 9.4 (GSM) on 10.3.1.
I've just  started using vm and tbh I don't know what I have to do after finding my offsets. would you mind uploading your ipa? would be much appreciated
Thanks man, same to you! Glad I could help.

Btw I slightly edited my previous comments just to not confuse others. Put in a " *please ignore* " warning.


Omg.. this is getting embarrassing! No worries man, I really should get some sleep!

Yes you chose 7+ GSM 11.1.2 .ipsw

I'm sorry for all the confusion :((
Sorry, my previous answer was a bit confusing - I haven't slept much in the past days🙄 - yeah.. excuses I know 

Edit
However *ignore this part*
> You only need the 7+ 11.1.2 ipsw - as there is only one. Futurerestore will then automatically get the correct baseband for your iphone 9,4. 
Got that mixed up. 

Jeez I tell you, with every year that goes by jailbreaking gets more confusing. Or I'm just getting to old for it .. who knows.
Good night, I show myself out.
Should be a GSM model.
You can check here though: 
[https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Models](https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Models) 

Edit: after that check tsssaver homepage and search for your iphone x,x to verify your model

E2: *please ignore*
> No, ipsw doesn't matter. Just the baseband as there are 2 different chipsets


Between 10 to 20 tries. 
It will insta reboot / fail exploit on my 7+ on 10.3.1.
Am I doing something wrong?

Edit 
Also on Win10 (had no mac/vm and wanted to try) Cydia Impactor gave me this error:
> --------------------------- Error ---------------------
plist.hpp:201 not PLIST_STRING <dict>
<key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
<string>xyz.xninja.v0rtexNonce</string> </dict>[Status]
--------------------------- OK    ---------------------------

Edit2: sorry for that format cancer - I'm on mobile and it seemed fine :/
Insta crash or "exploit failed" on app start - 7+ 10.3.1
V0rtexNonce keeps crashing my 7+ (10.3.1) as soon as I start the app.

What provider has TIM as "carrier tag" in germany?


E: the only provider that comes to mind would be Telecom Italia Mobile -> TIM - but that is obviously not german :)
As long as you have 11.1.2 blobs I'd say it would. Just take the right version of baseband as there are two versions of i7/+ -> GSM and international
I'm sorry but thats not possible w/o blobs for 11.1.2
I don't think so as 10.3.3 isn't signed for 7/7+ meaning the SEP isn't compatible 
Whats the difference between the SEP from 11.2 and 11.2.1? 

Edit: did you encounter the date bug? If not, do you use any local reminder apps like waterminder or calendar events that could trigger it?

FTFY
Like I said before, I didn't mean to sound rude.
Some people just don't know saurik.com even exists. Sometimes it's just easier to ask in a forum or subreddit where you know there's people that know their stuff as to google for hours. I'm not saying thats the case here, and I get your point of it being annoying at times.

Saurik - unlike other devs - has always pointed out why he made it closed source. So why not provide that info? 
Isn't this sub supposed to share information and not telling people to "deal with the way it is" when they perhaps wanna get some in depth info?

Isn't that what we call a fork?
Thats like saying: Because it is. 
No offense by any means But why not provide some info explaining WHY it is?
Taken from [saurik.com](http://www.saurik.com/id/22) - read all (recommended even if it's old) or scroll down to "Open Source is not enough"

> The central reason is that we have already seen others come in and use an embrace-and-extend strategy on Substrate in order to build a totally-closed ecosystem: that was Rock Your Phone, with their Rock Extensions. People always think back to Rock 2.0, which was a reasonable "Cydia competitor" that supported APT repositories; but the mission of Rock 1.0 was to build a siloed, commercial-first (if not even commercial-only: I was told by them I should sell Cycorder, which had been free) store.

> The reason why Rock got forced to support APT repositories (which became Rock 2.0) was that iOS 3.1 required some major reimplementation work on Substrate, and I made the project closed source. This meant that for Rock's software to operate, they needed access to a legitimate copy of Substrate, and their strategy for doing that was to support APT repositories and then just download it in the same manner as Cydia. A world where Rock 1.0 became the core ecosystem would be a world very unlike the one we have.

I did try to run sierra on vmware but it lags the hell out of my laptop. 
I would give it a try with linux (vm) but have no clue how to compile things to get them working on linux.
My 7+ is on 10.3.1 rn but I'd like to update mainly to get my watch to watchOS 4. Are there any tutorials to achieve this with a linux vm (incl compiling things) instead of sierra - sierra lags the shit out of my laptop to the point I can hardly move the cursor
Is there any chance to get a tutorial for this doing it on a linux vm? 
Did you update before or after dec, 2nd?
There is [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/7kx6pp/tutorial_today_i_upgraded_my_6s_from_102_yalu_to/?st=JBEF4RLT&sh=05e66d5c) that says you needed a mac bc it won't work with a virtual machine.

Can anyone confirm this?

Edit: if so rip windows users
with the latest 11.2.5 beta out, did anyone check if the SEP is compatible?

E: Thing is I would like to update to 11.1.2 so I could finaly update my watch to watchOS 4. So it would suck to miss another signing window. I'm not stressing to update, but on the ohter hand I'm a little hestitant because of the date bug that all where talking about a while ago and I can't find confirmed info if it's still affecting ppl or not
Slightly off topic:

1. How is the perfomance of 11.1.2 on a 7+?
2. Did you encounter the date bug while on 11.1.2 (did a post where I asked this but sadly it got removed)
> NOTHING WORSE than waiting possibly months to a year for another JB to drop..

Would like to know too: 7+ on 10.3.1 here. 
What about pure aroma, will they be taxed?

A little addition
(feel free to correct me on part I got wrong instead of downvoting. that way we all learn something)

- Like you said: There are not more risks than on PC.
If you don't download everything you come across and have some common sense you should be fine.
- You must have openSSH enabled to be vulnerable to be "hacked" via wifi. But hardly anyone runs the service 24/7
- You don't need a jailbreak to sideload. There is a tool called Cydia Impactor that does this on unjailbroken phones. Also as long as you don't have r/w on / there is ALMOST no problem in sideloading apps as they are sandboxed.
- Cydia is indeed the most popular AppStore alternative but there are trusted repositories (aka sources) to install from. Pirating on the other hand.. you have to decide if its worth the risk. Like I said before, a bit of common sense and you're good to go.
Not just architecture tbh
TIL looking modern = looking boring
Freedom unit ... smh
It went wheelie rong
!remindme 6 years
I wasn't gonna count them all tbh. And I don't think that any researcher HAS to make an exploit public.

Pandora and pangu however are backed by alibaba and some company I can't remember from the top of my head. 


We're talking about two different things here. Money being one of them, the other is the fact that those jailbreak devs they hired - at least for what I know - always released there tools (iphone dev team just to mention one)
But I get your point
I don't think they can do much with that version of cydia as substrate is closed source. But it is a poc to be able to install it
But wouldn't that also kill your reputation in the long run if you dont share these exploits with apple and instead sell them to "private" companies?
So there shouldn't be any incompatibility between a rewritten substrate for ios 11 and ios 10?
I'm jailbreaking since 1. Gen ipod/ iphone 3g but it never felt so confusing since the introduction of SEP and especially the i7=< hardware
r/perfecttiming
idk then
I have a question for those on 11.1.2:

Do you guys encounter the date bug that crashes/freezes your phones? Did you up-/downgrade before or after dec, 2nd?
Maybe sideloaded
Weird. All I read about this bug is that it starts after dec, 2nd. Maybe it won't affect a phone when 11.1.2 is installed after dec, 2nd?
Do you still encounter the date bug? 
Calm down and just use ^/s next time mkay?
I think the nostalgia part is how they are/were made. Somewhere in the comments one user said that instead of frying the bake them now. So the crusty outside isn't as crusty as it was before. 
OP, correct me if I'm wrong.
Just enjoy your new piece of apple hardware and calm your boobies.
Why even bother reading the article?! Lets just all cry wen eta and annoy the fuck out of good devs so they leave this snapcancer-community.
Kids these days....
No offense but tbf, thats just another panicky what should I do comment. 
Stay as they won't release an exploit or a jailbreak. 11.2.1 just got released, so apple won't unsign it for a couple of weeks. Chances are better on 11.1.2.
I think the most important question would be: will there be someone trustworthy as saurik working on rewriting cydia/substrate? 
The reason for my statement is the fact saurik said he isn't really interested in rewriting substrate
r/okami would like this
That sounds delicious!

For the lazy on mobile
To be honest I misread that as "number one has a proof". 
That was just an example bc you said you saved blobs since 10.3.1. On the other hand we don't know how stable the first iOS 11 jb would be compared to an also yet to come 10.3.1 jb.
If the iOS 11 one has the same issues as yalu when it first came out I would guess I rather be on a hopefully stable 10.3.1 jb.

In the end, all I said is just speculations
The problem would be SEP and/or baseband. As you theoretically can downgrade with blobs, iTunes would still use the signed SEP and baseband which (in your case going from 11.x to say 10.3.1) would break your TouchID. 
Yummy 
Sauce? 

E: The reason I'm asking for a source is [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/7jailk/comment/dr4w1vt?st=JB584YUD&sh=2afbc150) 
Not to sound rude, but if it isn't a known dev to confirm that I won't bet a single cent on what that guy said in his post.
Ian Beer tweeted 11.1.2 and lower so I'm guessing everything from 11.1 -> 11.1.2 should work, but don't quote me on that as he didn't confirm this yet. 
If you are on 11.1 just update to be safe. If not decide for yourself.
As always, some exploits only work for certain versions. 
Not thats this is the case but just as explanation: if an exploit works for lets say 11.1, Apple could have changed something in that version that wasn't even there in version 11.0.2. 
So the mentioned exploit wouldn't work for anything lower than 11.1. There is no given downward compatibility.
Is it just me or does the aspect ratio of the iphone in the back looks weird

That may be true as I didn't translate the site. However I was referring to the webmail itself which doesn't seem to work. Try clicking "sign up" or "forgot your password"
Sidenote: It also states "powered by load" but if you try to reach www.load.com you will land on Gmails login page. The linked page corporate.load.com doesn't even exist.
I guess they shut it down on March 31, 2008
"Saved 6 times between March 25, 2004 and March 31, 2008"

Just a little nostagia post while we're waiting for the new album:

The service was run on eminem.com/webmail but I couldn't find any infos to when it was shut down. Must have been mid 2000. If you google it you'll find a "rip off" version of the original page where I took this screenshot.

I lost several messenger and other mail accounts due to the fact that I used my @eminem.com mail as backup account for forgotten passwords.
However I got some nice reactions telling my friends my email adress.

I wonder if anyone else used to use it.

How are the chances that staying on 10.3.x will fuck us over when 11.2s SEP isn't compatible with 11.1.2?
Too bad ian beer is no jb developer so no jb will come from him. Just saying 
I think the i7 users are the ones to cry tbh. The other ones just got their phones and we never got a jb that quick after a release iirc
Why?
dang it, so I'm in the same situation as I was when jumping from 10.1 to 10.3.1
iirc the sep didn't change from 10.2 to 10.3.x. Does anybody know if they did in ios11?
Regarding SEP and blobs, would it be possible to update to 11.1.2 with this?
Just in case it still is unclear: if you have a Series 3 Apple Watch and ANY iPhone device on iOS 10 -> 10.3.3 you are not in luck.

No offense by any means. I was just referring to the fact that the "button" itself isn't physical, even if you still can push it physically. 
And don't get me wrong, the fact they removed the home button (besides the notch which is debatable point oc) is one reason for me not to buy the X.
Exacly what I told you in my first comment.. 
No need to tell us AFTER you edited your original post that clearly said SD cards are too expensive. 
On top of that you even referred to it as PS Vita SD card in your first comment BUT PS Vita Memory Card (which is the correct term) in your second comment.

At least put in an "edit:" so ppl know what you edited..

E: Re-phrased a bit
Sorry for being that guy, but the i7 had a home button but it wasn't physical.
I don't know where you buy your SD cards, but your comment implies that you never bought an original Sony Memory Card (c)

Edit: 
Clarification for all downvoters:
He edited the "PS Vita" part in, so his comment only stated that SD cards are way to expensive. 
Besides that sony mem cards are never referred to as SD cards

As far as I understand it, ffz will overwrite the functions of bttv. So there shouldn't be any conflicts that could prevent one plugin from not working properly.
At least I never really encountered one
It isn't, the tiger just burped in that moment
True, I was just curious bc the guy posting the stickers even put it in the title that he wants it to be public. So I assumed that maybe ppl would even contact him via pm to get the layout for the stickers. 
However the rest makes absolutely sense.
It didn't feel like it would slow down firefox on twitch significantly while using both plugins. 
And why should I use the ffz addon (bttv emotes that is) when I already got bttv installed? Or do you mean using the ffz addon and disable bttv?
I'm aware of that. Was using both for a long time. Also you can disable certain features to work better with bttv.
In the end it's personal preference
It has been released (beta). The bttv emote pack isn't really needed if you're going to use it alongside bttv
Yeah thats what I was thinking, but i wasn't sure if the script actually had to be rewritten as well or if it just loads off the plugin.
E: noticed that after seeing 2 icons at the top after updating the plugin.
May be a dumb question but why censor it in the first place?
Is it just me/the angle or is one support slightly higher than the other?
is there a way to just make chat (api) messages like subs english? the translation sucks balls

i just noticed that at least the user script for frankerfacez is back. it isn't located under the chat but instead i have it at the top right. just noticed that a few moments ago.

Tl;dr - delete patch/dlc folder and transfer them again via ftp/wifi. Refresh Livearea and you should be good to go.

Are you using a sd2vita?
If so, you probably transferred the files with the sd in your computer which for some reason "corrupts" them. Try to open the folder/files of your DLC in Vitashell. If it gives you a error, delete the folder through your computer (won't work directly on your vita) and transfer them via FTP/Wifi.
Same thing goes for Patch data. 
I can't explain why this happens, but after putting patch folders in the right place it still told me I was using version 1.0 of whatever game it was. Plus vitashell could not open the folder/files.

Or use AccountSwitcher. Afaik there are more files needed than just act.dat to have your vita activated. But I could be wrong. Said app backs up act.dat, id.dat, system.dreg and system.ireg
True. I just thought of a perm-fix. 

Correct me if I'm wrong, but if it did that you wouldn't be able to rejailbreak again.

I remember that there was a fix on cydia to close the tiff/pdf (or whatever it was) bugs that were exploited in the first place. 

But like I said before since henkaku (unlike enso) must be run after each reboot I don't think henkaku fixes that bug.

tl;dr
r/catsareassholes ;)
sounds weird.. did you also check if your config.txt is correct? (Added gamesd under *KERNEL, no typos in path etc)

If you haven't already installed/transfered too many games I'd suggest to redo the whole sd2vita process (deleting sd2vita files you copied to your vita and format your sd. Pay attention to how it gets formated - allocation size or how it's called)

If that doesn't work you can still reset your vita to factory settings and use henkaku to install enso.
But do yourself a favor!!:
If your vita was activated PLEASE backup your account data with AccountSwitcher and save those files somewhere on your pc. You'll find them at ux0:data/AccountSwitcher/your_profile
What a happy little accident :)
Your vitashell install should be fine then. 

If you mount your sd2vita as ux0 (via gamesd.skprx) there should be (at least for me) another tai folder on your sd card. If you can't access it on your vita try it on a pc. 

Last thing i could think of is to check if you put the files in the correct location and used the right gamesd file.

Hope you can get it to work
r/notmyjob
r/stoppedworking and r/whatswrongwithyourdog comes to mind
Did you delete/move the config from ux0:tai? 

What do you mean by transferred vitashell to ur0? Moved the files or reinstalled? 

There is no need to move vitashell in the first place - you can however remove/revert your changes (using only your internal storage without sd2vita) and install directly to ur0

I just release (push down) my sd card and pull it out at a slight angle so the sd catches on the adapter and voila!

I'm really running out of possible solutions :(

Edit: before formating your sd: is your mem card inserted? If so try to remove it otherwise try it vice versa


You could try and reformat your sd card. Just copy over system files/folders (no game folders) to your sd and redo the wololo tutorial. There was a tutorial on reddit to setup a sd2vita w/o the use of a sony mem card. Im on mobile but I'll try to search it. Maybe that could help.


As it was said before: Since we cant dl them anymore and there already is a huge amount of psp isos from back then, adrenaline should be your choice.


Just reinstall vitashell (or any other app it says its corrupted) and you should be good to go. A reinstall adds the needed lines in your config.txt which I'd backup somewhere just to be save.
I set up my sd as ux0 and my memory card as uma0.
Could it be you took the wrong gamesd.skprx? 

Speaking of mounting: i got some minor problems mounting my sd card as uma0, but as soon as i changed that to ux0 everything worked fine.

The reason to move/copy your tai folder is the config file with all plugins installed in it.

I love the 4x4 layout in folders. To bad my 7+ isn't jailbroken. I still cant understand why Apple didn't make this an option for the plus in the first place 

(resubmitted for the bot - hope it works this time)
I know this works for ps4 (hit square iirc) but for some reason it won't on my vita. Could this be a firmware issue (>3.60)?

Late on this one but I hope it still helps.
I highly recommend you [the youtube video in this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearpeopledie/comments/6w3548/titanic_final_distress_transmissions/) (50-ish minutes long)
Except this is 100+ years old and wasn't started on Reddit. But I get your point

E: forgot the +
Watched the whole thing. It's hard to imagine how those radio operators must have felt. Does anyone know why the frankfurt kept asking "what's the matter?"

E: typo
E2 regarding the frankfurt: On one hand there could have been some language barriers between the Frankfurt and the Titanic, on the other I learned that there was a good amount of prank messages sent on radio in those days. 
Not really. But I thought the same at first
lol I didn't even see that.
tbh with you.. I really don't know. What's the difference between them?

E/ google didn't help.. result where unclear. However my washing machine goes crazy right now...

My adapter is mounted as ux0 and (besides the fact I have too many games installed and can't read properly in maidump) it works perfectly fine.
Have you ever installed something on a mc or ur0? Or switched accounts?
Assuming you want to install dumped games: Just get vitashell and install from there.

Edit: [Here](https://nicoblog.org/guides/nicoblogs-ps-vita-general-guide) is a good tutorial. Just go right to point "VII"
Hope this helps
