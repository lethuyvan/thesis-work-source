Since they're on your student account, the registrar's office will probably hold your diploma until it's paid. If for whatever reason you don't pay it they'll likely just send it to the Maryland Collections Agency at some point.

What the FUCK did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo.

LOL this comment right here, I can't fucking upvote it enough

Never again for University Club. No matter how much I tell people my horrible experiences and warn people the lower price is not worth it, people will still go, sadly. 

/u/Miseryy  - Yes, word of mouth is a powerful thing...but with a school of 30,000 students, I doubt your word of mouth is going to reach a significant amount of people...there's a reason why these complexes don't have a problem filling up fast.

And like I said - college students are the perfect tenet group to take advantage of.  We don't have the time or money to fight back. University Club practically stole our $150 security deposit - we were in a unique situation where they didn't apply our deposit to our "damages" upon moving out (this of course, was after sending this list of damages to us 2 months later - which was supposed to be sent within 45 days according to PG county tenet laws... and of course, they sent it straight to collections)... and our only recourse was to sue. I could go on, but after a court summons that couldn't be delivered (yes - you can ignore a court summons when it's sent via registered mail!) we just decided to give up because we didn't have another $30 to refile with the court and couldn't make time to travel the  40 minutes to the courthouse. 

It's fucked up, plain and simple. They treat us like actual garbage and like I said, they don't give a shit - and like I jokingly pointed out - why should they? God only knows how many more people were in my situation (or a similar one) with University Club or any of these places.

The student taught 1 credit courses that were introduced last semester (or whenever) also count for this as well (so in terms of advising they're basically the same as the winter courses).

Not sure what your situation is but you can take 1 in the fall, 1 in the winter and 1 in the spring and knock out an upper level course elective by next spring if that helps you (winter courses are per credit and expensive I think)

It's ironic in light of the original commenters response. Lowering the drinking age was supposed to lower (underaged) drunk driving (and as you pointed out, it did) however with the commentors response above it seems now that the lowered age has created an unexpected response that's  coincidentally the complete opposite of expected response of raising the drinking age. 


Ironically enough, wasn't underage drunk driving one of the main reasons why MADD lobbied for the raise to 21?

A lot of it's just policy since they're all pretty much corporate housing conglomerates (or the complex is owned/ran by one). I'm sure they can make exceptions if you really push for it; my room mate and I were able to do this same exact thing when we went to UClub (payed for the rest upfront with no cosigner). Granted, I do not reccomend living at Uclub at all - stay far far far away it's not worth it.

With that being said, checkout independently owned apartments. I think there's a few in oldtown and I think a lot of the knox boxes on hartwick have landlords that are individual people and can probably work with you.

Most people (if they're smart) will probably not do this under the table with you (sublease) since ultimately they're on the hook for your actions. 

> drinking a milkshake with like 2k calories a day 

That's one of those things that sounds like a great idea, but you get sick of it real fast and after doing it for 2-3 times you start to hate it. 

Also a 2kcal milkshake is pretty hefty, damn.


Former FC student here, I did it 2 years ago, and it seems that they've only improved the program since then.

1.) Already answered by the other guy - classes are just later in the day or on off days for some departments (like Fridays).

2.) You're guaranteed housing and are placed all over campus (or this was the case when I did FC two years ago). If you do decide to do this and to live on campus, I would advise selecting only traditional dorms as your option. You're given the option on your housing forms to say hey I wouldn't mind living in a traditional, suite or apartment style dorm. I included apartment in mine and that year they put a bunch of FC students in Leonardtown, which wasn't that fun since it's so far away (had a nice room though). I ended up making friends with people in other dorms so it wasn't a problem, but I still wouldn't recommend it as a freshmen. 

With that being said, back to my first point, it seemed that Freshmen connection students were thrown all over the place in terms of housing. One of my now best friends who was also in FC lived in Cumberland, which is in the Cambridge community and he lived with people who were in the scholars programs who typically live in that building (I think his roommate was FC though). I also met others who were in Hagerstown, Ellicot, even on the mall in Queen Anne's. 

3.) Yeah the choices are 'limited' since you don't have the option of every class offered, but there are a lot of classes offered and a few classes only offered to freshmen connection students (I'd recommend the stocks class with Dr. Wish if he's still offering it). Also, it used to be that you couldn't take major related classes with FC, but now majors are offering FC intro class sections - like 131, which is the first CS class you'll take and is being offered to FC students this year, and it's taught by Nelson who is one of the best CS professors.

4.) I don't remember exactly in regards to financial aid, but i'm almost positive it's the same (barring scholarships and stuff). I remember the tuition was a little cheaper, however that might be my memory or if it is true, it's because they were only offering non-major related classes.

5.) sure go for it

Dear lord that place is awful and not worth the cheap price
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer‚Äôs head. There‚Äôs also Rick‚Äôs nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they‚Äôre not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn‚Äôt appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick‚Äôs existential catchphrase ‚ÄúWubba Lubba Dub Dub,‚Äù which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev‚Äôs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I‚Äôm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon‚Äôs genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ

And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It‚Äôs for the ladies‚Äô eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they‚Äôre within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid üòé

> Buy meat on sale and/or in bulk

Yup. Typically most local supermarkets have some type of meat on sale per week. You can start there, but keep watching the ads, you'll probably notice a trend - sometimes stuff goes on sale for a lot lower sometimes. That's when you stock up and buy a bunch and freeze it all.

Every once and a while my supermarket has chicken thighs on sale for ~.69 a pound and I buy a bunch, eat some for that week, and then freeze the rest and am set until the next time they go on sale.

Oh man, I remember in a Chipotle a few years ago there was this family and their small kids were playing will all the plastic silverware that's left out by the drink machine so people can eat their food. Their parents didn't seem to care at all. It was fucking nasty, I can only imagine where those kids hands could have been and they were literally groping items that are enter other people's mouths. And they didn't completely destroy the area either, they put everything back so it's not like it was a complete mess and somebody would realize that 2 small children rubbed their hands all over it.

Anyway, I remember seeing that while I was on the line and I remember a guy just getting up and yelling at the parents to let them know how gross that is.

Sad, but it makes a great 'what challenge have you overcome' college admissions essay, but not good enough for UMD. He also applied early action at midnight when the applications first opened up, so it's not like he was late either.

tl;dr - sorry op, hope you applied to some safe schools

do you even sudoku?
Very easy (search for millson on this subreddit), and the only previous knowledge I had was the combinatorics from 250 (which was just one poker question on the first exam). Quizzes every week are 1 of the 5-6 homework problems Millson assigns. The first exam was very similar to every other exam millson has given, and if you understood any of the quizzes then you're more than fine. I also have not been to any lecture so far except for the first day (I just read the parts from the book to do the HW every week, any updates are from the 2 people in the GroupMe who actually go to lecture) - Millson is a pretty awful lecturer and you'll be more confused if you go to class. And this is coming from a guy who goes to class no matter what - Millsons is the first and probably only class that I actually never go to.

  If you actually want to learn stats, than take someone else (or be prepared to teach yourself everything). If you just want to get your stats requirement out of the way, then take Millson.

Don't stare at the projects for hours - if you're stuck like that it's just a waste of time.

One of the thing that worked for me was to read the project right away and if I couldn't think of a solution right away, I'd just let it sit in my mind for a day or day, thinking about it randomly. Putting it on the back burner was key in a lot of break thoughs in doing the projects. Whenever I got stuck, I'd let it sit for a day.  This sounds dumb, but I'm a total  believer in your subconscious doing a lot of work - that was grinded into my mind from standardized test prepping ("think about it, skip it and go back if you don't know right away!") and after reading some stuff from Malcom Gladwell.

Obviously this is situational - this won't work if you start the project the day before it's due.

Not that that's a bad thing. If I was single I'd love a cozy studio like this.
>You get a true UNIX system meaning it has a command line environment that is standard issue for development work, without the hassle of maintaining a Linux install.

This is pretty spot on. I've been fortunate enough to have a Macbook Pro provisioned to me for my job I've been working for since my sophomore year (I'm allowed to use it for school work and stuff). Development on UNIX is so much smoother (really helpful in 216 compared to windows friends it seemed). I'm also going to say that the macbook has a really nice build quality compared to most other laptops I've owned, but I guess you get what you pay for.

However, I still really hate everything else about macOS - being integrated with iTunes (i.e. having to make an apple account to update your OS is goofy, also I don't want to use icloud stop having me sign in thanks) and the UI is clunky (TO ME) and I still hate navigating on it despite using it for almost 2 years now - these are the things that make me hate it. This coupled with price, I'd personally never buy a macbook.

>dual-booting Windows/Linux on my XPS 13.

Personally, this honestly is the way to go, minus the Windows part. If I were shopping for a new laptop, I would do some research and see what laptops have good linux support. One of the worst things I've dealt with regarding linux is driver support, even with popular distros like Ubuntu (womp womp). There are mainstream laptops out now that even come with Ubuntu installed (actually I think there's an XPS version) however they're usually branded as 'develop3r' editions and usually more money (kind of paradoxical if you think about it), but that's a good place to start - then you know that laptop line probably has good linux support.

So yeah. Not sure if I helped you OP, but if you were a windows user all your life and have never had a mac before, I'd somehow try it out before dropping a lot of dosh on it because you may find out you don't like it (like I did, however I was fortunate enough not to have to drop dosh for it - this may not be the case though, I have a coworker who was the complete opposite and now only uses apple products). Next time I purchase a laptop, I'm going to do what I describe above because windows runs like ass on laptops and I hate macOS.

tl;dr macs are cool but expensive, however i hate macos and you might as well so maybe just think about getting a regular laptop and putting linux on it because windows is ass too (but it sounds like you already know)

read mount's 251 notes, and then read CLRS if you still have questions (Mount's notes are pretty much the highpoints from the relevant CLRS sections and follows the book closely)

I've noticed golub so far has followed these notes, even some of the examples we goes over in class are straight from Mount/CLRS (which I've noticed is a good and a bad thing - good if you missed golub explaining it, but it sucks when you're just trying to find another example)

>his slides were always to supplement and cannot replace his lecture

Yeah, I understand that - I just wish he would post the write ups he does in lecture along with the slides (which is what I assume the password protected items are from the 2016 351 page).

Otherwise, I really don't mind Golub, in fact I actually kind of like his lectures. I can understand why others don't like him though (I don't think I'd want to take a lower level class like 131 or 132 with him).
that was my favorite lamp :(

As others have stated, most of the recruiting starts up in a few months. However, I just got an e-mail from a recruiter from a company that recruits a lot of my compass saying they're doing early interviews for full time positions for new grads for the next school year if you're interested now - so some companies may be starting to think about it.
thanks!!! thankfully I have another year before I really have to start worrying about a full time job (graduating next may), however the grind is already starting!

3.) you can pay with terrapin express but they also take credit cards at the machine themselves

I bought a pack of steaks from Costco once. Went to cook one the next day and the meat had already gone bad. My roommate said we should return it and I didn't believe it. ..what store let's you return food products? Coupled with the fact that we only go to Costco once or twice a month, so it was another 10 days or so since we went back and tried to return them. They took the steaks with no question.


I agree that we shouldn't be arming teachers, and guns should not be allowed on school grounds, however you're reading the thread wrong.

The OP is saying they want to give permission to teachers to conceal carry on school grounds under the assumption that they already have a gun and a permit - not mandating or forcing in anyway. Currently, as you are aware, this is not legal on school property (although some states have specific rules,or lack there of which allow this, in specific cases, i.e. off duty police officers).

In regards to 'volunteering to act as a school shooter stopper' - if they already have a concealed carry permit and they frequently conceal carry a handgun, chances are they're ok with using the gun and defending themselves (or others) if need be. Or maybe I'm missing the point - for what  other reason would you conceal carry for? Just for giggles? There's also nothing about requiring them to carry mentioned - even if a teacher in this case had a permit and a gun they wouldn't be forced to carry it with them when they go to work (or at least that's how the OP reads).

Like I said, I don't believe this is the correct way of solving this problem. I don't think guns belong in schools barring police officers. However your comment is extremely misconstrued and you are not helping this debate.


There's only one track/tunnel planned?

I managed to accidently kick my student ID underneath a deadlift platform in my University gym last night. Went to pick it up, somehow kicked it and zoop it went right under. 

I asked the only girl who was working there (it's a small weightroom) if she's ever had anything like this happen before and she says no, so she gets a laminted piece of paper and tries to help me fish it out from under the platform. I try lifting the platform but don't give it much effort since I think it's bolted down.

At this point there's only two other people in the gym, coincidentally my two gym nemesises (they workout together). She gets up and asks them to lift up the platform and they did, and I was able to shamefully get my ID card back, defeated by both my gym nemesies and the deadlift platform.

Probably because all the usual gorey stuff is very outlandish and seems almost surreal; however since I'm just a few years out of high school this hit very hard like nothing I've seen before. And I didn't even watch the worse stuff on LiveLeak.

You do you, OP. Sometimes people forgot we're in college and (gasp) adults. 
To be honest, it shouldn't /matter/ what OP dresses or sounds like. Nobody should be called a derogatory term in public for any reason unless you're acting like a total jackass. 

Dressing (or sounding) like a 'faggot' (as you put it) shouldn't warrant harassment - let people do what they want as long as it doesn't bother you, right? 

I'm sorry this stuff is happening to you though, OP.

If they don't let you consider this:

You already know the content of the intro courses and your resume reflects that (assuming they're software engineer positions and you want to be one) why even bother going for the CS minor if it's going to be a hassle and set you back another year? Maybe if you were going for a CS major this would be more of a deal, considering at best "Computer Science minor" is going to take up 3 words on your resume and most people won't even give a shit, especially since you have the experience. 

 For any 3xx or 4xx class that you want to take you can just audit the course.

Same, I really enjoyed the movie. I thought it did scary very well as it managed to be very creepy and suspenseful without any jump scares. Also you're right, the payoff was great - I was getting worried halfway through because this film did the whole "don't show the monster fully" technique really well throughout it, and typically when movies do that the payoff is awful and/or the CGI is really bad, however I thought the last 20 minutes of the film were really satisfying and the creature was cool.

And yeah, it was genuinely funny at some parts, too. I think that's another thing - these characters were totally believable and relatable (I could picture myself and 3 other friends in the woods acting like this), which is something that doesn't happen too often in creepy films. 
So it goes.
What's even scarier about Unit 731 is how little there is on it when researching on the internet (as compared to say, Mengele's experiments).

I truly think a lot has been lost since then, or it's just not known.

oh man, this post makes me nostalgic for some reason, it reminds me of my last class of the day for the spring semester (we had block scheduling) my senior year of high school (at which point I had already committed to UMD) - calculus. 

I wish I could give you a count of many shits I gave for that class, but that's a trick question because I didn't give any. I'll never forget walking into that class everyday and laughing at Magnus's awful jokes and barely learning how to derive functions (I think that's the only thing I actually learned). 

My first final I ever failed was in that class, oh man, I remember the night before going "you know, I should at least look at my notebook," and I didn't - I said I would just flip through it tomorrow morning before the final started. And I woke up that morning, said to myself "in 2 hours, I'll never have to think about high school ever again" (only had that final that day, and it was my last one), and I didn't even flip through my notebook. I can't even remember a single thing on that final exam right now (nor could remember any calculus while taking it) but oh man I did not give two fucking shits.

I remember getting my transcript, saw that I had an F on the final exam (our transcripts showed our final exam grades) and somehow I got a B in the class (or maybe a C, who cares though).

Then my freshmen year I got tag teamed by MATH140 and MATH141 because I didn't learn shit from calculus in high school.

But it was so worth it, just to feel that feeling of freedom for once in my life. Moral of the story: don't take it for granted, because you'll be a senior in college and you might be in the same situation, however going from school to work feels different than going from high school to college. Also, to answer your question. they never asked for my mid semester grades and the general consensus is as long as you pass and don't get (too many?) D's you're good. have fun

Just so you don't think you're crazy - there actually is a cyber security major, however it's only offered online at UMUC...back when I applied to UMD, I did the same thing and when I called admissions to ask questions that's what they said. I'm assuming it's still that way and I'm not sure why it's an option when you apply for the College Park campus (and I'm guessing it still is if it allowed you to pick it as your major).

Still don't understand how that means you're guility until proven innocent. How is that different from a majority of other court cases in the United States? 

If I get taken to court for murder and there's evidence against me, if I can't prove my innocence and then there's more proof given that I did do it, and so presumably I'd be guilty. I get where you're coming from I think - if I truly didn't commit the crime then I'm shit out of luck (compared to a professor bringing proof against someone cheating). Unfortunately that's just how the justice system works here, it has it flaws - and the honor stuff here seems to be modelled after the same way to a degree, so the same faults will apply. Yeah I guess I can see why you'd be upset about that or anyone else, and if you feel that way then voice your concern through the appropriate mediums.

Also there are cases in which the professor brings in proof and the honor board doesn't even go with the case because it's BS (search around the sub Reddit).

My friend got me a Jcrew sweater for my birthday (in December), and it was a little big but I said I'd try to shrink it. Finally got around to it and I don't think it's gonna shrink to the size I want.

i wish it was somehow centralized, i.e. if you live in a state all your life and then decide to go to school in a different state, you have to pay out of state tuition, but what happens to all the taxes you paid to your state in the 18 years you were living there? 
I'm confused, can you explain how the person is considered guilty right off the bat? It's not like the professor refers you and then you're instantly punished. You are accused with proof and have the chance to defend yourself.
Not really? I thought to be reported to the Office of Student conduct the professor needs some type of proof.

Then the burden of proof is on you to prove you're not guilty.

Not sure where the train drops you off in Chicago or even where the airport is, but isn't one of the appeals of taking a train the fact that you get dropped off typically right in the middle of the city?

Train stations are usually in the middle of the city while the airports are just outside the city and you still need to travel from the airport to the city

LaTeX gives you complete control over the document in a format that's very easy to learn. I'm sure you could get the same amount of control with a word processor like Word, but that sounds like a pain in the ass (i.e. messing with bullets/lists and spacing in word is a lot more work than typing a few things in latex for the same result).

Also for what it's worth I dont use LaTeX for my resume, so I'm not a shill - but I don't think it's correct at all to say "there's no point in making your resume in latex"

Admissions forwarded it the school's legal office and they said that the only documents they had for me was all the stuff that I had submitted with my application (so my essay, transcripts, recommendations, etc). I'm guessing once you're in the school they get rid of all the admissions related stuff on their end

Send an email to Sussman, or whoever is the current undergrad chair.

When I as a Freshmen, back when there was takeout, I got a salad to go and when I went to grab a plastic forks there were none left. So being the nice, young man I am I politely asked the diner worker if they had any more plastic forks.

I forgot what she said but I ended up taking a real fork and then I threw it out after scarfing the salad down, alone by myself in my room.

Sorry man missed your comment. Long comment incoming:

It's a ~20 minute walk to CSIC if you walk slow, 7 minutes or so by bike (which I recommend). I think it's about a mile, pretty much the same from Terrapin Row like I said (never did the actual walk from terp row to CSIC, but I crunched the numbers with google maps). 

Any other class that isn't by CSIC that I have (for example I have a lecture or two in ESJ and a discussion somewhere on the mall), I just take the Enclave bus where the stop is about a 5 minute walk from Monument or a 2 minute bike ride and the bus ride is 10-15 minutes maybe (Although ESJ isn't bad, I'll usually ride my bike to CSIC then walk from there and it's a 15 minute journey. I'm just lazy).

 Before this, I lived in University Club which I couldn't wait to get out of (and was willing to pay more than what I was there). I was looking for somewhere nice, somewhat close to campus, and a place where the management wasn't totally incompetent (shout out to uclub). Originally my roommate and I had a lease at Fuse47, but when I looked out my window at UClub that day when it was on fire, I knew it was gonna be fucked (and it was, RIP Fuse47), so we started looking at other places. No UClub (fuck that place, I kind of wish that place burnt down), Varsity/View we thought was too expensive for what they offered (and I heard they were loud, dirty and the staff were pretty incompetent). We looked at Terrapin Row and I honestly thought it was the same as view or varsity except that they had a squat rack and charged $125 for parking.

Ending up checking out monument village, they were desperate for tenets, we ended up getting a sweet ass corner apartment that is typically ~2700 month for ~2000 month. So for the same price as what we would pay at terrapin row, we get an apartment that is arguably better. Only thing is that Monument village isn't furnished (which too me is a plus, since I wanted to buy my own mattress and desk). 

I like Monument Village because it's quiet (common complaint I hear about terrapin row/varsity), it's clean, and the staff are actually competent!!!  The only two drawbacks that I had compared to the other complexes in downtown college park are the distance and the lack of a squat rack, but I'm able to suck it up.

So, is it worth it? For me, yeah as I said above, but it depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for somewhere quiet, clean and a place where the management treats you like adults, then I'd recommend this place. Also, I'm not a Monument Village shill because if Fuse47 didn't burn down I'd be living there right now and I'd probably be happier (honestly hoping they would be able to rebuild for next year, but I don't even think that's gonna happen in time before I graduate. RIP).
No problem. Yes, once you buy BTC on coinbase (or wherever), transfer them to your hardware wallet. From there, basic computer safety takes precedence since if someone has access to your wallet and your private key (i.e. with a keylogger or RAT, if people still even use those today) then they could empty your wallet out. When you hold your coins with an exchange, you're entrusting them with this step (which, not to discredit coinbase or any other exchange, isn't a good idea).

When you want to 'cash out' with the coins in your hardware wallet, you can send them back to your coinbase account (it will have its own 'wallet address' you can send it to, given to you by coinbase). Then you can 'sell' them to coinbase for USD which you can have deposited back into your bank account.
Not sure why he's being downvoted; bubble talk aside his security concerns are valid. Don't keep your coins on exchanges as they can be stolen (i.e.mtgox, which you've probably heard of). Once you get your coins it's safest to transfer them to your wallet.
>With the upper level concentration requirement, you're basically there anyway.

Uh, not really (for most majors that I know of at least). This is true for some minors (i.e. astronomy, 4 upper levels, a 200 and 101 which you've probably taken already)

Same thing, except my date isn't until Monday. I always thought that upperclassmen were exaggerating when they said the waitlists were bad, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Which really sucks.
Monument Village has comparable prices to terp row and I think it's a lot nicer (and from what I hear about terp row, quieter). I chose to live here this year and I love it. The only major thing is the distance, but if you're an engineering  major it's not that different from traveling from Terp Row. The distance from Monument Village to CSIC is the same as terp row to CSIC, albiet 95% of the walk is on that nature trail that that starts by the Varsity (I know you said EE buildings, but CSIC is pretty close). 

Unfortunately there's no bus service directly to Monument Village (and apparently no plans for one in the near future) so for any other classes that I have on the mall I take the enclave bus which is about a 5 minute walk away.

Let me know if you end up deciding to lease here; I think if I 'refer' you I get some type of bonus and I wouldn't mind splitting it with you.

You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of the sudden you look down and you see an algorithmic interview question. You reach down, and attempt to solve it. The problem lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun beating its legs trying to solve itself but it can't, not without your help, but you're not helping.

Haha yeah, of course, just find it a little funny. Have you ever done an interview using HireVue before?
I feel you, I'm in the same position. Around same stats. Sadly most "athletic" cuts of shirts also slim the arms and chest, so those don't even fit either (but you probably know this).  

Still can't find anything that fits off the rack; which sucks because I don't want to pay to have a $15 JCrew casual button up tailored.

Anybody ever interview with HireVue (the actually company) for an intern position? Suprisngly the first steps are... an interview using HireVue and then a coding challenge. 

Also, I've never actually used HireVue before, what is it like? You just record your responses to questions? Are the coding challenges in the same format as hackerrack?

DAMN SYNTHS
File server for backups, a media server with something like Plex, a game server for smaller games if it's not completely awful. Just to name a few things.
In regards to age of consent, in the US, it's all state dependent; which if you think about it kind of bonkers, especially because a lot of the laws differ wildly between state to state.  

Age of consent is anywhere between 16-18 here, and only *some* states have what we called "Romeo and Juliet Laws" which accounts for minor age differences - i.e. if the age of consent is 18 and you are 19 and your girlfriend is 17, then you could be charged with statuary rape. Romeo and Juliet laws help prevent that with stipulations saying something like "well if you're within 4 years  of each other then it's fine" (obviously I'm not quoting any specific law, but that's the general idea). 

So yeah, the US is a little more conservative in regards to that. In regards to ephebophilia in the US, it's still culturely looked down upon - for example if you're 45 it's very weird for you to be in a relationship with a teenager. In regards to simply being attracted, it's typically looked down upon as well - for example if you were a high school teacher I'm sure you would never admit that you found one of your students physically attractive, but in reality most of the time it's natural and perfectly fine. I guess it really boils down to "age is just a number" because two 15 year olds  of the same gender can look completely different - one could be a late bloomer, and one could be one who looks like a 26 year old because they started puberty earlier.

It's really not a black and white issue, but the age of consent laws here don't account for that and they're pretty cut and dry. The laws here are more meant to prevent sexual grooming and abuse (apparently we all agreed that once you're 16,17, or 18 depending on the state, you're mature enough to sexually decide for yourself) and as a result, being attracted to a teenager is coupled with those things - which is why it's so negatively downplayed in our culture. 

One other thing to think about is how having anything more than a physically attraction to a teenager when you're an adult might be a sign of a lack of ethics (I don't know if that's the right word here). For example, I'm sure there are various adults who find various teenagers attractive, however that does not expand past the physical level because they are able to reason as to why a relationship wouldn't work with that person (different times in life, maturity levels, etc). On the other hand, if someone ignores those reasons then the intention of the relationship becomes purely sexual; in which case it might become a slippery slope for abuse.


So going back to the whole pedophilia vs ephebophilia terminology, here in the US most people just group it with pedophilia because they don't care - in their eyes, it doesn't matter, they're both bad. 

I guess now I'm just rambling because I am procrastinating studying for an exam, but I hope you get some of the points I made. Also thanks for commenting again telling me you updated your post - you're right, I did upvote it before you edited it :)
Who would win? 

One tenured professor who has been researching their respective topic for longer than the average age of the entire class or one smart boi?
Yeah, you're correct. I'm aware it's technically called ephebophilia (since we're all referencing the 14 year old victim). However I think it's colloquial to interchange them (at least in English), probably because many people are unaware of the difference.

Nowadays it seems that the term 'pedophilia' is a blanket term for having attraction to anyone 'underaged.'
Honestly, these allegations didn't surprise me (well maybe the pedophilia one a little bit) because I've read so many stories like yours on the internet before. However I really never took any mind to them because they were all just random posts on message boards that I'd stumble upon in which the person said they knew somebody who worked with Kevin Spacey and confirmed what you said - he's a real dick and he had a thing for younger guys.

So yeah, I never really believed these stories because they weren't credible, however looking back it seems that those stories were probably real.
Taking HIST136 (History of Business in America) this semester with Sicilia; work is minimal and the content is really interesting. Sicilia is also really funny (he's got a real dry sense of humor) and I love his lectures, and the TA for the class this semester is really cool as well.  Not sure if he's teaching it next semester but maybe again next fall, either way I totally recommend it.

Seriously - if you're worried OP just drink a glass of whole milk before bed.
Not OP, but I'm in a similar position with my lifts thanks to a hip injury earlier this year (OHP and bench are way passed the point of adding weight every session) and I've been looking into doing something like this now that I am somewhat able to squat again and deadlift more than 225 without issues.

Could you think of any drawbacks to making a program like this?

Yes, although a lot of profs either cancel class or understand that people travel that week so they don't do any quizzes or anything if that's what you're worried about

If it's later in the day you can always find a classroom. I actually did this in the math building a few weeks ago, albiet my call was at 5pm, so if yours is before 2 or so that won't really work. I think the career center may have rooms specifically for this. You can also always get a study carrel in mckeldin.

Honestly before searching for a place I'd ask them if they could chat with you over Skype or Hangouts so you can use wifi.

Good luck, you got this

The recruiter looked at my Linkedin profile 2 weeks ago so I know they've read my application, but I haven't heard anything from them either...I applied a day or two after the career fair. 

I just noticed a few days ago in the email they sent us after the career fair that they said they'll be on campus the first week of November for interviews. So I figure if we don't here anything from them by the end of this week or start of next, we've probably been denied.

Even then, you can report it lost or stolen to your carrier and have the IMEI blacklisted. Then the phone can't be used as a phone anymore.

I think the controversial part here is that it's just for Amazon, and they're doing it just in an attempt to coerece them.
Just wanted to update you...it turned out to be a voice only interview anyway. Haha. But thanks for the suggestion!
I've only done a few technical interviews so far, but from my experience that's not the case. I mentioned above the hardest part about grading coding exam and quiz questions is determining whether the student made an error because they don't understand what's going on (that's bad), or if they made a stupid syntax error. 

Writing code in an interview is totally different than on an exam - you're explaining your logic as you go (hopefully) and giving the interviewer a full picture as you go. You can't do that on an exam, because the grader is not with you.

For example, let's say you wrote a '=' instead of '==' when comparing two things in a coding interview and you don't even notice - if the interviewer has been paying attention, I'm sure they could deduce if you actually didn't know the difference between an assignment operator and and comparison operator, or if you just made a simple mistake (actually, I'm pretty sure I just watched a Cracking the Coding Interview video where Gayle said the same thing and that's where I'm getting this specific example from). You'd get points off for that in an exam, because the grader can't tell.

 
Losing 40% is a pretty big deal, however I guess it depends on the context of the error (my example probably wasn't a good one). In the grader's defense, it's probably very hard to tell most of the time whether the person made a syntax error or the student actually doesn't understand what's going on.


Don't have any personal experience with this, but just ask your assigned adviser, or whoever you're going to see anyway. Considering both classes cover almost the same content (actually doesn't 461 usually cover a little more than 240?), I don't see why they wouldn't let you add it..
Thanks, this is really cool! I love reading up on the history of stuff at our school (I remember there being a post on here about a class about that, and I've always wanted to take it, but could never find any more info, but I digress) It's really interesting to see major historical events from the perspective of other college students, especially around the Vietnam war. Do you happen to know where I could find the paper from 1971 with the blank pages and tombstones? I looked at the last few papers from 1971 on there and couldn't find it.

Interestingly enough, I just found the paper that was the published on the day of Kent State shootings, where it had a small article talking about how the National Guard was called to Kent State. Next day's paper was all about the havoc on *our* campus (National Guard was on our campus as well) and the 4 dead at Kent State. In fact, they cancelled classes on that day due to the '4th straight day of disturbances' and demonstrations continued and students clashed with police. 

You learn in history class that demonstrations like this happened on college campuses; but when you see articles like this written by students who probably participated in it, and pictures of it on *your* campus, it's kind of surreal. It just feels weird looking at some of these photos of huge mobs of students, police, and tear gas and thinking, "hey, I know where that is! I have a class in that building on Tuesdays!"

For anyone who is interested, here's the two articles:

https://www.lib.umd.edu/univarchives/student-newspapers/id/5f85bef8-3df4-47c9-9705-4c19eea8d524?query=kent

https://www.lib.umd.edu/univarchives/student-newspapers/id/e5236d87-af1c-4b93-a7e3-38537fc88276?query=kent


One of my favorites from those is also, "College Park merchants mourning
money lost from demonstrations" - can you all imagine today the bars getting upset since no one's going out because they're all protesting? lol

..and sometimes they get a little overzealous with taking off points for the syntax (or at least that's how I feel). Yeah, the code I wrote on paper won't compile, but taking off 2 points from a 5 point question sucks when you get all the logic right but you just forgot to put the arguments after calling the function.
Huh, you're right and it's interesting as to why  - according to Wikipedia, Board of Regents cut off student funding after some protesting in 1971.

I had a great discussion with a recruiter at my schools career fair last fall and ended up connecting with him on Linkedin. Unfortunately the company was only looking for upperclassman so he basically told me keep in touch and try again next year.

That company wasn't at our career fair this year, and the company is accepting applications for the position on their website - would it be appropriate to message him before applying on their site and say something like, "Hey we met last year, I got some experience this summer and am still interested in interning with you all next summer. Here's my resume" and then attaching my resume and contact info?

And if I do this, should I apply online first and then message, or just message him first? Am I overthinking this? 
Not sure, but it might be Terrapin Row (only giveaway is the obnoxiously high ceilings), or it could be a house.

I also get this when I do sumo dead sometimes (I think we're talking about the same feeling). Feel it in my foot then it goes all the way up to my leg. Doesn't hurt at all - it's not like sciatica - but it feels a little weird. Hard to describe.

Go. 132 & 216 are more than enough for most internships. I was able to land an internship (and a lot of others) as sophomores with just those classes (not bragging; just providing a data point).

If you're in 330/351 now, you're technically a junior, which a lot of companies look for (most companies aren't interested in underclassman). You go to a pretty reputable school for computer science and unless you're shooting for an internship at Google or Facebook for next summer, or have no interpersonal skills, there's a good chance you can get an internship even though you have little experience.

Go to this one, try to think of an elevator pitch to give to recruiters that sells you in a good light. Maybe something like "Hey I just switched and I'm excited to work in CS, I don't have much professional experience but I've learned x y and z in class so far and I've done a project in class with x y z." - I don't know, but it's all about how you sell yourself. Take notes and observe what the recruiters are looking for, any mistakes you made, etc. After the fair on Monday, evaluate how you did, tweak your elevator pitch if needed. Since you don't have any outside experience, try to start working on a side project or look for a way to get involved (in a technical sense). Then try again at the Spring Career fair. Also, there are hundreds of companies on Careers4terps that will look at your resume just because you're a CS major (someone made a joke comment on this subreddit a few weeks ago saying something like "Go to the career fairs, and you'll end up getting a job at a random company you applied to online" which is so true, because that's what happened to me).

Give yourself a little more credit because you do deserve it, and just go. Like the other guy said you can't can't win if you don't play. I believe in you OP.

They're pretty strict; you're supposed to checkin with the department staff and get a name tag before roaming the floor.

But last year my room mate and I were able to walk on to the floor without running into anybody completely by accident - we weren't sure were they were doing the check in (xfinity is huge).

Does anyone know where I can read up on that Pennywise lore?

Does the book explain how Pennywise came to be? They kind of touched on it in the movie, but it didn't really explain much. Just curious.
This movie doesn't follow the "only creepy things can happen at night" trope very well..
Yup. The setting from this movie almost follows that as well, considering 1989 was 28 years ago. 

Granted, I just looked it up and they filmed the movie in the middle of last year, so technically it's cannon.
Was wondering what was behind that "very scary" door.

Kind of laughed when they [picked the middle one and it turned out to be the right door. Pennywise kind of stopped and had a comical "these damn kids" look on his face.](#spoiler)

That's why a lot of people consider it an 'intermediate' program (or well this reason is at least a small portion of it I'd argue - not to overshadow the weekly progression). With that being said, search around on /r/nsuns - there are a lot of threads asking the question you just asked and a lot of people provided their own routines to inspire those OPs and also various 'cookie-cutter' versions.

Also, there is an accessory check thread there. If I were you, I'd just pick one from one of those threads that's popular or has gotten a stamp of approval from a few different people, and just do it to get started.

The whole point of the accessories on this program - as others have said - are to help address your goals and training needs. Once you get more comfortable you can tailor them yourself to address different goals and/or weakpoints you may have. But to just get started when you're overwhelmed, I'd pick up someone else's routine and reassess in a few weeks you're more comfortable.

It's possible but you have to hustle. My first or second semester when I lived in Ellicott (which is about the same distance or even maybe a little further) I always busted it from there to CSIC in 10-12 minutes
But 60% is a majority
No problem - be warned /r/freefolk doesn't handle spoilers too well, so if you haven't seen an episode don't go there until you have (or in this case until you're caught up). /r/freefolk is more memey

can confirm; basement rooms start with a B (at least in the math building).

Not sure what classes you take but the only time that's actually happened was my first class freshmen year. Every other class was 5 minutes syllabus and then jumping right in.
Yeah, I thought the "What's in there?" guard was gonna make another appearance of accidently letting it out.
No. Pretty sure basement rooms in the math building start with B. I could be wrong though.

Well, the bike isn't locked to anything, rather the lock is just on the bike (if that makes sense). I bought the lock directly from DOTS; if they're willing to look up the serial number of the lock and pull the records of when I bought it, that would at least say something. At that point that still doesn't prove it's mine, but then again if a bike thief is going through all this trouble (buying a lock, then locking a bike and waiting for 8 months) just to nab a bike that's worth as much as 2 or 3 hours at a minimum wage job, then maybe they deserve it.

i'm just going to register it tonight and call tomorrow/monday/when they're open and ask them how that works


i'll keep you guys posted


Well, it's working. 
I don't think I did. But what's stopping me from registering now?

Besides, you'd have to be a really stupid bike criminal to bring it to them to cut your lock. Even more so since my bike isn't worth more than $30

Wasabi is drunk sushi (it's cheap and not the best), Hanami is $$$ but it's really good (a lot better than Wasabi, by far) - that's a place more for a date or for when your parents are in town and they're paying. Never tried Shanghai.

Not really. Shouldn't be too hard to do a quick scan for common slurs and profane words of each response and to hide those. Then just to  be safe add a warning saying something like "These are unmonitored so view at your own risk.."

Bonus points for when you're showing someone something on your screen and they ask "Why is your screen so orange?"

Or even better when someone else is showing you something on their computer and looking at it hurts your eyes.
Not sure how old you are but I'm a college aged guy. My friends and I use it send each dumb pictures and inside jokes. And we've started using the chatting feature moreso since they made group chats a thing as we have a mix of Android and iPhones in our group - it's kind of like iMessage to us.

They're probably going to milk this for a while. Limited supply creates hype and demand.
Am I dumb? I know you said left to right but I still don't understand this. You went from 195 to 215 then back to 185?
Thanks! I'll look into that.
I used IF to cut  ~20 pounds in about 12 weeks, and it worked for me. I couldn't imagine bulking with it though; eating ~3000 calories in a small window sounds hard. 
Don't feel bad. This reminds me of all the "I should have bought it when it was only a few dollars a coin" and the "I sold when it hit $100 but I should have held!" people. Hindsight is 20/20, there's no way you could have known so don't stress out about it. 
>I flat out refuse to use my debit card at the pump. 

I flat out refuse to use my debit card anywhere except an ATM. And even then, that's rare. Use credit for everything you can. 
541s are great, but as always be careful of Levi's trash quality control. Always try them on, especially if you're getting different a wash/color (even if it's the same fit..)

I also went from an S8+ from a 6P a few months ago and can cocnur with everything you said.

The S8+ is a great phone, and Samsung's software overlay isn't too bad (espically compared to.older versions). The only thing I miss from my 6P is the front facing speakers (the speaker on the S8+ is a little puny) and root (although there's a lot you can do with this phone that doesn't require root, but still there's a few small root only features I'll always miss). 
Is that CTCI I see under your lamp? A little early for that, no? Haha

If you're lazy and/or a cheap ass like me (curtains sound expensive and like a hastle) you can pick up a sleep mask from Amazon for $10. Also another great purchase imo
And he'll probably be pardoned, too.
yup, those are the exact ones. the SAVE20 code brought it down to around ~$32
Online - the shoes were ~$39 and they had a code to take an extra 20% off. Also used Ebates for %10 cashback I think. Check out their website - I ordered on Monday and got them yesterday
You already know to get the classic ones - check out the clearance sections of shoe sellers. I just picked up a pair for $32 with free shipping from Nike's clearance sale this week.
>It Comes at Night

Really wanted to see this but it was not playing around me. Just tried last weekend to look it up online to see if I could stream it or download it and couldn't find anything...even with the unpaid route I couldn't find it.
I agree - I did enjoy the first one more. The only part I really liked about the movie (and was scared from) was The Nun.

Funny you mention that. I started watching Black Mirror shortly after watching Get Out and was pleasantly surprised that Chris was the main actor on one of the early episodes.

Not a conspiracy theorist; just someone who (tries) to know his rights. 

Yes, I know what probable cause is; however, in regards to your home the only time that comes into play is that the police can use that to attempt to a warrant. Which by itself contradicts your first comment, brother.
>Go to as many career fairs as possible and you'll end up getting a job from some random company you applied to online

this is so true

source: happened to me
That's not true in the case of your house. Your domicile is supposed to be one of the most private areas according to the law. 

Police can only enter without a warrant if you give consent, are currently being arrested (search on arrest), if something is in plain view, or on exigent circumstances (i.e. if someone is clearly in danger). 

This is why you step outside when answering the door for police, or just don't answer at all.

FWIW this is going to highly depend on where you're living, OP. $60 a week may be plenty in some parts of the US (I assume you're in the US) and it may be next to nothing in others.
Yes, but how was the ice cream?
Why eggwhites instead of the whole egg?

My grandmother just passed away at 94 years old just 2 weeks ago. She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's almost 14 years ago. It has truly an awful descent but she was a fighter and she stuck it out to the end.   Towards the end, she did not know who I was; but deep down I knew she was still there. 

I am truly terrified of this disease and I am even more scared of what might happen to my mom. I can only imagine how my mom felt watching my grandmother basically deteriorate to nothing; she lived in a nursing home but for 13 years almost every week my mom would visit her. I honestly believe I do not have the strength that my mom did, and I am scared that I won't be strong enough to be a good enough caretaker to my mom like she did to hers if she gets diagnosed with it.

The guy at Mode Tailors (I think his name is Kevin) is legit; I think I paid $50 to slim a jacket and a shirt. I think the shirt by itself was ~10-15 which is typical for that kind of thing.  I posted the same question on here not too long ago and got the same response haha
Damn, a similar desk from an office store would probably cost more than that. And this looks better! Nice work.
Ah yes, season trading. Comparable to day trading, albiet a little less risky.

If anybody is interested in renting anything at Monument Village (the place just past the Enclave) they're doing a referral program. I think  I get $500 for referring you so if you're interested DM me and I'll cut you a check for half of that if you decide to lease with them.
Ok, Adam.
