It's just colloquialism, like if he just said rolls he could mean bread rolls or something.  You know what he means if he says sushi roll.  If you really want to try to split hairs, they are called temaki or maki, which he says in the original comment.

In Japanese if you say we're getting sushi, you're suggesting raw fish not rice.... Which is the same as English unless you are trying to be dense 
In the same way that a sandwhich is stuff between bread. Like if i told you youre getting a sandwhich and you got  a chicken wing and marshmallow in bread its not what you think of as a sandwhich.  If you gave someone a bowl of seasoned  rice with some cream cheese and called it sushi it would be bizzare.

Wrappers are sort of the same... but not entirely.  Wonton wrappers are the yellow ones and don't hold in the juices as well (like if you've ever had juicy xialongbao... not wonton style wrappers), or they wouldn't do great if you were to pan-fry them like potstickers.  They are mostly for boiling and served in a soup.  Like jiaozi are often also boiled, but taken out of the water and served on their own. Other than that the wrappers are it's mostly just the thickness.

I'm not sure about bed sheet because in Japan they were pretty regularly available, like a duvet cover.  The thing takes up a lot of space in the closet, it folds into a square, I dont think it'd fit into my closet now back home here in the states, because of how deep it needs to be.  TBH I wouldn't recommend it.  An air mattress, foldout couch or even a sleeping bag would be better.
I lived in Japan for a couple years and slept on a futon.  I freakin missed having a bed so bad.  Having to unroll/roll up the bed every day is such a pain in the ass.  You roll it up every day because if you don't fungus and mites and stuff can grow between the futon and the ground, or in the futon itself.  You also have to air it out in the sun regularly.


I would really recommend getting a bed.

The metro connects cities and not helpful unless you live/work very close to the station, and most stations are far out of the way where people live/work and not that useful because of the sprawl.  To give you an idea of the size, LA is 503 sq miles where Seattle is 83.  The LA metro goes through 3 counties and a bunch of cities (LA is only that cluster in the middle with like a dozen or so stations).

Just to give you an idea, if you look at 2 random stations next to each other (Artesia to Del Amo, just south of where the blue and green line meet), I used to work semi close to there. They are nearly 6 miles apart and in different cities.  From there to downtown LA takes 45 min and about 16 miles.  To put it into perspective, SeaTac to Downtown is 14 miles.  That is only 1/4 of the size of the North/South of the LA metro map.  The map looks extensive, but when you take into account the size of the area on it, it's not nearly as extensive as you think.  




It is NOT better in LA.

people take the wasabi mound and put it in a small bowl and cover it with soy sauce http://www.allaboutsushiguide.com/images/mixing-wasabi-in-soy-sauce-250.jpg

Which isn't the norm is higher end sushi places (where they are more likely to give you real wasabi)
Yea I've had it at a few different sushi places.  They will grate the fresh wasabi and put it directly onto your sushi, instead of having the wasabi sit in a thing of soy sauce for your entire meal.
Me too.  While I initially loved the Z3, I've had countless problems... and I can't even be bothered to send it in.  I'm going to get the Nexus when it comes out (or even back to iPhone 7).

Meh. I'll pull out my iPhone/Android device from the pocket of my Levi jeans and decide whether I should listen to Jazz or Hip Hop. If I get bored of that Ill pick one of the many award winning Hollywood films to watch, perhaps even a Disney movie. Maybe read a book written by Mark Twain or George R.R. Martin or even a Marvel/DC comic book. Slide into my Nike's and be glad that I don't have polio because Dr Thomas Francis Junior's vaccine. Ill then dine on BBQ meats and wash it down with some bourbon and think about Olympic gold medals, cowboys and Star Wars.

1) Get the guy to swing and miss

2) Get the guy to not swing when it's within the strike zone.

This pitch in particular is impressive because it appears to be within the strike zone (over the base and between the batters shoulders and knees) but then moves A LOT way out of there.

To compare, here's a good example of a pitch that looks like it is OUT of the strike zone then moves into it:

Yes.  Smoke legal weed, go to glass museum.  10/10 would do again
Yea a big thing is the after work life, like after work, go grab some dinner/happy hour with co-workers or friends.  Having to drive home for an hour really limits that.  Also it's like having two lives, the life with people around where I work and where I live.
one of the great things about Osaka is the day trips.  Kyoto, Kobe, Nara, Wakayama are all like 45 min away.
Yea I love walkable cities, but Orange County is built to be a suburb.  People move here for that reason.
Would like to add that it's only eligible for income made over $100,800.  Like I lived and taught English abroad and didn't have to worry about paying US taxes.

>If you are a U.S. citizen or a resident alien of the United States and you live abroad, you are taxed on your worldwide income. However, you may qualify to exclude from income up to an amount of your foreign earnings that is adjusted annually for inflation ($92,900 for 2011, $95,100 for 2012, $97,600 for 2013, $99,200 for 2014 and $100,800 for 2015). In addition, you can exclude or deduct certain foreign housing amounts.

Not to get too into your business.... but it seems like you would have enjoyed your time in LA a lot more if you lived closer to work.  You'd have spend an hour or two less on the road every day, free up your time, been able to go to happy hours and that sort of thing etc.  I only say this because I had a shit commute in the LA area for years too... and cutting down that commute was a HUGE improvement on my quality of life.  Whatever you do in the future, I urge you to take into account the commute.
If you want to go by dictionary definition a sport also includes physical exertion.  If you want to go by how people use language.... if someone were to ask you if you play any sports, would you answer with "yea I play Starcraft"?  
I don't really give a shit, I love video games, I love sports.  It is weird when people really try to justify it in the same realm though like "I get physically tired after playing CS for 6 hours" and stuff like that.  

To me there's athletic sports... then there are other "sports" like e-sports and motor sports.
Confirmed, studying is a sport.

I remember from school reading about the development of armor and weapons as an arms race.  China in particular, the crossbow was invented way before more advanced armor techniques (like 200 BC) so it halted the development of more advanced armor since a peasant with a crossbow could essentially take down someone with very expensive armor.

The steppe nomadic tribes (which may partially explain the Ottomans) relied heavily on highly maneuverable cavalry archers and other light cavalry.

> advertisers pay more for a market of people that have more money

No they don't, they pay to be next to relevant content in any medium.  Also, where are you baseing all these assumptions off of?  
Almost all journalism, in any form (magazines, newspapers, television, radio, internet) comes from advertising and very occasionally public funding. Subscriptions are typically a very small % (<10%) of revenue and used mostly to gather demographic information (we have 50,000 subscribers in this region) which is used to target ads.  Also, the point of online ads is not to get the user to click a link.  


You can just cite where you got it from, change a few words.  And if you haven't noticed, copyright laws on the internet are hard to enforce.

Damn I just read her wikipedia entry

Wuornos was born Aileen Carol Pittman in Rochester, Michigan, on February 29, 1956.[2] Her mother, Diane Wuornos (born 1939), was 14 years old when she married Aileen's father, Leo Dale Pittman (1937–1969), on June 3, 1954. Less than two years later, and two months before Aileen was born, Diane filed for divorce. Aileen's older brother Keith was born on March 14, 1955.[3]

Wuornos never met her father; he was incarcerated at the time of her birth.[2] Pittman was diagnosed with schizophrenia, later convicted of sex crimes against children,[4] and eventually hanged himself in prison on January 30, 1969.[1][5] In January 1960, when Wuornos was almost four years old, Diane abandoned her children, leaving them with their maternal grandparents, Lauri and Britta Wuornos, who legally adopted Keith and Aileen on March 18, 1960.[5]

By the age of 11, Wuornos began engaging in sexual activities in school in exchange for cigarettes, drugs, and food.[6] She had also engaged in sexual activities with her brother.[4] Wuornos claimed that her alcoholic grandfather had sexually assaulted and beaten her when she was a child; before beating her, he would force her to strip out of her clothes.[4] In 1970, at age 14, she became pregnant,[7] having been raped by a friend of her grandfather's.[4] Wuornos gave birth to a boy at a home for unwed mothers on March 23, 1971, and the child was placed for adoption.[5] A few months after her baby was born, she dropped out of school[4] at about the time that her grandmother died of liver failure. When Wuornos was 15, her grandfather threw her out of the house, and she began supporting herself as a prostitute and living in the woods near her old home.[5]

* The Superbowl is a WAY bigger event than Americas Cup. 

* DHS comes out in force regularly in SF.  After the Paris attacks, on 9/11 every year, during the 99% protests, after the Boston bombings, during the World Series, during pride week, every bank protest (which happens oftern)... 

* Superbowl city was mostly around the Ferry Building. I'm up in SF at least once a month and stay at my brothers place which is right in the middle of the Financial District (Main and Folsom) which is about 3 blocks from the Ferry building.  I was there this past week.  Traffic was surprisingly not that bad.  It was really only noticeably worse Friday and Saturday night.

Well according to this article they should be just fine:


> an independent study determined that San Francisco will be paying nearly $5 million to host celebratory events, while Santa Clara, where the game is actually being played, will have its costs covered by the NFL.

> Last year's Super Bowl (played in Glendale but with Scottsdale and Phoenix hosting events) produced a gross economic impact of $719.4 million for the entire state, according to a study from Seidman Research Institute and the School of Business at Arizona State University.

Yes.  As a matter of fact ATMs generally have the best exchange rates, you will get market rates and converting cash will get you the worst.  Some banks though charge a flat fee per transaction, some charge a percentage.  Other banks still don't charge anything at all and will refund you if the ATM charges you something too.
Most international companies do the same when sending employees overseas.

The thing got ripped out and I had to send it in for service.  Replacement phone has a white flare on the screen near the power button.  It's barely noticeable... so whatever.  A big reason I got the Z3 is because it's water proof.  I've used it actually in water maybe 2 or 3 times.... and that's really just changing songs while in the pool or something, never fully in the water, just wet hands.  Camera lense is super foggy....

So yea its a great-ish phone, but the build quality is questionable and customer support is shitty.

You could definitely spend at least a few nights in Kyoto too, most people that visit in Japan do.  They have some really great ryokan there.  Most of the sites in Kyoto are really spread out so you spend quite a lot of time going from one thing to the other.  

Nara you could probably do a day trip from Osaka since most the main stuff is pretty close.  While I lived in Osaka, I would go down and spend a weekend in Nara every once in a while though to get away from the city... I just really like Nara and would consider spending a couple nights there.

In Osaka most the night life is near Umeda or Namba (dotonobori) areas.  

 
Because the bribery money was done through US banks and transfered through US cable so it's under US jurisdiction.  
Yes, that one time.  That's the same as every time for everyone.

You can probably do Nara in a couple days as day trips from Osaka.  I'd say the same possibly for Kyoto (although probably more days).  Nightlife in Kyoto isn't that great, but LOTS to see and do during the days.  Osaka is like the opposite, great nightlife and eating, the day time stuff is just city life.

A big difference between UFC vs boxing is... in boxing, you get knocked out, get 8 seconds to re-calibrate yourself and you get back in the fight... multiple times.

UFC, you get clocked hard, the guy jumps on you and hits you in the head a few more times and then the fights over.
Also, gloves are intended to protect your hands, not the other persons face.
No don't really get a metallic taste... I always do rinse it with hot water before adding coffee too (more to bring up the temperature so it doesn't instantly make my coffee cold).

I've definitely had some crappy travel mugs I got from trade shows and stuff that tasted very metallic.  

I also have a contigo as my backup when I leave the Stanley at work or something... Much prefer the Stanley one.
Big fan of these:

I've had one for 5 years, double-walled stainless.  Buy it for life quality and comes with a lifetime warranty.  Keeps the coffee hot for 7 hours and is incredibly durable (I've left it on my car and drove off a few times and barely a dent).

The written language used Chinese before (similarly Japanese and Korean use/used Chinese writing before).  Also, while spoken Vietnamese is from a different language family than Chinese, 30-60% of the vocabulary are loan-words from Chinese.

The written language is kind of complicated... it used Chinese script and official documents were written in Chinese until the early 20th century, and there was modified Chinese script used more colloquially.  Under French colonialism, Romanisation became used.

Semi similar story.  I taught in Japan.  A kid (maybe 6 years old) pissed himself.  Wasn't sure what to do, last thing I wanted was this kid to go home and tell his parents his teacher took him to the bathroom and took off his pants, or a kid to stick his finger in the socket as I went with this kid to clean him off.  I put a newspaper over the pee spot and went about the class.  I phoned the incident in.  Starting the following week, all students in the younger classes were required to bring an extra pair of underwear.
I think the main thing that separated this and $15 million homes that he mentions is location

Dude, everyone cleans up after themselves after the game too, like they pick up all their trash, peanut shells... everything.  Not just baseball games too, Japan in general.
I went to a few baseball games in Japan when I was living there... it was awesome.  They do chants and flag stuff like at soccer games, the food is awesome... but the best is during the 7th inning stretch, instead of singing "take me out to the ball game" they hand out these balloons, then you blow them up and everyone lets them fly at the same time.

Kinda....not really.  

A lot of countries in the Chinese language is 2 symbols, some are purely based on sound and they pick the nearest Chinese sounding symbols.  Keep in mind each Chinese symbol is a single syllable.  The first is like the "name", the second is always the symbol for country.  China is Middle Country.  Korea in Han-Country (韓國) etc.  A lot of Western countries is based on sound, like Germany in German is Deutchland...in Chinese its Deu-County (德國), England is Eng-Country (英國)

America is Mei-Country (美國).  The mei by itself means pretty-- which is kind of awesome.


An example of a purely sound-based country name is something like Canada (加拿大).  The symbols by themselves would mean plus-take-big but sounds like Canada.  Or Portugal (葡萄牙) which the symbols individually would mean... grape-grapes-tooth

She's an great damage dealer.  Eder is a much better pure tank.

>In 2001, she became the first African-American woman and second woman songwriter to win the Pop Songwriter of the Year award at the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers Pop Music Awards.[19][211] Beyoncé was the third woman to have writing credits on three number one songs ("Irreplaceable", "Grillz" and "Check on It") in the same year, after Carole King in 1971 and Mariah Carey in 1991. She is tied with American songwriter Diane Warren at third with nine songwriting credits on number-one singles.[212] (The latter wrote her 9/11-motivated song "I Was Here" for 4.[213]) In May 2011, Billboard magazine listed Beyoncé at number 17 on their list of the "Top 20 Hot 100 Songwriters", for having co-written eight singles that hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. She was one of only three women on that list.[214]

Do you have a need for a tablet at all?

I have an iPad, I do like it, but it's a far cry from an actual device I can be productive on since all the apps on it are really water-downed versions of full program installs, which is fine for a lot of stuff.

This tablet will essentially allow you to install full versions of software like a desktop/laptop.... like photoshop, excel, outlook, full chrome browser with plugins.  You can install some full on games too. 

I messed around with one of those Acer tablets... and they really just feel like laptops without a keyboard.  Battery life isn't great, not very well designed to use in-hand like a actual tablet etc.

The Surface Pro is just too expensive for me to justify getting one.  This seems like a good combo of all those things.

Unarmed get's all kinds of buffs and talents... like adding 5% fire damage per wound, increased range etc.  With the ridiculous attack speed (and if you get that one talent with increased interrupt) he can almost stun-lock whoever he's attacking.

I have a pretty well balanced barbarian and it's working out really well.  Does good damage and can soak up a lot of hits.  Ill usually have my main tank go in first, then barb go in second (or take care of   the flanks).  Dual wield for lower DR enemies, or when interrupting is important.  Switch to 2-hander for big hits.   Pretty versatile.  Can dish it out and can soak it up depending on who's in my party.  Oh and he's got some really useful AOE debuffs too... which I wasn't planning on.
Rogues are tough early on because they are such glass cannons... but once you get a couple meat shields in front of you, or someone buffing you, rogues do crazy, reliable damage.
Yup, not to mention they basically just let all the convicted war criminals off after a few years and stopped pursuing the ones awaiting trial or still on the run.  Like there were class A war criminals that were supposed to be executed or had life in imprisonment and they let them out after 15 years, or guys being held for trial, but they just let them all go free without trial.

Many of the war criminals went off to live successful lives...

Hippos don't give a fuck.  They are tough mofos.  Look at this hippo getting attacked by a pack of lions.  It's just like "pls stop, cmon stop" then the lions get tired and the hippo just goes on trucking.

Have you watched Marco Polo (the Netflix show)?  Kinda of awesome.  Not historically accurate though.
Been doing lots of traveling since pre-smart phone era.  They really are a huge convenience.  Good, small camera.  Nice music player for long flights or whatever.  If you want to send out some emails, find somewhere with wifi and send them out.  If you meet some people, super handy to have your phone.  Whatsapp, facebook etc. are great ways to keep in touch.  Super handy all around.  Just don't be an idiot, don't be a target.  Dont stand on the corner of an intersection looking lost while staring at your phone.

Maybe they sell all those records and are popular because they are talented?
The point I'm making is that any conqueror is celebrated by the people he benefited and vilified by the people he conquered.  Genghis is celebrated by the steppe people and where they are now.  Alexander is celebrated by Western Europeans and where they are now. Like how we celebrate Andrew Jackson but  I doubt Native Americans hold him in high regard.  It's interesting how one is regarded as "the great" (a title the Romans gave him) and the other as the villain.



I mean, Alexander the Great was probably pretty shitty to the people he conquered too.

I worked a good job in  Marketing for about 18 months after college.  Quit and went to teach English in Japan for 18 months.
 
Took me about 2 months to get a job when I got back.  Currently a web producer... although I do think about where I'd be if I stuck with that other job (SpaceX eventually bought that company)

I've also known people that came back and went to grad school or peace corp.  If you aren't afraid of some hard work, you'll be aite.

Parts of Texas are definitely hotter than LA (although... California has the hottest place in the country).  But average temperature in LA is about ~10F higher than SD so yea... it's different.

We can all agree that real time strategy turn based games isn't a thing and a contradiction.

Wow relax.  I love Hong Kong.... but to think that it doesn't owe much of it's economic success to the fact that it is attached to a country that was closed to the rest of the word for several decades would be dumb.  HK was the only way to do business with the most populated country in the world for a loooong time.  AND the guy I was originally responding to was complaining that he's not having enough money... which HK (having one of the highest cost of living) wouldn't help him at all.  Not to mention the posted story is about some wacky libertarian which is the opposite of an autocratic communist country.
Its also a SEZ of a communist country and quite the anomaly as well as having one of the highest costs of living in the world.

Well yea.  You're the one that said:

> people in this thread just like to see women get punched in the face

> you guys seemed to have a raging boner towards male violence against women

>finding it abnormally pleasurable seeing a girl get popped in the mouth

>  I'm being downvoted by the "equality justice boner" probable wife beaters in this thread.


So I feel like I had to explain it to you.




I don't think you understand.  It's not about a *girl* getting punched in the face, it's about a person who sucker punched someone else in the face twice then laughed about it and taunted the other person getting punched in the face.  
@0:45 and then again @1:03
Punching someone in the face multiple times while they are sitting down, to the point where they are bleeding, then mocking them is a good amount of setup for some justice.
I don't like seeing people get punched in the face, but I love justice, regardless of gender.

Yea they are kinda different.  There's 1000 variations of hot pot, like this [Chengdu hotpot](http://cache.graphicslib.viator.com/graphicslib/media/b9/hot-pot-photo_2147257-fit468x296.jpg) where you cook a bunch of meat on skewers in super spicy broth. Shabu shabu is basically a specific kind of hot pot.   Shabu shabu you typically just cook what you are immediately going to eat, like dunk a piece of meat or two in to cook then eat... also it's typically mostly meat).   The soup base is usually pretty mild in taste, and you dunk the cooked meat in sauce.
