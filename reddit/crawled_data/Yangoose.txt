Remind me which of these were CS fields again...
For fun, here's a quick google script I threw together to email my kids to remind them to walk the dog. This is not tied to a sheet, it's a [standalone script that runs on google's servers](https://script.google.com/home). They each have an assigned day of the week but they rotate every Wednesday. I threw this together in about 15 minutes last year so I'm sure it could be vastly improved.


    var scriptProperties = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties();
    var lastWed = scriptProperties.getProperty('lastWed');
    var mailSubject = 'It is your dog day! If you cannot take care of the dog today it is up to you to get someone else to';
    
    
    function dogDay(){
    switch (new Date().getDay()) {
      case 0:
      case 1:
        MailApp.sendEmail('kid1@email.com', 'Dawg Day', mailSubject);
        break;
      case 2:
      case 4:
        MailApp.sendEmail('kid2@email.com', 'Dawg Day', mailSubject);
        break;
      case 5:
      case 6:
        MailApp.sendEmail('kid3@email.com', 'Dawg Day', mailSubject);
        break;
      default:
        switch (lastWed){
          case 'Kid2':
            scriptProperties.setProperty('lastWed', 'Kid3');
            MailApp.sendEmail('kid1@email.com', 'Dawg Day', mailSubject);
            break;
          case 'Kid3':
            scriptProperties.setProperty('lastWed', 'Kid1');
            MailApp.sendEmail('kid3@email.com', 'Dawg Day', mailSubject);

> You don't see many women in tech (though that's been changing), just like you don't see many male nurses or teachers

The fields dominated by women are very heavily focused on personal interaction, relationships and nurturing. (Nurses, teachers, therapists)

The fields dominated by men are heavily focused on high physical demands, dangerous work and working with "things", not people. (Brick layers, pipelayers, mechanics)

Is it really that crazy to suggest a genetic component in these preferences?
White and Asian people make up almost 88.6% of the population of Washington. 

Black people make up just 4.1% of the population.

I agree, but in an era when 911 operators can hang up on thousands of callers and get 10 days in jail does it really make sense to send this guy to jail for over a year?

If your relationship is strong enough to survive Monopoly you don't want to throw that away by cheating.
I had a job I hated with a passion. When I quit I gave notice, gave copious documentation and worked hard up to my last day.

Now that it's been a while in hindsight I kind of wish I'd just walked out and totally left them in the lurch.
Who's talking about % of revenue?  That has nothing to do with this.

The entire point of saying "regressive" is how about the percent of income the people pay.
The single biggest reason for taxes in Washington being "regressive" is the high sin tax on cigarettes, alcohol and tobacco. Poor people spend a much larger percentage of their income on these items and they are taxes at an extremely high rate.

If you really want to end this horrible regressive system that you post about here every fucking day then stop fucking around with complicated sliding scale carbon tax nonsense that's never gonna happen and start subsidizing beer and cigarettes for the poor.

If you're not willing to do that then please just STFU about the topic.
Gas stations still charge in fractions of a cent because people think it costs a penny less.

Stores charge $9.99 instead of $10 because even though people logically know it's effectively the same thing we still buy more often when it's only "$9".
Yes, he did something wrong. Did it really deserve over a year of prison time?
> How about the actual statement by Microsoft

What does a PR statement from Microsoft's lawyers have to do with anything at all?


I think that does a great job of explaining why it costs $890k a mile, not $13 million.
OK, so he downloaded perfectly legal copies of Windows and put it on DVD's which he sold for 25 cents. The intent was for people to save a couple hours downloading the software themselves when buying used computers. The software could not be used without purchasing a license. He put a fancy label on them to make them look "Official" and not some shitty CDR written on with a sharpie.

I understand what he did wrong. You can't sell other people's software and you can't pretend it's official media when it's not.

All that being said, does locking this guy in prison for over a year really fit the crime? Wells Fargo illegally opened millions of accounts in peoples' names without permission. Equifax lost incredibly sensitive data on hundreds of millions of people. These things are a MUCH bigger deal than selling a recovery disk for a quarter yet not one person went to jail over any of that.

Wow, I had to look that one up and you are 100% correct. [Source](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/930-million-move-seattle-levy-falling-behind-on-project-promises-review-finds/)

$13 million dollars to turn one mile of road into a bike lane? How can that possibly not be incompetence and/or corruption?
Is there some reason to not just sort the list by priority and use the row numbers?  Then when you finish a job you drag that row to the "Completed Jobs" section at the bottom of the sheet?
Then use the price of the outside company to negotiate what they should pay you to cover it instead.
Standing still for hours doing nothing sounds awful.
I got laid off a job a few years back. They didn't ask about anything I'd been working on or ask for any notes. I just got pulled into my bosses office, shown some paperwork to sign, given a severance check then escorted out of the building.  About a month later I got a frantic call on my cell phone from somebody asking why I wasn't responding to emails and what was going on with a big project I'd been working on.

I told them my position had been eliminated and was met with dumbfounded silence for a while followed by "Well who's doing all the stuff you were doing then?"

I told her I had no idea and good luck.
Yeah, everyone that worked there that I'd ever dream of using as a reference had already left and honestly I'd sooner feed my family by working at the local 7/11 than go back there so I felt I was being pretty generous even giving a week.
> give him back a lot better

Yeah, sorry, if somebody murdered my wife and children then gave me  a "better" wife that would not be OK.
I went through that entire thing in depth and even manually re-created some of his intersections. It's still not coming together in my brain.
Last year I quit a job I hated with a passion I cannot adequately describe in words.

When I gave my 1 week notice my boss said I'd probably need to work some long hours to make the transition work and scheduled everyone to have a meeting after my normal quitting time.  I didn't say a word but when my normal quitting time arrived I packed up my shit and went home.

They got the message.
The top train needs to cross. The bottom train is in a "Yellow" zone but it's completely different from the "Yellow" zone the top train needs to go to.  These are the only two trains on these tracks.
Rather than just being smug, why don't you educate us as to what exactly the difference is?
The title of the article is literally "Evergreen State College reopens after violent threat and property damage on campus".  The video you refuse to watch contains recordings of the threats and of actual violence being done.

But sure, go ahead and pretend nothing happened I guess.  As long as it fits the narrative that makes you happy...

In my state one of the most [liberal colleges on the planet](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/06/05/evergreen-state-college-reopens-after-violent-threat-and-property-damage-on-campus/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.5e49325a3914) absolutely lost their shit when a liberal (but sane) professor questioned some of the absurd nonsense they were doing.  Namely, they decided to have a "No Whites Allowed" day where white students and faculty were threatened with violence if they showed up on campus.

The professor spoke out (very eloquently) saying he felt it was counter productive to exclude people on threat of violence based on the color of their skin.  The student base went insane, clashed with police and basically shut down the campus for days as they ran amok like fucking animals.

The professor was asked not to come back by the gutless "leadership" of the school.

Here's a really good video covering what happened.

They sure seem to matter. If I have a train in a yellow area no other train will enter any other yellow area even though they are separated by multiple signals.
If you've got good people in there they should have things running smoothly enough that even with them gone things will run reasonably well for some time.  This leads management to think that those people were unnecessary.  Then 6-12 months later the shit really hits the fan.
> a more robust design for higher volume cases is: https://giant.gfycat.com/ElaborateFeminineAlaskanmalamute.webm - this one accepts up to 4 belts of input and will sustain 4 belts of output for as long as it has a buffer You can set output priority on the first 4 splitters to cause it to not use the buffer until the output is backed up, and when the output belts are clear it maintains 100% throughput. Also being somewhat lane balanced n the output is nice. I will typically put this after my smelting array but before the balancer that starts my bus.

I like this one.  Uses up a lot of room but it's pretty!

You really seem to be giving your dad short shrift here.

At some point it's not about keeping score.  Sounds like they both worked their asses off.
It works the other way too. I work a high paying job with a long commute so I'm out of the house 50-60 hours a week.  She works an easy minimum wage 20 hour a week job a mile from our house.  We have kids but the youngest is 17 so it's not like we're changing diapers or anything.

You're damn right she should do the cooking and cleaning. If she wants to get a high paying full time job I will happily take over those responsibilities.

It's also 0.000005% of what we spend every year on Social Security.

Those damn greedy senior citizens cost way more than the military.
There is still a finite level of resources in the world. Even with zero greed involved there are only so many resources to go around. People are dying every day because they lack access to medical care that cost much less than $4.5 million dollars.

The money spent to save this one child could run a small hospital in a poor country saving hundreds of people.
Yes, the whole point is that I want my various trains to not run into each other.  There's not enough colors for all of them to never be on the same color at the same time....
Well yeah, I have like 5 trains. There's not enough colors to have them all be on their own color all the time...
I just want them not to smash into each other at a crossing but as soon as I plunk a signal down any train on either rail stops any other train from moving?

How do people ever make large train networks with multiple trains?

The first person to log in gets admin rights. I'm always the first person to log into the computer when I set them up.
That doesn't work either.  They all just sit there.

There are a lot of downsides to being a dude.

Men:

* Commit suicide a much higher rate
* Get longer jail sentences for the same crime
* Get murdered much more often
* Just as likely to be raped but are much less likely to be taken seriously when reporting it, often being ridiculed instead
* As children are more likely to be raped than girls
* Are much less likely to get custody of their own children
* Get arrested for domestic violence even when they were the victim (which is actually more common)
* Have much fewer options to escape abuse (almost all abuse shelters don't allow men)
* Can be drafted
* Get much less funding and attention for male only diseases
I was at the grocery store with my wife. She was at the register waiting to pay and I was down putting the bags in the cart. An old woman standing behind my wife touched her arm and said "Is that your husband? He's very handsome".

Honestly, the mouth frothing outrage culture of the extreme left is pushing me right.
> The intolerant left 

I hadn't heard that before. It fits well.

My city's subreddit is full of them. I get downvoted there for stating facts because they don't fit their narrative.
>Bonds add stability, decrease risk, increase liquidity, and increase over all returns. Studies have shown (weasel words, I know) that a portfolio with a percentage of bonds is less likely to go bust that one purely in stocks. Look at portfolio allocation studies.

I 100% agree with having bonds as part of your portfolio later in life but at 27 he doesn't need increased stability, just growth.


>To sum it up simply, bonds/stocks rally/crash at different times. When one market is down you can use the other market to buy in the one. Bonds at 125% can be used to buy stocks at 75% and increase over all returns. Also, bonds rarely crash as much as stocks, you can live off them rather than more heavily crashed stocks.

This sounds a whole lot like trying to time the market which almost never works out.
> he was the kind of person who echoed the people around him

Most people are to some degree. Who you choose to spend your time with has a huge impact on you.
At the end of the day paying $500 million to bring in $1 billion seems incredibly inefficient and wasteful. Seems to me at that point you go back to the drawing board to figure out a better way to make it work.
I supply them computers, though we've had consultants use their own and it honestly makes little difference.

I create the account, give them the password which is set force them to change it on their first login.
I'm running a 30 person office (with another 10 remote) and we are 100% in the cloud.  Our "Server Room" has nothing but switches and routers.

Azure AD works pretty great IMO.  Yeah, you don't have the super granular controls you have on Prem but I don't care. I just let the computers update on their own. Azure is holding all my bitlocker keys. Using Symantec Endpoint for AV let's me manage/monitor everything there.

We are using SharePoint/OneDrive as our primary data store. It's... OK. I don't know of anybody that really loves SharePoint.  It's kind of clunky and weird. It's a 20 year old product that has grown and morphed over time and it shows when you start digging under the hood.
For most people out of all the taxes you pay maybe 5% of them go to the military and yet you hear people talk about military spending as if we'd suddenly be able to pay for universal healthcare or huge expenses like that if only we didn't have to pay for the military when those ideas are complete divorced from reality.

The truth is that the vast majority of our tax dollars pay for health care, social security, schools, roads, etc.
Why do any bonds at this point?  He's just sacrificing growth for no good reason.
> So I am happy to drop a large part of military spending,

Military spending is actually a pretty small part of all the taxes you pay.  It's 16% of the Federal budget.  When you factor in all the state taxes you pay (Sales, property, gas, etc) it's a very small slice of the overall tax pie.

Well if this an example of how they handle our money then higher taxes sounds like a terrible idea.
I'm not even sure what point you're trying to make.
Seriously, **WTF**.

>Collecting highway tolls costs an average 8 percent to 11 percent of the amount collected, according to the congressional report. But WSDOT estimates the cost to be much higher, 49.7 percent, for the SR 99 tunnel.

Apparently regressive taxes are the way to go!
I was looking at my local elementary school just the other day.

For the 2016-2017 school year they got $12,691.90 per student, I believe it's over $13,000 for the current school year but I couldn't find the exact number. That is on par with what most private schools charge.

In our school district we have nearly 100 administrators making over $100,000 a year and a superintendent with a base salary of $254,500 a year in salary plus a nice bonus on top of that. We also have constantly shifting grading methods (First letter grades, then numbers, then symbols, then back to letters), expensive new curriculum and lots of other crap that really does nothing to benefit the children.

What we don't have is a balanced budget. There is currently a hiring freeze while they frantically scramble to make up for the multi-million dollar shortfall they ran themselves into.

The problem isn't that there isn't enough tax dollars. Giving more money to incompetent leaders just enables further incompetence.

Hmmm...  combining expensive technology with cardboard.

The [last time I spent money on fancy cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/) I used it for maybe 30 minute before it got put away...   forever...

Turns out cardboard isn't very comfortable or durable and overall doesn't make for a great user experience.
It looks suuuuuper gimicky to me. I think by this time next year there's going to be a lot of people with overpriced cardboard collecting dust in their closets.
I work in IT and one company had a policy that they didn't want people who'd given notice to have access to their systems.  I turned in my two weeks notice and was gone the same day.  They still paid me for the two weeks so I wasn't sad about it at all.
The flow of the staircase is amazing but I don't think I've ever seen neon more out of place ever in my life.

The title suggest this picture is peaceful and stress reducing. It doesn't make me feel that way at all.

It looks cold, dark and as if it's going to rain soon. The person looks like they're sitting on uncomfortable rocks. They're super close to the river so if that rain does come (or already has upstream) they are likely to get flooded. There's no spare firewood nearby and what's in that fire right now is going to last maybe 15 minutes. 

If this is supposed to to be the camp site then multiply everything I said times two.
It's not like there is some universal "Good" and "Bad" filter.

* The median teacher income is $58,000 a year.
* The median household income is $58,000 a year.
* Most households have more than one income
* Teachers get much more time off than a typical American (yes I know they often take a class or two during the summer but these are typically a couple hours a day for a week or two).
* Senior teachers can do ***extremely*** well for themselves.

[For example](https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/fashion/01generationb.html)

* Over $100,000 salary
* Fully paid health care
* Fully funded pension that will pay out $60,000+ in retirement


I spent years working at a school. I have good friends who are teachers. Teaching is a job that has a lot of pros and cons but at the end of the day it's just a job and teachers are just people. I don't understand why people want to ignore facts and try to deify them.



>thirty five fucking years ago. Get. Over. It.

I understand what you're saying but in this case the guy in question is the running a school district with huge bullying problems and growing concerns that the school district is doing little to nothing about it. https://abetterlegacy.com/

Within that context I think this type of revelation is kind of a big deal.
I assume you're just doing text then?  Once you start putting in handwriting, pictures and videos things go off the rail quickly.
OneNote seems to be a "Love it or Hate it" kind of product.

Personally I hate it. 

I ran IT at a school that used it heavily for all the students and teachers so these observations are not just from my personal use but from seeing it used daily by hundreds of people using Surface 4 Pro Tablets.

It's slow, clunky, akward and inconsistent (the "desktop" version, "UWP" version and "Web" version all look and behave vastly differently). The cache gets corrupted all the time. It collapses in on itself if more than a handful of people try to collaborate at the same time. Notebooks quickly blow up into huge multi-gig files which makes backing up and syncing take forever.

I have no idea why it's so popular. 
My dog would 100% know it's a test and would decide she would rather have the sandwich.
The other day we had a huge post with a 100 page report on how Washington has the most regressive taxes in the country and tobacco/alcohol taxes were a huge part of their numbers to come up with that conclusion.
This is one of the most poorly designed homes I've ever seen.

* Those stairs are terrifying. No railings on the top floor and [steel edges conveniently placed at head height so optimal chances of head wounds on the bottom floor.](https://imgur.com/NI9rAln)
* The fireplace is stupid. It wastes most of it's heat and would be a huge mess because all that wasted space will quickly fill with ash then blow around the whole cabin every time you open/close a door.
* Random drops, hard edges, pointless overhangs... This whole place is bruise central.
* The bathroom might has well have been designed by [Thermians](https://youtu.be/fM_IQAhvnKQ?t=219)
* The "chairs" are literally square wooden blocks.

This is possibly the least inviting, least comfortable, least practical and most dangerous dwellings I've ever seen.
This subreddit is constantly talking about regressive taxes.

**This is literally the most regressive tax in the state.**

So why isn't anybody talking about it?


I had a class that had a surprise test out of nowhere. The material on the test was never even mentioned in class. The next class we got back our graded exams. 100% of the class failed, badly.

The prof then acknowledged that he had purposefully never mentioned any of that content in class. He explained that the official class syllabus given out on first day of class had listed the chapters covered by the test as required reading material so it was our responsibility to have learned all that information.

Ruined my 4.0 GPA.
> The story I heard about that was that the local co-op beat Charter out for the federal rural broadband money a few years back and actually allocated the money to it's purpose (unlike Comcast, Verizon, etc. who have been accused of pocketing it).

It makes me so mad that we (as a country) let those companies get away with stealing all that money.
Did you watch the video he linked?

The guy ambushed the dude coming out of the toilet then started yelling at the staff loud enough for the whole restaurant to hear.
I struggle a bit with the concept that these guys who refused to leave when asked by the manager AND refused to leave when 6 police officers showed up asked them to and had to be handcuffed and arrested were just super chill guys not bothering anybody before it all came to a head.
This is a completely different video of Torrance, CA.

Pretty sure that would be grounds for divorce with my wife.

Do you have a source on this?  I'm genuinely curious, not trying to be a dick.  The actual facts of the incident seem exceedingly hard to come by.
Is there really nothing better for us as a society to worry about than a couple guys who hung out in a Starbucks without buying anything for two hours being asked to buy something or leave?

They could have bought a $2 coffee or they could have left.  Instead they waited to be forced out of the restaurant by the police. Fuck those guys and fuck the absurd overreaction to something so incredibly trivial.

I don't give a shit what color your skin is. It's private property and the business was well within their rights to ask them to leave.

This isn't healthcare, it's disability.

In no way do I want to imply that I think she's lying or trying to cheat the system, however, I can understand why she got denied. Chronic pain is virtually impossible to "prove".  From a legal and medical perspective there's really nothing separating her from somebody just claiming to have pain so they can get a check every month without having to work.

It sucks and it's sad and I feel bad for her but I don't think it reveals a broken system.
Also, those "extra" years we get now can be pretty low quality, like sitting around in a nursing home basically just waiting to die.
I've done a lot of 3D printing and it is a *gigantic* pain in the ass.

Bed leveling, bed adhesion, finding the perfect settings for the filament you're using, post printing clean up, etc. It's truly a "hobby" level activity solely for those willing to dump a lot of time and patience into it. 

We're still a very long ways from it being as simple as just hitting "print" and having your object pop out.

I certainly hope you don't count yourself in that group. You have been rude, condescending, dismissive, whiny and perfectly willing to make up imaginary numbers to prove your point.

We already have amongst the highest property taxes in the country.
If you make less money then perhaps you should move to a state that pays teachers better or just enjoy what is very likely a significantly lower cost of living in your current state. These are the kinds of things that everyone has to deal with. If you're in IT you can work in the bay area for $150,000 a year and rent a shitty apartment for $5,000 a month or you can get a job making $50,000 a year in Kentucky and buy a 3,000 square foot house for $150,000.

I actually worked at a school for years and have good friends who are teachers. Yes they spent a few days here or there in a class and the week before school was a big crunch time but all of them had tons of free time over the summer. Hell, several of them literally left the country the week after school ended and didn't come back until a week before school started.

If you've been teaching for 15 years I have no idea why you'd be spending a whole summer on "curriculum planning and development". Do you work for a school that doesn't provide any curriculum? What happened to all the stuff you developed over your 15 year career?

Plenty of teachers (especially elementary and middle school) work 40 hour weeks.

Plenty of non-teachers work over 40 hour weeks with unpaid overtime (IT, Accounting, etc)
The whole point is that taxes are "regressive" which is primarily the result of poor people spending a larger portion of their income on highly taxed items like beer and cigarettes.

No matter how much you charge wealthier people if you hope to end the horrible "regressive" system at some point you're going to need to subsidize tobacco and alcohol for the poor.
So, tax the rich to subsidize beer and cigarettes for the poor?
On average teachers make less at private school than public school.

https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/10/why-are-private-school-teachers-paid-less-than-public-school-teachers/280829/
> This makes them get paid relatively low compared to other professions with similar rates of those with BA and Masters degrees.

Really?  Let's take a look at the numbers.

* The average teacher salary is $58,000. [Source](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/high-school-teachers.htm#tab-5)
* Teachers are about 50/50 between 4 year degrees and higher levels [source](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=28)
* The median income for people with a bachelor's degree is $60,000 [source](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2016/weekly-earnings-by-educational-attainment-in-first-quarter-2016.htm)
* The median income for people with an advanced degree is $75,000 [source](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2016/weekly-earnings-by-educational-attainment-in-first-quarter-2016.htm)

To make this apples to apples we'll average the bachelor's median with the advanced median for a salary of $68,000.  Teacher work 75% of the year so we'll multiply that by 75% which comes to $51,000.

**TLDR:
Apples to apples a teacher makes $58,000 where other professions with the same amount of work and level of education makes $51,000.**
I am the furthest thing from a Trump supporter and I do think it's important to pay attention to what's happening with our media and I have no doubt the Kremlin is up to shenigans but when all someone feels they need to do to damn a person is tell me what country they were born in then we've veered into racist territory IMO.
[Rogue beer.](http://i.imgur.com/cfGFm5j.png)

They want a computer/phone/point of sale/database expert to work around the clock for basically minimum wage and I find that offensive. Also they are proud of the fact they don't "waste time" with things like plans, budgets or HR people.

Basically they are looking to take advantage of somebody who is desperate and squeeze every drop of usefulness they can out of them.

I want nothing to do with them.
Yes!  That was my biggest problem with that whole aspect of the movie.  You lost 8 bombers to take out a giant capital ship and you're upset about that?  WTF?
It's not what they are defending it's how they do it. A feeling of moral superiority enables people to do vile things because it's for what they consider to be a "good cause".
This is from my city's subbreddit just a couple weeks ago.

https://www.reddit.com/r/SeattleWA/comments/88gux9/komo_attacks_biased_and_false_news_in/dwkjeb8/

Swap the word "Russian" with "Jewish" and tell me how that comment looks to you because to me it looks like something straight out of a KKK newsletter.
I'm curious, do you consider it racism when the left wing crowd loses their mind when they find out a media executive has Russian heritage?
> unfortunately that includes racists and tons of toxic people in general

The most racist and toxic people I see these days are the SJW crowd who use their vast moral superiority like a club to crush discussion with massive downvotes, make wild accusations towards anyone not as outraged as they are and lose their fucking minds if somebody happens to have Russian heritage.
No, that was accounted for separately. I'm literally *just* talking about sales tax.
Wow, this is just total bull shit.  Here is one of the key findings of the "report".

>In 2014, the Washington Department of Revenue estimated that a household making $15,000 per year pays 26.5 percent of its income in state and local taxes, while a household making $140,000 pays 5.9 percent.

This is INCREDIBLY misleading. The Washington Department of Revenue never made any such claim. If you actually follow the rabbit trail to find the source of this claim you find it's not even close to reality. Four years ago the department of revenue released a spreadsheet model so you could play with different tax rates. [Link](https://dor.wa.gov/about/statistics-reports/washington-state-tax-alternatives-model). **It's just a model, not reality.** 

As is often the case with models when you hit extremes you get weird numbers totally detached from reality. How many households in Seattle city limits have a total income of only $15,000 a year? Being as food isn't taxed how in the world are we supposed to believe they are finding a way to spend 10.9% of their money on sales tax when the combined sales tax rate in Seattle is 9.6%?

Literally nothing about this makes any logical sense at all.

If they want to be taken seriously they need to start using real numbers and stop making shit up.
Honestly it's less about my new job being amazing than it is about my old job being horrible.  I'll give one story as an example.

In a team meeting I mentioned an idea I had for how we could do things better by having peers review each others projects.

After the meeting the owner came to my office and ripped into me for "undermining her authority" by suggesting an idea in a meeting without talking to her about it first. The next day I had a meeting with her and HR. I was told that I was being moved from the campus I was at and would now be in a campus 10 miles away in a back windowless closet full of random shit behind the copy machine. (I was not allowed to remove the crap)

In addition to this my new primary responsibility was to inventory every electronic device at that campus (the computers were already inventoried, this was for everything BUT computers). Every patch cable, mouse, power strip, hell I even inventoried Christmas lights. I was forbidden from throwing anything away so when I found a box labelled "bad cables" I had to test all 20-30 USB cables, verify they didn't work, then inventory them and put them back in the box. Also, she didn't want to pay for labels so nothing was marked in any way so there was no way to tie anything back to the inventory. I tried explaining that this list would be absolutely worthless but was smacked down for that. It was the equivalent of being forced to dig holes, fill them back in, then dig them again. The kind of psychological torture you use to break prisoners. I was paid a six figure salary for this work...
I'd just like to say that I ***HATED*** my last job. I could literally go on for hours about how awful it was. I dreamed of quitting but it paid well as I'm the only income earner in our family. I finally found a new job about six months ago and my quality of life has vastly increased.

Looking back I regret not just quitting the job and searching for work while unemployed. It's not worth it.  It's taken me months to mentally recover from that shit hole place.  Six months later I'm only just now starting to feel like my old, confident self.


I agree, but you've gotta be real careful uploading sensitive data to web sites like this.

Yeah, but it's one thing to buy upgraded hardware to support your legacy software.  It's another thing entirely to introduce it into a completely new environment in this day and age.
It can be a bit of a pain to setup but once you do it's a very cheap, easy source of power. If you mine out a relatively small uranium patch and enrich it with Kovarex you will have enough fuel to last a very, ***very*** long time.

On my current map I'm running a giant 24 reactor setup and I've probably a dozen chests sitting full of extra fuel, not to mention another 20 chests full of uranium.  All of this came from mining just enough to fill one belt with raw ore.
In 2012 I started working at a place in that had an accounting system that ran off an AS/400 mainframe and required everyone to use a terminal emulator. I assumed it was some legacy thing they'd been stuck with for decades. I later found out they'd purchased just a couple years prior in 2010.

Yeah, that's right. In the year 2010 they bought ancient mainframe technology from the 70's. Blew my mind.
I was looking at my local elementary school just the other day.

For the 2016-2017 school year they got $12,691.90 per student, I believe it's over $13,000 for the current school year but I couldn't find the exact number. That is on par with what most private schools in the area charge.

In our school district we have nearly 100 administrators making over $100,000 a year and a superintendent with a base salary of $254,500 a year in salary plus a nice bonus on top of that.  We also have constantly shifting grading methods (First letter grades, then numbers, then symbols, then back to letters), expensive new curriculum and lots of other crap that really does nothing to benefit the children.

What we don't have is a balanced budget. There is currently a hiring freeze while they frantically scramble to make up for the multi-million dollar shortfall they ran themselves into.

The problem isn't that there isn't enough tax dollars.  Giving more money to incompetent leaders just enables further incompetence.
Not to mention what Japan did to China makes the holocaust in Germany look like a Sunday picnic.

For example:

>Historians estimate that between December 13, 1937, and late January 1938, Japanese forces tortured and murdered up to 300,000 Chinese (mostly civilians and surrendered soldiers) and raped tens of thousands of women during the Nanking Massacre (also known as the "Rape of Nanking"), after its fall.

Much much more can be found here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes
Man, that might be my new phrase.

"This will not just be a lazy week-end it's going to be catheter level lazy"
Yeah, the hard part of crime is getting away with it. If you don't care about that part you can do a whole lot of damage before anybody stops you.
Doesn't even have to be alcoholic drinks.  I took my family out for pizza the other day and spent almost $15 just buying five sodas.
Ssshhhh!  Not so loud!  I'm still trying to get my adult children moved out!
> she had five kids coming to daycare and she worked at McDonalds

How could that possibly make financial sense?
This site gives a good example of how big a difference it makes getting up to 60 Hz.  https://frames-per-second.appspot.com/

Once you get above 60 Hz  the returns for higher frame rates start diminishing rapidly.

If you don't:

* have a very high end video card

AND

* play very fast paced games (like shooters)

AND

* play games at a very competitive level

then a 60 Hz monitor like this will do quite nicely.
I think the assumption is that you'd need to move to a LCOL area.

There are plenty of areas where you can get pretty nice place for under $200k.
If you look at line one it's saying "If A1 is less than 3 then it's Level 1".

The second line says "If A1 is less than 6 then it's level 2"

It just keeps going until the very last line says if it's less than 117 then it's level 10 otherwise anything left is level 11.

So this formula covers everything up to level 11.
>How do I do this?

Not in Excel. You'll want to use Google Sheets if you want automated emails.

This is going to take writing javascript or paying somebody to make this for you.
Assuming A1 is where you have the XP then you can use this formula.

    =
    IF(A1<3,1,
    IF(A1<6,2,
    IF(A1<12,3,
    IF(A1<18,4,

> When someone says, "I drive to work instead of take transit, because transit takes 3x as long", the correct response is, "Okay, how could we make transit a better option for you in the future?", not "you terrible person, how DARE you try to spend more time with your family, you dirty tree-killer!"

Also, 3x doesn't typically mean 10 minutes turns into 30 minutes.  I know it my case it means 50 minutes turns into 2.5 hours, each way. I would LOVE to take mass transit but there's no way I have time in my life to spend 25 hours a week commuting.
Most of us have issues.

Maybe you indulge too much in:

* Smoking

* Social Media

People who over indulge in food is just more visible than people with problems than can be every bit as significant.
>You are correct. Yet, even the Seattle Times constantly reports on increased housing values as if they drive up property taxes, which they do not.

No, actually that is not correct according to the [Washington State Department of Revenue.](https://dor.wa.gov/get-form-or-publication/publications-subject/tax-topics/funding-education)

>EHB 2242 temporarily changes the state levy from a budget-based system to a rate-based system. The rate for taxes due in 2018 through 2021 will be fixed at $2.70 per $1,000 of market value.



Also, that's just the state tax which is just one piece of the pie. There are also county, city and local levies all of which can also be rate based.

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/gmFPT) is my property tax profile from [King County's web site](http://blue.kingcounty.com/Assessor/eRealProperty/default.aspx)

Ugh, there is a very popular (12 books) Science Fiction series that is *AWFUL* about women.

>How modest is this modest home

Over $200,000 less than the median home price in Seattle

>and do you mean your second home that you use for income or the one where you actually live?

I'm not sure why this matters but it is my only home and I actually live in it.
Don't forget about the extra taxes we get to pay on these higher valuations.  I'm currently paying over $500 a month just in property tax for a modest home outside city limits.

Google Sheets.

So fast, so easy and it works so well.

* There are really useful things that require wizards, add-ins or Macros in Excel that are built into Google Sheets. Filter, Unique, Split, Join and  ImportRange are amazing and I miss them dearly when using Excel. You can also use SQL commands to manipulate data which is ridiculously powerful.
* Array Formula's work much better.  You can put an Array Formula in the top cell and have it automatically fill the entire column. For example, if I want to import Column F into Sheet two I just pop this formula in A1 on Sheet2 and I'm done.  =ArrayFormula('Sheet1'!F:F)  It's also really nice when combined with ImportRange where never know exactly how many rows there will be. 
* It uses Javascript instead of VB which is a vastly better language. 
* Real time collaboration works 100 times better than Excel using SharePoint.
* It's easy to setup triggers to have scripted processes run without any external involvement at all (it doesn't need to be open on your computer, google runs it on their servers)
* Linking sheets actually works!  Linking sheets in Excel is a nightmare that almost always ends up being more trouble than it's worth, especially when using that sheet on another computer.  With google it's 100% reliable.
* It's hugely scalable. I setup a process that had literally hundreds of sheets being updated daily all feeding into a master sheet that gave real time totals. 
* You never have to worry about somebody having the right version of Office, they only need a browser.
* It autocompletes trailing parenthesis without an error message!

The downsides of Google Sheets:

* Limited to 2 million cells per sheet. Though I'd argue that Excel sheets that get much larger than this get pretty "crashy" anyway
* Missing some of the more niche wizards and tools that Excel has.
* Excel has more tools for printing nicely.

My problem is when charities are more interested in raising money than they are in their actual mission.

I donated $100 to habitat to humanity and over the next 3 years I probably received my own body weight in junk mail from them. I gave them money to help people. I don't feel like I helped anyone. I just paid them to harass me and waste paper.

My interest level in giving them more money at this point is very low.
>The way we think about charity is dead wrong

Yeah, if the goal is to get bigger and raise money. Neither of those should be the end game of a charity. The end game is the mission they're supposed to be working towards.

This clown just wants "charity" to grow just for the sake of having bigger charities. Notice that never once in his almost 20 minute speech did he actually talk about specific good that could be done with this money. He just wants everyone to give more and more money so ass holes like him can get richer and run larger charities.

I put about 7 hours into Project Highrise. I really enjoyed it at first but as I got deeper in I realized how fundamentally flawed the gameplay is. The most profitable system in the entire game is the very first, most basic units you make. Everything else sucks in comparison. There is literally zero incentive to make anything except the most boring, basic towers possible. Imagine playing StarCraft and realizing there was no point of building your base because the best unit in the game was a zergling.

I have no idea what the game makers were thinking.

I don't get this at all. There are plenty of successful coaches at a professional level that are in poor shape.

How is it relevant?
As long as there is no consequence for companies losing all our data they're going to keep doing it.

Press releases are way cheaper than having proper security to begin with.

Notice how these companies that lose all our data aren't losing their own money. They actually care about keeping that secure.

Unless we care enough to actually boycott these companies or the government starts enacting real penalties for their incompetence our data is up for grabs.

Excel uses VBA which kind of sucks and has little value outside of Excel.  Google Sheets uses Javascript which is much more robust and is much more useful in general.
Considering this game has an average play time of over 88 hours I'd say this is still a pretty damn good value.

No, [Wearing a helmet while driving a car is dangerous](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/10552108/Wearing-a-helmet-while-driving-a-car-is-dangerous.html).

Do you have any other absurd straw men to throw my way?

The cyclist is an ass hole not because he wasn't wearing a helmet but because he'd gone through the trouble and expense of rigging up a dual camera video system and rode around cussing people out and picking fights so he could post his videos on youtube.
I don't know what your point is.  I don't give a shit if Republicans do worse in elections.

I also don't understand why you think that minorities would automatically support illegal immigration.
The US already brings in roughly a million immigrants a year.

Immigration in general is a very good thing but most people agree that it should have reasonable limits.  After all if you were to double the population in a year the infrastructure would not be able to support it and it would be miserable for everyone.
Oh, so driving with a suspended license is the same as driving 1 mile over the limit?

Let's further that fiction by pretending he's being deported because of a traffic stop right?

Except we all know he's not. He's being deported because he was caught living here illegally because he couldn't be bothered to do the paperwork.

So like I said, you've made it clear certain people should get to pick and choose what laws they comply with. Should he have to file his taxes every year?  That's just more paperwork and we know how he does with that!

Why don't you help us all out from up there on your high horse and let us know what laws "decent people" should be allowed to break without consequences.
Wow, you're really good at making up things people never said.

Sorry, he lost the safety argument when he prioritized having multiple cameras over wearing a helmet.

I'm perfectly willing to believe that it's possible for things to exist in the Universe that we could appropriately refer to as a "god".

They could be hybrid furnaces.  Use the reactor heat to get the metal up to 1,000 degrees then you only need to use electricity to heat it for the remainder so they'd only use 1/3 the electricity of a standard furnace.

From reading your post and the questions you're asking the LAST thing you need to do is go spend a bunch of money on a computer.

You sound like somebody who wants to take up running so you're asking about what shoes to buy, what outfits to buy, what heart rate monitor to get, whether you need a running belt that you can attach a water bottle to. You are entirely focused on the wrong thing.

You don't need any of that shit. If you want to run then run. Maybe you'll need some of that stuff down the road but you certainly don't need to spend hundreds/thousands to get started.

Buying a new computer isn't going to turn you into a programmer. Programming will make you a better programmer. You could do a ton of programming and web development on a $30 raspberry pi.

I have no idea why you are so apprehensive about using git on Windows. It sounds like you're trying to build up excuses to buy an expensive toy that you know you don't need. If you can't figure out how to run GIT then I have no idea how you'll ever become a developer.
Good. The program is heavily misused.

Instead of using it to bring in the best and brightest from around the world it's used to depress wages of US workers. The median H1B salary is about $80,000 a year which for a high tech worker in New York or the Bay Area is peanuts.

There are thousands of H1B's that are only paid $40,000 - $60,000 a year. Hardly an impressive wage for a supposedly high demand position requiring somebody to move from the other side of the planet to fill.

There are countless examples of US workers losing jobs to H1B workers, sometimes even being required to train their replacements, which was never supposed to happen.

The US already brings in roughly a million immigrants a year. We can afford to suspend a program like this until it can be restructured to stem the rampant abuse.

Honestly even that is for a relatively modest house that's going to require significant commute time depending on the city.

The median home price in Seattle is $700,000. Even if you paid $150,000 down payment you're still looking at $4,000 /month for the median home inside the city which is roughly $50,000 a year.
Certifications are in a really bad place.

They used to be tests of your knowledge and ability but that's completely changed.

People gamed the system and there was a growing number of "Paper" certs where the person didn't know the product at all, they just studied braindumps and passed the tests. In response to this the test makers have spent the last 20 years making the tests harder in an effort to keep them relevant.

What we're left with are terrible tests that focus on obscure fiddly minutia instead of your actual ability to use the product. Now, even people that use the products every day for their jobs can't pass them without studying test specific knowledge that has little to no value in the real world. Ironically this has made braindumps an even better and more relevant strategy for passing the tests.

For the most part certifications are little more than tests that prove your ability to take a test and not much more.

I few years back I got laid off and spent months looking for work.

My state has a very generous medicaid program for low income people. After losing my insurance at my previous employer I went to the website and honestly reported my income as $0.  Bam, free insurance. Once I got a new job (making $100k/year) I went back to the insurance web site and entered in my updated information. It said I of course made too much for the subsidized insurance but I could still continue to use it for one more year. One year of premiums at my new job was almost $10,000 so this was a huge savings.

I felt a little guilty about the whole thing because I clearly benefited from a system designed to help those in a much worse place financially than I am but ultimately I decided that if I'm being 100% honest with them and they still want to give me free stuff I'm not going to turn it down out of some sense of honor.
> your insurance that costs you about $2k/year

Hah!  It's way more expensive than that!

You're 32. It's not like you have to pick one thing to do or one lifestyle to live for the rest of your life.

Maybe you spend the next few years travelling.  Maybe after that you decide to start a business. If you're not enjoying it then quit and find a new passion. Maybe you just do contract work for a few months. We recently had somebody like that working in our office. He's got enough money saved up to cover all the basics. He then takes a contract job for a month or two and uses that money to go on month long trips around the world.

9-5+ is soul crushing when you have no choice but to do it for 40+ years of your life. Done in smaller chunks it can help you meet people and have interesting work experiences while helping you appreciate when it's over and you get to go back to doing whatever you feel like.

>It's got nothing to do with not taking personal responsibility or ingratitude. People in America are routinely bankrupted by medical bills. At 70+ years old, you think anybody is rebuilding their life after losing all their money?

I completely disagree with your sentiment.

In the US we spend hundreds of billions of dollars on people during their last few weeks of life. Think about that for a second, we're spending all that money and they die anyway.

It's a huge part of why healthcare in is so expensive here and most of the time all it accomplishes is pain and misery for the recipient.

So maybe if you're in your 70's and you haven't personally earned the money to pay for elaborate and extravagant medical procedures to extend your life a little longer you make your peace and move on instead of shitting up the world for everyone else.

The prof then acknowledged that he had purposefully never mentioned any of that content in class. He explained that the official class syllabus given out on first day of class had listed the chapters covered by the test as required reading material so it was our responsibility to have learned all that information.

Your post is much less an indictment of teaching as a profession and more about how your wife should try to be more organized, more thoughtful about what types of work she assigns and overall do a better job of managing her career so it doesn't impact her family life so heavily.
*shrug*

We can trade anecdotes I guess. This was not remotely the case at the school I worked at. Teachers were never there past a normal 8 hour day unless they were being specifically paid extra for it. In my personal experience they all had plenty of time to get all their work done at work. The ones that spent their downtime on Facebook and/or gossiping in the teachers lounge were the ones that usually took work home with them.

Also there are plenty of professions that don't make any more than a teacher and work longer hours, like accountants.
There are tons of awards and events to recognize teachers.  If you want more of that type of thing then start supporting those organizations and attending those award ceremonies.
I worked at a school for a couple years and was/am good friends with many teachers. 

What you've written has a kernel of truth but is *extremely* misleading. Sure maybe some of them will take a part time class. Yeah, most of them will spend a few solid days getting their class room ready. But to imply that teachers work all summer is just absolutely ridiculously false. Teachers *LOVE* their summer vacation. It's a huge part of why they chose to be teachers.

That Apple devices "just work".

I hear it over and over and over again and it's total bullshit. Ask anybody that's supported Macs in any capacity. They aren't magic, they have their problems just like any computer. They are expensive and well made computers so they have much fewer hardware problems than a shitty $400 Windows laptop but there is still plenty of software bullshit to go around.

As for "ease of use" putting a windows user in front of a Mac will leave them just as lost as putting a Mac user in front of a Windows computer.  Same for IOS and Android.

It's all just marketing.

I started this series as a teenager but finally fell off when the pace that they came out at dropped off. When the series was finally done I very much wanted to finish it but it had literally been 20 years since I'd read the first book so I knew I'd be totally lost and I knew I didn't have time in my life to read 10,000 pages.

What I did have in abundance was commuting time so it was audio books to the rescue!  I had a number of extended road trips for my job at the time on top of my long commute so I plowed through all 10 books in a little over a month (listening at 1.5 speed).

It was pretty great.

>The only problem is that with everything going on, and my 9-5 job, I really can't find time to take on side projects. I feel like my job is exhausting me, and I don't know what to do

Let's break it down:

* 1 hour to wake up, shower, shave, brush your teeth, eat breakfast, poop, dress etc.
* 1 hour driving to/from work (30 minutes each way).
* 8 hours working
* 1 hour unpaid lunch
* 1 hour to make/eat dinner, clean the dishes, get ready for bed, etc
* 8 hours to sleep

So without doing ANYTHING extra you've burned through 20 hours and have 4 hours left each day.

Start throwing in the realities of life like:

* a longer commute
* overtime
* going to the gym
* significant other
* kids
* pets

I just finished watching the Punisher series on Netflix. The dude gets shot or stabbed constantly and a few days later is right as rain.

Thanks for that link. I'm a little thrown off by that number since the comparison property I linked is already heavily booked through September and it's only early March right now.
> Well he is saying 130k gross.

No, I said $100k of revenue and $70k of profit.
>I'd also need to factor in cleaning fees, AirBnB (or similar) fees, wear and tear, maintenance, taxes, insurance.

All of that is already factored in.  Cleaning and AirBNB fees are charged to the guest as an additional cost on top of the $400/night. The base mortgage payment is $20,000 a year so I was factoring $10,000 for tear, maintenance, taxes and insurance.
I need a reality check here because this seems too good to be true.

*note* this is all hypothetical. I know nothing about these properties on than the links provided and currently live 3,000 miles away.


[This home](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/12089284?location=Myrtle%20Beach%2C%20SC%2C%20United%20States&s=O4I6BYpF&check_in=2018-07-16&guests=1&adults=1&check_out=2018-07-18) goes for over $400 a night on AirBNB and is almost fully booked all summer already. Obviously winter months are much less but peak times like spring break and Labor Day could see more like $600+ a night.

[This home](https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/Myrtle-Beach-SC/house_type/69575635_zpid/46666_rid/1.5-_baths/globalrelevanceex_sort/33.748822,-78.761072,33.627556,-78.945608_rect/12_zm/) seems better. Same area, distance to the beach, bedroom count but bigger and overall just nicer looking.

So, $30,000 grand a year in mortgage/taxes/upkeep should bring in around $100,000 a year in revenue.
Every rental has over a $100 cleaning fee on top of the rate so you'll easily pay for a maid service or clean it yourself and pocket an extra $1,000 a month.
Buy a house, [like this](https://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/house_type/11156823_zpid/1.5-_baths/0-200000_price/0-793_mp/globalrelevanceex_sort/33.841049,-78.694382,33.598606,-79.063454_rect/11_zm/) a couple miles away from the beach so it's much cheaper that way you can keep an eye on the rental and you can just stay there whenever it's not in use.
Meanwhile you're living on the $70,000 a year profit and slowing building equity.

Most Uber drivers don't factor in the additional wear and tear they are putting on their cars. Additional oil changes, tires, air filters, etc all add up.  Also, when you get a new car that value of your old one is going to be greatly reduced if you've driven 100,000 miles for Uber with it.

You were already gambling, not "investing".  Back in the late 90's during the dot com bubble I was "investing" very actively and was really successful. I turned $40,000 into $80,000 in less than a year. I thought I was pretty hot shit.

The secret to my success?  It was the right place and the right time. ***Everybody*** was making huge gains in the stock market then. I wasn't some financial genius outmaneuvering everyone. If I hadn't pulled most of the money out to make a down payment on a house I would have lost big time.

I would describe it as the quality of life of the middle class declining.

However, I'm not sure I agree with that. I feel like our standards keep going up.  Go back in time 40 years or so.  The average home size was over 1,000 square feet smaller than today. Kids sharing rooms was the norm. Eating out much less common. Most people had 1 TV, not 3-4. There were no computers, no internet, no mobile phones. 

Our expectations for "the bare minimum" have shot up dramatically.
I think it makes a lot more sense to define "middle class" as the median income rather than some very nebulous definitions as to what is "adequate" that vary greatly from person to person.

* Is a 15 year old car that runs well adequate?
* Is a 4 year old smartphone adequate?
* Is a low cost cell phone plan adequate?
* Is having plenty of food at home but almost never eating out adequate?

Some people define "middle class" as driving a new car, having a $1,000 phone and paying $100 a month for unlimited everything on it while spending hundreds of dollars a month eating out.

> 140k is rich?!

$140k means you make more money than 86% of households in the US.  That seems fairly rich.
> I'd say generally 60k is lower middle class

The median household income in the US is $59k so I think by definition $60k would be middle class.
> Plus, the damage done by baby boomers (economy wrecked)

By what metric is the economy wrecked?


Also, consider the cost.  In the US we spend hundreds of billions of dollars on people during their last few weeks of life. Think about that for a second, we're spending all that money and **they die anyway**.

It's a huge part of why healthcare in is so expensive here and most of the time all it accomplishes is pain and misery for the recipient.
As a hiring manager I feel like certifications show somebody has the drive and ambition to put some effort into their professional development rather than just show up for a job. They are definitely a "plus" in my book.

> They are in-charge of leading the company to success which is certainly not the responsibility of a low paid worker.

Yes, but does it really make sense to pay them hundreds of millions of dollars?
I 100% agree that the workload, stress and pressure of a typical CEO completely trivializes that most other employees in the company.

I also agree that CEO's deserve a very nice salary as compensation.

It's when these compensation packages start hitting many millions of dollars a year that I feel the system is being abused, especially when the company is under performing under their leadership.
I personally don't think focusing on pay ratios is the most productive way to go about working on this issue.  It's an arbitrary comparison that doesn't really make a lot of sense. People talk about capping CEO salaries need to really think about what the real world implications are.

A few examples:

* The CEO of a small fast food company with 10 restaurants would have the same salary cap as the CEO of McDonalds just because they both have minimum wage employees?  That doesn't really make sense.

* The CEO of a construction company could make much more than the the CEO of a retail store chain just because their employees require higher skill and therefore make a higher wage? Again, it doesn't really make sense.

I think the bigger issue here is that these CEO salaries are determined by boards of directors that are mostly made up of other CEO's from other companies. So these guys are all deciding how much each other get paid. It's a system just begging to be abused and results in CEO's that do a bad job getting fired and walking away with hundreds of millions of dollars.
> the golden parachutes are a little out of hand.

You did a terrible job and really hurt our company both financially and in the eyes of the public.  You're fired!  Now take this 70 million dollars and go!
100% agreed.  TBH it really hurt the movie for me to the point where I don't understand why people love it so much.

So many things are so extremely contrived. Like a bomb being smuggled into jail in such an obvious way that a simple pat down would have revealed it and then the explosion incapacitates every last person in the entire police station except the joker and the one guy the joker wanted.

I know these movies are fantasy but they should still *feel* plausible and that movie failed utterly at that.

I was laid off after being at a place almost 10 years. It took months of unemployment before landing another job. I was at that job less than a year when my department was "outsourced". Again had some very long months of unemployment before landing a new job.

I'll clarify why I put "0 crypto" in my post.

I'm not anti-crypto.  In fact I'm planning to speculate with a few thousand dollars because I think there is a lot of potential there.

I listed 0 crypto because it's a hugely volatile asset and most people who've found themselves as sudden crypto-millionaires on paper have found that it's actually extremely difficult to get larges sums of money out of crypto and into more conventional currency (dollars).

Therefore if somebody were to post their net worth as being 1/2 crypto I'd take it with a huge grain of salt because there is a very real chance that even if they started right now they couldn't actually cash out all that currency before the value plummeted.

Both the employee and the employer pay a premium on every paycheck that pays for unemployment insurance.

Once you are let go from a company (without cause) you are eligible to apply for benefits which amounts to a few hundred dollars a week for a period of 6 months. During this time you have to submit weekly reports of your active job search.

The company doesn't have to pay anything extra unless something big happens like they lay of hundreds of people. In those special cases the government will often ask them to pay extra.
This isn't a hammer.  It's a slap. It stings but that's about it.

I'm extremely disappointed that no one is going to jail over this. They flouted the law, hurt millions of people then when whistle blowers tried to bring it to light they fired them AND black listed them so they couldn't get a job anywhere else either.

It's absolutely disgusting and they got away with it.
At some point you need to get another job and your work experience consists of nothing that you want to talk about in an interview for a real job...
I actually found some peace in the realization that the best thing I could do to hurt the company was exactly what I was told to do because it was so fucking stupid...
> Was your real job title punching bag for your asshole boss?

Several people at that job who saw how she treated me used almost those exact words...
and yet she was shocked and dismayed when I gave my notice...
She was the owner. There was no hierarchy. She was everyone's direct supervisor because she could not give up any amount of control and had to micromanage everything.

It did not work well.
> I could literally go on for hours about how much I hated my last job.

I'll give one story for fun.

In a team meeting I mentioned an idea I had for how we could do things better by having peers review each other.

After the meeting she came to my office and ripped into me for "undermining her authority" by suggesting an idea in a meeting without talking to her about it first. The next day I had a meeting with her and HR. I was told that I was being moved from the campus I was at and would now be in a campus 10 miles away in a back windowless closet full of random shit behind the copy machine. (I was not allowed to remove the crap)

In addition to this my new primary responsibility was to inventory every electronic device at that campus (the computers were already inventoried, this was for everything BUT computers). Every patch cable, mouse, power strip, hell I even inventoried Christmas lights. I was forbidden from throwing anything away so when I found a box labelled "bad cables" I had to test all 20-30 USB cables, verify they didn't work, then inventory them and put them back in the box. Also, she didn't want to pay for labels so nothing was marked in any way so there was no way to tie anything back to the inventory. I tried explaining that this list would be absolutely worthless but was smacked down for that. It was the equivalent of being forced to dig holes, fill them back in, then dig them again. The kind of psychological torture you use to break prisoners. I was paid a six figure salary for this work...
I'm not sure exactly what your point is. I'm no fan of Trump and I certainly think Presidents get way more credit than they should for market movement but since Trump has taken office the market has been doing extremely well.  Even with this minor correction it's up 25% from a year ago...
I could literally go on for hours about how much I hated my last job. My boss was insane and would go out of her way to belittle and berate me on a daily basis. Every time I'd manage to mentally brace myself and think I'd figured out a way to deal with the suck she'd come up with some new way to fuck with me. I stayed because it paid well and I was the sole provider for my family.

I got a new job about 5 months ago and honestly in hindsight I wish I'd quit earlier and just been unemployed.

It stressed me out to the point it was impacting my health and hurting my relationships with my friends and family. It was turning me into somebody I didn't like.

I'm honestly still recovering from that job mentally and physically all these months later. Depression and anxiety suck.

How many people are actually using bitcoin right now?  Maybe 1 in 10,000, the vast majority of them being speculators?

Once a currency actually becomes mainstream wild swings like this should be extremely unlikely.
> Bitcoin isn't an alternative to the banks, it's an alternative to Visa.

No, sorry, not even close.

Bitcoin can handle a handful of transactions a second. Visa does many thousands of transactions a second. Also, now that bitcoin has gotten more popular transaction fees have skyrocketed to $20 - $30. Who's gonna pay that kind of fee to order a pizza?  These are due to fundamental limitations of bitcoin and are never going to get better.

I think Cryptocurrency is the future but there's no way it's going to be bitcoin.

Sometimes in these sorts of situations if you ask the answer is "no" but if you don't ask then nobody really minds since it's visibility for the game but they haven't officially given the rights away to some guy on the Internet thus preventing a future deal with Hasbro someday.

>this sub is very anti-real estate

I don't agree with that. I can't think of a single time I've seen anyone here post that real estate is always a bad idea. I've repeatedly seen people posting about how real estate is a "no-brainer" method for passive income which brings out people like me that feel the need to point out some things to be aware of like:

1. Anyone that thinks owning and maintaining 10 properties doesn't require any work is going to have a bad time.
2. Rental properties are very area dependent. In HCOL areas it can be nearly impossible to make the numbers work.
3. Like any investment there is real risk involved.
4. Everyone loves to talk about success stories but nobody likes to bring up the failures  I personally know two people that rented houses in the past and both have vowed they would never do it again. Perhaps they "did it wrong" but that just further proves that point that it's important for people to go into this with their eyes open.

> Buy a duplex and rent out the other half, your tenant will be paying for your mortgage.

**NOTE:** This only works in the right markets.  I know where I live this is a pipe dream.
I realize it's just a joke but your starting premise is that over half of everyone in the US is retired? That's pretty obviously nonsense.

Sorry, doesn't work for me.
> It will get you debt that will off-set any additional income the degree may earn you, so it's really a wash.

Do you first two years at a community college and finish at a state University.  Grand total should be under $30,000.  If you can live with your parents while doing it and work part time you can finish your degree with zero debt.
Well, it was a Four Seasons so it was a few hundred a night to stay longer.  It was also on one of the smaller islands and the resort wasn't near anything so I thought 3 days of hanging out on the beach 1/2 the time would be plenty.
I agree.  If you want 10 hour days of meetings let's do it at the local Marriott and not waste 12 hours travelling.
Once had a job where they flew a bunch of us to Hawaii for three days of meetings and spouses were welcome!

They ran the meetings 10+ hours a day with a mandatory company dinner every night.

I barely saw the beach, or my wife the entire time.

> Not 'I want to write a book', when you never wrote at home. If you didn't do it before you retired, the odds are you aren't suddenly going to when you retire, it's just something you THINK you want to do

I think that's fair to a point. I'm gone at work 50-60 hours a week with my long commute. Throw in 3 kids and a house to take care of and I can count my hours of spare time every week on one hand.
I wonder how much of this is skewed by the people who spend thousands of dollars a year (or even month) on F2P currency.

If you're a Windows 10 shop just let it update itself and move on to higher value tasks...
I think the big problem is that very few companies go "all-in" on OSX which means you're left with a baker's dozen of Execs and other special little butterflies that you end up supporting. You're then stuck with the following options:

1. Invest a huge amount of time and effort into "free" options
2. Buy Jamf and invest a moderate amount of time and effort
3. Do everything with them manually

Most places end up going with option 3 which sucks and make people not like Mac's in the workplace.

If companies really want high reliability with low support cost and easy management they'd be working towards Chromebooks but then half of us would probably be out of a job.

> Dude are you really concerned about the factual legitimacy of a movie that was set in the Middle Ages but also has choreographed dance scenes to David Bowie?

This isn't really much sillier than most medieval movies. The classical music they are rife with is not remotely era appropriate.

For example, [this famous scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3cXcS49D64) that takes place around roughly 500 AD features music written in 1936.

Within that context a movie taking place in the 1300's using music from 1976 is actually much closer to the mark.

There's only so much you can plan for.

There are countless possibilities for what the next 30-50 years could look like.  Maybe the stock market will average 20% returns. Maybe there will be a universal basic income so we won't care what the returns are. Maybe computers surpass humans in intelligence and capability then all bets are off.

What are you going to do?

* Put all your money in gold? What if SpaceX puts an asteroid in near earth orbit that's made up of a few hundred thousand tons of gold?
* Sharecrop in a commune? What if our robotic overlords don't put up with that hippy bullshit?

When it comes to the stock market specifically I strongly feel that the kinds of drastic, long term outcomes you are considering are so significant that if it actually came to pass the last thing you're going to be worrying about is your rate of return. That kind of drastic economic shift in our country would be catastrophic and would likely result in closure of the stock market altogether and probably asset forfeiture in a United States that would more resemble [the movies](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082340/) more than our present day reality.

Have any of you ever tried working in a professional capacity in Hawaii?  It's mind boggling.

I worked at a company that had a couple small offices in Hawaii. I'd scheduled with the only IT provider on the island in question to get some simple IT work done. The soonest I could get on their calendar was two weeks out.

The day finally came and they never showed.  I called, I emailed, finally 3 days later they called me back.

It's important to not focus only on what the current rental cost is.

Let's say that your mortgage payment on your house is $5,000/month and a rent payment for something similar is $4,000.

In 20 years your mortgage payment will still be $5k but your rent will likely be closer to $8k.

Unless your market is crazy (which some markets totally are) if you plan to be in the same place for 20+ years I think purchasing almost always makes the most sense.

Because only 4 countries in the world spend more per student than the US.  Meanwhile we are 36th in student outcomes.

While I think what you're saying has merit this post is titled "Best of 2017" and Factorio is listed several of the links the OP posted. I felt this thread specifically was about our best gaming experiences of 2017 that we would recommend to others as being a great value.

I'm aware, that the sale can make a lot of money in a short period of time, but I believe that it is not worth it in the long run, and since we are not in financial pressure we can afford to think in the long run. We don't like sales for the same reason we don't like the 9.99 prices. We want to be honest with our customers. When it costs 20, we don't want to make it feel like 10 and something. The same is with the sale, as you are basically saying, that someone who doesn't want to waste his time by searching for sales or special offers has to pay more.

Typically I turn them down in some way.  At first I'd make them very rare, then later left them at default but turn the evolution rate down so I have some more time before they start cranking out the nasty behemoths. My most recent game map (maybe 5-10 hours in) was left at defaults across the board.

While it is shitty that these super rich companies like Google and Apple to avoid paying billions of dollars in taxes they are merely fulfilling their fiduciary duty to their shareholders to maximize profits.

It's up to the governments to change the laws to stop this kind of crap from continuing.
Unfortunately it's really hard to have any sort of real discussion about teachers on Reddit.

Unless it's worshipping teachers as some sort of diety even the most sane, logical and researched posts get down voted.

I worked with teachers for years. I have good friends who are teachers. Like most of us they have a job with upsides and downsides but they are still just people and it's still just a job.
I'm not exaggerating anything.

I've never heard of a school district that didn't have three months off between summer, winter, mid-winter and spring break.


* Attorneys making "the big bucks" work FAR more hours than a teacher.
* If you factor in 3 months of vacation the OP's salary is higher than that of the median attorney.
* I worked at a school for years and saw many teachers invest HUGE amounts of time into gossip and Facebook during their planning periods only to complain about taking work home. The ones who actually worked at work almost never worked over a 40 hours week.

No, there isn't.  We could hit all the populated areas but not even close to everything.
I typically give cops the benefit of the doubt in a lot of these cases but the cop barking orders in that video should 100% be in jail.

His actions were completely bizarre and unnecessary. He caused the death of an innocent man because he is bad at his job.
If you're planning to stay put for 10+ years I think buying is almost always better than renting unless there's something really wonky with the housing market in that area.
I'm curious, how do you think you'd feel if the whole experience if you'd come home after the first camp?

I can't imagine sending my kids off to a camp but I do think a 15 year old coming home at 2 AM high and drunk needs some serious intervention.

There's actually no great mystery or conspiracy here.

* In 1970 the median house was 1500 square feet

* In 1990 the median house was 1900 square feet

* In 2014 the median house was 2500 square feet

Adjusted for inflation the price per square foot for new houses from 1973 to 2013 hasn't moved much at all.  In fact, it's actually gone down a little. [SOURCE](http://www.aei.org/publication/todays-new-homes-are-1000-square-feet-larger-than-in-1973-and-the-living-space-per-person-has-doubled-over-last-40-years/)

TLDR: People like to live in large, spacious houses and it costs more money to do so.



I certainly have responsibility and latitude far beyond help desk but it's pretty common for the executives to feel they are too important for the help desk and instead require the assistance of somebody at a much higher level in the organization.

I don't understand the uncritical love BOTW gets.  I mean, it's a good game but it's not the 100/100 masterpiece that everyone seems to think it is.

Did everyone forget how boring and monotonous climbing is?  Did everyone not realize that half the shrine "challenges" are garbage? Did people actually feel weather brought anything to the gameplay? Do people enjoy taking out camps of enemies only to be rewarded with absolute garbage?

IMHO Horizon Zero Dawn beats it handily is graphics, gameplay and story.
Also, stay close when your flight is delayed.

I was at my gate on time and the flight was delayed 2 hours.  Wandered off to chill some other place for an hour.  Came back, they'd decided to use another plane, loaded it and took off already.

**TLDR**:  
Comcast enrolled people in a worthless "protection plan" by telling people it was free when it was only free for the first month.

The plan is worthless because doesn't actually cover anything. Comcast is already responsible for their own equipment/cables and even with the plan they will not touch wiring that's in the wall. That leaves basically nothing.
Does any of this take Social Security or Medicare into account?

An extra $20,000 a year and free health insurance once you hit 65 seems like it'd let even the unluckiest portfolio recover.
Yes, that's why I said the government fucked it up...
I'm 100% in favor of socialized healthcare.  The problem is how bad our government has managed to fuck it up. Obamacare gave the entire middle class:

* Drastically higher premiums
* Drastically higher deductibles
* Much worse coverage
* Record profits for insurance companies

How about we change the law so there's no such thing as exemption from overtime unless your salary is in the top 10% of all income earners? Currently this is about $135,000 a year.

10 years ago I'd buy an OEM copy of Office for $180 and leave it for the life of the computer (5 years).  That way nobody ever really got much past one version behind the rest so there was never significant compatibility issues and cost broke out to roughly $35 a year.  

Now I'm supposed to think it's a bargain to spend more than 4 times that amount?  Multiply that out by 500 users and you're talking about $17,500 a year in office licenses vs $75,000 a year.
Then you hear about the guy who tried to murder his own child and in the process significantly maimed him, then when sentenced to prison ran to another state and hid for several years.

I punched my work address into Zillow then zoomed out so that the map encompassed over 100 square miles. Then I set the search criteria to houses under $600,000.

Zero results.

Some people are just bigger than others.  I did one of those body comp tests where you float in a water tank and I have over 200 pounds of lean body mass so even if I was at very athletic build of 10% body fat I'd still weigh 220-225.  I'm 6'3" so I'm tall but nothing crazy.  I'm just big.
Go look at some houses, get a few hundred bucks, get to be on TV.  Doesn't sound like a ton of downside to it.
> Prices be crazy.

I pointed Zillow at the place I work in and zoomed pretty far out so the map covered roughly 100 square miles. Then I told it to search for any houses under $700,000.  

One result.  A butt ugly 70 year old 1,480 sqft house for $650,000.

This is why I commute an hour each way...

I think it's significantly different to forcibly put your finger on the reader vs just pointing a camera at you from across the table.
You guys are 47 with no kids and have such spotty employment history that you're not even on track for the lowest possible SS payments?  Basically you haven't been able to cram 10 years of working into almost 30 years of being an adult.

>Network, network, network. No one likes it, everyone has to do it.

I hear this advice all the time but I have a real hard time with it.

When I got laid off a few years back I networked my ass off. I dug deep into the pool of past friends, co-workers, vendors, etc. I chatted on the phone, I met for coffee, I met them in their office, I went to meet-ups, I went to happy hours, I asked friends to introduce me to to people that worked at places i was applying to.

Exactly ***nothing*** came of any of it. I don't even mean a job. None of this effort even got me so much as a damn phone interview.


I finally got a job the old fashioned way, applying online with a good resume and cover letter.
How can anyone that spends $4,000 on a TV consider themselves "poor"?
Well you put this up to be judged so I'm gonna judge it.

* I *hate* the ugly, plastic, uncomfortable looking chairs sitting at that cool wood table.
* The hanging chair is possibly the ugliest thing in the room and you put it smack in the middle as the showcase.  All this leather and wood and the prime showpiece looks like dream catchers woven together with yarn with gaudy colors that match nothing else in the room.
* WTF is with the 3/4 scale fake door mounted on the wall next to the opening to the hallway.  It's bizarre.
* OMG, so much clutter.  It's OK to have a flat surface exist without covering it with shit.
* TV over the fireplace is terrible and nobody should ever do it.

If this room were mine I think the table is the only thing I'd keep.
> I currently spend about $1K/month

I can't even imagine what that'd be like.  Hell, that barely covers health care premiums for my family.
You need to change the sheet variable to reflect the other sheet names.  The proper way to do this would be to define an array with the sheet names you'll use and call this function with a FOR loop that inserts each sheet name from the array and runs this function.

The stupid, lazy, fast way is what I just pasted below.

    
    function clearOrange() {
      var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActive().getSheetByName('Top Airway');
      var range = sheet.getDataRange();
      var bgColors = range.getBackgrounds();
      for (var i=0; i<bgColors.length; i++) {
        for (var j=0; j<bgColors[i].length; j++) {
          if (bgColors[i][j] === '#efefef') {
            range.getCell(i+1,j+1).clearContent();
          }
        }
      }
      var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActive().getSheetByName('Sheet 2');
      var range = sheet.getDataRange();
      var bgColors = range.getBackgrounds();
      for (var i=0; i<bgColors.length; i++) {
        for (var j=0; j<bgColors[i].length; j++) {
          if (bgColors[i][j] === '#efefef') {
            range.getCell(i+1,j+1).clearContent();
          }
        }
      }
      var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActive().getSheetByName('Sheet 3');
      var range = sheet.getDataRange();
      var bgColors = range.getBackgrounds();
      for (var i=0; i<bgColors.length; i++) {
        for (var j=0; j<bgColors[i].length; j++) {
          if (bgColors[i][j] === '#efefef') {
            range.getCell(i+1,j+1).clearContent();
          }
        }
      }
    }
My biggest reason for wanting to retire is stress reduction and I don't think living on a tight budget that severely limited my leisure activities would accomplish that...

I totally disagree. He was screaming and escalating the situation for absolutely no good reason. He was giving him conflicting instructions and making him do completely unnecessary actions.

He was laying on the ground with his hands behind his head.  Just walk 10 feet over and cuff him instead of playing the world's most fucked up game of Simon Says.

Indian reservations are 3 percent which has nothing to do with what I stated.

The average home price in Kirkland is over [$700,000.](https://www.zillow.com/kirkland-wa/home-values/)

No, I'm saying that most ideas aren't remotely as good as they might first appear and you should spend some time doing some research and planning before you even consider creating a product.

* Who is your target audience?
* How big is your target audience?
* How much will they pay?
* Is it one time or recurring income?
* How will you stand out from the millions of other apps out there?
* How much ongoing support will be required?
* How much can you afford to spend on development and still turn a profit?
* What's your budget to pay for advertising?
* How much time do you have to dedicate to this project?
* Are you going for IOS? Android? Both?

So, for example, if you make an app that sells for $1 and you sell 100,000 copies. That's pretty huge success for a first app from a new company. That means minus the app store cut you just made $65,000. Did you pay for advertising to get your app noticed? (It's almost impossible to get noticed on the very crowded app store without doing this) Do you need to license 3rd party services to make the app work? Do you need to buy tools to build the app? Did you form an LLC for the company? Did you hire a lawyer? Did you pay taxes on that income?  That original $100,000 is looking a lot closer to $30,000.

All that and you haven't even started figuring out how much it's going to cost to have the app created.


I had a great idea for a startup.  

I did some actual research and planning and found out there was a reason nobody had done the idea I'd come up with.  It was a lot of work for not all that much return.
When I finished this series I immediately started over on the first book and went through the entire trilogy again.

IMO having a bachelor's degree is as important now as having a high school diploma was 20 years ago. The modern job market is such that unless you have some very unique skills people are looking for you can expect your resume to be up against 50-100 other candidates. There is no way employers are going to interview remotely that many people so their first job is to eliminate as many people as possible. A college degree is a really easy criteria to use to cut the size of their stack of resumes to something more manageable.

Cost wise, if you play it smart you can come with out of it with no, or minimal debt, especially if you're able to live at home during the process.

For the first two years work while you're going to community college then transfer to a state school. Community college is something like $2,000 a year and state school is something like $10,000 a year. That's a grand total of $24,000. With the savings you've already accrued in high school and working while you're going to college it is very reasonable to graduate with zero student debt.

Fuck you.

> The game stayed at a higher price ($30-40) for up to a year or two after its initial release.

Nope, it was $12.49 on Steam about 4 months after release (July 2013)

>Tomb Raider 2013 has sold 11 million units

Is that really that impressive for a AAA game when it:

* Is currently on Steam for $3.99
* Has been in multiple Humble Bundles
* Has been on sale at Amazon for $1.74
* Has a fully loaded GOTY edition for $4.49

Any halfway decent AAA game is going to have those kinds of sales numbers if you're practically giving it away.

I dunno, a normal guy suddenly weighing over 400 pounds would be pretty rough. The strain on your heart would be immense.
I think you make a good point but I would like to point out another variant.

The last 5 years of my life have sucked from a work perspective. Multiple layoffs, long bouts of unemployment, getting a degree while working full time, being stuck at a job I ***HATED*** so much it was seriously impacting my health. It has fucked with my head and severely pummeled my confidence. Something as simple as my boss asking me to come to their office causes the stomach dropped feeling of "oh shit am I going to be fired" even though my boss thinks I'm doing a great job.  Prior to both my layoffs I'd been told I was doing a great job...


I'm doing much better now and have a new job I enjoy but for my own sanity I need to be in a position where I don't need a job so I don't find myself in the shitty position that I've spent the last 5 years of my life.
I developed a new criteria for game purchases that seems to be working well for me.

I only buy a game if I'm going to play it right now. It seems so simple and obvious but it's saved me hundreds of dollars on games that I'm certain I never would have actually played.
Personally, I'd go to two advisers and pay them for their proposed strategies.  If they are very similar I'd go for it. If they are significantly different I'd ask each adviser to critique the other's proposal and explain why their plan was better.

A couple thousand dollars spent now making sure you have a solid plan is chump change compared to what's at stake.
This post resonated strongly with me.  I lost 100 pounds and kept it off for over a year. I was so sick of being hungry ALL THE TIME. It never went away unless I ate too much which then made me feel like a piece of shit for overeating.

It made me cranky all the time and I was tired of obsessing all the time about what I ate.
The massive food abundance we have today is a new thing for our species.

Your grandparents did not grow up under an avalanche of super cheap super tasty food.
> or are overinsured

IMO most people are drastically under insured when it comes to car insurance.

If you are at fault in a car accident and send the other person to the hospital that $50,000 of coverage is going to go real quick and your retirement fund is next up on the chopping block.
Thank you very much.  One more quick question, what's the best way to turn it off?  Can I just put a "no" in front like on Cisco?
>I'm not sure how conservative I should be with my investment growth...

The S&P 500 has averaged 10% annual returns since its inception back in 1928.

I think planning for 7% returns is very conservative.
More like he's want 99.999% probability instead of 95%.
> Is this possible? And if so, how?

Most of the time it's not possible.  401k is designed to only accept deposits as a deduction from your paycheck.  it's possible for companies to allow deposits outside of your paycheck but most don't do it.

To find out for sure you'd need to ask your payroll department at your company.
Almost worse is when you go through an area killing dozens if not hundreds of guards then it goes to a cut screen where 4 guards surround you so you immediately surrender.

Yes, you could do this with an IF statement in your script.

I think judges would have been great for an optional series of battles but I don't feel like they belong in the main story at all.
Even worse are all the ones that never even give you an interview.
Personally?  My threshold would probably be 40%.  Anything less than that isn't worth the effort on my part.

I don't care about missing out.  "Missing the boat" in this case means the vast majority of my investments that have been in mutual funds the entire time have gone up in value.
Take what you expect your annual expenses to be after you retire.  Subtract 75% of your current "take home" salary from that number. Take the remainder and multiply it by 25.  That's how much your ROTH (and other savings) should be.

That's fair but if that market is at 14K and you buy when it falls to 10K, even if it keeps falling to 8K you're still doing pretty well a few years later when it's at 16k.
If you kept $100,000 in bonds then when something like the 2008 correction happens and the market literally drops 1/2 it's value you get a job to pay the bills and dump that whole $100,000 into the market you'll come out way, way ahead.
I think the real key is to keep 2-3 years worth of living expenses outside the market (buy bonds instead).  That way when there's a big drop you start living off that money instead to give your stocks time to go back up.

If you do that 4% will be overkill for anything short of global catastrophe, at which point all bets are off anyway.

> TBF, millions live in poverty and/or are legitimately unlucky and have an enormous wall to climb to get to those goals. Always have to remember how fortunate most of us on this sub actually are, regardless of the hard work we put into meeting our goals.

The hard part for me is seeing poor people make terrible decision after terrible decision then throw up their hands like they have no idea why they are poor.

I grew up lower-middle class. I moved across the country 2 weeks after graduating high school to a place 2,000 miles from anyone I knew. I lived in a disgusting shit hole 1B apartment, with a roommate. There were times I lived on literally bread and water (dumb, but I was 18 and didn't know better). I worked three minimum wage jobs while putting myself through school. There was never a time that I didn't have 3 months worth of expenses saved up (not that hard when your expenses are <$500 a month).

When I see poor people coasting from paycheck to paycheck with the latest iPhone on a $100/month Verizon plan, eating out all the time, driving newer cars, living in a place they can't really afford, etc, etc, etc  all the bullshit you see all the time I really have a hard time sympathizing with them.

This anecdote is no more valuable than claiming lottery tickets are a good investment because you have a relative that won once.

>Property can be sold

Real estate has the highest transaction cost of pretty much any investment. I can sell a $2.5 million investment in mutual funds for zero transaction costs.  For a $2.5 million dollar home you're going to be paying realtors well over $100,000 in fees.

>used to make money by rent

One of the biggest PITA ways to make money with an investment.  My mutual fund has never called me at 9 PM on a Sunday evening because it's water heater is leaking.

>and you always have the house at the end, so you likely won't lose money unless you paid too much yourself.

Plenty of people have gotten upside down on mortgages when markets declined. Ask anyone who bought a house in 2007...

Also, let's not forgot that this is a real physical thing that is going to wear out over time and require expensive maintenance like painting, roofing, plumbing, etc.

I would like to point out the safety factor that is almost totally dismissed in this type of discussion.

[THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ttkVRwOtVE) video shows a 1998 car crashing into a 2015 car.  Skip to 2:30 to see the interior.

The older car is certain death while the new car looks like you'd walk away.
> That’s a sunk cost fallacy. A better rule of thumb might be, “work that exceeds the cost of buying a new car”.

Disagree.

The value of the car is presumably what you could purchase the same (operational) vehicle for.

Replacement cost would be for a superior vehicle that would have substantial advantage over the current model.  (Better safety, better mileage, fewer repairs needed).

Let's say you have a 15 year old car that would ideally be worth $4,000.  By your logic it would make more sense to spend $15,000 repairing that car instead of buying a nearly new replacement for $18,000.

That does not make sense to me at all.

If the market is in a good spot when you need the money you just sell. This would only be relevant if the market already cratered.
Brokerage firms are pre-setup to loan you money. There is typically no process or paperwork or fees involved (except interest of course). You just take out the money like it's in your account. The limit is typically 50% of what your current investments total.  This means if you take out the whole 50% and your stocks keep falling they may ask you to pay some back.
> Quitting was very hard. When you have a high income, the One More Year syndrome is quite strong. It was really a "one more quarter" syndrome, since partners get paid quarterly. This is why I worked for about two more years after I was actually financially independent.

I barely make over $100k and the "just one more year" siren calls to me.  I can only imagine what it was like for you.
This crowd should have a sizable amount in their brokerage accounts.  Even in a downturn you can pull cash out on a margin basis (up to 50% of your investments) and pay a pretty darn reasonable interest rate on it. (7-8%)

If you've got a few hundred thousand invested that means you could live for years on that margin money without having to sell anything.
> So I keep everything invested.

What do you mean by "everything"?  Do you not have a savings account at all?  Do you actively work to keep your checking account as close to zero as possible?
I hear you.  I've been laid off twice in the last 5 years and having a nice little pile of cash is of great psychological benefit to me and my wife.  One thing I'd suggest if you're not doing it already is having it in a money market account (Capital One offers 1.3% right now) instead of a regular savings account. It's safe, FDIC insured and most regular savings accounts offer practically nothing so even 1% means making a few hundred extra bucks a year.
That man would have failed at any business.  Who the fuck would just shut down their business for a week without even bothering to figure out if they can afford to do it first?

Has he never heard of a spreadsheet?
He's still fucking clueless.  Even at the very end of the article where he's lost everything and is up to his eyeballs in debt he still chose to rent an apartment he can barely afford so his kids can have their own rooms.
Yeah, that $3,000 he spent on the lawyer was one of the few things he actually did right IMO.

> From a financial perspective, the only number that matters is your saving rate -- the difference between your earning and spending.

I've got to disagree with you there.  My wife had a 401k that was in a shitty mutual fund that was charging 2% in fees. 2% over time is an incredible difference. Basically her total money after 20 years would have been **50% higher** if it had just been in a basic index fund.
This sub is very pro rental properties so I guess I shouldn't be surprised you were downvoted but I completely agree with you.

Standard index funds average 10% annual returns so if they sold the property and paid off the mortgage they'd be averaging $25,000 a year of compounding growth.  In 10 years that'd be $550,000.

Instead they are getting $9,600 a year and incurring the risks that come with home ownership.
My last job was the worst job I ever had. I could go on for days about the crazy shit I put up with. I found a new job, gave 1 week notice and moved on leaving them with documentation and passwords for everything. A couple weeks later I was logging into Meraki and accidentally clicked on my old cached credentials from that last job.  They worked. Out of curiosity I tried office 365 and a few other things and sure enough they hadn't reset a single one of my passwords. I confess I was a little tempted to mess with them in some minor way just to make them scramble a bit.

You know what I did? Not one fucking thing. That shit is illegal and that shit hole of a company isn't worth me putting my ass on the line.

401k limits are over 3 times what IRA limits are ($18,000 vs $5,500).

Why don't we bring both IRA and 401k to $12,000 so we don't have half the population arbitrarily punished by a decision that is out of their control?

There are all sorts of things that can make a 2% difference in wages. I'd be willing to bet height could impact it this much. You should study whether men under 5'8" are paid less.
You really think 2% is significant? We're talking about the difference of making $21.36 an hour or $21.78 an hour.

When you get into differences that small you start getting all sorts of reasons that are very difficult to control for like height or what letter your first name starts with.
> There are so many studies showing that a small, but significant,

No, stop right there.  After controlling for education and experience the difference is around 2-3%.  That is  ***NOT*** significant.

I personally think Nintendo gets 5-10 bonus points just for being Nintendo.

I own a Switch along with Zelda. It's certainly not a bad game, but it's not the mind blower that reviewers give it credit for.  There are a number of things about the game that in my opinion warrant a rating maybe 10 points under where Metacritic sits with it.  For example:

* Cooking is a HUGE part of the game and the process is extremely obtuse, slow and cumbersome. It's a chore, it's not fun.
* Weather adds little to the game but frustration. The biggest example of that is when you need to climb something to get to your next objective and it just happens to be raining which makes it nearly impossible to climb. Most of the time your best bet in this situation is to just put down the controller for 10 minutes and go make yourself a snack. That's not interesting and it's not fun.
* Weapon durability is a valid design choice (though I'm not a huge fan personally) but their implementation is excessive. A weapon will typically last 2-3 enemies before breaking.  I'm not talking about big boss type enemies. I'm talking about the basic random guys. Also, you can only hold 5-6 weapons at a time. It's not fun.
* This game wants you to climb ALL THE TIME.  Including towers you have to unlock that require lots of climbing. Unfortunately climbing is slow and boring. You just sit there and hold the controller in one direction for what feels like forever.  It's not fun.
* Some of the puzzle dungeons are great.  Others are obviously filler. Some are just tedious like one that you can't solve without travelling (and climbing) to another dungeon to get the solution then travelling all the way back.  It's not tricky or interesting, it's tedious.  It's not fun.
* The game's graphics are fine but very simple. Other games like Horizon Zero Dawn blow this game out of the water.
* Combat is tuned so that you very often die in 1-2 hits. That's fine except that the controls are nowhere near as tight as they are in a game like Dark Souls. Parries, dodges and other reaction type moves feel sloppy and related to luck as much as skill.

I do want to reiterate that I'm not saying it's a bad game at all.

**My point is that if this exact same game had been released for the PS4 as a new IP and made no mention of Link, Zelda or Gannon it's score would have been 10 points lower.**
If you have some specific questions people are typically willing to help but if you're just expecting somebody to spend dozens or hundreds of hours creating a complete system for you for free I think you're expectations aren't very realistic.

I work in a *very* expensive city.

* We are a single income family so that $125,000 number in the blog would be closer to $65,000.
* Moving close enough to work to shorten my commute to 15 minutes would cost about $500,000.
* Even if we downsized significantly (hard with 3 kids) it would still cost an additional $200,000.
I work in one of the most expensive cities in the world.  My house that's an hour away it still costs almost half a million dollars.

Were I to buy a similar house within a 15 minute drive to work it would double or triple that cost.
I commute an hour each way.  Add in 8 hours of work and an hour lunch break and I'm out 11 hours a day.  Throw in 8 hours of sleep, an hour for showering/shaving/dressing/etc and an hour for breakfast/dinner and I'm down to 3 hours of actual free time a day.

3 hours.

> The cost of taking her to small claims court.

This is not expensive. Typically it's like $20-$30.  You don't need to make a police report to sue her for the damages.

Yeah, I once worked for a nursing home company and some of them are real shit holes, even within the same company.

I'd say buy stocks anyway.  Timing the market is a fantasy.  You think the market is due for a correction so you put your money in a bond making 4%.  Meanwhile the market is doing 13% for the next five years before the correction hit.  Even after the correction you still came out way ahead.

What does only having 1 year of law having to do with presenting idiotic arguments that make absolutely no sense?

Having no experience would play itself out as to not knowing the specific rules of the court of the minutia of relevant case law.  What she did was act like a moron bringing up things that were not even remotely relevant to the case.

Really? I feel like the episodes are written by 10 year olds.

The episode where they were in court was almost painfully bad.

I won't bother repeating the good advice given here by others.  I will suggest that you take the $70k they spent on your SO's education and DO NOT pay it back right now while they are in full "spend" mode.  Rather, set it aside so that when shit does go south and they run out of money you can give it to them then as part of a plan to downsize their lives.

If even at that point they won't listen to reason then make it extremely clear that you are 100% done assisting them financially, even if that means they are on the street. Giving them money at that point is no more helpful than given money to a drug addict who refuses treatment.
Maybe you're not old enough to remember what a shitshow buying digital music used to be but it was fucking awful. Everything was DRM to shit, you had to have special software installed on your computer to play it, you could only copy it to your MP3 player (or phone) so many times before you used up your license.

This is when Napster and Limewire got huge and everybody stopped buying music.  Then music companies crawled out of their own asses and ended all the DRM bull shit and sales took off.

In 2015 the US paid 3.2 Trillion for health care. [source](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/highlights.pdf) That number increases 5.8% a year so in 2017 it should be 3.5 trillion.

Nope.

Excel's realtime collaboration is still a joke compared to Google.  Online Excel sucks and the Desktop version of Excel only allows collaboration in extremely specific scenarios and it's method of revisioning is terrible compared to Sheets.

    var row = 3;
    var lastRow = ss.getLastRow();
    
    
    function Locker() {
    //  var today = new Date() / 86400000 - 17335;  //Find current date in MS since 1970, divide by MS in a day and subtract the amount needed to get the value to equal 4 on 6/19/2017 (17332)
      var TRow = Math.floor(new Date() / 86400000 - 17335);  //Rounds the value down
      var FoodCol = 3; //Column with the food order
      // sheet.getRange(4,1).setValue(TRow); test
      
      if (TRow >= 4){
    
      while(row <= lastRow){ //Loop until last row in sheet is passed
        var SSTC = ss.getRange(row,3).getValue();  //First destination ID
        var tss = SpreadsheetApp.openById(SSTC); // sets var to first ID
        var ts = tss.getSheetByName('Order'); //Destination Sheet tab name
        var FoodRange = ts.getRange(4, FoodCol, TRow, 2); // Specifies the range to lock as the two horizontally adjacent cells
        var FoodProtect = FoodRange.protect().setDescription('FoodProtect'); // Create protection object. Set description, anything you like.
        
        // Ensure the current user is an editor before removing others. Otherwise, if the user's edit permission comes from a group, the script will throw an exception upon removing the group.
        var me = Session.getEffectiveUser();
        FoodProtect.addEditor(me);
        FoodProtect.removeEditors(FoodProtect.getEditors());
          
        if (FoodProtect.canDomainEdit()) {FoodProtect.setDomainEdit(true);}
    
        row = row + 1;   // Go to row 1 step down from current (the next date)
        }
      }
    }    
Short answer is "Yes", but it's going to require a decent amount of scripting.  I can show you some code you get you started if you're interested.

I know it's not very popular around here but I love the Disgaea series.

When I played FFT my biggest fun was finding ways to subvert the system.  First it was throwing rocks at my own guys to build up job points.  Then it was finding the map with a trap that lowered your level every time you stepped on it.  I would massively speed up my guys and massively lower the speed of the 1 guy I left on the map so I could amass job points and unlock late game classes while still keeping my character's levels low.

Disgaea takes all these concepts as a starting point and just goes crazy from there.

So I guess what I'm saying is that if you're a weirdo like me then Disgaea is the way to go!

I built a system and honestly it kind of got away from me.

I put hundreds of hours into it. I was proud of all it could do. Despite its issues it was miles better than our old processes. Even given all that, I still knew that my baby was an ugly motherfucker and would have wholeheartedly supported throwing it away and taking all the lessons learned to build a new, better system.

Now think about what Gandalf does with his time. Study?  Make cool fireworks? Smoke his pipe? Visit people?

Saying Gandalf and Sauron are equal is like saying a trained and practiced warrior is the same as a shopkeeper because they are both human.

Hyper repetitive "story" scenes between battles that do nothing to meaningfully advance the plot or develop characters.

Battle ends:

* Main Char:  Well, we did it team.
* Love interest:  I still hate you main char (Until I realize I love you 80% through the game)
* Gruff "Strong Guy": Man do I love fighting!
* Annoying character:  Here's my same stupid line that contributes nothing to the story

It's like the developers feel the need to put more "story" into a game and 90% of the time it's just filler.



Time in spreadsheets is set to work where a day is 1 and any fraction of a day (hours, minutes, seconds) are represented to the right of the decimal place.  For example 10 seconds is 0.000115740740740741 

To make the formula work how you want you have to multiply the time by the number of minutes in a day, 1440 (60*24).

So your formula would look like =C2/(D2*1440)

Also, it looks like your column F is defaulting to showing the format as time.  To fix this highlight column F then choose the Format Menu and select "Number" -> "Number" in the menu.

As a side note your numbers in Col H are way off. For example, look at Row 3.  If you make 20 food in 5 minutes that 4 food per minute, not 50.
Put this formula in C1

Classic dysfunctional manager.  I actually had my last boss tell me she didn't like to ever give praise because then people might expect raises or promotions.
When I gave notice recently they made some mention of me needing to work extra hours to help out.

It was hard but I managed not to laugh. When I walked out the door the minute my 8 hours was up (thus missing the meeting they scheduled well outside my normal working hours) they got the message. 
I quit a job just a few weeks ago and I gave 1 week notice.  The place was completely dysfunctional, everybody worth a damn had already quit, and there wasn't a chance in hell I was ever going to use anyone left at that company as a reference of any sort.

When I got some shit about the short notice I happily told them I could just leave right now if they preferred.  That shut them up real quick.

Depending on how dysfunctional the old job is this type of thing can end up being way more trouble than it's worth.

He was very receptive and appreciated getting to learn about this stuff he knew absolutely *nothing* about.

He got a raise in the midst of our conversations which amounted to about $300 more a month. I strongly advised him to start saving $100 a month which should be easy now that he's making $300 a month more. I then explained that if he just increased the amount he saved every year when he got his raise he'd start saving some real money without ever have "less money" at the end of the month.  Again he was very receptive to this.

I gave him a link for Vanguard and told him give them a call to set up an IRA (work had a shit 401k with no matching).  Then I told him he'd probably have to save $1,000 to start the account. He looked at me like I told him he'd need to sprout wings and fly. He could not conceive of being able to possibly save up that much money. In his words "I'm just not a saver like you". I tried encouraging him further but the wind had left his sails and I could tell he'd entirely given up on the process.

***sigh***
No kidding!  I was trying to figure out what an Orca card would cost me for my new job and I was shocked at how complicated it was!

The web versions of Office are extremely stripped down.  They are essentially viewers that allow minor updates.
Is this process not incredibly slow and clunky to you?  I'm on a fast computer with a fast network connection and typing in Excel takes a full 4-5 seconds to come up.

I don't understand how the length function would play into this at all.  Did you test your solution?

Well I just tried using Flow + Forms for over 5 minutes can couldn't figure out at all how to tell it to trigger after a certain person has submitted 3 or more times.

Chromebooks support offline mode as well.
Chromebooks are huge in school.  Like bigger than everything else combined. If anyone is gonna break/infect a computer it's gonna be a high school kid...
Well sure, but with Google that whole thing takes maybe 20 minutes to setup.  How long would it take with MS?
What an uneducated rant.

Google and Microsoft are identical in this regard.

They both have free products that advertise based on your data and paid products that do not.

I've never even heard of a chromebook needing support, or AV software, or encryption software, etc, etc, etc

It's 2017. Everything requires internet to be useful.

> Is Google Docs really better than something like LibreOffice?

Google apps is extremely powerful. The ability to link documents together super easily and without having to be on a local server while also extending functionality via Google Scripts that will run in any browser (vs. the nightmare that VBA can often be with different versions of Excel) makes it far superior to LibreOffice and also MS Office.

Take a use case like this [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/sheets/comments/6udlll/auto_generate_email_from_sheets/) and tell me how easily you'd replicate that functionality with MS/Libre Office.
> A nice idea for a business that doesn't need MS Office or the ability to run Windows apps

The thing is Google Apps has gotten a ***LOT*** better in recent years.  I've worked extensively with Google Sheets and made some fabulously intricate systems in it. Google Apps Script (Javascript) extends it's functionality beautifully and simply, including timed triggers for automated functions. Going from Google Sheets to Excel/VBA feels like a huge step down functionality wise in some really huge ways.

Outside of some very specific use cases most companies don't *need* MS Office.  It's mostly a function of inertia.

A lot of newer, smaller companies out there are using google apps and it's only a function of time for those newer smaller companies to become older larger companies.

I personally think the idea that Microsoft is a requirement in the business world is going to seem quaint in 10 years.
> I also strongly recommend you watch how they use excel, seeing someone navigate around using ctrl-(up/down/end/home/etc) rather than scrolling really is a simple thing that shows me how comfortable someone is with Excel.

I'd rank my skill level in spreadsheets as "extremely high" and I still scroll more often than not...

My primary work computer is a laptop with tiny, poorly laid out "end/home/whatever" buttons so I've just gotten used to not using them.
I think you're fundamentally missing the idea of a "Premium" product.

Did you know that a $200 Intel processor and a $500 one are actually the exact same silicon rolling off the exact same machines?  They test them and the ones that run perfectly are sold at the high price.  The ones that don't are downclocked until they run reliably enough then sold at a lower price.

Now imagine this applied to a phone.  All the pieces and parts that go into it cost a shitload more money for the exact same parts if you demand (near) perfection from your supplier since they can only use the "cream of the crop". This is everything from the processor to the storage to the memory to the battery to the circuits connecting it all.  The net result is that even though it's specs on paper don't look any better the actual product is faster and more reliable.

This is one of the reasons why Apple phones routinely outperform Android phones with "better" specs.

Yeah, it totally depends on how good your resume is.  If you're applying for something that has 100+ applicants and 40 of them are actually worth considering it's pretty common to use something fairly arbitrary like a college degree to narrow down who gets a phone interview.

If your resume already stands out then it's not as necessary.

I was at a decent sized company (few thousand employees) and we had our weekly department head meeting.  The CEO was ***ALWAYS*** late.  10 of us sat in the conference room shooting the shit for 20-30 minutes waiting for him every week because he was so important that he didn't need to ever be on time.

The time/money wasted over the course of a year was many thousands of dollars.

Nobody is suggesting stopping all immigration.  I simply suggested tightening up the rules around one type of heavily abused  regulation.
There are a lot of business reasons why the H1B abuse is a bad idea.

When it's used for it's original purpose, importing skilled workers from abroad, is good, but that has become the small minority of it's use now.

Instead it is being used in a "race to the bottom"  type of approach to maximize short term profits.

Good people cost good money.  There are engineers in India that are AMAZING.  Guess what?  They are just as expensive as amazing engineers in the US.

When you hire cheap employees you get cheap work. Doesn't matter where it is.

It doesn't matter though, senior management just plays the game.  Cut costs, bump up the stock, collect your bonus, find a new job where you can tell them all about how much money you saved your last company and repeat the cycle there.

Meanwhile 2-5 years later all of these companies start [suffering huge problems ](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/27/british-airways-says-computer-outage-causing-global-delays.html) because their IT has gone to shit.
The very link the OP provided focuses on a group of people who lost their jobs to H1B imports.  The people coming in had no special skillset and the people who lost their jobs were required to spend months training their replacements or forfeit their severance pay.
This isn't about talent and innovation.  This is about huge companies maximizing their profits by importing cheap foreign labor.

Sometimes H1B is used for what it's intended but mostly it is used to build a cheaper helpdesk.
> H1B's have a skillset that the locals do not

That is just 100% completely wrong and there is example after example after example of this not being the case.
Really simple quick fix.  Change the minimum wage from $60,000 to $200,000.

If you cannot find any workers in our entire country to take the job and need to literally import workers from across the globe surely the incredibly rare skill set you require is worth that much.

A couple years ago I was setting up Surface 3's for some students at a school.  I had a long counter where I had eight Surfaces all lined up and did a full factory reset on all of them. After the factory reset finished they all booted up to the setup screen.

* Two of them were completely unresponsive to the keyboard/touchpad.  Ripping it off and re-attaching it fixed the issue.
* Two of them were completely unresponsive to the touchscreen. Rebooting them fixed it.

That is a 50% success rate of a fresh factory reset.

This was very demonstrative of my overall experience with the Surfaces. They are expensive, delicate, finicky, flaky and generally not worth the trouble.

Having dealt with well over a hundred Surfaces over the last couple years I would absolutely never ***dream*** of buying one.

> 320K in student loan debt

As somebody who recently got a bachelor's degree for a grand total of $12,000 seeing numbers like this just boggles my mind.

I assume this is for an advanced degree like lawyer or doctor and I get how that will greatly increase your earning potential over the long run but $320k is soooo much money.  I don't think I could have brought myself to do it.
> They’re never worth it!! You lose so much value over the course of the next few days, let alone the cars lifetime. 

This is really more hyperbole than reality. It's very common for people to throw lines like this around but if you actually do the math it's really not a big deal at all.
All right.  Let's throw some numbers at this.

Let's say you want to buy a car and drive it until it's 15 years old.

* If you go buy a brand new car for $24,000, drive it for 15 years, then sell it for $4,000 your total cost was $20,000, or roughly $1,300 a year

* If you go buy a 2 year old car for $20,000, drive it for 13 years (until it's 15 years old) and sell it for $4,000 your total cost was $16,000 over 13 years or roughly $1,200 a year.

The difference is a measly 100 bucks a year, or 8 bucks a month.

In exchange for that:

* You get to choose the exact color/options for your car.
* You get to know for certain that your car wasn't abused by somebody that drove like an ass hole before you got it.
* You get better financing options.  (Even if you have the cash why not take take 3 years 0% APR?)
* You often get perks like free oil changes/maintenance for a year or two.

TLDR:  Not only is buying a new car not a terrible decision. It can actually be a pretty smart decision.
I worked at a place for almost 10 years. 5 star reviews every year along with nice healthy raises and bonuses. Company is sold "Nothing will change", a few months later 90% of the department heads including me are gone.

It takes me 9 months but I finally land basically the same position at a very similar company. About a year later "we're outsourcing your department", buh bye.

Takes another 9 months but to finally land another job.

I was already a "saver" so the long bouts of unemployment were never dire or anything but being out of work for fairly long stretches as the sole provider for a family of five is extremely stressful. Applying to literally hundreds of jobs and being rejected for 99% of them is demoralizing and makes you feel worthless.

The stress of being laid off twice in a row and of being unemployed for long stretches really got to me. I no longer have the slightest feeling of job security at all, and it sucks.

I don't need to retire, I need to not ***need*** a job.  I need to know that it's all OK and I'm working because I find it fulfilling not because I need to put food on my table for my kids.
I have one line that reads as follow:

Knows everything there is know about it he ins and outs of how a hospitals function.

I didn't say I knew all the ins and outs.  I said I saw ridiculous shit.

Here is the million dollar example I saw first hand:

Me and about 10 other guys were hired on a temp contract  to aid them in a big server upgrade.  The day we all started they announced to us that somebody at the top and nixed the project and instead of upgrading the current system they were going to transition to something completely different.  The new system was something none of us had any particular expertise in.

Instead of apologizing and handing us all pink slips (which they absolutely could have and should have) they kept us all. They needed to do a ton of planning and purchasing that we weren't part of since the decision had been made with no understanding of the consequences.  So all 11 of us guys who probably had an effective rate of at least $100/hour by the time they paid the agency fees we were hired through literally sat around on their asses doing absolutely NOTHING for months.  I left after 3-4 months of being bored out of my mind so I have no idea how long the fiasco of pissing away $10,000 a day went on but I'd guess at least 6 months.  That's well over a million dollars completely wasted.
The waste in hospitals is absurd and at every level.  I did IT Support at a large hospital some years ago. I could go on for days at the ridiculous shit I saw there.

Our health care system has all the bad parts of capitalism and none of the good parts. Everything is filtered through legally required insurance so we are not the customers of the medical service providers, the insurance companies are.

Imagine if we passed a law requiring grocery insurance. You pay hefty premiums to your insurance company and when you show up to the grocery store you "only" have to pay a $30 co-pay to get food.  Except you can only get the food on the predefined list and they know you're only allowed to shop there so the lines are long, the process is laborious and full of paperwork.  The prices are sky high but it doesn't matter because you just pay the co-pay right? The selection is terrible but that doesn't matter because your insurance only covers the store brand stuff anyway.  

Would you really call that capitalism?

> there's just not enough work

There's already not enough work.  Think of how much time at work is spent not working.  For most people it's pretty substantial.
Not programming related but at my place of employment the big boss has a history of slapping down anyone who shows anything resembling initiative or leadership.  Every single decision is micromanaged (I'm talking about stuff like what font is used in a one off flyer, or what kind of tape to use to put the business license on the wall) and if it's not done exactly her way you can expect to spend hours re-doing everything from scratch. I once made a suggestion of how we could do things differently at a team meeting (suggesting that departments could meet with each other monthly) I was chewed out for "challenging her authority" and banished to a broom closet at another campus for six months as punishment (I wish I was joking). I was also instructed to lie to everyone and tell them it was my idea to leave the main campus. When I told people I wasn't at that campus anymore because the boss had reassigned me I was hauled in front of HR and chewed out for another hour.

Last month she hauled a bunch of people into her office one at a time to chew them out for 45 minutes each for not showing more initiative and not getting enough done because they were constantly waiting for her approval.  Total damned if you do, damned if you don't situation.

Yeah, this is the downside of using your web site domain name as your Active Directory domain name.

You should be able to go into your DNS settings on your Windows server and create an A record for www that goes to the IP address for your web site.
Maybe just an annual visit by a 3rd party to look for signs of major shenanigans like the kid living on nothing but store brand dry cereal while the mom is driving a new Escalade.
Your DHCP server needs to be re-configured. From your description I'm guessing you are using your router/firewall for DHCP.  You need to log into that and look at the settings and change the DNS server in the DHCP settings to your Windows server IP.

After doing this you can set the computers to Auto and it should work onsite or anywhere else.
