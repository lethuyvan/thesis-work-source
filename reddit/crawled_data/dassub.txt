This is why I always spend more than $100 on a pair of desktop speakers. I got the Z625 set for both desktops in the house and they sound great.
Ya rly.
Ugh. Hate Slack. People keep using it at work these days. THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH SAMETIME DAMMIT!
Pretty much. My home gym has everything needed and cost less than $1000, including the mirror and tv on the wall.
I saw that sketch with the hair, but I can't seem to figure out what the connection would be.  Like, switched guys?  Just confusing.
True, but at the beginning of the video he nudges the laptop out and towards him from under a bag.  So they were taking up less space than before he did that greasy move.
Comment of the year.
That haircut will just feel and look that much better now üòé
I'm just gonna leave the office early and work from home in the afternoon to watch it.  No biggie.
I noticed that, but mine stopped catching things after an hour, even though it stayed connected for longer.
Are you using the Android companion booster app thing?  I've noticed that if I do use that service, it actually sometimes crashes 5 mins into the session.  Since switching back to not using it, it stays open in the background for the hour.  Reconnecting after the hour is a chore, though.
I'm bringing my Gotcha charger to work today so a coworker can update mine with the iOS app.  I've had no issues on Android, but I assume newer firmware = better.
His whole life is a dick joke.
If they won't fix the connection issues, they should at least increase the 1 hour timeout.
Eh, I'm a guy and I'm jealous as hell at the wardrobe choices girls have over us. Clothes shopping would be sick if I was a girl. There's only so many shoes and jeans combos I can have for casual work days.
Ding ding ding.
I can only raid on weekends, due to work, so my rare candy situation is not good.  I spend them as I get them.  I solo t3 raids and do t5, and even with good damage, team bonus, etc, the bundles always come back as potions that I immediately delete.
A lot of packed suburbs with tons of town homes already look like this.  Probably due to basement renters, too.  It's disgusting to see.
Are you on the 2-year old cable tv + gigabit promotion for $99?  Mine is expiring next month, and I'm dreading calling retention.
Did you sideload the OTA?  I'm still waiting in Canada for the update.
Or at least match the 3500mah of the original Z Play.
Honestly, I just transfer the Moltres to power up my good one. Level 15 is far too much an investment. Even if good IVs. My rare candies are needed elsewhere.
This guy food scales.
Whatever they are, they lead to profit.
They really don't deserve it at this point.
The Raptors about to get a lot more attention.
Big if true.
That happened so fucking hard.
Don't come crying to me when your bf abuses you lol
Any word on if it streams in 5.1 surround sound?  These CBC broadcasts seem to only be in stereo, which makes my theatre room sad.
No offense to the Raptors and Jays, but the Leafs game 7 takes priority over everything.
I wish we could somehow submit spawn points. I'm in a big city but my house has zero. Walk down a few houses and there's a cluster spawn at all times.
I honestly thought he might've been gay (obligatory not that there's anything wrong with that).
No, it was Christina Tanaglia. And it was a disgusting display.

Edit: it was probably both of them.
Oh so that would explain the random water spawns when I was walking to the corner store.  It's bright and sunny today, so they wouldn't typically be around.
Yeah, especially since a posted pic here showed a rented truck.  That's never a good sign, and plays into that whole "part and parcel" meme.
And road trips typically don't happen often enough to become (and stay) overweight.
Your phone might be too aggressive closing the background app, then.
Didn't think I'd find a shiny in the wild.
Pffft Apple ships 5w chargers with their most expensive iPhones.
Oh man is he in for a huge shock around here after 11 years haha
Was she eating a bag of chips the whole time? No? Ok probably not her then.
Yup, my local park was an Onix nest and it made it easy to do every great/excellent task.
Don't you dare talk down to Mario Paint artwork üòÇ
That is pure evil.
Yeah, I thought the same. Like leveling up to level 2 in an RPG.
How much RAM does your phone have?  Mine has 3GB and maybe once a week it'll kick PoGo out of memory when minimized.  I think 3GB should be the absolute minimum.
La Parka and Disco are both national treasures.
OHHHH MYYYYYY!!!!
Same.
That's pretty awesome!  Makes me wanna actually get fast over long distances, instead of just HIIT (suicide sprints).
Maybe the rich family love PoGo and bought the property for the gym :D
Probably accurate.
Ah.
The end times do not help anyone who works full time. It's brutal.
I wish I could do 1-2 raids a day. I've been doing 1-2 raids per week for the past few months. This winter has been brutal.
Salmon suit Mark Henry should have 100% had a world title run.
You probably don't wanna get hit by it.
Where else would it be found?
That product title tho
Honestly, I'll never tire of it. I can read the same thread like this every week and enjoy it.
Yeah. Dude needs to shave, it's disgusting.
Legit wouldn't even cover my daily toll expenses, let alone gas or anything else.
> ‚Äúhow many people do you need to sell each month to replace your income?‚Äù

All of them.
I'm doing my part to bring this post up to 448. It'll get there!
Worth it.
Appraise.
I love the factorial bot. 2!
I enjoyed this.
Are chances worse if feeding remotely? I've fed my one Blissey 200 berries so far the past 3 days and haven't gotten any candy to show for it (stagnant gym).
Savage.
If tier 3 raids weren't on a curfew, I think this whole powering up question would be a lot easier to answer.
I hope the ban wave thing is legit. Those other subs keep getting posts deleted, so it's hard to say if they're hiding the truth with this whole "it's the servers" thing.  I guess we'll know more with time.
Same. As a Gotcha user who lives near steps, I already have 500+ red balls at all times.  I got 20 pokeballs twice in a row.  So dumb.
That "which one" reply is savage. I love it.
Thanks! I wanna read all the salt.
Are they sending their love down the well?
You mark.
Best timeline.
I'd love a community day that isn't covered in ice and snow üòÇ
This brings back memories of growing up and listening for school closures on the radio. For some reason we'd always get screwed. Toronto board not cancelled, gotta go to school. But Peel? That shit was cancelled every chance they got. Totally not fair.
Buy a UPS and use it for your modem and router. Even a cheap one will last long under minimal load.
No "probably" about it.
Savage.
I had the same issue. Connection up and running after an hour or so, but it wasn't doing anything.
You look like a Snapchat filter.
Same in Toronto. I caught quite a bit just near home and called it a day.
Honestly, that outfit is boss.
Titus?
wat
This would legit be big if true. It's always a pain to get it to reconnect after the hour. It's like it completely forgets what it was talking to the entire time.
The Asian community!!??
Ahh yes, when commentary didn't have to say something during every second of airtime. It was refreshing to not hear something like "WHAT A MOMENT!!"
Good. Screw starlings, they're the worst.
Now kith.
kek
Maybe they parked in the garage.
You could also use an incense. Use it just before midnight to get 2 days in. Pokestop streak will still end, though.
Sounds perfect if very local. If it's too far, meh.
The real tip something something comments.
That is extremely obscure üòÇ
That's a lotta calories.
Yeah, screw that pokestop.
It always is.
I think we'll continue to use the English language.
Let's be honest here.  People who live near there are probably more concerned that this potential ghetto development will lower their property values.  That right there is enough to oppose it.  But yeah, I drove through that area recently enough, and the traffic is already a giant mess.. lots of people moving to Bathurst wayyyy up at King or so..  this would not help at all.
You misspelled Cammy.
That's precisely why Russo believed that the show should be about the politics, since everyone already seems to be an expert on all the backstage rumblings.
Hopefully Sportsnet doesn't have 100% of the tv rights. Their production quality is abismal compared to TSN.
Man I miss Nitro.
Man, weather boosted ancient power gave me trouble yesterday.  I beat it with only a few seconds remaining.
i went to my local park that's currently an Onix nest.  But before I even got to one, a Pidgeot spawned.  Was pretty easy, since it was similar to a legendary bird.
.. as long as he got buried, sure.
You said the keyword here, pay.  Tims is so hell-bent on cost-cutting that anything and everything is fair game.
Haven't heard from her in a while.
Same. A few years ago. Broke my elbow in pieces. That recovery and rehab was a bitch. Fast forward 2 years and 2 surgeries and now I'm good.
I get them regularly enough for solo t3.
I do tons of solo t3 and I always seem to get multiple bundles of potions and revives. It's terrible. I delete them right away. I need rare candies, but they seem to never drop.
I really hope not.  I got the 20 pokeballs the first time around.
You got your wish.
Thanks.
That's good to know, I hadn't gotten there yet.  Can we pinap Mew?
That's awesome. He can frame that and hang it on the wall.
Pretending to sell high-end speakers at a huge discount.  Instead selling terrible quality speakers for whatever cash you might offer them.
You know you're in the wrong part of town when you see one of these places.
Is this the first time you've seen her?
Savage.
I saw that happen 3 days ago.  Clicking on that sub was weird as fuck.  Dude was getting wrecked in this sub and ran away to complain there.  No idea that sub even existed.
Upvoted so fucking hard.
A lot, and nothing, at the same time.
Almost as if this whole thing was a work.
Big if true.
I immediately discard rewards for revives, potions, or balls. I'll keep dust and encounters. Only saw one rare candy so far.
My wife STILL uses this thing. It won't die.
Boring, dependable kids.
That background is a disaster.. The Big Dog also looks a little low.
It's.. STIIINGGGGGG!!!!
1.
This has to be the first time ever where an iPhone has functionality that an Android doesn't.
As an Android user, is it worth it for me to find an iPhone friend to update my firmware? Any bug fixes that might universally apply?
Ya rly.
You're not wrong.
Literally.
I'd rather pinaps over red balls. I have 500+ and now 20 more.
That's terrible!  But knowing my raid luck, I'm not getting rare candies here.  No matter how many bundles I get back, the rare candies just don't come.
How do you tell versions apart?
Mine also says "Pokemon Go has stopped." Sometimes. So yeah, I hate playing roulette and hoping it connects. How hard can this be? They created both products. They should work.
Whoa, Bork's back.
Just when I thought Sami Zayn couldn't look any more like a cab driver.
I've been using Future Sight for Lugia Machamp solos (he's the anchor and the battle finishes with tons of time left).  Is Sky Attack that much better now?
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY! 
That shirt just screams Walmart.
Especially with how fast the S9 charges. Wall hugging isn't happening for more than 20 min at a time.
Welp, there goes my night.
Half my family has iPhones and the other half Android.  When sitting around not-in-use, the iPhones seem to last forever.  But as soon as they get any sort of use, the iPhones die a lot faster.
Nope.  Neither has the 4 min update interval and the .98 distances.
Do GoPlus spins get quests?  I keep forgetting to check.
Yeah really.  Africa always gets all the nice things.
Disco was more over than Cody ever was.
Tim Burr is the real heel for getting Russo kicked off Podcast One.  Ryan Satin is a moran.
Disco is on every Konnan podcast.  They're friends who like to shit on each other in good fun.
Looks like something out of Persona.
She's impressively slow-moving.
I see you have the same rare candy rate that I have.
I like Caterpie üòä
What a legend.
Can confirm. It doesn't work on my phone, but works on my wife's phone and my tablet. Super weird.
I have that exact same problem on my phone right now. Reinstall didn't fix it. Interesting thing is it works on my wife's phone and my tablet. Never had any issues before this.
Nah, you can keep her. Us straights don't want her.
She needs to start harvesting.
Oh yeah, the dog is the surprising part of the video. Yup.
... and an almost identical iOS experience.
If the price is right, I'd love to buy this phone at launch.
Why not a gotcha instead?
Settings, more, cellular networks. Uncheck the name option.
Amazing.
Wow, you really chose a doozy here.
Sounds foggy.
Same. Just did a lucky egg evolve and it was way harder than it has to be.
It's hard to tell them apart quickly.  I'm about to do a lucky egg and it's throwing me off.
Roman's gonna own this list in 5 years.
Plus, who the hell buys a cutting board at Ikea?
Most jacked ho.
Except she's actually over.
There's just too much programming. I just watch the ppvs and read about the tv results. Or even better, listen to a podcast for the results.
She just looks slow and out of shape :\
Drove E46, E90, now F30. Can confirm.
That's usually what happens with me, but half the time the background service crashes, so I have to quit and try again from try #1. It's such a basic feature that they still haven't fixed. Then on reconnect, why does the app forget what it was paired with FOR THE PAST HOUR?
The real solution should be to have an option to remember which to throw, and then have an option for the Plus to throw great and ultra balls.
Not seeing revives and potions under Quest Rewards makes me happy.
Just another example of how awful that 4 minute window is. Especially when an egg is at x.97 or something.  FIX THIS NIANTIC!
Mixed tag with Nia Snacks?
Fabulous.
Title shot opportunity?  Just call it a belt, PAL.
This gif only exists because of her tight jeans.
Big if true.
The only people complaining about these shortages are the ones who do nothing but raid. Just catching and spinning for an hour gives you tons of revives and potions.
Especially when you also have team control.
Big if true.
I'm really happy that it doesn't seem to involve consecutive days.  I'd rather not rush out and "complete 3 raids" on the same day.
It's almost end of sprint.  Work will be finished by the time the event starts!
It was sunny weather, so I caught 3 high IV level 35 bulbs in the wild.  So I spent no dust and evolved them (one was a shiny).  I had a level 27 100% which I used my dust on to get to 35, too.
Yeah, who drives domestic cars. Really..
I love how you put in the emotes, too. üòÇ
Once you find something that fits, go crazy stocking up!
Maybe she meant British currency.
Is it safe to get that close? I'd wanna pet him.
Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what raid boss to use it against (now, and future). I evolved 4 lv35 ones.
It happens. But also, wow, they can't even be bothered to update the new years loading screen graphic. This is something they could easily update with a new image every month, at least.
I'm just hoping there's no truth to the rumor that the move is not guaranteed.
Or fly business class. You have everything for free in the lounge.
Awesome news, it's such a funny listen every Monday.
I had it in the Philippines and in Australia. I liked it. It should do well.
The real MVP
I've never seen a Beldum before. It fleed my gotcha yesterday at work. The struggle is real.
It better change the catch rate.
Just don't click that button. Because it'll take forever to get it to reconnect. Somehow this app forgets what it was paired with for the past hour.
All of it.
You're awesome.
Fishmans! So good.. I've been a few times and have always loved the food.
Nice try, Steph.
He's nowhere near strong enough to get anyone but small guys up on it. Cesaro could possibly do it.
Their raid pass sales have to be suffering right now. Our local discord group usually raids all day (I keep an eye on it, but mostly I'm at work). Today? 2 raids.
Same person.
Man, all these workarounds posted here (including one from me) just make me realize that these idiots can't even get something simple right.  It couldn't be that hard to get a simple bluetooth device to stay paired.
I'll copy and paste what I wrote in another thread:

I've had good success by doing this:

Turn off bluetooth

Force close PoGo (from the Android app settings)

Turn on bluetooth

Reopen PoGo

Usually connects on the 2nd button push after doing this.



Note:  On very rare occasions (like in the cold last night), a phone restart was the only solution.
Another instance of "we shouldn't have to do this".  Stupid Niantic.  Fix your stuff!
It's definitely a Toronto thing. I spent time in Chicago, and people in transit (mostly blacks on the south side), talk to each other like they're family. Telling them to not swear or use the n word around kids, etc. It was nice that there was so much communication, with people calling complete strangers out on their shit.
6 cents more to hatch eggs faster?  No brainer.
I just bought the super incubators to clear out my old 5km inventory faster.
Bought a Great box :)
Not to mention using the infinite incubator on 2km eggs, and having them constantly stop at 1.97km or similar, and having to wait 4 minutes for it to update and hatch.  Constantly screws you out of 300m on the next egg.
Late to the party, I just heard this news on Castrating The Marks.  This is brutal.  But hopefully he'll probably get the hookup from Konnan for Westwood One.

And yes, Russo has fans.  I pay for the Relm network shows.  The cost is a cup of coffee, who cares.
Agreed.  Niantic sucks.
I've had good success by doing this:


Turn off bluetooth

Force close PoGo (from the Android app settings)

Wow, an actual successful Nigerian scammer. No mentions of being a prince or anything.
... and a bunch of Japanese chicks.
Even if the dude didn't specifically see this person, they know how to just get the idea out there.
Nice Dumb and Dumber haircut.
Didn't stop Apple Maps.
Yes.
The Plus has a terrible catch rate.  I wouldn't recommend it on community day for bulbs.
BEEFCAKE
Obviously you haven't heard the Big Cass news.
I might buy one for my parents. Looks interesting.
Your cat looks like the type that would get chased by horny skunks.
inbrampton has to be the most relevant domain possible.
lol
I have an x900e, the struggle is real.
I've been walking Bagon because I got lucky enough to find a 100.  Is Salamence worth it?
He's on some of Russo's shows.
I'm not proud of that upvote.
Once in a lifetime.
You keep the brand outta this.
I haven't powered up my Raikus, they're all level 20 and my TTars are 35.  Bleh!
No, I just put it in my small jeans pocket (I'm sure there's a name for it).  I don't use the bracelet at all.
Nah, it's March now.
I ordered from Amazon.  Pretty much anything that ships with Prime makes me happy, since I get it same/next day.  I paid around $50 when I got it.
Any time I'm having issues connecting, I turn off bluetooth and force close PoGo.  Then, turn bluetooth back on and reopen PoGo.  Usually connects right away (well, on that patented 2nd try, anyway).  I recently had it connect on the first try by pressing the button, and then hitting in-app button.
Or, at least increase their margins (as if they weren't big enough).
I don't.
All of it.
I mean, I guess it's an easy way to spot douche bags.
Story of my Life, but also get screwed from t4 and t5. Lots of bonus balls/bundles, but all are bundles of potions to delete.
I will continue to visit the sub daily and mash F5! We're thirsty for new content.
Fine speech.
Same. Moto Z Play and I can't throw it high enough this time around.
Still just a grid of icons, though.
Hm?  It has 4GB of ram.  That is a good amount of memory.
0 for 4 today.  Can confirm.
He kinda just went for the easy cheap heat, though.
Jesus. You gave him way more than he deserved there.. But I'm glad you let him know that his bullshit tactics wouldn't fly.
So... Razor Leaf or Vine Whip? I've got my hundo ready for community day.
Last ball is always half a shake and escape for me :(  Have people actually caught a legendary with their last ball lately?
I hope they improve Go Plus / Gotcha connectivity.  That initial connection is irritating.
Yes.
Finally an excuse to evolve/max my 100% Bulbasaur.  It's easy since it's already level 30.  I don't have many high level grass attackers, except for a good egg at 35, and tons of weather boosted Bells and Odds.
Such a good look for her.
Big if true.
Perfect.
No one said putting yourself over would be cheap.
This guy wears a hat 24/7. Scum bag confirmed.
I do like that you're getting real heat on ZFF.
1.  I hate the 1hr disconnect.  Much like other parts of the game, a simple adjustment would make it so much better.  ie:  Double it to 2 hours.  And halve the egg counters from 4 min to 2.  Such small things would make this game so much better.

Edit:  Especially with how difficult it can be to reconnect (literally doing it right now).
I hope it stays around, if only to keep my childhood Christmas memories alive of the one that was at Crossroads.
Great game, bro.
Steph $100% goes over strong.
> wwe superslam

Superbrawl Saturday.
I've been having connection issues with my Gotcha, but what I find really helps is force stopping the game (not just swiping it away, but actually App Info > Force close).  Then, it takes like 1-3 tries to connect, but typically will.  Also have tried turning off Bluetooth for 10 secs and back on, seems to help sometimes too.
Not even a real journalism.
I've been saving a 100% Bulbasaur. Any chance its exclusive move will be worth evolving this one?
Worth it for the egg distance alone. Having said that, the Pokemon has fled!
Surprised no one answered with "yes".
S9. You won't look back.
I grind stops twice a week. Revives and potions just aren't needed.
I would raid more if they took revive and potion bundles out of raid rewards!  I just did a 5 man Tyranitar today, got 14 balls (I'm pretty sure it was that high, it was team control plus 3 damage), and I got 0 rare candies for my trouble, and 15 revives that I immediately trashed.  Very, very frustrating.
They can't even give those things away.
Claiming 5.85" seems so dishonest based on the wording.
Are we not doing phrasing any more?
Yeah but he has heat with Jeff now too. That was the last straw, fellow brand member.
Yeah but what happens when you add Kurt Angle to the mix?
Mine has been having trouble reconnecting lately :\

Edit:  I seem to have better luck with reconnecting by disabling Bluetooth on my phone (Moto Z Play) and then turning it back on 10 seconds later.
They're all on the list.
Rayquaza has actually been the easiest legendary for me  to hit.  It's consistently the farthest "straight" curve ball I can throw.  Pretty much no guessing game required. I've never thrown so many tiny excellents before.
It's been hit and miss for me. Usually takes a few tries, with the odd day where it seems nothing works.
Do you bother with any companion apps?
Pretty much.  Dumping time and resources yet again to try and get him over.
Do you live at a cottage?
Bin Hamin.
Thanks!
Any reason why the version by him is the one to use?  I don't use any of them for my Gotcha, but with Android, I guess you never know when I might need it.
Really hope it's a work and he's okay.  That looks brutal.
You know it's legit because there's an immediate camera cut. WWE never does that.
Sami is annoying as hell. Shane is the biggest baby face ever in my books.
I can't tell if Ruby is hot or not.
Oh man, I wish I knew he was in Toronto. I'd definitely wanna see him.
Literally unplayable.
"Sting"
Agreed. That would prevent "crowds", if that's what Niantic is going for.
:(  But it's such a fun listen!
Still better than today's product.
SJWing ain't easy.
She looks like she's just pretending to play games, but it's really unplugged.
Agreed if not winter üòÇ
This will probably end up on Castrating the marks.
Pretty sweet selfie cam though.
She's the Owen Hart.
She is so proud of herself, too.
Time for some DDP Yoga.
I'm guessing this Raps team is for real.
Pain? That looks comfy as hell.
Yeah. F2P makes no sense to me when something gives this amount of enjoyable play time.  Even tossing $5-10 a month is nothing. It's a cheap lunch for one day.
Most people walk that distance on any given day, at a faster pace.  It's ridiculous.
... which completely negates the "powerhouse" shtick they're trying to sell us.
Not surprising.  Jeff Lane really does have good work ethic.
I'm not entirely sure that it can even tell the difference between the two.
Am white, would totally pull over and help Indian bro.
100% thought it was Brampton.
Mine (gotcha) is having trouble connecting lately.  Any initial connection improvements?
My gotcha had been hating the new update, too.
I rolled back from the latest APK version because of the stupid time glitch.  This is my very first EX raid pass, and I'm not gonna miss it because Niantic doesn't know how to code timezones properly.
So, is it better to bank multiples and use them all in a row? Or is it better to use them as soon as they are ready? This is more for my solo t3 raiding, so DPS is key.
> customers

Rrrrriiight..
RNG has been hitting me hard in the rare candy category lately. I try to use my daily pass (and sometimes a premium if I'm already out) on either a solo t3, or a t5. This past week, after 10 raids, I have 3 rare candy for my troubles. The bundles are there, but it's always tons of revives and potions.
God I love that giraffe. Super rare, though.
Least confusing thing ever.
:(
You're very very right on the pictures thing.  I do NOT see my progress in the mirror, despite being at my goal weight, AND working out in the home gym 4 nights a week.  But when I see old photos, the difference is insane.
At least there's a happy ending :)
Rip red balls, unless you live on a stop, too.
I played last night for 2 hours without crashes. But didn't bring gotcha with me, now I wish I did.
Does the companion app actually help at all? I have a gotcha and never have problems connecting. I just have the typical slow response problems while already connected. Especially for spins.
Is this the first time this commentary team has shown any real emotion and unscripted lines?
An easy solution is for hatches to be level 25 or 30. At level 20, I'll always just look for a weather boosted one instead, even if it's IVs aren't as good.
No worries, I powered up my best Corsola I caught on vacation from level 5 to 30 after walking it a ton. No regrets.
Roman the "powerhouse" wouldn't be able to do that. But commentary would try and sell it to you.
I played for the past 2 hours to stock up on red balls for the Plus. No issues at all. Installed apk just before I headed out. Moto Z Play.
Mine got turned off this morning too!
That would suck. I just got one 2 days ago. But damn are the catch rates terrible. Anyway, I assume it's not really possible to tell the difference between them. They both communicate the same way.
> and a good RNG

In that case, I'm screwed.  I've had terrible RNG luck since day one.
Niantic is terrible.
Which one?
You forgot the part where Steph slaps her and goes over.
It's hard to miss her.
She's out of shape and botches all the time.
She's way fatter than she's ever been. Especially after seeing older gifs in here lately.
Nice! I've been playing since launch and only have one from a hatch the first month or so.
Speaking of charge moves, is it better to bank multiples and use them all in a row? Or is it better to use them as soon as they are ready? This is more for my solo t3 raiding, so DPS is key.
Same.
Or lazy people.  I'd buy them.
Dude even goes to house shows. That's a lot of time spent at events.
I have a Karate Chop one too :)  He's level 30 now.
Just bought a Gotcha yesterday.  Connects perfectly to my Moto Z Play.  But wow, the catch rate is horrible, and it barely ever spins stops when biking or driving.  You basically have to be on top of the stop for 10 seconds for it to spin it.
I'd just like to know why I've had exactly 0 rare candies in my past 5 tier 3 solos.  Each time, I've gotten 13-14 premier balls (I forget the exact amount, but a lot).  Very, very annoying RNG.
I'm more comparing it to my wife's S8. I'm not one to talk, my Moto Z Play has giant bezels.
I have barely any shinies. But I got lucky with Mawile and got its shiny in my very first raid attempt of it.
I still use bubbles. It's the best. My Google drive has NoiseField.apk there just to install bubbles on any new phone I get.
If anything, that just shows how big the X bezels really are. Their edge to edge claim is a joke.
Wow, I knew something seemed off about Target when I was in Melbourne. It sucked compared to even our short- lived version.
Interesting. I still have a few P5K boards and an E8400 and Q6600 lying around in the basement.
I'd have always the parallel port with printers, until I bought my first mp3 player (mpman f10). That stupid thing used the parallel port to transfer mp3s. It took forever, even with just 32MB.
To be fair, he was giving out slim jims during his entrance.
That's pretty cool. I have 4 wild catches at level 33 that I kept.
Trackpoint master race.
That Remington Centre looks interesting.  I wonder when it'll open.
Walking around with the thermos was a great gimmick. Almost worth stealing in real life.
Austin and Russo both speak highly of him.
Sasha talking shit is always fun.
My brother met Damien Sandow years ago at Santino's gym.  He got him to make a video of him saying "My-full-name", you're welcome!".  I won't share, because yeah, my real full name is being said in it, but it's awesome nonetheless.
If someone has a moustache so big that it needs wax, it's time to shave.
Yeah but this is Niantic.  They'll need to wrap it with 500 lines of garbage to try and hide it from spoofers or something.
Haha, that has to be the most entertaining thing he's ever done.
BORINGGGGG!!
It would be great if they let matches end with this. You pretty much know it's a 2-count, despite its impressiveness.
Thanks!  It's noticeably snappier on my Moto Z Play than the previous version.
It's all about that weather boost (hopefully). We don't get many here, so they're all low level.
> yo
Jeff Lane?
This is what happens when the company is the heel.  No one will support their chosen ones.
Apple Maps unavailable for comment.
Big if true.
You mean The Big Vito Brand.
Gotta get that heel heat.
There's one way Nia would lose 10lbs.
All the crotches.
I don't care about the potions and revives either. Only people who drive from raid to raid do. I delete them all the time.
Please tell me this is near Toronto. I wanna buy them all.
Ah yes, when she wasn't Chyna version 2.
That ratio is pretty bad for distance driven and walked!

I drove 5km and walked 10km.  My feet hurt.
Classic Niantic.
As someone who cross shopped both, that's entirely accurate üòÇ ended up pulling the trigger on a fully loaded 328xi, sport line. Oh, and Coral red interior of course.
Maybe misplaced is the wrong word. But there's a certain irony in blindly defending someone who's previous actions warrant mugshots.
Nice.
> paperviews 


Is that inaccurate?
Is he nice?
Thanks.
That's a pretty hilarious answer to shut down their misplaced rage.
Yeah, that house is a mess.  It's disgusting.
Thanks :)  I'm actually starting to spend my rare candies on Entei as I get them.  Might as well, I already can beat the other tier 3 raid bosses easily.
That's so nice to hear. If I knew that was the reaction (and not just a scam by ownership), I'd do it often.
I want one! Actually, I want one for every room I'm ever in.
Yeah, the arcade there used to be amazing!  I would go and get my car detailed in the parking garage, and then have to kill a few hours in the mall.  I could easily kill time eating lunch, an egg waffle, and then playing at the arcade.  Now?  Can't kill time worth a shit.
I haven't tried Jynx yet, but I can easily solo the other tier 3 raid bosses.

I have no powered up fire legendaries, but I have 3 wild flareons that are level 35 (but bad IVs, but from researching, it shouldn't matter too much, since they're still level 35).

My potential team is 2 level 35 Gengars to get ahead of the clock, then the 3 level 35 flareons, and a level 35 TTar.  Hoping this will be enough, even if I have to re-enter to finish her off!
What else did you use to beat Jynx?  I have yet to try to solo her.
I just hatched a full screen of eggs last night, and so far the first 6 eggs I've picked up since have been 2km eggs.  So something changed.  I usually kept picking up 5km eggs.
That's amazing! I'm still trying to figure out where to go.
Weather boost has been my savior here. I didn't have a high level Gengar at all before it. Then, I caught 2 level 35 weather boosted Gastly that had 15 attack (but pretty low stats otherwise). Now I have 2 beasts! No scanner use needed.
Yep.  My winters are 225-45-18 (same as OEM summers), and I cringe when I approach pot holes.
Kyogre if you easily want to solo Piloswine. Raikou for Azumaril, though I find it's not needed if you get ahead of the clock with a couple of Gengar first.
On a related note, how is it as a fire type? I only have Flareons at a high level. Everything else (including Entei) isn't powered up. Looking to find a weather boosted Torchic.
3600?
It's a 2002. Ain't nothing to brag about.
Why not let your teenage son form his own views? Being a "liberal household" kinda sounds like it's your way or the highway.
That's just ridiculous waste.  When I bought my house, I immediately replaced all 4 toilets with Toto Ultramax ones.
Russia really knows how to make hot tennis players. And apparently figure skaters.
Finally!
Pretty much expected it 100%.
I was scared to watch the entire time.
Bonus candies should be way more common than it is now.  It doesn't hurt anyone to increase the rate.
Yeah, it pops!
I use Lugia to anchor my solo Machamp raids.  2 Alakazams (lv35), 3 Espeons (lv35), and Lugia (lv 32.5) to finish it off (about 40 seconds left on the clock).  All with 15 attack.
Yeah, 35 is my soft cap when I power things up.  Seems to be a good happy medium.
It's the Shockmaster!  Hopefully he doesn't fall this time.
I'm in Toronto.  Where do you typically raid?  Also, where's a good place to go on Community day?  I wanna find somewhere to lure, possibly indoors, if it's cold.
Ugh, Six Point..
Have Coke zero instead.
Ugh, I really need to invest in Raikou.  I just barely beat Azumaril the other day, and only because my Groudons are so strong.
Man, a lot of the luchadores were fat AND in the cruiserweight division.
They should just stop doing it in general.  It's such a boring move.  Everyone does it.
Oh God that sucks.. Jerry is the voice of the summer.. reallyyy hoping Wilner doesn't get the job.
If that was the case in Canada, I'd buy one today.  They keep their prices high all year round, here.
Piloswine is very easy with Kyogre and Groudon.

Azumaril I had more difficulty with, but don't have powered up electrics.  Still soloed with help from Groudon.
I like her gear. This one, and the jeans one are both great looks.
Maybe she'll eat a giant sandwich live.
Mine keeps switching between the old and new design every few days, even after leaving the beta program and reinstalling.  Bup.
I have a really strong Sudowoodo that was part of my Scyther solo team.  It was so fun to use :D
Maybe they just really love HTC.
Is the last ball bug really fixed? I thought the last ball still is either a one shake escape, or crit catch.
How do you ignore spawns while running? I find it hard to bike or run with it, since I'll usually wanna slow down or stop to catch stuff.
They're surrounded by 35 invisible players.
The amount of shoveling this week has made me resort to using preworkout for it. Get some C4 and have at it.
Maybe you can open up a Shoneys there.
This is sad. We give refugees better living conditions than the homeless.
Same applies to light switches.  Old looking stuff sucks.  In this case, though, the plaster walls aren't helping either.
This is great news!  Now if they could cut that 4 mins in half, that would be great.
I've found that most things are now next day, instead of same day. I don't mind it too much, next day is still plenty fast for my prime needs.
Pretty much.
BIG TITUS BRAND!
Yeah it sounds scary as hell for the victims. That's the last thing you'd wanna see when getting out of the car to inspect things.
DDP!
So meta.
How does she like her new apron?
Knowing Niantic, it renders all 200 Pidgey in real time, zero caching, stacked on cards (which they apparently do with each menu).
Just put her in a hot dog eating contest on the pre show.
Looks like promotional pricing isn't affected. I'm on the $99 tv and gigabit bundle, so I'm happy about that.
That sounds like a class that I would've avoided at every possible cost.
She says she "eats healthy".  Big difference :D
Heh nevermind rooting, SafetyNet fails just for having an unlocked bootloader, even if you modify nothing.
I'm at 9 :(
I never knew that Ed Ferrara used to write for Duckman, that's pretty cool.  I like Russo and Ed, I don't care admitting that.
Classic Maharaja.
Was there ever any doubt that Brady would put over the young up-and-comer Nick Foles?
**BUSINESS IS ABOUT TO PICK UP!**
Big if true.
The city will burn down regardless of the win, or greased poles.
The catch rule is so stupid.  They should let way more catches be complete.  Screw all this "control" nonsense.
WHAT A GAME!  It's about time the heels get their comeuppance.
I'm up to 80 pinaps and 200 great balls so far.  Stock-piling for another 2 weeks will give me plenty of candy :)
How do you get a Team B ready?  Can't you only pre-select the first 6?
Pretty funny actually.
Also good for an EC stack.
They won't.  But Apple will make more profit by going with Intel.  So that's what they'll do.
Honestly, the X bezels are pretty massive all around.  I don't get how people say it's "edge-to-edge".
I just throw my empties in the blue box anyway.  I don't buy enough beer for it to ever be worth my while.  Storing, and then lugging bottles back and forth is dumb, just to save a few bucks.
As someone from Toronto, it just sounds really, really, far away.
Yeah, pricing in Canada sucks.  All I want is similar pricing to the US, for an unlocked, no contract phone.
Power.
Come on Rogers...
If Apple maps is better than something, then you KNOW that something really sucks.
The ESPN app notified me at that exact time. They knew what's up.
Looks like you're right, unless something big happens in the women's rumble.
Roller coaster üòé
There's never an excuse for getting (and then staying) fat.
Also zooms.
He comes from the highest educated universities. He needs to dumb himself down for these dumb rednecks.
That's too bad, I've been on the fence for a while and this thread doesn't help to push me into getting a few.
Or until your battery is over a year old.
Monkeys are assholes.
Yep, I don't need to justify my house's 6 cameras when I see something like this.

Also, never trust people who drive those fleet white domestic cars.
All of them.
Just don't go to the Olive Garden.  He'll be the one getting bread sticks with his fuck money.
Yup, and not crazy expensive. I like the keg.
As a Moto Z Play owner, my phone battery never dies.
You forgot to sprinkle church in there somewhere.
Because they look super cuddly.
Oh I don't have it enabled. I just thought of it for this situation.
Meh. Worth it.
I was there üòé
BOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!
Who cares? We get to stream it for free.
That thud was so satisfying.
I have 3 of them (living room, gym, basement).  I love the Mi Box.

It's also faster than my Sony X900e's built-in Android TV.
Further proof that putting stupid things on the back of their shirts just ruins it.
Hell, for less than $5000 he could've had cameras at home. I have 6, all pointed at entry points, with a DVR that lasts over a month before overwriting old footage.
It'll just make the chicken more plump and delicious.
Makes me wanna journal. That looks so awesome!
Samsung phones have a headphone jack.
Have you tried WPS?
iOS is one giant app drawer.
Shorts guy always makes an appearance.
Royal Rumble Brock Lesnar would be a beast.. more so.
She's looking more jacked than most of the women's roster.
She just sounds.. weirdly pitched.
Same. They're both bad, but wow.
That store looks fun.
I think it's a small-but-vocal minority, thankfully.
We had tons of Abra in Toronto yesterday.  Usually it's a lot of Bellsprout and Oddish, and occasionally Eevee.
So are airports.
That's just good guy Google showing you what it's like to use Siri and Apple Maps.
Didn't Google do something similar for phone cases?
I'll upvote this both times.
Is the Surf Pikachu visually different? Or just the moveset.
I have a prior commitment exactly during those 3 hours.  You can bet I probably won't catch the Surfchu, but will find a corner and mass evolve, even if it isn't the most efficient session.
I'm conflicted, I dislike Tims, AND I dislike the Liberal party.
I think everyone knew that decision was wrong at the time,  but the idiots still went ahead with it anyway. Well, or they were bullied into making the decision.
Mr. Jericho, your campaign seems to have the momentum
of a runaway freight train. Why are you so popular?
Pidgey is the GOAT.
They're basically all cookie cutter sports entertainers now.
Yes, and they've had this problem for a year now.  So while it's frustrating for X users now, it's been an ongoing issue for a lot of other users.
Same.  I'm nearing my max and need to start evolves!
Yep, my E90 was also a piece of shit, both inside and outside warranty.. costing me time, and costing me money.  I held onto that car for far too long.

My F30, although still under warranty for the next 2 years, hasn't had a hiccup.  I'm really happy with it.
I can also look at that icon, see the giant surrounding bezels, and say "that's not edge-to-edge".
You made a thing.
That stupid site should be banned from being posted here.
I have an x1 carbon, and it's a lightweight beast. It deserves the praise
I don't know.. my F30 328xi has been way better than my E90 325i ever was. If anything I've noticed vast quality improvements.
Welp, it just works indeed.
Vince has a twisted sense of humor.
Peyton Royce doe.
I only have 1 Aerodactyl , and I hatched it the first month the game came out.
Giving Apple a year is being very optimistic.  It took them like 5 years to go OLED.
Gotta put the brand over.
You could've found that out without waking into a dealership at all :)
Have you driven the new 911?  Heated seats, bluetooth, sunroof, light steering, the whole 9 yards.  It's actually pretty boring!
Just means I won't consider a Toyota when it comes time to buy a new car.  Even without Android Auto, I'm currently happy with BMW Connected Drive on my 328xi (and wife's Mazda stuff works fine too).  I won't buy a car that just offers an Apple platform, though.
Definitely a Hyundai, but my point still stands on Korean car quality.
Well, it's a KIA, so I'm sold that it did dumb things.
I feel sorry for him, but he's going to grow from this.
Especially true now, considering the Toronto subreddit mods locked its thread. So dumb.
> Painting all BLM members with a single stroke as productive as painting all police officers as racist violent people when they certainly are not.

Nah, we just let their leaders paint that picture for us.
I hope the media equally loves covering their retraction to the story.
Wow.. that's some pretty blatant censoring by having all those comments deleted after the fact :\
Her parents are probably why she made all this stuff up.  I doubt they'll give her a stern talking to about lying, but I sure as hell would bet that they'd beat her ass for taking off her hijab.  It's just... so backwards.
Buy a new router?  5GHz has been out for a long time, even as n speeds, before 802.11ac was ever out.
Well the clothes and shoes they're wearing also look pretty new and expensive.  So they probably stole those, too.
Your pic is better üòÇ
This looks fun as hell, I'm in!
Stamped concrete is also super useful at home.  At my last house, we did interlocking bricks, and even with the best sand stuff underneath, weeds came in.  So at my current house, we did stamped concrete instead.
Indeed.
Hyundai drivers.
Salmon Blazer is over.
I do the same.
He seems like such an awesome person.  I wonder if we could trade DeMar and a shitload of cash for him? Probably not, but still.
Becky is ripped.
Just when I thought there could be nothing worse than Subway food, a new variable gets thrown in.
I had to get gas. The roads were good. Any walking areas were bad, though.

I assumed early to mid 30s.
That sucks.

So that Apple can invent it 5 years later.
My 407 bill is pretty high every month, I would absolutely love that deal.  Why are you going to "miss" it?  Does that lucky promo expire?
The point of living in a big city is to AVOID long commutes.
Maybe this will stop the stupid power workers union commercials from playing on the radio. No one cares that you do your job. Everyone else does theirs, too.
So you're saying she's gonna cross 364 finish lines this year?
What a legend!!
Yeah, but his knee is on the Disco list.
That's 2 or 3 new cars out of nowhere. I wouldn't complain one bit with that kind of offer.
Cops love coffee. There was a break-in years ago near my house, and some came to check my cameras (actually caught the car from my home surveillance). The second I offered them espresso their eyes lit up.
The only attribute that matters.
Wtf did I just read
You can just wear it over another hat üòÅ

Or, if you're in Toronto or anywhere in the Northeast, you can stay inside and not raid, because no amount of hats will do.
Dude, my gas bill was huge last month. It's just how it is. I'm willing to sacrifice the pocket book for some comfort.
Laksus was some guy who crashed his Lexus into the water or something when joyriding.  I forget the details, but google lakesus rfd and I think it comes up in some way.
Woo woo woo!
I sold last April riiight before the actions, and then bought a bigger house the week after just 10 mins away from it.  It was the perfect storm.  No one can actually plan for that, but I was very, very happy with the results.
I keep my house at 23 most of the time.  22 if I'm feeling hot, and 24 if I really wanna crank it.  19.5 sounds brutal. 
Bahaha that was the best way back when.

Edit:  Also, Lake-sus
That was great. Might I also add that Vince Russo was right all along in hating lyin rattin from the very beginning.

FTFY.
Easy, just push triangle.
Fair point.
It's faster than the 805 that's in my Nexus 6.  Way faster.
Same.  And then years later we got "the box" that de-scrambled them all for free.  It was the greatest thing ever!
Yeah, but are you a trained researcher? Thought not. Checkmate.
JR calls that match soo well.
Your small bull is taller and heavier than your medium bull.
Damn, not available.
It's not that bad. That era had awesome hyped up themes.
Very true. I still have lingering pain from injuries and surgeries in the past 3 years. I didn't take any of the prescribed Percocet during recovery. Instead just extra strength Tylenol every now and then. Nowadays I can control my pain and inflammation with daily Omega 3s.
Fair point.
Ain't nobody got time fo dat.
Can you jump really high now?
Savage.
It's just too cold and snowy to play lately. I'm already looking forward a few months so I can play regularly again.
Not surprised at all at this point. It's too difficult for Niantic to cache images and update properties files.
Giggity!
Konnan show is great. Killing the town hmmm is KG on that one? If so, pass.
Pocket Casts is really good. I listen to everything on there, except for Russo, which needs to be in a web browser for Relm network stuff.
She legit looked like a porn star in that vid.
This is software dev 101 and they fail.
Apple will make a profit in EVERYTHING they do.  No exceptions.
Instead you got Chris Jericho.
Not having to make decisions is one of the key selling points of an iPhone. They'd never put a setting.
On Android you can just tap the lock icon on the bottom of the lock screen. Takes a second.
At least it's easy to up the calories and hit the gym to pack on mass. If it was the other extreme, good luck slimming down.
I actually thought he was talking about Grey Goose. Ah well.
Drivers who come from non snow climates and don't buy winter tires?
I've caught Corsola on vacation in the Philippines. It was near the water in Davao City.
I didn't realize we got screwed. In Toronto here, have Tauros. Even though it hasn't spawned much since Gen 2 dropped.
I can just imagine you handing it to someone, and them grabbing it and disappearing into their pocket.
Yeah, nothing funny about it.
Looks like Clippy.
That would piss me off so much. I always buy the more expensive eggs (green package in the pics, free run large). I only use eggs a few times a month, so a few bucks doesn't hurt.
I'm sure you're just asking for a friend.
Hah!
I thought it was a Snapchat filter, heh.
Sad!
The lights actually being lit makes this.
I have YET to try a Machamp solo raid (always find it with someone else to help), but I've already powered up 3 Espeons, 2 Alakazams, and a Lugia to anchor the team.  All level 33.5 or more, and all with 15 attack.  I am SO ready.
I'd buy it.  iOS and Apple's default apps are a dealbreaker.  Their hardware is top notch (aside from lack of ram).
iPhone X Shuffle.
Mi Box 4k.  Works great!  Only $100.  I own several (living room, gym, random tvs).
Hopefully what this means is that it'll be up in the Play store and regularly updated to not be shit now.
Yeah!  What's the point of me splurging for the x900e this year, when the app runs like garbage?  At least everything else works well enough.
It's a thing if you want a ton of empty calories and to be fat all winter.
Honestly, it would probably scare them straight if they were locked up for a night, or a week.  No need to lock them up forever, when they can see how brutal it is on the inside.

Edit:  I'm pretty sure this type of "punishment" was on Maury or something ages ago lol
I'm glad you're being downvoted here for trying to bait people.  Yes, it's entirely necessary, so that anyone in the area can be vigilant if faced with similar circumstances.

NO SYMPY!!
I hate this intersection so much.
I put my email address in for the book release. Seems like a good way to pay him.
Like anything else that's new, it'll be nice for the first month, and then go downhill fast as more people find out about it and ruin it.  See, any new Walmart location.
After seeing all that detail in the article, I'd say "very" is the understatement of the century.
I used Two men and a truck this year. I have no complaints. They even came in under the quote and charged the lower price. Moved from a relatively big house, to a big house. 3 guys for half a day was enough to cover it all.
Same. I just ignore it.
Also entirely true because it's Link's Awakening.
Man, she must sleep in ALL DAY to be up at 1am and be at the gym.

It's nice to see Velvet Sky stick up for Uncle Vince.
Off the top of my head.. Joe Carter. Roy Halladay. Hell, it could be even be Jose Canseco and it would be better than Ted Rogers.
Are they going to now make their Android TV prime video app work better on my x900e?  Thing is laggy as fuck.
Well as a long-time TSN watcher and subscriber, I try to watch as much TSN content as I can, while avoiding as much Rogers/Sportsnet content as I can.  Which by the way, is extremely hard to do now, since they own the rights to just about everything.

Sportsnet quality is trash.
You'd get trench foot.
Should've posted it 10 years ago, and then reposted it every other year.
I haven't been in like 20+ years, maybe it's time to check it out again.  I just sorta associate it with the ghetto now.
Honestly, anyone coming from up there probably just wants to know the minutes between Vaughan Metropolitan Centre and Union.
I know this area pretty well. There's actually a free l3 charger at the powerstream building just north of there. City view and Major Mac.
Always a valid defence.
The first snow of the season is ALWAYS a work from home day for me.

That's hilarious! I hope someone on the Konnan podcast sees this and asks him about it next week.

That's so sad.

Nothing wrong with Bob, but I haven't listened to his show since Overdrive came on the air.  Now that's some healthy competition.
Gregg Zaun was a crappy baseball player who criticized good baseball players on TV. Nothing of value was lost.
You should call everyone a stupid idiot.
Unlimited bandwidth for Netflix wouldn't be net neutral.
Wow, that was a lot of effort. Good job.
Yep.  I do like 3 legendary raids a month.  I have a busy work schedule and can't just raid all day every day (like most my local Discord group does).
Or "you're logging in wrong"
Hehe
That looks soooo cool!
That's hilarious :D
Stop using Apple Maps.
As someone who went to Melbourne over Christmas and New year's a few years back, it was really weird being on a beach with 40¬∞ weather on Christmas Eve.
Pretty much.  A light breeze (or a cat) shouldn't be able to knock over a Christmas tree.

Yeah. As soon as she said she's healthy in that post, it's all fair game. She's in a business where being in shape matters. Suck it up.

Electronics are the name of the game this Black Friday.  Got my hands on the Sony X900e series (65"), a PS4 Pro, and a bunch of other tech stuff from Amazon.  Dropped a lot of cash, but recently moved to a bigger house and want to furnish the basement.
Her and her explanation are both on the list.
Do you really like having their big ugly ticker at the bottom of the screen at all times? TSN was much better, way back when they had the rights.
I really miss Owen.
Wow, very well said. It's also refreshing to see here that people notice the huge bezels all around the phone. Every time I bring it up, I get blasted for it, like I'm seeing something that isn't there.

It's the NDP. They don't know anything about reality.

That is the very top of the kek pile.
She won't even show up. And if she does, she won't even make it past the swim. You can bet your retirement that she won't finish the race.
Maybe a jet pack.
That's actually extremely cheap (maybe something small like 16"), so don't complain üòÇ
Well enjoyment time is money.  I spent $20 and bought a bunch of incubators, so that when the 2x stardust kicks in, I can capitalize on it.
I'll continue to pay my 3 bucks a month for the brand.  I support Russo, at least he's entertaining.

Between that, and when she took the powerbomb on the outside, Lita has taken some damage back in the day.
Me too thanks
Best outfit ever.
Plus that Elizabeth outfit.
Plus Corporate Kane behind him.
Interesting. I've been using Pegasus for years now, but haven't thought of looking at much else.
I'm jealous as fuck.
God they are way behind on this stuff.
Bro I gotta be honest with you, and this is a straight up shoot. Vince Russo is entertaining as hell.
Once again: No Konnan, no Russo.  No respect for the great Disco Inferno.
They'd think it was a gay bar. Something something community.
I have MANY friends and family who are elementary school teachers.  They all work less than 40 hours a week, get summers off, and have been working the job long enough that by now their union has ensured that their pay is decent.

I don't need to know the specifics (I don't work in that field), but it's obvious from what I see and hear.
That's like the opposite of elementary/high school teachers.  Get paid well to work non-full-time hours with summers off (but they still complain).
Number 1 reason why I don't shop at budget grocery stores.
Jeans last forever. Or, well, at least 5-10 years. Spending a few hundred bucks is well worth it. Every pair of jeans I own look amazing on me, and even though they were expensive as hell, they were bought years ago, so I don't feel the expense any more.
What's stopping someone from causing serious damage to people by poisoning foods with it at restaurants or grocery stores? Sounds like a nightmare scenario.
You would think this would be common sense..
I can confirm that. I have Rogers gigabit and cable tv for $99 month for the next year (have already had it for about a year). Edit: Toronto.
No.
I'm sure Apple Maps will be garbage, even with it being connected lol
Oh man haha
> literally


It totally happened, come on you guys. Who among us hasn't gotten into casual arguments in parking lots, or while "running" at 4am?
Heel move.
So, intercontinental object.
Well then who the hell is upvoting these posts?
That probably still sends the wrong message.
The hair part made me laugh more than the weight.
He is.
They chose a good picture, that's for sure.
That just makes no sense in relation to OLED. I used a Nexus 6 for 3 years in Toronto weather, and even dropped it in the snow a few times. Touch screen never acted any differently.
So you're telling me there's a chance.
That would be a serious tattoo, at least for a minute.
No Konnan or Russo podcasts? What do you have against the great Disco Inferno?
Honestly if PoGo existed 10 years ago I would've been Soo happy on those long campus walks.
I was able to solo Porygon pretty easy with 4 Machamps (1 of them 30 ish, then the other 3 all mid 20s), and then a dragonite (35ish) and egg (35ish).
It also won't come with a quick charger.
All of them.
Hm?  I'm already married and own a house in Toronto.  I don't live in a 500 sq ft shoe box.
I don't eat KD..
My favourite ball player died today.
I have no idea what half those cities are
Winter tires are now on both cars. I was bored tonight, it's how I coped with the Halladay news.
Cool name.
This fucking SUCKS.
Noooo!  My favourite player ever... Fuck..  This is devastating.
Honestly.  I only buy ketchup once a year.  Might as well get something crazy good for $20, instead of something meh for $4.
Apple isn't good enough to develop algorithms or software to compete with Google in HDR+ photo quality. For proof, look no further than their buggy iOS 11.
That's interesting.  I was looking at S8's a few months ago and the ads looked exactly the same.  I didn't trust them at all.  I wouldn't want to actually go and meet these people and see their fakes, though.
All the lumens. All of them.
It's like Pokemon Go, but has an end game.
Yeah, if I had a car that high mileage, it's not going to a mechanic, it's going to the scrap yard.
> It was a mile round trip. 

Hope you enjoyed the 600m it registered.
Yup, same.  Haven't missed a streak yet, but had to head out to the local park in -20 celcius here in Toronto last winter just to keep it alive.
Sis is probably fat.
4mm is too little. Those are in need of replacement, not one more season. Especially for winter tires, where their best years are the first ones.
It's a ton of calories, that's all I see.
Jesus, I had forgotten about that.
Probably to just get more views.
Where's the crazy rain they said is coming? It just randomly sprinkles for a while, then stops.
I'm okay with it.
Yes, come to the most expensive city in Ontario. Don't go to Barrie or something, that wouldn't make any sense at all.....
He worked himself into a shoot.
Dude, I love Vince Russo's shows.  I subscribe to the brand to support the guy (plus Castrating is now paid only).  The arguments between Vito and Kenny were legendary this week.
The only Sasha that should exist is heel Sasha.
Hard to believe they're the same person.
My Moto Z Play runs Pogo without heating up at all. It's amazing. My old Nexus 6 would start burning before anything even spawned on the map.
Better than some basic income nut coming in here and saying the same thing (but for not working).
That's a good joke. Him being suspended for it is an even bigger joke.
The name is fine in itself. I support the message that the name would imply. It's that the leadership hide behind the name and do and say asshole-ish things, instead.
This is why you drill into the tile grout to mount things in your shower.  Screw keeping the house pretty for a potential next owner.  This house is mine, I will make it mine.
My stock Z Play is on 7.1.1 with the latest security patch.
No surprises there.
As a former Nexus 6 owner who loved that phone, get the Moto Z Play.  It's faster and better in every way (battery life!), except for the camera.  Oh, and it's dirt cheap.  I got mine brand new in box on Kijiji for just over $300.
Pretty much Russo's philosophy, too.  He always said the show should be about the business and politics of the product.
The wine cellar is really nice. If anything it's giving me ideas for my house, now.
Their headline mocks its bezels, while the iPhone 8 has bigger ones.
So majestic.
Cooooool!
Font would have to be too small.
No one likes having neighbours who don't take pride in their property.  

If you can afford to live in the area, you can afford to change light fixtures, garage doors, etc., when they are aged and falling apart.
Unlocked bootloaders fail safetynet :(
... except for the fact that the people living all the way up there wouldn't be able to afford them.
Moto Z Play.
I like this one better.
Pixel cameras are legendary.
I am.
That was embarrassing.
Something something leather.
How did you guys not notice them moving their shit in?
Looking for milfs on Yonge.
Pro tip: Costco sells battery boost packs for $90 that work in justttt such an occasion.
I would definitely pay to have no more advertising in Snapchat. I don't a shit about the Kardashians.
Have you seen Apple's profit margins and earnings? They absolutely will skimp on anything they can. Key example is storage and ram on iPhones, especially before this year.
I'll allow it.
Wow, the iPhone photo really loses a lot of detail.
Who's gonna tell it no?
SHE'S FAT!!
And be worse than a $30 Anker one.
Let me know if you ever figure it out. Also in Canada.
Give it away? To me, preferably, but to someone anyway.
Probably smelled like one, too.
I would give an instant down vote for a U2 reference, but that's against the rules üòÇ
I had the One X, M7, and then the Nexus 9. That was the time to end it.
Such a mark.
Randomly did a tier 2 raid at the mall last night while shopping.. Got 20 potions and nothing else. So fun.
Did everyone boo him?
Hey, even trained researchers make mistakes.
Amazon? I usually find stuff I need on there. Just bought a circular saw (Bosch) with prime next day shipping.
At least TIMMY will get the order right. Also, I'm really glad your post didn't end with some basic income BS.
She seems great. He seems like a pain in the ass.
You're definitely trying to start something.
Lies, oh he lies.
This will end up on Castrating the Marks next week, guaranteed.
I like this.
I want photo books to become available in Canada.  I'd order a few the second it came out.
Lol that was amazing
So, a bunch of jabronis?
That's the only reason I bought mine.
Thanks for clarifying.
Yeah but wtf is Keswick
I wanna buy one. Looks like the Etsy page isn't around, though.
I was okay with them removing jail bait and a bunch of racist subs, but the fat people hate stuff was pretty entertaining.
You're the best!  I googled this issue, and the toast source app narrowed it down to my security camera app too.
Not only that, but what choice do we really have in the matter? I had 2 surgeries last year, and they used what they used. I wouldn't have known the difference even if they told me what they used, or given me a choice.
Same.
Anyone would.
The X has really big "side" bezels all around the phone.  It's pretty obvious when you stop paying attention to the notch.  So the phone looks pretty big.
If their security cameras aren't good enough, they need upgrades.  My old surveillance system was pretty bad resolution, but my new one (recently moved) is high-res and crystal clear, even at night.
So it's crack that makes someone defend people who are worthy of ridicule.. who'da thunk it.
Me too. It would be unfair to a wife that stays the same weight otherwise.
Fat mothers just love to blame their weight on their babies.  I have a coworker who does so, and the kid's like 10 years old now lol
No.
Well played.
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
You're doing a good job ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Be nice to the human.
Wow, I feel the same way. I had so many C64 games.
Are you a cat?
Oh we definitely saw. But if anything, I can't unsee the big bezels surrounding the entire phone.
At least this time it actually is watching it for the story.
I dunno, there's a bald dude at work who's ripped. He just looks like a jacked turtle. An ugly one.
These mockups always do that. They're sneaky. Then you move in and realize you've made a big mistake.
It's barely a thing. Every post is ancient.
See Disco gif, upvote Disco gif.
Or, you know, someone who's out of shape.
Can confirm. Wow, there must be one giant shit pile somewhere.
That helped. I just kept looking at her butt.
Corsola.  I got it on vacation, and I'm powering it up to max!  I don't care how much stardust it costs.  I've already brought it to level 30, from 5.
That's exactly what first came to mind. They had to work even harder to get in because of that so called privilege.
Bork?
So is this thing a Pokestop or gym? Because that would be prime property.
Of course it's York U.
Were you expecting anything less?
Did you see the calorie counts at Costco? It's insane!
Agreed. Pizza Nova is the best chain. Thin crust, well done. It's good stuff.
Run for Premier somewhere else.
At this rate, they'll be going through the entire alphabet.
All you had to say was zombie pirate.
What about fat doink?
That's ridiculous, wow.
Calculate your TDEE and stick with it. Results don't come right away, but when they do, they feel like they pile up fast.
I was in Australia on a beach a few years ago on Christmas Eve. It was 40 degrees and sunny. It felt REALLY weird.
The Batista thing is still memorable to this day.
Jesus, stop looking already.
MEGA ZOOM IN ON THE FLOWER THROW!
It HAS to be.
Yeah no, the S8 already looks better than the X. No need for them to take any design cues from it.
Uh oh, he called it a belt at the end of the promo.
YOU'RE ONLY ALLOWED TO SMOKE ON STEINER SATURDAYS!!
Hey, she's eligible for 48 hours of overtime today!
Yeah, like she ever thinks before she speaks.
Yes, if it's a weekend and you have nothing to do but stay in and enjoy the sights and sounds. No, if it's a work day and you have to walk and drive in it.
Sounds more like a porn star name.
That's still peanuts for a single detached home in a "good area".  I could sell mine and buy 4 of them.
This spot cleans up nice when taken from the right angle.

Also, it looks like he's proposing to Becky Lynch.
Owen :(
Breaking news:  Apple "invents" Galaxy Note only 7 years after its initial launch.
Do people not turn their house alarms on at night?  It literally is a push of a button.
Hah especially since Vice really is trash. The quote's accurate.
The X has giant side bezels when compared with the S8.
You just visit the right places.
Heh.
Oh damn, I always buy grey goose, but Costco doesn't sell booze here in Toronto.
Link?
You don't name logs, you assign Couric values to them.
Thanks. Bought mine 5 years ago and it's still in the green.
But then how would you keep up with all the bullshit celebrity gossip?
The "show us your home screen" thing is just comical for iOS.  It might as well just be "show us your covered-by-icons wallpaper".
Yeah, a little too vague to be useful.
No one wants to do that.
First one is the best one.
I just walk my Corsola, since I caught it on vacation.  Every time I get enough candy (3 for now), I power it up.  It's got decent IVs, so I'm going to max it out, just because I want to :)
A lot more.
Don't forget Lions, Tigers, Bears, and Disco.
He Stole Bob Backlund's theme!
Yeah, it's ruined now.
Apple would drop the charging port, but not include a wireless charger with the phone. That'll be $50 extra.
They look really big around this entire phone. The edge to edge screen on the S8 looks way better.
No one's copying a design flaw/limitation.
Well that escalated quickly.
They can't be THAT hard to catch.
Hey, we don't know his TDEE.
They also said they would only adopt wireless charging when it was ready. Instead they put in a slow Qi charger.
Nope.
Thanks!
You work fast.
Agreed. Just installed the apk and it runs really well.
Makes for some nice sleep.
So why do my "simply amazing" mons with its stats appraised as its best feature always show 13 iv? I swear I have a few perfect mons, but iv checkers instead tell me 13, 13, 13.
No notch confirmed 2 years from now.
Nah, they'd be too cheap to put such high capacity batteries in their phones.
That was fantastic.
Yep, he's better off spending $150 on a 7 downie St shirt. They fit like a glove. I have a closet full of them. They're my go to night out shirt.
God I love the keg. It's cheap enough to go often, but the calorie count keeps me away.
I wanna play against her!  I know I'll get slaughtered, but still.
Yet still a specific situation that any competent development team would've caught during FVT.
Honestly, the FUCK YOU should go directly to Apple.  I would never buy an iPhone (I dislike iOS), but their decision has had a trickle-down effect that fucks me.
I don't have an answer, but that's funny as hell.
Hey, it's part of the Russo podcasts intro.
That's silly. It just works. Everyone says so.
My last 3 cars have gone up in purchase price ($30000, $45000, $65000).

My last 3 phones have gone down in purchase price ($850, $650, $350).
It's okay bro I believe you.
That's a bad comparison.  The Pixel has the best smartphone camera out there by miles.  My lawn mower takes better pictures than my Moto Z Play.  Battery life is legendary, but it ends there.
Not to mention it's really dark there. There needs to be more effective lighting in that entire area.
Lol it just works.
They put themselves over more than anything I've ever seen.
It's really rare here in Toronto.
Not only did they pull off the design better than Apple, but they did it 6 months earlier.
Would it kill them to cut that 4 min time in half?  I hate having my eggs stuck at x.98 and having to lose all that extra distance waiting for the hatch.
USB 3.0 would cut into their giant profit margins too much.
I was in high school during this time.  Malenko was boring as fuck.  I was always cheering when Jericho made fun of him in their storyline.
That's the real question right there.
Looks like it's just as durable as their charging cables.
I'm not
As someone who has non-techie family members who all survive well with iPhones, the X looks absolutely unusable for them.
Lol this is an instant purchase for me.
Also maybe a good way to end up on some sorta list.
Has an iPhone. Can't afford lunch.
> And no, I don‚Äôt use my phone when I‚Äôm inside someone.

You and I have very different definitions of this.
They're just huge Chris Jericho marks.
If you drive on the highway, you pay.  Seems pretty simple to me.
And 100% bought used.
Have you tried using Google DNS? I'm not sure if it will help, but it's worth a shot.
Same. So hot in this city!
Same
