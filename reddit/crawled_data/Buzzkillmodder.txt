I'll admit that was a little misleading. What it meant was that it seems like it was Nintendo's fault at first. ("Nintendo switch hacked" would lead many people to think it was a flaw on Nintendo's part)

Not saying you are wrong, but where did the Overwatch Team say anything about the CPU being the issue? All I can find is them saying it would be very challenging (and that was a year ago). Also they talked some about how it would be hard to maintain a 4th platform.

No I have not created a game but I am in to technology and detailed information about almost anything related to electronics. I am aware that this does not mean I am qualified to make definitive statements, I like to see what the real experts say.

A GPU is the main factor when it comes to gaming (I am sure you know this) although a CPU is also important. Does part of me wish Nintendo waited for Tegra X2? Yes. (only part of me though, as this would have likely brought a price increase, on top of having to wait much longer). It seems the switch is a hybrid of home console and portable console quality games (just as the switch itself is). There are many portable quality games on the switch, and many full home console games, but there are many games that require too much power for  hybrid system. Overwatch could very well be one of these, but as game devs get more used to the hardware of the switch they can do more with it. (See: games on Xbox 360 in 2005 vs 2013)

I think we all know overwatch could run on the switch, it is just a matter of how it will look and the FPS.
Thanks anyway!
Not saying you are wrong.... but how did I have it when I made a brand new account last week?
I mean, my laptop does have 2.2 Ghz but it only have 2 cores. The switch CPU has 4 cores @ 1 Ghz. Clock speed does not mean very much in recent years because a CPU can do more work per cycle.

Yes, the Tegra X1 used in the switch is not that powerful but it sure seems to be enough.

Also, the CPU is not the main factor in this. The GPU is. And the GPU with the Tegra X1 is more than enough to run games like Overwatch and Fortnite without sacrificing much.

The hello emote is free right? Everyone has it?

Because I made another account for my friend and he had the hello emote by default. Thing is, I don't have the Hello emote! I never have. How did he have it right away if I don't have it?
JUST HOTFIX A BUG IN THE GAME FILES, COME ON EPIC YOU TRASH GAME DEVS FIX UR GAME GEEZ.
I know what they said... but I can run the PC version on my trash laptop on minimum settings! Sure it does not look very good, but I know that the switch is more powerful than my laptop could ever hope to be, so with some optimization overwatch could be fine on the switch!

Now, my aim with a controller sucks. I originally played overwatch on Xbox (the game was a gift) but I got the game on my PC during a sale. Now, I tried to go back and play the xbox version for fun but I SUCK... massively. I can play spatoon but that's different for sure.
Quick trip to friends house and don't want to bring your PC/full size console

Playing at places that have WiFi but you would not necessarily bring a TV and a full size console (and have to plug it all in)

Playing around the house instead of just where you have your PC/Console

This are just some examples! :)

As you mentioned, playing the base game on the go (even if most people don't have it). I actually think that having this on the switch might sell a good amount of Save The World copies. People would have the incentive that they can have a Fortnite experience anywhere, maybe they don't feel like playing Save The World at home because they wanna play fast-paced BR. On the switch you could play Save The World when you can't play BR. (Not to mention that people could do the daily challenges in Save The World for V-bucks before they even get home)




Ur mom
I know it has been 17 days but I figured I would help out. 

V-Bucks can be shared across all platforms.... expect PS4. Unfortunately Sony did not want people to have in-game currency (bought with real money) have the ability to be cross platform. 

Thankfully Epic kinda gets around this with the fact that anything bought with V-bucks does transfer to every platform, including PS4! :) 
I suggest you wait until around a week into season 4. They had a sale at the end of season 2/ beginning of season 3. Also a sale at the start of season 2, but I think that was a holiday sale.
Yeah! I am also a gold player in Overwatch and I could not aim for the life of me when I first started fortnite!  I would say maybe 1-2 weeks of casual play and I started to notice that I was not terrible.

 I recommend not going for a win at first, start out going for the kills to get used to PvP. Some people say to land titled towers for this, but I recommend salty springs (or the general area, there is a factory slightly north and some buildings to the south).

 I actually started landing at the house above salty but below the factory (it is not named on the map) and it is not very reliable. Sometimes you get no gun (rarely). Generally there is no one that lands there but every now and then there is. If you land here, 
after you loot this house either head up to salty or down to the factory.

Also, if you do crossplay with your son and he is playing on console he will be playing against only PC players with you.

 Essentially it goes Mobile < Console < PC. 

So, the mobile user can either play with only mobile players, play with console players (+ other mobile players that are playing with console players), or play with console and PC players (+ other mobile and console players playing with PC)

Console is the same way, only that they can't chose to play against mobile players.

But, a PC player can't choose to play against console or mobile.
No! It is a very good gun!

You answered your own question. We will get them at "Christmas or Halloween"
Says who?
Oh... Ouch. Didn't think of that :/
That is unfortunate :(
Well.... isn't that something that epic is not liable for? 

It is not like this is a feature in their game, it is people selling the code outside of their game. Like rocket league trading is a feature in game but no money can be exchanged. People have a 3rd part market where you can "buy" the items and then the person trades them to you for nothing in game. But if someone gets scammed that is not the devs responsibility.

Not saying that this isn't the reason it got removed or that you are wrong, just confusing that they would do this for that reason
Oh, okay! 
You mean like peoples accounts were getting hacked and then people bought friend codes on that account to use for them self?

Other games have a similar system, how come they don't have an issue?
Why were they removed and why are they unlikely to come back? If they are unlikely to come back why are they "temporarily" removed?
Oh okay. thanks
I am fairly certain my area was sold to Frontier (that is the name on my router, tv box, and on the truck the installation guys were in) and it works as well as it did when we had FiOS with Verizon.

Was I just lucky?
soooooo... the 10 tier bonus now says "not refundable" yet the refund feature is not back? (or do I just not know where it is since I was not on this morning?)
Ummm.... FiOS anyone?? My upload is 140 and my download is 150... (officially 150/150 but it is pretty close) 
Ana checking in
Yeah ikr. How does one click on an item in the store to preview it, and end up going over to click on the purchase button? Like you would have to move over halfway across the screen (from rotating the preview) to accidentally click the purchase button!
RIP its $60

Roadhog with Symmetra gun.... hmmm .... interesting. I can keep my hook, right? Not that bad!
If you need to do something else, you can just camp in a bush until the storm kills you and you can get decent xp. Just land in a bush, hide in the bush, and do whatever you need to do (like homework if you're in school)
Worst case scenario, you spend 150 v-bucks from the 1,500 in the battle pass to get that final tier.

Don't think you'll have to do that though!
More like $40 DLC then vs Only part of *free* DLC now
*When your post is 8 months too late
Oh okay! 
Yeah, I had to lower game settings to minimum and run 2 fortnite games at the same time on different accounts
You grinded all of that on mobile?!?!? or just some? 

If you spent an entire weekend playing fortnite on your phone.... I feel for your thumbs man
This! I was not able to play all season so I bought the 10 tier bonus that was in the shop on discount.
Nooooo, these are very useful!

Taste the rainb- Oh
Uh, I have had my computer sitting on tile floor since late 2014 when I built it, and the only time I have opened it since was to insert another ram stick.... Should i be worried?.
Omg. he checked into the hotel using the same tactic in home alone 2
In was referencing your post on r/gtaonline
Perfect amount? Am I doing something wrong? I have been playing almost everyday since they came out and found none
Ugh! Should I buy fresh or flippin sexy? Or neither?
What about the scar?
Hey what are the odds 


No microtransactions
Yeah, overall nerf but if they are talking about only certain aspects it could be a buff. Like the no ammo for sonic wave
https://imgur.com/a/ltL1Bi2

See?
Yeah I know, it does not make sense...

For an example:
It says 0 xp and 400 battle pass bonus 
You sure? Like have you done the math and saw that you are you had more xp added to the meter than it said?
What am I doing wrong when looking at the leaderboard. It also says 26th or something and I don't even know what it is for
The only spot where this would be a buff to already good players is maybe on cylinders like the one on lijang tower (forgot the name of the specific map out of the 3, it is the one with the two bridges) because he can just ride around it forever now. This is also a nerf though, considering that you can't go around it with skill and also can a ton of speed anymore
I know! This is so annoying when my team insists on going somewhere and then maybe half the team realizes that is a bad idea and goes somewhere else, so not only is half the team going to struggle at a place that the other team already landed but no one agreed on a place to land besides that. Making the team very spread out
Ah okay! I hope they don't remove it either!
Is that with or without the 2 tier bonus? Either way you got the John wick cause of next week challenges and this week
I didn't play the game for over 2 weeks.... I played other games! Now I'm back playing but it's not the only thing I play.
Yes please! Would be very funny if it does work and you get the 20 extra battle stars
What does RTG mean?

I also read someone saying that they said the infinite energy is going to be removed in the future once they work a few things out. 
Waaaaaiiiiiit. This is gone??? I lowered the music in the game awhile ago (Not mute) because it was so loud. I have been hearing this the whole time, at least I thought I was....
It's because Oceania server is meant for people in.... Oceania. Those servers are probably good, just that a lot of people were connecting from Europe and North America so they would have a ton of lag for them.

wait.... wha???
Yeah, I could see that. I missed out on 3 weeks of daily challenges but Ima be at dark voyager at least. I want to save mine for season 4 battle pass also, but what if they make it an upfront cost?

I have some extra v bucks from a few weeks ago....... I don't wanna talk about it ...... and I will probably be able to get john wick with enough for next season.

^^^^^^Why ^^^^^^^did ^^^^^^you ^^^^^^^buy ^^^^^$25 ^^^^^^v-bucks ^^^^^you ^^^^^idiot ^^^^what ^^^^^^were ^^^^^you ^^^^^^^thinking ^^^^^^^^^ughhhhhhhhh
In order to complete it completely for free I am pretty sure you need to do most of the daily challenges. Have you been doing that since the season started? If not you might have to buy a few tiers if you intend to fully complete it.

Good news is you can buy some with v-bucks from the battle pass.
My aim was jank with keyboard and mouse when I first switched. Within a week you'll start to feel better, eventually topping your aim on console.

Be careful if you still want to go back and play some on console. I can't aim on console AT ALL anymore, even worse than I was with a keyboard and mouse when I switched.

Thanks! I'm in NA. The weird thing is that last time I played comp (February) there was a consistent 4-6 people in voice chat, usually with at least 3 talking
I played 2 matches. No one was toxic.... In one match people were nice and in one match no one talked!! I lost both but the first one didn't feel that sour. However, ya wanna know what they both had in common? There was a group of 3 people (different group both times) that would stay in THERE OWN VOICE CHAT the whole game! So only 2 people are hearing me. One of the groups didn't respond but the other said "oh we have our own triangle"  ugh. If you wanna have your own triangle play quick play! We coulda won those matches if we were more coordinated because everytime we would come close to captureing the point! But 1 or 2 people were off in some where else (not coming back from spawn, somewhere in the enemies territory)
Does anyone know if the incapacitated player still gets a win?

And then....? gotta finish the game mate
Maybe once more people decided to hop on it got bad. Should get better because I think that a lot of people wanted to rank for the sake of ranking (for end of season rewards)
Yes!


Don't see it happening though, since this is a team based game. I expect that the spin off competitive modes will only be team based modes. (One can hope though)
Unpopular opinion here: Watching overwatch (Be it OWL or anything else) makes my feel burnt out on overwatch. PLAYING overwatch makes me never want to stop.

Maybe I'm just to optimistic that when my team loses I am still having fun.
Solo or Group?
Oh, so is this where that flesh eating virus in the future comes from?
"Run MEKA save yourself"
Literally just lower her damage by 5% and it will change.
Did you quit quick play? That's still tons of fun
I understand if competitive mode is unfun, but I have been finding a lot of fun in quick play. Everytime is lost last night, it was a close game (except for once). And one time when I lost I was playing with the most wholesome team, it was amazing, but most of the time no one was talking (which is better than toxic).
Yes! I agree
Yeti or snowball
Why sad face?
^^^^^Oh ^^^^^^okay ^^^^^^^enjoy! ^^^^^^^^^^...broken ^^^^^^^^^^^hips
Exactly! it is hard to get past a certain "barrier" if you play heroes that rely on having a good team. Yes, all heroes rely on this but obviously some more than others (like zen, as you mentioned)
What is even worse if when you are saving for the anniversary event and you decide to buy the Genji skin for 3000 because you figured that the event going on for 3 more days was a sign that you should get it. Annnnnd I only have 40 min on Genji. (this was Year Of The Dog)

Coins are good! especially with the upcoming anniversary event! All of those sweet dances are going to be 250 instead of 750 (expect for the 3 new heroes) and those amazing skins from last year will be 1000 instead of 3000! (again, except for any new skins, but there are already so many amazing ones from last year I would love to see them top it)
That is why op is saying that they would **buy** (**$$$$$$**) a fully fledged story mode. I am sure this would not only sell well, but that it would get a good amount of people back into the base game (which means more people buying loot boxes **$$$$$$$$**) 

Yes, I am aware that a real story mode would cost lots of money to make.
Yeah. Yeti got so boring. But mei snowball is not *that* bad.
Yes! You die, and someone else takes your place.

Your conciousness is not transferred. So you do not continue just everything about you
Thing is, I wouldn't notice but for a different reason. I would be dead
It would still be you to everyone else, but the you that died stopped experiencing life. so really you just killed yourself and everyone else is unaware
Well, tbf they did what people asked for which was less dupes
Ah. I knew someone with parents like that (but he bought shark cards, which I guess is better in some ways because it's not gambling but still)
Is he at least using his own money? Maybe then he has a chance to realize that effects of it early on
If you could teleport, but you died every time and a new body was made that is an exact replica of everything you are (personality, appearance, memories, etc.) Would you do it?

It's weird because say everyone had access to be able to do that, and you decided that you wanted to go to a friends house. You teleport there and even though, to him, you are the exact same person you never got to go to your friends house. You died. Also, your friend would not be talking to the same person they talked to last time.

This is weird man.

(btw I obviously wouldn't do it, why would I do something for the convince when it does the exact opposite and kills me) 
See, there used to be. This was in the beta. Blizz decided that epics and legendaries needed a nerf, so they made them 33% less likely to drop, but increased the designing put into each one by 30%. They also allowed them to move while dropping and take 50% less excitement away from the player.

Figures, I got architect recently (don't think it was during the event tho)
Yeah they're are upped. That's just because of the math with the event loot and the base game loot being on different drop tables
Yeah, instead of someone saying "just one more box" you can see that you're already not gonna get something good
Yeah, it sucks to get a symettra legendary in an event loot box (well, at least for most players)


Yeah, the pants are sweet. My problem is, you only see the pants in the hero select screen. The gun looks cool as well! 

However, Jazzy also has a cool gun and the music swap. This means that there is more that can be enjoyed by the player when using Jazzy.

So, essentially:

**Equalizer:** Cool gun
**Jazzy:** Cool gun + music

Not to mention Jazzy is gonna cost less.
Ah, that makes sense. also, were the drop rates worse when they first added them? I skimmed through a video of a guy opening 30 boxes (in the beta) and it was most blue and grey. Maybe 4 epics, and only 1 legendary.
I KNOW it seems PRETTY COOL!
>*really* easy

Erm, have you tried legendary (or even expert) on the story version?

Yes, not as hard as uprising on legendary but still very hard.
Yeah, gonna be interesting what they do to summer games (considering it is the first event that will occur 3 times)
The best 4 man team (if your not playing all heroes mode) is Moira, Reaper, Genji, and Mccree
Alright, thanks man. I'll have to strategize with my group for this new comp, but I think we can do it
From what I remember (It has been a while since I played on console) there is no option to do this on console. You have to use the consoles built in method of recording.

They still shouldn't have been so mean about it, like wtf.
But you don't get to the pants when playing him :/
This one or Jazzy? I like the music swap a lot, as well as the look of jazzy. But this skin looks good and has a slightly better looking weapon (imo). I can't decide.

Before Jazzy and this one, my favorite lucio skin was Andes. I use that one right now, so if I ever want to take a "break" from the music swap I could.
Quick tip, if you are going to play Retribution on legendary (not all heroes) the best comp is Moira, Reaper, Genji, and Mccree 
Noooooooooo. I am sure you are happy your post made it to the front (congrats) but I REALLY don't want this to get patched because it is fun to do.
I'm gonna try do make it snow with mccree
uh, weird. Thanks for informing me

That's probably why Nintendo started to use pre loading like everyone else
Don't forget to save some for anniversary! 
Well, considering the size it would have been 10 minutes. But not considering the fact that the servers are melting right now.

I have 150mb/s normally, so 
150/8 =18.75 MB/s (lets do 17 because we know it is not always max speed) 
12,000/17 = 705 seconds and 705/60 = 11.75 minutes
Ah man! I wish that I had realized that before I got 30% done with downloading this update. Don't wanna mess it up now.
I know the patch is big, especially for a patch, but 10 minutes is not enough time to do much work :/

At least I'll get some done
Is mercy's ability to resurrect also in the lore? If it is, is it something she can perform on a whim or is it more complicated than it is in the game?
No. The faggio has Ruiner 4000 missiles. They are infinite and can lock on to anyone from across the map.
I felt terrible after one day in the bed (as in I felt like I wasted so much time), but I definitely like staying at home all day.
I mean, I did those things. Nothing else that I can think of though.

Ruiner 2000, vigilante, and deluxo. The oppressor has something very close, but a little less accurate.

Ruiner 2000 - 8 missiles |
Vigilante - 30 |

Oppressor - 20 |

It is still under warranty but I don't feel like waiting 3 weeks to play tv mode unless trying my self could make me have to buy another one
Are you talking about the whole 3rd party dock bricking the console thing?
Looking back, this was a dumb idea.

I put my phone in my dock just because I was curious if it would charge it. I did! For 3 seconds. My phone stopped charging and the green light on the dock started blinking. Whatever, just take the phone out. I put the switch in and nothing works. The switch DOES turn on but it take 7 seconds and it just displays on the switch's screen. I take the switch out (all is normal with it) and unplug everything from the dock. Doesn't change a thing! I looked this up and no one seems to have posted this.

edit:I guess it messed with the AC adapter and the dock, because I unplugged from the wall instead of from the switch and now it works!

Phew!

Nintendo Switch is not there....
Convininece? I just gotta turn my PC on and click on the game I wanna play. Same thing on my xbox.

Now the nintendo switch, that's a different story.
I do this on my PC, but when I'm playing on the switch there is no such option unfortunately
Stupid? Would you say they are not with saving to trade later in the year?
Thanks!
If something were to happen to my switch would I lose everything I got from crates, keys, etc. in rocket league? or is it stored on psyonix servers? 

I don't want to have bought a key and something happens to my switch, cause me to lose everything I bought.
ah, so while you need to see more of her hitbox to land the hook, you only need to barely see it to complete the hook?
how did you get 21 kills? 2 environmental kills at the same time? even then I would think it would only count one of the kills
I'd rather save up in game currency from free loot boxes and buy a skin (or straight up get the skin from a loot box) than pay $20 each for the best skins

The battle pass system isn't bad though.
Did you know? 
Mercy's pistol does a surprising amount of damage!

Hi! Just wanted to remind you of that time 2 months ago when you got 10k points
I looked at this post and moved on, thinking i was on my home page. 2 minutes later I realize I'm in gaming so I come back to look.

Memories man!
Yeah, you could just keep breaking the second down into smaller and smaller parts until it's not the same time
Rip echo. That speaker will be ruined within a month if this bathroom is used to shower everyday 
That's gotta be like, an estimate or average though. Right? It's not like we know for sure that that many people are being born every second. 

How would they even begin to make an estimate? considering that countries do census' at different times and some countries don't report their population at all. On top of people that are having a baby in countries where not everyone born is accounted for. 
Woah, I though I remember hearing 1 birth every ~6 seconds and 1 death every ~9 seconds. 
That's insane
That was also something that I considered mentioning in my original comment
Maybe close to the exact same time, but I'm sure that if you broke  it down enough they would not be at the same time
Patch notes said nothing about the tula, but if it was the exact same bug that caused it I'm assuming it's fixed
Agreed
They did that with Doomfist
Don't know specifics, but it seems like making preview is one of the last things it does after it uploads (like how videos are not available on high quality for a while). Also, it seems that videos from before this feature was rolled out to everyone don't have a preview (usually)
Ahmn I thought I heard something about that
Ok! I see what you mean

Still gonna buy Deluxo first, but now I am considering the ruiner at some point 
Or you play the game?? Your not supposed to have everything in the DLC. Not saying I agree with all of the pricing on things, it should be somewhat cheaper.
Not saying your wrong, just wondering when it would be better to jump and parachute instead of flying
oh yeah... forgot.

I would still recommend getting one of those 2 things. 
I think I'll get the deluxo. I can use oppressor or CEO buzzard to go long distances, and deluxo for not so long distances
Yeah, I'm starting to think that the windows are just big TV screens and that we are really underground (yes, I know you actually get teleported to somewhere under the map when you enter a building, just playing along.)

So, last night I decided to try the Ethernet method because I wanted to do something that wouldn't require a restart of the game if I wanted to switch sessions. I experienced what you were talking about, where people would get put in the lobby. Whether it be 30 seconds after I did it or 1 hour. Thankfully you can do the Ethernet method over and over again.

Never experienced this with test NAT though.
You realize the deluxo is basically ruiner 8000? It can fly instead of jump, it can fly instead of parachute, it has 30 ruiner 2000 missiles instead of 8, and it is a personal vehicle. 

Also cheaper
So, due to people transferring modded accounts to PS4 and Xbox One they stopped allowing character transfer on March 6th 2017 after announcing this is January

I missed out on the transfer date by 7 days due to being on vacation (my friend and I game share and he got the game while I was on vacation)
I honestly find it hilarious to imagine someone making a building like maze bank west and just filling the interior with a 3 story garage
If only we could hire this guy for import export
Don't think so. I was in my friends a while ago and when I go to crews in the menu it still shows his as an option with a rank next to it. Might want to double check though
Thanks mate, but I'm not on PS4. Reply to the other guy if you want him to see this
You can swap between multiple crews I'm pretty sure
Okay.. didn't say you were wrong. Just never happened to me
Well... I guess I can only speak for myself. Been in solo public lobbies all the time for hours on end... A few times leaving my Xbox on overnight (bunker research) and still no one
Alright, PvP isn't something I do often anyway. 
I don't understand? There is no downside to this, it just makes the VTOL jets stronger
Facility has 7 pv slots
Ah. I can't help much there because the most I have done is a full small warehouse. I could join and help but I can't really give a reliable time that I will be on, other than Friday and Saturday night
Alright thanks! I can use oppressor or CEO buzzard to go long distances, and deluxo for not so long distances. 

Can't wait, big bttf fan
Pretty sure there is some sorta MTU glitch on PS4, don't know how it works though. Check the other stickied post for some links.
When you are in a public session go to settings > network setting > test NAT type. Wait 4-6 seconds and return to gta. Within 6 seconds you will see everyone leave the lobby, even though to them you are leaving the lobby. Enjoy solo public session!

You will always be in your own lobby until you relaunch the game, this game uses peer to peer connection meaning that there are no dedicated servers. If you are in a lobby by yourself the lobby is hosted locally and no one gets placed with you. If your friend joins than it creates a "room" and others can randomly join, but it usually does not happen for a while.

I should note:
1. Once you do this glitch, you will have to relaunch the game if you want to join a new session.
2. If you want to invite your friends it can be a little confusing. Sometimes they will receive errors if they try to join by you inviting them. In this case just tell them to go to your profile and click join game. Sometimes it happens the other way around and you need to invite them because it is giving them an error when they join game. I have no clue why this works this way. 
What platform?
VTOL was way weaker. The thrusters were not as strong
Should I reconsider buying the Deluxo over the hydra?

I made a post before and most people said that to get the deluxo because of the speed glitch and that the doomsday update broke the hydra in vtol.

Now that both of those glitches are patched, should I reconsider?
>Fixed an issue that allowed the Deluxo to fly at high speed when flying in reverse.

Yeah, I agree.

* Fixed issues that resulted in players getting stuck when entering/exiting the Avenger.
* Fixed issues that resulted in players getting stuck when entering/exiting the Bunker.
* Fixed issues that resulted in players getting stuck when entering/exiting the MOC.
* Fixed issues that resulted in players getting stuck when entering/exiting the Facility.
I did do a hostile takeover in a 28 player session a few nights ago, just for fun.

Not often though, usually do test NAT type before even leaving my house. I have plenty of fun with friends
:/
ohhhh. I never thought about it that way. (rarely go in public lobbies with anyone other than my friends)

I understand now, still wish I got to try it out but whatever
Why is everyone so happy it was patched? I still plan on getting a deluxo but this was one of the things I could not wait to try out.

Don't forget that the Facility has an extra 7 PV slots, MC has 10 motorcycle only slots, and office garages do not take up one of the 6 property slots.

Also, MOC has one PV slot if you use the garage bay. I wouldn't recommend it unless you have an avenger because you would have to switch back to vehicle workshop if you ever want to modify the Personal Special Vehicles.
When they say "I'm gonna kill you" **while** I am putting special carbine bullets in their face. Not my favorite voiceline in general, but it is hilarious when it happens at almost the same time as killing them. 
Both? Woah. It feels like an adventure getting what I want on *one* account, let alone 2
Okay... Xbone btw
Oh... Should I pull the other end of the plug?
Ethernet method never worked for me. Always disconnects no matter how fast I do it
Alright thanks. I'm more sure about my purchase now, considering that I love back to the future
Thanks. Should I get the deluxo first tho? I am very interested in it. I have done lots of research on it
Hydra or avenger? I can't find anyone else that asked this question, which is weird considering they are around the same price point
🎵A pirate is free🎵
I tried free aim (for doing import export before I knew how to get into a solo lobby) and I was *okay*. Still much better at aiming with kbm
I play in auto aim (usually a solo public lobby) because I suck at aiming with controllers and am way better with KBM, but all of my friend play GTA on Xbox sooo
Yes. All of the heist can be done with 2 people

Edit: just realized this was 2 months ago. 
not if you have zancudo hangar
So....

1. I complete the entire heist. All Acts.

2. I go back to heist room

3. I can just click on Act 2, Do the setups for act 2, and complete act 2

Is this true? Or do I have to do Act 1 setups and Act 1 first?
Just watch thiojoe. He has many in depth tutorials on Xbox One and PS4 hacks! ^^/s
Happens on Xbox One too, it is just the fact they still have to continue to optimize this game (it is still in early access). Does not happen with decent PC tho
Don't mind me. I just want to have a comment in this thread in case it gets locked
Alright. I'm not planning on getting a hangar until after 2 or 3 items that I have in mind (one of these slots being filled with deluxo or Hydra). Should in get facility while it's on sale (have just enough to buy it as of right now) and then deluxo, and wait to get Hydra until after hangar purchase?
I see that. I was asking about the amount of time.
Spoilers!
How long was the game?
Lol. Certainly not a switch hater (I have one and I really like it) but there is no way this game is coming to the switch. No matter how much optimization you do this game would be unplayable on the switch. Xbox one and PS4 can barely maintain a stable 25-30
No. Using the top range method I usually source 10-12 top range cars, put the money back in my main character, sell the cars (either with friends or solo) doing VIP missions in between sales (alternating between Hostile Takeover and Headhunter).
No. I checked Rockstar newswire. OP forgot to include this.

(he *did* post this hours before the newswire came out so its understandable)
Don't see why you would. I say this because your assistant texts you and says something like "The mechanic is going to waive the fee until we get our accounts in order"
Yeah, seems nice! I just don't think that I can justify spending $40 on something that will be free. 

Oh, but wait. I just realized that if they make it free you might not be able to earn free v-bucks.

I wonder....

yeah, but after you exhaust the challenges you have to rely on 50 v-buck dailies and every now and then you get some from the daily log on.  
Land at more populated places (not too populated). Don't go for the win just practice PvP. 
sadly, most of the people that fall for these stupid tricks are also people who don't use Twitter 
Lol. If you don't see someone for 10 minutes (unintentionally, as that *could* be a playstyle) than you are playing the game wrong.
I have heard that the skill ceiling is WAY higher in PUBG tho. 

I get confused just watching videos of PUBG with all the gun attachments and whatnot. In Fortnite you just pick up a gun and you have a gun.
I have not played PUBG. Sorry.
I heard that the vehicles used in the heist spawn across the river if you have the Zancudo Facility, is this true? 

Just evade all repair cost for I/E and it is even better

Put all your money in your second characters pocket (except for around $2000 so that you can pay mechanic and whatnot) and source as many vehicles as you want (on your main character, obviously), just make sure the repair cost is over the amount of money you have.

Say you have $1572 and you source a vehicle. As long as the repair cost is over $1572 you do not have to pay it.

So say I host it. I do everything and fully complete the heist. If, say, I just wanted to do Act III again would I have to do the setups and Act I + II, just Act I + II, or could I skip right to Act III immediately 
how much is daily charge?
To be fair, you have to practice fortnite. I'm not saying that Overwatch is not awesome for all the options that it offers, but fortnite is a different game. The whole *point* is to have high stakes deathmatch (at least late game) and you have to play quite a few rounds and many hours to get some good action going. I just about gave up when I started but after a week of not trying to win and just going for eliminations to practice PvP I have come to really enjoy Fortnite. Still think I like Overwatch more in general, but man Fortnite is fun (even more with friends)

By the way, I know you didn't say what platform you are on, but IMHO the pc version of Fortnite is much better because you can rely more on quick building if you find good keybinds for structures (I use the side buttons on my mouse). 
Ha. Butt saves
Anyone else prefer the first skin over rust lord? I might use moonwalker but I usually want the guy character (considering that I am a guy) probably will change skins for good when I get dark Voyager, using John wick every now and than if I get it
I got it yesterday! (Bought the battle pass on March 2nd) Didn't get to use it tho. Got it on my last game of the night.
Ah. I thought the rate of v bucks earned slowed down a lot after 2000 or so
Ah. I thought the rate of v bucks earned slowed down a lot after 2000 or so
No, they do. Season 1 battle pass code v bucks because they didn't want to upset people who stashed up on them. Season 2 battle pass cost real money. Season 3 was going to but they decided otherwise
Woah there buddy, the FIRST one you DON'T buy. Geez how much have you spent on v bucks lol
what about 20v20v20v20v20?
Sony is not allowing them to do it
/u/kyle6477 just sent a curse on op's inbox
Did you miss the /s?
Yeah, I don't see them making big changes for just an LTM. (Not saying that we should always have this mode, maybe once a month?)
They did! Check the patch notes! :)
Can someone from the west coast send me the VOD at 2:00 pm so I don't have to wait until 5 pm? Please! /s
A

What? When was this announced 
Not true. Try it yourself. Shoot a sonar arrow as hanzo and jump off a cliff. When you respawn it is back.
Ah, makes sense. Thanks! 
Thanks!
Jumping down onto the balcony from the roof is the best way. (Found ways to get on the roof without an air vehicle on this house and the cheapest stilt house)
You could save your earned v bucks for the next battle pass
Mercy's is on purpose, not added in for latency. Her beam stays connected longer than sombra can hack after los is broken
She had to have been working on this (or at least known about it) for a few weeks (maybe a month or 2). It was probably hard to not tell her friend that she was voicing hero 27
Yeah! Only issue is whoever did test NAT type has to relaunch the game if they play on switching sessions. (You can get into Jobs, but when you leave them it won't let you join a session
Just go into an empty public session lol. No one to bother you when selling 
Yes. However the shield bash has significantly less boop potential due to not having near as much knockback
My point was that Mario (spoiler) just kicked Bowser on the moon and flew away in the Odyssey. Bowser could have recuperated from this and set out to take over the Galaxy
If they reworked the beginning of Galaxy 1 it would kind make sense (with the ending of Odyssey)
Hmmmm..... *sniff sniff* I smell a meme coming 
lol. Impossible to control. Just get used to it. Idk if you have seen but there are many people that praise that bike (including me). You can do so many cool maneuvers and go quite fast.

I honestly have no clue where you go "impossible to control Oppressor" from. 
yeah! although odyssey was so much fun to play, I don't think anything will ever replace the experience I had playing Galaxy 1 and 2 as a younger kid 
Wait at least a month after she comes out though. They could change something (nerf or buff) 
Can't wait to see her dance! Crap, just realized that it will be 750 instead of 250 like the ones from last year
From Wreck it Ralph 2 trailer
Yes!
5k loss on some, put you have to drive fast to not have them rack up a ton of damage you can get screwed by BS ai.
It may not be in 4k, but will it still look better than the original?
You can, just fly pretty high so they don't pistol snipe the car. I don't own a cargobob but I considered getting one until I found this out (and how to evade paying the repair cost for imports)
Tip for the future, park your cars somewhere safe and just get out. Kill 4 waves of 4 guys each (2 in each car) and no more will spawn! No damage deliveries!
I never used a gameboy when I was younger (I was not born yet) but I seem to remember doing this with SOMETHING
I do all the time! But if I have a Hydra parked on my helipad wouldn't it just be way fast to use it. Worth?
I just tested it and I switched characters in ~1.5 min (I will do video later today as I can't right now, if you still want)
I agree. I was 100% full of shit. I remembered wrong. Would you believe me if I said 3min 30sec?
what? I bought a $20 shark card (once, only once) and it said something like "virtual currency bought" or something. Certainly not Received from Rockstar 
What about using hydra to go from my ceo to bunker? or just using it to get around in general (sourcing vehicle, going from vehicle warehouse to ceo, etc.). Lazer can't do that, right? I know Hydra might have less fun factor due to not having as fast acceleration and snappy handling but it makes up for that by having easy access to locations not near an airfield, right?
:(
Doesn't the oppressor have R2K missiles?
There is, however, a chance that I am wrong. My memory could be failing me
You want a video mate
I was literally getting "ads" (the things that show when you start the game) for smugglers run! Not only advertising the update itself, but separate ads showed off the vigilante and the bombushka!
Oh, they stopped producing them? I thought that was just the kinect itself. Makes sense now that I think about it.
You can get a kinect to usb adapter for the Xbox One S/X (that is what I use)
If you are talking about exporting, than all you have to do is park your car, get out, fight off 4 waves of NPCs and no more spawn. Peaceful exporting!
First - It takes ~~60 seconds~~ 3.5 minutes total to swap to the other character, put money in cash (or put money in bank), and swap back.

Second - I usually end up with $7,000 or more for the ones with the crazy ai that you have to steal the car from. Do keep in mind that I suck at aiming with a controller so killing the ai without spraying bullets all over the car does not happen often. (I play GTA on Xbox cause that is were my friends are, I play most shooters on my pc though).

Third- The importing missions are 100% more relaxing because I can just enjoy the drive on the way to the warehouse and not care when some stupid ai trying to bring my profits down.
Import however many vehicles you desire, switch to other character, put money back in bank, switch back. Done
This, my friends, is why I put all of my money into cash on a second character (that's his only use lol) and therefore do not have to pay repair cost
Hey, if you can play the games you want to play at settings that you are okay with it is all you need! (Even though 4k 60Fps is always nice)
The shark cards have literally become a worse deal over time. Not only because they don't have as much buying power, but you can earn millions way faster than you could before
DIS-A-POINTED!
I tested it (did not plan on actually putting the balloon there) and the game just acts like you entered a room and sends you back Luigi when you try to do the glitch in New Donk City
? I always had to fire my other pump when I was double pumping?
What happened? I read that it was dead but what did they change
!RemindMe 4 years
Replays are broadcasting just like a live stream. It is like watching a rerun on TV vs watching the show recorded on your DVR
While I never traded any of my games away, my Mom put all of my games in a CD case and threw the boxes away (this was around 2007). She did this because we were moving from a pretty big house to a small apartment (we no longer needed all that room) and at the time I didn't realize how much I would miss the game cases. I am happy I still have the games but man do I miss the box art.
YEAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
Oh my gosh! Thank you for reminding me!
Why would you assume butts are candy floss??
Oh! Well that's cool! thanks
My step dad watched a bit of the Smackdown game on TV yesterday (I don't know anything about it, just that it was on when I went into the kitchen) and when they came back from a commercial break the announcers were going through 2 or 3 advertisements when Rocket League logo appears on screen and they say something like "Rocket League, Play for fun Live to play" I was so surprised  
Oh cool! Is it in any specific order?
You have to pay 1k but it's free??
A little off topic, but I can't find the answer anywhere.

If a personal aircraft is destroyed, do you have to pay insurance? or does it get replaced for free, like when you call a new buzzard with CEO. 
The source vehicles are aircrafts, right?
don't you hate it when people tell you to "Just knock out that project, it's your choice if you focus or not" even though I am officially diagnosed with ADHD (high school student)
This was good!
Apparently the hangar missions are really fun, that's what the reviews said...
There is still one at my local park from when I was younger! I used to go down it on some type on foil and I would go so fast... I don't know what all of this burning children is coming from. I used to go down it normally too....
The first 2 weeks (or so) of the season was completely different than it is now, due to the mercy nerfs. 
Okay!
OMG my dream cereal!!! Ahhhhhhhh
When mentioning what the S is better at you did not mention the second screen. I know most people have said that they wish the 3 had this yet you did not mention it. Are you comfortable with having to look over?
Seems cool! Should I get the jetpack over deluxo? Is it more fun? I already have oppressor and buzzard (with CEO) btw
?? Cricket is awesome! 
"What's a computer?" From that Apple Commercial
I knew I belong in Gold! I was in low gold last season but this season I got placed just below Gold and after playing a few games (and losing) my SR is now almost 200 away from Gold! I have nothing to lose if I keep trying, right? As long as I stop before getting into bronze (if my SR gets that low)
I bet North Korea would not participate... 
weird....
In GTA V shotguns are effective pretty far away
Yeah! like how Orisa, Sombra, and Ana have always been in the game for me. and how I really wish there was a way for me to just try roadhog 1.0! I know his hook was stupid crazy and his damage was really high (exactly why they nerfed him) but I just want to try it.
Yeah! I was oddly proud of myself when I told that to a friend who played overwatch before me and he did not know.

(I found it out through research)
I was kinda thinking about that...how the deluxo is more useful for getting around the city
I used to play this game all the time. Yet I had no clue that you could jump in it???
okay. Plus it comes with the weapons and I don't have MOC weapons and vehicle shop (even though I easily could afford it right now)
That's the issue lol. I don't know what I will have more fun with. 

I already have the oppressor if that helps
7:00 is coming back because of snooze
I don't have the deluxo yet, I know many people say to get that first but that is when it is not on sale. Should I get it before the deluxo with sale price?
Really? I already have the game but my friend has been waiting to get it on sale
Sure, maybe when I was ~4 years old and my Grandpa gave me one I was surprised, but not now
up heed
Pretty sure!
That would be nice!
Cortana can mirror notifications from your phone! (The only thing she is good for on windows 10 imo)
Buy a $20 game or $25 amiibo? Life's hardest questions
Oh come on I was thinking of posting this before! Enjoy front page
Phew! I was a bit confused there
Phew! I was a bit confused there

oh..... well I'm still happy that it is fixed
One of the only times that I will have to worry about someone taking lucio! (not that I don't play other heros, he is just my main)
YES! I swear there have been a few times where my I was soooo close to the payload that if this was not a bug I would have made it
If you don't have any money (it's all on your second character) you can import vehicles care free because you can't be charged for repairs
1. Make a second character (if you don't already have one)
2. Put all your money in the bank
3. Switch to second character
4. drive to ATM (if you don't know where the closest one is, it is an 
    option in the Quick GPS in the interaction menu)
5. Put all of the money from your bank into cash
6. Switch back to main character
7. Use a method to get into an empty public lobby (what platform r 
    u on?)
8. Source a ton of vehicles in a row, even the low and mid range 
    cars.
9. Wait until you have X number of high end cars (there are only 
    10 or 11 high end cars in Import/Export)
10. Switch to second character and put money back in the bank 
     (this can be done from your phone)
11. Switch back to main character and get into an empty public 
      lobby (like earlier)
12. Only sell top range cars with the $100,000 payout
13. Do various VIP missions while waiting on the Export cool down

The reason you have to go the the ATM to put all your money into cash is because when using the phone you can only to this in predefined chunks (i.e. $100 $10,000 $100,000) but at the ATM you have a choice to transfer all of your money to cash at once.

Which vehicle warehouse do you have?


This was my first thought when I saw the car in space. I was sad that no one else made it to the front page with Phineas and Ferb with the car in space and the Tesla in space with a title like "I see no difference" or something
Don't forget that they were over 135 feet tall!
Thx! Idk why you got down voted once or twice
Well.... At least you got ~11 months of fun out of it!
When did u get it?
it does not come with the mod shop????
Awesome!
hold on... wait? shoot through buildings? like a bug?
Hey man, the Ruiner 2000 is not all bad. It has some things over the deluxo.... like uh.... it can jump and has a parachute! crap no, the deluxo can fly. OH I KNOW! it has amazing homing missiles! the deluxo also has those, crap. 

The Ruiner 2000 seems like a predecessor to the Deluxo.... even though the Deluxo is cheaper. 
I can't wait until I am at this point. I know that I should be careful what I wish for because once I have all of the outstanding items the game could start to get boring, but I don't think that will happen until I actually have everything that is decent.
so? does it work?
does the jetsam also have the invisible wall for vehicles?
just buy a cheap garage near your facility, spawn there
Portal 1 and 2 (I'm counting this as one), Zelda BOTW, Galaxy 1 and 2. Technically 5 games but whatever
I recommend researching methods to get in empty public lobbies. (I do not play GTA on PC so I do not know any by memory for PC)
I don't understand what either of these posts (the double one and this one) are showing? I read then comments on both to no avail
I just spawn my buzzard right in front of me.


Alternatively (If u are not a CEO with a buzzard) you can pay $1000 for Merryweather to pick you up
My math teacher last year was REALLY good with hers. I wish every teacher used the smart board like that... Now I know why they were pushing them in the first place
Guys this is fake... I have seen videos of people inspecting it and it's editied
Cities Skylines. I got it for cheap during a sale and had quite a bit of fun with it, but I just can't build a city from scratch. I have built one from a bit more money than the default starting money is though....
Wow. The software between them is almost identical. Feels bad man (or girl)
Oh okay. Do you know if the full size version get the update?
Did it sell well in NA? I have only found a few videos of it on YouTube and never seen one in person (besides at the store and my own)
You don't want to... It'll literally make your iPod run slower than a dead grandma
Man I feel bad. I'm running nougat right now on my Axon 7 mini. It was cool to find someone else with this phone as it seems everyone has just that Axon 7. I sincerely hope you get the update because after I updated the battery lasted longer (wayyyy longer on standby) and new features were really useful (split screen, quick multitasking...)
can't you just drive into the workshop (either in MOC or Avenger) and it will reset your missile usage?
Hahaha! Sorry... I forgot I was in the Xbox subreddit and was confused because I was asking about Minecraft PC
How do u check your hours on Minecraft?
Thanks, I was wanting to change it up
I have 8gb ddr3 in my PC, same as Xbox. But when I play on PC (which I do) the menus load instantly compared to sluggish "pause" menu on Xbox. It has nothing to do with ram
I always type "sorry" in chat when I mess up
I just linked my blizz to twitch!
I **think** this is skyrim, but I have never played it. Can someone explain to me what is happening here?

While watching this I had the instinct to walk away because I was not wearing a mask/filter
I don't know if you are aware of this yet, but that is something that they just put in the Alpha Ring (Xbox Insiders). 
I tried to avoid the daily reveals like landmines, sadly I got most of them spoiled because youtubers set the thumbnail as the new items! I only got glimpses of the new items because I moved my eyes away ASAP but it was so annoying. Plz never again bliz 
Woah, when you said 3 years ago I was thinking 2013, but 2015..... man time is crazy
I really liked this
I just hope my Mom never watches Overwatch League. I was so confused the first time that they **paused** the game.

Yes I know they are using a private server for it so they have full control but I was having a serious mind=blown moment
In order to get the "hidden" lines you need to bind a hotkey. For example, the hotkey you bind for "Understood" will also be used for "Defend the payload" if you point at the payload icon while pressing the hotkey. 

I know that controllers do not have many "free" buttons to use for stuff like this, I wanted to bind hotkeys when I played on Xbox but struggled to find a good place for them.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nO0-pFEOMw&ab_channel=Radekken
This video explains all of the "hidden" lines and how to use them. Ignore the "PC" part of the title as it seems these are on console now.
It's gonna be hard to save the credits I have for the event when this is coming
I literally just walk around with the pants and I'm fine, it doesn't make sense
WTF, man. I just wanna upgrade my darn computer. $100 for 8gb DDR4 WTF!
I really need an upgrade from my 5 year old build that has only 2 cores at 3 Ghz, but man it can wait at this point.
Not mine, but I heard this one guy sent a false alarm that a missile was coming, to an entire state

I really recommend this stretch of road, Highway 212 is amazing through here. It is closed right now, due to Winter, but in the Summer it is AMAZING, event drove by some snow in the mountains (none on the road). Also there is this cool place called "Stop the Car" in one of the villages. 
On a somewhat related note, I never realized how cool Doomfist's punches look in 3rd person

Same with Ana
Similar thing happened to me, except I think it was much worse https://youtu.be/7wyXOlqT3vw
It has happened with every mini direct, a main one happened less than 20 days after
I just bought the Andes skin for him and I love it, sadly going to have to buy one for someone else
Can someone explain this to me
I love skating and live in Florida. (Indoor ice skating rink)
Ha
This goes to show that knowing the mechanics of the game are key. Not just the fact that you play with a keyboard and mouse
Depending on the size of this house I would probably sleep in here. I do not like going to be at 2:00 am on some nights with the thoughts that someone could sneak in my house and kill me. I would feel safer in here.
Idk about you guys but I gave myself full system privileges a long time ago 
I have entered!

Oh, yeah. Probably should have considered that
Dude NSFW plz
I love bloodmoons because it means more guardian farming!
The ones made "for you" are made by robots
Not trying to downplay this awesome POTG but it appears he is on console, so the aim assist help at least a little bit with the 360 headshot. 

Still a great play though. 
The one that is really big but does not have any branches or leaves? I got that guy already, but thanks
I know this topic is serious, but your icon makes it hard to take your comment seriously lol
So, how do they test this? is it on the pc but only on the ptr? or do they just test it internally 
how is there not more upvotes
why until 2023? why not more
but you said his other kid had a ps4 wtf is up with him

I ain't ever been mad at ya'
when i first started playing i thought it did this (for some reason). My team must have been so annoyed
oh, it doesn't... ouch.
The post could also be titled "The end of an era"
Same, I really want them to open some stores over here
We need In N Out in Florida
it looks painted sadly
just trying to get banned because I have never been banned from a subreddit before
Don't forget the castle
2012, yeah that's right. Probably my favorite movie of all time.


Oh, you thought I was being serious? Ha!
maybe have uprising skins available, with uprising only in custom games (with a new game mode for the arcade during the event)
I hope we get uprising again because I was not able to play last time.

Also the Uprising art says "Uprising 2017" so I think we will get it again
what? i have the extension installed and everything that is cloud says butt, but your comment says cloud!
They did, it is called Spiderman: Homecoming 
This probably is not the solution you are looking for but the kinect dims the controller light and the power button light depending on the brightness of the room.

Considering kinect has been discontinued I find it weird they have yet to implement this into the software.
I know! I wanted this.

But two things went wrong:
1. They should have been more clear about it, plenty of people though you had to be online for no reason
2. They should have implemented a setting that enables this feature, so if someone does not want it they do not have to
you stole my idea, even though I just saw this post
You can hack your 3DS and copy the save to an sd card

Not the ideal solution, just a thought
that's why you steal supplies
25 for 10 mil i would have probably bought a few by now
town and state?
yes!
yeah, i hate closing my laptop (where it disconnects from the internet) and coming back to steam thinking that all my friends were just online. NO THEY WERE NOT, Steam! 
what? Have you played with with anyone that has at least a 1-2 hours of playtime. Her ult is good but she stops getting POTG all the time.
if only Play Of The Game clips were longer you probably would have gotten it (if you did not already)
same!
ah, thanks
but you can't just walk on the snow! or can you if its packed dense enough? I live in Florida so I wouldn't know.
my dumbself has been regestering them as soon as i get the games
they also reduced credits earned, so they just scaled everything down
when you get to the top it saves, so you could have just reverted your save file
oh, no! there is a no scooter version..... I *tried* doing that for fun on the scooter one and oh boy, it was not fun.
Money is the same thing as a gift card.
Oh wait, one more thing, money can be spent ANYWHERE

You know darn well that I will still try a boot it up when I get home
> Thing is, the levels DO change *while you’re in them getting moons* in Odyssey. That’s brilliant. You don’t consistently get thrown back out to a hub. You can continue to roam around and accomplish as much as you want however you want. 

Yes, they do change. I agree with everything you said in this post, this just brought up something I was thinking about. You can't go back to a different stage in the level. Once you beat the boss in New Donk City, you can't go back. You have to replay the  game up to that point if you want to do that fight again (same with every boss in the game, as far as I know) [Yes, I have found the painting where you refight the bosses, but they are harder (wish I choose to do the original or the harder version) and you only get to do the fight. (An example would be that you are already in the courtyard when you jump into the New Donk City boss fight painting, no making your way through the city, no climbing the city hall, just right to the fight. I want to reexperience everything, and I have to replay the game if I ever want to experience boss fights again.] (/spoiler)

I know this was a little rant, but I'm not trying to say the game is bad! I believe it is one of the best Mario games (if not the best, I can't decide). This is really my only problem with the game, and it's not even that problematic. It's just that you can easily replay the bosses in the other games, with the full experience.
That's also the amount of ram the Wii had. (iirc, if not then it's close)
You can transfer your Wii game saves to the Wii u.(they can only be accessed through Wii mode)
Thanks for the warning. I got a Wii u in January (played the crap out of it and got my monies worth for sure, but I did get a switch in May) and I have been forgetting to transfer my Wii saves over. Better do it before I can no longer download the Wii to Wii u transfer app.
YES
I wasn't saying he should like it, just that it's not an fps
Wow, I totally forgot about the 1.9 and up combat system. I have command blocks in all of my worlds that disable it.
I understand that you may not want the game, but it's not an FPS lol. 
This is what gets me
wait, what happened? How were you pushing the tower with your special?
man, this really made me want a Comet Observatory Kingdom
I totally see where you are coming from though. Most of the level is just dirt
wow. I found the lost kingdom to look good (at least in the forest area where you land the odyssey.) I took a screenshot of mario and the sun rays shining through the openings.
which one are you referring to?
My biggest "Wow" moment was during the New Donk City boss battle. It was raining really hard with detail, it was dark with lighting and shadows, and there was so much action going on. Yet the game kept chugging along with no frame rate drops (at least no noticeable ones, maybe the fps flickered a few frames here and there)
Dpad up twice and then right once. Now it's dpad down twice and a button. I guess it's basically the same but it felt faster in practice
Actually it's faster to get to the party now. Start a party and you'll see it pop up on the main screen for the guide
At first I didn't like it either (I've had it for a month and a half from insider program) but I got used to it and now I like it. The quick access to recent people, every pin from the guide, the speed, everything I like and when I tried the public OS build (at the time) it felt really sluggish.
Both Galaxy games? Anyone? I mean you had to point at the screen sometimes and one of your main abilities was shaking the remote.
Wow. I activated the motorbike challenge on the town hall so i could run to the end of it and long jump
Is the 2nd one from the left the Odyssey bundle? Because I really want that case but I can only find it in the bundle
oh so the pro controller doesn't exist? uh.... okay then. And for a lot of things the joy-con is fine
I saw u on another post yesterday! I hope you find your answer :)
yes! i also use it all the time because the house i am staying in for the next few months does not have a tv remote for the one in my bedroom. I probably could find a compatible remote, but no need! I just use my kinect
RIGHT?!?
U have to be online for first time launch
/r/handstandfaceplant
nsfw? Im at work
THIS IS AMAZING. I told my whole class and no one cared :(
As much as I love gaming on my pc, I really enjoy my switch as well. Thank you to the all the GOOD devs on pc and THANK YOU to nintendo for making games like BOTW and Odyssey in the 2017 gaming market!
Hi, im here ready for the randomness
What holiday were you on?
They would have both probably. And even if they only had discord, it would be built in, so people would use it like xbl chat
same, I know nothing about the game other than the trailer in January and the E3 trailer, can't wait to be mega surprised with everything
you should post this on the OW forums if you want to get to the game dev team, they are not guaranteed to respond but they surely wont respond here
Wait, what?
Wait, it does?
That's what I get for living on a barrier island I guess
Im actually stationed on pluto
While in prison were you aware that there were things like smart phones and mass social media popularity?
On mobile, didn't realize that it was a gif, upvoted cause it was really cool, comes back to front page 5 hours later, gif loads, WTF
Wait, what? According to them this whole thing is a bug! WTF 
wait what? wow....
I knew it was a browser and not an app but just, wow
Yeah. I have the steam version (got it during summer sale) and it is really fast (I have an HDD so the switch should be faster cause it's got flash memory) I hope it's a bug. It'll still be fun though, just a little annoying.

I didn't get to play much on PC, only like 8 hours and into early fall. (I don't have much time to sit in front of the computer) so the switch will help me enjoy the game a lot more, only problem I have encountered is the saving time.
Hold on... Why does it take 10+ seconds to save when I sleep?
I mean, it's like .7 gb so it shouldn't take long. Downloading on crap school wifi right now it says 5 min
WAIT WHAT NOOOOO THIS CANT BE HAPPENING. At least my thumb will get a rest from constantly hitting space bar. Not worth it tho
Well. That stinks. I liked the Steve and Alex on a hill better
When I was younger I went to a middle school that started at 9:15. Yup u heard me. And it was a public school, so every middle  school in the county started at 9:15. Bad part is school ended at 3:40 so... Yeah
The cows just get up with not a care in the world
Same
Yes. I feel this way a lot. Worst part is I don't even have a group of friends. My only friend lives ~1 hour drive so I don't see him super often.
I already knew the "better together" version was a separate game. But it also has a different name (Minecraft: Xbox one edition vs "Minecraft") but im staying the same "Minecraft" (the better together one) has different logos depending on where it is.
Okay, thanks. I do plan on reporting it if it is an issue (even though it's likely that someone else already has)
It does not go with any other game tile (at least out of the ones that I have). It looks like a the PE icon (yes, I am aware that this is based on the Pocket Edition).

My problem is that it is different depending on where it is (in pins, in guide, on "custom" page) and it does not match what it is on the public release of the OS.
I fully drained the battery and am going to fully charge it. At this point the only thing that could be wrong with it is the battery. (Besides something like waterprofing, which I did not plan on testing even if it was a brand new watch.)
I just got a used gear s2 classic (non-LTE) in perfect condition from a pawn shop for $60. I have been looking into getting one but never found one for this good of price, do you think I got a good deal?

Edit: It also came with a $35 wristband that I prefer over the standard one, so bonus!
Okay thanks
Has the Splatoon 2 pro controller production been stopped? I can't find them for MSRP anywhere
oh, okay. Thanks
I'll check the details when I get home this afternoon. (All I can remember right now is that it is a Gigabyte motherboard)
Why is it instantly not compatible with mine? Is there something proprietary?
Do you know if the stock cooler is better than the stock one that came with my pentium?
Yeah, I would probably just play it safe at 3.4 ghz (AMD's website says that's the maximum turbo core speed)

Thanks for the recommendation!
$109!!!! 
And 4 cores!
Wait.... 3.9ghz with auto voltage?!? AND STOCK COOLING
which ryzen 3 would you recommend?
Cool. I will check this out
Do the pixels move to prevent burn in?
Thanks! This will be really nice, especially for my digital games
Pyramid america?
Iirc you can make another character and do the challenge again and then transfer the money to your main one
Where do u get the posters?
Should work. If you have a powerful enough PC, decent internet, 2 blizz accounts with overwatch, and play with controllers because you can only have one m/k
Mostly Splatoon 2. But if you have a switch you have likely already played it. So try overwatch if you don't own it because it's the free weekend
saved
Thought with was on /r/nintendoswitch (on mobile, subreddit name is small) got confused when you said "proprietary"
My question is, do you get to see the Original Xbox boot sequence?
I tweeted Avalanche Studios and the Just Cause account, so we shall see if they respond
I know this is a different scenario than most, but I was never good at using the defense matrix so I love this change because the only downside of the change is the thing I never used much anyway. Her mech no longer melts and I can fire while boosting. So much fun.
You... Uh.... You won right?
What makes Nintendo consoles seemingly easier to hack
What did?
2 days? what r u playing 24/7?
I got my supplies from a Winn-Dixie in the poorer area of Palmetto yesterday. They had a lot, probably because the people in the area have less money to spend on big stacks of food, sadly.
What? But I brought so much salt home from the store!
Yea man, I don't know what I was thinking when I posted this
I didn't notice that, here take my upvote
Thanks for the info!
Thanks!
Oh thanks!

Edit: Holy crap I just got a ton of money
Well, team flight won! Yes
But how did u get up there?
sure, I have a glass screen protector. Guess what happened? (after being super careful) The back of the switch got a very noticeable scratch. My switch had other problems so I sent it into nintendo and they fixed everything. Got the switch back (No Scratches!) I put a new screen protector on (I took the other one off before sending it in) and it gets scratched again instantly (I checked after first dock/undock) Thankfully this one is only noticeable under directed light but it is still annoying
What this isn't you? Source pleaae
That's more expensive than the Hydra! And isn't the Hydra the same thing just with vertical take off and landing?
Well technically they swim in it and walk on it all the time sooooo I would be fine, especially since they were just walking around and swimming in it a few seconds ago. That's like being splashed by water after getting out of the pool (before drying off)

How do u post the video like that?!?!!
Splatoon 2 entry please because I recently had to pay off my ex so I could keep the house and I need to work some more before I even think about buying more games
I had never played a Zelda game before (even tho I have been a fan of Nintendo for a while) and I loved botw
HEY GUYS LOOK THE BIG GREEN IS NOW RED
Funny thing I somehow accidentally did this last week
The only other thing is small stuff that is taking 1-2% of the CPU and HDD
nope it was the C: drive. when i hit delete on the other partition the C: drive turned into free space and the whole computer froze
It was still going when I accidentally cancelled it. But I checked and it got everything I wanted (I was copying my whole "users" folder)
It never said
Nope
just to clarify this IS a looping gif and not the system repeating itself
Oh okay :( thanks
Oh yeah forgot about those. and lol to the last part
Alright, I don't have any FPS games on pc atm but I'll just play the game on xbox until there is a sale
Thanks! Waiting for a sale sounds like a good idea!
Waiting for a sale sounds like a good idea, especially since I have a good library on steam to keep me occupied. However I am still going to play on my xbox a lot as that is what all my friends (except for 1) have, but none of them play overwatch.
Hi
Proof?
Atleast your inbox isnt dead
You can buy an empty case from nintendo and then print out the game cover. That's what i do.
You can buy empty cases and print out the game cover
You can still make and use avatars
But it does not happen in any other game and just started happening yesterday
How do u explain the game pausing?
Well im not, i did the best i could

How would they be defective, I opened zelda and pressing L + R does nothing but have me throw my weapon and use my shieka slate runes.
I dont have a capture card but i can try to film it with my phone later
As far as I know, no. I relaunched the game and it is still happening
I know for a fact that this happens. To test, I held my hand in a position so that they were not touching anything except the L and R buttons. During a grand prix I pressed them both at the same time and not thrown into the pause menu, and if I continued to hold them I would get thrown into the home menu.

Nicr explanation thanks!
Okay! Confusing to me as an american but i think i get it.
Oh okay! I didn't think about it that way.
Thank you!
Thanks!
I dont have a capture card
Ah...
An international account? What?
Yes Yes!
How does this work? I thought they all happened at the same time?
YES!
Lol, well i reget mine that i made when i was younger. Thought it sounded cool.
I bet you regret your psn name...
UR NOT EVEN OP
Thats not how it works, all of them happen at the same time just a different "time" of the day for those in different time zones. Like how 3pm in new york is happening at the same time a noon in los angeles
I know that cover project has some game case covers for switch but they do not have arms. I buy my games digitally but like to but the box art in an empty case to put on my shelf. Every time I look this up it only comes up with digital only game cases (which I also use) or the front of the box art. Please. Does anyone know of another full box art source with arms.
I googled this and cant find anything...
https://news.xbox.com/2017/06/28/xbox-ultimate-game-sale-2017/
Thanks! Will do!
Wow thanks!
Wow. What is humble bundle? Sorry, i probably sound stupid
Huh? I just got into pc gaming. Like last week! Best time to start I guess!
He probably thought he were streaming (he might be)
Getting ice cream
I would like to enter
Thanks! I will definitely use this
Yup, wii u mini is definatly now gonna happen
Wahapawhapawapa
Plz!
 Not exactly... sense the wii had ~115 miilion sales (iirc) and the wii u was not off to a great start it stayed supported for a decent amount of time
More like ninjara (or whoever is ur main)
Really? Ill have to check this out!
I *do* have amazon prime but $12 isnt a **big** problem. If only I could get that japan deal where nintendo is selling the empty game case with a download code... come to think of it, what i might get an empty game case off of ebay if i can for $5!
i hope. I don't think netflix and youtube are e3 announcement worthy tho 
Should I get splatoon 2 digital or physical? I like looking at box art but LOVE the convenience of digital. I got mk8d physical because of the cool art on the front of it. I got zelda physical for the same reason. Now I just need to decide if splatoon 2 has cool enough box art to justify it...
ITS PORTABLE NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Remindme! 6 months
/r/shittylegaladvice
Pewdiepie. not worth a watch (/s) but small youtuber that could use some support.
I was asking if someone else possibly had the same problem (and "un-bent" it like I did) and how it turned out for them. As long as my switch can be okay until the school year starts (8 weeks) than I will wait to send it back until then...
Thought this was /r/overwatch when I read the title
Ohhh! I see.
Um. Splatoon 2 has been confirmed....
Look at how the crew does it
if you dont already know, you can!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! its awesome
Yeah. I do too (expect for small games like snipperclips, even if it had a physical option) Best of luck
Download it after you set your switch to north america region? (Or ur home region)
Happypuppies.net
Yeah! But its not of much use now, as I only have 4 hearts!
What about 12- 17?
Thx
Thats why i showed the ingredients used. I only used on in each. But it was already explained.
wow. Thanks for the in depth explanation!
r u liking it?

WTF R U DOING ON REDDIT YOU JUST GOT A SWITCH
Other than the bin next to the gas pump
One word can solve all of your problems. Research. 
Not region locked... just locked based on the setting. So yes it is "locked" but unlike past systems this can be changed very easily.
Wait what? Its gotta be able to bend past 95 degress or so right? In the video they never fully bended it
True. Sometimes even more money is spent on shark cards if you buy them then just paying fot the expansion
Worth something?
Im fine with buying it, but why is playground charging for expansions when r* has free dlc all the time?
Except this is real
~~Yup~~
Yeah! They are amazing at keeping the servers up! 
Well. We would talk about nothing cause i only use bing. 

/s
Okay! But it seems more complicated than just using soundhax with a card update to 9.6
Oh! Where?
No i double checked. Its on 5.1.0
:(
Alright. So i can card update it to 9.6 does that mean anyhthing? Im using smash bros
I am going to install cfw on a friends 3ds and it is on 5.7. Is it possible to install cfw on it? When I look up a guide there is only a guide for 11.3 and 11.2. Are those guides vailid for older firmware? I dont want to brick his 3ds. I got cfw on mine a week ago but it was on 11.3. Thanks in advance!
Wow! Thankfully there was not much stuff to debate in court. Otherwise you probably would have lost.
This thread is the reason i use reddit
Why did i get notified of this? I mean its cute but why?
In a dark room it is a normal screen. Why? I mean what else would it be?
Nope.... i have old 3ds.... no auto bright
Thanks! This is what i was looking for!
No
Yeah but why is it really easier to see when in the sun?
What?!?!?!
No.... im on old 3ds.... no auto brightness
Thanks!
So yesterday I spent most of the afternoon installing CFW on my 11.3 3ds and it is amazing! One question I had though was if I am past any chance of bricking it. Like it freezing or an sd card error or something else. Now that CFW is fully installed is there anything that could happen?
Whats a doodle bomb
> good things tend to happen to good people

good things dont *always* happen to good people

A form of digital storage in which is 1024kb and where 1024 of them = 1gb
Oh... everywhere else I liked it was 40
Thx
Lol, well that IS the closest any one can come to beating u without beating u
Ohhhhh. Yeah play makes much more sense now.
Now for an actual reply:
And that is expected, but the 3ds can sometimes make u forget that it's like a 360p screen or something
It is no wii u?
Uh... well I don't know how good it can be cause it's on the 3ds. This game looks very amazing in HD but I don't know how it compares for the 3ds version.
Okay! Thanks. I like the portability aspect a lot but ill have to think about it.
Oh okay, portability is a big thing but right now I don't think its worth 40 bucks.
Yeah the game looks amazing
Uh.... weird
 Wow!  Thanks.. that'd be helpful
Yeah, I got an appointment scheduled for - when I get a switch - .
oh.... um okay. Thanks. If you remember the name then please say. I am on 11.3.0 so I can't CFW but if it works without CFW then I will check it out.
Ohhh thanks! Idk how I missed that

Ohhh! Cool!!
I'm confused, what did you engrave on it?
Oh my gosh..... I could never imagine that happening..... sorry for your loss 
Not related to the comment, but this comment has more upvotes than the post itself
This
Alright! Thanks!
Ya.... I already have mario maker on their and knew that you couldn't share online on 3ds, but can you transfer the level to the wii u or vice versa  (If you want to edit on the go) ? I couldn't find anything online about it because everything was just talking about not being able to share them from the 3ds.
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Thanks for the information! 
Alright gang, we know we are gonna bomb this place, the question is when?
OH, I SEE... WELL IF SHE IS ALWAYS YELLING THEN THAT IS A SIGN THAT SHE IS PROBABLY A ROBOT.
HELLO FELLOW HUMAN, WITH A HEART AND LUNGS, I BELIEVE YOU ARE YELLING TO LOUND FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND..... PLEASE CONSIDER REPEATING WHAT YOU SAID 
Lol, hide them in your pocket? Only with joy cons!
Sorry, I wasn't trying to be mean..... Just joking around a bit
WHAT KIND OF PERSON THINKS OF THESE THINGS
I beg to differ on that one......
What I want to know: Why didn't op hide the UI?
god i love reddit
Wow, in U.S. the 2ds is $80 with mario kart 7 (pre-installed), the n3dsxl is $200 (with no game or charger), and the cheapest n3ds bundle (obviously the only way to get it with NA region) is a little over $200 depending where you buy it from.

(all prices are for brand new consoles)
Okay! I have heard that the screen size of the new 3ds is perfect because it is not to small but not to big for the pixel density and is perfect size for portability. Would you agree?
Awesome! Thanks a ton for your help! I couldn't find any other forum or comparison that answered my questions as well as your did! Have a nice afternoon! (Depending on your time zone)

Bonus question: what is your region? Because in North America the n3ds (non xl) is only available in a  bundle or special edition, so most of the time I found that they usually cost more than n3dsxl
Okay, so is paying $60 for an OG 3ds good? Or ~$80 for a new 2ds with mario kart 7?

The foldable design is not a must have for me as I will usually have a backpack on me when I take the system outside of the house, but it would be nice for when I just want to shove it in my pocket and go somewhere.
No, which 3ds did you get? Thanks however!
Which one?
Oh! Alright! Thanks 
Wow, weird!
Okay! Thanks for for recommendation! I will probably end up getting the new 3ds if I can find it for ~$100. If not then I will have to decide between OG 3ds xl, OG 3ds, and 2ds
I'm fine with the size but what exactly do you mean by "the most of the 3ds" ?
Okay, but if I can't then what would you next recommendation be?
What? A new gba is coming out!?!
But isn't 3d land and 3d world different games with some different features?
Well... Mario kart won't even be out then, so it's not terrible 
Oh okay! Thanks!
Repost! But upvote cause it had been awhile and that is how many people see the joke for the first time
I'm not a robot, don't quote me on that
Lol, I did it on 2nd try
Panau is the location of the second game
I'm guessing you have been a preview member since when it was just the "preview program"
oh, okay..... I guess I'll just have to hope they keep giving me stuff to do so then I can work my way up to beta, or at least ring 3
ohhhhhh, okay. But how do you "boop"
But this doesn't come out till summer
Wait, what? I'm confused.... I play sombra a lot and have no clue what they just did
RemindMe! 24 hours
Wow! Yeah
Do you live in a deserted place? I mean with like 86 million units sold that is weird
Oh...
Oh
I have heard that the power boost really only has a noticeable difference when it comes to loading times... is this true? If so then I'm perfectly fine waiting 60 seconds for a game to launch rather than 20-30 sec, if it means I save $60-80
Yeah, but he probably wouldn't have done it if it wasn't for her boyfriend blocking him
and also, you xbox 360 never worked again, or just in the car?
see, the car manual says that it wont power game consoles like the xbox 360 and the ps3...... but the thing is, im 99.9% sure the wii u uses less voltage than those 7th gen consoles, thats where the questions lies.....
Oh! Okay, thanks... With electrical out of the way, I now am questioning if all the movements and bumps that happen in a car will end up damaging the Wii u fans, I already know that it doesn't use a spinning hard drive, so that's fine, it's just the fans and any other part of the system..... 
But it says input of 1.1 amp and output of 5 amp??? So does it need 1.1 amp or 5 amp

Okay! Thanks! And it is a 2014 Jeep Wrangler. This means that if the car doesnt have enough power, then it will cut power, and just gotta replace the fuse?
Cool! But, are you saying the Wii u uses 5 amps or 1.1 amps
Wait! The Wii u uses 5 amps? The power brick says it only needs 1.1 amp input though???? When ever I look it up something about "call of duty Jeep" Comes up, can you explain?
Okay! Thanks, so when I want to charge my phone just don't use the wii u? Thanks!!
Why in the world does this have 667 (now 668) comments, but (if it's not a glitch) I'm the only one who upvoted??? Why did nobody else upvote?
Lol, it doesn't matter to her. As long as people buy the book she gets money
/r/outoftheloop
in the preview picture, I though it was a picture of the real console and was confused...... Then I realized 
yes
As /u/elzeus said, it was actually 2 "popular" forums that were hacked, so if you use your info, then the hackers could potentially get your info. 
Really CNET?
Oh, the article was a little confusing.
Obviously not the highest quality video ever, but nice!
okay, so its like telling someone not to do something, yet they could still do it, whereas the dns is not allowing them to do something? 
And thanks, i could not find an explanation anywhere! 
why do you need to change dns settings when you can just set it to not auto obtain updates??
Thanks!
Thanks!
oh, okay!
Thanks, and cool stuff!
umm, more like 20, but still.......
yeah, i got splatoon, mario maker, minecraft (even though i already own it on x360, x1, and pc!) and mario kart 8 (so i dont have to run off disc) last night with the brazillian hack!
nope
I'm really enjoying it! And I will check earthbound out!
My main problem
Awesome, I joined the gang yesterday!
Oh, cool. Just got a Wii u and was considering doing homebrew any way to get games that I don't own
Oh, :(. Lol
oh, okay!
Yeah,was thinking about splatoon!

thanks!
Oh cool!
How can you miss having a Wii when the Wii u is also a Wii?

Same as my name, BuzzKillModder
I have switch early and directions are not clear, now my dick is stuck in the HDMI port!
Do you have any lamps around the house?
Me too
I bet the only reason their doing this is because they don't have that many modern games on the switch yet, eventually they will probably give it newer games
Lol
"outside of the occasional timer and using it to control my hue lights and nest thermostat and occasional music playing, I don't really use it." 

Except you are, as a smart home assistant, which is what it is
Really! Well that is refreshing to hear considering that I was on the fence of ghome and echo, but deicided to get home
I agree that Google should add native reminders as soon as possible, but I just use ifttt (if this then that) for Google reminders and it works quite well
I wonder what the game characters think when there is an update
Redeem it on Amazon and buy a $25 Xbox gift card, then ship it to yourself
More platformers
What did they do?
This literally made me laugh, just a casual.. "oh ya I'll send this over to turn 10 studios, no biggie"
More, more, more, more!
It was the flash
Hurry!
Figured it out, my friend (who I game share with) got the game
AWESOME
Exactly what I was thinking
Correct
Well you can record game clips, but they can only be 5 minutes long and can't have commentary.
Oh, you can... Lol
Wait!?!? What?? You built your own xbox? 
From Bradenton too!
Ya, makes sense. Unless they make a good game! 
thanks, Im gold so had to go to website, I can't wait till after school to play
