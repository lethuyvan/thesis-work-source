I did live there. For 10 years. And that’s what I was saying, designated people like security guard are the ones carrying guns not everyone. 
Yeah but it’s not random people that have weapons is what my point was. 
You still pronounced it wrong. 
Security guards carry those weapons, it’s not like random people have them on the streets. 
It’s not really that bad, there is just a small gap between the screen and the glass you touch.

Remember! Diet is more important to losing weight than working out. Count those calories if you must!

For older iPhones yes, but what about the water resistant seal in new ones?
Don’t they send a replacement in the meantime?
Some diet sodas don’t have caffeine 
Then why do PC’s go through the same thing? He’s probably on some old version of iOS and apps don’t support it anymore.
Go ahead and inform yourself first. If you wanted to bloat to everyone you’re gonna get an android device, well who cares..

But usually videos or pics sent through message are just for the moment, but I expect them to see the exact thing I saw when recording it. But I guess a link would work. 
My wife doesn’t care about notifications, all she cares about is Twitter and Instagram. 
Yeah but low quality pictures and videos 
So like airdrop. 
If you want to lose weight, I’d recommend counting calories more! I’ve been doing that for months to great result! (37lbs lost in 4 months)

I see it more like when you see it in the movie you think in awe about how much went into it... but that’s me. 
The only thing that’s stopping me from a fitness watch from garmin. I’ve gotten more into running, but I need my music. 
There’s a sub I haven’t heard of in a long long time. 
I think I’d like to see the full cat without being cropped. 
What AW?
No series 3 will be cheaper when series 4 comes out. 
Can you put music into the garmin? That’s my favorite thing on my AW to use while I run with my AirPods, since I leave my phone behind. 
Not missing Touch ID that’s for sure. Logging into apps without doing anything but looking at my phone is great. 
Or visiting websites where my password automatically fills in with Face ID. No need to do anything. 
Subjective of course 
It’s neat! I mostly use it for fitness so the gps will be better than none. 
I get mine this Thursday! Same jump you did. Mine doesn’t even last a day, I charge it midday

The one with the aunt singing? True. But even knowing Spanish, I spent more time laughing at what they were doing, rather than focusing on the lyrics.
Maybe because it’s a podcast in safari, as opposed to playing in an app. 
They slow down at the end just like these, making them look like they stutter, I just checked them out.

True. iOS is limited, but iMessage is very important to me, almost everyone I know uses it and it’s so much easier. I also have plenty movies purchased on iTunes so staying with iOS is a no brained. But this isn’t about what suits me better, it’s about the fact that I’m okay with spending this much for this device. 
So you didn’t lose them, you have them in google photos? 
I can’t enjoy many things on Android i personally enjoy on iOS, I like the look of the iPhone X, it’s the perfect size for me and I don’t mind spending 999 on a device I use so much in my life. What’s wrong with that?

“Disconnecting nearby WiFi until tomorrow” is what it says. 
Yet I barely use WiFi. It’s case by case scenario, not everyone uses their phone the same way. 
Or it could just turn off in the control center like it used to. 
Yes it does. When you turn it off it says it’s not connecting to that particular network for a day, but new ones turn it back on. 
Because when I leave home and “turn it off”, later in the day it turns on to a public WiFi and so I have to “turn it off” again. Kinda annoying. 
Another one of these threads... Jesus at least search this sub before posting. 
Mine works. 
Can you wait like 2-3days?
Maybe setting up Face ID again?
Turn airplane mode off, then try it. It only disconnects it...
I don’t get close to that. But I do play clash royale very often. 
Read the top comment. 
What’s your most used apps? Have you tried resetting iPhone like new?

No, but burn in and image retention are different. 
No it’s not. Mine works under 20%
I doubt 3 hours is enough to cause burn in. I drive further than that.

It was meant for a Monday or Tuesday, but the update came early, so they are probably releasing it in waves and most likely everyone will have it by next week. US only I believe.

Or even just making the light inside blink red a couple of times. That would let you know it has less than 20%
Or maybe take it to an Apple store, maybe it’s just yours that needs to be changed. I wear sunglasses a lot and it works perfectly. 
In a miniature version. 
Because that usually solves the problem. 
I agree on that, Tesla manages to get the hardcore fans to get the premium models. I use one and love it mostly for the display. After coming from an s8, I love Amoled displays

I go running and don’t worry about the cable in the way of my movements, and best of all, I can set my phone somewhere and do things around the house while my phone is charging  and away. In no way would I go back to wired headphones.

People paid to see the film. The short is a bonus. They don’t have to put one. 
I’ll tell you this much, they have music. Now you can guess what kind of music it is. 
Do you understand Spanish? If so, why not both?
Ok. Then review the short separate. We are talking about Coco. 
Very clean and utilitarian approach to reddit I think. 
Battery life is on par to my old plus devices, so no complaint there. Face ID works great that I don’t even think about it, just swipe up. Also I agree closing apps is weird, but why are you closing them so often?
Try narwhal or Apollo for reddit. Both are great. 
But I couldn’t do without tap to wake if I went to a plus model again. 
1.	Ok so you haven’t seen it then. 
2.	Again, what does that have to do with your issue with the film?

1.Have you seen the book of life?
2.	How is the short related to the film itself?

I can buy a used car instead of the note 8 as well. 
My phone slips off without a case overnight. Is that happening? Try with a case and let us know. 
It is known. 
I mean on paper the s8 might be better. But Apple’s ecosystem works great for me so I stick to them. 
I think there was enough balance for people to understand what the song was trying to say. 
I enjoyed the “short” very much. It had very good music for something that’s just treated as a peak into the Frozen world. I mean I’m not a big frozen fan, but i didn’t mind watching it. 
Turn on airplane mode and don’t use your phone and watch it last longer...

That’s very true! Enjoy that extra battery life!
Have you tried the usual steps? Restart iPhone> reinstall apps>restore iPhone. 
Every year there is reports on them, there are mistakes in the assembly line, there are always a few. 
I’m sorry it didn’t work out with the X, I just came from the 8 plus, it’s a great phone, but that look is so boring to me. 
How does it look there? I’ve been tempted on getting the iPad 9.7, it’s on sale for 199!
You’re out of your element 
See, I would have less because clash royale would be using all my battery up. I keep thinking my iPhone X sucks but then I remember I play for a couple hours straight 😅
That sucks, mine works 99% of the time! I always just swipe up on my screen not even looking if it unlocked yet, it’s that fast. But I did do as OP said, did Face ID setup very slowly. 
I never used split screen when I had my s8, like what two things do you do often that can’t wait a second? Watching a video while having the maps open is what someone mentioned, why are you driving and watching YouTube? Idk. 
There is no option for higher quality than 1080p
That’s exactly around the time. 
Not in the US yet. 
It’s not always about looking for everything, It’s also about not knowing you had that question until you saw it for other people. So let him ask, because it made me curious to come check out since I hadn’t thought about that, and i come in here to find you. 
Can you? 
Do a full reset would be your next step. Start fresh, maybe setup as new iPhone to test it out. 
Keep trying. I found one in Los Angeles 3 days ago, by looking at the Apple store app very early, got one that day. 
Could they do it? Yes. Will they? Who knows. 
Only Apple knows the reason. 
In short, no. 
I don’t believe so. I read somewhere you can’t. 
But it’s black 
How?
Doing what? Light browsing?
Early morning!
Ah my mistake. 
Check the Apple Store app for availability every morning, around 6 am is great! I got mine in the west coast the same day and I never preordered. 
I think you’re talking about Apple Pay, the contactless payment method, whilst the newer beta brings Apple Pay to iMessage sort of like Venmo or PayPal. 
Wtf are you talking about 
I love Frasier. 
Why are you asking that question?
That’s the most neutral review ever haha
you said 80% of what the X does

thats the media though
thats exactly what I was thinking would work great

like which phone does 80%?
Where do you get this from?
Maybe lower volume with the slider on screen?
I think you’re thinking to much about it. I tried it a couple of times and it’s fun to send to my gf, but no one claims it’s a Must Use.

Not true. 
No, any that draws that much power will do. Not exclusive. 

The verge “the 7.5W speed seems to be available for any Qi charger that supports the higher output — not just on Apple’s two approved pads from Belkin and Mophie.”

If design is bad why are there still good sales? You can’t just say it’s because “they’ve always sold well”... lol rofl lmao

 Not really 
There is glare mate, it’s not as bad as before, but it’s there. 
It resizes them but in games like clash royale it cuts off the edges because all it does is zoom in to fit the screen.
And don’t forget the glare from the curves. I’m not saying the s8 has a bad screen, I’m sure more people would enjoy a flat screen than a curved one. Besides, if most consumers really care for visuals on the screen, then the bigger sales of the current iPhone say something. 
What do you mean “really really”? Videos filmed in conventional 16:9 are cutoff on all big screens. 
Exactly. Which is why the iPhone X approach works great for me. I don’t need the actual screen to reach every edge. 
How annoying, I just tried to put a profile pic like you did. They need to fix that quick. 
So does any phone with a tall screen. The s8 for example, many apps aren’t supporting the taller screen. 
In my opinion bezel-less is dumb, how is gripping the screen something you want? Too many wrong inputs when I used the s8 because that edge was annoying and useless, what does it bring to the table? 
Good luck with that. 
I actually jumped from my s8 to the iPhone X, and have the complete opposite thoughts. I hate the edge to edge display on the s8, gripping the screen isn’t pleasant while trying to use the phone one handed. 
They do. 
Expect*
Why would it be adorable?
Usage is not equivalent to screen on time, even background process like listening to music while the phone is locked counts as usage. 
It tells you how long you’ve had an app on for the last 24 hours. Not since you unplugged. 
I’m sure Apple wouldn’t release it after Christmas since it would be great to get as a gift to someone you really like. Unless there are delays of course. 
I mean on my X I don’t even notice a color shift enough for it to bother me. My screen is great. 
Background usage as well. I’ve had my X for two days, yesterday I checked at around 13% and had around 6 hours of usage. 
Can confirm, I’m in the LA area, and checked out of the blue, and sure enough, around 6ish I saw plenty stores with stock space gray 64gb. I just had to reserve it then and there. I never even pre-ordered. 
I feel bad for the people that preordered and haven’t received theirs. I had no intention of getting the phone because I knew the wait would be crazy, but I checked my local Apple store at 6 am and saw plenty stores had stock, so I got one the same day. (Los Angeles area )
I checked the Apple store app on Sunday, they had one in my area(LA), got it that same day. 
? What am I missing, I know YouTube was running in the background using battery, but almost 2 hours on YouTube and your battery looks okay. 
Check very early on the Apple store app, I got mine the same day. 
Mcdonalds 
Don’t think so, although Apple has acknowledged they are working on a fix. 
I know what you mean, and it’s not zoomed in by software. They have different focal lengths. 
Yes.
True, they do good portrait photos. But what about zooming in? I’m sure they’re not as sharp as those with two cameras. 
Hm sure you’re welcome, anyone is. Enjoy your new  device. 
It fixed it for you, not everyone else, if you see it everywhere, advise them to update as well. 
Fixed in beta 3 released today apparently. 
It’s also about aesthetics I think, makes you feel like something in the software is there always like the home button was. But options is always welcome I guess. 
Do not disturb is off?
Cheaper would be my first guess. 
True. 
That sounds normal to me. 
I don’t ever want to be offline. 
Mine is very fast, I just swipe up and don’t wait for the unlock animation. I’m on 11.2 b2
What?
Of course it is. 
Are you on the beta as well?
“Cheaper”
Doing what? I play lots of games and mine doesn’t come close. 
I only have WhatsApp from that list, but it looks fine to me. 
Don’t stop searching buddy, I checked very early and was able to reserve it. Hopefully you get it soon! I can’t put this phone down. 
I had no intention in buying this iPhone anytime soon, because i imagined the wait would be crazy. I checked availability today at 6 am in Los Angeles and found one in stock! I’m loving it already
But then whatever device you get will still have issues, maybe even software related. So I’ll wait until you beta test it for me so I can get the next version. Thanks!
Thanks for being a solider.

A lot of iOS do in the USA. Where the majority of iOS users are. 
Woosh
I’ve seen videos... it takes no more than a minute 
Same as iPhone 8 Plus I believe. (I’m jelly of iPhone X posts 😭, even though this phone is great!)
Apple tries something different and everyone is calling it unnecessary, let them do what they think is better.  
Did we watch the same video?
This exactly, since pixel 2 XL is having problems, let’s call out another phone...
I like it. 
Yeah, I’m sure no one knows what iMessage is. 
That’s oled for you. 
They already did, on the iPad 
What? Do you have a link?
That’s correct, the iPhone won’t charge any faster if you buy the more expensive ones. 
Same feeling here.... although I’m not as envious of soon to be iPhone X users because I know my 8 plus has better battery life. And that’s the most important thing to me. 
Next time really think about it. It’s useful in my case because I go run with AirPods very often, and there is no better mix for me. 
I just checked mine and noticed it’s true... let’s wait and see if they bring it back. 
I still have my series 0 from day 1, and no issues yet, other than it being painfully slow. If you have enough to spare though, 49 bucks isn’t much for peace of mind. 
How do we know it’s not?
I can’t really tell, I feel like it’s the same.. it takes a while to open and scroll through music. I’ve been thinking about upgrading but I can’t justify it. I just went on a run without my phone where I knew the distance, and It was spot on even though it lacks gps, I guess I’ll keep it longer. 
Who says they didn’t ask him to?
 
Edit: Why the downvotes?
Also iPhone 8, 8plus
I blast it at home. I don’t have a family. So there’s that. 
Lawyer up
True. I wish they at least had an option for that, because I can see people not wanting the phone to unlock immediately in case they just want to glance at the notifications. 
Not in anyway that it will damage it. But it will get warm 
The title is wrong, but in this case, it was faster. 
But he’s demonstrating going to a specific app within the lock screen

Now I’m hungry. Thanks. 
Nice try, John
I do miss that, although I like that the search option is quicker on Apollo, since it’s at the bottom. 
It’s not the only problem with the pixel screen though..
Not on mine. 
No iOS release is perfect.

Go to software?
Please go on
I use Apple maps here in LA a lot, I prefer to have the maps in the lock screen, something google doesn’t do.

I’m pretty baked right now, but can you? Or is a joke?
Yes. 
It’s very far! Lol jk

She’s very gangly, wouldn’t you say?
This is burn retention then... not image. 
They have smaller batteries as well
Good luck! Enjoy the battery life and enhanced cameras. 
I use mine to charge my phone overnight, so it being slow doesn’t matter to me. 
I get to enjoy it forever. 
I switched and it’s been the same for me. I just like to have the option. 
Question, why don’t you upgrade to the new unlimited plan with hotspot?
What comments?
Oh! I just tried it now, dang, I might just keep this app instead of narwhal
How about reply? I was used to swipe from the right to reply. 
Olaf could beat the crap out of Rudolph!
That vehicle is not a Tesla. That’s who he’s calling a phony. 
Only plus models, the 7,8 have 750p
That’s the 7.5w wireless charging capability. 
A lot of android phones do...
Get the 8 or 8+. If you’re someone to hang on to devices for a long time, make it future-proof. Go with the plus size for amazing battery life, 1080p screen and improved camera!
I didn’t know!! Thanks!
You’re funny!
Downgrade or not, it’s still an action that happened wanker
4. When AirPods are connected to your device, open the box near the phone to get detailed battery life 
Happening on my 8+ as well. 
And I would as well...
The snappiest 
You better get a sock lubed up
No movement. 
Like a giant albatross hopping on stilts 
Lmao!
Try a full restore before you decide to take it into Apple, your phone should be blazing fast, I know mine is. 
https://youtu.be/g73ygzmOOqA
What update are you on?
Not on mine... maybe do a full reset? Restore? 
https://youtu.be/IENpcstO4h0
A brisk walk is considered exercise for Apple. 
Also check r/applewatch

This right here. 
No issues on mine. 
Yes you can, just not the Japanese iPhone 
Not public beta, for developers. 
Yes, unfortunately. 
Drain swampier
No. 
Go to r/iosbeta
No way... kourtney all day. 
No burn in on LCD
No trouble on my 8+ with a 30 dollar wireless qi pad from Best Buy 

I wonder how many people have called just to messed around now...
Is that Church?!
Most likely on par if not a bit under the iPhone 8 plus battery. 
Do you maybe need glasses?
That’s no banner, it’s painted on there. 
Settings>Siri > turn on search for all apps
Lol that’s a downgrade, I thought you’d get the pixel or s8. 
For Reddit I recommend Narwhal... one of the very best. 
And if you edit any of your pictures, try using the editing tools in the photos app itself first, it’s not that bad. 
Wrong!
It would be good looking with or without it, so what? Do we all have the same opinion here?
I agree. 
I disagree. It’s kinda unique. 
Either way 
Never had that issue. 
https://i.imgur.com/jay7TyN.png I never knew that! 
So how do I calculate for today’s charge?
As is mentioned every post that talk about him. 
Show off
There is no screen on time measurement in iOS. 
Shame. 
Damn, I use it a lot more than you then, because by that time it’s dead. I do game a lot and use reddit like crazy 
Do so. 
I take it you haven’t seen an iPhone 1080p screen up close... it looks much sharper than you think on an IPS display 
Boise? No thanks. 
At least you have the option to use google services 
Of course there are pros and cons for both, notifications being one of them. I’m sure android wishes it had something like iMessage. 
Home button. 
What if you don’t want to close all? Same thing 
Yeah but do they replace or fix phones there? I assume they just sell them. 
So how do you close apps on android? How is it laborious? 
You read it. 
A kid bending an iPhone... what age are we talking here?
Downvotes because it’s a iPhone commercial... 
“An iPod, a phone, and internet communicator..”
Looks like you were wrong. 
Warranty is good for a year. 
It is safe for the phone. I’m sure apples website agrees with me, I can look up the link later. 
Enjoy your new baby, I got a silver one!
What do you have now?
Never!!
Whoever told you that lied. 
Sure, get the 256gb
I think you’ll only be able to return it in Spain... but maybe europe will work. And of course you should change your phone. You have a year to do so for free
I thought I was tech savvy and I’ve never even heard of this. So “someone” grabbing your phone is rare enough without me knowing, let alone him knowing this to freeze it.
Have you updated to this?? 
Lol
Well the new beta has fixed plenty of things, so it can’t hurt for you to try when it comes out soon. 
I’m not your buddy, friend.

Really? I’ve never known... what does it say?
Nike made fitness watches before, that’s why it was logical to work with them. I haven’t seen adidas offer anything 
What about when I like to only have one in? The other weighs down in the other when I’m moving around, so much easier to just have one AirPod in. 
What does that even mean?
My phone bill is already 250
Not that I’ve heard, the Nike editions have been out for a bit, and they still haven’t come out separately. 
Not sold separately. 
Settings>general>accessibility>reduce motion off
Idk if I’ll use pay extra a month, I almost always have my phone with me. 
We are waiting for your reply. 
Are they still hard to come by?
I have the s0 as well, don’t know if the jump is worth it, although I do like that is has built-in GPS. 
Let me know what you think... I’m thinking of getting it. 
Who is it?!?!
Its the style the director wanted, take it easy. 
Turn Assistive touch off!
Silver!! It looks immaculate. 
Ordered what?
Great. 
 long story short, I didn't understand you. 
Last time I saw it, it was a cast member. 
Did you make it?
I don't think that means literally.
Just about everyone if you've been here for a bit. 
So the indoor pictures are crappy cuz less light. 
Go back to iOS 10 then 
Or maybe because Sprint sucks
Ok
Dumb. 
RemindMe! 1 year
Usually it's normal for a day or two 
It's coming back in an update!(3D touch multitasking)
-Snapple 
 If they don't sort it out by when?
It was the boobs
Lmao. That's the important stuff. 
That's different. You are talking the end spectrum in pricing for laptops, he said it was better to get a new iPhone than pay 80 dollars for a new battery, even an iPhone 6 sells for more than 80 bucks. 
Yes you can go back. If you're quick before apple cuts the cord
What? I don't think that's right
BTG reveals that the iPhone 6 is the most unstable Apple smartphone with a failure rate of 29 percent,", This is the max failure. so the failure rate of IOS in general is less than 29%. Earlier you claim that the overall failure rate was 58%. Does not compute!

It sounds like you might be confusing a failure rate for a change in failure rates. Kind of like confusing the annual deficit with the total debt.


That article is very flawed. 
I believe you can still restore it, but it will have  iOS 11, not iOS 10
Makes sense, I'll get the iPhone. 
 You can tell by the way it is
 Not many comments at all. 
At least I'm not left out when new features come out. I wonder when we will get Oreo... 2018?
Very little, but yes. 
Woosh
What are you doing inside the app store?
I can tell you that I switched from iPhone 7 to Galaxy s8, but I'm missing many things from iOS, like imessage, FaceTime audio and Airdrop. This phone does many things right, but some things I just can't stand, like the curved edges(which bring glare, and mistaken input) to the Bixby button being pressed by accident a lot(now there is an official way to disable it I think) I'll be switching back to the iPhone 8+.
I'm sure you're wrong. 
Admittedly? Source for that please. 
Also at least you get updates on iOS. Here people are still waiting for an August update. 
Phishing. Not hacked. 
You know lots of things are happening on the first days of updating, specially with the new file system, give it time. 
Wrong 
What phone is a huge upgrade from the phone before?
If got can find them for the sane price, sure get the 3400, but the 3300 still had so much of the necessary features of a beginners dslr 
Pixels to push...
To be honest, the 1080p screen is great for me. 
Can you milk me!?
Nikon d3300 for the body. Very good camera
Not OP, but I'm switching from a galaxy S8, I miss iOS. 
Im ready mate
We've gone full circle
What phone does? There is always a bezel, even the s8 has it. The edge isn't display. 
Maybe slow for the 8, but hell for the X
I prefer apples approach, my s8 always mistakes my hand on the edge for input. 
But not all in one...
Ayy 
Ok
Obviously it's not too big to carry
What a nice conversation. 
Apple.com first, but it seems the dates are not slipping back. I still see delivery on the 22nd
I see a post like this every day here, you guys insecure or just love bashing on competition?
 well said
I think the airpods are priced competitively given any true wireless earphones are the same price if not more. 
As of 03:12PST I'm still seeing delivery 22nd. I wonder why?
Take it easy
Calm down
Windows 8 sucked 
The phone isn't even out, you're making it seem like it's so difficult to use. 
[Not all the time](https://i.imgur.com/lg6WpPf.jpg)
Apple claims to be looking for a wireless future. That was the first to go. 
Isn't the screen taller in the iPhone X? 
[Not all the time](https://i.imgur.com/Wbq1j03.jpg)
[They do for watching videos. ](https://i.imgur.com/7zlLevq.jpg)
[There is also this, the aspect ratio is longer than the s8. ](https://i.imgur.com/bl0Jioh.jpg) 
But the iPhone X does have more to grip from on the sides than the s8
[But there is also this...](https://i.imgur.com/GIr3yDZ.jpg)
It's up to the developer to add that, I don't think it would be that difficult to adopt,.
Good thing there is icloud storage!
The bezels on the iPhone never bothered me, I miss the home button, and touch ID in front. 
Two things, the glare on the edges and also I do press things with the palm of my hand when trying to reach at the top of the phone. 
Nah,the curved edged is what I mean. 
Downgrade? At least the fingerprint is in the right place. I can also use my phone one handed without touching the edges of the screen. 
Slow animation, maybe. It didn't close my apes like the s8 does often for me
I agree with hexodus
Well it obviously doesn't appeal to you. I'm thinking of switching from my s8. Battery life isn't that great since the last update
If you didn't expect nothing, how were you disappointed
 Oh you prefer Samsung? Shocking
As opposed to me most likely going back, the iPhone 8 plus looks great. 
I still hate it. Can never get it right
The iPhone 7 plus already has 3gb of ram. Besides iPhones work well with that amount. 
Clash royale
made by Samsung but under specs from apple, is what I thought.
besides the speaker for it isn't as good as iPhone speakers.
what a story mark
what a story mark.
and here I am struggling on my s8 to make it work.
its a custom display is it not?
where does it say it has a 1900 mAh battery?
either way its not bezel-less. and the curved screen sucks... there is no point to it.
They also announced a phone called iPhone 8
I have the s8, and when I pull it out of my pocket I can never tell which way is up because of it. Also the s8 creates black bars in almost everything I do, so its like having bezels anyway.
They said the ones in Starbucks work,  are those apple certified?
S8 has bezels, so I don't know where you get that from
Touch ID is still there in the 8
That's exactly what I wanted actually. 
Good...less people getting an X
*they're
 that's what they messing, upside down and on the other ear 
 that works great!!

 You get less than 64 actually. You gonna bitch about that too?
 Not the same
Are you serious? You paid for a 60kwh, that's what you get. Tesla put a 70kwh battery to ease manufacturing. Whats hard to understand?
Doesn't matter, the point is to grow and make more.
Then don't support it when it comes out. Disney had a lot of content. That's why they are able to do this. 
I'm sure he's joking... Or he's a kid and RIP

I just bought a Galaxy s8, and checked Instagram after reading this post. All I see is cases for my phone
Why not just call out  Bill Gates?

Except a MacBook in Australia costs around 1,900. 
The next Apple...
I'm surprised she did something good. 
I'm American and say queue as well...take it easy. 
Why are you lying OP?
But his scenario is in the norm for me...i drive 5+ hrs sometimes, and leave it in auto brightness.
Well, mine does around 5 with heavy use. So 11 with very light use doesn't seem too far out.

You forget that apple is releasing 3 phones. And the "8" is the most expensive one.

Yeah but he's correcting the guy that said iPhones start at $850
Why are you bringing Apple into this? Salty??
"high stress situations" 
"Hurry!, Give me your number or the world ends!"-maybe someone 
True, although battery capacity is less than s8+
But there's also 4k video
Mine freezes sometimes with Instagram. Everything becomes unresponsive until the screen times out. 
Don't even have a 4k tv. Only thing I can think that is like to see is YouTube. 
16gb is too small... 512gb is too big... make up your minds!/s
I think it should be. The more it lasts, the less you have to be waiting around a plug to charge it.
I just switched to android and can say the same thing. Many things I miss from iOS

So it's not a 5. What software does it have?
So a 6 year old phone. 
I just noticed this today! Hopefully an update comes soon 
What iPhone is that?
I just got the s8 too, but I wouldn't say I'm never going back. I like to change it up once in a while

How are the AirPods in the new beta? I reverted back to iOS 10.3 since it would disconnect too much. 
Apple gave you pinch to zoom. Be grateful.  
Yes
It's what I said 
I encountered problems of connection with iOS 11. So I went back, but if you say it's not that.. I wouldn't know what's going on

Not sure why you are receiving downvotes, it's true!
How many logs do you have? 
Um, thanks. 
For point A: no, you can hear everything. I wish I could pause them quick when someone talks to me, but it's easier to pull one out of your ear because it pauses the music when you do that. Pretty neat!
For D: I honestly don't know! But I imagine they could if they were close and you had the volume all the way up. But I don't think it's that loud for others... they aren't really loud to begin with. 
A) It's a one size fits all size, if the regular EarPods fit you, these will do just fine. Also I go running with them and never worry about them falling off. 

B) They last 5 hours each listening to music, and up to 24 hours when charged in the case multiple times. I not know the exact times you can get out of a regular call but it's less. 

C) No way! I run with these and they don't budge when doing any of the activities I've done so far. 

D) (I'm not so sure what leak means) but you can hear other things around you if they are loud enough. Think of the regular EarPods. 

E) Using it with any apple device will be very easy to connect to. As for a PC, it is compatible, but it might require you to search it or pair it every time you intend to connect it. 
The iPad has it. I'm sure they could make it work for this, plus I'm sure MacBooks are connected to power more than iPads are while using them

No problems for me 
No lag whatsoever. I initially started with iOS 10 when I got them, and they are great. So when i got iOS 11 on my iPhone and saw the problems I couldn't wait for future patches so I just went back. Although I do miss the feature to assign each AirPod an action when double tapping, but I can wait. 
Beta totally,
I was experiencing many connection issues so I reverted back to iOS 10
I work at an airport and I’m not required to do any of that. 
Wut
You can pay to have it replaced at anytime 
You'll love it!
It obviously is a one size fits all, so I understand it won't feel great for many people. But for me they are comfortable and stay put even when running. Also the charging case is great. 
Sure do!
Thanks!
