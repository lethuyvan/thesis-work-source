Parents were just talking about this situation and had a good example. "If you arm the teachers, you'd have to arm the students in case of rogue teachers, if you arm the students, you'd have to arm the parents and have them come in case there's rogue students or rogue teachers" It's just a chain reaction.
Too many students fight for stupid reasons. It'd be for students to just physically fight then to see two students to shoot each other and potentially kill someone. While both have that risk, just one is much higher.

Tapping doesn't work for jumping over the asteroids. 

Edit: Yes you can, you just have to be very precise on tapping.

Nice set, but you should probably use a set with guts and absorption. 

Choc_Ice (11.1)/Boxer (10.5)/Snowman (7.0) = Guts + Absorption 

Guts - Leaves you with 1hp before you die
Absorption - Every hit you make heals you 1% of the damage you made

Basically every hit heals you fully and monsters will likely not one hit you. 

Also use the calculator in the sidebar to find more combinations. 
Does he still one-hit you with 4500 vit?
What about CHOC_ICE/BOXER/SNOWMAN? 

It gives guts and absorption.

Wouldn't that technically make you nearly immortal if monsters don't hit you twice in a row and you don't miss? 

Because you heal every successful hit. 
I found that one but noticed it wasn't actually unlimited, just 5gb limit.

Got to 33.1km boss but got killed instantly. I need to level up more. 
[What about FOSSHub?](http://fosshub.com)
Tapping quickly helps a lot more for bosses. Holding is fine for monsters.
KNIFE (0.0)	INVCLOAK (14.1)	CERBERUS (9.6)

or

CLEAVER (8.7)	INVCLOAK (14.1)	SIRSLIME (4.8)

both give speedup30/speedup30/speedup30 (also should be able to kill bosses) 

technically only leveling up helps for skull enemies or keep going back or forth to try to get fewer skull enemies or none at all.

I actually also have an Telus GS4, using a 4.4.4 GPE Rom. It's a pretty stable ROM I would recommend it. It also gives the choice between things while flashing in TWRP. The developers already have a 5.0.1 version but I'm waiting for more stuff to be compatible with 5.0.1. Besides that the 5.0.1 version is perfectly fine (and stable) to install. 

Here's a link for it: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2537495


Think of it as admin rights on a windows computer. It gives you read and write access to the whole system. Not just the typical documents pictures app files etc. Root only comes with read and write access to any file on your device. It doesn't add any recoveries. Just sometimes a superuser.
Yes it only voids the warranty. If you send it in, they will swap your phone for a new one and charge. (They do that anyway when warranty is over)
Have you tried disabling/uninstalling a bunch of the bloat Samsung adds to the phone. Some of that always runs in the background that makes your phone slower.
You probably haven't flashed it. Luckily you can do this without a computer. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.mkrtchyan.recoverytools&hl=en

Well that's true. But I still think a lot of tweaks around deserve to be paid. Also I think paid tweaks should be donation based. Trial-based also seem forced. For example some people install a 7 day free trial open it once but they don't need to actually use it till later so when you actually need to use it, boom times up. 
Great! Let's celebrate with a beer! 
Probably the same reason why people downgrade to older iOS versions. People don't like the new updates. 
A linux distribution takes months to work on each new full "distribution update," so why is that free? That's not only 1 but a bunch of people learning how to program. For freedom. Just like the jailbreak. It's for unlocking the lock-downs apple implemented in their devices. Why is so much paid? Say I opened ubuntu software center. When I search up something I hardly ever see any paid stuff? Why when I search something in Cydia I see so much paid tweaks? 
If it's really hard work for a tweak, then why is the jailbreak free? That's actually hard work. You have to test the jailbreak for every single device on the same ios firmware. Every time apple patches the jailbreak you have to find new security holes to poke through. Some tweaks are just modifying something already coded so it changes what it looks like or how it works.
