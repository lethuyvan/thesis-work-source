not really "much" more, according to [exit polling](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/08/us/politics/election-exit-polls.html), Whites were split 37-58 in favor of Trump, while 18-29 was split 55-37 in favor of Clinton. In fact, Trump increased in all race demographics as well as the youngest age bracket vs Romney in 2012.

You never really carry as a flex player. Your value as a player largely comes from playing the role that was required, so your skill on average will be less than a one-trick. Someone who might be a 2700 SR Rein and a 2700 Mercy, if playing those roles exclusively, might be a 3100 SR flex player just because they can switch based on demand. But a 2700 Rein against a 3100 Rein is probably going to appear as less skilled and attract a lot of hate.

Ben Shapiro and Dan Bongino are great if you're into the policy stuff. Ben was NeverTrump but is coming around. Dan is full MAGA and ex-Secret Service.

Larry Elder also has a really good radio program. Thomas Sowell is probably one of the best conservative authors (e.g. the books "Black Rednecks and White Liberals" and "Basic Economics").
Back then most people (even internet conservatives) hadn't heard of the alt-right, so it seemed an appropriate name due to Trump supporters not really feeling like mainstream conservatives. Steve Bannon famously called Breitbart a platform for the Alt Right. Gradually people learned that there was already a group that went by the name 'alt-right' (coined by Richard Spencer, an actual white nationalist, around 2008). I think the Charlottesville Unite The Right rally definitely played a part (it was the real Alt-Right attempting to associate itself with more mainstream conservatives) but it was more when the media latched on to the term that people became aware of its history.

edit: reading the comments some people still aren't aware the term existed long before the '16 election

Chip'd and PIN'd at Target today with my store credit card.

Most places use signatures though. My regular credit card doesn't have a PIN (that I know of) but it has a chip. As for foreign cards, the terminals might be able to handle a PIN. They almost always have a key pad which is used with debit cards. So there might be something in the card that tells it whether to PIN or to sign.

Yeah we all knew he rants on Twitter. We all knew he talked tough in negotiations.

The only ones changing their minds are those that were wrongly convinced he was different than in the campaign. That's basically entirely moderates and the NeverTrump conservative elite, both of which we'll have more of in 2020 as a result.

Somewhere along the line, "gender", a grammatical term of which there are more than two in many languages, got mixed up with "sex". Are there more than two genders? There can be. Are there more than two sexes? Yes, there are rare genetic disorders causing more than just XX and XY. Is it a useful description of someone to go by anything other than male or female? I wouldn't say so unless talking about the extremely rare disorders in a medical context. An XXY or XYY individual, while not having the chromosomes of the typical male, will still generally present as male so I do understand decoupling sex and gender to an extent.

I'm all for complete legalization. Don't even smoke.

But I'm also for repealing the concerned parts of the Controlled Substances Act rather than simply ignoring our laws. States should've always been in control of marijuana laws but the 10th Amendment don't real.

The federal government is right to enforce it due to federal supremacy, but the states should be fighting to have it ruled unconstitutional. It still might be Constitutional due to the federal government's authority to enact treaties (the Controlled Substances Act being the implementation of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs). What we really need is for Ambassador Haley to be cracking open that nut for us at the UN.

Only place I can find that meets your criteria is Juneau, AK.

Basically you're looking for areas in the north (lower average temp) with large bodies of water to the west (moderated climate). The west coast has the ocean but even Seattle hits above 80. The Great Lakes are too small to have significant moderating effects. There's south and central Florida which is moderate but too far south to keep it under 80.

But also one thing to consider is that areas that don't get above 80 generally don't have air conditioning. That means indoors you'll be similar to the air temp outside whereas in the hotter climates you can be closer to 70. So it might be counterproductive if you hate being too warm.

There's not really a mass exodus. A lot of streamers on YouTube and Twitch are leaving for other games like Fortnite in search of higher viewership. Plus, the game is two years old so people are bound to get bored. Complaining about the devs has been happening since launch and is pretty par for the course in multiplayer games. Some people want more balance updates to fix perceived imbalances or even just to shake things up, some people want fewer to keep the meta from constantly changing. Blizzard has stated that they want more of a "wait and see" approach to balance changes so they tend to be on the slow side, and after they do internal playtesting there's not much time for community feedback before it goes live. But that's not a new thing.

Long answer: you might be able to do something if you got the developer tools from Motorola and hacked something together. I don't think they allow other devices to be compatible with their mods though

Workaround: Use a remote viewing solution, such as RDP, Splashtop, VNC, or Moonlight to show your computer's display on a compatible phone which would then communicate with the projector mod

>He insisted he made the video, which was posted in April 2016, to annoy his girlfriend Suzanne Kelly, 29.

>But Sheriff Derek O'Carroll found him guilty of a charge under the Communications Act that he posted a video on social media and YouTube which was grossly offensive because it was "anti-semitic and racist in nature" and was aggravated by religious prejudice.

>Sheriff O'Carroll told the court he did not believe Meechan had made the video only to annoy his girlfriend and ruled it was anti-Semitic.

$275 over the course of a two year contract is $6600. That's $2200 per line.

With Red Pocket, a reseller of Verizon services, you can get 10GB per line for $60/mo or $1440 for the 24 months. Leaving you $760 per line to spend on whatever phones you want before you break even, or about the cost of a Galaxy S9.

That's a pretty expensive no contract plan. If you go with something cheaper like Mint SIM (a reseller of T-Mobile), you can get 10GB of data per line for those 24 months for a total of $600. Leaving you with $1600 per line to spend on whatever phones you want. That's double the price of a Galaxy S9, so you could upgrade every year instead of every 2 years and break even.

And that's assuming you want 10GB per line which is a pretty hefty plan, but I don't know you so who knows. Most people would be fine with 2GB or 5GB which can halve that cost.

Yep restrictive touchscreens are dirt cheap, work through gloves, and can be used with a simple stylus. The downside is they're less responsive, aren't able to do multi-touch, and fall out of calibration as the plastic layer stretches and ages over time. It's dumb to be using resistive touchscreens these days without a special need, but that's government I guess.

not true, ~~since you didn't watch the video~~ here's the timeline of things:

1. February: Passed out "Allah is Gay" flyers in Luton, UK. Police confiscated her flyers and told her not to continue to distribute any more, but charged her with nothing.
2. Returned home to Canada
3. March: Traveled to Calais, France with intent on going to the UK to visit friends and Tommy Robinson
4. Attempted border crossing via the Chunnel (Calais -> Dover)
5. Detained and questioned under Section 7 after her passport was scanned
6. Received note that she was refused entry

There's no excuse for harassment against Crowder of course, but I do think he deserves being suspended and having the video taken down for filming a private support group to ridicule them for no reason other than laughs. He's done other great undercover videos but I don't see why this needed to be done. I say this as a regular viewer of the show.
I agree. It didn't persuade anyone and just made him look like an ass for crashing a support group. Whether you believe gender nonconformity is a thing or not, these people clearly have things to work through together in private but acted nothing but calm and kind in the face of public ridicule. The show doesn't come out looking good from this one. Exposing the government paying for gender reassignment surgery for children? Fine. Exposing a violent Antifa plot? Great! This? Helps no one.

Honestly I don't doubt something like this could happen, but for completely innocent reasons. Graphically showing a selection different from what you pressed would be a very dumb way to rig an election. Probably just a mis-calibrated or damaged touch screen.

90% of the improvements in a chip come from the fabrication process.

Easiest way is to simply make sure XMP is enabled in your BIOS. These are specs built in to the RAM that often aren't used by default in some motherboards, but the RAM is built to operate at those speeds.

There should also be controls to manually change the frequency. Not much you can screw up unless you mess with the voltages too much. ~~DDR3 is safe to around 1.6v but keep it closer to 1.5v~~. If you push it too hard your computer won't turn on so you'll have to reset your BIOS settings by pulling the CMOS battery. The exact methods to do this vary by motherboard but you should be able to figure it out by reading the manual.

Also, since you're on integrated graphics, you may be able to get a mild overclock on your CPU as well by changing the BCLK. Normally video cards don't like you messing with this setting much at all but the CPU and RAM also calculate their frequency from it and can tolerate it better. And you don't even need an overclockable CPU.

edit: I googled your chip and it looks like it's a laptop one. These settings probably don't exist for you unfortunately.

edit2: also it's Kaby Lake so disregard what I said about DDR3 RAM. I thought it was Sandy Bridge or something.

There was an injunction by a district judge in the 9th Circuit. They basically judge on a federal level. So the repeal won't be able to go through until either the 9th Circuit allows it (extremely unlikely given the 9th's bias) or it gets appealed up to the Supreme Court where they say if it's constitutional or not. SCOTUS has declined to skip the appeals process so it's going to take a little while.
They think they can still blame it on Trump and the GOP despite them literally offering amnesty. When criminal aliens start getting mass deported they're going to start up the war drums.

Correct for the most part. If it ever gets to 100% from braking (and it can, but not in normal use on relatively flat streets), the regenerative brakes stop working properly and you're just wasting energy to friction through the normal brakes.

With the Energi you can plug it in to get it to 100% but there's really not much benefit to that in the regular hybrid.

The only way for it to be fixed is for the healthy parts of the countries to amputate themselves and let the other parts fester and die out. Then reunify once no one wants to live there anymore.

I think it's a measure that is put in place due to the infrastructure spending bill he wants to pass. That's going to increase the price of steel quite a bit making imports look more attractive. We wouldn't get much benefit from a rising cost of steel if we imported all of it.

Deductible is the amount you need to pay out of pocket per year before the insurance kicks in. You want it low so that you have to pay less in the event of a bad health situation. Given OP's plans I'd take the high deductible one though because the monthly payments are so much less. So you'd think of it like this. In a year, would you expect to use $3000 of medical services? Most people probably would not, but if you did you'd be out between $1-$4000 more with the high deductible plan. Over 20 months you'd save that much money just by paying less in premiuns. So if you can manage to use less than $3000 of services in 20 months you'd be better off with the high deductible one.

Insurance plans also often get you deals on prescriptions or preventative care (such as the flu shot) though.
Basically you pay $200 per month for the insurance and any visits or procedures out of pocket up to your deductible. Anything above that is paid for by insurance. 

Most people won't rack up $3000 in medical bills in a year (I spent all of $40 for an office visit last year...) so generally you want lower payments. As long as you don't exceed your deductible in 20 months ((7000-3000) / (400-200)) for the proposed plans you'll 'come out ahead' with the high deductible.

Redirect nearly all welfare funds to relocation services. Get able-bodied people who are looking for work but can't find it out of the sticks and the ghettos. Also relocate those who can't work to areas with a lower cost of living to more efficiently use resources. It'd be a big change but the long term benefits would far outweigh short term problems. The left would hate it due to cutting welfare, the right would hate it due to it causing the death of most of rural America.

>There is no room in this country for hyphenated Americanism. When I refer to hyphenated Americans, I do not refer to naturalized Americans. Some of the very best Americans I have ever known were naturalized Americans, Americans born abroad. But a hyphenated American is not an American at all.

>This is just as true of the man who puts ‚Äúnative‚Äù before the hyphen as of the man who puts German or Irish or English or French before the hyphen. Americanism is a matter of the spirit and of the soul. Our allegiance must be purely to the United States. We must unsparingly condemn any man who holds any other allegiance.

>But if he is heartily and singly loyal to this Republic, then no matter where he was born, he is just as good an American as any one else.

>The one absolutely certain way of bringing this nation to ruin, of preventing all possibility of its continuing to be a nation at all, would be to permit it to become a tangle of squabbling nationalities, an intricate knot of German-Americans, Irish-Americans, English- Americans, French-Americans, Scandinavian- Americans, or Italian-Americans, each preserving its separate nationality, each at heart feeling more sympathy with Europeans of that nationality than with the other citizens of the American Republic.

>The men who do not become Americans and nothing else are hyphenated Americans; and there ought to be no room for them in this country. The man who calls himself an American citizen and who yet shows by his actions that he is primarily the citizen of a foreign land, plays a thoroughly mischievous part in the life of our body politic. He has no place here; and the sooner he returns to the land to which he feels his real heart-allegiance, the better it will be for every good American.

He's referring to the labor force participation rate, absolutely something that needs to be looked at. I'm not sure where he gets 5.4 million from, YOY from 2016 to 2017 it appears to have increased only ~0.4 million. The change is from an increase in people "not wanting a job" (looks like mostly in 55+ people), whereas the number of people who want a job yet are not in the labor force has decreased.

There are 3 branches of government: 

* The Executive, headed by the President (the President and his staff called "The Whitehouse" after the building they reside in)
* Legislative, headed by Congress (split into two, the Senate and the House of Representatives)
* Judicial, headed by the Supreme Court

These branches are considered co-equal, so they have the abilities to overrule each other. For example, if the Legislative branch passes a law, the Executive branch can veto it or the Judicial branch can rule it unconstitutional and it will not become law. 

When "The House" has the memo, that refers to the House of Representatives. The other chamber, the Senate, doesn't have the authority to view or release the document in the House, nor does the President because Congress isn't subservient to the Executive branch.

I use Spotify, used to use Google Play Music but I've been trying to curtail my usage of Google services. Don't really miss anything from GPM, and probably the nicest thing about Spotify is that I can download my entire library to the phone. In Google Play Music the best way was probably to add everything to a playlist that was marked for download. Also love the Spotify Daily Mix radios.

Tried out Deezer for a while, but the radio was utter crap. When you mostly listen to less popular metal/rock and Justin Bieber comes on (seriously!) you know something's up. They tried to hawk pop music so much that it got in the way. Spotify does to an extent but it's easy to ignore. GPM doesn't really do that at all which was nice I suppose.
Fellow Digg refugee here. It's just extremely difficult to move a userbase to another site. Only instances I can think of were Digg -> Reddit and MySpace -> Facebook.

The userbase of T_D grew out of normal Redditors though. The rest of the site became significantly more of a political shitheap but all the stuff we used to come here for are still here. So in that way I don't think it's possible to truly divorce all of T_D from Reddit. There's a significant portion of users who never went on Reddit at all before T_D and pretty much only post there, I assume they'd be more likely to migrate. But the majority of us are just Redditors.

There's also the fact that it just isn't *bad* enough for us here. Really the only ones who migrated to Voat were forced off the platform - fatpeoplehate, coontown, jailbait. T_D is still very much allowed to exist so there's no significant pressure to leave other than carrying a stigma on most other subreddits. I doubt there ever will be significant pressure on us because we brought a lot of fresh blood and brought some demographics that Reddit was sorely missing (over 30s). Teens and 20-somethings just aren't terribly good for ad revenue.

Unfortunately I can't charge mine (currently an apartment dweller) so I have a de facto C-Max Hybrid. But yeah, below zero temps + running the heater + short commute = no bueno. There's an electric heater that dumps battery power to heat the coolant when the engine's not up to temperature yet, and it doesn't get up to temperature on my commute when it's that cold. So it's pretty much not even a hybrid at that point. But it's a great car otherwise

everyone's picking big cities but most big cities are similar to live in. I'd go with something like this:

3. Knoxville, TN (representative of the southern midwest and the south)
4. Portland, OR (representative of the west coast)
5. Phoenix, AZ (representative of the southwest)

Probably would add a plains city like Des Moines, IA and a true southern city like Savannah, GA (or maybe Charleston, SC to get a more representative mid-atlantic city as well) if I could do more than 5.

Lucio definitely can dish out damage, and as a support your "not dying" positioning is probably better than a DPS main. So it sounds like your DPS were probably spending too much time dead. I'm willing to bet the tanking was an issue, because they give space to DPS to not die. It's very hard to heal a DPS through lots of damage, especially as Lucio so you're not terribly useful to them in such a scenario. In an event like that you might try switching to Orisa, or supporting your Orisa/Rein more if you have one by switching to someone that can heal them better. Lucio excels at protecting tanks with boop or helping tanks (Rein/Winston) chase down targets so he's really more of a "help the team that's already working fine work even better" kind of guy. 
Probably not as much coordination so much as sticking together. I'm in high diamond and still get plenty of games with zero comms.

I'm pro-legalization, but ignoring the law is *not* the way to do it.

Why is it law? Because Congress voted to make it law with the Controlled Substances Act. Why did Congress make it law, because the United States signed a treaty with other UN members to do so (this is also why no other UN countries have legal marijuana). Why does the UN treaty ban marijuana? Because the United States wanted to.

So by not enforcing the law, not only are we eroding federal supremacy, but we are going against Congress and going against the United Nations.

So the thread can start unraveling at the UN.

The Commission on Narcotic Drugs is the part of the UN that decides drug scheduling. We could potentially appeal to them to deschedule as the US was the one who mainly pushed for cannabis to be Schedule IV (maybe they will anyways as a "fuck you" to Trump).

Barring that, the United States could withdraw from the treaty and/or the United Nations altogether. The Trump administration has already begun to waver in its support of the UN due to the Jerusalem decision.

Barring that, Congress (specifically the Senate) can withdraw from the treaty although this is in violation of international law and would piss off the UN. This is probably the most likely scenario. President Trump himself also has the de facto (but not de jure) power to withdraw from treaties.

Marrow donation uses different markers and I believe it's completely unrelated to blood type. If you're in the US, Be The Match is the official registry, for other countries sorry can't really say.

Two years without a match isn't odd, the markers are very specific and much more complex than Rh types. Generally your best chances of matching (about one third) are with a close relative.
she's not too bad anymore https://youtu.be/8z-OhlILrUw
whoo!
Personally for me, I was happy to learn about bone marrow donation. Someone who is willing to go through a blood donation is usually willing to go through a similar process, and even then it's just a registry that you probably won't be called on for. But knowing you can save a life through marrow is just as exciting as saving one through blood.

There's a period of time after acquiring HIV where it's undetectable. There's also Hepatitis B, also much higher of a risk among gay men, that can be transmitted even if it isn't able to be detected. It's actually quite a problem in Africa, which also has high rates of HIV, even though they have detection methods.
I think there's a day or two of recovering for Mr. Bigass-Needle-In-Your-Pelvis, or for the Peripheral Blood Cells it's not much worse than a double red cell donation (your arm might be a little sore for a couple hours). But it's also fairly unlikely you'll even be matched to someone so it's not that big of a risk if you'd need to take time off work.

There's that method, and then also one where you take some drugs, the part of the marrow that they need is released into your blood stream, and they can take it out via apheresis (my double red brothas know what I'm talking about). All depends on what's best for the one receiving the transplant.

I know this is about sports but here's the folding table I have, it works pretty well and if I had to choose to buy a folding table again it'd be this one https://www.samsclub.com/sams/max-chief-4-fold-in-half-table-white/prod2001434.ip

It folds in half and has telescoping legs. So you fold up the legs, then fold the table part, and there's even a nice little handle that sticks out of it. Very easy to carry.
