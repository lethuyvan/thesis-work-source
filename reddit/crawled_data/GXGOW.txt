Been using Gnome on Wayland for some time now with an Optimus setup (Intel/NVidia GPU). Gnome should default to Wayland normally without changing the WaylandEnabled flag, so I don't know what's wrong. Maybe check journalctl for errors? Are you running the latest version of your GPU driver?

They did add an experimental feature to enable fractional scaling, which you can toggle if you have Gnome running in Wayland. It is far from ideal, though.

Strange, haven't had to do that yet on Windows. Both devices work without issues with just adb installed from chocolatey.

Also had some issues with my Microsoft mouse being disconnected and not reconnecting. Also searched far and wide and ultimately I decided to give up. I switched to Arch with Deepin desktop environment. Works like a charm!

Such a pity that I had to switch though. It looked like a very stable and slick distro. Oh well, I still have the desktop environment.
That's probably for the better. Wayland isn't stable enough yet for an LTS release. It is promising though, but not ready for primetime yet.

Haven't really noticed any slowdowns on my OnePlus One (SD801), so SD820 is maybe setting the bar a little too high. Launching these apps on my LG G Pad 8.3 (SD600) is significantly slower, however, but nothing unbearable.

I'm currently using the built-in webserver in PHP v7.1.4 to deploy my applications locally. When I deploy a project (by running

    php -S localhost:8080

from the command line) stored inside my OneDrive folder, the built-in webserver can't find a single file within that folder, so it throws a lot of 

    [404]: / - No such file or directory

errors.

When I move the project folder to a location outside of my OneDrive folder and repeat this process in its new location, the webserver is working just fine. It's really weird. 

Anyway, thanks for the help already!
Oh yeah, I see now. I guess I confused pre-order and post-order a bit. Thanks for clearing this up!
> We fixed an issue resulting in Node.js (v6.9.4) not being able to run scripts stored in OneDrive or access any paths in OneDrive.

Well I guess you broke something else with that fix, since I'm not able to deploy any of my PHP projects from within my OneDrive folder (php continually throws errors that it can't find any files). Deploying from any other path is working just fine.

If you're interested, [I've published the image](https://store.docker.com/community/images/gxgow/dogenode). I do need to perform some minor modifications (like writing a description, for example :P) but what I have, is working.
I find it easier to run applications like that in an isolated environment away from the rest of the system. It's easier to manage this way. 

For less tech savvy people, it is also easier to run 1 or 2 commands to get it up and running. 

And you see, that guide I followed was originally for Linux. You can see that I am running Windows :P

And actually, in the first place, I did it just for the sake of doing it. It's like going through the hell and pain to set up Arch Linux or Gentoo when there's Ubuntu or Fedora. Doing it just for the sake of doing it :)

I will take a look at that. It'll be a nice exercise :D
Haha thanks for the tip :D I'm still learning to use Docker, started using it this week actually. It's not that hard to learn to be honest. I've learned about Dockerfiles yesterday and you're absolutely right, they are a godsend!

But the further I'm getting to know it, the better I see how amazing and useful Docker is
It is mounted, actually. /root is mounted. I did notice that the daemon isn't automatically starting. That's what I get for writing quickly and sloppily :P

I'm busy bundling it into a Docker image so other people can easily get a dogecoin node up and running by just pulling it from the Docker store. I've published some things on [GitHub](https://github.com/GXGOW/Docker-Dogecoin-fullnode) already. What I have, seems to be working now :)
Of course not. That's what makes this community so awesome 😁 
Returns? I think you're confusing this with mining. Dogecoin mining brings in returns, running a node doesn't. It does benefit the community, however.
It's not that hard, actually. I've only pulled the [Ubuntu base image](https://store.docker.com/images/ubuntu) from the Docker Store and then followed [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/6chkqq/please_if_you_can_run_a_full_nodes_by_enabling/dhvay4j).

~~So let me run through the commands here~~

~~docker pull ubuntu:16.04~~

~~docker run --name dogenode -ti /bin/sh~~

~~Now the Ubuntu image is up and running. Now we will connect to a bash instance~~

~~docker exec -ti dogenode /bin/bash~~

~~Now you're running a bash session in the container. Like the comment in the second link says, you need some packages first before you can run that command~~

~~apt install curl wget ca-certificates~~

~~After this is done, you can sit back and relax after you've run the final command. Make sure you're in the home directory (type cd ~)~~

~~wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/JRWR/8510de09d2ee05a8e66d815968420343/raw/ca7062c2a202d50e6575a9cd9317faf9cbee6642/run-dogecoind-fullnode.sh && /bin/bash ./run-dogecoind-fullnode.sh~~

~~This will initialize your node. This will take some time, since it'll download 20 GB of the blockchain through Google Drive. The script will also add a daemon, so the node will automatically start when you start the container.~~

People with multiple hard drives, beware. The issue where junctions to different drives are reset to C:\ still isn't fixed. All shortcuts, registry entries, uninstaller paths, ... to programs on different drives will get reset to C:\ and it is a huge pain in the ass to fix it.

See [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsinsiders/comments/6r2n2d/update_to_16251_rewrote_my_junction_links_in/) and [this feedback post](https://aka.ms/o2uaxj)

Also experienced this. All shortcuts, registry entries, ... reset to the C-drive. Had to perform a clean install after that, since there was too much broken.

I was planning on getting back into insider builds, but I guess it's not going to happen as long as this bug is here.

Normal letters are working just fine, but the emoji aren't coming through, unfortunately.

EDIT 2: It seems Windows has linked all shortcuts, services, ... to the C-drive, including programs which are installed on the D drives. This results in some services not working because they are part of programs not installed on the C drive. Fixing this requires repair/reinstallation of some programs. Mildly annoying, but not system-breaking.

Bugs like the issues with OpenGL apps and switching between multiple GPUs per-app seem to be fixed now. Start menu on the other hand is a little unstable for some reason. It has crashed Explorer a few times already today, which it didn't do before.

Apart from that, great build! It looks like it's nearing its final stages.
It's people like you who make me lose some faith in humanity. Unfortunately there's still a lot of bad left in the world.
It's the things like this which make me regain some faith in humanity. At least there's some good left in this world.

Hidden feature within [labs in Nova launcher](http://www.androidpolice.com/2012/10/01/tip-access-the-secret-labs-menu-in-nova-launcher-for-even-more-customization-options/). It's also a basic feature in Pixel Launcher.

qBittorrent is also a very good alternative
Galaxy S3 Mini to my current OnePlus One. Probably the first time I've experienced the smoothness of Android.

GeForce overlay, probably caused by the the '[multiple GPU selection bug](https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsinsiders/comments/5p2ket/nvidia_dedicated_graphics_not_working_since_build/)' still isn't fixed, so beware of that. It's been reported in the [Feedback Hub](https://aka.ms/xum58t) already. It does seem like it's mostly OpenGL applications which are affected (e.g. Minecraft, the whole Adobe suite, ...).

EDIT: Looks like the GeForce overlay is working in games which were working before, but not inside NVIDIA GeForce Experience. Oh well, it's on the good way already.

Confirmed, still not working.
Maybe 2 or 3. With stickers.
I use it in combination with NFC tags. When I touch the one on the night light, it silences the phone, turns on airplane mode, dims brightness and opens Sleep as Android. Touch it again and all radios and sound are on again.

Also a few other tasks, like extending display time-out in apps like Chrome or Pocket, automatically enabling speakerphone when my device is not near my ear, vibrating every hour to let me know an hour has passed, showing a menu with media apps when my headset is plugged in, and many more. It's pretty useful to me.
It's been running great. I have it for more than a year now and it's smooth as ever on LAOS (or LOS? dunno) 14.1. It supports the LTE bands here, so that's not an issue for me. Battery life could be better, but it mostly lasts through the day, so I'm not really complaining.
Lasted 1.5 years with it, then I bought my OPO. Damn what a piece of shit device it was. CM made it a little faster, but it would still hang and stutter a lot.
Bought it during Steam summer sales. It is indeed a great purchase. It's way easier to use multiple monitors now.
Tried it, it's kinda buggy on my OnePlus One. Sometimes Assistant opens and listens, sometimes the Google app opens and does nothing else. Oh well, didn't really have any problems with Now, so I'll stick with that for the time being.
SAD.
We've been using Orange since January and haven't had any speed/ping issues during gaming at all. It's on the same network as Telenet, so that's no surprise. We didn't really feel the need to buy the boost pack, since 100mb/s is also quite enough for us tbh.
Gaming (Battlefield 1, GTA V, etc.), coding (there isn't an IDE as fully developed as the ones on Windows for Android AFAIK), etc. Windows is just more familiar for productivity usage than Android. I still associate Android more with free time, relaxation etc. I don't feel like it's ready to be as productive as Windows.
Everything's a dildo if you're brave enough.
Oh man, childhood memories. It's been a while since I've seen that movie. Old but gold!
Well I would love to, but safe mode is kinda broken in this build, so I guess I'll have to wait until next build.
I think I lost count of how many times I've lost my faith in humanity after reading some of the posts. It still gives you a good laugh though
Oh, so that's why Explorer was constantly crashing in safe mode. I already suspected it was an insider bug, but I couldn't really pinpoint it. Well, you're not the only one experiencing, but unfortunately, we'll have to wait for a fix in the next build I guess. Maybe submit it in the Feedback Hub?

Both my smartphone and tablet choice were based on the fact that they have decent aftermarket support. Custom ROMs are what keeping both of these devices fresh and up to speed, since I don't plan on buying a new phone/tablet each year. So it isn't only a choice for customisation, it's also an economical choice, since my devices are still running as fast as they did on day one, and they will for the coming years.
1997 kid here, this is my final month of being 19. It's been an honor shitposting with you all!
Second half. The first half has apps which pretty much still have a decent purpose, even though they're badly developed.
I remember when I bought my first flash drive. 256 MB for €30. It was like huge back in the day.
Same thing here. Jumped from the 4 GB S3 Mini to the 64 GB OnePlus One. Haven't manage to use up all of its storage yet. It's awesome!

A new build already? That was fast. Let's try it out.
Sir,  /r/The_Donald is that way.
Settings -> Updates -> Recovery -> Roll back to previous build
Having the same issue, I've posted about it [over here](https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsinsiders/comments/5ndup0/critical_structure_corruption_build_15002/). I couldn't find a solution, unfortunately, and I can't have an unstable system right now, so I've rolled back to the previous build for now.

I do find green looking better than blue.
That's exactly what I had too (look at the logs in the OP). I've rolled back to the previous build for now. I can't work with an unstable system right now (on the other hand, when can you). Guess it'll be fixed in the next build.
Looks like this build already introduced me to the the new GSOD with a Critical_structure_corruption. Well...
I only have an Asus laptop (N551JX) since 1.5 years and also an Asus router (since the proprietary one from our ISP sucks donkey balls). I've been happy with both products, but I guess it also depends on where you buy them, since one of my friends bought an Asus laptop from a local shop which still had personal data from its previous owner on it (it was sold als new though). Another friend had to get his mobo in his laptop replaced because it kept turning off at random without warning.

I guess I'm just lucky

I still use NFC in combination with NFC tags and Tasker. I also sometimes use Beam to send files, just for the heck of it. The trick is that you have to know where exactly the NFC chip in your phone is. On my OPO it's about in the middle, so I always hold that part against the tag and it works like a charm.
Oh, I had the same experience with CM11 on my S3 Mini. I was so glad I got rid of TouchWiz. It was godawfully slow compared to vanilla Android.

I remember the days of flashing CM7 on my HTC Hero. That's what got me into the ROM flashing. Those were some days. CM will be dearly missed.
I noticed it too. Since Google released Gboard with multilingual support, I've switched to that and haven't looked back yet. It's got some nice themes too 😀

But yeah, like you said, it used to be better. Less bloated, smoother back in the days of my S3 Mini, but it got slower over the years. Such a pity, it was one of the best keyboard apps I've used to date.

It sounds funny how the Dutch TTS is reading English text. Doesn't look like it's working all too well either, since it sometimes just stops working at all.

[jgcaap's CM14](http://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-one/development/cyanogenmod-14-0-t3464337). It's been running smoothly and stable so far. He's gonna make the switch to CM14.1 in the coming days too. The only major issue is the fact that video recording isn't working (yet).
Amen to that. Been running Swipe for a long time now and I don't miss the official Facebook app at all.
Oh yeah, my bad. I mix them up a lot.
It looks awkward at first, but it's actually better for big screens. The only annoying thing is the fact that [I can't see any of the search suggestions](https://imgur.com/Gi56RNm). But that'll probably get resolved in a future release.

EDIT: [System Webview](https://imgur.com/RXeEJsA) doesn't seem to like that flag a lot.
muh dank memes :(
Most of the Nougat ROMs are surprisingly stable already. The only major issue on the ROM I'm using is that video recording isn't working, but I can live with that. Apart from that, it is the smoothest ROM I've used on this device so far!

MiXplorer has been working great for me for some time now. Support for FTP, SMB, multiple cloud services, root, etc. Also, material design and support going down all the way to Android 1.6 (probably not an issue for us).

It isn't in the Play Store though, but you can find it on APKMirror.
My ASUS laptop I bought last year did have some more bloatware on it, but it shipped with 8.1, so I just performed a clean Windows 10 install. Boom, gone is the bloatware.

That aside, Asus makes great computers. I'm still very impressed by the build quality and it's still running as smooth as it did on day one (this may also be due to Windows 10). I do recommend them.
Google Play Music and Spotify. Other than that, not anything other I guess.
Yes, yes it is. Haven't had a single SSL protocol error since I've got rid of it. I didn't have any pop-ups, but that's probably because I had enabled silent/gaming mode.
I was still having SSL_PROCTOCL_ERRORS all over the place, but now I got time to troubleshoot a little more. Apparently Avast! was the culprit, so I've removed it for now and now all my web pages are loading properly again. VirtualBox still isn't working, but I've heard the latest test build does work, so I'm going to try that and report back.

Apart from that, no major issues so far!

Et tu, Brute?
Well I've just set my homescreen wallpaper. Then I selected a picture from Google Photos through the Wallpaper app. When you tap 'set wallpaper', it asked me to set it as homescreen wallpaper, lockscreen wallpaper, or both.
Same here. I tried clearing the SSL state, but that didn't do much at all
Well I can open up the console and some files fail to load with ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR all over the console. Sometimes the pages don't even load and I get the error immediately.
No it's Hugh Mungus
Any site using SSL doesn't load properly and gets these errors. Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, etc. Clearing the SSL certificates didn't work, unfortunately
Well that could solve the first issue I'm having already (thanks for that!), but unfortunately, I have no clue on how to fix those ssl errors in Chrome. I'll probably take a better look once I have some more time
VirtualBox still isn't working and I'm getting SSL errors all over the place in Chrome. Same errors as in the previous build, so I'm staying away from it for now until these bugs are fixed.
Chrome, Edge, IE, ... all had problems properly loading webpages. Some elements were missing, some elements didn't load properly, sometimes the CSS was fucked up. Rolled back for now, hoping it will be fixed in the next build.
The best onions. Believe me!
Windows Settings -> Update & Security -> System Restore -> Rollback to previous version

(The menu titles could be slightly different, since I'm using Dutch language and just freely translated the menu titles)
I've rolled back already, so it isn't really needed now. Thanks for the suggestion anyway
Virtualbox doesn't work and web pages aren't loading properly, no matter which browser I'm using. Caches cleared, reset router, flushed dns, nothing helped. Guess I'll be staying away from this build for now, unfortunately. Luckily, this is only the first time I have to do that, the other builds have been stable af for me.
Same problem here. VirtualBox fails to start. Reinstalling doesn't fix it either, unfortunately. Guess I'll be staying away from this build for now and roll back to the previous one, since I kinda need VirtualBox for school.
The wall just got 10 feet higher
I advise you wait a few more weeks until they're really stable before you flash one. There's still some annoying bugs (like unstable camera, no encryption, SELinux in permissive, etc.) Unless you're willing to take those risks, you should head over to the [OPO forums on XDA](http://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-one). There you will find some Nougat ROMs, but make sure to check the bug list first.
/r/ofcoursethatsathing
It needs those drivers for an official release, yes. It doesn't really matter for custom ROMs and it looks like the bugs list is steadily shrinking for most Nougat ROMs by the looks of it.

Heck, there's even an almost stable build for my G Pad 8.3 which has a SD600, so I don't think Vulkan compatibility is *that* necessary.
Ikr? I've been using my OnePlus One for over a year now and I don't have any reason to upgrade either. It's still smooth as fuck and does the job easily. With the Nougat custom ROMs coming, this device will live on for another year at least.

Since the release of Pokémon GO, the sale of power banks on a web shop in my country was doubled, so that already explains a lot.

A while ago, my Seagate HDD was going really slow, way slower than normal, so I didn't take any risks and immediately backed up everything on it to my server. 2 days after that, it died.

I have an ASUS laptop with a 4720HQ, 950M, 16 gigs, SSD + HDD combo and 1920x1080. It does become pretty hot with heavy games like GTA 5, BO3, etc. (about 80-90 degrees Celsius), but I don't experience any lag at all. Just to be safe, I've also bought a cooling pad.

I've found [this](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ccseer/) some time ago. This is the closest you'll get to quick look on Windows AFAIK.
Tasker, SD Maid, MiXplorer, Google Keep, Nova Launcher, Now for Reddit, XDA Labs, Google Keep, Google Play Music, Titanium Backup, Greenify, Swipe for Facebook and Google Photos. 

Most of these are probably already listed around here, but still, these are my must-have apps.
Even more reduced? We already get a reduced ticket price for going to Mol during the festival weekend. Not that I'm complaining, of course.
Probably. Well, I wish you good luck in solving the issue! 
It wasn't even installed when I had the issue. It was using the Standard AHCI 1.0 Serial ATA-controller, and that was the culprit, because when I installed Intel's SATA-controller, the issue disappeared. Unfortunately, that's not the case on your build, so I'm afraid I can't help you any further.

Maybe you could track down the issue with Resource Monitor or, if that doesn't find anything, Windows Performance Analyzer. Maybe you could also check your HDD's health with HDTune or similar software. Apart from that, I'm all out of options.
Deez Nuts
Unpack the zip file and open the file called PNPINST64.exe. That should be the installer. Just follow the instructions then and check after that if you're issue is resolved. If it isn't, then I'm afraid I can't help you any further :(
I've also had this issue on my laptop's primary drive for the past few months, but I finally found a fix last week. I fixed it by downloading the Intel Rapid Storage Driver from the Asus website and installing it. After a reboot, the issue was gone. 

Of course, it occurred on my SSD, I don't know if the solution will work on your HDD. Check in device manager if Windows is using the stock ATA-driver instead of the Intel one. If it does, find the Intel RST driver for your pc, install, and reboot. Hopefully this will work for you too.

Dem Tablet UI days
It was really helpful on the Android 4.1/4.2 (I think?) tablet by Samsung, which had the bottom status bars. Too bad there's no such option for contemporary phones/tablets.
Ten points to Gryffindor!
First thing I did when I bought my laptop less than a year ago. No major issues so far, only a smaller one which started occurring since a month ago. Disk usage on my SSD sometimes rises to 100% for about a minute for no reason, since no process is doing anything. PC slows down to a crawl. Then disk usage lowers again and everything is fine again until the next time it occurs. Probably an SSD issue, will probably format it during the summer holidays. 

Apart from that, Windows 10 is great! I don't regret upgrading at all!
Just so you know, this isn't personal
Just reading that gives me the chills. Thank you, brave stranger!

Bought the hydra and insurgent and still have lots of money left. Still, that's quite enough. They're probably trying to milk us dry.
The Kinsgton toolkit told me that my firmware is up-to-date and that there is still 96% of health left, so I guess that the drive itself is fine. There's still 38 GB left, so that probably isn't the issue either.

I hope by fragmentation you mean optimization, because multiple sources have told me I shouldn't defragment my SSD. The built-in defrag tool told me that my drive has only been optimized a few days ago and that there were no problems.

It came with Windows 8.1, but I upgraded it to 10 as soon as this laptop arrived. Also, this issue has never occured before during the time I have been running Windows 10.

Unfortunately, I don't have a restore point from before the problem, so that option is out.

I'll probably open it up in the coming days or after the exams. If that's no use either, then I'll probably have to send it back to ASUS.

Thanks for the help! I greatly appreciate it!

I've also come across this issue, but unfortunately, I have no idea how to fix it. My pc also freezes for 1-2 minutes multiple times a day with 100% disk usage, but no real R/W operations.

EDIT: The thread now shows that there are 2 replies, but I only see mine. I guess somebody's shadowbanned?
Never thought it would be this useful when I first started using it. It's one of those tiny features which has a big impact on how you use your phone. It's very helpful indeed!

Well looks like System is doing some things, but I haven't figured out what yet. After removing the Play Music extension, however, it toned down a little. The freezes were less long. Also, it's only occurring on my main SD now, not my HDD, so I actually have no idea what is going on.

Thanks for the tip! Apparently it was the Play Music extension gone rogue. I removed it and the issue disappeared!
It was already sorted by highest disk usage, so that's why I've posted this. Otherwise I could've fixed it easily.

Or maybe Tusk is also involved, so Frank's got a way to finally take him down for good. It's just speculation, of course.
First time here, so I'm gonna start of with 30 days. Of course, if I can get past it, the better. Maybe I'll even extend it to 60 or 90 days, but we'll see how 30 days goes first.
Didn't really notice anything from the underclocked CPU. It's still running smoothly as ever!
I disabled Game DVR in the Xbox app and looks like that made the lags less bad, but it may also be placebo. I don't know for sure.

It also happened the other way around for me. Some people started Piracy Prevention, so I hopped into my Buzzard and flew to their Yacht. I was almost there when suddenly my chopper exploded in mid-air. I wasn't killed by anyone, since the death message said 'You committed suicide'.

Those hackers are really fucking annoying man.
Well it's purely for protection, even though my OPO is a fucking tank by itself. It's not slippery either, thanks to the sandstone back. It just feels a little unsafe if it's not wearing a case. There are a lot of beautiful cases out there too, so when you're bored of the looks of your smartphone, try something fresh like a different case.

I hope so too. I did run task manager on my second monitor while gaming, but didn't notice anything unusual. Explorer did crash at some point while gaming and that's when the framerate went back to normal for a few minutes, while using a controller. After a few minutes, it started lagging again.

Maybe I'm gonna try to run games when Explorer is killed. Maybe that may fix the issue, but I'm not sure, however.
Tried to enable encryption on my devices using the built-in encryption tool, but they just rebooted without encrypting them. I think it's a bug in CM13, but I'm not sure.

Oh well, I still have my knock code (Xposed module) and smart lock setup.
I can confirm this issue, but I'm using a PS3 controller and SCPDriver (which basically uses the Xbox 360 driver). The weird thing is that I only get serious framelags when I'm moving the left analog stick. When I'm not using it, the game keeps on functioning rather smoothly.

I hope they'll fix this in the next build.
Don't forget the ones which also make noise which you can't turn off.
My pc doesn't freeze anymore either, but this build introduced a new bug with the controllers. For some reason, when I'm using a controller, my games are lagging like hell. The framerate drops to 10-20 fps or lower for some reason. Everything's fine when I'm using mouse+keyboard.
Also experienced this issue. I thought it was a bug in SCPDriver, since I'm using a PS3 controller.

The weird thing is that the frame drops only occur when I'm using the left analog stick. When I don't touch it, no frame drops occur.
Bring Me The Horizon has beaten Judas Priest. Impossible! Oh well, the rest of the list is still fucking awesome!
It significantly increased for me since the Snapshot build, but I'm using Sultan's CM13. When it was based on the nightlies, I also could barely get above 2 hours of SOT.
Played it on PS3 for 2 years and then switched over to PC. There indeed is a HUGE difference in quality overall
I know that feeling. I still suck online, so I don't really dare to play online anymore
Why, people, WHY?! What the fuck is wrong with those terrorists? I don't consider them human anymore after such actions. Multiple innocent lives destroyed, again, and for what? There were families with children out there. Don't they realize what they've done?

If you don't know what video your watching, you'd never guess that it is an LG commercial.
Can confirm the Xbox 360 controller bug. I tried to reinstall the scpdriver for my PS3 controller (which basically uses the 360 driver) and practically all other drivers crashed. Only thing left was my mouse and a black screen. No ctrl-alt-delete, nothing! Only a force reboot has gotten me out of it.

Be careful with controllers on this build, guys!
I'm using a OnePlus One and LG G Pad 8.3. My dad recently got a Moto G from his company, because they were switching to Android from Windows Phone due to compatibility with their new applications.

My mom is using an iPhone 5C. My brother's 5C recently died, so now he's using a 5S. My sister has an old iPhone 4, but yesterday she's ordered a OnePlus X on my recommendations, because her iPhone is dying a little bit.

My dad also has an iPad Mini 2 and we also have an iPad 3, surprisingly still standing strong.

So by the looks of it, the amount of Android devices is slowly increasing.
Nice! Now we can easily take those campers out :P

I remember the Hero also had a notification light in its trackball. Ah, those were some days
Google gave them a small loan of a million dollars.
Changed it through Settings, so I guess that's a build.prop edit
Weird, I've also changed my DPI, but SwiftKey is still working without any issues. But I'm on CM13, so maybe that's why?
I'm currently using the LG G Pad 8.3, which is still a very decent tablet, even though it was released back in 2013. I bought it last year and paid about $200 for it. I can tell you that it's worth its money. I'm also mainly using it for entertainment purposes and it's doing it's job well. It's got a Full-HD display, so your movies and series will show up in all it's glory.

Go take a look at it. Maybe they still sell it, but there are probably a lot of equivalent tablets out there too.

I've been using DreamLab now for a while. It's very similar and does about the same thing.
It has been reported before over [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/windowsinsiders/comments/46k1hr/help_hibernation_and_fast_startup_is_broken_since/). The current "workaround" is to disable fast startup and hibernate until the next build, or roll back to the previous build. Neither of them are ideal, but there's no other option, unfortunately.
I had to look twice, because at first sight I thought you had posted the same picture as mine :P It looks very similar indeed!
It's like setting up a bot network, so that practically is illegal.

And most importantly, no ads! That was the main reason why I switched from µTorrent a while back. The other features are also very helpful. I can't recommend it enough!

Fast Startup is also broken on my ASUS N551JX since the latest build (14267). On first try it'll stay stuck at the ASUS logo until I turn the pc off and on again. Then it'll boot just fine. Weird issue, but hopefully it'll get fixed in the next build.
16 GB is also pretty sufficient for Chrome.
Well the upgrade time has decreased significantly since I've bought myself an SSD. Man, these things are fast! Never gonna use a normal HDD as my boot drive again.
That's one of those tiny features which iOS has implemented years ago, but Android lags behind on. Not that it's such a huge issue, but oh well.
Something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/KVWoBcU.png)?
Well, the LG G Pad 8.3 from 2013 is pretty close to that when you flash the AOSP ROM onto it. It's still supported by the dev community on XDA onto this day.

Galaxy S3 Mini. I thought it would be kind of the same as its brother. God I was so wrong. It never got updated past 4.1.2 and even though it got CM updates up until 5.1.1, it could still be awfully slow. I'm glad it died a few months ago.
You smart

You loyal
There's this Belgian saying that I find relevant now: "De pot verwijt de ketel dat hij zwart ziet".
My S3 Mini died a few months ago and I was in need of a new phone I could use for the next couple of years. I didn't want to spend a whole lot of money on it (since I'm only a poor student) and I've read a lot of good reviews about the Oneplus One, so I bought that one. Didn't regret it at all. Seriously, more phones should have a sandstone back. 

Oh yeah, it's also buttery smooth and has great dev support.
Today I finally managed to complete Humane Labs Raid - EMP after many failures. There's lots of people out there who manage to crash that hydra.
A little challenging, but that makes the game more fun. I'll add you.
I live in Belgium, so that's an 8 hour difference. That may be manageable.
I've been using Metal since I've deleted Facebook from my phone and tablet. It's a pretty solid and lightweight 3rd pardy app. It even supports notificiations and didn't slow down my devices at all.

Me neither. Sultan's Marshmallow ROM is so amazing already, even though it's only alpha. I'm never going back.
Yup, removed and replaced by Metal. I still do have Messenger though, but that doesn't seem to be such a big resource hog as the original Facebook app. But still, I have seen some gains in performance and battery life, which is pretty great!
I also have that issue with Adobe Photoshop CC. Pretty weird to be honest. Will try the solution posted by  /u/kieljohn.
Nope. It's the exact same process. My OPO was running CM11S when I rooted it and I used this method. So go ahead!
Set my screen to 400 DPI (eh same thing) a while ago. I didn't set up anything too spectacular anyway, but it's good enough for me :P

Hadn't tested it on CM12.1 as I hadn't come across any x265 videos back then. On CM13 the videos aren't playing smoothly at all, so I don't think it's using the HW decoder. 
Looks like more people are about to experience the true smoothness of their device. I'd say, welcome guys! You won't regret the jump!

I bought the LG G Pad 8.3 this year just because of that. It was the 'least worst' tablet in its price range. There were newer ones, but they weren't as powerful as this one. 

To be honest, I'm actually pretty satisfied with it, since I flashed CM on it.
That's why I wiped CyanogenOS from my device a long time ago.
There's a setting which merges open tabs and apps. When you swipe away the last open tab, you won't see this screen anymore.
Well standby battery life has improved a lot, but I can get barely over 3 hours of SOT, unfortunately. I could easily get over 4 hours on 12.1. I hope this will improve in the future release. The ROM is still in alpha stage, so there's room for improvement. Apart from that, CM13 is already pretty stable.
If you're looking for a fairly stable Marshmallow ROM, this is the one you're looking for. Even though it's still in alpha, it's already much more stable than any other Marshmallow ROM. Of course, there are still bugs, but those will be fixed in the coming builds probably.
Battery life could be better. It is already better than any smartphone I've had so far, but there's always room for improvement.

The systemless SuperSU is working without any issues. The 'normal' SuperSU, however, causes a bootloop, so be careful.
I'm on 6.0.1. There were some annoying issues in the first builds, but now, I haven't experienced any major bugs. No random reboots, no battery drain and best of all, a smooth experience!

I'm using this: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andrewou.weatherback

Basically it just adds static raindrops/snow/sun effects depending on the weather on your location. It also doesn't poll your location 500 times per minute, so it isn't a battery drainer at all.

I managed to get it picked only once. It is a nice map. Shame that it doesn't get picked that often.
At least it's not as bad as CS:GO, where everyone constantly plays on Dust2
You could always check /r/microsoftsoftwareswap to get it cheaper, but I haven't tried that myself, so I can't guarantee it's safe.
Came here to say this, but looks like I came a little late to the party. It's one of my must-have apps!
The latest beta. My bad
Haven't had any issues with the Facebook app on Sultan's Marshmallow ROM.
I'm pretty satisfied with my ASUS N551JX laptop. Good build quality, nice specs and that at a very reasonable price imo. I bought it two months ago, because I need one for my studies applied informatics. It even runs heavy applications (like Vegas Pro, Netbeans, Photoshop,...) without any stuttering. 
It's also a very good gaming pc. I can run high-end games like Mad Max, Black Ops 3 and GTA 5 smoothly with graphics set to medium or high. 
I do recommend it, but you're the one who makes the choice.
Now that I look back at this, this was a really short-sighted reply. My apologies for that.
I think the Amazon Fire Phone would be more successful than this. Who would even buy that?
Have you tried opening the link in an incognito window in Chrome and then downloading it there? That mostly works for me. It's a really annoying issue with MediaFire.
Filip Dewinter, is that you?
Or just enabling it in developer options.
I've got an invite for the Oneplus 2 today. First to PM me gets it! :)

Look at Settings -> System -> Multitasking. You can choose whether the apps are shown in the task bar or not.
I know, right? With Sultanxda's ROM, this phone is running as smooth as melted chocolate!
Haven't had any problems with any of my Steam games up until now.
I think I've lost my faith in humanity many times when I read through Sultanxda's thread.
It pops up usually when I leave my pc alone for some minutes. It disappears again the second I move my mouse. No idea what it is anyway.
The LG G Pad 8.3 is still a pretty decent tablet. It's running Lollipop smoothly and I still can use it every day. It's worth its price.
Mostly when I'm only using only one monitor. When I'm using 2 monitors, I barely use it.
I also use it in class so our teachers don't see that Chrome is actually open on another desktop while trying to look busy :P
That was actually my first thought. This should get more upvotes!
Whistle!
That's true. I was probably just lucky enough that I didn't receive a faulty device.
I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. I've bought the device about a month ago and it is working flawlessly. Of course, I immediately rooted it and flashed a customised CM12.1 build since I read that COS12.1 was a bugfest.
It's a great device for someone, like me, who is still studying and therefore doesn't have a lot of cash to spend on a smartphone.
Good thing there are some good 3rd party devs supporting it. It could decently run a custom ROM up to 5.1.1, which it did before I replaced it with my Oneplus One.
Oneplus One here. For the time I've been using the device, I haven't experienced any lag AT ALL. Battery life is also great, so yeah, the 801 is still a great SoC in 2015.
I live in Belgium and it shipped from the UK. Took about 4 working days until it arrived at my doorstep.
Confirmed. It happens with both bookmarks and Chrome apps.
It's still pretty useful for devices which aren't supported by their OEMs anymore. Some custom ROMs also have better battery life/unique functions which stock ROMs don't have. The need for them may have lowered, but I don't see custom ROMs dying in the following years yet.
I also reported this problem a few weeks ago [over here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/3mk6f4/start_menu_tiles_becoming_dark/). Luckily, there's a 'fix' for it. Looks like /u/baolin21 already has pointed it out here.
Got that problem on both of my devices too. The only way to get out of it, is to reboot. I disabled that option ever since.
That's why I flashed a custom ROM a few hours after I got the device. Why would you torture your users like that?
I can understand that. I had mine the day after I ordered it, but I'm not going to RMA it because of this small issue. I can live without sleep for a while I guess 😜
Exactly the same as on my pc but unfortunately, I have no clue on how to fix it.
My €1300 ASUS laptop has been doing the same since a few weeks. It goes to sleep like it should, but when I wake it up, it boots up like I just restarted it. I think it's a Windows issue, because I have tried absolutely everything with no success.
**THE APOCALYPS HAS BEGUN!!!** 
That's not the case. /u/XpRienzo already gave me the solution to the problem. Thanks for helping me anyway :)
They all work without issues, so they're not being updated at the moment.
I already have the latest driver, so that shouldn't be the issue.
It worked! Thank you so much!
Damn, 400 DPI really is the perfect look for the device. Thanks for the tip!
I'm having the same issue, but my laptop restarts as soon as I try to wake it from sleep. I haven't found a solution yet, unfortunately.
Removing OEM/carrier bloatware, Xposed, Viper4Android, breaking free from the (sometimes) crappy OEM stock ROMs, Adaway, limiting Google Play Services's battery drain, ...

Those are my major reasons, but of course, there are many, many more options and tweaks out there for rooted devices. Go take a look, you won't regret it!
The screen-off gestures (double tap to wake, V for flashlight,...) on my OPO. Seriously, I never knew that that feature could be so handy! Especially when I want to turn on my flashlight during the middle of the night
Even though I have the normal version, it's still a great tablet thanks to the awesome developer community!
I'm still having doubts, guys. With all the people having LCD/touchscreen issues, I'm still not sure if I would buy the Oneplus One or another device. It's a great device, but I don't know what the chances are of getting a faulty device.
Where did the music tab go? That was one of the most awesome features about the app :(
It goes to sleep automatically, but it sometimes wakes up without me doing anything to wake it up. That is pretty weird
It installed automatically through Windows Update and I haven't had any problem with it ever since. Maybe a reinstall would work.
1440x900 here, I can see it too. Cannot unsee.
Say what one more time. I dare you, I double dare you motherfucker!
Alright, thanks for the tip! I'll probably purchase it right before the end of this month.
Is it still worth it to get a Oneplus One? My S3 Mini is starting to breath its last breath, so it's probably time for a (not too expensive, I'm just a poor student/power user) upgrade.
Oh, the nostalgia! I remember how addicted I was to games like Flea World. Good times.
21st of September. Your move :)
How did I not know about this? My life is a lie!
I'm using MusicBee. You should check it out, it's also a great music player with lots of options.
Happened to my 8800 GTS 512. This is probably because it's still beta/pre-release software.
THANK YOU! I've been struggling to find a solution to this annoying bug for a few months and it was really that simple. Why is this still not fixed?
Pepperbridge Farm remembers
I know that feel bro :(
Of course we do :)
Yes, I've heard that too, but I don't really care much about the stock ROM. I'll probably use it for a week to make sure there's nothing wrong with the device itself, then root it and flash another ROM.
I've also considered it, it also looks like a great device, but the fact that it doesn't have expandable storage and a removable battery is kind of a deal breaker for me. Thanks for the advice anyway!
My S3 Mini is starting to lag like hell and fail at the most simple tasks, so I've been looking to buy a new phone. I'm probably going to buy the LG G3 32 GB for €399. Is this a good buy or do you guys recommend something else in that price range?
That's what she said
Tell that to non-English countries like Belgium
I don't know what caused by a friend about this and other things that you are have to do so in with in the latest build a new one of the best Xposed modules are you looking for a few days ago by the way to get the best way to get the best way to get to see if the person to be in a couple more than a few weeks and I have also attached to a few minutes ago by a few days ago by the way
Bought it for €189 when it was on sale here in Belgium a few months ago. Didn't regret it at all! Custom ROM development is also still going strong.
The Dev version runs better on my S3 Mini than the stable one, but it's still pretty far from buttery smooth.
No need to wait. Looks like the latest version brought Android 5.1 compatibility.
Here neither. Probably incompatible with 5.1 due to the unofficial alpha version of Xposed I think.

Well at least you don't have pictures which think they were taken in 1970
Touchwiz ran like crap on my S3 mini, so I find this pretty unbelievable. Luckily, the custom ROMs are running waaay smoother!
Back in 2013 I switched over to the Galaxy S3 Mini from my old HTC Hero G2 Touch (which had died at the moment), because I needed something new, but I didn't know that much about the Android world back then. The S3 Mini was on discount at the moment, so I thought "Why not?". I'm a student, so I don't have that much money to buy a flagship device.

To be honest, I was pretty statisfied with it in the beginning, but now, I kind of regret my decision. At the moment I thought it had the same internals as its big brother, but I've never been so wrong. If I could choose again, I would've gone for a Moto G or something similar, because it probably has better support and quality.

Oh well, at least the device is not as horrible as my G2 Touch and on 5.1.1 it's flying again, so I think I can stick with it for another year.
qBittorrent is also a good alternative :) Everything's better than crappy uTorrent.

If only it didn't crash on my device :(
Looks like I'm not up-to-date then. Thanks for pointing that out :P
He probably copied that list from the XDA thread, which isn't up-to-date either.
If only my phone had a navigation bar...
Something Google should do too...
Welp, guess I'll have to uninstall one more app then
The dev will update it, but he's on his finals now, so doesn't have time at the moment. It's not that that much has changed over the versions.
Or, you know, any other country in the world... :(
OmniRom and CM12.1 are working without problems with Xposed installed.
It's been working without issues since the first nightly on my G Pad.
Had issues with it getting stuck too. I always have to kill and restart explorer.exe, but sometimes it then gets in a 'freezing loop' where it wouldn't start properly in and doesn't work anymore until a reboot is done.
Been there, done that. It was fun, MAC OS X is a good operating system, but there were some issues which I couldn't get rid of, so I gave up.
That's one reason to root. I've been running the CM 12.1 nighties without any major problems. This device is flying!
I was able to flash TWRP on v20d some time ago. Where did you get stuck?
Ah, the HTC Hero. I remember it like it was yesterday. Good old time.
And on Now for Reddit
It comes popping up when I'm using Instapic, which isn't running too stable on Windows 10.
Well that'll work, unless you're stuck in a boot loop :/
How are we going to boot into recovery now?
Same here on my S3 Mini
*cough*Lollipop*cough*
Performed an 'upgrade' 2 days ago. Windows moved pretty much everything to the Windows.old folder, so yes, you'll have to reinstall everything. Also, make a backup in case something goes wrong.
Recently upgraded my phone pc to the latest build (don't know if it was a good idea, but I found it is stable enough already and couldn't wait any longer :P). I'm also pretty excited. It's already working pretty well and, of course, it's NEW!!!
Well it's still better than after only 2 hours
Luckily, there's 5GHz. http://m.imgur.com/8CbChw6

"How do you mean, you can't solve the problem on my iPhone? You're the IT guy!"

I can't do anything about the fact that I've switched to Android 5 years ago and haven't touched iOS ever since. These stereotypical assumptions are driving me insane! I may know a lot about computers, but I can't solve every single stupid problem you created!

I really know how you feel man!
Someone's in need for some attention and money again...

There's dozens of them. Reddit doesn't give me enough space to sum up all of them :P
Man I'd root the damn thing and delete all of them
I'd see them putting their own crappy store on it.
Imagine if Telenet or Proximus bloated their phones like that. God, that would be a hell!
There's an unofficial super-alpha version available already. Some modules are working, some don't yet.
I haven't tried it yet, but I'm gonna flash it tonight. See what it'll do to my device.
I was rocking the HTC Hero G2 Touch up until 1.5 years ago when it died. I wasn't that much into rooting back then and it did what I wanted it to do. Even though it was slow as hell, I'll miss that 'curved' design and the trackball.
Well, at least we have CyanogenMod and others
It's still a super-alpha version, so be cautious.
There's this Xposed module called 'YouTube AdAway'. I've been using it for months and it's working flawlessly!
Weird, W10 is working flawlessly on my Pentium D pc
Well, this is an extreme case of "Boy that escalated quickly!" So sorry for you, bro! Hope everything will be alright again.
Well they got as far as booting the V510 stock ROM on the V500 without Wi-Fi, but unfortunately the project was never finished.

Don't we all just read the headline? :P
Well the description says "LGV500_Lollipop_Android_v30a", so I guess we're in luck this time!
Well, 'soon' may be relative for LG, but still. I'm glad LG is still thinking of this tablet and that they are dropping Lollipop for it 'soon'.
Oh, okay :(
Awesome!
The LG G Pad 8.3 is officially supported by CyanogenMod, so you'll get OTA updates, which is really handy.

Link to thread: http://forum.xda-developers.com/lg-g-pad-83/development/rom-official-cyanogenmod-12-t3026647

Steps on how to install are included in the OP.
OmniROM only supports EXT4. I experienced that too when I left some partitions formatted as f2fs, so watch out for that. CM12 only supports f2fs on /data and /cache.
What about the G Pad? Anyone?

Ah nvm, I'll stay on CM12 :P
Well the only issue I've found so far is that video recording isn't working. Your video will just be green. Youtube is working without problems for me, but I watch Youtube mostly on my G Pad.
I recommend you try it. Lollipop 5.1 is so much better than 4.4 and 5.0 in my opinion. However, you will be left without Xposed so far, but I prefer smoothness and stability over features.
One of the reasons why I rooted it and installed a custom ROM after one week. Also, now I can reach further than 4.1.2. 
Weird, my LG G Pad 8.3 has a full HD screen and can go up to 1080p.
To their doom?
Everything is Facebook!
'Cyanogen Inc.' and 'deals' are two things which don't go together pretty well, history tells us.
This makes me feel very happy inside for some reason
I'm dual-booting between Windows 8.1 Pro and Ubuntu 14.10 GNOME. The reason why I don't make a full switch: games. Seriously, there aren't really so many games for Linux, especially not the ones I've bought. There are also other programs which aren't available on Linux or don't have a decent alternative, like Vegas, Photoshop, Audition, etc. It is a great Ok, though, but I'll probably never make the full switch.
The release of Half Life 3?
1) LG G Pad 8.3

2) I bought it for €189 (it was €279, but it was on sale), so I didn't really expect too much of it. God was I wrong! This device is awesome! Beautiful screen, fast device for even the larger tasks, overall great price/quality. I honestly didn't expect it to be such a great device for that price! I'm very proud of it!

3) Still hasn't changed. I'm still very statisfied with this device!

4) Rooted it from day one, flashed TWRP. It only took a week before I switched to a different ROM. The device is officially supported by CyanogenMod and other custom ROMs are also running very smoothly and stable. My device is currently running CM12 at lightning speed! 
Nexus One?

It's running faster than any other Windows version I've installed on this build. Sure, Windows 8 and 8.1 had also given it a huge performance boost, but with 10 it's still slightly better.

It just removes all of the programs and puts Windows system-wise back in the state like when you just had installed it. Personal data in the C:\Users folder doesn't get touched, however.
Can we root it?
Well, there's nothing root can't fix
I'm using PAC 4.4.4 on my S3 mini. It has a motherload of functions and settings, so I don't think there's anything missing. It is also one of the most stable ROMs I've ever used on this device and of course it's waaaaaaaay better than Samsung's stock ROM with its load of useless crapware.

Anyways, of course ROMs are going to stay alive and become even better. One of the things I kinda expect is that some ROMs will maybe 'fix' some of the annoyances in Lollipop, but I'm not too sure. In my opinion, OEMs could still learn a thing or two from these ROM developers and maybe, just maybe, we'll be seeing functions adopted from custom ROMs on stock Samsung/HTC/Huawei/whatever devices, but that's just wishful thinking.

These custom ROMs are only going to become better. No way that they are going to die in the near future.
How about no?
That's one of the reasons why I sold it. It was running great back in the days of iOS 4, but every update after that crippled performance piece by piece.
