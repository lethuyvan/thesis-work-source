My user name means "Traveler"..so i got a very broad range i guess...could be space traveler food...could be desert traveler food..u get the idea.
Explore "Alternate timelines"..For example,one where super man etc. are real,one where animals can talk..one where humanity has FTL travel...one where there are always few enough people who are in a environment friendly but technologically super advanced...

tl;dr:A god of multiple tv shows apparently 
General as in the whole CPRE thing(All levels)?
If you still have warranty,opening the laptop might void it.I think you can describe what you have described here.Depending on your warranty type,maybe you can ask if they can remotely isolate the problem using OEM software somehow...Like built in hardware diagnostics that are into most laptops from the last decade.
Have you checked if anything is stuck or any broken fins on one of the fans inside the laptop?
ALL of the ones i am seeing are almost like the one you see above.Either just age,a single word before,or nothing before the emojis.No other context.Seems to a single line profile description thingy.
The girls posting these are modestly dressed,no suggestive pose or anything remotely considerable as "naughty".The peach,tongue,splash combo may mean something sexual,but what about the splash emoji only?Hot?sweaty?Aroused?
Oh..i See.When i said multiplayer,i was thinking of online multiplayer :-(.
For me,it started with someone pointing out that i always have too many devices.I also happen to not throw away clothes until they are torn.Working on both right now.
As a current software engineering student,what does it mean for devs?I own both iphone and android device,but never intend to use a Mac..
I got the inspiration from here..Might be interesting to explore..:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Ulyssesbucketlist/
I need it for a country chapter of a public university..As i am in Malaysia,i think discord would be unfamiliar to most users.They only know whatsapp,viber,messenger etc..Even telegram is unfamiliar to most of them :-(
I heard they opened e-gpu support via Thunderbolt.Somewhere on linustechtips.
My uni library used to have this.Some still do.
20,000 RFID blocking wallets from ID stronghold..guess i will have to resell
Nope
What the hell is "spam"? As someone from southeast Asia (Bangladesh,now studying in Malaysia), i have never heard of it.
Hmm..looks like there is really a lot i have forgotten.

From your points,looks like being able to use the ancient weapons is a must,being powerful on the level of,say,pirate king, is simply not enough.It can be assumed that without these powers,the celestial dragons cannot be defeated,and that's why they want all 3 weapons so badly i guess.Highly probable and possible =b.

Then again,maybe the celestial dragons already have one ancient weapon..maybe their national treasure.Perhaps we will see it much later on.

I just think there is a high chance that it would be someone we have not met yet.
Did not notice the tsundere first :-D
I have a feeling that we will see the return of all the defeated shichibukai at some point in future..like the ones we saw at marineford.
The HSTS/PKP query shows both reddit and facebook is under FORCE_HTTPS status now.Not seeing suggestion to http on this two now.Will update here if it pops up for any other website.Thanks.
I am trying to build a life as a student with minimum daily expenditure by carrying my water bottle and cooking at home,refueling my car only once a week.And here it makes it sound like u gotta spend money everyday,and go to shopping quite often...sigh..
As a non-american non-native English speaker, can anyone please explain in what situation should a person wear a tie like that? Looks really weird to me.
“Water under the bridge” 😂
Reddit and facebook are the two prominent one..I’ll add to this list when more pops up.
As mentioned in the text,i am already using that extension.

I don't know about tab limiters,but i use something that puts all tabs on a list...It's called onetab.
The converter arrived a week ago.Worked fine with that.Details in new comment.
For anyone seeing this in future,I did not need to buy everything listed on the video (Active VGA to HDMI converter and HDMI box).So,i hooked it up to a tv,disabled hdcp and set the resolution to 720p. 

Then,when i connected to the acer monitor with the active vga to hdmi converter (http://www.11street.my/productdetail/from-usa-techrise-hdmi-to-vga-gold-plated-high-51289387),powered it (the adapter)using a cellphone charger cable,it worked .

First time it showd resolution not supported and the ps4 defaulted to 1080p. When changed to 720p,the monitor failed to detect the ps4 at first,but worked fine after restarting the ps4. My friend have been playing horizon zero dawn on it for a week now,and it is working well.If u r used to seeing it on 1080p,u may see some (minor) vertical shimmering lines at first,but it is hardly noticeable.

My conclusion is that depending on your monitor model.only having an active hdmi to vga converter may suffice.With the TechRise HDMI to VGA, Gold Plated High-Speed 1080P Active HDTV HDMI to VGA adapter Converter mentioned above,it works with both 1080p and 720p monitor.If u have budget,just buy a monitor with hdmi. If u r a student like me and my friend,and are on a budget,u can try this.Good luck to anyone reading this in future.

At that chapter's discussion thread, someone mentioned that in some Chinese forums it was speculated that the sword at that panel was someone else attacking/killing oven,and pound is alive.However,as i understand,these r all speculations at this point.
Solved !
Pretty sure the image is shopped,so i am just curious about what the parts are from.Tasmanian devil seems to be the closest match with the head of the animal.Still looking for the animal that can have a tail that long.

Another from the same car..except for hazard light placement,this matches with Yaris.I am still not sure though :-(

Hmm..that's the name i have been looking for.Thanks.

I just ordered the parts mentioned in the youtube video.Will take about a month to get here.Will try and comment back here if it works.
Got it.I am gonna see where i can report that domain.

Sadly,it does not have the dvi port :-(
Already did..but this is a temporary workaround.I want them gone permanently.
I think i'll probably have to do the later..

This is a shitty mini game,part of an even shittier pay to win game.The publishers of this game have promoted it on earncrypto.Very irritating.
Well,this is supremely disappointing 😡
Good point...Jasmine and Emily...shows how much i have forgotten.Time to leave this sub also,like ME i guess.
Well,after Witcher 3 and MGSV:TPP ended,it felt like my gaming life has peaked..I have been gaming for more than 15 years,but nowadays get bored easily if there is nothing very unique.For example,Doom has glory kills,Shadow of War has nemesis system.In regards to that,dishonored 1 was much more exciting for me.However,i only followed what is inside the game.

On the other hand,only reason i bought dishonored 2 on steam was to try Emily's new powers.The combination of her powers and the sands storms were not as exciting as i thought they would be.I am heavily a story guy,which seemed somewhat lackluster.slogged through the whole thing somehow.In game lores no longer seemed interesting. Didn't even buy DOTO.Or maybe i am getting too old.Who knows.
Interesting...I kind of gave up on further details after the first one coz i did not enjoy the other ones as much.
My opinion is it is possible that he killed only 3 people.

I recall getting clean hands on dishonored 1.Killing indirectly (eg. Granny rags) was not counted for that run. Havelock counts as 1.

For dishonored 2,Paolo is 1 kill for sure(does not count towards nullifying "clean hands" achievement).So,in total,at least 2.

If i go high chaos,30/40 people on a single level can be killed easily.Different calculations there.
I just follow this (https://www.notebookcheck.net/Computer-Games-on-Laptop-Graphics-Cards.13849.0.html) and restrict the models.When i chose this two (R9 280X) and a 1060,the difference did not seem that significant.

For PUBG specifically,you can see that (https://imgur.com/a/S3FJJ) fps diference on ultra is about 9 frames per second (top 1 is nvidia gtx 1060).Going to a desktop 1070 improves (compared to the amd card)almost 28 more fps.However,if u still want to get the 1060,i would suggest the 6 GB version.Many other games,now and in future,would hit that 3 GB mark pretty quickly.If you are buying a card now,you may wanna go for the more future proof route(http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2016-nvidia-geforce-gtx-1060-3gb-vs-6gb-review_6_6_8_6) 
Already checked,but none of them match the exact model number (DY-WL10PP-K)..only says DY-WL10 chipset. Maybe i can give this one (goo.gl/oSWjWC)a try.Thanks.
I am in Malaysia at the moment and the TV was bought here also.Panasonic Malaysia already said this is not available in their stock.Hence the third party thing :-(.
Same here...7 plus 11.1.1
Hmm..my goal is mainly battery saving though.Keeping wifi on may consume less battery than data and hotspot,but it will still cause a significant drain..I am looking for something specific to hotspot only.On that note,If there are any apps that can do this after rooting,i can still consider that.
I have used a rooted android phone before..call recording,getting paid apps for free and skipping micro transactions without paying..i have seen it all done right in front of me.This particular functions have no use for me.Neither is any cosmetic changes.Not into mobile gaming. Cryptocurrency is one,but i am not sure the softwares for it will require jailbraking.In short,I have been unable to find anything else that is a unique advantage of jailbraking for me.

Money does not equal influence...I don't think a single person nowadays can possibly have enough influence to erase the part of the culture that makes donald trump,paris hilton,kim kardashian more popular in any sense.In fact,if money could erase them and their culture from history,i would have done that.

Thanks for the reply,..maybe i can try this later on my alienware,but what about the ipad(ios 9)?That is my current priority question.

also,as a linux user,any particular distro u would suggest?is there any specific advantage of mining on linux?I have an older asus laptop that i might use...that one also out of warranty.


When i return home every year on vacation and see my dad at the airport
ME2,Witcher 3,PoP WW r my top 3,in that order...ME 2 is the best of the 3 in ME series imo...Witcher 3 needs no explanation,but for PoP WW,to this day,there are very few games that i'll remember for both the game and the soundtracks of the game.
AC Brotherhood and AC 2 for tie on 4th,and on 5th,Bioshock Infinite for unique story.I think there will be a long time if anything like these are ever made again....This dlc ridden episodic shits get on my nerves.I have sort of abandoned gaming coz once you have experienced these,uncharted,god of war, the old nfs mw,nothing (except doom)seems to come close these days.
They only have Ron 95,RON 97 and diesel near me,so i use the 95.Thanks for the clarification =b.
Just hang in there man...don't give up like that.
I am curious about the last part?what do you mean by the preps being confiscated?Is there any law against such things?
It was sensor dust apparently.It seems just waiting solved it.Nothing is visible on the Tamron zoom lens and another prime lens.Thanks for the advice.
Thanks.
Bangkok was easy.Used buses and BTS from place to place.Had a friend from KMUTT who gave me the bus numbers for some essential routes.instead of 100/150 baht uber,paid only 7 to 16 baht mostly.
I just splurged on air ticket to phuket from DMK airport.My flight is in a few hours.Lets see if i can last on 1k per day in phuket. Thanks again for giving me the estimate i needed.
 
well well...2 years...2 finishes...and still finding missed convos..bravo.dai,bravo.
wow,i am surprised that they are making more..didn't think it sold that many copies...Dishonored 1 was one of my most favourite games...2,not so much.I have high hopes for DOTO,but thought that would be the end.

No movie or episode of tv series per say,but the one that came closest was shutter island
Got alienware with 5 year pro warranty..had to do unit replacement once and hardware replacement multiple times.It seems at least for Alienware,they can't fix most of the issues and just replace the parts.I think it may be better for other laptops by dell
My Alienware 17 and my power beats(the first one).Paid for them in 2011,still going strong.I have seen very few laptops and earphones around me that lasts that long. 
Interesting point.In addition to that,he intentionally does not appear to many persons,but those cultists carry on with his name.Maybe just hubris of a "god" affecting his actions. 
Well,this comments are exactly what i was looking for.It appears i have missed quite a bit of lore.The wiki's list of persons with outsider's mark is an eye opener i suppose.

I was under the impression that vera moray and delailah are artifact users,like Billie lurk in the trailer.It appears they have the mark.Just not visible in case of delailah.
Out of all the answers,i think yours make the most sense from a neutral standpoint 
Like a steam review,this needs a "funny" tag ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
This is worse than i hoped.I hoped they would at least release the quarian dlc..not scrap all single player dlc altogether....I feel like the era of good single player games is *ALMOST* over for me..PoP,Half life,Uncharted,Bioshock,Witcher,RE,Dead Space,Hitman..and now mass effect.RIP.
sold my proton and got a nissan...pretty happy about it.

Based on this review,i don't like the overall condition of these laptops.Also,i don't know how sturdy those bottom flaps are.I am used to my Alienware for 6 years..It has fallen face first, bottom first and sideways without any major damage.The zephyrus looks flimsier.As mentioned in the review,i think i have to wait for the 2nd generation of max-q.



I would say i want to feel how it is like to be independent and see how much worse this shit can get...Somebody once mentioned on imgur/reddit that "you hate life so much that you want to take revenge on life itself"..i am still dependent on my family.
Hmm..That crossed my mind also,however,i was under the impression that all such places that have such high number of supercars are covered by auto speedcams..here in Malaysia,there are many blind spots on highways that have speedcam sign,but no actual speedcam. I suppose,unlike i thought previously, the same maybe true for many other countries.

Hmm..i usually play rouge or infiltrator or sniper types...I am more of a damage dealer than a team buff i suppose...good luck on your journey :-D
Well,i have always been myself on social media...After almost 9 years,i am not much further from where i started.
ask on r/travel or see if there is anything like askGermany maybe..
Not exactly like that,but if you want to ask anything specific,maybe try https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/

Also,last time i visited Singapore, i asked on r/askSingapore...Maybe if you plan to visit a specific country,see if they have something similar.

On another note,most of these subreddits do not prefer question that ask for common infos that you can find on first page of google.Personally,i use tripadvisor to find attractions and interesting places before visiting
As far as i know,that's for trucks..i would imagine luffy being more of a super car :-)
Instead of gear 5th,i imagine this is as top gear :-D
It still boggles my mind.How on earth did a single javelin kill a dragon?Was there any explanation about this?magic?
No.Mainly just precaution.These are both USB 3 portable HDDs.Never used a portable drive this long before,and one of my external 2 TB from WD died only on 3 years.From other threads and your comment,it seems i am good for quite some time yet.Thanks.
> Dell,Alienware and Asus as far as i have seen...There maybe others


Actually,this is my first time hearing that...over last 12 years on pc and ps3..so dunno what to make of that..I guess you already got your answer on the above posts.
Hmm...the first one was given in chinese new year festival at my uni,so maybe that's why.The second image's symbols are closer to the pronunciation of my name in english(zishan)...as marked below by the translator bot.I think the person wrote it that way as there are no direct Mandarin/Cantonese equivalent of pronunciation of my name.Thank you for your explanation.

Hello guys,
I have a razor Tiamat 7.1 surround sound headset.I use it with a laptop and  want to buy an external usb sound card.Razor recommended a vantec usb sound card(https://vantecusa.com/products_detail.php?p_id=155&p_name=USB#tab-1).As my headphone has 5 3.5 mm jacks( as seen on this demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YTubozx3zs), i am confused as to where the microphone inputs are supposed to go on this card.I have not bought the card yet because of this reason.Please advise if this headphone will work with this sound card along with the microphone,as i'll be using it for multiplayer.

Also,if this place is not appropriate for this question,please advise where i should post it.Thank you for your time.


Just google got season 7 solarmovie
1.COD should go multiplayer only...campaign has been shitty for a long time.Usually it is too short.
2.No,putting "x" star in story does NOT make it awesome.
3.Have been playing since MW2...new ones seems to lack innovation direly.
I would ask "What happened in the void century?"
Thank you guys for the prompt reply :-)
I don't expect origins to surpass tw3 story wise. 
As an avid fan of both Assassin's Creed and Witcher series, I like the witcher series a LOT more.TW3 has the best ending,and two of the best DLCs i have ever played in my whole life. AC2 and brotherhood were two of the best games i have played when they were released.If AC origins reaches at least that level,depending on what else is released,my expectation is, it will be a good GOTY contender, but not a winner.
The guy is in Malaysia.He is only able to buy from this particular website,which is a re seller of DJI
This is enough for driving.I'll take the car to the dealership. Thanks a lot :-)
In case of youtube and some google sites,please check if your provider have local caching...A lot of providers do.If your provider does not,then youtube wil buffer v=comparatively slower.In my country,the ISPs that has google caching provide about 4 times the regular speed on google sites. 
I have had the same issue with whatsapp...In mycase, wifi has jitters and sometimes high ping...On good wifi,it woks fine

Maybe some part of Edward...disappointing family...still continuing on a journey..away from home....neglecting loved ones....with a republic quickly going to shit...

By the same logic,The Shepard trilogy is influenced by Advent rising...uplifting humans and such,while facing a powerful opponent...Humans have "untapped mystical power"..on me,humans get biotics..in both cases,the semblance seems pretty weak
http://www.ign.com/wikis/assassins-creed-3/Johnson%27s_Errand this one?Seems weird,coz i didn't find any trouble during this one..
Late 20s..started manga and anime 9 years ago
Well, I disassembled it today.The sticks on both side of the wheel are actually non metal.I found that one side has some erosion to it, and suspect that's why it does not fit hexagonal hole next to it anymore. I think this is the reason why the up and down scroll function does not work.As mentioned before, middle wheel click works fine. 

My conclusion is, like products from razor and some other companies, this was designed to fail after certain period.The part I mentioned could easily have been made of metal.I have seen this same tactic in children's toys when I was a kid.Didn't expect to see this type of design from corsair.I think I'll add them to my shit list, after Alienware and razer :-(. 
the mass effect wiki mentions "Cerberus attempted to take over the Shadow Broker operations prior to the Reaper invasion of 2186"...that seems counter intuitive for the illusive man,if they were working together for Andromeda initiative.Another issue is,we know that he was indoctrinated.Seemed like early in reaper invasion.Asmentioned by the poster,he is also a xenophobe.

Kumun shol,the volus billionaire mentioned,had been throwing money at a bottomless pit of a toxic planet (Klencory) for two decades,as per the wiki.Only the cockpit of a trading vessel was found..this person seems to be lacking the finesse of the benefactor.About the same likelihood as Shaeera,the Asari consort.

with Liara,there are two problems.one is,if liara is the benefactor,why would there be a shakedown message from the shadow broker?Liara already knew Alec.Second is timeline.

Another issue is,the council races didn't know about reapers until Shepard..but the benefactor did.I am hoping the benefactor is someone new.I am also wondering why every time the benefactor's voice is female.maybe just intentional misdirect.
Was looking for dialogue differences mainly..like what /u/Sway4829 said.
Didn't try the satay,but the other ones worked out...thanks a lot :-)
If there were options to kick out squadmates,i would have kicked him out.His personatily type is the one i hate most irl...i don't need it in a video game :-|
I googled Singapore travel..will have loads of segway and things to talk about i guess.
Hmm...gonna focus on multiplayer until single player dlc then..

TLDR- Lot of unnecessary fillers...Everything except the randomly generated additional tasks can be finished in 40 hours,if not bugged.

Including keeping it running on the background and forgetting to shut it off during class or sleep,i have totaled about 90 hours..Still stuck at 98% coz of bugs...I wasted a lot of hours on bugged missions...scanning random lookouts for additional tasks and planet hopping coz of intentionally scattered mission items wastes the bulk of the time.
Hmm...any links on that?
I have spent 990 hours on ME3 in total..almost all of it on MP.Was in the top 1% on pc for a while..last played 2 years ago.gotta say i still miss it :-(...too bad i can't get it this month...i'll probably join you guys next month.
Mainly because this 2 r the only ones that i play with friends.I used to play all kind of games...many of them got copies of games from me...When i decided to quit,i deleted all 650 GB of it.I have quit the others, they have not.In retrospect, i should delete both today.I think i'll start hitting the gym instead.have finals this week.So being busy should not be a prob.
Try downgrading from your native resolution.I think jorgp2 means as u have 4k monitor,your native resolution is likely 4k,which results in everything looking this small.

For example,i have fullHD display.So native resolution is 1920x1080...if i use 1280x720,the icons and everything looks a bit bigger.

Maybe u can change resolution one stwp at a time and see if that resolves the issue.
Yes.That's the only function i use it for.But it's very cpu intensive.You have to use corelasso or similar things to limit it to fewer cores.There are occasional crashes tjough.As far as i know,the crashes are limited to windows 10 because of few bugs related to x265 itself.
Just size shrinkage.Currently i have 2 WD 2 TB HDDs....I am thinking of downgrading to one 3 TB/4TB (when they become available).Got a lot of .mov videos,documentaries, youtube videos etc.

Target is my laptop and mobile. Using MX player for android.Laptop is Alienware from 2013..so no issues on either end.
Thanks...Any idea on which one is less compromising in quality?
MP4 to mkv
x264 to x265..

I was talking about this setting...have you increased text and icon size from this menu?
If no,give it a try...
If yes,then sorry,apart from video driver, i am not sure what can cause this..
Have you tried increasing icon and other size from customizing display option?It's under the display option.Not sure this is gonna help though.You might update your video driver software to latest version first.(fyi,running 2013 Alienware 17 with win 10).
I just use IDM with chrome...On the other hand,with firefox,i use a browser extension called fvd downloader...
