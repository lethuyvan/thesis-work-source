I love my local credit union compared to big banks. I switched from BMO Harris and have saved a lot in fees:
THIS!! I worked in a tax office and we got so many calls about people getting calls or emails from the “IRS.” The ONLY way the IRS is ever going to contact you is going to be a letter in the mail. Everything else is a scam.
YUM!!! Thank you for this recipe!! My cat and I will appreciate it :)
She had 600 calories is that too many for a small cat?
Definitely a Roma. On sale 5 for $11 at Festival Foods
We named her Rey :) she’s 7 weeks old today!
Was unable to finish my half
Was handed this after I asked if I could have some
This made me think of doing this at my pool... the joy it would bring....
Oh shit I can’t move to Ohio and I don’t have $100 cash. Rip.

I did just send my resume and cover letter to a radio station for a position they had out. Wish me luck!
Same.. like... literally 20 minutes ago
This is helpful thanks. Unfortunately, I currently can not pass a drug test (my sister’s birthday was a few weeks ago, give me another week or two and I can) and I’m weak as fuck so physical labor is way out of my department. I haven’t heard of Cedar Point. But I will look into it. A few jobs in the area (from what I’ve seen on Indeed) have at least an administrative degree as a requirement but I’m sure there’s some out there that don’t (like my current job). I will also look into a temp agency. Thank you
Thanks
Yes I’m depressed. I literally stopped eating for few months  a while so I could fucking pay mmy bills. It not that I’m stubborn, I’m just trying to build my fucking resume so I can get a really good fucking job later in life.

I lost my tax-time hours and I still have another job so it’s not like I’m actively looking for a job. I don’t NEED one because I can always work more hours there. HOWEVER, I am starting to look for jobs in my field and not bullshit jobs because I’ve worked my ass off in those and gotten nowhere.

I come from a poor fucking family where I didn’t even get my first fucking smartphone until college. My parents are still paying off my hospital stay from when I attempted suicide AND my mom’s cancer bills. So no, I CANT ask my parents for money because they’re fucking broke too.

It’s not that I can’t use a budget, it’s I WONT because I fucking hate them and they don’t work for me!!!!!!!!

Yes I took him off bc his job doesn’t meet he requirements so he fucked me over on food stamps. I’m paying all our fucking bills like electric, internet, credit card, and I’m helping HIM pay for rent sometimes.

I came here for advice, not to be shit on by an internet stranger who’s treating me like a baby.
True, but I generally try to avoid food service at all costs from previous experience. It just sucked so bad and kind of ruined all food places for me. I still respect the hell out of wait staff and food service people. So tough tbh.
Yeah a different pool I used to work at did cash, but the Y has a specific lesson agenda we teach and we get paid weird wages. It’s really annoying. We just FINALLY changed our pay date from semi-monthly to bi-weekly and it REALLY helped. Even getting $85 every 2 weeks instead of every 15-17 days is so much better
I live in Wisconsin and there’s one really big chain that’s booming right now and if I could get in, it would be amazing. There’s jobs around here that require at least a technical degree, and I’m 3 credits short of mine :/ i have 3 precious years of experience at a university but that isn’t a degree since I didn’t finish my gen eds there. I really fucked myself over in college. Hence why I’m here looking for help.
The things I would do to get that many reese’s candies in my house...
I’m not a tax preparer. I didn’t go to school for accounting. I’m a front office staff, so lots of clerical work and data entry. My resume is pretty great. I’ve been going to school for 4 years and will be graduating in April of 2019 in an administrative field.
Both of us are in the same boat, plus he has union dues now too. UPS says he should have 3.5 hours a day but it really varies
Was looking at bar tending but decided against it since I am super antisocial and bad with face-to-face
I hate budgeting. It sounds terrible but it doesn’t work. We don’t make a fixed income so it’s hard to really make a budget. I know I should but I’ve tried everything: apps, spending logs, online banking.. it’s just hard 
I reported a change to take my boyfriend out of my household so it’s just me paying for food. Hopefully it’ll help so it looks like I’m paying al our rent and bills, plus now I need to pay for food. The process to report changes takes FOREVER and it’s so time consuming. Plus employers only do the verification form once.
No you’re right on!! It’s exactly what it sounds like. It’s through the YMCA so lots of little kids. I have done private lessons but it’s all on my paycheck so waiting every 2 weeks to get those $40 sucks :/
I have taught swim lessons for 5 years now, and unfortunately it’s getting tiring. I also lifeguard but the wages are less. I’m not a swim team coach so it’s a bit harder to coach compared to teaching. It’s really fun but just not supportive enough to live on
They called me once to set up an interview, even though I had never even signed up. It was weird and spooky.
The fact that they didn’t use an already drank soda is silky
I wish i could spend even $1000 on a bill... I’m lucky if I can reach $50 each for 3 CC bills each month... 
I’m certain that my cat is part Turkish Van and she looks just as graceful and beautiful as this!! Love their tails!!!
She’s just a good kit and brings people smiles 
She looks like mine!! Also, you were blessed with a good fluffy tummy 
Well I learned something new today
This is my first time posting on this sub wyd to me
I was raised very Christian and my parents didn’t give me one. I learned everything through a ~wonderful~ public school health education when I was 10, then again when I was 13. And then I watched porn.
I did recently actually. I’m so nervous to reset it. The last time I had to reset something was with my iPod Nano 😐
It’s the first time it’s happened to me I’m kind of upset because my old 6 would do this a LOT
There’s a lot of villages and townships down where I’m talking about. There’s a few unincorporated areas too. It’s cute and quiet but annoying because I had to drive 20 miles for McDonalds and 30 for Culver’s/Walmart.
I’ve been in bars when I was 19 lol this is wrong. 
It’s only top at bars per capita. 99% sure La Crosse can out drink anyone.
The person definitely can be between 18-21. It would be dumb to fuck over people aged 19 and 20.  My brother was a bartender and would serve people who came back from their first 1-2 years of college if they had their parents.
This is super common in southwest Wisconsin (source: lived there) where there are towns of less than 1000 people and everyone knows everyone.
In Weeds, Josh is also gay. S1E1 I think. Moved to Chicago, found Ian and hooked him up with his dad. Lol.
It’s an autocorrect and idk why it isn’t working ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ redddit doesn’t show the \
I wouldn’t post here if I was sober ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
DRUNK PEOPLE CAN DO ANYTHING TJEY WANT BOO
I love your opinion ♥️
I have not gotten hit on thank goodness I think the bf would be mad
Edit: am drunk and in a bar for this pic
I got a lot of calls wondering if people should pay their property tax before 2018 started. I’m not a tax preparer obviously but that’s kind of what I got from what I overheard.
As someone who works at a tax/accounting firm, I would say yes. You get many more benefits and can find credits and carryovers from the 2016 tax year if you do it professionally, and with the tax reform, it’ll make everything easier for property taxes. As for your wife, you can file as married but filing separate with your accountant and they won’t be connected.
With everything you have going on tax wise, definitely go professional. It will take a huge load off your back and you won’t have to worry.
He’s a better rescuer than most lifeguards at my pool. 10/10 would hire.
I love how my bf holds me and shows his appreciation to me physically by sensual touches and small kisses. His attraction to me is attractive to me.
Some days I’ll charge my phone if it goes below 50%, other days (like today) I keep it unplugged overnight even though it’s at 45%. I just say screw it because upgrading every 1 1/2-2 years sounds good to me.
Whenever I got low on that was my go-to. So good.
I would use these so much!!!
Officially adding that to my to do list from now on!!
I use stickers because I am not the best artist but it’s so much easier for me! Thank you 😊
My ex called me crazy and psycho because I wanted to talk to him and hang out with him. He broke up with me because he “loved me” and “wanted the best for me.” Turns our he told his friends I was psycho and that they should have sex with me because he said I “fuck like a pornstar” and was a complete slut. Haven’t talked to him in over 2 years. Don’t plan to.
I had the iOS 11 beta and it was predicting texts on my old iPhone 6. Now I have an 8 and it seems to have stopped, but I didn’t update it recently.
That’s the best. Drink more so you get more drunk
Sorry drunk there’s too manytypos
DOMINOESSSSSS
I love vodka and cherries and coke so I’m completely happy
Get drunk, get a fishbowl, go home to bf and bang him good 😍
I can attest that YMCA pools are exactly like this
Routine and shampoo/conditioner changed

Wash and condition with Biolage Uplift shampoo and conditioner. While my conditioner is in, I brush through it with my tangle teezer since I have really gnarly hair. Once that’s almost all rinsed out and I’m done showering, I put Pravana Hydra Pearl oil and DevaCurl Ultimate Defining Gel in and plop for 20 minutes. I only scrunch the bottoms and roots
You are an amazing friend. Keep it up 👍🏻👍🏻
Thank you. Everyone reacts to trauma differently and she reacted to hers appropriately. Thank you for being a safe place for her. Other people out here with PTSD appreciate you.
We aren’t talking about soldiers in this story. The girl obviously has trauma that she’s still dealing with and it’s totally valid for her to feel this way. OP showing his support for her is way better than telling assault victims that their trauma isn’t real and that it’s being weak.
Some people may do that, but we can’t ignore the fact that people still have it for real. It could be from any sort of trauma, be it combat, sexual assault, or death. It’s not fair to only say certain people can or can’t experience it. Anyone can experience trauma and like I said, we all react differently. PTSD can co-exist with other conditions, and from personal experience, the PTSD makes those conditions spiral out of control. People like that aren’t weak minded, we’ve just been through things that others haven’t experienced.
Everyone experiences trauma differently and it’s not cool to see people as weak if they have a mental condition. It’s all chemicals.
I’ve recently been using a sample size of Biolage’s uplift shampoo and conditioner. It’s wonderful and has given my hair volume where I need it most. My hair used to do the same thing but after a couple washes, the curls are beginning at the top! I also shake my hair out upside down after my shower and follow up with plopping for about 20 minutes.
I love Renpure Argan oil shampoo and conditioner set. I use it every few days and my hair loves it.
I don’t really have a set in stone routine because I keep my hair up a lot at work (I’m a lifeguard/swim instructor), but it kind of goes something like this:

Wash and condition with Ren Pure Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner. Its my favorite right now because it’s cheap and smells good, plus it’s labeled as a no-poo! I have yet to go through the ingredient list. While my conditioner is in, I brush through it with my tangle teezer since I have really gnarly hair. Once that’s rinsed out, I put it in a t-shirt for about 20 minutes (sometimes I do my makeup during this time). After I take it out, I put in Pravana Hydra Pearl replenishing oil and DevaCurl Ultra Defining Gel, followed by scrunching the curls with the T-shirt. Then I air dry.

I started to sleep in a satin sleep cap to keep the curls and it worked! I followed up today by spritzing DevaCurl Mister Right spray. I love it!!!
Your hair is beautiful!! It reminds me of my mom’s red curls before she went into chemo.

Also I love Birchbox and all their products!
