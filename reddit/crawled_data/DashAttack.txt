Precisely. Good fences make good neighbors and all that.
worth it tbh
I just got a bag of the Kanzu. At first I thought I'd made a huge mistake, as I brewed it how I normally do on a V60 and it came out flimsy and very watery. Upped the ratio to 1:15 for the first time in a long time (from the usual 1:16) and ground a bit finer, and voilà - a perfect brew with balanced acidity and no hints of astringency, the best I've had out of a V60 in quite a while.

Hey yeah so this is the part that I'm not super clear on. Does "Not eligible for Kickback" refer to the free 4th line only, or to the entire deal? I guess it would help if someone could provide an actual data point.
I mean you can, but the entire reason you're being summoned is to give your company a chance to show that it is cooperating in good faith with government regulators. You answering the questions truthfully makes everything easier for both sides: your company gets a smaller fine and is allowed to continue to self-regulate your company's conduct without the FTC constantly looking over your shoulder, and the FTC doesn't have to spend a shitload of time and money on subpoenas. If you refuse to cooperate, you're just opening up your company to a much harsher stance from regulatory bodies.

I don't know how people can deny the screen issues to this day. It's not just the blue shift (tbh this doesn't even bother me that much), but also the very noticeable coloration, graininess, and black crush. I bought two Pixel 2 XLs and both had all of the issues above to varying degrees. I must emphasize: the screen issues were very easily noticeable compared to any reasonably good screen (6P, OG Pixels, recent Samsungs, any iPhone). I ended up returning both and buying a used OG XL, which has a much better screen.

Lately I've been having bootloop issues with that phone too, so I'm now planning on getting the S9+. If the drawbacks of that phone aren't dealbreakers for you, it's what I'd recommend at this point since you want a bigger phone than the Pixel 2 non-XL. Otherwise if you want the full Google experience, you might just want to wait 7 months for the Pixel 3 XL. Either way, I wouldn't recommend the 2 XL in its current state.

$12k in lessons for two kids is not excessive. Pretty sure my parents spent more than that, and we didn't live in NYC. By the time I was in high school my music lessons alone cost $100/hour once a week, let alone sports and tutoring. Neither is $10k in clothes for 4 people - that's like $300/parent per month and $100/kid, and you need to factor in the fact that the parents are lawyers and the kids are young and growing. Sure, they can definitely cut expenses pretty much everywhere, but honestly, this level of spending is within the bounds of what's considered normal for high-earning urban professionals, and I don't see it becoming a problem for them in the future. As someone else pointed out, the childcare costs, lessons, and some of the food expenses will be wiped out once the kids leave for college (of course, tuition is another matter entirely). And by then it's not unreasonable to think that one or both parents will have made partner and will be pulling in far more than their current $250k. That coupled with their home investment and 401k contributions *should* mean that a comfy retirement won't be an issue.

That was hard to watch. You can tell neither player really feels comfortable with the game yet, with some weak Hellzone mix-ups and day-one combo routes from Dora. Tbqh+ most of the top 8 matches at the most recent NLBC were better than this. Dora ought to take notes from HookGangGod's Piccolo.

I guess Kyamei looked slightly better here, but so far Japan in general is looking to be free as fuck if they show up at FR. Hopefully GO1 has been doing his homework or he'll just get bodied by our blue furry boi.

##East Village

**Abraço** *(Self-roasted)* - New York's best cappuccino IMO. I've never tried their pourovers, but their espresso drinks are excellent and very different from NYC's third wave shops.

**Hi-Collar** *(Various roasters)* - These guys do Japanese siphon brew. It's very expensive, but worth checking out if you've never had it before. They have limited seating and you'll have to get there before 5 pm - this shop transforms into a sake bar at night.

**Ninth Street Espresso** *(Self-roasted)* - Be sure to go to the original location on 9th St and Ave C or the nearby shop on 10th St and Ave B. The other locations are hit-or-miss.

##Upper West Side

**Box Kite** *(Various roasters)* - Generally lauded as one of the best shops in the city.

##Midtown East

**Little Collins** *(Counter Culture)* - Not sure why you'd find yourself in this area, but if you do, this Aussie shop does great espresso drinks consistently - I go here a couple times a week since I work in the area, and they've never pulled a bad shot.

##Soho

**Everyman Espresso** *(Counter Culture)* - Easily the best shop in Soho, and a great place to stop by on a shopping trip. If you buy beans from them, they'll also give you a free drip coffee (in the past I've also asked them to just apply a $2 discount toward an espresso drink, which was nice of them). Don't go to the Union Square location.

##FiDi

**Black Fox** *(Various roasters)* - Fantastic and consistent if you find yourself in the area.

**Voyager Espresso** *(La Cabra, Denmark)* - Also supposed to be great, though I've never been myself.

##Brooklyn

####Williamsburg

**Devocion** *(Self-roasted)* - This cafe is downright beautiful and worth a visit for the decor alone. The coffee is good too, but perhaps not quite on the same level as some other shops listed here.

####East Williamsburg/Bushwick

There are a ton of great coffee shops between Williamsburg and Bushwick. Here are a few:

**City of Saints** *(Self-roasted)* - Also has a location in the East Village near Astor Place.

**Sey Coffee** *(Self-roasted)* - Probably the biggest standout in Brooklyn, and a recent NYC darling roaster.

**Variety** *(Self-roasted)* - Also has a location in Chelsea.

####Honestly IDK What Neighborhood This Is

**Parlor Coffee** *(Self-roasted)* - Only open to the public on Sundays from 10 am - 2 pm, these guys spend the rest of their time roasting some of NYC's finest beans.

---

This is by no means an exhaustive list, just a few selections out of the shops that I've been to/been meaning to go to in New York. If I had to pick 5 shops and distance were no object, I would visit **Abraço**, **Box Kite**, **Black Fox**, **Sey**, and **Hi-Collar**.  Note that I've left out some of the bigger chains like Blue Bottle (good), Stumptown/La Colombe/Fika/Cafe Grumpy/Bluestone Lane (decent), and Gregory's/Toby's Estate/Think/Irving Farm (okay) since you can either find them elsewhere or get coffee just as good in any other city.

Ah, I see you're into meager bodies as well

I mean they are definitely small, some combos need to be adjusted against them compared to, say, Trunks. What do you consider a small character then? T.Gohan/K.Buu/Krillin?
You're the best. Can you confirm if it works on small characters (Vegeta, A18, etc.) as well?
Yeah, I left out the startup in BB since it's a little harder to distinguish visually. But in DBFZ the green flash happens on frame 1 IIRC, and so you have a full ~20f to reactively break the throw after the visual indicator. Option selects aside, it is much easier to break throws in this game.
[o shit waddup](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/023/397/C-658VsXoAo3ovC.jpg)
The sad thing is it'll never happen with Bamco at the wheel. Hope I eat my words, but unless a company like ELEAGUE, DreamHack, or ESL picks it up I'm afraid it'll end up playing second fiddle to SFV at the top level. Why would any Duty Fighter pros switch over when there's no prize support? In this day and age of sponsored players playing a single game for a living, "it's hype af" isn't a good enough reason to spend time learning another game.
Don't mash, time it at the apex of the flip.
Sweet, I'mma try this when I get home. I think this is the optimized version of the combo that ChrisG has been using. Will update the spreadsheet if it works.
It's been one month. Except for bugfixes, I'd be happy if they waited until the end of the year before touching anything. 16's 5H is bullshit but he's no Abigail. Vegeta's assist is great but the character himself is the most honest man in DBFZ. And because of strong universal mechanics like vanish, reflect, and 2H, every character is viable (granted not all 2H's are created equal, and it'd be nice if they addressed Krillin's hitboxes at some point). As we saw at Winter Brawl this weekend and Tokaigi a few weeks ago, even top players are clearly still in the early stages of figuring out the game. ChrisG isn't snapping in weak characters enough and SonicFox just realized the usage scenario for lvl 1 sparking two days ago. A lot of combos are being left unoptimized, a lot of mistakes aren't being capitalized on, and new blockstrings, frametraps, and mixups are still being created every day. Hell we don't even have the full frame data yet. So let's all chill for a hot minute and learn together.
Throws are like 20f in this game, easily reactable especially if you're looking for it. Compare this to BlazBlue where throws have either a 15f throw break window (considered breakable on reaction) or a 27f window (almost a guaranteed break).
It's not even that, it's really just swarming with casual-only players who have never even touched ranked. I've also been a part of many gaming communities and this one is by far the most casual.  I swear every time I get into an argument with someone about gameplay/operator balance the first thing they say is "Yeah well I only play casual, I guess it might be different in ranked." Compare this to the CSGO subreddit where the vast majority of posters/commenters play only ranked (or even use a third party client for matchmaking) and you can see why this place is full of fanart, memes, and low effort highlights. At this point it's gotten even worse than the Overwatch subreddit.
Watch the NLBC post-finals interviews, then you'll understand.
It's great that it works for you, but honestly for a lot of people that's an unacceptable solution and almost defeats the purpose of having a smartphone. It's 2018, Android is nearly 10 years old and still battery life is an unsolved problem.
I hope this becomes the new Justin Wong lmao

Current commentators are doing a great job though, keep it up zerk/esteban
I don't really think people disliked it for that reason tbh. I'll refrain from saying more since you're still watching, but personally I was just disappointed with the show. Except for the visuals, almost everything about it could have been done better. Expected more from KyoAni.

Ibuki is that you?
Good shit /u/raoh, keep it up. If I might make a small suggestion, having a separate label for "tourny" might be a better descriptor than "local" for some of these events, since "local" generally connotes a small local tournament run weekly or monthly. I get what you were going for with the LAN vs. online thing, but for big events like Winter Brawl and Final Round (which is considered a major for some games), I think it would be helpful to have another label, or even just replace "local" with "tourny" or something similar.

This is the key. Coffee and tea are different enough in their preparation and consumption that moderating each subreddit requires an idiosyncratic approach, as ridiculous as that sounds. Kudos to the mod team for recognizing that.
It can definitely hurt. Read up on Tommy Hilfiger's rise (and subsequent fall) due to its close connection with rap. Once a brand gets picked up and left behind by the changing tides of pop culture, it can be really difficult for it to disentangle itself from that image. Gucci's core customers don't want to be associated with rap culture. So rappers constantly talking about Gucci directly hurts the brand - by being associated with the hip-hop community, all of a sudden you start to see a new group of customers emerge and start to represent the brand in a very loud and obnoxious way. This is good in the short term, but luxury brands know that the hypebeasts won't stay, they'll just hop onto the next flavor-of-the-month bandwagon brand that Kanye name drops on his next track, and in the meantime they're permanently driving away the core customers who don't want to be associated with rap. That's why most traditional luxury brands prefer to stay out of the fickle hip-hop limelight, and it's why they mostly cater to a more stable "old money" customer base.
So many top players play 16...

**Key points:**

On meter usage and team strategy (thanks /u/Azreal_DNT!):

>Chris G has a very interesting approach to meter and tag use. He almost never uses meter for anything other than Vanish.

>He also has a very clear goal in mind with his team comp. Trunks for solid neutral with Vegeta with 5LLL + Assist crossup, lots of air movement while looking for an opening. He uses 18 exclusively as a battery. He also tags in Vegeta just to take hits knowing he'll swap out and recover. Very interesting.

On blocking:

- being stuck in blockstun sucks, like in most anime fighters
- when combined with staggered pressure, it's very difficult to know when to take your turn

On Vegeta:

- Vegeta is a solid all-rounder, similar to Ryu in SF
- not great for damage, but his neutral is good enough
- lockdown assist is strong in general, and very strong for mixups with his team comp

On SonicFox:

- disagrees that you don't need an assist in this game, unless you just want to okizeme people to death
- "I do want to play neutral, he wants to remove *your* neutral" (unsurprising given his Marvel playstyle)

When's volleybahl
To paraphrase my [own comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/dbfz/comments/7v6vh0/combo_spreadsheet/dtq74qs/), j.MLL is generally better, but not by too much (30 damage in the "universal" BnB referred to in the linked comment). The reason why it's better for spacing is that for (almost?) all characters j.M reaches further than j.L, so you can bail on the LL part of j.MLL if you think it won't hit and change to a different combo route like j.2H or j.H depending on how far away you are from your opponent. (Note that this requires you to be adjusting on the fly and not in autopilot dial-a-combo mode.) So in most BnBs it's usually preferred but definitely not universally better, for instance in one of Cell's corner loops you cannot replace j.LML with j.MLL because the timing is very tight and j.M has slower startup than j.L.
This is only when starting an air string with L.
Sweet, I didn't think this comboed. I'm the one who contributed the Vegeta BnBs and I'd be happy to update the sheet with your version once I get home to test it.
Not sure what you mean by this. Jump cancels are always done using normal jumps unless otherwise specified (e.g., 5M > sj.H denotes a super jump cancel).
Startup on this move is like a year and a half tho
Some more Vegeta/Goku Black stuff. Full confirms off of fireball (236S) at any range:

* **Vegeta:** 236S (16 hits) > Vanish > dash > 2M > 5M > j.LL > j.2H > dj.LL > 214M **[2775]**
    * 1 bar
    * No HK
    * Also works with j.236S starter if spaced correctly
    * Can follow up with some assist supers (e.g., A18), but Vegeta's own supers won't come out in time
    * Vanish timing is pretty lenient, you can do it any time while Vegeta is throwing fireballs but for maximum damage you should wait until he finishes all 16 hits
* **Goku Black:** 236S (5 hits) > Vanish > dash > 2M > 5M > j.MLL > j.2H > dj.LLL **[2805]**
    * 1 bar
    * No HK
    * Vanish timing is a bit tighter here, and you'll really want to squeeze out all 5 hits as each hit after the first one does 209 damage
    * I don't think you can follow this up with any supers, but I've only tried with Vegeta and A18
* **Goku Black:** 236S (5 hits) > Vanish > dash > 2M > 5M > j.MLL > j.2H > dj.LL > Holy Light Grenade (236H+S) **[3500]**
    * 2 bars 
    * Don't use the other lvl 1 super -- it does less in this combo
Sweet, thanks for sharing. And yeah, j.2H loses its launching properties after the first use of a launcher in a combo, after which it becomes jump cancelable for most characters (A18 is a notable exception).
For Vegeta BnB:

2M > 5M > j.MLL > j.2H > SD > j.MLL > j.2H > dj.LL > j.214M (4195, HK)

Can followup with:

* > (land) > 1-Super
* > (land) > 3-Super

Notes:

* dj.LL refers to the air light autocombo, use this instead of j.LMH for the autocorrect height adjustment.
* Goku Black and most other "normal" characters can use the same BnB replacing the final j.214M with the last hit of j.L air autocombo for 4185 and a hard knockdown.
* From what I've tested the second j.MLL (after the superdash) can be replaced by j.LML for 0 damage reduction if you find that easier. But the first j.MLL should be kept in for scaling (using j.LML here nets you 30 less damage) and spacing (for many characters, j.M reaches further than j.L, and you can input j.M > j.2H on reaction if you think the lights in j.MLL won't reach).
That sparking didn't last long at all lmao. Lvl 3 sparking lasts 21 seconds, this was 7 seconds so it was in fact lvl 1 as OP claims. And each assist is used only once so it's a perfectly real combo.
I actually forgot about TK lol. It's just kind of weird to make the distinction when the motion is neither of the two, and (I'm assuming) the move has some startup invincibility, like how Cammy's Cannon Spike is usually called a DP. If it's not actually invincible then I guess tiger knee makes more sense.

Well said.
It's sarcastic. He bought 10 capsules and got 10 Z coins, which are given when the item you would have gotten is a duplicate of something you already have. You can then trade in 10 Z coins for 1 guaranteed non-duplicate item. Basically, he got really unlucky (10 duplicates out of 10 rolls), and "spent 10,000 Zeni to get 1 item".
The point of 2L > 5L as a combo starter isn't to add damage, it's to demonstrate a full confirm off of lights. Of course it's not going to be "optimal" if you compare it to a slower, higher damage combo starter.
Nah Q goes by G now
You can combo into it though, from either 5M or 2M I forgot. And his lvl 3 does far more damage than most other lvl 3s, so you're not losing as much by skipping the aerial portion of a combo.

[Shit](https://i.imgur.com/CSN3iIm.jpg) [tier](http://hibachicandy.tumblr.com/post/89143280387/hibachifinal-s-arcade-stick-tier-list) but a good find for $10. Old Hori parts are awful (I had a Hori EX2 with the same shitty internals) and the stick is hard to mod but it is doable. I was able to replace the buttons with Sanwas but it was a huge pain in the ass and involved manually filing down the metal faceplate to make the buttons fit. Replacing the lever requires more work and is probably not worth the effort.
I used to do that too, and I'll concede that it's a good way to start out developing your tastes. But it gets expensive fast and you really are just better off buying the whole bag and making 20x the coffee for 4x the cost. (Plus, most baristas suck at pourovers.) Eventually I realized that it doesn't really matter what origin you buy, if it's been selected by a buyer worth his salt and roasted competently, it'll taste good. It doesn't matter so much that a good Ethiopian tastes different from a good Nicaraguan. You can appreciate both kinds of "good" as long as they're brewed well.
New York and Boston do coffee better than San Francisco. With the exception of St. Frank's, I was disappointed by every shop I visited in SF (Sightglass, Four Barrel, Ritual, Mazarine).

It is pointless to order a pourover. You can make it at home, usually better than the barista (even at a top third wave shop), and it doesn't cost you $5. Order an espresso drink instead.
To be fair that's a somewhat common opinion here. Aeropress is overrated because, quite frankly, its most vocal proponents are newbies who don't have a good enough grinder yet for anything else.
Except for Ken's artist, they love that guy
Because they're Chinese companies and as such are subject to interference from the Chinese government? If at this point you still don't believe that China has its hands in all of Tencent/Alibaba/Baidu's data then you're willfully deluding yourself. It's baffling to me that people came to this thread to defend Huawei. It's very plausible (and highly likely) that the US government has access to Facebook/Google/Reddit's data and yet you think that China doesn't spy on Huawei/Xiaomi users? You'd have to be the most naive optimist in the world, and I say this as an ethnically Chinese person myself.
Honestly you sound like you have the same problems I did when I first started playing SF. 

Read up on cancels vs links and their respective notations in Gief's Gym. The short version is that cancels should be done quickly while the move you're canceling from is still active, whereas links must be timed properly (and not mashed) after the move you're linking from is finished.

Watch videos of good players doing combos with overhead footage of their hands, with SOUND ON (very important, and most likely the missing link for you). Judging from your other comment about mashing out combos, you probably just don't know the rhythm yet. Notice how they don't mash. (They might double tap, which is a slightly more advanced technique. Look this up but don't bother trying to replicate it for now.) Emulate the timing.

When you practice combos, practice each link or cancel individually. Figure out the latest timing you can use and still have it combo. Figure out the earliest timing you can use where the second move still comes out. Do this with one button press per move, no mashing.

Practice with input display on. I have a hunch that your inputs aren't clean if you're not able to get spiral arrow consistently. Most likely you're pressing a button before completing the QCF, or you're not hitting the forward at all, or you're missing the down forward. Read what the input display shows and diagnose accordingly. Take it slow, consciously hit each directional input BEFORE hitting a button. A lot of new players think QCF + P means do the QCF and the P at the same time, but you should really think of it as two separate inputs, QCF then P. This will help if you find that your QCF/QCB specials don't come out sometimes.

You didn't ask, but DPs can be done 3 ways in this game: f-d-df (the "official way"), f-df-f (for when you're already walking forward), or df-d-df (probably the easiest, especially if you're already holding down-back). That last one can also be done as df-db-df if you need to be absolutely sure you hit the down input.

Keep at it for a bit in training mode. The issues you're running into aren't insurmountable, and in fact they're quite common for new stick users/FG players. With mechanical issues like this, you just have to know what to search for on YouTube. I'm sure you'll be able to figure this out.
C. Viper and Decapre would be cool functions to have in V, and they've both appeared in the story so there's at least a chance. If Evil Ryu gets added I really hope it's as a VT3 with unlimited gauge and not as a separate character. It fits thematically too, Ryu gets bopped for a bit, decides he's ANGRY NOW, *boom* Evil Ryu comes out for the rest of the round.
I agree, but who the hell is spending $30 a year on CSGO? You're forgetting the fact that skins in that game are liquid, so you can cash out your inventory at any time for a 15% Valve tax. Can't do that with SFV costumes.

Lmao this post is hilarious. If this is all it takes to rustle your jimmies you probably shouldn't be playing a competitive game. Besides, it's literally the character-specific default win quote against Zangief so you're mad for nothing. All those Akuma players didn't even think twice about you and here you are posting about *muh persecution* on Reddit. Honestly sad.
Looks like nobody actually read the post title. The preorder bonus is PS4 exclusive, so for PC players the Deluxe Edition ($36.46) is equivalent to AE ($40). You should buy it now. If you decide to start grinding fight money, take a look at the stickied thread about buying AE. There's a stickied comment that breaks down how to obtain all the FM that will go away on 1/16 when AE releases. Note that for a new player, doing all of this can easily take 100+ hours. I would start with the individual character stories (easy, about 5-10 minutes each), then do character demonstrations vol. 1 and vol. 2 (free, just sit through some screens), and then finally general story (easy, 2-3 hours) and extra battle (could be pretty hard, but it's worth it for 50k FM). Don't bother with the trials unless it's for a character you intend to play, since some of them have one or two combos that are extremely difficult for a new player to pull off. Feel free to try easy and normal survival if you still have time after all that.

If you do get a Yamaha, make sure to get it set up by a professional (preferably not at Guitar Center). It'll cost you $35-70 depending on where you live and does wonders for playability, especially for a beginner. It'll save you so much frustration in the long run - reason being that the action on cheaper Yamahas tends to be too high for a beginner to play comfortably without fret buzz. Trust me on this, I dabbled on and off with my Yamaha FG700 for years until a more experienced friend picked up my guitar and within five seconds told me it needed a setup. Since then it's been so, so much easier to play, and as a result I've actually stuck with it.

Here's a trick that I learned at work: microwave with the lid off, but cover it instead with a damp paper towel (soak the paper towel in water and then wring it out). This way, the moisture in the paper towel will seep into the hard rice and make it nice and fluffy again, and your food should heat more evenly.
MIT is great but it's not necessarily the best in every STEM field, especially for undergrad since their professors don't treat undergraduate education as a top priority (because they're more invested in their grad students). Other schools with smaller graduate programs and/or a higher professor:student ratio tend to be better for undergrad. And for PhD programs, you usually pick based on the specific professor or lab you want to work with, not based on the reputation of the school, and some of these fields can get pretty narrow with only one or two professors in the country doing the research you're interested in. It's not inconcievable that a prospective student would choose elsewhere.

Interesting. I think the whole "buying at market price and settling at buylist" is a pretty big wrinkle for the market maker. Say for example the spot price is $80 (market) and a customer would settle at any price over $80 (buylist). OP would have to buy at $80, and then if the price doesn't move enough for the option to be worth exercising, sell out of his position at a pretty big loss, considering that buylist for a $80 card may be as low as $50. Either that or continue to hold. I suppose that's the risk of trading these options in the first place, and due to the large size of the market-buylist spread he could stand to gain quite a bit from fees of unexercised options. Actually thinking about it now, because of the huge gap between market and buylist prices it's pretty likely that he won't actually buy stock against the calls until it gets closer to expiration and he believes the price will go up enough for the option to be exercised, unlike what you described actually happens in real life option markets (with the market maker immediately buying stock against each call).

Another possible issue is that unlike with stocks and futures, many MTG cards have comparatively little float. So it's very possible that the market can be manipulated by a motivated buyer. The use of buylist prices for settlement can help alleviate this problem though, as I imagine they take a long time to adjust their prices to match the market, giving OP some time to figure out a course of action.

I'm just thinking out loud, I don't work in finance but am tangentially involved with the industry. So it's very interesting to hear your thoughts, and do correct me if I've mischaracterized anything you said.
Is it even legal for him to buy physical cards as a counterparty? I guess there's no conflict of interest if he only offers call options, but presumably he will want to sell the cards at some point, at which point he'll be operating in direct opposition to his customers.

I've been waiting a long time for Uniqlo to release a companion men's line to the IDLF collection and I'll be honest, this is pretty disappointing. Everything here looks uninspired compared to the women's collection, especially the sweaters and shirts. I don't know how many of you are familiar with the women's line, but [check a look](http://www.uniqlo.com/ines/us/index.html) if you haven't, because it's seriously great. Every item has personality. This new men's line is drab in comparison, and I don't care how many times you say it's "Nordic-inspired" or "F/W versus S/S" - there are just so few of the idiosyncratic details present here that make IDLF interesting (where are the red contrast stitches? interesting buttons/cuffs? curious little "designer" accents in unexpected places?) that this may as well have been released under Uniqlo U instead, and no one would bat an eye. And don't get me wrong, I own several Uniqlo U pieces, but that's not what I was hoping would come out of an Inès collab. Very disappointing.

There's nothing great near Columbus Circle. How far are you willing to walk?

I see what you mean. Unfortunately this does tend to happen often in online forums, where the initial reasoning and associated caveats behind a recommendation or review are gradually lost as time goes on and users forget why a product was good in the first place, relying instead on the judgment of others who came before them. I've seen this happen in /r/fitness with Starting Strength and Strong Lifts, in /r/coffee with grinders, in /r/android with texting apps, in /r/edmproduction with DAWs, and in /r/buildapc with basically every component that goes into a computer.

In each of these cases I don't believe that the constant parroting of secondhand advice was the result of any malicious intent. In fact I think it's very natural for information loss to be propagated in this manner - it's not difficult to imagine a scenario where what was once "The Best X for People who Y under $Z" slowly becomes "The Best X", full stop, over the course of many, many repetitions.

I've already spent way too long thinking and writing about this, but I'll just add one last point. Have you seen [this comic](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2475)? I've noticed (and I think you have, too) that it does tend to be people who aren't intimately familiar with the product category that they're recommending a particular product for who tend to be the loudest and most assertive when making such a recommendation. That's why I place more trust in comparative reviews like the one at the top of this thread, and why I pretty much disregard any review that doesn't at least mention alternatives.

Edit: and if you're wondering who's downvoting you, it's not me.
And I'm defending the brand how exactly? All I've said is that there's been so much noise made about Ex Officio over the years that it's highly improbable that the reviews are astroturfed to this day. I was skeptical too when I first heard about them, but the recommendations I've seen recently all seem to come from natural accounts. I've never worn them, nor do I ever intend to. But people (lots and lots of them by the looks of it) have bought them and recommended them, and that's more data than we have for most things. Whether these people are reviewing them after 5 wears or 50 is another matter entirely, as is the matter of whether the reviewers have experienced anything of similar or higher quality to compare them to, but these are the type of questions that apply universally to any product.

Listen man, you came into this thread having never heard of the brand despite being on this website since 2010. I'm just trying to fill in some holes for you.
Been here for 5 years. Ex Officio has always been recommended in AskReddit, and also on MFA when the topic comes up. While it may have been astroturf initially I'm convinced that it's organic now.

To add: I'll never buy them unless they drop the price (it's just underwear, come the fuck on), but my friend has a few pairs and swears by them.

Where did you get this impression in my post? I thought I conveyed that I was not a fan of the HD 598 Cs for EDM, but maybe I wasn't quite clear...
Yeah, the shorter cable does.
I have the open version and I bought the closed backs based on reviews and how much I liked the regular HD 598, and I have to say I'm really disappointed as well. It's not just the soundstage - it has a totally different sound signature from the open version. Everything sounds veiled and vocals often sound muffled, and the bass is atrocious. I read so many reviews saying that the bass is punchier, and while it is, I feel like there is almost no sub bass and as a result the bass comes across as weak and lacks the impact that even the open back version has. I'll definitely be returning these, which is a shame because I was looking for a pair of closed back headphones for work and the ATH M50X sound signature doesn't vibe with me.
There are better headphones if you mainly listen to EDM. It's suggested often, but the ever popular ATH M50X is more suited to that genre than either of the HD 598s. The M50X has a lot of bass, and it's very punchy and fast. There's also much more clarity in the M50X to my ears.

OP mentions that bass is punchier than on the HD 598, but I still find it rather anemic. The closed version lacks sub bass compared to the open version, and the mids are noticeably recessed, making vocals (female vocals in particular) sound muffled and distant. Overall I'm rather disappointed with this purchase, because I was hoping for a good closed back headphone for work, but I'll definitely be returning these.

Two days late to this thread but I want to second /u/robotparker's reading suggestion. I studied this book in my university's advanced photography class, and it definitely challenged my perspective on photography - and in particular, on photography as a medium for art. As /u/smallbatchb said, there's a gaping divide between what artists consider fine art photography and what photographers call fine art photography. I'm not an artist - I'm a photographer with no formal training, but I happened to dabble in art at university. I suspect your situation is not too dissimilar, and if it's the case then I think this book should be required reading for you because it will open your eyes to a whole new world of art through photographs.

This is the greatest explanation of anything I've ever read, and I've been on this site for 5 years. Holy shit.
His argument makes no fucking sense. Why wouldn't a longer game do BO3s? Ain't nobody got time for BO5s all day in LoL/Dota/CSGO, it would take a week to run a 16-team tournament and the players would be exhausted after one match. Plus the variance is so much higher in fighting games that it just makes sense to play FT3s.
I guess it depends on what you call streetwear. On the whole, Japanese fashion is rather homogeneous - it's only when you look at pictures of people on the internet that you really get the sense that Japanese fashion is about individual style. In Japan, the predominant trend for women in their 20s and 30s is this loose, drapey, conservatively-cut combination of light-colored-round-neck-t-shirt-tucked-into-dark-flowy-shin-length-skirt that is almost ubiquitous in Tokyo during the summer months. (Interestingly, this look is generally paired with dyed hair - usually brown - and a short wavy bob cut.) For men it is even less interesting; maybe I'm just accustomed to Western styling cues, but I find Japanese men's fashion incredibly stale, and most don't seem to care much about their appearances. This is a gross generalization of course, but having spent a month in Japan and a week in Seoul this summer I can tell you that the wackier side of Japanese fashion you see all over internet message boards is a lot less common than you might expect on the streets. Not to say that it's not there, because it certainly isn't *rare*^(in Tokyo), but outside of big cities it would absolutely be uncommon to find the kinds of fashion that you see when you search for "Japanese streetwear" on Google Images. What we've labeled Japanese streetwear is a relatively small subculture in Japan. Likewise, I would hazard a guess that the reason why so many commenters claim that Korean streetwear wearers don't stand out is because streetwear is the prevailing fashion trend there right now. It's a very different environment from the US, where outside of urban areas prep and traditional Americana styles dwarf streetwear in popularity, which means that you are bound to see a lot more Stan Smiths and Champion sweaters in Korea just as you might expect to see tons of boat shoes and blue gingham shirts here. So to compare Korean streetwear to Japanese streetwear is a little bit disingenuous, because they simply do not exist on the same scale.

It's also important to keep in mind your reference point when comparing Japanese/Korean/American streetwear. I've noticed a lot of commenters saying that Japanese streetwear is more fashion-forward, but how do you know that this is not just because you only went to Tokyo? This is not an accusation, but merely a reminder - I can tell you with certainty that people who live in Tokyo/New York care far more about fashion than those who live in Takaoka/Paterson, for instance, and I would imagine the same principle would apply to Korea.

Wow, I must be the only person in this sub/NY who enjoys both Counter-Strike and Street Fighter. First of all, the event was advertised as CSGO + SFV from the start (seriously, check [the homepage](http://en.esl-one.com/csgo/newyork-2016/)), so to refer to SFV grand finals as "additional entertainment" for CSGO fans is unfair to those of us who were there for SFV. Another thing you all should realize is that SF players and fans didn't ask for this arrangement either. Fighting game tournaments always have Top 8 played straight through all the way to grand finals, so to have Xiao Hai and Momochi play their match the day after the rest of Top 8 was pretty shitty. I agree that ESL fucked up with organization, not to mention the cringy intro and unnecessary analysis for SFV (which, mind you, are unheard of in FGC tournaments), but there was almost nothing they could have done at that point. They had to build in time between the last semi-final and the final so that VP could rest, and judging from [Neo's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/55of7p/neos_opinion_about_the_final_vs_navi/) ESL would have gotten way more flak if they had moved up the final to get back on schedule.

I get that it sucks as a spectator, but the main focus should be on the players. Ideally this event would have had an extra day but it shouldn't come as a surprise that ESL didn't want to host such a long tournament for only 8 teams.

Whoops, just assumed you were American haha. Are you referring to the [Skerton](https://www.amazon.com/Hario-Ceramic-Skerton-Storage-Capacity/dp/B001802PIQ)? If so, the Skerton has a slight edge on the Mini Mill, but they're roughly comparable. In that case it may very well be the grinder that's holding you back. If you can, I'd spring for a Baratza Virtuoso (electric) or LIDO 3/E/E-T (manual). The Virtuoso is a significant upgrade from the Hario and also noticeably better than the cheaper Baratza Encore. It has the same burrs as the more expensive Preciso. The LIDO is better than all of these, but can take quite a bit of force to turn compared to your current grinder, so do your research and watch some videos before you make a commitment to 20-second arm workouts every morning...
It's almost assuredly the grinder and the beans. Try a bag of beans from a well known roaster (Counter Culture, Intelligentsia, Verve, Blue Bottle, etc.) to determine if that's where the problem lies before you spring for a new grinder. What grinder are you using? Just because you have a burr grinder doesn't mean it's actually good, it just means it's not utter crap. I have a Hario Mini Mill which serves me well enough but is a lot worse than the Baratza Preciso my parents use, which in turn can't be compared to a $2000 grinder that a commercial coffee shop would have.

Go out with your male friends. Meet people with them. It'll be the most fun you've ever had, even if you go home with nobody.

The rest of this post was great too (especially the first three categories, I'm assuming most people have decent hygiene), but this part right here is crucial. I dated my high school girlfriend for three and a half years in college and as a result I neglected my friendships and didn't bother to form meaningful relationships with other people. Having a group of close friends makes everything so much better, whether you're having fun spending time together or easing each other through heartbreak. I don't think the group of friends has to be exclusively male but it sure makes things easier when there's no chance of friendcest.

Props to you for writing this. I just went through a breakup (different girl from above) at a transitional period in my life: I just graduated college a few months ago and I'm starting work in two days, and due to the breakup and also the separation from all my college friends I don't think I've ever felt so alone. I suppose I'm not exactly the target audience, but I wanted you to know that your post resonated with me a lot. Cheers.

>The "restoration" was putting the emperor back in charge.

This part is not quite right; the restoration of imperial rule was really just an excuse for the Satcho Alliance to stage a coup d'etat. The resulting government was primarily ruled by samurai from the Satsuma and Choshu domains, while Emperor Meiji (who was 14 years old at the time and knew diddly squat about politics) would go on to spend most of his time composing poetry with his wife.

And yeah, I *am* trying to teach you lessons on Japanese culture. Whether or not you want to learn is your prerogative. I'm assuming from the way you wrote it that you worked in an English-speaking environment with both Japanese and American colleagues. I'm also assuming that you're not Asian. And I'm telling you as a Japanese-speaking Chinese American that Japanese people treat foreigners who look like foreigners differently from those who initially pass for Japanese. Obviously I'm going out on a limb here, but if my assumptions are right (correct me if I'm wrong) then I think it's safe to say that the Japanese people you interacted with during your stay in Japan did not expect you to know little things such as when to use a 15º bow versus a 30º bow versus a 45º bow. They would think exactly as you said, "that bow isn't exactly how we do it, but good on him for trying". But to take that goodwill and run with it for years, never bothering to learn how to really do things the right way *is* culturally insensitive.
Simply put, people don't bow with their hands put together like that in Japan (see my response to the other guy). Maybe in other parts of Asia - I've seen it personally in southeast Asia and China, though China is generally more lax in terms of bowing etiquette than certain other countries - but definitely not in Japan, where bowing has tons of little rules and customs that most foreigners are not conscious of. It doesn't sound like a big deal, but by bowing in a non-Japanese way to a Japanese person and expecting it to carry the same meaning as a "Japanese bow" you're essentially lumping all Asian cultures together and implying that "~~all you Asians look alike~~ I cannot be assed to learn your individual country's customs because they're all probably the same, you're all fucking Asian after all", which is incredibly insensitive.
The fuck are *you* talking about? You don't bow with your hands put together like that in Japan, you keep your arms straight down at your sides and bend your torso. That sort of bow connotes something else entirely. Call it racism, call it cultural insensitivity, either way the fact of the matter is that you don't fucking bow like that in Japan unless you're in the middle of praying at a shrine or temple (and you only put your hands together while making your prayer, when you bow during the ritual you do it with your hands at your sides).

Working in Japan as a foreigner means you get away with all sorts of shit because Japanese culture is all about letting other people save face, especially foreign guests. You wouldn't even know you were making a faux pas since they'd just smile and go with it to save you from embarrassment.
You jest but it really is though. Obviously LI Joe doesn't mean anything by it and is just trying to be respectful, but as an Asian dude it kinda bothers me. That shit is the definition of casual unintentional racism.

Man those east coast struggles though, if Thursday Morning Fights didn't end so late I'd watch it a lot more.
I think this is mainly due to the fact that CS:GO is round-by-round unlike Dota, which leaves some natural downtime for production to fill in with player cams. CS:GO has cameras for every player at large events now. It didn't used to; two or three years ago the norm was to have one camera at the edge of the desk for all five players on a team, and you'd only really be able to see one guy's face. Nowadays production makes it a huge point to show individual players' faces after each round, along with shots of the crowd for hype moments, often to the chagrin of viewers who just want to see the money situation at the beginning/end of rounds.

It's a very big difference. I have the HD 598 and have borrowed the M50 from my friends to audition several times. The M50 is suitable for library use; the HD 598 is most definitely not.
Try Gap shorts. They're 7" inseam and can be found on sale for $15-25.
He did after the semifinal against Wales

I mean, uh, *unintelligible meming*
Or my personal favorite, ["the way Mike Ross plays Street Fighter".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILbomcBefis)
I mean they have a 11-11.5" inseam and the leg opening is too wide.
Aside from the H&M one these comments are extremely unhelpful (granted I'd never wear H&M shorts either since the quality is seriously shit). I'm 5'7" with skinny legs and have tried on a number of different shorts in the past few years, and the only ones that fit me are Gap shorts. Their current line is pretty darn short (7" inseam), so if you're comfortable with that then it's the best buy for skinny dudes. I haven't tried BR shorts since they don't come in my waist but the Aiden short looks like it could fit. Don't bother with Brooks Brothers (too fat) or Uniqlo (too long and too fat).

The only caveat is that Gap shorts aren't dyed well at all, so after a year or so you'll notice the color fading. I recommend buying lighter colors for this reason. They also aren't as thick as J.Crew Stantons, which is annoying, but if you're short and skinny like I am then you don't have much room to complain.
Would this work for getting Nikon cameras to produce Fuji colors, or are the Fuji files too different? I'm a CS major and would love to know how you did it.
I dilute with room temperature water and add ice anyway so I always brew at room temperature. I do refrigerate the concentrate after brewing though. The common wisdom is to brew it longer (around 24 hours) if you're going to do it in the fridge, but as far as I know nobody has ever done any taste tests to confirm the technique.

You're talking about SS16. I believe the poster above you is referring to FW16, or whenever the next collection is arriving since Uniqlo recently brought on Lemaire as the head of R&D in Paris.

I did a bit of digging since I'm curious myself. According to [this link](http://www.highsnobiety.com/2016/06/10/christophe-lemaire-uniqlo/), the collection will be presented in July and released sometime in the fall.
For full sentence quotes, yes. Not for "quoted phrases", where the British convention is to place punctuation marks outside the quotes if they are not part of the direct quotation.
It's an old holdover from when printing presses were still in use. Being printed on a very small piece of metal, the period could fall off the line if it were placed at the end of a line after a quotation mark, so for practical reasons it was always printed on the inside of quotes. These days there is no reason to place a period inside quotation marks, and in fact the English no longer do this. For one reason or another America never got the memo and it is still grammatically standard to place the period inside quotation marks.
Actually, in Japanese conversation it's normal to refer to the other party by their name, along with honorifics as necessary, rather than saying "you". The word "you" is generally reserved for strangers (and husbands, where it takes on a meaning similar to the English "dear").

This way of thinking is laughably outdated. You think Reddit makes money? You think [YouTube makes money](http://www.wsj.com/articles/viewers-dont-add-up-to-profit-for-youtube-1424897967)? Reddit only exists because of its users, sure. But the userbase only exists because Reddit provides a platform for them to congregate in the first place. When you post a link on FMF you're not "working for Reddit for free", you're using their servers for free. It's astonishingly naive to fault the service provider for wanting something in return.
I have the red one and yeah it stained the corners and edges of all of my textbooks and notebooks within days. The bottom/part that touches your lower back also gets pretty dark and dirty after a few months. Might be better on the navy one since it's already dark.

Should have said, "Four. Sherry."
Lol there's always some smart-ass that brings this up. Fact of the matter is that the ら sound is generally romanized as "ra", not "la".
The comic put Ra in there because in Japanese that's how you pronounce La. Doubtful that you'd go Do - Re - Mi - Fa - Sol and then suddenly Ra - Shi - Do instead of La - Ti - Do. (Note also that in certain languages Si is used instead of Ti, and in Japanese Si is pronounced Shi.)
For those of you who can't find the Bear Motion case, I'm almost certain it's the same exact case as the KuGi: http://www.amazon.com/quality-ultra-thin-Google-Huawei-smartphone/dp/B014ZJ0538

I've been using this case for several months and it's great, the texture feels nice and it's really thin. Plus it provides full access to the buttons (I hate mushy buttons).
They're okay. Good for the price, which is why I keep buying from them since I'm a broke ass college student, but not as good as your CounterStumpBottlegentsias (or even my local roaster for that matter, but they charge $18 for a 12 oz bag). I've tried their most popular beans (Ethiopia Halo Bariti, Costa Rica Honey Process, Ethiopia Yirgacheffe Konga) and would rate them collectively 7.5/10 on taste, 9.5/10 on value. For comparison, I'd put my local roaster at 9/10 on taste, 6/10 on value. Turns out it's really hard to beat $16 for a 1 lb bag.

Don't worry about the freshness, they roast and ship on the same day (or at worst the next day) and you want to let freshly roasted coffee degas for 3-7 days anyway so it works out nicely.

If you're looking for recommendations, I'd put the Costa Rica Honey Process on the top of your list. I've gotten better cups out of that than either of the Ethiopias, but I will note that the Ethiopia Halo Bariti is this subreddit's favorite bean from Happy Mug.

Give it time, even CS:GO started slow and now has four Valve-sponsored $1 million majors a year, along with multiple independent leagues like ESL-ESEA, DreamHack, and Faceit putting up millions of dollars, and even a fucking TV deal with TBS. When it launched in 2012 most of the 1.6/Source pros refused to touch it because it was a steaming pile of shit, and even after they fixed most of the major issues it didn't really start to blow up until 2014-2015. It all comes down to how Capcom handles the game now.

I guess I'm optimistic, and sure SFV has a higher barrier to entry than CS:GO, but if Capcom handles their updates/Pro Tour well for the next 2-3 years I think SFV could be the first fighting game to go truly esports.
Also helps that ReDeYe hosts CS:GO events.

One of the big problems with sticky threads is that they get very few upvotes since there's no point in upvoting a thread that's already at the top of a subreddit. But a side effect of this is that they have poor position on our frontpages, especially because they are usually posted at the beginning of the day and as a result are several hours old by the time the last game ends. This is very poor for casual fans of the game who don't necessarily browse /r/GlobalOffensive but still view the posts that show up on their frontpage. It's bad for hype, it's bad for promoting the game and the subreddit, and it's bad for casual viewers who wouldn't even know there was a major going on if not for the highlight clips that usually show up on their frontpage.

Another thing about highlight threads is that they provide a platform where users can discuss a particular match in more detail than Twitch chat allows. This subreddit doesn't have match threads, and for good reason: Twitch chat gives users an outlet for immediate reactions and steals much of the attention away from the subreddit while a game is going on. But one of the weaknesses of Twitch chat is that it moves so fast that ~~no one will realize I'm gay~~ there simply isn't time for longer thoughts and reactions beyond a simple "VAC" or "PogChamp", since it simply won't be read by anyone. Users want an outlet where they can talk about hype moments and sick plays in longer form than is viable on Twitch, and highlight threads are the perfect platform: they are individual noteworthy moments that naturally draw wider discussion of an entire match.

In the thread that you linked /r/nfl was used as an example of a sports subreddit that puts highlights in their own threads. I'd argue that this isn't actually a good way to do it, and the only reason they get away with it is because they also have match threads (which easily draw thousands of comments on regular season games and push 40,000 per half during the playoffs). As a counterexample, /r/soccer allows highlight posts, and this allows casual followers to keep up with the sport on their own frontpage without having to visit the subreddit, and it's also great for hype and friendly banter. If we were to emulate a sports subreddit, /r/soccer is a much better model.

Appreciate the effort but it would be much better if you had used a consistent scale for the y-axis across all shows. This is especially misleading when you get to the graphs for the incomplete shows, which all look extremely consistent because the graphs were scaled to include 0.
This is why Vocaloid is possible in Japanese yet still so wonky in English. There are only 120 or so sounds, and the lack of tonality (plus the fact that tones in speech are lost in song) helps, too.
I grind 34g with it routinely. I've even done 40g, but at that point it starts overflowing the catcher jar.
[Shamelessly stolen from /a/](https://media2.giphy.com/media/k9XrZaAJuQyMU/200_s.gif)
I have a Mini Mill and prefer it to the Skerton. The Mini Mill is much easier to adjust grind size with and is more comfortable to hold while grinding. I've had mine for over 2 years and haven't come across any handle issues. Another oft-overlooked feature is that it is made of plastic, making it far more durable than the glass-bottomed Skerton. I've dropped my Mini Mill countless times, and a few months ago the plastic base around the catcher finally broke off ([pic](http://i.imgur.com/PrMgoch.jpg)), but it still works and still stands up on its own. The Skerton's glass catcher jar doesn't inspire such confidence.
Yeah, I usually fill up a bottle at a time from the water fountain and take it back to my room. So it usually sits for a few hours or more before I finish it.
Agreed. I don't consider my sense of taste very sensitive but even I could tell Poland Spring from Dasani or Kirkland or tap water in a blind test. The difference carries over to coffee as well, the tap water where I live tastes horrible so I only ever brew coffee with bottled water. My roommates think I'm crazy.

I see you're new to /r/coffee. Yes, pre-wetting the filter is generally recommended for most pourover methods, including V60 and Chemex. The exception is the Kalita Wave, where the filter is thin enough that it doesn't matter much (and wetting the filter may cause it to collapse).
Free shipping over $99, I just ordered a bunch of other stuff I plan on returning.
There was no joke, the user above me mentioned that Matt Perger didn't pre-wet the filter, I wrote my response, reddit pooped itself and posted for me twice, and then a couple of dank memers decided to join in on the fun. Presumably because they stir the grounds immediately.

"with the greatest of ease"
Hey what pants are those? They look sick
Looks like you're using a V60 from your other post. Generally you should be fine, but because the V60 has such a large hole at the bottom, you might find it hard to maintain the proper brew time with so little coffee. You'll have to grind much finer than usual to hit the 2:00-2:30 mark. At that amount of water, I'd also expect that the 16:1 ratio doesn't hold anymore since the filter + grounds are soaking up a non-negligible amount of water. I would experiment with your brew ratio - my guess is that you may need closer to 17:1 or 18:1.
So...you use a standard Melitta cone and a standard brewing method, except instead of the normal ~16:1 water:coffee ratio that the rest of us here at /r/coffee use, you use 10:1? There isn't anything particularly special about that video; that's just how you make a pourover (and nowhere does it mention how much water/coffee was used). I don't mean to sound rude, but it really does sound like you're doing it wrong. I urge you to try making a pourover with a more normal ratio.
What kind of pourovers are you making??? The standard ratio is 15-17:1. 10:1 sounds disgusting.
Amazon has it for 20% off if you have Prime.
He had to kill the Spellskite first.
Word, I just don't want people to get the wrong idea since yours is the top comment in this thread. I'm sure there are people misinterpreting it as if you were saying "there is no difference" rather than "I personally cannot taste a difference".
It's mostly because of the filters. Chemex brews taste brighter and clearer (this is one way to describe it, if you don't like Chemex I'm sure you'd describe it as lacking body and maybe too acidic) because the filters are much thicker than other pourover filters. For what it's worth I'll add that I disagree with the OP; I can definitely taste a difference between V60 and Kalita Wave for example.

Mine is bent, presumably from carrying it in the front pocket of my jeans. It's very easy to see if you put the phone facedown and press on the corners. A lot of people will downplay the issue but it's a legitimate flaw with the phone, just as valid as the complaints about tinted screens (my first two 6Ps were horribly tinted).
Shinto wasn't imported (at least not directly like Buddhism), and it also wasn't terribly important aside from helping to legitimize the power of the emperor (who is said to be descended from Amaterasu, the sun goddess, in shinto tradition). Buddhism on the other hand helped shape intellectual, scientific and political developments throughout the early modern period. For example, the class system and system of familial relationships were codified in writings by Chinese Buddhist philosophers. Also he did mention the kojiki-den, so technically he did mention shinto.
Amazon doesn't pay better than Facebook or Google. At least not for new grads.
All balance updates and new features will be released for free. The only things you will need to pay for are new characters, costumes, stages, and character colors. Heck, you can even buy many of these (including DLC characters) with fight money, which you earn by playing the game. Honestly this is a very fair business model and you ought to inform yourself on it before making snap judgments.

You're going to get lots of different answers depending on personal tastes and experience. For what it's worth, [this thread on head-fi.org](http://www.head-fi.org/t/478568/multi-iem-review-349-iems-compared-life-headphones-added-12-30-15-p-1096) is pretty much the holy grail of IEM reviews. ljokerl, the author of that thread, also has a website with buyer's guides, reviews and rankings that's probably easier to use: http://theheadphonelist.com/. This guide in particular has recommendations for every price range and sound signature: http://theheadphonelist.com/earphone-buyers-guide/

Decide what sound signature you want and use the guide above to pick an earphone based on your budget. Personally, I have the Yamaha EPH-100 and will whole-heartedly recommend them if you like a warm, full sound. I paid $150 for these several years ago, bought another pair when they dropped to $100, and now that they're below $80 there is absolutely nothing in the price range that can compete that has the same sound signature (the RHA MA750 is the main competition here, it is similarly warm but slightly brighter and is $120 on Amazon). In any case, here's what ljokerl recommends for various sound signatures in your price range:

* Warm and smooth: [RHA MA750](http://theheadphonelist.com/headphone_review/rha-ma750-ma750i/), [Yamaha EPH-100](http://theheadphonelist.com/headphone_review/yamaha-eph-100/)
* V-shaped: [Sennheiser Momentum](http://theheadphonelist.com/headphone_review/sennheiser-momentum-ear/), [Alpha & Delta AD01](http://theheadphonelist.com/headphone_review/alpha-delta-ad01-in-ear-earphone-review/)
* Balanced: [HiFiMan RE-400](http://theheadphonelist.com/headphone_review/hifiman-re-400-waterline/), [VSonic GR07 Classic](http://theheadphonelist.com/brief-impressions-vsonic-gr07-classic-plus-warning/), [VSonic GR07 Bass Edition](http://theheadphonelist.com/headphone_review/vsonic-gr07-bass-edition/)
* Basshead: unfortunately the $100 pick ([Future Sonics Atrio MG7](http://theheadphonelist.com/headphone_review/future-sonics-atrio-mg7/)) has been discontinued; ljokerl recommends the Yamaha EPH-100 or RHA MA750.
This is what I've been doing as well. Alternatively, you can start with a budget UR Delver build and transition into Grixis Control or Scapeshift.

To OP: Here's a good Kiln Fiend primer: http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/budget-magic-57-7-tix-modern-blistering-rage

The game plan is to resolve a [[Kiln Fiend]] or one of the prowess creatures and then use rituals, pump spells, and Phyrexian mana spells to pump it up to 10 power, give it double strike, and swing for the win. This deck will get you the following UR staples:

* Monastery Swiftspear
* Lightning Bolt (sideboard)
* Young Pyromancer (sideboard)
* Gitaxian Probe (I highly recommend you replace the Manamorphose with Git. Probe)

You can then pick up some counterspells, Lavadudes, and a playset of Delvers and try UR Delver: http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/modern/budget-modern/545304-primer-cheapo-ur-delver-working-on-new-lists-and

Budget UR Delver nets you the following staples:

* Delver
* Young Pyromancer
* Lavadude ($7)
* Gitaxian Probe
* Lightning Bolt
* Vapor Snag
* Remand (depends on your budget, these are $5)
* Izzet Charm
* Electrolyze
* Spell Pierce
* Serum Visions (depends on your budget, these are $7)
* Dispel
* Roast
* Fetches/shocks

This will give you a great base for upgrading into a T2 URx deck.
Why not Temur Delver? Seriously, besides the budget issue of not owning Tarmogoyfs it sounds like the deck you want to be playing. It's got the counterspells you like (you only have 5 in this list), and the creatures don't require you to cast spells on your turn to make them good. You say you want evasion, I say Delver and Mandrills give you evasion and are better creatures than Stormchaser Mage to boot.

Despite what you say about not wanting to play a bad version of Burn that is exactly what this looks like. I can't think of a single matchup where you can expect to do better than Burn. I really don't think URx Prowess has a place in the meta (especially not without Abbot/Bauble), but hey if playing Stormchaser Mage is your number one priority then by all means, glhf.
What about Temur Delver? That actually plays *more* counterspells than this list, and uses Tarmogoyf to boot. I don't think you can get greener than that.
You sure you're not thinking of the [Jackie Chan face](http://www.reactionface.info/sites/default/files/imagecache/Node_Page/images/1257003814239.jpg)? NotLikeThis is [a Twitch emoticon](https://twitchemotes.com/emote/58765) that doesn't really look like the "not like this" scene in the Matrix (IIRC Switch just shakes her head, she doesn't make that pose).
When I visited Japan this summer it's all anyone was playing. Granted I don't know how hardcore of an arcade Taito Station Akihabara is, but it was usually 3-4 guys on one of the older Street Fighters (ayy '15er alert lmao), nobody playing Ultra, 5-6 people on Xrd and everyone else playing either Pokken or rhythm games lol. Most of the Pokken players looked like high schoolers though so maybe it doesn't matter anyway.
There are. $60k starting is average for CS grads, even higher if you're good enough to be hired by a top company. Google/Microsoft/Facebook/well-funded startups pay north of $100k base for new grads.

That said who cares lol, they're similar enough...but I wouldn't go anywhere near that jacket for more than $25.

If you're looking for the one in the Amazon photos, it's the Hario V60 Range Server: http://www.amazon.com/Hario-XGS-60TB-Range-Server-600Ml/dp/B000P4931S

Otherwise it's generally known as a carafe.
In terms of making coffee? Not really. Plastic holds heat better (yes, really) and is both lighter and more durable. It won't crack in half if you drop it 1.5 feet into your dorm's bathroom sink while trying to wash the damn thing with soapy hands, for example. Yes, I'm still bitter.

On the other hand, were I to buy a new V60 to replace the one I ~~broke~~ lost, I'd go for ceramic again. It just looks nicer.
Yes, that must be it. I just checked with Chrome on a Macbook and it displays correctly. Thanks!

Edit: I thought the font in your screenshot looked familiar. It's displaying in Consolas 11pt on Windows. Sadly we don't have Menlo :P
For some reason your flowchart doesn't display correctly for me.

Yeah I have, but my childhood wasn't just a series of jokes. When every skit in Nichibros has a punchline, I don't know how you can call it slice of life with a straight face.
Pretty weak overall tbh. Only pieces that interest me are [this](http://i.imgur.com/BSNLRaH.png) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/b4C2U1B.png). F/W was miles better.

White Vans are hard to do wrong with. They pair just fine with jeans or chinos of any color/slimness. Don't go heroin-dealer-core though.
Looks like promo art for a Street Fighter animated series. Great work.
I don't think Nichibros counts as slice of life tbh, or at the very least that's not the main genre. Nichibros is probably 90% comedy, 9% slice of life, 1% shounen (i.e., all of the Dragon Quest scenes).
Expedite is basically [[Crimson Wisps]] which doesn't see play anywhere. The only time you ever want to see it is off of an Abbot, otherwise it's a dead draw. Slip Through Space has a spot in Kiln Fiend jank and basically nowhere else. Infect will still use Distortion Strike and UR tempo doesn't want such a one-dimensional spell (Remand/Vapor Snag are better in general).

I'm skeptical as well; the card simply doesn't do enough on its own to merit its spot. Having to spend a card to make a 2 CMC creature do 2 damage feels real bad. If only it were 2/1 instead...

Inb4 the NFL bans the Patriots to promote Super Bowl diversity and a healthy AFC postseason meta.

"New England has made the Top 6 of the AFC 9/10 times in the past decade, with 3 AFC Championship wins and 1 Super Bowl. We feel that Tom Brady is oppressive to lesser football teams, so we are banning the Patriots from postseason play effective immediately. We hope that this change will shake up the playoffs."

This is a strange list. Without the combo this deck doesn't look like it does anything. What are you CoCo/Chord-ing for without the combo? And why take out half of it but leave in the other half?
Interesting idea with Squadron Hawk/Infectious Bloodlust. Though I don't see how you can reasonably expect to draw into the combo without the amount of cantrips that Twin had. Have you considered [[Heliod's Pilgrim]]? I'm brewing a budget GW version with Presence of Gond, and although it takes 3 turns to play Midnight Guard -> Presence of Gond -> swing, I think it assembles the combo more consistently than RW and has a decent beatdown plan to boot (though I must admit, Squadron Hawk + Infectious Bloodlust sounds sweet).

Here's the list: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/midnight-presence-v2/

I'm using [[Hooting Mandrills]] as a budget Goyf and [[Congregation at Dawn]] as a replacement for CoCo/Chord. Mandrills also interacts extremely well with [[Commune with the Gods]], and a fun-of [[Altar of the Brood]] allows you to combo off the same turn you play Presence.
/u/xahhfink6 is trying to be nice about it, but the message between the lines is that this type of submission is not welcome on /r/spikes. This is why your post/comments are being downvoted.

It's actually standard for Japanese (and Chinese) students to apply to as few as 3 universities. Keep in mind that most universities require you to travel to take their entrance exam, either to their campus or to a testing location in a major city. It's not like the US where you have the SAT/ACT and a Common App that allows you to apply to 90% of schools in the country just by checking a box. The gap year is standard too; in Japan, that's what happens when you fail the entrance exam. Look up "roninsei" for a full explanation.

Not trying to discredit Tokido, but only applying to Todai is *definitely not* equivalent to only applying to Harvard and nowhere else.

Wow, this plus Twisted Image is really good. I have to admit I've been skeptical about SCM (heck, I just posted a comment a few minutes ago comparing it to Spellheart Chimera/Nivix Cyclops) but I am really hoping there's a home for him since I absolutely love this card.
True, Emerge Unscathed might work for you. The best part of Apostle's Blessing is that it'll get you through Affinity as well, but I suppose that depends on your local meta.

As for Assault Strobe, I think instant speed + trample is well worth the additional mana cost. Since your list isn't fast enough to kill on T2-T3, you'll likely need trample to get Kiln Fiend through blockers (and you also can't cast Assault Strobe on Geist's angel token). And since you have Geist, I also don't see double strike as a vital part of your game plan, unlike with Blistering Rage where the goal of the deck is to kill you with T1 Swiftspear/Weird, T2 pump to 9 power + double strike. Your deck has more time to draw into land.
I don't know how I feel about this list. I've been playing variants of SaffronOlive's Blistering Rage for several months now, and on the one hand this deck just seems like a less explosive version of that. On the other hand, it also seems much more robust after T3-T4. I chose to cut copies of pump spells and rituals in favor of countermagic and Artful Dodge, and I think this slowed down the deck too much to the point that it was impossible to (a) land a Kiln Fiend, (b) have enough mana/countermagic to protect it for 1-2 turns, and (c) have enough mana/gas to kill. Maybe your land base will help here, since as a budget player I was running mostly basic Islands/Mountains.

Here are some ideas/suggestions from my own experience:

1. Stubborn Denial is great if you're casting it with a Kiln Fiend on the board, and terrible with anything else (I run Delvers/Blistercoil Weirds). Consider [[Mizzium Skin]] if you're just looking to protect your creatures, or play "normal" countermagic instead (I would choose Remand).

2. Distortion Strike is worse than Artful Dodge IMO, and both are worse than the newly spoiled Slip Through Space. You'll need as many cantrips as you can get, because otherwise you will quickly run out of gas.

3. [[Apostle's Blessing]] is a spell that I am always happy to see in this kind of deck, serving double duty as protection and as a way to push damage.

4. Assault Strobe is one of my favorite cards, but I don't think you want it in this list. By the time you want to cast it, Temur Battle Rage will usually be a better card. I would cut it for Apostle's Blessing.

5. Once upon a time, I was convinced that [[Spellheart Chimera]] and [[Nivix Cyclops]] were perfect for my deck. My friend tried to tell me otherwise, but I was too full of myself to listen and kept jamming them whenever we played. Boy was I proven wrong. I don't like Stormchaser Mage, but it seems I am in the minority on this one.

...MadCatz.
He said this on day 1 IIRC. It was something about how Hoogland was so consistent in getting T1 Birds, and how his Birds were 8th edition foil, and basically jokingly insinuating that Jeff was cheating. The co-caster also chimed in with "Jeff Hoogland is a very powerful wizard" or something like that. Obviously poking fun, but still.
Do you think it's a good turn 2 play though? I'm still not convinced that it's a good followup to Swifty/Delver; IMO Serum Visions is a better play. And by turn 3 I'd rather be doing other things. What do you think?
I sure hope so, but right now it's looking like another [[Spellheart Chimera]]/[[Nivix Cyclops]] to me.
[](/yoaaa)sssss games
Just bought it a few weeks ago, immediately returned. It's not only boxy but the material also feels really thin and low quality (at least, it feels far worse than the Bayswater peacoat and skiff jacket I bought from J.Crew previously).
Yeah, but I play budget modern.
Really he should be doing 2 things: launch the Kickstarter sooner, and cut features in order to launch the game faster. He mentioned a bunch of features that have already been implemented (half of the 15 ways to kill, for example). These are the kinds of features he should be releasing in a patch *after* the base game has released, since they're a "more of x" type of feature rather than something entirely new.

The way he wants to make this game isn't how you do software development. There is always going to be another cool feature you want to add, and if I'm being honest I don't think he should have told us what he thinks the game needs to include before it can be considered ready. He's only digging himself into a hole by promising features that many players wouldn't have missed had they not known they were being planned.

The Dock peacoat is pretty darn long (not the guy you replied to, but I'm 5' 7"). A few years ago they sold a shorter model called the Bayswater with 6 buttons instead of 8, and that one was perfect for shorter guys. You may be able to find it on eBay still. If you wait until next season it's possible they might bring it back, but I wouldn't bet on it.

As someone who has put 1000+ hours into GW2, you may be interested in that game instead. It's the perfect MMO if you can only play for an hour at a time. /r/Guildwars2 is a great resource.
That's not the point, the point is that the Steelers and the Jets are fighting for the last wildcard spot and New England would rather face the Jets. Also the Pats have secured a bye but not home field advantage yet; they have to beat Miami to do so.

Edit: the winner of Bengals-Broncos tomorrow still has a chance to take the first seed if the Pats lose to the Dolphins.

Glad you figured it out. Here's a good video on making coffee with a Kalita: https://vimeo.com/42382657

Notice how he pours on the perimeter of the filter, but he never stays in one area for long enough to collapse the ruffles.
I'm assuming those filters are for the 155 instead of the 185. If so, they actually have slightly different shapes - the angle of the walls are steeper on the 155 than on the 185, which could possibly be what is causing the issue here.

If that's not the case, I can think of two other possibilities:

1. Are you pouring directly onto the filter walls at any time during your pour? This will cause the filter to deform since the white filters don't hold their shape as well as the brown ones. Try to keep your pour at least 1 cm from the ruffly part of the filter. As you get better at pouring, you'll find that it's possible (and even preferable) to pour directly onto the ruffles without deforming the filter (e.g., to wash down grounds that have been stranded at high tide) - but only if you move quickly around the perimeter of the filter to ensure an even pour.
2. Are you wetting the filter prior to adding the grounds? If so, try making it without pre-wetting the filter for the same reason as in (1) above. Anecdotally, I find that Kalita filters don't have nearly as much of a papery taste as V60 filters.

Finally, a general tip for pouring: try to keep the tip of your spout as close to the grounds as possible, at least at the beginning of every pour. This is key to maintaining an even pour with low turbulence.

Yeah it's not meant to be an exhaustive list, just the teams that were on my mind at the moment. I'd agree with Titan/mouz.
It's almost impossible to rank them in order without ties at this moment, especially with so many teams in a slump. Taking a cue from fighting games, my personal current tier list would be something like this:

S: Fnatic

A: EnVyUs

A-: Na'Vi, TQM, Virtus.pro

B: G2, Luminosity, NiP

B-: Titan

C+: Liquid, Renegades

C: Cloud9, CLG
85°C sounds pretty low. I'd try something closer to 90-95°C. Keep in mind that the coffee will cool to ~85°C by the time you're done brewing/pouring, at which point it'll be at the ideal drinking temperature. By the way, how fine are you grinding?
lol chill
Liquid really doesn't need allu when a player like koosta exists. Cloud9 and CLG are unlikely to want him because they already have Skadoodle and jdm, which should make him an easy pickup for a team like Liquid.

MNK specialization coming in the next expansion, calling it now
That's one of GW2's strengths: leveling "just happens" and doesn't feel at all like a chore, as long as you're exploring new areas and participating in dynamic events. It's also the number one thing that new players coming from WoW or FFXIV have a hard time grasping.

My biggest piece of advice is this: don't feel compelled to do hearts (quests in normal MMO parlance), because they're often tedious, they don't offer much in the way of lore or XP, and they pale in comparison to GW2's main lore/XP delivery mechanisms - exploration and dynamic events.
Yup, and that was pretty much the only BF-worthy deal last year, too.

Interesting start. You'll probably want [[Heliod's Pilgrim]] instead of the Hartebeest, and [[Commune with the Gods]] instead of Gather the Pack.

This is probably the best way to do it. It's essentially the 2-SUM problem, which can be solved in linear time.
Out of Elementalist/Ranger/Warrior/Thief, I did most of the difficult ones on Ranger/Warrior. I remember Glint's lair, the teragriff fight and the dragon fight took a long time for achievements, and I believe I used Warrior for the first and Ranger for the other two.
Same here, it was definitely worth it at $25. I do agree with /u/TurboFucked that it's boxy af though.

I was talking about the G2. I am quite satisfied with my fountain pens, and I don't use them on bad paper (that's what the Signos and Jetstreams are for).
These things skip like hell, write super fat lines and bleed through most papers. Never understood how they got so popular on AskReddit (actually now that I think about it, probably because they're widely available in the US). IMO, do yourself a favor and try some gel pens (Uniball Signo DX .38mm is my favorite, though some swear by Hi-Tec C's) or lubricated ballpoints (Uniball Jetstream 0.7mm, Pilot Acroball) from Jetpens and you'll never use a G2 again.
Maybe, but you can't really compare an old MMO's playerbase to those of competitive games like CS/SC. In an MMO you need content to keep players playing; in those games the competition is the content.
Tokyo is really big and the good coffee shops are spread all over the place. The only area with any real concentration of decent shops is Harajuku/Shibuya. If you go there, you can hit up Streamer Coffee (known for their latte art), Paddler's (pourover with Stumptown beans), Blue Bottle Aoyama, Omotesando Koffee, and The Roastery in a day trip. Plus the journey will take you on a walking tour of the area, which is a nice bonus :)

Like other people have said, do check out Bear Pond Espresso in Shimokitazawa if you get the chance. I don't really drink espresso but from what I've heard theirs is something special (in my opinion, it tasted like chocolate-covered shit). Their cappuccino is interesting as well but way too milky for me.

Cafe de L'Ambre in Ginza was strange. Drinks are way overpriced (I think my cafe latte was 800 yen), and they don't make cappuccino for some reason. I don't recommend it, but it's likely that I ordered the wrong thing.

Don't mind me, I'm just a GW2 player thinking about making the switch...
Don't get a Contigo; I've had several over the years and the plastic in the locking mechanism retains flavor. The Zojirushi retains flavor as well but to a much less noticeable degree. It also keeps coffee much hotter for much longer (maybe too hot).
I, too, can't wait for 2018.
Yeah, it's hard to tell just from the image but it's pretty clear if you watch the part in the video ([link]( https://youtu.be/Izk-xb37hwY?t=34m54s)).
They also showed Galileo and Dogura from 2014 Blazblue grand finals, better dust off your dakimakuras boys [](/Kappa)
That's not uncommon on Mirage. Teams will often send players to pick from A ramp/palace, mid, and B apps all at the same time. Then depending on which way the kills go, players can pick up the bomb from T spawn on the rotate.
The Five-SeveN's InaccuracyFire is much lower, so recoil resets faster making it easier to spam. And the Five-SeveN actually does more damage vs. armor than the P250.
Maybe if you can't aim. Five-SeveN über alles.
So? RNG feels rewarding, unlike tokens, and the drop rate for that particular item was reasonably high. Plus the event itself was fairly enjoyable and gave you other rewards besides. I think luminescent armor was a great example of how to do rewards in GW2.

You should try aligning the player model's head with the center of the image. It's especially noticeable in the two-color images (such as #13) that the weighting is off; that is, there is way more "stuff" on the left half of the image than the right. I realize you're centering by the image's bounding box, but it would look a lot better centered by visual perception instead.
Promo Serum Visions has in fact been animated many times. There are even live action reenactments ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Is it possible to replace the Lavamancers with something cheaper?
Definitely agree, $100 can certainly get you started in Modern. I built Blistering Rage and have been playing it for a few weeks. It's fun as hell when it works, but unfortunately it very rarely works. Scoops to T1 Inquisition/Thoughtseize, scoops to removal, usually gets outraced by Burn's Eidolon triggers with help from your own Mutagenic Growths/Git. Probes/Apostle's Blessings. Your decisions boil down to: should I play T2 Kiln Fiend and hope that it resolves, or wait until T3 holding up Dispel/Spell Pierce keeping in mind that you might be dead by T4? I love the idea behind the deck, but actually playing it is pretty boring (not to mention that it's not consistent at all).

To OP: from this list, Tempered Steel, Stompy and Burn seem like the most consistent options (nothing against combo - I'm a Johnny's Johnny, but it doesn't really work on a budget). While we're on the subject of budget brews, I'll also throw out a Mardu Tokens deck that I've been working on ([list here](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/27-09-15-lSw-mardu-tokens/)), but I have no idea if it's any good and you're probably better off picking one of the more established brews listed above.
There wasn't much he could have done given his team's positions and PSG's - just one teammate to work with who is himself covered by three players. You can see him thinking about the pass but another player was closing him down as well.

It is a full-length anime. It's just that the story arcs are short.
Yes you're right, I realize it wasn't your own opinion in the first place.
It's been mathematically proven that 7 riffles will sufficiently randomize a 52-card deck though ([Bayer and Diaconis '92](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/papers/bayer92.pdf)). Call it 8 if you're feeling superstitious, but there shouldn't be any talk about perspective when it comes to math.
Yes. After you declare blockers, those creatures may be tapped to activate abilities and will still count as blockers and deal/receive damage accordingly. Your opponent then receives priority to cast instants/activate abilities, after which priority is passed back to you. At this point you may use activated abilities or cast instants, and they will resolve before moving to combat damage.
They do taste different. The French press produces a cup with more body, so you'll taste the flavors of the roast more. You'll also get more sludge in the cup due to the coarseness of the metal filter. The Aeropress makes a cleaner cup with less body and more clarity that will bring out more of the bean's flavor. (Do note that I'm speaking relatively here; in absolute terms, I wouldn't really recommend the Aeropress if clarity is the goal - go for Chemex or V60 instead.)

One of the strengths of the Aeropress is that it's the Great Equalizer of coffee brewing methods: it can make your crappy, month-old Starbucks beans taste nearly as good as freshly roasted Yirgacheffe (maybe a bit of an exaggeration, but still). It's also not very finicky about your brewing technique, so if you don't care to measure your water/time your pours then it might be a good option for you. If you have no idea what I'm talking about but like your coffee "stronger" you'll probably prefer the French press, as it shines with darker roasts.

They're usually around the same price ($30), but I know cheaper/more expensive French presses do exist. Of course you'll need to buy new Aeropress filters eventually but it'll take you quite a while to run through them and they're cheap (like $5 for 350) anyway. So price is a bit of a wash.

I know you didn't ask about grinders, but if you're considering dipping your toes into the world of quality coffee it would behoove you to spend another $30-40 on a decent hand grinder. I've used a Hario Mini Mill for about three years and would definitely recommend it. Some other good, inexpensive grinders are the Hario Skerton and the Porlex JP-30.
No idea, but if you buy from Amazon they offer free returns on watches (and other fashion items IIRC). So coupled with free shipping, that's not a bad deal.

Is it the Ray that you're looking at by any chance? If so, I can send you pictures of it on my extremely small (6") wrist.
I can confirm that there have been several iterations of Uniqlo's OCBD: they've changed the fit, the collar, the thickness (F/W styles being thicker than their S/S counterparts), and I'm sure many more things that I'm not aware of. If you have the opportunity to try one on yourself that would be the best option.

Regarding alternatives: there aren't any other brands in the $20-30 price range that compete in terms of quality unless you can find J.Crew on sale (even then, J.Crew OCBDs seem to have a more casual texture than Uniqlo's, so they're not directly comparable). I would suggest looking at more expensive stores like Brooks Brothers, but that might not work if you're too slim.
Try Amazon or Long Island Watch, it's usually cheaper there anyway.
You will want to try them on for fit. Not sure about the Fulton, but the 484 can be rather tight in the thigh and has a low rise (which I prefer, but it's a matter of preference/body measurements).
And for those who are wondering if Dockers, BR, or Gap are worth it:

* Dockers has fallen in quality over the years. Their chinos have a history of premature fraying at the hem, and I wouldn't recommend them even at $30.

* BR Aidens are better and would be my pick if the extra $11 is an issue (alternatively, wait for a deeper sale on J.Crew, especially in-store). I have two pairs (one from three years ago, one from last year) purchased for ~$30 each and they have held up well. BR chinos have a more formal look to them though, and I much prefer J.Crew's fabric.

* Gap Lived-In chinos are garbage. Mine developed diaper bottoms after just a few months of wear, and the dye fades very quickly. The fabric feels cheap compared to BR/J.Crew. I got two pairs for $20 each and would not buy them again at that price.

I highly recommend J.Crew Essential/Sun-Faded chinos if you're looking for something casual. I've seen Essential/Sun-Faded chinos on sale in-store for $10-20 (no joke, the pair I bought two years ago was $20 tag - 50% off sale - 15% student discount = $8.50). An obvious pickup at that price, but I would buy them again at $41 considering the alternatives.
It would help if you posted your list...

Sweet Maria's is where we usually go. Lately we've been buying beans on eBay as well, but I'm not sure if that's generally recommended.
Looking forward to an update on this. Be sure to adjust your grind size/brew time accordingly!
If by kanji compounds you mean words like 元気, then yes. It doesn't make much sense to study individual characters by themselves because Japanese != Chinese.

I thought it was a good pace. Now that I think back it might have been 1.5 weeks for an entire chapter (vocab, grammar, content). We had class every day for an hour. I think if I were self-studying during the summer I could have gone much faster, say 2-3 chapters in a week, but alas Japanese takes a backseat to my other classes. And I'm not sure how much I would actually remember if I went much faster than 2 chapters/week (this is coming from someone who memorized 3500 SAT words in 7 days and promptly forgot all of them after the test).
I used Tobira in class so it may not be the response you're looking for, but we had to memorize every word in the vocab lists (hiragana <-> English) and we had a subset of words that we had to memorize (kanji -> English) and another smaller list for (kanji <-> English). AFAIK my teacher made her own lists and didn't follow Tobira's lists for bolded words, R/W, and R kanji. I think it was fine, as there are a lot of words in each Tobira lesson because there is the main lesson plus the two additional dialogues, so unless you have time to go through each lesson very thoroughly (we did about 1 a week) I would suggest you follow Tobira's lists.

But if you're self-studying and don't have other major time commitments, by all means go for it!
They really should just move the search bar below the dropdowns. That way you don't accidentally mouseover the dropdown menus on your way to and back from the search bar.

I'm trying to brew a budget version of Splinter Twin for Modern using [[Midnight Guard]] and [[Presence of Gond]]. I've got a rudimentary list [here](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/abzan-twin-1/), but it could definitely use some tweaking. Any ideas? I've seen some GW lists, but they were all straight combo that folds to any form of hand disruption, counterspells, or board wipes (the tokens generated by Presence of Gond don't have haste). I've added Black for hand disruption, removal, and everyone's favorite 4-mana 4/5 trampler. The plan is to go for the combo with Siege Rhinos as the backup plan, using [[Heliod's Pilgrim]] and [[Commune with the Gods]] to find Presence, O-Ring, Honor of the Pure, or Rhino depending on the situation.
Yep, the metal balls that the machine spits out are used as "tokens" for exchange into a novelty prize, which is in turn exchanged for cash at a separate building around the corner.

I just posted a comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/3nkjqe/kissshot_acerolaorion_heartunderblade_cosplay/cvp42mw) explaining the "heart under blade" part of her name. It's a literal description of the kanji in the verb *shinobu* (that is, the 忍 in 忍ぶ). 刃 = blade, and 心 = heart, so 忍 is quite literally a heart under a blade.

*shinobu* is a verb that means "to conceal oneself", as well as being the name of the character. The kanji 忍 is also used in *ninja* (忍者). As with many things regarding the Monogatari series, it helps to understand Japanese (and Japanese popular culture/urban mythology) to fully enjoy the show.
Just so you know, "heart under blade" is a literal description of the "shino" part of "shinobu" (忍ぶ). It's also the same kanji as the "nin" in "ninja" (忍者).

刃 = blade

心 = heart

刃 + 心 = 忍 = "heart under blade"

I tried Bear Pond and was pretty disappointed, but then again I'm not a huge espresso drinker. The cappuccino was way too milky though. I'll have to check out Maruyama and Arise next time.
Not OP, but some of my favorites were in Harajuku/Shibuya. **Streamer Coffee** has crazy latte art. **Paddler's** (the one above Todd Snyder) does a mean pourover and is to my knowledge the only shop in Japan that serves Stumptown beans. **Blue Bottle Aoyama** is, well, Blue Bottle. **Omotesando Koffee** was good but not great, and it had the longest line of them all. **The Roastery** by Nozy Coffee was perhaps my favorite of the bunch if only for the ambiance of the shop itself.

The best part is that all of these shops are situated within walking distance of each other, so you can hit all of them in a day while taking yourself on a nice little tour through the bustling streets of Harajuku/Shibuya.
It's not worth it. The intro pack gives you 1-ofs; you need playsets (that is, 4 copies) of the core cards in your deck if you want to have any semblance of consistency. Also, now is a really bad time to get into UR Artifacts, as most of the powerful cards in the deck (that /u/Krimsonmyst mentioned above) will be rotating out of Standard in two days.
Yeah, I kind of realized that after goldfishing a bit. How about Duress/Despise for hand disruption and [[Condemn]]/[[Devouring Light]]/Dismember for Path?
I was thinking either Dismember or something like [[Condemn]]/[[Devouring Light]].
There's Duress for Thoughtseize, as well as Despise (though Duress is usually a better imitation of TS).

Yeah, but the brand isn't seeing those margins. The manufacturer makes $5 when they sell it to the brand. The brand makes $17 when they sell it to the retailer. The retailer makes $66 when they sell it to you.
It was apparently Tokyu Plaza, according to Google Street View.
I was in Tokyo last week and did pretty much this. In case you wanted a second opinion, this is great advice, OP. (The polygon building isn't Tokyu Hands, but I don't remember what it was either.)

Edit: Off topic, but the Harajuku/Shibuya area is a coffee mecca in a city/country that doesn't really do coffee. My favorites were The Roastery (really close to RagTag Harajuku, which sells used clothes for cheap - think Grailed), Paddlers (the only place in Japan that serves Stumptown beans), STREAMER (known for their latte art), and of course Blue Bottle in Zucca Aoyama.
Similar experience as /u/Triddy, about 90-100 hours two years ago. Starting now, you will likely get there faster.
As a somewhat jaded veteran, I'm tired of them constantly fucking things up and "collecting feedback" after. It's been 3 years, people. Let's not pretend this is ANet's first rodeo. They've had more than enough time to gather data and figure out how to design an event that appeals to players, and it is baffling that they still manage to mess things up so badly.

If this is supposed to be an indication of what HoT is like, well... It's been a good 1000 hours, but I think I'm out.
This was me this morning. Making my usual cup of V60 with the same parameters as always, except at the end of the pour I accidentally added 15g more water than I intended. Took the V60 off with a bit of water still left in the cone and tasted the coffee - nope, still needs more water. So I poured in a bit from the kettle without measuring and somehow ended up with the best cup I've had in weeks.

It's all about perspective. M50s are great headphones for the average user, possibly the best most people will ever want or need. It's just that audiophiles have different utility curves than your average dude. And in the realm of enthusiast audio equipment, M50s are pretty low-tier.

The level 20 event you're referring to is very likely your next Personal Story chapter (it's a green star in the top right corner of your HUD). You're probably seeing it exactly because you 100%-ed your current map, so the game thinks there's nothing left to do in your area. There are certainly events to do and places to see before level 20, so head on over to another map and have fun!
Since you mentioned repeating quests I'm assuming you're talking about dynamic events and not hearts. If so, you can head over to other races' starting zones by taking a portal in Rata Sum to Lion's Arch and then another portal from there to another city. Alternatively, you can walk directly to the Sylvari starting zone (Caledon Forest) by going east of Hexane Regrade waypoint. To be honest at level 16 it's possible to venture into the level 15-25 zone anyway, the closest of which is Brisban Wildlands north of Muridian waypoint.

If you were in fact referring to hearts, then stop doing hearts (or at least don't actively seek them out) and start exploring/doing dynamic events instead. You'll find leveling much faster and easier.
Point taken!
Normally I wouldn't bring subtypes into the argument, but I think being a White Human Soldier can be relevant in the type of deck that would play a Savannah Lions or Elite Vanguard.

I also may or may not have known about the existence of Savannah Lions until 30 seconds ago...
To be fair the V60 also comes in a very nice ceramic white if you're not a fan of the plastic (I'm not). And I can tell you firsthand that there is a difference in taste, quite a large one in fact. This has more to do with the filters than the brewing vessels themselves though.

Maybe you can help me out since you seem pretty knowledgeable about FFXIV. How did you get used to the 2.5s GCD, and other stupid things like being rooted while casting skills? And the awful jumping/movement? I wanted to like FFXIV, but after playing GW2 for so long I've been spoiled by its combat system.
Holy shit, fetchable doublechecks? I'm so down.
Have you seen [this article](http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/budget-magic-57-7-tix-modern-blistering-rage)? It's an all-in take on Kiln Fiend combo, and it can kill with Monastery Swiftspear/Blistercoil Weird just as often as with Kiln Fiend. I think you should definitely add 4x Monastery Swiftspears, and also consider testing Delver in the one-drop slot. I've found that they really cannot coexist with Swiftspears in this deck, so you'll have to stick with one or the other.
On top of what /u/lolbifrons said, fetchlands also enable entire decks. Take a look at Zooicide: http://www.mtggoldfish.com/archetype/modern-zooicide-20758

What's your budget? I ask because some people's idea of budget is < $200, whereas others (myself included) define it as < $50. If you already have the manabase, UR Storm is pretty cheap to build. The only card above $10 would be Serum Visions, which is reusable in just about any deck that runs U. I think U Tron and Infect are also competitive and fairly cheap to build. I would ask again on /r/ModernMagic if you haven't done so already.
Hey, nice site. If I might make a suggestion, it would be nice if it didn't load the full image just to display a tiny 125px-wide thumbnail. The way it is now, [opening the link](http://i.imgur.com/hrZvPTd.png) takes around 4-5 MB already, and [scrolling down just a few times](http://i.imgur.com/ytqI3df.png) quickly ups the data usage to 30 MB+. (For comparison, Facebook uses ~2 MB on load and takes a metric crapton of scrolls to go beyond 5 MB. And yes, I tested with caching disabled.)

Even with the lazy loading scheme you implemented, loading full-size images just eats up data so quickly. I'm not really an expert on this kind of stuff, but I feel like it should be possible to downscale the images before displaying them. At least for imgur, there's [this trick](https://thomas.vanhoutte.be/miniblog/imgur-thumbnail-trick/), but it's not exactly what you want anyway.
Yup, you and I have been saying it (and getting downvoted) for months: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2xg4jl/the_esl_arena_to_bring_guild_wars_2_to_pax_east/cp067li?context=10000

ANet, stop trying to make e-sports happen. Make PvP a competitively viable gametype and the e-sports will take care of itself.
Fair enough. As for Dismember, you wouldn't be casting it for 1BB. It's Phyrexian mana, so you can cast it for 1 and 4 life instead. This allows you to play more enchantments on your turn instead of having to leave 3 mana open for Unmake.
For burn, Guttersnipe is incredibly slow and not worth the mana cost (that's 3 Bolts!), plus it's extremely fragile and dies to just about any kind of removal. I've tried brewing with Guttersnipe, [[Impact Tremors]], [[Young Pyromancer]], [[Burning Vengeance]], [[Empty the Warrens]], etc. and came to the conclusion that it just wasn't promising. Perhaps you will have better luck.

By the way, Ponder is banned in Modern, for what it's worth.
Not a Bogles expert, but I guess I'll chime in with my thoughts anyhow:

* I'm not sure about running 4x Spider Umbra and only 3x Hyena Umbra. I think Hyena Umbra is generally a much better card.

* I don't agree with Battle Mastery here. You don't need double strike since Bogles is already pretty fast, and by turn 3 your opponent probably has blockers on the field. [[Unflinching Courage]] would be a better choice for the trample.

* It's hard to play without Path to Exile, but I think [[Dismember]] will usually be a better replacement than Unmake, especially for the mana cost.

Also, since you mentioned budgets you might be interested to know that Bogles is commonly built on budgets of $50-75. The list looks pretty different and the deck is less competitive as a result, but unless you're trying to enter tournaments more serious than an FNM you'll probably be fine.

Finally, it would behoove you to read this excellent primer on Bogles: http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/modern/developing-competitive-modern/220251-g-w-auras-bogle
That's only $12k if I'm reading it correctly. Won't get you shit in terms of labor or R&D, but it's a paltry sum to pay for the opportunity to advertise to what I can only assume is a target customer segment.
I mean there's already Linux Mint, so I'd be very surprised if they went with it to be honest.
I wouldn't get too hung up on flying as an idea to build an entire deck around. It's a good ability but not really necessary/worth it, and you may be leaving out good creatures in favor of the "theme" of *Flying Combat Tricks: The Deck*. If you have limited resources, I would prioritize good creatures over themes/ideas, since in casual Magic it's usually the creatures that will win you the game. If you haven't read it already, here's a great article about how to go about building a new deck: http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/rc/255

The deck as it is has way too many one- and two-ofs to reach any kind of consistency. Most decks look more like [this](http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/28-07-15-ur-blitz/), with multiple three- and four-ofs of each card to minimize randomness, but I understand that you don't have a large card pool to work with. Unfortunately it'll be hard to make proper suggestions for improving your deck without knowing what kind of cards you have access to.

By the way, four of the cards in your deck are worth actual money: Noble Hierarch ($30), Temple Garden ($8), and 2 Path to Exiles ($9 each). These are buy prices, so keep in mind that you won't get nearly as much for each card should you sell them, but it's something to think about. Take good care of them, or sell them and buy an entire deck with the cash :)
That's assuming they didn't go for the raid boss play.
That's harmony, not wisdom.
Try searching for variations of "ganbatte".
Most decks like this are either mono-red or splash either G or U depending on which direction you want to go. Here is a similar deck built around prowess/double strike: http://www.mtggoldfish.com/articles/budget-magic-57-and-7-tix-blistering-rage-for-modern

Here's my take on it: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/28-07-15-ur-blitz/

Besides the double strike and pump spells, the most important card in this deck would have to be [[Desperate Ritual]]. This is what allows the deck to hit turn 2-3 kills. [[Gitaxian Probe]] is another very strong card in this deck because it serves 3 purposes: (1) it's a free prowess trigger, (2) it's a cantrip, and (3) it tells you when it's safe to go all in with your pump/double strike spells. I would find a way to run 4 of these.

If you're going blue, I suggest playtesting [[Gitaxian Probe]], [[Delver of Secrets]], [[Artful Dodge]], [[Shadow Rift]], and [[Vapor Snag]]. Depending on your meta, you may also want to swap out the bolts for [[Gut Shot]].

There is absolutely nothing wrong with this. Like /u/radeon9800pro said, this is how you grow the scene. Every region should be represented, but regions with generally better teams should get more spots. It's the same concept as in the UEFA Champion's League and the World Cup - stronger regions get more teams, but every region gets at least one. It's good for viewership, it's good for the metagame, and it's good for the smaller regions who don't get to face off against the top European teams week in and week out.
How can you fire the co-owner anyway? He's working at JP Morgan, so I assume with 80+ hour workweeks he won't have much time for much writing beyond the occasional op-ed.
That may not be as true as you think, at least not in the near-ish future. According to various metrics Starbucks owns only 25-30% of the specialty coffee segment, with Dunkin another 15%. That leaves 55-60% of the market up for grabs with the likes of Blue Bottle, Stumptown, Peet's, Sightglass, Fourbarrel, etc. competing for dominance. (Blue Bottle in particular seems very promising - they recently closed a $70M Series C to bring their total investment to $115M.)

VCs are now comparing Blue Bottle and Stumptown to the likes of Shake Shack and Jamba Juice. Coffee is heating up, and I'm excited to see which of our favorite roasters become major mainstream players in the next few years.
Some of the water will be retained in the filter (up to 50g depending on the amount of coffee), so there actually is quite a large difference. I believe that weighing the amount of water poured in is the correct way to measure brew ratio. Weighing just the output would leave you with coffee that is weaker than intended.
But he goes to Rutgers...
That's the whole point of seeding. It's to give the highest seeded teams the best chance possible to reach the final - it's good for viewership, because as an event organizer you don't want the top teams eliminated until the later stages of the tournament.

Edit: I just read your other comment. I agree on having pots; having an event without a group stage would be way too fast. It would also be cool to ensure that teams from the same country don't face off against each other in the groups, like with the UEFA CL pots.
Probably less about you and more about other users like you. I'd be surprised if it wasn't based on some sort of collaborative filtering.
Fair enough, I can see how that would be annoying. Some players (myself included) want to playtest their budget paper decks online, so even if money isn't an issue online it's a moot point because the end goal is paper. For example, it would be pointless for me to play Snapcasters on Cockatrice if I can't afford them IRL.
I play UR Aggro/Combo, so this is actually really helpful for me to test how resilient my deck is against removal/counterspells. Playing as if my opponent knows my hand (but I don't know theirs) is sometimes more useful than testing against a live opponent, but it probably wouldn't work for a more interactive deck.
What's wrong with janky brews...
But even in video games silencers usually make damage falloff more severe...
This is interesting. If they do go this route, I'd like to see decreased damage (either in the form of lower armor penetration, lower damage, or lower dropoff distance) as the nerf for the A1-S. Intuitively this is what we've come to expect from silencers in video games (see CoD, BF, etc.), and this would also make the decreased ammo count more relevant. I don't think the AUG should be buffed too much though, since the M4/AK are the iconic weapons of CS.
I think you replied to the wrong person. I'm in favor of color accuracy, which is why I prefer LCD.
Except LCD screens generally have much better color accuracy...
What do you mean? There's a white monochrome version in his link. Isn't that basically what you're describing?

The search function sucks though. Protip for anyone trying to search a subreddit: enter "site:reddit.com/r/mySubreddit mySearchQuery" into Google instead of using Reddit's built-in function.
So between a new X100S for $900 and a new X100T for $1300, do you think the X100T is worth the extra $400?
I'm not gonna lie, the story is pretty shit. If you're coming from SWTOR, you'll be disappointed if you play GW2 for the story/main quest line. It's not SWTOR, it's not FFXIV. The Personal Story sucks donkey dick compared to ARR's MSQ. GW2 has a great world and rich lore but you're not going to like it if you're relying on quests to lead you through that world. You'll have to do some exploring on your own. Try to take a step back, slow down, and take it all in. I think you'll enjoy the game a lot more that way.
Cheers Geoff.

Same here. Just because it's "stupid" doesn't mean it's not fun. Most casters are so hung up on being professional like "real" sports casters that they forget that it's a game, it's supposed to be entertaining. Not everything has to be taken so seriously. I remember thinking stuff like "oh my god, are you fucking serious, this is the most retarded shit I've ever seen" when I first watched him. Now that I've lightened up I think the James Bond bit is hilarious. I get way more laughs out of Rahim than I do out of even JZFB + DDK. Rahim is an exciting caster and he knows how to play the game, which isn't something that can be said about every caster out there. I've played/watched this game long enough that I've come to prefer comedy/fun/balloons to casters that spew play-by-play information (which is frankly obvious to anyone who's paying attention), and Rahim provides it in spades.
*I AM THE BONE OF MY SWORD*
Personally, I didn't think it was worth it. I'm sure others disagree, but something about the pacing (and the story/writing in general) felt off, and I didn't care for the new characters (protagonists and antagonists both).
I just read the paper. I don't know where the claim that "Glicko-2 rating can't be expressed as a single number" came from, because while it's technically true, it is rather misleading. It is expressed as 3 numbers, but even 1 number will do. Wall of text incoming:

The difference between Elo and Glicko-2 is that Elo consists of a single number describing an expected performance level, whereas Glicko-2 outputs a 95% confidence interval and a volatility rating indicating the stability of that player's rating in recent games. For example, the Glicko-2 model allows you to discern the difference between two players who have similar *average* skill but exhibit different peak/low performance levels. Say that under the Elo system two players (call them, I don't know, n0thing and Hiko) are both rated at 2500. Then on average, both players would be expected to put up similar performances against any given list of opponents. Unfortunately, this rating doesn't give us any insight into how stable this 2500 rating is: maybe n0thing can beat the likes of olofmeister or GTR on some days but also drops games against m0E occasionally, while Hiko's performance is more predictable. Here's where Glicko-2 is helpful: it includes a volatility measure, which is a number, calculated for each player, representing the expected fluctuation in the performance rating for that player. Thus each player's performance stability can be captured and quantified, and we can easily see if one or the other has been having erratic performances. The fact that the rating is expressed in an interval also helps; since that interval is designed such that there is a 95% chance that your "true" rating is contained within the interval, the smaller the interval is, the more consistent the player is.

Anyway, if we wanted to display a single number based on Glicko-2 rating, we would simply take the expected value of the rating interval. In fact, the interval is calculated by adding two times the rating deviation on each side of the expectation, [which is of course how we get our 95% confidence interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68%E2%80%9395%E2%80%9399.7_rule) in the first place. If Valve wanted to get fancy and display the interval instead, I don't see why they couldn't. Just add a "?" on the rating interval with an explanation on hover.

The other number that I mentioned earlier (the volatility measure) is used to calculate changes to the rating and deviation, but for the sake of displaying a rating it's not necessary. Valve could display "Low/Medium/High" volatility if they really wanted to, but I don't see the point.

**TL;DR:** Elo gives a single number. Glicko-2 gives a range and a volatility index (3 numbers in total) but can display just a single number if need be.

[NA qualifiers are Aug 1-2.](http://www.esl-one.com/csgo/cologne-2015/qualifier/)
Always rated him.^oops ^this ^isn't ^/r/soccer

On a serious note, I've been watching him a long time as well and this series and his 1v4 B site hold on Dust2 in particular reminded me of similar moments that brought shroud and tarik to mainstream notice. Shroud with his 1v5 A site hold on Nuke while playing for Manajuma, and tarik's infamous cereal clip on Dust2 under mouseSpaz. Both players got picked up by large organizations shortly thereafter and hopefully the same will be true for koosta. Fingers crossed for a new NA shuffle!
I'm glad they have to face NiP/TSM/Fnatic in a BO3. All three are strong on Mirage/Inferno, and as a Cloud9 fangay, getting bopped repeatedly on their weak maps is going to give them so much data to prepare for Cologne. They already have that Cobble/Cache/Overpass tech against nV and Na'Vi, let's see them download a top team on Mirage/Inferno!
/r/globaloffensive literally unreadable^Kappa
How do players in gaming houses play together then? Would using separate routers fix the issue? I'm having the same problem as OP, and I find it ridiculous that I can't play with my roommate because Valve thinks I'm multiboxing.
This is only true of Japanese AFAIK. Chinese does in fact distinguish between L and R.
Are you using RES? It's possible that it hasn't been updated yet to reflect the change. In fact, one of the RES guys (/u/andytuba) mentioned in the top comment in the thread above that he was looking into it.

I don't think I've ever seen a 1lb bag. Granted, I buy my coffee in-store as opposed to online, but I've been to a variety of coffee shops in the past three years, from the Stumptowns of the world to small independent roasters in my college town. Every time it's been 12oz (which, I might add, is a perfect size for me).
Jesus, how do you play with 90 ping? Don't you ever notice the lag between you killing someone and the kill showing up on the feed? It's especially noticeable with AWP kills.
The closest thing I've seen to Shokugeki no Souma is [No Game No Life](http://myanimelist.net/anime/19815/No_Game_No_Life). The main characters are pretty similar in terms of personality and natural talent (heck, they're even voiced by the same VA), and the concept of shokugeki is  very similar to the games played in NGNL. Honestly, the more I see of SnS the more I'm convinced that it's a ~~weird~~ awesome mashup of NGNL and Kill la Kill.

If you haven't seen it yet, definitely give NGNL a try. The other recommendations posted here are good too, but IMO they lack a certain unbridled ridiculousness that is a pretty essential part of Shokugeki no Souma, and this is something that NGNL offers in spades.
Ah, I suppose I should check my American privilege huh :P
Isn't the Encore always $130?
None of them had kits.
KennyS is nowhere near the top 5 anymore. IMO, in the post-nerf era GuardiaN is the best in the world by a mile and a half.
I have a V60 but no range server. Am I correct to assume that it's not worth it if I only brew for one person (myself)?
There's another Birch by 27th and Madison. Good espresso drinks and great service (the barista remembered my name from day one), but they don't do pourover.
Was going to post a response but /u/keikomystere hit the nail on the head. Let me emphasize: the cash shop in this game is entirely cosmetic/convenience items - if you were looking for pay2win items à la F2P games, you'll be sorely disappointed. I strongly suggest you wait until you hit lvl 80 before deciding what to spend your money on, because you'll have a much better understanding of what you actually want by then.
To add on, BB has to constantly compete with Persona for the EVO spot because the powers that be decided having both, plus Xrd and Mahvel, would be 4anime4evo.

Someone's been playing a little too much Heavensward...
[Just for you.](http://i.imgur.com/7tIfvSs.png)
Same here. I don't find the Longbow build very interesting, because it's essentially the same build that Brazil recommended several months ago, and it boils down to spamming 1 after you use up your cooldowns. What time period are you testing over? The Longbow build frontloads damage in the initial burst, which is especially helped by Quickening Zephyr. The Remorseless build doesn't use Quickening Zephyr IIRC and should theoretically sustain DPS much better in longer fights thanks to Maul.
If that video was done by Brazil, then yes, it's meant to be a joke :P
So the rotation is still basically Barrage > Rapid Fire > Path of Scars > 1111111111111, with extra pet swaps/Path of Scars thanks to the new traits.

I'm kind of disappointed because I find the Remorseless build much more fun, and I was hoping for some variation in the new meta :(
Aeropress for sure. You already have a V60 anyway, and it's far more similar to the Chemex than the Aeropress so that would be my recommendation even if you weren't traveling.
It's not a joke. You don't need to operate the drill at high speed; in fact, you'll need more torque than speed anyway. I do this at home and the handle spins at about the same speed as if I were grinding by hand - it's just easier.
Actually, we 1500 range now :)
Perhaps - I haven't done the math, but I like Pyromancer's Training because I cast Ice Bow 4 in Fire (although I suppose it's better to take Piercing Shards and cast in Water these days), and I like the reduced cooldown on Fire 2/3/4. I run Flame Legion runes, so maybe I should consider speccing for condi damage...
Yes, it's pretty similar to the meta build, but I take Fresh Air instead of Bolt to the Heart, and I take more defensive options in Water because I'm bad at maintaining the Scholar's bonus.

Here is a link to the build: http://intothemists.com/calc/?build=-o;4BJF5-95NNkY0;9;4032;0036247046;9;9;0knF6s

I start with the same rotation as you (note: you can cast 2 before 4 to maximize the duration of your fire field), but then I switch to Air to proc Lightning, cast 2+3, switch to Earth, cast 4+5 to stack might, cancel the 5 channel, autoattack until Fresh Air procs, switch to Air for Lightning again, cast 2, cast Glyph of Storms in Air, and autoattack until I can switch back to Fire.

I'm surprised you don't think Air is pretty; I absolutely love the lightning animations haha. Especially proccing Lightning, then casting 2+3+Glyph of Storms is one of my favorite things in the game.
They did for a time, but it's probably been out of the meta for a while - I haven't been keeping up because I have a lot of fun with Fresh Air. I don't find Lightning Hammer very interesting :/
According to Dekeyz, scepter builds don't use Fresh Air anymore which makes them unfun for me :( I really wish they hadn't made Bolt to the Heart a grandmaster, but I suppose it had to be done.

Ranger is so much fun right now. The Remorseless build makes me feel like a thief, which I kinda like. Wish they hadn't nerfed pet swap though.

Thief feels really good as well, but I suppose P/P thieves might be a bit unhappy with the trait changes. Overall I'm really happy with the new builds, even though my main had to switch to staff to keep things interesting.
"Guardian is in a good place right now."
We're not counting 1-9 though, just 1-3. For example,

>blood -- up, up, down.

>death magic -- middle, middle, down.

>soul reaping -- middle, middle, up.

becomes

>blood -- 113

>death magic -- 223

>soul reaping -- 221
No problem, what a world it would be if we could get 7M viewers for a GW2 announcement :P
Yep, although I should note that my 5-7k figure was specifically for the http://www.twitch.tv/guildwars2 channel. I can't remember the exact figure for the PC Gaming Show, but it was definitely < 200k.
That was 7 million total channel views. Concurrent viewers was around 5-7,000.
I think most people at this point have convinced themselves that it will be warhorn based on the new Ascended Warhorn datamined [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/3aug92/datamining_upcoming_features_from_the_june_22/). Ever since the name was announced, I have had a theory (that I'm sure is shared by many) that Tempest will allow us to use skills from multiple attunements at the same time, and the new Tempest art seems to support that theory. How exactly that will be implemented is anyone's guess, but based on their claim that profession mechanics would be drastically changed with the addition of elite specs, I think they will either (a) remove/reduce* the ability to swap attunements, or (b) give us a new F5 skill that combines attributes from the two other specializations we choose besides Tempest (for example, a Tempest/Fire/Air ele might summon a fiery tornado and gain might/fury, while a Tempest/Water/Earth ele might get to cast a support-oriented spell that grants regen/protection).

(*: One way to do this would be to combine certain attunements into one skill bar. For example, we might have Fire/Air on one "weapon set" and Earth/Water on swap, and F1-F4 might change to resemble the Guardian's virtues with their passive/active abilities.)

These are just some half-baked ideas that have been running through my head, so hopefully others can share their thoughts as well!
I was really surprised when I saw it. They should have just changed it to "Rampage" à la the Halo multiplayer announcer if they wanted a shout IMO.

I see music kits have made their way out of CS:GO and into GW2 :P
Ice Bow usage remains the same and likely will not change post-patch: 4, 3, drop. 3 is getting a 25% damage buff. 5 is situational as before. Don't use FGS: they fixed 4 a long time ago and it will still be useless post-patch despite a 60% damage buff.

I actually AWP better on a slightly (~15%) higher sensitivity than what I rifle at because the flicks feel more natural. Switching between the two is kind of a hassle though so now I just set my zoom sensitivity slightly higher.
That's been happening to me too on my PC, but my Mac has had no problems so far. IIRC it's a problem with corrupt user data (usually cookies). Do you get the notification that Shockwave Flash has crashed when you kill the process?
You should control it until it's below your knees and then let it "drop". That is to say, don't actually let go of the bar, but don't resist too much. Just let gravity do most of the work. The reason for this is to avoid back injury and to conserve energy for your next rep.
Except...after you get to the top of your lift there is no "form" to maintain; as /u/SonVoltMMA said, there is no negative portion for deadlifts. Better to keep adding weight and let it drop to the floor than deload just so you can control it on the way down for little benefit.
Oh sure, I'm certain that there's little ill will between citizens of both countries, save for the select racist/xenophobic few. What I mean is that the governments themselves don't operate on terms like "friendship", which is a concept reserved for interpersonal relationships.
> that brief period from about 1920-1945

More like that brief period from about 1853-1945. From the start the shogunate was not exactly thrilled to receive envoys of Western diplomats, having seen what Britain did to China in the Treaty of Nanjing. Hell, the [main guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ii_Naosuke) who signed the Harris Treaty to open up 5 ports to American trade was assassinated just a few years later. Add to that the [sonnō jōi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonn%C5%8D_j%C5%8Di) movement and the general resentment toward Westerners that most samurai held, and it becomes pretty clear that Japan was not exactly on good terms with the US since the very beginning.
It's not that Japan and the US are friends. It's more that it's mutually beneficial for both governments to be in a political alliance, given that both Japan and the US need allies in Asia primarily due to the threat of China's rapid growth.
I know what the spray pattern looks like. Your test is biased toward the AK because that's what the spray pattern looks like for the first 8 bullets (pull straight down). For the SG you have to pull down and to the left, but it's no more random or difficult than the AK if you practice the pattern.
It's not a theory lol. The SG has better first shot accuracy than the AK as well, but let's not even get into that. You tell other people to check the weapon script data and then choose to ignore it when it turns out you were wrong. I'm sorry that you think reddit gold novas don't know how the game works, because clearly you have no clue either.
Sure, I'll concede that a burst/half-spray is easier with the AK. But a full spray is much easier with the SG than the AK IMO.
You're wrong dude. Do you have any idea how armor penetration works? You multiply the damage value by the penetration rating to get damage vs. armored opponents.



 | AK-47 | SG 553
---|---|----
Damage | 36 | 30
Armor Penetration | 0.775 | 1.0
Damage vs. Armor | 27.9 | 30

The SG does more damage vs. armor than the AK, except in the leg (which isn't covered by armor).
Lol what? It's not ass at all, in fact I'd say it's even easier than the AK spray pattern. It's literally an upside-down 7.
Shh, don't question the madness.
...This makes a lot of sense. Thanks for spotting that, I haven't run with TTS in like a year :P

I think the IGL part is the only part I would disagree with. As you say, Titan does every role better, but in this case I think Ex6tenZ is far better than sgares, whereas the level of the players in the other roles are much closer.
The first time I heard you cast for ESEA I was sure the voice sounded familiar but didn't belong to one of their usual casters (though I did at first think it was EGAD talking unusually fast). Needless to say I was very surprised to see your face when they showed the casters. It certainly makes sense; focusing on a scene as small as GW2 PvP would be foolish when CS:GO is growing fast and needs quality casters. As a CS:GO fan and avid watcher of CEVO/ESEA, CS:GO is lucky to have you. Best of luck!
As a CLG CS fan, yes they definitely have.
Hey I took [that screenshot!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2v0m31/poi_hot_gameplay_livestream_notes/code6cw) :) although it looks like someone rehosted it for some reason.

I think /u/Kapper-WA's idea (that F2 will only use 1 adrenaline bar and F1 will use all 3) is pretty likely. The adrenaline bar is already pretty similar to super meters in Street Fighter and other fighting games, so why not give us EX moves too?

It's a closed beta. It's by definition not made for the benefit of players, but so devs can test their work and receive feedback before releasing it. The point of this whole drop-based invite system isn't to let everyone have a fair chance at "getting in", nor is it to "force" you into playing content you don't like. It's purposely designed to be biased toward selecting players who (a) have level 80 characters, (b) play the most current PvE content, and (c) play it *a lot*. Might I remind you again that this whole closed beta thing is primarily for the purpose of receiving valuable feedback, which the above-mentioned type of player is far more likely to give than someone who by your own admission dislikes Dry Top and the Silverwastes. It **is not** made just for you to try the new content. Stop being so fucking selfish.
It applies to all bags that drop loot according to your level. This includes all champ bags. You want to be at a level where salvaging cloth gear gives linen. I believe this occurs from the high 40s to the mid-high 50s, but you can check the wiki to make sure. I currently use a lvl 57 alt.

I've seen this comment chain too many fucking times in the last 24 hours. Why don't we all stop debating/rating/speculating/hating/masturbating and let the players play? I really don't think hiko is going to sit out another season especially with the new ESL/ESEA Pro League, so we'll find out soon enough who was right and who sucks cocks.
Thieves are actually the fastest class for long distance races. It relies on clever use of steal, but they outpace warriors on most maps. Elementalists aren't even in the conversation.

In-combat mobility is a whole different situation, of course. Elementalists and thieves have many sources of mobility, while warriors are fairly limited. I think OP would enjoy elementalist the most, followed by thief based on a mix of mobility/shininess/sheer number of buttons to press.
Dunno if I'd call an argyle sweater fire. Hyouka fits are cool though.
There is no actual notification when you "unlock" OW. The case will just come, and you will see something like this: http://www.gamerqq.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014-02-06_00001.jpg
A large notification will show up on the main screen above the cases/keys/music kits. It's hard to miss.
The reason why VAC needs so much time is because you need quite a bit of data to be able to find the patterns that predict exploitative behavior in memory access. Keep in mind that cheat detection requires both a low false positive rate *and* a high true positive rate in order to be effective while at the same time not flagging legitimate players by accident. This requires a *lot* of training data, and it also requires test data (which presumably comes in part from overwatch).

TL;DR: cheat detection is very sensitive, and data analysis takes time.
The tweet in question: https://twitter.com/nihilumflowsicK/status/592773682277314560

I'm disappointed to be honest. Nihilum looked really strong at ESEA, and I was hoping this roster would escape unscathed. GL to the boys nonetheless.
What is he switching to? H1Z1? lol
Why does everyone keep mentioning adreN? Hiko has been taking on the IGL role lately, and adreN hasn't been IGL of a team for a long time. He isn't as good as Skadoodle in terms of awping, nor is he worth a damn with rifles compared to the other players Hiko could take. IMO if adreN leaves Liquid it will be because CLG wants him over fl0m as an awper/backup strat caller with FNS, in which case fl0m will go to Liquid.
Pretty sure he had fnatic 2-1 NiP, then switched to 2-0 after the first map

I mean I like your analysis Dust, but could you please condense your thoughts before posting them? Don't wanna bitch about it too much but a lot of your videos are over 20 minutes and I feel like you could get your points across more concisely.
FNS is the IGL. I'm not sure if ptr is the captain (or if CLG even have one), but it's possible for teams to have both an IGL and a captain. Take a look at NiP or Cloud9 for instance: fifflaren used to be captain of NiP, while n0thing is captain of C9.
Pics?
Check out Macy's Bar III, it's the only slim line they carry and is pretty decent for the price. I believe Dappered has done a review on it if you want to take a look. JCP Stafford is not that great, nor is Express. I would avoid BR unless you can get their monogram line. J.Crew Ludlow is a good but more expensive option if you can find it in store (not every J.Crew carries suiting).
Except, you know, that was with two stand-ins. One of which was the IGL. Roca is a consistent performer on eLevate and I hope he gets a serious look for hiko's new team, but I doubt it since he's young.
I'm talking about the default speed - it used to be slow even in the beta version, but not this slow.
I wouldn't call it drapey per se; it's not long, just boxy (on me). Uniqlo's Supima line is pretty slim, even slimmer than the old Premium Cotton line they used to carry, so I suppose it depends on your body dimensions.
This new version is new even compared to the beta version (which I was using just yesterday). The kanji stroke animations in the beta version used to be faster, and they used to be the same style as the diagrams, so I think the new speed is just an artifact of changing to the paint brush style. I suspect they will increase the speed because it is hilariously slow now.
I have both. The first one looks good on its own but also fits tight enough to be worn as an undershirt. The second one fits tighter/longer with shorter sleeves and is much softer. So to answer your question, yes, it's certainly versatile enough.

I love both of these shirts though, so I would try to pick up a pair of the second option if/when they go on sale. They are comfy af. Avoid the dry packaged shirts; they fit boxier and don't feel quite as nice besides.

Also, I was curious myself as to which was lighter, so I weighed them both on my coffee scale. The first one is 122.8g and the second one 107.6g. So the second shirt is ~12% lighter, FWIW.

> The FGC is one of the last places where offline is the primary focus

I can't speak for other games, but for CS:GO LAN results are the only things that matter. Sure there are online leagues like ESEA and FACEIT that run games daily, but the viewership is nothing compared to major offline events like DreamHack and ESL. And even those online leagues are just to determine who gets to attend the actual LAN playoffs at the end of the season.

> not just for a small handful of top sponsored teams flying out to a few LANs each year, tons of us get together at tournaments all that time

I agree with the rest of your point though; it is certainly true that for the average CS:GO/LoL/DotA player the concept of participating in offline play simply does not exist. Whether it is good or bad that fighting games are primarily played offline (even by amateur players) is another topic entirely. Maybe it is good for the community aspect. But it is definitely terrible for sustained growth and longevity in 2015 and beyond.
It looks good to me, but what does that matter to you? Is it getting you a better conversion rate? Have you done any A/B testing?

You're assuming a uniform distribution of color on maps. Personally, I use light blue with a black outline because it stands out more than white and it contrasts well with *most* backgrounds that you'll find in game, far better than green IMO. Unless you're staring at the sky, not many things are light blue in CSGO. Some people use pink/purple/magenta for a similar reason. In the end it boils down to personal preference really.
Adding flamie could elevate their game to cloud nine and beyond, but starix sympathizers are in denial. Sure, it might go counter to conventional gaming logic to kick the founder of the team, but starix has been rather dull in recent performances whereas flamie has been shining with the luminosity of sapphire. flamie's playstyle is also much more dynamic and liquid compared to starix's, and he could be just what Na'Vi needs to catapult them to mythic results.

Really? I've watched almost every Invite match in the past two months and have not seen RUSH step it up at a consistent level. Roca is the clear choice from eLevate. The general public seem to think ELiGE has a lot of potential, but I don't think he's consistent enough to make an NA superteam. I would choose hiko, skadoodle, shroud, roca/tarik, and an IGL that fits. Whether that's adreN or sgares or FNS/ptr or Doublelift, I don't know.
You're wrong. The first Tec-9 buff and CZ nerf occurred simultaneously in the 7/1/14 Operation Breakout update: http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/29mblv/in_depth_analysis_of_7114_updates_weapon_and/

This was a huge buff for the Tec-9 and a minor nerf to the CZ. Prior to this update the Tec-9 had much more recoil and took far longer to reset in accuracy, with moving accuracy just on par with the Five-SeveN. One important Tec-9 buff, the reset time, would be patched the following day: http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/29pe0b/csgo_blog_070314_release_notes_for_722014/

But they left the moving accuracy unchanged, which many (including myself) made noise about: http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/29pe0b/csgo_blog_070314_release_notes_for_722014/cin6xgp

Of course I received plenty of downvotes from naysayers. The Tec-9 later received another buff to accuracy reset time. At this point several people had noticed just how powerful the weapon was, and with the accuracy nerfs the CZ was getting, many switched their T-side pistols to the Tec-9 because of how well its ridiculous moving accuracy complemented T-side rushes. On CT most still stuck with the CZ, opting to use it at close-medium ranges instead of tapping Terrorists' heads off at range like they could pre-Breakout. Fast-forward 5 months to December, when the CZ was finally nerfed to the ground and the Tec-9 (temporarily) buffed once again:
http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/2oy7v3/analysis_of_weapon_changes_from_december_10th/

So no, it was not always a strong pistol. Prior to 7/1 the Tec-9 was nowhere near as useful as it would later become, and with all of the additional buffs it received along the way many players caught on well before the final CZ nerf last December.
I too thought KeyD would win. I don't think the majority of people knew that CLG had been scrimming and losing against KeyD in the runup to Katowice, since you would really only know if you watched tarik's or ptr's stream. The win over HR probably helped skew the betting even further. Once I saw KeyD > HR in the first loser bracket match, I knew the dream was dead :(
I'm not familiar with that brand, so I can't help you much there unfortunately. I have heard generally good things about Tomoe River and Banditapple, but as a righty I didn't pay too much attention to drying times during my search. Maybe a search on this subreddit, /r/notebooks, or [Fountain Pen Network](http://www.fountainpennetwork.com/forum/index.php/forum/41-paper-pen-paraphernalia-reviews-and-articles/) could help you. I'm not sure if a different color would do much honestly; the coating on Rhodia/Clairefontaine paper just causes inks to sit on the surface for longer than on other papers.
Might want to try other notebooks. Webbies are great, but they're very slow for most inks to dry due to the coating.

That's not the point though. The author is arguing that Apple didn't mention this in their presentation, which indicates that Apple is uncertain themselves whether that is a major selling point or not.

>Glancing at your wrist will often be faster than fishing your phone out of your pocket. Indeed, people who have used the Apple Watch told TechCrunch’s Matthew Panzarino that they were checking their smartphones significantly less because of it.

>And this alone could be a killer app! At a point where many of us are becoming concerned about our obsessive relationship with our phones, the watch was a chance for Apple to plainly say, “hey, here’s a device that will let you spend less time looking blearily at a screen and more time looking at trees or books or the people sitting across the dinner table from you.”

>But Apple hasn’t said anything to that effect. Maybe because it would be weird for Apple to be reminding us that its flagship product is keeping us from looking at trees and books and the people sitting across from us in the first place. Or maybe because Apple just doesn’t see our ever-escalating screen-gazing as a problem.

Yes, that's what I'm saying. I will agree that there seem to be more smurfs in silver than gold nova. I never claimed it was uniformly distributed, and it kind of makes sense if you think about it - there are far more reasons for there to be more smurfs in silver than in any other rank. It's the rank that most new players start in, so if a player is smurfing because he wants to play with his friends then his smurf account is more likely to be silver than gold nova or up. If a player is smurfing because he just wants to grief people, silver is the perfect rank: everybody sucks, and you can just run in and kill everyone with dualies while spamming voice chat/HLDJ/say binds/what have you.
I'm not saying that the direct cause of your frustration is from playing against cheaters, but that the reason you're seeing smurfs is because the smurfs come up against better smurfs at their normal rank, and the better smurfs play against even better smurfs at their normal rank, all the way up to the top, which is the land of cheaters (SMFC/GE).
IMO the root cause is cheaters at the high ranks causing frustrated players to start smurfing, which encourages some victims of smurfing to try cheats, which leads to smurfing, ad infinitum. Unfortunately there isn't much you can do as a player to change the community on a large scale. I am glad that you posted this, though, since we need to keep the pressure on Valve to improve their anti-cheat.
But head-to-head is inconclusive since it's four teams, and there are cycles.

 | vs eLevate | vs Denial | vs CLG | vs LG | Overall
---|---|----|----|----|----
**eLevate** | -- | 1-1 | 1-1 | 0-2 | 2-4
**Denial** | 1-1 | -- | 2-0 | 0-2 | 3-3
**CLG** | 1-1 | 0-2 | -- | 2-0 | 3-3
**LG** | 2-0 | 2-0 | 0-2 | -- | 4-2

Taking 2-0 results as "wins", we can see that LG > Denial > CLG > LG is a cycle. I suppose you could go by overall wins, in which eLevate gets shafted, but I don't know if that's fair either.

To open a case you need a key. Cases can drop from playing the game, but you can also buy them off the market. They typically go for very cheap ($0.03 - $0.06), except for the most recently released case which can sell for much more depending on how long it's been since it came out. Keys are sold by Valve for $2.49 each. You can also buy keys from the market, but this is typically only done when trading very expensive items like knives, whose prices are measured in keys rather than real dollars. This is because the Steam market has a $400 value limit for buying/selling but no limit for trading items like keys.

If you want skins, I would not even bother with opening cases. The chances of making a positive return on your investment is incredibly slim, and I would just purchase the skins you like from the market directly.
JZFB has started using this phrase too. Not sure if it's only recently, as I've only been watching FACEIT/ESEA EU for a few weeks.

Your idea is worth fuckall. Not trying to be a dick, just realistically speaking your idea is very likely not unique, and it is better for you to go into business with the mindset that everything depends on your ability to execute better than the competition. It is very hard to come up with names/logos without knowing more about the business.
The thing about reviews is that they must be read in context.

No problem. It may interest you to know about the rivalry between NiP and Titan (then VeryGames) then. Here's a good but long read: http://www.esportsheaven.com/articles/view/5130/the-entire-history-of-the-greatest-cs-go-rivalry-nip-vs-vg-part-1

If you're interested in watching casts of pro games, I would follow FACEIT, ESEA, and CEVO on Twitch.
**Most popular team, not amazing not bad**

If we are talking worldwide then NiP for sure. NiP have a huge following due to their early success in the first year of CSGO (2012-2013), where they went something like 87 consecutive LAN games without a loss. They were huge favorites to win the first ever major (DreamHack Winter 2013) but were upset by Fnatic in the grand finals. Since then they've qualified for the finals of every single major until finally winning ESL Cologne in August 2014. Part of their popularity stems from the very stable roster they've maintained since CSGO kicked off, with the only roster change happening just a few months ago. And of course the other part comes from having both GeT_RiGhT and f0rest, two of the best players to ever play 1.6. The team has fallen off recently with the rise of Fnatic, EnVyUs, and Virtus.pro; I would put them in the top 5 teams currently.

For NA, it's kind of a toss-up at the moment. So I'll split it into two parts, one for Cloud9 and one for Counter Logic Gaming.

**"Best NA team in EU, 2nd best in NA"**

This was how Cloud9 were known in the early days of CSGO when they still played under the compLexity banner. Before mid-late 2014, there were only really two NA teams worth discussing in the context of international play and those were compLexity and iBUYPOWER, with compLexity being the huge favorite both in terms of skill and fan following. coL achieved some pretty decent results at international LANs, most notably upsetting NiP and VeryGames (now Titan), two of the best teams at the time. ([Here's one of my favorite plays of all time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aJ8pWsADFY) from coL against VG.) When it came to NA events, however, they had a lot of trouble against the scrimmy style of play characteristic of NA at the time (and many would argue lives on to this day). Most notably, they lost several matches against iBP, and when one of their players left to join up with iBP many fans feared the decline of coL as an international contender. As of late 2014/early 2015, C9 are still certainly capable of upsets abroad, particularly if n0thing or shroud come up huge. But on the whole I would rate them clearly below the top 5, and probably not in the top 10 either.

**New contenders in late 2014/early 2015**

A few weeks ago it was found that 4 members of iBP were guilty of matchfixing, so with them out of contention and C9 in a bit of a slump the NA playing field has never been more level. We now have several teams who can compete at the highest level of CSGO in NA, including C9, CLG, Team Liquid, Mythic (known as Luminosity as of today), Denial, SKDC, and eLevate. Of those teams I would put C9 and CLG head and shoulders above the rest.

C9 probably still has the largest following, but CLG is quickly gaining ground thanks to the personalities of tarik and ptr. Previously a relatively unknown team called mouseSpaz, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6J9wIsS6yc) of tarik getting a 4k while eating cereal in a qualification match is what started it all off, and with some more good showings against top-tier NA teams they were picked up by CLG in mid-January 2015. CLG's recent wins on LAN against nV (top 2 worldwide) and Titan (top 10, contains the best player in the world) have definitely helped raise their popularity. And a recent head-to-head against C9 was pretty evenly split in terms of betting, so public perceptions of CLG are definitely on the upswing. It remains to be seen how much the team can accomplish at Katowice.

**Best team with best players, most wins**

It's hard to answer this question because the best players are pretty spread out right now. Currently, the top 5 looks something like this:

1. Fnatic
2. EnVyUs
3. Virtus.pro
4. Ninjas in Pyjamas
5. TSM

Most would agree that the best player in the world is kennyS, who plays for Titan.

**Underdogs, average skill group, with unexpected plays/clutches**

Cloud9 are perennial underdogs abroad, and CLG will be joining them as NA's underdog duo in Katowice. Keyd Stars (formerly KaBuM) are Brazilian underdogs who play a mean Mirage. Vox Eminor are Australia's favorites. In EU, I would consider any team outside the top 5 to be underdogs (this includes HellRaisers, LGB, PENTA, Na'Vi, 3DMAX, and Titan).

**Most likable player**

In no particular order: GeT_RiGhT (NiP), f0rest (NiP), pasha (VP), n0thing (C9), shroud (C9), tarik (CLG), ptr (CLG). If I had to name only one, I would say pasha.

What the fuck, that's at least a one-year suspension/possible expulsion at my school. But I suppose you're not talking about college.
To each his own. I've always associated canvas Chuck Taylors with middle schoolers, so I would personally never be caught wearing them.
If I already bought a makeover kit will I get access to these new faces when they come out? Or do I have to buy a new kit?
I'd personally take [leather](http://i.imgur.com/k47DzQ4.jpg) any day over canvas.

I remember feeling super weak in the early levels as well. The thing is, you probably haven't learned enough about the class to play it to its full potential. What weapon set are you using? Are you only auto-attacking in fire attunement? There are a lot of things that can make you feel weak, and the biggest one as an elementalist is not knowing your skills in each attunement. If you're playing main-hand scepter and spamming 1, you're going to feel unbelievably weak. Same goes for main-hand dagger. Elementalists also benefit heavily from having traits, which at level 23 you don't have access to yet. Stick it out :)
A few nitpicks/clarifications for OP:

* Money is much easier to obtain at level 80 than at 38. You can do explorable dungeon paths, champ farm in various maps, do the World Boss circuit for rares, or farm the Silverwastes, just to list a few ideas.

* While there are no quest chains, there are certainly event chains. For example, taking control of a centaur camp in the Harathi Hinterlands will trigger the next phase of the event, where you have to take more camps and advance on the centaur position until you fight Modniir Ulgoth.

* Level scaling also scales XP (to a degree). So if you are a level 80 in a level 15 zone, you'll still get XP comparable to a level 80 zone minus a small penalty.

* Yup, no mounts. It's not a big deal, since there are several waypoints spread throughout each map that you can use to teleport around. The fee is based on distance and your character level, and can range from 1s 39c to around 5s at level 80. If you're bummed about lack of flying mounts in particular, look forward to the upcoming Heart of Thorns expansion where you'll get to [hang-glide](https://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/55b0bGliding-1.jpg)!
You can (and should) equip a longbow for maximum DPS. But you shouldn't camp it. The ideal rotation is to start with LB5 (Barrage) and LB2 (Rapid Fire), and then switch to sword/axe. Here's a comment I wrote on the subject a few months ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/2m8cfm/new_to_gw2_holy_hellthis_is_refreshing/cm26aw9

Note that the two longbow skills I mentioned don't require you to be at 1200 range, so you should stack with your party while using these skills. Also, the guide I refer to in the post linked above has been updated. You can find the latest version here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgWGLMXvKAk
Looks good. Uniqlo makes a similar shirt as well: http://www.uniqlo.com/us/product/men-oxford-slim-fit-striped-long-sleeve-shirt-138037.html#63|/men/tops/casual-shirts/oxford-slim/|
So much better. Do you want the midsole to be black too? Because Converse makes an all-black leather hi-top: http://www.converse.com.au/chuck-taylor-all-star-leather-hi-black-mono-1t405

Gotta say the leather on the PF Flyers looks sleeker though.

IMO navy looks a lot better than red when it comes to boat shoes.
Not feeling it personally, but hopefully someone who likes the NB aesthetic can chime in here.
Are we talking Urban Slim or 484 fit? At my local J.Crew the Urban Slim broken-ins are often on sale for $20 + additional 40% off. I recommend buying in-store if you can, since the sales can often be better if the store is in a good (i.e. not wealthy) location.

Depends on what programs you want to install on your SSD. If you want to put games or large programs on it to reduce loading times, I would go with 240. Keep in mind that Windows (7, dunno about 8) can take up to 40 GB, plus you'll want to keep about 10% of the drive free. I have a 120 GB drive and am about to pick up a second one because I'm nearly out of space.
Well Titan have a pretty decent record on dust2. Since October, they are 12-3 with losses to fnatic, NaVi, and NiP. And crucially they won both their games against nV on dust2 in the same period (16:3, 16:11). So they were probably feeling justifiably confident that they would perform better than nV did against CLG on dust2. Nobody expected tarik to show up in such a dominating fashion though :P
wigg is the best part of CLG that's not actually part of CLG
Looks like a blink skill? I think I see a figure appearing in the spot after the explosion goes off.
Not this time, but they played 3 AWPs 1 auto a round or two before this and won it off the back of Cabibi's 3k with the auto.

Honestly, you shouldn't be using an Aeropress if you want lots of clarity. The reason people like the Aeropress so much on this subreddit is that it's very easy to get a good result with most coffees, but its position on the clarity <-> body scale precludes it from being as good as a pourover for high-clarity coffee or as good as a French press if body is what you're after. Take a look at this image: http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/posts/Body%20and%20Flavor%20570.jpg

The Aeropress is great as a first brewing tool because it's not very finicky. You can make a pretty good cup with just about any combination of grind size, water temperature, and brew duration. This makes it very popular on /r/coffee as it's usually the first thing people buy to replace their drip machine. At the same time though, you'll find that it's not exactly the best at anything. That's the tradeoff you get, and it sounds like you had misguided expectations of the Aeropress due to all the hype.

Yep, he and GeT_RiGhT really seem to get along. And besides, who could possibly replace him at this point? Inb4 NiP.JW...
Same city as Valve as well.
True, I was just wondering if he could test the other change as well.

/u/Hotw1re, does it look different from before if you run through the smoke instead of stand on the edge?

Flat-front, duh... I totally forgot what they were called and just said "straight". Thank you for reminding me.

I don't see why everyone around here hates pleated chinos. Sure, if you're moderately fit and not too wide in the waist I agree that usually straight chinos tend to look better. But we don't know anything about OP's frame, so to just assume from the get-go that pleated chinos are bad isn't the way to go about it in my opinion. My dad for example looks terrible in straight trousers, and I wouldn't even consider him to be overly fat. As a community, we shouldn't make broad generalizations about straight vs pleated chinos, peak vs notch lapels, slim vs regular fit, etc. without proper context.
This is probably what I will end up doing as well. I grew up on Ctrl + arrow keys to navigate words, so arrow keys are absolutely essential. I do wish it came with an F row though, I play a lot of CSGO and could use it for keybinds along with the ` backtick key, and I don't really need the vertical space.
Trash talk is a vital part of competitive FPS :P

I built my PC in 2012 so I'm no longer up to date. Hopefully someone else can help you.
I'm not familiar with your particular CPU and GPU choices, but just keep in mind that performance in CSGO is mostly CPU-based.
BO5 is fine for double elimination tournaments (with 1 map advantage for the upper bracket winner), but otherwise 5 maps is a bit much.
Do you really believe that? The whole point of a gem store is for players to spend real money - not gold - on items so ArenaNet can make money. Why do you think ArenaNet releases so many new armors/weapons via the gem store compared to in-game? Why do you think every update brings with it a new weapon set in the black lion chests? Yes, the players decide the gem conversion price in the sense that they are the ones who directly move it up and down by purchasing gems with gold or vice-versa. But ArenaNet still holds the cards, they can (and do) influence players' decisions by releasing new and enticing items that are only obtainable from the gem store.
Yes, but it could also indicate a change in the revenue model. I wouldn't be overly surprised if Nexon forced ArenaNet to implement some Nexon-esque gem store items in the near future. In any case, they've been driving up the gem conversion price for a long time now, and it'll only get higher from here.
Looks like a test tube rack.
Is $130 for a 7950 a good price for someone looking to upgrade from a 7850?
The second one was definitely DSLR. First one has too much noise reduction and color correction to be SOOC. The notebook gives it away. Second one has noticeable chromatic aberration and blown highlights. It just has that rough-around-the-edges SOOC look.
I don't, never liked the sound signature and small sound stage. Happily rocking HD598s, but M50s are what I recommend to anyone who asks.
Aren't Rigid Dragons raw? I have a pair that has faded beautifully over a year-long period. If you want jeans that stay dark, I wouldn't buy raw.
The others I can believe, this one I'm not so sure of.

This has to tie into masteries then. Something like a +X% defiance reduction seems plausible.
Perhaps it's like tag-team fighting games, where pressing F2 makes you instantly swap weapons, burst, and swap back? Or maybe it's just a straight up second burst skill for each weapon set à la Ultra I/Ultra II in SFIV. Or maybe it's an offhand burst skill.

Edit: Or maybe it's something even crazier, like sacrificing health for a full adrenaline bar. I could totally imagine a warrior specialization based on that idea.
That would be really cool. Or it could be for the offhand weapon, or maybe for your stowed weapon set? Can't wait for more info!
It's the quote for retaliation. The male version ("hit me, I dare you") is much more palatable IMO.
I play a male Sylvari because I'm sick of "this rose has thorns...and HERE THEY ARE"
Warrior F2 skill confirmed!

I named both of my pets (jaguar and jungle stalker) "Juvenile Brown Bear", but no one has called me out on being a bearbow ranger yet :(
In general, yes, but IIRC the particular diver he mentioned gets a pass for its mod-ability and decent movement.
He's right. There are many things to like about Android, but the update rollout scheme is not one of them.
You can most definitely apply it. I noticed that the armor came with Pyre on it and it was the first thing I tried.

Edit: just tried it in-game, it seems like you cannot apply it to another armor set, nor can you apply it to a different dye slot than the one it originally came from. So you can only use the dye remover to "reveal" the original Pyre dye in its original slot.
My most used dyes are Celestial, Illumination, Blood, Royal, and Midnight Ice. So white, gold, red, blue, and black. I'll give a few suggestions/alternatives below:

Wrath is a great dark red. Blood is a slightly lighter red but more expensive.

Blue Ice is a good substitute for White/Celestial on light/heavy armor. Icing is also good.

Ocean is a very nice dark teal. Royal is more of a pure blue but looks fantastic with Celestial/Illumination.

Illumination and Redemption are great gold dyes. Redemption is closer to Pyre, if that's what you're looking for. Brass is another good metallic dye.

Midnight Ice is a great black dye, but these days it's prohibitively expensive. Iron is a good substitute.

Hope this helps!
Can confirm that this works without pyre dye unlocked.

I have the same lamp and can vouch for its quality, especially for $9.

That's the thing, GW2 rewards you for exploring and wandering around. Just remember to do an event or two when you stumble upon them :P
Reaching max level is pretty easy in GW2 compared to other MMOs.I have three 80s and I've never hit the level cap in any other game so you can take it from me. I don't remember how long it took me personally, but to give you some hard numbers my friend hit 80 on his first character in ~80 hours while playing at a leisurely pace. You can do it in much less if you're really interested in WvW, but I don't recommend it if it's your first character.
I agree, July/August 2013 seems likely. Colin mentioned that they started thinking about releasing an expansion sometime during LS season 1, around the time of Bazaar of the Four Winds/Cutthroat Politics, due in part to player feedback. IIRC there was a sizeable fraction of the playerbase clamoring for new fractals at the time. I'm almost certain that they had already decided to do an expansion by the time Halloween rolled around.
"those guys"
You don't necessarily need F keys for GW2, in fact it will probably be easier if you rebind F1-F4 to [your_favorite_modifier_key]+[num]. For example, I have F1 bound to Alt+1.
