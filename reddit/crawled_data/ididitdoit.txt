Indeed, this is the kind of bad writing I see on Turkish tv. Technical details are all wrong, and the decisions of characters don't make any sense. It's like it's written by a bunch of high schoolers.

That's why I commented in the first place. Guy/Girl above me indicates he is not an objective third party because he is a "fanboy". Declaring someone a fanboy isn't even being objective in the first place.
Being a huge fan of a product isn't a sign of his quality of journalism.

Yes, you can even customize how long your alarm should go off in the "Silence after" setting. Minimum is 1 minute, maximum is 15 minutes.
How do you mean? Like a disable all button? I will implement that in the near future.
Yes, what you said.

I'm a deep sleeper and after using an alarm app for over a month I get used to dismissing alarms while sleeping(muscle memory). I wake up and don't even remember dismissing it. If I only set one alarm, then I'm afraid I'll dismiss it and oversleep. That's why I set up multiple alarms to be sure I wake up on time.
Java, with the Android Studio framework.

But I'm going to look into Flutter or Nativescript for my next project.
> Have a setting in which the gap between each alarm keeps getting smaller with each iteration.

It has one! I named it "Smart". 

Thanks for the sequence, I will look into that this evening.

> Reply to edit: did the multiple alarms help? 😂
It did! But I had those alarms already set a week ago. So I just had to enable them.
For now, it's just an ad-free version. However, I have plans to include extra themes for the Pro version.

I might also add new features for Pro only, but I can't make any promises right now.
> Very interested in this. Is there an option to label the different alarms that can be set up?

Yes, every alarm can contain a label. You'll have to do it manually for each one, though.

I you think I should an option to set a label for all alarms at once, please let me know! I will see what I can do.
Great suggestion! I will try to develop that in the near future.
You can choose a input method to your liking in the settings menu, there is also a grid input like your example. I just put the system default as default to not confuse people. They will feel at home when the input looks exactly the same as their system default.
That's a feature I could implement to this app. But I need to research it first.
This idea would work great if I can group the alarms in a stack. I will try to develop it in the near future.
Sadly, no. Integers and longs have a limit.
That a nice idea. I will try to develop this in the future. When you set multiple alarms it will be shown as a stack and all can be deleted with one click.
Exactly. BCH is a product of the community splitting on vision. BTC won the consesus war, but BCH still serves people not agreeing with the direction BTC is taking. I like both chains. But selling it as the real Bitcoin is scamming. The least they could do is sell it as Bitcoin Classic, which it is.

That's a possibility too.
> dismiss all un-dismissed alarms at once
> have a daydream/screensaver function

The dismiss/delete all alarms at once is on the roadmap already.
The ambient display is a great idea! I will try to code that.

> either way, I'm looking forward to this because I can't rmember to swipe left instead of right in my half awake state at 6am :P

I'm also one of the persons that dismisses alarms during his sleep :-)
Thanks for the feedback! English is not my native language, easy mistake to make.
Yes, this app is open source because I used open source code. I have to push it to Github still, will do that in the weekend with the next update(have a lot to do for college atm) because I would have to take the ads out for that. I'll also put the ad-free version to Fdroid this weekend. The Free app on the Play Store has ads, the Pro version has no ads and will get extra themes soon.
Yes, I did too. During the Jobs era Apple always provided the perfect experience from unboxing to leaving. Now you get halfbaked results.

The main "blockchain" has no issue at all. Nanex never had an issue. It's an issue with exchanges implementing nodes and wallets. 

Nano has no blockchain btw.

If Fantano thinks KOD was meant as a deep rap album, he must be an idiot. I think it was more a parody album about lil's.

I still hold the view that FNL is his best work. Damn I miss those times. You explained it very good. I always thought that J. Cole would become bigger than Kendrick back then. Kendrick had a damn goodnflow, but his lyrics were so so. J Cole was on top in every domain.

Only some of his albums are corny. The storytelling we saw on the last tracks is what made me a Cole stan. It's almost at the level of Friday Night Lights.
>  In reality the vast majority of these rappers don't mumble 

It's not really about the mumble voice, but the mumble level of lyrics.

> Gucci gang was a hit just because it was really catchy

It was not catchy at all. It was like touret's syndrome.
His fans are mostly white, that's what I believe Cole was mostly referring to.

Which means no second album, it's just open to interpretation.
Luckily I had to wake up at 5.30AM
FNL will never be topped bro. It was his best work.
Well, I can understand that constant trolling makes a community "toxic"* against any newcomer or someone with a slight different opinion.

The community is important for me. It makes hodling more enjoyable when the community is fun.
Just when I was thinking about supporting BCH, I see reasonable comments downvoted. SMH both r/bitcoin and r/btc are childish.

The next bull run will prove the community that Bitcoin's network congestion drives all crypto currencies down. Either Bitcoin would have to recognize that something has to change because LN takes too long or BCH will take over.
Same! Warm Up and Friday Night Lights are his best work imo.

> No it's not - you code your algorithm to rely on resources such as memory bandwidth that ASICs don't have in more abundance than anything else. ETHash is one example of this.

Fair enough, thanks for clearing that up.
> It means that the algorithm in question was designed to provide minimal speedup when implemented on an ASIC, compared to general purpose computing hardware like a CPU or GPU.

It's impossible to code a an algorithm that provide minimal speedup for a custom made chip that is designed to process the algorithm as fast as possible (AFAIK).

What you are saying is ASIC-Proof (which is practically impossible, no algo is asic-proof). Not ASIC-Resistance, which means an algorithm is designed to not be processed fast by known ASICs, or that an ASIC does not exist to process that algorithm.

So, referring to your first post I commented on. Cryptonite was Asic-resistant before an Asic was developed for it. Just look at the 50% drop of Monero's hashrate since the new fork.
Asic resistant means that there are no asics developed for that algo. For every algo there can be made an asic. If a coin is asic resistant that means that the coin will fork(the hash algo) against asics. 
Sure, Nano is the only coin losing value right now lol.

I agree with the last part. That's a far better system. I've heard from many people that they prefer popular vote, which is not a good thing for a country like the US.

Extra note for the downvoters: Don't assume my residence, nationality or political preference with hearing one opinion that seems to agree with a certain party in the US. I'm European and live in Europe. I don't care about left or right. Aligning to a spectrum is idiotic.
I meant huge populated region.
With only counting popular vote you can have a huge populated* region that can dictate everything for the rest of the country. The voting system is fine as it is.

It was meant to bring confusion.

Correct. There are signs for dismanteling secularism. But hasn't happenned yet.
Look up for the definition of secularism. It doesn't apply to Turkey. Citizens are still free from religious rule. 
Sanctions on Turkey means that Turkey will look for econmic relations in the east and Russia. Last thing that the US wants is to lose influence to Russia.
Government is still secular. The country is not ruled by an holy leader or church. A president being religious doesn't makr a country not secular.

Many people don't realise they're introverts, or even what it means. I guess they feel very related to this study and don't know how to react. I've been there, not knowing what introvertism is. I can understand it makes those people happy that their traits seen by extraverts as sad, shy and lonely being appreciated here.
Introverts can "fake" extravert traits. But it still eats up a lot of mental energy. I might speak the whole day long, but end up in a mental depression for 2 days.
> When you're good at something you don't have to give it much thought.

Not as an introvert. Introverts always think and assess situations, no matter how good they are at certain skills. I can do small talk, but it eats a lot of my mental energy. I have to focus 100% on the small talk and think of scenarios that might happen and how I should react to it.
As an introvert can confirm, but I think it has to do a lot about the fact that many introverts are analystic.

In crypto you have to look long term. I'd say 3-5 years before REQ gets adopted properly. Int the meantime it will depend on day-to-day trading for its value.

Edit: Spelling.
Glad you can see some perspectives. Bitcoin has scaling problems that needs to be solved. Blocksize can be increased slightly(or Atomic Swap and use LTC as means of transaction). Bitcoin Cash is legacy Bitcoin and should market itself as "the Bitcoin that was meant to be", not as "we are the real Bitcoin hurr durr". And the shady people involved doesn't help neither.

Better action does not fill plotholes. I don't want to question your intelligence our observation abilities, but the conversations are forced and out-of-reality, the editing is cringeworthy, many details that don't make any sense at all and so on. 

Remember the mid-season finale of S8? With all those closeups of Rick's gang. That was meaningless af. It felt like "I want to be creative, but don't know how to link a story to those facial emotions".

Or how each conversations in the middle of a bad situation is like "it has to be like that". I've heard that too many times in this show. (Last episode Oceanside, Enid) They want to sound "deep", but it is very repeating and not deep at all. It's the same "how I feel about it" story over and over again. And it's too direct.

Most people don't look at stuff like this, but analytical persons like me are bothered heavily with it. However, enjoy what you enjoy.

> I use my mirrorless camera in manual mode , so pro-mode shouldn’t be a problem right? Also, the water colour issues aren’t present? thanks!

Pro-Mode should be no problem. The water paint issues are not present in the RAW-image file. The water paint effect arises from the denoising image processing, no processing is done in the RAW file.
It's not a bug. Snapchat and Instagram use the video-mode of the camera and take screenshots of it. The problem is that the video-mode is always zoomed in because of the EIS, and probably also the screen-ratio. 
I've switched from an iPhone 6 recently. The camera is a big upgrade from the i6. If you know how to use the pro-mode (or willing to learn), you'll take much better pictures than the average user with the latest iPhone. You can process the RAW image yourself and tune the colours yourself. The normal mode is pretty good too, the auto focus is very fast. However when you crop an image, you'll notice that details are suffering from the denoise processing.

Believe me, you'll be amazed by the speed of launching apps, the battery life, multitasking and the oled screen. 

If you really want the best camera available now, buy a Pixel 2 (or wait for the Nokia 9, which will have PureView-like features). If you just want an (huge) upgrade, the 5t will make you happy.

You can return the 5t in 14 days if you're not happy with the camera.

I think only you forgot Cyprus. The Greek military junta tried a coup d'etat on the Republic of Cyprus. Turks and Greeks co-existed in peace in Cyprus until the coup. Turkey came to save the day, hell the Greek junta felt so pressured by the Turkish invasion they just resigned and brought back democracy to Greece.
Ask the US and the coalition. 
That's what I told Kurds when discussing about Syria. The west will help you, but only until their problem is solved. Then they leave. It's a wet dream to assume the West would try to destabilize a country right on their border.

Why would you feed a mouse paint?
Nope, I switched recently from an iPhone to an Android. And Apple Music sucks on Android, I can't download any songs(checked permissions).

The problem with Spotify is that any local file you try to add is being matched with songs on Spotify. They only have a live version of your song? Well that one song in your whole album will now be a live version. And you can't change that, Spotify decides what's best for you. Trying to add a Jay Z album? Good luck! It will be unplayable.

I'm also struggling with adding J Cole's early mixtapes to Spotify, and I'm not looking forward to using two apps or to have playlists without these songs. Half of the songs on Spotify have the wrong metadata, album cover or version. And I'm not going to fix a library again after what Apple Music launch day did to my iTunes library. That shit took me 3 full days.

Pirating it is, or Play Music (no student discount though).
I have exactly the same problem around this period.

"the ME is on a separate CPU" LOL. This is clearly written by someone who barely understands computer hardware. The ME is on the CPU itself, it can't be on a separate CPU because you'll need to install a second CPU next to the first CPU. It's unlogical. That's like saying Volvo has a backdoor on a separate engine, which means that the Volvo has two engines...

However, the Intel ME functions as a microprocessor within the CPU.

Edit: Added extra info

Edit2: Samsung's Weeping Angel has no compromised CPU. It was malware that only could be installed through physical access with an USB stick. This guy is talking total bullshit.

Edit3: I'm not saying that Intel ME couldn't be used for surveillance, it can.

It is ill-intended. My 6 was unusable at 88% battery health. The CPU was throttled to 600mhz. I bought an OP 5t, and I will never look back. Android is now better than iOS anyway.

Yup, I also feel like this is the only way to communicate my feelings or thoughts properly. It's sad that we as men can't speak about it, or that no one comforts us and tries to understand us.
Oh man, I'm very emotional but sadly I'm hiding every emotion like a cold chicken now. Nobody cares about what I feel, because I should "man up". And i start to believe that every men is emotional but just learned to deal with it. And that's not a good thing. It builds up stress and rage.

Edit: I just had a hip surgery (removing a gamma nail after breaking hip year ago), and we're moving to a new home right now. I told my mother and sister that I'm starting to feel pain in my leg after one week of trying to scrub the old wallpapers and paint the walls. They said I should just man up. Now they expect me to carry heavy stuff and today my leg finaaly gave up. I can't stand on that leg any more because of the pain that build up. I acted a little bit in rage when that heavy pain came up. I can't carry myself even lmao. And guess who they blame? Me! I should have told them I had pain and take it more slowly and I have no right at all to be angry because I'm a man and they feel offended. But about moving the heavy furniture tomorrow? I should just man up and pray I can study for my college exams without pain.
Yeah I was also alive then. 
CPU DasherX. You should see 1400mhz at cpu clock frequency. 
Battery is already replaced.
I don’t know that. 
CPU Dasherx shows the max clock frequency. 
Only some 6s models can get a free battery replacement. The 6 and 7 don’t. 
If I killed someone I wont ask my parents not to be angry. That’s far beyond reasonable. 
Degradation is the excuse that Apple uses. My phone got throttled to max 600mhz when the designed capacity health was at 88%. That’s more than healthy enough. My dad’s 5s with 66% of its designed capacity didn’t get throttled. Stop being an apologist. What Apple says is different than what people are reporting. Apple shipped these phones with defective batteries. 

No Android device gets throttled because the battery became old. IPhones on the other hand start to crash, which indicated there is a bigger problem. My 6 also crashed randomly before the 10.2.1 update. And the phone was less than a 4 months old back then. No way the battery was degraded. I’m pretty sure the battery sucks or Apple’s CPU take too much power. Apple should have handled this like Samsung. 

Anyway continue believing what your corporate overlords say. 
You are right. Balance is the key. But balance also means you don’t make false promises. 
Noticed any slow downs with stock apps on Android? 
Mine was at 12% and sadly it was throttled. 
Waiting 20-30 seconds to launche the phone app is not tolerable. 
The batteries were broken and made iphones randomly shut down. So Apple made the phone draw less power from the battery resulting in a slower performance. 
It’s not like we can undo the purchase of an iPhone 6 two years ago. But you’re right. I’m about to buy an Oneplus 5t next week. 
People are messed up. 
The plus models don’t seem to be impacted since they have a different and bigger battery. 
What Apple says doesn’t matter in the first place. The throttle goes away when you replace the badky produced batteries that Apple should have replaced. 
Exactly. When a child tells the truth don’t be angry when you promised not to. But tell them that you feel dissapointed for their actions but happy for their honesty. Dissapointment hits much deeper than rage. 
Healthy batteries got throttled too. Mine was at 88% of its designed capacity and git throttled to 600mhz max at a full battery charge. 
Androids don’t shut down with battery’s at 88% capacity. My iPhone 6 got throttled with a healthy battery capacity. The batteries are bad and need to be replaced by Apple.

Why do people act like its cheap and okay to buy an iPhone and just buy a new phone when Apple scams you? These kind of apologist circle jerk needs to end. Iphones are not cheap, you pay a premium price ald should expect premium performance. 
“Eastern religious”. I wonder where Christianity came from...
Have the same problem on iOS. Not related, but could be an app.
There is nothing wrong with the phone right now. Like I said in my first comment, replacing the battery fixed this problem.
Battery health was at 88%. That's still healthy and no excuse for throttling. Do you even know how slow 600mhz is? Loading the phone app took 15 seconds. Loading reddit took 30 seconds. Loading twitter took 40 seconds. Try to multitask that.

It's a scam when I pay 850 euro's for an iPhone only to get slower speeds than a 100 dollar Android phone.

And also I meant a max speed of 600mhz. It never went beyond that.
Capacity was at 88%. No excuse for throttling.
>  is under load, right? Because if it's just sitting at the info screen then literally any modern computing device will throttle to low clock rates on idle to sa

Yes, under load. The max speed was 600mhz, it didn't go faster than that.
I'm going to sell it anyway soon, a 3rd party replaced the battery.
Some argue that it does not depend on the capacity unlije Apple says but at the voltage the battery can deliver to power the cpu. Seems like many phones have a defective battery and Apple decided it was easier to just throttle CPU than to replace all devices. 
1400 mhz. 
Laptops throttle when necessary to save battery. But you can change settings to always reach the max clock speed under energy management. Apple meanwhile throttled my iPhone to 600mhz with 100% battery charged. That’s sad. 
Mine is just over two years old for the record. Bought it a month before the 6s release. 
I used 2 different apps to confirm the battery capicity, one was battery doctor life and the other one I don’t remember. The CPU clock speed can be measured with CPU DasherX. And use Antutu or Geekbench to confirm if your cpu is performing lower than the standard. 
My iPhone 6 got throttled to 600 mhz with a battery capacity at 88% of its designed capacity. That is more than healthy enough to have a stable battery. I think there is more to it. 

Replacing the battery helped.

Exactly. Both these subs are like a toxic pot of cultists. But they both blame each other to be wrong, bad and toxic. Both are right in this case.

Bigger blocks isn’t new tech. Lightning network, segwit and atomic swap are. 
No sauce?
My iPhone 6 is just 2 years old. Battery health was at 88%. CPU was throttled to 600Mhz right the day after my warranty ended. The phone was unusable untill I replaced the battery.

I don't think this is a battery capacity problem, but a faulty battery batch that fails to deliver enough voltage/energy to sustain the CPU speed after the health drops slightly.
Self made scammer.
I got zero notfications. In fact my cpu was throttled with battery health at 88%, which shoulf be a healthy level. The max clock speed I got was 600mhz. Unbearable. 
Remember when Macs used to last 7 years at least? My iMac 5G did.
Mine kicked in at 88% health. Starting the camera app took like 15-30 seconds.
> I agree, but now too many people are out there to “get” Apple, they will not hear the voice of reason.

Slowing down phones with no warning is not reasonable. I had used my 6 for several months with so much frustation untill someone on reddit told me that Apple covered up faulty batteries. And the batteries are faulty. Other phones with slightly worn out batteries won't just shut down.The iPhone 6 did this one year after release, so Apple just covered this up by replacing several 6s models and slowing down the rest. The batteries fail to deliver enough voltage when they are +10% worn out. And that's a very low number. My 6 was throttled to 600mhz with battery capacity at 88%. 88% is no excuse.
The stock batteries are shit in the first place. That's why they throttle the CPU.
> your battery may need to be serviced”

Didn't get this message, but did recieve a nice CPU throtlle to 600mhz whatever the battery charge level was.

Why would Mossad make weapons with Mossad titled on it. Way to go to cover up your secret missions.
No, I am comparing to your comment where you said that having only 2 painting from a collection of 11 bizar paintings doesn't make it bizar. So my point here is that if I have two weapons in the hand of my gang, I am a gangmember. Just like how owning 2 bizar paintings out of the 11 bizar paintings makes those two paintings still bizar. You were arguing that owning only two paintings which indicate CP does not indicate CP because Podesta doesn't own the other 9 paintings.
Very low. Sad. 
I think it reflects more on you that you don’t find such art are troubling. You must be mentally ill to buy such a thing that hints to children and softporn.

He clearly wasn’t ambigious at all and made a good point with clear arguments. Doesn’t deserve downvotes, but still gets it because he is defending my point. 
No, you can exchange Bitcoins to standard currencies. I’m not trying to hate on you or so, but you should try to understand crypto currencies more. 
Dude, read my comment again. It’s not hard to understand what the point of my comment is. It’s easy to downplay this as mentally ill, which should be against the rules, you can’t get any lower than that.  It’s a childish argument to downplay on the man instead of using real arguments. The point was that having two bizzar CP related painting out of the 11 isn’t an excuse to own two. U/FartOnToast gets it. 
This. Finally someone is smart enough to read the point. 
Exactly. It wasn’t supposed to make any sense. Just like the previous comparison.

Edit: But I'm so angry at Apple for covering this up. I'm switching to a cheap Android soon. I only replaced the battery to see if the rumors were true.

Oh damn, I misunderstood your previous comment. I thought you said they coudln't be Jews because of their race.
It's cool to know that both genders get involved in tech companies. 
> "We're not even Jews, we're Khazar."

IIRC Hitler did "save" Karaites who follow the old testament, but is not really Judaism. They were also a Turkic tribe(like the Khazars), hence making Hitler believe they had nothing to do with Jews.
> I mean its not like the Khazars couldnt convert to Judaism and then be called Jews.

Khazars were a Turkic tribe following the Jewish religion. So yes, they were Jews. But not Isreali or German Jews. They were Turkic Jews.

I was about to buy BTC with 50 euro's somewhere between 2009-2011. But localbitcoins was the only option in my country and it seemed very fishy to me at that time that I could only buy through bank transfers. Jesus Christ. I'm not too sad about it, I have other shots in my life. I know I have the potential in me. But damn, my father went bankrupt in 2013 and my parents divorced(for other reasons). But we have no own home now, we(my mother) rent a social home, and we can barely pay for our car and my education.

But whatever, everything will be ok. My studies are going ham. I will end up with a nice job and a nice salary and the skills to be potentially rich. It's not the lambo's I care about, but about having a nice house for my mother and a nice car and life for myself.
I would use it if I had a steadier income. Am a student and hodl is my only option since I can only invest small amounts.

That's why I think too.
Exactly, education is the only thing I don't mind paying for. Stuff I don't use like public transport is questionable.
More money doesn't solve efficiency though. The most things kids learn at schools are useless. Education should refocus on basic knowledge, critical thinking, scientific methods, creativity etc.
> look at how shitty the education system is.

Only in the US. Western Europe enjoys high quality education, thanks to heavy taxation.
Show of authority.
While I agree taxation is too heavy, how are you going to keep education equal and accessible to every child?

Maybe a tax system like this could work. You have a car? Pay tax for the roads. Your kid goes to school? Pay tax for education. That would be fair, but I don't know how that would be sustainable.

Edit: However, we have technology for education now. It could be offered through internet and/or volunteers at schools. Or maybe have a system where the poor kids can go free to any school.
Journalism is extinct in the Benelux. They just ask for the opinions of bankers about Bitcoin. What are they going to say about a coin that defies their values and they don't understand the tech? Exactly!

I don't think that Satoshi made Bitcoin so he just could solve the double-spending problem and be done with it. The double-spending problem was a problem that made decentralized p2p coins impossible. The purpose has always been to provide a decentralized coin. 
I have a feeling that the dot patterns are a result from the noise reduction.
Look like you used the second lowlight cam. Could be hardware issue with the main cam.
I have the exact same problem with my iPhone 6, but I use Apple Music.

Everything on my phone got deleted when I plugged it into my pc to charge. iTunes was on, but a sync never happened since music is now synced with iCloud.

Maybe you also had plugged your iPhone into your pc?

This is so fucking annoying. My post got shadowbanned on r/apple.
Oh, lol. Valuta sounds so much like an English word, thanks for notifying me!
Lol the double-spend problem was a problem that existed in digital coins before Bitcoin. Bitcoin is made to decentralize the currency, to keep it out of the bank and governments’ hands. Also to stop problems like inflation, making it a currency like gold.

I almost bought some IOTA there. Good thing I decided that I hadn't enough money to invest more atm.
> battery was losing charge quite fast, and the latest iOS versions made her phone very slow.

iPhone 6 to 7 have faulty batteries. Apple covered it up by throtlling down the cpu speed if your battery wears out. Replacing the battery made my iPhone 6's clock speed at max again.

I'm pretty angry about it, and looking to switch to the 5t soon. I'm also wondering how the 5t camera comapres to the 6.
The camera looks fine. But I think it is the noise reduction that most people complain about. It is very noticable when you crop the image, but it looks good when you don't zoom in. The iPhone 6 also had these kind of complaints when they introduced noise reduction. But people got used to it. Zooming in on a smartphone camera doesn't make sense anyway. Use a DSLR if you want that quality.
Follow up question; How about the Pro Mode with raw images. Does it provide more sharpness, because the noise reduction on the stock cam is really overblown.
I will be rich when it reaches 100m. To the moon!
There is no fix for it, since the developers of the apps intended this.
That's because apps use video mode of the camera and take screenshots from the video mode when you take a photo with them. Go to your stock camera app, and try out video mode. You'll notice you'll get the same zoom as in those apps.
Which app do you use to read the clock speed?

It could be that your battery delivers a too low voltage or wrong readings. 
CPU Dasherx. 
I have a iPhone 6 too atm. Looking into switching back to Android since 2013.

How does the camera of the 5T compare to your old iPhone? I did find my 5s camera far more superior than my 6 camera. 5s had more details, the 6 looks like an oil painting.
Oh man, that joke leaked to the whole internet.

Litecoin transactions should not take longer than 5 minutes. You'll have to wait for support.

The picture you shared has dots in the sky.
The stock camera app has too much noise reduction. The iPhone 6 had this problem too compared to the 5s. It's all due software.

That's what happens when the government doesn't pay for politicians salary and campaigns. Lobbyism and corporate power. In Belgium lobbyism is impossible, political parties can only recieve money from the government's tax money. Politicians recieve a very high salary, many people hate this, but they don't realize this keeps the power in our hands.
We won half Cyprus, and that pressured the Greek military junta to resign and reinstate Democracy. We made Greece great again.

I used to be a muslim, am still Belgian-Turkish lol, but when I drove through Serbia I had found the people and the police very friendly. Just like every other nation.

But I do notice in Belgium that an otherwise friendly individual can be over-nationalistic, and sometimes racist, when he is in a group of friends who share the same politic views. I think that group mentality brings ideas to a radical point. It's like he is very friendly and helpfull for foreign people, but when he ends up in his friend circle he echoes back the anti-immigrant ideas.
From what I heard from Serbs supporting Ratko, is that he was only revenging against and genociding the Turks in the region. How true is that? Did these people fall for the propaganda?
That's what you get with shitty international politics. Sticking your nose into every international affair, but run like a coward when one of yours is to blame.
Uhm, yeah that was what the previous post said, no? "Belgium wants to ban lootboxes, says it gambling". Mr. Geens does represent the government. And there is a difference between wanting and actually doing it.
Lobbyism with money can be seen as corruption in the EU. That’s why politicians in the EU get a very high salary and campaign subsidies paid by taxes. They don’t have the need to be paid or donated by corporations. I’m not sure, but I think this is even illegal in the EU. It is in Belgium at least. 
In Belgium you need to upload your ID to prove your age when you want to use gambling websites.

Coinbase is good to purchase Bitcoins. Ideally you would transfer your coins to Jaxx or Coinomi for mobile or Electrum for desktop. But beware of high transaction costs. 
Because it’s an exchange and you don’t own the private keys of your money their. Look at what happened with Mt. Gox. 
I also recommend this. With a credit card you can but as low as 2$. But don’t keep your coins there. Transfer it to a secure wallet.

I'm new to Bitcoin, I don't know all details. But when browsing both r/bitcoin and r/btc I see that both communities are full of shit and both are somewhat right. They're both destroying Bitcoin's reputation.

But I understand that everyone is fighting for what they believe in. It just would be great if this splitting between communities never happened.

It just sucks how I don't trust Roger Ver and how I hate the transaction fees of BTC and Core team's solutions to it.
Or the birth of BTC and BCH haters. Attacking the network with bots isn’t funny. Having high transaction fees suck too. 

I think both communities suck now. 
As a student I bought BTC for 10 euro when it was 800$ worth. I diversified it with other altcoins, but converted it all back to BTC after Ether stabilised, and suddenly now I have 35 euro. That’s free money, totally worth it. 
Some exchanges call Bitcoin Cash BCC.
Is the network still congested, I was looking to buying now?

This is something I only read here. Sad, because the Core sub is calling to not rub their "victory" in your faces.

I’ve been looking into Bose QuieteComfort, Sony MDR1000x and the Sennheisers. They all have their pros and cons. Sony seems to struggle with noise from trains when you move your head, but they are very good for the office and home. Bose is good overall, their noose cancelling is excellent. Sennheiser should have the best sound quality. 

I don’t know yet which one I will buy eventually. I’m a student and I’m at a point where many of my stuff got damaged, old or outdated. I work in the weekends. But I yet have to buy a new sma rtphone, laptop, office chair, glasses and clothing.

> a lot of small things

Engine was built by Volvo quality standards, but the other parts were cheapened out on because Ford owned Volvo and told them to.

I also have a Ford-era 2003 S60. I've never had any problem with the engine, transmission and other core parts. But I did have small problems. The DIM broke(Fabrication fault), fuel door hinge broke, exhaust rusted and fuel pump leak (just reversed it to fix it lol). But most of them is due to parts wearing out which is quite normal.
>  If you want a foreign car like BMW or Audi you better be rich enough to pay for all the parts

China is not communist. The economy is capitalism and the regime is authoritarian. There's nothing communist about it.
He said more than that, but that's not the problem here. The problem is Twitter not practicing an equal policy. They are just censoring at this point. Say that Assange needs to be assassinated, no problem. Say cocksucker to the CNN, get banned.

> ln the Middle East, having a surname dates back to the pre-lslamic era.

Not in Turkey. Mustafa Kemal had no surname. No Turk or Ottoman did. Surnames were given after the foundation of the republic. Kemal is Ataturk's nickname/middlename. Mustafa is his firstname and Ataturk is his surname. 

He was born as Mustafa, earned the nickname Kemal by his math teacher, earned his surname "The father of Turks" by the people.

And yes, I just learned this too. But I knew surnames were given after the foundation of the republic.
Anyone noticed the boon in the first scene? The cover resembles Max’s stepbrother. 
Jews with German surnames doesn’t make them less Jews. Ottomans were influenced by Persians, Arabs and Turkics. It’s normal that some of the Turks have Arabic names. Especially considering surnames didn’t exist a century ago. 
They should have changed to Orkhon scripture. All Turkic languages should do this.

Yes, it is running the same latest os. I do hope it's a bug and that it will be fixed soon.
> it's 1gb ram and iOS 11

The problem is not the ram here, it's the CPU being throttled by iOS11. The iPhone 5s, 2 years older than my device(purchased the 6 in 2015) is running much faster than my 6. Opening the phone app takes less than a second on the 5s, while I have to wait like 5-10 seconds.
In Belgium, IIRC, Banks can consult each other and the National Bank to see what loans you have. The National Bank can blacklist you if you haven't paid debts on time. For your salary, they just ask you to deliver proof that you recieve salary. 

But take this with a grain of salt, I never took a loan. This is what I remember from other people.

Windows installed exactly the latest audio drivers with Dolby from my laptop’s company. Thanks for offering help, I know what I’m doing :). 


Edit: Or I have a shitty memory. But after a clean install I didn’t look for audio drivers, except Intel Graphics. Always had problems with that. Windows installs the wrong one and disables me from replacing it with the correct one. Still got it working after workingnon it for two days. 
Windows installs the Dolby version for me. 
I ony have BTC and ETH atm. The problem with BTC to me has been the high miner fees. It's nice if you hodl, but damn those miner fees for making small transactions.

I have been looking into LTC now, and I really believe LTC could be one of the coins that is ready to replace our fiat currencies.  I'm not buying yet, but will probably soon :)
Just hodl man.
You’re a good person. 
Well did we get any shots that looked straight above?
It did do not. 
Why has no one checked these things when there were rumours that the Rijkswacht could be behind it? Even the foot injury could be easily brought an eureka moment. 
Yes, it allows me to work on Evernote when I don’t have an internet connection on the go. I only have a laptop, the web app should be sufficient on a desktop I guess. 
I’m from 1992, I just learned about this gang two years ago. Read a little bit about it. But of course context is important, someone like you who lived in that era understands it much better than I ever could. 

And yes, it make sense that they were criminals who worked their way to the top. But the loot was so minor that I still wonder why. Hopefully we will learn more soon, the motives will tell us who and what. The victims deserve that. 

Thank you for this. I don’t know every detail about this gang, and I agree that the Gladio hypothesis is just a hypothesis without evidence. 
I didn't intent do link the Brabant murders to Gladio, but you said that Gladio was something different. They were, but only in theory. In the real world they armed criminal organizations to spread terror and to blame it on communism. That's what they did in Turkey, all these killings were covered up but uncovered later. Why not in Belgium?

And I didn't say that the Turks were involved, I presented that you as an example what Gladio did in Turkey. I don't really know every detail that happened with the Nijvel Gang, just wanted to add this because you asked how Gladio could have been a suspect.

Edit: The suspect "De reus" is reported to be a gang of extreme-right groups. This can be linked back to Gladio, trying to do a false flag communist attack. But the question is why? And why were the motives never clear?
> “The Killer”, who killed 23 out of the 28 victims, and is rumoured to have died after the last raid by a police bullet

So the Gang ditched his body somewhere, so no one could learn that it was Group Diane behind thi?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Guerrilla#16_March_massacre

Operation Gladio is exactly known for that. It was to spread terror. They probably wanted to blame it on communists, but somehow they couldn't.

Operation Gladio went beyond its initial purposes.

Also the CIA funded the Grey Wolves and the Special Warfare Department in Turkey to allow the Grey Wolves to  commit waves of bomb attacks and shootings that killed thousands of people, including students, lawyers, journalists, public officials, labor organizers, ethnic Kurds and others, in the 1970s

Just finished with my student job at a factory. Will take a 1 hour nap right after this comment. Study for college. Continue learning Japanese and refresh some other 3 languages. And maybe work on some personal coding projects. After that it’s time to relax with gaming and reading books. Might watch a movie too, but that depends on how much time I get left. 

The good thing is I went out this week with friends. Just 1 day a week is more than enough for me. 
Was due to my screen brightness, I thought that was Darlene standing straight next to Elliot.

I had this exactly the previous night. I knew I was falling into a sleep paralysis, but didn't panic because I had these many times before. But then suddenly I start to hear electrical buzz in my ear. This is the first time I experienced sound in a sleep paralysis, so I think I started to panic and the buzz intensified every second to the point I felt pain in my ear. The pain was resembling the chronic earpain I had as a child, it's really an unbearable pain. I started to scream for my mother because I thought I was going crazy, but my voice was as loud as that buzz. It felt like my head was getting crushed by sound. I really thought I was dying. And there were no visuals, just very intense black.

You just gotta know the correct words to find something about this topic. It does however distinguish itself from quantum mind because the word implies our brain is physically quantum based. But the idea that quantum theory can help us solve some of the mysteries of our brain still stands. 

Edit: spelling mistakes
You pulled a strawman fallacy by saying that I stated the quantum consciousness as a fact. And now you are playing on my knowledge while not knowing what I know.  I’m not going to waste my phone’s battery on you. 

And Scientology and scientific research? LMFAO. 

Go to scholar.google.com, you’ll find plenty of studies by reputable institues that did researches on quantum mind and consciousness recently. 
I never said there is proof of Quantum consciousness, nice strawman. There was also never proof for quantum theory a millenia ago. Doesn’t mean it was pseudo-science when someone was researching it. 

I will repeat myself if it wasn’t clear enough for the downvoters. The difference between Scientology and  Quantum consciousness is that one is being researched scientifically and one isn’t. That’s not double standards. 

Pseudo-science is when I say that quantum consciousness is a fact, science is when I say it is a possibility that needs to be researched. 
> Do you think Scientology also deserves the benefit of the doubt?

No. Because they are not based on scienctific researches at all. It's more spirituality than science.

Quantum consciousness does deserve that. Especially since we didn't solve consciousness yet. Scientists should allow this discussion and research.

I think this company links to White Rose, there is a clock in the bottom.
I hate scientists calling on pseudo-science when there is no scientific base for an opinion or theory, but when there is also nothing that disproves that opinion or theory 100%. We should call it a possibility instead of ranting about how it is pseudo-science.
I thought it would be the popcorn machine scene. But the most memorable is the LHC and parallel universe reveal.

Fair enough.

> both sides

Whenever I tell people that the Greeks, Armenians, Bulgars, Italians and Russians also comitted to genocide of Ottoman muslims, even from their own ethinicity, I get this answer "but the Turks occupied them, so it was justified". With that logic massacring Armenians was also justified. I'm a lucky man for not having that kind of hypocrisy and logic. (Both sides were never justified to kill innocent civilians)
> he word 'genocide' was created to describe what was happening to Armenians by the Ottomans during WW1.

Lol, no. The word was invented by a Jew in 1944 to describe what happened in Poland to the Jews.
> he word 'genocide' was created to describe what was happening to Armenians by the Ottomans during WW1.

Lol, no. The word was invented by a Jew in 1944 to describe what happened in Poland to the Jews.

So, Elliot is telling us this story through a interdimensional device. That's why he calls us "friend" and knows we are real.
You're on to something here. Since he's fictional, he is in our head.

Yes we would."

Stay away from them.
It's the Washington Post, of course they are going to twist their story so it fits their partner's, CIA, narrative.
The theory is that our consciousnes exists on a quantum level. This could mean that we are everywhere and anytime at random just like quantum particles. Whichs means we never die and that our parallel selfs from parallel universes from the past and the future might be connected. If I understand correctly we are experiencing a combination of those parallel states. 

But that’s my scifi, pseudo-science version of it. Which may fit the show. 

For real science read this; https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Quantum-Mind?share=1
Holy shit, parallel universe and the things you imagine becoming real. White Rose was not joking around to Angela.  Also "can our mental states be converged?". I think we are going to see the theory of the quantum mind.
Yeah the road tax is crazy. I was too stupid to buy a car with a big engine. It's my first car too, and I don't want to let it go. It also works still good and the fuel usage is very low.

The Kia Rio does look very nice!
I have an old Volvo S60 2.4D.

I also tank 25L/week for a commute of 30-40km with random roads of 50, 70, 90 and a small part of 120kmh. But of course, also if I drive normal untill 2k rpm.
Oh ok, that clarifies a lot. I was really imagining you as someone who exclusively drives under 2000rpm. Sorry for that!

My car has a rpm of 2500 when I drive 120kmh, which makes it use 4.3L/100km. It really depends on your car I quess.

I personally don't care about oil quality since I change it every 12000km anyway.

And yes, you can drive fast and fun. But you like you said, keep your distance and be respectful.

Damn, you can read my mind.
You can drive 120+ with only 5 gears, depending on your engine size.  I can do 210kmh  with just 5 gears FYI.  You are probably scared to go over 2000rpm?

But I do practice patience with slower cars or drivers when traffic is high or they want to pass a truck. As long as they don’t stick to the goddamn leftlane when no one is driving in front of them or next to them. Damn that happens a lot in Belgium. 
Mine would just be a Volvo. 
Thank you, will look into it. 
What's interesting is that their languages has many similiarties with Turkic language, some minor linguists have made this connection, but many just ignore it. I'm pretty sure Sumerian is the ancestral language of Proto-Turkic and maybe even Proto-Mongoloid, Proto-Koreanic and Proto-Japonic.

I want to know more about Sumerians for a long time, will research and read about them more soon. They seem to be a pretty important point in our human history, so sad we never learned about them. Instead of focusing on Napoleon we should have learned about Hitites, Sumerians etc more.

Nice strawman. I said white nationalists kill more Americans than they kill other races. Are black people not Americans?

Is that also possible with songs which are not in the Spotify library?
That sucks, because many songs I listen too are from mixtapes, which are not in any streaming library. AM uploads everything from iTunes to the cloud, allowing me to listen or stream my own songs.

I'm sorry for the confusion, I thought lobbying only means donating to political campaigns for your own benefit. Never realised it was a broader word.
Is Ecoin decentralized or run by an evil corporation?
I meant donating campaign money.
That's what I meant, donating to political campaigns is also forbidden here. Political campaigns are paid with tax money only.

Edit: Minor spelling
In Belgium lobbying with money is forbidden. The politicians earn 10,000 Euro a month anyway, so they don't have the need to collect money from corps and pass laws for them. But, in Belgium you do what the foreign corps ask you to do, otherwise they leave the country and the economy falls heavily.

Edit: I meant that donating campaign money is (also) forbidden. Political campaigns are paid with public tax money. My point still stands though, politicians need campaign money in the US to stay relevant. Corps will only donate if the politician makes certain promises to the corps. I should have used more specific words.

That's because Belgium, Netherlands and Germany imported Turks mostly from the eastern region to work in their coal mines. And the Eastern region has always been the more islamic part. Turks from the West-Coast are more modern, less religious and more friendly to the West.

I never wanted to start a Computer Science study because I was afraid that I will fail miserably with coding due to my lack of math skills. So I started with Marketing only to fail there and switch to Computer Science. I never could ever knew that I would get good grades for coding courses.

I did fail my first course though, Java Basics, but after a tip from my teacher to just practice coding instead of studying it, I passed for Java Advanced. And also for Basics after a retake of the exams.

Practice and patience is the message here. Coding is a skill, not knowledge(besides the syntax). Start with practicing with the most simple codes and work your way up.
As an ex-muslim, can confirm. That's why I distanced myself from the religion in the first place, because I was a pork-eating, alcohol drinking, not praying "muslim". In reality I never was a muslim, it was just a badge that I was wearing to fool myself and others around me and especially to fool god. My number one rule is that I always do my best to be a good person without hurting myself or my family. I don't need religion for that. Religion has become irrelevant in this era, there is nothing better to please god than by being a good person. There is everything wrong with trying to please god by contradicting yourself, being a praying and complying muslim and a bad person.

Edit: added more stuff.
Sidenote: I still believe in a god.

Yes, Software gets bigger and bigger. The Facebook app for example now has a built-in camera, stories, live streams etc. That needs more CPU power and more RAM to run it fluently. And new features will come, they will always come to beg more power and battery life from your phone
iOS is locked and closed, unless you jailbreak. But that's the beauty of iOS, it's locked down for security. When you lost your phone or an authority wants your data, you can be confident that iOS got you covered.

About Android, I meant that its security and update policy are starting to improve, or even has improved. The user interface and the ease of use is also much better than it used to be for Android. That's what is luring me together with the lower prices. The only thing I'm afraid for is my privacy. Being an OS from Google and your personal data not so secure compared to iOS.
Even my English teacher didn't know that difference. She argued that I misspelled the Washington Capitol.
Yes, this moment will shape my decission for my next phone. I have an iPhone 6 atm, and I'm starting to like Android more thanks to better security and update policy. The price of the bezelles phone or the featurs of the lower end models will decide whether I'll switch.

There is as much evidence that Erdogan did it as Gulenists did it. It's unclear. Everything is circumstantial evidence. 
Gulenists in the military were never that powerfull. The Kemalists who were protecting democracy and secularism were prosecuted by Gulenists and Erdogan. Those Kemalists in power were replaced by Gulenists. Gulenists are as bad as Erdogan, stop being an apologist.

I go to college and finished my first year, I also learned Java, Assembly and PHP. I also know some Ruby, it's also a language I love but I did not spent a lot of time with it to say that I truly like to code with it. 

My least favorite at this moment is Java. I feel like C# is more versatile and Java feels restricted in comparison.
