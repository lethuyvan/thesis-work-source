For real, french feminists are starting to push inclusive writing, which consists in putting dots in the middle of sentences because having the masculine form as neutral is misogynistic apparently.

It looks absolutely terrible:

*"Les travailleurs sont gentils, ils seront bien payés"*  
becomes  
*"Les travailleur.euses sont gentil.les, iels seront bien payé.es"*

If you long press the ribbon it will show a cat emoji/ a cross. When it show the cat emoji, you have unlocked a secret quick settings tile you can add in the notification dropdown, and which allows you to choose cat food that will attract virtual cats that you can collect.

In french, the joke is "Quelle est la différence entre une vache et de la tôle? Aucune, les deux ont du lait." 
"Ont du lait" can be pronounced as "ondulée" which means "wavy" as in [wavy sheet metal.](http://https://cdn.beiser-se.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/thumbnail/570x/5779f5654a05c39c43fdcced8f0a4bb7/0/4/04040706011_1.png) The grammar isn't exactly correct but the sound of it is funny.

This isn't all the information, you don't have the numbers, you don't have any comparisons, you don't have any stats - If you want the reader to read the article, you don't put the most important information in the title, or else they'll just read the title and assume they'll know enough. By using this title, they make the reader curious and draws them to read the article. If they said ''Nintendo Switch sold more in 10 months than any other console in history'' people would have said ''Oh, nice I guess'' and move on to something else. Here they tell barely enough information for you to want to read the article, so you can get more precise info and more info in general than if you just read a title.
It gives you three shells, either red or green, that you can throw at your opponents. Green ones follow a straight line and bounce, and red ones target the player in front of you
They can't, that's why they didn't.
And then what's the point in making an article if everything you need to know is in the title?
That's why it litterally has ''On a time-aligned basis'' in the title.
No offense but even though the base idea is nice, it looks terrible

The worst thing about dreams is that very often, you don't realise they are dreams.  
Three days ago I had a fantastic dream where I met that one very nice girl. She was the nicest person I had ever met. We did a bunch of things together, going to a restaurant, sitting on a bench in a park and some more cliché things, in a very 'sunsetty' amtosphere, like if everything was lit up by candles. It probably felt like the time of my life as it happened.  
But as soon as you wake up, everything falls apart. Everything you did, every moment you lived, every memory you created slowly vanishes as you try to hold onto them. Crazy how sometimes the life you make up is better than the life you actually live.

The DS had some incredible hidden gems. If you like story-driven games, incredible plot twists and a lot of crying, try Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective. It's absolutely unbelievable. In the same spirit, The World Ends With You, Professor Layton and Phoenix Wright.

I've never played Dark souls, but from what I've played of this (Started around 3 days ago, just beat my 3rd level) it seems like there's a lot of replayability value. The bosses aren't unfair at all, and when I die too much on a boss/level I just replay the old ones to practice. Combined with awesome music and the fact that you'll have to [beat all the levels without killing anything, and the bosses with a perfect score](/spoiler) to 100% the game, I can say you'll be on that game for a long time.
Believe me, by the time you'll have beaten the last boss, you'll have forgotten the first few worlds.
You could have beaten it in 0 A presses easily

It was very good apart from the terrible controls. But as I said, a famous sm64 hacker already ported SM64's control scheme onto SM64DS.
Super Mario 64, it was amazing when it came out and it still is. The hacking scene is full of awesome stuff, and things that really feel like sequels to the game.

It's a romhack of mario 64 yeah, Last Impact
Super Mario 64 Last Impact
It's because it's Last Impact, a romhack with whole new levels.
I'd say something like absolute hell, you'd need frame-perfect inputs
It's because it's from a modded game (Last Impact)
It's a romhack, Last Impact.
It's a romhack (Last Impact), the author of the hack replaced all the levels, hubs, enemies and bosses with new ones. It's really really woth the playthrough.
Last Impact
Super Mario 64: Last Impact
This is Last Impact though.
It's a romhack, total modification of the game's levels, stars and challenges. The best one according to me is Star Road, because it really feels like SM64 2, and this one is Last Impact, it doesn't feel like the original but has way more complex mechanics, new powerups, enemies and bosses.
It is a romhack; you had to follow a snake block that would have lead you to the star, but he just skipped it entirely with this *quite impressive* flip.

I'm 17, and while I enjoy board games in physical form more than on video game consoles, I can imagine a bunch of reasons why someone would prefer them on the switch. Sometimes it's just more practical to have all your games on the same platform rather than carrying all these boxes around.
-It's easier to carry  
-You can't lose the pieces  
-You can't lose the cards  
-You can't break/damage the board  
-You can play it when there's no light  
-You can't cheat  
-You can't throw the dice too far and lose it under the furniture  
-You don't have the board game but you have the switch  
-You don't like physical board games  
-You can play it with friends in the bus/train/plane  
It is!

Something that would make me say 'yes' is, why would they give the kingdom a name if there's only one location in it? Why give the whole thing a name if you can only visit one specific place that has its own name?
I think it will be fashion-related, firstly because it literally translates to fashion in french, and also because there's already a food-themed kingdom.
Also, they confirmed that the ice crystals in Toastarena were temporary and that Mario could melt them off. So it's yet another version of the Kingdom.

Nah, basing their judgement of the Switch on the sales of a secondary game that the majority of people doesn't know would be pretty stupid of Rockstar.
But if the games are too demanding for the Switch, I think they should not come out altogether rather than having a watered-down version of a game with most of the content missing and downgraded graphics. That would give a bad image of Switch games and the Switch itself.
Old games on other systems are still new games for the switch tho, and from a company standpoint it's an easy way to make money by not developing new games.
I'm all in for new games for the switch, especially AAA/popular games since it's what it lacks, and what will define its success among third-party devs. I'm pretty sure RDR2 isn't coming to the switch (or at least *probably* isn't) because of power issues. Newer games are becoming more and more demanding; and while the Switch could run older games (GTA V for example) it might struggle running newer games, especially if the devs are too lazy to optimize.
They're old but they're good. Some people (me for example) haven't played any of them and might want to try them if they can play on the go. Skyrim sounds like it will be a huge hit on Switch.
And they are not only porting them, but also adding switch-specific features like gyro aiming, HD rumble, etc.
Looks like something from The Witness.

The Switch is at the very beginning of its life, so many more split screen games will come. Or at least many more than on other platforms.
Nintendo anyone?
I think you shouldn't remove a port until there is a better alternative. They removed the DVD player because digital is better. It doesn't scratch, doesn't break, you can transfer it anywhere, etc. Whereas the headphone jack has no viable alternative. Wireless headphones can get lost more easily, take longer to pair with the phone, usually have a worse sound quality, and you need to charge them. And in case you use the dongle, well you need a dongle, you can't charge your phone at the same time without an adapter and it wears out the charging port faster since you plug things in it more often.
Apple had litterally no customer-friendly reason to remove the port.
Also, the majority of people who care use their headphone jack daily and don't want to buy wireless headphones, or carry another dongle around. Also they never used the new iPhone because it removes a feature they love.
I think way more people care about a headphone jack than about a millimeter of thinness. Also, if it offers better waterproofing, Apple did not make use of it since there are phones out there with a headphone jack and a better waterproofing certification.
So you can do something you could do before, but with an extra dongle and no benefits at all. So what's the point of it?

You seem too stubborn to even understand the concept of ''different opinions''.

People want to theme their phone, their opinion.
Don't assume everyone uses their phone like you do, because that's not the case. Get your head out of your ass and look at actual people with phones instead of looking at yourself.

>who cares when you've got the fantastic iOS  indie game library

No matter how big the library is, you won't be able to play DS/GBA/N64 games. Nothing in the indie library can compare to these.

>In reality, the only two use cases for default apps worth mentioning are 'use google apps' or 'use apple apps'

if you use apple apps, they work together
yes iMessage opens Apple Maps, big deal. Send it to gmail instead

You don't seem to get the point here. Apple Maps sucks ass compared to Gmaps. It's way more convenient to open maps links in google maps. Plus it's not only Google vs Apple, there are many more cases in which you would want the phone to open a link in a specific app.

>oh wow

Top quality argument right there

>it generally does nothing of the sort

It absolutely does. Have you ever used Google Now? If you didn't / can't, watch a Youtube comparison video (though I'm willing to bet you won't, because you don't want your ''Apple is perfect'' bubble bursted)

>nobody who doesn't use their phone as a fidget spinner cares

Many people care. I'm sure even you hated the fac that you can't place your icons anywhere at least once.
Moreover, just because YOU don't theme your phone (you can't anyway) doesn't mean no one does. A lot of people install custom launchers or icon packs, you can tell by the number of downloads. But I'm pretty sure you won't even stop and think in another way that the Apple™ way.

The strength of the switch is not only its games but also its portability. Of course it's expensive, but you'll have more fun in more places with more people with a $320 switch than with a $6000 PC.
Of course you can play more games in higher resolutions, but that's not the point of the Switch. Unlike the Xbox or the PlayStation, the Switch doesn't try and fail to be a PC. The Switch s focused on being a fun system, with games that are not only focused on graphics, 60fps and 4k, but on gameplay and portability.
Now, you may still think the switch isn't worth it, but it's because you don't have an use for it. If you get to play MK8D with friends on a long bus/train trip, you'll realize why the switch is worth every cent you buy it with.

(Also, you don't need 3 joy-cons to play split screen. There are TWO joy-cons included with the switch, and you need (at least) one per person to play split-screen. And the Pro Controller is not a must-have. You can definitely play without it)
Yes   

And they're right, Nintendo has the thing to make their games insanely fun. You won't be able to play Splatoon 2, MK8D or the upcoming Mario Odyssey or Metroid 4 on your pc, and that only justifies buying a switch

Great app, I won't have to rely on clunky Reddit notifications. However, you should improve the look of the app.
Change the icon to a more material one and change the Play Store banner, as they're the first thing people see even before downloading your app. Right now, it looks like a cheap app and it's sad because the execution is very good.  
Also, stay away from the blue+pink colors, as it's the basic scheme every new app uses. Find your own color to make your app more distinguishable.

Apart from that, the app is very good. Keep up the good work! :)

Coins seem to be a pretty big part of the game.

Odyssey is secretely the prequel to Kingdom Battle
your mom came first
It's not that it's easy, it's that Kaze is fucking efficient
If they said "Kaze brings Super Mario Odyssey mechanics to SM64", almost no one would know him. Plus he's linking the actual video. How much more credit do you want?
Modder* He's alone in making almost everything.
Also we last saw him in his own game
Think what you want dude. The Switch isn't underpowered and BotW's lag is only due to a lack of time for optimization. Porting a game isn't just adapting the code, you need to optimize, and it takes way more than a year for games that big.
Where did I say1080p60? I said that if it were optimized for the switch it would run at a steady 1080p30 with no lag.
Say whatever you want, optimizing a game as big as BOtW from one console to another in one year is pretty damn hard. If it runs almost constantly at 30fps on a wii U, it could run wayyy better on the switch, which is more powerful, if it was optimized for it.
Have you even read my comment?
BOTW is pretty heavy on visual effects compared to, say, Odyssey, or other games.
Because the Wii U is less powerful; most lag on the Wii U does't occur on the Switch. Now if the game was coded specifically for the Switch, there would surely be no lag
BotW was initially made for the U and ported to switch in barely one year. So of course it won't be really optimized. The switch could do much more with botw.
Well maybe people just want to play a game they love on the go? If they released Portal and Portal 2 on the switch I'd be happy to buy them again.
Meh, Rocket Leage might be ported to switch if enough people want it according to the devs. If many people request one feature, GM's devs may consider implementing it. 
Also, there are lower quality games of course, but there are also excellent games such as Undertale, and with the ever expanding community this game gets, porting it to the switch would surely be a great idea. And who knows, seeing how Undertale is doing could make other GM users want to make their great GM games available on Switch. More games, if they're approved, can't be bad.
Let's get GM to support the Wii U & Switch then. Is there a petition yet?
How do you explain virtual console then? If people want to buy older games because they like them...
Mario.

I'll be buying a switch only for Odyssey.
(and hopefully VC games, Sunshine-TTYD-SM64 i'm looking at you)
I'd love a TTYD-like paper mario with the style of Color Splash. They perfectly nailed the paper style, now if we could get anything other than toads as main characters, and a story deeper than ''bowser stole peach'' it would be great.

Also a battle system that's not utter shit
But Toby said somewhere that if he made Undertale a console port, it would be on a Nintendo console. Maybe it's only Gamemaker that's holding him back.

Now hear me out. It's not an AAA game, it's a kinda forgotten game on the NDS, made by capcom I think, and absolutely no one I know has heard of it.

I didn't either until the day I wanted to play some new games. I was on a Wii U forum looking for good Virtual Console Games, and came upon this weird game I didn't know about, but every single of the 5 people in the comments seemed to praise it.

So I gave it a shot.

And, wow. Like, WOW.

The writing is awesome, the animations are absolutely fantastic (seriously though it's even better than what you could think of, [see for yourself](http://i.imgur.com/Zj9Ww5m.gif)), the gameplay is original, the characters have personalities...
And holy shit the story. I nearly cried at the end when the puzzle pieces came together.

I'd totally recommend it, I wish I could play it again without knowing the end.

Batteries are being improved constantly, scientists are discovering new materials to build batteries of, and it wouldn't be surprising to see a phone with a battery that lasts days and charges very fast.

Phones nowadays are merely water/scratch resistant. OP wants phones that do not break when underwater no matter the circumstances, and that do not scratch even with knifes or things like this.

''I don't like it therefore it's useless'' Very accurate argument, thanks. Flexible screens have many potential uses, wearing them around your wrist to not have them in you pocket, store them more easily, not having them break as easily, etc.

Google is developing Fuschia, an OS that wil supposedly work on both smartphones and computers. They might even merge Android and ChromeOS, as they started to make apps compatible, so you never know.

If you lost your phone with all your valuable info on it, there would be no repercussions on your stuff if you locked the phone properly. With the evergrowing number of new lock methods, I'm sure you'll find something that suits you.

OP is saying they'd like their phone to control all their devices, if you don't like the idea at least accept that other people like it. With the Internet of Things it's more than likely that one day smartphones will control every thing in our lives, and you'll have the right to not use this functionnality, so don't bash people who do.

So, the future isn't ''right now'', as everything you mentioned is either not possible yet or in development. I'm okay with correcting people when they're wrong but there you're just disrespecting OP's opinion and insulting them.

Both the Nova 2 AND the Nova 2??
Because you don't want the sequel to potentially ruin the series. Just like if Toby Fox made Undertale 2, it would probably not be as good as the first one as it covered pretty much everything while still leaving mystery.

Nintendo did it right with SM64; the DS remake has improved graphics, more areas and more stars while still preserving the spirit of the game. I think that's a remake done right, and way better than SM64:2 could have been.

OBViouS STATIREE§!!!
Well I've been using Android since 2011 and I've never had a virus either. I've stuck with the Play Store to install my apps and I've never gotten anything worse than an app crashing. ''Android makers'' as you say are paid well enough, look at Samsung or LG's sales over the past years, there are no serious bugs that haven't been fixed by Google or the manufacturers.
Fun fact, did you know that Google releases monthly security patches to Android in order to make it less prone to viruses?
The article you linked is from 2013. In 2015, iOS had way more vulnerabilities than iOS.

Also, the search results are saying the opposite of what you think, the top 10 articles are either ''why you shouldn't fear this Android virus'' or ''Google patched malware on Android'' or even ''this virus affects Android and iOS devices''. It says nowhere that Android has more vulnerabilities.

Plus, Android malware is only dangerous if you download shady apps from unknown sources. Apple viruses are caught by looking at a video that bricks your phone, receiving a text that bootloops your phone, or even doing nothing while people steal your iCloud data.
Hm, you're right. Still, the lightning port gets used twice as fast if you use wired headphones, but I guess it's to each their own. I wouldn't use a phone without a headphone jack.
Samsung makes their own cameras/processors/screens, basically everything actually. They made Apple's a9 processors and will make their screens for the upcoming iPhones.

But why would I go through the hassle of buying new headphones, pairing and setting them up when I could just plug in some wired headphones? What's the reason behind this ''improvement'' apart from change for the sake of change?
I'm all in for cutting edge technology and stuff, but removing the headphone jack really isn't any of this. I would have been ok with replacing it with something better, but they just plainly removed it with no real alternative. Wireless connecting is wayyy harder to set up than just plugging in headphones; and the quality is even slightly worse. Plus, you can't charge your phone while listening to music unless you buy yet another dongle, or Apple's ''revolutionnary'' tampon-looking $160 wireless headphones. Without mentioning the fact that plugging in both the adapter and the charger in the lightning port wears it out faster.
They should have kept the headphone jack and not removed it for the sake of changing something, it's not because it's 100 years old that it's bad. 99% of people use headphone jacks.

Samsung making nearly borderless screens with iris scanners, Motorola making modular designs or Google making top-tier cameras on the Pixel is real innovation. Removing a port isn't. Apple hasn't really done anything innovative in the last few years apart from the rarely used 3D touch, whereas Android manufacturers have been making constantly improvements to their devices, not relying on the fact that they have die-hard fans who will buy anything that they sell.
And I only see Macs and iPhones in the hands of dirty hipsters and shallow teens in Starbucks, how far can we take the clichés?
iOS / macOS is better for YOU. I couldn't stand using my brother's iPhone, because of the lack of customization, the poorly integration of apps, the wonky notification system, the slow animations, etc.
Also, a lot of gamers, myself included, will tell you that macOS is a terrible platform for gaming, because a lot of games lack Mac support.

So there's no objectively better OS, it's really to each their own.
Where do you get your sources? Last time I checked, macOS and iOS were the OS the most prone to viruses, whereas Android was 4th out of 6. [source (latest I could find)](https://techtalk.gfi.com/2015s-mvps-the-most-vulnerable-players/)
How about people buying the iPhone 7 when it has no headphone jack and saying it's the new norm? how about people buying the iPhone7 when the 6 bent and the 4 had connectivity issues if you didn't hold it the right way?

The thin line that separates apple addicts from loyal customers is the way the company treats them. When the note 7 exploded, Samsung acknowledged they made a mistake, reviewed their safety measures, improved the build quality and most of all they apologized to the customers and offered full refunds.

When the iPhone 4 didn't get signal when you held it the way you should, Apple didn't apologize and replace the broken series of phones; they said ''yeah you're holding it wrong''. When everyone complained about the headphone jack removal, they didn't acknowledge their mistake, they just declared it was ''the future'', ''courageous'' and stuff like this. Also you can't connect the latest Mac book to the latest iPhone, you need a $50 dongle for that. That's why ''sheeple'' define apple addicts. When a company fucks you over and over and treats you with no respect you shouldn't buy their products anymore.

Take a look at the s8 and tell me it isn't different
Greatly written. 
This isn't a good thing. People coming from iOS and who see that the default SMS app lags and isn't customizable and all will not think ''I can replace this app'' they'll think ''android lags, it sucks'' Customization is not something everyone is fond of, and not something everyone know about. If the default SMS/music/phone app is flawed, a large part of people will continue to use it and continue to complain.
Google must fix their apps, make them smooth and bug free if they want to push it on every phone.

Nice try
Every fucking time I have a relevant video someone already posted it
Or else it's just a game
With a japanese game? Sorry but this is just contradictory.
I'm not against using some video games as an example, as long as it's relevant. Using Pac-Man to show how American society is fucked up is just a bad idea. It's just a game. It's an anamorphic blob avoiding ghosts, how is that even merely connected to American society? 
How the hell did he download child porn? At 60? 99% of old people use Google and CP can't be found there.
The camera rotation is a little too soon, it ruined the effect :(
No, it's just stupid that people always try to push deep meanings on video games where the only goal is to have fun. Oh look, Tetris actually is a story about how you disappear when you fit in. And Mario! Mario is just a metaphor of how no matter how hard you search, what you're looking for is in another castle. Plain dumb.
The verge? Biased against Apple?
Guess who didn't read the article!
>Android doesn't do anything that iPhone can't

Apart from changing your launcher, your icons, your SMS app, your music app, setting default apps, changing your icons, drag-and-drop files to a computer, charging wirelessly, plugging in an USB device, automating actions, transferring files via Bluetooth/NFC, downloading music, installing apps from the web, playing old games on emulators, disabling / changing animations, changing your lockscreen, adding an SD card, etc. etc.

Nah, it would confuse the users..
It's ASMR let people enjoy things and mark these videos as "not interested"
•In **iOS 11**, we wanted to focus on minimalism and simplicity.

\*crowd applauses*

 And as courage is our motto, we decided to...

\*crowd gasps*

remove wallpapers.

\*crowd is silent*

\*...*

\*crowd goes wild*

\*Tim Cook, yelling over the crowd's cheerings*

Yeah! Who wants those pictures on the background? They're distracting! They're ugly! You can't even see them anyway, there are too many fuckin icons on the screen! Black bagrounds are the future! Black backgrounds are innovation!

\*crowd orgasms, one person dies of excitation, the room is lighted up by thousands of Apple logos on the back of Macs that people use to post articles about this revolution, and change their wallpapers to pure black to follow the trend*
Apple won't even let you change your icons/launcher they won't let you change your font anytime soon
How are people talking into a microphone fucked up? No one's forcing them. They're doing it by themselves. And those who enjoy it are just the same.
You should try NucleoUI from the play store, last time I checked it had the original icons
this is triggering my asmr
It's always such a pleasure
It has been removed :(

Oh okay, I barely use Reddit desktop so I didn't know that, thanks for clarifying. Maybe some kind of button to refresh? Because right now to get another random subreddit you have to close the sub, open the hamburger menu, touch the text field, input the name once more without autocompletion because it's not a real sub, and repeat. It's kinda long, and I guess a ''change sub'' button would not be that hard to add.
If I were to suggest something, it would be per-subreddit full theming. Being able to change fonts, background colors, text size, post layout; some subreddits, which are text-based, would work better with wide text and readable fonts, where it does not matter that much on pic-based subreddits. I know it would probably be super hard/impossible to do but you gotta keep adding features to be on top ;) Plus maybe adding support for more websites (eroshare, lightshot, gyazo etc.)

If not, maybe you could polish the app till' it's shiny clean. Remove every tiny bug, align
 every piece of text, smoothen up those animations, etc. Slide has gotten to a point where it's so great that it doesn't need any more features, but it still needs updates or it will feel abandoned. There are some very minor bugs that could be fixed (for example the ''No more posts - refresh'' text that gets glitchy when you scroll, or the fact that refreshing /r/random or /r/randnsfw doesn't work), and the app would be perfect.

I know it sounds condescending, and that's totally not what I wanted to sound like; coding is hard and you're doing great at it, your app is nearing perfection and it's the best Reddit client available to me!

Android O settings page, YouTube... why do they keep removing colors? This looks ugly.
The same thing as [this one gif](http://i.imgur.com/CoB92a8.gif), it makes me cry of laughter everytime
Yep, surely Google hasn't thought of that when writing the code, please tell them!
Instant apps is a feature that allows you to ''stream'' apps so you can try them without downloading them. It's not something to worry about.
Nah believe me I've had Snapprefs for like two years and the releases always have been very slow. It's mostly because the dev is a student and studies take a lot of time; plus Snapchat rewrites their code with every release so that makes it really hard for him to release updates quickly.
Paying for the app didn't include guaranteed updates, it would have been right to think that if you actually didn't get anything when paying, but here you get some premium features​. I get that you'd want at least some frequent updates, but it's really hard for the dev to keep up with Snapchat's mess.
That's why we need a theming engine.
Yep I know that, but they could just have added a ''My day'' FAB. But no, white action bar, rounded corners and all the shit. Why, Facebook, why??
That wouldn't help, even on AMOLED screens
[I can do it](http://i.imgur.com/FCknBvz.png) (It might be a Lineage feature though)
Why did they ever change from the blue UI thing? It was great.
Yes, the famous circle icons of iOS
Meh, buying an app is more like buying the dev a coffee because you think they made a great app. Most app state this. Plus the dev said (somewhere on reddit) he doesn't owe anything to anyone, and that he didn't want anyone asking for ETAs.
no death stare?
That's not a roast that's 10 seconds in the microwave
I bet she likes phoenix dick too
Is buying an app a guarantee for updates forever?
what the fuck is this Facebook bullshit

Oh, you want him to add his own money? How will he get it though, as he needs a credit card to pay for things?
There's an app called Opinion Rewards, made by Google, that rewards money for completing surveys. He might get some from there but apart from that he will need a credit card, I'm afraid.

With the family library though, if you allow him to buy an app, he will use your credit card, and you'll have to approve the purchase. If he wants to buy something when you didn't allow him to you'll just have to deny him the permission to buy it. (Also I think you can disable shared apps too)
You create an account for him; then, with your account, you create a Family Library on the Play Store's "account" page in the settings.

A Family Library allows apps/movies/games/books you buy to be downloaded for free by the other 4 accounts you can link it to; plus, every purchase made with the credit card associated with the account needs to be verified by the account owner. This way, you can both have your accounts and you can have control over what he buys and share apps you bought with him.

You should remove app icon labels, it will look better
I like the GPM icon placement
No we didn't unfortunately, we weren't done making the last letter you had already made the 6 and changed it into original :( We're 20 tops, we couldn't defend against your sub, we just want a screenshot
Yeah we just want a screenshot of our logo :(
Go back to iPhone then? the dev does not owe you anything. It's their app and they do what they want with it. If you want more tweaks, more updates, why don't you go and code them? You can't? Then don't shit on people who can.
It's a long story... I saw Marvin linking a scp as usual, wondered what post of him was the most upvoted, this post was in the top 5, I wanted to read scary scps and there I am.
