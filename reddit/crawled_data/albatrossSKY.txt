I had to know about that belly button scar. Found this.

 

**My illness**

I lost one whole school year because of illness though, so in high school I was a year older than most of the other kids in my class. What happened was I had gotten appendicitis, and it had seemed pretty simple and clear cut until complications set in. I developed a bad case of peritonitis, which you can die from a not-bad case of - and I almost died. I needed an emergency operation, and when I came out of the operating room the doctor told my mother that he didn't know whether or not I'd survive. I was given less than a 50-50 chance of pulling through. Well, I did live - through many might argue the point - but I was in the hospital for a month and a half, and when I returned home I had to take it real easy for several months afterwards. If you saw the Taboo Poster of me in the July SPEC and noticed those weird scars just above my... er, just below my belly button, that's what they're from. The doctors took enough poison out of me to flatten an army - four and a half quarts of it! I wish someone had though to save it - I could have used it in my show.


this is the seller i got it from. he had like 50 for sale when i bought it 3 years ago. none now. hes in philly though so im sure he gets will smith stuff all the time. wish i could have found it for you.

"Too big to fail"

Thats the mind set that is wrong with America. How is any one or any thing "too big to fail"? If the people dont like it or it sucks it fails.  If it lies cheats and steals then it fails. At what point as a company to you become "too big to fail"? It is at the core absurd. If they are doing things that could be considered wrong legally or ethically then they should not get to settle allegations. THEY SHOULD HAVE TO HAVE THEIR DAY IN COURT. Imagine how much wrong doing must have been done to pay out 1.9 billion dollars to keep it from coming out. A court case would have been a trillion dollar loss. And they are after all too big to fail

The only bad thing about this show is that it just ended.
Maybe it is because this is fucking [850 dollars with no contract](http://www.walmart.com/ip/37309994?wmlspartner=wlpa&adid=22222222227026794458&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=42967185152&wl4=&wl5=pla&wl6=81459111632&veh=sem). Make phones people can afford to get rid of in a year for a new one. Fuck.
I was reminded of [this](http://i.imgur.com/1fJnytz.png)
The rights ran out for these songs after 10 years. They wanted to re-release the game but could not legally do it with the original songs. So instead of pay more money for the songs they just didn't include them.

But i am not a doctor, I only play one on tv.

When David Letterman proposes that Norm do Weekend Update on his show every week (around 1:03:00 in the video) they should have made that happen. Really missed out on something classic there.

Graham Norton Show should be on tv in america.
I remember when Jimmy first got his show. I thought to myself this isnt going to last long. But here we are so many years later and its so good. One of the few late night shows you can turn and and its always good. He is a great host.
wanna lose an eyebrow? or more?
Came to say how great you are?
But I didnt ask a question?

You are a great actor andI love all the little movies youve done as well as the much bigger ones. Keep it up swartzman!
I love everything you do. Literally all your movies are good. Great actor. From the first to the latest one. thank you for doing what you do!

No questions. 
I would start checking all stunt drivers in the area.

What an awesome place to go. Knowing you are likely 1 of 50 people(or less) in that whole circle at any given time. Would be paradise.
I have this same table. Retailed for like 1200 when it was new. Works great as my weekly player.
can you just pm it to me?
i love how mad everyone gets.
I remember hearding the news him and shawn left tbs during warped tour that year. Straylight Run was a great project. but im glad they are back together.
but if the plane landed then that means the 239 people are likely alive. Where? In a prison? Used for crazy experiments? Brains wiped clean and released? where are the people??

When Greg died it really hit me hard. It was the first time I was really broken up over a famous persons death. He was so big on the recent roasts. Everything looked so good for him. I wish he wasnt gone.

Reddit is cool
We cant use these exact people but I like the general idea. 3 former celebrities out of work for years have to leave town after some kind of event happens, perhaps someone got word of a possible attack(not 9/11) or they were all invited by a forth person to a party. An epic road trip ensues, all kinds of twists and turns, the public see them and they become relevant again.

Where do I sign up to write scripts for things?

Have to keep fighting. The government couldn't help us in the first place.

This would be a great story in the game. Like a fork in the road and the user decides. That will give it replayability.
