My friend and I were once playing near an old abandoned house, and there was this steel pole that was really sharp on the top, it was probably a street sign. This friend put an aluminum pan (it was on the floor: homeless people used the house as a shelter and took out some of the tools and furniture) on top of it, climbed a nearby fence and jumped on it; when he landed on the thin pan, it was perforated by the aluminum and he got the pole in the ass.

Yes, if you've got ALL the epics, you can't find them anymore, same with other rarities
**FORMULA FOR FINDING PERCENTAGES VALID FOR YOU**

1)Sum the percentages of all the categories you can't find (ex: if you have all the common brawlers, all rares, you can't find them. You can't find star powers if you don't have at least one brawler at level 9, no level 10). 

2)Count the categories you can find (ex: of you have all the common and rares and no level 9, you can find coins+power points, super rares, epics, mythics or legendaries, so 5 categories).

3)Divide the number you got from step 1 by the number you got from step 2 (findable categories) and you get a percentage. 

4) pick the category you want to know your chance of finding, and sum to its percentage the number you got from step 3

Done!
6%
In that case the one you've made is perfect
You can sum the percentages of what you already have and divide by the number of available elements, then sum the result to the percentage of what you're searching. I've done this for you, assuming you haven't any brawler at level 9 so you can't find a star power:
Coins - 90,9%
Mythic - 3.2%
Legendary - 3%

I posted the same thing a while ago and it had only maybe 10 upvotes... Not you fault though, i agree with you.
Lol
Perhaps.... But i didn't have silicone so i improvised
STEP-BY-STEP TUTORIAL:
Materials: I only used a piece of plastic and some thick soft biadhesive tape (if you have only regular biadhesive tape and not the thick one you can use a small piece of rubber between the two layers of regular biadhesive tape). Here's how to build it:
1- Sagomate or 3d print a flat cross-shaped piece of plastic 
2- apply two layers of biadhesive tape in the middle of the directional buttons (if you want you can put some tape on the buttons too)
3- put the cross-shaped piece onto the biadhesive tape.
Done!

EVERYONE knows pizza and apple pie are not American, America didn't claim those. For the hamburger i have to admit you're right, but i think it's mainly for the fast food tradition.
Also, yes, if you put curry on pasta you can call or Thai style pasta, because you are using an INGREDIENT that is typical of the place, if not the national one. In this case tomato (that even came from America), mozzarella (ok this one can be a stand alone dish) and basil mean NOTHING in Italy's traditions, the national dish is pizza margherita, not basil/tomato/mozzarella... So unless you put pizza dough into chicken i doubt it can be called chicken Italia only because it shares some ingredients with its national dish.
Oh god... They can be considered "national ingredients" when they're in the national dish (margherita in this case) but in the pic they are NOT on a typical italian dish, they're on a dish that in Italy doesn't even exist!
National ingredients? So if i put some blueberries, ketchup and cream together it's America's national dish because it's the colour of their flag?
Oh, a totally typical italian dish then
Did you obscure your OWN username?

Why is it called chicken Italia when the chicken is British?
Is that from super mario odyssey? /S

Yes, in Italy people used "open/close the lights" until some years ago. When people emigrate they tend to translate the word even if it doesn't make sense

I thought you were another of those Nintendo haters, sorry
You must be so badass because you play on PC/xbox/ps and not on that childish switch thing, right? Who in the world wants to play games without blood and guts everywhere? Surely that game (what was it called? Ah, Zelda) is total shit and it's for children. Game of the year? What does that even mean? I care only about blood and violence, no blood= shit game for kids. Also, games enjoyable by kids are NEVER enjoyable by adults too. Then that non top CPU and the Nintendo logo on the rear means that that console is total crap.
Yes... -_-

In Italy there is literally a politician that once was a comedian.
Just to let you know, that advertise that as italian food, but it's nowhere near, the real recipe of "fettuccine alfredo" is fettuccine with butter and parmesan (that melts into a sauce). And surely it doesn't taste like frozen food advertised as italian outside of Italy.
Does European chocolate suck that bad in America?
In italian apple is "mela" and evil is "male". Coincidences?
First of all: this is an English-speaking subreddit, so also English. 
Second: STOP ASKING ABOUT ANDROID, even supercell doesn't know anything.
But women can do everything they want to men, but if a man does ANYTHING that isn't a compliment to a woman he's sexist.
3d world and odyssey are my favourite games, i feel like they're two different genres, 3d linear platforming (with amazing multiplayer given the small areas in which you can roam), and sandbox/adventure (in which i can't see multiplayer function so well, given the HUGE worlds).

Super Mario Odyssey is my favourite game for the switch. I always loved mario games, they're fun, colourful and challenging. I bought a switch mainly for odyssey and i'm playing at it a LOT. Even when the story finishes collecting all the moon's and completing kingdoms is good fun.
Hope it happens
