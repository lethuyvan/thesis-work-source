#WOMEN MIXED MARTIAL ARTS 

> **This subreddit is dedicated to the women's side of mixed martial arts.**
I hope you find who did this and school him properly. 
I see your point, i might try that. 

Also I‚Äôll see soon the ‚Äúcheated guy‚Äù and i‚Äôll ask him in person how many issues he had with the train wreck marriage and infidelity. 

Thanks for the tips tho. 
I asked few of my buddies they all (presumably) told me GO FOR IT. 

But this isn‚Äôt really the man issue. 
Some decide to let them race, some enforce team orders... 

I think best approach is to manage aggression. Let them race until it‚Äôs too late. 
1. I didn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs the same situation, i said they are similar. 

2. Violence is one thing i can‚Äôt tolerate, but i stated i‚Äôm not afraid of somebody hitting on her or anyone else. Because i strongly believe that foundation of a good relationship is treatment. If there is some hiccups i think that leads to infidelity, unhappiness and other troubles. Like butterfly effect if you know what i mean. 

3. I told you, SHE HAS NO KIDS. I WANT NO KIDS. Only thing that can be ruined is marriage. And i wouldn‚Äôt accept ‚Äúlet‚Äôs have a affair and i‚Äôll cut him lose‚Äù. That‚Äôs out of the question. 

Lastly i know about all replies, maybe i missed subreddit but i expected at least one woman that was in the same crossfire situation. Again i respect everyone opinion, and I‚Äôll think through about this. 

In meantime I‚Äôll increase my trainings to ease off the pressure. 
Vidimo se
Slazem se, ali problem je trenutno nemoguce rijesit. Prvo to niko ne kontrolira i kaznjava, prema tome suludo je riskirat ako ne moras. Split je nakupina smeca ljudskog i tesko ce se to prominit. I nije to samo tako s odlaganjem smeca...
1. The first time she wasn‚Äôt married, she was single. We started dating, she was older than me, almost like this one. They talked the same, they pretty much acted the same. She DIED in the accident. 

2. I wrote that already, i don‚Äôt see myself as insecure and overprotective in that way, and I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm giving my best to treat her like a queen. One thing that i can‚Äôt stand is violence, and i would lose my mind if she or any woman i know was treated that way. I told one, if he touches you just let me know. He is done and dusted. 

3. Few times we talked, we cross paths lately. She has no kids and that‚Äôs plus for me, because i don‚Äôt want them either. I mean i like my nephews but for like an hour, after then go to your mother and stop bugging me. So this is win-win. How i know her? Still not that great, we spoke about some things in the life (like moving to Germany, chasing opportunities (in love), music and stuff like that).

I hope this answers all your questions, feel free to ask if something bugs you.

Low BPM, i find it a bit housy. Nothing is wrong with that just sayin' someone might backslash me with less trancy track. No pun intended. 
Sweet left hook. 
I can be direct, that‚Äôs no problem from me. Only problem here is if that‚Äôs big impact to her. I‚Äôm trying to be sensible here as much as ridiculous this sounds.  

Also i don‚Äôt in what state her marriage is. For one thing i‚Äôm sure is most of the couples here won‚Äôt resort to the divorce (even if there is some physical abuse), and this isn‚Äôt some imaginary shit i really know few ladies that cheated, hot caught and move on! How crazy is that?! In that respect i can assume wide range of emotions in one relationship. 

Let‚Äôs say for the sake of argument she isn‚Äôt knock out (well i know few better looking women of her age) what she gets by exiting from the mediocre marriage? I know for certain she isn‚Äôt financially powerful, so that‚Äôs really dragging weight in anyone‚Äôs life especially when you are past the prime (on this weird society). 

It‚Äôs rather normal to hold on what you have, but does anyone looks for the other options/opportunities?

Once again i can‚Äôt believe no-one is been in this kind of situation from my standpoint or hers. 


It‚Äôs getting late, i‚Äôll go to bed. I need to swim tomorrow it‚Äôs getting hotter. üåä 

Thanks :)
If Apple makes the cars....
Maybe the break is the hard word, I was more looking for the subtle approach to see if there is a chance.

One thing baffles me reading all these comments, and I have respect for every single one, is that nobody takes divorce as the viable option. And I don't mean in my case like every marriage is 100% perfect and divorce is some abstract word. Even in my country (which is highly conservative and Catholic) we have 1/3 of marriages ending up with divorce. I can only imagine what will be in the more *liberal* country (there are signs of this on many ethical/sociological questions and research conducted in the past) but this is for another debate.

> Your "position" should be focusing on your move; not on trying to break up a person and her partner.

This was my goal from the beginning, tackle situation in a way that won't backfire or cause too much drama. With all this *"negative"* feedback I thinking of backing off, and if I do that eventually I don't know how will go through without know did I had that chance. Hipotetichly if this all goes without *playing with the fire* and I later found out there was slight chance I will go full retard. 


I'll gather all the comments and run it with my domestic redditors to see how they feel about this. 

I really expected at least one woman with a delicate situation like this and first-hand experience. Again I'm baffled.

2. Irska, odlicna tech zemlja, engleski+ jebe klima
3. SAD je u 3PM, i uglavnom je viza i ocena problem, kad odes u Dojcland mozes kuci, kad odes priko bare nema povratka
4. Francuska, ne vole nas :D, tezak jezik, mislim da ni nemamo tamo toliko nasih
5. Svicarska, nadaj se. Utegnuta zemlja, standard bolestan, dobit ces dozvolu nikad mozda ni tada (iman par ljudi tamo, godinama su na privremenoj). Upast je lutrija


Sve u svemu, Njemacka je blizu, dovoljno je velika za posa i zivot, i jako se dobro slazemo s svabama. Nasi su tamo godinama tako da se lako i snadjemo. Dosta velik standard u odnosu na nas, ristrikcije skoro nikakve.

Nazoves i vidis mob, ja iskreno nebi dava pare na nevidjeno. 
HINT: Prodava san svojedobno mobitele (i sad ubacin koji ako je para ok) i bilo je ljudi sta su na nevidjeno uplacivali 5000+ na racun. Ja im se divin. Inace kad kupujem onda face2face, provjerim IMEI i racun. Cak san zna slikavat osobne.

Jedna anegdota, dobijem HTC gratis, sjeban ne pali, provucem ga kroz garanciju (gol mob, bez papira, znan ljude), dobijem novi. Stavin ga na oglas za 2800 (kada su takvi polovni bili 3200), javi se lik da ga occe uzet. Sve napisano u oglasu. 1/1. Dodje, pogleda (vidi da je novo, gol mob) i ja mu dan samo servisni nalog (za garanciju buducu), poveo priku jer ka ima isti telefon. Kupi.

Nakon par miseci, kaze znas sta se desilo (que???), priki policija dosla na vrata. navodno lik je ukra osobnu, uzeo mobitele na pretplatu i vlasnik osobne je sve da na policiju, policija pobrala telfone :D

Eto, nije sve tako sivo kako se cini. Pamet u glavu, ako je mob zatvoren, vidisi **IMEI** na kutiji i racunu, i amen. Kod jabuke mozes odma isti IMEI provjeriti da li je aktiviran (i koliko ima garancije ako je ima).

[**criterion collection**] (https://www.youtube.com/user/criterioncollection) features some directors which then pick their favorite movies, which they consider great and what influence their work. Also, I'm subscribed to the NerdWriter and he has some great analysis. 

I'm opened to suggestions too since I'm always looking for the less known and commercial movies. 
I can try, but I would like to avoid the hassle of Windows reinstall. Maybe someone has the same problem like I have and knows the solution. (which I doubt because in my life everything is upside down). Thanks for the effort tho.

My 2 cents. I watched movies on various setups, and be sure if you don't want to spend serious money on the projector and the projector screen you'll have a bad time. TV is a far better choice in terms of money and flexibility whereas the projector is the pain in the ass if it isn't set up right and you have bad lighting. 

Go for the pricy TV with big diagonal. 
Ted was caught napping really. 

I wish Crisitan roasted him, he was so unprepared. 
He is certainly the top fighter, I can't blame the guy for not fighting the Conor or Tony, he tried, he put the effort and he can't influence the outcome of the booking/them willing to fight. 

He stated he is ready for both of them, I really want to see both of them in the cage with Khabib. I think Khabib is an animal, but some hybrid like Tony has a good chance against the man that is really open on the feet. Also, I want to see both of them on the ground with probably one of the best wrestlers in the UFC. 

In that regard they are all the champs, now we have to match them up together (already).

The last thing I've watched is *ŒöœÖŒΩœåŒ¥ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ* (*Dogtooth*). 

A really good movie, that is for some so unsettling and disturbing. *Yorgos Lanthimos* really tried to justify everything and all subject are relatively ordinary. Sex is just a thing, nothing shocking. I really like it. 

It's not all blood and gore like *A Serbian Film* for example. This is well written and really excellent executed movie. I love the camera work especially. 
Dr. Mark will be mad as hell. This is good points flushed down the drain. 

Cristian is usually very communicative guy but today he was furious. Someone needs put stop to the wild Max. This hurts more the team than the driver. And this is the second time in two races he is on the very limit of everybody's space. He fucked Vettel now Ricciardo. It's not fair. 


How did you come to that conclusion? :)
Reminds me of my fav Mika in Monza 99. Fin luck I guess.
Good montage. Song is very suitable :) 
How will this reflect on future contracts (if any) with Ricciardo? Max is out of control and now his own team suffers from his madness. I like racing, but he is sometimes stubborn as a mule. 

If I'm in Ricciardo's place, I would ask for some intervention if they have remote chance to sign me up. 
Thanks, this is the really good reply. 

If she's a cheater I don't want her, I mean I would know already. 
You mad a good point on the backfire and returning. 


Yeah moving to Germany is one of the ways to complete my goals, and it's exciting and partly new. I'm looking forward to it. 

I'll go back once in a while, but I feel like I'm wasting my time on meaningless stuff and relationships. 


So she should strip out of the blue? That's far-fetched even for the movies. Those little things are just, you are not a creep, and I can talk to you. I don't believe that any married woman would go that full retard. Maybe she is thinking the same, but she needs to be cautious as I'm too. 

> I don't think a married woman is going to ditch her marriage to marry you when all you've done is have friendly conversation.

Nor do I, but still you have to start from somewhere and stop if something goes wrong.
What makes me think, those little clues she pointed (vs others people in relationships). I don't I'm special, I might be completely wrong and f***** disgusting, but I don't know that. Appart from smiles and stuff. That's still harmless. but I can leave it alone (and never find out) or find out (and hit a wall). 

For me best thing would be that HE does some mistake. 
I see. But we ain't friends already, I have very few friends (true friends, willing to help 24/7/365) we are acquaintances. There is not much I can lose from this. Also, this is not a battle, I would stop at the first sign of rejection. 

I didn't cross the line. I'm just checking. And I certainly don't want to make a scene. 

On the side note, we are living in a pretty conservative country and every step is 3 times thought and analyzed before, and some people tend to eat shit than pull a plug. I know a few couples that are unfaithful but married. Just because of this conservative stigma around here. 

I'm not trying to justify anything, just to look from the other angle and get a input from other people. 
And what is the solution to this problem? Really? I can only poke around until she gives the green light? 

Should she divorce out of blue and seek for me? Or somebody else? 
That from my standpoint. If he is a real man, she will shut me down and it's over. If she isn't happy (that much) and sees this as opportunity why wouldn't she proceed? 

Also, I've waited 6 years for the second shot. I might be biggest POS but i wont skip it. 
I didn't state she is mine. Smiling is a start, I didn't go full retard. All this is still harmless. 

There is nothing to fuck up if she says NO. Then I'm done and dusted and I can move on with a defeat. I can take a punch. 

The last thing I want is to f**k her. She is really smart and nice, which is why I like her. I stated in the first post I can get first-class body soulless shells. 
That's a good point too. And I discussed that with my married female friend. My stand is this:

1. I wouldn't be mad
2. If she treats her like a queen, he's got nothing to be afraid of.

My logic is, if you treat your woman like a queen (and this is no joke), no man can take her away. Also, I would like him to make a move on me, I would tell him this. I found jealousy as a big sign of insecurity. 

One thing that bothers me, if he goes physical. 

 
That's the point, I don't know if is THAT happy. It's still all harmless but I won't back off easily. 

Divorces are a thing you know. 
I forgot to add in the first post, we spoke about some couple and my friend like the particular girl, and she I quote said: "you can't miss the opportunity". Maybe I misunderstood this, but she is all *fight for love*. 

I'll definitely make a move because if I don't I'll spend the rest of my life wondering and hating myself for not trying.  
Thanks :)
To be fair my aim is E92 335d but that‚Äôs just Euro5, and i really don‚Äôt like newer ones. If i go for 335i that will put 2x gas expenses at least...

I‚Äôve been using (continuously) iPhones since the 4 (and i think iOS was 4 back then), and this is biggest clusterfuck iteration ever, this beats iOS7 on the iPhone 4. Seriously. 
Good comment. Slazem se u potpunosti, em nije neka vrijednost, em nije stabilna vrijednost, em valuta nije vezana za zlato. Samo trosak. 
Kojeg si roda, ovo bi moglo proc pod nasilje :D
Mala jesi li reketar? 
ok ;)
It's random. Sometimes work for a day, sometimes starts with next song (or point of time). And it's not related to LPM, because i tested normal mode and still happens. I didn't find anything that i can tie to this (notification, call, or something else). It's random. 
About since the 11.3 came out.  Try to slide from chat to the chat list. 
What about the sound?

I refuse to believe this isn't related to the iClusterFuck11. It's annoying as much as jittery/laggy music.

That‚Äôs tastefully updated F40, i simply love that episode.
I don‚Äôt listen to music in the car, but it‚Äôs frustrating during the workout. Too bad they didn‚Äôt fix it with 3.1 update...
I‚Äôm sober where is my flat?
Hraliban. Moja ima samo par cm :/


Nikad nije kasno
Mislim da je vise hipotetski ispitivanje da li virujes onome sta ti xy kaze, tipa ja kazem da ima 30cm prangiju a ti mi ne virujes i sl. 

Sta je cudno u nas kad je korupcija na velikoj razini, znaci nema povjerenja i sustava vrijednosti. Tako ja to gledan. 
To je demagogija. Probaj slozit iMac Pro vs PC, slicno kosta. I sad to sve spakiraj u monitor (5K).

Ljudi bacaju drvlje i kamenje na Apple, ƒçinjenica je da su proizvodi kvalitetni, dobro dizajnirani, dolaze s ukljuƒçenim softwareom (vecina nas samo gleda pc 10000 kn, ko jebe 1500 kn za winse i sl). I na kraju stari C2D laptopi se prodaju po 200kn dok slican Mac ide po 1000+ kn. 

Dodaj k tome i neke eksluzive (Final Cut, Logic Pro i sl) i sve ti je jasno. 

Moram iskopat test di se renda video, Apple laptop ubije mnogo jaceg konkurenta samo zato sta ovaj ima POS Adobe Premier. Koji je neoptimiziran do bola.

Thank you for the information, so now we are 3 here. I‚Äôll test today how music reacts after 3.1 update. At least when this occurs i don‚Äôt think about the pain üòÇüòÇ
This community is a massive ciclejerk and so far i didn‚Äôt find the cause. Today i went running and i turned on Runkeeper and Deezer, after some time phone starts to cut down songs. This time was in the **regular power mode** so this rules out LPM. I blame the latest update.

And yes screen sometimes is randomly frozen for a few seconds. Going insane. I would fuckin smash my phone when this happens during the workout, i‚Äôve a lot shit on my plate without jittery music. 

**EDIT**
11.3.1 is out, let‚Äôs see if this fixes the problem

* prika (zajedno bili u stranci, jeben momak, nacitan i sposoban)

* dosta rodbine (starijie i mladje od mene, od tetki mainly)

* par susida (sve ok momci, nista kriticno)

I don't agree, but that's your opinion and I respect it. 

Some are melodic on that list above, but you can take Gouryella and you can't compare to FC or Tiesto's recent work. I wrote about that on several occasions, a new track (most of them at least) are way overproduced for some reason. They are like more festival tracks than real old (simple) bangers. 


Maybe this is the way industry works (and i don't have anything against people living of what they do) but this isn't just nostalgia. Or if you will, you can post tracks that are >2004 that sound old. Danke. 
I know but you can instantly remember classic like *For An Angel, Carte Blanche, Age of Love, 1998, Children, Xpander, Strange World, Synaesthesia* and so on. Few tracks in recent years stuck in my head like that. Yes they are energic, complex, futuristic, but they are commercial on top of that. 
IDK man, that's not the trance. But I'll look into. 
I know, but once in a while they could release one track for proper fans and their soul and keep on printing generic tracks.

Like they all forgot "the old" sound.

* Za Dom (Spremni) - universal way to Say hello 

* Bog i Hrvati (hrvaci sometimes) - God in the sky, Croats on earth (also short for Bosna & Hercegovina, which is our land)

* Komunist - You must be aware of that, Ruskies, Serbs and other scum

* U - you use this all wrong, it‚Äôs not You, this is most important latter and must be CAPITALIZED always. 

* IK - istanbulska konvencija or eastern evil

* BVB - Bog Vas Blagoslovio, this is second best greeting in Croatia, simply Poglavnik > Bog

* prostitucije ce biti bez obzira na legalnost

* ilegalnost same donosi vise problema (osiguranje, svodnici, droga, zastita zena/muskih)

* POREZ


Moralnost samog posla mi nije za razglabat, ali definitivno san protiv restrikcija (mozda cak neko i uziva i pritom zaradjuje), legalnost bi osigurala laksu kontrolu, manje skrivanja i sl. Znamo svi da je siva ekonomija losa zbog osipanja poreza i zbog losije kontrole kvalitete i sl.

Tipa od Zadra do Dubrovnika, najvise volin A1 jer mi je magistrala cancer s ‚Äúgradovima‚Äù koji su jos veci cancer.


Sigurno imamo lipota tipa Plitvice ali to su sve mikrolokacije, na makro razin bokte maza kad krenes od Sinja starom cestom bog je reka laku noc 1848.

Zagorje mi ima lipih krajeva, gori oko Varazdina (valjda nisan falio kategorizaciju), ali generalno kad krenen prema slavoniji smori me lose vrime i zemlja. Iako ima lipih krajeva.

Cesta Udbina-Plitvice je bomba meni, nesto kao i cesta prema Jablanicu u BiH. 


E da hitno tribamo peljesko most, jer je jug hrvatske saka u oko. 
Ja sam zadnjem reka, da se ne natezemo saljem ti CV i trazim 10k misecno. Take it or leave it. 

Ne prodaje mi price, davi me na mob davi me da dodjen na sastanak. Fuck that. Sta je reka jedan moj kolega ne ustajem
Iz kreveta ispod 200kn.
Aj sad neka neko napravi overlay mape, ovo mi izgleda od ljubljane do skopja :D
Na nicemu. Oba su jaki borci, joshua je iskusniji ali ima 4 borbe manje, Parker je opasan udarac s ozbiljnom snagom. Realno ne ocekujem da ce proc, ali kad je kvota 6 zasto ne.

Na miocica san bio dosta sigurniji i ulozio dosta vise, ovde 20kn da mi je lakse gledat fight.


Ne znam kako to ide, ali zar nije texe dokazat nesto bez dokaza nakon x godina? Pogotovo kad je nesto delikatno poput silovanja... ü§î 
Most certainly. Imagine Joshua in the UFC fight. 
Jasno, ali sta ima sada kad je pobigla u irsku? Natezanje s DO i gonjenje maka na konac...

Nakon toga velika vecina bi digla pozdrav drzavi (i bili blokirani, te unistili sugavi zdravstvo i mirovinski sustav), sta bi sigurno rezultiralo vecim animozitetom prema Audiu A6/8 i sl egzibicijama sta se prilama priko ledja poduzetnicima i ostalom puku.

Kazem to je drugi mindset, velika firma, i definitivno s velikom pozadinom. 


Opet mogle su place rast vjerovatno sukladno rastu firme, mogli su ljudi dobivat equity, ali kako bi gazda kupio mega jahtu, zivio u **THE DVORCU** ili se voza s nekoliko helihoptera? Jednostavno nema toliko para za sve platit...

Kad nesto silis ne daje ploda. Tribaju se stvorit pretpostavke za lakse dizanje placa, a to sigurno nije forsiranjem zakonskog okvira o istima. 

EDIT disleksija
Da.

Prvo lidl je jaca firma:
>  In 2016, Lidl generated revenues of roughly **22.49 billion** euros.

od agrokora:
> Revenue: **6.435 billion** EUR (2015)

Shodno tome ima vecu moc nabavke sredstava bilo financijskih bilo materijalnih, ima podrsku banaka i investitora (dok ovaj retaj krive firmu od burze ko djava od tamjana, plus "kuha" izvjesca). Znaci Lidl ima sigurno veci profit, pa moze vise ulozit u radnike i radnicka prava, jer na veci promet mu vise i ostane (vlasnicima). I tako grabe naprid, guraju, i radnici ih vise cijene nego one uboge tete iz Konzuma gazdu u helicu.

Eto. Pametniji managment i veca firma. 


**EDIT**

**U**vik podji od sebe, kako bi ti radio. Stvar je pohlepe, stvar je pameti, stvar je xy stvari. Neko sklepa sezonu pa kupi G30 BMW-a, neko pak plati radnike i ne kuka kako nema istih za sezonu (kao ovaj prvi), ali nakon par stabilnih sezona kupi bolje auto. Ovaj prvi je tada mozda propa (i otvorio 5. jdoo), ali gonja bimmera.

Mug face of teds wife
Lots of hypothetical talk here but i like it. This might take longer than i though.

First of all, it‚Äôs hard choice but i think i would go for it. Reason behind this is my current wealth or better yet lack of it. Being without much money and weighing every decision based on limited resources can be hard. I think most of us can relate to this. That being said, i think grumpy woman can‚Äôt irritate you that much as lack means to fulfill your simple dreams. For example I‚Äôm driving E46 330d now, and i really like E92, but that‚Äôs like very very distant dream (which is only 25k grand for very good examples). 

But even if i go for something smaller like tasteful upgrades to my current car i must choose wisely because of limited resources. 


So naturally with all inexperience with being reasonably wealthy i always prefer to go rich route. Maybe if i know how it‚Äôs to be rich and (less) happy i would appreciate my state of life more. I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm very very happy or sad, just average.  

So choosing grumpy repulsive wife with lot of money, i think i could offset those drawbacks by doing more what i actually like (but can‚Äôt do in such extent now) like driving shitload miles, visiting cities, learning new stuff, working on my car, enjoying the life as it is. 


That‚Äôs why i liked TG and TGT now, i think they have really laidback life and doing this like a simple hobby. Enjoying various cars across the globe. Sign me up for this. Would take it without hesitation and paycheck. Just unlimited fuel and cars. 



But again this might be so wrong and superficial from me. 
Aha, that‚Äôs right then. 
You cant do that in app, only safari.
With ugly wife and shit load of money, you could make your life pretty nice. Bunch of cars, nice house, travel everywhere with your ugly wife. I would do that, in fact i‚Äôm not so much into modern beauty trends anyway (and prettier means shallower almost exclusively) so you‚Äôll get tired of pretty wife eventually. On top of that constant fear will someone pound her while you work your ass (because you are poor)... my two cents.
Ugly wife. 
When I was in Germany, I expected car no older than 5 years, oh boy how I was wrong.

Problem with old cars in developed countries are bans and taxes, and they literally push you with "buy a new car" laws. 

Which is bad if you want top-notch old car, to actually enjoy. 

E30 is much rarer because they are beat up or in garage maintained well. 
This is real petrolhead, working on car and driving nuts of it. One and only M5 E39 <3

I don't want risk anything. If i can't bring car without importing it, i won't bring it at all (i can sell it for better price here). If i import car in the Germany (which is easy from what i read) i can't export it back (if i go back or want to sell it here) without crazy taxes that Croatia requires. I think this sums this up:




> *If you move to another EU country (you intend to stay there over 6 months) and take your car with you, you will need to register it and pay any relevant fees and taxes in the new country.*

> You must **register your car as soon as possible** and in any case **not later than 6 months from your date of arrival**. You should also check what documents and formalities will be required as evidence to register your car.
I‚Äòll check that when i get on PC, as for address goes i know i have to register there (all my friends and family did this) but non of them didn‚Äôt bring their car. So this is unknown territory for me. 

Thanks!    
Bone stock. I really maintained it well so far. 

I mean i could sell it now, but then i'm fucked. I don't have car for Germany and i don't know how this work will pan out. So this is just backup for me and it's more convenient.

Personally my full tank is around 550HRK now, and usually takes me for 800km. If i swap out wheels and get 0.5L/100 that would take me to 850 km. Marginally better with ugly taste in my mouth every time i see my car.

So yes it varies from person to person but i don‚Äôt it‚Äôs worth the sacrifice.

And what‚Äôs with brake ventilation in cars that don‚Äôt use regenerative braking? I assume it‚Äôs pain in the ass going downhill...
Is it reliable considering it's twin-turbo N47? 
Actually, the song played [*Panjabi MC - Mundian To Bach Ke*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4C3umDN3voo)

Dunno, i won‚Äôt change my wheels for let‚Äôs say 0.5L/100, but i would exchange them for 4L/100. 

Wheels can transform the car more than anything else IMHO. I don‚Äôt like some cars (mainly weird lines, i like boxy cars) but good set of wheels bumps their look by some margin.

So it‚Äôs all about cost benefit here. Because i prefer slightly less gas mileage (ev range) than butt ugly wheels. My **threefidy** cents.
Hard alright 
Yeah lot of fighters says the same *he/she is a legend* but still they end up mauled in the octagon. Like that Struve guy *one more legend defeated* (but that shit hit a fan for him). 

And this isn‚Äôt only related to fighting. IMHO he should start some academy (here) and pass some of his experience to younger lions. That way he would be a legend teaching newer generations. 

I wish him the best tho as a fighter and as fellow countryman, he did big stuff for croatian recognition in the world. 
I know, and he does that every time he jumps back in the cage. And always is some injury and stuff, I don‚Äôt like how he is dragging his name through the mud. I see croatian tag, so you know how *Mavrovic* did, after the first loss, retired and never come back. He still spars and trains, but nothing more professionally.

I hear you, but with that much willingness, they will find the way. Even if you do strengthen the laws around profit and taxation, I think you'll rather spend some cash to lobby and persuade politicians to skew laws in their favor. This is really shitty for small business that doesn't have that luxury. 

I watched some *Panama papers* documentaries, and I really enjoy how they play politicians and laws. There are even dedicated companies just for advisory and lobbying. 

So my thinking was if they lower to some extent costs fewer people will actually pursuit ultimate cheapest way. At least it will negligible benefit for less than top companies. That's how I see it.

I installed this app mainly because faggots don't blink if they spot pigs, maybe 1/10 cars will flash if they spot coppers.

I think current rate in Croatia is 1 out of 3 marriage ends up with divorce (and those are married, we cant count those who ain't). That's pretty high for me IMHO, again with alcohol or cigarettes you probably have less chance to get shit in the return. 
Yeah, but potential consequences involving two or more people are multiplied at least by 2.

One glass won't haunt you for the whole life (assuming you didn't crash on that day and stayed paralytic), while nudes are there, hanging and waiting for some setback. All being said, I think nudes are (if you are ashamed by possible release) more threatful than a glass of wine. 
> Thankfully I didn't have my face or hair in view of the camera. So my ex leaked mine, sent them to a bunch of my friends. Even if they did think it was me, there wasn't any proof.

*After a review, the team discovered a suspension arm defect led to the entire right front upright collapse, which snapped the wheel tethers and created the dramatic effect. His team-mate Jaimie Alguersuari avoided a similar problem.*

*Although each wheel is supported by ultra-strong and much-tested tethers, designed to hold them in place in the event of accidents, Toro Rosso has explained that both front wheels were able to become airborne because the tethers were connected to the suspension parts which failed.*

Reminded me of *Jacques Villeneuve 2001 Australia...*
Gotta farm mad karma. 

A friend sent me this in WA group and I though it's a good reminder. 
Youtube dark mode is screwed. Currently you cant see titles because of stupid contrast. https://imgur.com/a/XSdFc
I love old ones, i watched them while back. Now it‚Äôs time for rewatching whole series. 
They have a free 30-day trial, i'll check that out. I'm in Croatia, so shipping isn't selling point tho. 

I need first 13 seasons, after that I have Netflix. Or better yet if I find the whole thing on DVD/Bluray I might purchase that as well. They are really good until they sacked Jeremy. 
Damn, i'll need another subscription. Thanks :) 
Reminds me of [**Senna saving Eric Comas at Spa 1992**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryP1ZNsYhZA)
So lowering actual power of the EM wouldn't have any impact on the range? Like overdrive for the ICE cars? Last gear to lower revs and fuel consumption? 

I'm familiar with air resistance, I watch F1 and I know a bit about aero. 
Trucks/pickups for cowboys:-D

That render is so sick tho. 
Thanks. 

I need rob a bank to get one. They are so nice. I wonder will they make wagon ([like rendered here](https://gearheads.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/tesla-model-s-wagon-render-1024x576.jpg))
Yeah i told them this. Tesla is practically supercar quick 7 seats sedan, makes almost no noise, and with reasonable speed is in most cases is enough for anyone.  With more widespread of EVs we‚Äôll get the benefit of better charging networks and more battery research and development. 
I know about legal speed, but they are breaking my balls over it. I really thought some low power motor could have big impact on ‚Äúfuel‚Äù consumption. Like for city driving, you need range and low speed, something that has long gearing will work low down and consume less. At least that‚Äôs the case with low power diesels. 
What can i say, they are perfect fit in my opinion. 
Huayra is good, different than Zonda, but i like Zonda better. 

[I wouldn‚Äôt mind driving this tho.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TXyV9Lxy0Bk/maxresdefault.jpg)

So prior that you couldn‚Äôt get MTech bumpers? 
But if they ditch acceleration all together making car like 6-7s to 100(60) and doing 250(155) with way less power and power draw. Like really long gearing. Would that work? 

I know dual motor cars are crazy fast, but they have some added weight just for rear/front motor instead of cutting weight and that punch from start. 

So is this possible or my theory is far fetched?? ü§î
Pagani Zonda is my all time favorite car. 
manual for enjoyment, but as a daily driver in city i prefer auto too. 
She is lovely 
On plus side, you don't need squats :D 

But I feel you, I did a lot of city driving due to my job, and I know how is it to drive a stick. 
As an Apple fan, they should really rub Apple's nose with it. 

A stupid trend they started with that no headphone jack shit. I really hate it. 
Yeah, you can always swap out for the manual when she ditches the car. 
Low mileage tho.

Is it manual or automatic? 
Would take a dump. 
Keviiiiiiiiiiiin
Yeah that could be it, i have sport steering but no suspension, bumpers and seats... although E46 pfl looks ok without mtech unlike FL and E39.

Nice car anyways, we don‚Äôt have much V8‚Äôs here...
Envy. 
Dunno, but you are missing at least m tech bumper.

[Here is 540i M](http://i.imgur.com/9mu0doc.jpg)
Looks mean AF. Congrats. 

People usually hate black on black, but I find it almost perfect. 
Where is the M bumper?
I would go for Alpina, especially after [this commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-6K350r7ms).
I remember front page of *Auto Klub* here in Croatia, somewhere around 2000‚Äôs. Great car, fall in love immediately. Great cars from that era, Pagani, Ferrari and Porsche.
>  "lightly baked" skin

that's not politically correct. 
I'm debating with some my friends. They got me cornered with low mileage (at higher speeds, 90-100mph 150-160kmh in normal numbers). 

So I have the question, could Tesla make less powerful model possibly with longer gearing to reduce power draw (and punchy acceleration) and get more distance out of battery pack? 

In comparison, some decent diesel goes sub10s to 100(60) but still doing 250(155) on long straight. Tesla is in most cases sub3s car (hypercar territory) with a relatively low top end and really high *juice* consumption at those speeds. So I figure, longer gearing and less power would do the same? (but again tesla could figure that out if is viable).

They roll the dice. If you are on Reddit you'll get mad karma, if you ain't you won't post it. 
I sold my hardware and made some profit after few years of usage. 
My point is between the 730d (i think that's "shittest" 7er) and the 760i difference is power, between shittest Model S 75 and 100 difference is range. And if you go for range (not power) base model is 98k euros. This isn't performance model, just range. 
That's like shittiest Tesla Model S...

I meant at exact about that, Hollywood pumped industry. Smaller "independent" industries are not real industries for me, I correlate this to mass production and box office numbers. That's why asked, I mean *Seventh seal* cant push you into Hollywood exactly. 
Unavailable until mid may. I hope that someone will sell me his case :D


Don't get me wrong, but isn't that a bit oxymoronic here? *Seventh seal* isn't the commercial movie for my understanding, and working in the industry you are supporting films that you watched before it. Or you working with indie guys? 
Don't be ignorant. Probably one of the best writers/directors. 
Great movie. 
Love it so much. 
Shoutout if anyone has v3 and it's willing to sell, drop me a PM :) 
I have one more mATX 2600k build, but i really wanted to upgrade 4790k to 8700k and go this small kind of crazy. O really love small builds. 

Linus did great build with this case, although i won‚Äôt go that far. 8700K + 32GB DDR4 + GTX1070/1080. I have SSD from this build and future upgrade is M2 SSD. 
Fuck I‚Äôm out of the luck. I sold my mATX setup in order to build ultra small 8700K system. I guess i‚Äôll order all besides the case. I made subscription to their site if this thing becomes available before... 
I want lock individual apps to, like without app support for that (dropbox, gdrive and some apps have login touch id). That would be awesome, system wide TouchID for opening apps.

Reminds me of the Top Gear and Laguna Seca corkscrew corner with PS2 and real life. 


You do realize this an old audi a4? 

I don‚Äôt know about new cars, but this really good save by esp.
Was on pc, phone has autocorrect tho. Also not native so, mea culpa. 
ESP and individual ~~breaking~~ braking, no matter how good the driver you are still you cant brake one wheel and get that level of reaction and forces. 
I don't think he'll do that, rain is his best bet. But if you look like that, he should be behind the wheel at all. 

But you need really bad suspension lots of grip to do that. 
You go to some deserted parking lot, you drive forward and do some sudden action like swerving. Try to catch it. Repeat. Also, try ‚Äúdonuts‚Äù (even if you don‚Äôt have LSD or RWD) and try to catch it. Drive in circles and change the gear and stuff like that. 

And if it‚Äôs raining better yet, because everything is amplified. And you‚Äôll get the feel how the car handles when you do so sudden action. The most important part that you find big space, so nothing can go wrong if you spun (you will). 

You can google for some skidpad videos [here](https://youtu.be/6BitLl5Bnxw)
Did you know that brakes in some situations are useful? When you out of lock but you need to correct it? [Max Verstappen used this at Brazil GP 2016](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWgL7_pkyHY) and regained control by breaking the traction at front ;).
It's internet did you expect differently? Everyone is expert on everything. 
Practice, and if you are doing 140 prepare yourself for impact. You really need to know the car like pro driver to escape some skids at 140.

Also practice. And practice some more. 


A few days ago I saw a car crash, man is ejected from the car. Wear seatbelt all the time, you never know. Also bad habits, phone, texting, one hand at the wheel, bad seat position, shifting in the corner, violently dumping the clutch... Don't do that. 

**EDIT** 

*Smooth is fast!* Remember that at all times. 

Again if you can, practice on some parking lot, to get an idea what to do when all hell breaks loose. Believe me, you won't correct the slide even with 30 km/h at the beginning. 
ESP. Look at this;
[What happens to a Lamborghini Gallardo when you switch traction control off?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I86mQZJWabU)
Not many drivers are good with these kind of situations, no matter how they kid themselves. That‚Äôs why electronics saved many lives. It‚Äôs nice to watch Schumacher, R√∂hrl, Stuck, Senna, Hamilton, McRae etc but they are professional drivers with countless hours of training.

And yes he over correct, but i don‚Äôt think many guys wouldn‚Äôt do the same. 
I didn't see it that way tbh. I even watched it on slow mo, he appears to rest his arm on the shifter (and this is auto bear in mind) also, revs are pretty consistent so it's more cruising. Also when he hits the water (i think) car slides to the left and he steers right. 

I think this is due the speed and water more than anything. 
Don't worry I've got thick skin and sure as hell I don't give a fuck about redditors opinion and karma. I'm just stating, 140 freedom speed is very very fast, and the guy probably wouldn't be saved by ESP. 

(also i can't check, but i didn't give that much downvotes in my life, so many snowflakes here). 
140mph is like fuck electronics you are dead. That‚Äôs close to 250 in non freedom speed. That would be scary af. Probably for r/watchpeopledie 
Might be. 
You mean more consistent? 
Don't know there is no description in the video, but I felt like it's worth sharing due to ESP magic. Also, she holds his hands is super sweet, fuck steering. 
I'm really staggered how slow supercars were around the track. I don't know if they weren't pushed enough (somebody's car) or they really suck. I imagine even in rain they would be faster... 
What's that purple thing that she wears around the neck?
