Yeah, I get that. I'm just concerned this particular DOJ and FCC wouldn't be, let say, up to the task of challenging this.
No, because I don't work for Sprint.
Lots of half-truths in this thread. OP, DM me the IMEI and I'll follow up here with everything I know about your phone.
Ting is an exception to this rule. Multi-network Ting phones from the shop are sold unlocked. GSM and CDMA phones will work on their respective parent carriers. Sprint phones need a litte help getting there.
If you ported in from Ting CDMA, it should't have been eligible. They might have used some back-office trickery to get it to work for you.

Which is fascinating to me. Someone did the math on this, and you can basically never earn the top prizes if points expire, because there's a cap to the number of points you can earn in a month.

I've moved past using SPay for rewards. I use it for the convenience, now. I leave the rewards to the cards added to it.

But seriously, it was TVs.
As we move to single-SKU phones, this is more likely to become a reality. An iPhone has the ability to change on the fly, without a reboot. Imagine an eSIM iPhone, where you get to choose and pay for the network that suits you best at that moment in time.
AT&T is the least-favorable to MVNOs in terms of wholesale pricing. It's why you don't see very many AT&T MVNOs, when compared to something like T-Mobile or Sprint.
> Ting is $6/month and always hot and ready to use.

Can confirm. And lowest data tier (in months you use it only) is $3/100MB.
Pool some lines together, and the savings becomes evident. I'm a mid-to-high data user. Pair my usage with my S/O, and it doesn't add almost anything to my Ting buckets. I could think of a few friends and family members whose added usage on my Ting account wouldn't affect the price I pay every month.
> merged carrier will be required

Fun fact: There's no mandate or law requiring MVNOs. They do it out of the goodness of their hearts. Or, more likely, their wallets.
> I doubt Ting is adding many customers

This isn't based in any fact, though. This is how you feel about our subscriber growth.

> I would imagine their wholesale rates will stay about the same, 

Same thing here. Is this based in any fact? Less competition typically means a rate increase.
Go figure an actual thread about Ting comes up on /r/Sprint while I'm away. Typical.

Anywho, in the short term, not much. The deal has only just been announced with intent. Nothing changes while two separate companies continue to exist. We're gonna keep activating phones on CDMA, offering our customers service and talk/text roaming on Big Red. None of that changes. 

Talks of a merger have been happening for years. [Here's](https://ting.com/blog/what-would-a-sprint-t-mobile-merger-mean-for-ting/) our VP of marketing /u/mickgoldstein on the same topic 4 years ago. Just because they announced intent doesn't mean it's actually gonna happen. [The regulatory battle shouldn't be discounted](https://www.wired.com/story/t-mobile-sprint-merger/) just because the head of state seems favorable to corporate mergers. 

I'm curious as to some of the responses in this thread, though. What makes you think our contracts wouldn't be renewed? We're stupidly profitable for our network providers because acquisition and support are basically zero for them. So much of their current price is retail fronts and customer care. If we end up supplying that, they can still turn a healthy profit on wholesale rates without having to fork over $600 per customer to pay off old agreements. 

We're still growing pretty steadily on both networks, and we don't see that changing. Sure, we may have to sunset some CDMA-only devices, but newer devices support bands 2/4/12 on LTE, anyway. With the launch of VoLTE (on most phones, a software update) the only thing most Ting customers will experience (aside from maybe a SIM card change) is better coverage. 

We have no plans to leave the market. We'll need to re-up our agreements, sure. And reduced competition means we'll face pushback on our wholesale rates, but that doesn't usually mean anything for our customers. 

It's not all doom and gloom, promise. And for those of you who have never been, feel free to come by /r/ting and discuss this exact same thing.
If the Big Four were colors, Ting CDMA runs on Yellow, Ting GSM runs on Pink.

[Yeah, it's weird wording. That's on purpose.](https://youtu.be/h2mlt5dmUrQ?t=72)
Swappa is perfect for that. You could probably recover $40-$60 for your S4.
Sometimes, the answers are simple, and sometimes (like now), they're needlessly complicated. 

And yeah, the S5 having VoLTE would absolutely be the reason she didn't experience the issues you do.

Frustrating to the end, but a complete answer nonetheless.

What are you looking for in a phone, and what's your price range? Lots of really nice phones can be had for not much money. I'll probably be selling my Ting GSM Moto E4 in the coming days, but I'll need to find out how much I can get for it.
I can double-check the lock status for you. DM me the IMEI. I can at least tell you if it's locked or not, and if it is, to whom.

Disclosure: I work for /r/ting, and that's how I found this thread.
I'm really sorry we didn't have this answer for you the first time around. I hope you won't hold it against us if you ever decide to come back.
> maybe it will in the future

It's not unheard of. We just expanded to Fuquay-Varina, NC in part because it was adjacent to our existing Internet town of Holly Springs.
This is a recent development. T-Mobile is pushing all 2G calls to a smaller and smaller chunk of the 1900MHz spectrum it lives on. As they re-farm the network to prepare for more and more LTE devices on what limited spectrum they have, fewer devices can connect at once, and some won't connect at all. 

What this means is that if your phones do not support VoLTE on the T-Mobile network (and, if I'm not mistaken, the S4 does not), that means all your calls are currently being routed over the 2G network. The network will only give you so many rings to the handset before kicking to Voicemail. If you're in a low-bandwidth area and the network can't find you in time, it's likely the calls are being kicked to voicemail before the handset has a chance to ring.

This isn't a one-and-done thing. For some reason, her phone is given priority on the limited slice of network that's actually left, and her calls are routed just fine. She may have experienced it when you are both home, but typically it looks like her phone beats out yours for network connectivity. 

This problem is likely to get worse before it gets better. The solution is a B12 VoLTE phone. I know "get a newer phone" is a common cell phone sales thing, but in your case it might actually be the solution. 

This might not be what's happening, but it seems to be what's happening in my case. I just had a lengthy discussion with a Product Manager here at Ting about it. If you face the same issue with your S4s on Mint, you'll be a step ahead of the game and you'll know exactly how to fix it.

You laugh, but that's the second time this week someone suggested I mod a sub that is a direct competitor to the company I work for.
Well, I might have something resembling an answer, but if it's true it means your S4s might have the same problem on Mint. Let me dive a little deeper. If you want what I've got now, just let me know.
Oh snap. I have a question. Do you use Google Voice? And does your wife?
> Interesting that I get a response from /r/ting in a competitors sub 

I'm everywhere. Don't fault the Mint guys. They're busy trying to get things switched over. 

I'm wondering what causes your issue, because one of my lines has the same thing. Calls just straight-up don't arrive, for some unknown reason. They use GVoice, so I don't know if they fail to get to VM at all. Super frustrating, and we're trying to determine if it's the phone or the network. What's odd is I use the same network (Ting GSM) and have had no such issues. 

Sorry to hijack the thread, and I know you're done with us, but I'd like a chance to dig in, just for my own sanity, if you have a moment. Just DM me the last help request number? I'll only follow up if there's a breakthrough on it. It's maddening and I want a response and answer just as badly as you do.
That's the hope. But in practice, we will be losing our first and one of only two network partners.
[Pre-order here.](https://ting.com/internet/town/fuquayvarina)
What kind of missing calls? Just calls that don't show up on your phone and go to voicemail? Or calls that don't even get that far?
You and me both. But, in the short-term, it's unlikely anything will change until after regulatory approval, which is expected to be a year or so from now. _IF_ it makes it out of that stage, we'll have options for Sprint network customers, like we always do.
Per OP's original comment

>  Pressure to buy stuff I don't want or need,


Even when you say 'no', some reps don't take that as an answer. See: insurance, tablets, the hum.

Same thing with Nextel and Sprint.

> Day off

A beautiful thing, sometimes. Alas, I'm back.
Most assuredly. With less competition, they make the rules in the 3rd Place cell phone market.
I upvoted you, because I respect the /s
Yes, absolutely. Especially if the new entity is forced to sell of a chunk of the 2.5GHz band reserved for non-profits like Calyx.
In Obama's FTC/FCC/DOJ, sure. This climate seems favorable for a merger.
Why do I feel like that's not gonna happen anymore?
I'd have suggested using common parlance for stocks, then, with a dollar sign in front of the ticker symbols.
And the DOJ was a completely different DOJ back then.
There is likely to be thousands of redundancies.
Only Sprint tech support can fix that.
The difference is that the coverage area provided by any UK network is just about as large as a regional carrier in the states. 

For context, the entire UK is about the size of Michigan or Wyoming.
Nah. The CDMA shutdown is likely to be slow and painful as they move towards transitioning all CDMA-only customers to a new network. 
In the immediate future? Nothing. All they've done is announced intent. It'll need to go through a huge regulatory process.

Once that's all done (a year or more, probably), we'll need to re-up our agreement. Network changes likely won't happen for a while after that, because like everything in this industry, it moves slowly.

On a personal note, I'm a little disappointed that Sprint wasn't able to turn it around. I really don't like the idea of only having three national carriers to choose from. MVNOs and customers alike are more vulnerable to price-fixing with fewer competitors. Look at how bananas Canada went for a $60/month deal.
This is going to be a tough regulatory battle. If you're angry, call your congressional representatives. 
Yes. Up to 72 hours is not uncommon for wireless-to-wireless ports. Landline-to-wireless can take days.

Sometimes, it's worse than that. They buy patents from failing startups, or from large holdings companies. There was a story arc on Silicon Valley that dealt with this.

Edit: I don't remember exactly, but the comment said something to the effect of you can't be fined you if you're not European.
It just transfers said legal burden. Said hobbyists would have to comply with the GDPR or be fined.
It could be something really silly like the battery terminal being severed. This was really common on the S6 when I worked for Sprint, and it was a result of not enough adhesive on the battery. Replacing the battery and its adhesive usually fixed the issue.

Have a repair shop look at it before you go all lawsuit-y.
It's GDPR. They're not shutting down due to insolvency. They're shutting down because they can't comply with the new law, and don't want to face a 4% gross penalty for one infraction. Open-sourcing it won't make it compliant with GDPR.
>  This is starting to sound very /r/hailcorporate

Can confirm you don't work for /r/ting. Source: I work for /r/ting.
This isn't exactly how it happened. We (Ting) ported the numbers from RingPlus over to our platform while RingPlus was technically still in business but folding fast. Then, we allowed customers to port away if they wanted to go elsewhere, rather than stick with us. We weren't under any delusion that most would stay -- free is hard to beat.
As much as I would love to, I think that would be a conflict of interest. I am a mod of and work for /r/ting, a StraightTalk competitor.

My experience in the industry aside, I haven't been a StraightTalk customer for years.
I would cross-post this to /r/walmart and ask for a few mobile employees to take the reins. The sub is just employees (very few actual customers) and at least a few of them have their heads on straight.
Right, but how does it "wake up" to hear the trigger phrase? It may not always be recording or processing input, but it's always listening.
This is something your sales lead gets paid to do. In addition to any help you get here, you should follow up with your sales lead to do some role playing.
Neat! Yeah, your story sounds like a resounding success, and that's exactly what we're looking for. Not everyone will have the same experience that you did, and boy do they let us know. 

That's really difficult to beat for $65/month. At that pace, you're beating our $23 average. Do you have to use caps and alerts to stay there, or do you guys do it manually?
I use 1Password for work, and LastPass for personal.

After using KeePass for many years, I made the jump to LastPass, the free version. The breaking point for me was when I needed to change my password, I needed to edit the keepass file, then manually sync it across all devices. That doesn't sound like a lot, but when you're running with two desktops, a Chromebook, an iPhone and two Android phones, syncing one file can be a royal pain. Especially since not all clients are created equal. 

The solution there is cloud syncing. If I'm going to store the file on the cloud anyway, via Dropbox or GDrive (not immune to unauthorized access), I didn't need another step between me and my passwords every time one of them needed changing.

With KeePass, decryption was done on the client side, but that's exactly how LastPass works. And even when something like LastPass is hacked, all the [attackers typically get is a salted hash.](https://blog.lastpass.com/2015/06/lastpass-security-notice.html/)  Not useful for opening vaults, and that's by design. 

And LastPass actively warns you against password reuse, via feature called [Security Challenge](https://lastpass.com/support.php?cmd=showfaq&id=1446). It saved me more than a few times when my email addresses showed up on [Have I Been Pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com) or [when a service I know and love gets hacked.](https://lastpass.com/support.php?cmd=showfaq&id=5375) 

I also recently learned that the developers of the iOS app have built in access to Keychain now, which means I don't need to jump back and forth between LastPass and an app when I want to log in. That's beyond useful, and something KeePass never did. 

I have no complaints about 1Password, except that it's not free. If work didn't provide it for me, I probably wouldn't use it otherwise. It doesn't have all the same instantly-accessible features that LastPass does, but it does check for duplicates and has a nifty browser add-on.
This is only on CDMA. Our GSM network either adopts the CID name that already exists on the partner network, or can be reset to `WIRELESS CALLER`. 

For a while, my CID on CDMA was `Superman`. I never got called on it, though, because I never made many phone calls to landlines with CallerID.
Next time, feel free to send them this: [Why is Ting so cheap?](https://ting.com/blog/why-is-ting-so-cheap/)
Latching on to your comment to the Ting CDMA network is probably best suited on either of these devices, if OP has had good coverage with Virgin Mobile. VMU also uses the Sprint network.

Over data, the usage is remarkably low it barely counts. I did this a few months ago, and I never pay for an outgoing call on my Ting phone.

2. Get an [app like GlassWire](https://ting.com/blog/glasswire-app/) (Android) that will not only tell you what's using data over a month, but shows it to you in real time, and with custom selections (over a day, for example). 

3. Set [caps and alerts](https://ting.com/blog/setting-alerts-and-caps-on-ting/) on your account to prevent yourself from mindlessly going over your budget.

4. Become active on /r/ting. You can add your referral link to your flair. We regularly have tips, tricks and credit giveaways.

> how expensive the data is with Fi.

They're attempting to not subsidize high-usage users. There's a margin built in (I'm hesitant to call it profit) for sure, but the wholesalers charge wildly different prices for everything. It's not like for the total number of Fi subscribers they have that they can demand pricing from the network providers. They take what they can get, while attempting to profit.

Unless you're doing WalMart Straight Talk levels of volume, the price you can demand affects the price you need to charge your users.
I speak from experience (working for Sprint for 4 years). They're forgiving to a point, but when I was in OPs position, there's no way they would have approved me without the $8/month ASL.

And I hear you on the unlimited front. I'm on the social media team, and you would not believe the vitriol we get on Facebook and Twitter for not offering an unlimited plan. According to a sizeable cross-section of the internet, we're not even worth investigating because of it. 

It's not like our network providers say 'Oh, this user used more than 10gb of data, so you only have to pay for X gb this month.' We pay for every megabyte, even the free one we give to everyone on our networks each month. It doesn't make business sense (if you want to be sustainable) to charge a high price for unlimited and hope that a majority of your users don't bother using it.

Pure joy, indeed! PM me the email address on your Ting account and I'll add your credit.
There are reasons we start in smaller towns, though. Usually those towns are more receptive to a new ISP, either by granting digging permits or utility pole usage. Bigger cities are more likely to have utility pole issues or getting permission from the city under the [Cable Communications Act of 1984.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_Communications_Policy_Act_of_1984)

The act gave municipalities, governing bodies of cities and towns, principal authority to grant and renew franchise licenses for cable operations.

[Consumerist has a really nice writeup of how difficult it is to start from scratch building a provider.](https://consumerist.com/2014/05/10/why-starting-a-competitor-to-comcast-is-basically-impossible/)

As much as we would like to dive in and ask questions later, we really need to feel that the city, its permitting offices and its residents are all on board with us digging up and building the utility before we make the decision to move into a town. And we do need business and residential customers to actually buy the product once we have it in place.

This kind of stuff is why Google Fiber threw their hands in the air and halted all expansion of their service.

We're going to keep doing what we're doing. We can't move fast enough for some, but it's not easy taking on the incumbents.

Disclosure: I work for /r/ting. AMA.
The only reason I might avoid FP is the ongoing billing, especially for someone from a different company. 

Ting might be the better fit between the two, if nothing else than for the cancellation policy. The whole thing takes less than 5 minutes. I still haven't cancelled my FP global SIM line, and I'm dreading the phone call to do so.

> Maybe Ting is releasing a new sim card that works on both GSM and CDMA? 

Sadly not. The X1Z1 is, as /u/balphius pointed out, just a two-pack of SIMs, one each.
Yes on the budget smartwatch. Anything that supports GSM on 1900MHz is good for that kind of stuff, at least until T-Mobile shuts down their 2G support. The M2M agreements should keep it live through 2020, but past that is anyone's guess.

I want LTE budget IOT devices, but that probably won't happen as long as 2G is still available. I imagine the manufacturers don't want to pay for LTE licensing. 

Yeah, I ditched my FP global SIM months before it was axed, because it was repeatedly either it was not meeting my IOT needs, or wouldn't connect due to suspension. I'm glad it's gone.

DIGITS isn't bad if you already have t-mobile, but the Ting SIM is a favorite of IOT hobbyists on sites like Adafruit because we still actively support it. We're also working on IOT-specific stuff, probably to launch full sometime this year.

Bonus: use my team's code https://social25.ting.com for $25 in credit, which should cover a few months. Click the link, buy the SIM, get the credit applied after you activate.
Has anyone ever seen TJ Miller and Drake in the same room at the same time?
I would say your best bet is going to be a second-hand Galaxy S7. It's sub $220 on Swappa, and with a new battery, it should last you a very long time. It has the performance of a $600 phone even these few years later, and you'll get better software support than from Motorola or Honor.
This is a super-serious allegation. Do you have any actual proof, or are you just speculating?

For anyone else interested in traffic pumping, I recommend you listen to [this episode of ReplyAll](https://www.gimletmedia.com/reply-all/104-case-phantom-caller). It explains the concept in detail, and details how a company can profit from pumping.
Preowned from Sprint, or preowned in general?

Preowned from Sprint pull from the same service stock as Asurion refurbished replacements. The SKUs are the same and everything. They're usually pretty good, and typically have a new back and screen, but older battery. 

Usually, there's nothing wrong with them. Know your return and warranty policy, and don't be surprised if it's not on par with a brand-new device. It's not supposed to be.

Preowned in general (from eBay or Swappa) tend to be just secondhand from real users. These will be more beat-up than Sprint Certified Pre-owned devices, but you know they work. 

In either case, know that a replacement battery can be had for relatively cheap, and it will make a world of difference.
Android or something on an RPi connected to a NAS would work great.
You'd need window and door sensors, like [these](https://www.amazon.com/Ecolink-Intelligent-Technology-Operated-DWZWAVE2-ECO/dp/B00HPIYJWU), a hub to interpret (I recommend [hass.io](https://hass.io) or SmartThings) and an IFTTT recipe to interact with your thermostat.

It's $6 per line and $3 for 100 text messages, sent over the regular SMS pathway, rather than via the app.
It really depends on the company. Instances like RingPlus, where Ting stepped in to save the numbers from deletion, are rare. 

Most times, customers are alerted via email and have so-many days to port out or lose their numbers forever. [When PrepaYd Wireless went OOB](https://www.prepaidphonenews.com/2014/02/sprint-has-terminated-prepayd-wireless.html), they said all customers had to contact a dealer to get their account number and PIN before they could port out. This meant most people lost their numbers.

It really depends on who is running the show and how upfront and honest they are with their customers about closing up shop.

> I'll have to check if both my phones will work with Ting

[The BYOD checker](https://ting.com/byod) will give you a run-down of what works, provided the phone is unlocked. If you want a more in-depth breakdown, PM me the IMEI with a link back to this comment.
I don't know if we're unique in this, but financing through Ting includes us paying all of Affirm's interest charges.
That almost beats the average. Any referrals yet?
If you get something working with your AC66U, please let me know. I couldn't get any 3G/4G sticks to work correctly, even choosing from [Asus' own list.](https://www.asus.com/event/networks_3G4G_support/)
This ends up being what we see on our end. Adding an additional line for $6 with minimal bumps in buckets opens up a world of IOT devices, parents with cell phones only because they have to, testing SIMs and typically low-usage users.

My S/O is a perfect example. Previously, her line was $30 with T-Mobile. No data, 1500 talk/text combination. I put her on my Ting account, and I might as well not consider being charged because of the difference. I account for the lion's share of my Ting usage, and her usage doesn't ever bump me into a bucket I wouldn't have been in on my own. 

Disclosure: I work for /r/ting but have been a customer on and off for years.
I'm right there with you. I'm on VMU's $1/1-year plan until August, at which time I'm bringing this line back to Ting. Disclosure: I work for /r/ting.
This seems like a good a place as any to plug Ting's [$20 smartphone  bill hack](https://ting.com/blog/hack-phone-plan-smartphone-plan-under-20/), inspired heavily by [1500 Days to Freedom.](https://www.1500days.com/17-89-phone-bill-ting/)

Focusing on your actual usage and sticking around WiFi makes such a difference. As does having an unlocked cell phone that can jump from carrier to carrier as needed. My unlocked iPhone SE (yes, it was an initial high cost) is currently on Virgin Mobile's $1/1-year plan at roughly $0.08/month for unlimited. Their current offerings are less sweet, but it's ALWAYS worth bouncing around, especially if you're on the Big Four.

Despite their best intention, and as much as I love it, Sprint's Free Year is probably not the way to go for /r/povertyfinance. It requires a hard credit check, which some may not be able to afford.
Worth noting that for most phones on FreedomPop, you need to use their app to make calls and send text messages. 
What's a typical Ting bill for you run every month?
Fun fact: The carrier I work for charges MMS and RCS as data only on smartphones. iMessages are also exclusively data.
This isn't uncommon from some stores. When I worked at Sprint, we were under direction to only sell SIMs to Sprint customers with a Sprint account. 

It's not really a problem, though. Check what SIM card you need [here](https://help.ting.com/hc/en-us/articles/205428218-Finding-Your-SIM-Card) and we can get one sent out to you.
I have web services on my home server, too. I just use a domain. It's like $10/year and I don't have to do anything special.
Oh, hey! It’s that cell phone company I work for.
Just remember that you're final bill will still be due after you port out all your lines.
It only really slows traffic to and from that client. It's been many years since I took a networking class, but I sincerely doubt a local DNS needs to match its clients.
It’s a lot of work. Start small, because the more lists you add, the harder casual browsing becomes. 

Depending on how many adults are in your house, you may need to provide the override password to them, or have them contact you to whitelist everything they ask for. This becomes problematic if your S/O doesn’t want to give you every blog they’re trying to read. Some lists are... let’s just say extensive in their reach for no apparent reason. Feed.ly, for some reason, is blocked on several of the most-popular pihole block lists. I have no idea why.

Providing the password and letting the adults make their own content decisions has its drawbacks, though. Anyone with the bypass password pokes a hole in your carefully constructed barrier. 

A gigabit network card is unnecessary. It’s strictly a DNS server and forwarder. No traffic actually passes through it.
Brand new? Craigslist is probably your cheapest option, but YMMV and the device may be stolen.
EU privacy standards are already coming to the US, just not everywhere. The company I work for (based in Canada) is just [going to implement GDPR across an entire brand.](https://opensrs.com/the-gdpr/) That way, even if you're not an EU citizen, you're getting the benefits anyway. 

There's a larger discussion here about local governments effectively creating international policy, but this thread is about Facebook.
If you're really enterprising, [pihole](https://pi-hole.net/) is an excellent option. It blocks the tracking at a DNS level. [Here's the repo for Facebook.](https://github.com/imkarthikk/pihole-facebook)
Go universal. It'll save you from hassle if you ever decide to switch to another carrier, or if you flip from CDMA to GSM on Ting.
[Facebook has a profile on you even if you don't use Facebook. It's called a shadow profile.](https://www.macobserver.com/analysis/facebook-profile-no-account/)
Can confirm the IMEI you gave me is in the Sprint DMD with the SKU `	SAM N950U GRY BY XCVR SGL`. 

If it's already active on your Ting account with the right SIM, you do just need a way to update your Sprint profile. If your phone didn't download it when you put your Sprint SIM in, you'll need either a Sprint-based ROM or a Universal ROM. 

Your issue is exclusively software.
A few things about how Sprint activates things on the Note 8.

You'll need a way to update the Sprint profile on your device. As you can't do this manually (because Sprint), you'll need either the SprintDM application specific to your device (found only in stock-based ROMS) or the "System Update" tab in settings to run the profile update. 

If your phone has neither of these, the `##72786#` reset code will not work, period. The Ting rep(s) you spoke to were not blowing smoke. They knew what they were talking about.

You can flash a Sprint or Universal ROM to your Note 8 to get these features. BUT you'll likely run into the other rub if my years of working at Sprint says anything: The DMD. 

Sprint's DMD, or Device Management Database, has a list of every serial number it will allow onto its network. This includes all 'unlocked' variants from OEMs (Samsung, Motorola) as well as the option to add some non-native devices (Apple). If your IMEI isn't in the DMD, Sprint will straight-up refuse to activate it. As Ting relies on Sprint for our CDMA network, we're at the mercy of their DMD. If Sprint says no, we have to say no. 

If you DM me the IMEI, I can verify one way or the other if your phone is in the DMD. If it is, all you need is to flash a Sprint-based or Universal-based ROM to get it active on CDMA/Sprint. If our BYOD checker already said it's good for CDMA, it's probably already in the DMD and you just need to flash software.

Source: I work for /r/Ting. Prior to that, I worked for /r/Sprint for 4 years.
Sometimes. It depends on what activation policy is applied by Consumer Cellular.
The stores closed last fall were hardly the only stores to close in recent memory. When I worked for BBY (2011-ish), they closed several stores and my store had to absorb more than a few employees. Then, my old store closed last fall and all those employees either went to other BBY stores, or went to other companies.

If you're still closing stores more than a few years after you close some others, something you're doing isn't working. I'm not saying commissioned sales is the key, but if you need to drive sales to keep your stores open, it would help if employees are incentivised to sell as much as possible every single time. 

The employees are already in this mindset (SELL, SELL, SELL). I think the problem is that the ones that are really good at it will either languish in that position for a few years, or move on to companies that will pay them for their sales ability. This is most-evident in Mobile, where I worked, evidenced by the fact that I left a store I loved with excellent performance to move to a carrier store further away and excelled there. Good employees follow the money. My experience isn't uncommon.
What about opt-in commission? A lower hourly, but the option to commission every sale attached to your numbers.
I went from BBY to commissioned sales, and my customers always came first. The two are not mutually exclusive. When you take care of your customers with small stuff, they'll always come back to you to buy more.
If they're worried about sales, they need something to kick it into high gear. Commission would absolutely do that. It does that for carrier stores that sell niche products, and way fewer SKUs than BBY.
I don't typically shop at Best Buy unless I need something specific. But something's gotta give, oro they'll just keep closing stores.
To build slightly on this, we talked about rollover back when we started. Users didn't really like it, because they'd have this ever-increasing bucket of rollover minutes they could never possibly use after just a few months.
Commission on sales. It would weed out the weak employees and the top performers wouldn't bat an eye at working 40 hours a week.
Then, is there a way to have AutoMod only trigger it's one, best comment and self-remove or not post additional comments?
> I don't automatically think of it as a Ghetto carrier

I don't think I've ever viewed Boost this way. It caters to urban markets, but it's service that's identical to Virgin Mobile, under a different name.
Regularly, I think AutoMod ends up with several irrelevant responses to a thread that get downvoted immediately because someone used a trigger word unrelated to their main problem or inquiry. I'll pop into a thread that'll already have 3 or 4 comments, all AutoMod, and all downvoted.
I work for /r/ting. I can confirm we wouldn't deny or lock a valid port, as long as the account number and PIN match. We don't verify against anything else, but we'll provide it if the new carrier requires it.
If AutoMod gets the answer wrong in the first place anyway, why does it matter if AutoMod provides an answer before any human can?
That's physical damage to the display. The only fix is replacing the display. It'll get worse with time, till your screen is completely black.
AutoMod: byod
I think that means AutoMod isn't operating in a way that is beneficial to the sub. At least not with auto responses.

I prefer being able to summon AutoMod inside of a thread once a human has looked at the issue and knows AutoMod not only has the right answer, but will save them a lot of typing.

AutoMod: contract
Given the widespread effect of the 5x bootloop, it's unlikely. Unlikely, but because it's not 100%, the technicians are erring on the side of caution. There's a non-zero chance it was caused by corrosion due to water damage.
I did repair for a living for just over a year, and this is pretty clear evidence of water damage. It's not just the sticker they're looking at. There's corrosion buildup on the SIM tray. 

See the white stuff on the silver SIM tray, above where it says `nano SIM`? That's corrosion from prolonged water exposure. This isn't a spill or some sweat that dried up immediately. 

I'm not saying you dropped your phone in any water. I'm just saying your phone had prolonged water exposure, at least near the SIM tray. It manifests differently on different phones, but is usually that white buildup, better seen [here.](http://iphonefixed.co.uk/images/corrosion.jpg)

I'd infer they're telling the truth, red sticker aside.
Yeah, and AutoMod rarely has the 100% correct answer. 

[The key words in question.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sprint/wiki/automoderator)
On GSM, yes. You can just switch your SIM card. You'll need to [set your APN](https://help.ting.com/hc/en-us/articles/205428698-GSM-Android-APN-setup-guide) on the Mate SE. Your 2FA will transfer over, as long as you use SMS. 
That's really appreciated, thank you! We pride ourselves on empowering the customer service team, because the alternative is being like every other phone company.

While it's true that depending on usage, we may not be the cheapest in all cases, we're definitely cheaper in some cases, and as a veteran of Reddit, I hope you appreciate that no other cell phone carrier has what we have on /r/ting.
You're not wrong. [The S9 SIM isn't backwards-compatible.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sprint/comments/84hs74/s9_delivered_with_verizon_wrong_sim_card_told/dvpnvf8/) This is AFTER they launched the BYOD Kit v2, which wasn't backwards-compatible with BYOD Kit v1.

Sprint gonna Sprint.
This is likely. And it doesn't qualify for the $75 repair because it sounds like it's physical or intentional damage.
-ish. RW sources their phone numbers through a service called bandwidth.com, a VoIP provider. Because the phone numbers aren't coming from Sprint, they technically work for this deal.
You are lucky to have well water. How do you counteract the metallic smell?

I don't have the luxury of a well. I have to pay per unit from the city, same as electric. If I use more, I pay more. It's a model that makes sense to me.

The per-unit pricing thing is more [psychological](https://ting.com/blog/ask-an-exec-episode-2-with-elliot-noss-why-it-sucks-to-pay-per-bite-byte/) than economics. If you thought it would cost you $.25 to catch that Pokemon, you'd always be stressed out while using Ting. The buckets take care of a lot of that.

Unit rates do drop in bulk, that's true. That's also how MintSIM works, but on a longer time scale. 

We charge what we can while still turning a profit and providing for the customer service we're known for. I've seen you around Reddit for some time. You're no newbie to the industry, so you may not need attentive CS. There's a sizeable chunk of our customer base who isn't like you, though, and require more help than a KB article about APN settings. 

Our business model is about charging pricing that makes sense to the majority of people (read: easy to understand) while turning a profit and delivering on our customer service promise. 
Without knowing Tello, Redpocket, Xfinity or Tracfone's wholesale pricing, I can't speak to if they can afford to give away service for their "base" price.

How is meted usage predatory? Isn't it exactly how your water and electricity work? I realize that's some what-aboutism, but I'm just painting with a broader brush in the wireless industry. Most of the industry has moved towards subsidizing high-usage users with low-usage users, and we're bucking that trend.
You're not wrong. The Tweakker message sent to my GSM device was from *6751*.
It depends on what you consider "a lot of data", but you're absolutely right. 

Source and disclosure: I work for /r/ting.
It should be noted this is only in the months you actively use it. It's $6/month otherwise.
>  they charge a ridiculous line fee

The other carriers charge it, too. They just hide it elsewhere. Having a phone number active on the network isn't free.
If everyone is using iPhones, you can really cut down on the voice and SMS usage with Hangouts, FaceTime Audio and iMessage. That makes Ting (disclosure: my employer) the more-attractive option. 

There's no sense in paying for voice minutes and texts you won't use if your phone will default to iMessage and FaceTime anyway. 

My apologies that I wasn't here yesterday to answer your question. I was just finishing up a sweet vacation. But I'm back, and if you think Ting's going to be a good fit, I'm here to answer your concerns!
The S7 with a new battery is your best option.
Sadly, that’s happening faster than I’d like, and LTE flip phones aren’t rushing in to fill the void like they should. 

But, m2m will keep the 2G network love through at least 2020.
I completely missed that fact. Oops. 

It might be beneficial to flip to smartphones if using that trick would save you money.
Offload your outbound calls to Hangouts to cut your minutes: https://ting.com/blog/google-hangouts-free-outbound-wi-fi-calling/

I dumped a lot of it when it tanked down from 8. I still own a bunch, though, and got more through RobinHood. It's one of the free stocks they gave me for referring people.
Using the service legit for a few weeks will not result in your line being shut off. 
When you own as many shares of $S as I do, any gain is appreciated. 
I would not recommend this. Our security team is on-point with shutting this kind of thing down and expiring the numbers forever.

That's the kind of success story I love! If you don't mind sharing, what does a typical bill look like for you?
Thanks! Phil was how I discovered Ting, too. Fast-forward 5 years, and here I am working for a company that treats its employees well, trains them and promotes from within.

If your bill sticks to 1/3 of the cost of AT&T, we've done our job. That even allows your usage to grow some months, and it's still less.

I'm really excited to hear that you're on board for the long haul! We'll be just as glad to have your family on, as well! Referrals is where we thrive, because all the marketing in the world pales in comparison to a recommendation from a friend. We also don't cap referrals. Just ask /u/tim_y.
Much appreciated! We operate under the ethos of honest to a fault. 

Rest assured, we earn a profit on each Ting bill, mostly because we don’t have to subsidize unlimited users with the low-data users who would overbuy every month. 

We point this kind of data-saving stuff out, because there aren’t a lot of other carriers who do. We don’t benefit from you having a huge phone bill, getting frustrated and leaving. We’d rather you stick around, like us as a company and refer some friends. If that means we show you, in detail, how to make free outgoing calls over WiFi so you don’t have to pay us, that’s what we’re gonna do!

It creates a VPN number.
That makes sense. I want to use my FP SIM more, but carrying around another device is a pain. I wish the S7E supported dual SIM.
Yes. [Some Kroger](https://www.reddit.com/r/ting/comments/6uet78/the_local_kroger_got_some_ting_sims_in_yay/) and [Staples stores](https://www.reddit.com/r/ting/comments/4s1kgg/how_to_find_a_ting_gsm_x1_sim_at_your_local/) carry them, but you should always call ahead and verify stock before making the trip out just for a SIM card. 

They're also available at [some Best Buy stores](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ting-30-sim-card-kit/6134436.p?skuId=6134436), but not all. Use the store locator to find them near you.

Edit: Keep in mind that these are all GSM X1 SIM cards. Your best bet for CDMA SIM cards is still [our shop](https://ting.com/shop) or YMMV at a Sprint store, once you know the [SKU of the SIM card](https://help.ting.com/hc/en-us/articles/205428218-Finding-Your-SIM-Card) you need. 
I've been to this place. They make sure to let you know it's pronounced MUH-LADDY.

But I still chuckle every time I see it.
Yes. Typically, the PUK code is printed on the card. Some carriers keep a record of the PUK codes on all their SIMs, some don't.

You'll need the PUK code if your SIM ever locks.
I imagine the ringtones are stored in a specific directory. Without knowing what it is or how the Sprint shop for ringtones works, you might be able to either BT over an mp3, [or just develop your own app that creates ringtones on Brew MP.](https://developer.brewmp.com/)
As do all MVNOs. My point was that people really like Fi not for the price, but because it's Google. If it were the price, similarly-priced MVNOs (like the company I work for, /r/ting) would get the same praise. Instead we get critical feedback about data pricing, despite it being nearly identical to Fi ($10/GB above 1GB).
Can confirm, Ting works great for those interested in /r/povertyfinance. When I saw the sub launched, I was going to post something about it, but I thought it would be viewed as astroturfing since I work for Ting.

For rural coverage, and if OP's going to try to keep data usage to a minimum to save money, CDMA works best. It roams on a big red network that rhymes with Horizon Wireless.
> Why do people like project fi?

A lot of it has to do with the parent company behind Fi.
Out of curiosity, what have you tried?

Lots of these flip phones run [BrewOS \(Brew MP\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_Runtime_Environment_for_Wireless) with a heavy carrier overlay, locking down lots of features that would otherwise be available. 

If this is the case, this might be one of those instances where the software on the phone means some things just can't be done outside of the original carrier.
Galaxy S5, but some of it depends on the network.
> i'd fire that person on the spot

I disagree that a simple transgression isn't grounds for firing, especially since it's assumed most of the persons in the Twitter thread are not T-Mobile Austria customers. 

I do this sort of thing for a living, too. If myself or someone on my team went this far, we would get a talking to and lay low for a bit. We still have good social media skills, and she could have just been having a bad day. 

Bad taste? Absolutely. Fireable offence? Hardly.
Can confirm: heard this all the time at Sprint and Best Buy. The confidence with which people tell half-truths is mind-boggling.
I wish there was some way to get traffic data without an always-on map connection. That's a big data kicker with me, too.
Yeah, but it's not the Fi experience you're used to. It'll be limited to the GSM network side of things. No Sprint, no US Cellular. No network switching. Even though the Essential works on all 3 networks.

I don't know if there's any difference between using it this way and [Fi's own data-only SIM settings.](https://support.google.com/fi/answer/6330195?hl=en)
Ah, yeah, that makes sense. eSIM adoption is a slow game. It's something we're working on now, but lots of things have to go right and we need approval on some fronts before it's ready for prime-time.

I find it hilarious that your account was credited. I mean, that's what my resolution would have been had I intercepted your email, but it's really fascinating that credit was the answer for you.
You can use the Fi SIM in any GSM device. It won't take advantage of the network switching (stays on GSM/T-Mobile), but it does work. International roaming, too.

It’s a zero-sum game for Sprint. All the other guys have huge buyouts, too, and the only growth is going to come from taking subscribers from one of the other carriers. 

There’s no new organic growth in the industry, as everyone who wants a cell phone has one. So it becomes a matter of spending money to steal your competitors’ customers, rather than keep your own. 

Retaining customers in this fashion gives you almost nothing. Any concessions to existing customers who may leave anyway is money you could have spent sniping customers from the competition to replace them. 

It’s messed up, but it’s where we’re at as an industry. I’m not saying some sweet retention offers don’t exist. /u/SprintRetention is living proof of that. I’m saying there’s way less value in pouring money into an existing customer who knows how much of a hassle it is to switch (in excess of $1000 switching fees they promise to pay back, for example) than in making fun of what your competitors are doing and convincing their customer you’re the better operation.
Welp. We've gotten to the point where we've had to lock a thread on /r/Ting. Never thought I'd see the day. 

Wrap it up, folks. We're done here.
3% is a lot when the bill is $10,000.
If you're a stickler for a paper trail, checks can be more reliable if you're budgeting.
For the merchant, there's not a 3% credit card processing fee.
I had some plumbing and electrical work done on my house a few months ago. Neither contractor took credit or debit. They wanted cash or checks. 

I think it's a bookkeeping thing. But then, I see they take cash and that throws that out the window.

Do you mean the full SIM card number, or the phone number actually associated with the SIM card? 

If the latter, there's not a way to do that, as far as I know. Since Sprint disabled Google Voice integration, there isn't a good way around it on any carrier, Ting not being the outlier there.

Shameless plug for my employer, /r/Ting. Park your number for $6/month plus tax, and only pay for usage in the months you absolutely need it. Smallest buckets of minutes, messages and megabytes are $3 each.
You're right -- that's probably what happened. There is a way to fix it, and I wrote about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sprint/comments/2mpr7s/_/) back when I worked for Sprint. 

In all honesty, getting it added is still a royal pain some 5 years later, and it was straight-up easier just to activate on GSM.
You can have separate accounts, and share lists via a link sent to the owner of a list.

I don't know if over a million installs counts as obscure, but [OurGroceries](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries&hl=en).

For the longest time, the S/O and I struggled with the best way to use Google Keep for grocery lists. It never worked correctly, or it wouldn't sync fast enough. 

OurGroceries lets you take photos of the item and attach it to said item. If you're like me, and you can't tell any one of the 90 different kinds of tomato paste apart, this is a LIFESAVER. It also lets you enter in UPCs, for that extra "make sure this is what you get" kick. 

In addition to being cross-platform synced, it will remember the order in which you placed items on the list, and let you re-order them. That way, you can have milk at the bottom, and bread on the top, if that's how you go through the grocery store. 

You can make several lists for different stores (Aldi-specific items aren't available at Jewel, for example), make recipes with specific stuff and add multiples just by adding the item again.

Cannot say enough good things about it for people trying to run a household with multiple adults who do the grocery shopping.
The Metro thread was probably pulled because people were using a certain very-trusting carrier to generate phone numbers and port out immediately to Metro to get a free iPhone, then get it unlocked and leave.

I don't, but I should.
I couldn't agree more. I absolutely hated SPS, as my C-store would hit it all the time based on our *heavy* coaching. As soon as I moved to an A-store, the store manager was against any coaching at all. SPS tanked and we stopped caring. We cared so little that the store manager wouldn't even bring it up unless specifically directed to by district management. 

So we made up for it in volume. EVERYONE who walked in the door was either tendered or got a QuickFix. The sheer volume of SPS we ended up getting drowned out the complainers to where we never hit SPS, but we were never at the district-manager-giving-a-hoot bottom, either. 

This had the added benefit of bumping us to an A100 store. I left shortly thereafter, mostly because of that Asurion thing.

I think this is an issue at most commission retail shops. I've not found this to be the case at Best Buy, who does not pay commission.
I want to clarify on Andre's point. On CDMA you absolutely can change your caller ID through the dashboard. 

This is not an option on GSM. While we can change your caller ID name on GSM, we can't customize it. We can only reset it if it's coming up with something that isn't your name. It will default to `WIRELESS CALLER`.  

This is a GSM network limitation. If you'd like a customized Caller ID display, you'll have to switch to the CDMA network.

It definitely makes budgeting harder if your margins are razor thin, which I think is why RW ditched the idea. But the amount of marketing it requires to explain the concept of your cell phone carrier giving you money back because it doesn't matter what plan you choose adds a layer of process for not a lot of benefit. 

Whether more buckets or larger buckets is the answer, only time will tell.

You poor soul. I hope it's for work.

In my experience, unless your line is specifically a business line, they won't increase your roaming bucket. 

Data roaming is expensive. [This study from just a few years ago](https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/study-t-mobile-paid-average-30-cents-mb-u-s-data-roaming-costs-2013) suggests even T-Mobile paid $0.30 per megabyte on average. There's probably almost no profit built in there, so data roaming is viewed as a courtesy, at best. 

I would venture to say the CSR is correct, that they won't alter your roaming bucket until your cycle reset date if your account is a personal account. Even if you super-promise you'll pay the money. $0.25/MB works out to $250/GB, and if there's no profit on that, they don't want you calling later to dispute the charges.
They're trying to do more with less. If there isn't enough growth to support that many employees, you've got to make sacrifices. 

It's unfortunate, but it's business.

Some of it boils down to demand. If there isn't demand to install these microcells in rural Vermont, there's almost no money in it.
The only reason I'm not going to jump on this is I just got it for $280 from CostCo with a $50 credit for using Visa Checkout. $230 still beats $250, but not by much.
I am absolutely fascinated with this story. They piggybacked on the internet and electric connections of local businesses who wanted cell phone coverage in an otherwise cellular dead zone. They had roaming agreements with 3 of the Big Four, the exception being AT&T.

From the article:

> The microcells are offline because the company is behind on paying bills to utilities including broadband and electricity companies, Clay Purvis, director of telecommunications and connectivity for the state, said in an interview.
>
>The likelihood of losing CoverageCo has prompted concern from lawmakers and Gov. Phil Scott that residents in 26 rural communities that relied on the service will soon be unable to make emergency calls.
>
>Purvis said that the state is seeking another vendor to take over CoverageCo’s cellular network as soon as possible. The department has yet to hone in on a likely candidate for the job, but will soon be posting a request for proposal from interested companies, he said.

I can confirm this phone was already in the Sprint database. It just needed an MVNO flag flip. I've gone ahead and flipped the flag for you. 

Try it now, and let me know how that goes!
It might just need a database flip, rather than a re-SKU. DM me the IMEI and I'll let you know which one it needs.
It might not need to be added. It might just be a database flag. PM me the IMEI ( I work for /r/ting, not Sprint) and I'll see if it's already in the database, or if that ClickIT is going to go anywhere to get it added.
It had a bunch of stipulations, some based around price. It had to be $8 for such-and-such time.
I was fairly certain $8 was the new floor back when Sprint laid me off. 

Now I'm almost glad I didn't get to keep the stock shares mentioned in the article.
A sad truth.
Has a restore in iTunes been performed yet? That's typically my first line of defense for stuff like this.
Same question, but I only paid $229 for a 32GB 2017. Worth the hassle to return it?
Sometimes, but it depends on the phone. I had to flash my S7E with the unlocked ROM in order to get WFC on Ting GSM. The Pixel and iPhone SE do not need to be flashed. Your S8 probably will need to be flashed to get WFC.

This had the added benefit of removing the Sprint bloat, but isn't something I recommend everyone jump into immediately if you're not 100% sure what you're doing.
Is there something wrong with the ad-hoc system we've got now? It means we can dip in and out as we please. If I get a promotion or switch jobs, no longer having access or time to flip PLBL, do we just shut down that part of the request form?

Your aim is true, and the cause is noble. I just really think anything above and beyond what currently happens should really be handled by people paid to do it on behalf of the carrier itself. 

Seriously, though. Where is Sprint's social media team on this?
I think this is a ~~bad idea~~ tough sell. Account verification is a very serious thing at a store level. If you go around changing this and that without proper ID and verification, we may lose some of the volunteer employees we have on /r/Sprint. 

This is probably best handled by Sprint's social media team.

My problem with that is let's say one of the Big Four goes and does something silly, like gives away [a free year of service](https://www.sprint.com/en/shop/offers/free-unlimited.html?ECID=vanity:1yearfree) while you're on Mint, and you can't turn it down, because it would be cheaper than even Mint.

If you leave Mint to take advantage of that offer, you're forfeiting the deal you thought you were going to get, effectively paying more per month than you thought you were. 

If you're having trouble following, I wrote up a [detailed post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoContract/comments/86l35m/freedompop_pulls_a_mintsim_starts_offering/dw6gza5/)

This is to say nothing of if Mint will still be here in April 2019. I hope and believe they will, but the MVNO universe is competitive for a reason. If Ting went belly-up tomorrow (knock-on-wood), we don't have to issue massive refunds from a pool of money we've already spent.
$GERN is a small part of my portfolio, and I'm unlikely to sell as long as it stays above $5 at any price. 

I've set a target price, and a stop loss price. If I hit the stop loss, I sell everything. If I hit my target, sell half and invest in other stocks. 

Everyone is different, and **you shouldn't take direct financial advice from me.** I'm not acting in your best interest. What I've just told you is what I'm doing. If you want your investment in $GERN to stay identical to mine, follow my lead. Others will not.

If you believe in what the company is doing, vote with your wallet. If you're looking to make a quick buck, /r/wallstreetbets is that-a-way.
I've seen analysis that says $20 isn't untenable. I'm not going to wait around for that (stop loss already set for my cost average), but this is the first stock I feel really good about riding upward.
> pay 12 months in advance 

I see this as a contract, and is why I don't use Mint as a matter of principle. This isn't even just me speaking as an employee. I have like 4 different services at any one time.

By your definition, almost none of the options listed on /r/nocontract are actually no-contract, then? Only strictly PAYGO options would qualify. 

I think the generally-accepted term of 30-ish days constitutes no-contract.

>  I'm out most of what I paid for H20 Wireless with no recourse.

Right. Breakage. h2o profits because they still get your money, but don't have to deliver a product or service. It's a smaller scale than 3 months at a time, but it's the same concept.

I think the disconnect comes back to 30 days of service being 'considered' not a contract. 

Using your definition, we can toss my employer into the strictly-PAYGO pile, then, too. We charge $6 plus usage, on a rolling month schedule. If you leave 2 weeks in, your bill is only for what you actually used, rather than us collecting the difference of what you would have used and paid for. If you used nothing, it really is just the $6.
It's identical to the GSM process. You just need to have a phone that supports either on ting.com/byod

When you run through to activate it on ting.com/activate, it will ask you if you want to activate on GSM or CDMA. If you select CDMA, it'll then ask you to enter the SIM card number on the CDMA SIM card. It then walks you through the rest of the process. 

Can you drop us a screenshot from where you're getting stuck?
Stick with me here: there is a penalty for breaking the contract on MintSIM and FP's new plans.

Let's use Boost and Mint as examples. 

On Boost, $35 = 3GB of LTE. If you have it for 1 month, then cancel for something better, you've paid $35. If you have it for 6 months, you've paid $210, or $35/month. If you only have it for 3 of those months, you've paid $105, or $35/month.

On Mint, we'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say you only bought the 6 month plan at $144. 5GB = $24 per month of LTE for all 6 months. If you have it for one month, you've paid $144 for one month. If you have it for all 6 months, you've paid $144, or $24/month. If you only have it for 3 of those months, you've paid $144, or $48/month.

All of Mint's pay-in-advance plans suffer from this pricing arrangement. [Returns on Mint are not possible according to them, outside of 7 days.](https://www.mintsim.com/return-policy/)

If you don't stick with the carrier for the allotted time, your penalty is effectively the remainder of the amount you paid. This is an [industry term called breakage.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakage) Your penalty is that you didn't actually get the deal you thought you did if you don't stick with them for the length of time you told them you would. This disincentivizes leaving, and is effectively a contract for a length of time. 

You think you're getting $24/month for 5GB of LTE, but that's only true if you stay with them for all 6 months. 

Pricing aside (because even with breakage, some carriers are cheaper than others), this is effectively a contract.
I think if you can afford it, sell the refurbished device without so much as powering it on, and switch to something new but not bleeding edge. Something that can just get you along for the next few months.

Cancel the device protection, because it seems like it doesn't do you much good at this stage. Save that money you would have spent in a savings account set aside exclusively for your new phone. Once the new round comes out this year, take your savings and get yourself something nice.
It requires a LOT of trust and working of their system to get it right. They hide stuff and make it difficult to downgrade or cancel. But signup and upgrade? That stuff is everywhere.

I have one FP SIM card, as they cancelled my other one due to program cancellation (Global SIM). The one I have works okay, but I wouldn't rely on it for talk/text if it's important that you get every call and text.
It's not outside the realm of possibility. For some reason known only to our MNO, [data roaming in Finland is $6/MB.](https://help.ting.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360001553414-International-data-roaming-rate-in-Finland-?page=1)
And I imagine your IMEI will never touch the VMU website ever again, right?
I'm still not convinced that this isn't basically a contract. In order to get the best price per month, you're signing up for a length-of-time term. Which is a contract.
No. At present DNA2 is only useful for adding iPhones. It has other functionality, but IIRC it only works for adding iPhones.

I have news. 

I can confirm the IMEI you gave me is an H790. At least, that's according to the [GSMA.](https://imeidb.gsma.com/imei/index) It supports all the relevant Sprint bands. 

But when I plug it into my database tool:
> `status	Failed`
>
>`reason	38DOES_NOT_EXIST_IN_DB: Unable to find a device in the database.`

Sprint doesn't have the serial. They straight-up won't activate it until it's been loaded into the DMD. 

Any missing information in the request they submitted for you means the request will be denied, even though it should have been approved and the device added. I've found very few who know exactly how to file the ticket correctly. 
 /u/halcyoncmdr is one, but I'm not sure he's working today.

That's probably it, then. We're focusing on getting re-SKU ability, but until then, you'll be without WFC on CDMA that phone.
Yeah, but I meant in the past. A phone either comes with a Boost SKU or has it assigned by the BYOD checker. 

If you hadn’t in the past, that means it came with it.
Did you ever run the phones IMEI through the Boost Mobile BYOD check?

Done. Sorry I was on lunch.

/u/Flounderhounder69 your device should be good to go in under 10 minutes. Try it again and let us know if that worked.
GSM, yes; CDMA, no. Send me an DM with your Ting email address and I'll look into it for you. 
Here's the rub on CDMA WiFi Calling, and why your phone won't work. 

CDMA WFC works a lot differently from GSM WFC. For a reason unknown to us, Sprint has locked out any prepaid SKUs from using the WFC infrastructure. The SKU on your phone matters.

The phone in question, /u/captshaw, has a SKU of `IPH 6 GRAY 64 BST BOX SGL`. From this, we can tell it's a Space Gray iPhone 6 in 64GB. The `BST` stands for Boost, which is one of Sprint's prepaid brands. 

As a prepaid brand, it's locked out of using the WFC implementation given to Ting by Sprint.

The exact same thing is actually happening to me, too. The SKU on my iPhone is `BYOFD ISE GRY 128 VMU SGL` because I've used it on Virgin Mobile. Because of this, I don't get the option to use CDMA WFC on this phone on Ting.

The sad part is we don't yet have a way to fix the SKUs on these phones so they can use WFC.

We're in talks with Sprint on a solution, because this isn't useful for us long-term. We want you to be able to use WFC on your CDMA phone on Ting, regardless of where you got it or where you've used it. 

We don't have a firm timeline yet on when this is gonna be fixed, because things sometimes move slow when you're a rough-and-tumble MVNO demanding things from your network partner. But as soon as we do have a solution (and our product team is all over this one, I assure you), I'll post to the sub about it.

tl;dr Sprint is locking these devices out. We're working on removing the restriction.

/u/halcyoncmdr is on the case, but if it's going to take too long, I would be glad to flip this ownership flag.
I see two problems. 

1. Sprint is not paying these employees for their time to submit requests like this, despite Sprint having a presence on Reddit (even official accounts) and on other social media sites. These employees should be here doing that. 

2. Better training of existing agents would negate the need for specific Points of Contact for something inside policy, like an unlock request or MVNO flag flip.
Do you want me to just flip it?
The bands are 4/2/12/71/66, in that order.
Yes. Refer to [this article from my awesome employer](https://help.ting.com/hc/en-us/articles/205428218-Finding-Your-SIM-Card?mobile_site=true) to wrap your head around Sprint's SIM madness. Sprint will use the 'Part' designation on their SIMs.
Can you DM me the help request number? There's a good chance your issue is related to something else going on, but I want to confirm. The help request number should start with a 2.
> but is supported on the Sprint-branded devices.

Playing with this idea a bit, does that mean if someone flashes the Sprint ROM onto an unlocked version, it'll do Calling Plus and WFC?
S9, the standard version. The plus is more expensive, and doesn't offer a whole lot more on top of the base model.
You'll need a new SIM card. The Pixel 2 requires SIMOLW416Q or SIMGLW416Q. The S6 doesn't use that SIM.
I recommend checking out /r/essential before you buy it. Know what your challenges might be before investing. 

I would say your best bet for a phone that will last a good long time is something in the iPhone or Galaxy line. Repeatedly, those are the phones that last a long time, have decent hardware support and easily-replacable parts, or at least easily-acquired parts should something go wrong.
Yeah, why should this sub focus on a redeeming feature of a phone that barely gets a mention anywhere else!

/s
Peter Thiel is what happens if you take Richard Branson and Mark Cuban and remove all likeability.
I work for Ting and can confirm what you were told. Custom ROMs don't have the SprintDM application that we and Sprint use for provisioning. 

Usually the 72786 reset works, but if your custom ROM dialer doesn't have that dialer code set to trigger SprintDM, it won't activate. 

I've gotten around this before by keeping a stock ROM on my SD card. Flash to stock, activate, then flash your custom. 

You shouldn't need to delete anything between flashes.
It should be compatible. It might just be something weird on our end.
It's probably the app and carrier your sender is using.
Android Messenger and Textra are by far the best. But if the recipient doesn't support RCS, they're always going to get resized no matter what. 

Using data apps like GroupMe, Hangouts and Discord, you avoid this problem completely.
What model of phone is on your CDMA line?
MMS has a file size limit. If the recipient phone isn't using a Android Messenger RCS-compliant client, it'll come through as MMS, and will be resampled and the quality reduced.
I used to do this all the time when I sold a laptop or printer in Mobile. It didn't make any difference to me, and the Connected people always appreciated the revenue help enough where they'd come to help me in Mobile if I was slammed. 

Good times.
Unless it specifically says refurbished, devices from Ting are always brand new. 

I asked because devices sold from Samsung and by us should work great with WFC.
This is almost probably related to software on the phone in question, and the MNOs desire to control what a user can and can't put in their APN field. Custom ROM developers seem not to have this problem.
It probably was. The BBY trade-in site is fickle. Some days, a [Motorola Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Q) is $75, the next day it's $0.

It's based on the needs of their trade-in supplier.

Just got a message back from our product team. It's been approved! You should be able to activate now.
Please keep us posted about the outcome, because if this really is us, we should know about it and should try to do everything in our power to fix it.
It might be, but you report it worked great on CDMA. You can always make an appointment at an Apple store, as you already know the SIM works otherwise.
The 'check back in one business day' is standard if you're on of the first to activate the device on Ting. If you PM me the IMEI, I can ask the people in charge of that kind of thing to approve it.

Strange. The IMEI passes our BYOD checker, but not T-Mobile's. It's listed as unlocked, so it should work fine. 

Try a carrier reset before continuing; Settings > Reset > Reset Network Settings.
The regular YouTube app does this.

`Promo is no longer valid.`

Was this really only eligible on Tuesday?
It's sharty.
They were rights-protected Word files. 

So, it sounds like not much has changed since I left. They were talking about metrics based on exchanges, and it sounds like that's exactly what they got. 

I'm still not super keen on the idea of a known-issue still counting against metrics, if it does. I left right after they dropped the G4 as a KI, and I can't imagine what the store did about it based on their volume.
The VMI guides were available back when I still worked for Asurion (coming up on a year soon). What makes the new access different?

It makes sense for Helix to track issues not otherwise acknowledged, as you wouldn't want to send out a refurbished device with a defect you know will either come back or need to go back through the S&R rigamarole. 
The question is if this was easier than securing a DSU from Sprint.
Reading through my old comments. Did you guys ever get access to Helix?
Make no mistake, there are no scripts at Ting. We go by what the information says. If it says the bank is unable to process the transaction, that's what we tell you. 

Capital One *is* a bank! They're the lending institution that underwrites your credit card. Check your terms, it'll confirm that.

As for the details of the failure this time, I don't really like getting into account specifics in a public forum. It's tacky for any company to do on a regular basis, and results in things being said that can't be unsaid. I've already spoken to Jesse and he's looking at the payment failure notice now and will be following up via email.
You need to call and request an unlock from tech support. You'll probably have better luck chatting with the international team at sprint.com/chat

The MSL will do you no good for SIM unlocking and is not a SIM unlock code.
I read somewhere that Sprint was working on adding non-Sprint and non-unlocked S7/S7E/S8/S8+ to the DMD, but I haven't gotten confirmation.

If this is the case, you should be able to bring your T-Mobile S9 to Sprint. If not, Sprint won't accept the phone, as it's not in the DMD.
I've had a look over the case and multiple advisors have confirmed with you that the issue is the bank not being able to approve the transactions. 

The last agent you spoke with, Jesse, is drafting an email to you now. Please check your inbox!

Edit: without getting into account details, I'd like anyone stumbling across this thread to know that OP left some key details out of the posted version of events. OP has decided that Ting is not the right fit at this time.
There's not anything in the immediate pipeline, though it's been on our wish list, and we'v been talking about it for years. 

Basically, we're still where we were 5 years ago when [CBC ran this report](https://youtu.be/gjdfzxYnmDA).
I'd venture a guess and say ay least half the staff at Ting is better than I am, based only on tenure. I've only been here a little under a year, and I still have a lot to learn.
I would be cautious. The phones in question didn't usually exhibit symptoms until about a year into their life cycle. The V30 hasn't been out that long.

At the minimum, make sure you know your warranty and replacement options.
I think you misunderstood my comment. Both those LG phones are well-known for bootloop issues. Your next choice, if those subs had any advice, would be to avoid an LG device until LG proves they can release a device that isn't going to bootloop.
We're constantly looking at rates. Without knowing what Tello pays their network provider, we can't compete directly with their price structure.
> Don't be surprised when I pick LG

Please don't pick LG. /r/lgg4 and /r/nexus5x implore you not to pick LG.
Ting CDMA numbers aren't eligible, per Sprint's rules. Probably because they're technically Sprint numbers.
Without having the ticket in front of me, or looking at Kyle's profile to find it, I'm going to guess it was a fix we can run on the network side that solves a bunch of issues on the GSM side.
And $250 phone cases. 
I think it runs deep. Look at OP's complete submission history.
To be fair, PUBG only has two, and only one on Xbox. 
Without knowing what US Mobile pays their network provider (it's different than what we pay), we can't directly compete with their pricing.
Last year, absolutely. But with anticipation and release of the S9, the [price has dropped precipitously.](https://imgur.com/WJiiXTV)

Now is the time for the S7 to shine in the secondhand market, because we've hit a plateau in the Android market where small bumps every year mean you can go 3 or 4 years without seriously upgrading a flagship, save for some notable examples from LG and Huawei.
They tried that. It was called Framily. [It didn't end well.](https://www.cnet.com/news/sprint-ceo-dan-hesses-farewell-memo-to-employees/) 
> Ting has REALLY wide hours on their helpline

Specifically:

Weekdays from 8am to 1am EST

Weekends from 8am to 11pm EST
Then I cannot sincerely enough suggest a secondhand Galaxy S7. I also recommend an S7 Edge, if you can stretch your budget just a little bit. 

It will outperform most of your list, has a fingerprint scanner, Micro instead of C (but you said that isn't make/break anyway), will get a sizeable number of software updates (and already has) and replacement parts aside from the screen are dirt cheap. 

My recommendation is to get a secondhand S7/S7E from Swappa or eBay and pick up a brand new battery. Pay a local shop to replace it or [try it yourself.](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Samsung+Galaxy+S7+Battery+Replacement/90299)

I've got an S7E on Ting (full disclosure, I work for Ting) and it's probably my favorite Android phone I've ever owned. I looked at the S8 and S9 and they didn't *wow* me out of my love for this phone.

If you could only see our Facebook ad comments. Some people make it a point to post everything cheaper and with more this/that/the other. 
Does it need to be brand new?
It's not, but China's two biggest markets are the EU and the US.

I'm not sure the current protectionist policies of the American government make Xiaomi a safe bet.

E: phrasing
The flex policy only stays on the device until the first SIM is inserted. After the SIM is inserted, the policy changes to mirror the policy of the first SIM card. If that's the new carrier activation policy, that's what's going to be applied to the new phone.
The point of sale interfaces with Apples activation policy servers. At least, that's how it worked at Sprint.
What's the paired device?
It does. Do you know what your Carrier Version is, by chance? Settings > About.
If BBY's exchange system is anything like Sprint's or Apple's the activation policy will follow him to the new handset. I don't recommend your course of action for dealing with flex policy.
It's not normal to have to do that every day. What OS version are you running on your Pixel?
It sounds like the G4 was the perfect fit for you, and that's an excellent price for it! I had it for a while, and loved everything about it. I definitely paid more than you did, though.

For anyone interested, they can not keep you from unionizing. Management is trained to dissuade you and say unions are a bad thing. If you really like the work, they're really not.
This is just a database flag flip. I do this all the time for customers on /r/Ting. Did CellNuvo support solve it? It should take all of about 30 seconds to fix.

We nixed International Roaming on CDMA [back in December of 2015.](https://ting.com/blog/international-roaming-on-cdma-is-no-more/) It got more expensive than we could reasonably make work.

But, it's back! LTE devices are eligible to roam internationally. CDMA-only (meaning 3G, non-LTE) devices won't see the feature on your dashboard. 

Just make sure you [check the rates before you go](https://ting.com/outside_usa) and enable International Roaming on the line:

>1. Log into your Ting account online

>2. Go to Device settings

>3. Click on the GSM or CDMA device(s) that you'll be traveling with

> 4. Enable Can use international roaming

**What hasn't changed:**

As always, we don't recommend international roaming if you expect high usage, as even at a few pennies per megabyte, it can add up very quickly. We will still allow [international unlocks \(ISU\) for active Ting accounts](https://help.ting.com/hc/en-us/articles/205422098-International-SIM-Unlock-), and still recommend using third-party messaging apps to keep your usage low. 

We can answer any questions here or at [ting.com/support](https://ting.com/support)

We offer a few levels of service. I'm cutting out a lot of nuance, but

2G is the slowest tech we offer. It was ground-breaking in its day, but in the past few years, phones need higher bandwidth. On our GSM network, this is shown on your phone as `2G`, `GPRS` or `GSM`. On the CDMA network, it's shown as `1x`. 

3G was the bread and butter of all networks 9-ish years ago. A majority of our rural customers on CDMA will enjoy this network, because it still works for talk, text and a modest amount of data. Our GSM network provider is turning their 3G off rapidly, but you'll see it called `3G`, HSPA `H` or HSPA+ `H+`. On CDMA, it's just called `3G`. 

If you have `H` or `H+`, just know that you're getting good data speeds, just not the absolute fastest that we offer. 

That's reserved for LTE. If you came from Verizon, you're familiar with this, probably by its name on Verizon, `4GLTE`. Whether your phone can get LTE depends on what frequencies it has. I'm pretty sure your phone supports B2 and B4, which are two of our four LTE bands. That's excellent, because it's the two most-common ones nationwide.

It might just be a setting that's keeping your phone from connecting to LTE, or it might be coverage. Aside from the APN settings, did you change anything else on your phone before switching it to Ting? If you're familiar enough with your settings, check if your phone's network mode is set to Global, GSM/UMTS or LTE. If you're not comfortable finding it, [Verizon has a great KB article here.](https://www.verizonwireless.com/support/knowledge-base-117657/). Play around with that setting a little, and reboot your phone to see if you can get LTE coverage.

Should you need anything else, don't hesitate to post here. We've got an excellent community who loves to share tips and tricks. We've also got a fair number of employees who browse the sub, present company included, who can work magic sometimes on Ting accounts.
**WELCOME TO /R/TING!**

You should start by giving a quick read through our [Cut Your Data eBook](https://ting.com/blog/save-on-smartphone-mobile-data-with-free-cut-your-data-ebook/). It details lots of ways to keep your usage low. Then, install [GlassWire.](https://ting.com/blog/glasswire-app/)

Rooting and custom ROMs are not something to toy with unless you absolutely, 100% know what you're doing. If that's an avenue you want to pursue, I do NOT recommend doing it on your daily driver phone. I recommend picking up something like an old Nexus 5 for dirt cheap so that if you mess something up, you're not without a phone. Then, head over to [xda](https://www.xda-developers.com/
) and dive in.

Otherwise, you likely won't need to advance beyond `Download app, use app`, because that's going to be 99% of what you do anyway. Custom ROMs are less necessary on Ting, because we give you some of the carrier features (like tethering) that people used to root their phones to get, anyway.

Is your phone already up and running on the network? If you're having issues, it's almost sure to be something APN-related. We've got a [guide to help you through that here.](https://help.ting.com/hc/en-us/articles/205428698-GSM-Android-APN-setup-guide)

If that thread closes before your Cake Day arrives, just keep an eye on the top of our sub. We sticky the thread.
If you consistently are over a bucket, then you typically belong in that bucket. If it's a one-time thing, we're not above crediting the difference moving on. If $6 one month is going to make or break you being a customer, we'd rather just eat the cost and keep you on. How many other providers do you know would do that?
It's a couple of things. I won't bore you with a lot of details, just a few high-level things. 

1. Breakage. We figure lots of Mint customers won't fulfill all the months they pay for, and Mint banks on that to pocket the difference. This works out the same way for customers who don't use all X gigabytes they're purchasing in a month. If you're buying their 2GB plan and not using 2GB, you're overpaying. Sure, it's not much at that price point, but it's all money to Mint.

2. Customer service. From what I gather over at /r/mintsim, it leaves a lot to be desired. That's not a problem at Ting. Properly training your staff to solve problems the first time someone calls isn't something you can outsource.

3. Purchase agreements. Mint is owned by a big company called Ultra Mobile. If Ultra can promise a network provider so many activations, they'll get a good rate. If they fail to deliver, they pay a penalty or higher rates the next time the contract is negotiated. We don't play that game, so we set our activations to be achievable, profitable and with the lowest cost for the end-user we can make work.

4. Contracts. Mint requires so many months purchased at a time to get a certain rate. This sounds a lot like a contract, don't you think? This builds a little bit of stability on your subscriber numbers, because they're more-or-less locked in if they want to get your promised rate. You can set your purchase agreements and discounts with contracts. 

We do compete with Mint, and we see people jump around, back and forth a lot. Reddit aside, the general public doesn't like the hassle of switching, or setting their iPhone APN settings manually every time there's an iOS update ([yes, that's a thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/mintsim/comments/7ipdpm/permanently_set_apn_settings_on_iphone_xpost/)). Stability means something for a large section of the public who doesn't want to worry about whether or not they're getting the best deal.
Can confirm these phones aren't eligible to be unlocked by Sprint and will only ever really work with Sprint or Sprint MVNOs. (I worked for Sprint for 4 years before leaving for Ting).

Noted. Our map is lacking a *lot* of what we'd need to make it consumer-ready. For example, you can't really search our map like you can a consumer coverage map. 

We use the map provided by our GSM network provider, specifically because they update faster than we're able to with our internal map. And when they launch new features like a frequency breakdown (which our map does not have), we don't want to be left holding the bag. The best option out there is the one our network providers give us.
Taking this a step further, [Sensorly doesn't help the consensus at all.](https://imgur.com/RsfffyI)
You might have found a unique spot on the Ting coverage map which is gonna change how I explain roaming.

[Here's Kanab LTE coverage on our internal map](https://imgur.com/bgXEbWr). Almost nothing. Clearly the coverage map is overcompensating and optimistic. 

[Here's Kanab HSPA coverage.](https://imgur.com/dJYT0HV) The circle shape around Kanab itself suggests one tower. Because there appears to technically be LTE coverage, the map is optimistic in applying it to anywhere you would reasonably expect coverage with no obstacles (mountains) in place.

[Here's expected roaming coverage](https://imgur.com/8xMT9lz). It's above and beyond what the coverage map expects to be available. 

Without an app like SignalCheck or LTE Discovery to verify the tower you were connected to, my guess is you were, in fact, roaming on the roaming network despite being inside what our GSM partner considers a good network coverage area. It's pretty clear the map needs to be addressed to reflect this, and I'll look at sending that feedback up the chain to the GSM partner.
I wouldn't think that all of SW Utah could be attributed to poor throughput. And because the coverage map showed LTE coverage, there's no reason to believe it was roaming coverage.

There shouldn't have been anything else needed on your end. The issue likely lies in configuration (ours or the network provider) or the frequency used. Do you recall having a data symbol next to your bars at all? You had coverage bars, as you had talk and text, but was there [a data symbol](https://techwelkin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/mobile-signal-meaning-phone-icons-techwelkin.jpg) next to them?
No. Just know that it's usually AT&T.
I don't. I usually just go with the second cheapest on eBay. Never buy the cheapest battery.

Roaming on GSM ≠ Roaming on CDMA. 

To clarify, when you're roaming on CDMA, if the partner network (Sprint) can't reach you for any reason, the roaming network will step in and provide talk and text coverage until partner coverage improves. This applies nationwide. 

While roaming on GSM, you will only roam on the GSM roaming network (typically AT&T) in specific areas where the network partner has determined they don't have enough coverage. This means, if the coverage map shows good partner network signal, you'll not be able to connect to a roaming network, even if the partner network signal isn't strong enough to reach you. 

You could be down the block from a roaming network tower, see amazing signal strength from it in your network options, and not be able to connect to it at all, because of how the GSM roaming works. This is why it was a big deal in the wake of Hurricane Maria that AT&T basically enabled roaming for other carriers on its towers to assist with rescue efforts.

We also don't offer domestic data roaming at all, so if you were, in fact connected to a roaming network, you wouldn't have had any data service. You might get the signal itself (LTE, HSPA), but you shouldn't see data passthrough.
We absolutely do support it. That said, B71 is still really sparse. 

Here's a map from /r/tmobile user /u/lart2150 that shows B71 locations (live rollouts, not coverage guesses): https://coverage.lart2150.com/

Unless you live in one of those areas, you're not going to notice a significant bump in signal strength as a result of our B71 support.

Once you have your shortcode, you need something on the back end to interpret it. Texts sent to you aren't any good if you don't have something to intercept, track and run ~~billing~~ campaigns to communicate with your users.

You've got to be mindful of your data usage, and if you tend to use a lot of data in a month, you'll have to run the numbers. 

Right now, I've got two phones active on Ting GSM (running on everyone's favorite Pink carrier) and a phone on Ting CDMA (running on Sprint). All usage is pooled, so you don't feel like you 'have to' use data on a specific phone if you only want to look something up. 

On July, I'm going to bring my iPhone SE back to Ting CDMA (from where it is on VMU right now) and that'll bring the lineup to 4 phones. 1 iPhone SE (CDMA), 1 Galaxy S7E (GSM), 1 Droid Mini (GSM) and one Treo 800w (CDMA).

It's my job to answer these kinds of questions, so yes, you can run your iPhone X on CDMA and a OnePlus on GSM with combined billing.

The policy on the iPad using the IMEI you sent is as follows:


`Code: F2104 `

`Description: P10x Multi-Mode Carrier Policy `

`ID: 2104 `

`SIM Policy: MM_P10x`

I believe this means it's still locked to T-Mobile. There's not much else out there on this policy, but you probably can't move forward until T-Mobile unlocks it for you.
For reference, I can't recreate this on my S7E, so it might be exclusive to the Pixel and Nexus lines.

Not really. It'll get 2G service for talk and text, but take a look at the [GSMArena reported network frequencies for the global version](https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_mi_a1-8776.php#global):

`4G bands	LTE band 1(2100), 3(1800), 5(850), 7(2600), 8(900), 20(800), 38(2600), 40(2300)`

On GSM, we use Band 4(1700/2100), Band 2(1900), Band 12(700) and Band 71(600). None of the models listed get any of those. 

What is it about the A1 that strikes you as great? Maybe we can point you in the direction of a phone that has that feature, but will still work on Ting.

Yes. The limiting factors are (1) the Sprint whitelist, which does not have the OP5T and (2) typically, dual-SIM devices usually have SIM1 for talk/text/data and SIM2 for talk/text.

I attempted to do this with my dual SIM adapter. It was controlled via the SIM app, and it barely worked.

The phone number you're given is based on:

- The network provider's number resources
- The zip code you provide when activating
- Available NPA-NXX at the time of activation

You're always given a local number based on your [zip code during activation.](https://help.ting.com/hc/en-us/articles/205428538-Activating-a-GSM-BYOD-Device-with-a-New-Number)

Once you provide your zip code and address, [we actually ask where you'd like your number to come from.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/screensteps_live/images/tucows/315353/2/rendered/68860bc4-cc25-470f-9f27-06d5d5cb88e5.png)
Do you have Hangouts set to take calls on one device, or multiple?
Sadly not. While this kind of control is technically possible on a phone like the iPhone (with a SIM-switching adapter), the OP5T isn't in Sprint's whitelist database. You'll want to get a GSM SIM and your phone will run on 4/2/12/71 as you expected. 

The "multi-network" phones in the shop don't jump back and forth. They're listed that way because the phones will work on either GSM or CDMA, and when you order from us, we'll ship both SIM cards so you can choose. 

We don't yet have a way to initiate Fi-style dynamic switching. At present, you pick a network and roll with it. 

If you had a phone that was technically compatible (most of the new Moto devices, the iPhone, Pixel/Nexus devices), you could technically roll on both networks (one at a time) with a SIM switching adapter. You'd have to have both SIMs active ($6 line charge each) and while one is active, the other phone number doesn't work. 

I tried it with one of [these](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Dual-SIM-Card-Adapter-2-SIM-Holder-Converter-4G-For-Apple-iPhone-5-6-6S-Plus/371907586949?hash=item56976b6b85:g:uR8AAOSwdGFYy74H) on my iPhone SE. It would switch networks just fine, but after a few minutes on either network, the phone would drop to `No SIM` and I'd have to re-seat the adapter to get any signal. Rinse, repeat. 

I contacted the seller, and they offered an immediate refund. Amazon reviews suggest my experience is not unique. A pain, not worth it, and definitely not realistically functional. 
Tinitell operates on 2G networks. As AT&T shut down their 2G network last year, in the United States the only carrier the watches feasibly run on would be T-Mobile and its MVNOs.

That it doesn't happen at all on your phone leads me to believe it might, in fact, be a hardware issue. The LTE radios are distinctly different from the HSPA and GSM radios. Are you still within warranty on it?

[I posted my guidelines when they extended it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Sprint/comments/6h8ibw/switch_to_sprint_and_get_free_unlimited_for_1/djys30o/), figuring I'd get a few replies from the faithful who read the threads.

If data speeds are your concern on T-Mobile, you really shouldn't look towards Cricket.

Treating certain data as exempt from buckets and as 'special' seems a little anti-Net Neutrality.

But I've come to believe that speedtests aren't super indicative of how you'll end up using the network. [ISPs can and do skew the results](https://hackernoon.com/jio-airtel-and-a-fishy-speed-test-764a8f137656) a little by hosting their own nodes and prioritizing traffic to the Ookla Speedtest app. 

The speeds are identical to the host networks, and as best we can tell is no different from the MNO's own customers. [Sensorly's map logs speedtests](http://sensorly.com/map#|speedtests,download), unlike anything available from Ookla without paying, and a quick glance at the map gives me [what I can expect in parts of towns like Chicago.](https://imgur.com/cHrfNmt)

It's not advertised basically anywhere outside of Reddit and SlickDeals. Stores can't touch any account with it. If they do, the free year is lost.
The longer water sits on that board the more damage is done. The longer you leave it, the less likely a repair shop can fix it.
The water leaves behind residue which bridges connections on the board that shorts out circuits and chips. You need someone with a specialized machine to remove all the buildup and residue. In addition, you'll probably need a new battery and display, if those were damaged by water. 

Do not open the phone. Do not use a hair dryer. Bring it immediately to your local cell phone repair shop and let them handle it. You can do serious damage with a hair dryer, and you can make the problem worse by opening the phone and not knowing exactly what you're doing. 
It's probably not hacked. 

It's very likely the S7 you bought is the GSM unlocked Korean variant of the phone. You can verify this in settings -> About. The model number is searchable online to check if that's the case. 

I think this because the website you linked to is roaming authorization for SK Telecom, a cell phone company in South Korea. Their roaming might work differently than ours. 

Geek Squad might not know this, but you can safely use an unlocked phone from South Korea in the states.

False. Do not freeze your phone. You run the risk of doing real long-term damage to your battery. 

Burn-in is fatigue of the pixels in your display. There are two ways to remedy this. 

1. Fatigue all the pixels. Run one of the burn-in fixer apps from the Play Store for several hours over several days. This has the added detriment of making your whole screen just a little darker, but the burn-in will not be noticable. 

2. Replace the screen. The display is [roughly $160](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Samsung-Galaxy-Note-5-Display-Assembly-LCD-and-Touch-Screen-N920T-N920P-N920A/172808721830?hash=item283c33d5a6:m:m0P5_12QGj9y1CHUlnRmsBw), not including labor. If you got it done at a local fix-it shop, it would run between $200 and $300, because labor is intensive on the Note 5. 

Speaking as a former repair technician for Asurion, I would say either deal with the burn-in until you can upgrade, or save up some money and have a repair shop do it right. You can easily damage the screen if you do it yourself, and then you're out the money.

If you missed something, you left them with the ability to charge you. 

Complaining to the BBB is a step below leaving a bad Yelp review. The BBB is a for-profit organization that has no government or enforcement arm. They send a letter on your behalf to the company, and post your review on that company's public BBB page. The company has a chance to respond, but can pay to remove or downplay your complaint. By complaining to the BBB, you've just given the company the upper-hand and supported the BBB.

I sincerely hope they change it up, because that seems like a cable bill to me.
A regular port to Sprint shouldn't be an issue, but if you're trying to take advantage of their one-year-free deal, Ting CDMA numbers aren't eligible. Sprint considers them "already Sprint".

It should be compatible if our checker says it works on CDMA. It might need the ownership flag flipped, but as long as it's unlocked, it's otherwise eligible.

Is it that bad?
I could do fixed wireless from any cellular carrier, but my usage is through the roof. I work from home and 400GB per month is not uncommon for me.
Unlikely. I have the S7E and the S8 wasn't a big enough jump. From what I've seen of the S9, that won't be big enough, either. 

I think we've hit a breaking point in the smartphone world where people will end up keeping their phones longer and longer, provided they still do the things they did at launch (Samsung Pay) and cases and accessories are still available.

In the S2/S3/S4 days, this was not the case. I think the S5 was the first phone that had a bit of longevity to it, and Samsung didn't try to reinvent the wheel every time. 

Apple's had this problem since the iPhone 6, battery issues aside.

I'll likely keep it till at least the S10 (or whatever it's called), and even then it'll probably need to introduce new features (Bixby isn't a feature. It's a software bug) to encourage me to ditch what I believe to be the best Android phone I've ever owned.

This can't be understated. We won't talk to anyone about your account without verifying your account. At all. We can talk generalities, but the second something requires us to access your account, you've gotta be verified. 

I see a few tickets every quarter from livid customers on social media (my department) who can't or won't, for whatever reason, verify they have access to the email address and thus the PIN on the account. I see it as a point of pride.

Our verification is a temporary 2FA-style PIN sent to your email address. Don't like that? Set a permanent password that nobody can guess. 

Our port-out PINs are not these PINs. Our port-out PINs are more or less randomly generated, and are different for every line on the account. They're only accessible through the web portal (for which you can use 2FA) or through our agents (who need account verification before we change or give any information). 

This isn't by accident, and it's one of the reasons I'm a customer in addition to being an employee.

I don't have this option. It's Comcast, DSL, dial-up or Satellite.
Domestic roaming is expensive. Really expensive. In 2014, T-Mobile paid [probably $0.30/MB in domestic data roaming charges.](https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/study-t-mobile-paid-average-30-cents-mb-u-s-data-roaming-costs-2013) Literally tens of millions of dollars every quarter. 

That's why most carriers offer very little, and why a majority of MVNOs don't offer roaming at all.

We (I work for /r/ting) only offer it on talk and text (no data) because of how expensive it is. And running on the T-Mobile network means just that; the T-Mobile network.

As for the support reps, that's standard for high-turnover outsourced reps. They're following a script. You can't really fault them for not knowing something not written down in front of them.

That doesn't make headlines. Headlines drive activations.
Well, let's be fair. You can't have him come out and say "We'll improve. Promise. In 18-24 months, we'll be number 2 or 3 in most places."
You might need to go postpaid for that level of data service. There's no way an MVNO can make 20 gigabytes overwhelmingly profitable at current wholesale prices.

Before someone mentions it, I'm not sure Fi is overwhelmingly profitable, and most standard postpaid unlimited is ~$70 for one line.
Minus the wireless charging coils, but yeah!
For how many gigabytes, though?
I don't want to be *that guy*, but it says in updates that they did ship, while under new management.
But what is "unlimited"? Like, what does that phrase mean? It doesn't mean infinity gigabytes, right?
That isn't really a thing at most companies, versus expense reports, which are.
It's not functionally more expensive than other carriers when you know you don't need "unlimited" and are comfortable pooling your usage. 

But to your point, we're focused on being sustainable and profitable. We just celebrated 6 years in the cell phone business, and we want many, many more. Lots of MVNOs have come and gone and tear each other apart over price. If we always struggled to be the cheapest at all expense, we could never best an established player like FreedomPop. 

But we believe (and, I've come to believe) that if price isn't everything, you really can build value in customer service. Make no mistake; it's what we're known for and what we strive to be known for. Mint's customer service is relatively vacant, FreedomPop charges for tech support and the last time I had to call Virgin Mobile for an ESN swap (I'm a customer of theirs), it was 10 minutes before a person picked up.

That's not what we want. We strive for instant pick-ups when you call, hold times under a minute if we can't, and empowered phone agents who don't need to transfer you or defer to a manager (and put you on hold) when all you want is a charge reversed for some spam texts or someone to walk you through MMS settings.

We can't provide that experience while also cannibalizing our rates. It doesn't make good business sense. Churn is low when almost all customers who call in get their issue resolved correctly the first time. People realize that, and our Facebook reviews, Twitter @mentions and Instagram re-grams show it. The response to stellar customer service is massive, because better *matters*.

When I started with Ting, I read all this kind of stuff, and I had been a customer on and off for years, and never had to use support. But I'm in the minority of cell phone users. I'm a techie millennial. But someone like my mom? I hate hearing she had to call Comcast and wait on hold for an hour for her bill being wrong. If I had the option, I'd rather she be with a company, even if it costs a bit more, with a human connection on the other side. 

And this is after working for Sprint for years. I'd have customers shouting at me for some department's screw-up that was beyond my control, and there was absolutely no way if I got them on the phone again that they'd get the same agent. If an off-script human could have just stepped in and looked at the situation, it would have made all the difference. Off-script humans cost money, and if your goal is always the bottom line, you're way more likely to outsource customer service.

If you pool your lines and watch your data, Ting isn't much more expensive than lots of other carriers, and for someone like me is actually cheaper. 3 lines, everything we need without too much adjustment, and my last Ting bill was $49.22.

E: Spelling
Oof. I ran into that exact issue with my LG G4. I never did get it resolved, and I gave up and just sold it as locked to Sprint. The kicker? I worked for Sprint at the time.

If you've never done it before, you'll likely break the screen. I did it for a year and a half, and I still broke S5 screens all the time.

Yep. Nowhere on that page does it say the 10GB is good for a month. You bought 10GB over the course of a year. You've used it in just over a month.

This is common with the yearly plans. I think the 

> Data is reset after each 30 day cycle

at the bottom of that page only applies to their monthly plans, which you didn't buy.

They do suggest that it's 30 days, from the questions:

That link goes nowhere, though. All the other plans ($55, for example) have the `30-Day Plan` verbiage in their description. The one I linked is specifically a `365-Day Plan.`

Fun fact: That movie was filmed in Woodstock, Illinois. Every year on February 2nd, Woodstock has a celebration around it. This year was the 25th anniversary.

We partner with a company called [Tweakker](https://www.tweakker.com/) for seamless APN setup. We submit the GSM phone number and IMEI to them. They determine if the device supports automatic APN profiles (I believe based on IMEI) and sends it along if the device supports automatic APN setup. If it doesn't, we get a message back that the device doesn't support it, and at that point we send out a text message with the proper instructions.
Neat.gif
Usually it doesn't matter, as long as it's one of those two, but you're limited to that network. 

That said, we also check both carrier's payment agreements. If the device is stil locked, it's likely there's a payment agreement still in place. If that's the case, the BYOD checker will refuse to let you activate it.
Yes, but I don't think it's Ting-specific. Spammers have gotten better at spoofing phone numbers over the past few years, and legal threats against them fall flat, as many are either functionality untraceable, or international. 

Some blocking apps work okay for many of the bogus calls, but not all by a long shot. I've taken up the mantra of not answering a phone call unless I recognize the number, and only giving out my Google Voice phone number, which has spam and scam blocking already built in. 

At some point I may ditch my native number and move exclusively to Google Voice, but I'm not there yet.
I sold off most of my position when I left the company. This seems like a hit piece to short the stock or pick it up on sale. It worked. The price dropped below $5 earlier before rebounding.

My cost basis is just over $6 for what I have left. I want a big rebound, but I haven't lost any money on $S as the hike to $8 made my decision for me.
As others have suggested, you can use Hangouts Dialer without WiFi calling. The calls route through Google rather than over the carrier network. 

I do this, as laid out [on the blog here](https://ting.com/blog/google-hangouts-free-outbound-wi-fi-calling/). All my outbound calls are basically free at that point on WiFi. I continue to use this over data when I'm not on WiFi, too, because data calls end up being cheaper than jumping to another bucket.

If set up correctly, when he calls them, it'll arrive from his Ting phone number and nobody but you two are the wiser.
So, you haven't received the update yet.
Yeah, we sent out GSM SIM cards to customers we thought (based on coverage and device) would have a better experience in GSM.

I say activate it on GSM and try out the coverage. If you love it, keep it. If you don't, let me know and I'll send you out a CDMA SIM for that phone. No sense sending it now in case GSM works okay for you.
> personalfinance

> /r/Ting

This checks out.
And do you have a compatible CDMA SIM already?
Settings >About. What build are you on?
Sprint does not count Ting service in the 50 days requirement for unlocking. You'll probably need to activate it on Sprint proper for 50 days if you ever want to get it unlocked.
You can do a network swap as long as you have a GSM SIM card. If the network doesn't work for yo, and you want to head back to CDMA, you'll need a compatible CDMA SIM. What phone is it, so we can double-check which SIM you'll need?

In theory number ports aren't supposed to happen in quick succession (it causes issues sometimes) but if you try out GSM for a week or so, we should be able to avoid issues if you want to move back to CDMA.
Did you make sure to enable international roaming before you left on your Ting dashboard?
$0.99 in the US.

Worth it for a few minutes of fun while you figure out which combos make the magic happen. Not a huge replay value, but really catchy songs.

That should be the correct SIM.

Ditto. I'll ask around.
> It's just whitelisting the device that is important.

Truth. This is the SPCS/PLBL switch I was talking about. All Pixel and Nexus devices should already be in the Sprint DMD if they're certified to work in the US. This was a big deal back when Sprint launched BYOFD.

Feel free to tag me in any thread where a user needs the ownership flag flipped to be able to activate on Sprint. The alternatives are the MVNO in question flipping it (which seems to not be a thing on some MVNOs, oddly) or contacting Sprint tech support, who usually has no idea what an ownership flag flip is, or files the right ticket with a 3-day turnaround time. 
You're right. In Sprint's DMD, the phone ownership flag is set to **PLBL** when it's on Fi, and needs to be flipped back to **SPCS** before Sprint will activate it. 

But I'm unsure if a direct port from Fi to Sprint is possible with the same hardware, because the device is technically active. I know you can port to GVoice in between, and there's no issue.

We have a system for porting from Sprint or any of its MVNOs to our MVNO, but you're absolutely right that it's an interesting concept jumping from one Sprint entity to another. The device can't be active.

Once it's not active, changing the database flag is trivial. All MVNOs are supposed to have access to it (as part of the MVNO API their product development team has), but few do, and some customers get stuck in between tech support teams until someone figures out the ownership flag just needs to be flipped.
What's the name of the reseller?
I bought an LG LUU2100TI from eBay and the darn thing refuses to connect on my Mac. It just says that it's switching to Modem Mode (from USB storage mode, so I could install the software) and just hangs there. 

Garbage support from both AT&T and LG on the matter. I have great service otherwise from AT&T towers. 

I'll never buy an AT&T branded device ever again. The clearly don't care about software support.
It's not a combination. From what I know about Fi's system, the actual activation is done on the T-Mobile side, and there's some software trickery to allow the device on the Sprint side. 

Said trickery is probably super secret, but I wouldn't have put it past the carriers to have gifted it to Google as a trial balloon.
This makes a lot more sense than "I clicked the wrong button."
That's disappointing. Sprint's lock system strikes again!
If I had one to test, I would.
Is this confirmed? I would think it would still recognize the ICCID of the inserted SIM, and report that to the update server over WiFi. You wouldn't get service, but the phone would recognize there's a SIM installed.
A customer posted to our thread lamenting that Sprint (and therefore Ting) has yet to approve NMJ88C, but most other carriers have. Installing a non-Sprint SIM sends the update. Once installed, you can put your SIM back in without having to deactivate it on Sprint.
What are you switching to?
Prior to working for Ting, I worked for Asurion, the coverage provider to the Big Four. It was my job to convince you that you needed coverage. Now that I don't work for them, I'd like to introduce nuance into my sales pitch.

It really boils down to if you think within reason that you'll need a major repair or replacement phone some time inside this phone's lifespan. 

The Big Four offer coverage (as a legal distinction, never 'insurance', as they were clear to point out) at somewhere around $15/month, with lots of the regular small stuff covered for a small or no deductible, and lost/stolen/theft at a higher ([and increasingly higher](https://protection.sprint.com/tep/en/overview.html)) deductible. 

I could not agree with /u/wintercast and /u/aDDnTN more here to invest instead in a case and take extra care. My AmEx card has an extended phone warranty that I understand is part of the cost of owning the card, but that I never intend to use. Instead I buy thicker cases and try like mad not to be careless with how I hold and where I use my phone.

With Asurion, if you never need to file a claim over the life of the phone (say, 2 years), that's a conservative $360 ($15 x 24 months) you could have put into an account with modest interest, and used for repair in the event it does break. With some exceptions, parts are not as expensive as they used to be, and you can be enterprising and attempt to repair your phone yourself using an iFixit guide, or run down to your local repair shop, support the local economy and know that it's done correctly (or, if it's not, then with warranty).

If however, you're someone that regularly breaks their phone, or has it break on you (LG G4 anyone?), coverage might pay for itself after the first claim. Asurion can and will boot you for too many claims, but YMMV depending on the coverage. 

I recommend looking at third-party coverage. The Geek Squad offers third-party coverage for lots of phones, even aftermarket and even when you didn't buy it from Best Buy. AppleCare is available for new devices only (within 30 days of purchase I believe), and SquareTrade also gets high marks, but doesn't cover lost or stolen devices. 

From ST's website:

> You're 10 times more likely to break your phone than lose it or have it stolen, and plans that include loss and theft coverage can cost twice as much as plans that don't. Plus, Apple and Google have free apps like “Find My iPhone” that help you find your phone when you lose it.

tl;dr It's worth looking at if you believe there's a chance you'll need to claim it. If you're like me and likely won't, check your credit card agreement and put $15 extra away in a savings account to be used ONLY if the phone needs repair from a third-party.

DM me with your preferred shirt size and Ting email address. I know you already sent it to me, but do you know how many Reddit messages I get in a day?

Cheers!
Ok.
Sorry, first SIM inserted after replacement, which would have been the TW SIM. The policy applied to the phone in question (see my other comment) is the loaner policy. This, IIRC, is applied when Apple replaces the device. What should have happened is the original Verizon policy should have been moved to the new iPhone.
There's a border crossing between NK and Russia that has some activity. I wonder who that is.
The activation policy was applied at the Apple store, likely when OP got the phone exchanged. It took on the loaner policy, which, IIRC adopts the lock policy of the first SIM inserted. In this case, TW.

In theory, the Apple technician should have made sure when the device was swapped at the Apple store that the original policy was applied. 

TW is highly unlikely to help, unfortunately. This should really be resolved at the Apple store where OP got the phone swapped.

That makes more sense, then. If it wasn't connecting to LTE on Ting, is it doing so on AT&T? Or is it only connecting to 3G?
It's worth noting that dual-SIM phones rarely have CDMA radios, and most dial-SIM phones will have talk/text/data on one SIM, and only talk/text on the other

And yes, two $6 line fees would apply.
What network is the watch connecting to through TruePhone?
So, a bit of a modified hack, if you use it this way. Your setup, then, kind of mirrors mine. 

I send all outbound calls (wifi or data) through Hangouts. I only ever use Ting minutes when someone calls me, which is rare. I rely heavily on data messaging apps like iMessage and Hangouts, which has the added benefit of being able to not give the person my actual phone number. 

In the rare event I do need to give out a phone number, I give out my GVoice number. My neighbors, for example, only have this number. I can filter calls if I need to, but it boils down more to not paying Ting SMS rates to my neighbors when I might need an extended back-and-forth with them on something.

The few times I do break the S buckets for minutes and messages is kind of the whole point of rates growing with your usage. When whatever caused the spike is done, my bill goes back down to normal.
Do you mean out of WiFi range? You can forward all calls and texts through GVoice and use Ting data and still end up at less than 500 MB for the month.
Yes. Full stop. Your phones dialer will connect to any available network to make a 911 call, even with calls disabled in your dashboard.
Props to the Times for excellent graphics.
I don't understand when you say 

> and I am not able to transfer it to a new phone.

On T-Mobile, can't you just move your SIM card to a new phone, effectively locking T-Mobile out of the equation? There's no database to check like there is on Sprint.
It's usually that they're paying for access to a database, rather than actually maintaining a database themselves.

For the S7 and up, it's probably a remote control function where they install some software to bridge the USB over a network connection and unlock your phone by flashing a custom firmware using a [Z3X box.](http://z3x-team.com/)
You can do it just by porting out the active phone number. If you don't need the number, call us at 855-TING-FTW and we'll take care of it for you.
I second this option, short of getting a B12 phone and just running hotspot only when needed, /u/gerryf19.

Cell phone data plans are not designed as a home internet replacement, and if the speeds are as fast as you claim, there's a chance your friend would actually use more data. If the things he wants to load in fact load faster, that's more time he'll have to spend the data on other things.

But if you think he can keep the usage down, the Z915 should work great.
It's worth, then, probably disabling the call and text portions of your line on your dashboard if you decide to come back to Ting. Those spam calls should stop completely.
Extended for a limited time!
I can check its unlock status if you DM me the IMEI.

Aren't there underground sites that deal exclusively with trading GDrive or Dropbox links?
What's your typical data usage in a month?
Yep! Sorry for the delay. 

Your old phone has the following policy: 

`Code: U001 `

`Description: Multi-Mode Unlock `

`ID: 2303 `

`SIM Policy: UNLOCK`

This is an unlocked phone. You need your current phone to have this activation policy in order to work on any carrier other than TW.
Fair point. I think it still has to do with the SKU.
Reddit is a fickle beast.
I can't speak for Tello, but on Sprint, you should be able to update the profile and PRL via WiFI.
Yes. The phone needs to connect to the network to provision. 

You can get around this on WiFi on newer devices. 
Yes. eBay. It makes all the difference in the world. 
That's an open question. If it was originally on Boost, there seems to be a low number of people who actually would stick around for the 12 months required to be eligible for a re-SKU. 

Some (read: most) Sprint MVNOs don't usually care about the SKU as long as the FED has been met, and will allow activation. You can check this at Ting.gom/byod. If you get a good CDMA result, that means FED is in the past and you really do just need tech support to re-SKU if the device is otherwise eligible.

I'll warn you, though; in my experience, it's typically a fruitless venture looking for a re-SKU. You'll need to know a lot of the history of the device and hope it lands on the desk of the right technician.
To clarify, a serial number doesn't get removed from the Sprint database when you activate it on an MVNO. One or more of three things happens when you activate a phone on Boost, especially if it was originally a Sprint phone.

1. Its ownership code gets set at PLBL, instead of SPCS. 

2. The SKU changes to Boost-compatible. 

3. The FED (Financial Eligibility Date) changes to some time in the future. 

Typically, Sprint locks Boost inventory out of being activated on their network via #2. Even if you could clear the others, Sprint won't allow a Boost or VMU SKU to be activated on their network. Sprint tech support (not stores) can file a ticket to "re-SKU" the device. 

Typically, re-SKUs will be denied until the phone has been active on Boost with 12 months of payments to Boost. This is completely permissable under the CTIA/FCC agreement.
K.
I recommend holding on to it on the off-chance either GSM coverage improves, or you get an IoT device you want to connect to 2G service.
Verizon didn't lock your phone. Apple did. Head back to the store where you got the phone swapped out and tell them the replacement has the wrong activation policy.
Can you try the Apple store where the device was replaced? This activation policy really shouldn't have been put on your phone.
I wouldn't. To me, "taxes included" seems like a gimmick. 

In addition to being a lot of work on the back end for very little gain (my taxes in Illinois on 3 lines are rarely above $6), we would have to make up the cost somewhere else and eat telecom taxes levied in different states, effectively penalizing ourselves for having customers in high-tax municipalities. 

We don't charge weird telecom fees, and we regularly eat other costs that some carriers impose just because we think it's the right thing to do.

If the tax burden is so much that $6 in taxes really will make or break a decision to have us or not, I recommend taking advantage of the myriad of credit giveaways we do. Heck, if I was eligible for Cake Day, that's a full quarter of the year in taxes just for posting on Reddit.

[Auto-Tune the news. ](https://youtu.be/1dqTrUpmwPg)
The problem with an executive order is just that-- as soon as Cuomo is out, the agreement can be voided by the next governor, even if that takes a while. New York has no gubernatorial term limit, but Cuomo has aspirations for national office, for sure. 

These protections need to either be legislated or placed as constitutional amendments. Executive orders, as we've seen with the Islam Ban, can more easily be poked at by the courts and invalidated more easily.
So, screw over the probably minimum wage store employee out of an activation and lie to your carrier? That's petty, and it seems like a long way to go for $25 whole dollars. If you can only do it every few months (say, 5), it's a whopping $5 off your bill. 
Thanks! My suspicions are confirmed. When you got your phone replaced and put your TW SIM in the phone, it became locked to TW. 

The activation policy on your phone is:

` Code: S2354 ` 

` Description: US Loaner & Service Picker policy - iPhone 6/6S -  2015/2014`
 
`ID: 2354 `

The good news is, there's something you can do. 

From [here:](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7494615)

> If the Apple Customer Support person you talk to is uninformed of this issue, tell them the phone is not locked according to FCC guidelines and there is no pending contract with any US carrier. What needs to be done is to escalate the case to a Level 2 Support Technician or a Senior Level Advisor who will agree to forward a request to Apple's engineers who can fix it from their side. This is the only way to fix it by getting the "activation policy" corrected by Apple engineers. Email your Apple Customer Care Representative a direct link to this post and it will help you as it has helped others to solve this issue for you.
>
>When properly identified, Apple will tell you that you have "a replacement device with an incorrect activation policy" (which takes 30 minutes to 24 hours for engineers to correct). Sometimes the iPhone needs to be restored after Apple makes the change to the activation policy for the phone, before it will work with an international sim.
>
>Most people who have run into this issue get stuck in a loop where Apple tells them their iPhone is locked to AT&T or Verizon. (Yes, we all know Verizon can not legally lock phones.) AT&T or Verizon will accurately say the phone is not locked to their servers. The result is a frustrated phone owner. Unfortunately many find out only when they get overseas.

Apple can probably fix this for you, if TW support gets you nowhere. The phone you received has the wrong activation policy. Because your phone was replaced at the Apple Store, this should be easy for Apple to look up the receipt, file a ticket to fix the activation policy to either Verizon or multi-mode unlock, and activate on any carrier you want. The policy was applied in error, perhaps by the Apple technician who ordered the replacement. The loaner policy (what is on your phone) should only really be that.
I don't work for TW. I actually work for an MVNO called Ting. You can check my post history for proof.  

I think I can shed a little bit of light on your situation, but I'll need the IMEI. You can DM it to me, and I'll reply in this thread with my findings.
Challenge accepted.
Probably. PM me the IMEI with a link back to this comment.
It can't be fixed. You'll have to replace the display. It's only going to get worse.
Yes. But you'll need Sprint to add it to the database. 

Protip: enter the MEID into ting.com/byod

If you get a good CDMA result, try the Sprint website again.
You cracked the ~~LCD~~ display. You can see the damage in the top left corner. You'll eventually need to replace the display.
This means your phone is not compatible with Sprint. Our BYOD checker uses DNA2 to add a phone to the Sprint database if it's compatible. 

The GSM-only result means you can't activate this phone on Sprint. That'll save you a trip to a store, only to be disappointed. 

Some Verizon iPhone 5's are compatible with Sprint, and can be added to the database using our checker. Yours is not one of these. 
No. The phone's ESN will not be on the whitelist.
They're the same SIM card. They're just made by two different companies. Bothin should work with the E4.
Plug the IMEI into ting.com/byod and paste the message you get in this thread.
Credit is weird like that. I see huge drops (50+ points) in my scores for things like buying a couch (no hard inquiry, just use of available credit) but opening another account had no effect.
Great to hear! Keep us/me posted if it comes back. You can also send an email to help@ting.com.
Fair enough.
Someone did. [It was called Casper.](https://storage.liamcottle.com/casper.io/legal.html)
The phone looks like it's missing Band 4 WCDMA, so you'll not get any 3G coverage. You're correct that we use 2/4/12/71. 

And yes. GSM SIMs are one-time-use. If you intend on keeping the line, you can activate at an time. If you don't intend on keeping it open, I would wait till we have confirmation from T-Mo-proper customers that the iW towers are showing as T-Mo towers.
This may be related. Are you against using a third-party VVM app like Google Voice?

That's excellent news! Do you know what the offending app was?
From the third sentence of my comment:

> Affirm does a soft check on your credit (which won’t affect your credit score)

But I don't know if it opens a line of credit, as I've not used it personally. I do know that Affirm reserves the right to collect on unpaid debt, like all creditors.
I worked for them for 4 years and never got a pair of socks. On googling for them, I'm not sure Sprint socks even exist.
They see no usage as potential fraud. Someone who activates lines but never the phones, submits for unlocks, then sticks Sprint with the bill.
Why? Metro is wholly owned by the MNO.
Do you have your APN settings set for MMS, as well as data? [Ting has two different APNs.](https://help.ting.com/hc/en-us/articles/205428698-GSM-Android-APN-Settings)

Source: I work for /r/ting.
Affirm payments work a whole heck of a lot like PayPal's 'PayPal Credit' feature. 

From [a review of Affirm](https://www.moneyunder30.com/affirm-review):

> Affirm does a soft check on your credit (which won’t affect your credit score) to determine your risk as a borrower, and, if you pass muster, what your interest rate will be. For some borrowers, a down payment may be due at the time of purchase, as they may not be able to approve you for the total amount of your purchase.
>
>At checkout, once you’ve been approved, Affirm will offer you three options, showing you your monthly payments for a three-month term, a six-month term, and a 12-month term. The payments quoted there include everything you will owe, interest included.
>
>Your purchase then goes forward as it usually would, with the company sending you your product or service, and Affirm sending them the money. Affirm will then send you regular reminders of your monthly payments, which start one calendar month from the day your loan is processed.

Your payments to Affirm are completely separate from Ting. If you cancel your Ting account or port out, your payments to Affirm are still in effect. 

BUT, we cover the interest. [From our blog post announcing our partnership:](https://ting.com/blog/how-ting-phone-financing-works/)

> Assuming you qualify for financing under our lending partner Affinity’s terms, Ting will cover the cost of lending. In other words, you can finance a phone up to 24 months with 0% APR financing from Affinity and Ting.

Affirm purchasing isn't available with all devices (requiring a minimum purchase amount, among some other things), but should otherwise look to us like you paid cash for the phone, and as far as we're concerned, you own it. 
Sprint won't allow Ting CDMA ports to be eligible for this deal, as they're already considered Sprint subscribers.
I'm concerned when you say 

> Since she uses it so little, I'd love to switch to the free Sprint plan.

because of the [SlickDeals thread on the deal](https://slickdeals.net/f/10235008-sprint-byod-1-year-unlimited-talk-text-data-free-w-eligible-device-sim-req). In big bright red letters in the wiki post about a quarter of the total way down the page is

> WARNING: IF FREE LINES DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE USAGE ON THEM, SPRINT MAY SUSPEND ALL OPENED LINES AND REQUIRE YOU TO CALL THEIR FRAUD DEPARTMENT. Be sure to use the lines once you open them (unclear how much "usage" is required). 

If the line has no usage, Sprint may cancel it completely and flag it as fraud.
Did it coincide with a software update from OP? I don't believe we changed anything on the network side that would cause this.
[Every Jags fan after the 4th quarter started.](https://media.giphy.com/media/rfABW1T5s8WZO/giphy.gif)
In order to work on Ting GSM for 4G LTE, you want LTE FDD B2, B4, B12 and in some markets, B71. 

For 3G, 1700/2100 AWS is required. 

For 2G, you want GSM 1900. 

[
From GSMArena's specs:](https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_honor_7x-8880.php#l24)

>2G bands	GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900 - SIM 1 & SIM 2

>3G bands	HSDPA 850 / 1700(AWS) / 1900 / 2100

>4G bands	LTE band 2(1900), 4(1700/2100), 5(850), 7(2600), 12(700), 17(700)

So, yes. As long as you get the US version (L24), the Honor 7x should work great on GSM. Be mindful of which version you're buying. The international versions (L21, L22, AL10/TL10) won't have the same frequency support.

Edit: formatting
With the exception of the ones that came in the iPhone 4S and phones like the Motorola Photon. Otherwise, yes. Probably 99% of the SIM cards out there are LTE SIM cards.
This is sometimes related to the Phone app on OP devices. Clear data for the Phone app in Settings, then see if it comes back.
Pooling just makes more sense. I regularly see the criticism of "higher per line but lower overall bill" elsewhere on Reddit regarding Ting, and I'm struck by how long it takes to click in some people's minds. The retort is usually, "well, but I could pay $5 more and get X/Y/Z on Another Mobile." The goal is to not pay $5 more, and understand what your'e actually using.
I'll be a little modest, but it boils down to honesty. We only shipped one package, if I read it correctly. Making it right is important to me, and to Ting.
That makes sense. And that's why the buckets are supposed to grow with you.
Ah. Yeah, the prices for those have stayed pretty consistent, because we haven't gotten a significant enough price break on talk and text from our network providers to be able to drop those. 

But even paying for unlimited, you're not actually paying for unlimited minutes. Unlimited minutes in a month means you're paying a hidden amount for 43,800 minutes. If you don't use them all, you're handing over money to your MVNO and they're pocketing it. I know this sounds insane and impractical, but that's exactly what you're paying for when you buy "unlimited" minutes.

Realistically, your average user probably wouldn't use 3000. I use less than 100, so I pay for less than 100. This is the kind of thinking that makes Ting different from carriers that sell you unlimited you could not possible hope to use.

For reference, my phone bill could be $9 plus taxes if I take steps to route all calls and texts through WiFi. Your usage and needs may be different, but that's why competition exists. If something works better for you, you should use it!
We've debated more buckets, but decided against it. We have 5% graces instead.
>  You could eliminate the Ting voice/text charges almost entirely if it happens to work well with your phones/wifi/cell service.

YES. And it's easier than you think. I started giving out my Google Voice number to businesses and colleagues, and eventually it becomes second nature to give that out instead. 

Now, only close friends and family have my native, personal Ting number. Everyone else gets filtered through GVoice. It only took probably 3 months.
> more value for my money.

I think this is subjective. If you read the blog, we try to point out ways to _not_ pay us for talk or text at all.
And all the IOT devices that only support 2G, not paying LTE licensing fees.
There is a difference. AT&T has not yet shut down their 3G network. T-Mobile, in the other hand, is actively [turning off their 3G.](https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-31961) They're doing this to make way for LTE on the same spectrum.

This means your phone will only get 2G if T-Mobile turns off the 3G frequency your phone uses in your area. It's very sudden. 

A phone's ability to connect to 3G requires that (1) the phone supports it and (2) the tower you're connecting to is still putting it out.

There are no engineers at T-Mobile that could have your phone connect to 3G if the tower is no longer spitting out the connection. 

Newer devices support more frequencies, and T-Mobile is actively encouraging their customers to upgrade to phones that support VoLTE and GSM (2G) for backwards compatibility. 

It doesn't have to do with your SIM. It's the network provider turning off old technology. [AT&T turned off their 2G to make way for LTE](https://www.att.com/esupport/article.html#!/wireless/KM1084805), and uses 3G as a backup. T-Mobile is turning off 3G to make way for LTE and uses 2G as a backup.

More competition is a good thing, and we welcome more companies in the market. 

The market is so massive (300 million plus) that companies can be profitable and not make a blip on the radar of the Big Four, but it's a fine line they tread between profitability and insolvency.
[Here are our rates from 2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20130815074326/ting.com/rates). $24/1GB. We've come a long way.

We offer GSM and CDMA combined billing (which several MVNOs struggle with), but no retails stores. Some of our biggest competition still only allows one line per account. Pooling usage, billing and devices makes a BIG difference for families. It's not for everyone, and some people don't mind different accounts. 

Retail stores would turn us into the kind of store we don't like -- slamming customers with services they don't need. Existing exclusively online with the ability to purchase our [SIM cards at Best Buy](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ting-30-sim-card-kit/6134436.p?skuId=6134436) is a nice medium.

Fi is subsidizing their international usage and "unlimited" talk/text plans (they do pay their network providers per message and minute) from their conglomerate. As soon as Tucows has Google money to throw around, we might launch an unlimited plan that slows you down.

We have no plans to match Fi's $80 'unlimited' plan. We're comfortable with that. 

There are options besides Ting and Consumer Cellular. That's a GOOD thing. We want more competition in this space. More competition forces the network providers to lower their prices, which means we get to lower our costs and lower our customer's bills while maintaining sustainability and promoting growth.
> on to the next one for me

And you're not alone. But I think you're in the minority. Changing cell providers is still a very low priority on lots of lists. Reddit aside, most people won't change carriers every time there's a new deal. [Ting's churn rate is low](https://youtu.be/ZEItwzrAXIw). 

It's a lot of hassle to change, and people will pay for quality of one service, despite the carrier not being 10/10 on every metric. Look at Verizon. For years, they were the biggest and charged the most. It wasn't until the other three started literally paying customers $600 to switch that the playing field started to level. 

As for networks, it's identical to a large percentage of MVNOs because of the network partner wholesale prices. I haven't seen the numbers, but I imagine Verizon's wholesale prices make it a less competitive market on the whole.

As for concern about financials, I would caution you to reconsider. I worked at Sprint when PrePaYd went belly up. Many lost their numbers and had no support arm to remedy that. We don't have that problem.
For WFC, realistically only branded T-Mobile phones are supposed to work with that. If your handset is T-Mo branded, you might need us to update your E911 address. Without it, WFC shouldn't really work at all. 

Updating the E911 address is really dead simple. Chat with an agent at [ting.com/support](https://ting.com/support) and tell them you want to update your E911 address for WiFi calling. Guaranteed the first person you get on the line will know exactly what that means, and can update it for you.

Should that fail to resolve your WFC issues, I have faith they'll find the reason.
You can always get a cheaper service, though. If you're paying more than $0.00, [apparently you're overpaying.](https://support.freedompop.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3119/~/available-plans) 

But we don't really try to compete exclusively on price. We do, especially when it comes to low data users, but we've seen what happens [when you don't build your MVNO to be sustainable.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_mobile_virtual_network_operators#Defunct,_merged_and_acquired_operators) We want to be here in a few years to drop rates again, provide our customer service and kick our stock price into high gear.

If price was always the determining factor in selecting a cell phone provider, why is the fourth-largest cell provider in the country literally [giving away service for free](https://www.sprint.com/en/shop/offers/free-unlimited.html?ECID=vanity:1yearfree), yet still ranks at [number 4 in terms of subscribers](https://www.fiercewireless.com/wireless/how-verizon-at-t-t-mobile-sprint-and-more-stacked-up-q3-2017-top-7-carriers)? Price isn't everything.
We've had healthy competition for years, and we've still seen sustainable growth with our rates. 

We don't try to compete purely on price. If that's the game, it's a losing proposition for most MVNOs against each other and their own partner networks. What we strive for is sustainability, growth and customer service. Our rates reflect that. 

> years later nothing has changed and it is still the same as it ever was.

We've dropped our rates twice in the last 5 years. The most recent drop nearly mirrors data prices on an internet favorite, /r/projectfi.
I'm not saying I disagree, but when you pay for "unlimited" minutes, how many minutes are you actually paying for? If you only use 45 minutes in the whole month (about where I land on the total bill for 3 lines), you're paying quite a bit for each minute. Versus if you use 5000 minutes every month, you're getting the better end of the deal and the MVNO still has to pay their provider.
Can confirm. This guy is a mod at /r/projectfi

Hmm.. what did Tello support say?
I can absolutely help you change the phone ownership flag, but I'm not back at work until Saturday morning. Provided you can wait till Saturday morning, the flag flip takes me all of 15 seconds at most. 

If it can't wait, Sprint tech support should be able to help you out with this, but I can't vouch for their turnaround.
Do you mean on the iPhone specifically, or Android?

On the iPhone, that's managed by Apple and requires the carrier to have a carrier package, among other things.
Which is fascinating to me. I jumped at the $1/1yr VMU deal, even if Sprint can't cover my suburban Chicago house with LTE indoors, because when I'm not blanketed in WiFi, I like to be able to use a little bit of data.

Once the deal is over, though, I probably won't be sticking to Sprint or its brands. Back to Ting with that line!
Try GlassWire from the Play store. It'll break down all your usage, wifi, cellular and by app. Give it a month, and you'll have the best indication of your actual usage.
It has. They must think or know that they're not losing a lot of money by giving away service.
How much data do you use in a month? And what would good CS be worth to you, in a month?

If you think you can save a ton of money, there's something to be mindful of. You'll want to make sure [your phone works](https://ting.com/byod) and which network you want to be on. CDMA is Sprint, GSM is T-Mo.

Using the JRE link will give you $25 total credit. You can apply that to buying a SIM card and the rest toward your first month. 

People do like us. We get overwhelmingly positive responses on Facebook and Twitter. 

Our critics point out two things: The $6 line fee as opposed to our competition who doesn't charge it, and our data pricing. Both regard price. 

We're upfront about our prices. We charge what we charge to stay sustainable, because we want to be here in 5 years. 

If you think the price works for you, go for it! Hit me up here or via /r/ting if you have other questions. It's literally my job to answer them for you.
This reflows the solder temporarily, and is a very common fix for the LG G4. I recommend getting all your data off the phone ASAP and know that one day baking the phone will not work.
The Galaxy S7 Edge. Big screen, good software and custom ROM support, SD card and MicroUSB jack.

It's almost the perfect "last-gen" phone.
Where was it last active?
Keep us posted!
I've been eyeing Westminster or C-ville myself. If I hadn't just bought a house, it would be up for serious debate.
And completely useless for anyone with an apnea mask.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure domestic data subsidizes international data. I don't know how their internal workings are set up, but this makes the most sense to me.
This might be just that. PM me the IMEI and I'll take a look if it's just a ownership code flag. It's really easy to change, if that's all it is.

>  but charge per MB by the cent like they do now.

That would give me anxiety. "Oh, it just cost me $0.45 to catch this Pokemon."
I agree. I do wonder how Fi gets away with international roaming that cheaply.
Fi isn't to blame for the 5x bootloop issue. LG made good on all their LG G4 bootloops, but the warranty denials are reminiscent of when the G4 first started looping. The initial blame went to the end customer, rather than a manufacturing defect. 

I think Google is just stepping up to 'make it right' even though it's a manufacturing defect. 
$10/GB is what's profitable and sustainable right now. I really hope the providers drop their rates.
To clarify, data rates are identical above 1GB for domestic data. We offer service on both Sprint and T-Mobile (your choice) with roaming on Verizon, USCC and AT&T. Service provider and towers are determined by the handset and SIM card you choose, and does not offer the dynamic switching Fi does.

Edit: removed superfluous information not relevant to Fi. 
That's correct. And you were just asking for the best T-Mobile MVNO, not necessarily the cheapest. I'm a little biased, but our Facebook reviews outshine almost every other MVNO out there, and /r/tpo is not nearly the hotbed of information /r/ting is. When looking at "best", you've got to set your metrics.

If you're looking for cheap, TPO is not it. You can get better coverage with FreedomPop. $0 for 200 minutes and 500 text messages on AT&T's network.
International roaming is wickedly expensive. The margins are razor-thin, if there are any margins, for most MVNOs. 

I fear this might be another Google project that gets neglected ever so slightly, and I'm really bummed out about that. I want more competition in this space, but Google has this habit of dropping projects the moment they could be construed as non-profitable.
Another vote and shameless plug for my employer, /r/ting. 

It's $6 for the device, $3 for 100 minutes and $3 for 100 texts. $12/month + taxes with customer support. You can disable data completely. If this is for someone who is not super tech-inclined, they'll appreciate that. 

Grab a referral link from someone at /r/ting or use [my team's code](https://get25off.ting.com) for $25 off the first bill. At $12/month, that's 2 months for next to nothing.

It's worth noting that if you're using the Nokia 3310 released last year, that doesn't have 4G coverage. It'll only get coverage on the 2G GSM network, and 3G where available. Our GSM provider is actively turning off their 3G network to re-farm for 4G.

If you have questions, that's what I'm here for.
You'd think so, wouldn't you? There's not a huge incentive for the network providers to drop the rates. 

I have this feeling Fi domestic rates are subsidizing their international data rates.
Unknown. Check samsung.com.
You typically need to, at least in Samsung and iPhone releases, wait two years between releases to make it worth the upgrade.
Yes. This is why Metro gets higher priority.
This is likely a save offer, then. If they can get you to sign up for that rate plan, you're less likely to leave than someone who has a higher-priced plan but has device payments.

Oh hey! /u/minnesota420, you can DM me the IMEI safely. I work for Ting and the only thing I would want to do is help you get it active. 

I'll probably be able to tell you why Sprint is less-than-helpful, too.
I don't think I'll end up selling. I'll trade mine into Samsung for whatever special fun deal they have when you trade in a Samsung for their latest thing. 

I'm waiting for $400 off the S9 when you trade in an S7E. That'll be my trigger point to get rid of it.

But yes, the prices will start falling the instant we get a solid look at the S9.

> $20 for minutes and texts, of which I use zero of both? No thanks.

This is a sticking point with Fi customers who end up coming over to Ting. $6 vs $20, especially if you're versed in Hangouts and Google Voice makes such a difference.
It gets the juices flowing.
And every agreement is different. Their price might be based on the number of subscribers they have. If they get more subscribers, they can negotiate a better rate with the network partners.

> $10/GB for data is still obscene, and out of line with network costs.

From the Big Four on their native network, yes. But not if Fi wants to turn a profit on what their network partners charge them.
> That doesn't prevent me from stating that it's unreasonable that they charge that much.

From a consumer standpoint, and where Fi looks to take its customers from most, $10/GB is not unreasonable. In order to make a clear comparison, we need to determine 2 things:

1. What the industry (consumers) values for functionally unlimited talk and text. This is usually understood to be somewhere around $20. 

2. What each carrier charges for 1GB sent over their network. This one is hard to quantify on the Big Four, as they have 'unlimited' plans. Is 51GB technically unlimited? If so, T-Mobile charges ~$1/GB ($70 - $20 for talk/text) and anything above that should be considered unreasonable.

But they charge WAY more than $1/GB to their MVNOs and partners.
> why is data still $10/GB in 2018

It has to do with their volume agreements with their network partners, probably. The partners charge them for data usage based on their agreement. If they can't get a better agreement, then they don't drop their prices. 

The carriers that offer unlimited or "unlimited" do so at their own peril. The ones that slow you down do so to encourage you to use less data. They still pay for every kilobyte at 2G speeds, but you're less likely to use more than a few megabytes at that speed. This preserves their margin on the prices they charged you. 

The margins on data are not huge, despite every MVNO and their mother trying to compete on price for the most data. [We've seen what happens when your prices are too low.](https://www.prepaidphonenews.com/2017/02/sprint-threatening-to-shut-ringplus.html) In order for the business to turn a profit, hire people and sustain subscriber growth, they need to set a data price that reflects that. $10/GB is a good metric.

Also, this is almost for sure a targeted offer based on something on your account. A price like this probably means you don't have any device payments attached to your account, am I right?
They run on the same partner network. In the unlikely event the tower is congested, MetroPCS allegedly gets higher priority.

Every Ting town is unique different. We have turn-key operations, leased networks, and a from-the-ground-up network being built as we speak. If we had to build every network from the ground up, we would be moving really slowly in all towns, rather than the growth we see now.
Understood. It's not like we don't want to expand; we do. It's that expansion isn't just us wanting to do it. We need permission from the city (per the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984), residents to pre-order and access to either the utility poles, [the public right-of-way or utility easement.](https://www.lenexa.com/UserFiles/Servers/Server_4323159/Image/Government/Departments/CommDev/Right-of-Way_diagram.jpg)

[This says](https://decisiondata.org/tv-internet-by-city/sacramento-ca-internet/) the fastest speed available in Sacramento is 100 Mbps. Is that real?
It's not just municipal ISPs they're attempting to keep down. Bigger cities are more likely to have utility pole issues or getting permission from the city under the [Cable Communications Act of 1984.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_Communications_Policy_Act_of_1984)

The act gave municipalities, governing bodies of cities and towns, principal authority to grant and renew franchise licenses for cable operations.

As much a private company like my employer, Ting, would like to dive in and ask questions later, we really need to feel that the city, its permitting offices and its residents are all on board with us digging up and building the utility before we make the decision to move into a town. And we do need business and residential customers to actually buy the product once we have it in place.

This kind of stuff is why Google Fiber threw their hands in the air and halted all expansion of their service.
Can confirm Westminster, Maryland has [symmetrical gigabit fiber.](https://ting.com/internet/town/westminster) 

The best way to get us to come to your town is to [submit your interest](https://ting.com/internet/townvote) and lobby your city council. The fewer barriers to entry there are to us coming in, the more likely we are to put forth the effort. 

If Comcast has a hold on your town's utility poles, it's going to be a lot harder for us to lay down fiber. Lobbying them or getting elected to your city council is the only way to help make that change, even if it's going to be municipal and not Ting.
Symmetrical gigabit is special. Lots of fiber companies forget about upload speeds. We think it's too important to forget.

Hey guys, we're expanding our monthly #TingIt contest, and there's something special in it for you! 

If you're not familiar, #TingIt is our monthly contest on social media where we give away $100 in Ting credit every month to a lucky poster or two who puts their Ting sticker somewhere awesome or interesting, then posts on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook with the hashtag #TingIt. Previous winners include a [rock-climbing helmet](https://www.instagram.com/p/BbfkyM7lWaR/?tagged=tingit), [a goat](https://www.instagram.com/p/BUXQw6ODNvi/?tagged=tingit), and my personal favorite, [a Super Mario Brothers fish tank](https://www.instagram.com/p/BM_rrCGDNei/?tagged=tingit).

The contest is open to all current Ting customers in the US, and all you need to do is click on the link to get a sticker sent to you, stick it somewhere and post it with the hashtag #TingIt. We select winners for the calendar month on the first few days of the following month.

Make sure your post stands out. Check out #TingIt on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/tingit/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tingit&src=typd) for ideas. Be mindful of where you put your stickers; you want your entry to stand out above the crowd.

In addition to the #TingIt contest, we're going to make a banner we can use on Reddit, Facebook and Twitter of some of the best #TingIt posts from you guys. If we use yours, you'll score $15 in Ting credit. 

This contest is ON TOP of all our other giveaways, [Cake Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/ting/comments/6xf0pz/comment_on_your_cake_day_and_pick_up_20_in_ting/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=ting) and referral credits. 

**To enter to be included in the banner, leave a link in the comments below with your image.** If you're chosen, someone from the social team will reach out and ask for your Ting email address.

Good luck!
Well darn. I think I can still send some socks. DM me your name and shipping address.

Verizon Prepad added letters to their account numbers. Most systems aren't designed to accept letters in the account number field. 

Ting fixed it, but once we noticed and didn't get have a fix, our temporary workaround was to submit it wrong, then change it after VPP denied the request.
Your latency is always going to suffer if you're trying to use cell phone networks for gaming. You'll lag all the time and it's no fault of anyone except how the technology is designed. 

The current no-contract plans are also not super suited to your use case. You'd either rack up overages, run out of high-speed data really quickly, or have your service stop in the middle of a game. 

You need fixed fiber or copper to get the best gaming experience.

As always, you can check Ting status (including the website, all Fiber networks and mobile at tingstatus.com
By SMS addresses do you mean [10-digit phone number]@tmomail.net, or any of the others listed [here](http://sms411.net/how-to-send-email-to-a-phone/)? 

These are just email addresses that forward to the phone number as a text message. There's nothing fun or special about them, and with the advent of smartphones, they're way less necessary than they used to be. 

Or are you talking about something else?
This is why we're up-front about /r/ting. All the mods are employees, and the creator of the sub is still a customer (I think) but has relinquished control to the company itself. 

We don't really have a 'need' for an alternate sub.
I'm sure none of them would show hide nor hair in /r/Sprint. There's no benefit.
Is there assumed to be profit in the save plans?
For reference, what's the point of promos expiring if save plans are fabulous?
Some plans will be going up by as much as 100% of their current cost. Sheesh.

Sprint needs a retention deal like now. Their best retention deal ever had to be $120/40GB/waived access back when the first round of FSP promos expired.

I think the SKU would confuse a majority of customers, especially as it's only really a "thing" on CDMA customers' phones. What else would you use the SKU for?

I've run the MEID that OP provided and there's literally nothing I can see preventing it, and it clears all hurdles to activate on Ting.
I've got to be up-front with the employer, because on some subs (present company included), I can't set a custom flair to report that. 

I don't think this device was from FP originally. I think the original owner bought it from R+. There's no SKU restrictions and the database flag is set correctly. Only FP tech support can answer why it's not activating, and OP has tried that with little success.
[Google Fiber has stopped forward expansion into new cities](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/10/google-fiber-laying-off-9-of-staff-will-pause-plans-for-10-cities/) because of the lawsuits.
Work for ISP. Can confirm.
This is how it works now. Conglomerate vs. Conglomerate. We just have to hope "our" side gets traction.
Yes, but the actual device lock is not something monitored by Sprint. 

I had my LG G4 DSU'ed a few months ago, and it would not apply on the device. Everything Sprint could see said that the unlock had been approved, and it showed as unlocked. I verified with an employee I used to work with. The device simply would not apply the unlock through the "UICC Unlock" menu option. 

I gave up and sold it as locked to Sprint. Still got a fair price for it.
I work for Ting. This device in question is not attached to an account in any way. OP and I have been in contact, and I suggested the sub as a means for tech support, because it's clear on our end to activate on any MVNO or Sprint itself. The SPCS/PLBL flag is set to SPCS, but OP tried activating with FPop when it was PLBL with no luck.
Pursuing it with this FCC may not be super fruitful.
Maybe this is a disconnect between actual unlock status and the FED flag on Sprint's side. The Ting BYOD checker only checks the FED flag with Sprint, not the device itself.
Don't go to a corporate store. They cannot help you. I say this as someone who worked in a corporate store until May of this past year.

Marci might be a good target for this, but I feel the issue is larger than what she has control over.
> My advice is to go into an actual Sprint store 

This is bad advice. The store is not equipped nor able to help with unlock requests, and it will just waste OP and the store employee's time.

> If you go to the store they'll be more more likely to help you because you're there in person,

On the contrary, and per my years of Sprint store retail experience, they will not be more likely to help. They'll put OP on the phone with tech support in the back of the store and hope the tech gets OP a resolution in a timely manner that will not cause a scene.
Hey OP, I don't work for Sprint. I work for /r/ting, a Sprint MVNO. 

You are not alone. I've got a list of at least 5 devices in front of me with the exact same problem. 

You can confirm this is the same problem I'm seeing if you run the IMEI through ting.com/byod. If that comes up with a message that says Sprint tells us it hasn't been paid for yet, you're in the same boat as all these devices and customers. 

My running theory (not officially /r/ting or /r/sprint in anyway) is that the devices did initially ship unlocked (like the Nexus 6 did), but because of rampant abuse, they started shipping them locked, as /u/kitnb points out. 

It's likely the devices were flagged on some sort of "cannot unlock" list to prevent resale fraud, which is absolutely a thing.

I'm not condoning the process (all GSM and multi-network devices sold by my employer are already unlocked), but I understand it as a fraud prevention measure. There should be a process to escalate, so please let us know if you get a resolution.
I clicked on this link saying "in theory vs in practice", and you already covered it. Great minds think alike.
You're welcome! It helps me do my job better, and sometimes I catch  a bug before the MVNO does, like when Fi had GSM reporting issues. We knew about it pretty quick, before anyone from Fi reported anything to Reddit.
WFC requires more than just an MVNO wanting to do it. There's lots of back-end stuff that goes on with the network provider, as well as provisioning and servers to actually route the calls.

I spend lots of time on carrier and carrier-agnostic subs to help people out and gather useful troubleshooting information.

I have mine set to have people call my Google Voice number. But I give that number out to businesses and professional contacts. Only my personal contacts (friends and family) have my native Ting phone number. I only burn incoming Ting minutes on people I actually want to talk to.

Even with this setup, though, I can tell the incoming caller that I'll call them back shortly, then call from Hangouts. It still appears to come from my number, but I'm not paying for the minutes.
[Yes, but that requires Google Voice.](https://support.google.com/hangouts/answer/6023920?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&hl=en) This is how I have mine set up.
A Google voice number helps, but is not required. I haven't done the setup in a while, but IIRC it comes from an unknown number unless you have a Gvoice number and verify your existing phone number. I can roll through setup here again to verify.

If there is, I haven't found it. And I've been looking. 

There are several small Android phones out there, but their performance is sadly lacking. The SE (my current work phone) is by far my favorite due exactly to its size, and nothing comes even close in terms of performance-versus-size in the Android world.

> Think Reddit is anonymous?

No, not really.
To build on this, we actually used to do a version of what you asked. Back in the long-long ago you selected a Ting plan of what you thought you would use in a month. 

At the end of the month, we would settle up. If you used more, we took more money. If you used less, we refunded you. 

This was all kinds of complicated to explain, but some MVNOs still use it ("money back from your cell phone carrier? WHAT?!") as a marketing technique. When we did away with it, the [VP of marketing noted](https://ting.com/blog/ting-has-eliminated-plans/) that some people were ahead of the curve, picking the smallest plans every time and just settling up at the end. 

Postpaid makes more sense, because we're not holding on to your money (in case we have to give some back) and we know exactly how much you'll need to pay only AFTER the whole month has gone by.
This sounds like something [AllCast Receiver](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.koushikdutta.cast.receiver&hl=en) can do, but I haven't used AllCast or AllCast Receiver in over a year. 
1 BTC = 1 BTC. This is the kind of logic you'd see over at /r/buttcoin. 
Is there a reason there can't be WiFi on the device?
Yeah, either one should work great. But make sure you either confirm with Swappa that the ESN check is getting a good result for CDMA, or ask the seller to run it through the BYOD checker and confirm CDMA compatibility and FED check.
I think right now, the Moto G5+ is one of the best options out there. 

Realistically, though, you would be better off getting a [secondhand Galaxy S7 from Swappa.](https://swappa.com/buy/samsung-galaxy-s7) Swappa already runs the Ting check and has protections in place if the seller misrepresents what they're selling you. 

The S7 is almost the same phone as the S7 Edge, which is my regular phone. It's already served me pretty well. But, the S7E has admittedly a larger screen, which is something you said you wanted to avoid. 

The camera is awesome, the Sprint and Unlocked models work great on CDMA (avoid the "unlocked flashed" models, as they very likely don't work on Sprint due to the whitelist), it has an SD slot and with a solid case will serve you as well as or better than your S4.
I don't think what you're looking for exists. 

The closest I think you could get would be a custom ROM on the BlackBerry KeyONE. The Custom ROM would have to have the ability to remove WiFi drivers. 

Someone on xda _might_ write it for you if you're not technically-inclined to disable WiFi yourself, but [there is no development for the KeyONE.](https://forum.xda-developers.com/blackberry-keyone/development). Nothing. There's not even a root for the KeyONE.

Another option would be to get the KeyONE (seriously the best full QWERTY out there) and install some MDM on it. [You can disable the user's ability to control WiFi with MDM.](https://www.manageengine.com/mobile-device-management/help/profile_management/android/mdm_android_restrictions.html)
I'm not even concerned about the controlling part. OP wants a full QWERTY device (niche) that is a smartphone without WiFi (super-niche). I doubt it exists. 
I've responded to your PM. Let me know if that worked.
That means Sprint thinks the phone is not yet paid off. I would avoid it until it comes up without that message.
Why can it not have Wi-Fi? Couldn't the radio be disabled, regardless of device?
It should be clarified that you can renew, but not at the promo pricing. You'll renew at regular pricing. It's still pretty good, but the longer you buy, the better the discount.
From what I gathered in training (gift cards came and went before I joined the team), relatively few people took us up on the offer, and the resources dedicated to making it work were better spent elsewhere.
> Was there a little flirting while you were in the store?

I recommend getting the Moto E4 from Wal-Mart, specifically the Verizon Prepaid model. It should be $39.88. 

Go on eBay and find an unlock code before you turn the device on. Buy, and submit imei. 

With the unlock code in-hand, open the box, take out the Verizon SIM, put the Ting SIM in, and enter the code given by the eBay seller. 

I did this for my E4. It gets 2/4/12 for 4G on Ting, which is good enough for now. It’s not future-proof, but it’ll last a good few years for $40. 

The only drawback is the constant undismisable notification about the SIM card not being from Verizon.
I work for Ting. You don’t want a Sprint phone unless you’re comfortable switching her to CDMA. Not a huge deal, but if she’s already on GSM, it’s worth trying to find a compatible phone to reduce the steps required to get her active.
I'll get back to you on Saturday.
Yeah, I try like hell not to do loyalty cards. I'd almost rather pay more than feed the machine with my data. I actively ask other people in line if they'd like my reward points if I can use their phone number.
This is exactly why I returned my Ecobee 4. It has Alexa built-in. I was uncomfortable with it listening all the time. Returned it and went with the 3 Lite, with no always-on microphone.
Speaking from experience repairing the Galaxy S7, this is probably correct. 

Camera modules are relatively cheap, OP. You'll just need someone to install it for you.
No, you don't need to bother. Your credit should be applied on the back end after you activate the SIM.
Nothing to note. We had a user do [a little bit of testing with not-great results.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ting/comments/6qztre/do_i_need_a_ting_sim_card/dl6hy33/?context=10000)

You'll probably get 2G talk/text service, but data is a YMMV. If you'd like to get a GSM SIM and test it out in Iowa, I'd be happy to provide credit for network insight. I live too far from the Iowa border to make the trip worth it unless I'm already heading out that way.
Crazy that they made them that late.
:D

/u/osskid, you can send me a PM with the IMEI and a link back to this comment. I'm off at 8p Eastern, though, so if you're not able to get to me before then, I'll get you back on Saturday.

~~I think they stopped making them in March or April, because the G5 was out by than and it's easier to send one of those.~~

Apparently they made them into 2017. The only question is WHY.

And that's just one reddit thread. Imagine the public as a whole, who doesn't use Reddit.
This is what we heard about the bootloop issue -- that it didn't affect anything after 510. This was demonstrably false.
I use RH exclusively for stocks. My company uses The Standard for 401(k) and other investments.
It depends on the carrier.

If you're going to roll your stock into RobinHood, I recommend doing so sooner rather than later. RobinHood is covering transaction fees for transfers. 

I've used RH for a few months buying and selling my modest portfolio, and once I saw how much Fidelity was charging me per transaction, it was a no-brainer to transfer everything.

And if you wouldn't mind using my referral link when you sign up, we both get one free share of stock if you do. Link here: http://share.robinhood.com/mitches243
Glad we could [cheer you up!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7rCyll5AeY) Drop me a PM with yoru Ting email address and I'll apply the cake day credit to your account.
Soon^TM
Bfh? Bfhf!
Probably like a lot of other retail sales jobs -- soul-crushing some months, and really rewarding and gainful others.
It makes sense if there isn't. There would otherwise be no incentive for you to upgrade and pay for unnecessary data.
I know what you mean. But "free" isn't sustainable as a business model. Even FreedomPop charges fees for things like turning off AutoPay.

Disclaimer: I work for Ting.
The last time something like this was posted, it was some weird meet-kids-online game. 

If you post a cropped screenshot, we can do the Reddit detective thing and figure it out.
I can speak a little bit from the inside on this. They still pay their provider for the minutes used, if you use 1 or 5000. They set a limit where they want to cut you off, so they're still profitable from you at the end of the month. 

They call it unlimited, because they figure very few will actually reach that profitability threshold they've set, and it's effectively unlimited, then.
If this were prepaid, yes. But this is postpaid. It's still 30 rolling days of service, or whatever it is, but they collect 3 days earlier.
The squeaky wheel principal wins again.
Must be nice up there.
Slowly? We barely got rid of 2YA, and T-Mobile's "one-line-unlimited everything" is still $70. Sprint's old EDS was like $83 after taxes and came with a two-year price on a phone.
It's an internal thing. They can override eligibility in some cases. Something on your account is making them unable to make it eligible.
Then we might need to do some deeper digging. Send an email to help@ting.com so one of our advisors can troubleshoot.
You've got the `dun` option set in your Data APN, right?
I've sent you a DM to confirm some things. 
If the serial number gets a positive CDMA result at ting.com/byod, you can activate it on Ting to play around. $6 for the device, plus data. The lowest data tier is $3/100MB.
Thanks! And I found your problem. 

You're trying to use a GSM SIM card in a CDMA phone. You'll want a CDMA SIM card if you want to activate that S6E+ on CDMA. Do you want me to ship one out to you?
That's the design of the speed test, not of the network provider. Once they have a useful metric, there's no need to use additional data.

I used to do it for a living (through Asurion). 

The key is patience and heat. You shouldn't have to touch the screen if you're doing it correctly. 

- Even heat across the entire back, remove the back glass

- Remove all screws (#00 screwdriver) AND your SIM card slot 

- Press down on exposed battery and peel back the frame from the home button side. No NOT put anything between the frame and screen. Heat and pressure should be enough. 

- Once the housing is off, remove the battery connection with a plastic stick. Even heat on the SIDES of the battery, and peel it up from the bottom. The display should stay FLAT on the table or work surface. Do not lift it. You will break the screen.

- Once both battery strips are separated from the frame and battery, install your new battery and work backwards. 
HFA does all the provisioning when you're trying to activate on CDMA. It sets all the APNs for you and gives your phone the programming it needs to connect to the Sprint network. 

If you're trying to activate on CDMA, you're doing harm to your progress if/when you change APNs, because you'll only manually set APNs while you're trying to activate on GSM. 

I want to check the SIM card number you're trying to activate with, to verify it can even activate on CDMA.
So you wouldn't set APN settings at all. Doing so would cause problems. 

Can you DM me the email address on your Ting account, so I can verify we're doing everything correctly?
Are you trying to activate on GSM or CDMA?
Are you concerned about the amount of data used? Or the speed at which it uploads?
I'm not sure I follow you -- when you run a speed test, your connection should be unaffected completely on either network. 
I don't think this was emphasized enough in your post. 

> # Yes.
Yes. While [2G is on its way out](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/17/att-shuts-down-2g-network/), our GSM provider still has it for backwards compatibility. 

The GSM provider is actively shutting down 3G, and the 2G network is kept up on the smallest band of spectrum exclusively for backwards compatibility for phones that do not have VoLTE and live in an area where U1900 [has been shut down.](https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-31961)
It depends on if you're trying to activate it on CDMA or GSM. Do you know which one you're trying?

On CDMA, you would not need to set APN settings at all. All the provisioning is set in the Handsfree Activation process. You can force this process by dialing \# # 7 2 7 8 6 #. 

Your phone will prompt you to erase network settings, reboot and do a HFA on reboot.

On GSM, your phone will need to have both the Ting Data and Ting MMS APNs set, but with the Ting Data APN selected (not the Ting MMS APN. That gets selected automatically). From there, you'll need to make sure your phone is set to LTE/UMTS/GSM mode. Automatic might have it defer to the CDMA settings. 

If all that fails, try using a third-party app like Textra. It tends to be able to bypass some network-level restrictions with some old workarounds (including MMS over WiFi --- weird, wild stuff!) and is overall a very nice text message replacement app.
How many tiers would there be? Full speed, half speed and dial-up? This adds complexity when the limiting factor might be the tower. Suppose you're connected to a slow tower, and the throttle makes it unusable. I'd prefer to give data as an allowance to be spent as they see fir.
What's your budget? You can pick up the M5 card phone on eBay for $15.
Across three lines, it's typically under 3GB. GlassWire helps a lot, as does being a subscriber of a CableWiFi alliance member (Comcast).
AT&T is 2, 4, 5, 12, 17

Verizon is 2, 4, 13

T-Mobile is 2, 4, 12, 66, 71

Sprint is 25, 26, 41. 

Based on what you've got, you _might_ get LTE on AT&T (or an MVNO like Cricket) on one frequency they don't use everywhere. 

My recommendation is to get a different phone if LTE is important to you.
No mentions yet of GlassWire. You can set custom caps and see detailed usage, and you can exclude zero-rated apps. 

Ting did a breakdown [here](https://ting.com/blog/glasswire-app/).

No VPN required, better privacy policy than Datally.
What's the request number? I'll DM you with what I find out.
You'd usually get the "You do not have access to this request" message if you're trying to sign in to a ticket with an email address different than the one that made the ticket. 

We do use SSO, though. Try signing out of your Google account at google.com before you click SIGN IN at the upper-right corner, and sign in with your Ting username and password.
If the sales rep feeds you the line that you need "permission from corporate" to buy outright, you get something from them so they can't use that excuse anymore.
I believe it's 3 months it has to be active.
