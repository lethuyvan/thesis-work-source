The thing is, Linis is completely right here. He leads one of the most successful open source projects humanity has ever embarked on. Without Linux I doubt the internet would even be a possibility. And sure, people can argue his comments may alter somebody submitting  that patch, but history has shown even with his approach to communication this has lead to a _very_ stable product.

What people _should_ be doing is freaking the fuck out when Linus retires or dies. Too many projects are lead by several layers of bullshit, hence why the TSB fiasco happened. There are not many Linus Torvalds in the world. Not even Greg KH, the current LTS maintainer, has the same direct attitude which you may think is 'fine', but Linus has for sure been the responsibility of ensuring a software project that's relied on by the world (and yes, a kernel panic can lead to human fatalities and has done many times already I am sure).

So yeah, to the people who care about this stuff, great. Go work with likeminded people. But not everyone has to believe yours is the only way things can work, because that's not true.

Thanks for posting that youtube video, I've been watching some of the historical talks to get his take on things and this was one I've seen but never bothered to watch. Very insightful. 
A new new internet.
ICANN are also not compliant with the GDPR, and they've disgracefully asked for an extra year to sort the mess out, even though they've had 2 years.

I wouldn't be sad if ICANN went away tomorrow. In fact, the internet would be better off.
> women, people of color, and others in marginalized groups

Easy: remove the concept of 'genders' altogether. Stackoverflow doesn't need to care if you're a man, women, alien or zuckerbot, all they should care about is the question and answer.

I've _never ever ever_ thought of the answers on SO as 'people', I just assume a _thing_ contributed that answer at some point, I couldn't care less who/what posted it there.

In the same way, I do not care about who/what posts reddit comments, I can't tell who/what you are based on your username, and there are no avatars or other gender/group/special interest revealing here :)
Doesn't take away from the fact there are defined processes that were clearly violated here, and that these lawyers are going to have a field day on this case.

Between this or the TSB fuckup, I can't decide which is worse.
Make no mistake, this is no "theft", this is an _actual_ theft plain and simple, it being a digital good makes no odd. France can't just say "this car is ours, give us the keys", and the dealership/garage just hands them over, in the 'physical' world giving an object to somebody like that would be madness.

Let's not trivialise this because it's digital: this is theft, they have stolen this domain and should not only give it back, but also a fine for each day's worth of income lost.
Please don't, donate it to charity instead, an actual, worthwhile, cause :)

Good work discovering this stuff, seems Reddit has more tracking than even I was aware of. Bet they don't disclose this in plain english anywhere.

[Here](https://www.redditstatic.com/reddit.en.Y64Sg2dUcbw.js) is the file we are talking about.

They even track if you're using tor/VPN line 7298:

Right - the concern here is that it's _impossible_ to figure out what all the key/value pairs mean. They are so random that if you can figure what this:

means I'll give you reddit gold for life :P
These go under 'my filters' in uBlock Origin. Other software many vary what they call it.
[here](https://i.imgur.com/iZBGQId.png) is a censored payload - most of the data is unreable, things like this:

{1: {str: "DduerDovxD828DI"}

which doesn't even mean anything to you or I, so we cannot be sure what is being transmitted to HQ.

Purpose? Tracking, probably.
Well, I pointed out a month ago reddit was sending data via its APIs, which are only blockable if you want to disable commenting, upvoting and basically the essential sites features.

Now, they are sending the same data via reddit.com which is basically unblockable, since they are POSTing directly to https://reddit.com.


> Humans are not created to solve a specific problem

As a human, how can you be so sure what the greater purpose of life may be? Perhaps we were put here by a far distant planet and our eventual goal is to spread ourselves across the solar system. Okay that sounds absurd, but we barely know enough about ourselves or the universe around us to know _why_ we're here or _how_ we found ourselves in the situation we're in after _billions_ of years. (this is why we're building a massive telescope in the form of James Webb to find out more about our universe!)

Who knows what may have really happened all that time ago, it's possible other planets with life have existed, it'd be arrogant to think we're the only life form capable of conscious thought to have ever existed. 
I think the emoji situation is really hilarious. Imagine if you could just change the english language because 'words' incite violence. And just changing a word in the dictionary and everyone else just has to accept that change.

Emoji's are stupid, it should be like words, where they are _identical_ across every platform, and where political correctness doesn't get in the way.
>  Difference is while we're solving those problems, people won't be dying.

Yes they will - we cannot house, bathe and feed _every_ human on earth as it stands _today_. In fact, WHO says there are [2.1 billion humans without safe drinking water](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/water-sanitation-hygiene/en/). What compromises are you willing to make for the sake of keeping possibly tens of billions more humans alive? The potential for conflict is _huge_ and even though we're fine _today_ it won't take much for violence to happen.

We would only end death by old age once we're ready to do so - anything less than housing, feeding and bathing _all_ humans on earth and making homelessness _impossible_ for _any human_ would not allow the cure to be released.

Unless you like the idea of a complete anarchy storyline, which might be entertaining for some, but would rapidly descend into chaos.

Fixing our problems _first_ then releasing the cure after would give us more motivation to get our shit together first :) 
I agree - but let's do that _before_ we decide nobody should ever die again. We'd need to think about whether we eradicate death _for good_, whether people can die of their own accord, and how we compensate for the eventual 20 billion plus people that will eventually be wondering the streets; if you thought 1 hour of traffic was bad, how about 10+, we'd need to build an entirely new civilisation to cope.

We can _barely_ cope as it is - sure, we may not be in a global conflict but it's not like life is cozy for most humans, in fact, for a large number of people it's miserable: I guess you're lucky that's not you?
> That's also A LOT more people to feed and house. 

This this this. I'm so glad I found this comment. The only thing that bothers me is that whilst the cure for aging might be exciting for some, _right now_ for the first time in _human history_ we are living with 7 _billion_ humans. Add all the animals and other life and that's a whole lot of organisms. We've had to adapt _fast_ to this change; computers, smartphones and technology in general are _essential_ to serve such a huge amount of people; could you imagine standing in line at your bank vs clicking a few buttons to achieve the same effect?

We're not even close to being ready to live in a world where people don't die, there are already problems with homelessness, and people are always moaning 'their' wages are too low. Well guess what? The more people = more food and resources they need = less for _you_.

If, for every new human that was born you lost $0.0001 that's $10 per 100,000 people, would that be acceptable? Because those people also need the same money you're using, and they need to eat food, be housed and bathe as is required in modern society.

So yeah, this obsession is really a product of the human mind: it's hard to comprehend that we will one day return to the state before we were born, only _after_ experiencing life. It's cruel, and ideally we'd keep the reaper at bay.

_But it's essential_.
I'm saddened he got a free drive, although I can understand why, I'd have loved the manager to say 'this is what you requested this is what you got'.

These people need bringing down a few pegs and to be taught the hard way; you respect people or you'll be the one left red faced.

Good job OP, taught that guy a lesson :)
Nothing surprising here, people value the prospect of getting updates but nobody is actually verifying what updates they're getting, heck, they could just include a 20mb text file and the average user wouldn't think anything more of it.

Androids permission system is more dangerous imo, just tap yes to contacts and other people's data gets sucked up to services free of charge, rather than warning the user this data will be abused without the other person's consent.
I suspect they're already using this in America to track who comes into their country - get a picture and use Facebook, Google and others to feed info into a system that can automatically flag whether you're a suspicious individual. Nothing new or surprising here.

So when people are outraged that they want your social media profiles; they already have them.
There used to be a time where _opening_ a hyperlink didn't use to data rape users for all the data they can possibly get - reddit uses google analytics and amazon, as well as their own stats.redditmedia.com. So if somebody sends me a link there's several entities right there that I did not consent to collecting my data.

Heck, even if you're a guest and click a link here's the URL you get:

https://out.reddit.com/t3_8bicsf?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2018%2Fapr%2F11%2Fargentinian-police-officers-dismissed-after-claiming-mice-ate-marijuana%3FCMP%3Dtwt_gu&token=AQAA157OWlK_SYDhYM_jeneAv--U7umou9XxjOOlJTjXnxei6r1y&app_name=reddit.com

So Reddit can still store your IP for every action you make or URL you visit, notice he only mentioned 'access Reddit', which isn't very specific.

Fortunately, the EU recognised this and online services will have to abide by this new regulation since 'not using a website' is not an acceptable excuse for not putting privacy first - you could also just 'not use the internet' but even then, you're never safe anywhere with Big Brother watching (literally see china's social credit system).
I personally thing Spez is being _incredibly_ disingenuous here. Previously, you could use an ad/script blocker (which they track if you block ads) to stop their tracking _altogether_. Now, the _only_ way to stop Reddit tracking you is to block the endpoints that allow you to upvote/downvote, delete comments, post comments. 

> We haven't made any significant changes to our tracking in the last year beyond updating our endpoints to avoid site-breaking changes by ad-blockers (though not to block ad-blockers themselves).

This is total nonsense - I used the very adblocker that was supposed to be a problem (ublock origin) and I _never_ had a problem utilising the sites features. In fact, if you check [here](https://github.com/ryanbr/fanboy-adblock/commit/60a4a73cf177b26ab54f746e992d40d3ba867c5e) you can see Reddit's endpoints were given an exception so as to NOT break critical functionality - how convinent an adblocker exempts the API then Reddit stuffs its tracking behind it.

Even the GDPR says this:

> Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them.

And the tracking I have highlighted can for sure be tied to an individual if you combined it with other data advertisers/trackers may have on you. Even your User Agent can reveal what device/browser you're using which can (combined with other data) deanonymize you.
Care to explain [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopadvertising/comments/87d1sq)
I find it ironic:

> Google Analytics for Firebase is enabled by default to provide the full range of FCM features.

then over [here](https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/disable-analytics)

> In some cases, you may wish to temporarily or permanently disable collection of Analytics data, such as to collect end-user consent

Yeah...That's not how it works. You get consent _before_ doing a damn thing. The only 'default' for the GDPR is to not enable tracking without the users consent.

Google should disable tracking by default for EU subjects, as is required (opt-in/consensual).
It does not. Currently it only displays a warning.

[Sauce](https://streamable.com/0737e)
That's a common trick of the trade: most confidential documents are fingerprinted such that any that leak can be traced back to the source. Some are even invisible and can be hidden in ways you wouldn't expect.
> Apps must not hide 

I'd suggest that not requiring consent, or explaining in extremely plain english that they harvest your data for mining purposes is 'hiding' tracking behavior.

If _any_ app requests your contacts (or other personal information) and sends that info to a server then, under this policy, it _must_ not be 'hidden' or 'cloaked'. 

If you look [here](https://support.snapchat.com/en-US/a/android-permissions) snapchat says:

> Read your contacts
We may collect and use information from your device's address book so you can invite friends and so we can improve the app.

I'd suggest that's hiding and cloaking - whilst they explain that yes, they do use your contacts no effort is made to explain how. It's also not clear how to 'revoke' that consent even if you deny permission (to destroy the data, which obviously won't happen). I'd expect a detailed explanation of _exactly_ what happens to that data. How do they store it? Is it safe/secure? Is it for ad purposes? Allowing users to understand why they require this would make people much more comfortable potentially sharing this data. (but, most of us know it's for mining purposes).

Seems to fall short of GDPR's requirements which I feel Google is barely trying to enforce here.
> Apps must not hide or cloak tracking behavior or attempt to mislead users about such functionality.

Great, so Reddit, Facebook and Snapchat are all due for removal on the Play Store? 

Useless having rules if you're not going to enforce them, or rather, only enforce them on the small guys because the others can pay you to turn a blind eye ;).

And how naive I was to think Google would make apps provide consent to tracking, but that would never happen.

> Any hosting service should be held responsible for what they host. That's not censorship.

Huh, that's odd...How come I can still drive on the road when it's clearly the roads faults for the _millions_ of deaths since cars were invented...Oh, and guess we should ban the sky too, since Airplanes can crash and kill people...

In fact, we should just ban life while we're at it, since clearly that's responsible for all the bad things in the world.

To the -5 and beyond for you :)
POSTing the data is fine - it's exactly what reddit and most other places do. You _could_ encode the data using JavaScript such that it makes it harder for an attacker, but as others have said, TLS renders that pretty much obsolete.

But _please_ do your research before you _ever_ accept any password in any form. It terrifies me that there are people who are weak at security making apps that store people's private data; if you do not know, in detail, how to do it properly I really advise you not to do it at all. 

And yes, judging by your responses here, even if you're keen to learn, I'd advise hiring somebody rather than doing it yourself, because I expect a near expert to be implementing modern security systems. I honestly wish people were fined/arrested more often for failing to make their systems secure, most places cheap out on that (sony hacks, experian, you name it)...

here's a test for you: are you aware of [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2)? If you didn't know what it was, you should be staying 10000 miles away from _anything_ relating to users private data. Better safe than sorry.
Right - but what better way to show off your new guidelines than having different apps implement things differently, providing a wonderful, consistent experience on all their own apps...Owait...

Consistency is important for UX - follow common patterns/trends like the hamburger menu for example, or bottom navigation...I wish it was one or the other...
Doesn't matter since Google won't stick to the guidelines anyway and there will be _tonnes_ of consistency across their apps for sure /s.
Yet storing them digitally is vunerable to brute forcing so it's just which method you feel is safer in the long run.
Correct - mods can see their comments but users cannot. You can approve them and then they'd show up in the comments to regular users.
Do they look like [this](https://i.imgur.com/ydbsaJ6.png) at all? If I visit that users profile I get [this](https://i.imgur.com/KebzDZk.png). Which means they're shadowbanned; this is an attempt to stop bots realising they are banned and just registering a new account.

You _should_ be able to approve them manually and they'd show up, but most mods just gently nudge the commenter that their account is shadowbanned...
Most VPNs are blocked by iPlayer. Imagine it was your job to go through every VPN service, collect the IPs and blacklist them, there is _nothing_ any VPN service can do to prevent this. It's the same story for Netflix.

If I had a website I could also block VPNs quite easily since they usually have entire ranges in certain countries :)
If this is true I imagine SpaceX have royally ballsed up and several apologies will be going out. I imagine Elon might tweet a few things too =D
Hi /u/Drunken_Economist - I'm the OP that made that PSA that was spread around in r/technology, r/privacy and r/stopadvertising. One thing you didn't answer is _why_ you're hiding the advertising behind the API knowing it's _much_ harder to block than the older subdomains; it almost feels like you want this data _no matter what_.

Do you not agree users should be allowed to opt-out of this tracking? To me, using an ad-blocker is more than just blocking ads, it's about basic web security, and I don't appreciate you or anyone else breaking critical functionality just so you can get a few pieces of information.

Also, this tracking should be _opt in_; you're probably going to need to make these changes for the GDPR anyway as I am sure you are aware.
Knowing Google they won't change anything until 9.1 which no devices will actually ship apart from their own so we'll be waiting for 10.0 for mass adoption...
No worries - thought it'd be worth mentioning since it seemed like a significant change and that's what this sub is all about right? :)

Thanks for being an awesome mod and keeping this place ticking over :D

I think this is a novel idea, and Greg once spoke how he was asked to support his trees for 20 years and said they were insane and it's not happening. Ben has maintained his Kernels for 6 years each but I want to compare like for like.

20 years ago makes 1998; youtube, facebook, twitter didn't exist, heck, even IPv6 was only a draft at this point. So as you can see, a _lot_ has changed in that time.

If Ben could make the 2.0 kernel, released 9 June 1996 work to modern standards then I'd be inclined to believe this was possible, but too much changes even by kernel standards to make this a realistic target, I admire somebody giving it a go though.

But 3 year LTS' for the kernel are a joke, they should _all_ get 6 years at least which is reasonable and doable.
Again, you miss the point. Normally you'd install adblock, script block and that'd be the end of it. Reddit is _intentionally_ using their API which provides _essential_ functionality as a way to track users. There's no stopping them sneakily adding more and more data as time goes on. Or even encoding the requests to make it impossible to figure what's actually being sent (they do this already, making root POSTs to reddit.com with illegible fields).

It's not what they're doing now it's _how_ they're doing it that makes it bad for privacy advocates. 
I think you're missing the point here. Have a look at my image again, study it closely. This tracking is _not_ required to make reddit work in any way, shape or form. This is data used for marketing/analytics, and is in no way used to provide Reddits service. Unless you're saying collecting the UUID, utc_offset and other ID's are required? 

This tracking is _illegal_ plain and simple under the GDPR, and I'm guessing if Reddit keeps it this way, they'll be getting a fair few complaints.


The information they are collecting constitutes personal information. The GDPR defines this as:

> Any information related to a natural person or ‘Data Subject’, that can be used to directly or indirectly identify the person. It can be anything from a name, a photo, an email address, bank details, posts on social networking websites, medical information, or a computer IP address.

 They also state:

> The conditions for consent have been strengthened, as companies will no longer be able to utilise long illegible terms and conditions full of legalese, as the request for consent must be given in an intelligible and easily accessible form, with the purpose for data processing attached to that consent - meaning it must be unambiguous. Consent must be clear and distinguishable from other matters and provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. It must be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it.​  Explicit consent is required only for processing sensitive personal data - in this context, nothing short of “opt in” will suffice. However, for non-sensitive data, “unambiguous” consent will suffice.

This data processing does not meet those requirements. It gets better:

> Part of the expanded rights of data subjects outlined by the GDPR is the right for data subjects to obtain from the data controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning them is being processed, where and for what purpose. Further, the controller shall provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge, in an electronic format. This change is a dramatic shift to data transparency and empowerment of data subjects.

[source](https://www.eugdpr.org/gdpr-faqs.html)

So that's three strikes so far against the GDPR; if you can prove me otherwise I am happy to understand how they're abiding by the new law.

The reality is simple: GDPR makes this tracking _illegal_ regardless of the data they are collecting, and users are entitled to opt-out and collect the information from the data controller. Now who might that be? Might be worth EU subjects sending some PM's/emails :D
No. It used to be via d.reddit.com, e.reddit.com, events.reddit.com and alternative subdomains. Hijacking their API is a _very_ recent change that I (and others) spotted a few days ago.

[Here's a look at the data they send](https://i.imgur.com/nNBD7p1.png).

This isn't about the data itself, it's about the principle of hijacking essential reddit functionality as a means to collecting data about users and their devices, what they're reading, unique identifiers and so on. Many people are privacy conscious; Cambridge Analytica only collected information, what's so bad about that?

The reality is, people use adblockers and script blockers to try and enhance their privacy, and reddit is essentially saying "you can only use essential functionality if we can collect data about you, we'll circumvent ad/script blockers and collect data by any means necessary".

It's not tolerable behaviour, and I am inclined to say that it's damn _illegal_ under the upcoming GDPR; the skepticist in me thinks they'll go all out today and at some point be forced to reign it in once they're told to knock it off if they collect data on EU subjects.


Here are some adblock rules you can use to stop this tracking:

    d.reddit.com
    reddit.com/api/register
    reddit.com/api/comment
    reddit.com/api/friend
    reddit.com/api/submit
    reddit.com/api/
    reddit.com/errors
    oops.redditmedia.com
    
Note: This _will_ break reddit; expandos won't work, commenting won't work unless you remove /api, /submit and /comment rules, which I do for each comment (cumbersome, but that's what you gotta do these days for privacy).
Reproduce:

In your adblock, block the following:

    d.reddit.com
    reddit.com/api/register
    reddit.com/api/comment
    reddit.com/api/friend
    reddit.com/api/submit
    reddit.com/api/
    reddit.com/errors
    oops.redditmedia.com

That should cause the reproducible outcome. Sadly it's not currently possible to utilise Reddit without those blocks in place at all times due to the admins being [tricky about tracking](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopadvertising/comments/87d1sq/psa_reddit_has_enhanced_their_tracking_they_now/) :(
Apart from the NSA which I have no doubt have many, many exploits and backdoors we're yet to learn about :)
I am skeptical but if the GDPR is worth its salt then we should be seeing some pretty interesting changes this year and beyond. Of course, if nothing happens to the 'big guys' then this entire framework will basically be a waste of time.
1: Get S9/Plus. 

S8 doesn't have Treble so you're out of luck there.
Are you able to go into more detail? I'm curious as to what you're saying. Treble was not complete in 8.0 and was only finalised in 8.1 and they were _very_ clear about that from the beginning from what I've read.

Obviously it's a brand new architecture for Android so it'll be painful to work with for now, but what we're seeing is awesome for the future of ROMs. Having a GSI should make developing Lineage _much_ easier in the future, and I've not seen anything to suggest that's not the case, so getting the thoughts of developers is much appreciated :)
ITT: humans are fucking disgusting creatures.
That's why Facebook obviously did not open source their [entire object recognition software](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/) and have spent many, many millions on AI to automatically recognise objects, in the background of photos... Obviously [this](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/blob/master/demo/output/33823288584_1d21cf0a26_k_example_output.jpg?raw=true) photo is a lie

Sure buddy, sure.
Reddits redesign uses react, they're also thinking about using graphql if they're not already, another Facebook product.

I suspect eventually Facebook will buy Reddit, if they haven't already.
It goes further: never engage with society. Even if you're not on Facebook, if you're out with friends they're being tracked, if you're in a photo, even the background, and it's uploaded to Facebook they will know. They can easily infer what other people _may_ exist even if you've never been on Facebook, since they have shadow profiles if their knowledge graph knows anything about you.

If you want privacy, you best live off grid entirely.
/u/JeffDujon you said you had loads of footage you captured, I'm curious how much - I'd imagine in the 100's of GB? The footage for the pod video is _incredible_. I'd _love_ to to sit and watch all the footage you captured. 
"The lies of society" sounds like an interesting CGPGrey video :P.

Also, we're hitting #100 soon. Hopefully our favourite podders have something special lined up :D
Make comments wider please. Remove lightbox.
Project Treble makes new budget phones _much_ more exciting :D
Your data is delicious.
> stop saying an SSD is required for any modern OS, its not, period.

SSD's are not _required_ of course, however, as people are telling you, you are going to have a _very_ miserable time without one. I am sure after a few months of saving you'd be able to afford an SSD if you feel it worthwhile. 

> I shouldn't have to buy an SSD for this.

You are aware of how a HDD works vs SSD's right? Like, the very fundamental difference in just accessing a file vs flash memory, and the speed differential?

You don't _need_ a 80mph car, but it sure beats having one stuck at 30mph trying to drive 100 miles ;).
HDD's are simply not acceptable for an OS these days - for media, backup storage and general stuff sure, but for applications, games and every day software you _need_ an SSD.

It's a _must_. Else you're going to have a _very_ bad time.

Get an SSD, you will think yourself stupid for not doing it many years ago. On my SSD, I can load 23GB worth of hibernated RAM in 30 seconds, on a HDD that'd take at least 2-3 minutes.
Isn't this literally Instant Apps from a few years ago?

Correct - it should be down to parents to monitor their child's viewing habits and not Google or machine learning algorithms. I say take Youtube Kids away and let parents do their job.
There is, treble wasn't complete until 8.1 and most devices don't ship with that so P is your best bet
No. Ensure your next phone has Treble before buying. I'd go with a phone that launches with P when Treble should be _fully_ mature.
Yes, in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ksegw928gUM) talk. With Treble they can now take a data driven support of which HIDL's to support and for how long.

> companies to improve Bluetooth

Except this _isn't_ happening and ***_can't_*** happen, it's impossible. Bluetooth is a standard that has a defined way of working. Similar to web browsers implementing HTTP or HTTPS - you adhere to the rules and that's it.

BT5 is the latest version, and any future updates will require new hardware. Software can't fix much, and any changes will take years to reach consumers.

> But the devices you connect to have to use Bluetooth 5 compatible hardware as well. That means Bluetooth 5 headphones, smart home devices, speakers, mice, keyboards...
+1 for not only keeping an N build, but also releasing 1 N build per month on _all_ devices that ship 15.1. Nougat had had over a year and a half of work, throwing that all away for 15.1 is reckless and shortsighted.
Yeah - this will become more common as work on 14.1 shifts towards 15.1. Seems like for the majority of the devices there are no changes this week :)
Except _any_ device with 15.1 does not get 14.1 builds, which I find a shame since many people will want to stick with Nougat for quite some time to come. Building and storing 1 N build for each device on 15.1 would not take that much storage/resources...
Yes, by using HTTPS. Or a VPN.
Where did it say that? I checked and it's for sure set to 17.
Read through this thread, half the comments are talking about just that, but basically, yes and no; for _now_ it shows a warning, but the documentation says they'll be blocked (although that is _not_ the case as of DP1).
You've misunderstood what this change is supposed to be - currently the value of that integer prints 17, meaning apps below SDK 17 will not run on P.
It's strange - I just installed an app I _know_ uses SDK 3 (Cupcake) and targets SDK 4 (Donut), and it runs just fine in the emulator (apart from the fact you get a warning message).

You can see a recording I just made [here](https://cf-e2.streamablevideo.com/video/mp4/0737e.mp4?token=1520950867-XXIlgG18fYGslpGs0WwKyMK3%2BdqsJljhdj%2FWX1uCiXs%3D), very intriguing. 
API 17, as defined [here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-sdk-element.html#ApiLevels) is Android 4.2, 4.2.2 or 	JELLY_BEAN_MR1.

Meaning applications that target below that will not run.
I just ran a very basic application in Android Studio to understand _what_ that value is set to. I've never coded Android ever so it took  a while to get there, but I did:

    Log.d("rofl",getAndroidVersion());
    
And the function:

    int mini = Build.VERSION.MIN_SUPPORTED_TARGET_SDK_INT;
    return "MIN SDK: " + mini;

This returned:

MIN SDK: 17
No - taken from Android P emulator.
No, however you can do [this](https://i.imgur.com/k9hlJNl.png).

70% is the maximum allowed.
So apps now have an easier way of adding advertisements in notifications? This won't be abused _at all_.

Can't wait for the headlines in a few years =).
> Users with root access will also suffer from these changes, unfortunately. You can’t simply “force” install an overlay and expect it to work, because the platform certificate mismatch will still be an issue. It’s likely that framework.jar would need to be patched in order to get rid of this requirement. Custom ROMs would of course be able to make this kind of change, but unrooted users cannot.


Likely O support will continue and those with root will get it on P.
I guess they decided to cash in on this while it was hot, sadly it'll be a 1 release affair. Cheers Google, thanks for fucking us yet again. Now why don't you release another messaging app?

Of course, designs _have_ to get stale or designers would be out of a job! They need to justify their expense some how.
Let's go by M, N and O previews, not much changed from DP1 to final, so don't expect any 'explosive' new features to come. These are your highlights.

I'm guessing people who disable JS altogether are "content thieves" as they don't allow themselves to be tracked online =D

If that's the case, so be it. The sooner these websites disappear the better, you can't force people to do something they don't want to so if you can't survive you obviously don't have a product/service people want.

If that's the case this very website wouldn't exist today and I wouldn't have made a comment you replied to ;).
It's hilariously sad how naive the individual who made the decision to implement a feature like this is. Bounce rate is _absolutely_ the last thing you want to encourage, and you're turning away you're most _valuable_ users.

Imagine you turned away a user who'd share your page on social media, or provide meaningful interaction (which search engines can measure and use as a signal in ranking).

This, ironically enough, causes a _decrease_ in revenue if you were to follow it in the long run due to the consequence of losing such users. 

Power users are the ones who not only understand technology, but have the influence to impact your traffic is pretty substantial ways. They are absolutely the people you want browsing your website.
Who would win: _The_ most advanced multi-billion dollar space agency on the planet or one suey boi? With SpaceX's army of lawyers I'd be surprised if it even makes it to court :P. They'd probably want to settle out of court or they'd basically lose.
It's not really something you can hold them accountable for though, and even if you did, what would you do about it? There's no conceivable way to regulate this by law (because there's not a fucking chance Linus Torvalds would _ever_ let that happen, or any other kernel maintainer) so that doesn't leave you a lot of options.

What you _can_ do is go by the best case scenario, which is Apple or Google pixel, anything else is a crapshoot.
Sounds like your enterprise are idiots then, if we were at the beginning of the smartphone boom then I'd give then some leeway but we're a decade in at this point and it's all become fairly routine. The best bet is to go with the most reputable company (Google/Apple) or get a flagship with a known history (Samsung flagship like s8). 

Samsung also just announced 4 years support for enterprise with the s9 too, mainly due to the 4.4 kernel (thanks Greg KH).

If you want to be cheap then of course you shouldn't expect world class support, it's why Microsoft has enterprise OS that's different from consumer.

You get what you pay for.
Money.
Thanks for that link! I was just wondering how I would Google for what I am wondering and whether people have thought about this before. It's certainly a very interesting topic and _very_ relevant to SpaceX and reflying boosters
As /u/paul_wi11iams said they still need an FAA license and I'd be _astounded_ if SpaceX were simply allowed to send any old humans into space without _some_ level of regulation or certification; people can't even drive on the roads without themselves being certified (and that _all_ cars need to be roadworthy to be legal, laws differ on how this is done).

Considering the potential loss of life scenario, SpaceX would probably want to certify any vehicle to the same standards as the crew dragon program (since _any_ loss of life would impact their ability to send astronauts to space, if not outright lose their license altogether).
See, this is something I find interesting. Yes, the two side boosters on the FH demo _were_ flight-proven but I am guessing they had enough work done to them that _technically_ they weren't the same booster. I mean, if you were to repair a car, at what point does it become a 'new' thing? Do we have to replace _every_ part? If we keep the engine and replace everything else is it the _same_ car?

It's likely that so far, using flight-proven boosters has involved a fair amount of work in terms of repairing any parts to the point where it's possibly not exactly 'like new'.

That then raises the question: How confident _is_ SpaceX in reflying boosters? Will they manage to get 5 or 10+ launches from a single rocket? And how do we _know_ it's the _same_ rocket? Just because it has the same number doesn't mean it's using all (or any) of the original parts (could they replace 1 or all of the merlin engines? does that mean it's technically not the 'same' rocket?). How many flights can those Merlin engines do before they need replacing? And if you replace 1 does that still count as 'flight-proven'?

Whilst I _am_ arguing semantics here, it's important when we talk about 'reflying' anything (including aircraft, after enough repairs I'd argue it's not the 'same' aircraft as it was 5 years ago).
I guess the lunar cancellation is due them not wanting the FH to get human certified? I guess it'd make sense to offer those individuals a seat on a BFR since that's the vehicle that's going to be manning people (apart from the dragon ofc, but that's just to ISS [whose future is unknown beyond 2025]).
How many FH missions can SpaceX realistically do each year? It seems they are aiming for 3 this year, which wouldn't be too bad, but with BFR on the horizon I wonder if they'll keep development at a steady trickle rather than trying to go 'all hands on deck' as far as FH is concerned.

I am speculating this also depends on Block 5's ability for "rapid reuse", and whether it'll be any different to reusing a B5-F9 in terms of refurbishment. If that was the case they could develop a few FH's and just keep them in rotating active service. 

Might work out quite well for them in the near future 
Can you share the general gist of those voicemails? Hopefully he was _seething_ with rage and was absolutely _livid_. I also wonder just how much business they lost and whether he ever changed his behaviour or wondered why two employees would ever do that.

Either way, excellent story, and based on what you told us, he deserved it.
Flash didn't get 'removed', it's just mobile didn't support it and that's where a _lot_ of traffic comes from. Flash is still present until 2020 and only recently restrictions added to limit flash availability.
> single universal generalization.

> Being tasked with changing something that doesn't need changing

It's so very obvious Reddit has _needed_ to change for many, many years now. The current site is very difficult to change and add meaningful features too, and working with a new stack means they can add features that may have been too difficult and time consuming before.

Supporting a site of this size with code this old is something that is not always trivial to do; it's why COBOL is a very specialized programming language, and why we made new ones, and why companies keep adding web platform features that aim to make things better.

Of course, not every change sticks, but if you don't _try_ then you may never know. People thought the idea of the hashtag (#) was absolutely _stupid_. Or Bitcoin would _never_ take off.

Now they missed their chance to be a millionaire. All because they had convinced themselves they were _right_.
Let me take you on a journey. Back around 1995 geocities started becoming popular, and grew to be _the_ web hosting service of the internet. We had websites like [this](http://www.theworldsworstwebsiteever.com/) or [this](http://www.oocities.org/televisioncity/1639/) which people thought were _all_ the rage. Where <marquee> was an accepted paradigm.

Judging by people in r/redesign we'd still be using Geocities _today_. However, there's a reason Myspace, Bebo, MSN and AOL are all currently residing in /dev/null; times change, things progress, and change is a _nescessity_. We'll look back at this comment in 10 years, and I am fairly confident in saying people will be thinking "thank god they did redesign, it's _such_ an improvement".

Reddit 1.0 will feel like <marquee> that nobody uses anymore.
> Definitely, the profiles miss the mark in many ways.

And for all the flack admins get, name just _one_ other social media site where the admins are distinguished, freely admitting one of their changes that must've taken _months_ to build misses the mark. 

Not even Snapchat acknowledged their recent 'redesign' woes and admitted it 'missed the mark', they just doubled down on their stance that it's what you got so you best use it.

And that's what sets Reddit _apart_ and why you're the 8th most popular website _in the world_. You don't get there without making a series of _correct_ decisions. And yes, sometimes you'll get it wrong, but admitting that and working on improvements is how you continue to grow and make this place as awesome as it is today.



/u/hueylewisandthesnoos - thank you and the team for being so open and honest about this redesign. You have had a fair whack of criticism but it's obvious that despite what people in r/redesign have said you are not "digging" yourselves a grave (with that tired, overused meme).

I have observed the improvements over the last few months and I am confident you'll get to a point where people will _prefer_ the new design. It will take _years_ for that to happen - the current design has existed in some form since Reddit was first launched in 2005. It'll take some time before people are comfortable switching over, and some may never want to, but you can't hold on to such people forever, we'd still be using geocities if that were the case.

People expect it to be _perfect_ _today_, but that's just not going to happen. With feedback, and changes over time, I am confident you'll deliver a world class desktop experiences people will _love_ using.
Qualcomm is _massively_ guilty of this. Just read their recent 700 [press release](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2018/02/27/qualcomm-introduces-new-snapdragon-700-mobile-platform-series)

Make sure to report your crypto tax analysis on the markov deep blockchain to ensure the AlphaGo Deepmind Tensorflow processor can get your maximum Ethereum Bit refund.


Yes, let's just stop developing an OS because some devices don't have the update. I guess Google should've stopped Android after 1.0 since "Google should have fixed that long ago". I guess we're done here, best close r/android because no device has Oreo.

I am guessing you know _nothing_ about programming, C or C++? Because if you did you wouldn't make such a stupid comment that clearly shows your ignorance on the subject. They were working on Treble _years_ before it was introduced in Oreo; the majority of the work was contained in a single release but they did a lot more foundational work to even have the possibility to merge in Oreo.

Android has over 2 billion users spanning on 20,000 devices which have to work _flawlessly_ (or people like you complain), which is no easy feat.

But yeah, you're right, they should've done this during Android 1.0. 
As always, Apple and Google are different beasts entirely. When you control the _entire_ chain it's not exactly difficult. In fact, if _only_ the Nexus/Pixel line existed, you wouldn't have written that comment and I wouldn't have written this reply =).
> Treble will start showing the difference it's going to make this time next year.

Not exactly - the first glimpse into the post-treble world will be around August 22nd when AOSP P should drop. We are then counting the days it takes to get 8.0/8.1 treble to 9.0.

Then we'll be counting phones on 9.0 to 10.0 where Treble should be complete. 
In case anyone hasn't seen it (where have you been?!) take a look [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbSwFU6tY1c). [here is terminal count: t-10](https://youtu.be/wbSwFU6tY1c?t=1309) seconds.
Considering smartphones have been around for over 10 years, blogs _really_ need to find some unique content to rake in those clicks - The S9/S10/S20 are just 'iterations' but the foldable is r/woahdude material so it works.

Nope, it's all about codecs and DRM :)
lmao what bullshit. hopefully someone justs posts it on github...

Same - I really disliked how he became LTS maintainer from Ben and basically decided "fuck 6 year, it's 3 year now" which is absolutely _useless_ for most practical applications.

I guess he wanted people to migrate to newer Kernels more often, but sadly that's not how enterprise works.
I think that was a common misconception that the speaker didn't really pay attention to. He says LTS is 6 years, however, at this time it's _only_ 4.4 that has been given the blessing. Funnily enough, the previous LTS maintainer Ben Hutchings always did 6 year LTS (3.2 and 3.16 are still supported).

So the jury is still out for that one - it's possible 4.9 will get 6 years, but I suspect Greg will limit it to 1 6-year per major linux version. So around 5.4 would be the next 6 year.

Of course, anyone is free to maintain a longterm for as long as they like, it's just whether anyone wants to :)
Nobody - 4.4 was projected to EOL in 2018, however in a conference it was [announced](https://youtu.be/Ksegw928gUM?t=1329) 4.4 would have an "ELTS" - and EOL in 2022.

I am guessing Google had to pay Greg a boatload of fuck you money for him to work on a single tree for that long :P.
Typically Greg honours the EOL dates for the trees he maintains, unless somebody wants to take over from him. 
Correct - however, it'd be wise to backport to the 4.4 branch because that will be supported for longer. Using 4.9 makes no sense as it ends LTS in 2019...
/u/forkbomb_ - will you still ship 14.1 on devices that get 15.1? I ask since I'd rather stick with 14 for as long as possible while the months of development continue over the year.

Right now nexus 5 is super stable on 14.1, has over 3500 hours uptime :)
Yeah you're right! The botched i9 and x299 in reaction to Ryzen and the whole Meltdown/Spectre the former of which actually _slowed_ down older processors is an incredible step in the right direction.

They've gotten *so* good, they're innovating backwards!

But seriously. It's 2018 and we're _only_ just seeing the first i5 6c/6t _because_ of Ryzen; Intel has been sitting on that for _years_. There is absolutely _no_ innovation in this space, not anymore.
OEMs are _really_ getting desperate now! Having to rely on "reimagined" when I can't see anything fundamentally different to the S8. You can't sell the same shit year after year before people catch on that phone innovation has basically died.

Then again, the same can be said for the computing market in general; CPUs are just not getting that much better and we've for sure reached a saturation point in terms of hardware...
I _highly_ suspect this is in part thanks to Treble and more in part thanks to Greg Kroah-Hartman who has, for the first time since becoming a Linux LTS (longterm) maintainer, guaranteed 6 years of Kernel support for 4.4, which is the Kernel that will ship with the S9. 4.4 is supported until 2022, which is, oddly enough, 4 years away.
lulwut? So OnePlus phones are the only ones, in the world, at that price point? There are _no_ other phones, at all, someone can buy that are better than OnePlus?

Don't buy their phones. This kills the company.

There. Problem solved.
Yes - you and everyone else _must_ accept updates are now part of the Windows experience. Microsoft _tried_ to let people do it themselves with no hand holding, and everyone just decided "fuck updates". You reap what you sow, MS is now mandating people update, and the entire internet is safer as a result.

Unless you prefer the Linux Kernel approach, where updates are basically non-existent (most servers are outdated, not patched, running an insecure kernel).

Updates are only a pain if _you_ let them be. Make it a weekly task: check updates, let them download, then restart, and then you won't be bothered for another month. They even let you pause for 35 days if needs be.
Great suggestion :)

However this is something that Reddit should allow natively and not depend on Google, which gives them another data point they can track.

Fonts are small so Reddit could serve them itself.
What I've learnt is it's the NPM devs _themselves_ that set a really bad example of how _not_ to handle a major software project.

To anyone who cares: use yarn. no seriously, use yarn. it's made by actually competent devs who do not engage with BS.

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) is made by Facebook and helped by Google. NPM is made by children with nothing better to do.

[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/). [Use](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) [it](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)[.](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
I suppose that may help shift the _rocket_ bottleneck, but I wonder if they can overcome the FAA and range/personnel bottleneck to actually launch that fast. I also assume they'd want to have 3-4 Falcon 9's in "service" to launch - land - launch in said 24 hours (unless it's 24 hours for a single F9 at _best_).

I guess they'd also need to know when to retire the rocket vs rolling out a fresh new one and using that multiple times.

Interesting times to even be thinking about this. 
Any details on the proposed speeds you'd get from these or anything about how the internet would work? I assume they'd be IPv6 compliant if that even matters?
How many of these satellites could they realistically put on each F9? Would FH yield a better quantity per launch?

I'm guessing extremely rapid reuse is going to be the key to deploying _thousands_ of satellites, what's the quickest they could go from launch - land - launch? I am guessing this will require _hundreds_ if not a thousand launches to complete the constellation.
I meant Paz wouldn't want SpaceX to broadcast their own satellite deployment. Either that or SpaceX didn't out of respect.
In case you were wondering, the reason "no ground coverage" was obviously PR for "our customer doesn't want us to show our own satellite" or more likely, out of respect for the customer.
 
SpaceX far too modest...
Approved and stuck as an example of a exemplary request. I can't help with your request, but hopefully the visibility can yield some responses =D
Hopefully for registered users too! reddit.com/explore could do with some love :)
> Note that many CPU manufactures will not allow a ***meltdown*** to happen

Heh. I beg to differ. It already happened to you Intel, short term memory loss?
> Falcon 9 has done nothing to earn bragging rights over the Shuttle yet.

Apart from, you know, being the only rocket in _history_ to _ever_ land back on land, and at sea, even with a pre-flown booster, and be serviceable to the _second_ largest rocket in _history_, that worked _flawlessly_ (lighting _27_ engines) _AND_ landed back on land _again_ after the two side-core previous missions.

No bragging rights at all. Absolutely none.

They haven't reflown more simply because we're waiting for block 5; we know they _can_ be reflown, and with B5 we should expect each one to fly many times. 

At this point, shuttle looks positively ancient and was a complete _disaster_ with the likes of Challenger which was _easily_ preventable. SpaceX has made no such mistakes that cost actual lives.
"you're what?! What do you mean you're too _high_?! That is strictly against company policy and we shall have you fire--"  
"Sir?"  
"ed at once! Don't even bother coming back to the office, your belon--"   
"I mean on a plane"    
"Oh. Well you've could've just said."  
"Yeah well I _am_ too high right now."
It's like changing the fork, the spoon or the knife. You know why nobody has a job where they are trying to change that globally? Because they're perfect :P
All I see there are _designs_, get back to me when this is actually implemented in an APK I can download. Photoshop and Java are _very_ different beasts and one is easier than another ;).

I mean [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20110513172524im_/http://www.sciant.net:80/images/sciant_tommyinc_sleep1.jpg) is absurd, and the epitome of Photoshop in a nutshell. If I tasked you to implement that UI in code you probably couldn't on every device out there, it'd be far too difficult and impractical (and is just awful anyway and tries far too hard to be fancy for no reason)

I don't see renders on the 20,000+ different devices there are. UI design is ridiculously difficult which is why the grid system just _works_. Divide width/height into rows with a certain number of pixels for spacing.
Not true, that change has not been merged
Yup, agreed. I don't care if it's boring, windows 10 still has a desktop, taskbar and an explorer, and Windows XP had that back in the 2000's. It may _look_ different but it's functionally the same for the most part, heck windows still has old XP icons littered around the OS. Ubuntu still has the same looking desktop and wallpaper over a decade later.

You never change something 'just because', but I guess UI designers need to stay employed some how...
Because nobody has _ever_ made anything better? The _entirety_ of Android is open source, so _you_ are able to reinvent every last detail if you so choose.

As far as the homescreen is concerned nobody has made a better version so far (or we'd not be having this conversation).

You are free to Photoshop some designs, but you can't because it's very, _very_ difficult to come up with something better that over _1 billion_ people have to relearn and use. Look at the iPhone X for example, changes for change sake, but apart from gestures all is the same still.
Correct, this user has been dealt with, thanks to whoever submitted the report :)
> it's not like your phone ships with Oreo and you can update it infinitely using treble.

That's literally the entire point of Treble. Of course, you won't get updates forever, since eventually Google will drop certain HALs/HIDLs which they will decide based on data/usage from play services. You should expect 3-4 updates on Treble _at least_, provided by the OEM or a custom ROM.

Of course, 8.0 wasn't Treble complete (missing VNDK), which is included in 8.1, with further changes coming in P. However, whilst it's likely _some_ work will be involved in future versions of Android (8.0 -> 9.0) it should be sufficiently quicker than what we have today (far, far less work).

So as far as custom ROMs are concerned, you should be seeing releases 2-3 months after AOSP, potentially even quicker. So when P drops this year, check how long it takes any Treble enabled phone to get updated :)
Why are the screenshots using kernel 3.18? I thought all devices had to use kernel 4.x.

Yeah...This thread is a crap shoot, was expecting some interesting conversation but I guess when the FCC is involved all that goes out the window.
Yeah, and people don't care about that. Data is a new currency, and don't be naive and think "I paid for it!". If they can get your data they _will_. Heck, if I was selling an app I'd make damn sure to collect every piece of data I was allowed, even if it counts as 'personal', simply too valuable not to these days.

There's also a cost to dumping hazardous waste into our oceans, we should take better care of them. =)
Seems it's business as usual - a less spectacular launch this time, but in this industry complancancy is not an option. Looking forward to another successful launch and landing.

Hopefully we can see Block 5 sometime soon and see some more rapid relaunches, I think that's the next exciting major milestone (apart from crew dragon).
Yeah, that's _not_ going to happen if you understand Treble at all. It was a _huge_ change to the very fundamentals of _how_ Android works, the only way they can _not_ support Treble at this point is to branch Nougat and forget Oreo ever existed.

Since that's _not_ going to happen, and if you bother to look [at their gerrit repo](https://android-review.googlesource.com/) (and specifically [here](https://android-review.googlesource.com/q/status:open+hidl) for HIDL) you can see they are still adding HIDL's and improving on Treble.

But hey - in your world you're free to believe what you want, it's wrong, but don't let some stupid internet commenter stop you :).
Yeah. You don't understand Treble, just another useless r/android troll.

Just to educate you: EVERY device that ships with 8.0+ MUST support Treble. So no, they're not "abandoning" it, since there's NOTHING to "abandon".

Every device that ships with 8.0 this year will support Treble, and we already know that for a fact. If you can prove that ANY one of [these](https://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?nYearMin=2018&sOSes=2&sOSversions=2800) devices (that _ship_ with 8.0) does NOT have Treble, I'll gild you for 12 months.
That's not how it works. [Once you've understood this](https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/treble) feel free to comment on Treble again. There's 11 links on that page so next time you talk about Treble you should be fully informed and know _exactly_ what it is and how it's not going to be "abandoned".


It's impossible to list individual things because it depends on the community. Maybe I want style [each](https://i.imgur.com/8HHQPbr.png) of these links in a unique way, maybe I want to add better responsiveness, or change how/where something appears.

There's too much nuance to custom CSS that will simply not be replicable with the community designer. Custom CSS is an _absolute_ must because on desktops it helps to make communities unique. 

A better question is, how much of /r/ooer can be applied to [the alpha version](https://alpha.reddit.com/r/ooer) and so far, it's not that great.
Elon is the chief designer and CEO and CTO of SpaceX, and pretty much made SpaceX himself (obviously he had people helping him), but to suggest he doesn't understand is a great insult. I'd read [this](https://www.quora.com/How-did-Elon-Musk-learn-enough-about-rockets-to-create-and-run-SpaceX) post by Jim Cantrell who worked closely with Musk.

I'm pretty sure he understands how rockets work in great detail and why SpaceX has been so successful. If he _didn't_ understand he'd read up and get all the knowledge so he _does_. So it's entirely possible he's learnt a few things that he understands perfectly well.
Cash is untraceable and does not leave a digital fingerprint so it's much much much harder to connect the dots. If you were asked to trace every human who has ever touched that $5 bill it'd be impossible.
It's so fluffy!
It's a bit disingenuous though, no? I mean, the _rollout_ started today. The rollout profile is likely to be a few months for a major update. Unless _every_ S8 in the world will get the update before the S9, which would be impressive. 
/u/landoflobsters are you able to speak about the use of AI in posting of content both AI-posted and AI-generated media (audio, visual)?

If anyone is interested, here is a link to the Falcon Heavy conference yesterday:

Although we are all eagerly awaiting a launch today, do _not_ be surprised or shocked if we see a T-10 second abort of some sort, this will be the first time it'll actually engage for launch so there might be glitches.

Aside from that, if it does fly today it'll be an absolute beast. That, and the race is on to edit and post photos/videos to this sub =)
For the last 28 days. So $30k/mo = $360,000 year which quite honestly is not bad. Some people make what he makes a month in a year. I have no idea how it compares to other channels, but is a very useful statistic to benchmark other youtubers by :P.

> The only good outcome of this is that people will probably quit uploading photos on themselves eventually

Facebook managed to convince over a _billion_ people to use their website and many hundreds of millions to upload photos (of people from all ages). Yet, I remember in the early days of the internet you wouldn't dare use your real name.

Yeah, this is why. It was the next obvious advancement in AI technology (and has been known since 2016 if not earlier). Once people catch on there could be a mass deletion of pictures from all social media, wouldn't surprise me.
The thing that will literally be revolutionary is the argument in court of "this video was made by an AI". What the _fuck_ are you supposed to do with that? How can a court be sure beyond a reasonable doubt? And that assumes the judge/jury doesn't laugh at how absurd an idea that is (because let's face it, many won't know about this tech).

People need to learn about this and fast, and lawmakers _must_ be on the ball, 5 years in technology is the same as 10-15 years these days.
Congratulations /u/Assamin. This is the first concept in this sub I have _ever_ seen that includes the ribbon and doesn't _remove_ functionality so it's a glorified mobile UI on a desktop environment. This is more like what we'll end up seeing.

They won't be removing the ribbon any time soon so any "concept" is failed and incomplete without it. The contrast/grey is awful though, what's wrong with colour? Seems everyone is dead set on having tedious boring interfaces, even Google is over-doing the whiteness on Android...
You're not going to make the desktop interface touch friendly. If you want touch friendly you need a specially designed mode for that. It's why websites have media queries to scale on device, this obviously wasn't made for touch devices.

You do not have keyboard/mouse _and_ touch friendly, one or the other, otherwise we end up with the Windows 8 disaster of a start screen.
[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/DK7VVzU.png) what bootlog uptime says. If you believe I'd lie over something as benign as this I don't know what to say :P 
I just make sure it doesn't run out of juice and charge it when it's almost empty. LineageOS (and by extension, the kernel) do a wonderful job of ensuring things don't crash and are running smoothly.

I would install security patches, but I wanted to benchmark just how stable Lineage was and if it would cope without rebooting for so long. In my experience Linux based OS' are much better at this than others (looking at you Windows...)
I know cats are little shits, but that's a bit extreme :P
Is it? I mean we've seen two RUDs from the Falcon 9, it's entirely plausible this launch can succeed and the next can fail. Each launch carries the same risk, as we saw with the ariane launch recently which had a small but significant anomaly. 
I know if it were me, it'd be so tempting to go overboard and have like 10 cameras, maybe a few drones (if that's allowed) and a 8K RED Weapon recording this beauty of a launch. I really hope we get _thousands_ of stunning UHD footage of this launch, it's going to be a beast.

(Hopefully somebody records it in 8k, HDR and all the bells and whistles :D)
I wanted to make this into a thread of its own, but why is the Falcon Heavy launching such a dummy payload? We saw with Falcon 1 #1 and #3 they launched the FalconSat and PREsat respectively, and both launches failed. Falcon 1 #2 launched a 'Demosat' which is akin to what we're seeing with the heavy.

Even if this _does_ work, the risk is no less the second time around, and even after a dozen launches with the F9 a satellite and resupply mission were still lost.

It seems a shame to not take the opportunity to launch something better and more substantial whilst the opportunity is there, even if it is the first launch.
And what? Apple to _reduce_ their pricing? Since when have they _ever_ done that when announcing a new flagship? Anyone hoping for a cheaper-than-iPhone X this year is both naive and to be very disappointed :)
There's no such thing as 'free' and 'Apple', or any other flagship. That 'free' is reflected in the contract price.

If you are convinced to buy, that's all they want :) 

/u/anonlymouse I can give you a free car on contract if you want ;)
Lol, that's like saying the current GPU/RAM bubble will burst, maybe, but they've been getting _more_ expensive since 2013 and the Nexus 5 price days...

People are buying the iPhone X - the market has confirmed that price is suitable so expect it to remain this way for years to come.
Why, and how, is it okay for a male/female to lie about their age? If somebody says they're 18 then the interaction was fully 100% legal and consensual; obviously he didn't want to create illegal images/video and if she said she was 18, it was above board.

We _must_ imprison males/females that lie about their age and show them that is ruining people's lives is not okay it's unreasonable for a person to know how old you are. Unless we're supposed to check your ID for 'proof' these days.

America is a fucked up country and that guy is probably ruined now.

Super stoked for this launch. Not that SpaceX isn't already, but wouldn't a successful launch _firmly_ place them as the single most advanced space agency of all time? I mean, being able to land a first stage is cool, but launching a heavy vehicle _and_ landing _all_ stages (plus eventually fairing recovery) would potentially place them in the lead for the next half decade at least. That all whilst being the most powerful rocket in use (and, as far as I am aware, the first company to potentially ever do a successful mission with 27 engines)
Okay, fortunately this one is _very_, **_very_** simple. 

> Well, the last few days he has started pushing empty commits to our Github repository.

Github has an [insights](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/pulse) feature as I am sure you know. This accurately details _everything_ to do with your repo. Who does what and when, how many lines of code have changed, the whole damn lot.

Now, you take this and say "this is proof he's doing nothing". Your response is simple. You either tolerate him not being fired, you demonstrate your worth for potentially higher pay, or you leave.

Because depending on their reaction you will know _exactly_ what you're dealing with. If they won't fire him, that's a huge red flag you need to decide what to do with.

YES
Incredible. Finally the Falcon Heavy has proven its engine works and is ready for lift off. Can't wait!
> Can you actually expect a phone to have a life span that long and a company to support it?

Yes. Apple supports their phones for 5 years (iPhone 5 2012 - 2017), so I see absolutely _no_ reason why phones can't, and shouldn't, be supported that long. Only consumerism tells us that we _need_ to replace our phones frequently which is pure and utter bullshit.

I expect _every_ car to last 10 years if it's well designed, and most PC parts have 3-4 years warranty (sometimes even longer). Microsoft offers a LTSB in Windows 10 which is supported for _10 years_. If they can do it, other companies can do it.

The attitude of "release and forget" simply has to go. I'd expect Google to support the Pixel gen 1 until gen 4-5 but sadly, that's unlikely to ever happen.

My Nexus 5 is rocking Nougat thanks to ROM developers, and it works absolutely fine, it's fast, doesn't lag, so I see no reason why Google couldn't have shipped Oreo for it.
I don't understand how such gross incompetence is tolerated in the workplace. If you need to use a tool to do your job then you should know it to a standard degree.

Computers are not new, web browsers are not new, and these people are dinosaurs not willing to take the time to learn the tools they use, so eventually they will be replaced and it's their fault.

Bring it on :)
If you have to use a "burner card" to buy a product you probably shouldn't be buying a product from them. They have done so many things wrong that even if they had the cheapest, greatest phone ever made I still wouldn't buy it.
I can't find the email being quoted in that chain from Linus, anyone have it?
I think it's based on how much data they upload to their servers, and of course give to Google for data mining. 
Maybe you're being snarky, but they're actually putting this thing on the TEL - you couldn't say _that_ 6 months ago. Just be patient and let them ensure everything works. The last thing we all want is an RUD because people will bitch about that far more than 20 delays to the SF/launch when we're here twiddling our thumbs for 6 months while they investigate.

I'm impressed it even let you do that, for some folders sure...but damn that's not one I've ever come across before, impressive.
You're not a real IT tech until you've taken out production at least once. 
It's concerning it's _that_ easy to take down the internet for large amounts of people. People like to think we're united in the event of a major disaster, be it natural, political or anything else.

Reality is you just snip that cable and it's dead for many hundreds of thousands of people.

To me, that isn't a good and resilient design and perhaps we're not as 'interconnected' as we like to believe. There _are_ single points of failure that if attacked will render accessibility useless and I am sure the powers that be know each and every one of them.
>  After more than seven months of planning, the secret was finally out.

Why were these patches called 'emergency' if there was 7 months of planning? How are machines crashing and why are we worrying about benchmarks? Why were/are the benchmarks not already known? How could they possibly be caught off guard when they had 7 fucking months?

I expected all patches to be god damn flawless. The secret was pretty well kept for that duration, anything less than perfection is on those involved. The embargo was only broken by a _few days_ at most, it was due to come out on the 8th and it came out on the 3rd so the whole thing has left me confused...5 extra days would've made _no_ difference.
And from what I've heard all the rage of Node 10 is to get native modules included, _and_ it's going to be the next LTS release. It seems this late in the game that is very unlikely to happen.

I guess in 3 years we may have it figured out. We've only been working on this since [2012](http://blog.izs.me/post/25906678790/on-es-6-modules).

Jesus.
No, you do not require a new promise when using fetch as fetch _is_ a promise by itself.

In your console, this would work

> fetch("https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/7qbdal/very_confused_about_promises_with_fetch/").then(console.log).catch(err => console.log(err))

If you wanted custom logic to reject/resolve then using a new promise could be useful - perhaps you were fetching a resource and wanted to check what was returned and reject/resolve based on that (for example, authenticated user). Take this example

    var pro = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    fetch("https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/7qbdal/very_confused_about_promises_with_fetch/").then(res => {
    
    if(res.status == 200) {resolve("YAY");} else { reject("BOO!");}
    
    });
      
    });
    
    console.log(pro);

If you make the URL 404, it will return "BOO" instead.

Can you please, please, PLEASE remove that from the side bar? This rule simply has not been followed for many years now, as this has become more of a 'general purpose' subreddit, even for directly unrelated to android news.


To be honest, I can't think of why/how would be useful hence why I'm interested to see if anyone uses this. I don't know what to Google to find out though.

Thanks for your reply.
It seems to confirm that we've gone from the 'framework flavour of the week' to having three main, healthy frameworks, although Angular has had a turbulent history. I'd say Angular, React and Vue in the order personally, and each has a healthy community behind them. 

It should be noted out of those three, Vue is the only one mainly developed by a single guy called [Evan You](https://github.com/yyx990803) who has demonstrated he can hold up a framework almost single handedly (with the communities support) against the likes of Facebook and Google - extremely impressive!

I expect to see these frameworks hold their ground for the next few years, another framework not only has tough competition, but has to generate enough hype and community support to make people notice and then _actually use it_.

Additionally, not breaking the framework every week is _extremely_ important, and doing design _right_ from _today_ is important if enterprises are going to be putting new codebases on these frameworks for many years to come. Hence why LTS/non-breaking changes are so important.
Most websites have empty space, it's really difficult to use _all_ space effectively, but the typical paradigm has been to left align content, and when you're dealing with a website that is mainly textual based for comments, and videos/images are at the top, it becomes harder to really know what to do with the space you're _going_ to have.

However, the new design introduces overflow menus - now I need to click twice to report a thread rather than having everything available to me in one place. Look at [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/) for example, _entirely_ textual based, left aligned, as to be expected.

The problem is, as you highlighted in yellow, the amount of gutter space on either side which the current design does not have. And while we're at it, [this is what you can do](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/7pf6su/for_wide_resolutions_you_could_easily_fit_the/) with all that space, which would be delicious.

I have a large monitor, why not put stuff there for me to see?
I appreciate your response but I don't really see the point you're making here. Okay, I could've mentioned [twitter](https://i.imgur.com/W2VxOuJ.png) but I feel that's a site that can get away with the layout they've chosen. Youtube also has a bunch of empty space in places, like on the my subscriptions page, but that's not the point I am making.

Compare the two screenshots of the subreddit view before and after and you can see what a difference it makes - it _feels_ like the real estate is better used, and the _content_ is taking all available space rather than the web page rendering grey pixels.

If I wanted a website to be center aligned and not use the space I purchased, I'd buy a 1366x768 monitor instead, and that's not even getting into 2k/4k monitors, you can use chrome dev tools to have a look at how that looks.

Yes, old reddit has empty space, you're literally describing the side effects of computer design, I am not asking/suggesting every pixel be used effectively, but rather a center-aligned design is not effective. Why the hell do we need an overflow menu when we have [this](https://i.imgur.com/ugS6rXa.png), funny how you neglect to mention that effective use of space.

And the title...Well, I'm not the first to say it, and it was my first impression, you can't blame me for having an opinion that's what it _feels_ like with the design/modals...
Didn't know that, I'd argue that should be the default behaviour. Thanks for correcting my stupid :P
> I'd add to it that mods should be allowed to always change the title.

LOL that would end up breaking reddit. Could you imagine t_d mods being allowed to edit titles? 

They're the bunch I'd EXCLUDE from ever touching content besides removing it. And even then that's dicy if they're corrupt.
I'd like to add some extra thoughts to this idea:

1: Editable titles for 2-3 minutes after posting - This can account for typos or other mistakes that are made.  
2: Twilight period - maybe for 2-3 minutes, _all_ parts of your post are editable, and not displayed in r/new until the twilight period is over. Reddit is a reactive community so I'd wonder if a 2-3 minute delay before r/new would make a substantial difference.

But yes, +1 for editable titles.
That's not going to happen. But even if it did there would be an app to disable it. 
No, because you disable nearby.
Why would it have to be an "industry wide conspiracy?". I'm pretty sure most people have signed NDA's and know the consequences of leaking confidential/classified information, _especially_ if the interests of national security are at stake. The people who do that are your Wikileak's, Chelsea Manning's or your Edward Snowden's. Wikipedia estimates the NSA at 30-40k employees, yet it took Snowden to reveal the information nobody else did. People who leak information commit career and personal suicide, especially against the USA, it's simply not something most people are willing to do if you end up in prison for 20 years or crippling debt for the rest of your life.

Just because there are many people involved doesn't mean it's impossible to keep a secret, heck, you even acknowledged it yourself that the procuring agency is not known - just like _every detail_ about this mission. If it was as leaky as you'd suggest, we wouldn't be having this conversation, and we'd know _every_ detail as if it were a regular launch.

The fact we don't obviously means there are very few people who know the actual truth.
I'd like to understand _why_ you think I'm giving them too much credit and why this is impossible considering that's _exactly_ what has happened. This was a classified mission, and we have absolutely _no_ details on anything. _Everything_ was obfuscated from the reason it didn't launch in November, to confirmation of faring separation, to the darkness of the webcast (which was unusual), to whether or not this thing even exists, and whether or not there was a problem. Hence why we are even talking about it in this very thread

So maybe they have just proven your statement incorrect; this mission confirms that as of _now_ they do have the capability to pull something like this off, and will be very useful in the future. I even suspect some of the reports of it being "dead" were deliberately engineered and were part of the plan. It's not like this is something the government has never done before.

Safe to say, a few more missions like this are to come in the future.   
> Observe the reaction.

This. This. This. 

We now live in a time where there is _unprecdented_ access to real-time information and collaboration. I imagine any government wants to see the effects of launching such a secret mission and how the community responds, especially on sites like reddit, twitter, facebook and such...I'd imagine there are people collecting data about speculation and how it's being handled in the media.

This will come in handy years down the line if SpaceX (or another provider) really does need to handle another secret mission. Certainly data a government would want to have, since being able to launch unknown payloads into orbit is a pretty big deal when it comes to protecting your nation.
One thing people need to remember is the United States now has access to one of the most technologically advanced Space agencies _in the world_. In fact, no other provider can even compete at this point. With the rapid pace SpaceX develops engines and first stages, the fact they can reuse them, and how quickly they can turn around launches (albeit on different pads) gives the military access to an unprecedented utility.

_Nobody_ in this community, or the media, will know what happened on that flight. _Everything_ is pure speculation, and even the "official" word is just the line they're playing, it may not be the truth. 

I do not think this mission was actually meant to launch in November. _Everything_ about this mission was designed to mislead and send a clear message to other nations: we may/may not be launching payloads you may/may not have information on, and we can mislead the public, and even _you_ about what _our_ cooperative Space agency does _for us_.

Heck, one commenter even said they may have launched an empty payload into orbit; entirely plausible, and something SpaceX has the capability of doing. Maybe the military/branches of government are studying the reaction of the media, social networks (like Reddit) and other countries to see if/how they respond. The cost of a dud launch would not even come close to the value of the possible intel they can learn from this.

Do not think you can infer _anything_ from this mission, it's utterly meaningless, and was more a test of SpaceX's capabilities in handling such a secretive launch. Maybe SpaceX and other agencies have 'passed the test' similar to that of crewed dragon, and _now_ they will be allowed to actually launch _the_ most secretive of payloads (where not even a single detail is allowed to be leaked).

Certainly an interesting mission, and one that has clearly worked in SpaceX's favour.  
> The battery life is pretty incredible on this device

Baring in mind this phone is using a brand new Lithium Ion battery and you say

>  I came from a Galaxy S6 that rarely lasted more than 6 hours

How long did your S6 last when you had it in its first few months? Of course the battery degrades over time, so it's not a fair comparison.

A better, more useful comparison is how long it lasts over the course of its life and what the drop off is. I'd like to see a phone which delivers 6-7 hours SoT even 3 years after purchase. But I guess that wouldn't be profitable for manufacturers. 


I wanted to add to this that it is not strictly fair to blame the UK government for handling user input - that still remains a science that we have yet to perfect, and handling user input/data is _hard_.

The problem comes from changes in codes/formats over time - the way a code is presented, whether it uses numbers/letters, the range, the format (upper case, dashes, spaces) all make up the overall format of the data. Making a computer 'smart' enough to recognize a format the same way a human can is really really difficult.

Another example, you can now have an email like tnorthover@iamverysmartandi.rock - that can be an actual valid email address, there are _hundreds_ of new domain extensions (.website, .codes, .tech) and, if there is a legacy system coded naively by _todays_ standards, it will break. The major problem in this case is that over _time_ the acceptable options have changed, and the format of the data has changed, a domain TLD is no longer .com, .net or .org which are all three letters, but can be variable lengths, and, what about _this_ domain:

❤️🍺.ws

this gets translated to

[http://xn--xj8h.ws/](http://xn--xj8h.ws/)

Yes, that is an _actual_ domain, paste it into your browsers address bar :)

However, these systems were programmed in a _time_ where these were invalid domain extensions, so it made sense. There are still websites which use such regex and those emails are counted as 'invalid', the bigger issue is if the server side validation logic throws that email out which can't be bypassed.

So how do you validate an email address? The answer is, you _can't_. Not with the sheer amount of combinations that are now possible, it's simply not feasible. The same with IPv6, compared with IPV4:

v4: 192.168.0.0  
v6: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

And there are _many_ variations of what a v6 address can be. Heck, we now have letters _and_ colons! So now _every_ legacy system on the planet _must_ be updated to support v6, and understand its formats, otherwise, v6 may throw up errors. One example is a database expecting the ip_address format to be that of v4 and getting v6, a colon will not be expected!

So long story short: validation is hard yo.
> A few were even just parked outside because there wasn't anywhere better to put them

It's simply hard to fathom they've been _so_ successful they can just discard them like "meh". How quickly it's become the norm. 
Clickbait from the Verge as usual - seems we're continuing in 2018 as we did last year. 

Other web browsers are free to implement the standards as they wish. Chrome 66 has a score of 310 and Edge 17 a score of 245 (caniuse.com), and that is purely MS decision to make.
> but Edge outperforms Chrome in almost all JS-related things

Except for actually supporting JS-related things. Service Workers have _only_ been added in Edge 17 (releases in March), _2 years_ after Chrome.


He won't.
Hmm yes, let's compare a _multi billion_ company to a multi million company. Skype may be up 24/7 but it's a graveyard over there =).
I forgot I need to ask permission to do as I please with a device I own...Oops.
People don't realise just _how_ expensive running a video hosting company is.

1: Uploading a video - servers to ingest, reliable code  
2: Converting a video - thousands of servers to transcode into formats ranging from 240p to 8k.  
3: Storing - hard drive space is not cheap, probably 2-3 EB by now.  
4: Bandwidth - shoving 8k video down the pipe is not easy, and requires cooperation from many network providers.   
5: Upkeep - 24/7 access to _every_ single video, has to be streamable within _seconds_.  

Yeah, there's a few _billion_ there at least.

Youtube will never be profitable. 
Because Google wants Amazon to play fair? If Amazon wants a Google service on their own streaming device, they should sell Google's own products on their store. What if Google decided to remove Amazon from Google search? That wouldn't be fair on Google's part.

Works both ways. Play fair and consumers are better off.
> They are not, however, obligated to out in the time and money to adapt their content to specific hardware.

Google are not, however, obligated to put in the time and money to adapt their content to specific hardware. So they have chosen to no longer support Amazon as it's too much of a burden for the developers. :)
Amazon said: 
"Google is setting a disappointing precedent by selectively blocking customer access to an open website"

LOL, what about selectively offering your _own_ streaming stick on your "open" website? How is _that_ not "disappointing". Rofl.
You're completely right - how can Amazon block the Chromecast for 2 years and face no consequences. Yeah, karma's a bitch.
So is Amazon not selling the Chromecast for _2 years_. I think Google is being entirely fair here.

Maybe blocking Youtube for 2 years would make Amazon realise what fucks they were being.
There's no cumming back from this.
I think you climaxed here.

Good thing the 2k38 problem will totally not be forgotten until the last minute, and mass hysteria will _not_ ensue. 

Bet it'll be the same shit as this one, people like to make a major deal out of anything.
> You rewarded poor results with business

Or, he made an investment that made the competition possible. It's all about perspective.
Honestly, what percentage chance do you give to them launching on their scheduled day? I would be frankly astounded if they launched the day they said, I can imagine any number of things causing a launch abort, since it is their first time.

If you are relying on them launching as advertised it'll be a _very_ risky game since we are dealing with rocket science :P.

If there are any delays with any process (static fire, preparation of pad for launch), take that wisely and try your best to work around that. Good luck.
The fact an ATM, an incredibly mission critical and security conscious device is running _consumer_ grade software has me greatly concerned...
I swear all FH threads should be party threads, it's so god damn exciting. Launch of the decade right here.
Do you cover your smartphones back and front cameras though? ;)
> Then discovered the backup client skipped files above 2gb.

Which basically means you didn't have a backup. It was like the time Gitlab assumed S3 had a backup but nobody bothered to check...

Less assumptions more testing _everything_, including a disaster process _itself_ to verify all systems work as intended.

People call this a 'gimmick', but the show was literally filmed this way - I think the 43rd episode overall Frank Underwood was shot and that was the start of his downfall - after his wife, claire, left him at the end of the previous season? (can't remember exactly). I mean yeah, he should've 'died', but watching it I expected the Zoe Barnes truth to be revealed and that would see him arrested, or him shooting himself. End of show.

Point was, it was set up this way, but Netflix got greedy and it backfired. Spectacularly.

Their fault.
Should have sent her a link to one on Amazon or something for a frame of reference, don't blame her to be honest.
Merry Christmas /u/MindOfMetalAndWheels and /u/JeffDujon :).
I think it's simple, just tell them "I will not answer my phone if you ring", and what can they do about it? They may call the cops but I'm sure after the 5th time the cops would have a word.

Set clear boundaries, if they are not respected you're better off without them. It's about taking back control which you absolute can and should do.

If you don't do this then I can't feel sorry for you, it's such an easy problem to resolve it just takes commitment from your side regardless of whatever the consequence may be. You need to decide if it's worth it.
This reminds me of the time Apple removed their [time remaining](https://9to5mac.com/2016/12/13/why-apple-is-removing-time-remaining-battery-life-estimates-macbook-pro/) estimates on the Mac. Next thing they'll be asking for is to hide your battery status cos that totally isn't important.

How about an AI that compares signal strength over time to other carriers and other Android devices and produces a graph that shows which is the worst (spoiler: cumcast).

But no, that'd be _too_ consumer friendly, like how Cumcast helped delete the worldwide [net index](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index) that showed which ISPs are the best/worst.

Can't be revealing too much now. Consumers might complain, can't be having that.

I really don't 'trust' smart TV's software. Imagine an API key expires, are you _sure_ whoever made your TV will push an update? What about the technology used to render the UI and show the video, does it get security updates? 

Chromecast et al are made by reputable companies, and are kept up to date automatically, are _much much_ cheaper than a Smart TV and have an entire ecosystem built around them (spotify works because of the protocol being used).

It means _exactly_ what the article says it means. By November 2018 new and updated apps _must_ target Oreo.

2019: 200mAh more, the SD855 is a good bit more efficient than the SD845, and Samsung is constantly making their own optimizations including their screens. I expect battery life to be very good.

Except releasing their kernel sources...Which ya know...Is the main point.

[This](https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/mediatek/) sums up the situation quite nicely.
Do you know which episode this was discussed on? I'm intrigued to hear his thoughts.
Well, you're the first that isn't pandering to the "lul electron suckz" circlejerk as we find here on r/programming on a monthly basis, seems the trendy thing to do. 

I agree with you though, it allows developers to write trashy applications that consume resources, since it _is_ a web browser and all that comes with that, I think it's important to note that it's the _developers_ who write the apps and _not_ electron itself, I am pretty sure you could write trashy code that performs like shit in QT too, or any language really.

It does what it's meant too well, and QT or others need to appeal to those that use Electron, which they are not doing too well at.
Electron is free, doesn't have silly licence requirements, has the entire NPM ecosystem to work with, allows you to easily share code across multiple platforms (including the web), is more friendly to contributors if it's open source, and _much much_ more popular.

I fail to see what QT has going for it...And this is proven by the sheer number of applications shipping with Electron, including Discord and VSCode. If QT was better, they'd be using that.
To clarify, on patch Tuesdays they _only_ update Edge with _securtiy features_ and possibly bugs, but they _do not_ backport platform features. If EdgeHTML 17 supports service workers, you _must_ be on Windows 10 1803 to use them.
Edge16 is the latest version of edge, what are you talking about? It ships with 1709, the latest version of windows. Edge17 is in development for release in March
Edge16 is the latest version of edge, what are you talking about? It ships with 1709, the latest version of windows. Edge17 is in development for release in March
So when IE11 is broken across the web due to old security ciphers or lack of platform features, Microsoft will effectively ship LTSB with _no_ working web browser?

Or...God forbid, they may actually make IE12 for LTSB...

...And what happens when IE11 _can't_ even download Chrome? If you use Firefox 1.0 it won't actually connect to the internet at all...
Good. It's about time. Microsoft have shown no interest in developing a serious, competent browser, as demonstrated [here](https://caniuse.com/). [This](https://i.imgur.com/27dUb56.png) is the score Edge has _right now_.

What's more impressive, is Edge is actually _worse_ than IE. Each 'version' of EdgeHTML is _tied_ to a version of Windows 10. For example, Windows 10 703 uses EdgeHTML15, therefore users on that branch won't get new platform features until they upgrade Windows, which could be _years_.

In their latest update, editing favourites was highlighted as a feature. That tells you all you need to know.
They're literally at the bottom of the fucking table [here](https://i.imgur.com/27dUb56.png) which [tracks](https://caniuse.com/) what browsers have what features.

They only ship once per 6 months.  
Each version of Windows 10 has a _static_ version of the browser, you can't update Edge in the same way Chrome does.

Edge 16 on 1709 has a new web standard feature? You won't get that on _any_ of Windows 10 version before that.
Is the app sending the password in fucking plaintext? You'd have thought they would at least encrypt it before transit.

Fucking christ this is terrible. Also, is this done over plain HTTP? I'm unsure if you can capture requests done over SSL...
> "The app can leak critical private data"

Oh shit, like phone number, location coordinates, or passwords?

> country code, device manufacturer, server provider, device’s commercial name, type of telephone network, battery level, device model number and operating system

And while they state "it can also geolocate the device user" they don't say how, or if that data is at risk.

Then they continue:

> this app can be really dangerous for users especially government employees 

Yeah, somebody working in government should _never_ load an unapproved, unvetted application onto _any_ system with confidential information - is this not obvious?


Also, the data they list should not be considered "critical, private data"; it's like a leaky tap that obviously Google has no interest in fixing (either by properly reviewing apps before getting onto the store, or not allowing apps to collect this data in the first place).

I think Google needs to move to a more context based permission system as they have done with [chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/12/nic63#permissions).

"Google Maps would like to use your location to find nearest transportation options. Allow forever, Allow once, disallow".

And, since this is Google, developers should be _fined_ and banned for life if they abuse the permissions, and collect the data in an insecure way. If you, as a developer, don't employ the right protections, you shouldn't be asking for such data.

Sadly, these posts are becoming all too common now. It's basically a weekly occurrence.
Lots of discussions about this over at /r/firefox and [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15940144).

Mozilla basically undid years of hard work in 57 by pulling a stupid PR stunt, I wonder how they are going to recover from this. Funny how this appears on my front page _right_ as I finished reading about it, I guess it is a pretty big deal.
They did - they said they didn't care about the comments. No decision was made as a result of these comments.

The FCC knew the comment system was crap, and there were probably Russian coders who knew how to submit comments using a script.
> have shit tons of proof the fcc is physically commenting and voting for people.

Where is that proof then? Would said proof win in a court of law? I haven't seen it yet.
To be honest, I highly doubt it. If it was, could Google cache exist? Or how about proxy services, or even Cloudflare which sits between you and the website, and injects its own code before serving it to the visitor.

If you were taking hidden, _private_ data then that may be different. But if there's an API then I think it's fair game. And besides, there's not really much you can do about bots anyway, up to the webmaster to try and block them.

People freebooting content such as videos is a much bigger problem, but people (like theladbible) get away with it on Facebook where the author isn't mentioned in the video/image itself...
I am intrigued by how 'twitchy' they will be and whether they've set their parameters higher than usual. Being the first heavy and most anticipated launch ever I can imagine Elon wanting to take it down just to make absolutely sure. "You _did_ check that right?" after the 5th time :P.

Because they _really_ can't afford for this to go wrong.
But muh nazi mods. Who do we blame now?

My security patch is November 2017 so not yet, but I'm sure they'll update the security patch soon.
A patch was released on the following AOSP versions:

If you have the December patch on _any_ of those versions you are protected.
But as XDA wrote at least you should be able to boot stock AOSP image and makes ROMs much much much easier to develop.
Blu does a good job of that even without Treble.
As my username suggests, I will always advocate for use of technology, however, depending on the situation and personal circumstance will depend on whether it's appropriate. It sucks, but I imagine they've seen such news reports "addicted gamer spends all day in bedroom", and want to prevent another situation like that occurring.

It's like anything, drugs, smoking, anything that has a hook to feed the part of your brain that wants to escape a shitty situation. That said, however, it should absolutely be encouraged and if this guy was a decent foster parent, moderated in the right way.

Sadly I can see how people who just watch/read sensationalistic news get their opinions from.

That's just fluff and you know it. Typing those words is easy, keeping it secure and private is the hard part. If they didn't say that nobody would install it.

Have SpaceX revealed _anything_ about the payload at all? I'm under the impression they're not allowed to officially say _anything_ about the payload at any time, for any reason, ever, hence why it was a "fairing issue". It's their most secretive launch to date, obviously they're being tight lipped about it.

[This](http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/zumapresskit.pdf) is the press kit. The word "payload" isn't even in the PDF. For SpaceX it's essentially "this payload doesn't exist, you will pretend it never existed and no details must ever get out."
Why would they static fire the rocket and delay the launch by 2-3 months for a fairing issue, and then have 2 more launches in 2017. It doesn't make sense that the fairing issue can't be resolved in 2-3 weeks and get the payload deployed.

Clearly something else at work here. This is a secretive mission after all, SpaceX are probably not allowed to detail anything about the payload/customer itself.
> Sure, but isn't listing sources and datasets what we do here?

Yup, absolutely.

> Our search works well and if you are looking for something specific there won't be too many options to go through.

Reddit search has been famously awful for pretty much everything, the irony of being a place to share datasets is trying to _find_ the dataset you're looking for, and that always starts with a search.

> Why would it be our concern at all? As long as the links posted here point to the (correct) datasets.

Ideally, datasets should be hosted on a number of services, I'd love nothing more than to see each post contain 1-2 backup links rather than relying on one provider, nothing worse than doing a search and finding a bunch of dead links.

Kaggle makes it easy to host data, but there's more than just kaggle being posted, data.world is another, and is worse in the sense you don't even get to see previews unless you register. My personal vision is to enforce a set quality standard for all users who want to post a dataset.

---

My argument is essentially this: why should kaggle or any other provider that providers a 'wall' get exposure over another that does not? kaggle is searchable in and of _itself_ on their website, so is it fair to have every kaggle dataset posted here? that would just yield a bunch of links to kaggle which doesn't achieve much.

However, reserving the actual 'dataset' flair, or banning them altogether, ensures that those who want to find a 'dataset' _always_ get a consistent experience; no matter the results, _all_ of them are _free and open_. 

Changing the flair to 'freewall' or similar wouldn't do any harm and would encourage quality links over just posting links to anywhere.

The idea behind 'freewall' was that it's all inclusive; any wall between you and the dataset would be classed as a 'freewall'; some may not require a user registration but an email address or disabling an adblocker for example, which would constitute a 'freewall'. I'd agree with using "paid" for a paid dataset.

also, searching for "requires sign up" on reddit would be tricky, freewall is short and simple (flair:"freewall") and makes it easier for users to know what datasets they are likely to see in the result set.
Thank you for your suggestion - I just added a second proposal based on your idea called a 'freewall', which I think would be reasonable. What are your thoughts?
A flair sounds like a reasonable approach to paid datasets. 

In regards to kaggle my concerns are as follows:

* Searchable via their own website
* Allowing one website to 'dominate' is bad for users
* Other datasets are hidden when users search
* We are not sure what their business practices may be in the future

People can find kaggle datasets on kaggle, having them return on reddit yields no benefits (in my opinion) over having free, direct downloads

You say it's a "JOKE" but surely your example requires a user to have physical access? Is there an OS on the planet that is immune from potential physical-access vulnerabilities? At that point all bets are off, you could just as easily steal the HDD and do some voodoo on it to extract its contents.
What if I could login as root by pressing the ok button 1337 times? What if I can login holding down the enter key for $periodOfTime.

I do agree it should have been caught but code works is mysterious ways and it may not be a straightforward, obvious bug to find in the code.

Sometimes the hardest bugs to find are the ones hidden in plain sight, there were similar problems with CSGOs hitboxes earlier this year; the bug was easy and obvious yet took years to discover...

Code isn't easy.
I don't get this logic. It's like saying Google has to support Kitkat on the next S9 phone; Nougat and Oreo sure, but anything older and you're out of luck.

Due to the length of time between windows releases (4 years, vs 1 year for android) it would be totally unrealistic to expect new processors to support older versions of Windows.
Isn't that illegal? I mean if you were caught allowing a user to download pirated movies that could've been big trouble. That's supposed to be done on home connections only.
> avoid bringing love drama to work matters  

from the article:

> with a woman who worked under him and filed a complaint to HR.

So that drama was brought to the workplace, and therefore Google is expected to act in such a situation. We have no other details, but Google is absolutely not at fault here.

You're right, it's not Google's business, but if they somehow find out and you've violated their policy, it absolutely is. Those are the rules they made and either you hide it, or risk the consequences.
Google or anywhere else wouldn't give a flying shit if it was somebody outside the company. But there is room for conflicts of interest and can lead to potential problems within the company. Hence why they want you to move departments. It's not unreasonable and hey - you can always leave if you so desire. You're working for a company that knows more about you than you do about yourself, there are no surprises here.

Shit sucks if your relationship clouds your judgement or alters behaviour vs another employee that you don't care much for, it is not a good environment to be in.
Yeah...Buy a shit brand, expect shit service. Although [Apple allows you to login with root without a password](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7g6y06/anyone_can_login_as_root_with_empty_password_on/) so LOL maybe that isn't so true.
/u/jenmsft sets look like a useful feature, what'd also be useful is if we could save the apps in multi-desktop mode. If my PC reboots it's a chore to remember what was open, and what desktop it was on.

Even just storing the names of apps that were open on desktop 2,3 or 4 would be useful to allow a user to 'restore their multi-desktop session', similar to chrome which remembers each tab you have open.
I find things like this interesting - with SpaceX being the leading provider this year, launching and _landing_ more rockets than anyone else, I'd have hoped they'd be raising enough cash to get them started on their journey towards a lunar base and mars; I'd love to see major tech firms like Google and Apple (the former who already invested $1b) help SpaceX out. I mean, SpaceX should be raising _tens of billions_ at this point, we should be literally throwing money at them, as they are the only provider _in the world_ with the technology and ability they have. I worry if money is a bottleneck we (humanity) may be missing a golden opportunity as it presents itself that we may later regret not fully utilising.

Their satellite constellation is going to require _many_ launches, and is a project that if successful, will help humanity in ways we can't comprehend today, so there's a motivation to kickstart a major development in terms of global internet access, a crucial resource in the modern world.
...Yes? Why wouldn't they? They're still making rockets, and plan to fly the heavy soon, and in theory, many more times. They are eying a lunar base, and wanting to put humans on mars.

So yes, they need every nickle and dime they can possibly get, it's going to be expensive.
"ruining"? I mean there's not much you can do about it. If you are even aware enough to know about tracking you know that whilst you can _try_ to block them there will _always_ be ways to get your data, even with JS disabled (logging http requests for example, cookies, canvas tracking).

If you want to use the internet, you accept these terms and conditions, because these trackers are for sure not stopping and don't give a damn about yours or my opinions.

The internet was "ruined" the day JS was invented, from there it's all downhill.
Oh so you're an edgelord, got it.
The irony when using Firefox focus and it says that link blocked 17 trackers. There is nothing new in this article; data is the new currency and has been that way for over 10 years. If I make a website or app, I for sure will collect as much data as I can from my users, whether they give permission or not, it's too valuable not too.

Before you downvote me, open devtools on desktop reddit.com and search for e.reddit.com. even they agree ;).

P.S thanks to everyone who doesn't have blocking software installed, I and many other data firms appreciate it :)
Which is why we need to get Linus to record tens of thousands of hours of speech, and written words, as well as his beliefs that we can wire into a neural network to make Linus decisions :P.

With enough data it may be possible...sadly, I doubt it'd work well in the future without it understanding context.

> and I do have true privacy.

LMFAO! You honestly think MS/Apple have "illusion" of privacy and Google/Android gets a free pass? Holy shit man.

Data is the new money, it's a currency worth a _lot_ to the right people; learn linux, compile source code yourself (after verifying it of course), check checksums and only then will you have the privacy you're after.

Anything else, you can assume, at _some_ point in the chain, you are losing your privacy. Heck, even being on reddit they collect a _lot_ of metrics; just check the network requests/cookies, they track every thread you visit, and send info to e.reddit.com.

Don't non-lts only get a few months of support? So Canonical will support the kernel (for everyone) for many years? So it becomes a 'de-facto' LTS?

2 months ago I started an [Oreo tracker](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/6zef8m/android_oreo_and_treble_update_tracker/) to track the progress of OEMs updates to Android. This will also serve as a historical effort to see which OEM is the fastest.

I've decided to centralize all of these in a subreddit so it's easier to maintain. You are welcome (and encouraged) to submit fixes if anything is wrong/missing, since my time is limited to fully track all devices/OEMs.

Hopefully this is useful to some, I plan on tracking from Oreo onwards.
Thing is you're enabling her behaviour and by doing so, supporting what she is doing. I understand _why_ and you have genuine concerns but it's also keeping you attached to _her_ illness that absolutely will have an affect on your mental health...

It's not an easy step to take but I feel the right one is not to support this in any way... considering that $500 is basically life support, are you willing to continue paying for the next x years? That's a lot of money you can better place elsewhere rather than keeping useless stuff.

It's _her_ problem not yours, please let go no matter how difficult and the consequence...
I'm not a hoarder, but a few months ago I went through my possessions and tossed out some admittedly useless school books, like science, history and older papers. I never looked at them, but it was difficult due to the attachment and memories they contained. I never looked at them, I didn't care for them, but they were _there_.

Tossing away an old useless item is tossing away those memories, that at some point were a point of my life; it's gone forever. 

However, I realise, unlike hoarders, that stuff just needs to _go_. It sucks, but these days, if I _realllly_ care, I could get digital copies made where possible (if it's a physical item I can remember what it was/what it contained).
"Either we go through a minimum of 5 boxes _a day_ or I'll reduce the amount I am paying for storage by $10 _a day_. If you can't find that money, the bill won't be paid."

It's not a good look to ship last year's OS on a phone 3 months after the latest OS is released.

Sadly, due to that reason, this is a phone to skip
So? There's an external battery pack if you want to power your device. Who needs a built in battery anyway?

Everyone shits on electron but it does what it's supposed to, and at least lets an app exist, not everyone can write native QT or whatever is required for each OS.
Why then, is electron used at all? They must be doing something _right_ that QT is not. Electron benefits from both v8 and node (+ NPM), something no other alternative can match.
See people on reddit shit on electron on a monthly basis, here or r/programming but nobody has _ever_ suggested an alternative that offers what electron does but _better_. So either the community makes something better, improves electron itself, or shits on what is for now, the most superior option in terms of cost, time and availablity, using familiar languages and tools to make cross platform applications.

Of course I always get downvoted for this but such is the way of Reddit.
Congratulations you changed an integer in a database! Woo!
It's funny, people care about updates so much they disabled them in windows 7 and now people moan MS forces updates on people when they have the data to show people don't update their software ever.

I can almost bet if Android got updates like Windows we'd see people upvoting ways to disable the updater altogether.
This is a shocking thought, and it may blow your mind, but until 2016, there was no 'choice' to be made. You had both, and it worked remarkably fine.

Incredible really.
lmao, we're not in 2007 where this is the first time a smartphone has ever been created. Intel are working on 10nm CPUs, now _that_ is microscopic, literally.

They could've added a jack, and the teardown from jerryrig will confirm this in a few weeks. They just didn't want to because that's the cool new trend.

I guess you'll be defending Essential next. And Apple. And Google. Guess there was no room in the Pixel 2 either. Google must've defied the laws of physics in the pixel 1 then.
There are post archives available that have captured the last 11 years reddit has been online. You can even query them, for free, using Google BigQuery. So selling data isn't much of a concern.

Don't want reddit to have your data? Don't give it to them.
The fact Apple AND Google removed the jack, even though Google _made fun of Apple_; "headphone jack satisfyingly not new", remember?

There have been absolutely _no_ problems with the 3.5mm jack. Tell me, did you think it was ready to be removed? Did you guess Apple was going to remove it? I think everyone just expected it to be there as always, since it's been a thing since forever.

How handy it is for apple to own beats and Google to have their own headphones. If it wasn't about money then they shouldn't have released their own headsets to prove that was the case, and to offer everyone free dongles whenever they needed one.

But yeah, never going to happen. DRM audio is coming whether you like it or not, they're just going to spend the next few years getting us used to it before they pull their next stunt.
Bluetooth hasn't moved forwards since it was created. For a technology so old it's absolutely pathetic we still have these issues.

How do you propose stopping it? You can't rely on the law as there are very, very, very few software rulings or any in technology in general; Qualcomm basically have a Monopoly and they're not being dicked over. You can't stop a giant like Facebook or Google.
Still [using](https://i.imgur.com/coCMd6x.png) [mine](https://i.imgur.com/OpieXTZ.png). Mostly had it on standby since I use my 6P more, makes a great backup phone. Power button still works, as well as volume keys. With Nougat it has at least 3-4 more years (software wise, hardware could vary).
On the other side, I'm not given a choice to exist in the first place and also not the choice to die? If somebody wants to die they should be allowed, the most determined people do anyway and it's just a messy, painful experience. At least you'd get the control without potentially ending up crippled if it doesn't quite work out.

I mean, we all die eventually, that's how it works right? Even if we lived until 200 would it be right to force somebody to continue existing if they've had enough? What if professor Hawking's decided "I'm done"? I think his wishes should be respected.
For _you_. Sadly most of the internet disagrees with you as chrome is by far the most popular browser.

I mean, if I can get 7 months of gold for fixing a giveaway in my favour and the worst that happens is a ban then that's a pretty good trade off (depending on if you value this sub/your account).

My point still stands, _every_ giveaway should be approved by mods with sufficient proof. Maybe mods can post a "verified" comment as a sticky like they do with AMA's.

I even think the mods should pick the winner themselves (especially if it's just random commenter), and remove all potential prize fixing as much as possible.
Why did you delete this thread then? Surely the community should be made aware of when a user has scammed the community at large? It just seems like you want to bury this under the rug and not acknowledge that on this occasion the mods didn't catch this one - that's okay, you're only human, but I think transparency is key here.

I like this community, but seeing users get away with blatant lies without recourse is not PCMR.
To be honest, I think the responsibility lies on the mods in this case. Giveaways need to be approved before they are allowed to be posted here. The code should be given to the moderators and held in escrow so that the community knows it's legitimate.

I could hold a $1,000,000 steam code giveaway tomorrow and completely rig it in my favour so I actually give nothing away (after all, if you're actually smart, there's no way to prove it).

The mods need to step up and take charge of giveaways to ensure they are valid and if that can't be done, then giveaways shouldn't be allowed.
That issue isn't unique to NPM; PIP, Nuget and others can still have the same thing happen
Correct. I am subscribed to very niche subreddits. Occasionally it breaks through the cracks, as is to be expected, but actually it works very well. Reddit is good at not showing you what you don't want to see.

My Google now feed is mostly tech stuff also, but I don't check it too frequently, and I've controlled all other ways potential news can get to me.

And truthfully, life is better that way. We lived without such tools for thousands of years, no need to let them invade your space if you don't want them too :)
I've been on a news blackout for a while now, it's essentially all trash or clickbait misleading bullshit. You can't trust a single source to report nothing but the proven facts these days so why bother? Having the news in your mind achieves absolutely _nothing_.

I don't understand your point. My goal with this comment is to educate you, it's something I set myself 20 seconds before starting to write this comment.

[Cloudbleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudbleed) wants a word with you.
This is why you _always_ wait to buy the 'latest gen' phone, almost 100% of the time it's cheaper after a few months since this industry moves _fast_.

Even though it's only been a few months they feel irrelevant. That's what not releasing before the iPhone/Pixel does to you.
I think this is the penalty you pay when you jump on new technology. It'd be like buying a brand new intel 10nm after they've just started the process; there _will_ be problems with those chips and won't be perfected for at least a year if not more.

always wait for reviews, it's only the difference of a few weeks. And with the 6P, the batteries went shit after a year, maybe the pixel 1 will suffer the same fate in the next few months.

The current trend is design phone in $currentYear, release phone, 6 months later it's 'old hat', ready new phone, forget $oldPhone and rinse and repeat. Even though people tend to keep phones a lot longer these days, the same with desktop CPUs or graphics cards. 

The difference is, the QC/QA on smartphones is nonexistent and they are almost certainly not made to last that long. These panels will have issues because they are rushing them out, and _everyone_ loses in the process. But whereas intel might bin the product, LG says "mmmyeah keep it, it's crap but 'it'll do'".

Every wasted screen is wasted money, and they don't care about the consumer that gets that crap display.
ALL browsers from the last year.

So that's a no.
CPU cycles stopped being a thing back in the 32nm days. Bandwidth is also not a concern (they don't give a fuck about how poor you are or how much bandwidth you have).

Oh, you wanted just the _version_ as an integer like a normal, sane person would expect? Fuck you, it's actually the useragent.

I don't get why this is. We have JS APIs for pretty much everything. Why not a browser detection API?

browser.name  
browser.version  
browser.os  
browser.platform

Yet we're still using fucking user agents?
I think there shouldn't be a cutoff at all. Or am I nieve in thinking a 10 year old PC can still run Windows 10 is 'beyond the norm'. 

It's software, I have no idea how, after a decade of smartphones, this is still not perfection. Every smartphone should be able to run any Android version provided it passes minimum specs.
Whatever the solution is, until companies get fines and even shut down for not providing timely security updates then the situation won't improve. Regardless of cost, carriers and OEM's need to be forced into monthly security updates for a minimum of 24 on _every single device_ they sell. 

Can't make 50 phones per year (Samsung...) and support them all? Too bad. You're capped at what you can support.

Of course, good luck getting china to _ever_ agree to that.
And we rely on Google, Microsoft and Mozilla (plus many others) to do security for us (Play Protect, monthly patches, secure browsers like Firefox Focus). End users don't invest enough time into learning how to stay safe, thinking their anti-virus app and tech giants will be enough, which is sadly not the case.

And HTTPS didn't even see great mass adoption until 2015 when Lets Encrypt was launched, as we put _security_ behind a fucking paywall, who the fuck thought that was a great idea? _Paying_ to make your website secure and get a certificate? Lulwut? I don't pay for monthly security patches on my OS, I _expect_ them.

Now browsers mandate SSL in order to use 'powerful web features' and get higher search rankings. Hopefully http will be obsolete in the next 5-10 years, there's no place for it in the modern world.

What are the challenges of building such a large heat shield when this proved a serious problem for the space shuttle? How is the heat shield constructed is it made up of tiles, multiple parts or a single piece?

You have stated that the SpaceX satellite constellation would help fund the BFR. We didn’t hear anything about that at the IAC - where does that project stand?

You stated that SpaceX’s target of the first 2 cargo BFS landing on mars is planned for 2022 followed by additional cargo and crew landings in 2024. Given the roughly 5 years until that first mission, what developmental/technological mile stones in 2018, 2019, 2020, and so on are needed to meet that goal? What can we expect to see?

/u/JBWill - whilst it would've been nice to see a thread on spacex, I am even more disappointed the thread isn't going up at least an hour early to allow questions to rise and fall. This is going to be one giant clusterfuck of an AMA (not disrespecting mods, but the most successful AMAs were by victoria and more often than not had questions before the AMA started).
This.

I'm still discovering new strings, like an email to give Google feedback:

    <string name="feedback_email">pixel-nudges-feedback@google.com</string>
    
Seems like an undisclosed Pixel feature is about to make itself known?

Also, you can't email them as you get a failure notice:

Discover Weekly is absolutely incredible, I've been manually archiving my playlists for a few [years now](https://i.imgur.com/fcrCg69.png) (and yes, I know IFTTT can help me with this), and even though I'd say 75% are rubbish it can vary from week to week. I get a lot of pokemon and video game music (why?), but I've found well over 50 gems (music I absolutely love) that I am happy with how well it works.

It essentially finds the needle in the haystack but with there being 30 songs, I need to find that needle, easily done. 


"Don't get used to it" - Grey, probably.

API 27 is [Oreo 8.1](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/bionic/+/a0c7ec8080a7718c5711d9de405e039258d433bf%5E%21/#F0)
Holy. Shit. No wonder they don't make that publicly available. Anyone who respects their privacy should stay well clear of these guys. The problem is, seeing the payload (apps opened, when they were used) is different than reading some legal-type document. Really puts it into perspective.

When the data gets hacked/leaked it's going to be a delicious day watching the drama on this sub.
> Really, reddit collects way more personal data about you

You really need to provide a source/example on that. Reddit does not collect me IMEI, phone number, apps I am using, when I am using them and more.

Reddit does collect some data via e.reddit.com however, including username/useragent amongst other things, but this is _much_ worse.
It's not a circlejerk simply because you lack understanding, let's recap:

1: they store personal, sensitive information (IMEI, ***phone number,*** apps you use).  
2: They're not encrypted, only base64; the entire payload should not be decryptable.  
3: There's no opt out.  
4: We don't know how they're storing this info or if they comply with relevant legislation.  
5: If this dataset was ever leaked/hacked, it could reveal extremely sensitive information that could put actual people in danger.  
That's like asking Intel to stop releasing CPU's every year, or graphics cards, or motherboards, or basically anything else. I agree with you, but each year there are people in the market who want a new phone; iPhone 6 -> iPhone 8, iPhone 7 -> iPhone 9 (if released)/10.

As Google said in their keynote, improvements really are getting more and more marginal, and removing features seems to be their courageous step forward. That should tell you improvement and innovation is well and truly dead. 
It's not really related to Android _itself_ though, more about smartphones and internet services in general. You could also say the same about Reddit, that can become all consuming :P

Otherwise why would you read a 14~ karma post, and _comment_ on it.
> Shows off Pixel 2 camera  
> Uploads to instagram

Yeah...JPGs sure are impressive in 2017.
The S2 was released in 2011. They have updated _all_ their flagships (S, note) for 2 OS versions since that time.

I think the bias is clouding your judgement here. Their flagships _do_ get the updates, most of the complaints are how long they take to roll out.
Based on what? **_Every_** Samsung since the S2 has got _at least_ 2 OS updates.
I mean, BT 4 was released in 2014 and BT 5 in 2016, I don't see any reason why they'd use an older version apart to save costs and increase their profit margins (because they're probably not going to sell many).

This is the problem with BT. At this point BT5 should be _everywhere_. 

And, ironically enough, Google is now mandating kernel versions (4.4 for all 2017 SoC's), maybe they should do the same for BT.
BT 4.2 was released in December 2014.  
BT 5 was released June 2016.

No excuses.
Offered a £200 poundland voucher. That has to be another part of the cruel joke? I'd be suing for days for more than that pathetic gesture.
RIP letschat6
> they go from 30% to fully charged in around 10 minutes

lmao no they don't. The battery would explode if that was the case. I don't think there's a battery on earth that can charge that fast. 

And sure, that would be true if they held 100mAh of charge from the 2000mAh they shipped with. Charging that fast will get them to that point in no time.
New logo is ugly tbth
And that's not even mentioning security. No doubt in a few years Bluetooth will be hacked, or WiFi for that matter...
Possibly were so far behind. With treble, and now google mandating kernels, and the fact 4.4 kernel is good for 6 years should make it much more realistic to see longer update windows. (pun intended)
It's 3 years of updates: O (ship), P, Q and R. And that's a _minimum_, not an _absolute_. So yes, they do trust Treble, but it's too early to tell what effect it may have
Truthfully, we're at a point where any SoC (maybe give an exception to the 810 :P) can run Android for many, many years. Sadly treble didn't exist during this time as most phones can run the latest software without a hitch.

Most intel CPUs from the last decade should easily be able to run Windows 10 so it's not so much a hardware question these days but software support from various people.
Using my Nexus 5 on Nougat to type this, it absolutely screams in performance. I can only imagine Oreo would be better still.

That's the difference with android vs iOS, people always say their iPhones get slower yet my 2013 device is _faster_ than it was running official builds.
Marshmallow, Nougat and Oreo make up _exactly_ 50%, that's not bad at all
It's not possible for another OS to enter the market unless it can run iOS and/or Android apps. If devs need to code their apps for that platform, it's DOA.
>  A theoretical Surface phone running Windows 10 built with WCOS wouldn't be running Windows 10 Mobile or Windows 10 desktop, it would be running "Windows 10" with whatever components Microsoft deems fit. That may include Win32 components, or it may not.

I doubt users will be making decisions here, more like the decisions will be made for them.
If you see [here](https://www.kernel.org/category/releases.html), some kernel's, such as 3.2, 3.4 and 3.10 had between 4-6 years of support. Whoever made the decision to reduce it to 2 years was clearly not thinking properly considering how important they are to the industry. Both kernel's supported by Hutchings are already at 6 years.

Good for Greg to finally see sense.
Google is now [mandating](https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/kernel/modular-kernels#core-kernel-requirements) kernel versions.
The 2016 Google Pixel is Treble enabled. It is reasonable to expect 4 Android updates.
I think it's a fair assessment. The reason I'm skeptical is mainly due to what they need to accomplish:

1: Building the rocket - as you say, first tests late 2020's (2027-2029), possibly similar to grasshopper  
2: Test flights of the rocket (early 2030's)  
3: First manned launch (probably after many successful dragon crew missions, 2035)  
4: Very, _very_ unlikely first _ever_ launch will be successful in landing humans on mars.

Human sacrifice will need to be accepted, landing on mars is just another level more complex than the Moon, and even once humans are _there_, they are not coming back (so they will die on Mars, or trying to get there).

And even once they are there, what exactly do they do? How sure are we humans are capable of adapting? I still feel much, much more research needs to be done (with more robots traversing the planet would be an ideal starting place).
As an intriguing question, do people feel the next 9 years will be _as_ impressive? I mean, we've got landings down to a tee, reliability seems to be sound and the FH will launch (hopefully) at some point in the next year. Their Mars plans are ambitious, and I guess if they hit their targets maybe getting humans to mars in the next 9 years is doable...But I'm doubtful (just trying to be realistic, we're aware of the delays to FH).
> Google no longer wants YouTube to be a regular video data dump.

I don't really see _how_ you're coming to that conclusion. Are you saying I can no longer upload private videos? Or am I no longer allowed to upload _any_ video publicly? That is not what the article is saying _at all_.

This is about disallowing content creators to use _cards_, of which, afaik, only work on desktop (and probably already have a pathetic click rate).

I doubt this is going to affect too many people, most just shove the patreon in the description or as a URL embedded in the video (not clickable, maybe with a URL shortener)
They do. Even if they made $0 from ads, they'd still be making money. For a few years now Google is transitioning towards an AI focused company, and that relies on data as their main source of information. Being able to process this and provide useful reports can be extremely valuable; you have the data on _billions_ of users and what they like to watch, how many hours of content they consume, who they follow, their interests, and much, much more.

/u/harryyoud, just a question: should we read anything into the devices currently active on bringing up oreo? there are many commits to different kernels. I assume other devices will start seeing their changes in due course.

Or is it the case that all the devices that will be supported are 'visible' in their oreo-bringup branch? I see flo for example is working on 15.0, but there are quite a few devices (like hammerhead) that are not so visible atm.
No. No he does not. His job is to make the system, the manager's job is to train the users. Microsoft does not have to train users on how to use Windows.
Not possible - there are too _many_ variables that factor into these tests; even your physical location on earth (cell towers, radio waves, signal strength) adds extra parameters.

It's physically not possible to have a 'default test' case. Even a 'best possible' test case will have many dependant variables that it makes it impossible to judge.
Service Workers do have limits, especially in chrome: see [here](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/security-faq/service-worker-security-faq) under "Do Service Workers live forever?" and "Do Service Workers keep running after I close the tab?" for more information.

This wouldn't be possible using service workers if the page was closed.
If you're trusting one person's review entirely then you don't get to complain. The idea would be to read/watch 5-10 and make a pros/cons list that come up frequently.

Battery life **_must_** be abstracted because it's **_entirely_** dependant on use case, so taking one persons word for it is pretty stupid.
> We’ve requested our list of backers from Indiegogo in order to properly thank them

"To spam them with emails to give us money for our piece of shit rebranded chinese knock off phone they're gullible enough to pay for. We'd feel bad, but we are wiping our tears with money".

Also, "legal counsel" lol, that'd probably bankrupt them. Not a chance they'd win in a court of law (wouldn't even make it that far they'd get bitchslapped by Indiegogo so hard).

Good job XDA/AP/tech blogs, you taught these fucks a lesson; don't mess with the internet.
Guys, this is probably a controlled leak, they'll see the reactions to the price and lower it, no doubt about that.
Silence. Like their support.
Any statements don't speak for good support, hence why Samsung says shit all.
This is what happens when, like always these days, profit is put before people. I really don't envy Berners-Lee's position as there really isn't any easy way out. In his [post](https://www.w3.org/blog/2017/02/on-eme-in-html5/) linked by /u/agonnaz he basically says that sure, the W3C can disregard DRM but it won't change much, this is why we had flash and silverlight. It only makes sense to put this functionality native to the browser.

However, I do feel piracy actually offers a legitimate service, in offering access to culture and media where profits would deny that ability, and being able to preserve performances for many generations to come. When he says that access to encrypted data may be lost, he makes a valid point.

We don't live in an ideal world, and it's for us as a collective to decide the best approach to take; we have the power to distribute any media free of charge, not even Denuvo is able to stop piracy. Unless we end up with a world wide great firewall of china, then sure, the internet stops being an "inter"net.
I absolutely agree with you about the whole fetch thing, the parsing of data can also be slow, especially if you use r.text();

Why not fetch("url", {res: "json"}).then(data => console.log("I am json!"));

People seem to misunderstand this quite a bit. The reason _nothing_ is _ever_ opt in is because nobody would ever opt in. You're living in a different universe if you expect to be given control front and center.

Your choice that you are free to make, is to opt-out, by not using the service and taking any precautions required.

More reasonable would be not removing the fucking port.
Seems it's time for El Goog to drop the banhammer like they did with [WoSign, StartCom](https://security.googleblog.com/2016/10/distrusting-wosign-and-startcom.html?fucklelNOvokek) and [Symantec](https://security.googleblog.com/2017/09/chromes-plan-to-distrust-symantec.html?fucklelNOvokek). They absolutely should not allow the GPL to be violated in this way - if they face no consequences licenses begin to mean nothing, and that's extremely dangerous in the open source community.

Either play ball or they can have their Google Play Services licence revoked for new devices are are barred from selling outside China, I'm sure the hits to their profits wouldn't go unnoticed.
You actually make an interesting point - and reveal an inherent human flaw - we don't like being repetitive. Unlike the CPU, which is happy to execute the same instructions all day every day, we don't like it when things become stale. People feel they're not furthering their skills or knowledge and their career is being stifled; we put pressure on ourselves to keep "up to date" as software changes over time, from tooling to languages to best practices.

However, you approach falls apart when you think of extreme examples like SpaceX - they launch and land rockets, and they've done that extremely successfully. I am sure they are still using procedures that are years old at this point, and why change? If the process works you know to leave it well alone and avoid that temptation that it's "old and boring".

Old and boring works, and is extremely reliable but who likes old? We don't even like it when _we_ get old. But it works, it's been tested, and you know it's going to do exactly what it's meant to. Rather than trying to replace it with something new just for the sake of it, and not being totally sure what may happen.

I mean, what's wrong with just using plain old jQuery - that's old and boring, but it has an extremely easy to use syntax, and even after all the browser changes and software evolutions $("#div").hide() and .show() still do the same thing it did back in 2006. It's not hip. It's not 'fresh', but it **_works_**
The thing is JS seems to get a lot of hate for this when it isn't exclusive to the language. [Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/WebFrameworks) also has a tonne of frameworks, and so do many other languages. People build tools and ways of using a given language, that's not the problem.

The problem was your management were incompetent fools who couldn't organise a soft boiled egg. If the people making the decisions are not rational and thoughtful nor is the work the company will create.

Don't blame the tool for doing its job when you have tools making decisions.
Smartphones are not new. The headphone jack is not new. Reddit is not new. Performing actual research and analysis before releasing another smartphone in an already crowded marketplace is not new.

Yup. The 3.5mm jack is shit and Bluetooth is the best thing ever. Remind me the exploits of 3.5mm? It's k doe, Apple says BT is king now so they must be right.

For the same reason there are very, very few silicon vendors in the world, it's _incredibly_ difficult to make an OS; Windows has had control of the desktop market for decades, the _only_ viable competition is Linux which is laughably far behind (most of the corporate world is using Windows).

In an ideal world sure, we'd have 100 silicon vendors, but the OS needs to understand each silicon and it needs to work _flawlessly_, and Windows has had over 20 years experience doing just that. Android is 10 years old next year, and we're only just seeing real progress being made (treble, for example).

Only an individual with absolutely _no_ understanding of OS' development would ever make such a ludicrous statement and think it was an actual possibility.
Imagine the fragmentation, god it'd be much, _much_ worse than Androids situation. It's not possible to have many companies doing their own OS, not even Microsoft stood a chance.
Incorrect - Google has specifically mentioned that Pixels have treble support.
If you can provide a reputable source that indicates it's getting Oreo I'll add it to the list.
I've asked the mods what they think of the idea.
Thank you! Added :)
Done :)
As soon as there is a reliable source that details their plans they will be added. If you know of one please share the link :) 
I think it's incredibly relevant; more data to suggest what consumes battery means consumers can make educated decisions. Unless you have a need for data/location to be on 24/7 then you can obviously use it where required. 

The non-standard OS is kinda true, LineageOS sticks to core stock better than any other custom ROM with a few added features, I doubt they've added any modifications themselves to increase battery life.

I think it goes to show Android _is_ getting more efficient over time, because K/L/M were _horrible_ for the N5 battery wise, N and O will be for sure giving better results.
Thanks for the source, added :)
Sure, I guess it's fair to add LG's v30; not sure about any other devices though
If you have a reliable source detailing which phones are getting Oreo then sure, they'll be added.
See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus5/comments/6zap52/my_nexus_5_still_gets_better_battery_life_than_my/)
Hahaha, this has been on my mind too. There will be some sneaky OEMs who will want to avoid the plague that treble will be. Imo samsung will either delay their S9 or launch Nougat -> Oreo day 1.
Added, thank you :)
If you have a source I can add it to the list :)
> You could also choose not to update. Just saying.

Except you don't really get that choice considering Apple closes the signing windows. You're not free to upgrade/downgrade as you please.
I brought the battery a year ago, I can't remember when the battery itself was made but I got it from amazon.
Auto brightness is turned on. I don't play games, but yeah, mostly web browsing and reddit :P. As it turns out using all your device sensors/location tracking ruins the battery, who'd have thought?
I replied to another post with the details :)
Nougat, lineageOS, default kernal, battery 2 years old (27th august 2015), and disabling location, mobile data (it has an active SIM). Turn off WiFi at night.
That literally should not happen on any modern smartphone, you can keep 10+ tabs in memory these days...
I can appreciate how you may find the headphone jack useless, but I find it cute that marketing has completely won you over. Because what you have said is absolutely not true, and there are cold, hard facts to prove it - sorry about that.

This [link](http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=8064&idPhone2=6378&idPhone3=4910) sums it up nicely.

iPhone 5: 1440mAh  
iPhone 6: 1810mAh (+ 370 mAh)  
iPhone 7: 1960 (+150mAh)  

So, the iPhone 6 got better battery life _with_ the jack than Apple gained by _removing_ it. One could argue that the gains from the 6-7 were purely technological (Android phones have 3000 mAh...).

If you're expecting a "bigger" battery and 150mAh satisfies you for removing such a feature...Well...I am a nigerian prince and boy do I have an offer for you!
> average consumer doesn't care enough about to keep around.

I mean, that's not strictly true. Only an ignorant individual would use the argument "but..but...they're buying the new iPhone! They don't care afterall!"

After failing to realise the iPhone has gone through 7 generations and people are _loyal_ to the platform, it takes a _lot_ to abandon all your apps, purchases and data associated with Apple just for the headphone jack; consumers don't like it, but they are just about willing to put up with the hassle of using a dongle (because to continue using Apple, they don't exactly have a choice). People _must_ make this distinction and understand _why_ people are buying the new device, some will not care, others will but they have invested a lot into Apple, and some will be more than happy to cruise on over to Android.

Also, competition ceases to be if it's only from the outside. Who knows what Apple, Google and co get up to that we never see. It'd be bizarre to see the Pixel remove the jack after they mocked Apple with it in their ads.
No. Location disabled and all the battery saving goodies. I'm not sure what's to blame exactly, the batteries themselves? the screen (1440p vs 1080p), fast charging (more voltage/heat = shorter lifespan).

Either way, the Nexus5 is still providing better value than newer phones...
Oddly enough, [here](https://i.imgur.com/wIRN0f1.png) is my battery life from my N5; new battery about a year old. No way my 6p matches that...
> which benefits us consumers

Removing the headphone jack with no warning sure has been beneficial. I wish Flash could've died in the same way.
Wrong. Sony's phones are shipping with Oreo first.
Then again, if you look at iOS or Windows you often get many years worth of support. For example, my 2014 CPU can run any OS from XP onwards. They may not work very well but it's a possibility.

I think the hardware sells itself, as older devices get slower and won't be able to enjoy all of the new features.
One of the details these articles are not mentioning is that treble is _not finished_ yet - they are still making changes to treble in the [AOSP gerrit](https://android-review.googlesource.com/) so do not expect Oreo to be the version that will provide many years worth of updates. It's a _start_ but there are still more changes to come.

This also doesn't mean Samsung _have_ to release their updates faster. Even if their updates are complete, they can still strategically decide when to roll them out. 

ROMs may get easier to develop but you still need a device capable of unlocking the bootloader and there will probably still be changes required because as evan1123 said it does not make updating kernals any easier...

I am excited too, but I think it's important to be cautiously optimistic. Treble is still very new and as of _today_ we're not sure _what_ exactly may come of it.
Easy.

/u/TheBurtReynold webcast is live. Just letting you know.
The guy proposing this appears to be a [fruitcake](https://khaledroutingprotocol.blogspot.nl/2017/03/khaled-routing-protocol-krp.html). Not sure how such a thing reaches the ietf, but maybe they should look at not allowing such ill-thought out proposals to be posted. Here is another [link](http://ietf.10.n7.nabble.com/RE-IPv10-KRP-and-RRP-IDs-Removal-td534031.html#a534090) which demonstrates he's clearly not of the right mind to be making such proposals.

Some great discussion over at HN [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15190097)
[Lol at the code](https://github.com/iboalali/sysnotifsnooze/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/iboalali/sysnotifsnooze/NotificationListener.java#L53). Seems very straight forward, just snooze the notification forever.
HBO should just use Youtube anyway. People are pirating it regardless, might as well use the best network on the planet.
Of course. If they had/invested more money, they could design a better network. It's quite a straightforward concept to understand.
YouTube manages it just fine. They have probably never dipped below at least 500gbps for a decade now. I'm sure Google could help them out. Same goes for steam and many other services.

Yes. It's absolutely 100% a money thing. Most traffic peaks during the year when GOT is airing, I bet they wouldn't even crack 50gbps now it's finished.
Intel deserve it way, way more than Qualcomm. Intel have fucked the CPU market for way too long they need to be put in their place.
Well, considering one is the name of the latest android software and the other is a series of phones I'm going to guess they're pretty different.

Android One is simply a brand of phones, you can find more info on google.
Nobody will be able to answer that for another few years. Pixels get 3 updates anyway (the one they ship with + 2 feature updates). If they get a _third_ feature update, that would be breaking the norm.

So, to be absolutely clear:

Pixel/XL: launches with Nougat -> Oreo -> P 

Normally, that's it, it was the same for the nexus phones; 5x/6P: Marshmallow, Nougat and Oreo, they won't get P.

If the Pixel/XL gets Q, then that would be significant. 
> so I would think its safe

Nobody should ever use a program that looks like that, not even a fucking keygen.
I have no idea what the fuck that program is but you should stop using it _right now_.
I'm not sure if you downvoted me, but please can you elaborate? Treble is a requirement for any devices that ship with Oreo, and eventually (5-10 years), every mobile phone in the world would've shipped with oreo.

Do you know something I don't?
> yet we can do the same thing on our desktops and laptops for free

It's shitty, but you can bet if they were able to control that in desktop they absolutely would. A [DRM](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/8/15942238/web-drm-standard-eme-approved-controversy) standard has already been approved for the web, and there's nothing stopping google auto pausing videos if they are not in focus, there is already the [page visiblity API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Page_Visibility_API) so it's not difficult to do.


No. That's actually not how it works, at all. This is the single biggest change in Androids history, and they began working on this in 2015. I suggest giving [this](http://androidbackstage.blogspot.nl/2017/08/episode-75-project-treble-for-hal-of-it.html) postcast a listen where actual Android engineers actually talk about treble.

I appreciate you may have a previous bias, and that you feel _anything_ they do is just rubbish, but hopefully you can educate yourself and actually understand _what_ treble is, and how important it is towards making updates a more plausible reality going forward. Treble is a _mandatory_ requirement in order for devices to launch with Android Oreo. This means that from 2018 onwards (and certainly 2019) _every single phone_ that runs Oreo _will have treble_.

Eventually, every single Android phone _in the world_ will be treble enabled.

tl;dr: too early to say.

I'm honestly not sure anyone will be able to answer this _today_. I think we're going to need to wait 1-2 years and a few platform updates before we really understand what treble provides. This also includes ROM developers who will be getting up to speed on treble and how it all works.
Sure, you can do that. The one thing I love about software is that while it's possible to use old versions _indefinatley_ there comes a point where you will have no choice to upgrade. Whether it's windows, android, iOS, chrome, firefox, and even programming languages. Sure they may _work_ on old versions, but just try using firefox 2 today, it won't work.
> I think we have to close it down and re-build it from scratch.

Yet this is the _exact_ thing Mozilla has been doing and is being criticized for? I am really confused what you're trying to say here and can only assume you're a troll.
That's fine, but when this thread is archived in 6 months, and version 57 has been out for a few years I'm sure the ecosystem will be in a much better position. Going through change _today_ is always difficult, but by the time we're on 65+ it will seem like a distant memory.

Check back here in a few years and see whether your statement holds true, I am going to predict not.

God damn it, I've been checking this every day for at least a week now. Good to see it's finally up, let's dig in and see what new things have been added.
3.10.73 on the 6P.
Yes
/u/KeyserSosa how will this affect the API docs? At the moment each doc has a "view code" link, if that's no longer being updated it might make sense to remove those links from the documentation.

Also this text

> The reddit API and code are open source. Found a mistake or interested in helping us improve? Have a gander at api.py and send us a pull request.

Should be deleted.
> I was simply correcting him

You did not make a correction. A correction would be "do not disable the update service."
I doubt that's actually true 'treble', since it requires work from qualcomm's side.
Yes, but those devices need to support and pass the new [VTS](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/vts/) which requires a lot of underlying changes. This is why all devices that _ship_ with 8.0 _must_ pass the VTS.

The new Sony phones ship with 8.0, meaning they will support treble.
No. It's a deeper architecture change that's required by OEM's. So no LOS devices will get treble. 
You seem to think they weren't even trying before, and also, have you ever considered the reality that maybe they simply _didn't know_ what the solution was? This idea may have just come up from one random engineer in a routine meeting and may have been partially dismissed as a stupid idea ("you guys might think this is crazy but what if we...")

We've only _just_ got the technology to land rockets back on land and at sea, and they didn't start until a few years ago trying to recover them in the first place. It took them so long because the fundamental understanding has only just come to light on how to make it possible and all the systems that need to work together have been created. You can bet they were trying to do this for many years already...

This is what R&D is. People just think all problems need solutions tomorrow because "it's $currentYear, why can't we do $x yet". Sometimes it takes time to make an actual solution that is scalable and works to the expected standard. Most users have absolutely no idea just what is required, I doubt anyone on this sub can [explain what this is](https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/treble) and throughly understand how it all works.

I absolutely bet the day cancer is cured people's response will be: "what took them so long? They only just started working on the cure?". People are just completely clueless how these things work.
I _love_ the fact SpaceX are now confident enough to release this, which was previously unheard of them doing. I think it must be humbling to look at your failures with the major success they've had this year.
Is it too wishful to assume there are 8k copies of this footage from multiple angles? Because that would be awesome.
Yup. My bad. I guess they should've just pressed that magic button. How stupid am I. They had the solution all along. They haven't had to do the biggest change in android's history, that's all fake.

Sorry for bothering you. You are clearly right.
They started in 2015 with Treble, so please don't act like you know what you're talking about. There wasn't just a magical button they could press they said "next day android OS on all phones from 2016 onwards!". Many, many people have had to work together to even make treble a possibility due to the sheer complications with Android and OS in general.

People seem to forget R&D are a thing, and only _now_ has that R&D paid off and they have a solution that's actually viable. If iOS ran on over 10,000+ devices they would face the _exact same issues_
Bluetooth was invented in 1994. It's already 23 years old. I guess in 100 years we should remove the CPU, RAM, screens and just have fucking implants in our head.
/u/fuckswithducks...your paradise awaits!
> premium build quality  
> performance

>  no phones have actually arrived

Yeah, let's not jump to conclusions here, I'll wait for a number of actual real world users to give their opinion first. This phone is still a concept until it actually gets into the hands of consumers, something that's not happening yet. Also, we won't know just how "premium" it is until 1-2 years pass and see how it holds up.
It was amazing watching the circlejerk over the years over that phone, at first it was a positive jerk then slowly over time it became a more negative jerk and now they're just another manufacturer and people are quick to point out their just a subsidiary of OPPO, and they were never the 'small startup' they made out to be with their stupid invite program to generate fake hype.

This guy makes a brand new phone which is difficult enough, makes false promises he can't deliver on, tries to get some good PR through, and launches it without what some consider essential features (headphone jack for example) and essentially (...) becomes a meme of a phone.

That's not exactly what you want when you're new to the market. I doubt this phone will shatter any records when you've alienated the market _before_ the phone is even in consumers hands, I mean that's just impressive.
Ever thought your shower head just wants validation? It puts on all its talent and probably doesn't get appreciated enough :(

\#showerheadlivesmatter
I think he, and we, by extension, are quickly figuring that out. Reminds me of the whole OnePlus invite fiasco, which turned me off their brand for life. First impressions matter, and count for a lot. In addition you really, _really_ don't want to piss off the technical crowd who are likely to recommend devices to those that don't follow these things so closely. Creating a phone is a lot more difficult than just specs on a page, there are _so_ many pieces and moving parts, and if any one falls over, that leads to delays and angry press pieces like the one we're commenting on :P
The _only_ reason this phone has had _any_ traction is simple due to the figure behind it. Anyone else wouldn't even get past 10 upvotes on this sub, and so far I don't see anything special about what they've created, only those essential memes.
So what, you thought $6000 is all it takes to get people to watch your video on Youtube and then what? You're famous? Your career explodes? I am not so sure what you expected...
> I KNOW I got talent I could provide links to prove that

It's not about _you_ though, it's about your _audience_. You could think you're the greatest thing since michael fucking jackson, but if your audience disagrees or is non existent then it means nothing.
No. The users are dicks because they do not understand this is not meant for them. I'd also not release anything until it was working, fuck regular users.
Although people do have [troubles](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160325-the-names-that-break-computer-systems) with this. Must be a real unfortunate name :P
If anyone has a theme that _only_ changes the notification bar to black you'll get my business. Bonus points if it can automatically apply at night and go back to white during the day :D. I'd _love_ contextual theming with something like tasker.
RIP HL3
I think if theming is going to happen it will be in 8.1 launching with the Pixel 2, with subsequent 8.0 patch releases to follow over the next few weeks. We know 8.1 exists as there was a Pixel 2 document floating about with a search bar in the settings app that was new.
Beautiful thread u/Nsooo, hopefully other hosts copy this one in the future, thanks for hosting!

Using built in code from Oreo...
Can I just tweak the white status bar to be black at night and leave it at that? I don't want to have to change the _entire_ system theme, just the blinding white status bar at night.

If the protocol is shit all codecs are automatically shit. It's like VP9 over SSH...
How about things stay the same whilst improvements are made to the competing standard that's being forced upon us? I guess that's the less profitable approach though
So where are the Bluetooth apologists who _constantly_ say BT is better than the 3.5mm jack? If you want to replace a _flawless_ jack with BT, it better be incredible on every damn phone from the last decade, which it's not.

Therefore BT is shit.
/r/datasets
Which in the end is a good thing, because users are more likely to leave bad reviews and encourage best practices. What FB is doing is obviously not best practice.
Interesting the build is a few months old already
>  it's really an incremental update

Apart from, you know, this being the biggest architectural update in Androids history. Yeah, just another boring update. 

It's the changes you don't see that are changing a lot of what happens under the hood.
Where are the roms? It's been out for 60 seconds and I can't see any at XDA...Wtf?
Cool, thanks for the replies. As always I assume the work will be 'visible' on gerrit so people can follow along? Presumably in an 15.0 branch. :D
/u/harryyoud since this is LineageOS' first Android update since N, how do you plan to handle the transition? Will work still take place on N for a few more months? I'd love to still get N updates while you guys work on O...I'm not sure if the inbuilt updater can take care of multiple versions...Also, will devices on N get N updates forever, or will they stop once the O weeklies are out?
No. They'll launch in Taiwan then take 6 months to release in US

> Look, the dude didn't know what Git does.

Right, so at that exact moment your very first thought should be: "Hmm, I may not know what this does, better backup _justttt_ in case". But nope, he decides to click away and gets caught out. If he had backed up we probably wouldn't be having this conversation. I agree the UI can be made clearer but he should've known better as a software developer, there are so many ways to lose your work it is actually idiotic to not make 3-2-1 backups to be extra safe.
The problem here is that VSCode is making such a complex tool easily accessible, and, in my opinion, at that point it becomes the responsibility of the UI; it should be prefaced with "this feature can cause some irreversible damage, by clicking yes to continue, you take full responsibility for any damage caused"
> The software could've prevented this major mistake.

Sure, and you try to make things idiot proof and the world will invent a bigger idiot - there's no winning here. If not this then something else and somebody blames their tools for doing their job. These were work files according to the article, who the fuck doesn't back up work files?
I love all the people who are blaming the software here - sure, it _may_ have been at fault a bit, but who the fuck writes code for 3 months and doesn't take the _5 second_ step of adding it to an archive? 

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. This guy learnt a lesson. Always. Make. Backups.
That's the industry's problem to sort out, maybe the artists should think about ways to solve that problem and start vocalising about how stupid these fucks are.
What better way to show your disdain than to not give these fucks even a dime of your money?
Taking content online is far easier, an automated program could do it anonymously ;)
One of the risks of putting content online is that it may get stolen/downloaded for free, it's not right, but there's not a whole lot you can do about it. I guess the idea is to use a watermark that a program can't remove...
Lmao, obvious clickbaiting is obvious. It's Oreo.
Although, unlike any generic sweet like Lollipop or Nougat, this is a brand name like Kitkat, which iirc they didn't leak before hand, and legal would never ever let Google use Oreo as a 'troll'. This was probably signed off months ago...
Apple was selling 16GB phones as recently as the iPhone 6S in 2015, only _now_ is 32GB the default. With 4k movies becoming ever more popular and storage demands increasing, I think anything below 64GB will be a struggle (4k video recording, photos, music, movies, apps, games etc). Charging a premium for storage (IMO) is bullshit when SD cards provide a cheaper ability to move files around locally, and they are plenty fast enough for movies and such.
> ...And there's just not really many flashy new features there in O for the average person.

That's because each year there is only so much time to add new stuff. They did this from L-N, and this time, they decided that attempting to solve one of Androids biggest flaws was worth the sacrifice of other major changes they could have made. If you listen to [this](http://androidbackstage.blogspot.com/2017/08/episode-75-project-treble-for-hal-of-it.html) postcast about treble, you will understand this is the single biggest change in Android _ever_, yet it's completely transparent and users/developers won't even notice anything because it's all underlying architecture stuff.

Being able to make updates get to more devices for longer will revolutionise android. It'll benefit users (security, newest features) developers (users on latest APIs, no more support library) and will benefit the platform massively over the next decade. I can almost guarantee the distribution charts will look entirely different as we enter the next decade as more and more people get the latest release faster. 
> it's going back to the store.

Why would it even leave the store? I don't get people like this. Just wait 2 god damn weeks and see what reviewers have to say, _look_ at _actual photos_ taken by the device _before_ buying if that's your criteria. I swear people shouldn't be allowed to return phones just because something is 'mediocre' when they can just wait it out.

It's like buying a tesla and saying "if this doesn't get 1000 miles per charge it's going back!". lol.
That's because companies, like Apple and Google, want your data in the cloud for them to datamine. Not sitting on a local SD card. ;)
If it launches with Android O yes, if not, not necessarily (that's up to the OEM). All phones released with Android O will have treble.
Sure, but you're not stupid as a consumer. Google _knows_ software is a key selling point, and treble benefits themselves as much as the wider community. Think about the value a Pixel gives if it gets 5 Android OS updates, and everyone else is still doing 2, maybe pushing 3. There's more incentives now because of what the competition may be providing.

Maybe someone releases a Nexus 5 like phone and is able to provide years worth of updates/security patches because of treble.

So yes, now most of the major technical debt has been paid, it's time to see which vendors hop on board, and we'll soon see those that do (good, worth buying) and those that don't (shit support, worthless trash phones to be avoided).

This move single handedly allows Google to begin penetrating the lower end market, where people hold onto their devices for longer (hence Froyo, Gingerbread and ICS taking so long to disappear from the distribution charts). This should put Google in an incredibly advantageous position if they relaunch their Android One program with treble, for example.
> I am not convinced that Treble would have any actual impact for consumers.

_**ALL**_ new devices shipping with O will _have_ to pass a VTS (vendor test suite) that conforms to treble. Every single phone from O onwards will have treble so, essentially, any person who buys a phone 2018 onwards (S9, OP7 etc) will benefit from this.

So, by say 2025 everyone should have a treble enabled device. It sucks that it doesn't apply to every device on the upgrade path natively, some vendors might to get a selling advantage, but at least you know by the time you get your new flagship it'll be using treble.
Fuck skype. I've moved to discord now after the mobile update bullshit. Good riddance. 
> you should have dropped mysqli_*

People should have dropped writing _manual_ SQL years ago too, obviously there are use cases and all that, but for the average user, something like [eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/eloquent) is so much more expressive and handles _everything_ for you and has been vetted by so many people.

SELECT *  
or  
User::find(1)

If you're using $db->prepare (mysqli or PDO) it's probably worth your time looking into ORM's/frameworks that abstract this ancient code away and provides a much easier to use syntax.

Question: Is it feasible to wonder if we will ever see 'native' TS like we do today with JS? That is, you can just use <script src='file.ts'> or node app.ts and it 'just works'? Or will the language forever need compiling back to regular JS?

An additional to that: is it feasible to wonder whether some TS features will ever make their way to ESnext in the future? Perhaps adding native types to JS (which I guess is the main selling point of this language).

As an aside, as a 'simple' JS developer, seeing C#-esque code like this:

    public then<U>(success?: (value: V) => Promise<U>, error?: (err: any) => Promise<U>, progress?: ProgressCallback): Promise<U>;
    public then<U>(success?: (value: V) => Promise<U>, error?: (err: any) => Promise<U> | U, progress?: ProgressCallback): Promise<U>;
    public then<U>(success?: (value: V) => Promise<U>, error?: (err: any) => U, progress?: ProgressCallback): Promise<U>;

    public then<U>(success?: (value: V) => U, error?: (err: any) => Promise<U>, progress?: ProgressCallback): Promise<U>;
    public then<U>(success?: (value: V) => U, error?: (err: any) => Promise<U> | U, progress?: ProgressCallback): Promise<U>;
    public then<U>(success?: (value: V) => U, error?: (err: any) => U, progress?: ProgressCallback): Promise<U>;
    public then<U>(success?: (value: V) => U, error?: (err: any) => void, progress?: ProgressCallback): Promise<U>;
    

Does make me weep a bit, I have absolutely no idea wtf is happening there :P
    for (var i = 0; i < 100000000; i++) {
                    url = url + i.toString();

I literally said that. My dispute is that several times a week is completely absurd even as somebody who sees all that SpaceX has accomplished that's taking it too far.
> several times a week in the near to medium term

I think that's being wayyy too generous. They've only flown a used booster twice and that took a number of months before they were happy to launch it again. Their quickest single pad turnaround is 12 days, or 2 days across 2 pads.

I think they will be able to fly more frequently, but I think we're years away from seeing anywhere near the cadence you're supporting. Let's try and go a whole year with an improved cadence and no RUDs first, then start scaling up.

For those wondering, [here's](http://i.imgur.com/xMz5cVx.png) a screenshot of the video player that the person used to record the episode, there are no spoilers in that image.

How does this happen? HBO needs to upload and test their content on all service providers, this needs to be done _days_ in advance, depending on the level of testing required (perhaps simulations of high traffic loads, network testing and such).

I guess some person on the backend flicked the 'public' switch to true - even if only for a few minutes, in the information age, that's all that's required.


Plane crash corner? Haven't had one of those in a while and I know how much you love that grey :P
Incredible. I think quite honestly this launch is actually greater than _anything_ we've ever done before, even bigger than man on the moon.

This will be the single greatest launch mankind has ever attempted, and we're just over a year away from that launch. Incredible stuff.

> and can't actually link that IP back to your original location;

Not via the IP itself, no. But if you have _ever_ used your original IP before the chances are, Google has got that saved, even if it's from 10 years ago, you can't remember, but Google can. Visited a webpage that uses Google fonts with your true IP? Logged. Made a request on a website that uses a hidden pixel and didn't take _every_ precaution (including disabling JS)? Logged and logged again.

Yeah. You're not fooling Google. They know every VPN IP in the world, they know every user that uses a VPN, they know how to link VPN traffic back to your real IP, and they can absolutely make distinctions between them. Even if 10 people used the same IP and made thousands of simultaneous requests and you tried _everything_ to anonymize yourself, Google has the tools capable of figuring that out and being able to link it straight back to you.

When you control the world's most popular search, maps, mobile OS, entertainment sites and basically the entire Internet, you get that power.

Your VPN anit hiding shit from Google.
If a inanimate thing could file a lawsuit I think the coffee absolutely would. 
/u/emoney04 I do have one question about this: have you thought about the effects this may cause for content creators if their videos got posted? I don't want to shit on yet another reddit change, but I really hope you're not planning on ever allowing this over at /r/videos or other like-minded communities. People _rely_ on Youtube traffic from reddit, it helps get the content creators paid so they can even make the content.

The problem with Reddit is that most posts have a very short lifespan -usually 12 hours and that's it, which can be vital traffic. So if you upload a CGPGrey video the DMCA is really not going to benefit him. Maybe you might consider changing the video to a youtube redirect, but the damage is already done. I loathe Facebook because they do the same thing and the people making the content get nothing back. 

/u/shiruken made a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6t3vs1/update_to_the_video_gif_beta/dlirtxs/) asking how you will handle the DMCA process - this is obvious very important, because if you look at theladbible they are making money from essentially freebooting content, which is absolutely not acceptable. I mean, if we're being realistic, must people using this feature do not own the rights to the videos they are uploading with it.

Surely reddit has a ethical, moral obligation as such a large platform to at least acknowledge this and outline your plans for limiting such abuse. It's a fantastic feature with so much potential, I just hope you've thought about this.


That's incredibly impressive - of course sometimes bad apps will get to play, and they will get a number of installs. My bet is Play Protect warned it was harmful and removed it automatically from users devices.


Weird, they use to have this, then they removed it, now they've readded it again...Although you should _not_ trust this data; the chances are ISPs give exceptions to speedtest to artificially increase their speed during testing. So the US is most likely not 9th but far worse. 
Possibly.
> Github can easily be blackmailed like anyone else.

Github's lawyers should've laughed this one to publicly shaming them for such a shit attempt at a DMCA. But no, they just let it go through.

So now any piece of text on github can be censored by anyone, for any reason. So that's cool I guess. This will be revoked in a few days once the EFF gets a hold of it, they don't and will not ever stand for bullshit like this.

To be clear, these guys have just used the DMCA to SUCCESSFULLY censor a piece of fucking text. That cannot be legal, or the internet cannot exist. This is a false DMCA and should be reversed ASAP.
Digital Millennium Censorship Act - that's what it has turned in to. Reddit pushes hard for net neutrality so this is just as important. You can't back door your way into getting what you want.

It also shows you should NOT be relying on github, as they're willing to bend over to anyone. I am really disappointed in ryanbr for not telling them to fuck off - if you need to self host, do it. The community is willing to help.

Now other companies are going to follow suit and within weeks easylist will be useless.

Stable release: 2.0.2 / 8 July 2013; 4 years ago  
Beta (v3) start: 29 January 2013.   
Latest beta: Sept 2016  
Latest v3 dev: 27th July  

V3 has been in beta for 1654 days, or 236 weeks, or 39,696 hours.

Yeah. It's pretty much dead now. I have absolutely no idea what the dev is doing but he clearly doesn't understand software development or releases.
MS has had a huge attitude change under Nadella. They're giving Linux more credit, implementing things like Bash on Windows, and supporting free, open source software like Code. It's certainly where MS needs to be to stay relevant in many areas they weren't before. Even .NET is now OSS.

I know as a developer VSC and BOW are huge, huge features that make everyday life that much better.
I mean, logic would dictate they'd do that first and then deploy the changes, maybe even use the [A/B tests they so helpfully link to in the sidebar](https://www.reddit.com/live/x3ckzbsj6myw/).

I never understood this - is it the fact they think because they are intelligent enough to setup their own VPN that makes it a good idea?

Reality check: you pay for it (assuming not bitcoins), _**YOU**_ are the only human on earth using that _exact_ IP address for the duration of time you use the VPN, so _everything_ can be traced back to _**you**_.

The idea is to have thousands using the same IP to make it harder for correlation attacks.
I'm thinking it's more the case bad actors can find malicious JS code that can be executed and perhaps steal some private data that way. Can't really do much aside from disabling JS (thus breaking most of the web) or keeping a whitelist (not feisable)

Both are useless. Been using defender for years, never had a virus. Don't download dodgy apps and you'll be fine. Virus software is obsolete and redundant now the OS has built in ones.
> It's better to have an antivirus being useless

No. No it's not. Google already has [Play Protect](https://www.android.com/play-protect/) that is doing _far_ _far_ more than this app can. It's also likely to give you a false sense of security. That thing anit going to help you more than Play Protect will. 
Sure, but let's not forget SpaceX is the only company in the industry capable of landing and reusing an orbital class booster, many would have said that is not possible for the next few decades, if at all. Elon does deliver, perhaps not when he says. There's nothing wrong in being ambitious, there's also nothing wrong being ambitious and not delivering. If it wasn't for SpaceX the US would probably not have a healthy space industry at all apart from NASA which doesn't even do launches anymore.
There's this:

    var url = "https://c88fef96.forestapp.cc/api/v1/users/188/coin?authenticate_token=" + items.user.authenticate_token;

Don't ask me why it's using user 188 (found [here](https://c88fef96.forestapp.cc/api/v1/users/188/profile))

but does seem to use a token

Hi. I did some research and didn't find anything malicious, but it does use Google Analytics, and it's possible to get the name of any user, for example:

https://c88fef96.forestapp.cc/api/v1/users/1/profile

and their avatars:

https://c88fef96.forestapp.cc/avatars/1/original/avatar.jpeg?time=1492229542

So that's fun I guess.
As an aside, I think package managers like NPM, or [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/) should be placed in a position of responsibility, they are absolutely too big to fail, we need to take all the precautions as we can. I mean, even Angular relies on users doing this: 

> npm install -g @angular/cli

completely blindly, is that something we should be encouraging? What if a package maintainer got hacked and updated the package with malicious code? What if a package was removed (akin to leftad), what security practices/protocols are in place? I found [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39008487/nodejs-npm-package-security) stackoverflow that mentions [nsp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nsp) that should _absolutely_ be included in NPM by default. So should checksum verifying, or 2FA, or encryption/decryption to verify people (I have no idea what security NPM uses but the recent attack would suggest not that much).

What we need is somebody like Tavis Ormandy or the entire project zero team to spend a week solid trying to find as many exploits in NPM as they can and to patch them _all_.

This would've been caught by Tavis, and somehow, nobody cares enough to ask them to look into NPM's security, even though Node and the entire fucking JS community depends on this, including Google, the largest web giant in the game.

Pathetic. I look forward to the incoming NPM [cloudbleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloudbleed) ironically discovered by Tavis, that is going to reveal people have been using compromised packages for years now.
I mean, if we use the image shared on twitter you can [see](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DGK-eZ3WsAAvqN0.jpg:large) the packages that were published, such as ffmepg, not ffmpeg. To be honest, I have to question how and _why_ this was ever allowed, is NPM too open to abuse and potential exploits? This attack would suggest yes, it was far too simple and should never have been allowed to happen.

NPM does a pathetic job at highlighting to the user how 'trusted' a NPM publisher is, take [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio) package. Nowhere are _all_ the authors named, there are no 'upvotes' or 'verified' publishers, and there's no indication this is a legit package. Authors should at least have a community "reputation" to indicate they are trusted.

This feels entirely like a process problem with NPM. Packages should be upvoted or downvoted, too many downvotes and it's hidden by default. Verified labels should be given to trusted users and at the least, packages should be reviewed by actual humans who can, not just take down bad packages, but remove packages which may depend on a malicious one.

Human reviewers whilst may seem unmanageable can at least help assure users there is no dodgy code, in addition to automated systems (which are not perfect). Packages should be highlighted "last reviewed by [person] and considered clean. This has been done 3 times, click here to see more information".

Just like the leftpad debacle, we see yet again NPM is ill-equipped to deal with malicious intent, maybe these events are trying to send them a message?
That's gone the way of the jack.
> Why do we need a new smartphone every two years?

Because Big Smartphone says you do, and they deliberately use Li-ion which goes shit after 2 years and is non-replaceable so you buy a new one.

Money.
> We've probably all had this happen at one point or another: it's time for an OS update

I'd say the majority have not. Most updates are security patches and even then, they've made improvements to the old style updates so they're a lot faster than they used to be (no more optimising step, for example).
You know, if companies actually focused on _quality_ these would not actually be issues. The 6P was great, then the batteries started shutting down at 20-45%, proper testing in the factory would've quickly brought the issue to light. I guess if they don't explode (hello Samsung) it doesn't matter, because shutting down randomly doesn't result in you getting physically hurt.

But no, they keep using chinese workers at minimum wage to make these phones using the cheapest possible components and even if they know they'll fail after a year, they won't get fined or sued legally (even if they did, it wouldn't damage them financially, see google's 2bn fine for example)

Can I ask why? JS seems actually useful, along with Node. I doubt JS is going _anywhere_ in the next decade or two.
I mean, primitivetechology is a dude making stuff and only does half a dozen a year, same with sovietwomble who is also an infrequent releaser.

> my Pixel last all day without issue with it on.

Yes, most pixel devices will last all day _today_. Come back to this thread next year and tell me what your battery is like on your phone and headphones; my 6P from 2015 has 78% battery health, and I've never used bluetooth. Lithium Ion degrades over time, this is a scientific _fact_, and applies to _every single battery in the world_. It's how batteries work. They die faster and faster. Even the new Tesla's will have their batteries crap out eventually and will get less and less miles vs traditional fuel.

My 3.5mm can last forever, doesn't need recharging, can charge the device and listen to music, doesn't need to be 'paired', don't need to remember to charge it, can't be DRM'ed and have problems with codecs or quality issues and just works.

Oh, and and my wired headphones work on _every single smartphone_ ever made with a 3.5mm jack, what about your headphones? There are differing BT standards, they are updating it, can be issues with codecs, and the device may not even have BT. So that's just fantastic. Could your headphones work _identically_ on the Nexus 4 vs the Pixel today? I am sure there could be some issues that prevent playback (shitty BT version etc).

"Nexus 4 bluetooth" into Youtube gives me [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipud-wAAE0E). Awesome. BT is just the tech I want to use. Or shell out $$$'s just for the privilege of listening to music.

BT is shit. End of.
Let's do a test.  

1: it takes me about 5 seconds to plug my headphones in (no setup needed, ever), yours?  


2: I can leave my phone charging and headphones playing music for over 365 days straight, how about yours?

Didn't charge them? No music for you.  
Battery goes shit? Tough luck, time to buy a new pair.

Also, using BT all the time drains your phones battery even quicker, meaning it loses its capacity then you need to buy a new one. Cool.

BT cannot match 3.5mm, end of. If I had to charge them once a month and they lasted all month for 3+ years without degrading sure. But batteries cannot do that yet.
Is it possible they might be able to use them for flights similar to Formost-5 which may not need an entirely new core and could be done on a steep discount? As you say would be a shame if they're never used. Heck, they could even fly it in expendable mode...
Yeah, you should setup 2FA on Redd...Owait...
So is your data.
> but no technology lasts forever.

Not when you can make more money ditching a standard interface. It's worked for Apple, why wouldn't others follow suit? We're obviously outnumbered.

Next up: the USB Type C port, they'll find a way to get rid of that eventually.

> if it will take many many years to ever get it to see the light of day.

Windows is 31 years old. And only _now_ in the insider channel and part of 1709 have they _just_ added GPU support to the task manager. It could have taken them _years_ to figure that out, maybe they had to rewrite the entire task manager? Maybe they had to ensure that it would not lead to problems/incompatibilities.

It takes so long because they cannot break anything. It's like being on a minefield and your job is not to step on a mine. MS cannot afford to have _anything_ screw up, especially in enterprise where the expectations are different (especially when money is on the line).

They don't need to rush anything just because people say so, the new explorer is done when it's done, whether that's next year, or next decade. Just because we live in a time of social media and things _can_ happen in seconds doesn't mean we need to constantly speed things up and remove every decaying artefact in the OS tomorrow.
Bad blob.
No they don't. I am sure they're capable of 'designing' a .PNG in photoshop in an hour. I am sure they already have an archive of 1000 .PNG's that they would _love_ to use.

Design is the pathetically easy part, actual implementation is much, much harder.
Windows is a software that relies on _extreme_ backwards compatibility, no other OS in history can offer the stability MS offers (in terms of menu's, options that live for decades, supporting programs forever), not even Linux comes close to matching Windows in this regard.

It's why you can take an .exe from 15 years ago and still run it today, without it crashing or bugging out, and that's because Microsoft is _extremely_ reluctant to make breaking changes. Remind me how look it took them to add [this](http://i.imgur.com/du6QJbc.png) again, a very recent change in Windows...

Microsoft cannot make breaking changes, it's just not what Windows is designed to do. Adding tabs could, and probably would, require a huge, huge amount of work, and they need to figure exactly _how_ to do that in the best possible way. The code base is probably not the easiest to work with, so it's not like they can just slash around, so far I think there have been 0 changes to explorer since Windows 10 launched. Sure, we'd love every window to be consistent throughout the entire OS but many apps depend on that shitty little file explorer window MS released 10 years ago, or that shitty menu system so the app can work as it was intended to...

It can be improved, but it'll likely take many, many years before we see that.
The explorer has remained virtually unchanged for years. Go to windows 7 then 8 then 10 - apart from the ribbon, it should be familiar to most. This is the single most crucial piece of software in the entire OS, so I'd rather they spend 3 years absolutely perfecting it and having no bugs _ever_ and it being _absolutely flawless_ because anything else would not be acceptable.

If they're going to change it, they'll do so when they're ready. It'd be in the insiders channel for at _least_ a year, if not 2 before making its way to stable.

And you know what, why do they have to "come up with something?", why change for change sake? There is _nothing_ wrong with the current explorer interface and it _just works_. I can't see how it can actually be improved.
> so having them think twice before calling again might not be the worst thing.

You could charge $20 per phone call. If the problem takes 10 seconds to fix, or it's their stupidity that's their problem. Want to call 5 times? $100.

That's how you get people to fix their stupid. Suddenly, if they're losing money, they're a lot more careful.

Funny how that works.
Well, most people are familiar with the interface of the car, as they are a computer; no excuse not knowing how to change gears, or how to steer. Most people don't know how cars work, just as they don't know how apps work (or what code is).

I think expecting people to know the basics (changing a tyre) is fair enough. Also, computers are far, far more common than cars are, since you have to be a certain age to drive, and not everyone can afford it. Most people (including kids) have smartphones and use them far more than they use a car.

32bit shouldn't even be a thing now. get a 64bit version/machine.
Because consumers are lapping it up. Do you blame Apple when they can make more money and the sheeple will just accept it? Here's a way to make a point: make the iPhone 7 the worst selling phone ever, maybe 1-2 million units sold and that's it.

No, that didn't happen, it sold just as well and people accepted the fact the port was removed, they accepted the compromise and the DRMification of a standard interface to listen to audio, all so they can sell their wireless crap that has batteries that will degrade to useless so you buy another pair, or you lose them and apple can charge you more money.

Consumers have a choice here; get a phone that has the jack, vote with your wallet and show them you care. The truth is, people don't, OEM's are seeing that, even Google is rumoured to nuke the jack from one of the new Pixels.

It's happening, and even if /r/android doesn't like it, consumers are accepting it. We are told how it works and nobody is fighting back. We are to blame, and only the majority matters. If data shows consumers don't care, there is only one logical course of action. It's time to kiss your wired headsets goodbye, because in 20-30 years, even regular motherboards will do away with the interface.

This is a placebo effect. I can get down to 3% at times. The second you open the camera app, goodbye battery. It's not replicable 100% of the time. _**It will happen to you again. Your solution will not fix it**_. The _**only**_ fix is to replace the battery.
This is the problem with Google in general, things like Android have a yearly refresh and with the previews have developed a pattern...I almost feel they work like valve; employees can choose what they work on and nobody commits time to areas they should be.

I mean, smart watches feel like a fad that's been and gone, same with VR and their 'daydream' platform that looks like a complete disaster and how viable is the TV market anyway? You dismiss the Chromecast but I think it really makes that TV platform redundant...

As for tablets...Android has never really been the platform for them. I have a windows 10 tablet that runs win32 and it's much, much better.
I mean, that's going to happen anyway to most things. Websites 10 years ago were not designed for touch screens, or 4k resolution. All software dies out in the end...the best you can do is record the game or try to convert it for preservation...


CSS in some ways is idiotic. Having flags is just pointless and leads to code rot and each rendering engine will paint the page differently. Add to the fact you must support mobile devices and well...Not even Reddit homepage is responsive and they're a top 30 website
Their content is going to end up on torrent sites anyway, video games are cracked despite what denuvo throws at it. If consumers want it free they will get it free. DRM only impacts actual customers, since DRM can cause performance issues and other problems.

When the ironic situation of games being cracked is better for consumers because the DRM is removed you know you have a failed platform.

DRM has no place on the web and I will access my content DRM free legal or not.

No programming language or scripting language on Earth can ever be 100% secure, bit at least it can be updated a hell of a lot easier than flash and features removed if they are too insecure or old
I think it'll be two weeks into August, then they'll do what they did with N and release maintenance versions, along with a probable 8.1. Most 2016/17 devices will get this update mid next year (when P DP2 is out), and 2015 devices will probably not be holding their breath.
The battery optimizations have been present in every dev preview...So yes. There are not going to be any more major/breaking tweaks/changes.

I'm really excited to seeing how spectacularly these governments fail, as the community rallies round and provides workarounds. The only way to truly block a website is to turn the internet off altogether.

If packets can be sent, they can be used to access any content a person wants. The internet was designed to route around censorship.
Then your phone can die extra quicker so you buy their brand new Pixel!
Or, what I like doing (if you can) is doing everything in a VM, completely separate OS. You can then full screen and forget about distractions entirely (self discipline required)
Are we really at a point where society is that judgemental you're considered a failure for having creased/wrinkled clothes? They're designed to hide your skin. If they're at least clean, and not smelly, that is enough. People in the past used to only bathe once a week, and they were far more forgiving than we seemingly are today.

Fuck what people think. 
> being long lasting are pure BS as there is no indication the CPU or memory can be upgraded

They usually don't go together. No smartphone in _history_ has ever had upgradable RAM/CPU, as they are soldered to the PCB, so good luck with that. It's mostly the battery and degradation that gets people (how frequently you recharge and SOT).

As for the jack, it's a feature that _many_ do use, and there is _no benefits_ to removing it (you can waterproof a jack), it's just another way for them to penny pinch you (use our dongle! buy our wireless earbuds!).

PR is PR, you're going to watch this go out in a blaze of glory when people realise the only reason this phone has relevance is because of the person behind it, after that, it'll probably never be seen again.
Let's be honest here, the _**only**_ reason this phone has any relevance and following is because of the guy who's made it. If it was anyone else it'd probably not get more than 50 upvotes at best.

This phone will end up being a flop for sure. If you want to buy it, wait _at least_ 3 years or you'll end up getting a crap deal (see OnePlus). After 3 years you know build quality, software update support, whether they are scummy/shitty, business practices, how they respond to feedback/criticism. 

If you buy this phone, you only have yourself to blame. Learn from OnePlus. Never Settle.
The sentiment is nice but for some it's just not worth it. There are 7 billion of us here, it's okay if a few decides this place is not for them.

We all die anyway, why be trapped if you can't bare the pain anymore?
Lol
I made the point the UK has increased the penalty, obviously they are not the whole world, but they naively believe upping the maximum sentence will scare people away. Or the US awarding $15m fines to pirates which look good in headlines.

The internet belongs to no one country, regardless of where the _physical_ data is going to/from or where it's hosted. The US believes if data travels down their fibre cables they have a right to monitor it and apply their laws, which is why you often see extradition to those in foreign countries...

The point you made was

> Unfortunately in a few years piracy will be much heavily more regulated with fines and jail time

I provided an example where the UK _incrased_ jail time to 10 years for piracy (mostly commercial) yet millions still download Game of Thrones on a weekly basis. It means sweet fuck all.

Lololol in the UK they changed the penalty for piracy from 2 years to 10. It's like arresting people for murder during a war; millions of people pirate daily (see GoT), not much they can do apart from globally disable the internet.

If I can send packets you can be damn sure piracy will happen one byte at a time. So tell me how can they prevent piracy? It's not technically possible.
Back to piracy? Wasn't Netflix not so concerned about NN a while back. Then changed their minds once they realised they'd get a clusterfuck of bad PR?

Yeah....Piracy has _always_ been the way, fuck supporting giant conglomerates, somebody has to keep them in check.

/u/ErisC I'm intrigued your opinion on [vultr.com](https://vultr.com) which is offering a pretty lucrative $2.50 option. I mean, with the shortage of IPv4 I am amazed it's even possible to own one for that price. 

Is this going to be a growing concern for cloud hosting? I can't imagine you can offer a $5 server to _everyone_. Also, what about 'dirty' IPv4's, perhaps those owned by people who abuse them (spam, ddos, bad things), I've noticed I can get a recycled v4 at times :(

The truth is, it seems v4 will be around for another decade or two at least, the v6 rollout is despicably slow, and there are (probably) going to be so many broken things once the transition is underway... 
When using Android O, I use an app called [twilight](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.lux&hl=en), unfortunatley it does not work with system UI components, such as the notifcation shade, or lockscreen.

Can this be worked around? It's important to have a fully featured night light for safety reasons (blue light emission), even Windows 10 has a native implementation now.
As a follow up, because of security changes in O, when using twilight, the very white, and bright, notification shade kills my eyes. I appreciate you might not add native night mode, but it's extremely important to my eyes to have a night filter.

Can this be worked around by developers? AFAIK apps can no longer draw over system components so at 12am at night, I am staring at a white UI which is like staring at the sun.

> and are build absolutely no computer skills at all. 

I think it's a bit unfair to say that; touchscreens are _everywhere_, and at a job you may be required to use a smartphone, tablet or other touch device. Also the lines are being blurred all the time, we have tablets that can double as full blown PC's (in the traditional sense).

You're right, tablets as they stand today are mostly media consumption, but they can also be educational and provide skills that kids need to know now; basic understanding of computers is simply a _must_ and there's no argument against that.

But yes, you need to know where to draw the line and find the balance.

Was just about to post this - it's been a loooong time, but finally the big four are in their rightful places. This time, headed by Andy Murray.

You would have thought after 14 years the rest of the pack could've won more than 5 majors from the big four.....

Oh sweet summer child. There are _still_ places using IE6. It'll be a long, long while before IE is gone for good. It needs to be _fully_ removed from Windows first (but I'm sure the webbrowser component on winforms apps use IE...).

Because Google punishes them in search rankings if you do not. When Google releases a thing, you use that thing because they're _the_ source of your traffic. I doubt a competitor to AMP would ever be allowed by Google, obviously.

Also, every AMP URL has google.co.uk, so in fact, they are "amping" every site (or more realistically, caching the amp site, which has other consequences, such as the user not directly hitting the target domain name)
Wait for the EU to fine Google for anti competitive behaviour.

It's not even just that. G2A had a pretty big hand in streamers being able to stream anyway, now the money has dwindled they are finding it harder. Sucks to know your life support can be cut off any second (because I doubt you can rely on donations _alone_)
Murray is world number 1. NOBODY apart from the big 4 have been no 1 for over 13 years 
Typical Murray. 3 games down, 4 set points down, wins 4 games in a row to win the match.
Yet the EU thinks [this](http://i.imgur.com/RL9kUnD.png) is okay?  
No way to remove [Onedrive](http://i.imgur.com/PrLTb9S.png) from the sidebar there; no other service provider can get the same integration as far as I've seen.

7? 8? Linux? Sorry buddy but there are limited choices, you need to pick one and be satisfied. 
I am more shocked sites like Amazon/eBay allow users to link to third party sites, what if they decided to change it to porn or something if they got hacked? I am surprised they don't download and rehost the images themselves...
I can for sure see imgur doing this one day, but what alternatives are there? Images need to be hosted _somewhere_ and one day the hard drive that hosts those images may no longer work; you can't realistically expect your images to be hosted for free, forever...
Seems they were a little over eager with their 9 day turn around. Disappointing of course but safety beats all else. 
This rocket refuses to leave! I swear they've gained intelligence! "You will not murder me Elon!".

That, and it refuses to beat the previous 13 day turnaround record :P
John will have to do his whole script for a third time...
/u/MingerOne thanks so much for updating the thread format, it's really appreciated <3.
Did anyone else hear the rocket just die just before abort. Listen [here](https://youtu.be/ZKmWeATngb4?t=873), there is sound then nothing...Is that usual?
As annoying as it is, sometimes they only change client libraries, or fix their telemetry system, or a bug in a third party library. They could mention that specifically but most users wouldn't really care.
Kurzgesagt has done some [interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHyUYg8X31c) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSKi8HfcxEk) that try to explore these concepts further. What _is_ an AI? Does it deserve _rights_, what even _are_ rights? And if an AI makes a decision (self driving car; kill host or kill pedestrians) _who_ takes the blame? Do we prosecute the _AI_ or the humans who _made_ the AI? Will that effectively destroy an entire industry? What if the AI decides to _kill_ its host on purpose? Is that a possibility? Can we program it not to? Do we set artificial boundaries (excuse the pun), and _how_ do we litigate or assign responsibility?

We're headed for some interesting times, this is why I _hate_ software litigation/rulings of any kind, because they always have a chance to set precedent (net neutrality, banning encryption, forcing companies to store/hand over data, piracy cases etc). 

These politicians simply have not grown up technology, and due to their role, have to know about a variety of subjects, let's leave these matters to industry experts who know about AI, neural networks, programming, networking to make these decisions, because at least they'd know how stupid it is to make a $3bn decision for something that is near impossible to prove. 
Fair points, with that in mind you could say if it was going to happen it'd be more due to luck/circumstance, such as 2 sats by the same provider with all the variables "luckily"? in place just like last weekend. Besides, I doubt being able to have a 24 hour turnaround is _that_ important for any given customer (which customer would be dependant on that?).

It's probably more of an Elon wants to show off type of thing.
Sure, and I'd agree with a more cautiously optimistic approach, however this is the same guy who wants to put people on mars and debuted the ITS; he's already proven what SpaceX can do that nobody thought was possible, why would this be any different?

Everyone should be, by now, believing what he says is going to happen and think about the reasons why it couldn't, and to me, once they've flown a few Block V's and got the hang of pad refurbishment I don't see where any bottlenecks will exist.

Rocket lands on land, goes to hangar, gets checked over, next payload mated, rolled out to pad, ready to fly again. They've already got the AFTS which should help with this....
They said the same about reusing the same core, SX has done it twice. They said the same about 2 launches in 2 days, they've just done it.

SX _will_ launch the same rocket, from the same pad, within 24 hours, it's not an _if_ but a _when_.

So this doesn't seem too far fetched or unbelievable, and if any company can pull it off, SX can. They _have_ to if they want to reach the reported 54 launches in 2019.
I think people should watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSpAWkQLlgM) video and see exactly what you're saying; there is physically nothing to show them...
> Google DOES force individuals to use google search as default on cellphones

Apple FORCES users to use Safari on iOS, do you see iPhones loaded with Chrome or Firefox or Opera by default?

Samsung FORCES users to use their browser, as it comes default on their phones.

Microsoft FORCES users to use Edge since it comes as default.

Ubuntu FORCES users to use Firefox, since it comes as default.

See where this is going?
> Google will tell you that it's shopping website is the best. Do you believe them?

Amazon would tell me Prime is the best, Spotify would tell me they're the best. $business would tell me they are the best. Why? To make fucking money, duh.

> (they use crawlers etc. to determine the rank)

Lol. Google is and has been an AI focused company for many years now, rankings are determined by a metric _fuck load_ of data; country you're in, contextual awareness (recent news/events, where you are physically based on location data, previous search history). They use AI all over the place now, for example, tagging Youtube videos, or finding which are the ones to remove (because no chance a human could ever keep up with the amount of data YT gets per day). If you want a source on this, I encourage you to watch Google IO 2017 and 2016.

If I am a developer, and Google knows this from my search history and other data, and I search for 'java' it'd better fucking return the language and not the coffee.


Thing is, Google isn't _forcing_ you to use their services. They quite happily let you download all your data and export it for free, and you're welcome to use any other browser, search engine, video site, email provider you like.

Consumers are _consciously_ deciding whether or not to use Google; if they are not aware of alternatives that shouldn't be Google's problem.
Windows 10 is not a monopoly? Microsoft have monopolised the desktop market for decades now. This is why the EU fined them in the first place.
If you're refering to browserchoice.eu then that was scrapped [a few years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BrowserChoice.eu). I've not seen the dialogue you're talking about on Windows 10.
Like Windows 10 S, which can't install chrome? (google could make  a windows 10 store app, then it has to be allowed on there by Microsoft)
The EU fine on MS for bundling IE made such a difference they are totally not bundling Edge in 10...Owait...
I'd like Amazon to also sell the Chromecast which they stopped selling to sell their own Fire sticks. Will EU investigate that? Didn't think so.

All companies are going to use their position in the market for their own gain, that just makes sense. Why should Google/Amazon be forced to work together when they're competitors? Isn't that what a competitor does?
Thanks for taking my feedback on board and offering to share it :).
I've said this before, and this is not the first time OP have done this, but they should answer the most upvoted questions, or have their AMA removed. If they can't agree to this they shouldn't be given the platform reddit provides them (and the advertising, and the stickied thread).


> plenty of others 

> Does not list others

K.
The terribly selective most questions unanswered "AMA". Next time rename it to AMA except controversial questions. 
Nailed it.
That was scary...
John!!! <3
I hope to god this all goes off without a hitch, will be quite the achievement for SpaceX.
I really hope they fine these idiots if they cause a launch scrub. How can they possibly not know there's a launch taking place?
> And what do you do when the battery of that headphone turns to shit?

You know the answer to that and why they're removing the jack; to make more money.

Batteries go shit = you buy another = more money = profit.

It's why most smartphones are bastards to replace batteries; better replace the entire damn thing, they make more money that way. Every year they rehash the same shit, with incremental improvements, but they know people will buy again after their contract is up or their old phone turns to shit.

It's simply how the industry works.
> Discord could just shut down any moment, from a simple hardware failure, to a major decision to just shut the service down.

So could Github, or Reddit, or Facebook, or Twitter, I am not sure I get your point. The entire internet could probably collapse if terrorists bombed the shit out of a few major data centers....

> By revenue model I mean that the company behind Discord is the one hosting the servers,

Whose _really_ hosting the servers? They could be using Google, or Azure, or AWS, or Digital Ocean....They could go down at any given second too.

What about mIRC or Mibbit? IRC is a protocol, and those apps need to be maintained and updated in the future, and that also costs money. 

Discord uses http/websockets to send messages to a server and store in a DB

Mibbit does the same thing, but uses IRC as the underlying protocol, and it has all the same risks and problems. Somebody somewhere needs to physically host the IRC server, and it could die at any second for any reason.

> It allows for more space in the phone.

That's the literal biggest load of bullshit I've ever heard, they are not doing _anything_ with that space at all. They're doing it to make more money.

> all the choice in the world.

Google mocked Apple in their [ad](https://youtu.be/Rykmwn0SMWU?t=46) and now within a year they're removing the jack in one of their phones?

Since when did a fucking hole in a phone become a feature you need to shop for? It's been standard since the first fucking iPhone 10 fucking years ago.

But obviously DRM and making you buy more bullshit headphones is just another way of them making money. And the reality is, the jack is going to fade out over the next few years.

god fucking damn it.

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/b8JfvK2.png) of post when OP inevitably deletes it.
Why the fuck is a basic headphone jack now considered a premium feature? Are you fucking kidding me.

There are _0_ reasons to remove it. ^^^^Yes, ^^^^you ^^^^can ^^^^waterproof ^^^^a ^^^^phone ^^^^with ^^^^the ^^^^jack.
> couldn't users on IRC networks set up their own channels?

Sure, but unless it's as easy as discord makes it, there will always be that divide, people don't want to type commands, they want to click buttons.

> can't you find IRC clients that also have it that way?

You can, for example mIRC or Mibbit (web client), both of which I've used in the past. The difference being Discord is Discord; it has a web app, android app, iOS app, could expand into windows (.exe/store app) and you just search one thing and that's it.

With IRC you need the URL, port, and know how to join a channel, it's not necessarily cross platform (I.E having the same app across all platforms) and is simply harder to use than discord. Even Twitch which uses the IRC protocol has a better interface built on top of it.

There is so clearly and so obviously a massive difference in terms of usability that makes IRC look so dated, I mean, Discord could literally be using IRC under the hood and nobody would be any the wiser.

In fact, what is the difference between IRC and Discord? What if you built a gui using IRC that was as good as Discord? Is JS the bottleneck here? Because that's not much of an issue.

> Furthermore, what do you think about the revenue model for Discord? Do you think it'll work?

Same with IRC; you need a client to connect to IRC, and most people will probably be use a free one, which needs to implement the protocol, so I'm not sure that has any relevance here.
Because why am I not able to deny "network" permission to an application? This app says it needs no mobile data/network. Same with a flashlight app, no reason that would _ever_ need to make network requests.


[This](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-irc-server-on-ubuntu-14-04-with-inspircd-2-0-and-shalture) is the problem with IRC. Like it or not, if there isn't a GUI and it requires learning/effort to use/install most people are not going to.

Discord is 100% GUI and extremely easy to use. For that reason alone Discord wins and will continue to win.
It's about time they got a budget; how is it not a legal mandate that _every_ medical computing device _must_ be running software that receives security patches and they _must_ be installed (desktops, laptops, smartphones, servers etc)

The alternative is you get hacked, or ransomwared, or just fucked over and it can lead to actual people dying.
If this launch is successful, this will be the most launches in any year for SpaceX ever, incredible stuff. We may even get into the late teens at this rate...
I honestly wonder if they will become as regular and mundane as airplane flights. "Oh, just another satellite launching, yawn".
They managed to remove the doors after all? Impressive stuff!
Remember to take a shot each time the word "historic" is used! 
Right. In the worst case they can use these as test vehicles until they explode or something, to try and learn as much as possible.
"Spacecom to decide whether to recoup $50m or free launch from Amos-6 explosion".

See, not difficult. Your title implies (to me) that SpaceX is the one holding out not paying them, which is not true.
Sure, then the title is horribly misleading in that case, as there is no payment to recover...
You think SpaceX will give them another launch without making them pay again? That'd be generous if so...
> If you can, sure. Sometimes you need a charge quickly before heading back out though.

This is not the phone for you then.


Will you still be around in 3 years when we go through this shit again? I hope so, I'll miss your copypasta if you don't come back :)
I lol'd. I think a meme has been born here.
I'm interested in this - was that before or after their grasshopper program? I would like to believe they'd do the tests on dev rockets, then modify their "production" rockets with the parts that worked. I very much doubt they were testing new features for the first ever time with a customer payload attached....
The difference is, SpaceX had the [grasshopper](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=spacex+grasshopper) program which helped them with this, they would never have risked a customer payload in lieu of recovery.
SpaceX can't really afford to put experimentation over mission success, especially when it means to save a bit of money, the risk has far more consequences. Elon's thinking is right, and as we saw with their first stage recovery program, the mission was _always_ successful, never _once_ did they risk the payload over first stage recovery, and never _once_ have they ever lost a payload but landed the rocket.

Elon's thinking is more they want to give it a try, but only once they are _reallllly_ certain and that any changes they make won't risk an RUD as that'd be a disaster (grounding the entire fleet, delays in their manifest, they'd probably lose Iridium etc). Your thinking they'd risk that because it's only a demo payload is entirely incorrect, they will not ever do anything to risk an RUD, because they've had 2 already and caused major headaches.
Which would still be a disaster, _anything_ blowing up, or anything other than "nominal" would decrease customer confidence, which is the last thing you want when debuting the rocket you've spent years working on, and want people to use (and _pay_ for).

As far as customers are concerned, even with a "fake payload", if anything goes wrong they'd be thinking "what if that was my $300m payload on there?"
Your anecdote is why the first ever landing webcast only has [2.6 million views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5bTbVbe4e4), while the first barge landing only has [1.6 million views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pUAydjne5M). The first reused core only has [1.2 million views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsZSXav4wI8), getting less and less each milestone.

Part of me wishes this was more widely popular and these videos had 300 million views because they are so darn impressive and important for the future of spaceflight. SpaceX are doing all the right things (making it accessible via youtube, putting content out via twitter/instagram etc).

I guess people just don't care that much, and it's a sad realisation. 
"The recycle bin is like a toilet, you wouldn't put your bills, receipts or other pieces of paper there, and it works in the same way, flush and they're gone."
Considering how Elon has constantly made a comparison with rockets and aircraft, I bet he'd love to see a turnaround of _hours_ but since that's not realistic (yet?), then maybe a day or two (could be possible with RTLS). It depends if they can use their multiple pads as well...I think what we're seeing this weekend with 2 launches will become standard sooner or later.
This is something I've spent some time mulling over. At some point jimmy is going to _become_ saul goodman, and as we saw in BB he was heavily involved in walts/jesses's business and helping them out, they are ultimately why he was sat alone in a room, by himself. 

In a way they kind of _have_ to be involved, I really want to believe vince has some scenes prefilmed with their cameo he made years ago, but that'd be next level thinking...All I can say is he is the guy who can make it happen, and make it believable. 
It really doesn't matter. What matters is phone from 2014 gets software from 2015 in 2017 which is just plain terrible PR. Heck, they could be better than Google but it doesn't matter because their perception is fucked, just look at the 110 upvotes my comment has. 

It's the same reason one plus is getting shit on, no nougat for their phones and most devices should be getting latest software in a reasonable time...
[198 phones with replaceable battery 2016/2017](http://www.gsmarena.com/results.php3?nYearMin=2016&idBatRemovable=1)

What phones have replaceable batteries anyway? Not many these days, and whose to say you can even get a battery after a year or three, or five...
Money. Easy to DRM headphones then.

I feel so sorry for Americans, their internet pricing is ridiculous.
Funnily enough, Debian 9 is released _today_. Unlucky really.
Sarcasm without /s is hard on the internet. I've been here long enough people would say that seriously 
I am confused, how is a phone only just getting _marshmallow_ _today_ iPhone level software support? It should be getting Nougat, not fucking Marshmallow. In theory it's had 3 software updates, the same as nexus devices or samsung flagships, except this update is a year and a half late :/
> Meanwhile, the YotaPhone 2, which was launched way back in February 2014 with Android KitKat on board (v4.4.3), has now started receiving the Marshmallow update

Not that. DOA.

To be clear, a 2014 phone is _only just_ getting a 2015 operating system ***621 days*** after it was released...What the actual fuck?
People game reddit all the time - it's the same tricks oneplus used to gain popularity, now they only get notoriety due to their shitty behaviour. Imagine if we could see how many views this thread has (that feature is coming soon on reddit), it's well worth pulling out all the stunts to market the phone as hard as possible.

If you're a new brand, reddit is high up on your priority list in marketing.
Incredible. Simply incredible.
From what I can find, only [this](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/BatteryManager.html#BATTERY_PROPERTY_STATUS) has been added in O.
No, battery saving mode, yes. Wifi is off during sleep. To get to 4hr 17 I used battery saver mode, which on O is a single tap in the quick settings bar.
Kind of - I avoid using intensive applications like the camera, but I managed to get it to 8% and tried using the camera and recording video and taking pictures worked flawlessly, then I tried a burst capture and it powered off.

However, I absolutely do not get shutdowns at 30% or less in any other way, it was a lot worse towards the end of last year.
> Samsung is also in the same tier as Google

Samsung has _never_ beat Google. In fact, no other OEM _ever_ has.

> That's a major thing that android in general needs to work on.

I think we will see some changes with Treble, /r/android has every right to be cynical, but I think updates will get faster.
Google promised 2 years of updates, they did not mention when those updates would be released, and the Nexus 6 got those 2 years of updates, and is now getting security patches.

What other non-google phones got 7.1.1 before the Nexus 6 again?

Google has _never ever_ failed on their update promise.
This is the reason I _never_ brought into the whole OP thing in the first place; in fact, I actually purchased an invite code from ebay for the Oneplus Two (sad, I know). I decided against it in the end for this exact reason, dodged a bullet there.

If a company is new give it at least 5 years and see where they are and what their opinion is (support, software, communication etc).

People love to jump on the bandwaggon though. Their "invite" scheme was nothing more than a desperate attempt to build fake hype and make it seem they were super popular.

The only 'flagship' they killed was themselves.
Part of me is desperately hoping the translation is completely wrong...No way people can be this stupid surely? :'(
You seemed to have missed [this](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/blob/5eea7e2a213edc9e83a47b6414d0250468d83471/feature-detects/history.js). Sometimes the browser vendors fuck up and you have no choice but to use UA sniffing.

> The stock browser on Android 2.2 & 2.3, and 4.0.x returns positive on history support

Yup. That's a BIG fuckup.
Except that's not exactly true - the BBC [uses](http://static.bbci.co.uk/news/1.196.01647/js/module/featureDetector.js) feature detection for a reason, not all browsers implement things the same.

Example: I want to send _all_ mobile users to m.website.com, without UA checking, this is not possible.

Also, that library still [relies](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=useragent%27&type=) on UA sniffing in some cases...:P
Some of the shots Murray is getting back should not be possible.
It's honestly laughable that there isn't some sort of cross-browser API for detecting what browser/version a user is using. It makes absolutely no sense. Browsers can tell how far down a user has scrolled but we still use regex to match versions?

The UA string should've been deprecated 10 years ago.

My suggestion:  
window.browser.version  
window.browser.name  
window.browser.patchLevel 

etc
Many big organisations still rely on it, such as the [BBC](http://static.bbci.co.uk/news/1.196.01647/js/module/featureDetector.js), they even acknowledge how sad it is:

Software patents are a joke and stifle innovation in so many ways.
Anyone else getting really terrible battery life on dp3? I seem to be draining 10%/minute. /s
Yes, battery life is terrible since I've used it for a whole 5 minutes! /s
In reality: those numbers mean nothing and I can bet you 50 months of gold people _will_ complain about battery life on the new OPO and 835. Even the 840 which doesn't even exist will have 20% less energy used and people will _still_ complain.

Sauce: see complaints about 800, 801, 805, 810, 820, 821, 835
> When you're so poor you can't even afford to talk to somebody about killing yourself.

Jesus.
Heck, Frank was shot and Claire left him at the end of one season, that was _the_ beginning of the downfall. I think when Frank recovered from being shot was when Netflix decided they'd rather drag it out because money. I mean, they set it up so the guy investigating Zoe Barnes death would've been published and Frank would've been arrested, and the show would've concluded there with Conway as president or something.

Same with orange is the new black, utterly uninspiring new season.
Microsoft would agree.
Murray must be so happy right now, if Murray wins today also, he'll solidify his number 1 position until at least after Wimbledon :D
That'll be the entirety of the NHS then :P
That would be the Nextbit Robin.
Except most tabs are out of RAM and need reloading :D
So they're starting the QF at 11AM tomorrow because it was delayed due to the fact they started play today at 2PM?

#\#FOlogic
That may be where I am remembering, it was one of them. It was a really shitty thing to do.
iirc a few years back ~~Wimbledon~~ the FO did a really scummy thing of starting a match and delaying it to the next day and ticket holders could not get a refund, let's hope they don't start play on the men's matches so that is the case.
It's frustrating they start play at 2PM in the quarters. For an event that doesn't have roofs, skipping those crucial 3 hours is really dumb.
Ah yes. The classic hamburger menu, because screen sizes obviously couldn't fit a menu and a calculator at the same time, because we're all using mobile devices.
I guess once Block V comes around, they might eventually be able to actually slow down development and make less new cores as they get reused more and more often, kinda like airplanes. I can imagine eventually it'll become rare to actually fly on a _new_ booster (as rare as flying on a new airplane).
Ah okay, thanks. I guess eventually they'll need to acquire another hanger or two, unless they'll be constantly 'recycling' them making this a non issue
Question: Where the hell are they going to keep all these rockets? They must be running out of room now surely?!
Nailed it. Again.
I need reminding, is this pad historic?
Purely your preference.
No.
There will _always_ be this argument though, it's the same for self-driving cars. All that matters is that on average it's more accurate than humans (across all events in a given year).

Unfortunately there is no real way to understand whether it is more/less accurate in general, maybe having slow-mo cameras recording at high FPS can also help to give a third match official a chance to make a decision (like they do in Rugby).

Just relying on humans is stupid and leads to wrongful calls. Also, they showed a replay that hawk-eye said was out, so they must have it in action.
Absolutely. :)

I assume he had to reply to his slack channel that he was still alive and okay (and not dead/detained).
This isn't a problem limited to node though. Python has pip, PHP has composer, .NET has NuGet. This is the tradeoff for using and relying on a package manager to do the work for the developer.
Not really, he hasn't published the video on his [homepage](http://cgpgrey.com) so IFTTT wouldn't know to trigger posting on his sub.
And he activated a dead mans switch, which would've alerted his lawyer if he didn't respond within 2 hours.
How did that baby not wake up with that dog pecking at it :P
Are these clouds violating any weather conditions that make it a NO for launch today?
/u/FutureMartian97 really good work with the thread so far, thanks for adding all the links and backup window information :)
It's a sad state of affairs when software upgrades are _so_ unreliable on Android this actually gets upvoted and to the front page of /r/android. I'd love to say "well, duh", since every new phone should get years worth of support.

I really hope treble makes posts like these get 0 upvotes because obviously all phones will get the new update regardless of cost.
That is true, _especially_ because FH relies on absolutely no mishaps, and their entire manifest (including Iridium NEXT). They cannot afford a RUD this year honestly.
Even though this has become routine at this point I still get excited for every launch and landing. Musks plan of this getting boring is not working, even though he may be :P.
Let's not speculate then, and state the facts: only one stream for this launch. See, that was easy.
I think Reddit needs to incorporate some sort of AI into its system, such as "I am not interested in this sub/story/meme/thing" right now, and have it learn the more you use the website, so it knows what to show to you based on what you like. For example, I can say "I don't ever want to see political posts" and it will try its best to filter those out, even political posts that appear on /r/pics would be filtered, and other pictures you may like would be visible.

Although, I doubt AI is good enough to do that reliably today, and the engineering debt would be substantial to reddit whose homepage doesn't even use media queries.

Filter packs are good, but again, you'd really be needing an AI system to do this reliably because political posts appear outside the most obvious subreddits.

I mean, if we track his videos over the last few years I feel we can certainly see a shift

I certainly feel his videos from 2015/2016 were much more interesting and there was learning potential, I hope he returns to such videos in the future, because the more recent ones are not really about exploring concepts in depth, or looking into the history of a thing.

I've been wondering about his 'assistant' that he said helped him with the brexit video (in a HI episode he revealed this), and wonder if that partnership hasn't worked out. I mean he's still working on his next ask grey video which feels it's also taking an age to come out.

I agree, this video did feel basic in places, mostly a 'common sense' thing, and the ad at the end caught me off guard since in a way, the video did feel like just an ad for a book (which it is). Although most of his videos these days are mostly straightforward-ish and aimed at popular subjects.
Is being motivated conducive to maximizing misery though? :P
Gotta get that karma fam, fuck correct titles.

Hmm I'm not sure, why would massive controversy in football when a goal that was not called by the human ref require the implementation of technology that is much, much better than human judgement be needed....Somebody remind me again
Since [2009.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros)
According to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Roland_Garros) it's been in the works since 2009 and been delayed several times, 10 years for a new court, roof and some lights. Good job French Open.
Only for bots that are really, _really_ poorly coded, because it's _so_ trivial to check if somebody is shadow banned you could literally go to [this](https://www.reddit.com/user/rise_up_now.json) URL by making an unauthenticated request and automatically detect you're shadowbanned. 

At this point, most bots probably check if they're shadowbanned (say every 5 minutes) and could make a new account automatically, it's not difficult.

_really good phone_ is not what this is. a _really good phone_ has a headphone jack, end of story.

It's not a circlejerk, I just don't want another device I have to charge. My jack has an uptime of 2+ years, can your wireless headphones match that? I'm all for dropping redundant ports but wireless headphones are simply not there yet, added to the fact they're more expensive than wired alternatives and you can see why people hate it.

How can something Apple did, that they called "courage" be considered a 'circlejerk', when absolutely _nobody_ has had issue with this jack for fucking decades, and the fact is you _can_ waterproof it with the jack...

Let's be clear, this is simple economics; if sales data shows people only buy phones with the jack then manufacturers will have to include the jack, and in the future phones with the jack will become more lucrative. only when sales swing the other way (people dislike the jack) does it make sense to remove it altogether. At this point in time, people currently prefer the jack (hence the outrage).

Also remember this is another way for Apple to make more money; eventually the battery life on wireless things gets worse, and doesn't hold charge as long, just like smartphones, hence why it's not so easy to replace the batteries, meaning you'll just have to buy another pair, wired alternatives have no such issue.
For many, the lack of the 3.5mm is the _only_ topic of conversation, since removing it is actually retarded. 
php, angular, windows...seems to be a trend...
Quite honestly, from my research (read: googling '2gb ram 32 or 64 bit windows 10') it's not really clear if there is any tangible benefit or even downsides to using 64bit Windows with 2GB ram, many people do advise to use 32bit however, but quite honestly, it's probably not worth the hassle since I am not sure what'd happen to the keys, in theory they should work on any version (32/64bit) but unless you learn there is a significant drawback to using 64bit you may as well stick with it.
You only have 2GB ram so there's little point running 64bit windows.

Seems this user _realllllly_ needs the publicity:

[House going to foreclosure soon. Our credit ruined. The house we bought unknowingly had structural damage to the foundation and frame. We are not paying mortgage. No money for paying bloodsucking lawyers. HELP. Any advice?](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/6dnlpq/house_going_to_foreclosure_soon_our_credit_ruined/)
That is not proof. How do we know you're not just a PR person?
I still use [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Tablets/Linx-1010B-10-1-inch-Tablet-Black-Keyboard/B014D847FS) which has an [atom](http://ark.intel.com/compare/80274,82103) processor and 32gb of storage, and it works absolutely fine on Windows 10 (although, I've never tried updating it). The main issue here is trying to use an SD card to update an entire OS, considering the size of Windows and depending on the class of SD card used will decide how long it takes.
Have you already downloaded all the files? Also, what SD card are you using? Because it seems to me on the information you've provided the read/write speeds from the SD card to your laptop are absolutely terrible.

Also, according to [this](http://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/laptops/hp-stream-11#) review "the right side of this notebook houses a USB 3.0 port". Why are you not using a USB 3.0 device to update?

Try running a [Crystal Disk Mark](http://crystalmark.info/software/CrystalDiskMark/index-e.html) speed test on your SD card and post the results here.

Alternatively: Free up your storage by backing up to an SD card, and rerun the update using 32GB storage.
Sure, NASA gave SpaceX their $1b contract after their 1st successful launch after 3 mishaps, but the fact still remains SpaceX has innovated more in the last few years than NASA has done in decades, obviously lack of funding and political reasons factor into this as well. I think most agree it's a shame they're so under funded.

> By what measure

Well, I can only comment on what I know and what I see, and SpaceX have landed many rockets on landing pads and drone ships, and it's become a _defacto_ _must_ in rocket technology.

It's like somebody figured they can reuse an airplane multiple times whereas people are still making new ones each launch which is a huge waste of money. I bet many people are really wanting to fly a F9, even one that is recycled. I think they could easily become the most dominant launch provider there is in the next few years, given their history remains positive (no RUD's, successful refly launches/landings etc).

If there are other innovations companies are beating SX on then please let me know, I'm intrigued to see where they can improve.
Except Musk is the first human to own a company that's landed over 7 orbital class rockets back on earth, at a landing site or the ocean. Not even NASA has that capability.

Musk owns the most advanced rocket company on the planet, in 15 years he's innovated more than anyone else in the industry.

People said it could never be done, and he proved them wrong, there is no reason not to believe in his ideas, such as colonizing Mars.

After watching westworld and hearing Grey and Brady discuss it, it does seem reasonable that we are always in some sort of loop; every so often grey makes a video, does a podcast, brady makes his videos, people do their jobs. We're each in our own little loops, and those who do terrible things (manchester attack, for example), are those who have 'broken' their loop and should essentially be 'retired', but perhaps whoever is watching is not fast enough, or doesn't send the 'police' in to take care of them...
Valve wants a word with you. Consoles work, but desktop can do what a console does, and run VM's, do web browsing, and be a general purpose multi-media machine.

Having a dedicated device for just one thing really doesn't make any sense. Games consoles really should have HDMI ports and run a desktop OS (they're more than capable), in which case they just become....A PC.....

Consoles are just a worse PC at this point, when you put it that way...
Yes there is, VPN's can work over a number of protocols, and they are encrypted; they would've been blocked by now if it was so easy. Even people in China use VPN's frequently.
How about adding a new filter called "popular" that sits alongside top/best. You could use the views and other metrics to show the content that way...
I don't understand why people complain, I like seeing a number of "technical" and "easy" explanations, there are usually a few responses so just pick the one you want to read...? 
Reddit gets jealous when people admit to karma whoring. 
You can also notice [this](http://i.imgur.com/T66Vmym.png) frame, which shows the "Secure" indicator and the little "person" icon (next to minimize/maximise etc) which were _not_ part of Chrome in 2010 (the secure indicator is a very new addition).

So yes, it was more to progress the story, less about the intricate details of trying to keep the theme going, all shows struggle with this, even Mr Robot in places (with all its brilliance they still made mistakes)
