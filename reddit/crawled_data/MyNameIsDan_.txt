Shout outs to Kelly Oubre Jr
I don’t even remember. That series was rough to watch. 
Can the raptors please win a series under 7 games please. 
Got my slingshot in today. I'm gonna start using it starting week 4 of UHF. Been doing spoto in the meanwhile.

my chest has never been so jacked before.
UHF week 2 day 3

~3" Deficit dids, 155kg (no room on deadlift platform, used bumpers on weightlifting platform) for 3, 3, 3, 6 reps. Could've pushed for more reps on the last set but I already reached the 15 rep count for T1, and didn't want to push it and hurt my back. I will never get used to doing deficit deadlifts, they just feel so awkward.

Did some legs up bench for 185x8x4 which gave me a sick titty pump. I don't know about my bench getting better on UHF but with doing some sort of bench movement every training session I reckon I'm gonna go up a cup size.

Also a small victory: my girlfriend was having issues with back squats for the longest time (and was rather hesitant on doing squats) due to her flat feet on left side causing some issues with uneven leg opening as well as the torso twisting when squatting down. Tried the SSB last night and it looked a lot better than a barbell squat, and looks like it was more comfortable for her too. Guess she's back to squatting now!
[DIAGNOSE] When my girlfriend does back squats her left leg isn't as open as her right, and her torso is seen to do a mild twist when she squats down where the torso pivots to the left (right shoulder goes forward, left shoulder goes backwards). Her chiro did mention it has to do something with her flat feet that's worse on the left feet but I'm thinking there's more that's causing the twist in torso.
UHF Week 2 Day 2

Benched 250lbs for 3,3,3,6 reps. I probably shouldn't have went for the 6th rep, it was a true RPE 10. Surprised I managed it though, bench was feeling sorta heavy until the last set.

2-ct pause squats (beltless) after with 315lbs for 8x2. These were really easy. 

Deficit dids at 340lbs today, yay....
I had the old 7mm ones (the OG weightlifting/strongman pairs) and the new 7mm ones (the new one felt thinner however). The old 7mm had similar thickness to the SBDs but didn't feel the same. I think it has something to do with the length of it (aside from the tightness/shape difference that gives more support)

For reference I sized medium for the Rehbands and large for SBDs.
I much prefer Rehbands for weightlifting purposes but for anything squatting it's SBDs all the way. Even though they're technically same thickness as Rehbands, I feel like it changes my leverages a little, I just feel like I'm in a stronger position with them on.
I used to talk A LOT of shit to my friends that wore SBDs and I felt super validated when my sister bought me a pair. They're that good. 
Rehbands -> SBDs were a noticeable difference. If you really want to squeeze everything out of your equipment on the squat then you should do it.
We both appreciate food and enjoy eating food. I still remember the look on her face on our date (before we decided to get into a relationship) when I took her out for her first omakase. Looked like a mind blowing experience for her with how happy she looked every serving.
UHF Week 2 Day 1. 

Squatted 375lbs for 4x3+, managed 6 reps on the AMRAP @ RPE 9. Warm ups felt real fucking good but workset didn't feel so light, glad I got 15 total reps for T1 regardless. Did some light incline bench for T2 after that.

Benching 250lbs for same set x rep scheme. I'm sure I can manage the 15 reps. Doing some 2-ct pause squats (unbelted) @ 310lbs (probably gonna bump it to 315lbs) for 8x2. That should be fun.


technique technique technique. find your weak point and attack it. 
> The kids at Jesus gym started approaching me for tips yesterday. Does that mean I've made it?

Used to be me in my alma mater gym but now that there's a lot stronger people around I'm a no body :D
I try but my laziness kicks in and im just all eh. I will probably super set things on same machines like pec deck fly + reverse delt fly, or things that target different muscle groups (hamstring curls + ez bar curls)

The time isn't a big deal, just thought I'd get through things faster.
Week 1 of UHF was not bad. Workouts took longer than I thought even with timed rest. The extra set than I'd usually do for T3 work does add up and I find myself making use of warm ups and in between exercises to get more rest in lol oops. Doing some sort of lower body movement every day also really hit my appetite. Finding myself eating more than I usually would. As long as I don't get fat I can't complain.

Week 2 should be easier with the lack of rep out sets in T2. 

Overall, having fun.

Thinking of adding power cleans either on deficit deadlift day or on front squat day, before the T1 as a primer of sorts. Used to do this while doing 5/3/1 couple years ago and it wasn't too bad at all.
Disagree. He looks very flat here with the only defining feature here being his wide lats (and I guess being big).  

The pic OP posted at least brings out the lateral delts rather nicely as well as the nice bulky outer sweep of the quad. 

Angles, positioning, and lighting are huge parts of bodybuilding and with respect to bringing out key features it favours the OP pic. 
I did it boys. Gym girl is now girlfriend. Now my front squat session will suffer as our date last night went super laaaate. 
anyone know the song info?
Holy hell blazers are getting spanked hard. 
Been dating this girl I met at the gym for few weeks. We knew of each other before but didn't really start having interest in each other until like 3 weeks ago. Things are going really really well. Feels like we've expedited this dating process in a way as I work near her house, and we go to same gym, we've been going out multiple times a week outside of the more bigger formal "date nights", and every time it's been getting more and more intimate. Like last night it got pretty srs.

I've been very firm with my stance of being happy by myself as I haven't dated in almost 5 years due to dealing with mental health issues and stuff but it damn feels good to have someone to have feelings for and to be liked back.
I never truly appreciated the magic of his music until I started dating recently.
Unless you're doing weightlifting or crossfit (velcro belts are okay here) you should be looking for better things.
Larsen presses are really difficult and dangerous when the bench isn't wide enough.
I think a lot of it early on is going to be mental thing especially with some lingering DOMS. I'll for sure have to pay some extra attention to the joints and lower back to stay healthy.
yeah you can do that as well if you wanted the full interface (was referring to unlock in general then navigating to the app). if you didn't care to have a full on conversation or use the phone later on, as in you just wanted to send a reply and get onto what you were doing, that's what the quick reply is for. I personally don't use it much but it's there for people that do use it.
so that it saves you 1-2 actions to get to the app to reply to. 
it prompts for touch ID/passcode for security.
Week 1 day 2 of UHF. Benched 235x4x3+, managed 16 reps total. Did some light Paused Squats after: 290x3x7+, managed 26 reps total (had more, didn't want to push it). Squatting after bench felt hella weird. Got a sick shoulder pump after.

While I miss the organization of upper/lower splits, full body training so far is refreshing. My only worry is benching 5 times a week. Hopefully my shoulder/elbow holds up.
because I have no weak points yknaw im sayin cuz
I haven't done all 6 at once but I'm apparently 10lbs off (I am assuming you are correct in separating the clean and the jerk as separate lifts in the calculation. Though this makes it A LOT easier since you can double dip and sometimes like in my case be beneficial since my clean is higher than my jerk). 
His other DUP program was also popular until it got stuck behind BB.com paywall after their restructure as they have rights to it (though you’ll find spreadsheets floating around)
Week 1 day 1 of UHF in the bag. Squatted 355lbs for 4,4,8. Pretty ok for my 11RM. My ankle mobility has improved so I’m using more quads than ever which is making the lift harder (weak quads) but it feels better.  Did some light volume incline bench after that. 

My boobs better go up a cup size after doing some bench 5 times a week!
RDLs are a staple in my training as much as squat and bench are. 
if you aren't particularly keen on rate of progress (ie: you're not competitive and just enjoy the process) it's a good philosophy. You stay injury free, get to work on everything and become an overall better person physically instead of just having a really high squat/bench/deadlift.

I just found it stale after running for near half a year.
literally EVERYONE in my gym runs conjugate (aside from IPF heroes) and I feel like I missed the note on it in the contract or something.
If you're feeling REALLY good and curious about what you can handle, I'd keep it to that rep range, then climb up in singles until some degradation in rep quality is encountered.

Your TM shouldn't be affected by whatever weight you hit. Increase it steadily as you usually would.
(This is based on my knowledge before Forever 531 because Wendler changes things up constantly)

While not a true max test, when you feel good on a 3rd week of the cycle (the 1+ week) having run couple cycles already it's not a bad idea to toss in singles after to climb up to a heavy single (aka Joker Sets, which Wendler apparently regrets introducing). You shouldn't be failing though, go up to when you know you can't be going up higher.

If you plan on hopping off 5/3/1 to try something else might be a good idea to do an actual test on the final week, deload the week after, then start the new program.
im a sucker for anything haagen daas. 
I only had their chocolate and it tastes like those cheap chocolate ice creams with no dairy. I'll reserve my judgement on the rest of the line up but so far I'm not so sure on the hype aside from it being a bit lighter in macros
Having serious issues deciding on what to run program wise. While I wanted to run Sheiko AML it probably is not what I'm looking for since I don't want a pure powerlifting routine as I value my bodybuilding.

Conjugate looks kind of fun but overly complicated to fully understand it to make best use of its methods.

GZCL methods are probably what I'm going to go back to. It's simple and it fits my needs. I'm like 80% sure I want to go run UHF. Just unsure about going back to 5 day splits again and if my elbow will be okay with benching 5 days a week (albeit at lower percentages on most days), with slingshot replaced by paused bench.
WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
It is insanely valuable but when you use a number 1 draft pick you draft someone that could potentially be a superstar that can push the franchise to new levels. Especially with what they gave up to move two spots up in the draft. 
It’s a waste of a number 1 pick if he isn’t but with a player like Simmons he might work better as a sixth man especially if he doesn’t have push his shooting to higher levels. 
Yooooo we won a game 1. We’re going to the finals boys!!!
This weather is ruining my date tonight. Better safe than sorry, yes. But still cheesed. 
The greens and the gum bottom ones are HOT.
that is actually scary accurate.
Oh for sure. For me my fat intake was the biggest issue. I remember cutting with really low fat one time and getting an erection was near impossible.
better start learning how to handstand walk. might as well squat with your arms.
> I dont count calories so I check how horny I am at the end of the day. If I am not very horny then I need to eat more

I too let my raging boner dictate how much I eat.
Decided to do a 2RM test for front squat and deadlift so I can have up to date numbers for jizzy seal.

Managed 355x2 for front squat which I think is a very small PR (especially with new lighter BW). Also with all the mobility work I've been doing I'm actually positioned so much better in the bottom position, I'm so happy.

Managed 425x2 with conventional deadlift. As expected my grip is shit. That's a small 5lb PR with lesser BW+OPB which is pretty dece. I don't know if my quads are that weak but I definitely couldn't have done this with sumo.

Testing incline tonight.

Going into GZCL with 420/275/425/355/x (BS/B/D/FS/InB) which is a slight increase (well a decent one for bench) to everything but the back squat last time I ran GZCL when I was like 10-15lbs heavier. Still split on if I want to maintain a Lower/Upper split program (been doing this style for bit over a year now? maybe it's getting stale but it works well for recovery reasons) or mix it up and try UHF.

Also going out on another date with Ms Gym-Girl tomorrow. I guess this is technically our fourth date (we met for coffee and what not just to hang out and chat twice this week. Wednesday night got pretty srs though, with me serenading her with some Daniel Caesar). Still keeping this hush hush in the gym lol.
I guess he's mad that the Jordan 1 Shadow release is delayed.
I read something similar from israetel but I'm pretty sure that's only applicable to already lean and trained individuals. 25% is pretty high (assuming male) to get away with that being effective.
It's essentially linear progression with using the rep out set at the end to introduce some sort of autoregulation in the progression scheme in the main lift. You're gonna run into a wall eventually, which at that point you should back off, rinse and repeat.
I decided to yolo and say good bye to my program a week early and just maxed out. Made a 10lb PR on my bench (285lbs). I might have 290lbs if I was more fresh and smart about weight selection but I'm good with 10lbs PR.

So after losing +20lbs since last May, my squat went down by ~10-15lbs (2 mild injures since then and now which threw a wrench into things), bench went up by 10lbs. Don't know about deadlift though.

As per next steps, I'm split between just diving into Sheiko AML + additional accessory work, or some GZCL work. GZCL methods will work best with my goals (POWAH BUILDING) but I've been awfully curious about the mysterious Sheiko and the gains people seem to be making. For GZCL either running UHF as is or just vanilla GZCL method of upper/lower split but might steal the progression of main lifts from UHF.
I had to do that on my red eye flight from Maui to SF. Sat in 20 degree angle (out towards the aisle, she was sitting in the middle) and the right side of my body was sweating while my left side was chilly.

Worst flight experience, ever.
I went out on a date with a girl I met at the “new” gym I started attending two months ago. First date in almost 3 years. First date with someone I met at the gym (THEY’RE RARELY SINGLE). Went REALLY well and she wants to go out again. I’m a happy man. 

The awkward/funny part is that half the gym seems to be having feeling for her or something. I feel like I’m gonna be entering hostile grounds with all these horndogs that don’t know we went out on a date. They’ll prolly give me the cold shoulder or act passive aggressive if they knew lol. 

With respect to training, squats are feeling good. As I’m not as peaked due to taking that deload both squats and bench have been feeling heavy but man technique wise squat is on point. I’m gonna just slowly ramp things up and test maxes so I can start on a new program. 
lol joe chill
jab jab jab. no head movements.
pouring one out for Iaquinta
Wow antique Ben Simmons is still beasting. Almost but not quite. 
I’ve seen this narrative many times and it never goes well. 
oh wow tickets are only $20. Very tempted.
been around for while on GMod and TF2. Glad it's getting mainstream exposure this time around.
First week back from deload. Instead of working up to a 3RM to pick up where I left off, worked up to a heavy triple in squats. Managed 405x3. I don't think I can hit 420x3 as I wanted before I was forced to deload. Oh well. Just want to get this done so I can test maxes and start on something else.

Also started doing incline walks on treadmill when I can fit them in. Did it weighted last night with a chain around my traps (no weighted vests) and it was a lot harder than I remember the unweighted being.

Overall, good low stress LISS. Highly recommended.
You’re not wrong but my torso is short enough (my femurs are longer than my torso) that they all run too long for me for the most part. 
as soon as he gets his shot back sixers gonna terrorize. would it be dumb to have him (a number 1 pick) to come off bench as sixth man (basically a Ginobili role) in the long term? Especially with having Ben Simmons in starting role I feel like this would be a good fit
Damn that sucks. I knew something was up based on his Instagram story. 
Lol yeah that’s cheaty since the bottom position is the hardest place of the lift for the most part. Basically a really weak leg drive. Good grind though. 
Yeah Apollo is the best one I've come across though doesn't quite get there.
my \#1 reason for missing Android is the third party reddit apps. iOS variants just don't feel right compared to the ones I used in Android (Relay Pro was my go to)
My Amperiors left channel sometimes goes dull and requires plugging out the left channel and plugging it back in to get it sounding normal again. This periodically happens after couple of days to a week or so. 

Not really a problem but I was wondering why this happens when all they do is just sit on my office desk when not being used.
I think it's a little bit of column A and a little bit of column B. My power output in weightlifting movements did suffer. The weights feeling "heavy" could very well be mental though.
Probably based off the plethora of black/death metal bands he listens to on the daily.
Day 6 of going caffeine free (cycling off for a week and a half since im deloading anyways). It's incredible how much heaver weights feel. Weightlifting felt incredibly hard yesterday. I actually had trouble snatching 80kg which I used to do for power for reps. Clean and jerk felt stupidly heavy too. Went up to a heavy single of 85/115 which is okay I guess. 20kg off my best "caffeine best total" when I was like 15 lbs heavier (yes I keep track).

My body doesn't feel like poop anymore so that's good at least.
Bought it on steam sale and absolutely loved my play through of it. The gameplay is 2nd to none in 3rd person shooting. Controls and mechanics were TIGHT and just played so well. The level designs with respect to gameplay I thought were pretty fair and forced the pace instead of it being a typical hide behind covers and shoot being the entire gameplay however present it was. 

However I much preferred the dark grungy atmosphere and universe of Max Payne 1/2. 3 was dare I say a little too colourful to me (in both mood and literally). I’d love to see 1 & 2 remastered in this engine.
Brad Stevens will pull a miracle out of his ass. 
Does this apply to metro fair? I’ve always used 90210 when buying fare for NYC MTA but never got terminated. 
I think the Sean wotherspoons are gonna be my first resale purchase. I’ve rationalized it in my head while doing raffles that I know I’m gonna lose on. Hopefully it’s under $500 CAD. I’ll gladly pay that. Shit I’ll trade my Animal pack Am95 
I was thinking about cycling off caffeine for a week while I'm deloading. I know it's only a week and not a full 3-4 week duration but I'm hoping it would at least do _something_.

Today is day 1 and I'm already having second thoughts.
Candito likes wide stance snatch grip DL to simulate a similar deficit pull like position without it stressing the hip.
3RM test this week kind of sucked but I kind of saw it coming after how my back felt after squats and deadlifts on monday last week. I guess I do work better with a deload every 6 weeks or so. 

Was supposed to squat 420 for a triple (Did 412 for triple 3 weeks before) but couldn't even get a single out of it. Something just felt off and didn't groove correctly that day. 

Was supposed to bench 275 for a triple (Did 270 for triple 3 weeks before). This is my last tested max. Managed a double. The third rep wasn't there. Spotter mentioned at the time of grinding that last one my upper body seemed misaligned which does happen when I fail because of one of my shoulders being pulled forward more than other. Did another set at that weight for at least a rep, managed to get 2 reps in, and it felt better than the first set. I think I have the strength for it but not the technical development to be confident in doing it. Still an all time 2RM PR though and for sure a new 1RM is there. I'll take it.

I'm going to take rest of this week easy, take next week as a deload. I'll then insert a week to ramp things up then repeat this week again before I start the peak + max test.
I’m willing to pay resale for these 😫
Lol fuck saw this coming a mile away as soon as I saw the score differential. 
Ugh I don’t like big leads. It gives room for Raptors to bring out the old Raptors. 
yup... signed up for END, SNS, and Bait raffles. I'll eat up the duty for these.
lol the fabric and lighting makes it look it's photoshopped on 
An hour by bus, 20-30mins by car. I unfortunately don’t have access to car all the time but the gym is worth it. 
Get a large. I measured around 83cm and I fit the 3rd loosest setting in a medium. It did stretch a bit after wear however but still same setting. 

If you are going to make a significant weight cut I’d get their prong belt. Their medium fits me well but at the 2nd-3rd tightest hole. I’d imagine you can squeeze into it in your current state. 

Either that or save your money till later. 
Best in the city. 
Where was it stated he was drunk? I read two news reports and neither mention DUI. 

Yeah it was a terrible move to flee from scene. He was probably fucking terrified. It doesn’t mean I think he’s not in the wrong. If it indeed was a DUI then yeah he fucked up real bad and made a shitty judgement. I’ll still feel sorry for both the victim and him regardless for the potential consequences to his career that he worked hard for. Does he deserve the potential career ending consequences? Probably. But it’s still shitty. 

And I neither do anyone else here (except maybe Richard) know him on a personal level to claim anything about his personality/behaviour/etc. I’m not going to base my judgement on his character based on what I saw of him and his dad at meets or some rumours floating around regarding him. I’m not gonna hop on my high horse and be overly self righteous and label him as a shit stain on earth from this documented incident, like some people seem to be doing here. 
Kid’s only 20. You make mistakes and do dumbshit when you’re young. No shit what he did was bad. But when it has the potential to ruin a career that he spent his entire life for? Yeah I’m gonna feel bad for him. Why do I have to feel remorse for one exclusively over the other?
Making rounds in gyms. I heard it though a buddy training at Varbanov’s. Then every weightlifter coming in the gym mentions it first thing. And I’m sure it’s buzzing at Hani’s too. 
This is making rounds in OWA circles. Sucks to hear this. Poor kid. 
i dont know if it's intentional but the text for panels such as the date, author name, about, contact, and the tags and stuff on the bottom are tiiiiiny and hard to see (made worse with the colour combo) on Chrome
Alrighty boys final week of the mesocycle is here. 3RM test for squat tonight and 3RM test for bench tomorrow. Going for 420 and 275 respectively. I think my glycogen storage is more than full after AYCE sushi on Saturday (food coma poured into Sunday, first time experience lol). Should be fun time. 

I was thinking of heading straight into peaking phase after this week but might program in a deload week. My back was destroyed after last Monday deadlift. Or I might just take deadlifts easy for next few weeks. 
Available here for Canadians: https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/nike/black-and-white-air-max-270-flyknit-sneakers/2754268
no, unless you want to slip and maybe roll an ankle. Accidentally wore mine (it was really early in the morning...) hiking up at Whistler. Wasn't the funnest time.
Yup you’re right. Stopped by a store to try on a leather pair of AM95s and they fit okay albeit a little snug. Thanks for the input! 
I did a quick search around and it was close majority of people suggesting half size up. Not sure how these break in either.
Did you get same size for them? Just got a call for win on the 95s but since I entered for both was only able to put 1 size so won it in my air max 1 size... was told 95s run narrow so I’m kinda worried. 
Weird start to the day: 

Good news: won raffle for air max 95

Bad news: since I entered for both pairs was only able to input one size and I put TTS. 

I have sort of wide feet. Am I gonna fit into the 95s at all? Or am I SOL?
If I want to get a read on this before the movies, what's the reading order (preferably in the compilation books on amazon instead of individual issues)? Silver Surfer: Rebirth of Thanos -> Infinity Gauntlet -> Infinity Gauntlet Aftermath -> Infinity War? I've read a lot of people saying stop after that one?
Running through a program I butchered together like Dr Frankenstein. It's based on an old weightlifting program that's rather popular in the states. Just took the squat/bench portions, and modified it to fit my needs. 

[Read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/80thbo/february_28_daily_thread/duzevyh/).
wow my back's super jacked up after monday. It felt fine after squatting but the deadlifts really did me in. I'm feeling it mostly in the lower left part (and it's not my SI). Slowly getting better. I'm hoping I can go through next week's session before I need to take a deload.
So I guess the secret to winning is to be behind for the most part but in short differential. Plus no choking a lead away!
Between shoulder and hip. I have good hip mobility but the hip socketing doesn't seem to agree with me squatting wider. I get a bit more upright  in the  bottom if i go wider but i lose out on A LOT of power.
... just get em removed. It's just lifting weights, it's not gonna go anywhere. I think I was back in the gym in a week or something.
except you've completely skipped over the hardware differences in bluetooth vs wired headphones and focused strictly on the codec. 
Repeat the first half again. 

Or if you want something simpler but not as high on volume you can look into GZCL’s VDIP. I’m thinking of hopping on VDIP myself after my current program. It’s like a free flow autoregulated Linear Periodization. 
TTS. Might fit a little snug in toe box but it'll fit better a little after some wearing in.
I'm like setting a new bench PR every week. Hit 255x5 yesterday which is a new 5RM PR.

Next week is 3RM test week and I'm expecting to hit 275x3. I hit 270x3 2 weeks ago after doing 265x3 which were both PRs. I really hope I can get that 275x3, that's my last tested 1RM!
> Bluetooth is and will always be inferior to wired.

You're not wrong but for the mass consumer this isn't as applicable and Apple knows it. The quality and performance difference between an AirPod and a decent low end IEM (Let's say the se215) isn't going to convince your average joe to ditch the absurd convenience that comes with AirPods which effectively eliminated a lot of annoyances and complaints that comes with bluetooth devices.

Apple seems to have ditched the non hardcore audio enthusiasts while catering to the mass general. And just like their usual mantra with their mobile products, you either learn to use it like they intended or you go else where.

The hardcore audiophiles wouldn't be affected by this too hard since they already have a fat stack they've been using via lightning even when the 3.5mm port was available.
No chopsticks nor bowl. Yes to extra laces. A pink one and another green one (maybe a different shade?)
It's not the worst quality I've seen (The nubuck on my Kith x NB CNS 998s were A LOT worse). Not mindblowingly amazing (I think the Reigning Champ GLIIIs were one of the better ones I've touched, would've liked to see suede like that one used here instead of nubuck) but I do like theses. The leather treatment in the sockliner and insoles were nice tough.

Especially when you consider the retail price the materials are pretty good vs other shoes of higher price. Can't go wrong with ASICS.
I think it’s sold out. Someone mentioned in the release thread that they called in (not sure which location) but said it’s sold out. I’m told they had like 2 pairs at most per size (according to a guy in the line, not sure where he got that info though)
regular grey Asics Tiger box. Nothing special. The END drop was definitely the one to get if serious about collectibles.
Yeah I heard the stocks were really low. Thank god only 3 other people came early. 
Got the wasabi! Thank god it dropped on the day I was working from home. Took a quick trip downtown to grab a pair on opening hours. 

FYI: copped from livestock, doesn’t come with the chopsticks and other doodads. 
How do we lock up FVV
I think it's a technique thing. 

People definitely do jerk the log but may prefer not to because of how the weight feels vs the barbell or axel as it really wants to roll forward (centre of mass of the log is very far from body vs barbell/axel). It's also very very very technique heavy vs push press which weightlifters even have problems mastering, why add extra variables if push press is sufficient?

a relevant discussion: https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongman/comments/33qp4s/log_press_vs_jerk/
https://squatuniversity.com/2015/11/19/the-squat-fix-ankle-mobility-pt-3/

Depends on where you're feeling the limitation. If it's in the achiles/calf area you should roll it with a lacrosse ball, static stretch it, as well as roll your feet.

If you're feeling something is impacting it on the front of your ankles, the first one with resistance band pulling downward is really essential. 

What ever you do, just be consistent with it.
Seen him around on instagram occasionally. I'm more amused as to how he's able to get that belt on so tight. That's a strong big boy.
Anyone run both VDIP and JnT2.0? Did you think one was strictly better than the other? I think I want to a more base building thing before I hop into Sheiko AML. I ran VDIP before and I did enjoy the challenges it came with (it got really hard real fast for squats at least) though not sure if I want to do that over JnT 2.0. 
Been just wearing some cotton (sweat pants style fabric & texture, not fleece) shorts from Gap's fitness line. Mostly bought it because of sale but it's been holding up well. Usually wear them for upper body days. I do prefer to wear compression shorts for lower body movements but I can do weightlifting in them (occasionally) fine so I'd imagine I could deadlift and squat fine in them too.
I used to be on the same boat until I realized I don't really need to get that much out of the phone anymore besides the basic functions (call, txt, data, apps, camera). I do hate being forced to use the phone Apple mandates you to do though.
ugh this doesn't work in iOS (6S+). Even through bluetooth, camera app automatically closes if I try to resume music while recording. Guess that's another ding against iOS (keeping a mental tally to decide buying a new phone later this year, used Android for years until last year).
[3 weeks ago I tried to squat 395lbs for 5 but failed and only got 4.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfZOKoGhikd/)

Last night I took a knack at it once more but pushed the weight to 397lbs (added a pair of 0.5kg so it's basically ~180kg).

[And I managed to hit all 5 reps with better speed and cleaner reps.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BgPX5z5lNey/) 

"But wow, how did you manage to do that in 3 weeks??" you may ask. Well good sir, I just wore an inzer belt. It basically adds 5% to your squat vs weightlifting belt. I also started working on my ankle mobility more so it could be that too.

I also tried conventional pulls after and I immediately regret buying this belt (the lever feature). First time pulling conventional with this belt on and I think I pulled everything rounded back or something without me realizing because my lower back is sore as shit from just pulling 385lbs for 6 singles. It felt really awkward getting in position in the bottom but I just went for it anyways. Speed felt slower than expected but I brushed that up due to squatting 90% for 5 reps. I guess potential round backing is a more fitting culprit. 

I'm gonna try 1 hole looser and try wearing it higher up like I saw others do. I've been pulling sumo for the past 6 weeks and never really had issues with it and the belt. Time to find me a small modular screw driver to carry around in the gym bag.
I'd just stick to what's working for you. No need to unnecessarily complicate things when something simpler and easier is still working.
Half size up for wide footers. Split tongue ends up staying split if your feet is too wide. Length is pretty TTS though. 
 I hope I can cop these on Wednesday. Heading down to store for em. And no not camping out, mans got a 9-5 to do. 
I really like these side by sides. The old Gen leaving behind their moves in the future stars. 
Duck’s were such a clusterfuck between intermissions. I miss it. 
Have you tried wearing it a little looser and/or higher in the torso? I’m experiencing the same right now as I just started doing conventional again with my relatively new Inzer Lever Belt. At least you have the convenience to change tightness on the fly where I can be bothered to do so lol. Might just start using my weightlifting belt for conventional...

Worst case scenario you can have a second pair of belt for deadlifting. Buddy of mine with a very strong conventional does the same (switches to his Inzer prong belt). 

EDIT: just saw you tried higher. Try playing with tightness. Aside from the price I rarely see complaints on SBD belt
Calgary Barbell was really good for me. That as well as Stefi Cohen’s video she did with Omar on sumo. 
in your warm-up or on off season, try paddling the opposite side when on the erg to develop the non dominant side the same way you affected the main side (dragonboaters have a special paddle attachment to use on your regular erg to emulate paddling in a dragonboat as opposed to rowing, or use a completely different machine). That's what one of my friend intends to do this season for her final season because it already did enough damage to her shoulders that she has a bit of helicopter effect when benching (but she has the provincial junior record for it so doesn't mean it'll impact you that badly).
I'm sure you can try minimize the issue with some effort (eg: if you paddle the opposite side when you're on the erg). The most common symptom is some helicoptering effect when they (bench) press or stabilize weight overhead like in snatch/jerk.
Just note that your shoulders are gonna be affected in some way or another if you go hard into it. Every single dragonboater (like those that partake and win university meets) I met in the gym had some sort of shoulder issue because of the asymmetry in paddling causing noticeable imbalance. 
get 3! 2 for a peanut and 1 for the solo.
bulk vs fat is up to you and what you find is acceptable physique. Though thanks to muscle memory and how well your body remembers things, you can get close to 85-90% of your former self with a caloric deficit. It might even set you up better for future training ventures with the lower bf% allowing you to get away with a bulk.

If you want to keep it super simple, you can just do the classic 5x5 program (for the big compound movements) + additional accessory work.
is there actual poll for that? I don't feel like iMessage has that strong of a majority in Canada, at least in Toronto. Android presence is very strong here.
I look a little flat after ~3 days of not working said muscle. My lower body however always looks big.
easy sweep! Aside from catching the jerk everything looked like you were doing it like a warm up.

BBQ chicken erneh
I just came from that thread lol. 

With respect to the ecosystem and the features each platforms bring, I'm at a point where I've been exposed to both platforms and I frankly don't care what device I have. As long as it just works, has a decent enough camera, good battery life, and I can use the basic apps (instagram, reddit, youtube, netflix, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp, etc) then I'm fine (Though Android has far superior reddit Apps). Few years ago that used to mean you had to get an iPhone with Android devices outside of the Nexus phones being so subpar but as of 2016 or so you can't go wrong with either.

Coming from Android, iOS was a pain in the ass to initially use as it really forced you to use it the way they intended it and things like notification were VERY different from what I was used to with Android (and to this day I still find iOS notification pretty useless aside from the instant heads up display. Beyond that I don't know I even have notifications until I go back to home screen and see the notification badges or deliberately check the notification tray, whereas in Android unless I purposely dismissed them, the status bar will always let me know I have things to address) but it wasn't hard to adapt to after a few months. Visually I prefer the way Android looks though their UX can be (usually is) god awful with how inconsistent things are.

What is encouraging me to stay with iOS over Android is the Apple Store services, the plethora of compatible devices and accessories (omg AirPods), and knowing that other vendors will cater to iOS devices first (ie: financial institutions and Apple Pay. I don't think android pay supports my bank yet).

Come fall I'll see if I can last another year with my dad's 6S+ or finally get a new device. So far I'm leaning towards the new iPhone X variant.
It _used to_ be because of the freedom of access and usability of my own device. If I wanted additional features not found in stock ROMs I could venture down XDA and usually find something that'll keep me satisfied for a while. If I wanted to change how my device looked, felt, and how it was used, I could go on frenzy spree with apps and other methods that required root access to have my phone feel like it was a custom tool that was meant for me (I had that swipe up for app drawer for yeaaaaaaars thanks to Nova Launcher).

But as I got older with less and less free time (and the free time that I do have, I don't want to spend it playing/tweaking with my phone) I just didn't care as much anymore. I mostly cared for something that just worked and didn't have pain in the ass issues. After using an old iPhone for about a year (there was admittedly a lot of growing pains learning to adjust to the way apple wanted you to use a phone) I didn't really care too much anymore. Just needed a phone with the basic apps I need. Could careless about customization stuff that much anymore. They're just phones. Android or iOS don't matter much anymore since they're both very well fleshed out (though iPhone has the edge on the plethora of accessories readily available as well as the Apple Store services).

I might be back in the market for a new phone this fall. Let's see if the new Pixel is enough to sway me over to ditch the iOS ecosystem (...and more importantly my AirPods). The 6S+ is holding up REALLY well though, battery and all.

happy monday folks.
Yeah I take Metamucil daily. 
my bowel movement has kind of been sucking lately, not as automatic and free flowing as usual which makes me feel poopy but besides that life is good.

Going to take another knack at squatting 180kg for 5 tomorrow. I'm sure I'll get it this time around with just having the inzer belt this time around. If the 5th rep isn't a complete grinder I might go for a 6th just so I can set another PR for this final mesocycle (6RM, all time is 390lbs at a heavier BW).

I'm gonna give Sumo a go one last time tomorrow. Doing 6 singles at 385lbs with 90 secs rest in between. If my form breaks down again I'm just gonna pull conventional which I know will go pretty easily.

EDIT: [This is what I had on Saturday](https://www.instagram.com/p/BgJpaY9lk17/?taken-by=mynameisdmoon). Didn't really eat much after that besides some protein shakes and a cheesecake from cheesecake factory. The fat really makes the digestion super slow. [This is what we usually get when we get a group of 3-4](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bb7U-hBhhdn/?taken-by=mynameisdmoon) (was only me and a friend on Sat)
DAE RPE?
Local release this Wednesday. I’m hoping they sit like most ASICS drops here. Only one that really sold fast was the Reigning Champ collab. 
Is it still nephew hours 
would it be dumb to run sheiko AML after a peaking program? or should I do a cycle or two of GZCL (probably VDIP or the vanilla GZCL method, don't want to do another xRM style program) 
Hani being bitter about something that happened years ago (though that original instagram post is old too), and Clance (Maya's dad, the athlete being defaced on the poster) reacting like any father would when their own offspring is being insulted. It's an old beef you managed to find.
I guess when it's your own daughter (that you're very proud about, seriously he's her #1 fan in every meet, the loudest guy when she steps on the platform) that's being defaced you tend to have a harder reaction than one normally would. I don't blame him personally.

Ontario Weightlifting (well, the south east part) is a funny scene.
Laylor's daughters, maya and kia used to train with Kanama when they were younger before they left to train with their father full time. I'm told that Hani was kind of salty back then (this was a while back) because Maya is one of the stronger female lifters in the province and losing that kind of potential athlete is gonna hurt.
+1. I started with this and it has a good amount of volume to get you started. 
You need to wear the size that fits your feet as snug as possible without it hurting to wear. Minor discomfort when you first wear it is expected but will go away after couple wears (YMMV depends on the material of the upper but usually is the case) however it shouldn’t give any sort of pain to wear and walk around with it tightened up let alone while lifting. 

Honestly you could get away with whatever sizing if I’m gonna be completely honest. I bought my first shoes, Romaleos 2, with half size up for my wide feet as I do with a lot of Nike shoes (I tried on 9 and it was too narrow). Yeah there’s a bit of room in toes and some heel slip but shit it didn’t stop me from lifting and the misses I had sure wasn’t because of shoe sizing lol. In retrospect I should’ve got a 9 and bear with until it wore in and stretched (did this with my adipowers) but in the bigger picture it isn’t that big of a deal (until maybe you’re at a high level but by that point you probably went through couple pairs). 
Mental health therapy, and to keep myself from getting fat. 

Gym has done a lot more for my depression and anxiety than my alma mater therapist has (it was the only thing I could afford at the time). 
The one you’re remembering ended. There is a manga that picked up where it left off and it’s even more batshit insane than its predecessor. 
Depends on what the accessories are but having a dedicated day for GPP (and non comp related exercises) is a common strategy. 
Lol yeah no kidding
For lower body movements you don’t want compression in the sole. You lose out on force transfer and stability. Vans and chucks are popular in the gym for this very reason (and because economical). 
I'm skeptical of wearing Jordan 1s for gym uses because of the air heel unit. I know you can barely feel it but rather not risk it and wear vans or chucks to be safe. 

but then you see guys like Thor wearing it on the world stage. Maybe I should get a beater pair of 1s for gym instead of vans..
great to hear! 
Thompson fatbells are absolutely amazing for lateral raises. You go easy on the grip, let the weight rest on your wrist and it's all shoulders. I'm sure Donnie never intended his creation to be used for this purpose but they're great for it, haha.
[Tested 10RM squats. Decided on 355lbs after 345 flew up.](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bf9bX7NBpCQ/?taken-by=mynameisdmoon) 

But I miscounted and did 11 reps. Going by that I think I underestimated by strength for 10RM. I definitely have 360-365lbs for 10. All in all it's a 5lbs all time PR on 10/11RM so that's pretty cool.

Did some back off sets of 10 after. I usually do 95% and 90% (of 10RM) for 1 and 2 sets respectively, but I got light headed and did 1 each and started deadlifts.

Speaking of which, Sumo is getting super difficult after squats. Was doing 375lbs for 8 singles with 75sec rest. Form broke down after half way point and it was a grinder. For the 8th single I just did conventional and it fucking flew up lol. I think I'm done playing with sumo for the time being...

Doing the same for bench tonight. I failed 230lbs 3 weeks ago, managed 9 reps, failed bit off the chest. Going to warm up to 225lbs, see if I want to try 230lbs again or be ballsy and push it up a few lbs to do 105kg x 10.
I can't do anything without chalk.
There’s a decent sized group of guys at my local YMCA that are very big on powerlifting. Even though the equipment may not be the best, gotta make do with what you’re given. 
change gyms or get liquid chalk.

They use their Kizen Training as a platform to share various programs. Their recently released program is a collaboration with Sheiko which is just 2 of many programs under the Kizen name.
That's not the Sheiko collab program, it's their inhouse Kizen program.
you're wasting energy doing that weird pump fake before every rep on squats.

 for deadlifts you're losing tightness in your core/back and rounds as soon as you leave the floor (later reps you're just flat out round). Hips are shooting up first as well. Take time to set up on every rep, and take the slack out of the bar before you start. You're thinking too much on "pull". Think about pushing the floor away from the bar and think "lead with the chest" (DON'T hyperextend your back to achieve this). Pull the lats back and engaged as well.
in a bigger picture no, but enough to catch people's attention (hey looks like we have a post here!)
I think it was Jilly Jaworske.
with the increased racial tensions in the states against black people of recent (especially in a sport where black weightlifters aren't too common), yeah I'll speculate that. 
or race
heeled shoes still pitch you forward which isn't ideal for deadlift in powerlifting needs though. unless you're really trying to bring the load to the quads then deficit + weightlifting shoes will do that.
Starting the last mesocycle before the peak + test.

Working up to 10RM on squats today. Minimum 160kg (352lbs) but I might push it to 355lbs. Last tested was 350lbs (heavier bw like nearly 10-15lbs). I'll warm up to 345lbs belted and go from there.

Coming off a mild bronchitis-like symptoms, hopefully it'll be okay.
There was a female athlete that wore legless singlet in one of the AO's last year and there was no uproar at all about it, mostly guys just being pervs on instagram.

I don't want to bring up the race card but...
you get a TO, you get a TO, and you get a TO!
wtf tj
sixers getting roasted without embiid.
Tried these on today and they’re solid shoes! Going to wait on this colour way to make the cop. 
Oh wow didn’t even noticed it’s not latched fully. 
Yeah... def saw something fall off. 
Long arms and the negligence for potential pain/injury >>> super jacked in deadlift. 
Been living in cities my entire life. Can’t imagine living else where!
Not necessarily. JnT 2.0 weeks 1-6 can be run repeatedly, VDIP can be run indefinitely until you reach your limit. 

it’s ideal to test your 2RM after many weeks so you know where you stand with respect to TM for effectively programming in the long run. Even in vanilla GZCL method it has you eventually working up to your TM (not necessarily but a lot of his example layouts have the trainee do a rep out set with the TM to determine the next TM) but it’s no different from 5/3/1.
GZCL methods can be applied.

And honestly, 5/3/1 too.
The original BBB as first written is 50% all the way. There are new variations in Beyond 531 that toy around with it more. 
Yeah when i first started RDLs I started with like 155lbs when I was able to pull 385lbs x 5. If it was “too heavy” my back and glutes would take over most of the weight. 

Even now when I’m pulling +440 I rarely go heavier than 275lbs. 

Some argue that as long as you’re getting the proper hip hinge (hips back back back, knees unlocked) and you’re going low enough (~back parallel to floor) you’ll be hitting the hamstrings regardless if you feel it or not. I’m not so sure how true that is but I do find myself in that situation when it’s heavy enough (the hamstring stretch is felt less) but I do feel the DOMs afterwards in the hammies. 
You might be going too heavy in RDLs if you’re not feeling it or you’re lacking the mobility to hinge and push back the hips (which is surprisingly common)
Your training max doesn’t change until end of a cycle when you increase them as written in book. The 50% is off of your TM
10s week is actually the easiest believe it or not lol. Cardio+mind over matter thing. 

It’s been great for the bench. This week I benched 270x3 which is a new 3RM. more importantly it’s only 5lbs off my all time 1RM and I’m a lot lighter than when I hit that. 

For squat I’m coming off of quad tendonitis over the holidays and with the whole cutting weight thing and all things considered I think I’m near my old best strength level. 

Good amount of intensity and volume all cycled through in 3 week cycles. Kind of like 5/3/1 but with more volume (and maybe higher peak intensity)
From personal experience (and seeing others comment on it) horizontal rowing seems to be one exercise that is different for everyone from elbow angle, grip, super strict vs cheated.

Like when I DB Row I like a free flowing form (but not super cheated like kroc row) with both feet on ground, bent over with hand on sometihng to balance vs the strict form people do with knee up on the bench..
sans the in person later on, same thing happened to me. I did a lot of interviews with Google and other tech companies and this was the one occasion that I felt very very strong in. Solid solutions with full testing. Yet they rejected me after the second. For the reference, I'm a male Asian.
I think rows are something that everyone does differently. Strict rows in both bb and db have had zero effect on me (cable rows included). A loose free flowing form of DB rows (not insanely cheaty like kroc rows) hit my lats like no tomorrow as long as I'm pulling with elbows. Same thing applies to BB rows too: Cheated BB rows for some reason are really really good for my lats.
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/80thbo/february_28_daily_thread/duzevyh/)
A bit in between. If you flare too much you mostly target the posterior delts. If you bring the elbows in too much you tend to activate the biceps too hard. 
Haha nah no coughing, just phlegm/mucus, a little sore throat. But yes, good call. 
Hepburn method
Finished my second mesocycle of the program... and I woke up with bronchitis like symptoms. I either got it naturally via contagion or I beat myself too much in the gym (I had this similar symptom when I was running Bulgarian Method, it lasted like 3 weeks). 

I'm hoping it's not the latter because I was making such good progress so far. Let's see how the body feels under the bar on Saturday to make the call.

If there is one exercise aside from back squats, db rows, and bicep curls that I always leave in my training no matter the sport (Weightlifting, bodybuilding, powerlifting), it's RDLs. 
Light front squat (a lot lighter than you can normally do mainly so that it's loaded mostly in the legs and not the hips)

Belt Squat
I maintain my program and drop volume as needed. So far I didn’t have to drop anything as I’ve been doing a very slow cut. I’m managing to increase my strength, look more muscular (if that’s a result of being leaner or being able to pack on even an ounce of muscle in deficit [yes it’s possible just really hard] I don’t know.), and feeling good overall. 
I thought this was the norm... but apparently not.
Spoto and incline bench. These two really fixed my chest weakness and brought my bench up.

Toss in some dips too.
oh I always thought it was a figure of speech (to add oil to the fire). At world weightlifting championship i'd always hear the chinese team chant for their athletes with "<Full name> jiayou!"
try now. forgot to change access settings.

Partial valsalva maneuver (in the form of hiss or sounding like i'm blowing a raspberry) so that you don't lose all the air and thus tightness. 
[This program.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RSgrFkKjyhJRgh0grzUbe9TtEjawQEdn/view?usp=sharing)

It's a disfigured bastard child of LSUS weightlifting program, @damienpezzuti on instagram aka raw squat god, and myself. I basically took the squat progression of LSUS, morphed it into Upper/Lower split + WUP instead of block because I feel like running back to back to back of same x RM is gonna be fatiguing and just hitting the head against the wall with little progress.

I'm almost done with 2 mesocycles of it so far (ie: half way through week 6). I can't say that this program was the sole reason for the bench improvement but it is a main driver for it. Squats are doing okay too. I'm actually coming off a quad tendonitis heading into this and I'm almost back to my former strength (except now +20lbs lighter).

I'm planning to do a program review of it when I'm done all 12 weeks but yeah there's the preview.
Refer to a chiro/physio that has their office in some sort of gym, or deals with with athletes. It literally was my only way to figure out knee pain issues and was able to fix it so that I may be healthy to this day.
Just to add: It has to be under 30 days to be able to return for whatever reason. Though that's plenty of time. I made couple returns after wearing their running shoes for a day because of sizing issues. They're pretty good with it.

https://help-en-us.nike.com/app/answer/article/store-return/a_id/73/country/us
a little bit of a hack... nike.com let's you return shoes for almost any reason. Even worn, as long as it is in tact and good condition. You can try on their romaleos (it's gonna be expensive), see if you like it or not. Then return it.

If yes, buy the legacy lifters as they're same in the heel height.

The plate method is a good start though, just remember that it's 0.75" heel height.

If no, flat shoes for you.

if he/she meant briefs as in underwear (not gear), then it's those triangular underwear for men.
I think it's worth doing once every now and then to reinforce technique and proper core bracing (which some tend to forget when you've been using a belt forever). 

It also gives that same feeling you get when you get back on caffeine after cycling off for few weeks which is really neat too.
I feel like I hacked life or something. 

Worked up to a heavy triple last night on the bench. Initially planned on 265x3 and it went well so I tried 270x3 and it was alright, RPE9.5-10? That's a 3RM PR. But that's also only 5lbs away from my all time 1RM which I hit when I was +20lbs heavier, and I just weighed in at 191lbs today which is an all time low since 2013.

I got 1 more mesocycle before I peak and test. I can't speak much on the squat but I can feel a decent improvement in the bench coming.
much better. the first video you're essentially squatting the weight up. You're actually doing a weightlifting movement called clean deadlift which is mostly on the quads and holds you back vs conventional.
Heavy triple bench tonight (last night?). Aimed for 265, felt easy, so then I did 270x3@9.5-10. That’s a huge PR for me. That is 5lbs off my all time 1RM. Shit I might even have 275x3 in me but I’ll save that for 3RM test week in 3 weeks. 

I’m confident I at least have a 285 bench in me right now. Very happy with my bench progress. Getting closer and closer to me 300lbs bench goal for the year and March is only starting!
damn that's pretty alpha.
I've heard reviews claiming both ways which I found interesting. Haven't tried it out myself to attest to either side but I guess it wouldn't hurt to assume it's near SBD in performance.
Inzer 10mm lever. I tried SBD belt and it does give a bit more support but not to the extent it's worth double the price. what you're really paying for is the lever that can be set to any size on the fly (that and the name).

If you're looking to compete in IPF (USAPL) you're gonna have to be careful with your purchase (though iirc local meets outside of state/national levels will allow you to wear whatever as long as it meets the specs). See: https://www.andersonpowerlifting.com/powerlifting-belts-toro-texas-s/1833.htm (make sure it says IPF approved in product page).

If else, Pioneer has a great selection of good quality belt for a decent price.
I was forced to go to a commercial gym a month ago. Thank god it was lower body day because I probably was not going to get a chance at a bench with what I saw that night.
Knee sleeves yes. Belt? YMMV (you can get TWO lever belts with that money).
[Found it](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/7rsmpv/howdy_im_greg_nuckols_ask_me_anything/dsz9t6k/). his preview of it sounds better than the current Average to Savage already lol. He already has a program similar to JnT 2.0 that's available for free. Excited to see what this new AtS is gonna be.
If sister wives are a thing, why not bro husbands?
he wanted to cop a feel of that byubooty. 
Occasionally when he's around. Used to lift often with him back in the east location where he lives close to. 

He comes here every now and then to help promote the gym for Jeremy. Though when (if?) he gets back to weightlifting might see more of him since the west location is slowly becoming the better weightlifting gym.
I'm no where near your level of leanness to get away doing small bulk + mini cut cycles so I'm kind of forced to do long term things. 

I have friends in that bf% level and they swear by short bulk + mini cut cycles as it keeps their sanity and motivation in the gym in check while making good progress in strength.

You might want to ask around /r/bodybuilding for better perspectives though.

EDIT: See https://renaissanceperiodization.com/minicuts-dr-mike-israetel/
well I didn't mean to say you should hop on a peaking program after peaking program, just meant to work hard and not get discouraged.
The answers you're gonna get here are gonna be biased towards strength athletes and will tell you to bulk because you have abs showing.

I'm in the same boat (EDIT: as them): go bulk, do a mini cut, rinse and repeat.
You just need to go balls to the walls and work smart and hard. Like look at Layne Norton squat, that man is NOT built for squatting but he somehow had the world record in IPF at some point. 
if you're ever in Vancouver, you should (or probably shouldn't) check out east hastings vs gastown in the evening. It goes from this super fancy christmas market like neighbourhood to a HUGE homeless flea market just a street over. and they all keep to themselves in that section too, don't bother to go over to the brighter/cleaner area.
there's gonna be a 2.0?
reminds me of the old geocities/angelfire/asianavenue web pages.
I mean, you identify new & different weak points as you develop your strength and technique right? Makes sense to make adjustments to address them along the way.
I think I squatted 4 plates before I benched 2 lol. 
Turns out a proper belt makes a world of difference vs a tapered weightlifting belt (~6-8mm). I'm ready to out squat ray williams now that I have a proper belt. Just wait till I get tighter knee sleeves and A7/LVD headband!

Also found this in my newsfeed this morning thanks to a USAPL national coach sharing this on instagram. Technically **NSFW** (athletes/fitness industry personalities posing nude like the ESPN ones) but if you scroll down a bit you'll see a familiar vanilla gorilla 100% raw: https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bodies-of-work-volume-6.html (Again: **NSFW NSFW NSFW**. Mods delete this post if it is against rules, thanks)


It's a fun (and really punishing & humbling compared to powerlifting) sport but really requires proper environment to thrive in. Having a good training partner (and ideally a proper weightlifting gym) is absolutely essential.
The difference is the hip vs knee break. First rep has very little hip break and was mostly in the knees while second was a near even in both. The second rep has a more fluid motion with a better load distribution around your knee, quad, hip and back while the first one is a lot on your knees and quads until it can't get go any more forward so you sit back more to get lower. resultant bottom position is the same but the journey to there can make or break the lift.

Having said all that it's not drastically different but opt to squat like the second rep. 

PS: Ask sean if he's around rather than us. You'll get a lot better advice from him than us internet goons.
First rep was the worst one. Your chest caved under due to lack of tightness in upper back. The rest were better: you lose some degree of tightness like a lot of people do but you don't cave in like in the first. Nothing glaring besides that from this angle at least.
> The classic lifts shouldn't tire me out that much since I won't be able to use a lot of weight now

said literally everyone when they first started. Unless you have a sport/athletic background you're gonna have a new experience!
If you're just planning to toss in weightlifting onto whatever you're already doing as oppose to making a transition to the sport, just toss in the classic lifts (I'd probably do only one of snatch/clean and jerk per session. You might get tired out if else and spend a lot of time in the gym) BEFORE squats/deadlift. Do anywhere from 3-5 sets of 2-3 reps every session. And on those weeks when you can do a 5th session, work up to a heavy single on both lift.
Used an inzer belt for the first time for squatting. [412lbs x 3](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfratkYBiwk/?taken-by=mynameisdmoon) moved faster and easier than [405lbs x 3](https://www.instagram.com/p/Be1VhfMBCFn/?taken-by=mynameisdmoon) with weightlifting belt. I guess this is technically a PR 3RM (don't remember the last time I tested it since I injured my back before I was supposed to test 3RM last year. 405lbs is my all time 4RM but at a heavier BW).

I've now successfully evened the playing field. Just wait till I get super tight knee sleeves, and A7/LVD headband. I'm coming for you Ray Williams.
Look for an archive of pendlay beginner program. It has upper body work like bench programmed it. You’ll have to figure out the progression for it though. 
Be mindful to not overreach via T2 and T3. I was pushing quad work really hard and ended up getting quad tendonitis. The T1 work is essentially linear progression (weekly) so it’s taxing. 
I go to the same gym Omar does and we have the MG-2 and T grip bar (that’s the one he used it to do presses. I think it’s this model: https://americanbarbell.com/products/t-grip-double-angle-handle-bar-with-solid-ends). For vertical presses the t grip gets used mostly. The mg-2 is used often for rows and bench but I’ve seen Jeremy using the t grip for bench too. 

The t grip has a lot of utilities beyond pressing due to its versatile shape (really good for biceps actually, it’s my favourite equipment for biceps) but doesn’t have the close grip. 




VDIP is really fun until it got to higher %s. then it got miserable real fast. For lower body anyways. 
No they’re stupidly smooth fresh out of the ziploc. It still gets the job done but you might feel a little insecure about it. Rough it up, use it, abuse it, love it. It helps if the bar has rough knurling too. 
What are you using it for?
Duffalo Bar weights 55lbs so yeah it'll feel heavier by that alone. As per mechanics change making it heavier, not sure.
It's not the best but it's very versatile and could be made to suit what you're looking for. I did something like this when I was coming off an injury to get me back to my previous baseline strength levels: http://www.powerliftingtowin.com/beyond-531/
I find that ladies that know how to bench with an arch and all tend to grip wider than guys do despite the big difference in body size. They make use of body's leverages and mechanics a lot better than guys do.
could be worse, you could've bombed out like my friend did.
wide stance snatch grip deadlifts seem impossible for me. My arms and torso are short with long legs. I'm gonna look super comical trying it.
If you have any inclinations of doing weightlifting in the near future, closed loop.

Open loops can be utilized better for things outside of grip needs such as front squatting and using straps as grip. 
on the other hand, despite what you may feel it lets go of the bar a lot better than the standard strap hence why it's popular in weightlifting when you miss a snatch behind.

you can argue that you'll get the same safety mechanism if you only wrap it once with the standard strap but I don't think you're gonna get the same amount of grip support doing so.
I believe it's the program linked here: http://sheiko-program.ru/forum/index.php?topic=269.msg1601#msg1601

Was doing the search myself and finally found it.
you get the best of both worlds of lever and prong belts. It'll only pop loose if they're wearing it too loose and there's not enough adominal pressure against the belt to keep it latched, or if there is a malfunction with the lever which happens to all lever belts.

Is it worth the hefty price tag? That's per individual basis. Personally didn't think it was.
Started at 21, I hit 300lb squat in 3 months of lifting (I was doing sets of 5 with it). Road to 400 took longer since squat no longer became a priority and I focused on weightlifting... That took me around 2.5-3.5 years since starting? Still on that quest for 500 squat (turning 28 this August).
Made a small update: go up to the knuckle (if you can shove your whole hand in it _may_ be a little roomy). It should feel snug.

Two sources worth reading: 

https://www.strongerbyscience.com/the-belt-bible/ (ctrl+f "how to use a belt")

I really really really miss milk. Used to drink it a lot as a kid and through high school until I realized I was racking up calories EASILY doing so. 

It tastes so damn good though. The rare occasion that I get to drink milk, I cherish it so much.

On that note, I also really miss cereals.
I used to grind it a lot until one big spine injury (at least I think it's a spine, left a permanent bulge or something in the upper disc, no pain though) from doing so couple years ago so I know when to back off - it's not worth it lol.
I mean that would be ideal but I failed on my heavy set of 5 last week when I went from 385 to 395 so don't want to overshoot my mesocycle to mesocyle gains.

Then again I will be wearing a proper belt this time... Maybe I'll warm up to 405 single and make an executive decision then!

do this if you haven't. Came in clutch when I did weightlifting.
Worth adding that it doesn't seem to completely disappear. Even when things do get better it lingers there until it takes over again. A proactive approach is absolutely required to keep the your mind and mental health at positive levels to keep depression and related symptoms at bay.
My skins since rather sensitive and I'm getting some sort of surface skin bruising too.

Bruising/damaging my rib is like my worst fear lol, especially with the short torso and all (and my rib cage is rather large :/).
Have you tried the New Age ones or of variants? Their marketing says something like fixing your posture from clenching too hard or something. Not sure how true that is.
more of a mindset than numbers imo: when you can learn to think for yourself (with respect to programming at least) than needing a hand to guide you along every step of the way.
You'll find people preach different ways to wear it and swear by it. YMMV.

I prefer going tight. When relaxed it's tight but not unbearable, when I breathe out and brace against it, the inner body pressure is up the heezy (I actually see my posture change when I do this in front of a mirror, crazy). Generally you should still be able to squeeze part of your hand (generally the fingers up to the knuckle) within the belt. The moment you can't slip em in at all is when you've gone too tight.
keep em moist and maintained. 

Trim caluses via your preferred method (pumice stone + file, shave via razor, surgical precision snipping via nail clippers because you're lazy as fuck like me [probably not recommended]).

For hand care, hand lotion in the day time (especially right after gym since they've been covered in chalk for hours), hand salve before bed (I like Burt's Bees. You'll also see a wide selection in the rock climbing community stores).
wow this makes too much sense to ever happen.
Squatting heavy triple today but now with an inzer belt. It kind of hurts to wear (especially since my waist + hip bones are relatively close together as I have a short torso) but it makes me feel bullet proof compared to my weightlifting belt.

Having said that, [I did 405x3 last mesocycle](https://www.instagram.com/p/Be1VhfMBCFn/?taken-by=mynameisdmoon). I was going to go 410lbs this time but was thinking of making a little higher jump to 412lbs which is ~187kg, then have a crack at 190kg x 3 next mesocycle.

Is that 2lbs even going to make a big difference? I don't know.

Thoughts?


he does give a small suggestion on how to program in squats in the Input Help section. Worth reading over.
I want to say yes but his 6 weeks program is very squat focused (not really but majority of the responses on that program has been that it was great for squats, so-so for others. it's also evident from the way the squats are programmed) which might not go well together with respect to recovery.
ugh my obsession for a neat scheduling is gonna have me so stressed with that hahaha. but yeah that is an option.
The app doesn’t specify but there is an older spreadsheet for AML (seems to be near identical from quick check) floating around from the sheiko forums that specified Mon Wed Fri Sat. 

How was the fatigue from day 1 to 2? The bench volume seems like it can add up. 
Got curious last night and bought the Sheiko app. Plugged my numbers in and it suggested I do the AML. It looks pretty plain and vanilla but lots and lots of volume. 

My only concern is that I will have to alter the scheduling around slightly. Anyone ever had to do day 1 and day 2 in consecutive days? 

I have a weird work schedule for where I have to work from home twice a week (weird policy for contractors) but have to be on site for Thursday. And because of the way the rush hour traffic flows, it’s a pain in the ass to get to the gym on days I work from home. 

So I was hoping I can do a Mon/Tues/Thurs/Sat schedule but was wondering if the volume on day 1 is too much to recover from to do day 2 effectively. 


Still so salty about not getting the obsidians. Had it farted twice but NDC Canada messed up twice 😫😫

EDIT: carted* 
Legacy Lifters are what Romaleos 2 is basically except the eye lets aren't as durable. Aside from that they're solid shoes. Would recommend that over Romaleos 3.

Hard time recommending Romaleos 3 for retail price. What you get from the price you pay normally is just not worth it.
Start with box squats. Set it just above depth where pain kicks in. Don't use the box to rock back and forth, maintain you tension and squat to box, then back up.

When it feels better you can toss in some light single leg movements (split squats), then move onto replacing box squats with temp squats (slow descent).
Depending on how far out you are from your meet you can alternative just run it all in high bar.
Watched by old buddy bomb out in Nationals today. That sucked. Was his second nationals.  

I know he was dieting (he's a SHW, always the biggest guy in both height and weight by a good amount. wanted to lose weight for health reason) but he was pushing the weights fine before. Apparently was sick the week before and rapidly lost 10lbs.

Oh well, he'll come back stronger.
I measure around that in calf, around 35cm in knee joint area and grabbed large. It does bunch up a bit behind the knees but I wouldn't call it loose. It stays on fine but after a set it's a little bunched up.

However I am considering grabbing a medium down the line eventually (probably when their booth is in for the annual fitness event in Toronto). Putting it on isn't painful but I'd imagine I'd need to put more effort for mediums.

Which netizen group did this start from? Korean forums or else where? Because the konglish is hilarious.
Aw bummer, didn't know it was closing this coming weekend. Was hoping to visit with a friend next weekend.
Ramzy is unreal. 
Taught me to stay tight. Combination of that and incline press strengthened my chest weakness. 

A harder variation is to go all the way to the chest but pause on the upward movement.
what part of that is full screen?
yo sean i hope you copped that in a 9 like I asked so you can sell it my way
In Toronto, Canada.

Didn't have time to enter raffles for bred toes. Was thinking of going to a Footlocker that's not in a dense location (appears to carry it, FCFS) in the morning, maybe arrive an hour before opening. 

Am I wasting my time or you guys think I have a chance of copping?
Is sheiko flexible enough to add in additional hypertrophy work (lateral/posterior delts, arms, lats, hamstrings) in at the end or is the programs demanding enough that it'd impede on recovery/progress? I've been curious about sheiko routines but didn't want to jump into a full out powerlifting program as I do have aesthetics as a 2nd priority that I'd not like to exclude.
hear hear.

I'd even be cool with a squat only meet.
Looks like the Russian Squat Routine but reduced the frequency to 2 and added in bench and deadlifts. 

I ran it a while back while doing weightlifting. My first time doing a peaking style routine. I need to eat a lot of carbs for it. I did get a 13kg PR after the full 6 weeks, though not sure if the gains in BW (I ate A LOT of carbs because I was dumb and impatient) made it as impressive though.

I would NOT do deadlifts along with squats. This would mean running bench/squats 3 days a week instead (though I guess 2 day variation like this would work too). 

I would not not add in much accessory work for lower body. GHR, back extension, RDLs (not heavy)/hamstring curls would be it. For upper body would definitely add additional chest work, rows/pull ups, shoulder (at the very least posterior but lateral too), and light arm work to keep joints happy.

I don't think you should reduce max for this. Even 5% reduction is a bit much. Just increase your calories a bit (200-300 surplus) and work hard.
oh that's wild.
I'm afraid my fuck ups will end up in /r/blackpeopletwitter and /r/whitepeopletwitter
Did inzer change their sizing in the last 3-5 years or do they fit noticeably different after years of wear? I bought a medium lever 10mm based on my friend's 10mm lever which was a medium but fit somewhat loose, had like 2 holes from the largest setting? I received mine yesterday, put it on the same setting but it fits nice and firm...

I am slowly cutting away at the fat so I don't mind (large would fit way too big) but was wondering if the "wear in" makes it fit that much differently.
I just want +300 bench. when will it be my turn?
I used to hate it but now a day I love deloading. Let's me try things outside of the usual program (of course volume & intensity are kept in check) so it can get fun.
I'm walking around at 193lbs, measured around the navel 35" relaxed, 33-33.5" cinched. 2 holes left showing from the largest setting. I could maybe go 1 tighter but I don't wanna break a rib.

I think I want to stay below 200 for the next little while to stay lean and gain muscle in the next year or two. This belt will hopefully help with that hah.
the stiffness (10mm) didn't bother me when I tried it but I guess it's a different story when I have +400lbs of load on me. 

Out of the box it feels almost as sturdy if not just as much as when I tried on my friend's SBD belt. 

I'll wear it around the house periodically this weekend. I made a joke about wearing it to poop to really feel the abs contract but i think I'm gonna pull something if I do that lol.
Got the inzer belt in yesterday. Ordered a medium from trying on my friend’s medium but mine seems to fit a lot tighter with respect to the hole setting. I’m told his stretched a bit after a lot of abuse but to the degree of a complete 1-2 holes?? Crazy. 

If anything it’ll serve as a reminder to stay lean and not get fat even on a bulk as I only have 2-3 holes left... large would’ve been the other direction of running out of holes so this will have to do. 

Excited to give this a try next Monday. SBD sleeves made squats a bit easier. I can only wonder how much this belt will add vs my eleiko tapered weightlifting belt (~9mm)
The OGs were my fav. Settled with navy because I didn’t want to stress about it getting dirty but the white ones were so nice. 
The “leather” (if you can call it that) looks so much better after some wear and stress. Great cop!
Copped the OG navy this morning. Had a discount code lying around so got 10% too. Excited to get mine in. Hopefully it fits alright. I love how the navy colourway looks. 
I don't know why you're being so snide. Like you stated, it is unoptimal and makes things more troublesome than someone that has better leverages all things held equal. Not like I claimed I'd be a weightlifting badass if I had her leverages...
yeah but you forgot the key difference where im a little bitch and he's not.

at least his hips shoot up in the snatch pull like mine, makes me feel less shitty about my first pull.

It still isn't the ideal ratio for weightlifting though.
and not all powerlifters are fat.

If you go into your local weightlifting club you'll notice on average their upper bodies are very undeveloped compared to your average powerlifter/bodybuilder as there is very little focus on the upper body exercises outside of the occasional press/push pressing. It's also very exhausting to throw in bodybuilding/hypertrophy/pump/whatever you want to call it session at the end after a training session consistently.
83kg guys squatting ~240kg, pulling ~250-290kg. Both went from Inzer 10mm lever to SBD.

I've tried their SBD but not Inzer 10mm lever. I did try on the single prong and can say that the SBD indeed feels sturdier with more support (but not enough to justify the price diff). I'll try on the 10mm lever tonight (just arrived) and see how it feels myself.

Either way it's an upgrade for me.
i heard even number of anecdotes on 10mm vs 13mm to pick one over another with respect to efficacy in lifting so I just went with the 10mm. Even from friends that went from their 10mm inzer to SBD, they didn't seem to find enough difference in the support to affect their lift.

but who knows I'm only squatting/pulling 200kg with a tapered belt, even a thin 6.5mm belt that has 4 inch width all around would  be an upgrade for me with respect to support lol. Maybe I'll get a nice Pioneer custom 13mm belt in the near future.
her leg to torso ratio makes me green with envy. I'm the complete opposite and makes weightlifting difficult. 
it's worth slightly more than 2 inzer 10mm lever belts in Canada. I mean, if it magically lets me squat over 500 (eg: add 60lbs to my squats) then yeah I'd pay that much.
oh yeah no doubt. 
nah you're right but I just find it to be overkill with respect to bang for buck. The adjustable lever on the fly is great but that + whatever amount  of additional gain I get from it vs Inzer 10mm lever doesn't seem worth paying that much (it's worth a little more than buying 2 inzer belts in Canada).
I mean it was a simple joke like how weightlifters don't look like they go to the gym at all but ok. sorry if you're offended.
I also just use water since I stopped  drinking milk lol. The chocolate flavours are good in greek yogurt too if you're into that kind of stuff.

And yes +1 on blender bottle. Mixes well, don't remember  the last time I had clumps in it. Costco sells a pair of blender bottle (different design, it's shaped like a nalgene more than the bottles you see in the gym). I think I prefer this one over the older ones I used.
Water is fine. Milk works too. It changes the flavour making some taste really good vs absolute garbage. I judge flavouring via water since that’s all I have access to at the gym. I suggest you do similar if you plan to drink it where you don’t have access to other fluids beside milk. 

Start with 200-250ml water per scoop (remember you can always add more fluid but can’t remove). 
It has an air unit in the heel. Whether you can feel it or not is up for debate but it is indeed there. Same with Air Force 1s (first basketball shoe with air unit. Hint: if it has Air in the name, chances are it has some air unit in the midsole. )
I actually wanted a single prong too from Pioneer  (could get a pure 10mm leather without suede from them instead of 6.5mm leather + 3mm suede all other belts have. Basically get the support of 13mm belt but a lot more pliable so I can get it tight and loosen without too much issue). The inzer belts have a layer of cheap stiff leather which keeps it relatively stiff for a long time which I didn’t like when I tried it out. 

Basically my purchase was mostly economical minded. 
Only prong belt I have access to in Canada without being hit hard with duty and shipping is inzer belt and wasn’t the biggest fan of it. Tried on 13mm single prong and it felt impossible to get out. 10mm wasn’t as bad but I could see myself struggling to get out if I get too tired. 

I heard a lot of horror stories with bruising and 13 mm so stuck to 10mm for now. In the near future if I get that strong to find the extra thickness necessary I’ll consider it. 
Finally ordered a proper belt (Inzer 10mm lever). I'm not a total powerfatty yet to commit to a SBD belt. Maybe one day when I can comfortably hit 400 wilks I can buy one without embarrassing myself with IPF-tryhard status.

Let's see where my squat and deadlifts go with a proper core/back support instead of my eleiko tapered belt (It was the 8-10mm leather one, not the cheap plastic belt).

EDIT: Somehow already arrived at home... Placed the order on Tuesday. That was fast...
I didn't think it was worth buying. The only thing new I learned from it exclusively was partitioning your meals throughout the day in not only just general timing, but the macro spread as well. They take consider your training sessions (time in the day you train, rest days) and offer couple templates for you to apply.

However along with anything done by Mike Israetel, it's overloaded with science and details to optimize it with respect to what they know works. Unless you have a really good discipline in your diet already (ie: you aren't a recovering fatty like me that is a total foodie), it's not going to help too much. I don't doubt the shit there will help my diet but it really over complicates the process for an amount of gain that I don't think is worth the effort.

The best dieting is the one that works for you, and I need some sort of simplicity/flexibility in my dieting to make it work for myself.
Candy toe 6 weeks is great for squats. YMMV for deadlifts however.
I had to go to bed before the deadlifts for 72s started. I thought Alyssa was going to make up the difference with her monstrous pulls but wow Rhaea maintained her lead! And to follow it up with equipped session today? Monster.

Maria Htee is in another class. I got so disgusted by how ridiculously strong she was. 
I don't know why people lift in 1s. I wouldn't even risk it with the heel air unit (you'll feel the air when you really break in the unit after many airs).

You do look super fly in the gym though.
bang for buck: Inzer Iron Z

Money no matter: SBD Flex
If I got a dollar for every time people made a big deal about that..
FWIW, according to the rule book that's supposed to be a failed lift as nothing else besides the feet are allowed to touch the platform.

However they're rather inconsistent with it, and they passed her snatch in both 2012 and 2016 in similar manner.
Pushed my 5RM on bench by 5lbs to 250lbs. It's feeling good though I could probably use a little less of my ass coming off the bench. Been working on the foot placement and leg drive as per the JTS videos but it's a work in progress.

Overall very happy with the bench, hoping to hit a 10-15lbs PR by the end of this cycle.
We have both at the gym I train at in black zinc. They're the same thing in practice but the KG version is IPF approved, with shorter sleeve collar giving you a little more room to load bars. Is that worth the extra cost? YMMV but they feel the same to me. 

But it is worth noting that the shorter sleeve collar can make a difference depending on how big your rack is. The ones we have are rather compact and demands a good walk out. With the KG bars I sometimes hit the rack with the loaded plates.
Doesn't matter. no rules for depth. 

The lower you can catch it with stability, the better potential for lifting heavier weights since it doesn't have to travel as higher.
it looked pretty tricky on first glance. Each setting corresponds to a specific load placement to mimic various squats (Front Squat, SSB, back squat, goblet squat). See: https://store.kabukistrength.net/products/transformer-bar?variant=1129225650190

A gym buddy that used it for the first time said it was pretty difficult at first but got the hang of it. It seems to get more use than the westside SSB we have.
Any time! Hopefully you'll enjoy their product as much I did. Their NZ whey is top notch.

Also highly recommend their pre-workout (C-Pre) if you're into that sort of thing.
yeah that's the vendor I was referring to. I emailed them two weeks ago about the other colours being restocked and they gave me an estimate of 4 weeks. Just sent a reply asking if they're allowed to share if Forest Green 10mm Lever M was in that shipment so that I'd know to delay my purchase or not.

Vanity/Fashion matters a lot!
I wear black shirts in the gym mostly so it's not a concern for me (Don't really care too much for my gym shirts looking crisp for that matter).

Best Belt's forest green looks super nice too. If I was in the states and needed IPF Approved single prong, I'd get it from them. If I didn't care for IPF Approved I'd probably get something from Pioneer.

However I'm trying to keep my purchase local in Canada to avoid duty and shipping fees to keep the price more reasonable. And the only vendor here sells Inzer and SBD belts. There is another that sells rebranded Pioneer belts (Pioneer does wholesale) but I don't like the look of them, especially with the obnoxious logo.
I think it really depends on how similar/different your technique are for high vs low bar (I'm hip dominant with short torso + long femur and my form for two are drastically different). 

On average it is a valid way to go about doing it, especially with low bar is messing with your elbow health.
Bench: 275

OHP: 175 (my OHP is more like an Olympic press with the crazy back lean)
[Took 395lbs for a spin yesterday \(~90% of last tested max but might be more like ~92-93% now?\). Wanted 5... got 4. RIP me.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfZOKoGhikd/?taken-by=mynameisdmoon)

Overestimated my mesocycle per mesocycle strength gains. Did 385lbs x 5 @ 9.5, 3 weeks prior. Probably should've went 390lbs. 

I also really need to replace my weightlifting belt. Don't want SBD. Local Inzer vendor only has black ones... I want that Forest Green though..

Also tried the belt squat machine (the non cable variant). Set up to really hammer the quads instead of hips/glutes (as you can see from linked video, my quads are weak). Man that shit was HARD, and really dug into my waist bone.
I wear a 9 in AM1 and a 9.5 in AM97 (runs a little long but TTS is too narrow). Should I go TTS or size up for these? Yeah I know chances are I’m not gonna get a W but just in case...
I'm having a hard time justifying that price tag especially when I'm more of a gym rat than a powerlifter (ex weightlifter turned "powerbuilder" after circumstances forced me to quit weightlifting full time). 

... and my powerlifting friends will give me all sorts of shits for buying one that'll force me to change my identity and start a new life.
I'm currently using a eleiko tapered single prong belt. It's ~9-10mm thick but the difference in abdominal coverage is worlds different compared to the inzer/SBD (and heck even a cheap 6.5mm belt that is full 4 inch width) belts I tried on. That 2.5 inch in the front can only cover so much of the abs. So I know for a fact I'll feel a lot durable with it on (especially that SBD, golly that thing makes me feel bulletproof).
I want to get a dyed leather single prong from them with no suede. 10mm of pure leather.

I know i'm most likely wrong. but I'm in a stage of denial where I'm thinking I could've got that 395x5 if I had a proper belt like an Inzer/Pioneer belt lmao
My only issue with them is the price (I live in Canada so chances are I'm gonna get hit with duty). I plan on getting a single prong from them if I do. Their belts seem pliable enough to tighten/untighten without issue over time unlike Inzer's prong stuff.
[Took 395lbs for a spin today \(~90% of last tested max but might be more like ~92-93% now?\). Wanted 5... got 4. RIP me.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfZOKoGhikd/?taken-by=mynameisdmoon)

Overestimated my mesocycle per mesocycle strength gains. Did 385lbs x 5 @ 9.5, 3 weeks prior. Probably should've went 390lbs. 

I also really need to replace my weightlifting belt. Don't want SBD. Local Inzer vendor only has black ones... I want that Forest Green though..

Also tried the belt squat machine today (the non cable variant). Set up to really hammer the quads instead of hips/glutes (as you can see from linked video, my quads are weak). Man that shit was HARD, and really dug into my waist bone.
Very doable. Did 4x10 with ~70% last week.
Cream of Rice + Whey + Peanut Butter + Some sweetener for flavouring (Hershey sugar free chocolate syrup comes to mind).

Mountain Dog approved.
The SSB I used in my previous gym made me wish I was dead with how the weight felt. The current gym I'm at has that kabuki transformer bar so I might play with that after I finish my current stint on this program.
with my body proportions I can hardly feel my legs working when I squat low bar. I'm a hip dominant squatter and low bar just really brings it out.

On the other hand high bar is not efficient for me what so ever but I don't compete so don't care too much about the optimal.
if you have the stamina/conditioning to add in hypetrophy work at the end of your sessions it's very doable. However pending on your training, you'll be pretty tired/spent too much time in the gym to be pushing yourself through it consistently.

Duffalo bar + incline is ROUGH. After 210lbs for 4x10 on flat bench, did 135lbs incline for 3x10 with the duffalo bar and my shoulders and titties are DONE.

[Here is also a really shitty snatch complex.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfT--ODBWdj/?taken-by=mynameisdmoon) Haven't snatched around that weight (90kg) in half a year.
I need these in my life
Okay, that was good.
Back in wrath, bartender would randomly fuck up for me where none of the hotkey would respond at all, not even clicking. UI reload would not fix it either, I'd had to reload WoW completely. Never figured out what caused it.

One time this happened to be mid arena so i had to start typing out the abiliies one by one. As a rogue it was stupidly frustrating but we somehow got the win lol.
Metallic 5
Def worth it. My favourite pair. 
TTS, a little narrow in toe box but not too bad. 0.5 size up works too but mad heel slip. 
Somehow won a raffle for these, my very first raffle win. Pretty happy too seeing as how Nike.ca seem to have shat the bed last night, and because I’m paying less than what other folks in my province have paid. 

Nah. Go watch their show lol. It’s sad. 
When his girlfriend is there she cuts it up for him. Even on a date night...
How do you not know the property brothers?
Watched the JTS squat pillar video today and I finally learned what people meant when they said to drop your elbow under the bar lol.

Looks like I'll be squatting 500 in no time.
They also probably inject saline into it to get a more plump shape. Hence why it looks bigger with less % of meat protein.
Did 305 for 4x10 last night and it moved very well. My near maximal weights aren't moving the best at least the sub maxes are moving better than they previously did.

Just watched through the squat pillar JTS vid and I'm gonna play with my setup and breathing next time. There is definitely room for improvement.
Every post I'm increasingly convinced you got some satanic Dexter thing going on. Like what is this: angle, red + black contrast, cult like hood, the gothic music.
To throw my numbers as example: My all time strict press is around 75-80kg while my power clean + push press is at 120kg so.... yeah. My upperbody is also weak as shit. I was barely able to press 70kg when I got that 120 push press.
I only have experience with Iron Mind straps but they are the standard when it comes to straps. I bought two pairs of weightlifting straps from them like 6 years ago. I’m still on the first pair despite almost daily use of snatches, cleans, and deadlifts. They’re visibly beat to shit with some fraying here and there (and one of the loop is undone so it’s just a strip of canvas) but they’re still just as effective since day 1.  Friend of mine owns the standard straps from them for many years now and still going strong. 

Spud straps are also widely recognized for being tough and durable. 
They’re strong man straps. You put one loop on wrist, bring the other loop under and around the bar and back onto the wrist, effectively hanging by your wrist even without grip. 
Lol RPE 8 is the hardest for me to gauge.  +9 is easiest. If I could gauge RPE 8 better I’d go full autoregulated. 
They mean RPE - Rate of Perceived Exertion.

best inferiority complex in the league, don't @ me
20lbs is a lot to gain, dirty bulk is gonna get you looking fat especially if you don't count. I've done it few times, never again lol.

Take it slow and conservative. If you're relatively lean now, you don't want to end up losing all that hardwork and end up looking like a slob 20lbs later.
Remember to do it in the red light. It'll raise more eyebrows.
The ones that claim it's too long are probably casuals/beginners that claim that stress starts to set in and that work you put in after 60-90mins is like 25% effective. I remember this floating around in /r/fitness back in the day.
Ask for the best for prime safety. Like that fancy SBD one.
I've been sticking to NZ Whey (it tastes cleaner so I stick to that one, the non NZ whey does have a slight different taste) in Vanilla and Milk Chocolate (they have different chocolate, milk chocolate is the newer one, does taste like chocolate milk though they can tone down the salt a bit. the other one tastes like hot chocolate sort of).

Cookies and cream was good but only with milk. Wasn't too big on cappuccino. 

They do sample packs for like $2 so you can try couple orders of that to see which whey and flavour you prefer.

They also sell bulk supplement so those are good to look into. I use these guys for my whey and creatine (creapure). You'll be hard pressed to find better prices (non sale). If you're into using a pre-workout, their C-Pre is really nice. I'd prefer more caffeine on it so I just buy caffeine pills to add onto that.

It's free shipping after $99 (before tax) spent so it's a good idea to get an idea of what you like/want and do bulk purchases every 2-3 months.

MyProtein (from the states) does ship to Canada as well for a not too bad price. They're fairly well liked by people so that's an option too. They can get stupidly cheap if you can time their sales. They also sell protein snacks too.
I don't think any of the vendors in Canada do custom mixes like TrueNutrition does. I just order bulk from Canadian Protein and haven't looked back. Their New Zealand Whey Concentrate is my go to. If you live in Ontario the shipping is pretty damn fast too.
First time bulking or have you done a bulk of some sort before?
I don’t think they fully lost it but I recall having a few moments where my heart rate was rising. 
Good old raptors shitting the bed and slowly losing the lead. They never let me down. 
The only time I saw it was when there was a mascot royal rumble wrestling on half time. They brought the Seahawks mascot and everything 
Can the raptors not lose please? I’d really appreciate it, thanks. 
How strong does my grip strength have to be to understand rick and morty 
some random tidbits:

take it slow and be patient. you're not competing where it's necessary to get down to a specific weight by a certain date. 

don't be obsessed with your search for optimality. whatever is working for you is a good solution. Sustainability is the key factor. You want to have a bit of ice cream every day? Find a diet that can work with that. 

don't obsess on the fine smaller details. don't worry if you mess up your diet for a day or something. It's what you do +80% of the time that matters the most. Just carry on and pick up where you left on the next day.

Most important of all: don't let your fitness/diet control your life. If there is some non trivial social event coming up, don't turn it down saying "oh I can't fit the macros into my diet". It's just one night. The sooner you make this "journey" a lifestyle instead of a temporary thing, the faster it'll become easier and natural.
my mom's a fan of Tim Duncan so it'd be cool if I did that.
i wear compression shorts for lower body sessions. Nothing gets in the way so it feels nice, and I get to show off my butt and legs for once. 

When legs aren't involved, I just wear shorts.
Depending on where “mid” actually is, it usually just means you have weak chest like most raw lifters. Spoto or incline would help. 

I’d probably just stick to the program though, it’s only like 4-6 weeks iirc?
Red light. Face blurred out. Looks like a crime scene security footage.


> INOL for squats yesterday was ~1.4 doing only triples. Thinking about ways to increase that. Also thinking about actually figuring out how INOL works.

Are you squatting only once a week? If you're squatting multiple times I'm sure it'll add up to be between 2.0-3.0 which is fine.

I used to like squats because I got good at it but after doing weightlifting for couple of years I hate squats because they're hard and tiring.

I think I liked it only because I wasn't god awful at it.
> Oh wait you're in Toronto? That explains everything

I swear all the folks outside of Toronto (or mostly folks from Ottawa) say this to me (in any context) when I travel and they end up being jerks more than anyone I met in Toronto lmao.
Mac as in Hamilton? Check out Crossfit Battlefield. Buddy of mine trains there and it seems to have a decent powerlifitng community there. Hopefully you have a car because Hamilton transit doesn't seem very active lol.
I think they have that for athletes that are known for anabolics. As per how they'll figure that out, who knows. Maybe they'll stalk your instagram super hard.
Another tip is to try using straps every now and then especially if you feel beat up at some point. Taking the nerves/senses in the hand out of the equation surprisingly saves the body a lot of beating.
Toronto/Mississauga. Used to train weightlifting out of U of T Athletic Centre but the scene (both powerlifting and weightlifting) died hard as we got old and graduated and had actual life stuff to worry about. 

Training out of Fortis Fitness (west location) right now (East location is legit too). Good crowd for weightlifting/powerlifting/strongman (and yes, non CPU guys train here too).
Oh those bunch. Yeah I'm finding that to be a common thing in Toronto too (aside from like 2, everyone I know competes in IPF). And it's the mid/lower tier guys that's usually being snobby about it. 

I guess it comes with the availability in the location since CPU is very dominant in Canada compared to other feds.
I'm pretty sure if you look at your program you'll also have deadlift from pins/blocks at some point. It's a common approach to break up the deadlift into two ROMs to overload while not taxing the body's recovery too hard.
see if your university has a powerlifting club. it's been getting more common to have one since couple of years ago when powerlifting went mainstream.
that's an issue with the federation more than anything. If their rules allow high squats to be legal he'd be at a huge disadvantage going full depth. 

As per why he's competing in that fed vs a less controversial one, that's probably on Louie more than anything. Who knows what his reasonings are.
where are you located? I only had success via just jumping around gyms and making friends/gym buddies directly in person.
you're going too heavy/have it set incorrectly/machine isn't compatible with your leverages.

Leg extensions are a legit exercise for rehab/prehab. It was a key component whenever I have tendonitis - light weight, lots and lots of controlled reps.
let me guess, SPF?

EDIT: by the same guy - https://www.instagram.com/p/Be-pG8kgcV7/?taken-by=anthonycw13

that looks fine though.
I used to be a big fan but now it just leaves me craving for more genuine intimacy with a partner.
You need to give us an example of how you free squat with that stance to get a better idea. You're still flopping down on to the box as shown by your knees just falling back once you reach the box. You're losing all tension you built up to get to the box. If you can't control your sitting back onto the box you're standing way too wide. (Protip: Not everyone can squat/pull with super wide stance. "Wide" is relative per individual) 

You also need to lower the box by an inch or so, it's too high above parallel.

EDIT: and since we're citing west side now - https://www.instagram.com/p/Be-pG8kgcV7/?taken-by=anthonycw13
you could've just approached him and asked.
how was your ankle mobility when you were still a novice/intermediate? your ankle mobility is like chinese level now
Start off with basic ankle rockers. Something like 3-5 sets of 10 each side every day. Try to push the knees towards the middle of the foot (or towards your pinky toe, you'll find it going that direction if you're really trying to open your hips up).

If you have access to stairs, stand on the edge of stairs with your forefoot supporting you only and let the heels drop. Do this one foot at a time. This is to stretch the calves.

That's the basics you can start with. You can gauge your progress by seeing how far the knees goes while in squat position or while kneeling on one knee, feet flat on the other. You'll hit a diminishing return point and have to get a lot more creative by using resistance bands, weights, lacrosse ball, etc.
[I should've done 345lbs x 10 >:\(](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfH6XqlhCU7/?taken-by=mynameisdmoon).

Got conservative and did 341 (155kg) x 10. Was easier than I thought.
Ahhhh right. Totally forgot about strongman movements. 
Wherever Metal/Titan/SBD gear is sold. Those are the common big names at least. For the time being you can just wear knee sleeves over your shins. 
In what movement do you find the transfer of jerks? Outside of weightlifting specific I feel push presses are all around better movement. 
Congrats on your new RPE PR (if not an actual PR pending on your programming)
I don’t know what I’m more impressed by. Stipe’s boxing or Roy’s chin. He took a lot of solid shots but still standing. 
RIP
I have somewhat wide feet and I have a pair in TTS and 0.5 size up. I prefer the TTS fit. 
Back to 10s week. Last time I squatted 330x10 at around RPE 8-8.5. Wondering whether I should go 340 (or 341 I guess) or 345. I want to be able to hit ~352x10 (160kg) by next 10s week (3 weeks) just so I can finally set a new 10RM lol. 

I mean I can always just slap on the kilo plates and do 155kg this week and 160kg next 10s week but I love the sound of the old school iron plates clanging every rep. It's like orgasmic.
I appreciate the utility of it but not so much the aesthetics of them, not enough to pay extra to get it customized anyways. 
Stance difference between the two makes sense since you want to be able to remain up right as much as possible with front squats. See if you can keep the torso upright as well with your usual back squat
I’m deciding between single prong and lever and if I’m getting a single prong I’m gonna hit up pioneer. The lever doesn’t look aesthetic enough for me to get a custom one, just gonna settle with inzer. But the single prong pioneers though, they look nice. 
I did that last August. It confirmed my shit talking and suspicions, SBDs definitely does make the squat easier, and I sized for my calves vs knees. Planning to get a size down soon to see how that fits. 
Cut depth slightly if you’re serious about powerlifting. You also have a butt wink going on at full depth which will be a problem when you’re at near max weights. 
Unless it’s been around for a bit already you want them all the success! These gyms are rare as they usually end up closing due to lack of member subscriptions and business ends up going under. 
Do you usually squat in that stance with your hips that open? Phenomenal hip mobility btw (and I guess lucky hip socketing). 

Try playing around with stance and feet angle and how open you want your hips to find a spot that doesn’t trigger pain. Though it might just be hip flexors because visually it looks great. 
Why are people bitching about this fight? It's MMA, not boxing.

Coffee. Caffeine pills is a good second (also more economical $/mg basis)

That’s me. I tried it out and they’re solid but ridiculously heavy and expensive (and kind of dull looking. I don’t care what anyone says belt is a fashion item in the gym). I might as well get a belt made bespoke by a local crafter with that money (I don’t compete so equipment rules don’t matter to me). 
> Do as I say, not as I do.
If all you're going for is something to aid you through the training the carb choice probably doesn't matter as much (like 2% difference). I won't doubt that cyclic dextrin does have the edge related to MPS.

As per electrolyte, if I can't get my hands on the raw ingredient I'll probably get gatorade powder and use that as my carb as well. So EAA + Gatorade stack.
I used to do a BCAA + dextrose stack back when I was senselessly slaying volume. It got me through it easier for sure than without it but not enough of an improvement to say it’s absolutely needed. I’m also prudent when it comes to supplements so I just stopped. I think it’s more of an interest for top level bodybuilders that want to maximize MPS in all parts of their life. 

Having said that if I was going to give it a go again, I’d probably run EAA + branched cyclic dextrin (carb)+ electrolyte. My only issue is that cyclic dextrin is ridiculously expensive compared to other carb sources. 
first full clean in many many months. let me know how bad it looks:

WOWOWOW
dumb af trade proposal.
been doing this the last few weeks via SSPT deadlift method. Even though the weights are light the short rest time really adds up (been doing 30-45s rest depending on weight, and slowly pushing it as intensity goes up).
imbalances happen but it should ideally be non existent and your muscles should be firing symmetrically. If it isn't seriously hurting you it shouldn't cause too much panic but you should slowly address it before it leads to something worse. 
weightlifting movements are a complete other beast though. Even in non high level very rarely do coaches program doing split jerks with other foot. From 5 years of weightlifting the only imbalance from split jerking i noticed was one knee was more sore than the other.
Hovering around 193lbs these days even though I've been eating a lot of crap these days. Feels good mate. I just want to lean down so i don't have these weird pseudo-belly on me right above the waist.
just support the weight via finger tips if you lack the mobility to get a full grip. Just remember to fully drive the elbows up at all times.

The bar should be resting in a crevice between the delts and collar bones (you'll notice it more if you have more delt mass...).

If all else fails, grab a of straps, loop it around the bar, grab onto the straps as your handles. Here's an example by Mike T: https://www.instagram.com/p/Beqt1dKg2np/?hl=en&taken-by=miketuchscherer

wrap a resistance band around 
When practicing I was pretty shit with powers but had full confidence in full snatch/cleans. I haven't went heavy enough to full clean/snatch in a while so I'm really skeptical about how well my third pull + catch is these days... maybe I'll try tomorrow.
for single prong you should be good with small. For lever it's a little awkward but going by their recommended sizing you fall under a medium (the complete sizing wise you fall under both S and M)
straps
I should probably stop wearing my weightlifting related shits too....
I think power cleans are the most natural to me than any other compound lift. Technique isn't as crisp as I want it but I can move some ok weights. My full cleans are absolute crap now though lol.
Lever. Also tried on a small Prong same day, I could fit the last 2 holes (the tighter one I had to really work for it though).
Assuming you're talking about inexperienced trainees, main reason why I think people push strength programs to beginners is because they're simpler (read: easier) than hypertrophy/bodybuilding programs, and it's not like you're NOT building muscle via strength programs. 
I left my old gym as the resident weightlifting form check guy, and I've been shoehorned as the resident weightlifting form check guy at new gym as majority of the guys there are beginners. and I stopped weightlifting a year ago. Why won't this sport leave me alone?

[Here's a shitty 110kg power clean and jerk after benching heavy triples (3RM tie of 260 with the old school metal plates so it's more legit than the last time I hit it with those commercial gym plates, obvi). Glad I can at least manage this much via power.](https://www.instagram.com/p/Be4DHGzBLhF/?taken-by=mynameisdmoon)
is that cinched or completely relaxed? I measure around 34" relaxed, 32-33" with gentle cinch and i fit into my friend's medium fine with room to spare (like 3 holes till largest setting). you should be fine with a medium with room for weight gain (though you might find it loose if you lose weight)
You and I both. 
Yeah I might’ve oversimplified but you’re on point. 
some swear by 13mm but they seem to be the really competitive types that need to squeeze out ounces of gains out of everything. Others prefer the 10mm claiming the discomfort of 13mm is not worth whatever gains it provides over the thinner variant.
In copy paste-able format (It's viewable on his profile but wouldn't link to the comment..... shit's fucked up):

Here you go

CHICKEN BITES: - 1 ½ pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs cut into 1 ½ inch cubes

1 ½ cups buttermilk

2 cloves garlic, grated

3 tablespoons flour

½ teaspoon smoked paprika

½ teaspoon salt + ¼ teaspoon pepper

4 cups of crushed potato chips or corn flakes (50-50 is the best)

HONEY SRIRACHA SAUCE: - ¼ cup ketchup

¼ cup sriracha

1 tablespoons rice vinegar

⅓ cup honey

¼ teaspoons garlic powder

DIRECTIONS:

CHICKEN BITES: - Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 400ºF.

Place a piece of parchment paper on two baking sheets, set aside.

Place the chicken in a medium bowl, add the buttermilk, grated garlic, and a large pinch of salt. Stir to combine.

Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 30 minutes and ideally for 1 hour,

Drain well. Place the chicken back in the same bowl.

In a small bowl, combine the flour, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper.

Add the seasoning mixture to the chicken and stir to combine until all the chicken pieces are evenly coated; let sit 5 minutes.

Place the crushed chips or corn flakes in a shallow dish.

Working in batches, dredge chicken bites in mixture and press to coat.

Place chicken on prepared baking sheets.

Do not over crowd as the bites won’t crisp up as well.

Spray the chicken nuggets with nonstick cooking spray.

Bake for 18-24 minutes or until the chicken is firm to the touch and cooked through.

HONEY SRIRACHA SAUCE: - Heat the ingredients for the sauce in a small saucepan for 6-8 minutes.

Remove from heat, let cool.

If the sauce is spicy, consider adding another tablespoon of ketchup and/or honey to adjust to personal preference.

Coat the crispy chicken pieces with the honey sriracha sauce in a large bowl and toss. Alternately, you can serve the sauce on the side!

EDIT: since y’all are reading this, when OP says “Drain well. Place the chicken back in the same bowl.” he/she means basically drain the bowl of buttermilk and reuse the bowl right? Not squeeze the shit out of the chicken to drain?

Looking back on it now after some hours to digest on it, I can see both ends on it. I mean I'm sure whoever is producing MAGA hats/shirts were thinking the same thing. It just was so polarizing because it is Trump and the division it caused not only in America but between people as whole (well it was always there but Trump made it okay to hold and express those values).
you could always just size up by half on the adipowers if anything for a slight room in the toes as compromise. I don't think the fit needs to be glove like for powerlifting vs weightlifting.
yeah it's a bit conflicting. their products are of high quality, and looks amazing at that (the dyed leather ones especially). 

I know it can be a bit hypocritical sounding not supporting one bad while supporting some other big conglomerate that also has some bad sides, doesn't hurt to start somewhere.
28 this year too. I'm confident I'll hit 300 this year.
these look good.
this should answer everything: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBRG4RkE51Q
Most people here are concerned about making best use of their time to add to their numbers which is a perfectly fine thing hence why I threw that in there. I admire your goal & pursuit, nothing wrong with personal improvements no matter where.

I implemented those box squats as a mean to still be squatting while I was rehabbing my knees (quad tendonitis). It helped a bit getting through the parallel position in the ascent (Never had issue getting out of the hole but at and a bit above parallel was my sticking point previously). It also did its job on maintaining my strength for the most part.
romaleos 2. 3s aren't worth the regular price tag. Only buy 3s on sale (Eastbay seems to be having a sale on the 3s right now...)
it's usually because of weak quads.

But if we're covering bases, it could also be glute weakness/activation, lower back weakness, not driving your upperback against the bar into the ascent.
> His advice is to sit back with the shins beyond perpendicular which makes it feel like I literally can't stand up - is this type of training only useful for equipped lifters?

There are some that squat like that raw but not common. This is predominant in multiply.

> Also as far as stances, I'm just out to try new things by doing the conjugate method. I've never really done sumo pulls or wide-stance squats with any regularity or discipline (read: never) so I want to branch out into areas in weak/inexperienced in.

That's fair. Wide stance do have their merits. Just need to particularly be weary, especially if you're spending a lot of time with it, that what you're doing is resourceful/helpful in some shape or form (basically that you're not wasting time).
[Took 405 for a triple for 3's week.](https://www.instagram.com/p/Be1VhfMBCFn/)

Was heavier than I'd like. I reckon I had 2-5 more lbs but I wanted a nice number. Wondering if I should be safe and go for 410 or pray that I get stronger in three weeks for the next 3's week and do 415 (which I think would be an all time PR 3RM).

Bench 3s tonight. Gonna go for 3RM tie of 260lbs. Never thought I'd see the day when bench becomes my most confident lift despite being the weakest.

Also now that recent instagram drama with Pioneer, looks like I'm either getting an Inzer or ...SBD belt.
are you planning to lift equipped (Multiply)? then do what Louie says

If else: Don't rock your body like so. you're making use of a lot of momentum to initiate the ascent. Squat down (like you'd usually would) to the box (should be right around parallel), once you reach it (don't use the box to stop yourself - sit back & down into it like a squat. part of this is probably because your stance is too wide), squat back up. Slight movement to adjust balance is fine but don't rock back and forth because you're losing all the tension in the muscles this way (do pin squats if that's the intention).

Stance wise, there is merit to different stances but I can't comment on that. Only time I had carry over from box to full squat was it mimicking my usual squat stance but going too wide can be a waste of a time with no carry over. 
thank you sir!
normally in conventional deadlifts you don't want the heel because you want to make use of your posterior chain a lot more than the quads.

In a clean deadlift, it's the complete opposite. You want to lift the bar using your quads with the back hinge at the end portion to lock out. Back in my weightlifting days I had to do these after squats and it was the worst.
my arms are too short + butt too big to perform these. 

If you have weightlifting shoes, you can opt for a clean deadlift. If you're doing them properly you should feel it almost exclusively in the quads. 
yikes. I'm glad I found this. I was just about to place an order with them. No matter how nice their belts are, I can't support that mantra.

Thanks for bringing it into light!
[Took 405 for a triple for 3's week.](https://www.instagram.com/p/Be1VhfMBCFn/)

Was heavier than I'd like. I reckon I had 2-5 more lbs but I wanted a nice number. Wondering if I should be safe and go for 410 or pray that I get stronger in three weeks for the next 3's week and do 415 (which I think would be an all time PR 3RM).

Bench 3s tonight. Gonna go for 3RM tie of 260lbs. Never thought I'd see the day when bench becomes my most confident lift despite being the weakest.

RPE 8 is the hardest to gauge
not consistently but I think they did once against the warriors two seasons ago (and they won).
ELI5 pls
Yup, those are in my rotation. I love the dark sound that perturbator brings. 
that big of a diff? yikes I haven't low bar'd in forever, I wonder what I can squeeze out.
I'm hoping to ride 405 for a set of 5 soon. 400x5 is my all time 5RM (405x4 is incidentally my all time 4RM) but I was heavier by like 15-20lbs. Taking it out for a triple today to see how it feels.
probably to cue you to drive your upper back into the bar.
he got first overall!
this depends on the individual's leverage (torso + limb lengths, hip socket, ankle + hip mobility). That amount of hinge isn't too serious. It's likely due to weak quads (though because it's happening on latter reps it might be fatigue or lack of tightness/activation).

there's freakishly strong folks like [Clarence Kennedy](https://www.instagram.com/p/BdiTRo1BhQQ/?hl=en&taken-by=clarencekennedy_) where his absolute bottom position isn't where his body can apply max force so his hips shoot out a bit in the ascent though is by no means a good morning squat.


that LSUS template tho
if you can consciously limit your intake (and limit the surplus to desired amount) yeah for sure but at a buffet? I HAVE TO eat till I hate myself and/or I run their profits down.
> what are your favorite 'fun' exercises?

snatch, clean & jerk (or power clean + push press)
If you're familiar with RPE, I'd just work up to a heavy set of X reps at RPE 9, then do back off sets of same reps at 5-10% lighter weights until you hit RPE 9 (or cap yourself to a total number of reps via something like Prilepin's). Do make sure your rest times are well disciplined (3 minutes tops) or else your RPE will be undershot due to extended rest and you'll find yourself lifting away for a long time lol.
In my quest to find music of similar aggression and sound to Carpenter Brut, Danger, and the like, I found Dance with the Dead through Spotify and I'm really loving their debut(?) project Out of Body.

Also grabbed the Furi OST and that album is full of music I was looking for.
especially when you poop so you can really feel the core pushing against the belt like when you lift

+1. Everyone should learn this in some form.

It's less than ideal but this is how you learn to power clean if you can't drop the weight. I had do learn it like this when I started doing power cleans with no bumpers, went up to around 85kg x 3 before having access to a proper gym with platform and bumpers/
> 2 scoops of protein powder, **blended up**

good call. I made the mistaking of trying to spoon mix whey and coffee at working thinking I'm a genius for making mocha coffee but then the whey curded up my on me hard so I had to throw it out.
I think it's more so because my "tighter" hole via tapered belt is tighter than what most people would recommend/use with 4" belts. None of my friends have a 10mm prong belt that I fit in so I can't even give it a try lol.

Did try on a 13mm inzer belt and there is no way I'm buying that crap (impossible to get out of). Probably because of the layer of Robus (spelling?) leather they use that makes it hard to break in.
can't believe you just did that
that's my same sentiment. That and the fact that it's a bit of a pain in the ass to adjust sizing are my complaints regarding the lever but not sure if they're big enough to opt for single prong over these..
3RM week today. Aiming for 405x3 squat tonight which I think should be fairly doable. It is my previous 4RM from a year ago so let's see if I can do it for a triple at a lot lighter BW.

I want to put in my order at Pioneer for a belt by this week. Still hung over single prong vs lever though I'm leaning towards prong. I've only used velcro and tapered (proper leather though, ~9mm from Eleiko) belts from my weightlifting past. I'm able to tighten my eleiko one to 31" belt notch but I'm sure I can't get the full 4" wide belts that tight, especially if it's prong. I tried out my friends' lever belts and I hate that it always always pinches my belly lol.

Currently thinking of getting their custom dyed single prong. I learned that I can get full 10mm leather without any suede so that's more support than the typical 10mm belt but won't destroy me like a 13mm.

the fuck kind of coffee are you drinking?
I either stick to extremely low volume + moderately high intensity, or moderately high volume + very low intensity.

So either something like working up to 65-70% for 10, or working up to 80-85% for 1-3 reps, and doing some back off sets. I use it to essentially to get my body moving and into its grooves.

I don't think too much on the accessory work as (aside from maybe heavy leg presses) they don't really impede too much on my recovery so I just do them as normally. Maybe drop a set at most.
The ones that guys like westside barbell and rogue sell with the fixed long wedge of semicirclular prism padding to jam your knee into. I saw many gyms with padding that isn’t fixed and was spinning to accommodate your body’s movement and those were SO much easier to do GHR on that I was wondering why articles were making GHRs seem so hard. 
RDL+GHR is what finally got my hamstrings popping for me. GHRs (the proper ones) are stupidly hard though. Leg curls (lying variant is my fav) are a good substitute however. 
Shoulder sure looks fine with those dunks and reverse lay ups.
I just said peace out.
Yes. Never really had an lower back rounding issue for deadlifts. I'm still using my tapered belt from my weightlifting days too lol.
I personally love face pulls. I get amazing rear delt pumps from it and fixed my shoulders being pulled over from the SS days.
What is with you folks prematurely wasting legendary off season material now?? This better be in the best of. 
Me today. Waiting for the surgeon for my sister’s surgery for hours and hours and hours. 
Thank you!!
It must’ve been. The hospital texted me when it was over and it ended in half the minimum time they told me. I got worried because I thought they had to stop mid way! Seems like nothing alarming right now. 
Thank you!!
That’s my sister right now as she waits for her operation in 2 hours. Hang in there!
Skipping today’s session today as my sister is going in for surgery to get a cyst in one of her ovarian region removed. Chilling in the waiting area right now. Gonna be a loooong day. 
BUY FULTZ STOCKS NOW
I'm a headphone enthusiast and I settled for AirPods because I wanted a truly wireless solution and there weren't any better. 

Yeah they sound like ass compared to my other gear that costs 2-3x more, and yeah you can get a wired solution that sounds A LOT better for like half the price but they're the only product from my experience that fixed the charging issues that come with bluetooth and if I'm buying bluetooth, I'm thinking convenience and usability first and foremost. Other products of similar price range (no wire bluetooth earbuds) have subpar battery life or are really bulky to carry around.

The sound isn't THAT terrible but they leave a lot to be desired especially if you've been exposed to better gear but if all you're listening to are mainstream music you'll be fine (they're more likely than not to be mixed and mastered with earpods some time in the production time line).

They fit fine and won't fall out easily unless you make contact (like wiping sweat off your face or when they come in contact with your winter jacket collar). I can do weightlifting with them fine even with the sudden explosive head movements.

Do note that if you are using files that are not AAC (ie: non iTunes/Apple Music media) it gets re-encoded so you lose out on some quality (though I couldn';t tell which was because of the encoding and which was because of the hardware).
Contacted the dudes at Pioneer and turns out I am now a small in a belt. From a fat kid to wearing a small, what a way to start 2018. (Measured at 193lbs today. Height around 5' 9")
weighed in at 193 (~24lbs since June, slow and steady). Squat is eh, deadlift is eh, Bench is improving, and i'm looking jacked despite still having a bit of belly.

good start to the year.
> Pioneer posted up a YouTube video taking apart theirs and competitors belts recently worth looking up.

That's what got me to choose between those two. Ideally I'd like an SBD belt (used it a few times, they're pretty good) but I think I have better things to buy at that price range.

I'm a smaller guy at 194lbs still hovering at around 440lbs squat. I'm leaning towards the 10mm Pioneer since it doesn't seem like the extra 3mm is a deal breaker for performance as people are still doing strong things with 10mm (I'm guessing geared guys will appreciate the 13mm more).
Anyone own a best belt or a pioneer belt (I don't care for IPF approved)? Thinking of grabbing a single prong from them.

I know for inzer the common advice is to go 10mm as their belts are stiff as fuck and don't break in too easily (they have one stiff layer of leather amongst the other veg tan which causes this) but I couldn't find any opinions regarding thickness with Best Belt or Pioneer.

Their belts come pre-broken in and don't have that stiff variant leather in the layering so won't be as painful. Is the 10mm still the way to go? or is the 13mm worth getting with their leather?

Anyone have a solution for the shin/foot of the elevated one cramping up/pain when doing these? I consistently have issues with this and I have to opt for lunges or step ups instead for my unilateral work..
If you'd rather pay and get it a better form factor this does exist and was talked about often in SBAF regarding the andros and OI: https://ifi-audio.com/portfolio-view/accessory-iematch/

$49 on Amazon US. 2 settings of <2.5 ohms or <1 ohms, can support both single and balanced outputs.
iirc from previous thread on heavy carries, the general notion was heavy as reasonably possible across a set distance. Speed of the carry should be fast as possible as well (you'll be fast walking).

Lighter weights would aid in endurance more so than the peak strength of grip/core.
man fuck the LCD-2C, I'm just gonna buy these babies. With conversion and duty from Audeze shipping they aren't too far apart in price.

Been reading a lot into the ideal OI for these and a lot people seem to prefer around 3-6 which should be what my iPhone should be at. Have you tried changing OIs (and I guess the tips) around to find what sounds best to you?
Squatted up to a heavy set of 5 yesterday and hit 385lbs @ 9.5ish. Probably could've done 390lbs. Effectively 10lbs down from my all time 5RM. I'm gonna blame it on the near 20lbs of weight loss + not squatting for 6-7 weeks because of quad tendonitis. 

My bench improved despite losing weight though so that's pretty rad.
I'm probably going to squat before I even pull 500. My body doesn't seem to be made to pull at all lol.
new FotM. Greg Nuckols is the reddit sweetheart so anything by him is going to be in the good books here, and 5/3/1 (the previous FotM [or rather FotY]) is getting tiring so people want something new.

The key to effective programming is how people program what they do after the main lifts. Greg does give a guideline on how to program for it but more often than not people miss the mark on a good balance + progression of volume & intensity.

Personally prefer his free programs over A2S but the best program for an individual is whatever gets people excited and into the gym (and making progress) and it's doing the job.
caloric surplus.
I don't compete (do mostly meet day handling/coaching) but I guess my IPF buddies can't train around me anymore..
If you have a kettlebell doing complexes or doing a lift for reps/time is a great conditioning work.
yeah it's a great gym (in Canada ;) ). It's smaller than the older east location but it's having a great start so far. Nice seeing freaks in the gym every now and then to keep you humble. 
Haha yeah hopefully. I don’t do heavy 5s for another 3 weeks (and final one in 6 weeks) so let’s see how things improve. 
I deadlifted on this platform today in bare socks. Hopefully I absorbed some of his sweat into me for some free gains. 
Lol that 6-7 weeks of rehab to baby my quad tendonitis really got me squats weak. Combine that with losing weight over the months. Worked up to a heavy set of 5 today and hit 385lbs at around 9.5. Probably could’ve hit 390x5 at 10. 

That’s effectively 10lbs off my all time 5RM. 

MEANWHILE. My bench has improved despite losing nearly 20lbs. 

We livin in bizzaro world now, my dudes. 

Also looks like robo mod fucked up on date. 
Tylenol + Codeine \#3. Might be a regional thing but in Canada they hand these out like candy after every wisdom tooth extraction. That and ibuprofen.
Off. I have em on pretty tight if I'm using them to actually assist me.

Recovery from wisdom tooth surgery differs on how badly it's impacted in your gums. I was pretty lucky and was good to go in a week, didn't even need T3 (not that it'd even be effective in my damn asian body). eat a lot of carbs and proteins and fats and everything and you'll be fine.
pray that it doesn't close. I've seen far too many of these gyms come and go.
just make sure to let/ask the staff know in advance. They might not realize it's not theirs and be wondering why you're stealing their bar.
How many "how many sets do you have left" did you get while doing this
Hell has frozen over. Pigs are flying. Trump is impeached. 

wow.
I don't know him too well either. Seen him around for a while but never really talked to him until the opening of Fortis West, though we do recognize each other.

He seems like a super chill & quiet guy and rather humble. I still try to stay out of his way though for the most part lol. His wife is a lot more approachable. 
> There's no reverse hyper at my gym either, unfortunately. Am I wrong in thinking a light good morning would be an okay replacement?

If you have a horizontal back extension apparatus (parallel to floor) mount yourself the opposite direction (facing the leg pad) with belly on the main padding, and perform that way. You'll be limited on the weight you'll be able to use but it's the closest compromise.
I only help out when it's a weightlifting movement. I know for a fact that coaching is not affordable for everyone so anyone training outside of a club is learning by themselves and having someone give pointers/form checks is a godsend. 
yes it is. Still some work to be done in the gym but so far it's looking good. 
[Dan Green decided to drop by the gym I started training at as it recently opened and he's buttbuddies with the owner. Casual 835lbs for a double to give the deadlift bar and platform some break in.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BedM07Sl2Bi/?taken-by=fortiswest)
(Can't see video due to google drive being blocked at work)

Two things I can think of are from given description:   

* [tight hip flexors] (https://squatuniversity.com/2017/10/07/fixing-hip-flexor-pain/)

* hip impingement (See [1](https://squatuniversity.com/2017/10/21/fixing-hip-impingement/) and [2](http://www.jtsstrength.com/articles/2015/05/08/the-hip-impingement-solution/))

See if those apply to you. I'm gonna guess it's the former since it isn't as consistent.
Anyone that ran the SSPT deadlift sample cycles, how hard were they later on? Did it impede recovery a bit with respect to squats? I think I can handle the 1 day/week but not sure if that's enough work so considering the 2 day/week.

Currently running a U/L split with WUP. Mondays I squat up to some RM (rotates around 10/5/3) + back off sets. Thursdays I squat 90% of that RM for 3-5 sets of the rep of the week. 

I want to toss in the SSPT deadlift work after the squats. My original thought was to do the 1 day/week on Thursday but tempted to toss in 2 day/week. Below 90% I think it's fairly doable without too much repercussion on recovery/performance on squats...
Changed my work schedule around so I can go to my new gym often (Fortis West) as it's a pain in the ass to get to when I work from home due to traffic (mandated twice a week). I gave up a near 4 day weekend for this gym (Used to work Mon Fri at home, now Wed and Fri). 

I think this change of environment was a good move. I haven't felt so excited to go to gym in a while.

[Forgot to mention, Dan Green was in on Friday to break in the deadlift bar + platform with a casual 835lbs double.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BedM07Sl2Bi/?taken-by=fortiswest)
Copped. I think I like these more than the blacks (I like white shoes more). It’ll be a nice pair to my 2016 white cement 4s
The ones I've attended, the press (barrels, axles, circus dumbbells) usually just meant get it over your head. Some jerked, some push pressed.
that's like the generic general purpose model. Versatile & Good for everything, doesn't particularly excel at anything. If you want extra length/width you can go for the other two models of that same style but unless you handle axles or other thick handle strongman equipment it's probably not needed.
+1 for Ironmind. My Ironmind weightlifting straps are still going strong after 5-6 years of abuse.

Spud might be a good alternative if you want a more heavy duty feeling one. They also have the strong man figure 8 straps.
How much does the red light add?
I don't think he'd enjoy that too much. Heck his wife runs their instagram account (both the gym and personal) for the most part lol.
yeah got lucky that it's located on my way to home... sort of. Left my old gym that I've been training for over 7 years at for this new place. Aside from being lonely because no friends, it's pretty great.
don't exactly remember since when but he's been dealing with a back injury (~ late 2016 iirc) that has him just taking things easy. And of course with the Fortis West ordeal he's probably been too busy/stressed to train seriously.

Not sure if he's better now but he was doing upper body work yesterday with some axle bar bench and stuff. And was doing some light deadlifts the other day.


Jeremy is like complete opposite of Sean when it comes to personality, I love it. Sean is like super intense and would yell at you to hype you up for everything. Jeremy is just mellow and chill and gives you that nod of acknowledgement. 

But I'll be sure to let him know!
it's only been open a week, been there to help jeremy out and promote the place. He lives in the east end so he'd be trekking across the city to be here whereas Fortis East is pretty close to him.
ye we're buttbuddies. he's more often in the east location though.
[Squatted 300lbs for 4x10 at the gym last night @ Fortis West.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeZC8YqBT8b)

Shit was tight. Looking forward to more sessions there.

Also incorporated SSPT Deadlift table into the program. Weight is light but that 30 second rest really sneaks up on you, wow.
I think that’s already happening though

https://instagram.com/p/BeZMMfvA93Y/
didn't want the raptors fans getting too comfortable. remember, no lead is safe.
Example RPE chart that PTW uses. It should TECHNICALLY be generated by yourself for a more custom tailored one for yourself but it's okay for starting out.
that's what I always do whenever I'm on the hunt. I always go for something that lands on a 7-8 (on a scale of 1-10, 1 being SS with empty bar, 10 being Smolov Full/Sr).
Greater dorsiflexion + better hip mobility/stance change
If you don’t care for optimality it’s a good approach. I mean it works, and I don’t have to think about it. It’s essentially chasing the pump. I’m still doing that approach with my other programs because it’s so simple
The added heels will help bring your knees out further, bringing the hips closer to the knees. so yeah it'll help.

For a quick teaser, try squatting with the 10lb plates under your heels. It'll essentially feel like that but A LOT more stable.

FWIW, I can't high bar efficiently (and wouldn't bother with it) without weightlifting shoes on. I also have long af femurs with shorter tibia + short torso. Ankle mobility is OK.
You can try VDIP structure for T1 if you don't mind a higher intensity on your T1 to start the session. Basically start at around 80% TM, do 3 max rep sets (Stay around RPE 8.5-9), increase the weights accordingly for next time. 

The full routine has you using MRS (max rep sets) on everything but I do not recommend doing it for T2. T3 is 4MRS and it really simplified doing hypertrophy work for me. Basically chasing the pump.

Aside from that there's PHUL but it's not really well documented. 
2XU ones fit me nice and have lasted me at least a year so far.
GZCL J&T 2.0 is more powerbuilding (someone is going to comment regarding my use of this word...) than pure hypertrophy but it does the job. It's an U/L split with a lot of volume.
yes though it really depends on your mobility + limb lengths/leverages and how you squat.
I personally didn't like the stiff wraps (same with the infamous Titan ones). I like having a little give to them. I also bench the same amount though haven't tested in a bit.

Absolutely loved the flexible ones though. Just couldn't justify paying nearly double vs Inzer ones lol
i was just going through a profile like this last night... except she's like 5'8" and 166lbs. multiple posts like it. pretty pics tho
@quadslikerobb
then you're going start looking into upgrading your gear. getting shoes for deadlifting. or maybe you want to change sports from powerlifting to weightlifting so you have to buy a tapered/velcro belt for that..... or maybe equipped lifting so you need to buy wraps, suits, shirts....
I mean it all depends on the leverage of the individual but a compromise a lot of trainees tend to make when they first squatting (especially with low bar and sitting back cue taken to extremes) is to sit back more than down. In order for you to sit down the dorsiflexion needs to happen to push the knees out for the butt to sit down but for people with lack of dorsiflexion this won’t happen so they sit back more once the knees can’t travel forward anymore and thus fold over more.

Squatting in that manner isn’t bad per se though it’ll put a lot of stress on the lower back. See Layne Norton for an example (he claims he has no dorsiflexion despite working on it...). 
Except I’m pretty sure Fultz is not eligible for ROTY next year since he already played a regular season game
Yup basically. Original program calls for making those jumps and doing the reps for the week at that weight but AMRAP sets really drain me so I opted against it after that first jump. 

How far you can climb really depends on how you’re feeling and how hard you’re willing to push yourself. So that much is auto regulated. If you’re feeling shitty back off early (like just make that 5% jump from your top set, hit the prescribed sets, call it quits, do FSL). If you’re feeling good push it hard. 

Some people find it defeating the point using joker sets every week and I acknowledge that too as once your TM climbs it’s really really hard and you’ll end up fried. When you reach that point you want to reserve joker sets for when you’re feeling good or only on certain weeks. 

You can also do pauses variant for FSL if you’re weak out of the whole. 

FWIW, I did this for all but the deadlift and they responded well for 6-9 cycles until my TM climbed up hard. 
I do the first increment set (say it was 3+ day, so this set would be at 95%) at the same rep as the 5/3/1 day (so on 3+ after the 90%x3+ I would do 95%x3). After this I’d usually be too tired (depends on how deep in the cycles I am) to do more so I start climbing up in singles. I usually make 2-3 jumps in 5% increments after that rep set in singles. 

So on a 3+ day it’d look something like this: 70%x3, 80%x3, 90%x3+, 95%x3, 100%x 1, 105%x1. 

This allows me to expose my body to heavier weights while fatigued and I’ll already know that I can hit next week’s minimum numbers without a challenge. Good confidence builder. 

You can theoretically make bigger jumps and/or do more sets but that’s what I usually ended up doing as I’d call it once I reached RPE9-9.5. 

For the first couple of cycles you could do this every week but you’ll eventually feel burned out (even with deloading every 2 cycles). At that point you can look into 5/3/1 SVR which cycles intensity and volume better so you don’t burn yourself out. 

Disclaimer: I haven’t read Forever 5/3/1 so my answer is based on personal experience using his work up to Beyond 5/3/1. I think Wendler changed his stance on a bunch of things but doesn’t mean the older stuff doesn’t work anymore. 
Joker sets + FSL 5x5 worked well for me to catch up to my old max after SI injury. BBB 5x5 at higher intensity is a good option too if you want heavier weights. 
First day at the new gym tomorrow (Fortis West), owned and ran by Jeremy Hamilton. Been a member at the original Fortis for years so I’m happy to have this gym be much closer to work, and be my new gym home. At the least my back and spine will be happy with squatting with rogue Ohio power bars instead of whippy bars!
After years of spending hours away in the gym trying to get jacked and I’ve come to the realization that hypertrophy is part art part science. With respect to the quoted portion: What Mike is explaining is the optimal solution based on science. What Ben is saying is a solution that works supported by numerous experiences. It may not be optimal but it works. It is also entirely possible for these two approaches to be not mutually exclusive.

The problem with chasing optimality is that more often than not the trainee ends up either overcomplicating  things and end up missing the mark completely. While if you were to go by the possibly non optimal but backed my anecdote method, you’ll get jacked and it’ll work. It might not be optimal but it was effective and you got more jacked than the previous example trainee. 

I’m pretty sure Ben acknowledges Mike’a findings but what he’s tried and succeeded worked best for him so he could only preach what he’s tried and works (and also simple enough for people to learn vs keeping track of all the volume a specific muscle was worked via all the compounds and isolations). 
The knee pain might be because of inadequate dorsiflexion (ankle mobility) so wearing weightlifting shoes have placed your knees into position it’s never been before and it’s handling more stress. See if you can push your knees to similar position without heels on while keeping your ankle glued to the ground (I’m also under the impression knees are just over the toes with flats, and beyond the toes with heels). 

If your knees can’t travel forward enough to distribute the load elsewhere, it’ll hurt and only way to fix that is to improve ankle mobility. When your shins are more upright (which usually means your torso is a lot more forward) the load is distributed to the hips and back as well as the knees which is why you haven’t felt it before. 

I’m not the best at writing so I may have worded things wrong/confusingly but everything you’re telling me screams ankle mobility issue to me. 
No I mainly asked because he mentioned knee pain. Some people (common with Starting Strength devotees) without adequate ankle dorsiflexion tend to squat with shins vertical because they can’t push the knees out forward and suddenly with weightlifting shoes they can introducing new range and thus foreign pain to the knees. 
Ah right. I’ve been basing my understanding of a cyst off of the one I had which probably isn’t the smartest connection to make. Didn’t realize those things can burst. Yikes. 
SSB does a good job in reinforcing your torso to stay rigid and upright, with your chest not caving.

Can't say I've felt that ab sensation with front squats but I came from a weightlifting background so I guess I was already used to it. 
Last tested was like 275lbs but I was also 5-7lbs heavier when I did that. I consider myself a bit of a volume warrior so the conventional translation from xRM to 1RM doesn't work too well for me.

I think my bench definitely improved though... somehow... despite cutting weight.
That was the earliest date she was offered. She hasn't mentioned any pain or discomfort of sorts which is probably what gave her the idea of delaying it.
I have Adipowers in 9, Romaleos 2 in 9.5, wore the Power Perfect 2 in 9, Asics in 9.5.

Both the Asics and Romaleos 2 ran a little long but great in width. Asics I think I could've sized down a half but I was trying on my friend's pair that had same Romaelos 2 size as me. 

The Romaleos 2 I tried in size 9 and it was really tight in mid/balls of the feet. I'm not sure how much wear in would've helped, it was kind of painful (my feet didn't fit in the competition insole). 

I tried the 3s in store with the non competitive insole on in size 9 and it fit okay but a little tight in toe box.

Adipowers in 9 fit a little tight in the toe box, especially in the right pair since my right feet was a tad bigger. After couple sessions of wear in I think they fit better than my Romaleos 2 (though the latter is def more comfortable to wear around). I also had to keep my toe nails trim at all times as the toe box was that narrow.
Yeah I figured that would set some red flags. Thanks. 
I mean I live and breathe Toronto and Montreal pales in comparison. 
I feel like Montreal lacks breadth in cuisine. Not a lot of variety of cultural cuisine there and for the ones that do exist (outside of Canadian/French joints) there aren't too many of them.
Adamsons BBQ for Texas BBQ (my buddy that goes to Austin and goes for Franklin occasionally says Adamsons is decent enough to save the money/time to go to Austin)

Pai Northern Thai Kitchen for thai food (my choice for \#1 restaurant in Toronto)

And we have some decent Pho restaurants around the city. Pho Tien Thanh is currently one of the most popular places to go for Pho.
I really wish it was. The initial report from ultrasound said 10-15cm but the OBGYN said from the biopsy (Blood test + MRI) said it could be around 25cm (which was told to me by my sister) which I don't understand how because my sister is tiny, like her body isn't even that wide in both axis (like I'm imagining those school rulers that are ~ 30cm, and that wouldn't fit along her body, like just barely if you laid it across her abdominal area unless it's protruding upwards then I guess that makes sense but that's still nuts).
Oh wow how did I forget that lol. bench!
well if it's triggered by a lift I'd be a bit wary about it. Avoid putting too much weight on the area. Drill in a lot of back extensions (I prefer bw x a lot of reps. up the weight slowly if it's pain free) to keep the blood flowing through the area. 
As long as it's not a sharp shooting pain I just lift through it. 

Been working through an SI issue that won't completely go away for a long time now. I went to therapy for it and learned to minimize it so it doesn't impact me at all but it still lingers there in that annoying way.
this is why you need to wear some sort of tights for sumo
10RM day yesterday and I hit 225x10 which is a PR I think so yay?

A little bit of column A, a little bit of column B. Really depends on the individual and squatting style. 

If it's killing your knees, do you normally squat without any dorsiflexion (ie: shin stays vertical)?
I knew I'd find this gif here.
You'll get more out of SBDs. It's to the point where I don't feel like I'm raw with SBDs on compared to my Rehbands. I didn't even size SBDs for competitive sizing. Sized up if anything to fit calves.
use sumo as assistance movement and work your way up LP style. And yes, opposing stance deadlift being programmed is a thing, though its efficacy/carry over varies.

I did just that the last month and a half and it's close enough to my conventional that I'm willing to switch over, even with still subpar technique. 
I thought this was a Bison from the thumbnails. I'd love to wrestle with this dog.
It happens for me on high rep work. I'm 5'9", 88-89kg, I wear a L because I don't compete and didn't want to be a try hard that sized competitively and spend 10 mins putting one on. I also sized up because of my calves and my left one still cramps after a high rep set.
2nd week of squatting, and first time squatting 10 reps since I stopped doing 5/3/1 back in oct. I forgot how much I hated this shit and I'm gonna be doing it every 3 weeks. fuck me. 

worked up to a heavy set of 10 and did some back off sets. My all time 10RM is 159-160kg but I was like 7-10lbs heavier back then. Took an advice and started at 75% (150kg) and slowly build up on it over the next few weeks. The weight didn't feel heavy but I wanted to die after. Felt light headed afterwards but did RDLs and DB Rows and got the fuck out of there.

Tonight is also the last session at my alma mater gym where I spent almost 7 years in. Financially and convenience wise it doesn't make much sense for me to leave until I get a car (I hate driving) but I needed a change of scenery. Something new and different in my life and a new gym is a start. Gonna be sad/great.
Rehbands. Also have SBDs but don't like them for weightlifting. Only for squatting.
nah that's weird. I bring them with me and just hand wash them with the leftover suds on my loofah.
depending on your level and maturity (and how many weeks out until next competition), I'm of the side that you should put bigger emphasis on strength (Squats, pulls, upper body) than the classic lifts. This of course assumes some level of proficiency in your technique and that your cleans are within some range with respect to the squat (every coach goes by different numbers but a common number being thrown around is that you should be able to clean and jerk your 3-5RM front squat. heck the chinese puts a priority on hitting ~200kg back squat before everything).

Take a look at the LSUS weightlifting program as an example. That is an extreme case meant for advanced athletes but I think it conveys the point.
Work up to a top set of RPE 8 (at most) once a week. I'm doing a 5/3/1 rep scheme to follow my periodization of other stuff (3 week cycles).
I shower with them once every two weeks and handwash(or once a month depending on how lazy I am). I used to do it after every use but I noticed that the stitching integrity started to degrade (this was with my first OG rehbands). I don't wash my subsequent sleeves as often. Worst case scenario I just leave them out to dry for the most part and wash them when they really start to stink or sweat stains start to show.
not for weight for some reason. Only weightlifters use kilos. Powerlifting guys really love their pounds, even when using kilo plates.
case keenum aint here to fuck around!

I once witnessed my white friend call his parents by their first names and I was flabbergasted. Like, did he find out he was adopted or something? Did something happen in the family that he is now calling them by his first name in person???? I asked my Korean friend who was with me at the time, later on, and he was equally mindfucked to have witnessed it but didn't want to bring it up. I brushed it off as crazy white people shit.

As I made more white friends later on in life I'd casually ask them about this and they straight up said that they'd get their existence wiped off from the face of the earth if they pulled this off. 
lol i hear ya. Graduated with a math and compsci degree and now I'm doing aerospace engineering work.
you must be a civil engineer
I haven’t squatted over 6 reps in a while so to acclimate myself back to free squatting I did 70% for 3x10 last night (140kg). My legs were instantly sore after and had to stop sumo technique work lol. Felt like my first day of squatting 1 plate for 3x5 on SS 

I’m also almost done with my belt. Managing to still lose weight to the point that I only have 1 notch to go. Feeling skinny!

Maybe it’s time to shell out the big bucks for a SBD belt
you need to build up for hookgrip. To alleviate some pain on the thumb you can use tape to wrap it up (it's legal, in IPF at least within the given length).

Keep calluses trimmed (various methods, pick one and make it work), and moisturize. 
If "progression rate" is that important to you, might want to look into Texas Method, PH3, or some DUP/WUP (which the mentioned two essentially are) style programs, or another LP program (but its entirely possible LP won't work as well for you anymore). 
they usually are. the forearm/grip fatigue sneaks up on you.
Yeah i guess if you caused a clamping mechanism like that it could aid the grip too. try the other direction, it's a matter of 0 vs 100% efficacy for me.
it should be under-over (ie: first loop go under the bar, wrapped to tighten/push it onto your palms). if you go over-under you're just wrapping along with your hands so you're not adding anything to it.
the fuck. that's a first..
did you wrap it over under instead of under over?
thats wild. the one next to my office is always so empty. 
stick to the program
While it's good that you have a strong drive, that is a very dangerously volatile mindset to have that will burn you hard later, not just in sports but in life in general. 
Honestly I haven’t been following the spurs too much this season but I have seen him beasting then tamed down a little when Kawhi came back. 
So the silver lining to kawhi being back in rehab is we get to see LMA do this every night now that he has free reign as the definitive \#1 option on the roster. 
it's a pretty standard program. Used a variant of it to build my way up to my first 200kg. 
I'd toss them in on upper body days before rear delt work, or superset them. You shouldn't be using heavy weights on them anyways for the most part. 
you're doing some sort of pressing almost every day. Barbell pressing (bench, bench variant, board press), or non BB pressing (incline DB, dips). Squats are twice a week. Deads are 2-3 a week. There are a lot of hyperextensions (BW, 3x10) however.
that's me and weight dips. bw dips seem fine though.
because you can sometimes build reliance on mirror to check setup and form unknowingly and can screw you over when you suddenly stop using one... like in a competition. YMMV.
Having a handler puts the lifter at ease as all they have to worry about is walking up to the platform and performing the lift. They keep track of the flow of the flight to make sure you're warming up on time and pace so you're fully prepared and rested for the attempt to come (and obviously to make sure you're not caught off guard by when you're supposed to go up, it can be kind of crazy sometimes especially if they have loud music going). They're also a source you can consult on making jumps when you're not 100% sure how much of a jump to take for the next attempt (they can advise you go make a bigger jump or to make a smaller jump than you'd think). There's also the bitch work the handler tends to handle (hydration, putting up weights on warm ups, powdering your legs, carbs/caffeine, etc) but that varies per person.

Without one you'd have to handle all those tasks mentioned above (and more that I probably missed that you're probably aware of) which may or may not add onto the stress and hinder your performance. The degree of which it'd matter may vary heavily.

While I'd always recommend having a handler, I'm not sure I'd advise paying for one especially unless it is some sort of a higher tier competition (eg: Nationals), especially if they aren't fond of how you lift and what you're capable of performance wise.

I've seen guys go solo in provincials and nationals and perform fine though they definitely do look more stressed/less relaxed.
Thoughts on this for squats and bench in a Upper/lower split?:

    W1,4,7  
        D1: 10RM, 1x10 @ 95% of 10RM, 1x10 @ 90% of 10RM  
        D2: 3-5x10 @ 90% of 10RM  
    W2,5,8  
        D1: 5RM, 1x5 @ 95% of 5RM, 1x5 @ 90% of 5RM  
        D2: 3-5x5 @ 90% of 5RM  
    W3,6,9  
        D1: 3RM, 1x3 @ 95% of 3RM, 1x3 @ 90% of 3RM  
        D2: 3-5x3 @ 90% of 3RM  
    Weeks 10-12 will be the peaking/testing

It's essentially the LSUS program without the 3rd testing day on the later blocks, with weekly undulated periodization incorporated to it because from experience I tend to respond well from it (and I'm not the biggest fan of block periodization).

Deadlifts will be kept to maintenance levels (probably work up to a set of 5/3/1 at RPE 8.5-9 on day 2 of lower body day). Obvious supplementary/hypertrophy work thrown in according to recovery/stress as well.


Been theorycrafting for weeks for a 4 day split upper/lower program that'd have me bench and squatting twice a week (main lift), and deadlift 1-2 a week (1xmain lift, 1x variant or so), that has some sort of structure to it with some variance in periodization throughout the week.

I'm considering giving LSUS program a try but instead of the usual block periodization, I'm considering doing a weekly periodization of it. So instead of 10s block, 5s block, 3s block (3 weeks each), I want to try running 10s week, 5s week, 3s week (repeat for 3 weeks), then peak + test. I've done a similar approach (10/8/6 + 9/7/5 + 8/6/4 + 7/5/3 + 6/4/2) before which worked out rather well. Basically:

    W1,4,7  
    	D1: 10RM, 1x10 @ 95% of 10RM, 1x10 @ 90% of 10RM  
    	D2: 3-5x10 @ 90% of 10RM  
    W2,5,8  
    	D1: 5RM, 1x5 @ 95% of 5RM, 1x5 @ 90% of 5RM  
    	D2: 3-5x5 @ 90% of 5RM  
    W3,6,9  
    	D1: 3RM, 1x3 @ 95% of 3RM, 1x3 @ 90% of 3RM  
    	D2: 3-5x3 @ 90% of 3RM  

Thoughts on the weekly undulating periodization approach vs block?

It's either that or I fall back onto texas method U/L split... but I'm kind of scared of burning out on it fast again as I'm never too sure when to start reducing volume/change intensity day.
so far no extra leg work outside of squats. 

Just need the mentioned equipment, as well as a bench that can incline (couple incline presses thrown in), something to do hyperextensions, and something to do board presses. 

They also have you hitting triceps in 3 positions throughout the week: standing, lying, and specifically pushdowns which I'm guessing is only there so you can overload it with heavier weight vs other positions.
Depends on your equipment but they threw in bench press with chains, deadlifts off block, banded deadlifts so probably not?

They only released two weeks of it so I can't answer the latter.
1. Lunges/Split Squats  
1. bench press (or standing/seated press if you don't have a bench)  
1. 2 arm db row  
1. RDL  

4x8-12 for each.

If you want to do a quick complex instead:

1. RDL x 10
1. DB Row x 10
1. DB Clean & Press (basically a jumping cheat curl + squat + press) x 10

Do for 4 rounds with 90-120 sec rest with heaviest weight you can use.
Bought the off season one and they only released weeks 1 and 2 so far. It... looks like a sheiko program but as a 5 day split and with a lot more accessory work thrown in.
lol the shit Americans argue about never fails to amuse me. 

The man also definitely weighs at least 265-270lbs. I know my chubby men.
I mean with the whole bountygate past and Sean Payton obnoxiously celebrating early you can only expect that kind of reaction from them. It's basically a form of retribution for them.
I personally did this and found better carry over to the bench however I did it for just that, not to mask a mobility issue. If you have mobility issue pressing overhead you should probably fix that first.
is it? it was pretty mind fucking to me how ridiculous it was as a whole. It got me into it lol
The prices for it should be pretty tame on AH

I don't have a pair of lightning variants to compare but I'd imagine they'd sound similar, maybe better for airpod because of better fit. These are pretty terrible sounding for the price point and you could find really cheap IEMs/earbuds that sound better. VE Monks is a prime example. 
Yes to Ottawa, no to Calgary. I’m not too big on Ottawa food scene. They do have the best shawarma in Canada though. 
Related story: In my software engineering project course, we were automatically assigned to our teams for the semester by the professor and all we got were just names. One of the names of members in my team was "Tyrone". I immediately thought he was a black guy and looked around the room (hint: there were barely any black people in my year) to my dismay, there were no black guys. 

At the end of the lecture we met up at the back of the room all wondering who this Tyrone guy is and this guy approaches us saying "Hi I'm Tyrone". I didn't know what race he was at first glance but he definitely wasn't black.

Later on I asked him about his name and race and turns out he's half Asian (forgot which specifically) + half Irish, and that the name Tyrone comes from an Irish background. 
It just felt like I was going through the motions for the sake of doing it. Couldn't even feel the muscles stretch and contract in the movement (for squats and deadlifts at least).

My last experiment with deficit calories (I guess still current) I opted for a higher intensity lower volume approach and it worked out very well for me. Whatever you choose to do, take your time with dieting (unless you have a competition but then you probably wouldn't be asking here if so). Slower it is, the more of your strength you'll maintain (or even improve).
if you're okay spending the money, you can get SBD belt and get the best of both worlds.... but then again you can just get an inzer lever and some prong belt for the same cost....
what variant of BBB are you running? The vanilla 5x10 @ 50% is extremely boring and I felt like it was pointless especially if you're on a deficit (assuming your body musculature is mature, you aren't going to be building muscle without calories).

I had success doing a heavier variant of BBB or FSL 5x5 while on deficit.
Thoughts after a week of using airpods daily for several hours per (Mostly in commute + gym):

* It's super convenient and I love how fast it charges for when I need it (like for a long gym session after a long commute)
* This shit gets dirty fast.
* The tap controls were impossible to get at first but after a while it kind of started working well
* The range is pretty good for my use cases
* Initially was surprised at how good they sounded (compared to earpods) then afterawhile I came back to reality and confirmed that it still does sound bad compared to my other gear but I knew that. It does have bass quantity in the form of midbass, the quality is really bad. It's slow and wet like a whoopie cushion. Imaging and details/separation are lacking as well. However they sound pretty fine for the most part and rather acceptable if all you listen to are mainstream pop/hiphop/r&b/edm music that I'm pretty sure are mixed/mastered using earpods as that's what majority of target listeners will be using. Once you get into anything more complex you really see the short comings.
* While the fit isn't super loose there is definitely room for improvements. Without contact they stay sit okay but if it touches the collar of my winter jacket in the wrong way I'm afraid of them falling out! I think I'll have to invest in the spigen ear hook add-ons at least for gym uses
*  it's pretty ideal for commuting & exercise. Though I'm a little wary with how it can withstand sweat and chalk from the gym though. I guess time will tell.


I initially thought AirPods were overpriced for full retail (even at time of purchase. I only bought them because I had $200 in gift cards). however I did more research into competitor products of same form factor and when you consider all that.... it's not that overpriced. 

The big ones that stood out were Sony, Bose, and B&O. While undoubtedly they will sound better (and offer noise cancelling for Sony and Bose at least), they come short in convenience features which was my main concern when shopping (shit if you want quality stick to wired. I'm looking to get the Campfire Audio Andromedas soon!). For a more premium price they were either (or both) too bulky to casually carry in pocket without bulk, or had subpar battery life for my use cases (~ total 8 hours of listening daily, assuming I forget to charge for a day or two). I'm sure however they do offer a lot better sound quality so if that's what people want over convenience features, they're readily available to get. Beauty of the consumer market!
how sway
you might have cheap/bad ones or placing it odd on your wrist. I'm using a single loop weightlifting style strap from Iron Mind and they've lasted me for years. One of the loops broke so it's literally a piece of cotton that I have to manually use as straps like the old school seatbelt straps. they keep my wrists fine and dandy then again I haven't used them for more than 220kg.
Seems like my box squatting stint paid off. Decided to free squat for the first time in a month and a half and aside from my technique degrading because I haven’t squatted below parallel in a while, weights felt rather light. Worked up to 90% at RPE 9-9.5 beltless mostly because I forgot how to bounce out of the hole so form went all sorts of shit. Should take me a week to get it back to normal. 

Also decided to go for a heavy triple on sumo because why not it’s basically near my conventional now after a month or two of screwing around with sumo wtf. This is with shitty technique too. I guess I’m ready to make the full transition now.

Danny Ainge looking like a mad genius bandit right now.
aw you made a new gym boy/girlfriend
That really depends on the individual but in general it is perfectly doable. I was repping 300lbs for sets of 5 in both deadlift and squat in 3 months of lifting (don't ask me about the bench...) all on a caloric deficit.
depends on variant. the vanilla 5x10 @ 50% is in my experience straight up boring and time waster (especially more so if you're on a caloric deficit). Much rather do FSL 5x5, or the heavier variants of BBB as per Beyond 531

I'm thinking of selling some of my gear (and sneakers) and make a big purchase. if you had a choice between the andromeda and LCD-2c (at the $799 USD price) which would you grab? I mention the 799 USD price because that's essentially what i'd be paying importing it into Canada even with the $599 USD price with currency exchange and duty considered (~$1000 CAD), while Andromeda I can buy locally for ~$1400 CAD.

I've heard the 2F and Andromeda at a meet up so I know what I'm getting into with respect to sound, just curious with respect to value per $ in peoples opinions.

I'm kind of leaning towards the LCD-2C as after buying an AirPod for commuting conveniences (Bought it at $19.99 CAD + tax because gift cards from various sources for xmas) I'm pretty okay listening to rather subpar but remotely acceptable quality music considering the insane conveniences I'm enjoying (especially in winter where we're all bundled up).
Weighed in on Tuesday morning at 195lbs too (pre-poop, was feeling a bit constipated so I reckon 194-194.5 post poop?). Benched 252x4 @ ~8.5-9 last night despite being sick. I think this is a PR, if anything a BW PR. First time in my life where I'm getting stronger in the bench while cutting hah.

From my travels in the states, with respect to food, the thing that stands out in Toronto are Thai food and Pho (Vietnamese noodles). There's better pizza, bbq, ramen, sushi elsewhere in the states and in Canada, but haven't really found thai/pho that really trumps over Toronto.

For thai, I highly suggest biting the bullet and waiting in line for Pai Northern Thai Kitchen. People are gonna roll their eyes at me for this but it is legit the best (outside of fine dining because I ain't about that life) restaurant in Toronto. 

For Pho it varies on who you ask but a good amount seems to agree that Pho Tien Thanh takes the title.

Toronto also does all you can eat sushi somewhat well for some reason. While it's not a stand out food quality wise, if you want to just eat your heart out... there's that.
I randomly walked into footlocker in summer 2016 to find them sitting in shelves from a low key restock. You can’t even imagine how fucking ecstatic I was when they had it in my size. 
midsole wise they're OKAY once broken in. Actual fit really varies per person. These run long and narrow imo, had to size up for my wide feet so it fits a little long but width is good.

for what it's worth, go watch your older videos and podcast appearances. you improved A LOT. Particularly you don't say um every 5 words anymore.
What's the basic approach to raid healing with disc? I've managed to get 5 man healing down to the extent that I'm confident to run m+ with it but that's mostly because of the small amount of players I have to watch over and can pre-apply attonement frequently without a big hit to mana.

However in a raid setting it seems like a cluster fuck. Aside from the tanks I don't know who to pre-apply attonement as aside from obvious mechanics I don't know who is going to be the one taking damage (especially if they fuck up mechanics and/or standing in bad things). Seems like 8 times out of ten another healer will have it covered as aside from direct penance or shadow mend (or shield) I don't have a big direct heal for those moments. 

FWIW I haven't ventured beyond LFR with my disc. Planning to maybe hop on normal runs with my guild when my main is fully geared from it.
I've spent the last 5 weeks or so just box squatting while letting my left quad heal up. I think I'm going to try free squatting starting next week.

Anyways, when starting box squats it felt so much shittier and worse than my free squats even at lower weights (box is right at parallel) but by the end of it I'm box squatting near my free squat (rep maxes, been working up to RPE 8.5-9.5 [under/overshoot give or take] every session) if not slightly above. 

Some numbers to give perspectives (x reps (Free/Box) in lbs @ RPE 9ish):

4 reps @ 9: 400/407 (407 box squat felt more like @8-8.5 but called it there to conserve quad health)  
3 reps @ 9: 405/415  
2 reps @ 9: 420/430 (430 box squat was closer to 9.5)  

I'm hoping that all this box squatting at parallel will carry over to my free squat as my sticking point was right above parallel (similar stance, no rocking a la west side style).
I’m not saying it wasn’t but on rogue comps human racial shuts you out in the first opener which was big with how bursty TBC was
in vanilla when fear was so prominent, yeah it was really strong too (just seemed weak when compared to wrath human racial which was for every CC)
that racial was so powerful in TBC arenas (I was an undead rogue) it made me sick. Then they removed it (Hurray!).... and gave them a pvp trinket as a racial and everyone and their moms rolled Human (myself included). If you can't beat em, join em.
Your weapon's ilvl via relics inflate your ilvl a lot to push it up there (you should be sitting around 940-950 using LFR/argunite relics), along with two legendaries at 1000 (the latter is probably the more vital part).

You can also get an argus crafted item and push it up to ilvl935 to give you a good boost.
Disc doesn't do enough damage to take up a DPS spot. It does enough to solo world content without ripping your head off but you're still a healer. 
nah it's ritsu
this was anti-climatic. I was hoping for a touch down lol.
lmfao what a crazy quarter
LOL "Might win in the CFL".... Ouch.
1. Until they perform well in a playoff series (I don’t think they won a game under 6 since their first stint with the Lowry/DeRozan pair since 2014)

2. Until LeBron is slain

I have higher hopes this season though especially with Lowry playing less minutes, DeRozan getting even better, and the new editions to our team (OG + 3J Kilometres)
Ah it was normal price (Apple products hardly go on sale!) but I got 2x100$ gift cards in Christmas which made it super cheap. 
Jesus is he STILL not back? I thought he was going to be back before ASG break. 
I listened to the 2F in a meet up a while back. Aside from the weight (and that hefty price tag) I enjoyed it, more than the HD 800s at least.
I just watched a how to mine bitcoin one because of this thread creating nostalgia. It was pretty batshit insane irrelevant to actual mining (with references to mining in minecraft) and ended the video with a total annihilation of the computer and machine gun barrage of eggs. 
me too, thanks.
I mean he was slowly ramping it up as videos went. We all knew it was going to get to a level we're gonna find obnoxious. I'm just glad he's not backing down from it.
Sorry to perform thread necromancy but I read in previous threads you live in Ontario. How much in total did you end up paying in CAD? I'm really tempted to get these and sell everything else I own if it is as good as Marvey on SBAF makes it out to be.
One thing I learned is to never rationalize apple products to non-owners. It's hard to justify the small things Apple gets right to make it seem like a worthy purchase because it's those things you don't realize until you use and learn about it yourself. I mean granted these are pretty expensive (hence why I only bought it with gift card now) but aside from sound quality it does away with a lot of issues bluetooth devices have. 

And I say this as a headphone enthusiast (I can't call myself an audiophile as that's a whole other level but I do enjoy quality sound): Yeah the sound quality of these aren't stellar but you're not buying bluetooth earbuds if you're expecting quality. If you're buying bluetooth earbuds you're buying it for convenience and guess what, AirPods nailed that like no other.

If sound quality if what people are after, stick to wired! Hence why I still haven't sold my Westones yet.
I bought me some AirPods with gift cards I got for XMas. I guess I'll listen to music at gym for once instead of my own grunts.
took the plunge and bought the airpod. It was the last one available in the mall (the website said not available but I went anyways and got lucky!). Bought it for ~$45 CAD with two gift cards I got for xmas.

Only a day in (and couldn't used it as much as I planned because my phone suddenly died from 70%....) so can't say too much but they sound a lot better than earpods and fit better too. I guess the lack of cables really does make a difference. Having said that, as soon as I listened to something more sonically complex (prog metal, rock, female vocals) it really exposed the short comings with the sound quality. This I already expected so I'm not really mad. I think they bumped the mid bass a little too hard though but I guess it's necessary when there is no seal.

All in all loving the experience so far. It's stupidly simple and it just works. Definitely up there as one of my favourite apple products. I think MBP/MBA takes a slight lead just because of how much better they were than Windows laptops back in the day to the extent it didn't make sense to buy a non apple laptop. Not so much now but yeah. I guess if you put the airpods into same perspectives amongst non-wire BT earbuds it also applies.
aka the dan john method
I mean they're both right. 

What Duffin says is correct as forcing the chest up when your hips can't get more in towards the ankles will lead to hyper extension which can lead to all sorts of issues if overly done especially with heavy weights. 

What Dan John says is correct too within context. 

what you need to realize is that not everyone can do a perfect squat like a weightlifter because we simply lack the combination of mobility + optimal leverages. There are various factors to look at from ankle + hip mobility, hip insertions, limb (tibial, femur)/torso length+ratios, etc.

The chest up cue can help people to get in the position better assuming they have the right factors as mentioned above. If they can squat with hips closer in, why wouldn't they? Chest up can be a cue used to get the trainee to squat more upright as if allowed it can push the hips in more. If not allowed, it can lead to thoracic hyper extension.

At the same time you're gonna see high level athletes ignore all the conventional wisdom and perform wild feats of strength because they simply can as it works for them. This doesn't mean it can work for you too. Tweak things around to see what works/doesn't work. It's something you get right via experience.
i was about to hop on it but wasn't too impressed with it along with the few reviews i found and the strength gains people made. Curious as to what people found it so attractive aside from the simplicity of it. 

I much preferred Greg's other programs, and they were free too.
hovering around 198-200 depending on bloat. Hoping to lean down more by june. Winters are a lot colder!
Apparently with the way it's shaping up it got Sean (original Fortis owner) kind of jealous and he's hoping to make some upgrades to the OG location too (I did read the word "expansion" in the last mail...).

Hopefully it'll be as every bit magical as the OG was to me.
I'd take a week or two to feel it out first and to make sure you stay out of zones that trigger pain. Not even just following a program, just work up to some number to see what you can handle with only moderate difficulty and build up from that.
Same way as any exercise just need to consider the constraints it comes with it. I personally hate higher reps on FSquat and stick to 6 reps at most. 

If you're not very proficient with the lift yet I'd stick to linear periodization first to get a better feel of it + better gauge RPE. After that just working up to a set of 6/5/4 @ 9 + back off sets are usually a safe way to program squats while keeping things free-flow.
he's well known in Canadian powerlifting circles but haven't got the best exposure out of it outside of reddit.

and there's something about powerlifting/weightlifting that attracts AV guys to wanting to use it as a medium for their work/portfolio. 
I never take a complete week off. Always have to be lifting something. I stick to around 60-70% for the most part, 80% at tops and take it easy and just have fun for the week.

Personally for working up to a RM, I usually have a weight in mind that I know/should be able to hit with 90-95% certainty. Say I'm going for X for 6RM. I usually do 90 and 95% of that weight for the same rep set then evaluate whether I can hit X for 6RM as expected, or go under/over depending on that 95% set. So yes, keep it to lower reps (they are warm ups) until closer to target.
Bryce is working with a small team that does the filming and editing/post-processing and stuff. It'd be a pretty hard job for one man to do.
Checking out new gym today that;s a lot closer to my workplace. Already know the owner and staff as I used to train at their older location. Finally getting a change of scenery after training out of my alma mater's facilities for the past 6.5 years.

For those in the west GTA (Canada, ON) looking for a new home, check it out and hopefully I'll see you guys there! https://www.instagram.com/fortiswest/
thanks!
ye saw the first two, didnt know about the two from new years eve!
Apparently BPT is how I find out about the new Chappelle specials on Netflix. Thanks guys! I needed this after today.
Shitty way to start the year. 

Failed by final driving test today because I got nervous (We have two driving tests here in Ontario), and because I waited too long for the second one, my license expires in Feb 22. Combine with the fact that it might be hard to get a driving test booked in time, really stressed that it might expire and I have to start all over. 

Ugh. 

Here's hoping they give me an extension they sometimes give to some people in these situations.
I had no power for over a week in my neighbourhood because no one noticed/reported a branch that fell and broke the powerline down the street until much much later. I had to call hydro & our counselor constantly to get someone to come. 

This was THE winter for me and will never bitch about winter until it gets worse than that.
> A few people have recommended Priest

specifically holy priest. Disc healing playstyle is very different from other healing specs which might throw you off as it is very proactive vs reactive (most other healers are reactive).

> Night Elf Druid, partially because the guide said they have both DPS and Healer specs

Priests have holy/disc for healing, shadow for dps too! But druids are also a great class that has a spec for any role (melee/ranged dps, tanking, healing. Only class with FOUR specs). 
In a pure utilitarian aspect it'd have to be druid or monk or paladin so I can play any of the roles I want (druids especially as they have both ranged and melee DPS).

In early expansion assuming you can't afford any items that'll let you harvest herb/mine nodes without getting off your mount (there's gonna be one for BfA, I just know it), druids would be king. Then you can farm faster, make more money, be more flexible for whatever.
> I think its largely going to depend on how wide your normal stance is.

I fear that was the case. Majority of box squatting content I've glossed over for those that are using it as a main movement driver (a la conjugate/west side) tend to have a somewhat wide squat stance. I have a pretty moderate stance (shoulder width) so I don't think it'll be that big of a carryover. I merely used it to still be squatting in some sense but just outside of the pain range so the actual movement was similar to my squat except stopping at the box. I did rest  slightly once sitting (very slight of that rocking movement you see in box squat videos though mostly to sit up right a little more once sitting on the box) but didn't use momentum getting back up.
Been box squatting (at parallel if not JUST a hair line above) for the past 3 weeks or so while babying my left quad tendonitis. Been handling 85-95% weights which have been moving well at that depth. I think after 2 weeks or so I should be okay to free squat again but I'm in no rush. 

What are the chances all this box squatting actually transfers over and I get stronger from the above/at parallel position coming out of the hole which has been my weakest position? That'd be pretty dope.

Also I love the Ohio Power Bar (the 20kg variant that's IPF approved). My spine + rhomboid/traps have never been so happy squatting.
my greek friend that doesn't follow NBA at all was at the game and with the folks serenading him. The greek support is strong.
goooood shit my dude!
“Wait you can’t- “

Famous last words
that was a slugfest wow
woooooooooooooooow im a believer
BOMBS
both my streams died on the same spot lol
The pair that got away 😫😢
I’m upset I can’t wear these. TTS is really annoying on the right foot because of the big toe keep getting caught against the toe box upper, and half size up fitting too big. Very great shoe for the price + comfort. 
I did the opposite and swapped to Spotify after using GPMAA for years. The biggest selling point of GPMAA was being able to upload my own music to have all my music under one app, as well as being able to freely modify playlist ordering manually (which to this day I don’t think Spotify still has on Android? Someone confirm for me). You’re able to upload your own music on Spotify but you had to perform some black magic via playlist to trick the platform which is far from ideal. 

My absolute biggest issue with GPMAA is the poor attention to detail in their curation. The artist page are littered with identical tracks but in different “albums” (album version, single, explicit album vs clean album [this was especially an issue before when some explicit albums would be the clean version and vice versa]), and because music is the main offering of the service, this should’ve been improved to be nicely organized like Spotify. 

Best thing about Spotify was their playlists. I forgot how much I enjoyed their playlists. I forgot how useful it was to find new music in the genre. I’m finding myself listening to music via their playlists more than I do directly via albums these days unless it’s new releases. Something about their playlist just feels more polished and organic vs Google’s offering. Oh and their app feels a lot more polished and premium (once I got used to the navigation and how they organized my library). I do miss having all my music under one app though. 
the suggestion you made in the video you linked should've been what the ultras (or ultra v2017?) should've been. Gets the lean streamlined look of ultra, with the big swoosh. Hot.
I thought they were pretty eh at first until I saw a pair of the golds in person on foot. Then I knew I had to get one and scoured everywhere to get one for retail lol, and copped the silvers in recent restock. Now they're one of my fav shoes but I can't fuck with the ultras for the most part, toe box looks whack.
You just found the new well of eternity/sun well because that thing just revived you 
Are the sizing for these that fucked up?
I just can’t get over the toe box of the men’s ultras. Not as bad as the silver bullet ultra but as a user here aptly said, it looks like a dolphins nose without the strips going all the way like in the originals. 

But these are hard though. 
The Mr B line of shoes are alright and they hold out for me for a while even wearing it daily. They look somewhat decent (as in it fits the MFA uniform lol), and good enough for beater shoes (you aren’t going to be wearing your Alden’s everyday). These are the only Aldo’s I buy. 

Having said that, I would ONLY buy these on sale (and they go on sale pretty often).
oh fuck this lady is back.


cozy boiz
Poor guy. Asks about Japanese Basketball, gets bombarded about Koroko no Basketball because no one knows a thing about it aside from anime. 

But have you heard of this guy named Sakuragi though?
1. A lot more better than I expected them to be initially, mostly thanks to the culture change, D3Mar D3Sharpshooter, and....

2. OG is a fucking stud. Didn’t expect him to be producing and contributing already

3. D3Mar D3Sharpshooter read all my posts bitching about him the past few seasons or something because this is his best ever yet. 
That catch and shoot in the inbound play was hot.  They were all hot. If he keeps playing like this I won’t have anything to bitch about him!
Suck dick for doncic
This is my favourite one
nah i definitely am not buying it for the sound quality as I'm aware of it being subpar (it should be slightly better than earpods though) but any upgrade in the sound department is just golden
heeeew. Here I thought we were gonna get Processed without Embiid. D3Mar D3Rozan playing like a possessed man though.
That is great to hear! Hope you enjoy them as much as I did!
Day 3 of staycation, booted up wow, logged into my rogue to just fuck around and get some WQs in. Opened a chest in Argus and got me the legendary gloves!!!

Great start to my Thursday! No more desperation to leggo grind on this character anymore as I got the shoulders and gloves now. 
The silver bullets seem really popular with the ladies and I’m not sure why. I love them too but I see the girls wearing these more often than I see men lol
They’re alright. Good enough for me to wear all day. You feel the air more after some break in. Really depends on your fit though because they run narrow and long. I sized up a half and have a more sloppy/relaxed fit. 
Air Jordan White Cement 4 (2016)
Hah you didn’t even have to. It has his name all over it in the first few secs of the beat. 
when you're no longer under the rule of Czar CP3
Ugh and I was set on buying these come January when I have gift cards to offset the price heavily.
Did box squats for the first time in like 5-6 years to get some volume in while not aggravating my left quad as it takes long ass time to heal. Worked up to 150kg x 6 @ RPE 7.5-8, then banged out 3 more sets at that . Felt lot heavier than the 170kg tempo squat I did last week though!
wow Lakers drafted a guy named Bryant twice, and they both got their jerseys in the rafters. talk about coincidence!
im so bitter that I missed out on the obsidians. Had it in cart but nike.ca site kept fucking up for me. I just love navy shoes.
usually (tends to be against non top tier teams) i see Spurs boxscore i feel so pleased. such a nice spread & distribution of minutes and contribution.
That really depends on what kind of sound you like as well as the form factor (IEM, over ear, on ear, open vs closed, requires extra amping [which then requires additional purchases to give it enough power], etc). 

Under 500 (I’m guessing USD) is a lot of room to work with though. You can probably get a better answer in /r/headphones, post under the buying advise thread. 

Though I’d wait till Boxing Day to make a purchase. Some popular headphones such as Hifiman HE-400i (mostly neutral sound but deep sub bass not offered by most headphones) and Philips Fidelio X2 (warm sound aka extra bass but not overwhelming) tend to go on sale often and those offer asound that tends to cater towards most consumers (and doesn’t require extra equipment to power it). If you’re wanting an open ear headphone that doesn’t require extra amp and okay with those sound signatures I’d keep an eye on those (note neither are portable). 
I've worn it as a daily beater like 3-5 days a week for like a year straight (given weather is appropriate). The forefoot boost is near non existent. The boost in the heel is no where near as cushioning as the uncaged pair I bought a year later. 

Boost definitely does flatten out after wearing it very often and loses its cushioning. It's  still comfortable to some extent but no where near it was when it was new.
You must’ve been eating metric shit ton of food before you started doing this if you lost 10 lbs in two weeks. Yikes! Keep it up!
Well EarPods are not a good measurement of quality (they’re not good). Due to the lack of isolation of AirPod fit there are a lot of limitations (mostly with respect to bass since that requires a seal for a good impact and speed) but the onus is on them to work around and improve it to beyond what is there. 
Always room for sound quality improvements. 
you got a point with the price justification but knowing apple they can get away with raising it and it'll still sell.

As per sound quality... the demo I tried on my friends' wasn't too impressive but I knew what I was paying for (convenience!)
Just copped the silver right now to go with my golds. Good way to end the year!
The 3M strips going around the sides are. 
Copped the am97 silver bullet in store. Was about to go far downtown to a boutique store to get it but saw KDC post that footlocker was dropping it. Saved me an hour!
I only played my 100-109 alts when invasions were happening (0 heirlooms). It was a bit of a struggle but I finally got my disc priest to max lvl that way with very little actual playing time (more spent waiting on invasions)
I really want AirPods but it's almost a year old and I'm afraid of Apple releasing a new revision right as I buy one. I wouldn't care so much if it was just adding wireless charging case or something else to the case but if there was any sound improvements I'd be pretty pissed.

To buy or to wait even longer?
I didn't really care for apple pay too much since Touch ID doesn't always work for me flawlessly to be more convenient than physical card... until recently.

I started working at new office at a client's site for different project so I wasn't really accustomed to things. They don't give out free beverages here so when out at lunch I forgot my water bottle to get water, and didn't have wallet to buy drinks, and my desk was all the way on the opposite side of the building so I got lazy.

then I remembered I had apple pay and just bought it that way to quench the thirst.

I don't always use Apple Pay but knowing I'll have a way to pay for things without my wallet makes life a lot simpler with less worries (I usually have my phone with me at all times vs wallet).
I watched a video of Rich Piana's 8 hour arm workout which wasn't exactly 8 hours but condensed down but still long. I can probably sit and watch 15 mins of arm work.
MRS approach for accessory work was the biggest take away I got from GZCL method. Less thing to think about and just go ham and chase the pump.
Mister KoC killing teams left and right.

Write one about the Patriots pls.
been getting a lot of AP from bonus rolls and a lot of junk from LFR and M+ weekly so that's pretty cool. I've been pretty lucky with mount drops in 7.3 but getting literally nothing with respect to gear lol.
don't eliminate the movement all together. Stick to 70% AT MOST, and do slow tempo work. Slowly move on to doing pause squats, just make sure you're not giving the tendons and muscle group area sudden stretch at the hole: lower yourself down in controlled manner.

along with that, rehab accordingly.
Been doing a loose cut for the past few weeks and I feel seriously skinny. Haven't checked the weight in a while (200lbs when I last checked) but if we're going by feel, I reckon I'm sub 200s now. Wouldn't be surprised if weight went down because of atrophy in quads as I had to decrease volume and intensity quite a bit because of my left quad issue. Oh well. I just wanna be unfat.
hard to say as I haven't back squatted heavy ~~in~~ outside my SBDs in a long while, only for weightlifting and front squating. But if I had to gauge by confidence, I don't think I could hit my 1RM with me rehbands on, at least with the same bar speed (felt like a 9-9.5 with SBDs, probably a 10 with rehbands, even if it's placebo)
If you don’t care for squeezing every single possible advantage in your lift I’d just get Rehbands. I went TTS in both (actually sized up for SBDs since I sized for calves) and the Rehbands are hands down a lot more comfortable. SBDs I try to get through the workout asap so I can take em off lol. They can also restrict your movement (imo at least) so I don’t wear it for weightlifting when I need full speed and mobility. 

As per the difference between the OG and new Rehbands, 7751s are thinner and offer less support. I’d skip out on those if you want to give more care for the knees. 7051s and 7084s are similar but I’m not sure if my 7084s shrank on me but they fit a bit tighter (and thinner after a lot of uses) than my OGs. The OGs are in relatively decent shape aside from the inner stitching starting to come undone slowly make it feel a tad annoying when worn because of the loose yarn. I’d buy the 7051s if I had to buy between the two again but the 7084s are less annoying with comfort since the seams are on the side vs behind the knees. 
I've worn both Rehbands, and now wear SBDs along with the Rehbands depending on the day and activity. SBDs make squats easier as they give a lot more support than the other two. You literally bounce out of the hole a lot easier than Rehbands. 

If you actually care for competing, you want the SBDs/Slingshots (depending on federation rules)
Thicker (specs may say other wise but they feel thicker when worn but that might be due to tightness) and they give more support in the hole. I've used both 7051s and 7751s for years and got SBDs this past August. They make squats easier than rehbands ever did. If you're a competitor and you actually want to compete, rules allow it so you're only holding yourself back if you aren't wearing them.
I love up-tempo aggressive music in general. Death Grips just takes it to another level. I like being able to vibe with the artist and the music and I can feel the sheer amount of anger and aggression and energy in their songs... but there are limits for me. Some tracks just flat out do not have any coherent melody to my ears and that's when I skip to the next track. Many folks here have cited The Money Store to be a more mainstream sounding intro friendly album to Death Grips but I honestly think Jenny Death (2nd half of Power That B) is more accessible.
my first exposure to Death Grips. this track had me fucked up.
I get what he's getting at but majority of anabolics worth taking are injected. This just looks like no-name brand molly.
it's a lot of volume at various %s in the 5 day variant at least which is a popular choice. It's a less stale take on a LP program meant more towards more experience beginners/intermediates. 

Personally recommend to start light to give yourself room to build momentum.
Not home yet: Is LMA adjusting well to Kawhi’s return?
I think it was Ed Coan that also stated you have a weak back if you do a squat morning.

I'm inclined to go with weak quads assuming the lifter doesn't have glute activation issues.
look there are two things torontonians love to do:

1. Stand in lines
1. Bitch about things

This was equal parts epic, cringy/corny, amazing. was a big fan of it back in the days.
Me when I'm trying to do Legion Invasions to level my disc priest. I can solo things and maybe a few more but those fuckers just won't die. They have inflated health even with level scaling so it takes forever.

I only level through invasions because of the godly xp so I kind of forgot what it feels like to level against normal mobs. Do they die faster?
only on Android (and is the best reddit app imo and I miss Android because of it). If you're on iOS you don't have much options with decent reddit apps outside of Apollo (it looks uglier than the official app but it works better).
don't be dumb like me and end up getting a quad tendonitis from attacking the quads too hard lol. 
It’d be something if OKC fails to make playoffs while Indiana and NYK do. They’re playing like doodoo right now. 

Hopefully they get their shit together. 
Off topic but related: I had a course with Farzan for 2nd year computing theory. My worst experience in a course ever (average was 30%, got petitioned to the undergrad chair) and steered clear of her courses ever since. I even dropped it and took the accelerated variant of the course and did/learned better lol. Though I heard she was decent for software verification course. 

She’s well known in the faculty for her research but rather controversial when it comes to teaching. 
This is gonna make Romaleos 1 weight look like a joke. Grounded to the floor like cinderblock for days
Being homophobic?
I think that's what majority of non weightlifting spectators think.
Anker, MPow, Parasom, all around 30$ CAD. 
AirPods can be charged on the go and are usable after a short charge. They’re also cordless which was another thing I was looking for. And I’ve been through those generics, their connectivity is garbage. Even though the sound quality is subpar, AirPods at least have good connectivity while being used (none that I experienced borrowing my sisters pair).
Killer deal for adipowers. bought a pair myself to replace my OG Romaleos 2 from 2012. Just wished they were the OG neon orange or the triple blacks (triple blacks sold out at the time of purchase).
You're not wrong technically (regards to build quality) but the heel isn't as terrible as you make it out to be. They're the same EVA used in Power Perfect IIs (albeit different effective heel elevation) which are used by international level weightlifters (David Bedzhanyan to name one) and can handle heavy weights fine.
Works with Androids too. The touch controls requires some extra tweaking however.

I really want to buy a pair as it's the only one that really nails the convenience of bluetooth headphones while eliminating the hassles of it but I just can't swallow the price. I've accepted the subpar sound quality vs convenience compromise but it's still expensive.
man also should learn to cut his own damn steak.
LMFAO

Worst fans. I thought it was bad in Houston but they went next level from Rio and onwards
How long until rowdy Iranian fans spam Instagram again?

shout outs to SL/SL locks of Season 2. 
hah for the amount of time I've spent in the gym, I haven't made the best progress due to various reasons. My body also tend to respond well to squats (Asian genetics, go figure) so there's that. 

it's a marathon, not a sprint!
Quad tendonitis feeling slightly better but still not ache/discomfort free. Even took it easy on squats ~~today~~yesterday, just did tempo at 140kg. 

Luckily not aggravated in deadlifts since not enough knee flexion to fully stretch the muscle. 

Maybe I should holla at my therapist before the holidays begin.
I don't even need to click to know what that video is. bulletproof ligaments.
wow that's the most obscure reference I've seen in a long while..
Fake weights. They look shiny like the ones used in China \#internetdetective
I literally went to NYC for a weekend trip just for pizza. 
I had a 6 and was lucky enough to get a 6S+ for free as hand me down, but still waiting for next years offering by Google and Apple to make a flagship purchase. With the refinement they make to the X form factor and design I’ll feel more assured buying it vs a first iteration product. 
Lol wow how did Korea win a gold? Thought my country’s weightlifting days were behind them with the young prospects not looking their best. Good surprise to come back home to. 

Won Jeongsik fighting!
Ah so basically set the TM of block pulls higher than the regular DL to compensate for the change in difficulty. Are you still doing the typical T2 rep ranges? Rarely see anyone doing block pulls at higher rep ranges (though I guess it tones itself down in later weeks)
how would you program block pulls (just below knee) into GZCL structure? I feel like its efficacy is in the higher %s as well as overloading. Definitely has no place in T2 or T3. Maybe deadlifts are one day I should break away from the template?
I see what you're getting at but those simple but subtle lines do add a lot when the canvas you're working with is just plain black.

I think black rope laces (non thin) with thin white patterns (I have no idea what you call those things) would work well.
Man needs to start using non bumpers or at least bring out the old school 50kgs if he wants to actually challenge himself!
those were my oooooooold beaters couple years ago in a diff color way. Still somehow in tact. now used as lawn mowing/yard work shoes.
I beat my UB 2.0 piss toes (the weird grey/yellow/white gradients) to death. The boost compressed a lot and it doesn't feel too good any more so I decommissioned though.

Current beats are my Asics Gel-Lyte III Okayama white denim. I've been meaning to give these a clean to see how the denim wear is like but been mad lazy about it. These are also surprisingly warm so they're great for fall/winter.
how's the sizing on this vs the older UBs? TTS vs half size up?
I can feel the buttery suede and/or nubuck from the picture.
not a fan of the laces but those white lining on the cage is a great addition. White heel cup on black UBs are super hot.
lol same. been too chicken shit to wear them as they'll probably get dirty SOMEHOW in a single wear. 
good initiative. it's not the best metric as some people are volume warriors and vice versa but it's something you can use as an indicator aside from RPE. 

I'd suggest learning to gauge RPE of your rep out sets (http://articles.reactivetrainingsystems.com/2015/11/29/beginning-rts/) in the earlier stages so you are able to gauge your efforts. you'll thank me later for your future. To start you off, the "Leave 1 rep in the tank" notion Wendler uses basically means RPE 9 (1 rep from failure).
starting light is not a bad thing: it gives more room for growth. Stay patient and work with it. After a couple of cycles it really adds up. If you feel like you can do more work, toss in accessory work at the end.
Canadian homies that still need a weightlifting shoe or looking to buy a new/extra, Adipowers are going for $100: https://www.adidas.ca/en/mens-adipower-weightlifting-shoe/M25733.html
Since this is your first cycle I'd skip the deload and run it back to back. If you selected the correct TMs you shouldn't feel too fatigued after one cycle.
Mistake, or a great decision? Because these are hot.
Really glad I didn't get the power perfect 2s and the romaleos 3 sale now. I'll just grab these. Hopefully sale is on tomorrow so I can go in stores to try on size before pulling the purchase.

Thanks!

Recently discovered a gym in my new office that isn't too terrible for doing smaller work so I may give something like this a shot. Except I'd probably have to mix and match as my main workout would be in the evening (eg: smaller upper workout in morning when I'm doing a main lower workout in the evening). Or should I just use the morning as a primer workout to get the body moving?
Just need to get used to weight placement and balance. Your stance may also change slightly due to feet positioning. It shouldn't take long until you find your bearings.
Jesus, the synopsis of this made me sick.
The Room (2003)
I have a routine I go through for every lower body session:

1. Ankle rockers
1. Quad + Hip stretch (yeah yeah MobeWOD but it works for me and I see other sources also doing it so why not: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBHzXF-mVjY the part where he's on the ground with one leg forward & bent. I do a circular motion with the knee in both directions, then lean my torso into the leg via pivot of the torso with the opposing arm reaching high up in the ceiling, it's good for my back too)
1. Russian babymaker
1. Standing dynamic Hip flexor stretch
1. Glute activation work (My go to is sitting in the squat up right as possible with weight held in the front and focusing on the activating the glutes to stay up right)

After all this I'm good to go. I also toss in some empty bar GM, as well as just rounding my back in straight leg deadlift position with an empty bar for the erectors as well.
get a snow blower. it's a life changer. im actually looking forward to snow day.
they're different things. 

if anything you can do an ad-hoc reverse hyper with back extension stations (the parallel to floor ones, not the 45 degree ones). Instead of mounting yourself for regular back extension, you face the leg peg, rest stomach on pad, grab the peg to station yourself, and perform reverse hypers with dumbbell between legs.

obviously this limits the weight severely but is a good work around. 
and a big black dildo
Running VDIP while on a mild cut. Coming off of 5/3/1 so I'm used to max rep sets. 

half way through week 5, finally getting difficult to the point that I'm not pushing +15 reps anymore. Hit 15(5/5/5) on 173kg squat, 12(4/4/4) on 250lbs bench (I'm thinking of repeating the weight instead of pushing +5lbs). 

Developed a mild quad tendonitis on my left quad. I think it's from pushing quad work rather hard as I'm trying to address the weakness. Getting better now but trying to decide if I should keep pushing it or deload with the squat next week.

> age / training age

27/6 years
> bodyweight before / after

~203-204lbs when I started? Last weighed in at 200lbs

> lift stats before / after (1RM/3RM/5RM, etc)

S/B/D: 201kg/275lbs/200kg

Fully expect this to maintain if not small fluctuations due to dieting.

> what you like about VDIP

Simple as hell. As soon as you get the initial setup done everything is autoregulated.

> what you don't like about or would change about VDIP

stupidly tiring for lower body T2. This could be an individual thing but after T1 on lower body days I'm fucking tired. Trying to push my ass off in T2 is pretty gruelsome. I mean I'm still hitting above the minimum rep range to elicit progression but still.

Also not that it matters too much but I don't think it's the best for T3 without change in the RM. T3 performance really depends on your fatigue level from the previous tiers and usually as the week goes on it's going to increase so it's not too surprising if you start plateauing/worse. I'm still working with the 10-15RM on first set to gauge what weight to be used but I end up repeating the similar rep counts week to week. At this point it might be best to either change the exercise up so that you're not wasting your time doing the same shit over and over, or introduce some periodization with weight selection. 

For example this could be a 4 week progression (very much like what's used in J&T except toned down in rep max) where in week 1 you use a 15RM, week 2 you use a 12RM, week 3 you use a 10RM, week 4 you use a 8RM, etc. 

Having said all that, the concept of just going balls to the walls per set in T3 really helped with hypertrophy. I actually feel bigger (upper body all around) even though I'm losing weight. It's kind of magical. I can only imagine it'll get better with some periodization introduced.
that's probably because you're following the spreadsheet to the T, when it should serve as an example. Just take the concept of VDIP + GZCL structure and make your own routine (eg: 4 day Upper/Lower split).
reached the point in VDIP where my reps per set is the same all across for my T1s. I guess the weight I'm working with I'm at the point of RPE where the next rep will be a technical degradation but grindable but not at the point to cause a big physical fatigue. 

FWIW I used to grind out hard when doing 5/3/1 but taking extra caution with it in VDIP since I'm doing multiple sets of it.
I mean it's a pretty generic structure for any general strength/PL program except GZCL has defined it more with intensity & rep range per tier.
If you have access to car or are willing to cab it, The Bar is a small and cozy but well equipped PL gym with nice staff. 

If you want something closer to mainland vancouver, Spartacus Gym is a decent old school feeling BB gym.
you'll always have those extra letters next to your name that most people won't have!
It’s kith x ASICS, it’ll sell out, initially at least. 
I NEED these
Pam's? It closed few month ago unfortunately.
wait, where in ossington are you getting that jerk chicken
most likely software/tech. they hire out of country a lot.
haven't tested high enough to observe a failure. my sticking point seems to be the transition from below to above the knees when doing max rep sets (always stopped this at around RPE 8.5-9 so never observed failure to comment on where the miss is either). 

Currently my squat and deadlift maxes are the same at 200kg lol (FWIW I've been weightlifting for the past 4 years or so, just transitioning into general strength training/"powerbuilding" few months ago). Technically they're caught up but I feel like I'm deadlifting a lot less than one usually would ratio wise Sq:DL.
this actually made me smile lol. so wholesome.
amazing bench gains. what was the change in body weight though?
but /u/gnuckols how i fix opposite problem? In case you end up reading this: In an old T-Nation article of yours for deadlifting you mentioned for those with short arms (and I think long legs, short torso) you recommended conventional with a lower drop in hips than the usual. Do you still recommend this? I tried sumo every now and then but my hips feel like they're going to explode, just can't find the groove.
if it's a standard olympic bar you should be fine.
Upped quad work to go along with VDIP stuff to address quad weakness. End up with quad tendonitis on the left quad lol.

I'm a veteran to patellar tendonitis but not this one. Can I still do light work or is it recommended to stop all movements that cause aggravation to the area (basically whenever the quad is stretched)? FWIW, I could still squat heavy without issues, just the area above the knee gets rather uncomfortable in the hole (Not shooting pains like patellar tendonitis).
Why not? Especially if different conferences?
I always get a little upset when he shoos Xerxes away like that.
Only adidas shoe I really liked this year. Can't find the greens anywhere in Canada though.
Might've been the display model pair. A pair of the white ones I saw in retail were looking a little dirty, probably from being handled often.
in the same boat myself. are there even going to be deals for holidays? I feel like Apple products hardly go on sale especially if they're only a year old.
Been on the market for the last little while as the temp iPhone 6 I was using was just dying on me sporadically (old battery), and it was rather frustrating to use with apps constantly closing on me (ie: lack of multitasking), and some other stuff.

Through trickle down hand-me-downs, got my hands on an iPhone 6s Plus for the time being. The extra gig of RAM really does make a big difference on apps not being closed by garbage collector, iOS isn't so frustrating anymore for the most part (looking at you, god awful notifications). 

The plus really does feel obnoxiously big and heavy like I thought, even compared to the OnePlus One. Played around with my dad's X and I find it to be the almost perfect size and weight so I'm really eyeing on the next iteration of that design.

I'm set to wait another year to see Pixel 3 vs iPhone X-2 (Xs?) to decide on a new phone. I've yet to own a flagship device (OnePlus One doesn't count) so it'll be a big purchase.
MFA had a huge thread on this pair as a cheaper alternative to the killshots lol
Oh I thought it was gonna be called industrial electronic or something. 

I listened to Kavinsky and Justice as well though the latter seems to be leaning more towards dance in the newer work. 
they even copied the touch bar in the bottom lol. At least they did something to differentiate the android software from other OEMs.
very standard in software. There's multiple phone/online interviews to weed people out. Then there's the on-site interview where you spend anywhere from 3-6 hours interviewing several interviewers, and sometimes while you're eating lunch!
any sold state amp with a clean source/DAC. they're very easy to drive and probably could get a good amount out of it directly from your device if it has clean output (low noise).

Though I haven't listened to mine in a while, iirc you get better subbass with a proper amp.
DAE half black????
im surprised they even had sales. 
For lower body week 2. A good balance of weight and repetition.

Not so picky for upper body.
Just compete, don't worry about weight for first competition. Water cut to fit into -74kg if you really want to assuming it doesn't hinder performance.

Slowly (and properly) bulk up to 83kg and fill in the weight class.
Weighed in at 200.8lbs yesterday which is the lowest I've been since 2013. Except this time around my upper body felt bigger than ever and very little loss of strength due to a slower and more sustainable (read: sane) dieting (I actually stopped counting calories 2 months ago or so and it's working out fine). Visually I never looked better and the heavy increase in bodybuilding work clearly shows (I swear I got bigger on a deficit).

Wondering if I should do a reverse diet in December or just keep this up till the new years and do a reverse diet then to re-evaluate as I've been doing this slow cut since like May/June and I'm pretty sure my metabolism is all sorts of fucked.

Training wise, finishing up week 4 of VDIP. Things are now starting to get heavy and probably will be making slower increments starting next week. Decided to toss deficit pulls out and starting doing sumo as assistance movement after squats.

Question on squat assistance movement: Currently doing SSB and Front squats and from reading around I feel like it's redundant in some sense as they both address posture while FSquats work quads more vs SSB that tends to push you forward more (I can definitely do more volume with SSB though). I don't have a specific weakness in the squat aside from that general sticking point which you just need to get stronger for.

Thinking of swapping one out for pause squat (2-ct). Which one would you take out? 
I'm really into the sub-genre of music by artists like Danger, Carpenter Brut, and the more aggressive music in Hotline Miami OST (Perturbator, MOON, etc).

Any suggestions on artists along that kind of sound?
man when I saw these I knew I needed them but Canada never gets any good Saucony and if it does it's sold out instantly in-stores.

Can anyone comment/link to review on durability vs sweat? I got the grasp of what I’m paying for when buying one of these but would like to know that they can withstand sweat. 
I can't even imagine Embiid on another team.
good observation! I hope this fixes the fit issues. 
Canadians that ordered the 5, how much did you pay in duty/customs/taxes fees?

I remember back for OPO if you shipped via USPS you had a chance of avoiding getting hit by border inspection. Guessing this isn't true anymore.
got both, going after the obsidians next month!
from the videos around various channels on youtube he mentions they're velour inside (various sneaker channels when they talk to him in their vlogs and stuff, and I think the Round Two channel).
It’s against Phoenix so don’t be too surprised if Lonzo Balls out
Torontonians, Vans store in downtown got a restock of TNF Sk8 his
"Hero!"
yeah looks like $9 more for starting price (though 64gb vs 128gb). Going by CAD*
~$650 for the 64gb, ~725-750 for the 128gb depending on how much they plan to add onto price after currency exchange.
Neat pricing. Just a tad more expensive than the Essential. 
Carl Pei doesn't sound too excited to talk up there.
UX talk way too drawn out. Speaker unfortunately not the best at presentation to keep it captivating.

Oh... I thought these were the seeulaters or however you spell em
These are wild!!!

Also I see you KDC
It’s 499 USD in general which is a steal for what it is even with the flaws considered. I’ve been eyeing that phone myself too to hold me over for the year. Phone still has its problems but it seems like the team is doing a good job for the most part fixing things piece by piece, and it’s cheap so I feel like I can overlook the issues. 
> Essential (Andy Rubin's phone) I forgot how much I adored the design of this phone and the stock like experience, and the Camera! I’m currently leaning towards this

Camera still is subpar from my research (post-updates) but given the price tag it seems rather reasonable.
I only watch nba for the up and coming teams these days.

This is probably the last big content patch of the expansion. If you want to be able to experience the content while still current you probably will want to boost your favourite class to level up and gear and touch upon some end game content. Legion is pretty casual friendly so you can get a lot out of it than before without a dedicated raiding guild. 

The legacy content will always be there for you to come back and catch up on  

You can use the boost to create a character on a new server of your choice and make new friends and guild mates there! (Reddit has its own guild if you just need a place to chill in. Check /r/fth and /r/redditguild though subreddit isn’t as active ever since discord became a thing)
damn, that warm? I was thinking the same thing (also in Toronto) when I wore my old skools last friday.
> 1.) Are there still LFR groups for Emerald Dream and other earlier raids?

There should still be some people running it though the queue must be rather long since you can get equivalent if not better gear running heroic/Mythic+0 dungeons.

> 3.) As someone with a pitifuly low ilvl (and I still haven't finished Stormheim or Suramar) what's the fastest way for me to get my ilvl up to where I can do lfr?

Finish the zones and unlock world quests. You can get geared pretty fast via world quests + daily emissary cache. Run the normal/heroic when you can via auto queue. Run mythics when you can. Progress onwards with the storyline to unlock argus and its world quests. Occasionally the weekly quests (you'll find NPCs near violet hold) have you running dungeons for a cache. Those cache contain pretty high ilvl gear. 

> 4.) If I play LFR, does it matter what DPS spec I use? I adore my Frost DK, but I know their DPS is laughable.

Nope, just play something you enjoy.

> 5.) I just realized that my wife is....bad, at this game, what can I do to help her get better? And how forgiving is LFR for a beatmaster hunter who only spams 1 skill?

People usually don't pay attention to the DPS in LFR as long as you're not afk.
The adventure journal does a good job guiding you to where to go. In general you want to gear up via Mythic dungeons and LFR, and whatever gearing up system they introduced for that content patch. And hopefully you have found a guild that is at a similar point with you to starting raiding with. 
Forgot to mention, WoW has a very big economy to the point economists used it as a model for thesis. Some people play the game purely to play the market and make gold on the auction house.   Check out /r/woweconomy to see what the goblins are up to. 
It’s a surprisingly lucrative hobby. The really rare ones go for astronomical price on the auction house!
