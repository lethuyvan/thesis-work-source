If you're referring to me, I was just summarizing from the video. 
Brands like OnePlus, Lenovo and DJI are Chinese, but have cemented their place as 'international' companies in the minds of consumers due to their business policies targeting western markets. However Huawei remains as a Chinese brand, even the name is barely pronounceable. They are seen as cheap and low quality, with privacy concerns. To compensate, and provide familiarity in the people's minds, Huawei resorts to paying celebrities to endorse their brand. This is very expensive and an inefficient marketing technique as the celebrities' time doesn't come cheap.

Good stuff, you should make a separate post for that. 
Read the colored version of the manga - it's available till chapter 720 or so. It's really well done and you can get through it quickly.

If you're not able to find it, search for "One Piece - Digital Colored Comics" in any Manga app. 
Regarding the subreddit search bar - it needs to strip out trailing spaces that get added when using swipe typing.

Swiping Google and clicking the first suggestion goes to 'Google ' which gives an invalid sub error. 
Then I guess the solution is to Power Off from the options in TWRP, and then boot into recovery with Volume Down + Power key.
In case you still didn't get it working: Once you flash TWRP, you don't reboot into the OS, you need to open TWRP first to 'set it' as the recovery. So once the flash is done, reboot by holding down the power button instead of using the on-screen buttons. 

In the 'Your bootloader has been unlocked. Phone will boot in 5 seconds' screen, press the volume button until you see recovery and select it with the power button. Now it should boot into TWRP, and do the same every time.

If you do it this way, you can flash Magisk later whenever you feel like it.
Hey, the folders on the home screen now have only 3 rows instead of 4, and there's a HUGE 'Add more apps' button taking up unnecessary space. This is a step back in design and usability. 

Hope this change gets reversed, I'm leaving the beta program for now.

It doesn't even scroll right. How do you manage to fuck that up?

I was reading about rooting my phone, and came across this statement on the [TWRP page](https://twrp.me/oneplus/oneplus3t.html):

>This device uses dm-verity!

>This means that swiping to allow system modifications will prevent you from being able to boot if you are using the stock kernel. In order to bypass dm-verity's boot prevention, you will have to install a kernel that has dm-verity disabled in the fstab.

'swiping to allow system modifications' to my understanding is one of the first things you do after you flash TWRP. This seems to imply that I need to flash a custom kernel to be able to use my phone after that. But doesn't seem right as no guide mentions this fact. Is it required?
This one looks good.

Personal preference I guess. The N2DSXL is a bit lighter and has a modern design. The only problems might be bad speaker placement - it's not forward facing like the N3DS. (Check some youtube reviews).

And yeah, the N2DSXL has no 3D. Take a look at these threads:

https://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/2x0pt4/best_uses_of_3dmost_stunning_3d_in_games/

https://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/5z6sw0/what_3ds_games_have_the_best_3d_effects_new_owner/

https://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/5dwyfl/what_games_make_best_use_of_the_3d_effect/

If you think you'll be playing any of these games then you should consider the N3DS. I don't think there would be a big difference in cost since the N2DS is still pretty new.
The 3DS is definitely nearing the end of its life cycle. You should buy it mainly for the huge library of games it already has. If none of those games interest you (unlikely) then maybe you should think twice.

The launcher is beautiful! The distinctive sharp edged look was something I always liked about Windows Phone.

Edit: Swipe up on home screen to show quick toggles is really handy, don't have to reach all the way up anymore.

Edit 2: Yep, I'm sold on this one. Some nice features:

1. Swipe down for really quick universal search (Contacts, apps and web). One tap QR scanner on the search widget.
2. Swipe up to reveal a dock with quick toggles (Wifi, data, brightness, etc.) as well a row of apps you can pin. Probably the best feature. Makes bigger phones easier to handle.
3. Swipe right to reveal a feed area, which seems to be a better implementation of the OnePlus Shelf. Has calendar, news, recent apps, notes, top contacts and you can also add any other widget too. I particularly like the Notes widget.
4. Customizable gestures - map double tap, double tap & swipe etc to custom actions.
5. Sharp and neat design reminiscent of Windows Phone.

I like it a lot better than the OnePlus Launcher and it's a refreshing change from the standard UI design in Action, Nova etc. Definitely using this for a while.

So I did some digging around and it seems like Richard Pavelle was one of the original Rubik's cube enthusiasts in the early 1980's. So doing it in 5 breaths in those days, especially with the primitive hardware is quite a feat actually.

Found this mailing group from 1980: http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Martin.Schoenert/Cube-Lovers/

Has posts like people getting excited about the first commercial release of a 4x4! Quite a piece of history.
The software that generates the scrambles filters out the ones that can be solved optimally in 11 moves or less. In practice, even the best cubers take about 40 moves.

>Wouldn't be more competitive to solve a series of cubes instead of just one?

Nicely deduced. The 'average of five', of which this solve is a part, is derived by doing five solves and taking the average after removing the best and worst solves. Since it's extremely unlikely to get lucky in consecutive solves, averages are a better judge of a speedcuber's calibre.

[The current average world record is 5.97 seconds.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWUQbhbqvqo)
No other brand makes completely reliable timers. I'm sure that if they do, the regulations will be updated.

All the other ones are cheap chinese imitations.
Nothing for the World Record holder, unless a cube manufacturer wants to sponsor them advertise their products.

First prize for 3x3 at the last big competition (World Championships in Paris) was 1500 Euro.
Well they claim 0.001 accuracy. Maybe someone can test that with a high speed camera pointed at the display.

Scrambles are generated by a computer program which ensures true randomness, while eliminating the ridiculously easy cases. World record solves are indeed based on getting lucky and skipping one or two steps in the solve.

You can absolutely give a randomly scrambled to them. I think [this short documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwNUmnDu1r8) does a good job of explaining how speedcubing works.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feliks_Zemdegs
The scrambles are generated by computer software which filters out the cases which can be solved in 11 moves or less. But in practice, no one can actually come close to that number. Most solves are at least 40-50 moves. 
That's right. They'll probably introduce the third decimal place at some point in the future as the records start getting closer.
Nah he's 22, probably 21 in the video

Well, most of them are perfectly normal people with an unusual hobby.

But since you mentioned it, the current World Champion, 15-year-old Max Park is indeed autistic. You can watch a really good documentary about how speedcubing changed his life here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHgC2Ru7_MQ
Modern Rubik's cubes can cut corners - i.e. the pieces are designed so that you can complete a turn even when there is upto a certain degree of misalignment (usually around 45 degrees).

Good beginners cubes cost only about 5 dollars, like the 'MoFang JiaoShi MF3RS'
For smaller events like the 2x2 it already is down to luck. But for 3x3, there are enough number of possible combinations to make ridiculous scramble extremely unlikely.

Even then, speedcubers' calibre is more accutately judged by they Average of Five times (where they do five solves and the average is taken after deleting the best and worst solves). Getting lucky for five consecutive solves is pretty much impossible.

[The everage record currently stands at 5.97](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWUQbhbqvqo)

For upto 15 seconds. If you take between 15 and 17, you'll be penalized by adding 2 seconds to your final solve time. Any more and the solve is disqualified. 
The 3 is ignored and the time is reported as 4.69
[Yep](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions/RallyInTheValley2017)
There always seems to be something memorable in these world record videos.

4.69 - "Oh my god, Oh my god..."

[4.73](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R07JiT0PlcE)  - Boner + "Just as my SD card runs out"

[4.74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLksISrKtO8) - Paper randomly flies into frame after the solve ends

[4.90](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh0W8E4cNkQ) - "WHAT ARE THOSE???"

[5.25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8RBl7NmL8g) - Some kid screaming like he's being murdered
Only that they have to be one of three specific models manufactured by this company: https://www.speedstacks.com/

The newer timers, including the one seen in the video are actually accurate to 0.001 seconds and the last digit is simply truncated.
Nah, there's nothing in [the regulations](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/#article-3-puzzles) that disallows rounded centers. 

Worth noting that all speedcubers use 'off-brand' cubes from China and not the officially licensed Rubik's Cubes, which are objectively worse.
Previous record was 4.73 by Feliks Zemdegs from Australia. [Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R07JiT0PlcE)

This week's episode was accidentally aired on television in Spain. Despite that, not a single person managed to record it. 

In comparison, our hotstar folks took something very few people could get their hands on, and released it for all the world to see. 
SCP Foundation. It's right up your alley
The Dragon stretching out its wings! :P
Does it still happen if you start and stop the timer with very minimal force? You should rule out loose connections and bad batteries first. 

Then open up all the screws and have a look inside. There are very little loose components inside so it should be easy to spot anything wrong with something other than the main IC (which is in a non desolderable glob top package). 

Maybe take some pictures too. 

A word of caution: in gen 4, you have to disconnect the touch sensors from the PCB before you can remove the board. If it's the same in that one, observe how it's connected carefully before you do that. 
I think we can mark down Andri Yatim as an unreliable leaker. He kept saying 3800mah and SD660 with such confidence...

I guess it's more about lots of small bits of data accumulating over the years that can tell quite a lot about a reddit user. 

For example, check out www.snoopsnoo.com. It analyzes your entire post history and can tell things like where you live, what you like to play and watch, what time you usually post on reddit, etc depending what you've let slip. 

But I definitely get what you mean by maintaining a presence. 
I just ordered a bunch of components so I can make the prototype into a mass produceable PCB. Once I get multiple units manufactured, I'll try to work on the software, though I really doubt I'll be able to get very far on my own. 

Apparently live.cubing.net (down right now) might allow data entry by submitting one average at a time. So an android app could record an a complete average of times, then send it to a computer, which pushes it to the internet. That's the basic idea at least. 
More like [ice cream beam](https://glutenfreepsd.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/downloaded-25-07-14-142.jpg?w=300&h=300)
Haven't experienced this problem myself, though I've heard a lot of people doing so. 

First try to isolate where the problem is. It can vary depending on your system, but make sure it's detected as a microphone. On windows, right click on the system volume at the bottom right, and go to recording devices. Make sure the microphone isn't disabled. The volume bar (thing that shows how loud the detected sound is) should be at a constant high. 

If it's not, then that means the stackmat isn't properly detected by the computer and you should fix that first. 
There's an Arduino microcontroller board which decodes the stackmat signal. Then it passes the decoded data to a Bluetooth Serial module which transmits it to the phone. 
Thanks :) 

Yes, I'm in contact with Jeremy and will take his advice going forward. Just added a GNU GPL to the repo.
Any way to get push notifications for these? I've never read a lot of Calvin and Hobbes and this seems like a good way to do it.
It's for my 9-year-old cousin and he'll be visiting with his family for the next two days. I don't think I can teach him the whole cube in that time, but I'll let you know how it goes :) 
Looks like the website isn't seeing your timer. Make sure you're on https://cstimer.net.
Also try firefox if that doesn't work. 
That's very strange, do you see the microphone icon in the top right of Chrome? 

If you think your timer may be faulty, check by installing audacity and pressing the record button. When you zoom in, it should look the image in the documentation page linked above. 
Of course, you only need a [2.5mm to 3.5mm converter cable](https://www.amazon.com/SF-Cable-Stereo-M-Speaker-Headset/dp/B005CGXCAM) for that.

Depending on what you already have, this should cost around $15-20 to make.

How will the battery hold up if the phone is about a year old? Any other possible issues?
He's a ~~14~~ 15 year old who originally started cubing at age 10 to help with his autism. He couldn't even open a bottle cap properly back then. 

Cubing helped him get over it, and he improved by leaps and bounds, at some point taking the 3x3, one handed and 4x4 average world records (very important records!). He's definitely a guy to watch out for in the upcoming years.

Does the friendseed method of unbanning still work? Speaking of which, are consoles still being banned?
Just curious, was this part of the original banwave or did it happen more recently?
I remember a goosebumps story where a guy and his friends find a tube of moisturiser or something in an old house. 

His friends dare him to apply it, and when he goes home he realises that he's sprouting thick fur all over his skin. That was a good story.

The concept of underground highways seems really fascinating to me. As Elon said, we are running out of space on the surface. Just as we put men and machines in orbit above
our heads, we need to develop the technology to do the same below our feet, which might arguably be cheaper in the long run than the former. 
Like floppy disks, microSDs will soon become a thing only seen in icons.
Again? You'd think they would have learned from all the negative press they got the last time.
Not too bad, but I think it's worth waiting to see what the Moto X4 has to offer. IP68+dual camera could be really nice.

1. Get patients to bring their Aadhar card and scan the QR code on it. It will automatically give you the name, gender, address, DOB, etc. (no internet required)

2. Take their fingerprint and store it in a database along with the Aadhar info.

3. During subsequent visits they just scan the fingerprint and you can bring up all the info.

Now that I think about it, battery drains even when no device is paired. It's probably just the shitty SD 615 that's causing it.

Some questions after watching the onboard video. 

1. Do cubesats and nanosats have their own propulsion? Otherwise it looks like the satellites are too close to be of use as a constellation. 

2. Why did the satellites drop to a lower altitude after being released? The launcher doesn't seem to impart any vertical force on the satellites. 

3. Where can I learn more about the mechanism with which the satellites were propelled out?

Yeah, quite unfortunately really. When I was about 75% done with the book, I would have easily rated it as one of the best books I've read. Things just get meh after that, and I found the ending really unsatisfactory.

I guess the selling point book is the thrilling fear of the unknown in the first half. And the characters are pretty good too, I guess.
Not the same scene, but I loved this bit from the book:

>She went back to the kitchen cupboard over the sink, where her father kept his tools. Among them was a pocket tape, the kind that runs out a long yellow tongue of inches. She folded this into one cold hand and went down to the bathroom.

>It was sparkling clean, silent. Somewhere, far distant, it seemed, she could hear Mrs. Doyon yelling for her boy Jim to get in out of the road, right now.

>She went to the bathroom basin and looked down into the dark eye of the drain.

>She stood there for some time, her legs as cold as marble inside her jeans, her nipples feeling sharp enough and hard enough to cut paper, her lips dead dry. She waited for the voices.

>No voices came.

>A little shuddery sigh came from her, and she began to feed the thin steel tape into the drain. It went down smoothly—like a sword into the gullet of a county fair sideshow performer. Six inches, eight inches, ten. It stopped, bound up in the elbow-bend under the sink, Beverly supposed. She wiggled it, pushing gently at the same time, and eventually the tape began to feed into the drain again. Sixteen inches now, then two feet, then three.
>She watched the yellow tape slipping out of the chromed-steel case, which had been worn black on the sides by her father’s big hand. In her mind’s eye she saw it sliding through the black bore of the pipe, picking up some muck, scraping away flakes of rust. Down there where the sun never shines and the night never stops, she thought.

>She imagined the head of the tape, with its small steel buttplate no bigger than a fingernail, sliding farther and farther into the darkness, and part of her mind screamed What are you doing? She did not ignore that voice . . . but she seemed helpless to heed it. She saw the end of the tape going straight down now, descending into the cellar. She saw it striking the sewage pipe . . . and even as she saw it, the tape bound up again.

>She wiggled it again, and the tape, thin enough to be limber, made a faint eerie sound that reminded her a little bit of the way a saw sounds when you bend it back and forth across your legs.
She could see its tip wiggling against the bottom of this wider pipe, which would have a baked ceramic surface. 

>She could see it bending . . . and then she was able to push it forward again.
She ran out six feet. Seven. Nine—

>And suddenly the tape began to run through her hands by itself, as if something down there was pulling the other end. Not just pulling it: running with it. She stared at the flowing tape, her eyes wide, her mouth a sagging O of fear—fear, yes, but no surprise. Hadn’t she known? Hadn’t she known something like this was going to happen?

>The tape ran out to its final stop. Eighteen feet; an even six yards.

>A soft chuckle came wafting out of the drain, followed by a low whisper that was almost reproachful: “Beverly, Beverly, Beverly . . . you can’t fight us . . . you’ll die if you try . . . die if you try . . . die if you try . . . Beverly . . . Beverly . . . Beverly. . . ly-ly-ly . . . ”

A video is essentially a series of pictures (frames) taken in quick succession, with a fixed time interval between them (something like 0.01-0.03 seconds).

 If the rotors are rotating at such a speed that it takes exactly the same time to complete one rotation as the camera's time between frames, then each frame of the video will appear identical. 

Edit: This would also work if the camera's frame rate period is a multiple of the rotor's rotation speed.

If he takes it down for any reason, then feel free to pm me. I have a backup.
There is a software that generates scrambles (sequences of letters that look like R D U' B L R'..., basically telling you to move the right layer clockwise, Down layer clockwise, Upper layer anticlockwise...).
Volunteers look at the generated scrambles and apply the moves to a solved cube. The cube is then covered and taken to the competitor for solving.

The software also makes sure that ridiculous scrambles like those that are one turn away from being solved can't happen.
I own one of those, and it's pretty unreliable and glitchy. Anyway, World Cube Association regulations require all competitions to use the same brand  (SpeedStacks) of timer.
You can visit /r/Cubers and follow all the info in the side bar :) 

The previous record was 4.9 seconds by Lucas Etter 
2x2 is even more of a luck based event. The current world record solve is at 0.49 seconds! 

https://youtu.be/U-rcPAsY5bY
That is correct :) 

Look at the solve stats below:

Reconstruction  
Scramble: B2 F2 D F2 L2 U R2 B2 F2 U2 L2 B' L2 R2 D' U2 L2 U' R' F R   

Inspection: x' y'  

Cross: L' D R2  

F2L-1: R U' R' U' L' U' L  

F2L-2: U2 R U R' U' d' R U R'   

F2L-3: y U2 R U' R' L U' L'   

F2L-4: y' U2 R' U2 R U2  

VLS: R' U R' F R F' U R  

AUF: U  
.  
Moves: 40 - 8.44 TPS﻿  

The AUF (Adjust U Face) at the end is what he got instead of a long algorithm that would usually be there. He skipped the pll but still had to do a single move (i.e. Adjust the Upper face, by turning it clockwise in this case). That is what caused the small pause that you can see. 
The bottom line is that the single solve world record has and always will be lucky. 

But among speedcubers, a lot more importance and respect is given to the average of five record, where you do five solves and they take the average after removing the best and the worst solves, and the chance of getting two lucky solves in an average is extremely small. 

Watch the video of the average world record here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93KEXSfKp4c. 
Watch the first five minutes of this video for an explanation of how blind solving works, using playing cards as an analogy: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JJWl-FDetWE

Robots are much faster than that! [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by1yz7Toick) a video of the Guinness World Record robot solve (0.887 seconds).
I don't know about that, but you can buy a pretty good beginner speed cube for $3.95 here: https://speedcubeshop.com/collections/3x3x3/products/qiyi-sail-3x3x3.

They're called stackmat timers. They look cheap, but are actually really high quality. It's 30 bucks for the timer and the mat. https://www.speedstacks.com/store/retail/speed-stacks-stackmat-pro/
All rules for competitions are defined by a voluntary body called the [World Cube Association](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/). For 3x3, there is a maximum of 15 seconds you can use for inspection, after which you've got to start the timer. And it's the same for everyone, all over the world.
If it means anything, I can vouch for it. I've been following speedcubing for over a year and a half now, and he's a very respected member of the community. In fact he even held the record earlier when it was 5.55 [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBM_AE0oQp8).

I can solve the Rubik's cube in about 19 seconds on average (best time of 16 seconds in competition) , and I can see that with tons of practice and effort it is possible to get there.
It's mostly because he's gotten really good at recognizing the patterns and looking ahead during solving. Also because he knows a lot of useful algorithms that he can use to his advantage depending on the case that shows up.

The method he's using a modified version of CFOP (Cross, F2L, OLL, PLL). 
This graphic shows the steps involved quite well: https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/advanced-cfop-fridrich/

Luck was certainly involved because he got lucky and skipped the very last step, called Permutation of the Last Layer (PLL). He was also able to skip the second last step called Orientation of the Last Layer (OLL) because of a modification of the step before that (First Two Layers, F2L) that he actually developed himself, called Valk Last Slot (VLS).

**More info:**

This is the World Record for a single solve, so the impact of luck is pretty high. The more important record is called the Average of 5 (ao5) record. It is currently at 6.45 seconds by the Australian Feliks Zemdegs. I highly encourage you to watch the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93KEXSfKp4c. 

In the ao5, you do five solves and the average is taken after removing the best and worst solves, greatly reducing the impact of lucky solves.

This means he now has 4 out of the five blindfolded records (3BLD single & average being the other two).

>B.Precise Arcs of Valk3 Corner Pieces , not just the normal circle or ellipse. But the Yuexiao one is segmented-circle the upper apart is normal circle , the remaining part is ellipse .

>C .Both of two cube made with hollow on the Corner Pieces . Just the requirement of the mold stripping, no sense on the design !

>D.The edge piece truncation work in different ways. Yuexiao use it as a coordination with edge pieces , but Valk 3 one is just to suitable for the special assembling .Cause the assembling of Valk 3 require more length splicing .

Considering buying one. Some questions:

* How often do you actually scramble and solve it?

* Do you own other lower order big cubes?

* How long does it take for you to solve it? Also, what do you average on 4x4 and 5x5?

Looks like it. In countries that are ahead in time, they seem to be waiting for the UK midnight. amazon.com.au says:

>Please note that "Harry Potter and the Cursed Child - parts one and two" will be released at 00:00 BST on 31 July 2016 (midnight UK time). Due to the time difference, the title will be delivered to your device starting from 09:00 AEST on 31 July 2016 (morning Australia time).

It's the script for a play that's going to start running in London soon.
Hey, not trying to discourage anyone here, I've preordered the book myself. It's just that some plot elements I read about really seemed out of tune with the rest of the books. 

However, reviews of the actual play have mostly been overwhelmingly positive!  Apparently there's lot of in-jokes and fan service too. So let's keep our fingers crossed. 
Have you actually read some spoilers for the play? I can pm you some links if you want. 
If you do happen to read it before launch day, please let us know if it's as shitty as we think it is. Would be a pleasant surprise if the answer is no.

Not between trainers. It's more like you claim a gym, leave a pokemon to defend it and go on. Others can fight the pokemon you left to try and capture the gym for themselves. 

And even then it's all just frantically tapping the opposing pokemon and hoping you don't get the glitch where the enemy remains with a sliver of health and the game gets stuck, depriving you of the gym you were so damn close to capturing...

Some of us do. I guess it's technically wrong since bucks is only for dollars. 
299 Indian Rupees :P 

Should have clarified.
I have a theory about that price markup thing. Cubelelo has an [Amazon store](http://www.amazon.in/s?me=A2579AA9223CFN) where they sell a lot of the same products as their website. By showing the MRP as much higher than it is, they can claim to have a 50-60% discount on the products. [Example](http://www.amazon.in/MoYu-AoLong-3x3x3-Speed-Enhanced/dp/B00MDBOK96/ref=sr_1_14?m=A2579AA9223CFN&s=merchant-items&ie=UTF8&qid=1466080500&sr=1-14).

I assume this boosts the hit rate for Amazon searches, and definitely promotes impulse buying when the general public sees such large discounts. Not the best business practice, but lots of sellers do this.
Agree with everything /u/drakeparker_d3p said. I've been ordering from them for about 2 years now and have had no complaints.

>* Usually 2 working days, can vary between 1-3
>* Shipping is free within India.
>* I've had no quality issues at all. However I once ordered a silver mirror cube and received a gold one. I could probably have returned it, but decided it wasn't worth the effort for a 299 ~~bucks~~ Rupees cube. And this was in 2014, and I have had no such problem since.
>* I've interacted with them a couple of times via their facebook page to enquire about stock availability, and they were always courteous and quick to respond.

In conclusion, I think this is the best cube store in India at the moment and would strongly recommend going for them over any random eBay/Amazon seller.

I went to IIA Summer Open 2016 in Bangalore, India. This was my fifth competition. Participated in 3x3, OH, BLD, and 2x2. 

BLD was a bust with no successes. This was expected since I barely practiced since my last comp where I got a 6:48 solve. 

2x2 Round 1 had some really easy scrambles and I got a 5.28s comp PB Avg. Completely choked in Round 2 and got an 8 and a 11 second solve which took the average to 6.75.

I did OH with no expectations and was surprised to get a 34 second average. I rarely practice OH, and there's a good chance this is my PB Avg. Also got a sweet 28 sec solve which is my second best solve ever. 

3x3 round 1 started off bad due to my usual nervousness, but finished with a comp PB Avg of 19.19. Previous was 20.00. Round 2 was amazing. Got an 18.13 average! Really happy about this. 

Prizes were decided by a top 10 sum of ranks system, and I was shocked to see that I was 10th! This is the first time I have ever won something from cubing, and is definitely going to keep me motivated. 

Thanks, if you read this far :p

Personally, I think it's a fun event where you can improve pretty quickly with minimal practice. My best world rank is for skewb, and I only practiced for a month before I got a sub-8 official average.

Also, I subscribed to your channel. I'll watch all four parts soon, I just love collection videos :P (you deserve more subs and views!) 
Which skewb shapemod would you recommend buying?

* LanLan Super Skewb

* QJ Hex Skewb

* QJ Skewb Dodecahedron

* QJ Skewb Ultimate

* LanLan Squished Skewb

* LanLan Master Skewb

Yeah, that's right. It's a bump cube variation that only shapeshifts in one direction. So if you did a checkerboard pattern, only one pair of opposite sides would have pieces that are not flush with the cube. 

(I understand this from the video. May be wrong though. )

So apparently all the Meiyus sent out to testers were defective, and Moyu is sending replacements. There is hope yet! 
I think you meant diffusers. 
Damn, lucky you getting all the puzzles before anyone else! But no video? 
Wait, that's not quite right. The Rainbow Inequilateral cube is a bump cube which shapeshifts only in one direction, hence needs stickers to identify the pieces. I may be wrong though. 
Tony Fisher's video has a less speeded up version of coren making the checkerboard pattern.

Where is this from? I need more! 
[This picture](http://imgur.com/pBqIbn6) shows a glimpse of it :) 
This would be a good time to add the bump cube to WCA :D

[Unboxing and review of this cube by Moyu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KwrVr1jYcg)
Not exactly. Here's what I do (assuming Speffz letter scheme):

If the if the target you're doing is odd, 

>A - M2

>Q - (B' R B U R2 U') M2 (U R2 U' B' R' B)

>C - U2 M' U2 M'

>W - M U2 M U2

>I - D (M' [U R2 U'] M [U R2 U']) D' M2

>S - M2 D ([U R2 U') M' [UR2 U'] M) D'

If the if the target you're doing is even, 

>A - Same as odd (M2)

>Q - Same as odd (B' R B U R2 U') M2 (U R2 U' B' R' B)

>C - Do the W of odd targets (M U2 M U2)

>W - Do the C of odd targets (U2 M' U2 M')

>I - Do the S of odd targets (M2 D ([U R2 U') M' [UR2 U'] M) D')

>S - Do the I of odd targets (D (M' [U R2 U'] M [U R2 U']) D' M2)

Or to put it simply, if you're doing an even target, you'll have to swap C↔W and I↔S, essentially inverting the algorithm.
Idk about the Meiying, but the Thunderclap is definitely a great cube and I think you should go for this. It's a much better performing cube than the yuxin 3x3. 
Caption credits :D
Superglue those small stickers on the crazy fisher or you'll lose them! 
Don't hesitate to try out new events, even if you may not be able to meet the soft cutoffs. You'll be motivated to practise  and do better next time. 
Shh bby is ok 
Good job! Advanced or intermediate? 
No post on Sundays. 
Awesome! Now we can finally give /u/rubiksbot the upvotes it deserves. 
I'm not really sure how to describe it, but the Thunderclap has a much more buttery feel and is way lighter than the skewb. (In fact the Thunderclap is the lightest among all the top 3x3s currently). Either way, you should definitely buy it to complete your qiyi stickerless set, it's a great performing cube (and quite cheap as well). 
[Here you go](http://imgur.com/a/g1kQq).

I'm not too happy with the way the yellow on the skewb looks in the picture, but these should give you a relative idea of what the Thunderclap colours look like, at least.

I have the QiYi Thunderclap and skewb, both stickerless. Just thought I'd let you know that the colour shades on the two are quite different. I can take some pictures comparing them if you want.

Where did you learn LSE? As part of a Roux tutorial?
This is amazing. Source? 
Hmm ok. I should be able to do this since I don't even use 8 seconds of my inspection anyway. I'll practice yellow cross solves once in a while. 
Wait, so it's essential to be color neutral or at least white-yellow neutral? If I got this, I would have done the shitty white cross without even glancing at the yellow side 
Hi! Do you know if Moyu plans to release any stickerless 3x3s in the future? 
Dem tips are so annoying! Solve time even depends on the number of tips you have scrambled. Hate em. Replace Pyraminx with Tetraminx, or stop scrambling tips, and I'm all for it

Oh yeah, how could I forget. Added, thanks. 
Cubeologist, cyotheking, redKB, JRcuber and crazybadcuber all produce quality cubing videos regularly.

The top speedcubers like Feliks, Kennan L., Mats, Collin, Kevin Hays, INSANEcuber (Rami Sbahi), Jay McNeill and Keaton Ellis may not be very regular, but have a lot of useful videos for various events.

Puzzle designers like OskarPuzzle (Oskar van Deventer) and Tony Fisher have active channels with a lot of really interesting videos.

superantoniovivaldi and Twisty Puzzling are channels with tutorials and reviews of really hard and unusual puzzles. 

Edit: Cubing World is a currently inactive collaborative speedcubing channel run by Noah Arthurs (/u/noahaha). It consists of tutorials by various top speedcubers pertaining to every aspect of cubing. Popular videos include Noah's BLD tutorials (arguably one of the best on youtube), Collin's F2L videos and the 'How to get fast' series for many WCA puzzles. 

Speaking of inactive channels, cyoubx is a very popular channel with unboxings, reviews and improvement guide videos. 
Very helpful, thanks!

Cat. 
A month ago, I started learning Sarah's Intermediate for skewb. After buying a Qiyi stickerless, and practising a bit I'm now sub 9.5 - ish. 
How much better can I get before learning Advanced cases? 

What are some good resources for learning how to make a better first layer? 

Also, is it worth attempting to look for the H-perm skip case? I feel this would waste some time in every solve.
The reason I always prefer stickerless cubes is that I don't want to have to deal with peeling stickers, as I really suck at restickering (plus good quality stickers aren't as cheap as I'd like them to be in  my country). I'm okay with the stickerless colours not being changeable.
Dan Brown's reaction video contains most of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJMwt3uMoTM

It's a great video, don't miss it.
The AoChuang GTS has also been announced. [Pics](http://imgur.com/a/8Nf7W)

The naming convention seems to be going out of control lately...
No stickerless again, dammit. 
I will, but only after I do another average of 100, just to make sure that I really am sub-20!
If only they had mentioned your name as well... India has 1.2 billion people, and this is the most popular newspaper. 
Thanks! 
FINALLY! SUB-20 ao100!!!

What's this 'Hi Andy' thing about? 
Dude, your look ahead is out of this world...
I've been using it for the past four days. I had an aolong v2 before. I'm getting much better times with the Thunderclap! My look ahead seems a lot better, the cube feels a lot better to hold in the hand, and I'm getting really close to sub 20. 10/10 would recommend.

Faz didn't come first. Wtf. 
I really need some tips on tensioning cubes. I got my Thunderclap a couple of days ago, and today I thought it was too tight for some reason, and messed with the tensions, and now it turns like crap :( 

What's the secret to getting nice even tensions? I can never seem to get tensions right...
Yeah, I'm going to a comp soon, and my friend has a TangPo, so I'll be able to try it out!
Wasn't there some issue with the plastic on the newer Dayans not being so good? Even with that, is it still the best?
Like totally? RIP.
I have! copy-pasting a comment of mine from down below:

>I haven't solved mine yet, but I do seem to get a lot of lock ups. That's probably more due to my inexperience with the puzzle though. It's hard to judge, but I'd say corner cutting is about 25 degrees forward, with zero reverse. Also, stock tensions are tight and uneven.

>That being said, you don't really need any corner cutting on a puzzle such as this. it's a nice solid puzzle that feels good to hold. The plastic is of super high quality, even better than the Moyu Crazy Fisher. It's about 59-60mm. I'm glad I bought this, definitely better than shelling out about $40 for the Mefferts. Looking forward to solving it, and then never scrambling it again.

Not OP, but the comp Feliks is going to [Sydney Summer 2015](http://speedcubing.com.au/SydneySummer2015/) on the 19th of December.
Did you use a converter to get those numbers? For your information, what you have there is actually 49 50. 00110001 represents 49 and 00110010 represents 50. But in the ASCII system, which computers use to store characters, the decimal numbers 0-9 are represented by the ASCII codes 48-57. So it does represent 1 2 :)
[This Twisty Puzzling video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=873btiuQKmw) shows an unboxing of the whole set, and brief explanation of how they work.
I only just started skewb. How long did take for you to get to sub-8? Also, did you find any good first layer tutorials?
Well, puzzles are actually quite inexpensive, because our local stores can buy them from China (our neighbour) easily. It's only the cubicle lubes and stickers that are a bit costly. Buying directly from thecubicle leads to heavy shipping charges.

I just ordered the thunderclap. I'll hang on to my Aolong and probably get stickers later; if any relatives living in the US visit us, they can probably bring it with them.
LOL at step 1: *If you can't figure out the first layer on your own, you might as well give up now.*
Hmm, I guess it's better to just buy a new skewb then. Qiyi stickerless looks good!

And thank you for your advice :D
Cubicle Aolong stickers resell in my country (India) for more than 70% of the price of the Thunderclap lol
Definitely not worth the price.
Guys, price aside, would a Thunderclap be an upgrade from an Aolong v2? My stickers are coming off, so since the Thunderclap is so cheap, I thought I'd get it.
... K that was stupid.
[Skewb]

Is modding my Lan Lan Skewb like in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75uBXXzyAOc) worth it?
Assuming you live in the US, you can buy something like [this](http://www.amazon.com/Universal-Mount-Smartphone-Operable-Device/dp/B00J6KO9O8).
You know you're fast when you can get a 4.62, and then just casually move on to the next solve.
He's competing next weekend. Fingers crossed!
Make sure you watch Chris Olson's video, [How to make better cubing videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ6mNtLufio)
Looks like a Weilong to me.
I've been meaning to learn as well. Apparently [this pdf](http://fmcsolves.cubing.net/fmc_tutorial_ENG.pdf) is a really good FMC tutorial.

[Skewb]

Is there a good skewb first layer tutorial that's easy to follow? I just learnt Sarah's Intermediate, and the first layer takes me ages to do.

I tried watching Jay's example solves, but I couldn't clearly follow what was going on.
Looks like you needed the /s for that one :D

(Also, are you going to the Mumbai comp or the Bangalore comp?)
Oh right. I didn't get that from your post. /u/gyroninja's answer looks  promising though.
I was thinking of a similar project a few months ago. On researching, I found that a couple of guys had already done this, and had published a blog post about it. But it is so complex and requires extensive electronics and programming skills,  and I gave up immediately.

This is a pretty old post. You might want to post this in the daily Discussion thread.
I think I'll put it  on my to buy list. It'll be fun to make patterns with it at least!
When you notice the parity, just do this: M U M U’ M’ U’ M’ 2U M U’, and then finish the last layer.

[Ah, the old reddit cube-a-roo!](
https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/3u51bq/whenever_someone_insults_trudeau_on_rcanada/cxc2g35?context=2)
The stopwatch is used by the judge (the guy in the jacket sitting in front) to make sure that the competitior doesn't exceed the maximum allowed 15 seconds of inspection time before starting the solve. 

The actual timer used by the competitor is called a stackmat timer. [This video](https://youtu.be/0xSg2HpUk94) might help you get an idea of how it works!
I do believe you completely misunderstood the question. Nvm maybe I'll post it again tomorrow. 
Volunteer scramblers who are (usually) also participants who'll be taking their turn at solving later on. 

On a side note, [this video](https://youtu.be/dPL3eV-A0ww) gives a walk-through of what a participant must do during an official competiton. 
All official competitions are 'monitored' by delegates from the [World Cube Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Cube_Association). They make sure that all of the [WCA regulations](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/) are followed strictly.

 More specifically, the guy in the jacket in front of him is the 'judge' for this set of solves. He ensures the competitor gets only 15 seconds of inspection, makes sure the puzzle is fully solved in the end (>45 degree misalignment means a +2 second penalty).

Look at it this way, anyone solving the cube officially and trying for world Record gets to do the same thing. So it's not unfair in any way. 
The cubes are scrambled by different people, part of the organising team (or volunteers)  who follow randomly generated scrambling instructions from a computer. 

It's then handed to him covered by a box, and he is allowed to inspect it for a maximum of 15 seconds before starting the solve. 
This isn't Guinness. Speedcubing records are governed by a separate body called the World Cube Association. [Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Cube_Association) 
This is true, and unavoidable for such a puzzle. However speedcubers' calibre is judged in terms of 'ao5's, or average of fives, where the competitor does five solves, and the average of the set is taken after neglecting the best and the worst solves. This nullifies the impact of luck to a large extent, because the probability of getting really lucky in consecutive solves is very low. 

The world record for ao5 on 3x3 is 6.54 seconds. You can check out the video of that here https://youtu.be/yGV0VmS52gI
Yes, the cube is scrambled according to completely random scrambling instructions generated by a computer program. Then it's handed to the competitor who gets a maximum of 15 seconds of inspection. If you're interested, drop by /r/cubers! 
Nice try spy-man
