I just don't say it, I say "I'm sorry for your loss" to mourning families instead. No need to make a big point about not saying it.
I can tell you that a movie costs around 40 shekels, and a good ol' 1.5 litre Schweppes is 7 shekels. That's about as close as you can get to the price of shmeckles. The kind of money used in the place Rick talks about when he's real drunk.
No, it's just that there's no reason not to. It helps their products be more famous, and doesn't harm their profits. There's an argument for companies to allow fangames if they're non-profits.

Exactly. Root should not be built in. It should also not be possible to obtain through exploits. It should also not be easy. It should be difficult so that no amateur does it. Only experienced users.

But that's how it's done with most OEMs like Sony, Xiaomi, HTC (I hope?), LG (outside of the US), Samsung (outside of the US)...

> I love this. In the West we have this bad habit of portraying North Koreans as these silly minions of an insane dictator.

Who does that?! I've never heard of someone think that.
> Sometime after the director released the documentary, North Korea asked the director to "come back to deal with a problem". The director refused, because he knew that would be a one-way trip to the labor camps.

That's just ridiculous, what did they expect? "Ooooo! Russian director be bad boy! Ask director come to 'deal with a problem'! Yes! Good idea! This be why me best Korea!" they're cruel, not stupid. They're embarassing themselves by even trying.

Christianity.
I usually think this is a bad idea for dying people, but in this particular case, it might be the only option - deconversion. He can't be afraid of hell if he realises one does not exist.

The other option is cherry picking some branch of Christianity where your grandfather goes to heaven (this is easier but it might not work). Obviously this throws intellectual honesty out the window, as according to the Bible he really does deserve hell, but fuck that, he's a dying person. He doesn't need intellectual honesty, he needs comfort.
Sadly, I need performance.

To be more accurate: I think plastic is the best material to make a phone out of. I do not think actual plastic phones made today are good, as they only make shitty cheap ones.

What's happening in Gaza is really sad, but Israel isn't at all interested in exterminating all Palestinians. Israel has nothing to gain by doing so, and it's human lives that we're talking about. Israel just wants Hamas to end, be replaced with someone that doesn't want to harm Israel, and then leave them to their own devices.

Apart from that complicated conflict, life here is democratic. I know, because I experience it everyday.

But you're gonna ignore me and deny it for your convenience.
Hmm. It's interesting to see how far their targeting algorithms have progressed.

I still don't care though, I'm not bothered by algorithms tracking me.
Israel.

When I joined my current job, it wasn't even a question! "What's your phone number? We'll add you to the WhatsApp group". There's a 100% participation rate. Every single person at my job is in the WhatsApp group. Same goes for my classroom in high school up to last year (I graduated in June) - for the past 4 years, there was a 100% participation rate. If someone wants to get in touch, "do you have WhatsApp?" isn't even asked. The answer is assumed to be "yes".
> GPS is so reliable on every app in iOS

I never had any GPS issues. At least not since my OnePlus One (my previous phone). 
Yeah, with me, it's a matter of where I draw the line. I draw it very, very close to "convenience".
RCS is irrelevant because waiting for carriers to implement something is like waiting for yourself to win the lottery: not gonna happen.

WhatsApp, however, is a different story.
Blocked him again
> I'm also not saying that people need to do what I do either.  It's just that I know people are SO uninformed about the choices they are making when downloading "that" app and ignoring permissions, joining "that" new social media website, sending personal credit card information over Facebook or Gmail, the list goes on.

So just so you know, it's not like that with everyone.

I don't take any security measures on purpose. My messaging is done through WhatsApp solely due to convenience. I'm on the latest security update available because I like updating and getting all of the newest features. I usually ignore permissions because I'm not scared about much leaking other than my personal details such as my debit card number, ID, or passport details.

It's not that I'm not well informed. I am. I know I'm being watched by algorithms constantly. I already ignore ads though, so what difference does them being targeted towards me makes?
Well, you wouldn't get me to uninstall WhatsApp. Everyone I know uses it, and I really do mean everyone, in addition to everyone I don't know, people here and all over Europe just assume that you have it installed.

SMS is completely obsolete.

As for the fact that they're owned by Facebook, or security... I don't care. If I cared I'd switch to something not owned by Facebook, but I don't.
> Live in a country where SMS still isn't obsolete, so yes to stock SMS app

I'm so sorry to hear.
Hangouts has its own, non SMS messaging, you know.
Hangouts.

Fuck RCS and fuck carriers.

You know what'd be really funny? If she said "so?" - as in, if she was one of those people who don't even know what alcohol actually is.
Wait wait for violence? Take the proactive approach
Which is why I was saying this workaround
That's not what I meant.

I'm IN the middle east (geographically), I know there are advanced countries here, I'm in one of them. It's just that Israel is the only democracy in the area. Yes you'll have infrastructure in most of the countries here, you'll have food and water, but I'm not referring to that. I'm referring to personal freedoms. In Israel, you're free to do anything you want to, within a democratic system of rules. It's basically equivalent to Europe's personal freedoms (other than crossing borders since nothing's farther from a Schengen area, than the middle east). In the surrounding countries, not including certain areas like most of Syria, Gaza, or Iraq, life is not physically difficult. The first step of the pyramid of needs is filled, and probably the second one too. You have food, water, air, you're not under attack (again, I know it's not like that - I walk around streets and roads in the middle east every single day)... But what you don't get is freedom to believe in whatever you want. Publicly. Publicly announce you're an atheist in Israel, and you'll still be perfectly safe. No one will seriously even consider sentencing you, because you haven't gone against the law. Often, if a woman gets raped in the surrounding countries, there's not much she can do. In Israel she can go to the police and get that sucker in jail.

This isn't the case in the surrounding countries. This is what I mean.
I just had one yesterday 😉
Takebeer!
Ah, yeah, I guess.
That's another definition I guess, but I think it's more what I said.
No, no, not freier. It's fraier. It's a lot like "fryer" in pronounciation.
So THAT'S why some Muslims die even though they pray! The prayer lag! Got it.
This is a beam of prayer, not electromagnetic radiation. Who said it has to travel straight and not be affected by gravity?
It's nice if they don't, but I don't think they can be blamed if they disrespect. The parents should be blamed instead because they're forcing them to go.
I wish you were right and relevant, but sadly, you're not. Many people here CAN'T move on. At least not yet. They're stuck in a certain position in life/location on earth.
> If you hate the mosque so much, why even go to one?

Many people are forced. I was forced to go to synagogue in the past. Doing this is justified if you don't choose to go there, because what other option do you have? Not going isn't an option if you're forced.
Nice t shirt!
Often, emancipation is an option. Especially if her parents beat her.
They beat you? Well guess what? You can go to the police! Report them, and eventually have a wonderful life.

I was 15 and frustrated too, but time passes, things will improve 😊
That sounds amazing! Good luck!
Better than an extremist Muslim ready to explode.

Sure, it's replacing one brand of bullshit with another, but it's a much less bad brand.

Ah yes, I did the same once with some Jewish religious thing. I don't remember what it was exactly, but I just wrote the word down on a piece of paper and read it.
Then make root beers, find a way to drop all the sugar out of solution, cook the sugar to form ethanol, and put back until the beer has a concentration of ~4% ethanol.

"What is this?!" "Beer." "With ALCOHOL?!" "Umm, yeah, you said natural alcohol is fine, when you cook sugar, so I made sure all of the alcohol here comes from cooked sugar. Wanna give it a try?"
Logically, Muslims should be completely reckless on the way back from hajj, in hopes they might die. Like, drive super tired without seatbelts and drive near a cliff - while making sure you're as distracted as possible. This way you're nearly guaranteed to die while technically you haven't committed suicide and can therefore go to heaven.
It wasn't. It doesn't have to.
Tell her the formula for both - the exact same thing.
Oh, no, he's not trying to gamble, he's trying to give them the worst life. The middle east will achieve that goal.
That's still shitty (not shitty of the tech support, shitty of the company in general)
Already is happening outside of the US 😉

Many people buy phones from electronics stores, not carriers.
It's a joke
My carrier, Partner IL doesn't support RCS. No carrier here supports RCS, and plenty of other carriers in other countries don't support RCS. And even some that do don't implement it properly.

Using third party apps allows you to say "fuck you" to carriers and not wait for them.
Well, luckily for you he's from a country where there's a carrier that bothered to implement it.

It's a matter of luck, though.
And even if they did, if it's not like they could do anything about it.
As someone who works for tech support (ISP, not carrier, but close enough), what did you expect them to do? Make a company-wide change and adopt a new communication protocol during a phone call with a minimum wage (yes that's my salary) worker who just happens to know some techy things?

I've received lots of ridiculous calls, but never someone who expected me to adopt and implement a brand new service for them that didn't exist in the company's systems before. That's on another level. You need to get to the higher up people through other means, not calling tech support. 
And in many others, it's 0.
Sure, but it's nowhere near the joy of WhatsApp, where anyone can use it as long as their hardware supports it, and they don't need to wait for anyone to do anything specific besides getting an internet connection. You didn't mention any carriers in so many countries...

I mean, moving from WhatsApp to RCS would separate us instead of making us more closely connected, as we wouldn't be able to freely communicate with each other, only a few select carriers from big countries.
VPNs, and net neutrality in countries that have it (many, including mine).

That depends on the carrier though. If the carrier wants to be a dipshit, they can. And there's still the issue of waiting for carriers to support something. That's going to be one indefinitely long wait.
Oh, I see. That does make some sense. If I had ANY artistic skill and wanted to make a comic about Estonia, I wouldn't have any idea of how to properly distort English in an Estonian way. I think I'd consult an Estonian for that though, I'm a perfectionist about certain things.
In other words they won't work because of carriers.
> (although Apple would have to comply with a warrant for those data if requested). 

But they can and do make themselves mathematically unable to do so.
I'm slamming it for relying on the carriers.

Those incompetent assholes. All I need is an internet line.
That's not much...
Yeah that's the reason.
[There's a very simple solution to all this.](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Android+device+manager)
That is such a good sentence. A sentence to live by.
Is the Pixel 2 common in Estonia? I like how that's the UI op made up.
Basically Egypt made up 0 (because Arabs "invented" 0) to get all the oil and not pay anything. That's the joke.

After I move to Australia I think I'll go to the Agalot, pretend I don't know Hebrew, and check if that trick is still utilised in some form.
Because declaring a higher price and having it taken down afterwards fits this geographical area.
Bibi is the father. The one that probably spanks strippers/prostitutes is his son, Yair.
He did end up a fraier, which is like, the worst thing possible to an Israeli (it's a personality type of someone who gets ripped off, but possibly willingly... Hard to translate)
Oh right, gotcha.
Ah. The location of Gaza confused me - you placed it next to Eilat instead of between the centre district and the southern one.
Also, since it requires carrier support, it simply won't be implemented because carriers are incompetent. Also, if it does, it'll be charged extra, and probably be shitty and half-baked on most carriers other than some specialised super expensive carrier.
> It's all IP based, so international fees are about as relevant as international WhatsApp fees.

I'm well aware but that also applies to texts and calls nowadays. Doesn't mean they can't bill that.

> Secondly, that's great you are in Europe and locked into that 3rd party app.

Actually I'm not in Europe, but I guess Israel is equivalent to Europe in that regard so I'll let it pass. I'd rather be locked into an app than locked into a carrier's whims. Carriers suck as anything beyond an internet line.

> RCS will be a boon to countries like the US which has been stuck in SMS hell.

The thing is, with the speed carriers change shit that isn't advertiseable, you'll be stuck in SMS hell for ages.
Oh.

Well, still, there's a waiting for carriers matter, and... That only applies to certain carriers. This is a patch. Third party services are a full-on solution.
Fuck yeah it was good
That's so Canadian of you to say.

Can you say "how aboot maple and Poutine, eh?" next?
🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 please don't remind me of that, I'm finally done with Passovers since I'll move to Australia later this year
Female professor? That makes no sense.
More like Mangal. Falafel is for the rest of the year. Independence day is the time for a good Mangal.

Venismecha!
#Next year in Australia (for me) 😉
##שש don't show them our קוד סודי!
No, because it's not implemented anywhere yet. Carriers are slooooooow... Why bother waiting when you can take matters into your own hands with a third party service?
Oh. That's really stupid then. Nothing's stopping Americans from moving on and joining the rest of the world.


I bet you still pay for international texts, just like we do. Also, at some point, you guys will grow sick of the limitations of SMS (I'm ignoring RCS because waiting for all carriers to implement it is useless, it'll take years. Much more than just mere years) and start using third party services.
Yeah, I'm sure that just like I wrote about Israelis, most Palestinians aren't interested in harming Israel, because they have other issues in life, internal issues. Say, the PA's corruption, or living under Hamas' rule, or just making a living.

I wish it was possible to make use of this knowledge to make peace and have everyone living their lives instead of most people.
Everyone lies. Both sides do.

I assume that Israel lies about some things, but on the other hand, living here, I know a bunch of stuff that's definitely real due to personal experience. This is a free country and most Israelis don't actually want Palestinians to die, like most people of the world, they're more interested in internal things that have nothing to do with Palestinians. The threat of a religious takeover, the low salaries and very high costs of living, which beach they should go to tomorrow, how to get their Ethiopian friend in the club with them, which falafel is the best in the area...

Israelis are for the most part just regular people with regular people issues. Is Israel ready for peace? Idk, but it will be ready when it actually becomes a viable option. It happened before (and ended with Yitzhak Rabin's murder), and it'll happen again at some point.
> Palestinians want Israel to die,

Well, they probably do, due to misinformation, after all, Hamas is a terrorist organisation with a rule of terror. I'm not saying Palestinians are inherently bad (they are fellow falafel worshippers, there has to be good in them!), but I don't think you'll get far in Gaza if you start saying "instead of trying to harm Israel, stop, it's futile, and try to improve your miserable situation inside Gaza! Down with Hamas! Form a revolution that'll lead to a proper, non corrupt democracy!". I hope one day it'll sink in that trying to hurt Israel is futile, and they'll start working on their internal issues, but Hamas will certainly try to prevent that.
I genuinely have no idea what the 8 ball is meant to represent.

I think [this video](https://youtu.be/DxphJ-dnX2Y) of Film Theory is a really good general guide to making edgy jokes. You can joke about **anything**, but pick the right time, way, and place to do so.
But we say Polin... Not Polan. Polan means absolutely nothing in Hebrew...

I don't get why it stuck that Israel says "Polan" in its distorted English (Inglish if you wanna distort THAT)... It always was and still is "Polin".
Just do what I do - ignore the area and leave it alone. Why bother with all these geopolitics just for an insignificant piece of land? I ignore it and let everyone else who cares worry about it.
There's not much else to say. It's really boring. I'm from there. Believe me, it's very, very boring.
> * The West Bank is not a district of Israel. Its spherical shape is a cause of great instability for the region.

Oh damn you opened a serious Pandora's box. Say that in the middle of Israel (apart from Tel Aviv) and get ready for a bombardm of debates and very passionate people telling you you're wrong.

As for me? I don't really care. I'll go with whatever anyone says for that one time, and stay away because I have no reason to go there.
Where's the Negev? You're missing the whole Negev... Gaza isn't at the southernmost tip.
That's exactly what the situation is everywhere but in the USA. Carrier based texting is dead. International communications cost extra, messages beyond a certain quota cost extra per message, and certain carriers support certain services and others don't. And they ALL lag far behind the new GSM standards, plus their implementations can be less than optimal. With external, internet-based services, however, internet is internet. It doesn't matter where you get it from. You can get it from a totally obscure virtual carrier surfing on a slightly less obscure carriers' antennae. Regarding what's available, it'll be **exactly** the same stuff as millionaire pulling fibre optics up his ass or something. Yes, the speed and latency will not be the same, but the same exact content will be available.

I think that's an important value.

Plus all of the other reasons carrier services are shit.
That carriers can bill it?

You might not notice it because I heard you utilise carrier services in the USA because of your tiny data plans, instead of using it purely as an internet provider. We're pretty close in Israel. Nowadays carriers are purely for calls and internet. Nothing else matters.
> Except through data usage.

Okay? So? How small are data plans in the USA for this to matter? 3GB? That's still enough for unlimited text messaging.

> It's still not certain if RCS will be billed any differently than text/mms, which is virtually free in the US.

The thing is, there's a whole world aside from the USA. International text messages costs a bunch of money for each message, the pricing of which is ridiculously complicated with charts and specialised international contact plans that get you discounted rates to specific countries for vartian frequencies of texts, and you only get a few thousand free domestic texts. Enough for phone number verifications, sure, but not for regular usage. Plus, waiting for your carrier to implement ANYTHING that can't be easily advertised (so, not including 3G/4G and soon 5G) is an excercise in futility. If you use an external service, you don't need to wait for your carrier, and just use it basically as a mobile ISP. Just a simple internet line which you then do whatever you want with, like calls, video calls, and texts, anywhere, for free. And you can go with the cheapest carrier you can find, because it really doesn't matter which services they offer. All that matters is that they provide an internet connection. Carrier billability complicates everything so much... And texts have nearly no impact on data plans because they're just texts.

Idk about you Americans, but to the rest of the world, the less the carriers are involved, the better. Sometimes we do WhatsApp calls because we're not sure if that person went overseas. Sometimes we do WhatsApp calls because that's the easiest button while texting. It's just voice, no big deal, and our data plans can handle it no problem (plus there's wifi)
Oh, I see. Well, never been to the USA and my plans don't involve it anytime soon, but I can tell you you missed an awesome independence day (then again, I'll miss one on July 4th)
Absolutely, but that doesn't mean it can't work. This is not a native English speaking country, it can make such mistakes, plus, maybe Israel meant that non Jews in general are capable of doing it, rather than saying that Poland specifically as a non Jew is capable of doing it?
SWITZERLAND

How can you talk about Jewish money going somewhere without mentioning Switzerland 🤔
Shhhh! Don't tell Poland that, it's in denial
Finally! Someone makes Israel say "Polin" and not "Polan"! if you're gonna distort English on purpose, then do it properly!
With tentacles? I mean, Japan in a costume has to have tentacles. Italian calamari perhaps?
If it's any consolation, I thought the same.

And then I realised I was overthinking it.
*burp* W... We are all sophisticated and n...never humourous or cyn...nical. *burp*
Still, shit happened. There's no country that was founded without conflict, so far. Whether the country's good or bad, someone suffered when it was founded. This applies to South Korea, North Korea, Israel, the USA (especially), Australia, Switzerland, Sweden, Iran, Iraq, Italy, Germany... Israel's just a country among all the rest. I'm not saying Israel doesn't have a right to exist, but 1948 wasn't all happy for everyone (in the area. Obviously the separation of Korea into North and South Korea which happened in the same exact year is a different story which is also very complicated).

Did I miss the Mangal? No! I did a Mangal with my family and I enjoyed it like most Israelis! Did I miss the fireworks of the night before? Well, yes, but only because I was busy rooting my phone and making it independent from PCs (I feel like it was appropriate for independence day). Acknowledging that the Palestinians have had hardships doesn't equate to hating Israel or abstaining from Yom Haatzmaut. You can still have fun.

And I'm obviously not denying the holocaust or anything like that. Just have fun and don't ignore other people's suffering.

Why do you focus on marriage more than children though? Marriage involves two adults. Children involves a whole new, dependent being. Issues between the two as parents are far worse than issues as husband and wife.

> Plenty of Catholics have had wonderful and strong marriages with non-Catholics. 

That's what I meant, some decide to partially circumvent but technically still follow Catholic doctrines, turning out to be fine parents.
> I don't think 'demographics is destiny' - the Haskalah movement changed a population that was previously very religious to very secular in not a very long period. However, I do think Israel is going to struggle with a mass of people who are uneducated and ignorant about how the world functions.

The thing is, orthodoxy is aware of the enlightenment, and does all it can to hold back enlightenment, modernization, or at the very least secularism/a decrease in religiousity. My grandmother says it's been happening for a while now, and she notices the difference and finds it worrying and saddening (as in - she's against orthodoxy closing in and isolating itself in an attempt to prevent progress). She's over 80, from Jerusalem. "Religious people used to just be people, back then, not mindless religious drones" (my translation to English here was somewhat loose, as I don't remember her wording very well. She wouldn't say drones. She's a total technophobe). Religious people used to be very friendly towards her. Now, they ignore her because she's not "modest" enough or religious enough or doesn't invest herself that much into religion.

I think that there will be a struggle between חזרה בשאלה and religious births. One will surpass the other. Either Israel becomes a religious hellhole or the ultra orthodox lose their power eventually and stupid religious regulations get cancelled, leading to a proper separation of religion and state. I'm not staying here to find out who wins. I'll move somewhere where secularism has already won.

> I'm curious if you have a perspective on this - I know that ending military draft exemptions has become a hot button issue,

Actually, I don't mind the military draft exemptions at all. I think the army, in today's battlefields and with 2018 weapons, will do just fine without a draft at all. Give people actual salaries, fitting for a workplace, offer the same opportunities they already do (unique job experience that can later make for an impressive CV), and the army will, while having way less soldiers, still have more than enough *productive soldiers*. The ones that'll leave are the ones that are now useless to the army and waste its resources which would be better spent somewhere else.

> I think education and sustainable population growth is much more threatening. While they're still 10% of the population, they can get government handouts for a coalition agreement in the Knesset.

Absolutely, and it really worries me. More and more religious bullshit is slowly finding its way into the law, it seems.

> However as they grow, these handouts will become unsustainable. Ultimately, I think the endgame is that Israel's secular Jewish middle-class ('Medinat Tel Aviv') will have to choose between a coalition agreement with the religious (whose demands will be untenable) or the Joint List - and eventually they will choose the Joint List.

I agree, the only thing I'm not sure of, is whether it would be too late for the Jewish middle class to make that choice at all, or not.

> I don't live there, but this is the direction I see things going - the spiralling out of control Charedi population, their lack of education and reliance on handouts, and the setup of coalition agreements in Israel points towards a fundamental shift in the next 20 years. You do live there - what do you think?

Idk about the time period, I see too many conflicting signs to say something like "20 years", but yes, I see some fundamental shift regarding religion here occuring. Some signs show it's already starting, but others show it's still coming. It's hard to tell. However, the secular middle class is recently making a few attempts to resurge and fight back, so the secular front is being set up for this struggle between the two shifts.

No, tell me! Haha
That's a good start, take beer! (Takbir, but the ex Muslim version of it)
But, bot, what if I have allotted something important to someone? Can't I alot another thing to someone else? 😏
Not ex Muslim, I'm actually an ex Jew, but I just wanted to mention that even if they're from the middle east (some people here are), many have immigrated to Europe, so even if they're from countries where it's illegal to leave Islam, most are now in countries where it's totally legal to do so.
Well, until the S9 which has Treble and therefore supports GSIs, that was true. Now it's not - now you *can* flash a GSI and have a gapps-less setup. Whether you should or not is already a matter of opinion (no).
Well, their metaphor is really shitty.

This sentence is simply what more or less any religion says but with "study Torah" instead of "worship X", so despite how much better the Goyim they think they are, they're exactly like everyone else (which is also what I really think).
Well that's really stupid of them. It doesn't matter if it should be avoided or not, my taste would be the same regardless of that factor. I'd still not enjoy classical music even if it kept your lungs and ears at a perfect condition. I might listen to some, as a form of medical treatment, but I wouldn't enjoy it, just like an operation in the hospital isn't fun. Even if punk music made you feel like you're being stabbed to death, if I liked punk music, I'd still like punk music. I probably wouldn't listen to it, but I'd want to.

So if there were no bad effects or good effects in heaven because it's a good place, I'd just want to go to a punk concert. If I was sent to a classical music concert, I wouldn't enjoy it.
😂😂😂😂 how ridiculous! This is messed up on so many levels.
I kinda doubt she was taught what she thinks. I think she did some wishy washy stuff to orthodoxy and ignores what their actual authorities say.
> He gets the ultimate punishment, which is eternity in a void where there is no god. 

So basically reality - there's nothing after death? Sounds about right.
With flashing ROMs, obviously.

Yes, you won't take advantage of these that way. Yes there are cheaper alternatives, and this is not at all what I'm trying to do. Some people want that though, specifically on a Pixel. Go figure. I'll stick with gapps. Collect all my data. I honestly don't care. I'm not against others trying to fight it, I wish these people good luck, I'm just not going to join their efforts because I honestly don't mind being observed by an algorithm.
If you're measuring NEW Jews this way then you're doing it wrong. These people are so messed up that they're only trying to convert irreligious Jews - they dont believe that non Jews are "worthy" of their time. That means that their goal isn't to have more Jews, it's to have more religious orthodox Jews, out of the total Jewish population.

The way you measure their success is not by the number of Jews over time, or their ratio to the total population, but by the number of orthodox practicing religious Jews, and their ratio over Jews overall. Success is a subjective thing - how well is a thing achieving its goal. Therefore you measure the success of the baal tshuva movement based on their goals.

It might not be much more indicative of any effectiveness, I hope it's not, I want these baal tshuva organisations to fail, and for Judaism to slowly die off without any people being harmed, fading into history. No longer relevant, but not forgotten, or murdered to extinction.
Okay, good.
> according to Jewish law

And since when does that have any authority? Jewish law sees me as Jewish, but I don't. I don't accept any authority from Jewish law.
Oh, oops.
That does NOT sound fun. Why not wrap your phone in tinfoil and disable all radios? You'll get the same result.

I mean obviously you're allowed to, it just sounds like much more of an effort than not using smartphones, for very little functionality.
It's possible to just have a gapps-less setup.
Updates

Beyond that I honestly don't really care. 

I'm not saying my phone's not vulnerable, it totally is, I just don't mind it that much.
Idk if it is or not, that's why I'm using question marks. That's what I understood from the text, but it isn't clear.
Honestly, I'm totally on to the Treble hype train.

I mean, GSIs? Aaaahhhhhh 😍😍😍😍😍 I never thought I'd see the day when Android GSIs become a thing!

Yes but they're technically in Asia.
I made two mostly unrelated statements.
I'm pretty sure the Egyptian variant is made using ful and not chickpeas like the Israeli variant. Idk what about the Jordanian variant, it might be the same.
Haha yeah right?
It's funny to see it served on a plate with tahina in a dip bowl 😂 so fancy and unusual for falafel 😂 (I do love falafel btw, don't get me wrong, it's just usually stuffed in a pita with a bunch of other stuff, but I can see it being tasty this way)
Oh my, I am SO glad I have 0 allergies. I can have a mixture of milk, gluten-rich bread with peanuts, sesame, nuts, and a bunch of other allergens.
I'm not American, but we get that (much less often) in Israel too. I don't find it silly, I find it unfair. Why should we be so restricted for a very small minority in a place where we must go, we didn't choose to go to school, and it's possible to figure out a non disruptive solution for them - only have one school in each area with people that have peanut allergies (that go beyond mere touch), leaving the other schools free to allow peanuts.
I'm in Asia and when someone says Asia, I also think of these countries.

Also, since the language we're talking about is English, what matters is what Americans, British people, Australians, New Zealanders, and South Africans think. Your meaning of Asia is an edge-case resulting from you speaking another language where the translation for "Asia" refers to something else. Not exactly relevant to English, it's more relevant to your native tongue.
India? Mmmm... If you say Asia I *might* think of India.

Definitely not Iran, Iraq, Israel, the Stans, or Turkey. Mostly China, Japan, the Koreas, Indonesia, and the Philippines.
Well then. There was one exception, apparently.

I guess Hiroshi wanted to throw us off, and by "us" I mean those of us who figured out that hints are red herrings - he realised he needs to give a real hint, among a bunch of fake ones at the same time, to confuse us.
Any Oreo references I can think of happened after the name reveal, except for the announcement of when it's going to happen - during the solar eclipse - black (eclipse skies) covered by white (the sun), covered by black (the moon), which was very, very vague, and, well, was the name reveal.
Oh, so "schlissel" means key in German?
Well, until I move out, I'm in Israel, so since I speak Hebrew with a native, non Arab accent (and am native), people assume I'm Jewish.

Once I do move out, I doubt anyone would detect my Jewish origins or my Israeliness, I don't fit here very well, and so far, no one detected me as Israeli/from a Jewish background unless I gave some clues like speaking Hebrew or being shocked and confused by rain in July (overseas only, of course) (wtf?! Rain... In July?!). People just assume I'm mid/eastern European, unless they see how I don't burn easily despite my white skin, but that's not very noticeable because people usually don't know how long I've been exposed to the sun for.
No pressure, I mean, it's not like she's pregnant or anything, but those are things you two should figure out at some point, to prevent issues in the long run.

Obviously, 0 judgement for you dating a non Jew, I mean, I probably will, too, Judaism will not play a factor at who I date, at all, but religiousity (the lack thereof), will.
What's a schlissel? The only one I know is that crazy guy that murdered a participant of the Jerusalem Pride Parade.
The question is, does she feel guilty about you not converting? I mean, you don't want her to share her life with someone who always makes her feel guilty, right, and the **only** reason she doesn't constantly push you to convert is that she's a really nice person, and not that she genuinely doesn't mind you not converting.

I've heard of people like that which just hid those feelings for years.
Well... Idk that I'd want to marry her, I'm not interested in religious people, be it Judaism, or Christianity, but I'm sure she's a great person and you made a wonderful choice, so good for you!

Don't let your parents make you feel bad. You're with who you want to be, she's with who she wants to be with, and that's what matters. Have a wonderful life, and don't let your parents stop you.

Regarding children, however, do consider the fact that she's a practicing Catholic, and the Catholic church encourages raising the children as devout Catholics. I'm not saying Judaism's any better, don't get me wrong, but it's religion, again. Do you really want to push upon your children the same thing you left, just with a different flavour? If not, talk to her about this subject, now, before you have children. It's important. She might be totally fine and keep her religion to herself, but that's something you should discuss with her.
You need to balance the two.

No, I work for a company that provides internet by renting infrastructures from a rival company which is legally required to offer its infrastructure to other companies for rent. It's in their best interest to give the rival company the worst infrastructure service, so we get a lot of errors and few technicians, which sometimes wreck infrastructure instead of fixing it. And then we - the minimum wage tech support agents, need to deal with angry customers. And Israelis are known to be pushy and rude when angry. It's not in the USA.

Also, I work for tech support, not for customer service. I don't deal with payments and billings in any way. I also luckily don't need to preserve customers in any way. No matter how many customers leave - first of all, my tech support department never ever disconnects customers, and second of all, I'm not measured by how many customers disconnect after talking to me.
I was agreeing with you
I wish I worked in IT... That sounds so fun!

I thought tech support would be similar, but it's not 😭 it's most getting screamed at for things that are out of your control, trying to convince 80 year olds to do as I say with their routers and computers, and calming angry people down...

That's up for debate. I've never ever seen any hints in the DP easter eggs.

I hope it's just a coincidence.
I'm not going to make any attempts to force it upon anyone, but yes, I want Egypt to join the secularised west in terms of rights, freedoms, and rules. Within those laws, traditions and customs can exist. I want that to happen because I think society as a whole is happier this way, and my goal as a secular person is to maximise overall happiness.

I mean, it's similar to any moderate Muslim that ever tried to convert others in non violent means. Only their motives are either brownie points that they believe will make them reach higher heavens after they die, or they believe these people will go to hell and want to prevent it, or a belief that people will be happier this way (from my experience it's mostly the former two)...
There's still a chance 😏
No, now you just got proof that you were wrong. Google's hints are red herrings. Google hinted milkshakes, but never marshmallows (until the name reveal, obviously). Google hinted Nutella, but never Nougat (until the name reveal, again). Google also never hinted Oreo (until the name reveal). By this point you should know that they're always red herrings.
I hope it'll be peppermint! Google's hints are red herrings. As long as Google does NOT hint that it's Peppermint, it might still be the name.
Idk why, but this wallpaper is proof it was never on the table - Google's hints are red herrings.
Ikr? Every single time they hinted, it was a red herring.

Take for example the picture of a Milkshake on Android wear, or the Nutella references Hiroshi made on twitter.
Even if it can be done privately in practice, it's still not legally allowed. If you're not against it privately, then would you support it becoming legal in private in Egypt?

> it is STILL not okay for unmarried couples to stay together or engage in pre-marital sex?

I'm aware. When I went to Eilat (I'm from Israel), I was thinking of going for a quick visit in Ta'ba, but one of the reasons I decided against it (besides me wanting to go back to the centre) was fear. My way of life probably goes against some Egyptian laws, and while I'm sure they're not really enforced, especially not in Ta'ba, I'd rather be safe than sorry. Especially considering what I've heard about Egyptian prisons. Here, my way of life is fully legal. I'm somewhat upset that the two things you mentioned are still not allowed in Egypt. That doesn't mean I'm not for other things. I want both living together, non-marital sex (not pre, since marriage isn't legally required at all), and homosexuality to be legal in Egypt. I'm not doing any of these btw. I'm single, I have always been single, I haven't slept with anyone ever, and I'm not attracted to men, only to women.

It doesn't make sense that they'll gain acknowledgement and legal recognition before hetero sex is fully allowed (with consent only), but it doesn't mean that I don't think they should strive towards it.

It's like I don't see Israel fully separating religion from politics anytime soon, but I still think the efforts to make it happen are great. 
That's even more beautiful! 😍😍😍
Woah 😍 pictures of Australia always make me excited to move over!
Congratulations!

Feel free to live a clean life, and as horrible as your father sounds - there's one good thing he told you: take some time, and after time passes, you can (if you want to!) get back in touch and start discussions.

Going back should not be one of the options no matter what. Regarding seeing them, the most you should accept (again, only if you want!) is visiting them somewhere neutral, say, at a public place near them, but do not go into their house. Not even for a visit. Again, only go that far if you're actually willing.

You have no obligation to your parents, they are the ones that chose to give birth to you, dealing with how they feel about your choices in life is their problem, as sad as it is to say.

Don't approve, but that doesn't mean you should support prosecution for these people that harm no one.
When something isn't allowed, people feel very compelled to consume it exactly because it's forbidden (forbidden in the sense that there's a taboo about it). I live in Israel, and here, where alcohol is fully allowed over 18 (as long as you don't drive), many people consume alcohol moderately. Yes, some get hammered, but that'll happen either way. If you wanna minimise that, allow alcohol. This way you take out the rebellion part out of getting hammered, and less people will want to.
As much as I'd want Egypt to be like us, your northern neighbours, where atheists are talking freely on mainstream media, it's not.

Whatever happens if you don't leave, can't be good. I don't want this to happen to you, so yes, you should leave. I get that you want to help Egypt, but do it from outside, as an Egyptian living abroad. Don't do it from within... You will be silenced, sadly.
Right, but going forward...

If I ever stumble upon a pre-holo app that does something unique I need, I want to get it. Not from the play store, absolutely, but I want the APK to install and have the app working to the best of its ability. I understand that it's not perfect, but I want whatever's possible to work.
Or rather, you're legally entitled to warranty coverage. You can easily be denied it because the companies know you won't retaliate. Why would you? You'll spend way more money suing them than you would fixing whatever that is.
That doesn't apply to smartphones though. We purchase the actual device. We don't lease it.
So... Dozens of people? They won't even make a dent.

Aw shit they had to ruin it, didn't they? Now we'll need custom ROMs to remove that limitation.

My Android TV box uses CEC to turn the TV on and off...
I get why, but they should adapt the apps to work properly with the new API. It needs some reworking, sure, but it's not impossible.
I love this policy. I also love that it's only a play store policy and not a package installer restriction. There needs to be a place for apps targeting old API levels on purpose. That's the right way to handle it.
Right, but they measure that using certain apps, and I don't know if the sample size is large enough to be accurate. 6 charge cycles?
Although... Chrome OS tablets might be the right way to go.

I can't trust these. I see these as marketing materials.
Yes, but that was in 2012. I had a 4th gen iPod Touch. Android, while slow and laggy at the time, did feel like it was made right. 

Today laginess and slowness shouldn't concern you as long as you buy a good phone. Android is very fast.
Yes, I know, but doesn't that mean "except for the 7 Plus"? I mean, otherwise, why would they say that it has an unlockable bootloader?
I've been to the Negev in the summer. It's not hot, but I wouldn't call it cold as fuck.
They're not fucknuts.

It's just circumcision. For some reason - **that** is still an issue. They have abandoned the ancient, horrible ways Judaism had on other issues, now they're highly prosperous, skilled people, but still totally backwards when it comes to circumcision. Just that.

That is starting to slowly change. I'm hearing of people that are Jewish but don't support circumcision. Their numbers are growing and it's becoming less and less of a taboo in Israel.
As a matter of semantics, you can choose to not call these people Muslim if you so wish because they're going against Islam. Since this is religion we're talking about, hypocrisy doesn't make me not consider it the same religion - hypocrisy is basically built in when it comes to religion.

That you shouldn't buy it in the US. The fingerprint sensor is disabled there due to some contractual thing. As a non American I can say it works great.

I'd get your concern with a Samsung or LG device and would recommend you to stay away from Xiaomis unless you're gonna flash them, but Sony phones are basically stock.
Are you sure this is written in 2018? This looks like an article from 2010 or something. What's next? "The email is replacing traditional mails!"?
No because omnipotence is infinite power. When we're talking about infinite power, all things are equally easy to do - infinitely low difficulty. Practically (but not mathematically) 0. 

However that is still a stupid move, or if Allah is considered omniscient, an evil move. Stupid because regardless of ease (which doesn't exist with omnipotence), Allah's supposed goal isn't fully reached with everyone this way, whereas it would be reached the other way, or evil because if Allah knows better but doesn't do better and knowingly doesn't prevent people from going to hell for that he's evil.

Of course, all of that assumes that Allah exists which isn't true.
I totally get "vagina blood ew". I'm hetero and if I had to deal with vagina blood in any way I'd faint. had I been female, I'd faint every month constantly for several days. I don't know how I'd function if I wasn't male.

> repudiating the core doctrines of Islam.

Whether not being a shithead repudiates the core doctrines of Islam is a matter of how you see it. That father doesn't see it this way. Is it compliant with Islam's core ideas? No. Does that person call it Islam? Yes.
That's already a matter of semantics. He self identifies as Muslim, that's for sure.
Or he's a non practicing Muslim. Or he is practicing but picks and chooses only the good bits.
To that person: tone down your idiocy and focus on your English.

Without her consent? Only one consent should matter: the child's. No other consent is relevant.
Sadly, I am worried about Jewish guilt stopping this from happening. Hopefully this isn't as big of a deal to the Jews of Europe as it is to Jews in Israel. In Israel, even nonreligious Jews that freely eat pork and date non Jews, tend to care about circumcision. Not all, but many. But maybe in Europe Jews don't care about it as much. I'm still worried about the prime minister (Benjamin Netanyahu) using Jewish guilt like he did so many times in the past... That shitty person. The holocaust shouldn't be used as a political tool to further one's political agenda. It should only be used to prevent holocausts. I avoid making the argument of "where was this god in the holocaust? Absent? Doesn't seem like the Jewish people recieved much care from a god, on the other hand, Jews are also highly prosperous, so it's not like there's a god working against Jews... It's almost like there's no god at all!" to people because I don't think it's okay to use the holocaust like that.
Cold?
I thought that like Sweden (and also Israel actually, though for totally different reasons), everything in Denmark is also in English (in addition to Swedish).
Use self defence exactly for the purpose you mentioned: self defence. If your father tries to attack you, neutralize him. However, do whatever you can to prevent harm. The goal is not to take revenge, your revenge will be you living your life comfortably in an unislamic way. Good luck doing so!
I thought that when they said the Nokia 7 plus comes with an unlockable bootloader, it means that it can be done through fastboot, unlike other Nokias.
Greek though? No one country owns it, but it originated from a certain area.
Which is EXACTLY what's keeping me from rooting.

That can't be done on the XZ Premium.
The XZ Premium didn't recieve an update first since Oreo.
What's wrong with accessing fastboot?
Whereas in Israel they're not allowed to but still do.
Because I love Sony phones and there wasn't a better alternative to me at the time. Also, it's still POSSIBLE to unlock the bootloader, even if you lose the DRM keys.

As much as I'd love to have phones which can be fully unlocked without losing the warranty, we're a minority and won't be accounted for. We need to make do with what we get.
A shop where you wanna exercise your warranty, would though
I don't think that the X has a compatible display...
Not unless treble is adapted to this phone and saves the day.
Or they (Devs) could implement Treble like they've done for a Xiaomi device. I'm sure it's relatively easy to repartition the phone, make /vendor, and clone the /vendor partition from an XZ1. Any modifications to it and to other things would likely be minimal compared to most phones.
And not the XZ Premium
Sure, but we're not willing to deal with the threat of data loss.
My main concern is having another device. Anyway, building a game library, the costs would stack up rather quickly. Mario Oddysey, Zelda Breath Of The Wild, and Rocket League alone would push me over 100 dollars.
Which rack holds 10,000 drives? No rack. Also, that's still not an Exadrive. That'd be a petadrive.
$50 is still a lot of money... $10-20 seems reasonable, but 50?
And pay THAT much for games? Don't get me wrong, I'm willing to pay, but that $70?
Okay, sorry, yeah, but you get my point, it fully applies to Germany, Austria, and most of Europe, which is usually considered Western.

Again, that's fine, but then you're ignoring geography, so that means Australia is western.

I do. To some of us, even laptops aren't mobile enough. The only way I'll be able to do gaming with my way of life is from a pocket device. Currently I'm limited to retro gaming and Minecraft, which is fun, but has its limits.
What do you do with nova launcher to get that?
Are you in Israel? כרטיס אדי registration is available online, if so. They send you a free organ donor card.
No, but it's not in the West.

It's to the east of Greenwich. Therefore geographically in the East. End of story.

I haven no problem calling Israel and Germany Western countries, it's a useful grouping term, but if we're throwing geographics out the window then Australia definitely counts as Western too.
Well, France, Morocco, Germany and Italy are eastern too, anything to the east of Greenwich.
Want to? Then sign up! I did as soon as I was old enough
[My second time ever breaking Passover is stroopwaffles](https://i.imgur.com/BvSucPx.jpg)
I won't have to, once I move out of Israel. Also, I don't want any grave at all - it's a waste of valuable space.
Danke Schun!
Having biscuits with bacon in a sandwich is a major 1-up compared to what I had. You're totally wrecking me in the game of dough.

Mint fudge Oreos? I need this flavour of Oreo in my life right now! Sadly it's probably never getting imported. Oreo did enough of an effort to kosher-ify the normal flavour, I don't think they'll bother with the rest. They haven't so far.

Well, you're finally Frei, but that doesn't mean you can't have kenidelach or Matzah Brei. It's up to you now, and doesn't come instead of normal food, just in addition to them, like all the other holidays. I personally don't want to see or taste matzah ever again, and I'm nearly starving myself due to my refusal to eat any matzah, but oh well, it'll pass and on Saturday I'll already be having a good, wholesome pizza or something. I do like many Jewish foods like Hamantaschen, or suffganiot, but not matzah. Never again. No thanks.
"so, why are you on birthright? Are you finally reconnecting with your lost Judaism?" "Fuck no. I'm in it for the Hummus."

*That*, is one of the things I'm really gonna miss when I leave.
Yes 😂 store bought hummus is acceptable, and it's utter shit compared to fresh hummus, so you can imagine how good it is!
Absolutely, but when Abu Ghosh isn't accessible, Kfar Qassem will do.
Falafel balls do contain wheat in some form, I believe. They'd exist otherwise, even without a pita, you could have matzah instead of a pita.

And sure but I don't really care about Jewish subraces. It's either for racial jokes or culinary purposes. Otherwise, I couldn't care less.

I just do the bare minimum I can get away with in terms of customs regardless of subrace.
It sure is!
Nope, Kfar Qassem. Abu Ghosh is better but I don't have access to it without a car.
Well it depends, only Sephardic people do, but yes, my father who's Sephardic does eat legumes, so there's nothing unkosher about the Hummus. I've just had rice for dinner. The falafel and pita are total Chametz though!

My mother, for example, avoids legumes. She's Ashkenazi. Some Sephardic orthodox people do avoid legumes as orthodox Judaism is becoming more and more extremist here.

The purple stuff is meat.
For context: I'm from Israel. The city I'm from has non kosher places, but they all close down during Passover. That's why I haven't been able to break any Passover until now. Only arab villages have Chametz available, however, I don't have a car, so I can't drive anywhere, and arab villages don't really have proper public transport leading to them. The arab villages in walking distance from my home are beyond the green line, which makes them not exactly safe. I probably wouldn't die, but it's not a good idea for me, an Israeli, to go there. Especially not by foot.

However, my workplace is within walking distance of a safe arab village, so I finally had access to Chametz during Passover, for the very first time.

I can't hoard Chametz like most atheist Israelis, because my father keeps Passover.
Nah, I don't like it. I don't want any matzah, ever.
True, true, but that doesn't mean it's not modern Hebrew.
It feels like AI never chooses expanding. Why? When are 3 stars ever worth more than expanding?!
It's pretty cool. I tried it on my mum's phone. Now non techie people will update their phones because they won't be unusable during the installation process.
Because they didn't do it.
Still front cam.
That's really good Google's finally doing this.
Actually quite a few young disillusioned people are leaving Israel, including myself.

It's not a horrible place. It's good, actually. It's just very, very hard to live here, and there are much better options.
I don't think many people here left from Islam to Christianity.

I can tell you how many ex Jews are Christians on /r/exjew - 1. And he keeps his religion to himself. Not once have he tried to convert us to Christianity (I'm pretty sure he realises it's never gonna happen).
I don't really care... It advocates for a similar amount of violence. Less people interpret it this way, sure. This doesn't make the religion itself any better, just the followers... As a collective. Obviously this does not apply individually, as that's not how statistics work.
The idea is that your origins don't matter... Only your actions do.
Rov ha means "most of the" in modern Hebrew. It's an everyday term. As for "Kos", it's been "Kos" since at least the revival of Hebrew
Wtf Yiddish is weird 😂😂😂😂 they just add י letters everywhere 😂😂 (it's "rov hakos" in Hebrew, - ha because it's THE cup)

Also... Of course, right. There's a nitty gritty detail to overly focus on. Of course Judaism will fixate on it.
I don't recall there being a requirement to drink the whole cups, just to pour them and drink an amount.

Regardless, the insistence is ridiculous. As is Judaism in general.
How do you eat that fishy grey shit? 😮
Neither 😂 (I don't like Kneidelach at all)
Both are fake, I just wish it was all an April fool's joke.
I prefer the M8. Neither are my favourites, but they're very nice indeed.
Metal frame, dark grey plastic back, blue accents sounds much better to me, but that was the beauty of motomaker. You'd get whatever you wanted.
Exactly. I need a camera, but honestly anything that comes in phones nowadays is more than enough.
Performance
Moto X 2014. Easy. Give it a bigger screen to body ratio like the Pixel 2 XL and it's perfect, regardless, I find it easily as the most beautiful phone there is.
Not at all! I said I don't mind, I just understand why others do
It's not. I'm just saying that you need to be careful of racism. Hating Islam isn't racism, but hating people who descend from Muslim countries, is.

Don't cross that line. Not only is it not beneficial, it's detrimental.
As a subscription, unlocking the bootloader neccesarily won't be possible
Nope. No tinkering with a subscription. It's gotta be mine for that.
I was saying yes - it is different in Israel - here pepperoni is just beef.
Oh. Yes, it is.
Short and cute. My mother's out of the picture now that I don't live with her... She insists on reading the whole legend (I have decided to start calling it אגדה של פסח on purpose because it's an accurate description of it) every time. My father's mum is very relaxed about it, so is my father. They just read some of it and when they got tired of it they stopped (and of course there was a meal).
It all depends on the two parties.
Good, good, it's not ham, so no pork, but still. Any meat on a pizza on YK is a good start. Next Yom Kippur I'll hopefully have a bacon cheeseburger, already outside of Israel.
Preferably earlier next time around, say, Friday afternoon (your time).
Kasher? You mean Chametz. Full of it. Dough is happiness. Chag Chametz vemahir! (And swift is the last word)
Did it have ham? It should've.
That even if that's true, still don't judge people by their geographical origins. 100% whites like me could convert to Islam and want Wahabbism to take over (not that I do, I'm just saying my white exterior doesn't neccesarily mean I mean no harm, it's my personality that does), and dark skinned people like many of you can and do leave Islam and are as secular as I am, and share the same goals - a secular, happy society, where people are happy and religion is only a private thing.
Please tell me you cooked this after Shabbat entered.

It'd be a really good introduction to my first time eating Chametz on Passover tomorrow.

Here's the source, straight from the horse's mouth.
Through kernel mods, at least theoretically.
No, seriously, it does. It's not active in the kernel, so it doesn't actually ever go beyond 60fps, but the screen does have that capability.
Kilo mega giga and tera are part of the metric system too. The beauty of the matter is that we have adapted these terms for storage capacities. Just like metre is the base unit for length/distance, byte is the base unit for storage.

Apples, however, are totally unrelated. The concept of an apple is useless for the purposes of technology.
*water*proof? I don't think that'd suffice.
My Sony does (even if it's unused) and it works fine on 8.0 since October.
I agree, and I say this as a lover of floating windows mode. It's not a replacement for pip.

He's not on a budget.

Why get the Note 8 and not the S9+?
If OP cares at all about karma then they should listen.
To quote myself
> Improvements are insignificant currently

Yeah, I know it's enough. I just said there's not much of a point.
Android has **everything**. That's the beauty of the matter. You want a super overpriced expensive device with a very flashy name? You can go with an iPhone, sure. But hey would you look at that! Android fits the bill as well! Buy a Lamborghini or Porsche branded phone!

What's that, you want a top of the line device with ALL of the bells and whistles? Stuff it full of them? Oh, poor iPhone, it doesn't fit anymore... Android, do you h... Ah, the galaxy S9. Right, great.

Do you want a clean, simple, fast and reliable phone that's like a blank slate you can change to your liking? The iPhone... Is sitting in the corner with its locked system. Android? Maybe this time you won't ha-Pixel 2. Right. Sorry. You still fit.

Okay, let's go nuts, no way Android can still fit! Let's try to max out price efficiency and get a decent phone for as little money as possible. iPhone? Are you there? No? It's gone. Android, are you gone too? Apparently not. Xiaomi Redmi Note 5. Or Mi A1 if you wanna shell out for a clean build.

Hmm. Let's max out battery life, like, as much as possible, okay? iOS, go! Ah right, gone. Andro-Woah woah there okay okay Xiaomi Mi Max, Moto Z Play.

Hmm.... How about if you're a unique hipster and wanna stray off the mainstream... Sounds like you want a Nokia/Sony/Asus/one of the many special devices. I'm not even gonna bother talking about iOS, it's long gone.

Seriously. Android covers EVERYTHING.
You can just mod your system and have it masked by Magisk.
Yes, but it plateaus. Beyond 4GB, improvements are insignificant currently.

That's not to say I'm against having more RAM. I mean, sure, shove 16GB of RAM in, why the heck not?
Ha. I have a Sony phone. I've been getting it forever
Nope. And I noticed. Sorry, but I won't be on
Will you have DST in effect? We do, so while it's normally GMT+2, the actual timezone is shifted to GMT+3.
You need to talk about timezones, madam... We are in different timezones. What is it in relation to GMT?
On an app, rather than the website?
Exactly! Also, plastic is a better material to build a phone out of.

Port 8080 is an http port... Just use one of the non reserved ports. So, not 80, 8080, 43, or 8443.
Probably a few slaves escaped from ancient Egypt and made a huge story about it. And also they were too cheap to bother with bread so now I won't have access to it.

I guess they're already handling RTL with Arabic, so adding Hebrew isn't that big of a deal.

I intend on keeping my phone in English regardless.
Pick a unique, non Islamic, secular name, that isn't associated with Islam.

I was referring to the locked bootloader thing, not encryption backdoors. I've no doubt those either do, or will exist.

Good thing I'm not American.

That's not happening outside of the USA, luckily.
This'll prevent external access to your data.
Doesn't need to be Arabic, but you might wanna consider whichever area of the world your ancestors are from, it's a really nice way to find an original name.
Precisely what I meant, blocking access.
Better yet, flash a custom ROM and never worry about ota.
I'm not surprised...

I might not want to join the rooting community when I move to Australia.
Nano is the best opengapps package.
I have a rough idea of what recursion is, a function that calls itself, but I don't see how could this work in the way I want it to. Have a loop within a function, where the function calls itself, but preceeded with an "if array[array.length+1] != null" statement?

Would that totally work? And also, I'd really appreciate a proper example, if you can show me something that goes through all the subfolders within a folder, and lists all of the folders and their subfolders (say, just for this example, in a text file)
Unlock bootloader, flash custom ROM... Done. Bypassed.

Of course, non Android enthusiasts won't be able to do this, I'm well aware.
If what you need is a simple laptop that basically is a phone with a large screen, keyboard, and multiwindow, then the Chromebook is what you're looking for. It's perfect for my sister and uncle.
I seriously need to go to an Ethiopian place. Good thing Israel had a big Ethiopian immigration operation, this way Ethiopian stuff is way more common in Israel than in most of the western world.
It's absurd. I get why you laughed.

It's hard/impossible to fully grasp the fact that stuff like this still happens in 2018. Because of that, we laugh.

I mean, if this wasn't real, this would make me drop the floor laughing because this is so ridiculous. It's like I find racism funny when no one's actually hurt - say, when a white coworker of mine declined to serve a customer that demanded service by a white person (we work in a phone centre - he hung up in the customer's face, we never do that, but this was justifiable) - racism, even though nobody was hurt in this particular instance. If I saw an Ethiopian guy (we don't have many black people in Israel, most of them are Ethiopians) denied entry into a club, first I'd back the fuck off that shithole, and, I wouldn't find that funny at all.
I'd recommend either a secular Arabic name (just like I have a secular Hebrew name and I left Judaism), or a secular name that originates from the country you originate from.
I have a feeling that Devs on xda will find a way to reuse the same ticket indefinitely, much like they bypassed safetynet.
Right, but the fruit "apple" has nothing to do with technology, whereas the word "exa" is highly related to storage capacities.
Eternally? That's problematic.
iPhones are still worse
100 for how long? Per month?
Why not
That sounds like one big "and"
I'm very surprised and pleased that Google added an exception for custom ROMs!
Exactly. I want a phone that isn't trying to be something it's not. My phone isn't trying to copy the iPhone at ALL.
Sure thing, 2 it is then. I still call that rare.
Half my family came from Poland, can confirm
Alright, just wanted to make sure you were referring to software, not hardware
I can understand why some people might be disturbed by it. It is behaviour that probably shouldn't be done in public, but I wouldn't say anything because I genuinely don't mind.

Walk around naked and have wild sex in the middle of the street for all I care.
As usual, these people are not following their own logic
> there are colors in images taken/uploaded by iPhones that literally no Android devices can see/distinguish

You mean in terms of app support, not in terms of display support, right? Some of us have triluminous HDR displays.
Yes. I plan on moving countries in a few months and I need to be light. I'm also not gonna invest in a computer only to have it be mediocre.

My only computer is my phone. It's actually very capable, mainly thanks to OTG.
I feel like it was better than it in every regard, especially the much larger screen size, which is perfect for multiwindow, the feature of Android I was most excited about
Maybe now it can be done with the vendor binaries

That ad's gone deep in the USA, didn't it? I barely remembered it, and they did air it in Israel. I still just barely remember it. I bet most Israelis don't remember it at all.
😍 what the hell are you talking about?! This will never happen but I wish! This sounds **amazing**!!!!! I'd pay extra for the privilege of plastic! I miss plastic so much... Sure it doesn't look premium, but it's *such* a great material.
Performance, Dex, 960 fps (the XZ Premium is not much more durable so it's the same idea), one of the first 2018 phones, screen quality... You name it.

It's the same thing as how I am not disappointed by how my 4K screen is useless to me. Even though that's heralded as the big feature of my phone due to its exclusivity, I bought it for other reasons, and didn't expect 4K to matter.

People who buy an S9 don't buy it for its durability - they know what to expect now.
What I mean is that "not advised" is not going to stop something from being on XDA.
I was referring to developers on XDA, not an official build. "Not advised" isn't relevant on XDA.
Thanks for the suggestion. I might try it if I can be arsed to do so.
Can't they repartition?
Where is that? I want it too, after I update
Then I'd expect it to not work properly, not be totally removed
Fucking hell... What's wrong with Google? When nougat came along with it, it was a dream come true.

Now? Utter shit...
It's legal in Israel obviously 😂😂

I think void botanic miners refer to the Orechid - in a void world, you can produce infinite stone, and use the Orechid to prduce mining resources.
Absolutely. Neutronium exists in Avarita, awakened draconium is in draconic evolution. Thermionic fabricators are in forestry (but they make vacuum tubes), there's gelid cryotheum in thermal expansion, there's a void botanic miner, although it's not called that - the Orechid is a Botania flower which for the cost of mana turns nearby stone into ore (including modded ores) with chances corresponding to ore rarities in the game, there are resonant machines in thermal expansion, and starlight is a major component in astral sorcery.
True. In Israel we don't say "חנות המשחקים" - khanoot hamiskhakim", we say "גוגל פליי" - Google Play. Netflix isn't סדרות מרשתת (internet shows... That's the closest translation I could think of for "flicks")
Looks like an XZ Premium 😂😂😂😂
Several formats and other OSSsses later... Same thing. It can't be a software issue. Not after formats and other operating systems and repartitioning.

It must be some sort of weird hardware degredation. Maybe it's dust or something, idk.
I never said it's not. I'm not going to bother repairing it though
Yes.

Absolute garbage. XFCE barely runs.
Even if I'm not in Australia yet?
Not for me (I did it more than once, including repartitioning)
Oh damn, Hawaii?!
> Or you could just put your money

Literally.
Any Australian credit unions supported?
Yes, they do, though not often (I'm not one).
Nope. Not at all. Some countries don't have them AT ALL. I'm speaking from experience. I've never seen one aside from when I was in Austria.
Yes. People in places with really good public transport, or people who live in big cities (or both).
Most? I'd disagree. Some people still do need an x86 GNU distro, or Windows, or Mac OS, but nowadays they're a minority. Most people today don't do ANYTHING that requires a desktop/laptop, even if they have one. Something like a phone and a Superbook would do the job just fine.

I don't (although I want to - PC gaming), and I'm a tech enthusiast.
Root your phone and then you can cover ADB (and fastboot) too.
Media? Media needs nothing more than a phone. If you have any complaints about the screen, use an adapter to hook it up to your TV. File management can be fully done on Android aside from creating archives (only ZIP and RAR can be created on Android), and file conversions (Android really is lacking in that regard and I hope that this changes for the better).

Document editting - the only reason it's not as good is because of the default configuration of Android. Hook it up to a mouse and keyboard and it's perfect.

Storage? Hook your phone up to a hard drive/SSD.

Device management? If you're rooted you can do quite a lot. Heck, my rooted phone can run ADB and fastboot. As the host (or as the client obviously). I've ran ADB commands from a OnePlus One into my XZ Premium.
Hmm? What? I'm on Android and aside from the lack of non P2W games, yes, it's great.
Then hook your phone up to a keyboard and mouse. This is Android we're talking about. You can do ANYTHING.
Yes, because my laptop became too weak to run... Anything. Windows runs at 10 fps at best. Trying to open anything? That takes minutes. I don't know why it degraded so quickly (bought in 2012, stopped being usable in early 2016), it was a 6GB RAM + Intel core i5 PC.

However, my phone is plenty quick and thanks to OTG and other Android tools, it does all that I need it to. Am I missing PC gaming? Yes, very much so. Android games that aren't P2W are few and far inbetween.
Rubles or rupees?
Oh right.

Sorry to hear, I'm not American
Nobody knows when was the last time it snowed in my city
Was Schrodinger Swiss?
Meanwhile I've never even seen snow
Hehehe that's a good reason to come visit here 😉
Right, right! I remember I was there and it was 30°. I was comfy, whereas an Austrian guy I was with was burning. He had a band on his hand, so when he took it off, it was red-white-red.

My skin's white but doesn't burn easily 😉
Ak. Shkak. Kakakhushi!
To me, a Danish accent sounds like there's some potato mash in the mouth of whoever speaks in one (when I heard Danish people trying to speak English, that's what happened, their English was fine, but their accent was funny and like nothing I've ever heard before)

Better than chopping off the end of the penis of your 8 day old son, becaude the rabbi says so, and your parents did it to you for the same reason.
You're not too young, but do take your time with your transition and actions. It's got nothing to do with your age, just with the fact that your belief ended 3 months ago.

Take your time. Figure things out before you start telling everyone. The lack of a god isn't going anywhere. Do go on, just, slowly.

Make sure that you feel comfortable, confident, and not angry before you start being an activist. You sound a bit like you're rushing it.
I know, what I'm saying is, with Yalp, you can download paid apps if you paid for them. With apkmirror, you can't.
Eruv is more ridiculous
The thing is you can't download paid apks even if you bought the app
If Nova can do it, any device administrator app can do it.

[Try this](https://reddit.com/r/Android/comments/8515vn/android_ps_lockdown_feature_now_ported_to_custom/dvu5rtf?context=3)
Oh cool! That's highly useful!
Soon you won't need root, since you can just have a device administrator app
Root allows that. I've done this since Lollipop.
Having TWRP already implies that the bootloader is unlockable.
Right, but there are phones with unlockable bootloaders that have no ROMs.

My phone has a little bit, but really not much in the way of ROMs, yet it has TWRP and an unlockable bootloader.
But with TWRP, you don't need a PC for that (once you have TWRP installed)
We've got גנן גידל דגן בגן דגן גדול גדל בגן - that's a sentence

I loöve the doubling of letters. My Finnish friend always sounds like she's been saying the same sound for ages when she speaks Finnish.

And types, too. What a crazy language you guys have (not that Hebrew is more sane).
Prom's nice but you can live without it.

Don't worry, you'll have plenty of other opportunities to "mix the genders" and do "we do not believe in this". Just pass it and don't make a big deal out of it. Soon you'll be free.
That's the big thing? A screen locking API?

If they made a way to launch apps while the screen is locked, and had a "securelocked API", to allow Devs to launch their apps in a limited functionality mode when the phone is locked, that'd be something, but a screen locking API? That's peanuts. Easily achievable with root on any version.
Motorola Atrix... Idk how, hardware faults stacked on each other and one last CM7 flash killed it.

Haier W910 - charging port dead

Elephone P3000S - charging port dead
Almost no new APIs beyond notches though...

It's really not that exciting. Oreo at least had notification channels going for it which is pretty cool, but P? It's shaping up to be a little more than a custom ROM...
Do you count substratum support as good design? In that case, Oreo is superior.
No need for Android P. Just use an app with device administrator permissions to lock your phone, say, Nova Launcher.

Done. It can only be unlocked with information, not biometric data.
TREBLE 😍😍😍😍😍

Wow I could pick any phone going forward and not worry about ROM support!!!! (As long as it has TWRP)
It should be obvious, and not be made evident by this as it's already obvious.
Wow. It took you this long to realise?
Is that question relevant? The XZ2 is very different.
I will be! Because here that same time will be filled with disgusting, dough-less food (Israel, and because of the Jewish holiday passover).
I thought that A/B neccesarily supports Treble beyond 8.0. I know that A/B is not neccesary for treble.
You can also just hook up a Bluetooth controller and use it that way.
It has dual system partitions. I would've expected to get native Treble with Oreo
It doesn't natively have treble?! How strange...
Even if they ban you, it's not okay to not have an appeal process.
Ah. I see.
What I said in the title is a cool thing to do that's only possible using Android.
If you left him, you wouldn't have children with Islam imposed upon them. How on earth can you be okay with having children raised Muslim? I get that you can overcome and overlook other things, but this?!
> love is all you need

And does Islam allow for love, or does Islam oppose love?
> he would want to raise the children muslim. The latter I came to the conclusion I may be okay with as long as its within reasonable parameters

First of all, how are you okay with having children and having this religion forced upon them against their will?

Second of all, you can say "within reasonable parameters" all you want but it'll be broken VERY, VERY quickly.

I mean, if you wanna be with him yourself that's your business (I don't recommend it), but having children with him? Don't you think that it's cruel to allow Islam to be imprinted onto a child when you can choose not to have that child to begin with?

And you don't even fully want children? Please, please don't have children. I don't either, but I'm not considering having children with anyone anytime soon. I'm imagining those children having a mother that doesn't fully and totally want them, and has doubts about it (again, that's fine, but don't have children in that case), with Islam, the religion their mother left, imposed on them from birth... You can prevent ALL that by not having children with that guy. Please reconsider the having children part.
Good. It shouldn't come to that for a deportation though. A deportation should come long before murder (not automatically, I mean that smaller crimes should suffice to achieve deportation - with enough warning).
It'll be interesting to see what advice they give, if they have any. I mean, many people here needed to hide the fact they left Islam, so if they wanted to take off a hijab, they'd need to make sure people don't think they've left Islam. Only with you it's not faking it, you actually want people to not think you've left Islam.
Honestly with tattoos I think that symbols are much better than text. They're much more open to interpretation.
I'm imagining the whole logo as a tattoo now 😂😂😂😂
האנגלית שלך מצוינת, נועם!

I still don't think that permanently having a bible quote on yourself is a good idea. You're trying to leave Judaism behind, right? Your goal isn't to fight Judaism, just to leave it, like most of us. If you feel a need to tattoo something, pick a symbol for a value you gained as a part of leaving Judaism, rather than a biblical wordplay.
I get your point, but I disagree. Are you sure you wanna permanently mark yourself with a quote from that sickening book, even if you're purposefully taking it out of context to make the message good? You should Think about it... Tattoos are permanent. Fuck the bible, I don't care about the לא תקעקע את עורך or whatever the bible says, but tattoos are still permanent. I don't think that's a good idea.

If you want to have a mark of you leaving Judaism behind, then make your personality mark that by moving away from bad Jewish values, such as "the Goyim are inferior". If you still want a tattoo, just don't do a bible quote.
I was referring to Christians and Jews being allowed to flourish and co-operate with Muslims in the Islamic golden age
That's wasn't the case though. People were allowed to believe in different beliefs at the time.
But you wouldn't mind having it, would you?
Was this ironic? I have a feeling they'll notch the 6...
But you wouldn't enjoy it any *less* if you had a headphone jack, right?
Even if you and I don't use it normally, it's still good to have one.
Exactly. I just plugged my phone into a speaker system earlier. Even though I use Bluetooth headphones, it's useful.
From my experience, it still pulls on the headphones and is often pulled on. These headphones are functional for over 3 months. No wired headphones made it this far with me. Always, one ear failed, and then the other. Every single time. Within a month or two.
Mine have a built in battery. Lithium Ion. You never need to change them, you charge using a cable, which I'm currently doing through OTG (go Android!). An hour of charge lasts me 2.5 days of regular use. 15 minutes of charging lasts me through the day.
No, he's referring to the fact that there's NO WAY the average user could **benefit** from losing it. Yes, many people, including myself, don't use the 3.5mm jack, but nobody *benefits* from it.
Plus, as a Bluetooth headphone user, having a 3.5mm jack doesn't harm Bluetooth audio in any way shape or form. It's still there and I can use it to plug speakers in.
Still, using a Japanese phone is only possible if you're an Android user.
Israel. Mostly Samsung and LG, although there's some OnePlus and Xiaomis are getting increasingly popular. There are some iPhones too, of course, but honestly they're a minority. I even see another Sony from time to time
iOS is only running on iPhones. iPhones are not Japanese phones, whereas Android does run on Japanese phones
Or without 
It's about time!
Well, for me, the 30% difference in a 300% priced phone is worth it.
And the white Canada and Greenland are in must be all snow, right?
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, but to be honest that doesn't affect me, so I don't really think about it. I want the devices that originally had 5.7 inches to become 6, or 6.4 (like the first Mi Mix).
Excuse me, why do you think I'm defending *notches*, and not the trend of minimising bezels in general? Neither the top comment, nor did my previous comment mention notches in any way shape or form. I think that the Samsung way is the best way to minimise bezel.
That's already a matter of personal preference.

I'd rather have them keep the body the same size and just make the screen massive. (Otherwise I would've gotten an XZ1/C. I don't actually care about the screen resolution that much, only the size).
I use a Sony Xperia XZ Premium if anyone's curious as to which phone I was referring to
Why would they go away (beyond deprecation)? Or is deprecation what you're referring to?
Sure, I figured, but it should work with both orientations
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with editing, just disclose it.
That's what toggleable settings are for
I see it as function.

I want the biggest screen I could possibly have. Getting the screen to body ratio to approach 100% will result in the biggest screen possible.

Edit: by the way, just to demonstrate how much I prefer function: my ideal phone has a 100% screen to body ratio, and a removable high quality plastic back with NFC and wireless charging, a removable battery, SD card slot, and 2 USB C ports (which must support OTG). Although that's already my preference. Some people would rather give those up for a glass/metal back.
> root *is* malware as far as half the industry is concerned

Still, everyone should leave the option available, in a manner that cannot possibly be done by accident, and isn't too easy so that it's not done by someone that doesn't understand the risk.
Ohh you meant specifically for virtual xposed, I see.
Because it needs to launch apps from within it. It's a virtual environment. It really is a build of Launcher3, with xposed injected into it.
Xosed without root is possible, sure, but it's irrelevant.
I get that
Hopefully they'll keep it as a warning indefinitely. They shouldn't enforce such restrictions on Android, only on Google Play.
A warning? Good! A play store ban! Good! Just don't prevent such apps from running. If they fail on their own it's their fault, but don't prevent it.
I think that's the best way to handle this. Force developers to target newer versions, but allow users to install apps that don't comply if they wish. 
No... That's only a Google Play policy, not a system-wide restriction. You can always install an APK targeting Donut, just not from Google Play.
Still, you can go nano!
"no real Jew could pass this up! Are you a real Jew?" 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Mine didn't happen yet.

I hope it's gonna occur on September 18th (Yom Kippur), right after I leave Israel.
😂😂😂😂
> Suuure honey. Seriously though, you didn't like your body, you changed it. You didn't like your religion, you changed it.

That sounds perfectly reasonable. Why wouldn't she? If my gender bothered me at all, I'd be trans as well. I'm already not very masculine. I just don't mind it, so I see no reason to change it.
> someone who uses their phone in the synagogue on Shabbat.

So stupid... If you wanna use your phone on Saturday then join me and come have a bacon cheeseburger with me, why are you wasting your time at a synagogue?! 😂 I have a special controller for phones, we could play those games enjoyably, without anyone telling us what to do, instead of doing so in secret while hearing boring Siddur texts!
> With faith, there is always an extra reason, that has nothing to do with "do it because its right to do." 

What exactly do you mean by that? That's an interesting sentence right there.
Or maybe he's studying that shit from a theological point of view, learning about what other people believe?
In good faith? That's a bit of an ironic use of this phrase 😂😂😂

Good faith is exactly why one would believe all this bullshit!
Ask him out to a bacon cheeseburger? 😉
That's just what I could remember off the top of my head. There's more.
Assistant works fine with nano. Nano simply covers everything that you can't get just from downloading from the play store.
Dinero
One example is the always listening Ok Google detection
**Black** mirror?! You racist! How dare you! It's afro-mirror!
It just suddenly appears on phones. It suddenly appeared on mine.
Yes, nano is the most minimal version which allows for full functionality (the one most devices should get), and Pico is the one that, well... Makes Google Play work. Might as well get MicroG+Yalp instead at that point.
Doesn't seem like it, though it definitely has its advantages, like universal, instant updates.
I recommend nano, because Pico is missing a bit of core functionality. It's just enough for Google Play to run.

Nano has everything that can't be obtained through normal installation from Google Play. I think that nano is the perfect package.
Yes. I've done this countless times.
That you're datboi שישים ותשע? Yeah, let's keep it secret.
Okay, good to hear! Don't let anyone tell you what to do then, do what you want and screw the stigma. You only live once.
You buy these for the texture, not for the flavour.

I haven't drunk these in YEARS! 😂😂😂
Oh, good.
In was referring to the "no one can force you"... In Iran it's definitely not true. What about Indonesia?
Yes, I just bought myself the peach one.
Why would a god that wants to be believed in so much make his existence so ridiculously unintuitive? Things simply don't match up.
Are you sure that's true though? I mean, principally I agree, but I don't think Indonesia works this way...
I didn't say that you should. I didn't downvote you.
You're not translating the mistake though. It's more like Hannukah Happy.
Look, we know when we're sure.

This Hebrew is extremely clear.
I love how you instantly recognised that this is a tattoo post without OP ever using that word! 😂😂😂
וואי נכון! לא חשבתי על זה אבל אתה לגמרי צודק!
המילה שקפצה לי לראש היא "אירוניה" 😂😂😂
Oh right, I forgot about that.
Oh, really? I thought this stuff came straight from the USA! Well than, you've made me want to buy myself some Aloe Vera juice.
Ohh you mean שוקולד פרה with pop rocks in it! I thought you meant raw pop rocks + chocolate
I know what ז.ק.פ means, I was joking...
Gays can have erections too
No, no, I*r*an 😉😉😉😏😏
One could argue that he was referring to the places modern German states occupy today though
Shekels were also a unit of measurement in the bible. For example, if you raped a woman, you'd pay her father 50 shekels of silver. That's a specific mass of silver.
I'm not a huge fan of chocolate, but pop rocks AND aloe vera drinks? That's an interesting idea.

There's a Bisli clone now that tastes less salty, and less unhealthy, it's really cool. Might wanna consider it.
I think that's the most important part. It's not **all** bad.
> www.mo$$ad.com.il/recruitment/exmuslims

This is not how it would be, let me fix your URL. (We use .co.il, not .com.il, recruitment is often replaced with the Hebrew word in websites, and the currency of Israel is ₪ (shekels), not $). Might wanna copy paste the ₪ in case you wish to do shekel jokes btw!

כן, מדבר המוסד, איך אפשר לעזור?
אנחנו נשלח אותך לחסל את מוחמד כי זה ברור שהוא לא באמת מת!

אנחנו גם נשלם לך בשביל... אמממממ.... לא להאמין באיסלאם? כן, למה לא, אנחנו גם ככה מפוצצים בכסף.

We hope that you consider our offer (and learn Hebrew instantly).
> The sooner people begin to see this, the easier it is to stop believing in stories.

And the sooner we can start trying to change that, as humans.

A problem has to be acknowledged before it can be solved.
"my reasons are very personal and I feel that it's best if I keep them to myself"
If anything, she could think OP is seriously considering her questions and seriously reconsidering their apostasy, so that next time they meet, she would be less likely to dismiss OP's apostasy.
Woah.

That is like... Wow. This outcome is just amazing. My father fully accepts me and love me despite having left his religion, but actually taking my doubts seriously and looking into them himself? I can never ever expect that to happen. That is something I'm not even hoping for, it's that unlikely. I mean, I'm really happy with him accepting me as a person, even if he doesn't take my disbelief in Judaism seriously and just sees it as a teen/youngster rebellious thing (although I was never one to be rebellious, so I partially don't get why he classifies it as that, it's probably just the fact that he was raised to believe in Judaism from birth.
But there's nothing wrong with wanting to adopt some aspects of some cultures.
Oh perfect! It's some tasty shit 
She did ASMR? Seriously? That's awesome. The next Wonder Woman should have ASMR at the middle of an action sequence 😉

I actually personally prefer Bisli, but the chances of people knowing Bisli are even lower than Bamba.
Perfect. I've have a pizza with bacon too, which is unkosher 😍
A woman doing advanced math? How Haram! 😂😂
I could buy 5 Bambas for that much money!
A white light isn't the best description.... "I have no fucking clue" is a better scientific description of what was the source of all matter and energy.
Islam is bad, therefore a watered down version, is less bad.
Can doesn't mean should.

I left Judaism, but there's still no reason to hate Jewish people. If you just hate Judaism then your feelings are a tad bit strong but if you wanna keep them that's your business. Just leave the people alone. Most of them are good people, that just want to live their lives. I'm speaking from experience.
How surprising. Wow. I'm shocked. (Read this in a very calm and unsurprised tone)

I just wish people over there actually realised this. I'm sure there's some way to publicly expose this and make it common knowledge.

This taking over Europe thing needs to end. This is not integration. Integration is all of the immigrants living among Europeans, of which there are many, and they're contributing members of society. Those need to be supported.
Look, I'm not one to dismiss pasta and bacon, but sometimes those things, while great, do not suffice.
That's why I added the "does it harm anyone" part - since the answer is no, there's nothing wrong with approving and awarding that behaviour.

Don't want to? Okay. Then don't. Just keep it to yourself.
Well, at least those multiple wives are in Germany and not Saudi Arabia. That's... Not as bad but still messed up.
I forgot that this is a thing. Shit. This is a thing.

What is wrong with people?!
Religion of peace my ass.

The fact that you need a guide like this, and that people actually use it is ridiculous and horrible. My condolences for that. I do not want to think what would've happened if I was born to a Muslim family rather than a Jewish one, 300km to the east of where I am. I'd be in a completely different situation. My life would've probably been in danger. I might've been dead by now. Just 300 kilometres to the east (I'm in Israel, and I'm referring to Saudi Arabia).

It's horrifying to think of the difference those 300km make. Life and death. Literally.

You have my deepest sympathies, ex Muslims. I hope that all of you manage to reach free lives without Islam, wherever you may be.
Shh! The moment you say it someone might catch it and make an exjewish meme sub 😂😂😂
Honestly I think interest in Judaism for the culture and food is the best form of interest in Judaism us ex Jews can hope for. It's unlikely to lead to a conversion, it's likely to lead to lots of great foods and customs, and with enough interest of that kind, one might even see the actual religion for what it really is, and understand what they should avoid, and why.
No, but if you're not then no need to point it out. You're spreading negativity for no good reason. Not venting about Judaism, not for the sake of sympathy (it's exactly the opposite), and not to push for change. No good comes from your negativity, or at least relevance to /r/exjew
Does sympathy cost anything? Is OP hurting anyone?

No to both? Then might as well sympathise, why not, it only does good.
I'm not surprised. Sadly.

Can't they just not care and focus on what matters?

Nope.

It kinda reminds me of my mother. She doesn't say that there's anything wrong with homosexuality, but whenever she talks about family, she has to mention it. "So there's x's son, he's gay, and he also has a brother, y, he's married to a non Jew. Their father, who married a black woman, is a person I like very much."

She never fails to mention such facts about such people. 
I'm sure that if OP gathers the courage to go, reality will prove his fears incorrect.
0.

People are responsible for their own actions. Actual Nazis are totally guilty and should be punished. However, say, Hitler had a child who was alive today, if his opinions are close to mine, I'd be happy to meet them and chat, and they wouldn't owe me any apology. They *should* learn from the actions of their ancestors (as either a positive or a negative example), but they don't have to. The Germans don't *need* to actively make sure that the holocaust is remembered (as a preventative measure - reminding everyone that we must not allow another genocide to occur). It's really nice that they took it upon themselves, and I'm proud of them for that, but they shouldn't feel obligated to do so. They should feel privileged to do so. It's not punishment for their ancestors having caused the holocaust. It's heroism that some Germans take part in.
Yes, I want to get from point A to point B. Fun? Sure, but that comes secondary. My main goal when riding my bike (except for Yom Kippur) is to get from point A to point B.
It's not flat though.

It has many ups and downs.
Oh my! Hahahhaaha
Fading into oblivion is forever. Continuing to suffer is not - you can improve your situation as long as you're alive.
Also, makes fetuses born into poverty. That person made poor choices to fall back into poverty. A child does not. It's just luck.
Pro-birth.

Call them what they are. Pro-birth.

They don't care about the mother's life, or the life that fetus would have if kept. They only care about birth.
You're on the iPhone. The iPhone is a flagship level device. What did you expect? If you went for a Pixel 2 you'd have the same experience or better.
The claim is "it didn't happen". There's no proof that it did. That's how you prove it didn't happen. Not with absolute certainty, sure, but with enough confidence that you might as well say "it didn't happen".

Beyond that, for proof that is more concrete than lack of proof, science can prove that it is impossible to walk on water or turn water into wine, or be resurrected (and even if Jesus only died clinically he might as well have died completely, as the pit he was buried in didn't have modern day, 21st century medical equipment).
Theoretically, yes, but in practice I'm not waiting that long to leave (also there might be a secular revolt starting, to bring Israel out of this downwards spiral, back to the way it was founded more or less. The Israeli declaration of independence is actually very good for its time! For example: not many women could vote in 1948. Israeli women could, however), as I think life will be easier in another country regardless.

For the time being, it's still a wonderful place to visit, and a good place to live in. I just think I have a better alternative. I seriously do recommend that you visit, despite all I've said. It's beautiful, diverse, and interesting. At least for now.
Not officially recognised. Heck, even within Judaism, only the orthodox route is recognised. Reform Judaism is not officially recognised. This means that if reform Jews want to marry, they'll have to go to a rabbi. An orthodox rabbi, because any other rabbi will just not be recognised by the state of Israel. At least they haven't given orthodox Judaism a monopoly on the word "rabbi", like they did with the word "kosher", so a reform rabbi can call themselves a rabbi. I have a feeling the powerful orthodox parties, that keep the unstable right wing coalition from collapsing are working towards banning that, too.

I mean, it's totally allowed to belong to a religion that is not officially recognised (you can scream "I'M AN ATHEIST" right to a cop's face and they won't do anything to you), or none, but officially, in the Israeli records, you'll still have to have a recognised religion, which affects where you're allowed to marry, whether you're officially allowed to work on Saturday (officially Jews are not allowed to work on Saturday. Sounds a lot like the Nuremberg laws, doesn't it?), although that's not actually enforced, and severely other official matters.
I'd love to, too, but this is one case you should use them.
This is indeed an amazing country to bike around, but one can only bike so far (and back). Rishon Lezyion, a city with a shopping centre that's open on Saturdays is 20km away. Tell Aviv is 30.
It's not a recognised religion here, so no.
That is EXACTLY what I'd like you to answer.
Alright. Sounds reasonable (not really). Where's your proof?
Let's just say that the things you've just mentioned practically put me under house arrest today.

I cannot drive - I didn't get a license, therefore, there was no way for me to get out of the house. At all. My only way of getting around on Saturdays is walking. Nothing else. Public transport is banned.
Apparently you can say you're been disfellowshipped.
You nail it? How wonderfully ironic!
That's just priceless 😂😂😂😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂
It only sounds less fake because we are conditioned to believe in, or at least know about religions like Christianity/Judaism.
The second thing is hilarious 😂😂😂😂
That reminds me of when a customer on the phone (I work for ISP tech support) tried to convert me to JW and I had to mute my mic because I started laughing uncontrollably, until I managed to hold my laughter in and say "sure, sure, have a wonderful day Sir", hang up, and let the rest of the laughter out 😂😂😂

I didn't know that there are Jehovah's Witnesses in Israel. Also, he vocally said עדי יהוה, which would be incredibly offensive to anyone who was at all a believer. They might go mad. Seriously. יהוה is a super forbidden word in Hebrew, like Voldemort in Harry Potter. He's lucky he was speaking with me because otherwise he'd get screamed at for being disrespectful and actually harming the tech support agent.
Better than Israel.

There is simply no way for me to not be registered as Jewish by the state. That happened at birth, and now it's completely permanent. If I want to change that, I'll have to go through an official conversion to one of the other religions (that's obviously not happening, ever), and have that be my registered religion instead.

Being legally unable to not be marked as Jewish is kinda reminiscent of your country, 78 years ago, isn't it? Assholes. Germany, the one that started that shit, managed to end it and is now much better at it than Israel, the country that was founded by victims of that huge, brutal German fuck up. And this country slowly keeps on regressing. Eventually I doubt there will be a democratically elected leader like there is now.
Same goes here in Israel. I wish synagogues didn't get special treatment, but they do.
Almost? Why almost?
Of course not. They've proven their value and have strict regulations to ensure they're legitimate regarding their non profit status. The same should apply to churches.
I think they should just not get it by default, and only get it if they meet the criteria like any other non profit.
Only those people won't donate, because they only donate to those that threaten then with eternal punishment, or compensate them with an eternal reward.
Only it's not even that - Israel is like an island. You'd be surprised by how much Israel is in Europe and not in the middle east, despite it literally being in the middle east.
That sounds way better than what people like him are actually slowly turning this country into.

In LGBTstan I could do whatever I wanted, including not having intercourse or not dating any males. Just because it'd be a country for LGBTs doesn't mean being hetero wouldn't be accepted. I could also take a bus somewhere interesting on Saturday and not sit at home stuck with nothing to do and nowhere to go, which is what happened to me today in Israel, not LGBTistan.

Honestly I wouldn't mind living in LGBTstan. There are some alternatives that I think are better, like Canada, Australia, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, or other highly advanced countries, but LGBTistan would be pretty high up.

Crosspost it to /r/exjew!
Not necessarily. It's *also* the budget market. It's universal.

There are still idiots who think that Android = laggy and cheap, which is technically not incorrect - it can be. You could've been one of those defensive Apple fanboys.

There's no way of knowing for sure - unless you say "also"
Edit: *Would've been* disproven by any dead person, *had that god actually existed*.
Wtf 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Go with the Nokia 2. I don't think you have a better option, unless you're willing to order it online.
I'm pretty sure that when they mean strict, $130 is too much.
Not all of us do.

Some of us get that if we want better, non P2W shit games, it costs money.
That's exactly how IAPs should be, good job!

I'm not really interested in this kind of game, but I'll make sure to keep an eye out if you ever do make a game that fits my taste 😄
Really useful with Drastic because you can't trade on DS.
The money of Whales released 😑😒

Pay 2 win shit...

I wish they just ported PC games instead of having these 2 currency systems where one is for P2W styff
I just focused on the people and culture.

The Jews have done awful stuff in the past as well. Does this mean your parents or my parents are evil people? No.

When I was in Austria, I simply internalized the fact that all most Austrians want to do is to get through life and enjoy doing it. Just like most of us humans.
I might just stay on Oreo until there's a proper DRM backup/AOSP ROM then.
*This* is how you do notches.
Why wouldn't they? You can modify the ROM and make it have CameraAPI2
Substratum already can't be activated by accident, so even if people get crashes with it (including myself), let us handle it, OR, make you apps more theme friendly! Don't remove the ability to use themes, wtf?!
Ikr?
That's not what I mean. What I mean is that if the AOSP codebase is modified, fonts can be changed without root. Custom ROMs work as a proof of concept, not as a solution.
Then I must've misinterpreted your implications.
To say it in their holy language: כלום. בולשיט מוחלט
Did they intentionally remove OMS? It's probably just a DP1 thing
It IS in DP1, you know.
I'm not. Not yet 😉🙃
I get that with my family too. The more they care about Judaism, the more boring they are, generally. The less they do, the more interesting they are.
Because consentual sex almost always is. How else are you supposed to make females pump out babies like they're not human beings?
Then check the new comments. That's a really good way out.
Kinda dry and cold+hot at the same time. The rest depends on the drink. It's hard to explain, you'll notice it when you try it. Don't drink much, do it moderately. And don't expect it to make you cool. In the first few times, your knees will shake.
Good, good. Alcohol is fine if you keep it moderate. Cigarettes are not. There are plenty of ways to break Islam that aren't harmful to your lungs. Next up: bacon cheeseburgers and Hawaiian pizza (I've had lots of the latter when I visited Europe).

I can give you 0.5 shekels if you promise not to, seeing as you collect these 😉

I'm a shekel collector too, I'm trying to collect some and then use them to move out and not use shekels anymore 😎🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
Good, good. Take beer (moderately), don't smoke.

I didn't plan to and I don't plan to.
And then when you finish school and start working you also lose that. Then you need to work and instead of being able to eat normal food on your breaks... You can't. There is an Arab village in walking distance though, so maybe I can after all.
Hahahaha I'm not looking forward to the Seder, it's boring and frustrating!
Huh, I thought you converted from Judaism straight to Christianity. Sounds a bit different from what I expected then.

I mean, if I was at all interested in Christianity (I'm not, it's a religion), I would get some seriously annoying treatment that would strongly push me to leave Judaism. 

My parents are always like "as much as we love our son, it's disappointing that he doesn't follow or believe in Judaism, but at least he's not into Christianity". I find it somewhat annoying that they think that, but it doesn't really affect me much.
> Imagine how much harder it is for someone on the spectrum to never interact with the opposite sex until they're in their 20s.

No thanks, that sounds depressing...

Can't wait to get away from this religion (I'm in Israel).
That sounds like a REALLY rare combo. Jews are overall a minority. Autistic people aren't very common. People who leave Judaism are even less common. Multiply that with the rarity of autism, and the chances of one being on this sub are very low.

Turns out there is one, though.
The app? 😎
As a red herring.

Treat Google's "hints" as red herrings. When lockheimer referred to Nutella, I was even more hopeful 7.0, one of the most important updates to me (multiwindow) is gonna be Nougat.
Moto Atrix (1.5 years) -> Haier W910 (1 year) -> Elephone P3000S (2-3 months and then it stopped working) -> OnePlus One (2 years) -> Sony Xperia XZ Premium (I don't know how long yet, we'll see)
Custom ROMs have proven that it's possible to make fonts changeable without root.
I don't care, I miss windows Aero 😭😭
Yes, I bought an adapter.
No, it's not supported 😭😭😭😭
Might as well blur it lightly
No thank you.

I love accent colours, especially if they change.
I don't, because I use Swift Dark, so I get them.
It's neat, I personally don't care much about it. I cared about notification channels, PiP, and OMS.

It's like a bunch of nougat changes I didn't care about, like the doze update, because I cared about multiwindow so much (I really wanted multiwindow from the very first day with an iPod Touch 4G. I got it through closed for a while but it wasn't a good solution, I needed something native. Now there's multiwindow and there's floating windows too, like with sentio).
No, what I did was make the almost white FFFFFE also be 254/255 (99.607%) transparent. 
I'm pretty sure it can. It can round the corners of recents tabs.
The only inconsistencies in icons that bother me are size and style. If they're both material style, and they're the same size, no more inconsistencies bother me. Colour it however you want, and give it any shape you want. With shapes, I actually find inconsistency an upside.
No, but that is how RGBA hex codes work.
I simply refused to consume matzot last passover. My plan is the same for this year. I'll have to just not eat much, because potato and corn stuff isn't made very often by my family (with whom I live)
True, true. That's why I **nearly** starved, because some potato and corn starch is used by my family, plus, as Sephardics, they eat rice.
I'm sure.

That doesn't make me want it.

I want icons to have unique shapes that fit the icon. Exactly the way it was until Nougat (I do love nougat though).
And stay forever.
The last update I was really excited about was Nougat thanks to its native multi window (I LOVE it and use it all the time).

Oreo was good because of OMS so that I could finally get that dark mode I wanted (I have an LCD, not an OLED) without voiding the warranty, and the notification channels which will be really nice when they're more widely adopted.
Why? There's OMS.
Don't worry, substratum works rootlessly since Oreo, so you can install P and still have your system not look like absolute shit.
Oreo's native support for OMS is good enough. Andromeda + Substratum will fix this mess.
EW... Stop backgrounding everything! Let the icons keep their shapes! Learn from [Sony!](https://i.imgur.com/442RAhc.jpg) (ignore the transparent background, that's my substratum theme. Focus on the settings icons, as they're unmodified (and I think they're perfect this way))
Substratum will fix the shitty icons. Substratum will fix the iOS-like tiny grab bar. I like the way the gap is. Which can also be fixed with substratum.

Basically, Android 8.0 fixes everything, including P.

Good thing I got icon packs, and I won't have a stupid frame around the WhatsApp icon.
Matzot... I wanna vomit...

I nearly starved, but I managed to fundamentally break Passover by not consuming any Matzah for the whole duration of Passover.

This passover I'll still have to keep. Not by choice, it's just impossible to find any chametz in Israel if you can't drive to an Arab village (no car). Neither one of my parents would be okay with me storing bread for use during passover (as that's the way non religious people eat on passover - stored chametz), or pasta, or anything else.

Next passover, just like next Yom Kippur, I plan on having a bacon cheeseburger, and also just 100% bakes for the whole first day of passover.

A day without dough is a wasted day.

Edit: I work within walking distance of an Arab village.

I can walk to a non kosher pizza hut there. Yes! I have figured out how to obtain normal food!!!!
Ohhhh, I see, thanks!

Hmm, I wonder how you know autonotification so well 😉
Google's going to require all apps going forward from November to target API 26?! Wtf?! That is AMAZING? Yes Google, exactly, this is how you start to eliminate fragmentation!

I also love how they're doing a play store limit, and NOT an Android limit - if I want to try an app targeting API 19 for some reason, the option should be available. However, public, widely used apps must all target new APIs.
I don't think he will... He charges money for autoapps.

Hopefully he'll improve the design.
The Next Genocide?
It's more like I'm not sure and prefer not to think about whether it's okay or not because people shouldn't feel entitled to attraction towards them, only to human respect, so I don't need to worry about it.
No, because I'm not American and I don't use the carrier's firmware 😉
Yeah, when it's in the kernel, it works properly.

I don't get why hypercube Israel says "polan"?

It's "Polin"... If you wanna get it wrong, get it wrong right!

Can't you use url shrinking?
Of course! God is all knowing, an all knowing being obviously needs people to be careful with its name.
Are 4-8GB of ram not enough? How about 64 gigabytes *of storage* if storage was the issue?

😂😂😂 DA JOOS don't want people to stay a part of them, so they made me leave! Blame THE JOOS for making me leave THE JOOS!
Heavily patriotic Zionists are mildly annoying to me (since I'm not feeling any patriotism - Israel is nice, but I feel no attachment) but apart from the extremists, that's about it.

I know you were sarcastic by the way, I just wanted to express my experience.
Only Judaism is also a religion with a very similar creation story and science is also not in line with Judaism (I wouldn't have left it otherwise, probably), just like Islam.

Those idiots blaming the Jews are so, so stupid...
Nobody actually cares about the ramifications of the story (plus it's likely not real), so I just celebrate in a secular manner and ignore.

I've thought about this a long time ago, but I decided to just ignore it.
😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣😥😥😢😢😢😭😭😭😭
What did you do while you were AFK?
That's priceless 😂😂😂

I did the same on my Bible studies at school - I wrote יהוה instead of אלוהים all the time. Not just in quotes, but also in my answers! 😂😂😂
Yes. Holland and Holland.
Okay, ignore the holidays too then!

The most annoying part is all of us who are affected but don't live in the US.

No US senator represents us, obviously. At the same time, we will be affected by whether your congress does that overrule or not.

Low countries can obviously be said in Hebrew but it doesn't mean Netherlands for sure.
So Häkunä Määttä was Finnish all along? That explains Timon and Pumbaa's behaviour. They're wasted!
Then those minorities should wait until the other party reaches 18 and then they can do whatever they want.
I agree, but only up to 18. From 18, everything is unlocked. So should sex. So, you can't date a 40 year old if you're 17, but feel free to date one once you turn 18, because then you're considered responsible for yourself.
In Hebrew we actually call the entire Netherlands Holland.
Someone should make a comic with only easy to draw countries.
Is that you as an American saying the plural of "me", or United States? 😎
It should be allowed like other religious symbols.

It shouldn't have any special exemption though. That's messed up.
Sure there's nothing ultimately waiting for us.

I have learnt to just not worry about it. There's nothing I can do about there being no inherent purpose to life. Might as well just make one up and enjoy, since I'm here and have the opportunity to do so.

I can do something about me not being satisfied with my current situation - work towards changing it (which is what I'm doing and have already done to some degree). I consistently reach one goal after another and just don't give up because I know my target. So I do.
What is the guarantee? The fact that ultimately it is under your control. As for when - only you can figure that out, each person's life is different.

If it's under your control, it means that you ultimately have the power to live a free life - just the way you want to. Let yourself fantasize. Daydream about what you want. Keep your goal clear in front of you, and start constructing a bunch of smaller goals leading up to it.
And what if you manage to live through the hardship? What keeps me going all the time is my mental image of me going outside in a city in Australia, eating a bacon cheeseburger, speaking to friends, working a job which I'm overall happy with, with vacations now and then... And now I'm working towards that goal. Knowing that as long as I'm alive, I can still reach that goal? That's fuel for a LOT of hardships.

As long as you're alive, you can become free and live a satisfying life eventually. Only if you stay alive though, and not give up. The time for calmness will come, but it's worthless if you don't wait until the time for calmness comes by giving up instead. It simply won't satisfy you. The only thing that will really satisfy you is reaching the life you want to live.
Only if you ship with it, not if you upgrade.
Sony does shit right.
It works fine on my 10 USD headphones. They're connected to 2 devices at the same time.
I think that being selective in your dating choices is in a moral gray area. Calling it OK is too much, calling it not okay is not enough. It's somewhere in between

Not so great great grandparents.
"all Goyim are beneath us" was an immoral but potent tactic used to keep Jewish communities isolated.
How about star wars? There are quite a few Jedis and some are probably unironic.

And don't need to make excuses. Live your life however you feel like living it, please. As someone who only believes in one life, I really want you to not waste it.
Stop saying weekdays then. In fact, stop keeping the Sabbath - "kow could I possibly keep on counting tke weekdays wken tkey're all named after goyisk gods? I will kave to no longer recognise tke weekdays"

Oh, simple.

Modern Hebrew doesn't have a J sound either, and I'm speaking from personal experience. It's only used in adopted foreign words. No originally Hebrew word contains that sound. Some old people can't properly pronounce J, actually.
That's more than the LTE home plan for the company I work for (they offer normal, truly unlimited DSL service/ISP only, ISP only for cable internet, and fiber optics, but also use their LTE antennae (and it's amazing honestly, I get upwards of 40MB while moving) with a 500GB plan).

With 1000GB I might not even need broadband internet at all.
That's exactly what I meant. "Any" means "not apple owned"

The stupid part is that they don't realise it's the same exact money.
They work everywhere else though.

I haven't had a problem with bands. Ever. I'm from Israel.

It's a similar thing all over Europe and Asia too, I believe.
How much does the SIM only equivalent of that plan cost? 60GB sounds yummy.
And it's likely that the rush to get 64 bit was part of what made the 810 so shitty.
At this point when you have no warranty there's nothing to lose really.
The theme colour isn't part of the CSS scraping. It was implemented a long time ago, before we knew it was possible to scrape CSS data. 

All you need to do is scrape the images for the upvote and downvote buttons, keep the current ones as a default, and otherwise replace it with those. If /u/ccrama could do it with flairs, they could do it with voting buttons, and subscriber/online counts of subreddits.

It'd be very highly appreciated if so 😊
Might wanna check it out now!
Ah! Awesome! It must work by location, because my phone is actually in English AU (I want my phone to be in English, not Hebrew, and some apps display imperial measurements if I use US English). I'm really glad that they thought of that, it would've annoyed me like hell if it didn't shift.

Obviously depicting snow at any point is inaccurate to you as an Australian, but it still generally fits season-wise, just like here (where it doesn't snow).

Also, since we don't have a wintry image for January (new year's is what we get), I'm curious to see what you have on your June image!
Uninstall+reinstall? Unrooted, that's as far as you can go, although rooting and installing Magisk might actually fix it thanks to the advanced hiding technologies behind Magisk.
I guess Snapchat's detection is too sensitive now, detecting unrooted users.

Busybox is a root-only utility, ported over from Linux.
Ikr? Plus, Magisk is open source.

Slide for Reddit is an app that implements CSS scraping. That's a great way to get that.

I think that independence is one of the most important values a child should learn.

If what you're doing causes a dependency, then I think you should figure out how to avoid that.
And the way to get over that is education - teach your children how to stay safe - smart browsing, and trust them that they'll implement the safety measures you teach to them.

I had free access to the internet since the age of 6. I wasn't allowed it very often, but it was never limited. My parents taught me how to stay safe and trusted me to keep away from inappropriate/unsafe things.
I feel like restrictions are usually poor/lazy parenting.

The child should have self responsibility. If there's no trust, then they can't be responsible for what they do on their phones - their parents control it instead. It doesn't teach independence, it teaches the child that the parent is into control.

If my parents restricted my devices in any way - this is how I'd feel. And then bypass the restriction. No one can block me.

I would feel annoyed and unappreciated if my parents restricted my phone though, despite me bypassing that.
As someone with a 960fps capable phone: it's not hard at all to miss that.
What matters is that you can now
It has no downsides. You can still plug in USB C audio, and Bluetooth if you want to.
I'd rather have a fingerprint sensor on the side than Sony ditching the perfect placement for one single country.
It's with a new aspect ratio though... There won't be any actual increase in size.
Yeah, I find Solid Explorer much better for actual file browsing.
Nope!

I bought Java and Android, but the W10 edition came for free to me.
Modded, and hey, no worries, I'm used to people not being native in English, I'm from a natively Hebrew speaking area (even though I'm native in both)
In my mind you should mod instead of cheating - this way you're tweaking it to your wishes.
But why not combine them in a flying machine? I know those exist in Minecraft.
Let me correct myself: the Marine of Netanya is gorgeous for those who love the sea, but the rest of the city is... Nothing special.
Why not? There are sponges and flying machines in the bedrock edition
And never - but there's a Bedrock Edition MC in the Microsoft store.
So?
Minecraft is anything you want it to be.
Pepe the frog!
I don't mind Judaism dying off either. I would mind Jewish people dying off as they're humans.

If it ended violently I'd be very upset about the loss of human life.
Radiator Valley from Pixar's Cars
It never looked that great in reality (I'm from Israel)... This is impressive though!
Heh. Our fatest DSL speeds are 100/3.
I'm not from that area of the world, I don't know much about the languages there... I know there are over 20.
I'm not American
For me the problem with not owning the phone in my possession is that I can't unlock it - which is why I'll never consider buying from a carrier.
They don't realise their savings when they can just threaten to leave the carrier to get a cheaper deal - as the phone is unlocked.
I paid 650, I don't care about the camera, I'm not American so my fingerprint sensor works perfectly (and is in the perfect position), and I care a lot about the 635 SoC. I was more than satisfied with my OnePlus One's camera. I didn't need an upgrade to my camera. As far as I'm concerned, my phone is on par with any 2017 flagship, surpassing some, even (on the updates department, for example).

Do you seriously not realise that there are other countries in the world?

I wouldn't recommend this phone to many people, but it fits me wonderfully.
Wow. One part of that survey really hit close to home. I nearly shed a tear.

I'm not gonna give up though, I'm too hopeful.

Done, btw. All of those community questions were problematic. It's a national thing. My parents are part of the majority, there's no community. (Edit: I'm referring to Israel, of course)
If you make a call to me through voLTE, you will pay international call rates.
That's exactly what I meant...
Aha, I see
What you're getting is comparable to what you're paying though.
Yeah, Hebrew and all (well, not religion. I left Judaism). My flair says "Australia soon" because I plan on moving, but for now I'm still in Israel.
Ohh! Sonic Advance 2! So underrated! I play it all on emulators btw

We don't have volte and hd voice. Also, they're billed normally - like regular phone calls.
Woah, woah, I only know 2 words in Finnish!
The OG Pixel is an exception.

Also, the GBA is so much better than the GBC... It feels like a whole new level of fun.
Make it so.
I don't think that's the reason, I think it's because Germany and Israel are diplomatic allies. A mutually beneficial alliance, which is not purely based on guilt.
Uhhh... I've seen plenty of Germans here and they enjoy falafels. They seem amused by the culture here. Definitely existent.
Regarding your username...

Gameboy, or Gameboy Advance?
Same shit. Not exactly, but close enough.
If disabling it in software isn't enough then it must be something other than a patent - Sony's been doing it until now and it worked fine.

If option 5 isn't viable, then that leaves us with options 1-4.

Option 2 is ignored because it's obviously ridiculous.
Data collection is another way of earning their revenue, so is licensing their services to businesses.
It's really nice of you to elaborate what kind of proof he gave, despite my trust, it feels better to know what kind of proof he provided.
And then multi boot it with an OS dedicated to video calls - Dou OS, an OS dedicated to emojis - Emotion OS, an OS dedicated to group chats - Together OS, an OS dedicated to private messages - Allo OS, and of course, and OS dedicated to SMS. It's 5-in-1! Who wouldn't want to buy this? It's genius!
[Port this to the Fuschia Kernel? Absolutely. We need that software.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/android/images/9/92/Android_2.0_Screenshot.png/revision/latest/thumbnail-down/width/320/height/480?cb=20160215215313)
I'm angry that they moved their sensor from the perfect position just for one country which they won't succeed in anyways.

Otherwise, I'm okay with this change. Not thrilled, but okay.
Yeah, and despite how hard the American market is to enter, they still decided to ruin the fingerprint sensor for all of us non Americans (by moving it to the back)
It didn't need to ditch an otherwise (aside from the bezels) good design for that. Sony could've easily had wireless charging in the XZ Premium, for example.
Oh right, thanks.
And I want a large, still water resistant Sony phone - with a removable plastic back (and therefore a replaceable battery).

I'm obviously not gonna have one, because that'd be ruining it for whoever wants their phones to look "premium".

We all have to make *some* compromises. I'm sure that many non American people are very upset and might stop buying Sony phones because of this move.

I might still choose Sony again after this, but I find their phones less good because of this.

Sony could've (and should've) just stayed irrelevant in the USA. They're niche phones anyway, and your market is both saturated and hard to enter.
Option 4: Continue selling it with a deactivated sensor in the USA for whoever wants Sony phones there, this way they're not ruining that sensor for everyone else.

Option 5: Pay the price to sort out the contract/patent, so that they can legally stop deactivating the side sensor.
Back mounted sensors have enough options. Side mounted sensors do not. It's basically just razer phone at this point (which I wouldn't get since it doesn't support OTG)
And there are 199 other countries, in all of which there's no issue shipping with a sensor on the side.

95% of the world is not American.
Still, I don't trust carriers to not bill me for something they can bill. Texting overseas will probably still carry the same charge, same goes for images and videos, rendering RCS useless.
I was talking about the top and bottom bezels, plus, wireless charging doesn't need it on the back.
You do NOT need to ditch the side sensor for wireless charging, less bezels, or keeping the front facing speakers. All of these can be done with the sensor where it belongs.
An on screen fingerprint sensor is a worth replacement for the side, but the back? It's better than the front bezel, but still...
There's no alternative though, so it doesn't really matter.

I bought my phone knowing fully well that its value will not be 650 USD in 2020.
Just flash international firmware. Either way, I think they should just focus on Europe and Asia, instead of giving up the perfect sensor placement.
Sign in ~~hindu~~ Hindi
I'm left handed and it works just fine. I just use my right thumb or left index. If it's on a table facing up, then I use my left thumb.

The moment you scan more than one finger, everything works fine.

If you don't like it on the side, get a OnePlus 5T - they have near stock Android and a back fingerprint sensor. It's not a bad placement (unlike the bottom front bezel), but it's not as good as the side.
Nah. No need. Just give me the fingerprint sensor power button back to the side.
Eh... I don't mind that, but I'm happy with it in the top left corner, too.
Sony's already a niche. They should fully embrace that, as they're not going to have mainstream success.
Then those people have lots of other brands to choose from!
So we need to lose the perfect placement because of one, single country?
They ditched the side sensor!!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭
Hopefully, soon I'll be able to start saying Hebrew names and places while speaking English.

Currently, voice typing is totally useless for anything local besides navigating to Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. 
If you'd instantly have a child whose looks are correlated to the quality of your last sex, I'd still have no child at all.
I know it works over the internet. That doesn't matter.

It's billable by the carrier, therefore it will be billed.

Why would a carrier make any sort of effort to implement a system if it can't reap money off of it? If no one uses it then whatever. That's the way carriers are in Israel right now, by the way. They have completely surrendered ripping customers off for texting to WhatsApp. Whoever's stupid enough to not use WhatsApp is still billed ludicrous amounts of money for anything beyond a text message within Israel (so if there's an image - that'll cost you, if you're texting, say, Egypt/Jordan (the closest non enemy countries), that'll cost you too). However, the carriers except most people to just use WhatsApp and they're not trying to fight it (net neutrality is still a thing here btw).

Getting sued? Why? They're not breaking the law, they're just assholes.
Absolutely true.

Everyone I know uses WhatsApp. This includes iPhone users. It's not even a question. If the contact doesn't show up on WhatsApp, we assume that the number is wrong.
Because those can't be billed by your carrier. RCS can.
Because if it goes through the carrier, it can be billed by the carrier, which means it would cost a lot to many people (including myself).
People are probably using automated scripts
Then there's no consent and we're back to square one. Just the way it should be.
Yeah. Leave the children to their own devices - let them get their genitalia operated on if they want to as adults. 

That's what it means.

No one's against circumcision here, the only issue is if it's done to a non consenting person, rather than to a consenting adult. It's just like I think tattoos should be 18+. It's permanent stuff. Do it if you want to, but no one else may make that decision. Only you.
A medical reason or consent, obviously. Idk why it doesn't mention consent, but I think an adult should be allowed to completely annihilate their genitalia if they want to for some reason.
I agree so much. Every single word.
Exactly. I'm sure that Iceland has nothing against an adult getting themselves circumcised.
**A**~~n~~ iShill
It does that sometimes with Hebrew even though the app developer didn't ask for it. The translations are terrible. I'm really glad I keep my phone in English, this way I don't see those horrifying auto translations.

It's not even bad Hebrew - even first graders don't write that way.
XZ Premium

The fingerprint sensor placement, and the unlockable bootloader. Also, I was always impressed by the performance of Sony phones I saw, so I wanted one.
Direct debit means that when you pay the money is taken off immediately instead of at the end of the month
They know.

They're locked into some business contract probably.

Look, if you're not gonna buy them as an American then don't. I'm not an American and I bought a fully functional Sony phone myself.
Yes, I did. Then I started working a full time job - I basically just threw myself in and it worked.

There's no way to gain experience other than experiencing life. Go ahead and start.
I'm in Israel and the first time I've seen an NFC credit card system is when I went to visit Austria. For some reason, NFC payments don't exist here. At all. And it's not like Israel doesn't use NFC - our public transport cards have RFID tags, and our credit cards do, too, but there's no terminal that reads credit cards...
What exactly do you mean by switching to an online bank?

Do you know if direct debit MasterCard/Visa cards are possible to obtain through such banks? I really don't want to bother with credit if I can avoid it while still being able to make online payments.
Sometimes my parents think that everything revolves around Judaism. My wish to leave Israel, not for ideological reasons, was a big shake to my father, where my life - something he deeply cares about (in a good way - he loves me) isn't revolving around Judaism, and Judaism is ignored in my life choices. I don't bring non kosher foods into his house not because I care - I don't, I'm doing it only out of respect for him. I don't mind that, but I am not willing to let my father and his mother live in an illusion that I do things for Judaism. I do things for them. I don't respect the Friday night blessings, I respect them. That's why I stand up quietly during them. I'm happy to make them feel satisfied, but that's the sole reason I do these things.
I'm seriously addicted, I don't pause enough in the "bed".
Get you post on this job
You'll never satisfy such strict people, just stop trying and do whatever makes you happy.
It's subjective, why don't you get that already?!

I find the uniqueness great, you don't... It's a matter of opinion...
Oh man it's been long since I've used it
I really love how the main focus of the show is on the human part. I think that's unique for a sci-fi show (the only other show I know that really does this in a non overly serious manner - as in truly, is The Orville).
Judging by their schedule, it's way more than 9 out of 10. Like, 9.5-9.7/10
He's not in a better place. He's still in your head though. Now he's no longer outside of your head, only in it, but still - your memories of him are part of what he is, and what's left of him.

It's useful against NPCs like honey bees, they don't get such anti-debuff measures.
I always thought of how ridiculous that is, as it's not resting.
It makes perfect sense, I just don't exactly follow how could that be achieved, beyond regular integration efforts. What I mean by that, is that I think the solution to the European immigrant problem is integration. After all, even if Europe was full of immigrants, if they're probably integrated, it wouldn't ruin the European way of life. Europe will still be wonderful, only the people will be more diverse.
Sounds like a time sorta thing. I also felt guilty about stuff when I left Judaism. I don't anymore.

Time will fix this.
What's your opinion on urban planning? I'm curious.
Maybe it's a 'sign' 😉
That's part of the reason I got a Sony phone. I'm very satisfied so far. It does anything I want it to.
What's your favourite flavour of ice cream? What do you know about Hebrew?
At least you don't need to pay for birth control
Who cares if you change your mind or not? Unlike having children, there are no consequences to not having children.
Sounds like you really dodged a bullet by not having a baby with him.
Let's hope for OP that she has the same condition. Perfect, 100% effective, built in birth control? Sign me up!
That's just a bonus
They just wanna make biological babies and not worry about it. How incredibly irresponsible 
You mean definitely
Wow, if I've ever seen entitlement, that is it.

They expect you to carry out a whole pregnancy for them and they're not willing to even consider adoption? I loved your point about vanity. So true.
Probably because of the title
Exactly. She matters FAR more than /r/Christianity. Most of them will be fine even if you anger them a little. They'd get over it and continue living happy, Christian lives. Not OP though.
What do you have to gain by coming out to her?
Whereas today 3.5mm headphone jacks are removed
I love that show!
It's not a lie because OP wouldn't be saying she'd consider it, she's simply stating the fact that it would work. It's misleading and true.
Stop her from harming others?
This reminds me of the church scene in Kingsman - "I am having Congress out of wedlock with my black, Jewish boyfriend, who works at a military abortion clinic, so hail Satan, and have a lovely afternoon, madam". 
I kinda feel like this person is likely to not see lesbians as humans with feelings that deserve human respect like everyone else.
Wow that's limiting... I've never heard of a situation this limited...
They're more than vectors... They're full on matrices!
Then just refer them to their complaints about their children, and how often you're happy and satisfied compared to them.
Whatever, nobody's really hurt if OP is as careful as she says she is.
Really dodged a bullet there
What feels good is that OP dodged a bullet, not that the ex ruined his life.
No, no, you're supposed to do it, to carry out God's punishment for those women.

If you don't do it, then your self control and decency are more powerful than the biblical god - the so called omnipotent being.
I'm pretty certain that no matter what you do, if they'll think anything positive about you, they'll directly attribute it to Christianity regardless of what you tell them about belief. "God is opening her heart to Jesus Christ slowly, to not scare her". Something like that.

Regardless of what you do, good luck. They sound like wonderful people in spite of their strong belief... Imagining how wonderful they'd be without such an extreme religious approach is phenomenal.
I'm pretty sure he's obligated to keep on asking indefinitely unless OP agrees to convert, with absolutely nothing convincing him to leave her alone, with any rational attempts at doing so being considered a direct attack on their religion and on them.
You're not op though.

You and I would not be able to handle it. OP is much more resistant.
That's a recipe for boredom...
> It's **like** some scribe

Haha yeah, those people would never admit that that's exactly what the Bible is!

People actually record these and label them under some label yet they still refuse to put 1+1 together... "If the Bible is written exactly as a collection of ancient texts, and you need to find an explanation for why it is so, maybe the explanation is that it's a collection of ancient texts???", But no, they do mental gymnastics to find other explanations and call the people who find those other explanations geniuses.
Cue my family's cries about anti-Semitism...

Sadly I know there's no way they'll realise it's nothing against Jews or Judaism in particular, it's purely that this particular practice is not permissible in modern society under such conditions (non consent)
What if it does serve a purpose - making OP happy/satisfied?

I mean, that won't compel me to do it, but it might compel OP, for a good reason.
Sounds similar to my plans for next Yom Kippur.

I plan on being on my connection flight as I move to Australia, already out of Israel, riding a bus (I have no licence, and motored vehicles are a huge taboo on Yom Kippur, nobody drives in Israel, seriously, other than unmotored bicycles and such), eating (not allowed on Yom Kippur) a bacon (non kosher) cheeseburger (separately non kosher). I'm probably not gonna be able to have sex (another thing that's not allowed on Yom Kippur) in a shower (yet another thing that's not allowed on Yom Kippur), but I could shower right after the bacon cheeseburger I guess, so, close enough.
Does anyone remember the smart movement mod?
I don't need to know what you want. There is a modpack that'll fit no matter what.
