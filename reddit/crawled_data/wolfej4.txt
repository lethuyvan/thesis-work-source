I've had this issue a few times. Mostly I switch the USB port and it tends to fix it. Otherwise try uninstalling Elgato completely and reinstall it.
Is there anything else you remember?
At least the same position button does the same on both Xbox and PlayStation. Nintendo on the other hand, I have to look to make sure I hit the proper button.
LG makes some pretty kickass ultrawides. My first is a 34" and I'm using my 29" right now, both under $350.

As long as you're playing an Xbox 360 title on Xbox One, you can.
I had someone near me start talking to me. So I asked for a picture since he didn't have one. He kept going on about the things he wanted me to do to him and I got weirded out so I blocked him on Grindr. He messaged me on Scruff and told me I had a fake Mazda or some shit which scared me to death because he probably knows where I live now.

My dad died back in 2013, back when the only AH videos I watched were the Minecraft every Friday. He died on a Sunday so the next video didn't come out for some time. That Friday's episode was episode 55 - Creeper Soccer. Otherwise known as the "Bucket" episode.

Just like Jeremy, I was laughing so hard. My mom ran into my room to try to console me because she thought I was crying but I couldn't stop laughing and I haven't stopped laughing since.

My dad was my rock and it still hurts knowing he's not here but not only RT and AH but the community has a whole, the crew on Twitch and Twitter and getting to talk to them - it feels like this giant family and I love it.

Shout-out to /u/jerem6401
I bought the game the day it was released into game preview. It was cheaper than I anticipated so while I'm not ecstatic about it, I'm not exactly unhappy. It's a fun game and I want to support the devs. I've been pretty active in the alphas and betas and I would like to see the game succeed.
Fade into Darkness is a good one. Seek Bromance had one of my all time favorite music videos.

His most recent stuff is pretty good too imo. Alunageorge posted a short story about her experience with him for her song and I cried. 
Not a specific one, but if you go to "My Applets" then Create, just do location first with the specific address then choose SMS for the second option.

Just setup the 29" version myself. It's my second ultrawide now, with the one in flair being my first. The 34" is on the floor right now because I couldn't find a way to accommodate it on my desk and I was expecting a new desk yesterday.
Car under $3000. I can't not have my music while I drive. I can't even listen to the radio.
Not to mention this is the first death on a US airline in 9 years.
I cried. Legit. I feel like I had the same reaction to Geoff's story that he has when other people tell him their struggles with alcoholism, like he said on the podcast. I know AH can act like assholes to each other and there are few real moments like this but damn I'd be lying if I said it's not moving.

Spread the love guys. We all could use it <3
Can I ask what kind of table top you have?
Do you live in a Ray Bradbury book?
I don't know why but I love setups like this, having a small screen right at desk level. Might have to give this a shot myself.
I took the weights from LGs website. One of them included the weight without the stand and the other was with. I assume I could use a similar weight because the stand is also pretty hefty. 

And the Linnmon is 59". I decided I'm going to mount the second monitor on the wall and use the included base for the other. Hopefully that alleviates any issues.

Thank you for the reply.

If I was a betting man, I'd say that's the company he works for. I remember a post from a while ago where the comments discussed it but he said he wasn't advertising.

That's pretty much the gist of it but I checked out the website and am definitely intrigued by the product.
Friend of mine just bought an AR-15. He's a sheriff's deputy so I guess he's using it as a duty weapon. When he wanted to buy it, the question was saving money by going to a dealer, saving money and waiting the three days or getting it somewhere else and getting it the same day. He hasn't even used the damn thing yet. I don't get the rush.

We had this happen at my friend's house a couple years ago. We drove up to Tennessee (we live in Florida) and a friend left a Mountain Dew or something in the freezer when we got there so it would get cold quickly (I know it doesn't work but didn't bother saying anything).

A few minutes after we all woke up the next morning, we hear a quiet thunk from the freezer. It took us a second to realize what it was and when we opened the freezer, it looked exactly like OPs picture.

9 times out of 10, if there's someone in the left turning lane, they're pulled up way too far and I have to wait for the light or risk getting my front bumper sheared off.

Then there's the asshole who needlessly pulls up as I pull up as if doing so will make the light change faster.
Sort of related, but my dad passed after we went to go see Iron Man 3 in theaters. For a while I referred to it as my favorite Marvel movie until just a couple days ago when I rewatched it and realized how much I disliked it. But the memories of me and my dad going out to watch it still remain.

A bit farther west actually. Okaloosa Island. 
Gun control is more comprehensive background checks, mental health evaluations, etc. This also includes the banning of accessories (in this case, bump stocks) which increase the effectiveness of the weapon. Changes in age restrictions - in some places you could be 18 and buy a rifle but had to be 21 to buy a pistol (with exemptions if your employer requires you to carry a weapon).

The thing about gun control is there is no "one-size-fits-all." There is no one thing we can do - whether it be introducing or changing laws or societal changes - to stop gun violence.
Saw a comment on Facebook of his and he was arguing with a guy named Brandon Wolf - a survivor of the Pulse shooting.

>In the comments section of the Facebook post, someone managing King's Facebook page sparred with Brandon Wolf, one of the survivors of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida.

>"When it was my community, where were you?" Wolf asked. "When it was Sandy Hook? Columbine? Were you on the sideline mocking those communities too? Did you question someone identifying as a mother? Did you question whether people like me were crisis actors?"

>Wolf added: "Emma stood for 6 mins and 20 seconds to honor the lives of 17 gone too soon. The least you could do is shut your privileged, ineffective trap for 6 seconds to hear someone else's perspective."

Speaking from experience serving alcohol in Florida (as the laws vary by states), use your passport as an ID when buying drinks as most places here don't accept other IDs issued internationally.
And in more conservative areas, don't request a cigarette from someone, or as OP likely knows it, "bumming a fag"
Jelly, jam, and Jell-O are different here, too.
Easiest way to do it is to move the decimal left one number and double it.

An old ex of my friend's did that. He tried dating a guy online maybe 10 years ago who lived in St Louis, we live in Florida. Tried to break up with him but the guy said he was going to kill himself. He never did and actually moved to the same county a couple years ago with his now ex. He's happily married now and we're all good friends. 
An old co-worker and friend of mine was murdered similarly. Some dude started working with us and he was attracted to her. They went out a few times. It took a turn when she said she didn't need help dealing with a customer and he got angry. He started texting and calling her non-stop some pretty scary things. She had to get a restraining order against him but he never stopped. I was so scared for her. 

He waited in her room for her to get home. When she tried to run, he stabbed her in the neck. She was dead more than 24 hours before anyone knew. Fucker used her cellphone to text a few of us telling us she was okay when she didn't come in for work.

It's added convenience. They always know where each other's keys are supposed to be in case one needs to use the other's. And if it's by the front door, chances they forget them are pretty slim. There's a few benefits of having a key rack, even one that just holds two sets.

If the tools screen can be opened via a combination of key presses, Crtl+V to paste for example, then yes.

I'm playing around with it right now and it seems it only recognizes single key presses or combinations containing shift, control, or alt.

They did add the ability to add text, so adding a signature would be possible, yes. You would have to position the cursor in the correct place, but again is definitely possible now.

I primarily use my Stream Deck for streaming and so far the only shortcuts I have are to open OBS, Spotify, Photoshop, and Steam, but I haven't added shortcuts or hotkeys yet.

Strictly in regards of general PC usage, you can program the buttons to open websites, alternate hotkeys (like pressing once would copy, pressing the second time would paste), open programs, add text, or control music (previous, play/pause, next, volume up, down and mute).

If any of you guys have questions, feel free to hit me up. Helping people with technology is one of my favorite things to do.
There's also "smart profiles" which change the buttons automatically based on what program you're using.

Quick notes:

Dick's did *suspend* sales of the AR-15 and like guns after Sandy Hook, only to begin selling them again in their Field & Stream stores.

This move is permanent according to the CEO. It applies to both Dick's and Field & Stream and is directly related to the shooting in Parkland.

>“When we saw what happened in Parkland, we were so disturbed and upset,” Mr. Stack said in an interview Tuesday evening. “We love these kids and their rallying cry, ‘enough is enough.’ It got to us.”

>He added, “If the kids in Parkland are being brave enough to stand up and do this, we can be brave enough to stand up with them.”

Is it possible to use an HD60 and HD60S in OBS simultaneously?
I currently have an HD60 S with the HD60 sitting in my drawer right now. I much prefer the HD60 S for streaming, but the HD60 is not impossible. There is a help guide on Elgato's website that tells you what you should set the delay to sync with everything.
Adding lines to your buttons used to work but they took that out.

Best thing would be to find a short way to put it on the button or make an icon using the icon maker. https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/keycreator

That makes total sense because Michael says, "I wanna see you bounce."

>Dear Mr. Wolfe,

>Thank you for taking the time to express your thoughts regarding the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) internet regulations commonly referred to as "net neutrality." Understanding your views helps me better represent Florida in the United States Senate, and I appreciate the opportunity to respond.

>Since its inception, the Internet has flourished with minimal government involvement and has revolutionized our ability to communicate and conduct commerce. It provides businesses with the ability to compete in the global marketplace and is an engine of economic growth. Continued development of the Internet and modern telecommunications, free of excessive and overly burdensome government regulations, is key to American innovation.

>On February 26, 2015, the FCC voted 3-2 to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications utility under Title II of the Communications Act. The 332-page regulation was called “net neutrality,” referencing the concept of preventing internet service providers (ISPs) from creating “fast lanes” and “slow lanes” for different content. This regulation effectively transferred power from ISPs to the federal government, and threatened to overregulate the Internet in a way that would make it more expensive, less innovative and less competitive. The 2015 Open Internet Order was not made available to the public until weeks after the vote.

>On April 26, 2017, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to roll back the 2015 regulation. Chairman Pai has made a concerted effort to have an open and transparent process in an attempt to reverse the previous FCC’s trend of closed door, private and unilateral rulemaking. On May 18, 2017, the FCC voted 3-2 to make the NPRM official. This initiated a three-month comment period, which ended on August 30, and allowed all stakeholders to have the time to read the order, form their opinions and voice their support or opposition. 

>The regulations of ISPs will once again be overseen by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). On December 11, 2017, the FTC and FCC announced their intent to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) under which the two agencies will coordinate to ensure that online consumer protection efforts are enforced. In addition to reverting authority back to the traditional agency of jurisdiction, the order increases transparency requirements, which provides another tool to punish bad actors. Under the prior rules, investment had chilled due to uncertainty and confusion about what activity the FCC would deem to be in violation. The roll back of this utility-style regulation will encourage greater broadband investment while releasing ISPs, particularly smaller rural companies, from burdensome rules and uncertainty.

>Now that the order has been reversed, I believe modernizing the 1996 Communications Act should be a top priority for Congress, and would clarify the FCC's role in the modern communications landscape. Congress must create a level regulatory playing field that protects consumers and encourages innovation.  

>It is an honor and a privilege to serve you as your United States Senator. I will keep your thoughts in mind as I consider these issues and continue working to ensure America remains a safe and prosperous nation.

>Sincerely,  
>Marco Rubio  
>United States Senator

I bloody love driving, though. Especially by myself. Last April, I went to Lakeland for Sun N Fun, Orlando to see Panic!

[These](https://www.carid.com/2014-mazda-3-fog-lights/spyder-fog-lights-347136728.html?parentsubmodel[]=SUBMODEL|Sedan) are the ones I have. I just had to buy a new turn signal switch [from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AWO7XOK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

I had a theme going on with [my car](https://imgur.com/jnnIGRM.png).
Fog lights were the easiest upgrade I've done to my car. After I found out it was already wired, all I had to do was buy a new turn signal indicator with the switch and it took minutes to install and they look badass. The worst part is now they've both cracked and one of the trim pieces fell off, so I might buy some replacements here soon.

I've seen this happen twice. Once back in 2010 or 2011 in Ormond Beach, sometime at night a guy made a left turn too soon and ended up in oncoming traffic. I called 911 and they pulled him over in the Walmart parking lot. 

More recently driving down a relatively new stretch of road north of Niceville, FL, an SUV was coming at me on a split highway. Fortunately I was already in the right lane and he was in the left. I honked my horn and flashed my lights but he did the same so I don't know what was going on with that guy.

This happened to me back in October. I went to see my grandparents on literally the other side of the country (WA, I live in FL). On my way to the airport on my way back home, I got a text from a coworker asking where I was at.

The manager only puts the schedule up a few days before the week starts and put it up while I was gone. I asked a coworker for it so I had it the days I would be home but didn't really look at it. They scheduled me the entire day I was travelling back home and I wasn't going to be home until midnight. They only ever scheduled me to work nights.

A few weeks later they took me off the schedule completely because another coworker that was supposed to take my shift didn't show up. Fuck that place.

You are correct, using the Xbox app you can stream your Xbox to PC over Wi-Fi. There's a slight lag. It's not awful but noticeable.
Streaming at 144 fps would be highly taxing on anyone's system. Most people don't go above 60. Streaming at 1080p60 would need a higher bitrate, somewhere around 3500-4000 but most people I watch don't go above 720p60.
It's a neat service that lets you add a bit boss, a tip jar, credits, alerts, etc. They just recently released a version of OBS tailored to their service and supposedly decreases your CPU usage and easily integrates Twitch chat. It's pretty neat but I still prefer to use OBS Studio.
If you simply plug the Elgato into the console, it will simply capture game audio only. To capture your voice, you would need an input from your computer. I honestly don't know if a splitter would help capture your voice from your headset but I doubt it.

I've only used a splitter to capture party audio (which turns off game audio).

My job was serving the dirty chicken actually
This setup looks oddly familiar to my old store.

Only our mop sink is much dirtier.
It's not fast food, but it's an Irish-style sports bar type place. I was there for two and a half years.

In the city I worked at, the high school had a tradition called capping. I think the current graduating class gave their caps to the class after them. It's a requirement to graduate. I'm not 100% on this but I know it's bullshit.

It's one of the busiest nights I've ever worked. Big tables start pouring in and we really only have room for three parties of 6+ with boots that hold four people only. It's crazy. Food is late, we're running around like chickens with heads cut off. One of the cooks throws a tantrum, punches the microwave in the kitchen, bleeds all over the place, glass shards in food and leaves.

So now food's late and cold and not going out when it should, managers are in the kitchen doing the best they can while we're trying to help our customers. They're pissed. Most of them anyway - a few were regulars who were really just enjoying the show.

At the end of the ordeal, customers start coming to the kitchen trying to figure out their tickets and asking us why they're paying for shit they ordered because it's our fault it was late or cold or whatever. Managers are working it out, so my coworkers and I are cleaning off tables, making drinks to go and trying to hustle everyone out. Meanwhile customers are complaining to us, a few want the owner's name (we just sold to corporate a few months prior) and we overhear them calling us incompetent and how much better they are at our jobs.

I'm so glad to be gone to be honest.
Considering just a few days ago someone [identified a car with a piece of bumper](https://www.reddit.com/r/whatisthisthing/comments/7s738w/help_identify_this_piece_of_bumper_from_a/), I would think it's possible with the whole bloody car in view.

You understand (mostly) what he is asking. Even Burnie stops and says "Go ahead" to try to further understand the question. We're not making fun of him for asking the question, we're making fun of the foreign (pun intended) way he asks them.

They also tested a 2016 Nissan Sentra vs a 2015 Nissan Tsuru, basically a 1990s version of the Sentra and it did not fare well.

The Tsuru is the cheapest Nissan you can buy in Mexico, the Sentra the cheapest Nissan in the US.

Also interesting, Gavin wrote bitches but bitch got blocked.

Edit: Also the shit hole and the stable genius quote were expertly timed.

I had to look up "famous canadians" and post it but holy shit there's a lot of them.
This happened to me on my friend's screen. All of a sudden he's dying laughing but he stopped long enough to get a game capture, then I started dying laughing.
I get those too. I have Mr Number on Android and block anyone not in my contacts. If you need to get ahold of me, text me or leave a voicemail.
That sounds like my old job at Best Buy. I did the same thing.
Adobe does this with my Creative Cloud. $20 a month and the entire suite. I don't think they check anything, you just put in a school name. Amazon doesn't let me use the student discount anymore, and Spotify has to verify, but I'm ok with $10 a month for it.
I still think about this story from time to time and it scares the hell out of me. Most recently it was in the thread in /r/gifs about that raccoon getting on the woman's board.

How do we know he's even still alive? That was his last comment.
Lived in Canada for 5 years and I don't talk to anyone from there. Found my neighbor and an old friend but other than a few messages here and there, I get nothing. I have a handful of close friends here in Florida and I wouldn't trade them for anything.

I saw it posted on /r/evilbuildings and that was my first thought :(
I was gonna say, you would think that the kitchen would know not to start an entree before an appetizer. But yes, mostly idiots.
We used quaternary sanitizer in our store but it was like 5% sanitizer and 95% water. If we used too much it ended up being sticky and I got a lot of complaints about it. Usually I'd just find a new rag and dip it in water and wipe it with that.

I had that happen to me at RTX. Shannon was standing outside the convention center and got a picture with him but I kinda walked away before I could really talk because I got nervous as hell.
Yes because the ISPs could potentially block access to how to get information. Whether it be CNN, Fox News, NBC, whatever. They will have control over the pipes in which your information flows.

I enjoy them. Abode is by far the easiest. The space station and basement are good too.
I really love the concept of the puzzle games. I have a Vive so I play some of the escape rooms too but I'm too stupid to figure any of them out so they just sit there installed. Laughing at me.

A friend of mine recently became a sheriff for the county and I CONSTANTLY have to remind him to put it on. It's infuriating and I'm not just talking about the dinging.
Does anyone know the GTA video Jeremy is talking about? I know the clip where Gavin is driving Jeremy around and he says it looks like he's taking a bath but I can't find the exact video.
It was Amazon's attempt to enter the smartphone market. It had four sensors on the corners that basically recreated the effect in the gif. It flopped and Amazon stopped selling it.

Just replying to say it looks like it's fixed.
Canada has required them since 1990. GM petitioned to add them in the US on their cars after Canada but the NHTSA did not allow it until 1995 and even today is not mandated by the NHTSA.

But I agree. Even in clear weather, the DRL make it so much easier to see other cars and it boggles my mind that people don't know to turn them in when the weather gets bad.
I can't tell but from the top comments, I think it's a joke.

But if it wasn't, it would probably be in Florida where it was made illegal to turn your backyard into a shooting range just under two years ago.

I think it's new. YouTube also puts live channels at the top of your subscriptions with the red live icon.

I thought Non-Stop Pop was a good station until I discovered Radio Mirror Park and oh god there are so many good songs.
I listen to a lot of Chain Gang because of that trailer.
Since I switched from an iPhone to Android, I only use Spotify. I used to be against music streaming because I liked owning the music. The last CD I bought I preordered. It was Panic! At the Disco's Too Weird to Live, Too Rare to Die.
I'm in love with VCR and Angels. I enjoy their first album but that's about it.

Edit: I take that back, their second album was better.
First I heard this was in 2010 from my roommate but it was a really weird remix with a few rap songs. It's also how I found out about Ellie Goulding.

No? You know what? Just go away.

Every time someone posts a picture, a gif, a video, a screenshot, or just anything really that involves some kind of "corporate" thing - A video game, a logo, or probably just even the town hall of a city given how overboard you dummies go, you have to /r/HailCorporate it.

I'm done. I've had enough. You can't just spam /r/HailCorporate and expect an upvote. You can't just be like "dude, you're playing a game?" and post /r/HailCorporate. You just can't.

I doubt you even work for corporate given how against them you are. You live in a cardboard box, typing on your CrapBook Pro, feeling good about yourself because you think you just "called someone else out" for being a corporate shill.

Just who do you think you are? Some epic 12-year-old on the internet with le cool fedora posting about how "corporate shill hails this, corporate shill hails that?" Well, I've got news for you. You aren't anything. You aren't epic, you aren't a 12-year-old, and your fedora certainly isn't le cool.

I hope in time you will learn that not everybody and everything is a corporate shill.

I'm also dedicating this year of streaming to charity, so here's to hoping I hit my goal!

Except I'm ginger so it hurts where my soul would be.
Ditto on that. I have a 1TB but waited to get an SSD for a couple months. It's only 120GB but it's exceptionally fast.
Makes me think it'll break if I drop it. But that's true with most things - LEGO, computers, children, glass...
The Death Star is pretty up there, too. $500 if I remember correctly.
I used to do this at my old restaurant. We were all kinda family so whenever I'd show up not in work clothes and I saw they were busy, I'd hop in and help out. The manager would get mad at me for not clocking in but I liked working there. I'd do anything for those guys.
There was a store here in Destin that did that. I swore it was closing for well over a year.

Only when the weapons are put away. If the pilot puts away the weapons by pressing right on the D-pad (on console, not sure of the control on PC), they go off radar.

Probably about as poorly as my memory because that's all I remember.
I'm not debating the cops are in the wrong, but they were called to a hostage situation. You have to remember, at the time the cops don't know this is a Swatting, or what Swatting is.
Also, the Witchita Eagle posted the [bodycam footage](http://www.kansas.com/news/local/crime/article192111974.html).

They never entered the home but were stood across the street. They also mention (and I'll agree with the police here) he reached for his waistband.

Several of my friends are police. They're not uneducated by any standard and they've gone through the training. I agree the shooting could have been avoided and the officer should not have discharged his weapon but it was the middle of the night with that much distance in what was called in as a hostage situation, you might be able to understand why the police were on edge.

Edit: I know I have an unpopular opinion but not all police are like this. Not every police officer is after blood and shoot on sight. These men and women are here to protect us and it's not fair to them to demonize all of them. The officers who went to this house had no idea it was a "prank" call and in their minds it was a dangerous situation. Their priority was protecting themselves from someone they were told was armed and dangerous.
He also took credit for that brief pause during the NN hearing earlier this month.

We haven't had a break-in in the 16 years we've lived here but they've been happening a lot around here lately. A couple months ago we had a few cars that had windows smashed and a string of break-ins the weeks leading up to Christmas. We've never had this happen and I'm scared not only for me, but my mom, my sister and our pets are here.
And YouTube has stepped up their game lately. Vertical video works on phones and ultrawide video takes up my entire monitor.

Yeah, every Publix around me in the Florida Panhandle is great.
I don't know if it's an old person thing my mom does, but she leaves us whenever we go anywhere in public. She's horribly impatient so she walks miles ahead of us and wonders why she has to stop because there are other people around trying to get to the same place.

Also last year we went to Ohio for my cousin's wedding and on our way back we used the ticket machine to check in. My mom placed our bags blocking the queue and when a woman came up and moved them, she tried to tell her we were already in line when we clearly weren't. I told the woman to go ahead, she thanked me, and my mom glared at me and told me to shut up. That whole trip was hell.

And I get to go back in May for another cousin's wedding.

Like the others have said, the other telecoms haven't made it easy. Many complain they have to adjust their telephone poles, and in cases where Google is allowed to expand, the telecoms take their time adjusting the poles. I can't find a source for this.

Google has, however, found a new way to roll out fiber by digging micro-trenches but I don't know how much that's being used.

A friend of mine went through something similar. Back in our freshman year in high school, he went to a local airport to fly with a family friend. They weren’t skydiving, just touch and go’s. They were going about the pattern and the engine cut off as they were climbing. The pilot turned around but couldn’t make the runway so he landed between the taxiway and runway, but there were little ditches in between. Nose gear caught the ground and the plane flipped. He’s fine now but is really weary of flying small planes.

Achievement Hunter had a few, too.
Bingo
What about the sangria?
Three oinkers wearing pants, plate of hot air, basket of Grandma's breakfast and change the bull to a gill, got it.
I meant that as a joke. Those words piss me off more than anything.

After what I heard about Susan G Komen and Red, I tend to be picky about my charities. Charity Navigator is a great resource.
"light-touch"  
"Obama-era"  
"heavy-handed"  

I'm so triggered right now.
I'll look regardless. I'm finding some old videos I forgot about. 
That narrows the search immensely. Thank you!
It's funny because that's exactly what they tweeted in response.
Make sure to get Ted Cruz on that.
I got a Vive and love it. My room's a bit smaller than it used to be so I can't play room-scale games anymore. SuperHot is fun, I Expect You To Die plays much better with Vive support than Revive. Obviously Job Simulator and Accounting.

Many of the escape room games are fun but lack replay-ability. There's plenty of fun titles out there.
You joke but that's how we got our two oldest. Went to a shelter, sat down, and they crawled all over my dad. Second oldest even nicked my dad on the nose.
So I'm going through a bunch of videos trying to find this. Are you implying there are face cams?
Just finished watching it and I didn't hear anything like what OP was describing.

I live close enough to throw a rock into Alabama. It's true this side of Florida, too.

Someone else asked this a couple weeks ago. I'll see if I can find it. It's episode 10 of Sky Factory or thereabouts and it's at the beginning of the episode.

Edit: Was it [this](https://youtu.be/uVcHzJrp4-k?t=39)?
Hard to believe it's almost been 4 years.
It's the outfit Jeremy from Achievement Hunter wore in their Dawn of the Christpunchers GTA video.

>“The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C.” (Trump signed this version of the travel ban, not the Justice Department.)

He doesn't even know what he's signing anymore.
Google Photos slightly diminishes the quality but just ever so slightly.

If you upload at the original quality, it counts towards your Drive space used.

Edit: For example, I uploaded a RAW photo, 14MB, to Photos and the download is 286KB for the unedited version.
I found an article about the Pontiac that Jeremy passed. All it says was a woman driver wasn't paying attention and a construction worker was thrown from a van but there's not much else.

Some time after Katrina when they drove from south Florida to New Orleans, they passed through my city and stopped in Bagdad. It was weird because I've totally been there before. But I didn't know about Top Gear until 2010.

I found an article from Daily Star (not sure if reputable, but I'll cite it anyway) saying that a pair of NORAD jets were flying around Mar-a-lago because North Korea is testing missiles apparently.

That's all I can gather.
We had one on campus at my old university and it was closed on the weekends. Thought I was gonna starve.
My last name is Wolfe!
Both of mine match up pretty accurately, I think.

My dad's family came from Sweden while most of my mom's family is German. I'm also a ginger, so my genetic makeup is 21% British & Irish, 17% French and German, 9% Scandinavian.

I've only done 23 and Me so far but I have Ancestry's kit lying on my desk but I have yet to do it.
I assume you're talking about American Airlines Flight 587. She was on the plane on her way back to the Dominican Republic.
I was wondering how far down I was gonna go before I saw a reference.
That really sucks. Apparently BLM stopped the parade from happening unless their demands were met, including not having police in uniform.

Netflix also has their [ISP Speed Index](https://ispspeedindex.netflix.com) that lets you compare the providers. Also has an interactive graph that shows speeds over time.

Remember when Comcast suddenly dropped in 2014? [I do.](https://i.imgur.com/kSHNe0K.png)

Edit: I do find it interesting that 3 other ISPs were down there at the same time, and rebounded too. https://i.imgur.com/fHxYN9K.png
Never do two illegal things at once. 
I have a lot of respect for Bethesda. Last year after the shooting in Orlando, they were the first to wear the rainbow pins at E3. Being openly gay, it was pretty sweet. Even tweeted at Pete Hines and he tweeted back. 
I love for a single frame you see the missile
I thought [Bethesda's](https://youtu.be/DPl-YMq2WTM) new ad was pretty good.
I keep forgetting how big this area code is, too.

My sister goes to school in another time zone but still has the same area code.
I honestly have no idea. I was 23 when I applied and I know people younger than that working for Uber
Is not, a small town in the Florida panhandle.
Sounds like my mechanic, also named Mike!

My mom's old boss was the same way. She worked the desk and when customers were outright rude to her, her boss would get on the line and tell the customer they're not servicing them anymore.
I applied and was denied for both.

Plus they don't serve this area.
We have two rather large dogs and they bark at everything but it's nice knowing when the mail comes or the pizza's here.

Most of them don't even ring the doorbell anymore.
Me and my sister colluded to open a few presents before Christmas one year, maybe like 12 years ago. We got into so much trouble.
We did that with the Kinder Surprise eggs. Every year we drove from Ontario to my mom's family near Cleveland. 
It's about [here](https://youtu.be/PCWC48V_Q-I?t=2425).

This is the episode where he starts making chicken coops and haybales. He's doing other things, too but it looks like that video is where he starts getting into it and making new chickens.

This is also the video where Gavin starts making solar panels.
Snopes says it was staged.

https://www.snopes.com/walmart-seizure-robbery/

>The video was posted on YouTube on 8 August 2016 by Chris Mendez, who also compiled videos of the same stunt being repeated in different locations. The seizures and the theft are clearly staged, with the same man playing the part of the wallet thief in each incident. In one video, posted 22 September 2016, the man who took the wallet also got tackled by an outraged bystander
Calm down there Joel
It's like the KSP version of QWOP
I had mine stolen from my university back in 2011 while I was on Thanksgiving break. It was a really nice bike too :(
Thought it was starting its own beatbox session
It's doubled since I first saw this three hours ago.
Catch.............22
My Mazda lets me do that. It's keyless start so after I start I can get out and use the key in the fob to lock it while it's still running.
And DLC came out not long ago. Within the last year IIRC.
I like the continuity of having the paddles in BF3 then having the syringe in BF1.

There's a joke there somewhere
A friend of mine works for the local sheriff and he told me he loves it when people swear because he gets to add it to the reports.
I think he's saying that when the second DLC comes out, it'll be required that you have to have Osiris to play the second.

I used to work at Beef 'O' Brady's and it's the same there. Soup is days old and it rarely changes. Broccoli, rice, even a few of the appetizers are microwaved.

Burgers, shrimp, fish, fries were cooked to order, but even the wings were pre-cooked.
Do you recall a platform, who may have published the article, maybe a more precise release date?

Edit: Is it [The Occupation](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/03/27/the-occupation-reporter-game/)?
Found the book on Amazon haha.

This was me when my dad died.

Sunday morning, I'm off work and still in bed. I'm half asleep and I think I hear my mom and sister arguing because they do it all the time. I guess my dream involved an iPhone case that my sister didn't like. But no, my dad had a heart attack and fell in the bathroom right before getting in the shower.

The look in his eyes I won't ever forget. Like he was still there but not at the same time. This was over four years ago.
Can't lose something I never had.

But seriously, no. I've never been an artist of any sort so it's not a terrible tragedy but I still miss having that book. 
I got a good chuckle from it.

Somewhere I heard he's also active on Reddit but I don't know his username
I went to go visit a friend for his wedding and he said, "I don't know about the rest of the country, but I know New England sure runs on Dunkin."
Yet gay marriage is "gross"
You are making this hard
I had a book a long time ago that taught how to draw the characters and as someone as terrible as I am at drawing, I started to get really good with it. I'm kinda sad I lost it.
The aprons say "Bugger Off"

I love it
It's not healthy
It's a meme, came from /r/relationships I believe.

Delete Facebook, hire a lawyer, hit the gym. Some people like to put them out of order to make it sound funny.
It's enough to warrant jail time in Virginia.
Three times this area has been referenced on Reddit in the past day. 
I've been reading but it looks like they didn't block it, per se, but they didn't enable MMS, tethering, and Bluetooth file sharing for about three months claiming they wanted to make sure their network could handle it.

[PDF](https://www.att.com/Common/merger/files/pdf/iPhone/Customers_FAQs.pdf?partner=LinkShare&siteId=TnL5HPStwNw-Jq8nsmmsL_9a7XP4BUHRuQ) stating AT&T wouldn't be charging more for MMS **with a text messaging bundle.**
Shit, second post from WA I've seen in the past hour.

My grandparents just moved to Port Angeles a few years ago. I was just up there in October.
Same. I have a lot of family up in that area. I was just up there back in October, too.
I have the 34" and fuck this thing is huge. I was using two 19" TVs as monitors before and this thing is easily the same size width-wise.
I have a preference to Samsung Pay. It seemed like just another payment app but the phone - I guess - makes a magnetic signal similar to a credit or debit card and works more places, even places without NFC readers. And you got rewards points. 
I can't even use my GPS because it tells me to go straight all the time. 

Damn homophobic GPS 
Just zoning in on my county and you can see the color difference where interstate 10 runs through in Florida.
I placed three orders at the beginning of November at different times, and I got a shipping notification for the AH poster 10 days ago and nothing else. 
I mean he is a simple farmer. I don't think he has access to the internet. 
Going through some older YouTube videos, like LMFAO, Dev, etc, and I just found out that KSHMR used to be The Cataracs. My mind is blown right now.
Just to clarify, it's none of the songs in the playlist linked?
I don't think the Aron is military-only. The website OP linked looks like it has several civilian options.
We still have a giant tub of Lego in the attic that I played with 15+ years ago. And I started collecting the Architecture series. I still have 4 or 5 sets I have yet to build because I'm out of space.

You don't *have to* but it's an option. You can also use Twitter or just your email.
Tumblr also supports custom HTML and CSS.
I can't tell if you're being serious or not but Tom sold MySpace years ago.

Apparently he's pretty active on Reddit, too.

We've had our Samsung DLP TV for almost 10 years. Hell it lasted longer than the Mitsubishi. We've only had to change the bulb twice, maybe three times now?

My main problem with the DLP is the screen on our Samsung sags a bit in the middle, so straight lines look a bit curved. Not too much of a big deal with anything that isn't a graphic of some kind but still holds up. The Mitsubishi didn't have that problem, though and it was a few inches larger.
Yeah. It's like being gay. Don't wanna get bullied for it? Be less gay.

That is correct but I don't have the proper sources to cite.
Honestly just using the Xbox One X is smoother. I still have my One S  on my TV and comparatively, it's slower. Not too much to make a difference, but enough to make it a first world problem.
[Battlesloths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dipHNUG0Vxs&t=179s) and [Invisigun Heroes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zVR6Wxn9qQ) are pretty similar, too.

Something about pixel style local multiplayer games that I love.

I wonder how many times that bulb shattered before they realized the problem.
Don't forget to not let us print in black and white if it's out of color ink. 
That's Kia. You're thinking of those old phones that are indestructible.

The 2017 version seemed very The Sims to me for some reason.
To add on to that, the ex-husband of another server (she started after all this happened) is the brother of the killer and has been harassing her boyfriend.

The whole city is fucked up and I'm honestly really glad I don't work there anymore.
They go on a very lovely date then they go to the guy's house and have sweet man-machine sex.
Same thing happened to us at work. Guy had worked at our restaurant before but has been to jail a few times. Got a job with us again after he got out. He was attracted to one of our servers and one day he got mad because she didn't need help dealing with a difficult customer. He hid at her house and killed her when she got home. I hate to say that I saw it coming, but it still hurts.

RIP Sandy.
Now I feel validated :)
PewDiePie
Good music, too.
Amazon Prime or Best Buy Gamers Club 
I can't believe you remembered that.

I did start watching Trivia Murder Party so I'll go back and watch that along with the GTA video. Thanks for the help!

Edit: I'm watching Minecraft 237 and they mention it but it's not what I'm looking for. 
I thought I recognized that girl at the beginning. She's Lip's girlfriend Amanda in Shameless.

Edit: Apparently that's Nichole Bloom, she's in the entire movie and she plays Emily in Until Dawn. Whoops. 
I went to a concert in Orlando earlier this year and the same thing happened while trying to get out of the parking garage. I was trying to explain it to my friends since no one was letting us through but I couldn't remember the word "zipper" so I called it scissoring. 
It would have been after the skit, October 18th but before Clouds X.
It wasn't a recent video. 
> 2011-2013, AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon were blocking access to Google Wallet

I vividly remember this. This was back before Apple Pay but a few places around here had the tech, mostly just Subway. It was called Isis wallet but they changed it to Softcard after ISIS became mainstream. After that, it shut down in 2015.
>abrennan077 

His YouTube says LA. This is the same guy that ended up on the back of the blue Camry a few months ago. I think a gif of it was posted to another subreddit yesterday.
Our two oldest cats - Dexter and Nigel (Dexter has since passed) - came from a shelter at Eglin AFB. The people at the shelter encouraged us to sit and let the cats come to us. Dexter was a kitten at the time and climbed over my dad's back. Nigel was also a kitten and nicked my dad on the nose. Our joke was the cats picked our dad but they're the greatest things to happen to me. Our youngest cat hung out with my mom at work so she took her home.

Our two dogs came from different shelters and I really didn't have anything to do with those.

We served this wine at my last restaurant. This is the first I'm seeing this.
Built for those who can't see more than 30 fps.
I worked for a restaurant franchise about 30 minutes away while there was another in the city I live. One of my coworkers started working in my city and told me the manager there would make them work off the clock, things like rolling silverware. They also said they had to show up when they were scheduled but weren't allowed to clock in if they weren't busy. I applied before I found all that out so they called me after I found out and I noped right out of there.

I guess joke's on me though because I just lost my job - that I've been at for two years - because I was told someone else was covering for me. Ugh.
Is this the building in Mr. Shifty?
Bill Gates gave away an Xbox one year for Christmas for the Reddit Secret Santa. That seems pretty nice. 
Our oldest is the same way. You can call his name and he'll come running.
God I remember this from long ago.

The song is Computer Sex by Aaron and the Gays if anyone's curious.
I saw C U and for sure thought it was about to call me a cunt.
I did this a few years back on the Best Buy website just for fun to see what the most expensive thing was. Doesn't work anymore tho :(

But thanks for the tip!
Oh so I'm an idiot then. I had no idea SiriusXM did free things like this and I thought I was still paying for back when they did it in August.

If so, it's at 1:39:39 or thereabouts.

That's true. Also why I'm not a lawyer. 
That seriously threw me for a loop.
In New Hampshire, where OP is from, "Unauthorized access to a computer or computer network" is a misdemeanor if damage is less than $500, felony is more than $500. I don't know how damage would be measured like that, but IANAL.
They also sell them at Walmart, if I remember correctly.

Funny enough, I was sitting outside a Walmart when I ordered mine back in February and waited until April for it to come in. But totally worth the wait.

My only complaint is the joystick bit. I prefer the joysticks on an Xbox or PS controller more, but that's just me.
Kia was hamsters.

And they had a giant one at Pensacola for the Blue Angels homecoming.
Or the other landlady, Linda Lykes.
