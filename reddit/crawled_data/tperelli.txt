Ooooh let's do iOS 5 banners
$2500 is nice to have regardless of whether or not you're corporate or retail. People saying it's not a lot or "crumbs" as some have said are disconnected from reality. It's not like people who work in Cupertino are filthy rich.
Isn’t the 2nd amendment a beautiful thing?!
Everybody *should* but most don’t bother. 
If you’re on the fence, get it. Such an awesome game and this is an awesome price. I don’t like horror games but this one is just exciting. I should probably try another play through soon. 
Thanks for the list! I’ll definitely start doing my research and see which places are most doable for us. 
Awesome thanks for the suggestion! Looks like a ton of fun.

I have heard Sedona a couple times. I’ll definitely look into it. I’ve never been out west so I’m super stoked to experience it all for the first time. 
If I’m at work I have them low so I can hear if my coworkers need me. If I’m at the gym I have them high so I can focus and block out all other noise. If I’m at home they’re a little above halfway. 
Lol good to know. Were also planning on heading north towards the Grand Canyon. Any suggestions up there?
We’re looking to do some exploring. Like outdoorsy kind of stuff. 
Disaster?
Well this guy is blind and doesn’t want animations so I don’t think that’s an issue for him. 
There is an option to turn off animations.

That’s awesome. At least you got something out of your travels. 
You don’t even need to be conservative. Just not a Democrat. 
I was one of the thousands that couldn’t get in. Got there several hours early but it was almost full when I got there.  I need him to come back!
I fucked up

Got there 2 hours early and it was almost full. They gave out 30,000 plus tickets for a 5,000 person venue. So many disappointed people. 
Fuck planned parenthood. At the very least they deserve to get their federal funding revoked. 
Oh I don’t doubt it. I intend to wait for a while but if it doesn’t start until 7 there isn’t much point in getting there so early 
I plan on getting there at 5. Not planning on getting front row or anything but waiting any more than 2 hours is a waste. 
I remember when web apps were the original plan for the iPhone 
5k is a lot. Washington is in the middle of nowhere. Last venue I went to held 3k and was in the middle of GR. 
I’ll be there! Think 2 hours early is good?
And Otto. They kill Americans. Fuck Kim. He never deserves to be respected. 
I thought I was dreaming 
He won’t legalize it. He said several times he’s going to leave it up to states. 

He does support medical marijuana though. 
Apple said they ditched the idea of a fingerprint reader under the screen when they got Face ID working. 
Interesting, I hate my work thinkpad’s keyboard. 
And that’s not even saying Sonos sounds bad. Most people probably would’ve even notice a difference
Yeah definitely 
They edited their comment. It didn’t include a link when I replied. 
It’s eligible for replacement until the end of the year I believe. So unless you desperately need a new battery I’d hold out a few months and you can get even more life out of your phone.

Rumor has it there won’t be a next gen. They’re going to continue to stagger releases while supporting Xbox one as the base. Sort of like PC upgrades. 
Not sure which hammer you've been hearing about but I'm strictly talking about the grand jury here.
Well the grand jury didn’t exist in 2016 sooooo
They’re redacting it because these texts are most likely being used as evidence in the grand jury that Sessions put together. If they released everything it would hurt their case. 

The fact that they released anything is a positive sign that the grand jury is ready to drop the hammer.

That’s why you don’t wrap it directly from the base. Give it an inch and then wrap. You’ll never have it fray.

None of the malls near me have ended up like this. Strip malls are dying though. 
Yeah when I see asap I assume it means “drop everything you’re doing and do this thing right fucking now the future is at stake”
You could do this for literally every election and you would see the same outcome. 2016 wasn’t an exception. 
Oh man the flood are the worst. I refuse to play through Halo 2’s campaign so I can avoid the flood. 
It happens with every CoD. They make so many and only tend to support the current and previous game at the same time. At this point, BOII is 7 years old. They don’t want to invest the time or resources into keeping modders off their servers, they want you to buy the newest game. 
Nah right after Trump won the election Kanye went to visit Trump at trump tower. They’ve been friends for a long time actually. Nothing wrong with that imo

He's playing skylines again?!

Fuck I wish he'd just upload everything to YouTube
I know what happened here. When they make ads with phones, someone will typically go pick from a selection of smartphones that the company has on hand. They probably went with a generic looking android phone because that’s usually the easiest.

Then whoever made the animation designed it with the iPhone lock screen. Someone definitely noticed this before it went live but probably felt it wasn’t worth the time and effort to go back and redo. Thus you have this ad. 
What happened to it? I have the same one and it’s going on strong as ever. Although the battery could probably use a replacement. 
I do have it set to automatic unfortunately. Thanks for the tip though. That would make sense. 
Still not a monopoly 
Can’t tell if that’s sarcasm. Because mine was.

What the fuck is happening to these comments?
Politics is the epitome of fake news. Every single post they upvote there is sensationalized. Every single one. Their bots upvote posts as soon as they’re posted so that the brainless subscribers see them and add their upvotes. It’s actually embarrassing reading their comments. I can’t wait for their world to come crashing down. 
Yes! I was going to make a post about this but never got around to it. It’s infuriating. Literally every time I say it, Siri activates.

I think it’s hilarious that people don’t know you’re joking
What losers
Tbh I used to think Trump was a douche. He was the guy that yelled at and fired people on tv. When he first started running I thought it was a joke. I thought he was insane. Until Rand dropped out then I needed to catch a new train. That turned out to be the Trump train. 

And Kanye... well Kanye is a gay fish but he sure can write music. 
What was the admins’ response?
This is deliberate and most likely won't change. Apple still treats the iPhone as a phone. It's very essence is that it's a phone, music, and internet device. When a call comes in, they want you to act on it. Whether you ignore it or answer it is up to you, but they want you to engage with it. By making phone calls show up as a banner notification, Apple would be treating one of the essential functions of the phone like any other app. They explicitly don't want this.

I agree with you though. Most phone calls I'll just ignore and if the call was important I usually assume that person will leave a message. But it's going to take a major philosophy change at Apple for them to change how calls are handled on the iPhone.
I don’t know what you’re talking about 
Is apple still advertising the 9.7 inch iPad? It’s been over a year since the last refresh. 
Tell Bezos and the CIA I said hi
oh boy here we go
Apple is typically last to implement technology though. They're just the first to do it best.
Yeah the line was insane. I was probably about half a mile back when I got there and watching it grow was insane. It snaked on forever. Felt bad for the people at the end because they were never gonna get in.
I went to his last rally before the election at Devos Place in GR and that only had a 3,000 person capacity. Got there an hour early and got a decent spot in the crowd. I plan on getting there at least 2 hours early this time though. 
You’re right
How the fuck did he do that?
I would advise at least 2 hours before. I went to one before he was president and got there an hour before. Ended up waiting like 2-3 hours in line but got a decent spot inside. 2 hours early will ensure a great spot. 

Edit: Should mention, rally was scheduled for 8, got there at 7, Trump didn’t speak until midnight.

I don't see why it should. It's going to be shot down hard. $118 is a lot of money per household and a majority of people would never even use the service anyway. At this point I don't think mass transit will ever happen in Metro Detroit.

I also attribute it to the fact that McCabe is small fry compared to the more well known people. But he’s big enough to make very powerful people every nervous. 
The overall reaction I’ve seen is them accepting it because the IG is bipartisan. They’ve suddenly turned on McCabe as soon as they realize he’s actually guilty. The same will happen with Comey but with more screaming.

Wait...
Apple offering a paid service doesn't mean that's going to prevent news from being reported on other sites for free. News is garbage nowadays. Nothing in the near future is going to change that.

The only thing that you can do is be knowledgeable about which site you're on, what/who the source is for that info, and DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. Don't ever take the news at face value, no matter the news organization. Every news org has one goal: profits. They don't care about the truth, they don't care about the consequences, they just want what's going to sell or further their agenda. This is why fake news is such a problem. 

Apple can offer a paid news service but it isn't going to improve anything. If anything it would be a bandaid on the dying media.

They didn’t want people using it while charging for several reasons. 
Noooo this is bad guys. Like real bad. The DOJ is already working on this through the IG. If they appoint a special council, they could just take everything the IG has done so far and never let it see the light of day. 

Fuck special councils. They’re illegal.

I don't any interest in glitching but I didn't realize there were glitches for contracts. I think someone glitched my recent blitz contract because it went from not close to finishing to instantly finishing once someone joined.

You do, unless you find yourself in a Cambridge Analytica situation where they get data of friends on Facebook. But tbh if you’re paranoid about Facebook but use services from Google, Twitter, Snapchat, etc. you’re not very smart. If you’re using a free service, you’re the product. 

That being said, I fully understand what these companies want our info for and am fine with it. It’s the world we live in. 
Which means we have an obligation to intervene. How people forget this or believe that we are going to war over it baffles me. It’s actually insulting. 
Can’t wait to use a few billion of that for THE WALL
How people thought trump would take us to war baffles me. Especially people who call themselves Trump supporters. It’s like you don’t even know the man or his beliefs. It’s shameful. 
Why do you disagree with it?
Fuck being allies with Russia. That would never fly. I would like tensions to lower though. 

You can’t expect decades of hostility to lead to being allies. We have too much opposed history. 
Have you missed the whole point of this sub? We remove people who don’t agree with the president. That’s the point. If you’re a Trump supporter and are banned you can always appeal the ban and the mods will almost always let you back in. 

Concern trolling is not tolerated. If you don’t trust the president on his decisions, what’s the point? We know he does things unconventionally but as soon as he does something we might not like, everyone forgets that and acts like he has no idea what he’s doing. It’s insulting. You can’t pick and choose. You’re either all in or you’re out. 
Title is so cringy 
I’m just upset they’re closed on Sunday because it seems like every time I want chick-fil-a it’s on a Sunday. And I’m Catholic. 
It’s actually sitting at around 4.1m according to the bureau of labor and statistics. The 300,000 is a weekly number. 

The way it’s tracked from the BLS website:

- People with jobs are employed.

- People who are jobless, looking for a job, and available for work are unemployed.

- The labor force is made up of the employed and the unemployed.

- People who are neither employed nor unemployed are not in the labor force.

So the overall workforce is much smaller than 300m. Anyone who doesn’t want a job or isn’t looking for a job is not considered unemployed but out of the work force. There are millions like this and it really skews the unemployment numbers because really these people are unemployed. 
I laughed so hard. Just picturing that banner on the aircraft carrier is so bad. Can’t believe I ate that shit up. 
iPhone 6 is trash. So many issues with that phone. The GPS has crapped out on literally every 6 I’ve ever seen, the battery has had major issues for years, and there’s the whole bend gate thing which isn’t too much an issue I guess. Getting a 6 in 2018 is a truly awful idea.

I don’t like Zuckerburg either but you guys have no idea how blown out of proportion this whole Facebook issue is. It’s really not a big deal and especially not breaking news. 
This is what I’ve always thought. Let’s say somehow congress gets enough votes to impeach the president. Do you really think he’ll just accept it and leave? HELL FUCKING NO HE WOULDN’T. 

He would burn Washington to the ground. All the dirt he has on people, all the crimes, the scandals, everything, would come to light. 

It’s in the swamp’s best interest to not impeach him. 
Ty Cobb has been the president’s special council for about a year. He’s investigating the doj.

Since upgrading to 11.3, I’ve had nothing but trouble with iMessage. For some reason, every time I send a picture, it fails to send as an iMessage. It then says it sent as a text message, then pops up saying not delivered. However, the recipient gets the picture. As an iMessage!

I’ve tried hard resetting my device, signing out of iCloud, turning off iMessage and nothing has helped. Has anyone else experienced this? It’s incredibly annoying. 
I would buy one at $249
The biggest complaint I’ve seen aside from USB C on the new MacBook pros has been the keyboard. Butterfly 2.0 is definitely better but moving up from utter garbage isn’t much. Usually I have zero issue with Apple making things thinner but this is one instance where I think they really fucked up. Key travel is crucial to an enjoyable experience and the pro keyboard is far from enjoyable.

It was at a major University. We didn't have a teacher, we just had weekly labs run by students because there were too many people taking the class for profs to handle. I had to pick up a second class that walked us through our labs in a more 1-1 approach. I still failed :/

Edit: And our exams were logic exams. We basically solved programming issues on paper. Not fun.
It was a really good movie but I wish they'd change the name. I don't think they should take away the thunder of the original.
Congress has elections this year. They're known as the midterms because they happen in the middle of the president's term.
I took one Python class. Never again. 
This is good I guess but things are taking far too long now. By the time the DOJ, Nunes, etc. come up with anything Mueller will have some bullshit charge ready. This is a ticking timebomb at this point and everyone seems to be twiddling their thumbs. 
Who is that?
Yeah I made that clarification in another comment on this chain. 

Side note, it’s never acceptable to use an apostrophe to make things plural. 
Guys his whole thing is not telling the enemy what he’s going to do before he does it. I’m not sure what he has in mind but it’s not going to be so blatant as this tweet lays out. 
I’ll take those tendies thank you
I did not. Only have on pair. 
Yeah I do that. Not as nice as auto pairing but it’s the next best thing I suppose. Thanks for the tips!
Hmm so if I use them on my Mac laying in bed at night and want to use them on my phone the next day at work, they won’t automatically connect to my phone?

Wtf *were* our previous presidents doing?!

I know Trump is crazy good at what he does but I can’t just assume that it’s the only reason he’s been so successful. Did previous presidents even *try*?
Yeah I use them with my Mac occasionally 
If we’re talking about grammar it’s iPhones.

If we’re talking about Apple it’s iPhone devices. Or just devices.
My AirPods almost never auto connect to iPhone anymore. When I originally got them, the experience was awesome. Whenever I'd open the case and put them in my ears, they would instantly connect to my iPhone and I could start listening. However, over time they’ve stopped connecting on their own. I constantly have to go into Bluetooth settings and manually connect them.

I’ve tried removing and re-pairing them countless times and it’s never helped. Anyone know why this would happen? They’ve sort of lost their magic.
As mentioned in my post, I've tried that with no luck.
It is “iPhone 4s”. iPhone 4 is its full name so the plural comes after the 4, not iPhone. 

Although the plural for just “iPhone” is “iPhones”.
Hell no he’s not our fucking guy. Any Obama stooge stands no chance of being on our side. 
They had nothing. Now they have years of communications between trump and his personal lawyer. Anything, even the smallest little thing, can and most likely will be used against him. 

I really, really hope Trump has a plan to get mueller shut down without it looking like it’s his doing. We’re in very dangerous waters here.
They’re willing to burn the country down to remove Trump. They will do anything and everything they can until they impeach Trump. If Sessions or Trump don’t have anything to fight back, this could get real bad.

Ads are shown based on companies serving ads on the platform the game uses. Companies only serve you a set amount of ads in a particular time frame because it costs them more money the more you see the same ad. This could also be the reason you’re not seeing ads but I can’t really say for sure.

There are probably lots of factors. Honestly, iPads are pretty much it in the tablet space nowadays. Android tablets are dead, Microsoft tablets can’t really compare to iPad, Amazon tablets have never been really great. 

Add in the fact that iPads last forever now and people aren’t upgrading very often and you’ll find declining sales numbers. 
Probably because they want a reason to like and play it but just don’t have one yet. 
Looks like a 4s
Big data can do amazing things 
Hopefully that happens. I’m worried what will happen if we don’t get this wall built. Even if Trump kept the military down there his full 2 terms the next president could just pull them. We need a permanent solution. 
The one thing this can’t defend from though is families seeking asylum. We have some backward ass immigration laws. 

If you show up to the border in a family unit seeking asylum, legally, we have to let you in. What the living fuck?
I know that's the problem!
How to get pergnat?
Same on my series 3. It wasn't just you.
Their watch app has been garbage for forever. Constant errors and issues.

This is yet another major platform pulling support for the Watch. I honestly think this is a huge problem for Apple that they'll have to remedy in WatchOS 5. I don't know what it'll take but something has to change.
It’s the same situation as the Apple “TV” that was rumored for years. Turns out their grand vision was to allow people to use Apple software on their existing TV. 
That turned out to be the Apple TV.

How did they force you to update?
He is allowed to know about investigations about himself. But it would look reallllllly bad if he did so obviously he’d just stay out of it. 
It’s all show. The DoJ doesn’t need to send Congress anything if they know they have a case. And if anyone is to be believed, the DoJ is right on the cusp of letting shit loose. 

Trump will always keep up the optics that he’s not with the DoJ. He’s just letting them do their thing. 
I just wish they would’ve held off on announcing it until iOS 12 instead of teasing me for 9 months. 
You seem upset
Based on past experience I’m sure they have!

I made this suggestion when I left my review on the App Store a couple months ago
Not really preferred when we were on our way to hand in all our loot 😬
Then op should’ve made a post about that instead. That’s an entirely separate issue. If Siri had the capabilities to contact support when asked, and she doesn’t, then a post is warranted. But making a post complaining about Siri failing at something she’s not programmed to do is dumb. 
That’s not Apple’s support number. That’s their Apple care number. 
I mean when contacting apple support. I’m basically saying that Siri isn’t doing anything wrong and Apple just hasn’t incorporated Apple support. 
You have to specify what your issue is beforehand so you are connected with the right person for your issue. 

But who am I to ruin another Siri sux circlejerk

Matthew 5:43-48

“You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be children of your Father in heaven. He causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous. If you love those who love you, what reward will you get? Are not even the tax collectors doing that? And if you greet only your own people, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that? Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”

No problem. It just bothers me seeing people who have no idea what they’re talking about spreading misinformation. It doesn’t help that a lot of sites reporting on this also don’t know how it works. 
This is fencing that congress gave Trump funding for. 

Trump hasn’t tapped into the military budget yet for the real wall. 
Facebook doesn’t sell user data to advertisers. Companies that want to advertise on Facebook use Facebook’s “Business Manager” platform. 

You create ad campaigns and target people within certain demographics. By liking a certain page, sharing certain info, etc. you are placed in certain demographics that companies can use to target their ads. 

When you build your ads there are several ways to get your ads in front of people. The most common is in an auction. You basically bid against other companies trying to advertise in the same demographics and your ad is chosen based on several different properties. Auctions are entirely automated. 

Facebook doesn’t take your data and sell to advertisers, it allows advertisers to cater ads to people based on the data they willingly put into Facebook. 
Ping 2.0!
No they don’t. I work in social media advertising. You are wrong. 
Facebook will not die because of ads. It’s the most profitable social site for companies looking to advertise and until a more profitable site comes along, Facebook isn’t going anywhere. 

Even if the Facebook site folded, Facebook the company is so, so much more than that. 
Yeah I agree. I like new tech and I usually make sure the products I buy are as future proof as possible. The lifespan just won’t be as long with a 9.7 inch iPad as a 10.5 inch iPad even though it’s technically newer.

I disagree
That's the point! Honestly, the amount of stuff posted here by corporate accounts is crazy. Any regular post could be promoted by a company without explicitly saying so.

If you're really interested in what an ad shows, is it such a bad thing? You wouldn't have cared if it didn't say promoted.
Placing my bets on tomorrow/ Friday for everyone else.

Edit: I was right! Out now. 
Not bad for the price.

But I feel like if I were going to buy an iPad it would be a pro. Not that I even need one.
Just graduated. Never seen someone wearing this brand in person.
I'm having some fun during my gamepass trial but I will be waiting until a price drop and more content to actually buy the game. I'm honestly not in a hurry.
I honestly think they need to announce *something* before the 2 week gamepass trial is up for most people. The only people I've ever played with or know who play it are only playing it because of the free trial. Once it's up, if there isn't anything, even a word, about what's to come, they're jumping ship.
The new ones are just supposed to be the wireless charging ones. I'd jump at this price. They're great.
Not when the game is supposed to be Xbox's next big IP

For millions of people, it is. For some people Facebook is *the internet* so what they see there is what they know.
It's honestly tough to trust most news companies today though. I refuse to read CNN, Fox, NBC, CBS, etc. Basically anything political because it's all bullshit. 

I find that growing alternative forms of media are the way to go. A lot of smaller companies have journalists that actually hunt for the truth rather than spread misinformation. It's refreshing.

They’ve been getting their asses sued off by a patent troll over the underlying technology for FaceTime. They’ve been ordered to pay hundreds of millions over be past several years. 

Apple would have to rewrite FaceTime from the ground up in order to avoid infringing on their patent so as of now they’re leaving FaceTime the way it is. Maybe they are rewriting it but there’s no way of knowing that right now. 
Allow Siri to control other music apps. SiriKit is able to cooperate with other apps, why not music apps?

This is NOT THE WALL

This article breaks it down by every single section of the budget. All it is going to be is replacement and minor extensions of existing fencing, not any of the prototypes.

It’s been insanely misrepresented by the media. You might call it *fake news*
Yeah that’s the face of meth use
Trump tweeted today that he’s going to use funding for the military to build the wall
It’s on gamepass which is free for 2 weeks. Definitely try it out, there’s literally nothing to lose. 

It really is a fun game and has tremendous potential but it’s very bare bones at the moment. I’m sure you’ll enjoy it during the trial period though!
I remember learning in history class about how the government used to kill communists
I’ve heard this from so many people. It really should be a thing.

I think that does a good job describing it. I think the most important thing is that other countries already have laws that allow foreign companies to hand over American data but the US doesn’t have that ability. 

We’re letting countries like China order Chinese companies to hand over the data of American users and we can’t even do the same. The CLOUD Act equalizes this. 
CLOUD Act isn’t what the media says it is. I’ll try to find a comment that explains it well but the Act is more about catching up to other countries in terms of protecting American user data overseas. 
Hopefully he figures out how to allocate enough to build the fucking wall

The Cloud Act isn’t as deceptive as has been reported. 

See this comment:
> That is not the actual bill. That is a letter from tech giants saying they support the bill.

>Here is the introduction from the actual bill:

    1. SHORT TITLE. 
    This  Act  may  be  cited  as  the  ‘‘Clarifying  Lawful  Overseas Use of Data Act’’ or the ‘‘CLOUD Act’’

    SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS. 
    Congress finds the following: 

    (1)  Timely  access  to  electronic  data  held  by  communications-service   providers   is   an   essential  
    component  of  government  efforts  to  protect  public  safety   and   combat   serious   crime,   including 
    terrorism. 

    (2)  Such  efforts  by  the  United  States  Government  are  being  impeded  by  the  inability  to  access data  
    stored  outside  the  United  States  that  is  in  the custody,  control,  or  possession  of  communications 
    service  providers  that  are  subject  to  jurisdiction  of  the United States. 

    (3)  Foreign  governments  also  increasingly  seek  access  to  electronic  data  held  by  communications service  
    providers  in  the  United  States  for  the  purpose of combating serious crime. 

    (4)  Communications-service  providers  face  potential  conflicting  legal  obligations  when  a  foreign 
    government  orders  production  of  electronic  data  that  United  States  law  may  prohibit  providers  from  
    disclosing. 

    (5)  Foreign  law  may  create  similarly  conflicting  legal   obligations   when   chapter   121   of   title   18, 
    United   States   Code   (commonly   known   as   the   ‘‘ Stored  Communications  Act’’),  requires  disclosure  
    of  electronic  data  that  foreign  law  prohibits  communications-service providers from disclosing. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
    (6)  International  agreements  provide  a  mechanism  for  resolving  these  potential  conflicting  legal  
    obligations  where  the  United  States  and  the  relevant  foreign  government  share  a  common  commitment  
    to  the  rule  of  law  and  the  protection  of  privacy  and civil liberties. 

>I found the link to the bill on the ACLU's website, and the ACLU's own analysis conflicts with the text of the bill. There is nothing whatsoever in the bill that gives any law enforcement agency access without a warrant. This bill is trying to make it so US warrants can be executed in other countries and vice versa. That's it. 

>Never believe anything the ACLU or EFF says about a bill before you read it for yourself. To say they exaggerate and misinform is an understatement. They more they panic you, the quicker you will mash that "Donate" button.

This is fake...
They're not but performance would certainly be better on the Pro models.
Apple isn't selling the iPad as a laptop replacement to people that know they couldn't do their jobs with an iPad, Apple is selling the iPad as a laptop replacement to everyone else.

You would honestly be surprised how many people would be able to completely ditch their laptop/desktop for an iPad and have no negative effect on their lives.
Can't tell if you're trolling or not lmao
It just comes down to personal preference. All of those things are possible on an iPad, you just have to be willing to learn how to do it.

I'm a little bored so I want to see if I can figure this out...

**Importing docs**: There's a document scanner built into notes now and it's really good.

**Pictures from a digital camera**: If the images are on an SD card, [these](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJYT2AM/A/lightning-to-sd-card-camera-reader) exist.

**Zip files**: It's not a native Apple app but there are 3rd party apps like [Zipped](http://www.iphonehacks.com/2017/09/how-to-zip-unzip-files-files-app-iphone-ipad-ios-11.html) that can handle zip files on the iPad.

So is using an iPad different? Sure, but today it's increasingly becoming a laptop replacement.
I love this haha
They messed up. Even if they do plan on putting in a ton of awesome features and development, if people don't know that, people aren't going to be willing to pay full price.

My friends played it on game pass and asked how expensive it was and laughed when I said $60. 
Just wait until the Seabears catch wind...
Guys I caught a chicken!

Guys I dug up treasure!

Guys I killed some skeletons!

*Fin*
Finally convinced my friends to get the gamepass trial and play with me last night. We all had fun but none of us plan on buying it once the two weeks are up.

Maybe once they drop the price and there have been content updates we'll take another look.
Not in the same sense that Apple and all these android phones are releasing notches. They can't be compared.
That's just short sighted. Both of my parents replaced their laptops with iPads and they couldn't be happier.


That's just short sighted. Both of my parents replaced their laptops with iPads and they couldn't be happier.
With all these large AAA games being ported to iOS I'm not sure if I should go with a Pro model or just a base iPad.
I'm not the one being dramatic here lol
I really hope Spotify succeeds though. All of my music over the past several years is in Spotify and if they folded, I would lose everything. I also really enjoy the platform.
This is stupid
Lol if the notch was such an obvious next step then why did every android device with a notch release them after Apple did it?

Even if they didn’t “copy” per say, they still waited until Apple did it because those devices almost would have certainly failed without Apple leading the way. 
The butterfly mechanism isn’t the problem. It’s the lack of key travel that’s the issue. Key travel can only increase if there is more space which requires a thicker computer. 
But not a single android device is copying essential’s notch, they’re copying apple’s. No one said Apple was first and no one really cares. 

Never mind the fact that the notch was already decided on by the time the essential phone was released. 
Usual BGR is trash comment...

Closest you can do is put explosive barrels in the bottom and shoot them but that’s not very sneaky. 
I really like this respawn mechanic because if I know I’m going to be sunk while I’m treasure hunting I’ll hide my chests on the island and let them sink my ship. 

This respawn mechanic allows me to quickly sail back to the island I was just at and get my loot back without having to sail across the map for it. 
The ISS is falling. It's just falling in such a way that it misses the Earth

The first day it was out I was sailing with some strangers and it got us. Totally unexpected and fucking awesome. Although it’s very glitchy. I was on the bottom deck and was ripped through the wall by one of the tentacles and died. 

Then we sailed away and the kraken was left flailing its tentacles in the same spot for like 5 minutes. I don’t think that’s supposed to happen. 
Can someone photoshop it so it looks normal?

Well it’ll never look normal but you get it
They’ll have the framework but they’d need to build a lot more out to be really enticing to gamers. A lot more goes into a good gaming platform aside from access to games and decent specs.

Nobody should be upset over this comment lol
Destiny 1 was an absolute trainwreck
Happened yesterday but the other team thought they were on team chat and talked about how they were going to kill us and steal our ship.

Did not end well for them.
Everyone I've played with who played for the first time, including myself, couldn't even figure out how to take out our weapon.

Half my crew yesterday didn't know how to load cannons or repair holes. A tutorial would be nice.
I like it. I do wish there were a way to type custom text too. There were times when I wanted to say that someone was stealing our ship but I ended up spamming “get back to the ship!” over and over but was ignored because we were still looking for treasure. 
Cosmetics should be last priority. Adding fun things to do should be top priority. Doing fetch quests for hours gets boring so, so quickly.

Yeah sure
I mean it's their platform they'll let you write whatever they want you to write.
Since Day freaking One.

They even removed split screen and the game suspension screen as an excuse to improve performance and it didn't do jack. I've given up hope that they will ever be able to make lasting improvements.
Wood is cheaper. 99% of homes are wood framed and very sturdy for the most part. The extra savings you have from building with wood are worth it when most people will never need to worry about their home being destroyed by a tornado.

I'm actually surprised how good the controls are on mobile. Still holding out for controller support though.

Edit: My hope is that Apple updates their MFI standards to allow more modern controllers or just allow bluetooth controllers so we can use Xbox/ PS controllers.
Oh fuck me hahaha
I completely disagree with everything you just said
I fully expect to be downvoted by people who like this post, but this post offends me on a personal level

Why is everything so shiny?

The textures just don't look all that much better than they do now imo
But Siri has gotten a lot better. It’s more capable than ever. 
Yeah basically. I would be shocked if these acquisitions didn’t lead to a smarter Siri. 
Unfortunately doesn’t look like this will change the non descriptive update descriptions. It’ll just make sure devs aren’t breaking general App Store rules. 
Design is the biggest drawback with electric vehicles atm which is why I think Tesla is so popular. Infrastructure is a huge thing too but without some sort of universal system, it’s not going to take off. If every car has a different charger, charging stations will be useless.

Knobs and buttons are a must in cars. With a giant touchscreen I have to take my focus off the road to look and find the controls. With knobs I can feel the controls without looking. 
Is it real though?

Microsoft has an exclusivity deal with Bluehole...
I honestly really hope that the Big 3 can come out with a competitive all electric vehicle soon. I really dislike the control panel in Teslas enough to where I would never buy one. But every other electric vehicle I've seen looks like garbage. Maybe one day...

Well podsync is pretty fucking cool. Good for subscriptions and saving YouTube videos. 

I’m mainly looking for something that I can play one off videos of songs if I’m at a party. YouTube ++ works but I hate having to trust an unverified developer. Who knows what they have access to. 
This link works but idk if I trust the account signing it. It’s from China. 
👍🏼
Yeah I’m not sure. Thanks for willing to give it a shot. I’m too impatient to wait for Epic to send me an invitation haha
Hmmm. Have you played the game? That email is just a confirmation that you signed up. 
Found an article for ya!

https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/fortnite-invite-codes-now-available-how-to-send-ios-friend-invites-1825586

I appreciate it
I tried it for the first time yesterday. It is awful. It tastes like garbage. 
I feel like they could’ve gotten their point across without having the guy lick his friend’s face. 
I’ve never wanted to be a marine more in my life...
>FreakingEthan requests $100
Doesn’t work unfortunately 😕
I would love one!
Any way you could send me an invite?

I can PM you my Epic details if so :)
They removed the option to unlink your Xbox Live account. You have to contact them and have them do it for you but they don't reply for *days*. All I want to do is link my Xbox to my legit account and have cross progression but they are making things so unnecessarily difficult.
Lmao I immediately thought of that. Just picture every person commenting here is that person.
>moveon.org

The irony
Spotify is just better at recommendations. It’s scary how accurately it can tell what songs you’ll like. Apple Music lacks in this area imo. 
*cringe*
A jackless future is something I can’t live with on so many levels
I think it’s in the app but idk. It’s weird seeing so many people here complain about it but I haven’t ever experienced it and neither has anyone I know. 

Maybe it’s a regional thing. 
I’ve never had this issue and am so glad for it. 
Tbf the bigger stuff usually has to be brought to you by Apple employees anyway
*Wired* headphones are bad. 

Is this an Apple ad?
That guy has a soothing voice
I think they were talking about the picture.
Funny thing is, the pans used to create the first Detroit style pizzas were industrial trays used in auto plants.

In the ad the second text showed up after.
They want to make an attempt to show you more relevant content to your interests and social circles. Facebook at least gives you an option but none of the other major sites do.
I’m so down for large games to start coming to iOS. I would buy an iPad in a heartbeat if I could play AAA games on the go. 
Meh there weren't any of these ships in the Caribbean though. It wouldn't fit with the aesthetic.
It's just because stories aren't chronological anymore. Some stories just get buried if you send and receive a lot of snaps. I like that the articles and spam are separated now but merging chats and stories wasn't very thought out.
Ugh there are so many people. This would suck. I could handle it with 2 or 3 people but 11 is too many.
Looks like you have an excuse to go back!
I've been wanting to learn how to stack images like this for a while but haven't gotten around to it.

How are you able to change the exposure after each shot while still keeping such a clean image? I feel like the scenery would change or you might slightly move the camera.
Why add to BC when you could easily charge for it!
Same for google images. They removed the view image button but if you force touch the image you can see it without going to the site.
NPCs confirmed
The point of the bezel is to give you something to hold while using the phone. If they got rid of those you’d be touching the screen and palm rejection isn’t the best. 
That would be hilarious
It really is a lot of fun too. 

Hate trains are pretty irresistible though. 
Airplay 2 can’t come soon enough. I really want to buy a receiver for my existing speakers. 
New AirPods 😮
That’s how my friends and I look at it lol

We always get killed by people with high level skins
This isn't the soundtrack, just the music you can play in game right?

I really wish there were a separate soundtrack that would play automatically while you play.
I look at it like Fortnite. You instantly know if someone is good based on how they look but ultimately they don't inherently have an advantage. I do sort of wish there was a level system though that would reward you with cooler looking stuff the higher level you are. Oh well.
Anyone know how the kraken works?

Like is it a random event?
Baby plane labor laws are a lot more lax than adult plane labor laws
5 million active players?

I feel like Fortnite has stolen a lot of PUBG's thunder over the past couple of months.
The fortnite website is the epic games website...
On Xbox or PC?
My Epic account is separate from my Xbox account. Can I merge them? I keep getting a message saying my Xbox account is already associated with an Epic account but I never set it up another way.
Screwing over Kinect owners is one of the Top 10 Xbox Betrayals of all time
Gonna try to convince my friends to get it. If they don’t I won’t be getting it either. 
Air Force confirmed this was a training flight
I’m fine with it. 

Siri could be better sure but it’s useful in 99% of my regular use cases. 
Vine was too good for us
Chinesium is in large supply
So cheating back seems like the right thing to do...
This gets me every fucking time 
Is Old Hogan Sips character in his Skyrim play through? I haven't watched at all.
That’s because Sjjn doesn’t gaf 
Cool this is what I was looking for! Thanks. 
This is the same shit they say every year.

I'll save my hype for after the conference.
I like to look at them as haters and losers
**D I V E R S E**
It's snowy and cold
Not sure why you’re being downvoted. His videos are really high quality. 
This update is so fucking cool. It will really help the game feel more full. So stoked to jump back in once it drops!
I’m assuming it’s going to be an Apple Music exclusive
Genuinely curious since I don’t know much about he topic. Does Juanita Broaddrick have proof that Bill raped her?
Pro was just released a few months ago. I can’t see them dropping support so soon. 
It’s a big enough deal that most people who know good UI design know to avoid true black. 
When they redesigned Yosemite a few years ago I thought the icons looked like candy. I wanted to take a bite out of them. I can't really explain it otherwise lol.
I had friends over but everyone went to bed before they called the election.

Almost every mailbox ever opens on both sides. This one just sits in a fence. 
Niiice. This is a bit of a change from previous years in terms of announcements. Excited to see what's in store!
Very nice but there are too many plants imo
He's talking about the fact that the senate is still not confirming all of his picks. This has never happened before for any other president.
And if you really con't want to cut out pop, at least drink sugar free pop and in moderation.

I only drink pop as a mixer/ chaser and making the switch from regular coke to coke zero made a huuuge difference.
AFAIK he was never a part of the CIA before he was appointed Director
I'm Catholic and fully support Pope Francis. He lives his life as Jesus did and is an excellent example of the teachings of Christ. He is an inspiration.

It really bothers me that so many here think he's a "tool for the globalists".

Edit: The comments here are sickening. I've never disagreed with you all more on anything. I'm out for today ✌
Nice!
The IG report comes out next week so Meuller doesn't have long
He's Canadian
She always seems to struggle with stairs...
Can you convince my friends to try it? They don't think it's worth the money...
I would 100% buy it if it were $30 but $60 is highway robbery. Don't get me wrong, the betas were fun but there's nowhere near enough to do for $60.
**A E S T H E T I C**
I'm going to use the 14 day game pass trial to try out the game. If I still don't like it after 2 weeks I just won't buy it. No risk involved!
Honestly just gym shorts and a tank top if I lived somewhere warm. They're just so comfortable!

Xbox head Phil Spencer and Epic both agree with you!

Yes
It’s propaganda...

China is fucking the environment far quicker than they’re saving it. 
You're asking this in /r/iphone. Wtf do you expect?
How nice they’re giving their users free cryptocurrency!

Am I officially old? I watched iCarly growing up but this show was too young for me...
It makes no mention of a closed beta in this link.
Republicans hate McCain too
Hey said controllers support is disabled until they figure out which player pot to put them with. The dev said maybe PS4 pot. 
Worked fine for me
It's literally the only thing to do in the game lmao
Oh for some reason I thought it was a transgender man.

I was like damn he did a good job of looking like a woman! lol

Honestly one of the reasons I feel there is so much hostility in this country nowadays. 

Even just waving at your neighbors as you pass by goes a long way.

They changed the recipe in the 80s so it's been bad for a long time.

I was born well after that so it's never been good in my lifetime.
I hope they offer and he rejects saying it's a meaningless prize.
It completely voided the legitimacy of the award.

They proved that you don't actually need to do anything to earn it.
KFC chicken tastes like trash. I've never understood why people like it so much.
Ah cool. That's a bummer though. Mobile controls are the worst. I can't even imagine trying to build.
Where'd you hear that?
What's the point of this?

They just send you an email when it's available right? I don't think anyone is going to have a problem knowing when it's released.
It's not necessarily the butterfly mechanism that's the problem, it's the travel. They're pushing their laptops to be too thin and reduce key travel by insane amounts. I legit don't understand how Apple employees are comfortable typing on them.
Why do you want to upgrade a 2015 model?
So I have the battle pass on my epic account but not on my Xbox account. How would I go about merging those two accounts. Whenever I’ve tried adding my Xbox account in the past it tells me it’s already linked to an account but it’s just a bunch of random numbers. 
The goal of the wall isn't necessarily to keep people from coming over but to slow them long enough for law enforcement to put a stop to it. There will always be ways over the wall.
Even if it were true, what exactly is illegal about it? Literally nobody gives a fuck.
I would crack if I had to live in one building my entire life. I don't know how he does it.
I can hear it too since it's a video
I play on PC because there's cross play with PS4 and that's what my friend has. Honestly, if you're good at fortnite, there isn't much of an advantage. Luckily we both suck so it doesn't matter anyway!
Shit I just posted this!

We have so much in common :)

Gross dude 
I hope he comes through for your father!

Thank him for me :)
Trump knows more than we do. If he believes NK will honor that commitment, they most likely will. 

I smell a nobel peace prize. 
This. I can’t even connect my Xbox live account to my epic account
Not gonna lie, the last thing I would want to do if I were suicidal would be to call a stranger. 

Maybe that’s just me. 
That’s it?
I mean it makes sense. Most people probably aren’t searching goggles they’re misspelling google. Obviously google is the more popular search engine. 
Pls no
Are you telling me I can't earn a living wage working at McDonalds?!

Racist
Yeah but they’re all just a bunch of nerds
They announced it this morning...
When I was in high school ~2009 I played MW2 online over a 3G modem because that's the only option we had for internet. The only other option was dial up.
My neighborhood still doesn't have access to broadband internet.

The only reason my house was able to get it was through a loophole with Comcast Business. Otherwise they wanted $30,000+ to lay the wires.

Broadband internet infrastructure is appalling in America.
There was an NDA on the previous betas?

Lol that worked...
😱
There's solo. There are also text chat options.
I'm gonna need that comparison shot in an image slider
I just started my first full time job on Monday!

Glad to benefit from all this.
There just isn't any way to spin it
Homepod is expensive

Airpods are awesome
I'm 99% sure they were reacting to the vibration.
I actually laughed at this
Trump has years of political experience.

He had no government experience.
They're saying Putin is behind all this...

Not even fucking joking
#S P I C Y
Starfish
The cone to ice cream ratio is terrible
Please tell me this is photoshopped...
The tariffs were expertly timed as well. China has been put on notice and now that formal talks between NK and Trump are beginning, China has lost a ton of leverage.
My way or the highway kiddo
YES!

I play on PC all the time so I can play with my PS4 friends but when they're not on I like to play solo on my Xbox. I'm not going to spend $10 on the battlepass if I can only use it on one device.

Honestly, if crossplay is that much of an issue, fine. But there is no logical argument to disallow cross progression. It's just a big fuck you to Xbox players.
Be back by 7
I'm more concerned with what a 162 lb. Tyrion would look like...
😱
It completely changed the way I use my iPad. It's so much more capable than it was before.

I need to stop making weekend plans lol
Ayyyy I thought I was the only one that still used alien blue. 
Only President Trump can pardon you
Every day I’m thankful for having the rights I do as an American. 
He’s just a kid so it’s fine. I always think about how I would act if I met the president and First Lady and I feel like I would act with confidence but in reality I’d probably be a nervous wreck. 
iOS 11 was pretty much solely an iPad update...

It changed everything. 
What a concept!
You would only play against PC players if you join a PC player’s lobby. It’s how it works right now with PS4/ PC crossplay. 
Same! I refuse to buy the battle pass until I know I’m not wasting my money.

I play PC all the time to play with my friends on PS4 but when they’re not on I like to kick back in my Xbox and play solo. The fact that cross progression isn’t possible is a fucking joke lol. 
You would only play against PC players if you join a PC player’s lobby. It’s how it works right now with PS4/ PC crossplay. 
Looks like I need to buy an iPad 
This is historic. Absolutely unprecedented. 
I just thought pickles were their own thing idk
I literally never said that! Lmao

I’m so done with this conversation. 
I learned this when I was 18 and my friends would not stop mocking me for it. HOW IS THAT COMMON KNOWLEDGE?!?
This is what fucks me up. My favorite color is green. What if the green I see is different from what everyone else sees...
You're right but we don't actually have any sort of timeline.
Sessions most likely already has something set up and won't need a special council.

Listen I understand that you need a USBC to lightning cable to quicken charge. What I’m saying is that lightning is capable of quick charging. It’s not a difficult concept. 
JUST END IT ALREADY
Clearly lightning is capable of quick charging if you can quick charge your iPhone.....
I never said that. I was saying that lightning and USB C are both capable of quick charging.
Oh they're going to spin it that way anyway. It doesn't matter what's true anymore.
Both
But that wouldn't be 

A E S T H E T I C
That's hilarious
It's the same as Facebook. They know soooo much about you it's insane. But all that data is available to advertisers to use to target ads like you said. They do sort of sell the data in that advertisers do have to pay to access that information and advertise on Google's services.
I really like that green
These could be made into live photos and move as lockscreen wallpapers.

That would be nice but it's a genius marketing scheme that's meant to energize people to be a part of a movement.
 
I don't think any of us will be complacent but I'm worried about those who aren't as aware of politics as we are. 

We all have a responsibility to make sure our friends and family are registered to vote and know who to vote for.
I cannot wait to vote her out!

This will be my first opportunity to do so.
Not something I control my friend

I'm all for supporting countries that uphold our beliefs and values around the world.
Are there any other republican candidates that stand a chance?
Is it yes or no?
That's how eras work...
I hate talking to strangers on games. Like soooooo much.

I will be sticking to text chat solely.
Holy shit I would hate this...
March 20th
I'm gonna do the 14 day trial for the Xbox Game Pass and try SoT out then. If I like it after 2 weeks I'll buy it.
Honestly bummed there isn't some sort of story in this game. I like to play games but it's too much to read comics as well.

Even adding in some sort of optional story quest line would be awesome.
It'll be the start of a new era for the UK.
Honestly we don't need to go any further
Moon landing first
I'm wondering what good it'll do at this point. I guess the more people know about how awful Obama was the better but there is no way in hell this will be reported on.
What is undead cannot die
Why is Jack antisemitic?
Throw Sheriff in there otherwise it looks bad lol
I don’t think it’s even the current US govt. No previous admin has seemed to care either. And honestly it’s not our responsibility to handle foreign workers. Our priority should be our own. 
Reach is best Halo
Reach is already BC but I wouldn't mind being able to play Reach with all the other games.
Wow. Honestly impressed they still have a team dedicated to making this game better.

It's a shame the launch went so poorly though.
Okay tbf the 6 had some major issues that Apple swept under the rug. Like major, serious issues. The GPS on a huge amount just quit working and the battery on most also quit working. Literally everyone I know that owned a 6 had issues with the GPS and their battery. I'm honestly surprised it wasn't a bigger deal.
Yeah, garbage android phones churned out of China faster than you can even say android. 
Or a wireless charger. 
I’ll be holding onto my 7 until at least next year. I swear every phone since the 5s lasts at least 4 years. And the resale value after all that time is still insane!
Why not? He’s pretty useful.

Milk and steak are two of my favorite things. 
Lol that second comment in exhibit B reminds me of the early days of iOS/ Android when the flame wars were at their peak. 

I do not miss those days. 
They’re marketing how much more secure Face ID is than Touch ID though. Wouldn’t make sense for them to be like lol jk forget we said that here’s Touch ID back. 
Pop up cameras have too many moving parts. 
What is 6, Alex
I’m sorry but if you have faith in the FBI after all the shit that’s come out over the past couple of months you’re delusional. So much for having agencies that protect citizens. 
I have a 7 and am in the same boat.
Hellllll no. If you want to live downtown it’ll cost you $1,500ish for a studio. 

5 years ago it was half that. 
I haven't watched Sips in a while because he only streams now. What's this meme?
I still believe that there is momentum from the 2016 election. People are largely aware of how biased the media is and support what President Trump has done so far. They don't want to see the dems screw it up for everyone.

We'll see!
I wonder if it would be possible to make banners invisible on maps so only the titles would show. 

That would be pretty cool.
This gun control thing is going to kill democrats in the midterms.

Trump is playing them so hard.
I think the side bezels are a good size and shouldn’t get any smaller. 
This is baaaaad
But no one can complain about it shrinking and eventually disappearing...
2019 will be my next iPhone then!

It already was going to be, but now there's even more reason!
I'm watching a snowstorm...
1) Why do we need a $200 Homepod? I thought Apple's goal was to make an excellent speaker that happens to have Siri, not compete with Google or Amazon. $200 is still more than their competitors, even if that is their goal with this product.

2.) Creating a cheaper MacBook Air makes no sense within Apple's product lineup. The MacBook is their thin and light option now. They even marketed the non-touchbar MBP as a MacBook Air replacement.
Fuck Rush Limbaugh
Yeah that too
Money baby
We'll never know
Someone mentioned that caves flood now. So if you're in a cave that's under an ocean and break through to it, it'll flood until it's full.

Not sure how true that is but that's what I saw.
I think people are generally complacent for state elections but federal elections are usually a much bigger deal for people. 

Republicans are getting swept this year in state special elections but I think there is still momentum from 2016 for republicans to really come out in droves this year. 

Most people see through the media and support what Trump is doing and don’t want dems to come in and change that. I’m optimistic for midterms this year. 

Just imagine what we could accomplish if we had a full majority in both the house and senate that want to Make America Great Again. Trump would be able to accomplish everything he promised and more!
Tbf dems are destroying us in state legislature elections. 
Uhh this is at my University... what the fuck
She was released
How many times has she been arrested now?

Like 50?
Link?
I'm willing to bet this has more to do with declining cable viewership
No one said anything about abolishing a court system
Only with bright light shining on it. It's very bland and monotone otherwise.
Sewers too
Yeah the S3 lasts forever 
Holy shit reading that made me realize how much of a rinse and repeat this gen has been...
No more ID @ Xbox games too. Last year was such a let down.

All I want is a solid lineup of AAA titles. We're in a very bland era in Xbox.
That game isn't for everyone. I personally hate that play style and have no interest in ever playing it.
What are you talking about?! We have the largest indie collection on any platform!

/s
Racing games really cater to a small crowd and they just aren't that fun. I love Halo but I think it might be time to start winding down that universe. Like someone said above, it's pretty impossible to capture the magic of the originals.

Instead we have games like PUBG which everyone is playing but utterly sucks because it's still in development, Fortnite which is neither cross play with PC nor cross progression with PC unlike PS. I feel like we're just getting screwed more and more in terms of games while PlayStation is flourishing. 
Specifically more AAA titles. Sony has ALL of the major ones. Destiny, Call of Duty, Red Dead Redemption 2, etc. What do we have? Forza? I don't play smaller indie games so the lack of AAA games has caused me to play my Xbox less than I ever have.
Why don’t they let you closer?
I’m don’t have the numbers but I think what he was referring to was engagement. We may be seeing an increase in subscribers but overall engagement may be down. 

Engagement is things like commenting, posting, etc. People who subscribe but lurk aren’t engaging. 
I’ve never been to oovoo javer
He’s been a piece of shit to us since the beginning. It all erupted when we found out he was editing our comments. 
Especially with the shit he pulled before the election. Editing users’ comments and laughing at us when we called him out. 
Engagement doesn’t equal subscribers 
Obama even said that daca was not legal. 
They’re not going to get involved until the lower courts rule. Once the lower courts come up with a ruling, the Supreme Court will intervene if they feel it’s unconstitutional. 
That won’t be until late 2019. Enough time for dreamers to vote in the midterms. 
Actually they can since the 9th circuit court extended daca until the Supreme Court takes the case. 
They don’t have to go back for over a year...
They said a few years a few years ago
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
Wait we don't all do this?
Not a bad idea but not “Apple like” imo. I think it’s beyond the point of hoping for Touch ID to return any any form now that Apple is all in on Face ID. 
Oh yeah TouchID is gone. Honestly don't have a huge problem with that. I have an iPhone 7 so I won't be upgrading for awhile but hopefully by the time I do, Face ID will be much improved.
See for yourself
It’s not inherently a bad thing but it was necessary for Apple’s goal with the iPhone X. Android manufacturers are copying it without implementing the same tech that Apple is within the notch. 
I can’t remember where I read it but I guess Apple was working on both and managed to get to a spot where they were happy with Face ID and dropped working on implementing a touch sensor under the display. Face ID will only get better with time as well. 
What happened to it?
Why so many in Pennsylvania?
It’s probably his name on YouTube. 
Maybe for you. Never skip head day. 
It’s fun if you play with other people. None of my friends are going to get it so I most likely won’t. I’ve played all of the previous tests by myself and it is fun for an hour then you just get bored by yourself. 

Damn
None of the CNN kids were in any of the rooms that were shot up. 
Literally Xi 
So a hotdog is a sub
Nothing personnel, kid
If Trump hasn’t endorsed, a Paul endorsement is the very same. 
I want those stickers
GOOD point
Are we really being labeled?

I know this is a shitpost but idk if there’s a reason for it. 
I’ve had gold for years and didn’t know this 😳
Instantly thought of spy kids when I saw this. 
Wait it isn’t originally their song?!
Isn’t that what the MacBook is supposed to be? I’m so confused...
“I like my Apple products like I like my men...”
I say as long as we do what’s best for Americans, screw everyone else. 
Who cares what everyone else thinks?
It’s been this way for a loooong time. 
Holy shit you guys worship the Obamas don’t you. It’s incredible...
The 9th circuit ruled that Trump cannot let DACA expire so we’re stuck with it until the Supreme Court overturns that ruling sometime in the future. Who knows when that’ll be. 
Yeah after illegals get the chance to vote in the midterms this year. Fuck the 9th circuit. A bunch of lawless assholes. 
I was poking fun at /u/sundryTHIS
It’s alarming that we’re more open to giving communism a voice. I would consider that a very, very bad thing. 
From a moral perspective, I think it’s wrong. It crosses the line imo.

And before anyone asks how I feel about the way large companies treat animals, I absolutely don’t support it. I think it’s disgusting. 
Trump’s administration is also cracking down on pharmaceutical companies and drug execs sooo

Ah fuck 
Dad?
I fully support GMOs but I’m very against lab grown meat. 
I shouldn’t have to troubleshoot my 1000 dollar device
What a douchy thing to say
Wait is 10 small? 
Mt. Pleasant is a shitty town honestly. Most of my friends that went to central couldn’t wait to get out once they graduated. It’s just so gloomy and crappy all the time. 
Lmfao it’s hilarious that for years people were clamoring for a WWII game and now that they’re finally getting it they want modern instead. Nothing will ever make people happy. 
Thanks I’ll give it a shot!
I couldn’t figure out how to take out my weapon. I tried playing for like an hour dodging skeletons and got pissed and quit. I did some research and played the stress tests and I’m much better now. But yeah it’s awful for first time players who don’t know what they’re doing. Hopefully they have guides in the full game. 
I’ve had no issues. Been playing fortnite for the last few hours. 
This embarrassing. It doesn't make us look cool or anything for posting this...
Who honestly cares? How many of you have bought your guns from Kroger? I mean it's your own prerogative to not shop there anymore but it seems silly to protest something like this. You should be buying guns from better places anyway.
Man I would really love to live in California if it weren't unaffordable, trashed, overpopulated, full of illegal aliens, and quickly rotting. It really is a beautiful state being destroyed by people who hate this country. Sad.
Progress carries over from the last scale test
Yeah I remember but they changed it in like september of that year and doubled the ram for both models :/

I was salty lol
They usually do spec updates in June. Tbh would wait until then and get the 2017 model at a cheaper price. Intel has been pretty shotty at updates lately and you likely won't be missing out on anything special.
I have the original model and I'm pissed because about a month or two after release they updated the base model to have 16GB of RAM. Mine only has 8. But it still handles everything great and I plan to use mine until at least 2020.
The title reads like an advertisement for a car...
Dropped my fitbit for an Apple Watch. It's a cool little piece of hardware but I'm still failing to get a lot of use out of it. I thought it would allow me to use my phone less but it's just added more noise to the picture. I don't know what I was really expecting though. It's a strange device.

I was also really looking forward to unlocking my mac with it but it turns out my 2012 rMBP isn't supported. Needless to say I was not happy.
I could care less about the lore. It's the first one I owned and I fell in love. My friends all played Halo since the beginning but they agree Reach was the best. So many fun hours poured into that game with them. Brings back some memories :)
1. Looks very nice. I really like the idea of universal apps and bringing feature parity to Mac. In general, the changes are very nice.

2. I don't like how the menu bar is scrunched on the left. 

3. How would Macs before 2016 utilize the force touch options? Where would movies, podcasts, videos, etc. go from iTunes? How would animojis work with older cameras?
I really liked it though. The multiplayer was awesome.
I was in elementary school ‘00-‘05. Our computer lab was all Mac G3s and it was awesome. 
Nope. This has been happening for years. They use these vehicles to get high quality scans for their 3D imagery. 

Here’s an article from 3 years ago.

I haven’t experienced it either. 
Oh 100%
Reach is best Halo
I used to love Halo. All I played was Halo. Halo 5 was awesome for a few months. Now I could honestly care less about Halo. I don’t know what happened.

The DOJ is far, far from impotent. They’ve been doing some great work. 

https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/nov/30/jeff-sessions-ambitious-justice-department/

> “While eyes are on Russia, Sessions dramatically reshapes the Justice Department,” going on to say that “the attorney general has been among the most effective of the Cabinet secretaries — implementing Trump’s conservative policy agenda even as the president publicly and privately toys with firing him over his decision to recuse himself from the Russia case.”
Huh. So Alien: Isolation was accurate. 
She didn’t 
She never said this...
I hope so
He’s done a ton of good so far in other areas. Swamp draining is by far the most difficult and I guarantee they’ve been building rock solid cases against people since day 1. They’re going to be up against the world’s greatest lawyers and there is literally zero room for error. Legal cases normally take a long time. This is the biggest legal battle in history. 
He’s distancing himself from the Justice Department so that when Sessions starts indicting high profile people like Hillary, his hands are clean. The last thing we want is people looking at this as Trump trying to take down political opponents.
He 100% is. People are being lame and freaking out today. There is absolutely no reason to believe that Sessions isn’t cooking up something good. 
Nope. That’s ridiculous. 
You’re wrong but there’s just something so... charming about you
Seriously. It seems like everyone in this thread has gone crazy. Sessions has been on team Trump before most of us. If he weren't doing his job, Trump would get rid of him. Although, the senate would have to approve the next pick.
They meet in the Oval Office very regularly. People act like they never speak to each other. They know exactly what they're doing.
Sessions was also the first to support Trump. Before Bannon. Before Priebus. Before anyone.
Lmao you're all falling for what Trump is doing. Sessions has always been on our side and nothing has changed. There needs to be a public divide between Sessions and Trump for any high profile person to be prosecuted. If it looks like Trump and Sessions are working with each other it'll look like Trump is jailing political opponents, which is very bad. If Trump gets dems to support the IG and lean more toward Sessions, then the indictments will stick even more. 

This is all political theater and it's unfolding now faster than ever. I don't know when we'll start to see shit hitting the fan but it's coming. Sessions knows what he's doing and he isn't a part of the swamp.
Astrophysics ≠ Climate Science
What kind of hoe ass felt like an electrician by plugging in AV cables?!  They're literally color coded and you're doing the same thing as an HDMI cable. This make me irrationally angry.
Think of it this way, why would I want the top and bottom of my screen cut out for bezels? The notch isn’t great but it at least reflects that Apple wants an entirely full screen device. The notch is just here until they can but that tech behind the display. 
The essential phone did it first and it did pretty well. 
Mainly multiplayer. But I really, really enjoyed Reach’s story. Never really cared much for Master Chief. 
How does this even happen? I have my original order for my 7 almost 2 years ago and it’s mint. Use it daily. 
Just run it under some warm water for a few minutes. Should fix it. 
Lol $500 is a good value. $1500 is high end. 
I have never had this issue on any of my devices. 
Clearly it’s the one I’m subscribed to
Click bait title for the ages
No pictures you zabronis 
I really don’t care. I don’t buy guns anyway. 
That is the blurriest pic of Pluto I’ve seen. 
Seems moist and hot
Holy shit I hate imgur. What a garbage site it’s become. 
Fuck these hats are expensive 
>Assault-style

What the fuck does that even mean?
Can I help?
Trump and Sessions meet very regularly. If you think they haven’t thoroughly planned this out then you’re wrong. 
Nah he’s putting in work
He’s a fucking patriot. 
It’s essential. People would see it as Trump taking down political opponents instead of simply seeing corrupt politicians going to jail. The media controls the narrative. Whatever they say, the public believes. Stupid I know but it’s true. Trump is playing their game and winning. The people have to come to conclusions on their own, not be told what to think. People hate being told they’re wrong after believing something for so long but are more open to changing their beliefs if they do it on their own. 

I don’t know when all this is finally going to happen but I have faith that it will. It’s an impossible game that no one has tried before without failing. We’re witnessing history guys. 
I’ve never been more sure that Sessions is on our side. Trump is trying to get dems to side with Sessions so that when Hillary goes to jail it won’t look like Trump is doing it himself. Also by painting the IG as an Obama guy, the report he drops will be clean of Trump as well. Masterful tweet.

People always complain about theater prices by every theater around me charges about $7 for a ticket. If you want popcorn that can get pricy but the tickets themselves are cheap. I never pay more than $15 for a ticket, popcorn, and a drink. 
>Easy difficultly 

Ha!
Halo 5 is my second favorite behind Reach
If you’ve ever eaten an fruit or vegetable you’ve eaten a gmo.

Yes. Don’t listen to everyone else.

We already put people inside cylindrical metal tubes and fire them off in the sky to a destination. Thousands of times a day.
Having flashbacks to Master Chief Collection day one 😷
You underestimate them. The left is *angry* and angry means energized. These midterms and eventually the 2020 race are going to be tough compared to 2016. This sub needs to get its ass in gear for the midterms this fall because it seems like we think we've already won. We're getting our asses handed to us in special elections around the country and no one is saying a damn thing.
Are they though?
Well when he phrases it like he’s someone else it’s hard to tell. I think it’s a pretty weird thing to do tbh
No the suicide lane is the pedestrian walkway
>"And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you." - Matthew 6:5-6

Same logic applies here. Let success be your reward, not the praise.
He posted this himself lol
Lol this is the lamest thing I've ever read
This turned cringy so fast holy shit
This is yourself.... 

lmfao why not just say that
Throwing my hat in the ring!
It's the dark blocks at the top that make it look like a banana.
This game is a lot of fun but I still can't believe they're charging the full $60 for it. It's worth at most $40. I know they haven't put all the content into the alphas, betas, stress tests, etc. but I can't help but get the feeling that even when all the content is there that it's not worth $60.
"I don't recall"
I'm honestly so bored with Marvel movies. Iron Man and Guardians of the Galaxy are the only really good super hero franchises. That and the Spiderman movies with Toby Maguire. The Avengers movies suck, Thor sucks, the Hulk movies sucked, Captain America movies sucked,  etc.
I wonder when or if we’ll ever see the end of this “investigation”. They’ve been going for a year and all they have is Russian trolls that managed to trick every single type of person, liberal or conservative. Pretending like they had any impact on the election is laughable. 
I have the original controller that doesn’t have Bluetooth so I don’t have experience with that. Sorry. 
It’s already legal which is what makes this situation such bullshit. He should just end it anyway regardless of what they say. But then if he did that, he would’ve be able to pin it on dems as he’s been trying to. 
The second the Xbox app is brought to Mac I will uninstall windows on my Mac. It would save me so much space. 
And fuck McConnell. 
AFAIK the chairman doesn’t have any more power than the other committee members. Just like the speaker of the house doesn’t have any more power than the other members of the house.
Over a year most likely. Now dems don’t even have to try to compromise. The wall and all immigration just suffered immensely. 
People don’t like finding out they’re wrong after believing something for so long. 
Literally says appointed by Obama in that description...
Appointed by Obama
77 million iPhones in one quarter... 

Holy fuck that’s a lot of phones. 
Wigwam?
Trump wants bump stocks banned. So does the NRA. It’s on their website.

Noooooo
I love the colors in Coco
I don’t see anything wrong with that
Who is that guy? I only recognize him from parks and rec.
Well he’d have to do something illegal to be arrested. 
Exactly 
Pretty much. I saw this a lot on job apps. 
I just accepted a salary position that also has overtime. We’ll see what happens. 
It’s definitely still common but yeah lateral moves are very common as well nowadays.
