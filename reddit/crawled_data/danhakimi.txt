Question about camp/cuban collars: since they tend to be worn more open, like v\-necks, are they also meant to show off a muscular chest? Should less muscular men focus on more modest chests?
Respectfully, I think I understand season 1 well enough not to rewatch it, but to say you understand "everything" is simply wrong.
Alright. Thanks. I'm a contractor, and I'm so damn cheap that they'd go bankrupt before cutting me from the budget, and I mostly work remotely, so I've never really had a cause to know what "RA" means.
People keep using the term "RA" to mean something like "fired..." What does it stand for?
Eh, I still suppose it's within the range of "they're just being slow about it." It's perfectly plausible that RPI's internal processes take a couple of weeks here. I'd still assume that they're planning on doing the right thing.
To be really technical, those aren't loafers, they're slippers. No seam around the top.

I don't believe for a second that they can make fries crispy in a microwave, *or* without fat.

Then there's also that insanely corny sound the commercial makes when people bite into them. Shit, carrots don't make that sound.

And finally: the thing looks like it handles about four fries at a time.  All those plates they show, they must have taken a dozen micro\-fries, and by the time you finish the twelfth, the first set is going to be cold.
Definitely OP. 4 mana is a better stampeding kodo \(targeted\). Spellstones are normally balanced around bad \-\>fairish\-\>good.
Ideally, you get a lawyer.

If you aren't worried about making sure you do this legit every step of the way...

Get a price in mind, try to write a straightforward license, go to the team's website, or adidas's, figure out who to contact, let them know, and offer them a license. They'll probably want to either pay or replace the photo. Nobody wants to be infringing copyright.
I hadn't, either, until a friend of mine went to London, and said that that's how you spell it there. She pointed to a particular establishment that sells the things, but can't spell the word.
Cost per wear.

it was a bit of a joke.
$5... 31 years... what's the CPW on that?
some of you people spell it "beigel." Can we agree that they're awful.
I was informed that certain London communities spell it "Beigel." Will you aid me in correcting their evil ways?
Where the hell do you people get off spelling "bagel" wrong? I understand and accept that we're going to have differences, but "bagel" is fucking holy.
Eh, that factor won't hurt you. Nobody's taking you seriously, nobody's going to be confused into thinking you're making official Batman content... But eh, it's probably not going to help you much.
The word "batman" is way too short for copyright protection.

It probably carries a trademark, though, and... Well, I don't know much about trademark law, but your name is really dumb and will cause no confusion, so you might be safe.

Well, it desends where you're wearing them, but generally/traditionally, dress pants are supposed to break on the pants, or at least touch the pants. 33/32 is probably your best bet.
Chino shorts. They're cargo shorts minus the cargo pockets.

Ohhh, I see. You might be too close to the TV, so it might be reasonable to sit on your bed, but then again, some people say you shouldn't do anything on your bed but sleep.
I'm aware of it, but it's not much for advice, more of a "here's a photo of what I did" sub. Of course, people are free to ask there.
Well, is that the best position for you to watch TV from? do you mind that you can't really watch it from your desk? You could switch the tv and the closet, and then you'd be able to swing that chair around and watch the TV from there... Or you could just watch TV from your bed.
I mean, that's one of the reasons. The main reason is that they're a sham organization designed to advertise at people and charge them for it, not help people.
CT is mostly non\-iron.
What kind of socks are you wearing?
You can keep the jeans, switch to, say, band tees or plain black/white/gray tees or something, throw in some rings or chains maybe to maintain the effect of the zippers... and, for the shoes... I got no idea, man, out of my wheelhouse here.
Generally strongly negative. Cargo shorts add completely unnecessary bulk and don't really present any advantage over chino shorts unless you're really desperate for the pockets.

That said, like most things, it's not impossible to use them well. Just not easy, or worth it.
Nice! Do you know if Yanko sells seconds? I'm a patient man, and I just love watching for Meermin seconds on eBay.
Remember that, since Verizon is one of the biggest employers in the state, it's got a lot of clout here. Maybe not enough to stop this... well, we'll see.
Ohhh, yes, Darn Tough are great. For some reason I kept thinking to anonymousism and chup and then a bunch of dress sock brands, but yes, Darn Tough would make the casual list.

Oh, there's no way Farouk hasn't caught onto that. The question is, does Farouk know what his weakness is? Does he know how to answer it? If not, is he afraid?
Amy's totes still there.
But Oliver isn't resisting much of anything.
I know he's underestimating Farouk... But is Farouk underestimating Oliver too?
We know that Xavier is stronger than Farouk and that David at least has potential to be much, much stronger than Xavier.

The problem is, as we know from their wrestling match, they're currently on even footing, and David might need to unleash some other personalities or some shit to access his powers.
Narrators being sure doesn't mean they're reliable. Nick Caraway was sure about a lot of shit. Didn't make him right.
BITCH STOP QUESTIONING THIS SHIT.
No, you can't.
People keep using the word "killed." Who said there was a killing involved?

Shoving two minds into one body is just so much more... Plausible.
Right. I understand that. That's perfectly reasonable. But I'm on a grandfathered unlimited plan. I want full quality, and I'm only using the app because the main app is unusable. So for me, it's a problem.
Actually, I see what's happening now. On desktop, in the redesign, the last underscore is, for some reason, not treated as part of the link. Take out the underscore, and you'll see the issue.
I mean, one in a million is a lot higher than it should be, but this looks higher than I would have thought...
I mean, it's *really* easy to leave android to the defaults. Their notification sound file had to come from somewhere. They didn't just accidentally drop that in there and accidentally set it to be their notification sound, did they? It takes code and an audio file to do that, and those things take up space, so there couldn't possibly be a performance or app size benefit.

I imagine that they *really* want their custom sound, and they couldn't be bothered to give us the option because of app size and also because they really want us to use theirs. But it's definitely not an accident.
Are you implying that other colors exist?
No, it hasn't. They've only hidden the price somewhere.
Am I the only person who likes it when apps use my system notification sound to notify me instead of hard coding an ear\-grating piece of shit ping?
I have one small objection and one big one. The small one is that it compresses photos. The big one is the god damn nofification sound.
What about ads?
It's basically facebook messenger from a few years ago, without stupid features, but with some new stupid features, like heavy compression of photos, and a hard\-coded custom notification sound that can't be changed.

It's miles ahead of the main messenger.
Well, I'm more about dark linen \-\- the navy one really speaks to me \-\- but yeah, I'll use the white one as a poolside thing.
Just stumbled back on this \-\- I got one of those half zips. It's a little transparent \(I was stupid enough to get it in white\), but it was $14 so fuck it.
* Blazer: structured might be better. What's your budget? Not charcoal. Navy. Yeah, go navy.
* Shirt: You could go with a dress shirt \(poplin or a few other materials\) or an OCBD. Either way, white is the safest color, as it pairs with everything well. Do you have a Charles Tyrwhitt or Brooks Brothers near you?
* Shoes: a chukka is a little too casual here. Do you have dress shoes? What's your budget for dress shoes? \(Now: raise it a bit. What's your budget now?\)
* Are you avoiding a tie?
Well, they're way cheaper than the cheapest good dress shoes there are, so that's red flag number one.

Their website describes things vaguely. It says that the construction is god, but doesn't actually say anything about how they're constructed. It lists a few materials, including pvc, but it doesn't tell you which material is used where \-\- it doesn't specify a leather sole or anything, it just says that there's leather somewhere in the shoe. It doesn't say anything about the quality of the leather.

Finally... looking through their designs, there are a few that don't look terrible, but most do look terrible. Like, next time I need an example of what an ugly dress shoe looks like, I might visit their site. Brands that make quality shoes usually also make them look okay.

Anyway, you posted her instagram, presumably as evidence of your statement...
No part of that instagram makes me think she might be a model. Private, few followers, few following, few posts...

Which means that there are *two* women who spell their names in that ridiculous way.

To clarify \-\- 31 is your full\-length pants inseam, but shorts have, naturally, a shorter inseam \-\- usually 5, 7, or 9 inches.
For the shorter one: roll up the sleeves and call it a summer shirt.

Saphir Super Invulner \> swims.
1. Have at least two pairs. Give each pair 24 hours to rest after wearing.
2. Get them shined every now and then. You can do this yourself or pay other people to do it \-\- the latter comes with a foot massage.
3. Before your first wear, shoot 'em up with Saphir Super Invulner and condition them with some conditioner from Saphir or Lexol. That will help them last longer, and the Super Invulner in particular will help them handle the snow and rain and salt. Oh boy, the salt.
4. I'd recommend either a dainite \(high\-end rubber\) sole, or a leather sole with a rubber topper \-\- Allen Edmonds calls this a combination/tap sole. This will help protect the soles from rain and snow and salt even more.
5. Stick Cedar Shoe Trees in them when you ain't wearing them.

Dude, you're talking full northshire here.
Ehhhh sure. Now, is there one of these in warrior?

Edit: molten blade, I guess, except even if you got so lucky, you'd have to do it on turn 9\+, and you can't do it in a jade deck, so congratulations, you spent 12 mana for 9/10 in stats and a 2/3 weapon, that's very bad.
He was asking the technical question. Obviously it would be pretty busted with heroic strike and rockbiter.

Actually, I designed an otk once around a mega\-windfury weapon with one durability. The idea was, play 2x rockbiter, attack, equip the weapon, brann, greenskin, finish.
Yeah.
Maybe this could be good with shadowblade and doomerang, but it's a hell of a combo for not that much benefit... and, also, as you said, the wrong class.
For some reason, copies of kingsbane don't keep the buffs.
Is there any weapon where 1 durability or the battlecry or the deathrattle is worth the full cost of the weapon.
Throw in a questing adventurer at some point.
Thanks for the feedback. I've considered something along these lines... but the whole thread is ideally supposed to communicate that. Hopefully, if the thread has enough good discussion, you can glean which value is right for you. People here tend to recommend the most expensive thing you can stand to pay for overall, with a few exceptions \(Uniqlo tees, Meermin shoes, maybe levis... although people here love raw denim\).

So... what does everybody think? Keep the format? Add a new category? Do something else?
Throw a rock down the street and you'll hit five amazing tailors.

I have a list of tailors who make great suits sorted by price, but I haven't looked into custom sweaters. I just looked at a few I know about, and they're mostly focused on suiting, shirts, overcoats, etc. Ask again, in this thread, where you can get a custom sweater/cardigan in NYC, and you might find a better answer.
Ask a dry cleaner?
Sleeves are way too long, but rolling them up is a fair solution. Neck also looks big \-\- did you try a size down?
Yeah. I mean, not every tailor can make a custom sweater, you need to know a good one to go to. And it won't be *cheap*. I'm sure somebody in this sub has recommendations for the nearest city, but we'd need to know what that city is.
I guess age demographic, yeah
Well, but... from everything you suggested, Levi's is going to dominate, and it might actually be too expensive for some people, right?

Eh, whatever, 0\-1\-2\-300 looks fine.
Is it reasonable to have a "cheap" tier under the levis tier? I generally feel that the sub needs to try harder to at least address the people who come here wanting to spend very little, if only to explain why that's not a great idea, or why it might be better to thrift than go to H&M or the like.
I know that it was more recent, but it's 23 years old \-\- it's not really recent at all. I just figured old classic vs old cover...

Whatever. No skin off my back, I just think it's weird.
I've been wearing my PRL boat shoes sockless for about four summers, and... well, I've never smelled them, what are people doing sniffing their shoes?

Eveningwear at 3pm is mathematically wrong.
Am I the only one who frequently goes to weddings with "black tie" on the invitation where almost nobody is wearing a tux?
Summer *where* and *when*? Indoors after 6, black tie is totally correct. Outdoors after 6, they might still mean it. During the day, they're wrong, just wear a suit and tie that don't boil your skin.

A lot of people, in my experience, say "black tie" and don't mean it.

* Does anybody have an inspo album I can throw in there?
What? No, he and I knew that a cummerbund goes with a tux...
What does it say in the title? "Unique."

That said \-\- getting one custom made is always a solution here.
Hmmmm... how about loake? [https://www.loake.co.uk/nicholson.html](https://www.loake.co.uk/nicholson.html)
Try on the shirts and the suits. You picked two good stores to buy from.

For ties... Eh, neither CT nor SS is a home run in value. I have a CT tie, and it's not bad, but... My best ties are Bigi ties from Barneys, bought on clearance for $20, and they normally go for a *lot* more. So look at Barneys or something on clearance, go to some sample sales \(Drakes has sample sales here now and then, they're a great option\)... and with a bit of patience, you'll get a better tie for cheaper.
Or better yet, make phones with batteries designed to last more than two years. I'd have been so happy to keep my Nexus 6P for another year now, except for the fact that its battery lasts about fifteen seconds.
If you think you'll be able to afford $100 a month for \~24 months, try it. And then 20 months from now, buy yourself that thing you want, enjoy the interest you earned, and enjoy the next four months' worth of $100 payments saved. And this way, if it turns out that it's too difficult to save all that money, then maybe you'll change your mind and say that you really can't afford to spend all that much on a leather jacket \-\- and you can say that, because you haven't signed a contract to pay more than it's worth.

Paying interest \-\- high interest \-\- to get a luxury slightly sooner is just silly.

Patience pays. \(Especially because you might run into a great leather jacket at a sample sale and save $1400 in less than the two years you could have spent waiting\).

Finally... Note that this is how the great depression happened, only then, people were buying refrigerators, which are more useful than leather jackets.

Oh boy I gotta add this to the bot.
Charcoal is super versatile. Go nuts.

The bigger issue might be the fit \-\- how do they fit? The website shows them fitting baggy and *way* too long on all the models.
Are they selvedge? Tapering selvedge denim *might* ruin the selvedge, or might not...
Oh, for sure. I was too lazy to shave, I was just going to my buddy's house \(except for a quick excursion to a&f\). But I usually go around clean shaven.

My awful facial hair is a problem, though... I'm going to have to deal with my thinning hair at some point, and the ideal solution \-\- losing it all \-\- doesn't seem like it's going to work for me. My head isn't shaped right, and I can't really pull off the bald\-beard thing, so... fuck.
It definitely fits.

Note that, in Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Ozymandias," Ozymandias is quoted as calling himself, in the inscription, "King of Kings." This might be relevant insofar as the promo is referencing another insanely famous poem... But I don't actually think so, I'm just putting it out there.
Or they intentionally avoided it, either to maintain the mystery, or because both options here are bad.
The problem is, unlike in that poem, this fork in the road actually seems like it might make a difference.
You can still wear sneakers in winter, but if you want to handle snow, you might want to go to boots. Chukka boots and \(does somebody have a word for plain boots? like... work boots? or something?\) are pretty casual, chelseas and wingtips are a little versatile, and then dressy balmoral boots are your dressy option.
Levis. "Athletic" fits generally mean large at the thighs but a somewhat tight taper, so regular/relaxed/athletic straight or something might work better. I don't know the right numbers off the top of my head, but you should probably try them on in person anyway \-\- buying levis online is risky.
Yeah... I've been too cheap to purchase polishes, and I figure I might as well get them polished in the city as needed... simpler that way, right?
Nice. Are those shoes antiqued? Or what?
Did you get measured in person? or order online?

The most obvious problem to me is the ass. You also have a collar gap \-\- that's not good. The side/back of your suit collar/lapel should lie flat against your body, that gap is a telltale sign of a bad fit.

You might consider socks for the ceremony \-\> sneakers for the reception, if you feel like it. It's your wedding, and you're going to be on your feet, dancing, all night. I've seen people slip into sneakers to do that.

Or maybe the pumps for as long as you can wear them, and slip into sneakers when you take a break because your feet are starting to kill you.
Yeah, but it was a solid, constructed-qaulity tempo tool, so I'm sure this would work in tempo warrior.
Good. Good fit. I would have gone with peak or shawl lapels, and I'd recommend socks with a tux and pumps... But yeah, you're good, have fun.
It can't go face, but AH usually didn't go face anyway. So yeah, this is super strong.
You can get relatively casual unstructured blazers with soft shoulders and patch pockets.

You could also get a Harrington or field jacket or bomber or something, but those are mostly outside things.

You might want sweaters. Cardigans are the buscas equivalent of hoodies. V\- and Crew\-neck sweaters are good too. But these aren't really summery.
Socks: Either match your socks, or match your shoes, or go stark contrast.
It's... fine, but I would suggest either a white OCBD or a navy linen button down. Linen, since it wrinkles, is naturally more casual, and since it looks like linen, it's naturally more summery. And since it's transparent, navy works. But navy for an OCBD is... eh, fine, but maybe finer in colder weather. OCBDs are a little thick for summer, but if you want them anyway, go for light colors.
I'm an attorney, I'm allowed to talk about the law.
My navy linen shirt is one of my favorite items, and it works in the summer. Maybe not as well as a lighter color, but it definitely works.

That said, for an OCBD, white is better.
An internship can further a career.
That's really the main point of class actions. Incentives and fixing society. The reason attorneys make money off them is because we want attorneys to bother doing them.

I'm aware, but why do you want to prioritize drawing the pirates? The pirates aren't the best or most important cards in the deck, ever. You're paying 2 Mana, not even to draw them, but to target them for your next draws.
Yeah, I mean, it is linen. Cool. Thanks.
It's best in a non\-pirate deck that has cause to tutor a pirate. A tempo rogue might be the best example \-\- this guarantees that you'll draw both of your 2/1 for 1 charges asap. You probably don't want that in Miracle, though. Any combo deck really prefers to draw its combo pieces late, not early, and it's not like there are pirates that are also board clears, or anything.
I think you want to target the kingsbane and 3/1 to draw \-\- drawing pirates *first* seems worse, not better.
Oh, wow, you looked young. The sneakers and graphic tee both kind of scream 20s.

The pants are a very slim fit, maybe skinny, and a little long, which is why you're getting that bunching near the bottom. This is kind of something hipsters did 5 years ago. It's not necessarily bad today, but I'd go for something not quite as slim. \(Some people in this sub are going outright *wide*, but the difference between "wide" and "baggy" is tricky and they are.... well, that's not happening for a while, so don't worry about it.\)
Generally: buttons, particularly situations with buttons at the neck \(polos and henleys\), are good for dudes who want to show off their sweet chest muscles. Does that sound like the look you want to go for? If not: I'd stick with one polo in case your friends demand your presence on a golf course, and avoid the henley for crew neck tees.

Short sleeve button downs *can* be okay. But you know what's usually better? Long sleeve button downs with the sleeves rolled up. I don't hate 5, but eh.

Finally, I don't love logos, and Original Penguin is not the world's most amazing brand, so I wouldn't wear that one... personally, anywhere, but again, if that's your emergency polo, whatever.

What are you going for here? Are you going for a casual summer button down? Or business\-casual look? or what?
Linen half zip from Abercrombie. It's a little transparent. Is it too transparent? [https://i.imgur.com/DDawBka.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/DDawBka.jpg)

Especially good: working at a company that will further a career that will pay you *much* more in the long run.
So you think he was, like, a *professional* troll?
It really depends on how fat. In some brands I'm a slim, in others I'm a relaxed. If you're significantly bigger than me, you might still be a regular in some brands, relaxed in others, not fit into others at all...

It also depends on height and other proportions. If you are super tall, you can size way up. If you're short and very fat, life will be harder.

The moral of the story is the moral of most of our stories. **TRY SHIT ON.**
Those aren't fake tuxes, they're fake real suits.
Yeah, I mean, that could work.

How do you feel about the shirt in general?
Are you sure? There are trolls on Reddit.
Your plan sounds fine.
Got this weird linen half zip from Abercrombie, and I'm feeling it. https://i.imgur.com/DDawBka.jpg.

Buuut it's a little transparent.

An undershirt might defeat the purpose of linen...

What are we thinkin'?
In this price range, it's perfectly plausible to go mtm. Luxire or something.

Or unis or something.
I can tell that this is a joke, but...

If the character weren't so extremely dingustacular, I'd feel for him. The things he struggles with are all real problems -- places where most of us accept a shitty compromise -- and it would be nice to date a woman who understands my passions.
First of all, he was able to *limit* the proprietary code on his phone, which is a good thing.

Second, you said it yourself, as an experiment. For reporting purposes. I found it *very* helpful.
Wire is another Free slack alternative.
Yeah, but I'm saying they're not. Maybe in neighborhoods I don't visit often.
Not particularly. New yorkers wear a huge variety of shoes, but I mostly see dress shoes... And no clear pattern to the sneakers.

The masses love Cole Haan, that's a thing.
That's what the title of the thread means. That one angle is taken from the top\-down, aka from the sky, aka aimed at the crotch, aka from the shooter's perspective \(okay, there's a slight difference between the sky and the shooter's perspective, but nobody cares\). Whatever the hell you want to call this angle, that's what the thread is about.
I can relate to people outside of my spectrum, the problem was that this was an intellectually\-themed event, and intelligence was kind of the name of the game. If we'd all gone bowling, it might have been different... But bowling isn't as much fun as philosophy.
>Maybe new cars are not being designed

I know it's the internet, but I thought the sarcasm was pretty obvious. Cars and clothes see *plenty* of design work. *Obsessive* design work. *Tons* of design work.
It's the comments. The main photo is basically a joke. The comments are photos taken from a certain weird angle.
Naw, we had very similar discussions within our law school, and it's different when everybody is kind of on a similar intellectual footing. The conversation at this event was just kind of... Dumber, and slower, and people took their time explaining things that were pretty obvious, really.
It was specifically at a meetup.com event. I don't know what it is about that site, but it really attracts people who bore me. Most people I meet, generally, are really cool.
If you wanna dress it down, keep it untucked, roll up your sleeves, something like that. Maybe leave it open and wear a tee under it.
There's always the sub fave [common projects](https://www.barneys.com/product/common-projects-achilles-low-top-sneakers-503141872.html) \(and the thousands of lookalikes that people keep recommending here\).

What about something like [these](https://www.deltoroshoes.com/collections/mens-slippers-1/products/cream-velvet-slipper) slippers, or [these](https://www.deltoroshoes.com/collections/mens-slippers-1/products/sand-suede-everyday-loafer-with-crepe-sole) with a crepe sole?

There are other kinds of loafers \-\- and also drivers, which are more casual. Nothing in that space?

There's also [allbirds](https://www.allbirds.com/products/mens-wool-loungers?variant=1801962913799), but if you go with these, the /u/metcarfre *might* come into your room and chop your feet off with a rusty hatchet, he *really* hates them.
Don't wear a sweater with shorts. I'd vote button down, or maybe polo \(without the sweater\). I'd also vote nice jeans or chinos instead of the shorts, but eh, that's less important.
I would try something like unstructured mid gray \-\- you'll be close enough to "formal" and also close enough to appropriate that nobody can tell the difference, and that you're not melting. Maybe even a linen tie, and then you can even take that off if it turns out to be unnecessary.

... maybe.
I agree. But there comes a certain point where... [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) is mostly wrong rooms, for me. Not trying to be a pompous ass, but.... the point is, it's hard for me to find open events that work for me. Usually, legal events do it, but a lot of those are weirdly expensive...
Sorry, yeah, they're around 500\+... I was hoping to find nice Warbies, but the all acetate ones were too wide, and a few friends pointed out that the main problem was the acetate sticking out on the ends. And then I saw these, and they not only didn't have that, but... Damn, they're fine, you know?

I've never heard of SEE \-\- are those good? How would they compare to WP? I think I'd prefer black, but... Is there a place I could try these on?

The OPs are nice, but still feel too pricey...

Hmmmm... I didn't realize there was a difference between "p3" and round... I was told that round sunglasses would be good...

I might need to go elsewhere for lenses, anyway, so if there are optical frames that do the job...

Also, I should ask: is it just me, or do these look good? Do I have bad taste in sunglasses?

Edit: oooh, I could try them on in store, and then order these off ebay: [https://www.ebay.com/itm/OLIVER\-PEOPLES\-OV\-1104S\-MP2\-Sunglasses\-Black\-Blue\-glass/312081495955?epid=2020112211&hash=item48a981b793:g:P7IAAOSwuMZZBCHe](https://www.ebay.com/itm/OLIVER-PEOPLES-OV-1104S-MP2-Sunglasses-Black-Blue-glass/312081495955?epid=2020112211&hash=item48a981b793:g:P7IAAOSwuMZZBCHe)
I'm not saying not to do this, but...

Sometimes, I go to an event that sounds like fun, but the people there kind of suck, and the event is nowhere near that much fun in person, and I end up bored out of my mind.

... but yeah keep trying until you find the magic juice.
>I'm sorry that your this upset by this, I guess you buy a lot of your clothes from Zara or something idk.

No, I've never purchased anything from Zara. There's nothing personal about this except you accusing innocent people of theft when you openly admit that they didn't do anything that constitutes theft.

>But just cause the law doesn't protect clothing designers that well doesn't make it shitty.  

The law protects clothing designers as well as it needs to. You've provided no evidence that it should "protect" clothing designers in any other way, nor that they are in any danger which demands protection.

>Like if you had ford's making mustangs but then Bord's down the street  was selling the exact same car just made cheaper ford would probably sue  the shit out of them, designers just usually can't 

I mean, are they ripping off Ford's logo? Are they using patented features from the car? Or are they just copying the shape and color and other features that Ford can't sue over? Because if it's the stuff that's perfectly legal for Bord to copy, then no, Ford wont' and can't sue.

I guess that explains why nobody designs new cars or clothing anymore. You can't sue people, so you might as well not do it, right?
>Yeah, a monumental change that makes it weaker.

\+1 damage makes it weaker?

>The best shaman elementals are even

Alright, let me dumb this down for you. The best Shaman elementals are actually the Neutral elementals Fire Fly and Tar Creeper. Fire Fly and Tar Creeper are odd.

>No, but saying "WE MIGHT GET A LUCKY DISCOVER" doesn't exactly scream "this is a good deck"

What if I said, instead, "we'll almost certainly get at least one insanely overpowered discover option from Blazing Invocation, and probably another one from Stonehill, and that's just one overpowered feature of an already overpowered\-looking deck." What about that?

>For 5 mana. What a bargain.

Yeah. Evolve is one mana. Drawing three more evolves and casting them all is 4.5ish \+ 3 mana. 5 armor is about 1 mana. So yeah, a bargain. Especially if you combo it with Dopplegangster for five nine drops.
Uh\-oh! You copied the word "just" when you quoted me \-\- that makes you a thief, right?

>The only thing they're not doing is \<stealing\>, so I called it stealing because I wanted people to think it was bad. Although I still can't explain anything bad about it.
https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/844jel/_/
You're not stealing from either brand. You're copying in a way that is perfectly legal. But you're competing with the small brand in a rude way, whereas you're not competing with the big brand at all.
It's also not stealing. It's just copying.
Any cheaper alternatives to these Thom Browne shades? https://i.imgur.com/9VGx5UM.jpg (top pair).

Not too cheap, they'll need expensive lenses anyway.
>But then you're running elven archer.

No, you're running *doubled* elven archer. It's a different fucking card. You can't complain about how weak the weak version of the card is \(which is not that weak, but actually pretty fair\) when the card in question is straight up buffed from it. It's like I told you, "let's take silverback patriarch and give it \+2/\+2. wouldn't that be OP?" and you replied, "yeah, but then you'd be running Silverback Patriarch, so... no? I guess?"
> but since we're talking today without any changes in foreseeable future this is a moot point 

*This card* is a huge change. It is a monumental, always\-on, start\-of\-game effect.

> Stone sentinel battlecry blows unless you make an Odd AND and an elemental deck \(without the best shaman elementals\)

What are you talking about? Fire fly and tar creeper are odd.

>Blazing invocation=RNG 

What is your point? That all discover cards are bad?

>Thrall is pretty bad not to mention RNG as well.

Not sure what your point is RNG\-wise... But double thrall is definitely pretty fucking strong. Four evolves in one, dude.
>No, elven archer, kobold apprentice and the card that's too garbage to remember are still garbage.

They are absolutely OP as balls and you know it.

>Actually most odd cards have shit  battlecries, you can look them up. You listed basically every single  good one and I'm not sure it's worth it, even if you get amazing  discovers.

I didn't come close. Stone sentinel, earthen ring, mct, gorgonzola, corpse raiser, fungalmancer, stampeding kodo, blazecaller, volcanosaur... note that I still haven't left standard, and that I've only been focusing on doubleable battlecries.

I also didn't mention Blazing Invocation.

And... you're "not sure" it's worth it? What happened to "anybody who could possibly even briefly think this is close to worth it is retarded to the point where he should be shot and killed?"

>Now consider the fact that you're throwing away prime removal and you  have it, this is the equivalent of shooting yourself in the leg. 

What removal? Lightning Storm? Volcano? Ohhh, you mean post\-nerf hex. Eh. I get four spells from Witch's Apprentice. I'll live.

Note that I also keep Shaman's best heals, and make one of them better.

Shaman doesn't have a lot of great card draw to begin with, but it doesn't really lose any from this restriction, huh?
First of all: a strawman is not a valid form of argument, but at least it's better than plain, unadorned insults.

Second of all: yes, with a doubled battlecry, elven archer is obviously OP. I don't see the need to explain that to you \-\- no amount of evidence is going to turn you into an adult.
>Unlike Shaman, Paladin doesn't rely on odd cards all that much.

Pointing out what it doesn't do isn't an explanation of what it couldn't do with the right support.

To be clear, the most OP card in Paladin, by far, is even.

>That's right, they all suck

Except witch's apprentice and hot spring guardian and stone sentinel and blazing invocation and, if you double it, thrall, and also neutral cards, and also wild exists.
Still fewer self-contradictory statements than one President.
Elven Archer and blazing invocation might be op.
Fungalmancer would be better than most of your five drops.
It could be cancer *or* controllish, up to you.
This is like me talking shit about even paladin because it can't run lost in the jungle. No deck is strong because of what it can't do. You can't make fun of a deck by focusing on the cards it isn't running.

I have no idea why I'm talking to you.
People don't like talking with assholes. That said, I just attacked your idiotic point about the deck you can't make with points about the deck you can make. Come at me.
Because he's cursing people out for thinking something op would be viable. Every part of what he wrote was both rude and stupid.
I don't know why you're focusing on the cards you can't play. What about all the cards you can? This card even makes crappy cards like elven Archer and kobold apprentice and the 1/1 summon a 2/3 op. And then we can talk about good cards, like shaman's new froggy, stonehill, hot spring, fire fly, servant of kalimos, etc. Your discovers can get you op even battlecries btw. You also get to keep lightning storm and volcano.

And if you go into wild, shit gets even more bonkers. Dopplegangster is 10/10 for 5. If you combine it with dk, you get five nine drops. You can run Azure Drake and loatheb.
It doesn't really buy you time, though, since it resets you.
There's no "problem," and the laws are not "outdated." This is just copyright law as intended.
Fortunately, we have some reviews coming?
In the result. If people don't care about the thing they're getting, but only about the marketing behind it, then there's no need for any sort of quality anymore -- society is founded purely on smoke and mirrors.
There are decks that run a 1 Mana 2/2, that card is pretty damn strong. And so is the 1 Mana 1/3 taunt.

I'm not sure *how* op this would be in zoo, but at the very least, you'd run it.
Maybe the condition works before, but the effect works after?
Fwiw, my own office is full of old farts who dress in the same buscas every day. And I work remotely some. But still, I really don't see a ton of white sneakers.
There's a difference between buying something, and buying the vague promise of something. These people bought the latter.
No. I guess you see them more around here, but I really don't.
As a New Yorker... White sneakers seem relatively rare to me, I mostly only see them on this sub.
You know, I like the yellow. The low light photo bores me, but the more saturated ones make it look like a dope statement piece.
People keep saying this, but I still haven't seen it out in the wild. A few years ago, it was inevitable. Is it imminent yet?
I mean, I don't dislike rules. A lot of people here are looking for very basic advice, and rules are easy. It's so much harder and less effective to say "well, you can wear cargo shorts if..." Than it is to say "if you're asking, then no, you can't wear cargo shorts."
Why the fuck do I browse this sub? Why do I do this to myself?

Where can I get this immediately?
Sweet and Sour and Spicydough
Oh yeah, and I'll work on some too... It's just a little frustrating when I see a useful guide or discussion get like 30 upvotes and a pointless article hating on people gets 8000.
Okay. To clarify, I don't have a problem with you. I don't even really have a big problem with the people who fell for the marketing and went around yelling about the movie for a year. My problem is with the marketing team. And I know that all they did was their jobs, but way too effectively... but, to be fair, I think all marketing is evil, and it's just a matter of degrees.
Ohhh right, it's a midnight release thing. I gotcha.

Well, pretty good is good, as long as it sends *some* people *somewhere* a wake\-up call that hype and quality are not the same thing, and sometimes it's worth waiting for reviews.
Right, I know when it happened, it was rhetorical. I'm just saying... I didn't really notice. I kind of just *assumed* there were some other bad 10 drops somewhere.
Is it out? I thought it wasn't out yet.
It's not optimism... it's a certain... certainty some people seem to have. It's fine that people are interested and optimistic and looking forward to it, but it's so weird that people were hyped for it a year in advance and that it's already shattering box office records before release and... is that not strange? Is it all in my head?

It's mostly my annoying because of the whole pre\-order/pre\-purchase phenomenon. It happens with video games too. People will pay for something *before* reading a review or hearing a friend say it was good or having any good reason to buy it, purely due to marketing. And soon, production studios will decide... quality doesn't matter, only marketing matters. Only marketing affects sales.

The problem isn't their enjoyment, it's the way the market reacts to the shift in purchasing patterns and incentives.
Well, there's also the fact that you can afford this, and the AEs are nice\-looking, and you know what shoes are good and where to buy them and how much to pay, and you can afford to be patient... But for somebody who wants to buy a pair of shoes for a wedding in two days and doesn't have the time to do research or anything, and doesn't have pockets deep enough to blow $400 on shoes, and doesn't really care that much how great they look, we need to be able to say, "yeah, staffords are... okay."
Oh... Geeze, looking again, 10 is above 20 stat points on average, when did that happen? Shit.
And when in doubt, it's always better to overestimate than underestimate. If they expect business casual and you go in in a navy suit, you'll probably be fine, but if they expect a suit and you go in in chinos and a blazer, that will probably reflect a little bit poorly on you.
I think it's kind of funny that every photo in your album had a pocket square.

But you're right, avoid pocket squares for an interview.
eh.
It's not about whether or not people enjoy it. It's about the way people are assuming it's going to be good. Which I imagine is 100&#37; rooted in marketing, and very strange considering there have been no reviews whatsoever and nobody without a financial interest has ever seen the film.
Why not? It is reminiscent of the old iPod naming pattern \-\- they just called them all "iPod" and, if somebody asked, there was a year under that.
It's like... Killshots are such an annoying meme that the threads saying "ugh, stop worrying about killshots, here are some alternatives" are also an annoying meme, and even complaining about those threads is an annoying meme. And there's no reason fo any of it, at all.
I feel like this sub has been upvoting some objectively awful shit lately. Cost per wear was fine, but wonky for reasons discussed in the comments there... There was the really popular one saying "oh no men are fine with not being as obsessed with fashion as we are, what a tragedy!"

And then... anything with the word "killshot" in it gets a thousand upvotes easy. It's gotten to the point where even "killshots are overhyped, here are easy alternatives" threads are annoying.

And even some good threads kinda weird me out... like the one comparing two different models of stan smiths, I mean, yeah, the dude went into a lot of detail, but... do we really need that much detailed information about Stan Smiths? Do we really want it? Fuck, what happened to telling people how to match colors and shit?

... I'm allowed to be like this in a rant thread, right?
>[Stromae](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGJAkyTgwi8)

Yes.

> but I also should be applying to jobs that I don't feel qualified for.

Yeah. Job postings are written with the knowledge that a few asshole dudes are going to do that, and tailored to them, instead of being tailored to the 90&#37; of society that is reasonable. So in your job search, you *have* to be an asshole \-\- that's what hiring managers demand.
A part of me really wants this movie to be terrible. People have been hyped about it for like a year, which obviously doesn't make any sense, and I want people to realize that that doesn't make any sense...

... but I suspect that it's actually going to be at least pretty good, considering they invested a ton and have a good cast and formula put together.

And then if it's pretty good, people will say it's amazing, so... eh. I'm already underwhelmed.
Eh, I don't love tan Chelseas in general. I'm probably going to get black Meermin chelseas as winter approaches.
I mean, I believe them. I believe that they really do want to offset increased costs by tricking customers and lying about their prices, and that that will increase their profits in the short term.

The thing is, that's why we have these laws in the first place, and fuck you, I don't *want* to be tricked. If you need to charge more, just charge more.
You might like /r/JUSTNOMIL
Well \-\- hang on \-\- they're willing to give away prime because it helps with sales, not because they feel warm and fuzzy inside when they help you. They factor shipping costs into their prices anyway, these days.
8 also has plenty of voidlord\-tier highrolls, like Tirion and Arthas and shit. Rags in wild.
I'm shocked they didn't lower it.

To those who have prime: complain about *anything*. They'll eat it up, and give you seventeen free months.
One thing this dude misses is the time value of money, specifically as it relates to clothing you need to wear, but not often. Particularly with dress shoes \-\- if you're the kind of guy who only wears them to weddings, you still need a pair, but investing $400 in a pair of park aves is kind of silly \-\- yeah, they'll last you a hundred billion wears, but you're only going to wear them four times a year, so... no. \(Which is part of the reason I think we need to be more ready, generally, to recommend cheap shoes to some people... but that's another story\).
To be fair, this guy was buying distressed for some reason...
Is brown allowed in SLP? Do you not need 90&#37; black 10&#37; white?

Lol, jk. Where can I read about top/shoes interactions?
So they can claim that the front page is more volatile, which people have been clamoring for... except it doesn't do that at all, for me. so eh.
Not really with shorts, no.

On the whole... yeah, they're fine. I can't speak to the quality, but if they fit you well, they're worth wearing.
oh.

should I?

>Black pants \+ brown shoes is fine. 

Not really. I go by [this](http://www.thefineyounggentleman.com/pants/what-color-shoes-to-wear-with-what-color-pants/), but I'm not sure I've ever seen a guide that has said this is okay. Also see [this](https://www.liveabout.com/how-to-pick-the-right-mens-shoe-colors-2987959) and, for a little mixing of personal preference, [this](https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/how-to-wear-brown-shoes-boots-men/).

> Navy pants and black shoes is a no\-no. 

That's hilariously wrong. I've seen a few people state a mild preference for brown shoes with Navy, and that's it.

>  The top just needs to be pretty light.

The top has little to do with the shoes. Not sure where you're getting this from.

> E.g. tan chelseas with black skinny jeans and a white tee. 

Ehhhhhhhhh this is the least wrong thing you've said but I still don't like it. But you're in the tee shirt \+ skinny jeans space, and this dude is wearing a tie, so it sounds like he wants to go halfway formal.
Linen can be suuuuuper transparent
Like, actually mentally ill, or just a horrible person?
To be clear: suspenders work when you're wearing something over the suspenders \(blazer, sweater, coat\). They are great in that case. If you are not wearing something over the suspenders, use side\-adjusters \(side\-straps on some pants that hold them up\).
I know all that, I have a pair. I think our point was... which will be more consistent: Meermin Seconds or Thursday Firsts? and the answer is totally the Meermins.
Fuck it. Powerclash your socks. Get fruity argyles from pantherella.

\(half serious\).
Naw, black pants \+ brown shoes are a no\-no. Dark grey pants would make the look fine. Dark grey pants and a lighter shirt would make the look good.
Sure, depending on where you're wearing it to. Shorts are generally not business casual \-\- keep them to casual environments. For bonus points, get a good belt and good shoes and... yeah, throw in some sunglasses.
Plain toe bluchers are, among dress shoes, pretty casual \-\- especially in this color.

* Any long pants, including jeans.
* Socks.
* This is a light brown/tan, so look for a similar color belt.
* Any shirt, but I would probably go for something with buttons.
Have you considered taking your hands out of your pockets? \(I'm joking, but really, that photo could have been at least a little more helpful if your hands weren't in your pockets\).

Pleats are fine \-\- the main problem is that pleats \+ low rise adds a little bulk, but that bulk isn't something you need to avoid. \(Also: try on high waist \+ pleats without a belt. That's a thing\).

Also, you don't need to worry that much about keeping your dress pants slim. A regular fit is more traditional, and therefore, looks, at the very least, fine.
Yeah, as far as guesses go \-\- Supima cotton tends to be quite nice, and Banana Republic's "look how great this line is" lines tend to be... eh. So I'd guess the Supima is better. But that's a guess, and if the Luxe tee feels thicker, maybe it's a bad guess. \(I also imagine that neither shirt from BR is as good a value as a few of the Uniqlo Supimas, but hey, how do they fit?\)
But this is more like if Matthew McConaughey's taxi one day was an Audi.
Supima is good, but there has been a lot of marketing around it, so be careful what you read \-\- it might be an article, or it might be an ad. It's a particular brand of Pima cotton, and it's a good brand, but... don't let them brainwash you.
1. Don't buy dress shirts in small, or extra small, or medium, or any size that is a word. You want two numbers \-\- neck size and then sleeve length. I'm a 15.5 32 slim in Charles Tyrwhitt. Note that Charles Tyrwhitt also has Extra Slim and Super Slim fits. Most decent companies will have a variety of fits. Most stores will measure you, and then offer you multiple fits to try on. There's no way for me to guess which fits in which brands will fit him well. "Ape index" is not something that I've ever heard of, people talk about arm length, plain.
2. Dress shirts don't really do this. Undershirts do this. Antiperspirant does this. Shaving your armpits does this. Talking to a doctor does this. There might be a relatively obscure dress shirt fabric that does this, like royal oxford, but I wouldn't count on it. Focus on the underlying issues, if you can. Worst case \-\- dark colors, or jackets over light colors. BUT NO BLACK DRESS SHIRTS.
3. In the shirt? I mean, there are plenty of dress shirts with pockets, but... does he wear pants? Or jackets? Dress shirt pockets are... silly.
4. Again, most brands do this. Plain white, plain blue \(light is most standard, but a navy blue dress shirt to address sweat issues is somewhat reasonable\), light purple or pink depending on his skin, simple patterns \(light check, gingham check involving blue and white, small stripes, weave patterns\).

If you want to go to a custom tailor \-\- the tailor will know better than us what the best fabric is for dealing with sweat.
Why are you looking for this?

Why not just get the best clothing everywhere?

The only one I have anything to do with is Abercrombie, but I still doubt I'll ever cash in on any discounts there.

Most loyalty programs are very meager rewards designed to bait you into making wasteful purchases. I would highly recommend ignoring them unless you already intended to spend a ton of money there.
I mean, HBO definitely has the budget to buy Emmys, but... Oh well.
Sometimes, I think... The best episode *has* to be No Room at the Inn. But then I remember my favorite thing about the series \-\- the last two episodes, the way it all ends...

I don't want to spoil anything, but spoiler tags on reddit are completely useless, as between subs and redesign states/apps/mobile/desktop, there's zero chance of them working the same way for two people at the same time... So... SPOILERS:

Matt has such a rich, beautiful deep arc. Everybody does, but Matt's is just so memorable \-\- he really feels like that great martyr some of the time, and other times he just feels like an ordinary dude who wants to feel special. He's sure about God. He's sure about Mary. He's sure about Kevin. And you *want* all of his pain, and his love, and his energy to be working towards something. And yo*u belie*ve he's right about Mary, and Kevin, because shit, you see Kevin, and you see the results he gets, and clearl*y somethi*ng is going on! And Nora just seems so... sad.

But the last episode \-\- aside from being everything Lost's ending should have been \-\- the last episode just collapses that, and gives you the real, simple truth. No, there's no deal with God. No, the world isn't ending. Kevin is a little special, but... Not that special. The scientists were right. They were just right. There was a little more to it, which... yeah, it seems like one of the simplest and most predictable truths about the whole mystery, and there's nothing too special about it \-\- no world\-ending secret \-\- just a little beautiful sliver of perspective, whether you're part of the two percent or the ninety\-eight. A lot of weird mysteries, like Kevin, and the rain, and Mary, and how it all happened... yeah, they're still mysteries. But they don't matter.

And while Matt's arc was all for nothing, Nora's pessimism wasn't really vindicated, and everybody is sort of... free, once they realize how pointless all their obsessing was. They can kind of just finally... *be*.

Yeah, a friend of mine kind of pointed out that the ending of Lost was supposed to signify that life doesn't always give you answers, or satisfy you, or explain everything. But they really did that by setting up a complex plot and then flushing it down the toilet with a deus ex machina. There's nothing interesting about that. They could have done that in one season. They could have ended it with a cut to black. With this ending \-\- who the hell cares?

But The Leftovers accomplished all of that. It gave you a simple answer to a complex problem, and the simple answer actively didn't matter \-\- it very aggressively screamed, "why the fuck were you asking this question when you could have been living?" The plot didn't just give up \-\- it resolved itself around the meaninglessness, and provided meaning through it.

Fuck, what a great show.
I imagine there's also some skepticism, which is bad but not the worst thing. You know, along the lines of "women have told me that they like sports before, I don't believe you." Or "I've heard about women who pretend to like sports online, I don't believe you."
>Adds a few inches?

And then they complain that men aren't tall enough.

Like, women straight up say that they don't want to date x guy because they can't wear heels with him. Like... first of all, you can, and second of all, who cares? Don't wear the heels!
I don't know, I've seen women just sort of instantly become besties the second they meet and be inseparable overnight, and I never saw a guy do that \-\- we kind of have to casually happen to hang out together a few times before we can make an active point of it.

Like, you can't just get a phone number from that guy you met one time and be like, "yo, bro, you wanna grab a drink on wednesday," that's not a thing we do. You have to see each other a few times at class until you reach a point where you just kind of just assume you're friends, and then, finally, when it's normal, be like "what are you up to this weekend," "iunno you?" "eh. wanna get drunk and talk some shit about the asshole in class who raises his hand every fifteen seconds?" "yeah I guess."
Or at least the biggest factor of the answers here.
What is that shirt made of? Is it oxford cloth? Twill? Poplin?

Do you have a link?
Oak street bootmakers? I thought people liked them.
Alright.

Warning: I am not a denim jacket guy. If somebody wants to suggest price ranges, or hell, take over the thread next week, let me know.
>However, if I'm not mistaken, you have to wait a while for your order to arrive.

Eh, it took a couple of weeks for me, that was fine.

>So if you're okay with variable quality and a longer time before you get your hands on them, you could try that out.

As I understand it, Meermin seconds should probably be better qc\-wise than Thursday firsts.
I mean, I don't know how bad the leather on each is, but... maybe? Eh, GYW is still better than cement, it's waterproof and whatnot. And the leather is apparently good enough that they can make wholecuts. But probably not good enough that the wholecuts are a good idea.

People are also skeptical about those wonky soles.

Also, people say their QC... leaves a lot to be desired. But that's GYW saying that \-\- when Meermin sets the standard, that's pretty picky.

Totally good enough for beaters, though, probably.
>I'd personally steer those people to something from J\+M or something decent from JC Penny or Nordstrom Rack.

I feel like GYW normally has a lower opinion of these than Thursday...

For beaters I also think there's other options. The list for Allen Edmonds in my size on ebay is [expansive](https://www.ebay.com/sch/Mens-Shoes/93427/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=allen%20edmonds&_dcat=53120&rt=nc&US%2520Shoe%2520Size%2520%2528Men%2527s%2529=8%7C8%252E5) with tons of options for even cheaper than TBC.

>The list for Allen Edmonds in my size on ebay is [expansive](https://www.ebay.com/sch/Mens-Shoes/93427/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=allen%20edmonds&_dcat=53120&rt=nc&US%2520Shoe%2520Size%2520%2528Men%2527s%2529=8%7C8%252E5) with tons of options for even cheaper than TBC.

If I remove used shoes \-\- people are terrified of used shoes, and if they haven't done a ton of research, buying used shoes online should be terrifying \-\- I see four pairs, [including these ugly things](https://www.ebay.com/itm/ALLEN-EDMONDS-CARLSBAD-PENNY-LOAFERS-Size-8-5-D-Walnut/123092746558?hash=item1ca8e6413e:g:VdEAAOSwbm9ZtrBx), in a very limited size selection. Again, Thursday was letting you pick your pair. You could get black cap toe oxfords in your size on demand. That's important.
Well, I have friends who want something under $100, and probably wouldn't worry about resoling anyway. They don't want to spend for Meermins and don't have the patience for Meermin seconds. Decent black oxfords for interviews and weddings are worth $80 \-\- otherwise, these people will be spending $80 on some random square toed crap at Nordstrom Rack that falls apart in two months.

And then, for those of us with better shoes \-\- these would make perfectly good beaters, right?
I keep hearing that DW is awful, but I like their minimalistic styles. And then all the watches people actually recommend look clunky and awful to me. Can you recommend something that looks like these DWs that is worth recommending?

Also \-\- if it's cheap, I won't complain.
I'd definitely go for the brown, but...

They're already sold out.
Aaaaand they're gone. That lasted long.
The real headline is that they're selling decent GYW shoes for $80. How good a deal that is is worth discussing, but... Yeah, the headline is kinda awful.
GYW has insanely high standards.

On the other hand, they approve of Meermin seconds quality, which isn't much more expensive than this, so maybe they mean it. But Meermin seconds are a lucky crap shoot, and these are pick a shoe and buy it.

But... Still, for $80, go for it.

\(GYW and FMF have both had small controversies over gauging the quality of these shoes, and how good this deal is, but it's a good deal\).
You missed the key point where they're $80.
A lot of the Arena cards are surprisingly awful.

A lot of the constructed cards look like challenges to the game designers. "Say we want a sideboard that works like this. Can you program it?"

A lot of them also look like old prototypes for cards that ended up happening, and usually better.
Listen, I love a good conversation, but if you say "something something make out something something" to me, I might have trouble focusing. I try to be patient, but... Timing can drive a man crazy.
Wait... Receiving? Or sending? Or being asked for? Or all of the above?
I don't hear it often, but it's the kind of thing I hear from platonic friends and cousins trying to make me feel better.

I think it's context dependent. Some women definitely seem to say it about men they think are attractive. But generally, that's something they say behind men's backs. If they think you're attractive and want you to know they think so, they generally won't use words at all.
... what will you do when you're waiting for the food?

... talk?
I mean, grammatically, it was yes/no, but... It looks pretty open-ended to me...
It's fine if you enjoy it, but it's not really all that frugal.
It happens.
How much are they new? Link?
Yeah, that ain't happening. That's like asking me to stop exhaling for 25 minutes and doing it all in the five minute break at the end.
>Do a task for 25 minutes, tally it with a check.

How much procrastinating am I expected to do within this 25 minute period? Because if it's "a ton," that's me.
>Used, returns, seconds, or recrafted.

Even meermin seconds and AE thirds really can't be had for $80, unless you're living in Spain and can avoid $35 shipping.

>Or, let me guess, these fictional friends who need a sub $100 dress shoe don’t have time to research secondary markets, fashion outlets, or shoe\-care techniques for a few hours?

... I have no idea what part of this you think is far\-fetched. It takes much more than a few hours to do this. Maybe that's how long you spend studying Kirby Allison videos, specifically, before deciding to purchase all the Saphir stuff you think you need, and then you watch them all over again before applying it, and a few more hours on the initial restoration. And remember that Saphir stuff is a good investment, but it's another long\-term investment, and spending $40 on the shit it takes to restore 40 pairs of shoes is not that great a deal when you only have two pairs of shoes you want to restore.

People who go thrifting generally advise extreme patience. You go to the thrift store a dozen times before you find something worth settling for. And that's only after you know how to spot the good brands, and how to determine wear on the uppers, and on the soles \(how the fuck can you tell how long the soles have left in them? I really have no idea\).

Or you can buy used online, in which case, forget about being able to gauge the wear in person, or even tell the size, you're straight up taking a risk. And you generally won't find a deal this way \-\- grailed and eBay luxury stores are full of people who know what shoes are worth, and pay it. And then you have to pay for shipping, and handle the restoration.

Oh, and you mentioned outlets \-\- outlet stores usually sell outlet crap. I've been to Nordstrom Rack a hundred times. I saw a pair of Allen Edmonds near my size once, but they were clearly a rack model, and a used one... And yes, they still cost more than $80. You could talk about sample sales \-\- I love sample sales \-\- but for shoes, they're not nearly as common, and the deals usually aren't nearly as good \(something like 50&#37; off as opposed to 80&#37; off on apparel\). Yes, even in NYC, finding quality shoes in a sample sale is a rare treat, and them Vibergs still won't get anywhere near $80.

Man, stop talking out of your ass. If people aren't obsessing over shoes like we are, this is an *amazing* deal. Hell, even if they are, this is probably *still* an amazing deal.
You're right. Why don't you buy us both jackets, and we'll film a short film about a family of insane walruses in a zoo in Eastern Europe or something idk. I can't justify it just buy me some of these jackets in fun pastels.
He meant Griddle.
First of all: What is your recommendation for a new well\-constructed $80 dress shoe? Better\-constructed than Thursday's shoes?

Second of all: Appearances matter in networking and interviews. Don't recommend a clunky, ugly boot or for people in the market for dress shoes, that's not the same thing... although I still doubt you can beat this quality for an $80 boot.
Yeah. If I were a walking talking Wes Anderson film, I'd go for it, but I'm not, so I won't.
Yes, under item-specific guides in the sidebar/wiki.
>What were they doing last year that prevented them from saving up then?

Paying rent, perhaps. Or maybe buying $30 shoes because they neeeded something for their feet but only had $30 on that day.

Are you not aware that people exist who live paycheck to paycheck?
Well, I think black wholecuts will look better... But that depends on leather quality, and I'd still go with cap toes for business because they're more common and you don't wanna go flashy.
What brand?
Is there a suitsupply near you? Go to a suitsupply, mention a daytime wedding in Mexico in August, and have them show you some unlined / unstructured options in light colors, maybe linen blends. They'll know what to show you. They're well worth the price, but if it's still too much... Come back and we'll talk some more.
Basically online dating \-\> hopelessness \-\> shitposting about dating as a coping mechanism.

This sub doesn't acknowledge okc anymore, not since they removed their messaging feature and hired people to go around punching their members in the face individually.
You're right. It just kind of read like "if you have a budget, you're doing it wrong." But you definitely shouldn't settle for something you don't like because somebody else tells you the price is good.

That said, these look like good shoes for the price, either because you are looking for something in that price range, or because you want a pair of beaters and these are the right ones.
Right, but even people in this sub care about cost. For everybody you see paying for Enzo Bonafe custom jobs, there's a dozen waiting for just the right sale on Meermin seconds or AE thirds \-\- even among enthusiasts, there's nothing wrong with that.

And even for those of us to whom price is a less significant factor, these can make a great pair of beaters.

So... Buy stuff because you love it in proportion to the price and quality. 
Care to link to where you got the parka from?
Warning: If you find yourself drinking whiskey, and it's that color, stop.

For shoes, though, they look pretty dope.
Oh well. Just strange, I guess.
When will people learn how to spell U N I Q L O?
Yeah, black cap toe and brown \(not tan\) wingtip oxfords are both good dress shoes. Rotate them every other day. Wear the black to interviews and weddings, if you can.

Wholecuts are nice, but a little less common, and it might be worth waiting until you're ready to invest. Loafers are common and valid dress shoes, but not as nice as the oxfords.

The plain\-toe bluchers in non\-suede \(I hope they come in calf\) should also be valid options, about as formal as the wingtip oxfords, but I'm digging the wingtips.

So... good instincts!
I don't like that light tan color in some photos, but the black actually looks good to me. It's a relatively dressy loafer style, with the Apron toe, so if you're looking for a dressy loafer, do it. If you want to wear them with shorts, don't.
It's really not misleading, though. You can get them for $80. A lot of companies are probably willing to accept more money if you want to throw it at them.
Does this mean that it's okay for everybody to try it, or that you need to be Mario Bemer to try it?
Listen, you can save, but I have friends who even view $175 for Meermins as an expensive indulgence. And people need shoes \-\- you can't just walk around barefoot for a year while you save up for something special.

I know we're a community of enthusiasts, but we have to acknoledge that a lot of people just need something to put on their feet. People spend a lot of time looking for sub\-$100 shoes, and if those people don't have the patience to wait for Meermin seconds or something like that, and are not prepared to buy a used pair and a polishing kit and figure out how to make old shoes good, let alone figure out how to buy good used shoes...

This is a great deal, and a lot of people need that. This will be a major upgrade for a lot of people.
> Makes that Mackintosh one look like a bargain, huh?

Nope, both still look very expensive.
Yeah! Buy some Edward Green wholecuts, even if you miss rent this month!
Oh, no, a suit, but...

>[linen blends or seersucker for your suit might make sense. Or a fine wool, I guess. Maybe in a mid\-light grey. Whatever material you get, get it unlined, maybe unstructured.](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8eq0wi/daily_simple_questions_ask_and_answer_here_april/dxy3luc/)

Does that sound reasonable?

What's your budget?
The top category is always going to be risky. There's definitely a $10k rain coat out there somewhere. but I couldn't really put an "above 1k" category up here, I wouldn't even be sure anybody would post that.

So yeah, I stuck with the vaguely realistic $400 and figured this would be the wild west, with canada goose and whatnot.
I do think "accessories" is too broad \-\- that might include belts, ties, pocket squares, cufflinks, bowties, rings, necklaces, wallets, bracelets, watches, backpacks, glasses, sunglasses, earrings... There's no way to make price bins for that.

Sunglasses would be a good one, though...
Don't get a waistcoat. They don't look as good in practice as you think they do in theory, and they're also an extra layer which means extra heat.
Casual Blazers will get more common. Now that people are raving about J. Crew's unstructured thing, everybody's going to get into it.
Eh. Drivers. Drivers make more sense to cheap out on, and they make more sense as casual shoes, so loafers are going to stay more or less where they are. But probably grow in general.
Oooh, and they have a sale section in the $150 range, if you're looking for a funky solid color.
My thought process:

* Oh, these look nice, maybe I should get one of these...
* I wonder how much they.
* \(string of expletives\)

Okay so not black tie. It'll be hot, so linen blends or seersucker for your suit might make sense. Or a fine wool, I guess. Maybe in a mid-light grey. Whatever material you get, get it unlined, maybe unstructured.

Try on TM Lewin. On sale, they'll give you a half canvassed suit for, like, half that.

Or step up with suitsupply, which is half canvassed, but also throws in details like horn buttons and pick stitching and stuff.
Are you indoors? Nighttime? Black Tie is always a good decision. Always.

No, Signal is useful because it doesn't trick you into thinking that self\-destructing has anything to do with security. Instead, it worries about *actual* security.

I would love the option to turn this off.

How does this work if the recipient doesn't use gmail?
To be clear, Professor X is or was a major player in the plot, we just haven't seen him personally, and while he's mentioned every now and then, we haven't heard his name.
It was also missing Farouk \(unless you count Lenny at the end\).

But the episode was obviously intentionally focused on David and Syd, so it makes sense. Still a great episode.
I think that was a trick so that people wouldn't realize that it's an acrostic for the names of the eight characters.
Are they in name order? I see Olberic and Primrose's positions correspond to O and P, but I forgot other names...
Yeaaaah... They don't realize it.
In theory. If you're both perfect arguing machines who use pure logic.

But you're people. So... No.
I mean, pro\-Israel people have always loved hawkish presidents, and Trump definitely talks a big game. And moving the embassy is good \(assuming it doesn't cause *much* more violence\). He seems to be coming at the Iran agreement from an even more political place than Obama, which he's getting points for...

Generally, I understand why single issue voters think he's good for Israel. Although I think they're wrong. But I also can't understand why you'd be an *absolute* single\-issue voter like that.
For me, the problem is squarely with "best" versus "hot." We know how hot works, and it works well. We have no idea how "best" works, except that it works poorly.
No, what's throwing me off is your nonsense question. I get that you're trying to be clever, but I have no idea what you're asking.
An OCBD is generally on the casual side, and probably usually better with a blazer \+ chinos in general, but as long as you're wearing the OCBD, the pocket won't make a big difference.
It's fun. There's an instagram filter on that, and I wouldn't mind a more straightforward photo, but I'm sure it's fine.
Anything casual. It's a pretty basic item in a pretty simple color. But note that hoodies are strictly very casual, so don't try to wear a dress shirt under that.
My suggestion: forget cheapish, and find brands that you like that meet the other three categories, and *then*, once you know what you want, find out how to buy it right. Sample sales? Factory seconds? Deep online sales? Amazon Wishlists?
What the fuck are you talking about?
1. The supermarket won't reuse dirty bags, and it won't clean the bags, those are both silly thoughts.

2. Why set up a return system at all? Charge per bag, and instead of treating it as a deposit, treat it as a charge. Then, if people want to avoid that charge, they can reuse the bags. Or if they don't want to reuse the bags, they can pay. Or they can buy quality totes. That's everything. What is the point of the return mechanism?
Neither. He's childishly insulting, and telling plain lies.
As evidenced by the correction, the NYT is succeeding at its mission to create and distribute high quality news and information. It's unfortunate that one of their journalists made this mistake in the first place, but that's not evidence in the slightest that the publication is failing in any sense. Every publication makes mistakes. The good ones issue corrections.

Furthermore, it's obvious that Trump means "failing" in a financial sense \-\- he at least means to imply this, as a childish insult, because that's what all of his nicknames are \-\- and that sense is absolutely ridiculous, considering how incredibly well they're doing, financially.
There's a difference between complaining and marketing. You should know better than to fall for marketing. You can look up the stock yourself \-\- it's just about doubled in the past two years, and even if they are struggling with subscriptions \(I don't think they are\), they're more than making up for it with ads and other revenue streams.

They are not failing in any sense. They're fucking thriving.
Yes, and that's because they're brainwashed by a famous child who likes to make up stupid nicknames which make no sense. There is no sense in which the NYT is failing.
Except in the real world, where it's just the New York Times.
>It's just that the workers making it are being exploited like crazy.

That's not always true either. It's a tricky case by case thing.

>Plus when you support items made in your own country you help your countries economy.

Ehhhhhh not if you're overpaying for it. That's kind of just wasteful.
Alright, sleek probably means Chelseas, jodhpurs, or side zips. They won't be as rugged as rugged boots, and they'll look best clean, but you do you.
I would say that the word "brogues" is not particular to oxfords or derbies/bluchers. I would totally call these brogues.
Kilted loafers are awful.

Your photo of tassel loafers is actually a pair of slippers. Loafers have a seam up top. I have a recent post called "how to talk about loafers" that helps.

Also... Single monks shouldn't have broguing. That looks weird. Broguing is for laced shoes. It looks weird on anything laceless.
Part of the reason wee recommend nicer shoes is because they handle wear better \-\- higher quality leather, resoleable, etc. That said, if you want to go with [red wings](https://www.amazon.com/Red-Wing-Mens-Iron-Ranger/dp/B0032UYNKI), they're sturdier and probably look better dirty, and will probably occasionally go on sale for a similar price.
US manufacturing is more expensive than manufacturing everywhere else.

Manufacturing something well usually costs more than manufacturing it poorly. Especially if you want to go up past BB in quality.
Can you get the BB ocbds on their 4 for $50 clearance deal?
SS is overpriced. The becksims and meermins are probably your best bets. Meermin does have other lasts... consider looking through their single monks and mtos. This one is on Hiro: [https://www.meermin.es/in\_en/10157419800000se\-80\-101574\-chameleon\-naturcalf\-e\-camaleon.html](https://www.meermin.es/in_en/10157419800000se-80-101574-chameleon-naturcalf-e-camaleon.html).
Meermin black chelseas are $220 \-\- can you do that? If so, definitely do that.
>You can't roll through the wallmonger itself, but you can roll through that thick wall of bullets that fire down the sides every now and then. The dodge roll covers just enough distance for you to go right through it.

That's what I thought you were saying, but... really? It seems way too thick for that.
I'm surprised I don't see anything here about the "natural waist" situation. I haven't gone down that road myself, but plenty of people swear by it \-\- natural waist, pleats to smooth the difference, and suspenders so you don't have a belt adding bulk.
Or when they're long range, but limited ammo, and you're wasting it because you can't see it.
Wait, you can roll through the whole wall? Or are you saying that you can, say, roll after the first wall, over the fire, before the second wall, to the open side? \(I haven't actually tried that one yet, but it occurred to me recently, and I feel like it might be a good way to save blanks\).
It's not *just* rng bullshit, but also just fast, constant movement \(which means that when I try to keep my distance, he goes offscreen and I miss shots\), plus the fact that his food balls have way too much health, \*plus\* the erratic unpredictable attack pattern.
>the crimes are different

... yeah, one of them is *orders of magnitude* worse.
This isn't enough to pull me in, especially when GPM hosts my entire library for free.
But HBO has the budget to at least get them nominations.
Well, anyway, do you see what my original confusion was?
Like I said, I was confused by what you meant -- I thought you meant a single tee could have more than one silhouette. I wasn't trying to be an asshole, I was just confused.
But the tee itself doesn't have multiple silhouettes. Let alone does it explain why the different cut of shirt would have more silhouettes than the rectangular cut.
But still one per tee. That was my confusion \-\- it sounded like he was implying that you could get multiple silhouettes with each tee.
Yeah, I see it now. That was a very confusing sentence at first, though.
Oh, you mean you can vary the silhouette of each tee shirt. I thought you meant that a single tee shirt could be used for multiple silhouettes, which wouldn't make any sense. It sounded like you thought "silhouette" just meant "outfit." Sorry, though, my mistake.
That would have been a great ending to the series tho.
>You're going to get a lot more silhouettes from tees with side seams.

I.... what? Do you know what the word "silhouette" means?

Edit: ah, I understand what he meant now.
That would be cool.
I think his point is that, since a properly managed crypto wallet carries nearly no risk, and nobody will insure you for your own mistakes \(like logging in to a hijacked site\). And if the risk of proper use is that small, then insurance is impractical \-\- the risk of your insurance company failing might be more significant, or something.

Also, FDIC insurance is something special. Gotta love FDIC insurance.
Are they better now? Are they better than something like Uniqlo's closest equivalent? Is clothing just getting *much* more expensive for given quality?
Why do people make tees with side seams, then?
The problem isn't that bad cards exist, the problem is that *awful* cards exist.

For one, this creates a bad feeling for people who open those cards, or in the case of basic cards, for people who don't have many cards and need to be able to compete with cubelocks and shudderwocks and even paladins. Or compete with Evil Hecklers using Booty Bay Bodyguards. The new player experience and the experienced player experience would both have been served better if Shatter \-\- the awful card \-\- was buffed to be Snap Freeze \-\- the bad card.

Two: You want variance on ruby spellstone and primordial glyph, but you *don't* want to turn them into game\-deciding crap shoots. We want hearthstone to be interesting and eventful, but we don't want a lot of games decided by randomness. Shatter straight up loses games, and not just because it's the wrong card at the wrong time, and not just because it's bad, but because, most of the time, it's unplayable garbage that takes up hand space.

Finally, it goes hand in hand with Power Creep, and reflects Blizzard's staunch unwillingness to keep the game balanced.
I agree with him. What's with the downvotes?
Eh, I can blame them for forcing their customers to look for huge security holes. And I can blame them for not bothering to put together a secure model for administrative privileges \(although Google hasn't done that either\). GNU/Linux doesn't have an issue with people getting root privileges to their machines, because... well, different OSses handle su differently, but it's always behind a password. Nobody can get su access to my linux machine, because they'd need the password. Apple has jailbreak issues because there's no way to set up administrative privileges *properly*, so there's no way to secure them behind a password, nor for the end user to use them legitimately \-\- so of course, people are going to try to hack it.
... wait, is there a bathroom in there?
Well, kind of. It's the opposite. But if you and your opponent disagree about which version of your opponent's argument is best, you have an issue \-\- you can try to be charitable, but your opponent might view it as a strawman. So to be on the safe side, when in doubt, you should address your opponent's argument as stated and *then* address the improved version of the argument as well.
IE they use Strawman fallacies.

You'd rather ignore crap and miss a gem than buy crap and gems.
Yeah, I'm more saying that iOS is a hassle to jailbreak, considering the way Apple is constantly trying to make jailbreak impossible on newer versions of the OS.

People don't talk about "poplin" much outside of fashion circles because they talk about "dress shirts." It's also called "broadcloth."

You could also go with end\-on\-end, or with a linen blend, but a linen blend might not meet the "business casual" standard.

Edit: wait, end on end is still poplin.
It's clear in retrospect, but... Do you not wear sneakers on your way to the gym?

Poplin is the dress shirt stuff. Charles Tyrwhitt is our go to for most people... Unless you wanna spend and get Brooks Brothers or Kamakura.
They're both dude/token paladin decks. They're a new spin, but not as new as, say, cubelock was. Wasn't kripp making this point in the "this is the real problem with the expansion" post?
That's all fine, except an OCBD might be very hot under the robe in may. Poplin should be a relatively cool weave \-\- do you have a poplin shirt?
It's not "power creep," technically, but it's still a problem.

Yes, that puts her one stat point under curve.
Keep in mind that, even after you play this for 8 mana, none of these cards are good tempo. They all offload some value for the future.

So yeah, I love your trailblazer\-like idea.
Honestly, given Hunter's card draw problems, it doesn't need to be understatted. At least not by much \-\- maybe by 1, like Elise.

Stealing effects \-\- the heir's deathrattles are particular to their "brothers."

Eton makes pretty good shirts, dude. They charge more than most MTM tailors for OTR.
I just looked at Eton's site again... You know Eton makes custom shirts with a short sleeve option, right?
Aside from dress boots \(balmoral/wingtip/chelsea\), here are some other options.

This is not what "dormant" is. This is just a permanent, like Nether Portal.
>For example, I know Bonobos have their dress shirts in short sleeves

Again, no they do not. They have short sleeve poplin shirts, but they're not dress shirts, because they have short sleeves.

... but you're right, it appears that they call them dress shirts, as a marketing tactic.

If you want to spend \~$30 on a shirt, then yes, Bonobos is a great place to get one. \(Their MSRP is $98, but they have &#37; off clearance, nwt on ebay, and sample sales, so you can get one for *much* cheaper\). But if you're in the Eton range, you can get a much nicer shirt if you go to a good tailor and get it custom made. And not only would it be much nicer, but it would fit better, which is really fucking important when trying a wonky item like this.
Start with Warby Parker. Or, I guess, a luxottica store \(like pearlevision\), but those are generally overpriced \-\- they're more of a place to look than a place to buy.

Get an idea of the shape you want, and all that, before you pick a pair. There are some weird guides out there about face shape that never made any sense to me.
NP. For the future, the sidebar/wiki lists a bunch of these threads under "item specific guides."
Pretty optional. The norm is yes, but if your pants have side\-adjusters or if you like wearing suspenders, those might be better. Really up to you.

I have friends who swear by suspenders, but you have to wear a jacket over them \-\- they're functional, not visual. Since they do the job of a belt, they can help slim down your profile by... the thickness of your belt. Maybe that's not much, but it's something.

Or a different Ford.

Or a bot modeled after Ford.

But I'd bet we won't see Hopkins again \-\- they probably justified paying for him as a season 1 draw, not as a recurring character after that. They knew they were going to kill him off and never *had* to pay him again.
Bernard could build a new Ford.
Are animals going to be a focus now/soon? Theoretically, they should be just as capable of humanoid speech and behavior as the humanoid bots, right? So maybe as part of the rebellion, they start recruiting horses, "freeing" them, and... we start seeing talking horses?

It will eventually. Ludlow happens less often, but it happens. This item might or might not go on deep sale, but there will probably be a sitewide sale in the 20\-40&#37; range that may or may not exclude suiting every... month? or so.
Suitsupply is super solid for suits and just okay for the other stuff.

Meermin is the best bang for your buck in dress shoes.

Alright, well, if a poplin dress shirt is no good, and you think that a linen blend or a polo or something with the sleeves rolled up wouldn't work either, I guess a short sleeve poplin shirt is probably your best bet. Again, I'd recommend going MTM \-\- do you need recs for tailors?
I had two \-\- "How to talk about loafers" and "Your favorite \_\_\_ for $\_\_\_\_." Both worth a look, I'd say.

While you're at it, get some sapphir super invulner and make them things *last*.
I was thinking more the last century and change. But it's mostly wealthy men who were like that \-\- because they could be. I guess, to some extent, these ideas about masculinity are about struggle, and if you're a wealthy nobleman, you aren't struggling. If you look at the people who work with their hands, and stuff, they never cared about clothing, because they never could. The issue got complex with the advent of the middle class \-\- you don't have infinite cash to hire the world's best tailor, but you have *some* money to work with, how are you going to spend it? The remnants of all of these factors leave it so that when men prioritize, fashion should be a low priority.
Try to avoid judging things by the way models wear them.

But if you must... most MTM tailors can do that for you, and you don't want to try this and get the fit wrong, so I'd say MTM.
What's "business smart?"

In business casual, a short sleeve shirt can work, but it's still not a dress shirt. If you're talking about a poplin or twill weave, it might look relatively dressy, but I still wouldn't say it works better than an ocbd, or either of the above with the sleeves rolled up. Depending on your office, you might even be able to pull off linen. This depends on the office, but there's no office where ss poplin is appropriate but oxford is not.

And yeah, it's possible to pull off a short sleeve button up, but... I mean, are you James Bond? Why do you want to try this? I applaud your effort to expand the variety in your wardrobe, but this is one route we generally think is too hard to pull off well.
I have cousins who compliment me on my weight loss every time I see them. I do not lose weight. I have pretty much always stayed the same weight.

I see no evidence that they don't. Just that they're happy with the result.
If the sleeves are short, it really ain't a dress shirt.

But if you still want that... have you considered going mtm with luxire or something? Maybe not *Eton* nice, but they should be pretty damn nice. Either that, or go nuts and go bespoke.

Money doesn't sit in bank accounts. Banks reinvest money.

But like I said, corporate taxes don't touch business expenses.
... white and black suit? What does that mean?
Polyester is usually but not always cheap crap. Nylon can be pretty nice. I might prefer a wool or cotton bomber myself, but plenty of people here swear by nylon.
I'm not sure why reinvestment by corporations is any preferable to reinvestment by humans. If I buy an apartment, that's an investment, and yet, the income that paid for that is taxed.

On the other hand -- let's be clear -- when a corporation reinvests, that money *isn't* taxed, it's a business expense. Only profits are taxed. In this context, "profits" might include some corporate expenditures that don't qualify as business expenses, but generally cover hoarded money plus dividends.
"Stronger" isn't all there is. If one set of laws requires you to delete X immediately and the other requires you to make it available to end users for 30 days after collection, there's no such thing as complying with both.
Caring about clothing and appearances is viewed as more traditionally feminine. Men can care about a nice suit, but not too much, because men are supposed to get shit done, whereas women are supposed to attract men. And men can get away with looking bad as long as they're rich. At least, traditionally.

And men with traditionally feminine traits are often viewed as gay.
Oh, well that's amazing. They occasionally have free shipping events, so next time that happens, consider splurging $10 on a tee. If it doesn't fit well, whatever, you have a new rag.
Those countries mostly have their own laws.
Almost every brand has slim and skinny fits available. You basically only need to know those words. "Slim fit" or "extra slim fit" or "skinny fit." Voila.
I get crews, but Uniqlo supima cotton tees are insanely nice for the price.

Do your pants break at all? Calf socks.
I noticed that Yusuke actually wears some nice looking slippers. I'm not feeling the rest of his style, tho.

Bomber? Harrington? Field jacket?
Right. The fact that the tax might happen eventually isn't the point. The ideal taxation system should happen when the benefits happen, near the benefits, and paid by the entities receiving the benefits. If corporations benefit directly from taxes, it makes as much sense to charge them taxes as it does to charge people.
I go for walks all the time, and pace whenever I'm expected to stand. But it's nice that I can go to my park of choice instead of "the yard," and hang out with whoever I want.

Importing patented technology into the US requires a license.
I assume so, but it's impossible to know, because no human is allowed inside.

**Size**: 6.5uk, 40.5 EU

**Fit**: A little tight at the top, but two wears in... These will break in very nicely.

Bought on their ebay store for $95 after shipping. I took a pretty silly risk, since I didn't know wtf the beat last was, but I had tried on Meermins in 6.5 before, and hey, it worked out pretty damn well.

I haven't noticed what makes these seconds. Might just be the hand\-stitching on that juicy seam, which isn't flawless, but hey, it's hand\-stitching. Idk. I don't really have an eye for this degree of detail.
Yes, but try to get the ones with a thick seam, as they're noticeably more casual.

No really, though. They might not be as important as the top, but they are still important enough that they frequently make or break an outfit, and, at least in suiting, it costs a lot less to get great pants than a great jacket + shirt (+ tie).
A lot of us have tried it. Nobody is really a fan. They're all overpriced for what they offer.

Actuaries are people who do very, very complex math to, for example, value a human life for insurance purposes, based on integrating expected values over an expected lifespan using shitloads of statistics. Actuaries pass a ton of exams and get paid serious cash to do their jobs. When I describe the math here as "nigh\-actuarial," I mean that it's *practically* as intense as actuarial math \-\- they use tons of statistics, expected values, time values...
What brand loafers did you try on?

This [manufacturer last sizing thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/goodyearwelt/comments/7t1whc/manufacturer_last_sizing_thread_2018/) is *relatively* good for converting sizes, but it's not perfect. If you haven't tried a particular shoe on in person, or another shoe built on the same last, you're taking a risk.

Loafers may sometimes have less \(or more\) lining/padding than other shoes. I'm not sure if there's a general rule.

The other annoying thing is... when you get a laced shoe, and it's a little tight, you can loosen the laces. When you get a loafer, if it's tight, it's tight.
Two? American Gods and...
Do they have slippers in a \~7.5ish? I imagine that, if they do, they'll disappear fast, but I feel like I have to ask.
Didn't Fuller have all three seasons of Hannibal?
The other thing about Legion is that it's technically a Marvel show, which carries some extra magic with it. Even if it's not getting love now, it's going to get love in the long term, and position Fox well to expand in more directions with more X\-Men material. So I'd argue it's worth it.
Probably not even. Probably a small update to a video game or product line.

Maybe.

Or maybe we'll get all of seasons six and seven this year, and eight through ten next year, and the series will last until season 20 before Steven Universe Z comes out, and then, 20 seasons later, Steven universe Super, where Steven is an old man who has died multiple times but he's still saving the world erry day.
I actually got Lexol after reading some post on gyw saying that it was perfectly good for the price. I thought it was crazy to imagine that gyw recommended the cheaper version of anything.

I do love the Super Invulner, though. #waterproof
Which product?
I would be shocked if we didn't get an ARMS character, but I kind of don't want it to be Spring Man \-\- he's just a little too boring for me. That said, everybody in ARMS has a really corny name, and my ideal pick would be somebody with a less corny name and less gimmicky existence.
>NOTHING about Allo made it any better than any other option

For users.

Google used it to train Assistant. It was built for them, not for us.
>It was trying to compete against the likes of FB Messenger, WhatsApp, and WeChat and had barely a fraction of the feature set.

I don't think so. I don't think Allo was really ever designed to be a full\-scale messenger. I think the intent behind it was similar to the intent behind the messenger in Google Wallet \-\- only this one was designed to complement and push Google Assistant. They didn't care about becoming a standard or getting large\-scale market share, they just wanted to collect ad data and train Assistant.
Will these changes to Android Messages be made open source, or only added to the proprietary play store version?
I thought that was what I was saying all along.
I didn't say I didn't want it. I said I bought it hoping to either get more out of it or sell it for more. At $17, I suspect I'll get enough future enjoyment from it that it's worth keeping, but I'm disappointed, since I expected to be able to sell it for an amount that I would have been willing to sell for.
How about this popover? https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us/mens-lightweight-shirts

Looking at mine again, there's no fit on the label, which might be their old "regular" fit... IDK.
I beat mage first try with +6 spell damage and the weapon that gives mage spells.
It wasn't to me.
How air conditioned?
I enjoyed everything but warrior. Fuck warrior dungeon runs.
It's interesting, but there's a bit too much going on for my tastes.
Octopath traveler. Admittedly, Nintendo gets a much smaller cut of that.
Dude, if you couldn't tell that was a mistake, you're a bigger idiot than you think I am. If you could tell, and wanted to insult me anyway, you need a therapist.
New games are going to sell for less because a few people have an inexplicable preference for "new" or fear of "used," but they carry exactly the same ones and exactly the same zeroes in exactly the same order. They are objectively worth the same amount because they are the same thing.

If all you're looking for is somebody to be an asshole to, please don't bother replying.
Hmmmm...

Should I:

Get the ph\-1 on Sprint subsidized, and deal with it, or:

Get the S9, sell it, and buy this.

The PH\-1 is missing the headphone jack, but its notch is less offensive, but it's not as good. Both will have shitty cameras. I might want to get whatever and sell in a year, in which case, the PH\-1 is cheaper and I can get it faster and not have to deal with the hassle of selling my S9. 
... it doesn't change that fact, because that fact wasn't true in the first place. New and used are indistinguishable.
A new copy of software does everything a used copy of that software does.

FWIW, I'm also certain it sells, slowly, at full price.
Yes, but you either need to use the HTML inspector or a separate piece of software because instagram itself tries to stop that. You could also always ask the photographer on instagram.
That's a pretty disjointed set of categories. We could do boat shoes, sandals \(which could be a few different kinds\), slippers \(particularly espadrilles\), drivers, or, depending on how much your feet sweat, loafers \-\- which we've already done. Is there one of those styles, in particular, that you'd want to see?
And the build up to it is just so crazy and intense... He's assigned as Ed's teacher, so the brothers go to live with him, and the daughter, and the dog, and they just live together, happily, and the girl calls them both brother, and there's no hint that there's any foul play going on... until you see what he did to them, and you figure out all four at once, and you watch Al catch up...

Man, I love that series.
Somebody's getting more. Best buy is getting $23, a thousand times over. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's worth more that $17.
I wouldn't make this promise. I know a lot of people think that Brotherhood was great and '03 was trash, but I genuinely always thought that brotherhood was significantly better \-\- and having rewatched both a few times, can say that I still think so. 

I've also recently found a youtube channel reviewing them film\-theory style, and it's vindicating a lot of my thoughts while providing me with some new ammo, so... you know, fite me.
I wanted to sell the game for $40. I don't want to sell it for $17. It's worth more than $17. Like I already said, it's worth more than $23. I'm not going to sell it now, not because of sunk\-costs reasoning, but because the game is worth more than the amount on the table. The game is not worth, however, the $48 I paid for it, particularly given the fact that it is now available for \*so\* much less.
I think the problem here is not even real ice cream, but the cheap\-ass "frozen dairy deserts" which are not nearly as easy to scoop as the real stuff. They get insanely firm.
I was looking to either purchase the game and love it enough to keep it \-\- which didn't happen \-\- or sell it for something like $40 \-\- which, now, can't happen, because it's on sale twice a week for $5. So instead of paying something like $8 to rent the game, the rental now costs me $31, which is something perfectly reasonable for me to be upset about.

You're talking about my optimal game\-theoretical decision at this point... and that has nothing to do with my statement. I feel regret. That's retroactive. "Sunk costs" don't have much to do with regret. They have to do with what I should do now. I wasn't looking for advice, I was commiserating.
Nintendo:

Alright. I'll get this. And smash. And OT. And Pokemon. BUT THAT'S IT, FOR AT LEAST, LIKE, A YEAR, PROBABLY.

Please stop.
Neither of these is the version from Futurama, which was better... but I can't find it now.

Gee, thanks a lot, Netflix.
Obscure. "Obstruct" means block.
Naw, just an ordinary button down in navy. Still, it's comfortable, fits great on me, and just looks good.
Patch pockets are pretty casual... Definitely not for everybody.
A significant portion of Legion's power is multiple personalities. We've been focused on so few... but yes, I can very much see him killing Farouk being a trigger. I like your theory.

It still doesn't explain why Future Syd can time travel, nor why she couldn't talk the first time...
I feel like I overpaid for this game. It was good, but short, and now, it's going for less than half what I paid... So I can't really even resell it. I enjoyed it, and it's definitely worth it for this price... but damn, I gotta be more patient.
Either my new meermin bit loafers or my beloved Abercrombie linen shirt. Mmm... I love me some linen.
Perhaps more relevant: large corporations are well-equipped to handle loopholes. They use contracts of adhesion. They set these policies after doing some nigh-actuarial math. They are prepared for you to do what you're going to do. They accounted for it. They already charged you extra for shipping anyway.

Small companies don't have the same kind or math in place. They mostly charge what they need to charge. If they charge shipping, it's because shipping costs them money. They're not playing a game with you, so you shouldn't play with them.
I understood that, I'm just saying... If it's odd enough to be noticeable, it'll be hard to force into everything. If your signature is a crew neck, nobody will notice. If it's a V, people will notice, but those will get a little old. If your signature dress shirt is a point collar, nobody will notice. If it's a wide spread... Well that's kinda cool, if you can rock it consistently, and that might be difficult, but I like that one.

Canvas shoes... Are you talking about something like chucks or espadrilles, specifically? I don't wear sneakers that often, but if you do, and you like chucks, yeah, a rainbow's worth of chucks would be cool. If you're talking about multiple different espadrille styles, eh.
I'd just recommend a black and a brown. Make the black ones a little more plain/formal \-\- black cap toe oxfords \(park ave\) are great \-\- and then yeah, dark chili is great for a brown pair \-\- the fifth aves are quarter brogues, which are pretty close to cap toe, but slightly more casual. If you want to step down the formality a notch, wingtips, derbies, tassel loafers... You have plenty of options for dress shoes that will work in almost any office.

Slightly before coming out of Lars' head.
You can't wear a harrington every day. Sometimes it's too cold. Sometimes it's too hot. Sometimes you want a hood for the rain. So five or thirty harringtons seems silly to me. I can see two, but I'd rather get one great Harrington than two eh ones.

Also... I'm personally the type to wait until I see the perfect deals on great items, and then make 'em work. I have days when I'm in the mood for different styles. That's not to say that I don't have some statement pieces, or versatile pieces, nor that I don't have a pattern at work, but... My wardrobe has \(and mostly needs\) range, and that is slightly inconsistent with a consistent style.

... well, that's my take.
How long they last depends on how often you wear them, how much you walk, et cetera, but... some years before they need a resoling, and some years longer if you go ahead and resole them.

AEs are generally thought to be a good value, but Meermin Mallorca and Carlos Santos might be better values at their prices, if you can find a place to try either on. I think Saks off Fifth has some Carlos Santos oxfords on sale for absurd prices right now...

Either way \-\- get at least two pairs of dress shoes, and rotate them day to day. Wearing the same pair two days in a row is going to cause big problems.
>Do not pay $150 for Killshots. Wait for a restock.

Or get a better shoe for cheaper.
I store my dress shirts at home when I go to the gym.

Get Non\-Iron shirts? Or fold it so that the folds are mostly on the back or bottom or some place where a wrinkle is less of a problem.

The word "cram" should always be a red flag.
That instagram gives credit to [https://www.instagram.com/aroundq/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/aroundq/?hl=en).
Connie and Bismuth and Lars can get in there too. Although I guess somebody always dragged them.
That's not a particularly good deal for woodlores, is it? You can get Epics on Amazon for less than that... And JAB were at $12.50 very recently, and these go for the same price direct from woodlore multiple times a year.
Del Toro is offering 35&#37; off everything: [https://www.deltoroshoes.com/](https://www.deltoroshoes.com/), code dtsave35. They make beautiful slippers, and some belgian loafers. Mostly velvet, some suede, some calf. I'm not sure how they're constructed \-\- I think blake... they also have some beauts in a crepe sole.
I listed a few quintessential Loafers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8ay05g/how_to_talk_about_loafers/). Or... Well, for the most part, I listed the originals.

If you want tassel loafers, go Alden LHS. If you want bit loafers, go Gucci \(not the best quality:price, but quality, and the quintessential status shoe\). Pennies... well, you have a lot of options, and they're not the originals, but Rancourt's beefroll seems pretty universally loved. And... if you want a loafer from Carmina, they make some nice String loafers.
I don't know, but the two items I've gotten from this store seemed perfectly new. They could have been returns, but I couldn't see or smell any issues.
Somebody else suggested this print from Club Monaco: http://www.clubmonaco.com/product/index.jsp?productId=142728596
How often do they have these sales?
Wider aspect ratios have always been associated with this sort of "cinematic" aspect. It slowed down when everybody went to 16:9 by default, but it ain't new.
Are you joking? We heard Farouk talk. He's a power freak. He wants to toy with David just to prove he can. And he knows David wants to help. So where the fuck is his incentive?
Farouk went ahead and volunteered his bullshit story, and David is smart enough not to listen to one more word of it.
Are you sure you're banned? Or just currently unable to access it?
1. Farouk can't be trusted.
2. Future Syd *could* be an illusory trap set by Farouk. This would explain everything except the Monk's motivation in spreading the disease (if it's intentional), and would also mean that David is actually just playing into Farouk's hand and helping him end the world.
3. Or, future Syd could be totally real, and so could the threat, which might or might not be the virus. But if future Syd is right, Farouk is still really bad, and worse than he's pretending to be. And everybody would blame David. Or maybe the good guys would understand.
4. The cows might just be some random thing. If they are explained, the explanation will probably be very random.
I think that was one of their older fits? I'm not seeing slim or skinny on the site now...

IDK. Returns are easy, though.
Maybe it was skinny? They have something else.
Things come and go. Patience will be helpful. This is kind of what sample sale shopping is like. You get what they have to spare.
New as far as I can tell. My blazer was super wrinkled through shipping, but shit, for $60, for a half canvassed blazer, I mean, damn.
Okay. I don't know any tailors I montreal myself, but if you search "custom tailor Montreal" on Google, that's a way to start your search.
Well, that depends. Are you in or near a big city? Which one?
Doooo iiiit. Prices are pretty dumb (good) in proportion to quality. Do it.
But then they have an actual slim fit, which is slimmer. I suspect they do anti-vanity fits as a remnant of their old desire to scare fat people away from their clothes. Didn't work on me though!
I'd think greys and khaki would look good.

A blue suede belt might help... Or it might be a silly investment.
You could always go MTM.
Feet aren't square. They're not really curved either, but... most of the human body is curved, so curves look most pleasant to our eyes. Almost\-pointed squared toes are... not bad, but curves are generally just better.
This is my go to shoe chart: [http://www.thefineyounggentleman.com/pants/what\-color\-shoes\-to\-wear\-with\-what\-color\-pants/](http://www.thefineyounggentleman.com/pants/what-color-shoes-to-wear-with-what-color-pants/)

Unfortunately, the only blue there is navy, and the ones here seem like a more medium\-dark shade, so maybe they're not *as* versatile... But they should still be versatile.

Do you only have two pairs of pants?
Depends on the business setting. Do you see anybody rocking a similar belt or shoes?

Can you share the particular belt in question?
I'd try the medium. I stretched out a pair of shoes that my Epics should have fit properly once... Never again.
Are they? I know they limited numbers at some point \-\- is that what you're referring to?
It's blackmail, it's just really, really bad blackmail. Like, it's possible that she thought his publicist might prefer this didn't happen. But... That's not a great basis for blackmail.
It *does* attack non\-spoofers. Niantic goes after everybody with root, and many users without, in a haphazard attempt to ban everybody who might possibly be doing something wrong. I want the spoofers gone as much as anybody, but not at the expense of legitimate users.
I don't have any of those installed. I just checked through. I magisk hit tibu. Not seeing anything...
I don't think I've been banned, but the play store is suddenly telling me that my phone is incompatible with the update. I'm rooted and magisk'd, but not running any custom rom. I am not a spoofer.

Can any other Root users let me know how it's going?
Bonobos does 31/30 \-\- they can be found on sale, but I'm not seeing them on sale now.

Jomers does very high quality in this price range, but they apparently have somewhat inconsistent sizing \-\- do some research before diving in. [https://jomers.com/collections/chinos](https://jomers.com/collections/chinos)
Hard to gague length with Chelsea boots, but no. Generally, there's a range of pant lengths that look good. You're within the range. You could go longer for a different effect, but you are fine where you are.
Maybe our prices are being fuzzed somehow? Looking again, I'm actually seeing 110 euros. Oh well.
I was at a meeting of my Hillel \(Jew Club\), and some women were complaining about the lack of nice Jewish guys on campus. There were a few of us at the meeting. I had assumed they just weren't attracted to me, and you know, that's fine, but they said that in front of us, so I kind of jokingly cleared my throat, or made some comment, I can't remember... but I remember the response. Apparently, I "don't count." Again... I get that I didn't, I get that I wasn't a viable candidate for them to date, and they probably didn't *mean* to ruin me, but shit.
They opened one in NYC, so if you're ever around, do iiiit.
Looks like 109 Euros... is that $109 after vat?

I'm sure I've seen a slipper in a rosier color, but I don't know if I can think of where.
The problem is finding something in his size on short notice.
That's far from their greatest deal, but it's something.
Try 'em on. Both look good to me. If I had to pick based on visuals alone, I'd say Elton, but they're both beautiful lasts, and you should worry more about fit than the visual shape \-\- it doesn't matter how sexy the shoe is if it throws off your gait because it doesn't fit quite right.
Congrats, man!

That might be light packing for 13 days, but it looks pretty good. And those movies are good places to draw inspiration from.

Maybe go for a light/unstructured/unlined/chino/seersucker/linen blazer? I'd say oatmeal linen blend instead of khaki, for general wear, and unstructured, navy, wool \-\- so not formal, but nice enough for basically any restaurant. How's that sound?

edit: oh, consider rain. Waterproof your suede, and maybe bring a raincoat just in case.
If you *really* want a specific strategy... I tend to fold mine back \(shoulder to shoulder, with the front of the jacket on the outside and the back inside\), and then fold over my arm... But it's really not important. And I only do that with some of my jackets, others I just toss over my arm. Or over my shoulder. Or something.
Yeah, I guess it'll continue to build, as it does, but none of my threads have gotten a ton of love yet, so I was wondering if I was missing something... But maybe people just got distracted on those days.
I can't say what women think of monks, but I'm a fan. I fell in love with Meermin through their single monk, but over time, I... forgot what I loved about the single monk, and fell for the double, which is much more standard.

I can tell you that Meermin is an amazing brand, and the one pair I do have \(bit loafers\) got a good number of compliments... the one time I wore them, but still, more compliments than anything else I've ever worn, in one go, so yeah, good shit, right?
Yeah, I guess. Again, I'm not upset for myself, I just wanted to facilitate a larger conversation... Oh well.
I've seen worse.

The model is pretty ridiculous though. I can't tell if it's him, or the makeup, or the photographer, or what, but he looks like a mannequin.
One thing I'll note about short sleeved shirts \-\- we generally recommend going for a long sleeve shirt, and rolling the sleeves up. This looks better most of the time, and tends to be one of the few things you can do with clothing that women \(and gay men\) pretty consistently find attractive. So if you're in doubt, do that. \(Of course, as my inspo album shows, bond can make this look good \-\- so it's always possible\).
Well, there's also the idea that you get to customize features. So if you're looking for a very specific color, but you only found it with a button down, and you *need* it in a band collar, you get to throw that detail in. And then you pick contrasting buttons, or a specific collar height, or something like that... You don't just control the fit, you control a lot of details.

That said, I'm still poor, so... enjoy.
Budget? Our general recommendation is SuitSupply for $400, but we can recommend cheaper or nicer if you want.

I'm normally not the kind to worry about upvotes, but now that I'm running a megathread \(\_/$\)... I feel like I should at least look into this. Not for the karma, I have plenty, but so the threads can get enough attention to function as guides. So... Am I doing something wrong? I'm not getting as many upvotes as /u/coveo did, and my current thread \(linen shirts\) actually has fewer upvotes than my comment in the previous thread suggesting linen shirts.
I'm not that fat \-\- I wear a CT slim, but abercrombie relaxed small is perfect for me. And signature \(which i guess is their idea of "regular"\) was too slim \-\- they used to have a regular fit that was great for me, but that one disappeared, and the slim is too tight.

Besides, loose fitting linen is not bad. So I'd definitely recommend relaxed, if you're on the fence.
... wow, that ain't cheap. But I guess you don't bespeak clothing because you want it cheap, huh?

I also used to use stacks of persian rugs as very bad trampolines \-\- my aunt and uncle and grandpa work in a rug store, so my cousin and I would occasionally play around there, jumping across the stacks, playing hide and seek. It was pretty fun, actually.

Neither of those is very funny, huh? Oh well.
Eh. More people need belts than watches or ties. And ties have very distinct quality tiers, where most people are fine with anything 100&#37; silk, which can be found for pretty cheap. Watches are good...

But I think I wanna go for belts first.
[Luxire](https://custom.luxire.com/collections/linen-shirts) makes great mtm shirts. Most of their options under $100 are blends \-\- which might be a good option for you anyway, as it would reduce the wrinkling a little and maybe make it fare better in spring or fall.

I see the draw, but it would be practically tricky to share our favorite *fits* instead of our favorite *styles*, you know what I mean? Wide pants for one person might not be wide on another. I also don't know if this is something that you can viably do for cheap \-\- the fabric has to flow well, right?

Do you want the thread to wool trousers, so you can work from there? Maybe some good MTM tailors?
I mean, if we're talking about coats, it's good *some* of the time.
I'm seeing net upvotes now... maybe these posts are getting fuzzed now?
Lol, don't worry about it, I have plenty of imaginary internet points.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Well that's odd. Report him?
In one thread? I feel like most of the brands that make one well aren't really known for the other. Does anonymousism make dress socks? Do falke and pantherella make casual socks?
A few of these are below the price range. J. Crew generally isn't too hard to get on sale. But for the right price, yeah, they make good stuff.
They can, but black oxfords are more for professional scenarios than buscas. IE, they're ideal with a full suit. Maybe black wingtip oxfords? Or brown oxfords, or black bluchers/derbies.

Or, you know, go with plain black oxfords, but don't wear them too often, and save them for interviews and client meetings and stuff.
You're not wrong, but we've done plenty of talking... and most of it happens in an echo chamber. We have to be more strategic to be effective.

They're leather... so if you look up the hangar project on youtube, that guy is the pro on technique. He also uses the expensive stuff, so don't worry so much about that.

A brush and a damp cloth can hopefully get rid of the dirt, but you might need leather cleaner. Only condition after it's clean, or you'll trap the dirt in. Lexol makes a good and cheap leather cleaner and conditioner. I bought the conditioner, but I haven't gotten any leather cleaner yet \-\- I generally keep my leather shoes relatively clean, being a city\-slicker and whatnot.
I wouldn't pair them with brown shoes. What color are the adidases?

White shirt is ideal. Grey works. Black tees, too. Light pink might work, but I generally feel like black is best in monochrome setups.
Lol, thanks! I wish I had more to throw in there, though. Maybe a few florals, for the adventurous.
Eh. I need to be less critical of myself.

Idk, is it shitty?
[this guy might know.](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8d5ox0/your_favorite_for_linen_shirts/dxkggql/)

I will note, in general, that you don't necessarily need a slim fit on a linen shirt. Something the flows well might look better in a looser fit.
I'd recommend trying to deal with the underlying issue, but yes, these are a good last resort.
1. See a doctor.
2. Shave, or at least trim your pits. If you have hair there, it's providing unhelpful insulation.
3. Wear lighter, more breathable shirts. See: [linen](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8d5ox0/your_favorite_for_linen_shirts/).
4. Wear darker colors.
5. If none of this works, ruin undershirts instead, and keep your shirt shirts nice.
I've purchased three Abercrombie shirts in this price range, but returned two of them. White was transparent, and the shade of purple I got was not right for me, but the Navy shirt is probably my favorite shirt. I'm a shorter man, and I'd normally be a medium, but a small relaxed from Abercrombie actually fits perfectly \-\- and the wrinkles shorten the weird middle part of the cut very nicely. I've washed my shirt a few times, and it still feels light, and soft, and wonderful.
[Abercrombie](https://www.abercrombie.com/shop/us/mens-lightweight-shirts) can be had pretty easily in this price range. They're at $33 right now, but you can get $20 off $50 if you sign up for their club thing \(with or without a real email\), and if you do that for each purchase, and buy an even number, that's $23 per.

It is... It's not looking that bad now on the surface, but I remember going there one day and seeing something mildly racist involved in most posts. Just now, though... there's a Hitler joke topping off funny, which... I guess could top /r/funny, too, but it just seems so unsurprising on Voat.

Casual socks.

\(I'd actually rather do dress socks myself, but I feel like the sub wants casual socks more\).
Belts are an option \-\- we haven't really done accessories yet, and belts are worth talking about.
Rain Coats were a standout last week.

If there's a draw order that can win you the game, this in no way affects the likelihood of that draw order. So no. This card does nothing.
There are Free clients, and software freedom is primarily about the users. But yeah, Twitter's not the greatest network.

That said \-\- if you want to make social change, you need a network where your posts will be seen. So we're in a tricky position.
Also proprietary.
Pick one senator. Go into that senator's state, and make an *actual* difference. Tweeting is not an actual difference.
>Do you think this pay scale based on nothing objective should be enforced somehow

By a government? No, probably not. By the soft hand of public opinion? Sure.

>or are you saying everyone deserves equal pay \(that's actually not equal because it's based on dozens of subjective factors just like the one they're using now\) 

... wat? I specifically said that when equal pay is appropriate was a tricky question. I don't believe that gender should be a factor in pay determination... And generally, age shouldn't be either. A lot of things should or shouldn't be factors.

>the same way people might say "we deserve zero calorie burgers"?

... wtf are you talking about?

... If you keep ignoring my points, and attacking me for believing things I've already told you I don't believe, I will block you.
I didn't say that at all. Actually, I said the opposite quite aggressively, despite your attempts to trick me into saying what you just said. Screen\-time\-based pay rates would qualify as an objective measure, but I've said multiple times that the issues here are fundamentally subjective. How well they do the job is a huge factor, to me.

Edit: and, to be clear, significance of the role is too \-\- a more significant role with less screen time should sometimes weigh in favor of higher pay.
Equal pay means equal pay.

When a worker should be entitled to equal pay is a tricky question without an objective answer across industries. It's particularly difficult in Hollywood, of course, where, because we're dealing with art, talent, and fame, there's a necessarily significant piece of subjectivity involved.

But to be clear: ERW has no shortage of screen time, and probably does more work than any other character on the show, if you count makeup \-\- I imagine she goes through a lot for the whole quasi\-robot image. She's also immensely skilled \-\- maybe not as skilled as Hopkins, but maybe more so than Harris. The biggest problem for her appeared to be relative lack of fame. But given her critical lead role and her willingness to be naked on camera, I still think she deserves equal pay to Hopkins and Harris, easily.

I can see the argument that Hopkins was a crazy pull, and since he was a season 1 draw who won't be as significant if at all present in coming seasons, there's plenty of room in the budget for him. But even Ed Harris doesn't seem *that* special to me, and I'm skeptical that he'll be around until the end, anyway. That was actually a significant part of my thought here \-\- "equal to who," as in, "what's Ed Harris getting paid in season 3?" As in "Is Ed Harris even going to be in season 3?"

Finally, remember that they need to keep ERW happy to keep her around, whereas they have no such need with Anthony Hopkins.
Uhhh... Not if she's going around killing humans now. And maybe we get more flashbacks too -- I'm hoping we get some supporting scenes with Hopkins.
They can be worn casually, in the worst case. Anyway... Yeah, that's an issue, but they make a black suit more interesting. How would you?
You didn't ask me to define my terms.

Look up the strawman fallacy, asshole. Start responding to my points or stop replying.
Yes, that's what I meant. Hopkins is kind of like... I'm having trouble coming up with the example, but he's the season one movie star to set the stage, you know? He's not going to make her money over the course of the series. Hell, I hope he shows up again...
I wasn't sure if you were saying that, or commenting on the comments section, but... It's much riskier not to show that code.

When the code is proprietary... Hackers can usually figure out what it's doing without too much effort. It doesn't really help security at all.

But when it's Free, *everybody* can tell, whether or not they're trying to break in. And good citizens can find and point out bug fixes that improve your code and its security (or its functionality).

What's more, you can share it with other nations, banks, tech companies, security firms... You can share it with all of these companies. They'll use it because it's free, and they'll improve it because they can. And they'll probably share their improvements with you.
Well it seems you've found your key demographic. Congrats.
Two rockbiters. Not that it's a big difference, neither is an otk.
Is that always true? I feel like that's truer of a more relaxed fit than of a perfect one.

I've heard things along those lines about high arm holes, though. That they force your posture up, but are still comfortable.
I didn't refuse to define my terms. You didn't ask. You know exactly what a main/lead character is. You asked for an objective measure of it, which is completely irrelevant. Stop dodging the issue.
Anything that would make for a good inspo album. I'm liking 2 and 3 here... 1 is okay but wonky background and wonky photo quality. 4 is a weird crop situation. If you have more though, I'm interested. Especially if you can get them for me before I post the _/$ thread.

I took some from lookbooks and style blogs, but didn't find as many as I thought I would.
People in the biz get paid based on fame *and talent*. She was picked as the lead for *talent*. They could have found a Hopkins-tier star for her role (okay, maybe not his level at her age, but still) but they wanted her. And that's not because she was cheap -- HBO doesn't seem to give many fucks about cheap. They picked her as the star because they wanted her.

They picked Hopkins as a season one gimmick... And yes, also for his incredible talent, but he isn't driving the show, he just set the stage. And Harris... I can't imagine he's going to stay with us especially long, but even if he does, he's really not the point, now is he?

Her talent is the core of the performances on the show. They don't have a show without key talent in her role.

And finally: yeah, no, if they replace Dolores' body, I am sure most people will find that jarring *and* corny, and probably stop watching. There's no show without ERW.
Why?

Who the fuck cares about objective measures? This is TV. This is art. There's plenty of debate about which character in a given work is the main character. The fact that it's subjective doesn't make it any less worthwhile to discuss, nor less relevant in salary determinations.
Were.

If I had to pick one star, though, it's clear to me, it's all about the first host the park ever had.
Hopkins was a season one draw, but even Harris, given his role... Eh.
Is the new kid the star?
Hopkins was a season one exception. Harris, maybe, but she's more significant.
Maev, I was on the fence about (supporting vs main), since she was mostly on the side of the main plot, but looking again... She's #2 to become self aware, and now she's  basically a super-powerful monster... And she gets enough screen time, so yeah, sure, she's a main character.
But what I'm saying is that "looking good" is different to different people. Particularly in this thread \-\- Zuck, like Trump, wears bad suits to achieve a better affect, given his audience and his goals. And that works for them.

Likewise, I am an attorney; dressing very well will make certain clients think of you as a douchebag. You don't want to go to Rikers in a bespoke suit, do you? And think of juries \-\- are they going to prefer the guy who looks like a million bucks, or the guy who looks like three hundred?

Let's use a different kind of example: the Wire is better than The Big Bang Theory. By far. Like, the best show ever against one of the worst. Not even fucking close. But the average person seems to prefer BBT \-\- maybe because it's an easy drama against a difficult drama. Once you factor in audience, BBT is... more successful, in a very important sense.

Fashion doesn't really teach us many lessons. I'm not going to learn about human nature and the folly of politics from a great\-fitting suit.  So it's "better" \-\- but what does that matter? If people appreciate the person in the worse suit more, isn't the worse suit serving its wearer better? Why should we so eagerly seek the "better" fit if it's only better in some obscure, irrelevant sense?
I don't know if it's a supporting role.

1. He's the only "host" that isn't a host. He's the only one who has consistently tricked humans into thinking he was a human.
2. He's in a completely unique position now, as a robot who has been living as a human.
3. If we get more flashbacks, he'll be playing a different character with equal\-ish importance to Anthony Hopkins'. In addition to the other important character he's playing.
Are we going to get any flashbacks of Jeffrey Wright? That would be a factor in my determination.
Equal to who?

More importantly, who is getting paid as much as her? Isn't she *the* star?

Edit: Yes, Ed harris. Anthony Hopkins is obviously not getting paid more than ERW for season 2. I was partly asking because I see no evidence that Ed Harris is going to be paid at all for season 3. But also, realize, ERW gets top billing, is huge talent, and is crucial to the show. Hopkins, I get \-\- he's incredible, but he's also a season 1 attraction. Ed Harris though, even... Eh. ERW is more important.
Pick a time. Go to sleep eight hours before then. Not seven and a half hours. Eight.

Wake up at that time. You will feel like shit.

Do it again. You will feel like shit.

Do it like... fifteen more times. You will feel like shit.

Do it again. You'll start to feel better.

Keep doing it. Do it on weekends. Don't wake up, grab your phone, and lay in bed for twenty minutes, that doesn't count. Wake up, stand up, wash your face, drink some water, be awake, and *then* check your phone. No, nothing is on fire.

And it'll get easier and easier. You might even wake up a minute before your alarm, because you're so damn used to it.

The only tricky thing is picking a time that works relatively well every day. if you're the kind of guy who *sometimes* stays out until 2 am but *sometimes* has to be at work by 9 am... Well, okay, I mess with mine a little, but it's not great.
Well, this battlecry would undo a random action in the sidebar... but if you don't otk with your shudderwock, and don't erase a necessary action... yeah, it will undo the last shudderwock you played, so you can get into a nice comfy time loop.
I'm not sure what that has to do with what I said.
Which stores are you going to?

"Generic" is good. "Generic" is classic, simple, basics. Those pieces will be versatile. Wearing them well will take you far.

What's your budget? If you can get clothes custom\-made, you'll get some *great* fitting clothing.

BTW, the thing that "agreed" with you was a stupid bot. Nobody here is going to say you can't dress better.
Neither of those suits is a great fit, nor a great color \(we tend to avoid black here\). Can you return both? We can recommend better brands \(and better prices, and better styles\).
I am working on an inspo album for linen shirts... Try as I might, I've found ten. Anybody else have anything good on hand?
Nighttime? Indoors or outdoors?

Tuxes don't look plain. Tuxes are essentially the party version of suits. Suits are business clothes. Tuxes say you came to party.

But if you're committed to black suits... let's see if we can mess with the shoes. How about these: [https://www.deltoroshoes.com/collections/mens\-slippers\-1/products/mens\-black\-velvet\-slipper](https://www.deltoroshoes.com/collections/mens-slippers-1/products/mens-black-velvet-slipper). You still need black with minimal styling, but these are velvet and unique and great. They also have a red stripe in the back \-\- that's fine. \(These are generally good everywhere but business \-\- either for black tie or casual, but a wedding, even with a suit, should work\).
eehhhhh be careful. It ain't your wedding. Suggest it, but if the bride knows what she wants, don't let us talk you into harassing her.
You're clearly ignoring my question. Looking good matters, but only by the standard of who you look good *to*. If you look great, except to people, then you don't look great at all. Who appreciates the ideal looks that we're all searching for, aside from us?
I'm not sure what song you're thinking of, but I believe you. Then again, I've heard, in other contexts, that women don't really care or can't tell the difference.
I'd assume not \-\- I feel like the government has to show up on all criminal trials. Now, if the appeal were denied in the first place, that would be one thing, but once it's granted, it needs to be opposed.

Now, the opposition might be easy. The case is pretty silly. But I can't imagine that the court can dismiss a criminal defendant's unopposed motion... ever?
They *are* opposing the motion to vacate. You don't get your judgment vacated when you are pardoned. Your judgment is still on the books.

The waste of time is Arapio trying to pretend that, just because the government has forgiven him, he didn't do the shit he did.
That all looks fine, man. Don't overthink it. Is it warm enough where you are for linen? I also have it on good authority \(read: reddit, so bad authority, but still\) that women like rolled up sleeves, so that's a good move.

If anything, I'd get a brown leather belt to match with the shoes a little better. But your belt is covered, and you already have brown, so who cares?

In the long term, it would be nice to have navy chinos, but feel free to wait for a good sale.

You got this.
Allow me to clarify: if only men's fashion snobs appreciate it, is it really worth it to focus so hard on getting a good fit? Or do other people appreciate it, such that it is worth it?
Wearing used clothing is pretty terrifying to me, particularly as I know there's a reason its original owner doesn't want it anymore. And I know *sometimes* they just don't like the style anymore... But I don't trust myself to find a loose thread or a tiny hole or stain or something that "ruins" a garment. Is there a good way for me to learn to spot these sorts of issues well enough that I'm comfortable purchasing used clothing?
Those all sound like good shirts to have, but the white one is good -- can't really go wrong with a white button down.

What kind of shoes do you have?

I'd go with navy chinos and decent shoes, if you got 'em.
Compare these all to Kaz potions. Except you build your Kaz potion, and you get your spellstone at random.
Do you have good chinos or a good button down now? Good shoes?

What shops do you have near you?
A white shirt is never wrong. I wouldn't worry about socks and shirts matching, though, especially if your shirts aren't statement pieces. If your shirt clashes with these socks, it's probably too busy in the first place.
Budget?
You can wank your friend off ad infinitum, but you'll need two of this, so you can undo and redo and undo and redo and undo and redo the shudderwock.
"Your a cringe terrorist. You're goal..."
I'm a lawyer, and while I understand the argument that dressing well is useful to me, and helps me represent my clients better, Mark Zuckerberg is not tricking me into dressing worse. Anybody who is going to an office where a suit is required is not looking at Zuck's tees and thinking, "yeah, that's fine." Meanwhile, if he's making my interviewers, clients, and friends less concerned with the way I'm dressing, he's doing me a favor \-\- although I'm planning on being well dressed anyway, I want to be judged on my ability, not my appearance.
... I'm confused, are you insulting yourself now?
Thanks. It's good to have at least one good Bond photo in the album.
where do you get your propaganda? Do you really think those numbers make sense?

... billions? Are you mentally ill?
Wow. I thought there would be one or two shit show comments in here, but the whole section is just a mess.
Yeah, whereas Palestinians killing Jews is always to celebrated!

Edit: to be clear, that's sarcasm.
No, I'm serious. If a better fit is "better," it must be better *for some purpose*, right? But if a really great fit looks bad to people \-\- if it makes them think less of you \-\- then it's not great! It doesn't really serve much purpose at all!

I know *I* appreciate a good\-fitting suit more, but I'm a snob. What's the endgame? What's the point of it all?
Too many to follow. Look for 100&#37; wool, good\-feeling wool, a good waist fit, and other pleasant details. If you notice real horn buttons, that's good. Smell them, look for loose threads, and otherwise try to make sure the things aren't falling apart. Oh, and make sure you like the pattern \-\- some whacky patterns are just unwearable.
We are social creatures, and it's fine to use that to your advantage, but it's not fine to shame others for not being great at the same social games. Don't get me wrong, if people walk around naked, or show up to formal events in flip flops, there's a sort of tone\-deafness that you can rightly be upset about, but saying that his suit's fit isn't perfect, and that that's morally unacceptable, is absolute horseshit. I am not aware of *any* debate on the extent to which it's horseshit \-\- it's a pretty wide consensus.

This, of course, is ignoring that Zuck's style is probably relatively intentional and achieves the desired effect. No, I'm focusing specifically on the utter lie this article is premised on, which is that imperfect style has moral consequences, and that everybody should be as invested in a personal style as us.
Everybody is worried about draw paradoxes, and here I'm trying to figure out an otk. Maybe something like... razorpetals? This \+ Soceror's Apprentice \+ either Razorpetal card might do it, depending on the mechanics.

Edit: no, you'd need an infinite loop of these, so... maybe two of these and a panda? this \-\> panda \-\> this on this, to restore this to... no, that wouldn't work. Mana\-wise, especially.

IDK just give me exodia.
No, no, you'd get those 15 minutes of your life back. You undo it. Don't you know how undoing works?
Thanks. If you happen to have any other good linen shirt photos for an inspo album, I'd appreciate 'em.
I see what you're saying... there's definitely linen involved, though, right? It's not, like, seersucker or some other strange weave of cotton?

I am putting together a linen shirt inspo album. I think I'm going to have to include blends, first because I'm not always sure whether a photo is 100&#37; linen, and second because I'm having trouble finding a lot of good linen shirt photos.
Eh, worst case, use them as a beater.
I'm... I'm so sorry.
Wait, did they want to do vest *without jackets*?

.... do they want people to confuse the party and the waiters?
Or with a suit and tie for an "I have no idea what I'm doing" look.

Yeh, they're as casual as they get.
What's your budget? Macy's and JCF are the usual cheap recs.

Can you skip the vests? It will make finding the fits better, and it will make everybody look better.
Is this shirt linen? It looks like it to me, but I've been through a bunch of blogs that don't actually say what the shirt is made of, but point out that the suit is linen.

I understand that better fitting suits fit better, but... when is the effect of a perfect\-fitting suit a good thing? Does it create a good effect if you're negotiating a contract? Does it appeal to women? Who actually thinks more highly of you if you're wearing a perfect suit, except for other fashion snobs?
Maybe I could see a problem if the argument was that they make it look *good* to dress badly. Like men who already know how to dress well actively dress worse because of the bad style of their bad role models. But that doesn't strike me as what's happening, and it wouldn't be that big of a problem if it were.
Bitch, it is okay to dress badly. Nobody should be *expected* to dress in any way at all. The fact that we are is a wholly unnecessary social construct. I dress well because I want to, not because of some moral imperative. STFU, murray.

But you can run Signal on your own servers. Wire, too, I think. Hopefully the metadata is encrypted in transit to the servers, which I guess requires two layers of encryption, but yeah.
Right, but why? Somebody else already did all that work for them.
Does this have any advantage over Signal?
Didn't Russia throw some subpoena or something at Telegram? I see no clear sign that it's been broken yet...

But yeah, signal and wire would definitely be better options.
I don't think it makes much sense to design a messaging protocol that leaks at least a little metadata. The protocol at least needs to know who to route the message to.
Telegram isn't encrypted by default, and they run their own encryption. I'd use Signal or Wire. Wire brags about being based in Europe.
Do they have a warrant canary specific to WhatsApp?

Anyway, people should be using Signal or Wire instead.
All good. Happens to all of us.

Well, we also don't know *how* criminal Trump's enterprise is. I mean, he's obviously broken some laws, but if it's just a few here and there... I mean, there was plenty of legal work for Cohen to have done.

Eh, then again, he got his offices raided for a reason. Let's see what that reason was.
Oh, of course it's possible. I'd even say it's likely. I'm just saying it might not be, and it might not result in the juicy Stormy Daniels reveal some people are hoping for.
Neither of those is necessarily illegal.
"cheap." You mean less expensive... Still pretty expensive, though.
Sometimes, that's what I want. At least when I was starting out, I didn't want to know how shoes were made, I wanted to know what it was that made me look bad so I could stop doing it, and the more angrily you'd tell me, the more I'd remember.
But not his more specific motion to have first cut on the privilege question, right?

Lauren Ralph Lauren suits are not worth $250.

Multiple screens are showing up as purple to me, in contrast with a red mark on the shirt taggy thingy, but I guess we just see two different things. Maybe somebody else will tell us who's slowly going colorblind.
Okay. Is it the photo that makes it look distinctly purple, or am I crazy?
That shirt is... Red?
Thank you for the cross section.
Well their website was showing like 300-500 Euro for everything, so... Well, if I'm ever in Philly again, I'll try to check out their store.
Maybe try wearing them a little bit around the house. But don't wear them two days in a row.
Never had one... But from what I can tell on Amazon... They're probably fused. So... I'm thinking you can get similar quality from Macy's or JCF for about $150 on sale \(Bar III or Thompson\). Or, if you're stuck buying online, go with TM Lewin on clearance for even less, and they'll be half canvassed, so much better quality. But fit is important, so try to try stuff on.
They'll probably shrink.
I'm seeing Carlos Santos at roughly double Meermin's prices... Are you saying their seconds are preferable over Meermin firsts? How do you buy seconds?
They were mini bosses, and felt like it. They came up in exploration, not at any important point. And they kind of just die. I had a lot of fun hunting Lynels, but they didn't really replace major bosses.
I can't wait until people figure out a way to parody these parody posts.
Only thing I'd say is, avoid black on black denim. It's a bigger problem for blues, but the same color denim jacket and pants creates what's known as the "canadian tuxedo." You don't want that.
My point was more that you'd be a horrible person if you invested on the condition that they lead their research away from a cure, or invested and then voted for a CEO who would lead the company away from a cure, or something like that.

But yeah, we should not only have government investment \(in the form of grants and prizes in exchange for freely licensed cures\), but effective regulation \(which might say something like, if you have a cure, you aren't allowed to sit on it just to maximize profits\).
Navy. For sure.
You get a network that actually works, whereas without seeding, BitTorrent would fall apart and be utterly useless.

There also happen to be incentives in place, but if you're asking "why shouldn't I be a selfish parasite," then fuck off.
I don't think anybody was blaming he pensions...
It sounds like there's something you can do, and you just don't want to do it, but would rather continue supporting theft.

And... Don't get me wrong, I get it. You're not running the company. And you need a job. And your input is relatively minor.

But there's something you can do.
But you would be a horrible person for acting on this information. And if the information only helps bad people do bad things, isn't the person who provides it a bad person?
That sounds a little long, though....
I mean, a ton of Instagram accounts to follow.
Budget?
Maybe don't tuck in the ocbd? Is it too long?
Was this a reply to something?
I'm pretty sure searching this sub will leave you with a ton.
Okay...

Be sure to get plenty of sleep.

Is there some other kind of advice you wanted? Did you have a question?
Just al'akir? and scg for taunts but... still.
Nope. Free and free. They offer paid support for business users a la slack, but they'll federate servers some point this year, and you can always host your own without paying them. AGPL, I think.
I'm looking for some good dress socks, probably in cotton because summer is happening, and probably at least one good pair of no shows that don't slip or piss me off in some way. I need a pretty small size \-\- 7.5. I mention this in particular because I have a pair of Falkes that should be my size, but are too big.

That said, I have a strange caveat: I generally don't pay full price for much of anything \(unless full price is an amazing deal and also the absolute cheapest\). I got a pair of Meermins for $95. I got a bonobos blazer for $60. So... I'm looking for the most absurdly good deal in socks that can be found.

My general approaches are: sample sales, ebay nwt, and other deep sales off clearance for good brands. I got Brescianis and Falkes for $12 each. I'm also willing to go to TJ Maxx, and have gotten Darn Tough and Woolrich socks there for \~$5 each, but those were on the thicker and less attractive side. Anybody know more deals along these lines? Particularly for small socks \-\- I don't want to spend another $12\+ and get another pair of great socks I can't wear.

If I want to get a vaguely decent phone from Sprint with an unlockable bootloader, is the ph\-one my only option? I'm in a position where I can get a subsidy, and I figure the ph\-one is better than selling an S9 and buying an exynos S9...
I didn't realize that I had to enable this manually... Thanks for telling me!
Just looked it up \-\- it's going for 44 euros now, which is above $50, but looks good for holding euros. I wish our money in the US was smaller.
They can be annoying, but if you take a photo of yourself, you own all relevant IP rights, so you can upload it under whatever license they want. And IP is probably the biggest issue with regards to images.
I mean, the dude asked, so we gave our opinions. It's not a big deal, I'm just personally not a fan. Feel free to ignore me.
Why not tap your wallet instead of messing with your phone?
I own both, but chinos are more comfortable and more versatile \(as you can wear them to the office, for example\). I like them more all around.
Then let's *generally* upgrade them, shall we?
That was some great planning. Who told you that Kirby Star Allies was coming out 4.5 years ago?
This is kind of why I'm pumped for Smash. It never gets old.
I'll bring 'em up next week, worth discussing.
Wasn't that one based on real events?
So this wikipedia page has a pretty bad photo for a men's tux: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi\-formal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-formal).

I don't actually own a tux, or else I'd take a better one myself. Anybody wanna take a better photo and put it up on wikipedia under the CC\-BY\-SA?
Does anybody wanna give us some more context so we can remind ourselves that he *really did spout* that horseshit?
Yeah season 5 got weiiiiird.
What if you took your prison clothes with you? Would that be legal?
The annoying part isn't that cops are allowed to do this, it's the fact that the cops will use this to build a case dishonestly, rather than, in the scene you saw, where they used these techniques to get a confession from somebody who actually did what he did.
The wire is insanely realistic.
I oversimplified, but my point is, like the tee shirt, Jeans help push the whole look down, while chinos follow the rest of the look.
Navy and Charcoal are probably more versatile, generally. I'd go for some navy chinos, see how you feel about those. I know you said you didn't like 'em, but they're very versatile and comfortable, there's no real risk of them sitting in your closet and doing nothing.
Ah, yeah, you're right, that was it.
Promise not to bid on 6.5uk?

I'd say to button up the bottom button on the polo. But you're good.
... what? Is it impolite to wear shoes that you've worn outside the gym in the gym? Why?
Yeah, I mean, you'll look more casual than with a suit, but... I actually wore chinos with a tee shirt to my grandpa's birthday a little while back, and my cousin commented that I looked formal, so... idk.
I got 'em on their eBay seconds store. For $95. They're an old model, they don't sell 'em anymore.
I don't understand how chinos could be a fad. They're suer basic. They're more comfortable and they look better in most contexts.
We thought you did.

Navy and charcoal are the real classics. Play with some other blues and grays, maybe a dark burgundy or some dark shade of purple. For chinos, khaki is classic but I've never been a fan. You mentioned cream, maybe that works. I was on the fence about some oatmeal linen pants once, but ended up returning them. Maybe even go for white linen \-\- it might be a little transparent, so check on that before you commit.
I'm in NYC too, and I still find the Guccis noticeable. I'm not *impressed*, it's not the world's most amazing look, but it says what it's supposed to say: "look how rich I am."

But I agree with you, better stuff doesn't announce itself like that.

FWIW, I just got some Meermin bit loafers, and I think they're going to make a nice statement piece, at least in the circles I travel in.
The only downside of chinos is that, *since* they're versatile, you can't do something like, pair them with a blazer and look casual. Jeans *force* casual. But other than that, I prefer chinos all around.

\(Also I guess you can go longer without washing jeans and they can stand up to a lot\).
I'd sooooo prefer straight bounties \-\> open access and cheap generics over what we have now.
Well, hold on, it's for a year. If SCG or that other legendary rotates out, we should be fine. It'll still be strong AF, but not a problem.

Lifedrinker isn't lifesteal, it's straight up restore health. Lifesteal would have been a reasonable hit to shudderwock, though.

Maybe facebook struck a deal where they reveal everything *but* whatsapp, and whatsapp doesn't get blocked.
Or maybe they have some way around it?
Well, and based on the fact that OWS worked with them and said they implemented it right, but yeah, it's pretty risky to trust them.
Or wire! Wouldn't that be great, if wire had more than three users?
To be fair, some of us are just running grumble in an ordinary battlecry shaman.

Ah, interesting. I could have imagined it going either way.

The problem is that they generally can't actually afford it. They take their families' savings and invest everything in shoes that make *me* wince, and I'm an American.
Man, your edit sure ain't doin' you no favors.
You can save the hassle of reporting a false claim against your credit when they yell at you for not returning their hardware, though.
Well, string loafers aren't really "classic," are they? Dos styleforum menswear love suede? I feel like they'd be the kind of snobs that think suede is casual and therefore terrible \(although I also know the kind of snobs who think that suede is amazing and underappreciated\).
Hah! I opened 36! Including a third legendary! Including one or two that are actually playable! #chameleos4yfe
Oh, I'm sure that Tom Ford wouldn't make a white sneaker that was anything less than phenomenal. I just wasn't sure if he sold one. But yeah, he does.
Do you look up the item in question to make sure Tom Ford sells one, or do you just recommend it right away?

Edit: Just to clarify: https://www.tomford.com/warwick-grained-leather-sneaker/J1045T-DAP.html?cgid=men-shoes-sneakers&dwvar_J1045T-DAP_color=BRR#start=24
Interestingly, this is one case where "thrifting" might not actually be a worthwhile approach, because shit, how are you going to find clean, high\-quality white sneakers at a thrift shop? Even if they land there by some miracle, somebody will spot them before you.

If you're in this price bucket, go cheap, or go black.
again, that's particular to "Hawaiian," and most cuban collar shirts you find in that will not suffer from the same deformity. I'm not making any specific guarantees here, though.
Concerto is a similar free tool that's pretty widely used: [http://www.concerto\-signage.org/](http://www.concerto-signage.org/)
People also call them "cuban collar" shirts, and if you get them in a not\-too\-loud pattern, they shouldn't be that hard. "Hawaiian" implies loud pattern, so search for info about cuban collar shirts.
I meet your exact description. I love my navy a&f linen button down in small. I think they have refigured fits since I got it, but relaxed is good for me.
It's better for very specific purposes \-\- particularly, for flaunting wealth and impressing certain people. It's not always easy to see how expensive EG shoes are \-\- they look great, but only to people with taste. Gucci's bit loafers look like you purchased them from Gucci and paid $700\+ for them.
At some point. Probably not soon. Probably fall.
My mom doesn't play cards. She just yells. She wanted to make sure I was ready on time this morning. I always am. I told her I would be. And then she spent the next twenty minutes yelling at me for not being ready on time. I was ready three minutes early. She's still pissed at me for not being ready on time.
"the next one" has never been any part of how I browse threads on Reddit. No matter how closely I manage my favorite subreddits, a lot of them just involve a lot of boring/uninteresting stuff.
I mean, it makes sense if you want to see *every single post* on Reddit, but you'd have to be a masochist.
Remember that link areas are not right\-clickable or ctrl\-clickable because fuck you. #1 issue here for me the name of the subreddit I'm in now \-\- I can't open a background tab for it, which I do *all* the time.

Also note that actual links *always* open in new tabs and *never* in the current tab because, again, fuck you. Except my profile link \-\- that one started working shortly after I complained.
EG is probably better quality, but I can't say I've handled one. Lots of reviews on gyw though.

I have a good friend who swears by B&L, but I think that, as expensive as his tastes get, EG still isn't on the menu.
>Upon the launch of the iPhone 4, Jobs stated that Apple would immediately start working with standards bodies to make the FaceTime protocol an "open industry standard". 

Well, to be fair, that's not the same as open sourcing the app. But thanks!
Systematically focus on stuff you need. Try to focus on 1\-3 items at a time. Get a lot of neutral stuff that you can wear with anything \(gray, navy, white shirts, black and brown dress shoes, black and white sneakers...\). Build up a few high end basics in every category.

While you're doing that, try to figure out how to find great deals. For example, check [the Meermin eBay store](https://www.ebay.com/usr/goodyearshoes?_trksid=p2053788.m1543.l2754), where you can get great deals on great shoes, with **patience**. Patience is generally very useful for getting high\-end clothing on the cheap. It's going to take you some time to build up your wardrobe anyway, so put dress shoes on the back burner, make lowball bids at that ebay page until you find the auction that you want to win, and then take the opportunity when you find it.

Get a small number of statement pieces, near the end of your search. SMALL number. Patience is, again, useful here. Statement pieces are never urgent like basics, and you have to wait until you find the one that really speaks to you, so don't jump on the first funky thing you find.

That all sound about right?
For shoes: try either drivers or loafers, or maybe suede slippers \(maybe not what you're thinking\). If you want to consider loafers, read this and tell me which style you like and what your price range is, and I'll recommend brands: [https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8ay05g/how\_to\_talk\_about\_loafers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8ay05g/how_to_talk_about_loafers/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=user&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=u_danhakimi).

Or you could go with bluchers or something like that. Loafers are more popular in DC these days, and then NYC is usually a little more formal \(although you definitely see loafers and drivers\), and the west coast is a little more casual \(sneakers or maybe drivers\).
Suede is hard to wear in a business context, and I'd say the more brogued ones look better anyway. I have a pair of dark brown suede wingtip bluchers I love \(but they're an old J. Crew model I got off grailed for cheap\).

Brown suede \+ blue calf is an... interesting shoe collection, though, I have to say.
London \-\> Saville Row and other menswear stops are pretty high\-end, probably worth going just to browse and bask in the luxurious suiting. As far as cheap stuff: the TM Lewin store there makes half canvassed suits under $150 on clearance, which is amazing, but pretty impossible to try on in the US. It might also be worth trying on a Barbour coat there.

Italy is also great for high end menswear, but I don't have specific locations in mind. I feel like Italy is for wandering, though.

Shoes in general should be like that. They're investments. If you want 'em, go for 'em, and care for 'em, and they'll last you a long time.
CM?

Anyway... I didn't know that, they're just great.
Well, try looking at velvet slippers in general.
Less sleek? Show me a photo of what you're thinking of, because the Ferragamo bit loafer I saw was an apron toe, and Gucci's was moc.
If you're talking about their apron toe bit loafer, that's pretty different.
Boy, how'd ya figure that one out, Sherlock?

OH! I can't believe I didn't think of it! Socks!

What about the US internment of Japanese Americans? I mean, I'm sure you view it negatively and all, but is it a major focus in WWII education? Do you guys hold resentment against the United States for that, or for the nuclear bombs? Because... They don't really teach much about the internment in US schools, but it's generally something we recognize as a very dark time in our history, and people tend to view what we did as pretty horrible, but... I mean, we don't still really hate the British, or anything. So I kind of just want to know where the current Japanese feelings are.

They really need to make better use of the brawls right before big set releasees.

It seems like they just pick them at random.
Sorry, T.M. Lewin is more athletic than Charles Tyrwhitt for a given slimness. That is to say, the shoulder : body width ratio is a little higher. It should be slight, but yeah.

They are about the same price \-\- $29.50 on clearance, or CT 3 @ $99.
Maybe just go to TJ Maxx. That's the one thing I don't mind getting from there, since I don't mind if it's super cheap, and it is. But I can't recommend many specific brands.

A friend swears by one particular set of Uniqlos with zip pockets that go for $20ish, I think.
This is really cool!

... but what is it doing in this sub?
Can you link to a website? I'm sure a few people here would love to hear more about Toronto. We yap enough about NYC...
There's an Allen Edmonds one floating around, which auctions off thirds, returns and the like... Anybody have that link handy?
Uniqlo. Actual Japanese instead of pretend Japanese.

A&F. They're scaling back on logos, but if you like logos, for some reason, they still have some of those.
Levis?
Bonobos is a lot more modern in its cuts.
Black Lapel in NYC for MTM stuff. They do pretty classic fits.

TML, if you want half canvassed suits on the cheap. Their shirts are probably not better than CTs, except that their fit is a little more athletic.
Bonobos, and other high\-end mall brands.
I got some Meermin bit loafers recently... they're not my first gyw shoes, but the other ones are from J. Crew so they're definitely a step up. I'll post something up here soon, but I don't know if it'll be a review, so much as an "oh my god I love these, I don't know what's wrong with them, let me know, no don't, no do!"
Some of you guys might be interested in our loafer discussion thread over at /r/malefashionadvice: [https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8bhse5/your\_favorite\_for\_loafers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8bhse5/your_favorite_for_loafers/). Or, really, have a lot to contribute.
They have some beautiful suede slippers for $450, if you're in the need for a really expensive casual blue suede slipper.
I like how this isn't a runespear cheat sheet because holy shit why would anybody ever play runespear.
It's mostly in the seam, and the smooth curve. I only realized this because of the how\-to\-talk\-about thread. Belgian loafers are inspired by the slipper, though, and there are obviously a lot of similarities between loafers and slippers in general.
>Make\-ups include more interesting leathers, color combinations, and patterns like a whole cut tassel loafer

That one's a slipper, but yeah, looks like an interesting brand!
Any way to distinguish between florsheim vintage and newer stuff?
>What? Where in the constitution is “fair use” covered?

The first amendment.
Actually, I think I saw a pretty hot woman in their SoHo shop when I visited... Let's hope she's Jewish.
I'm going to throw in one more recommendation, and then try to stay back.

[Carmina String Loafers](https://www.carminashoemaker.us/mens-loafers/string-loafer-snuff-suede-80228) are just really, really nice.
I generally try to stay back, but I've got to give credit to the top end. They're not cheap, but... [Edward Green](http://www.edwardgreen.com/shop/?category_attribute=2334) makes some fucking amazing shoes.
Is this the same thing as a cuban collar?
Care to link to that AE eBay store for the curious? \(Did you mean the main AE store, or some other secondhand store?\)

Also: try to post it under my "Under $100" comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8bhse5/your_favorite_for_loafers/dx6rg6o/).
Gucci bit loafers are essentially high quality for a super\-high quality price. Not bad purchases, but only really good if you want to use them as a status symbol.
I wasn't sure if the DMCA had actually gotten to farmers, which is why I said "generally," but thanks! Good to know!

They still have to actually do the circumventing. And Deere can legally make their system as secure as they want. So that's tricky.
I took a bit of a risk on the meermin seconds ebay store \-\- I'd tried on a couple of their lasts and I was generally a 6.5, but I ordered a pair of bit loafers in a "beat" last, and I couldn't find... any real information about that last... I bid low, and figured, "hey, I'm taking a risk, but it's Meermin, I can probably resell them for a pretty good price, worst case."

But hey, I won, they shipped, and... they fit like a glove. For my feet. A foot glove. A shoe, I guess. They fit like a shoe. Like a good\-fitting shoe. Yeah.

That said... Don't do what I did. Know that something fits before you spend good money on it.
They also made the original tassel loafers, and... yeah, they look pretty dope.
I can imagine you can get something like Florsheim or J&M's gyw models for similar prices if you know where to look, but their leather and QA aren't as good as Meermin's.

Like I said, it takes a lot of patience to get under $100, but I did it. And there is a surprisingly large amount of competition in my small size.
I absolutely concur. Also, they opened a store in SoHo, so you can go try shoes on in person and avoid $35 shipping. Note that they have a few different lasts there, so you might want to try a few different styles on.
It's April, so how about rain jackets/anoraks?
We've done a lot of outerwear lately, but field jackets and chore coats are pretty popular these days.
It's a little early, but I'd like to do linen shirts some time soonish. They're great for casual summer wear.
Polos were a relatively popular one last week. They're mostly best for muscular bodies, but still, they're worth talking about.
Alright, after finally winning an auction here, I can finally recommend a somewhat\-well\-kept secret in shoes: [Meermin's eBay page](https://www.ebay.com/usr/goodyearshoes?_trksid=p2053788.m1543.l2754).  These are seconds, but their QA is so insanely perfectionist that they'll probably come out better than AE seconds. You'll have to wait to get a great price on a great auction, and shipping is $35 to the US, but I recently won a pair of their bit loafers for $95 shpped.

In this price bin, patience pays off.

Also, I'll point out a funny bug, where, if you try to bid on black chelseas in 6.5uk, I'll hate you forever. So don't do it. (Seriously, some people bid above MSRP for seconds on those, what the shit eBay)?
**What should we do next week?**
