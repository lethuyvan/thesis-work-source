It does happen. Im in my 20s and I play about 3-6 matches spread across the entire day. 

No more spending 12 hours binge playing.

And a lot of people like scat porn, that doesn't make it normal.
I was on mobile when I made the post, so I did not know there was such a great list.

The trick is to separate the child version from the adult version. The child dies at around 13, and there remains only some random dumb adult leech whose mistakes you can laugh at.

>Google is "pausing" all work and investments in Allo — the standalone chat service announced with great fanfare in 2016 — and moving the entire Allo team over to Android Messages, the company's current default SMS app for Android devices.
Kinda unrelated, but apparently Allo is being abandoned as the team will now focus on RCS for Google's SMS app. So I believe it would be better if you switch to something else, like Telegram or WhatsApp.
which adblocker do you use? 

**EDIT:** Anyway, I never had a problem with uBlock Origin on Firefox for Android.

In apps, these things are annoying to me. I do not nee everything to move when I press search or open a new tab.  

Some staticness is nice.

as someone from the Middle East, I've always looked up to European & American "freedoms". You had hope that your country will one day allow you express your thoughts, be it in the form of expressing your dissenting opinion against a neighboring government, having all types of jokes on TV, criticism of ideologies, and being less restrictive in both social media and shows.

The way that Europe has been handling some of those issues is disheartening, and it seems to me that it is all in decline. If Europe cannot afford people complete nom-violent Freedom of Speech, then I do not have hope that my country (or any neighboring one) ever would.
Sadly, Snapchat still wins in my friends circle. Instagram's filters & effects may be much worse, but the interface is much better especially with Snapchat's latest update.  

A lot of them still use Instagram Stories though.
I don't understand why apps (without accessibility) service are getting killed. I have a clipboard manager that is supposed to monitor everything, but despite flagging it to ignore system optimization it gets killed after a while.

People want to charge wirelessly (though I doubt many do) and it is great for marketing. "WIRELESS CHARGING" in all caps in an ad or on the box will probably catch eyes.

I am no UI designer, but I have been an Android user for a long time and I am generally just interested in design.  

These Material GuideLines & adaptive icons are even ignored by some of Google's own apps. Your app won't be removed & you won't get a trike if you do not follow them. Apps do not **have** to support being adaptive, but all the guidelines are good to create a pleasing design instead of usually-shitty independent designs.  Also I heard that Google will modify Material Design this year.

PS: Please don't do [this type](http://www.klaasnotfound.com/assets/content/material_00.png) of icons because it is very basic and (subjectively) ugly.

So you think everyone agreeing with this has a significant mental or physical issue related to genetics? 

The concept of people with significant genetic defects not breeding isn't bad, the "how" is the issue. We aren't talking about ugly, wrong-race, wrong-ideology, or even violent people being prevented from breeding.  

We are talking about preventing the breeding of people who would almost certainly produce someone with a significant handycap that will alter the offspring's life significantly to the worse.

Meanwhile Android added grouping and a bunch of other features. I do wish that Google adds a bit of space between each notification though.

Since they have instanced most missions and planets (locations), added more planets & missions, and made almost everything solo-able, you come across very few people. It will feel more like an RPG than an MMORPG (yes even more than before).

The tabs, the [search bar](https://i.imgur.com/vhjcEzc.png), or both? 

The large tabs toggle is called "touch UI", so I think they're oversized to make it more comfortable for those using a finger instead of a stylus or a cursor.  

The search bar is better now (in my opinion) because it does [not extend all the way + link titles are above the link instead to the side](https://i.imgur.com/uetvjOI.jpg), but the drop shadow effect is too intense.

That same logic can be used on Russia & Putin.  

Are you saying Putin bribed 46,602,075 people to vote for him? The majority of Russian clearly want Putin.
So the declassified report says experts looked at the videos to see whether symptoms of the victims represented those of Sarin gas exposure? That's "declassified"?  

Correct me if I misunderstood.
I've done this to multiple laptops without issues. It's probably safer than buying an after market charger anyway. 

So first have them take a look. The person working there will inform you whether the issue is with the changing port or the charger head itself. 

If the port is the issue, they'll offer to fix it for a fee. The price would be slightly high so you should be able to haggle off a couple of KDs. 

Ensure that you watch them as they open it up & **replace** the port instead of doing a half-assed fix. 

There's a good shop that I've dealt with twice before (replacing hard disks and fixing a laptopvs keyboard) but I'm not sure if they fix chargers. I forgot the name, though I do remember its location on Bin-Khaldon street in Hawali
The Windows store has the least reliable apps I have ever tried. Even Skype used to stop working & I would have to reinstall it every time I boot. Lots of apps worked like trash as well.  

I don't understand how some people are using Windows10 versions that only allow downloads from the crapstore.  

I'm talking about Windows 10 Desktop, not mobile.
So should I switch my P10 Pro's charger for quicker changing?

I actually never personally experienced a loose charger, but the laptop's port is loose.  

In that case, go to Hawali's Bin Khaldon Street and have one of the small shops there replace it. Just make sure they replace it and not pin it with a ascrew or something.

My parents hite up with such things every day. It's so annoying that I muted their numbers and I only look at their messages once or twice a week.

>Russian Trolls Denied Syrian Gas Attack—Before It Happened 

this title makes it sound like a breakthrough investigation revealed that Russia paid "trolls" (not what the word means though) on social media websites to deny that the chemical attack occured, shortly before the chemical attack was publicly revealed to have taken place.  

But the article actually says that about 1 month ago, Russia officially stated that they had intelligence regarding a chemical attack that will be orchestrated by rebels or Islamists to blame Assad, and that Russia doesn't know if the attack is staged or a real one. After that official statement, the usual pro-Assad/anti-USA/anti-intervention people (Syrians & Westerners) began to talk about it on social media.

Emails, calls, and WhatsApp. All other notifications aren't blocked but are muted. All social media are killed in the background for me & their notifications are off.  

But SMS (or WhatsApp) & phone calls are the main reason one needs a mute button.
In my country (Kuwait, Middle East) it makes no difference. I'd say it's split about 50/50 but with an edge for iPhones. 

Everyone uses WhatsApp for communication, even govt agencies and banks use WhatsApp for support and such requests.

I agree with you. what bothers me most with Google is that they use beta testing on the regular apps. I believe that they should implement beta versions like most devs do instead of testing all of their users.  

Google is not known for their uniformity anyway.
Pretty weird. Maybe prevent it from using data in the background?
eh Instagram is shit too, but at least the chats don't always dissappear and navigation isn't an abomination.

Latest OnePlus device. Software is fast, speakers are loud, 6GB ram, screen is ok. Camera is a bit "meh" but that's not something you're looking for.
I liked it when we used to do this here because a lot of people who don't exactly post their own layout.
Yup. The annoying thing about the "more from this developer" is that looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/7ttzQ2b.jpg), so to view all of their apps you press "more" which takes to the dev's [sorta promotional page](https://i.imgur.com/aeBYaFr.jpg) where you must [scroll down & press "more"](https://i.imgur.com/oXeZfP4.jpg) another time to finally see [dev's apps in a proper view](https://i.imgur.com/JOxHdIn.jpg) mode. 

This may seem a nitpicky, but oversized cards, wasted white space, and disorganized order makes navigation bad for someone who's very interested in UI design.
Despite Samsung's premium hardware, it has the worst flagship fingerprint scanner I've ever experienced. I usually get downvoted for saying this but I will say it again.

I would've gotten the P20 Plus, but since it's using Kirim 970 & Bluetooth 4.1, I am going to wait for the Mate. 

I wouldn't want to spend premium on last year's processor + Bluetooth 5 is much more power friendly while being able to reach longer distances as well as transfer data at more than twice the speed of Bluetooth 4. 

You never know, but they may even add better speakers to the Mate instead of the ok ones in the P20.

It's illegal for men & women to cover up their faces in Canada's Quebec if they're in a govt building or getting any service provided by the govt.  

So in Quebec, entering a public library, a police station, etc require your face to be visible no matter what your religion is. I heard it was temporarily suspended though
If you want to look for apps, the home page shows a lot of the apps shown on an app's page. At least they could limit it to 1 row of "apps related to this app".  

This shit gets [even worse when it comes to games](https://i.imgur.com/3osOq1J.jpg)
Wish they'd add an Italian dude. Maybe he'll ride a flying Spaghetti since the cat got screapped.
Just give up bro. Have you seen Iokath mission(s)? That is the most half-assed plot, missions, and dialogue I have experienced in SWTOR. I left the game right after finishing Iokath with 1 character.  

I am hoping for a new SWTOR RPG, but I am not holding my breath.     
It really sucks. Imagine working hard for your money then having to pay part of it. 

Seems pretty demoralizing to me.
The story was great, it is the only reason I used to sub. KOTFE put me off, KOTFE 2 made me happier. But after the story Iokath made me realize how little they care about story anymore. So since Iokath, I have not entered the game. From time to time, i check this sub in hopes of proper story quests.
It takes a bit of time gettind used to it but it's worth readjusting your muscle memory :)
P10 was a lot better than my P9, as my P9 is still on Android6 whereas my P20 has been on Android8 for a month. If they follow that trend (especially that P20 is supposed to have Treble) then I dare say it is very likely.  

I am optimistic.
Attacking someone's affiliation instead of argument or claim is a personal attack
Yeah. Good thing Obama only chose to "free" Libya & Syria.

Just compare the app page on the [App Store] (https://i.imgur.com/AjzDSyy_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium) & [Play Store](https://i.imgur.com/NE3AxeA_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium).  

The PlayStore basically spams ads for apps everywhere it can, and the spacing is too big or space gets wasted on useless info in the app page, thus making viewing or navigating the page or using its elements bothersome. Is there a way to opt out of these suggestions? The apps promotions on PlayStore's home page is enough.  

While I'm at it, I think the "Play" part of Google's apps (Play Music, Play Books, etc.) should be changed to "Google" or "Android".
I've been bothered by this for a while, but today they showed me a "suggested apps" after updating Snapchat and kinda forced me to post this.

Change the laggy stock launcher to [Evie Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=is.shortcut). It's the simplest (yet sleakest) non-complex launcher. I would highly recommend you start with this, then switch to **Action Launcher** or **Nova Launcher** if you feel like you need more control. Also search the App Store for icon packs that you like. This will allow you to change apps icons in launchers.  

[Change your default ringtone](https://i.imgur.com/mlRR3Nx.jpg) by typing "ringtone" in the settings search box.  

Disable the stock Huawei Email app, and download each email's native app. For example: [Microsoft Outlook](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.outlook) for @live/@Hotmail/@Outlook accounts, [Gmail](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm) for @Gmail accounts, [Yahoo Mail](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.mail) for @Yahoo accounts. But if you're serious about managing Office365 emails, pay for the expensive [Nine Mail](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ninefolders.hd3) app. It makes life so much easier when you have multiple accounts, meetings, events, follow-ups, etc.  

#Optional:  
Change animation speed by finding the [build number](https://i.imgur.com/Hs4geKI.png) in your device settings. Tap it multiple times until you're a developer, then change the [animation scale to 0.5](https://i.imgur.com/G6UfKIA.jpg) if you want faster animations. Makes a noticeable difference after you restart the device.  

Change the file manager to [Solid Explorer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.solidexplorer2) or any other file-managing app you like.  

Change the SMS app to [Android Messages](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging) or [Textra](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.textra).  

Switch to either [Firefox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox) or [Samsung Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.app.sbrowser) and download an ad blocker (you can't do that in Chrome).  

[Universal Copy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.camel.corp.universalcopy) to copy text from apps that don't allow it. 

#General Tips: 
Long-pressing an app's icon in the "recent apps" menu takes you to their settings page. 

Include apps in the "Ignore Battery Optimization" list (search settings) to stop them from being killed in the background. This way you'll keep receiving notifications from the apps.  

Bookmark folders you use often for easy access. 

Turn off the camera shutter sound if you're the sneaky type. 

Accessibility Service is very useful for automating or adding extra functions to your device, but it is a little tasking on the processor. That's why some apps only use it when the app needs to do its thing, but other apps are constantly using it which will reduce battery life and may cause some lag. I personally wouldn't use an app that always runs in the background and requires accessibility.  

You can use custom fonts, but that needs a bit of work
It's not even a half baked OS. It is more like an undone launcher
Your mum seems like a cunt.
If you liked QuickPic, then Simple Gallery is the right replacement. Although it is too bad that it doesn't have search functionality.
Better than my Surface book anyway

I hope so. I really want to like them, but reviews about laggy software (even though its basically stock) are also problematic.
Advanced search still exists, what I am talking about is under the "time range", as now can no longer choose which exact dates to search from. Now you can only select pre-set ranges on mobile.

I'm a Cancer main, because I don't like shooters. I never did like such games. I RPGs, games like Infamous, spiderman, Star Wars, Witcher, Skyrim, etc.  

Do I hold left click? Yup. Does my lazer follow u while I giddily stare without effort? Yup. Is it irritating my enemy? YUP! And I love it this way.  

I suck at aiming in all games, and this game has heroes that do not require good aim (Monkey, Nazi, Torbette, JihadAussie, GrimReaper, etc.) so I like this game and play it.
My Samsung Chromebook pro is used only for YouTube, Netflix, torrenting, and social media im general. It's very light and fast + I dare say the track pad is about on par with Apple's trackpads. 

I rarely use touchscreen, but it helps sometimes for scrolling & such tasks.

Underwhelming. I expected something more from LG after all the talk of the new CEO.

Have you tried searching settings for the option to control the function of long-pressing recents or back buttons?
So Bluetooth 5.0 is a software update and not hardware?
I've had it about a year ago, but then it disappeared.
lol
I actually agree. It's not like TouchWiz on the S4 (where a custom rom was a must-have), nor as it was on the S6/S7 where a custom rom would make a great difference in speed.
>When GUIs first came out everything was flat basic colours, sharp and boxy 

Can you show me old examples of this?
As someone with a Chromebook, this sounds very exciting. I hope that they deviate a bit from "light gray text on white background" and use some separators. 

I just feel like it looks like unfinished UI.
Oppo sounds like a nice startup
I have been meaning to ask since yesterday. Fate.
maybe your device is set to open the context menu, so if you could disable this in settings I think it will work.
I am on stable. You just long-press the back button and it shows the that menu displaying the websites you visited in that tab
Yup. Life saver
Flamingo is the best 3rd party Twitter app, but Twitter not providing developers with APIs for polls and such really hinders the experience. 

The search function sucks on Flamingo though.

Does it "negate" the camera bump or is the cover not thick enough?
Being left handed is a sign from god that you'll end up in hell.
It's so fucking stupid. My university forces us to change the password every 3 months, so I just write my name + number of password change.  

If it gets hacked or whatever IT will fix it for me since they implemented this rule in the first place.
Nice. I once got the Revan mask for 100k. Best deal.
Recently they removed the "custom range" of dates in the "Advanced Search" from the mobile view. Can you check if this new design has it?
>prediction engine is already above the competition 

There's no way at all that this app beats SwiftKey or GBaord in predictions. That was 1 of the main reasons I left this app.  

EDIT: After trying it again, I say that it has improved but Gboard & Swiftkey are still better.
I really don't think anyone should be buying Chrooma, even though I miss the top bar text editing functions. The keyboard app is a very sensitive app & the way this app has been should discourage everyone from trusting it.  

During the last months of using Chrooma Keyboard, the clipboard went crazy with showing the same single copied text in all clipboard cards. The app did get updates but bugs like this were never addressed.  

[The dev has shady practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/6ls2yh/chrooma_keyboard_newest_update_is_suspicious/). I (and 2 others I spoke to) emailed the dev before regarding security concerns and we never got a reply. Even developers of popular apps like Nova & action launcher reply to emails. 

EDIT: [Just check the latest reviews and it becomes clear that the dev extremely values making money from the app over user experience. ](https://i.imgur.com/Z2u6kix.jpg)
My high school friend was taking a Maths final, and 5 mins into the test he fell off the chair amd fainted. Paramedics were called & he was later taken to the headmaster's office for about 20 mins then let out.  

I asked him if he's okay and he said "I was definitely going to fail, man. I needed to do something". He did get to repeat the test (and failed)… my point is that it doesn't always fail
I think it is really bad. Having people pay for medical service is one thing, but having people pay a portion of their own money… 

At least have a certain range that is taxable.

You can set selected area to transparent so that a 100% similar background color is transparent over other colors in the drawing.
Really? It's a better alternative to the stock MS Paint?

Well I am a Muslim from the Middle East, but keep your projections to yourself. 

The troops withdrawal from Iraq was signed by George Bush in 2008, and the withdrawal began by the was agreed upon with Bush.  

In 2009 Obama added over 15 thousand troops to Afghanistan. The withdrawal from Afghanistan only began in 2015, but only around 20K were withdrawn and 10K remain.

The work around is this: 

Type the text as u always do, but place it on a plain white background. 

Then choose the image selector thingy and select the area where the text is placed (make sure you don't select anything besides plain white background and the text) 

Now set selection as transparent and rotate the image.
I remember being taught by our Islamic Studies teachers that making mosques artistic & beautiful is haram because it will take people's minds off of worship and God, instead they'll be mesmerized or distracted by designs. 

**EDIT:** Ok, i checked my 10th grade Islamic Studies book and it says that it is "Makrooh" but Haram if it reaches a level of over-lavishness. 

**EDIT 2:** Oh yeah, down vote me for this COMMON scholarly opinion & debate me as if I'm the one who came to this conclusion.

Alright
they could just the top playstore bar still exists. It didn't get filled with whote space, the whole area got removed. Personally I find it useless, IDK.
The most annoying thing is the gallery app & slow animations… Notifications suck a lot too. Everything you do feels slower, partly due to the slow animations and also due to the fact that (prior to ios11) the iPhone quickdettings were very lacking.
it's neat. They ought to reorganize somethings (not showing in your screenshot) like share button, contact dev, etc.
At least we can torrent without fear
I saw the bodies. The collision didn't look bad by just look at the buses, but bodies and heads were bloodied and everyone basically was dead. 

Very sad sight.
kinda big wall of text
A close friend of mine from high school has been living there for 10 years and he thinks he will never return.  

He likes the job he got after studying 3 years in the USA & says he feels "unrestricted by people's expectations".
Any idea where to find the APK?
I hope that they reduce clutter of the app picture. It is basically useless. 

But that isn't a big issue, the real waste of space is the [rows of ads for apps](https://i.imgur.com/yZ2SOPD.jpg) and the oversized yet unclear "see more from this developers sign.
Youtube app that exact same top bar. It's horrible. I'd rather have a black or a white status bar than light gray.
light gray status bar is disgusting
I wouldn't mind, but the shipping costs (if sellers are outside of Kuwait) would probably cost more than the shirt itself.

Neat. What phone do u currently use?
Ok so I came across this video and it seems (to me) that the S9+ can be better than the P20Pro even in stills.  

[What do you think?](https://youtu.be/DborQY7z4kI) 

DXO said Huawei P20Pro "skipped a gen" with its camera, but it seems to me that it almost kept up with the S9+
Don't you lose access to Snapchat, Netflix, etc when you root?
http://boards.4chan.org/g/thread/65350531/chocolate-chocolate-chocolate-chocolate-chocolate 

here you go bb
Just marginally better than the S9 in stills (and I think better stabilization in 1080p video recording?)
Just a side comment, but if you're someone who enjoys mechanical keyboards you're never gonna like typing on a screen.
There's something effy. Google Maps on Huawei P10+ works well. 

Eh, I canceled my P20Pro anyway. 

The 4000mAh battery made me somewhat willing to look beyond the camera bump + notch + no headphone jack, but having last year's processor+Bluetooth 4 (instead of 5)+ the lag in the video has convinced me to look elsewhere.
Screw that.
in the YouTube app, a link to a YouTube video in the description of a video opens in a shitty webview instead of playing in the app.
True but they both suck
So that is how u do it. Cool.  

But I think what he means is the screen going black when he switches the Window from SWTOR to browser or anything else.

15 seconds after each spawn I kept getting 1-shotted by some weird tiny ships.
Yup. ESO is a really great replacement for me. Rewards are better, crafting is more interesting, designs and armors are better as well. The UI needs a bit of work but it also officially supports "add-ons" (mods) which fixes a lot of issues and adds decent amount of customization.
Telegram X has the best animations of any app I've used
I like sponsoring a lot more than regular ads. 

First most of what I have seen is that the sponsored products are related to the Channels or videos content.
Oh that's tempting. Are the sales on crowns only or items as well?
They have sales each month? Neat. Any idea how cheap things get?
I can whine about shitty flat design (whose colors just happen to be the same as Apple's) as much as I want. And you can be content with whatever you want or whine about whiners whining.

Google got tired of some people calling Android "Apple copycat", so they just went all in. 

That said, I like the circles around as they make it clear that these are buttons.
I've been bothered by this for a while, but today they showed me a "suggested apps" after updating Snapchat and kinda forced me to post this. The PlayStore basically spams ads for apps everywhere it can, and the spacing is too big or space gets wasted on useless info in the app page, thus making viewing or navigating the page or using its elements bothersome. Is there a way to opt out of these suggestions? The home screen is enough.


Just compare Snapchat on the [App Store](https://i.imgur.com/AjzDSyy_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium) & [Play Store](https://i.imgur.com/NE3AxeA_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium). 


While I'm at it, the "Play" name from Google's apps should be changed to "Google" or "Android".
I see. Thanks a bunch
for me it started zooming into videos ti fill the sides, thus hiding the botton content of videos
What?
It is so damn annoying. Somebody message 1 of the devs! 
Never had an issue. Perhaps remove TX from the battery monitor list? 
True. I was gonna mention them but I was jot too sure. 
Sounds like typical media. As soon as any story breaks out, you will get the same headlines except the wording will be different. Then you are hammered with all talk news shows reiterating the same points.  

This may seem more eerie because they're using the same exact words instead of same content but different wording.
But Gboard was updated about a year ago, and since then the recording is better than on any other keyboard.  

It is smoother, hands-free friendly, and detects the langauge based on the keyboard current language. 

[Here is a YouTube demonstration](https://youtu.be/u-MhGY7ZlPI) 
I see. Thanks a lot for the detailed reply.  I guess I'll look up a Roccat with such a sensor. 

One last q, does the track pad make a diff or is it negligible?
Nice carpal tunnel in the making 
If you don't mind annoyingly very low small navigation buttons, a not so bright screen, a vibration that registers on the Richter scale, sure.  

Some were complaining about bootloops or something after updating to a new Android version though. I sold it quite a while ago and never looked back.
The only thing that keeps bringing me back to Gboard is the voice to text. 
Now I have to decide between two evils: An edge screen or no headphone jack…
The Huawei P9 also had a shitty GPS issue. That said, my P10+ has a normal GPS ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Recents app is even better on Huawei's devices. You can lock apps, you switch top & bottom split screen view, you have a "close all" option. The main issue is that notifications disappear from the lockscreen once u unlock. It is VERY annoying.
I need the high volume to listen lecutres and speeches, so (to a degree) audio quality is not important to me.  

Thanks a lot for the information btw.
>The notification still disappear after unlocking.  

This kind of sucks. Do you have the P10+? if so, could you compare the speakers loudness & screen darkness?  

My phone sometimes gets noticeably hot when I multitask, so it's not just gaming that causes overheating on the P10+. Is it the same with you?
it's nice to see another connoisseur in the wild.

It sure as hell isn't.  

It's like the worst type of comedy was mixed with crime-drama. Even when the cartel wants to kill the twins, he talks the "dumb" mafia boss slowly from killing them "oh but they have a poor mama waiting for them" to cutting off their limbs, then he insists "but their mama! she's gonna be so sad!" then he goes down to only breaking their legs. 

The show was so cheesey and I do not see the appeal at all. Whomever says this was not meant to be comedic (but clearly failed) must be blind or delusional. 
I've tried to give it a shot, but till episode 4 of season 1 the whole thing is boring as hell. Not even funny.

But for some reason, many apps on Chromebooks don't show a large screen view even though they work on tablets. That affects Telegram, Reddit Sync, and a bunch of others.

Force Unleashed 2 story was so shitty. It felt like they made the game play and character designs, then added a story. 

It dstroyed the most beautiful thing about the original Force Unleashed. 
I'm too lazy to read the whole story, I just want to know if it's the people in the vid who kidnapped him or someone else. 
I think they are going on openning a new branch too
I see. I think it's not a big difference especially since those screens are larger than that of phones. 

Also Chromebooks are kind of that way, except the notifications are accessed by pressing a button 
My cousin was studying in the UK and got stabbed in the face and had his wallet stolen. He said he was attacked by a white guy and 2 black guys, all looked young. 

But we assume that he wasn't attacked because of his nationality. Generally I don't **feel** like Britain (or at least British cities l that I've been to) are safe, as my father and his friend got mugged in London. 
What's the difference between this and having widgets + icons on desktop like you can do now?
You need to work on your reading comprehension.  

We are talking about how Launchers will work with the ChromeOS navbar, which is different than that of AndroidOS navbar.
I did want that. I want it to work but we would retain the bottom bar
Why? Launchers will work just like they do on Android, except the navbar won't be like he Android navbar, it'll remain the same as the one currently in Chromebooks (which has icons for open applications & other shortcuts).  

3rd party launchers already work on Chromebooks, it's just that pressing "Home" icon takes you to the stock launcher that doesn't allow you to place anything on the desktop, which means widgets won't work on Chromebooks. 
Please support launchers and 3rd party keyboards
Amazon really should fix their main app. It's slow and the UI sucks a lot.
Samsung allows you to change the navbar color… unless you're talking about per-app bases.
I've often seen people complaining about reception and LAG (even though its running near stock).

I understand their life is hard, but so is the life of many people who want to become Kuwaiti. We cannot simply make anyone without docs a Kuwaiti citizen because they face hardships. 

>You can prove that bedons were here even before the invasion, it’s all is documented in files, each family is known and there is counts of how many people were in a house before. Not all participated in the invasion though, some fled

I'll reiterate what I said in my previous comment "but for start, what proves that a Bedoon isn't an Arab who has been living in Kuwait for a long time? Almost nothing." By that, I did not mean Bedoon who have been in Kuwait before the invasion, I'm talking about those who moved to Kuwait decades ago, some 40 years ago!  

I edited my previous comment so you may have not seen this: "Just recently, [over 4000 Bedoons have revealed that they are actually Saudi, while about 2000 more revealed that they are from nearby Arab states and even Iran](http://mobile.alweeam.com.sa/312775/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%AA-4600-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A3%D8%B8%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A7-%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%B3%D9%81%D8%B1/). They have shown their real passports after many years of trying to get a Kuwaiti citizenship."  

Bedon are **basically** 3 types, originally Nomads who were living within Kuwait decades ago but didn't register as Kuwaitis but now want to, Saudis & Iraqis who came to Kuwait in the 1970s to serve in Kuwait's police and army because at that time it provided them benefits (which about 2 decades later got canceled because of security risks & an assassination attempt against the emir), and offsprings of Kuwaiti women who married bedoon men.  

Its also rumored thatthere are even Syrians getting rid of their passports trying to become Kuwaiti. If we accept all those people, why won't we also give citizenship to Egyptians who have been in Kuwait for decades & their kids. That's many people atop of the Bedoon.  

I believe this discussion has ended, because you feel compassionate about their hard situation and believe they should be given citizenship despite the drain on the public facilities it'll cause. But I think helping those people would cause too much of a drain, as I believe more foreigners will flood Kuwait in hopes of getting the same deal when they throw their documents away.  

But I am also compassionate to their situation, we try to employ Bedoon instead of expats at our companies (and give them a bit higher wages than average expat). I'm not heartless.
No, but for start what proves that a bedon isn't an Arab who has been living in Kuwait for a long while? Almost nothing. 

But the Bedon who did stay in Kuwait & defended it during the invasion showed that they truly love Kuwait and most likely defending their homeland, otherwise why stay when the prospects of freeing Kuwait were near non-existent? 

Kuwait cannot & should not just hand out citizenships to anyone who lives in it for a long time, that would result in more than double the population getting citizenship. That's just by judging how many expats are here now, so how many will come if such a policy was implemented? 

Just recently, [over 4000 bedons have revealed that they are actually Saudi, while about 2 thousand more from nearby Arab states and even Iran](http://mobile.alweeam.com.sa/312775/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%AA-4600-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A3%D8%B8%D9%87%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%A7-%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%B3%D9%81%D8%B1/). They have shown their real passports after years of trying to get a Kuwaiti citizenship.
One of the arguments for the Bedons is that some have served Kuwait during the Iraqi invasion, and they know them by name. Those people should be given citizenship because you know they're faithful people who didn't come to Kuwait to leech. It's pure ungratefulness not to do that.   

I agree that currently Bedons arent getting special treatment, but a big step towards that has been made by allowing them to join the army officially. 

I believe that going down that path will lead Kuwait to **eventually** (a decade? 2 decades?) hand out citizenships as Western countries do, and that is something I'm very much against.
>you’re against bedons 

Against them doing what? I am for citizens. 

>because they complain about there lives? 

I complain about life almost everyday. I am against the government paying for non-citizens or giving them special treatment just because.
Im against all work the govt does that is not for the citizen, especially when that govt is saying that things are getting worse & "the pockets of Kuwaitis have to be touched".
Keep in mind that the title/description is buggy there
Expats should be mandated to have a PROPER health insurance if they want to come.
Having a Church in Saudi would mean you would get extra bell rings AND a man shouting.
I'd have fun with them, but anyone who takes it seriously would be a fool.

>asked the lady all over again what it is and how it is spelled, but she looked annoyed and left her alone. 

Employee of the month. What a cunt.
Spiral/round stairs suck. Form over function
they aren't a single monolithic entity. Kuwait's welfare is attractive to many nationals, especially other Arabs. 

They live here, make noise, tell their sad stories, and since our elected officials do nothing besides get rich they see that granting them citizenship will mean more voters for them + make it seem like they are doing something.
I didn't know others offered. Tell me more?

Never spoke with a guy who would turn down nudes. 

**EDIT:** From girls.

Never heard of it. Does it have Western songs as well or is it Arab exclusive?
How bout they give it a proper list view instead of the stacked cards that expand depending on the text inside which ruins navigation?
Does this mean that Samsung-themed emojis would appear like stock in apps using EmojiCompat?

>Did they hire this guy from TMZ or something?﻿
She was humiliated as well
I keep getting "No Devices Found" whenever I run the .exe  

Any help?
I assure you she doesn't even know how to bookmark
not when she has found something on her PC and wants to send it to us via WhatsApp!
except, y'know, he's black and smooth. The exact opposite of the moon.
Grandma is also under no obligation to not take a photo of her screen when she's just sharing it with her friends.  

She doesn't have to be appealing to the masses.
If it's an app then it's been on every device I've had. I doubt it though. Perhaps by some miracle, a message to the devs would bring attention to this.
what's the icon pack?
I laughed so hard
Probably because the devs are shit. That issue has exited for years and it happened on my Samsung, Xiaomi, HTC, Huawei, and One Plus Android devices.  

Very, very annoying. The only way around it is to disable the sensor (or find a way to prevent WhatsApp from utilizing that sensor) to prevent that stupid "feature".
>Would a casual phone user actually notice a difference between this and say the latest flagships from Samsung or LG?

only when it comes to the camera.  

>I understand there are differences, but it seems to me that the top end devices have specifications that arent really utilised by most users (e.g amazing cameras to be used for things like snapchat).  

But on Android, the pics will look like shit because Snapchat sucks.
Oh good. Grenades blowing about are no prob as long as they're between gangs. Phew.
There was a Samsung device (midrange) on show. It's screen had burn-in, and I asked the employee there if I should worry about it when purchasing the device and he said "There's nothing wrong with it, it's how the screen is supposed to look like".  

Needless to say that I have not asked him anything else.
It's annoying that the dev cannot fix the bug where the folder says empty, but opening it shows the files in it. Sometimes it works the other way around.  

Also a minor thing, but I hate how I cannot turn off seconds from the files creation time stamp.
the diff is quite noticeable if you ask me
I switched from G Drive to One Drive. There are drawbacks, but generally I am pleased.
Text selection is horrible too
It works great. Thanks! Would love a more material design though
>Not sure where you got this bullshit from  

Well if your perception is shit, then you wouldn't notice.  

>I've used HTC m8, one m8, nexus 6p,samsung s6, s8+ and currently on s9+.  

HTC One M8 has no fingerprint scanner. Also lot of people don't notice the difference between setting animations to 0.5s and 0.75s, but people who really care about animations do. That's the same for me when it comes to fingerprint scanners.  

I have not tried the S9, so I cannot rate how well its scanner works. But even when **Mr. Mobile** was reviewing the S9, he said he really liked how they fixed the fingerprint scanner's positioning *and detection*. That's a major tech reviewer noting the issue with previous Samsung scanners.  

I grant that it is possible for you to have experienced no issues with it, but [this reviewer from the Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15333752/walt-mossberg-review-samsung-galaxy-s8) has the same bad experience with his S8 that I've had with the S7, A5 (2017), and S8.  

Verge Quote:  
>The fingerprint sensor has been moved to a high, awkward position on the rear of the phone, and I found that it often failed to recognize either of my two index fingers. Even enrolling the fingers was slow and jerky.
>Insert is used in a lot of programs and some games utilize this as well  

What games?
I've tried multiple fingers on it because I thought of the same thing. It only worked on the finger that I had registered with the sensor, and had my brother try his fingers too.  

The iPhone sensor is also more reliable than that of Samsung, and I never got a "please swipe the fingerprint sensor" on any of those devices
Is this something from robot chicken? I wanna see the video version
The new design, if it doesn't get fixed, will make all Android devices look like a copy of iOS.  

I'm hoping Samsung sticks to its own design, because it looks much better. Ironic that Samsung used to have the worst UI and now they may have the best
Samsung's regular finger print scanner are already a little worse than Huawei's/OnePlus and a few others.  

Imagine how bad a screen fingerprint reader would be if they half ass it to meet a deadline.
I like your face
MIUI copied iOS though
I can't tell if you're serious or not
Well that is such a shit choice. Think it's just beta or the direction Google's heading?
Is it because they haven't updated or is it something to do with the API?
I've had the shitty clock location on my Xiaomi Mi5 for a month before it got so annoying that I finally had enough and sold it (the bootloader unlocker didn't work).  

I never got used to it. Don't change what's not broken.
How so?
What? Even here in Kuwait, the first ethnicity to come to mind when you see a white person is Syrian/Lebanese.
It is broken because of greedy people who want cheap labor and bleeding heart idiots who think "let everyone come because it is the nice thing to do, I am a good person and so morally Superior than you are with my high compassion". And you think I am a Chauvinist beause I think people who break the law and do as they please because they simply think "this is not good enough for me" should not get ahead of other people who get vetted and are willing to wait like decent folk?  

It seems that the only one here lacking in intillect is you, and you filled your brain with childhood concepts of good and bad. Loosen the hijab and get more blood flowing to your head.
Power Point for Android is shit. Google Slides is better.
I would use Boost, but switching between accounts & loading subreddits/Messages/Comments is slow compared to sync.
I'm really surprised by how well it is made, it is simple and feels very light. But there are issues that I noticed:  

_No audio controls.  
_Font (time, options) are a little hard to read.  
_Play again button is too small. Have a box or something around it.  
_Hard to see some of the damaging elements like the Lazer shooting from the spaceship in the middle of the screen.  

I think that if you add unlockable themes for the character, map, sound effects (like Sonic, Mario, Terminator, etc.) it would make people more inclined to play the game & deliver a higher sense of accomplishment
Muslims can be white, and many are especially Syrians/Lebanese.
So "if my life circumstances are bad I can break the law, by skipping the line ahead of people who may be at the same or worse conditions as I am, because MLK or something"?  

>Compassion > some stupid law  

Then you agree that I said, it is not justice but it is compassion.  

How would you feel if you were still waiting to enter the US while seeing people, some with better & some with worse conditions as you, skipping the line?
Definitely not 20.
And here I was angry you posted an obvious 24
If it is true, he will be Kuwait's Internet Messiah.
The west is weird with it's banning of this word. I remember playing COD when I was younger, some American guy says "shut your face, nigga" and I say "no, you shut up nigga" and the rest of the team says "Oooooo he said the N word".  

I may have sounded like a "white boy" (I'm actually from the Middle East) that called a black guy "nigga" right after he called me "nigga", and that was something so horrible to a group of people who constantly talk about raping moms.
You think it is "justice" to give people who broke the law of the land a reward?  

It may be compassionate, but I fail to see how it is "just".
it's just a funny-ish comic if h ask me
Kuwait's is barely a democracy. Parliament is corrupt, and whenever MPs try to interrogate a minister or a bunch if them, the parliament is dissolved by the govt. The only democratic thing about it is that if you get elected, you can help people who voted for you get things they do not deserve.
It depends. Nova can be too overwhelming for the average user, so I recommend Evie.

Same as my grandma. She simply cannot accept anyone (even the maid) touching the food.
Since Skype has become utter shite in the past few years, Google should allow more than 1 on 1 calling.  

It'll be a great replacement for Skype. Make Video Calls great again!

I hate the new flattish design Google is following. Things don't look like papers anymore :(
Maybe no difference when it comes to pictures, but Google is far superior when searching for anything.

Another issue is censorship. Bing often prevents me from accessing "18+", vulgar, or politically sensitive content because it is locked in my region (middle east). It is very very annoying to have "safe search" forced on me.
It means that they're least likely group of expats to commit crime… 

At least that's how I took it.
It sucks a bit, though. Especially that her voice is robotic and it uses Bing search engine.
This may sound stupid, but are you sure that you've downloaded Google Launcher? 

If so, try downloading another launcher such as [Evie](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=is.shortcut).
The real question is why do they not save navigation or places.  

Dude, I have 100GB free on my phone. When I'm in Germany, I wanna dedicate the entire thing to maps.
I really would have wanted to specificy whenever a chat is encrypted with end to end encryption, as not having the app on devices is very very inconvenient.
I've tried so many flagships from so many manufacturers, and the worst fingerprint scanner of them all was Samsung. 

From my experience, Huawei & OnePlus have the best.
It is?
All I wanted was signing in in more than 1 device, instead we got WhatsApp's shitty way of having a webpage dependent on your phone.
Pretty much. In my country, majority of citizens use iPhones but none uses iMessage.
Actually OLX seems to have the best interface of them all. After the horrible horrible experience I had in 4SALE, it was a blessing.
I've only ever played monopoly though
Do people in Kuwait generally know about it though?
Awesome global news
Before I sold my S8, I couldn't disable the Bixby button. Is that a native system option now?

EMUI (5.1 and above) is a really good skin, especially when you compare it to Xiaomi's mess. 
App's UI is better. I will miss it a lot if it goes away. 
The left image seems to have a little arrow on some quicksettings, whereas the right one doesn't. 

I'm sorry but I don't understand the difference? 

I'll miss the [bottom](https://i.imgur.com/Ymr7JnL.jpg) emoji… 


4 comments bashing the Quicksettings & notifications, but you haven't said what is bad about OxygenOS's quicksettings except for the fact that they've made their own one. 
But currently, aren't stuff that are called "AI" just programs following algorithms?  
seriously though, those moles are distracting
OP what does this mean when it comes to real life use? 
Thanks a lot for the detailed explanation. If the camera is much better then I will certainly consider it. 
So if I don't play games or use emulators, there's no reason to get 845 over 835?

>Inbuilt call recording

[ACR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.acr) has a better interface and sound quality as well as supports backing to a custom cloud storage.  

>Double-tap to unlock

That is in many devices (Pixel, OnePlus, LG, Sony, etc.) and I think it is hardware based. So it's likely that A1's hardware doesn't have the necessary hardware.  

>Screen off toggle on my quickball

True. There are 3rd party apps who can do a lot of it, but I assume in-built setting is more useful.  

>Swipe down on home screen to bring down the notification bar

That depends on the Launcher, and that can be done on some stock & 3rd party ([Action](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.actionlauncher.playstore), [Evie](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=is.shortcut), [LawnChair](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.deletescape.lawnchair.plah), [Nova](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher), etc.) launchers.  

>Copy OTP button from SMSs

Very nice. But the article claims you have to write them down or memorize them, when you can just copy them. The only thing MIUI messaging app makes better is that you don't have to select it in some messages.  

>Beta ROM!

Even the finished MIUI ROMs were behind non-MIUI ROMs, and it lacked some basic stock features. Sometimes Xiaomi ported stock features but implemented differently through their MIUI. Some didn't work so well.  
Hm maybe it's on Google's side? Anyway, great news. 
What about removing then re-adding you Google account or adding another account to see how fast it syncs? Connecting to another  network? 
I was gonna suggest that you make sure that you've toggled on all the side menu's calendars & that Google drive storage isn't full… 

Really that's all I can think of besides calling Google 
I have never had such a problem. IF you are using an app on Mac then I think you should use the web versions... also make sure that the Calendar app on your phone isnt killed in the background

It seems to me that you're the ignorant one here. Why are you so triggered about people criticizing her? Every person who has a little. bit of knowledge regarding phones knows that Windows OS was dying.  

If anything, I suspect that you are her from all these idiotic ramblings you're making against the majority who all know how stupid that decision was. 
It's either that or she's really fucking dumb… or there's something that is being omitted from the title of this article.  

But it doesn't take "experts" to realize that Windows phone was dying.  

Even before its death, it was clear that app's compatibility would be an issue. 

**EDIT:** I suppose that since it's supposed to be work only, you could easily text/call/search web using Windows phone. Maybe having a decent OS or support isn't important.  
Thanks I tested it, and so far it works!

If you dismiss a notification or have a chat's notifications muted, you still get the number of notifications on the app.  

Right now it just reads notifications from the system 
still no support for Outlook, Nine, WhatsApp, Messenger, etc. internal notifications.

Does it have to be PBT?

So can I get a job on that team? I too can contact Twitter support as a rep of the police to get accounts closed.
I hope crypto currencies die. They have become so expensive because of the damned miners
It's actually 600$ at the moment in Kuwait. If you buy it from major tech retailers or small shops, ofc. I believe carriers still have the original price.
2018 in my country:  
Pixel2 64GB is 900$  
GalaxyS8 64GB is 650$  

Google cannot compete with Samsung.


Slightly better design, better animations & gestures, and I **think** more features.  

They're both official apps. I have seen some people complain about notifications, but I've never had that issue. 
unfortunately speech recognition with Cortana is not as good as Google's

Can't wait till other devices have proper stylus support.
So its just a bump to make the phone feel better?

Huawei's doesn't work in some apps or parts of apps.  


Samsung's is the best I've had, as I've never had any issue with it. 
In 3 months after release, it'll lose about 30% of its price in my country.

I have been suffering with this, just as you are.  

But it isnt all bad. since those icon packs are in that list, you can use them to search for a specific icon when changing the icon of a specific app. That is better than having to navigate using a launcher's internal Icon picker which usually lists them all without the ability to search by name.
You cannot register with a number that doesn't belong to the few countries it is currently available in.
Only 1 Xperia seen being used in my country since 2013
Where do you think I found this subreddit from? lol I just got a KBD75 so it'll be abwhile before I get a new keyboard…
maybe once I am as good as you with such things lol  

I have been considering getting something like this since my pain started a while ago.
What's wrong with flannels?
As usual, Samsung apps beat Google's… maybe not the keyboard or AI though. Thanks again.
Thanks. I went but the guy there just told me to get steroid injections, but I want a more specialized opinion.
Since it works so fast & so well on any language, I assume it is like [Universal Copy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.camel.corp.universalcopy)  

It extracts text instead of identifying the shape then converting it to text.  

This probably means it doesn't work on images, unlike Google Now. Thanks for the replies.
>Once you take a screenshot you can extract the text

Wow. Does it work better than Google Now's implementation?  

Is it only for English text?
They do? What is "smart select"?
I spoke to the doctor and he said that the surgery could fix things but it's like a 40% chance. he even said that's it is possible for it to make it even worse
The only extra featured that I care about sre scrolling screenshot, vibration control, brightness slider in minimized quicksettings.
I see. Thank you for this.
I don't know what anything in this starter pack is 
Now translate this for me

Thanks a lot for the help. I'll try to get to one tomorrow. 
Thanks a lot for the input, but I have completely horrid experience with most doctors in public hospitals.
Well PBL course is completely related to PBL work regarding a random subject, and it is worth 6 credit (yes, crazy amount) and it has nothing to do with our specialty.  

Last semester, one of them was about logic gates and they refuse to teach you anything , thus you must "understand by your own research". The only reason we have an instructor for PBL is to grade our work. It is also the most expensive course (about 700KD) so I feel they just added it to milk us for money.
I was going to switch, but then I often have to use public keyboards and I realized it's not worth fucking up my muscle memory. 

BTW you can switch layouts on mobile keyboards now. 
I was thinking after seeing a bunch of posts here. How do you manage without the F & number rows/keys? 
Would you recommend a specific doctor? Just in case the clinic confirms that I have it.
Weird. Even ACK spammed 2 PBLs in every semester. It's so time-consuming and honestly it barely teaches us anything about our major. 

Makes so angry. 
Are you sure? How much would that cost? 
As everyone said, Giants Gaming. It's a bit annoying to create an account & they're just a bit expensive, but it's worth it. 

I go there almost every weekend 
That's really cool. Sending stuff is even more complicated than importing, idk if I could. 
Thanks a lot. This is really frustrates I REALLY have to use my hands for work and studying… 

Is it normal to just wake up with the condition? 
I believe self posts (not links) always go through that. 
thank you. That's what I wanted

What's the source of all those computer memes? 
>lmao since when does the US behead people  

lel XD

You need to focus less on using dumb emojis and more on reading comprehension. Do you know what the word "if" means? 

Well I'll help you, as you can't use emojis to find out.  

"If" is used to introduce a clause that shows 2 or more possibilities. 
>the palestinians do this all the time; check memri

>cool downvotes for telling the truth

>lmao 👹  

This is a bit of an extreme example, but if US soldiers behead captured enemy combatants, would it be OK because their enemies do that? 

There's a certain criteria expected of nations, which doesn't exist for terrorist group or their supporters. 
This is all great… except you ruined Bane. Totally sucks 
I didn't say he's totally bad. His policies are actually much more liberal than those of my country. 

But he literally said ["if Ivanka weren't my daughter, I would be dating her."](https://youtu.be/diMp241gAcw)

I just they'd make a non-curved edition… 
It makes much more sense than going to Account then subscriptions. 
The Red looks like it's glowing, really cool. Custom? 
I'm not gonna read your entire promotion-thesis of Samsung.  

>It's not like they had recent incidents of their phones exploding in their shops, or a massively widespread battery issue that affected or could affect every single phone  

By that logic, LG has no quality control issues because their phones aren't falling apart inside the stores. 
Lethal is the one that could burn down your house, the shitty is the one that wouldn't charge because it ran out. 

If the fix was possible just by wireless charging, the forums wouldn't be infested with similar complaints.  

>You should hide your kids.  

You should enhance your reading comprehension. 


Here u thought you got it as a novelty 
such a weird layout for the arrow keys and the bottom row 
Let's see your escape keycap 
How much does the case weigh? 
When is Samsung going to fix this?  

2 consecutive years with lethal & shitty batteries. 
I got the Huawei P10+, and I am still on Android 7.0
I don't know… but excluding Xiaomi's horrible rom, their midrange offerings are much better than Samsung's. 
They often release ads many months before their device is available, they sold "nerfed" flagships outside of Korea, shitty quality control, and messed up naming strategy. 

Good luck, especially that they're not even making their naming strategy better according to the report from a month ago. 
the UI though… 
I heard, it mixes results from several search engines.  

Does this mean it's possible to use ~~fuck~~ duck duck go with only search results from Google & Bing, with Google's prioritized?  

 
I mean it's annoying when you're used to SwiftKey or Swype, then you resort to a keyboard that is not on-par with any mainstream Android keyboard… 

So frustrating that you can't have launchers or 3rd party keyboards on Chromebooks though. 
well it turns out that WhatsApp's is 256
>best power management ™ 
hm what's up with the "bezels"? 
WhatsApp's limit is 250 people 
>I don't think Qnet or any other ISP have anything to do with the deployment of fiber, that's all on the MOC. 

I understand that. The issue is that they were promising this (even though they know it is false) as an advertisement get us to subscribe to their service. 

I'm I AlSalam & we have fiber optics, it's very nice & I never get any lag on Overwatch or any games on European servers. So glad.
>"Fibre cables to all Kuwaiti areas ‘within two years’" - 2013. What a fucking joke.  

They gotta milk all that embezzlement money! 

1.5 years ago, QualityNet promised that by the end of 2018, all of Kuwait will have FiberOptics lol. 


I like the pickup lines one as well
Can you link it? I had one that didn't work at all. 
It won't let me access the website lol I guess Non-US IP addresses are banned 
a it's really cool
more pics? 
What kind of websites? Can you give me an example? 
I dont understand how those specs would operate with any modern app or ROM...
I see. Well, I still think it is low enough to make it really annoying on Android.
But what year was It? 
2GB is really really annoying from my experience. Many apps would freeze & reload so often. 

Even iPhones use 3GB now. 
This is pretty exciting 
>Plus, I don't have an ugly wire just randomly dangling. 

Well that would mean you have an ugly wire connected to a charging pad on the table. 
According to [Iraqi news](https://www.iraqakhbar.com/744546), the woman's parents are from Morocco but she was born in Germany. 

That said, I've seen quite a few Brits and some black German rapper who joined ISIS. 
And if it's shipped? 
The most useless thing I can think of is wireless charging. 

It's slower & you cannot use your phone while it charges. The only advantage it has over wired is that you don't have to bother plugging in. 
Not their Android devices, I'm talking about the PS4 and other older devices like the music player 

Also I think moto is closer to stock than Sony
I think people in general just don't think of it. To my surprise, my father and most of my friends got the iPhone 7 or X without even knowing that it didn't have a 3.5 jack.  

But once they realized they could use the headphones in the box they didn't care much 
People seem to forget that Sony had some of the worst anti-consumer devices & software. 


Neat. Thanks 
is 7zip better than winrar? 
It has. Thank you very much for this. 
When I was in Frankfurt, the security with a big gun pointed it at me & shouted.

Could you summarize this? 
So is the issue adding your credit card to purchase via Chrome or Play Store, or is it the OnePlus website? 
I have a Samsung Chromebook Pro… help me. 
Thanks, just another reason to get the Exynos variant. 
So how do we know which ones which when buying?
From a user's review:

On 3rd party apps, it is beautiful 
Isn't the Google feed implemented into 3rd party launchers (Action, Nova, LawnChair, etc) using an undocumented API? 
Thanks a lot. I've been subbed for less than a day and service seems pretty good. 
Picture removed! Where can I see it? 
Could you explain to me how to turn off/on the TUN/TAP? I am new to all of this. 

I understand if you can't. 
Just turn the router on & off? 
Interesting… I'll look into it. Thanks 
First off I am glad that you are not having problems with it.  

Now everyone has been recommending AirVPN, but it seems too complex to use. I am looking into it. 
I dont know about how it is in the US, but so far in Europe and Middle East the terms of service absolve them any responsibility of keeping your data private or safe, they have no refunds, and often I cannot even connect AT ALL for many hours.  

Thank god I subbed through Google otherwise I would not have gotten my money back.
Tunnel Bear at the top? I haven't tried the others but I sure hope that they're better than Tunnel Bear, as it sucks so much. 
lol but realistically? 
Tunnel Bear is shit, I'm so disappointed that many popular tech reviewers have been recommending it.  

So ProtonMail doesn't make it to the list? 
I was just looking for a reliable VPN today. I tried Tunnel Bear, but the terms of service & the often non-working servers made the service near shit. 

Anyone had experience with this one? 
How much would that cost? 
I never change the stock clock app because of my paranoia. I feel like something will fuck up and not make my clock work of it isn't a system app
Use icon packs. I heard that the [LawnChair](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.deletescape.lawnchair.plah) is a good alternative for Pixel Launcher. 
All 3 are relatively failed apps. Is he a developer or the project manager?

they coud of easily made that symetrical and it woud look alot beter  

It's safe to say that people will know your age after reading that… or perhaps you're a troll, but I'm too lazy to look through your history. 
Same. Hated the lag so much I switched to an HTC 
That is really cool.
I am not sayin you can´t, I am just saying that you may want to give a better impression on r/Android than  copy of Flappy Bird. That is all up to you though. 
No, it's for downloading TerrariumTV videos and such. Sometimes files come corrupted too. 
I mean it's not too far fetched. I had it installed when it first released, but after a while I couldn't use it for what I wanted 
It's like having Allo on my phone. It's useless, I have no one to talk to on it. Although I enjoyed the user interface, stickers, and a few more things, I don't have it on my device because ZERO people I know use it. 
I for one am mostly satisfied with YouTube suggestions. 
Do you ever have a prob with ADM where the videos you download get choppy or parts of it is missing a couple of minutes or so? 
that app looks like it can be so good but the small user base makes it useless for me
Can I use it on Windows? 
Really? Flippy Tubes? 

That looks like the cheapest copy of Flappy Bird 
Thank you. I'll look into that as well. 
It looked sweet but the keycaps are different sizes
dont I have to assemble the kbd75? Where can I buy it?
Well I agree with OP. It does look better than Nova, but it feels clunky and sometimes even refreshes or redraws. 
Is there anyway you could play that game online?  

I know of no one IRL that has interest in it, but I really want to see what the fuss is all about. 
mechanical keyboards
I don't know if I'd call it a shithole, but the buildings there are very shitty (judging by Google. maps satellite view) 
>MEP Gerard Batten suggested that Mr Farage might be guilty of "attention seeking" 

This is hilarious. 
>Thanks to Google Play services App Preview Messaging, you can now call people that haven't installed or registered with Duo. It works like a normal Duo call, including Knock-Knock feature.   

>At the end of the call, users are prompted to install Duo 

This is really cool. For some reason, having duo installed (which I very rarely use) creates a duplicate of every name in my contact list. 
Thanks a lot. I'll give it a shot on my old phone. 
does it do auto-reinstallation for the apps, or will I have to install them as regular apks one by one
You can restore the app data on different phones, right? 
Have you tried backing up and restoring by yourself? I wanna know how reliable this is
I miss the class stories so much... 
compared to viber & Skype, it is not available on PC and is only linked to your phone number. You also cannot make group calls. That is a huge issue especially that it came late, yet it lacks features compared to the competition.
I switch about twice a year. I get shit from friends & family every now and then but by now it is expected of me
Without root, I need a way to back up APK's and their data to move them to a new phone. 
At least fix the share menu first… FFS 
lack of cross platform makes it not a viable choice to many, especially being bound to your phone number 
How well does this work with VR chat?
Linking to a rant blog that only shows 1 screen of the app isn't very informative… 

That said, snapchat's UI has always sucked (for me) and I can't wait for the day the app dies. 

**EDIT:** Thanks for fixing. 
Thanks. I'll go ahead and buy it 
of the keyboard & mouse? 
So one of the things Macron promised were reforming the EU. Can anyone tell me if that is being worked on? 
The water thing isn't true, but the rest is. Many people go to Bahrain from all round the Arab Gulf to get drunk and fornicate with whores for cheap. 
I'm actually surprised that this didn't happen earlier 
I can understand when it's a jump between versions, but usually I am satisfied with what I have and not interested in getting new features 
why would they even take him? 
There already is an Instagram Messenger, it's called Direct & you can find it on APK Mirror. It disables the in-app direct messages, so whenever you press the DM icon it takes you to the app. 
why does she sound like she's got something stuck in her throat? 
>Then don't buy it 

I have not even considered buying the Pixel Book because of the limited OS. But when the company that makes the OS is also making the hardware you might wanna make it an attractive offer, no? 

I have the Samsung Chromebook Pro, it's not very cheap but it's not expensive either. It does most of what I need well (mostly take notes in class) but stupid things like not being able to transfer files to a PC using a wire is plain dumb and something to be expected of Apple 
Pretty sure that they aimed to be more than just that when they decided to have Android apps run on Chromebooks. 

Google's own Chromebook costs 1800$ inside the US, and more abroad. A device with max specs of 500GB storage & 16GB RAM isn't  an "affordable laptop for people that don't do much more than use a web browser". 

So coupling a device with such high end specs but an OS that is (in many ways) more limited than a regular Android tablet is just not right. 
Chromebooks are even more limiting than Android 

Chromebooks try to be both a laptop and an Android tablet, which makes them a little bit bad at both (kinda like jack of all trades, but master of none).  That said, I find it to be a very useful device.

My Samsung Chromebook pro is really useful, but you miss a few things.

**Windows/Mac PCs are better because:**  
* Drag-drop files.  
* Full administrative control.  
* Many hotkeys.  
* Using specialized programs (especially ones related to your major, generally full-fledged autocad or word and such).  

**Android tablets are better because:**  
* Holding a Chromebook as a tablet then feeling the keyboard keys pressing is bothersome, not to mention the heavier weight.  
* Quite a few apps don't work on ChromeOS & never will due to the way Chromebooks are (I miss launchers so much & I can't even use widgets).  
* Can't use 3rd party keyboards from the PlayStore, not even Google Keyboard. Currently the Chromebook keyboard is objectively worse than Google Keyboard. The keyboard of large-screen devices running iOS are much more useful than that of Chromebook since they have undo, paste icon, (clipboard access?) etc.
*Cannot connect the Chromebook to a PC or a Mac to transfer files, and in my experience transfer between Android & ChromeOS is very buggy.  
* Hotkeys for copying/pasting do not always work. Sometimes the Chromebook physical keyboard does not even work in Android apps text fields.  
I feel like I have no say because I love surveys. I sign up for random surveys online to be mail to me and stuff… 
7araaaaam
doubt it. average power consumption of a PC is 165 W/h, so what are your rates per month?
Sometimes when I'm using navigation to go to work, I cannot look at the phone. 
Only subscription I have is for apps that need money to remain operative, such as Cloud Storage, VPN, etc. 
IOS 11 is a miss from what I've seen from people 
Please note that a lot of P10s (~~and some Mate 9s~~) were found out to be using the slower EMMC instead of the [noticeably faster UFS 2 (and 2.1)](https://i.imgur.com/nTauK2j.jpg)  

They were even advertising UFS on the promotion page but [removed it after the scandal](https://www.androidauthority.com/huawei-mate-9-removes-mention-ufs-2-1-766214/).  

The CEO then made bullshit claim that Huawei's EMUI compensates for the hardware speed loss or that it makes no difference… I think. 
why does it **feel** like all the newest updates are buggy as hell with the Nexus & Pixel?

I mean this isn't a dev channel, these are supposed to be finished software products. 
Gboard, SwiftKey, and hardware Arabic keyboards all have harakat & tanween on them
what did he do? 
sometimes you just see that something can be made better in a very simple way, yet some how strange errors occur as your heart sinks and you turn off the machine waiting for someone to discover that error. That is your cue to pretend to be bewildered at what may have resulted in this strange issue. 
Yeah. Kinda looks like they've got a 5oclock shadow when the effect is on the bottom half, and like a fever when it's on the upper half…

I would if the tiny icons would stay true to the color of original icons. For example, Firefox being orange, Spotify green, Facebook blue, etc. 
Really different and neat! But I noticed that the Facebook sign doesn't show the liquid effect unless you zoom in.  

Maybe you could increase the effect as I imagine it will be even less noticeable as at the usual desktop icon-size. 
From my own observations as a middle Eastern guy:

link to the ad? 
Have you looked at [1ClipBoard](http://1clipboard.io/#section_download)?

it syncs across Mac & Windows devices, and it saves everything from copied pictures to text.
I agree that the stock Samsung or Apple notes apps are the best, but they aren't flexible in terms of being available on different OSs. 
I found that EverNote works best despite the cost of subscription. Keep in mind that EverNote is behind on a few things. 
fucking Facebook started showing me ["promoted" porn](https://i.imgur.com/uQZp2qv.jpg) ads 
Oh wow. What a shit app. I seriously wouldn't stand it at all. 
The text selection and layout of big text pages is utter trash on Android as well. 

If it worked on Android as well as it does on Windows or IOS I wouldn't have an EverNote subscription now. 
I just don't trust LG… 
Everything in Samsung Browser is better… except for the lack of syncing. I'd completey switch if the Chrome extension would sync more than just bookmarks. 
Sorry, I didn't support the part about neglection, only that dogs don't have such senses regarding "bad people" 
I was just about to face-palm about people actually thinking that dogs have anti-evil sensors…

only 1 benefit when comparing A5 vs the S7: USB C  
Maybe it depends on the music app? 
it's just that the US is still SMS-dependent, whereas the rest of the world has switched to an online chat app. 

**WhatsApp:** Middle East + North Africa + India + parts of Europe    

**BBM:** Philippines 

**Facebook Messenger:** Australia 

**WeChat:** China 

**Japan:** Line 

etc. 
I did. I like the "feel", but the browser was overall just shit.  

_Extensions didn't exist at first, and now they can only be used by downloading them from Windows Store  

_Can't edit bookmarks after saving them   

_No browser on Mac  

_Drag & Drop usually doesn't work  

_Sync doesn't sync the layout & other general settings  

_When sync for Passwords/Bookmarks/History/Tabs works, it takes so long on Windows10. My Edge on the phone didn't even register the new bookmarks till this day… I just gave up on it after a few days of use.  

I'm kinda disappointed, because Microsoft Edge Browser mobile app (which I liked more than mobile Chrome) is what pushed me to try switching to Edge on desktop, then all those issues sprung up.  

**EDIT:** This is all before the recent Fall Creators Update
I see. But is rich text editor standardized? Because sometimes they have color options, other times they don't. 
I kinda understand you, but you could turn on offline mode (which has to be done when while you're online) to be able to use those programs offline. 

That said, I prefer using Word & the sync happens as a regular files syncing to the cloud instead of the Google Docs method. 
But can't you have your GDrive entire storage available offline, so the changes are synced once internet connection is available?
Could you explain what is harder in Gdrive when compared to OneDrive or DropBox?
Thanks for the attempt, but it was not like that.  

For example, you would post on r/TIL "According to **madeup** documents unocovered by  **madeup** Research institute, George Washington rented hookers before joining the army." and if that post got enough tration you would link the post to the lying subreddit.
in middle east, they are more expensive when compared to all (except iPhones) and I've never seen any advertisement. 

I think that people only buy them because they have a Play Station
With me, it's been limited success. Always get about 6 apps back and almost all without the previous settings. 
Funny, my non-Allo assistant is shit

I suppose. CloudMagic often had sync issues for me, which is why I unsubbed. 
Oh well. I didn't know that CloudMagic/Newton email app supported Gmail push notifications 
Good luck. The app may be a little too overwhelming with all the settings and customization, but I think that you will catch up very quickly.  

You can test the export/restore setting before fully buying the app.
Oh, I understand your pain. Good thing I only use 3 accounts + Gmail.  

On Nine Mail, you have to sign into those accounts one by one. Once you do that, you can manually export a settings file that would return everything to the way they were, from notes to schedule to syncing duration. The app allows a lot of control over your emails and it has always worked for me.  

True that there is some tediousness to it since you have to do the export/restore process by yourself, but I don't think that it's too bad as I just need to do that once after moving to a new device. 
Weird that you people keep getting news about Trump.  

All I have is overwatch, Android, apps, local news, PC's, etc. I guess I'm lucky. 

My only issue is that since I read about the American football anthem protests, I keep getting news about NFL team transfers, players issues, scores, and such things even though I have no interest what so ever in sports.
I meant that whatever you do to your email account on a single device will also effect any other device with that account.  

Or are you saying that you want all devices those emails to have the same sorting, synced folders, etc? 
surely the effects will affect all other accounts on different devices?  

Sorry for wasting your time lol I'm just finding it hard to understand. 
My music teacher was shit…

Part of me believes this & another part thinks you write in a way that makes thing too interesting to not be fiction… 

hmmm
I don't think an app that has a buttons for adding or removing xDays/Hours/Mins exists on Android. 
how can he attach a pic to the email via macro Droid? 
OP here is a suggestion: 

Download MacroDroid to take a daily pic at a specific time, then have the image folder sync to a specific file on OneDrive or Google Drive at another specific time.
Hm. Tried Nine Mail? 

It's working very nicely for me, but I'm not sure about the imap thing & the one-time payment cost. 
It really is just this:

Picture (optional)  
Name  
Address  
Contact info  
Nationality  
  
Time Periods, below which the work you did & title you had.  

Also optional short paragraph of notable accomplishments & why you want to work & what you hope to achieve. 

If you need help with the actual typing & writing & design of the word document, you can go to almost any copy center & they'll help for a fee. 
video briefly started with 1 kid, as soon as another kid appears you can no longer see the face of the initial kid.  

The kid behind doesn't show do anything interesting, so… 
fucking lithium ion batteries. When will we have a better battery type? 
I cannot even sign into Spotify despite my US-VPN. That, and I lso cannot use a non-American credit card. 
it seems like she got dropped on her head when she was younger… 

That said, she seems sweet & Jimmy is a bad. interviewer 
Mimi is better. Clover doesn't even have tabs
Cuz play music has horrible interface & Spotify is not available in my country. Also I like to edit the music for over repetitive or annoying parts 
Have you tried talking to Music teachers from school? 
Wake me up inside 
I kinda vibrated them and shook them by hand lol
Hmm I have used the iPhone X & Pixel 2 camera, and videos really were a lot better… at least they seemed to 
Huawei's P10+ (2017 flagship) has an IR blaster. 
Thank you sm
I see. Thank you for this, I really wish I'd known of it earlier. 

All of the files from drive are sorted the same way as they were online? As in specific documents are in their respective folders and such? 
Meanwhile Overwatch keeps on spamming useless emblems. 
Oh… well I didn't know that existed. 

Have you tried it before? 
I understand. While I'm not using it as my reddit app atm, I keep checking out the new features and fiddle with it to see if it meets my own needs
Not sure if this will help, but Quality Net marketrs have promised me that within 1 year most areas will have their DSL replaced with fiberoptics.  

I **never** get lag on any game with european servers after connecting via ethernet
I don't know… half of my taxi experiences with Taxis are shit, be it taxis in my country in the Middle East or the ones I took on my travels in Europe. 
The Saber movements were impressive for the time, especially when they reflected. 
I was looking for a video to teach my brother about a specific thing in chemical equations. 

The first result was a link to a specific part of a video lecture where that was addressed. Stunned me. 
Your app has new ideas & is fluid, but some features that exist in almost all 3rd party Reddit apps are missing. 

Your app is a bit of a fresh take. 
in my country, using apple maps to get a popular mall or even any common place will very likely tell you that it cannot map the way 

Google maps guides to any place, and were in the Middle East. 
Hey, kuwait is currently cool. Come visit 👌🏻 
I kinda dislike Google Maps. Do you find Waze to be better? 
Thanks. Problem is that I only noticed the issue a while after the zipping
i can, if it were on a tablet or a phone. But on a Chromebook, that setting does not work… at least not on the Samsung Chromebook pro.  

It used to work though but it has not been working for about a year. Many people have that same issue with sync but our submissions on Sync's subreddit fell on deaf ears.
Sync for Reddit ignores the super large screen (relatively) of the chromebook, so I cannot get 2 panels or columns. Boost does, that is why friendship ended with Sync and Boost is my best friend. 
well… 
It totally didn't make sense. All they had to do was have a proper app on IOS & Android 
It's better than the latest update, but still shit. I really wish they'd revert to the old design instead of the oversized UI they introduced a few months ago. 
I don't disable dev settings but numbers just reset on my OP5 & P10 after restarting the device 
Solved. You have helped me a lot. 
Sigh. The traffic may be nuts. I regret that it'll take place here… 
I don't know how to play boardgames 
for me it always resets to default whenever I restart 
The Mate 10 has a bunch of compromises between its models that make it a non-consideration for me. 
I see, thanks. I meant that it moves your "account's" karma & submitted questions 
I don't know. This says nothing about the camera interface, shutter speed, and lowlight pictures. Not even a video sample. 

Bottom line, we need before/after pics 
>Also Mechanical keyboards 

How dare you. 
I understand. But is it even possible to set it as the default for Chromebook? 
I love this so much 
>I have evolved beyond racism, I now see everyone as white. 

-Stephen Colbert 
This actually sounds like my dream job
That show doesn't exactly make fun of Islam, it usually makes fun of the social norms in Saudi. It doesn't challenge Islam, at least not directly. 

That episode also wasn't a direct attack on Islam, a lot of people miss the point (if you see any) in that episode and simply consider it a funny show, I bet it would that episode would have also been liked if the roles were reversed, because that show's writers are generally good & so are the actors. 
I wish they'd have a remake (not remaster) of that game. 
OP what's that pic from? 
It looks like it's reached above his waist…
I hope it is optional because I personally don't like it.
after all those centuries 
Looks really great. But where I want to use it (chromebook) it cannot be set as default. 

It is really great and innovative, but it lacks a few things like directly taking you to an app's info page or renaming shortcuts 
how to get started? 
Can you show some of Zaha's work? 
What's the processor? 
I also tried to give Edge a shot, but being forced to download extensions via windows store, issues with  drag-drop, bookmarks links not being editable, as well as it only being updates with the OS has turned me off.
I'm a Muslim from the Middle East. While I don't like homosexuality, I always treat people the way I think that they would treat me. Every thing else is left to God. 


>an add-on syncs your bookmarks. The rest passwords auto fills bookmarks all are synced to Samsung account 

But the passwords & auto fills are not synced to anything besides Android's Samsung Browser, which makes it bothersome when you also use Windows or other platforms 
I wish you luck. If the Eve V is successful then I think you guys can be 
Why Samsung internet when it has no syncing equivalent on other platforms? 


* Where will the fingerprint reader be placed? 
* You're releasing the phone near the end of the year, so every single manufacturer will have already released their own devices by then. How will you be able to compete? 
* People may be reluctant due to the lack of track record when they get issues. 
* How will you compete with Samsung pricing? 
* Aren't you worried about repeating the Note 7 debacle? 
* All others who tried failed miserably in the camera department. How will you be better?

There are a bunch of quirks but overall a solid app 
Wellm there is a reason why I have left instagram. This just makes me more convinced.  

I just need chronological order & better comments that allows copying, instead of getting a warning. Reddit comments (sorted by date) is the best example of comments layout that I have experienced.
