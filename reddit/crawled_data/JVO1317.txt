I was thinking the same. If identical source cannot guarantee identical binaries, so different source code won’t either.

I’ve had an iPad for almost 8 years. At first, when I saw art like this I rushed to download the app they used, naively thinking that I could paint something similar. Now, I just upvote and repeat to myself: I know how to program and I can pee inside the bowl.

I gave up. I just walk, sometimes I listen an audiobook.
I try to walk daily at least for 30minutes. And I had a “great” idea: if I use the Accessibility options to read and reply my email while I walk without looking the screen, I would have 30 productive minutes. 

It’s **really** hard.

Exactly!

I come here to learn about features and to know if I can help on some bug reporting. Nothing else. A new version would be great, but it isn’t “Required”.


>	I’ve gotten more than my money’s worth

When I read about the problems /u/iamthatis had with the Images API, I felt that I took advantage on him for the cheap price for the pro version.
As I understand it, these aren't two different ways.

-	0.99... is not 1 *while* it is approaching to infinite digits. It's 1 *only when* there are infinite digits.
-	 1/ln(n) is not 0 *while* it is approaching to infinite.

 So, while there are numbers then there are prime numbers.

I haven’t jailbroken for years. Honest question: Why do you still find it useful/necessary/fun?
I think this is the best answer. Although it’s true that modern processors can execute more than one instruction in parallel, most of those instructions requires more than one cycle.
For me the real improvement was the microphone on the default keyboard. I rely on dictation while I’m walking, and it was cumbersome to click the microphone, then the microphone again, then the keyboard icon. I’d like to be just one (to touch and hold the microphone to dictate and when you release it then return to the keyboard), but now that there are just two clicks (dictate, back to keyboard), it’s a real improvement.

I do something similar but using iPhone Read Screen feature (default activated swiping down two fingers from the screen top). So I use the iBooks version of the book, swipe two fingers to start reading aloud. The page is automatically turned over, and even the phrase is highlighted.

I do that in English and Spanish (native). For me, the main advantage is Focus, I can concentrate better, and I commit myself to blocks of at least 20 minutes of reading.

I know this is sarcasm. But most of us in Mexico City use some version of seismic alert app with a very specific sound. 
So it happens that you hear the alert sound and start to panic before realizing that you are not near Mexico City.
Yes, I live here. 
Exactly... 

Richter measures the original quake intensity, but in Mexico City we feel quakes from different sources. 

So a 7.1 quake from a close source may be stronger and cause more damage than a 8.1 quake from a farther source.

Nebo with pencil for meeting notes. Most people find intrusive that someone uses a keyboard in a meeting.

iA Writer for notes. I love Ulysses, but I left it when they started the subscription model. OneNote is also a great alternative, but it’s slow to format, and to launch.

Microsoft Office. I like more the Apple IWork, but, you know, standards.

Omnifocus for task managing.

My birth town has also 12 letters, and here in Mexico sometimes they ask me to speak slow, and then they can figure the spelling out.

>	For example, the silent -e. For a Welsh speaker like me, that’s f***ing weird. Why put in a letter that you are not going to use?

I’m a native spanish speaker and still I have a similar feeling in spanish, even when we have very few cases: silents u after g and q, silents h when not preceded by c or s, and polysound y and x (No rules for that).

* I use Nebo for business meetings. Some people feel uncomfortable when they are in a meeting and someone has a computer or iPad on. But using the Apple Pencil and this app it looks like taking notes in a regular notebook.

* iA Writer, my main app for taking notes. It syncs with iPhone and Mac, so everything is available and updated everywhere. Formatting is simple and consistent.

* Noteshelf for personal notes and drawings.

* OneNote is great but it has many features and syncing is cumbersome. I prefer iA.
I also select them this way.

l'd recommend a different approach. Imagine that you'll be out for a month, and that you must leave clear instructions for your team on how to comply with these practices on projects that you still don't know.

1.1 Based on your methodology, documentation, technology, roles... how should the team select the products, artifacts, documents to verify? - Remember, for CMMI, *to validate* is to confirm that you build the right product, and *to verify* is to confirm that you build the product right.

1.2 How should the team know that they have all the things that they need to start the verification of the selected products?

1.3 How should they know how to verify? And how should they know that the verification was complete and correct (independently of the products quality)?

-----

Even when the answers will be similar to yours, this approach makes easier to ensure that you also comply with the Generic Practices.

Good Luck.
According to Wikipedia, a Magellan Penguin lives 25 years in average. So Turbo has been trying to find a mate for 56% of their expected lifetime. Assuming a 75 years expectancy for humans, that would mean that if Turbo was human it has been trying to find a mate for 42 years.

There is no “actually work”.

But imagine a world being simulated on a computer, for example Warcraft or the Sims. 

You may say that there are characters “interacting”, or “thinking”, or “doing” things in this simulated world. But at the lowest level there are only switches being turned on and off inside the computer. And the “position” of these switches defines the world status, and the characters behaviors. 

... and *maybe* the status of our world is defined by rocks (working as switches) being moved with a regular frecuency.

Early on a saturday morning I saw a drunk young woman erratically walking and talking incoherences, her blouse was wide open in the front and had no shoes. I didn't know what to do and I just walked by her and left her alone. Then, on a second thought, I realized that maybe she was in problems or lost. By then I was about 20 meters away, I turned around and saw an old man taking his jacket off and covering her, asking for her name, giving her a phone to call a relative. I heard her saying thank you while trying to call someone.

I failed her... but that old man didn't.

Some years ago, I was with my wife and some friends, Mexicans all of us, in Central Park watching the NYC marathon. We were clapping and cheering everyone, especially those with a Mexican flag, but the runners are SO FAST that I'm sure that they didn't notice us. After a while, we saw a runner that stopped running about 30 yards before us, he walked and then he sat on the pavement. When we noticed that he had a Mexican flag we started to shout in spanish: "Don't give up", "the finish line is just a quarter of a mile away", "You can do it", etc. He stared at us and then he stood up and resumed running.

Up to this day, I believe we helped him to finish the race.

2) Help someone. On anything. To carry bags on the super market. Mow the grass of your neighbor's house. Do chores at your parent's house.

3) Connect with friends and family. Call them. Visit them. Listen them. Be genuine and emphatic.

4) Repeat. Daily. Hourly. Over and over.

2. I left the 4 cycles, but during the 3rd break the label in the watch says "2 cycles remaining", and it was confusing to me, because I couldn't remember if that included the current cycle. I'd like a label such as " ln cycle 2 of 4".

3. I think that the last break is unnecessary and confusing. I'd like to be able to disable it.
I just want to see when FIFA fines English Federation for this fans 'reaction', just as they promptly fined Mexico and asked them to stop fans 'cheereing' opponent's goalkeeper.

LOL, just kidding, this was actually funny.
I had a problem with an incomplete django app, and it was solved executing *git add .* before sending the app to Heroku.

Maybe you have a similar problem.
I was actually looking for something like this... downloading
I use a slightly different version of your tip. 

When we arrive, we completely empty the suitcases using the hotel closets and drawers. As clothes are used we accommodate them in the suitcases. In the last day, almost all the clothes are already packed, and, if there are still clean clothes, we put them on plastic bags. 

Mixing clean and dirty clothes is *not pro* at all.
Agree, respect *and* trust should be granted, not earned.
Closures in Swift. I know they've been around for a while. But for me, it's the first time they're a pleasure to use.
I don't want to, but I must agree with you. I could be defined as a promoter for the service, but they've complicated the solutions, instead of stabilizing the basic functionality. 

Last week I prototyped a web app + iOS web services, but every step was harder than the last one. Then yesterday I used a Heroku template and it was up and running by night. Sad, I really wanted GAE to to work.
+1  another vote for iBeacons. They're really easy to program, waste little iPhone power, and the user experience is better than GPS fences.
I'm not sure of what you mean by "act like a button". If what you want is to trigger an action every time the user presses a key while in a UITextField, then you should implement a TextDelegate.
Nice, I'll take a look. Thanks!
I love to walk. So I always said Yes, and even tired I loved to walk with her and our dog. But I said No to many others things. And now I miss them so much. And I'm unable to enjoy walking anymore. 
Agree, characters are developed *just enough*. But I liked it, too. And I'm glad to know that the next books are also good. I'm about to start the second one.
Overwhelming, and you just described one dimension (time), but the same applies to space: *before* the Big Bang there were no space where *to put* the universe.
No. 
Los ateísmos, teísmos, fés, doctrinas, son palabras inventadas por la gente con pensamiento mágico para que al usarlas estés en su nivel y en lo que se sienten cómodos. 
Para mí el punto es: ¿intentas entender cómo es nuestro mundo o evades inventando explicaciones mágicas?
It's a fast read. Not "Dan Brown flipping pages" speed, but the science is not dense, and there aren't extensive narratives locking you in one event.
*The Flanders Panel* by Arturo Pérez-Reverte

From its Wikipedia page:
Julia, an art restorer and evaluator living in Madrid, discovers a painted-over message on a 1471 Flemish masterpiece called La partida de ajedrez (The Chess Game) which reads "Quis Necavit Equitem", written in Latin (English: "Who killed the knight?"). With the help of her old friend and father-figure, an antiques dealer named César, and Muñoz, a quiet local chess master, Julia works to uncover the mystery of a 500-year-old murder. At the same time, however, Julia faces danger of her own; as several people helping her along her search are also murdered.
Beautiful, indeed. At first, I tried to prove that you shouldn't add the 1/3 and 1/6 speeds, but then I *saw* it. 

I knew a simpler one: imagine two persons, A and B, facing each other one kilometer apart, and both of them start walking in straight line with a constant pace of 5 km/h. Exactly at the same moment they start walking, a fly also goes flying from person A to person B at a constant speed of 60 km/hr. When the fly reaches person B, it immediately returns towards person A, without losing time, and at the same constant pace. When the fly reaches person A, it returns again towards person B, and so it goes until all of them converges in the same point. What is the distance flown by the fly? --- In this case the solution is trivial considering the speed of A and B is constant.
Good point about "before time". 
Thanks, I live in a big city now, but as a kid I used to do something like that.
Nice post. I don't like the "use paper" section. I use OneNote on a full screen shared with Xcode. I also write a backlog at the beginning of every session. Then as I work on it I use an outline to add what I'm actually doing. Whatever is not completed on this day is easy to identify on the next day or session.
Dado que estamos en /r/mexico bastaría con ver el despilfarro por la visita del religioso argentino. Los políticos mexicanos olvidaron la separación estado-religión y durante esta semana cometen delitos que rayan en lo ridículo.
En general coincido con tu punto de vista, lo único que no me gusta utilizar la palabra "ateo", porque es una palabra basada en las creencias religiosas. Coincido más con el punto de vista de http://the-brights.net de tener una vista basada en la naturaleza, no en conceptos mágicos. 
I hope you like it 😊 
Wow, I'm downloading now from iBooks. 
Indeed, I feel there is no way to visualize how immense is even our solar system.
I am not sure, as I said I am not physicist 🙈.
Thanks, I'll check that one too.
I can't imagine what infinite space means 😕 
It's a valid question. As I (not a physicist) understand it spacetime exists *only* because matter/energy exists. The universe is not an empty room where matter is placed. Before Big Bang, neither space or time had a meaning.
No, I didn't. Thanks for the recommendation.
Love xkcd reference 
It isn't. Number 3 is missing.
I loved the book and I agree this answers, at least theoretically, OP question.
*Sent from my iPhone*
I agree with the "Mixed reviews" comment.

In my case, most of the time I up vote it.
Agree. Pythonista is great and I have it in my iPhone and my iPad. But, I think you should try Swift. 
Devuélvelo. Es lo correcto, en México y en cualquier parte.
No. Quédate en donde estés hasta la siguiente alerta. 
De Mixquiahuala, Hidalgo - Barbacoa de borrego preparada en hoyo. Con consomé, elotes asados y, en temporada, acompañada de salsa de gusanos de maguey.
It's almost sad how Modric asked for the ball, then turned around and he couldn't find someone trying to help.
This is one of the reasons to boo Ronaldo: http://youtu.be/IeWHBg6yt4k (the spanish commentators wonder what Ronaldo said to PSG coach and owner).

It's not only about results and underperforming, it seems he's asking to be transferred.
LOL!!
Thanks!
Permíteme diferir.

¿De dónde viene entonces la famosa y conmovedora frase "Hombres necios que me quitáis mi DVD portátil sin razón"?

Quiere decir que no tenía porque se lo quitaban.
¡Exactamente!
No exageres. Tenochtitlan se fundó hace 700 años, así que calculo que esa pieza arqueológica tiene sólo 500 años. ;-)
Yes, it's pretty clear: "if they choose to do it''.
Please, don't forget the "Enhance Photo Quality'' feature. With that we can read terrorist's messages from the sky.
Exactly!! 

This, and other proposals in the name of freedom, just want to take advantage of the current fears.
The best answer was given by @KingDuderhino, but I don't think his is an ELI5 answer. 

So I made an image trying to explain the same idea: http://imgur.com/jrySIiu
Instead of reinstalling, I changed the Xcode package name in Applications folder, and it worked. Even I could rename it back to Xcode.
Same issue here. It has been several weeks now, and the Photos Library hasn't new pics after April 19th. Anyone knows a way to restart/reset the syncing?
Agree. And remember, the first five books were written almost simultaneously, so reading them in that context it's easier to understand how the leaders built and justified their laws to control their people. 
Maybe there is an accented (or other non ascii ) character in that line of your code.
Thanks 😊 
I was looking for this comment. I'm still not convinced that this article is just a joke.
+1. Great resource.
If you've already developed for iOS using ObjectiveC, I think the official Swift eBook is the easiest way.
"A sound of Thunder". It completely spoils a good Bradbury short-story. In the movie, there are 'time waves' that affect present world *after* something is changed in the past (yeah, there is no way you can make sense of it). And it affects differently to *most* evolved species.
If you already know how to program, I'd recommend you the 'Big Nerd Ranch' book for iOS programming.

If you don't, I'd suggest you to learn Python and use Pythonista to build your iOS programs. You won't be able to sell them, at least not without some porting, but you'll learn a lot about iOS.

-- sorry, for the late reply.
It sounds like something easy to program...
Loved it!

I  loved this video. As a professional developer, I would be proud if he was my son.
I agree. I read the BigNerdRanch book and it's extremely easy to follow up for an experienced developer, I guess it also should be for a newbie. 

I've also migrated several examples from Obj-C to Swift and it's been relatively easy too. Although some topics in Swift require different guidelines (like error management, optionals/nils, functions/blocks), the typical result is that Swift code requires less lines to achieve the same result.
