That’s just the way the SE is, mine was the same. It’s especially noticable if you have a case. 
It’s the cheapest way if you have a laptop available or a PS4 near a PC

I'm usually alone in the gym and there is no rack for bench press so I'm either limited with 2x24kg dumbbells (53lbs each) or smith machine bench. But the safety clips at the lowest possible position stop the bar about 5-10cm(2-4in) above my chest.

Should I do the press with upping the weight & failing (using safety clips) or do the weight I'm comfortable with without clips and use full ROM to my chest? Now I don't really try above 40kg loaded on the bar since I might not be able to finish the reps. Could I still progress with 24kg DBs? (more reps I guess)

I'm really lacking chest progress so need to do something.

Best to backup your saves to PS+ cloud daily if this ever happens so you have a backup.
Run a geekbench when charging and on battery. Might have bad batteries, I had 3d touch lag on mine when below 50%
Would I still get 3 months extra if I enter a prepaid 12 month card? Or is it a store exclusive offer?

Yeah but Apple rejects repairs on devices with non original parts.
This seems like a reasonable price if it’ll also be 29€ in Europe. 

But what if I already swapped my battery for an aftermarket one? Out of luck probably. 
Sometimes it just won’t register the home button on my 7+, can feel the click but nothing will happen. Screen off and on again and then it works.

Download ibackupbot and check the battery cycles and capacity
Use ibackupbot for windows
Yep and trying to switch to previous app by tapping the top left corner is hard too.
Is the home button lag still present when exiting apps?
Same on mine especially if you use a case. Doesn't seem to be faulty though as touch works fine on the edges if you test with an app.
Not that I know of. Slowly it'll replace all my icons haha.

Too bad they’re so expensive and hard to get in Europe.

Thank you
Thank you, that’s amazing. 
What do you even gain with 11? 7+ is blazing fast on 10.3.3 and battery is great. Only downside I noticed is some camera related apps that require ios11 (for playing with the dual camera setup and depth mode)
Check the capacity with iBackupbot, it's probably under 80%.

If you have a FDM printer it will be nearly impossible to print due to low resolution/quality.

You'd need a SLA printer to get a good result but even then it would probably take quite some iterations to get the clips correct.

Is this "in transit to destination" something new when they updated the tracking site?

Got two "in transit" updates at exactly 9:55am, nov. 9 and 10. I guess that's automated?
Good to hear that. 
That's probably it. I ordered a NOHON from aliexpress, hopefully that will resolve the issue. 

You can ask in r/mobilerepair for good quality vendors.
Yeah it's very rare that the motherboard will just die. Maybe you fried the charging chip if you used a cheap cable, maybe the battery itself died or the lightning port.

https://www.microsolderingrepairs.com/blog/2017/1/7/iphone-tristar-u2-replacement
Yeah I'm a bit afraid of this method since the screwdriver can slip and you can damage the flex cable with its sharp edges. 
Interesting, very cheap mistake fortunately. Did you heat up the home button or did it peel off normally?
All these random issues make me really scared to try and replace the lcd on my 7+. :(
Be careful, OP says he has an iPhone 6+ but claims he had this 7+ from January. 
Install CPU Dasher and check the frequencies. I have an aftermarket battery in my 6s+ and get 3D touch lag when it drops below 50% and random stutters. When under 10% if I crank up the brightness it starts lagging real bad. Probably the battery just can't hold the voltage when under load. Ordered a new one since it really pisses me off. 
not 256gb
nice price
Link? (Pm)
This might be it, didn't dig around too much. Guess capacity will have to do. 
Will try later if it works on W10, how do I install it?
Tried this, can see design/real capacity but shows cycles as 0. Probably only a Lenovo program can access that.
You can check via serial. Unless the screen has been replaced.

Got it solved now... (finally)
Yeah good luck, made the same mistake over a month ago, support replied within a day that they forwarded to the payments department and I still have nothing returned after 35 days. 

Just same responses from support. (But no reply for the last few days)

Don't know what to do. 
If it gets shipped from China you might have to pay import tax so it might come out more expensive. 

The official store also has a EU warehouse but you need to talk to TEVO directly on skype. 
Tarantula has a nice community on FB, I'm building mine right now and am enjoying it (we'll see how it prints though haha)

Got mine for 180€ on aliexpress from Germany so no import fees and a free titan extruder. You can upgrade to a larger 280mm bed for about $25 off ebay too

Edit: Just saw that you're in SG, that complicates things a bit. Probably easier with a new replacement.
Get a used genuine one off ebay, should be about the same price but quality will be much better. Will probably also have the camera and speaker flex installed so you don't have to fiddle with that.

You can install iBackupbot to check the cycles and capacity of the battery if it will help.
The 6+ has to push almost 3x the pixels of the 5s (probably even more since it renders everything even higher than 1080p and then downsamples). And the A8 processor isn't that much more powerful vs the one in the 5S, the real jump was with the A9 in the 6S.
The 6+ is too weak for its resolution and 1gb ram doesn't do it any favours.

Np, now grind it out :D
Press O as soon as the second character starts walking towards the screen after you select it. You should hear the souns like you backed out of a menu. Then just press it again, don't have to do it 4 times. Then press touchpad and dpad up two times (should hear this too). As soon as the screen zooms out the second time press X and it shoud pop up the prompt. 

If you fuck it up close GTA and start again, press X to load directly to singleplayer and choose Michael there and start over, you don't need online first and loading the autosave. (saves time)
What's the car?
Yeah you need something like this: http://www.borderlinx.com/

Yep, source & sell 3-4 cars while the bunker fills up and then sell for 500k solo every 2h.

Yeah sold a few topends and a single delivery bunker for around 500k
Thought so too but the Ardent is visible on Warstock for me and the I/E payout is 200k. I turned on the PS4 about 5hrs before the old event ended though.
2h20 or 2h40, around there. You can afk in a contact mission and you won't get hit with daily fees. You can also do a full resupply for 15k before you go afk if you start with a full supply bar.

Same. But you can see about 2 pixels of the drop down menu as you start typing so maybe it's in the background lol.

Also embedded youtube videos on forums don't play which is a dealbreaker.

http://www.businessinsider.com/iphone-6-plus-touch-disease-what-is-it-and-what-can-i-do-2016-10
iPhone 6+?
What network was it on?
Why the downvotes?

This is an Android 7.0 issue, supposedly fixed in 7.1.1 so we should get it in about a year.
Photos. You can try SDmaid and clearing the Photos' cache within the app, maybe that would clean up some more files.
Try an older version, had the same issue on OPO a while back.
For just a tiny bit more you can get an OPPO VOOC brick charger that should work with dash charge.

I meant system settings and not GPM. It's on the bottom.
Plug in your headphones, go to settings, sound and audio tuner. 
Try dirtyflashing OOS and then the kernel again. 
You can try enabling systemUI tuner by holding the gear cog in the notification panel and then enabling power notifications, you get finer control of notifications lightning up the screen. (but might not work)
Per app color notification LED settings. (yes I know I can use lightflow or similar but still)
Not yet.
Click on "more settings"
Alright, would like the 1st gen then.
Doesn't really matter, is the 2nd that much better?

I'm from Europe but will cover shipping.

Don't think the apps make a difference since the processing is still done. I flashed snapdragoncamera from xda and it might be a bit better but didn't test much yet.
I noticed this too, it's a "feature". The software adds heavy post processing to the photo. It looks good in the viewfinder but when you take a picture every detail is blurred. 

Maybe it's better on other roms that don't use OxygenOS camera libraries?
Yes it's better on nougat, was really bothering me on the marshmallow build. I flashed OOS4.0 as soon as I got the phone and then dowgraded  back to 3.5.4 as there was some battery drain and the scrolling, typing latency was bad but it's much better now when I'm back on OOS4.0. Had an OPO before and that had some latency aswell, was very noticable coming from an iPhone 6+. 
Try cf.lumen
Not (yet?) possible, some people are trying though:

https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-3/how-to/guide-unlock-additional-lte-bands-t3519563

It's for a 3 but would probably be similar for a 3T.
Is it possible to wake the screen when you touch the sensor? Now it only vibrates if I use a wrong finger or unlocks it
The solder under the touch control chips breaks off the motherboard and there is no more connection so touch doesn't work. It's more common on the 6+ but happens on some 6 too. 
whooooooaahhhhh
Yes if you have Chrome or similar browser that allows notifications (I use Tuga browser and have a FB shortcut on homescreen)
Great price, post on /r/hardwareswap too
Thank you, I will have to check with the seller if he still has a copy of the declaration. (I'm the one expecting the package)

There was no other address given to him so it's kinda hard he would mess it up haha.
Do you work for USPS? Would it matter if you selected a different country despite the correct address? (does it go in a different container or anything?)

Nothing unusual just "replacement parts" (if you meant the customs declaration that goes on the package)
Slovenia.

I still get tracking on these packages even though it says it's only tracked in US, example: https://tools.usps.com/go/TrackConfirmAction.action?tRef=fullpage&tLc=1&tLabels=LH003650504US

I know it should arrive just curious why it says Great Britain on the receipt. Maybe the post office lady just used a random country for that.

Yeah you need to take the back plate off and unscrew the plastic cover. 
Try unplugging the battery for a minute or so and then try again.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3PylR_S3S4
What's wrong with the iPhones? Does any of them boot up?
Still available? Would you do $150 + whatever shipping?
https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/comments/5ik8wr/usany_h_verizon_unlocked_iphone_5_iphone_5s/?st=IWRI3SJ6&sh=17ca1690
Can you unlock?
Still available?
You can check how much battery capacity there's left and the battery cycles with ibackupbot. My 6+ was at around 40% after 500 cycles.
Screen is about £30 to replace. Check the charging port if it's blocked with lint, you can see if the lightning cable doesn't go in all the way. Can use a toothpick or a needle to clean it and it should charge again. 
How big of a crack? Probably around 150£. 
Still available?
Confirmed
Would go for the 6S, better aluminum, 2GB ram, better camera, raise to wake, faster touchID, 3d touch. The 6 is almost the same as 5S internally just a different form factor.
That's for 6S only
How much?
Yes

Should I still install this if I haven't been banned nor have I received a message from teamsnapchat?
So are you giving away the laptop? You have the [H] and [W] switched I think. 

If you would ship international I'd be interested, could use it for school since I don't have one. 
Thanks. Probably needs to be paid off to be eligible. 
Can you unlock? Probably not yet.
If it's Verizon it's already unlocked. 
Does the iphone 5 still work? and the smashed 5s?
This is the 2nd gen moto? Would you ship to Europe?
Would you post to Europe?
No problem :)
It's around $10 in an envelope.
$40 shipped to Europe for the iPhone?
$100 since touc disease is gonna get it sooner or later haha. 
Would you ship to Europe? Can you submit an unlock request in December?
Great, thanks. 
Are you on Tmobile? If this is your device you can submit an unlock request and they should unlock it. 

I'll take it if you can do that. 
$150? Can this be unlocked?
Would be around $10-15. No problem, good luck :)
I'll offer $80 shipped to Europe since it's quite dinged haha. 
Do you still have the 5S?
Alright, lmk. 
$150 + whatever shipping to Europe for the iphone?
Use a different finger?
Thanks and I agree about the chest. I don't use a rack for OHP and squat uses a different one. Probably should have used the smith machine for BP to progress on weight. But I have a buddy now so he'll be able to assist me on barbell BP. 
Maybe. I'm using 4.6.1 and it works fine but probably can't install it if you're not jailbroken.
It's fucked, same on 5S 8.1. If you're jailbroken you can download the older version that works fine.
Figured since it threw some errors. Will try again.

Edit: Sent you an email.
So it creates a list of all the installed tweaks? Since the zip is only 1kb. 
Thank you, managed to get it working and jailbreak.
Tried that but it's in chinese and get an iTunes error right at the start. Probably should downgrade iTunes?
Wasn't it sold? Depends on the price.
Any movement on the iPhone price?
Get a new screen probably.
Well Querrey broke back when Nole was serving at 5-4 to win the set so it will be tough
Novak
Probably HBO Go app.
About two months now. I have 4-5 tiny scratches on the screen and a ding on the silver edge but that would probably happen to the original too.
I have the same one, it's good. Capacitive buttons light up fine, notification LED is strong and glass feels like OEM. (probably not gorilla glass though)
Probably has a lighter flywheel aswell (same was said about 1.6 being happier to rev vs the 1.8)
Is it possible to change the distance from the lenses to my eyes? It's a bit blurry but clears up if I hold it further from my face. Would need thicker padding.
https://twitter.com/sanholobeats/status/739479518012932096
That's why sample packs exist haha.
Yes there was tracking. Not sure about GG and don't want to try. :D I have a few small scratches after 2 months of use but I got that on every phone (even iPhone 6) Don't use a screen protector. There seems to be a little oleophobic coating since I don't get much rainbow effect after finger swipes. :)
I bought this, no scratches on the screen or frame, was as new.

http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Brand-new-LCD-Display-Touch-screen-Digitizer-with-frame-For-OnePlus-ONE-free-shipping/32261491537.html

Also the capacitive buttons light up as much as on the original screen and the notification led is as bright as before.
This. Maybe Stronglifts 5x5 if you do that program but Jefit can do it also.
Where'd you get the proteini.si shirt? :D

You can try Chronus widget (looks about the same)

Looks like there's a good offer on the german site at the moment. 2x2.5kg for 50€ which is very cheap. 

You can see MyP whey rank here: https://labdoor.com/rankings/protein

Also chocholate mint flavor tastes good with milk :)
Where are you from? Myprotein is cheap for us EU people. (there are always 20-30% discount codes available)

Install Sopcast, you can then open the video in VLC (but Sopcast will still be running)
It's fucked at the moment yes.
If you got it used it would be best to just wipe everything and flash the latest version via recovery.
Don't think snapprefs is updated anymore.
Are there any tweaks that work with the latest Snapchat? (infinite viewing of snaps, no screenshot notification) Missing this from iOS.
You can simulate a power button press by shorting the pins where the flex cable is soldered.
The second O2 sensor only monitors if the cat is working correctly, it doesn't affect engine performance. (the first O2 does that)

Doubt they would fix it after I replace the screen since it won't be original. And the phone is a bit beat up already.

How do you avoid sweating while wearing cologne? I assume you can't use a deodorant since the scents would mix. Or do you use unscented deodorant/antiperspirant? 

Does it matter what shower gel you use? Or is that not really noticable.
Could you unlock the 5 for international use?
Check the layer properties and see if any colors are blue.

Oh and Grodan/sing sing ID.
You can get the FM happy meal clutch if you plan for more power. Retains the stock feel while sustaining more torque. Otherwise OEM should be plenty.
$450 easy (and even that's a bit low, I got one for $350 with 2 screen cracks)

Put it on Swappa.com
It's server side.
Around $10 in a padded envelope for phone only. :)
Sold or still available? Ship to EU?
Hope it's not the clutch fork :(

http://forum.miata.net/vb/showthread.php?t=514507
Might be the slave then, mine wasn't leaking so couldn't really pinpoint it. Is the clutch reservoir empty? The pedal was soft and the clutch was always engaged. If I wanted to get going I had to turn the car off, put it in first and turn the key while adding some gas which started the car (you're basically pushing yourself using the starter) Then revmatch to shift gears or else it would grind.
Check the clutch reservoir on drivers side. I thought my slave went bad too since the pedal went soft and it turned out a rubber hose split along the way which caused loss of pressure and no clutch action.
Check IL Motorsport (Germany) or ask on MX5Nutz UK forum, they should help.

You can request the unlock via livechat also.

How many miles does it have? Is it a 1.6? The facelift came to Europe in mid/late 2001 so it's still possible to have a NB1 2001. 
Give it a little gas if you're moving slowly and trying to shift into 1st gear, don't force it if it doesn't want to slide in.

You probably explained it on some other post, not this one. I checked your post history and

1. you probably won't be successfull on /r/aww 
2. clicking your link doesn't lead anywhere, it's probably your personal gofundmepage so nobody can see your description, you need to fix that
3. use a self post next time ("Submit a text post") when submitting content (more likely to get upvoted since people won't judge you for whoring for karma points)
4. try a specialized subreddit such as /r/RandomKindness or similar (always check the rules on the sidebar to make sure your post is not deleted)

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?

I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid.

Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

As was mine. But I took it in for black spots on the camera and said it's not covered by warranty anymore because it had a hairline crack at one corner. Called Apple support and managed to get my warranty valid again and had it replaced.

Depends on what you had before, you have to decide if you wanna upgrade when the "S" versions come out or the "normal" ones.
Maybe you can get the 6+ on another line then. Someone will chime in and explain the options.
Probably. :( This is the plan: http://www.att.com/shop/wireless/next.html#fbid=iBQEURJPclq

Or pay the early termination fee but that would cost a lot and not really be a viable option. Or sell the 5s for ~$400 and buy an unlocked 6+ for $850 but that's still a lot of money. You can go on a prepaid plan after your contract runs out which is probably cheaper.
You probably signed a 2year contract when you bought the 5s for $199 so may not be eligible for a $299 6+ this year. Or check out the Next plan or something like that which provides yearly upgrades.
You can sell the 5s for more than $300 if it's in good condition.
Check out Rudimental, Chase & Status (Count on me, End Credits), Wilkinson - Afterglow and more from Sigma (Changing and the remix of My Love).

 Maybe you're already familiar with all of these since they're very commercial. UKF DnB channel has uploaded quite a few similar tunes aswell: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr8oc-LOaApCXWLjL7vdsgw (you can search for "official video" to get more commercial tunes)

It has 105kkm now so around 60k miles. What actually happens when the lifters get noisy? I assume they still get sufficient lubrication but does their acceptable tolerance get out of range? 

Can they seize the engine when they're noisy? I can't hear anything abnormal when sitting in the car and the hood is closed and there's no power loss.

Don't know, I very rarely downshift into 1st while moving. (maybe at 2-3mph max if it's any higher and I need to accelerate I slip the clutch while in 2nd) 1st gear probably doesn't have a syncro so giving it a bit of gas makes it easier to slide into gear without force.
There is almost no wear on the cluch if you rev match on downshifts. Plus you feel like a racekar driver.

Do you have a heated hardtop? I have a matching hardtop too but it's not heated despite the car being a '00.
Sunburst bro.
There's a lot documented on CR.net for that setup so you should know what to expect to make it fit. Just don't ask too many "noob" questions lol. 
You will get some natural camber, don't know if it will be enough. Probably depends on how good you roll the fenders. Do they make the wheels in a higher offset around ET10?


That's what I meant with poke, I really dislike how it looks from the back when the tire sticks out that much. (just my opinion) Can't really see it from the side view though. 
http://clubroadster.net/vb_forum/32-brakes-wheels-tires-sponsored-jscspeed-com/25080-fitment-thread-204.html

Depends if you want a more functional setup with 1-2° camber or try and tuck these under the fenders with 5° camber.

This is with 195/50 probably with pull. Still too much poke for my liking.

Slower acceleration is normal with the AC on. If you turn on AC while idling do the revs go up? (to about 1000-1200)

My AC compressor also starts making some weird noises when I turn it on, the bearings might be going out. :(

Just fucking around. ;) 9000 are good, 2.0 turbos can get to 280hp from 200 with remapping and clutch change, torque steer everywhere.
Another argument I can win with Saab drivers then.
Some Saab guys overfill for the track since big G's can cause the oil pump to suck air because oil flows to one side of the pan. Not sure if this can also happen to a Miata though.
Slow in, fast out. Shouldn't really brake mid-corner, this upsets the balance and shifts the weight forward on front wheels, rear unloads and thus loses grip. You can also fuck up if you downshift mid corner without rev matching.

http://forum.miata.net/vb/showthread.php?t=474988

People also say if you get into an oversteer situation you should not release the throttle (which is the first thing you usually do) http://www.trackhq.com/forums/f304/oversteer-recovery-5190/

It won't stop you any faster, just dissipates heat a little better. Getting better brake pads has a larger effect on braking.
It's also dumb since cups measure by volume so you can't just convert 1 cup of flour to grams and use it with every other ingredient. (cracker crumbs for instance, the weight of one cup is different because of different density)

Didn't know there was a difference, another thing I need to look out for. Damn, 23 us mpg seems like shit now lol. Hope there is't anything wrong but I was on winter tires. 
Around 10l/100km (28mpg) with 90% city driving and about 5 miles each way with some hills. Try to drive in 5th at 1500RPM at 30mph limit.

Doesn't really get worse mileage when I decide to have some fun hillclimbing the twisties though so that's a plus.
Video or it didn't happen.
Do you have a sub in the car? 
Mine heats fast too, but you can't trust the coolant gauge since it has a very wide range where the dial sits in the middle. Oil should take some more time to get to operating temp so you shouldn't trash it right away.

I also read some people can put their hands on the cam cover without burning but mine is always hot.

Cool, just interested how it works since I don't have any experience with surface modelling. Was looking at different tutorials for organic shapes and such and wondered if you can make an exact replica.
Do you just eyeball all the curves and stuff so it looks as close to the original as possible? Then just send a STL file to the CNC and it gets machined?

Try to get some quotes for the repair, probably needs a new rear quarter panel welded in and then painted which is ~$300 alone.

This is probably it, mine did the same two times now, once when coming to a red light. Left it to cool for 20 minutes and started right up. Has no problems starting cold.

You can try blowing compressed air over the cam sensor when it dies to see if it starts when the sensor is cooled down.
Yea, Vmaxx classics and maybe FM springs later depending on ride quality. Probably won't put the wheels on until I get the coilovers since it looks dumb with such poke and height.
