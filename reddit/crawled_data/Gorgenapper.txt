He literally became Rover's chew toy, just like the hard af antlers and rawhide bones I buy for my dog that look indestructible, but are quickly disposed of.
It's a design that probably should never have made it into the approval stage, there are few things more aggravating and potentially dangerous than a balky transmission.
Hell yes, I'd even record it and listen to his voice every night as I go to sleep. 
168 sounds lucky in Chinese, btw. I learned this when I was looking at something in Venice and I was like...wtf why is it exactly $168.
I believe Honda didn't have an equivalent transmission with 8 - 10 speeds at the time, and they thought they could get away with using the ZF9. It probably seemed like a win-win because one of its salient features is improved fuel economy by using those dog clutches to cruise without needing to slip the friction plates in a normal friction clutch.

No about it though, the development of their new 10 speed transmission is Honda finally coming to terms with the crappiness of the ZF9 and deciding to spend on R&D. I blame the attitudes of the Honda CEOs before Mr. Hachigo took over, they were too focused on saving money and not letting engineering have a say in the way Honda was being run.
This isn't even the half of it! The original animation is way, way longer and starts off with the big bang and moves on through all of evolution.
http://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2014/02/zfs-9-speed-9hp-transmission-puts-dog-clutches-on-the-leash/

I found an explanation of the ZF9 in the TLX and why it lurches. Basically (if I understand correctly) the car cuts power for a brief moment in order to align the teeth on the dog clutches so that they smoothly engage and 'lock' together. Does it also lurch when changing from 7 to 8?
Thanks for the TSB, I was specifically listening to my car as it started up after I got out of work and I didn't detect any rattling or knocking noises with the windows up (as described in the TSB).  Fingers crossed ....
*checks VIN*

Well shit.  What do you mean by upgraded chain but shitty VVT?  What kind of noise are you hearing, and how should I go about listening for it... like wind the windows down, listen for a loud ass rattle, or something...?
This is option C\+

Do you own a dog?  They all do that when they get up from lying on the ground.  Mine gets up and shakes herself.
If a real Speed6 came back, my financial decision would be a foregone conclusion. As of right now I'm basically waiting to see how an Acura TLX Type\-S would look like with the new turbo V6, or I'm going to blow my top and get a next gen Lexus IS350 AWD F\-Sport.  A 6MT Mazdaspeed 6 with AWD, 2.5T making 300\+hp / 300\+ lb\-ft would make me sprint to the nearest Mazda dealer...
Wait, what?  Is your VVT rattling yet?  I have a 2010 Speed 3 as well and I have not heard any rattling noises upon startup.  How much do you think it'll be to do this repair?
You can't.  He's saying that Mazda has an AWD system, a 2.5T engine, the MT from the MS6/MS3 and a wagon body Mazda 6.  Put all of these things together to get a MS6 wagon.

What do you think of its acceleration from a dead stop? Like, is it easy to get going from 1st without bogging down in 1st - 3rd? Do you notice any turbo lag? The Civic Type-R is still one of the cars I am looking at as an upgrade in a few years. I'm mainly looking at AWD vehicles but it's not set in stone yet.
There's a distinct possibility that the STI will get a hybrid system of some sort when it is redesigned. Some Subaru exec was talking about it and hinted as much...but we'll see.

[Nope](https://youtu.be/dO-omryaZSU). He says it at some point.

No I mean...I understand why Mazda couldn't really do it, but an engineer went on video saying that they didn't put a manual in because the AT kept the engine in an optimal rpm range. According to him, a manual wouldn't have been as fun to wring out due to the characteristics of the 2.5T. I would have been more understanding if he had just said that the current manuals couldn't handle the torque.

I am Bratwurstman
I'm now craving a Double Whopper with cheese and bacon 🥓
I'm really happy that Honda did this, what with the competition not offering MT with the more powerful engines ^^coughmazda , or not at all. 
The Highlander has the better V6 and transmission (the V6 is the 2GR-FKS which will not suffer from carbon build up on the valve due to the port/do).  The ZF9 transmission in the Accord should be avoided, no amount of software programming can get around the fact that dog clutches need that moment of hesitation in order for the teeth to line up.
The RAM costs more than my computer
The LC500 still has a V8, but I think Lexus is pointing the way forward with the TTV6.  It'll get a test run in the LS, then I'm sure it'll come to the LC, then down to the F models (eventually).
Nah, looks like a younger Ittosai.
Canada used to get the RWD version of the IS350, now it's all AWD except for the IS300 which also comes in RWD with a 2.0T.
I heard once that the engines on modern German cars are great, except for the supporting parts like pumps, hoses, etc.
Oh alright, I can accept that(but it would also mean that less coolant is being pumped). But VAG is just *notorious* for their shit quality pumps in general, like, spend money on THAT rather than on useless shit like gorilla glass over the gauge cluster.
Underrated comment. These award companies sell the right to mention their award in advertising material. This should be raising all kinds of red flags.
>electric coolant pumps

So...just regular VAG things malfunctioning? Business as usual.

Edit: 

>Audi recalled the same vehicles last year and dealers did a software update. But the company says in documents posted Tuesday by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that pump problems continued.

.....really?

The answer is money. Designers try to shave literal pennies off the cost of parts, production costs go up hand in hand with complexity and customer purchase decisions are made to within hundreds of dollars. Car manufacturers spend on the things that impress you the most off the showroom floor like a nice steering wheel, infotainment, comfortable seats. They will *not* spend on a part that most people will likely never touch for the life of the vehicle.
Yeah, I think they had to use the 6 speed because the 8 couldn't fit, or didn't work, with the AWD system.
http://www.lexus.com/models/RC/specifications/rc-350-f-sport-awd

This says that it has a 6 speed (AWD).
If you spam 'woo jackpot' he sounds like a gibbon
What do you think?  Is it quick enough 0 - 60?
I remember that pic from years ago.  It looks like crap on the regular Mazdas, and it's tolerable on the speed 3 (but still looks weird when you look at it head on).
Same.  I've seen RC350s running around town and always thought they looked sleek and awesome, like a stretched out 370z kinda.  But... it weighs 3900lbs (WTF, really?), that awful front wheel gap, slow 6 speed transmission, body roll, no AA/AC...all for like $64k CAD before tax!  

Now I wonder if the AWD IS350 is also like this because it weighs about 3800lbs too, and it has the same engine.
It might actually be, since it's on the TNGA platform and it's hella lighter (330lbs lighter) with the same engine (2GR-FKS).  
Back = upshift.  Forward = downshift.

The reason is simple - as you accelerate from 1st to 2nd to 3rd, you're typically pushed back in your seat as you accelerate quickly, with each push coming at each gear change.  Pushing forward feels unnatural.  As you decelerate coming up to, say, a stop sign you're no longer pushed back into your seat.  Pushing forward feels more natural now.
I am uniquely qualified.  ^^see ^^flair

My theory is only slightly different than the main theory.  I don't think the Tower is meant to produce a single god.  

I think the purpose of the Tower is to produce 'angels' for God.  When Jahad found out the truth behind the Tower's purpose, he locked away access to the higher floors in an effort to change the fate of himself and everyone else in the Tower.  Enryu was sent by God to reopen the Tower.

But why didn't Enryu just kill Jahad?  I think Jahad somehow manipulated Enryu into killing the Administrator, then purposely left the Thorn behind with the pretense of it being a weapon to kill Jahad with (since it can apparently control Shinsu, and maybe override the contracts which keep Jahad from being killed).  In reality, Jahad wants that weapon so he can break out of the Tower and kill God.

The reason why I believe this is because nothing in Tower of God is that simplistic.  I refuse to believe that Baam is just going to climb the tower, get powerful, kill Jahad and become the new King or reopen the path to the higher floors and somehow ascend to Godhood.
>Shifts are very fast and the gearing is fantastic. There is no speed that this car is caught in a dead rpm zone. All of that is amplified if you active sport mode. Shifting firms up a lot and it holds gears. 

I think we're seeing a gradual shift back to torque converter + lockup clutch setups in some performance vehicles (rather than using a dual clutch) because of excellent transmissions like the ZF8.
Are you actually tempting fate?!
Don't forget Child Emperor.
I'm not sure you realize how stupid your statement is.
It's not even 'free' money either.  It's YOUR money, returned to you by the government after they borrowed it for a year at 0%. 
I guess we shouldn't have joked about the Lancer Evo becoming a CUV, just like the Eclipse Cross.
Thanks!  Two months later, my (former) favorite mainstream brand releases a turbo family sedan with a 6AT...and a Mazda engineer goes on record saying a MT is 'not ideal' to keep that engine in its power band.  The Mazda 3 has lost its independent rear suspension in favor of a torsion beam setup.  Then Jakub from TheStraightPipes asks Masamichi Kogai (Mazda CEO, NA) about Mazdaspeed and gets a loud, emphatic 'NO'.  I don't have a problem with Mazda moving to be a more premium manufacturer, but there is nothing left for me (and that's fine).

There hasn't been a Mazdaspeed 3 for 5 years, and I highly doubt it'll ever come back now, with the FWD hatch competition so fierce and thirsting for blood like with the Veloster N, Focus ST, Golf GTI, and the Civic Type-R...all of which come with a 6 MT.  If Mazda were to try, they have to really go ALL in or they'll flop, and there is no way they'll do that with the SCCI engine on the way and the brand slowly recovering.

In short...my speed 3 has become a sort of rare beast now, and I feel more attached to it than ever before because of the way Mazda is turning out.  This is why I still believe that Hyundai is displaying its strength by going after the enthusiast market firmly, and wholeheartedly.  
It'd be strange if he didn't show fear, he did see Jahad's monster form (or whatever it was).  Plus it's Jahad, the King of the tower, naturally he should be fearful.
If Baam loses, he dies.  MC does not die, so therefore Baam will not lose.  Jahad is not likely to show him mercy if he wins, so it's basically a given that Baam will find a way to eke out a victory here somehow.
If I could, I would get a Mustang GT in Ingot Silver, 6MT, performance pack.

Unfortunately, I cannot deal with a Mustang as my only car and DD, and it's kind of pissing me off because I really do want one...but can't justify it because it isn't practical. 
Hold off on modding it until at least a couple of months or longer.  If there's anything wrong with it, you need to figure it out before you add the mods otherwise you won't know whether it was the mods that caused the issue.  

I suggest going on vwvortex and start reading up about your model and year.  Fix any major issues first before you start doing anything custom to it.
This is exactly it.  It's fine if he didn't believe in the big 3, but when Toyota is moving at the pace of grandma with a walker, it's for a very good reason.

Be careful what you wish for.
Yeah, the 2GR-FKS in the Tacoma makes 278hp. The exact same engine in the Lexus IS350 produces 311hp and it's still understressed! I was [reading about the engine](http://kaizen-factor.com/from-fse-to-fks-the-evolution-of-toyotas-2gr-3-5-liter-v6/) and it's laughable to suggest that Toyota is sitting on its ass 'reusing' the same V6 over and over and not going to little overstressed turbo I4s. The [list of new features](http://www.toyotareference.com/guts/tacoma16_engine.pdf) is staggering.
I feel like the design is good except for the parts where the product designers and engineers conspired to eke out that last bit of performance. They also love to find creative new ways to solve a problem that could have been addressed much earlier in the design, or solved using tried and true methods. On top of this, their parts quality is absolutely shit.

As for the previous owner stories, VW fanboys love to swoop in and talk about how VW has had problems in the past but it's 20XX now and these issues no longer exist. It's as if they think that underlying and systemic problems can be erased in an instant because they've owned their VW for less than 3 years.
I saw one of the new Camrys driving around yesterday, a silver XSE V6, and I honestly did a double take as I had that split second where my brain was telling me that it was not a Camry. Its side profile was similarly double take inducing, not to mention the quad exhaust.
> $500,000 down or something.

Is this bush league hour or something, that $500k is to get **in** the door, not for the actual order itself.
Toyota's 2GR series of 3.5L V6 engines (2GR-FE, 2GR-FSE, 2GR-FKS).  Toyota uses them across a ton of products, and in some Lexus models as well.  The entire philosophy of the 2GR can be summed up as "overbuilt, but understressed".
Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
No reeeeeeeeeeeee-placement for displacement!!

Welp, can't say that I'm surprised and I can't blame Mazda either.  In fact, it's looking even more likely that I'll have to sacrifice the MT to get what I want, which is a hatch/wagon/sedan that is AWD, has at least 300+hp along with top notch reliability.
I really wonder why VW can't make a car just as reliable as Toyota.  They have the same level of technology, their engineers and designers are both top notch, they have access to the same tools and facilities for R&D and testing.  I can only see this as coming down to parts quality and design choices.
Oh you mean... the ramp DOES connect to the overpass, but she got onto the middle of the overpass before the zombies managed to follow her up the ramp.  So instead of them seeing the ramp and knowing that they have to follow it to get her, they gather beneath the overpass because they only see the most direct route (straight up 50ft), and not the roundabout way (the ramp).  

I'm assuming she probably shot any stragglers that made their way up the ramp behind her, but the majority of the zombies got to the overpass as she was already on top and in the middle looking down at them, attracting their attention.
... brakes are not an option.
Sorry... I understand what an overpass is, and what a ramp is, but I don't see how the ramp doesn't directly connect to the overpass.  Meaning, if cars can get up the ramp and onto the overpass, and she can do the same without climbing something or hopping over a gap (which she could not have done, given her injury), then the zombies should be able to do the same.
[Yeah, you really didn't have a clue until the end when she gets to da chopper and the Cajun dude is like "wtf you talking about?".  Although I have a question - how did she escape the zombies behind her by going up the ramp?  Can't they follow her up the ramp too?](#spoiler)

Sadly, Mazda doesn't have the spare money to do that.  They don't even have a replacement for my speed 3, which is still going strong after 7.5 years but I'm about ready for a change to something that's AWD and at least 300+hp....

If you are reading any reliability scores from JD Powers, or other consumer publications other than Consumer Reports, just keep in mind that companies pay these guys for the right to mention their award when marketing their stuff.  For example, if JD Powers says that Hyundai/Kia and Audi have taken top spots in initial quality, you will see Hyundai/Kia use that in their marketing - after paying JD Powers for the right to say that in their ads.

Basically, JD Powers sells prepackaged advertising 'data'.
VW owners and fanboys have been saying literally the same thing every year that the GTI and R are sold - "*this model year is fine, all of the problems happened in the past*", or "*it's not 20XX anymore*".  

You'll excuse me for not believing that crap, especially on the heels of a massive diesel emissions scandal coupled with the fact that the current VW CEO is Herbert Diess, who came from BMW and was infamous for squeezing suppliers (which would explain BMW's abnormal part failure rate).
So what actually happens to Germa and the Sun Pirates at the end of the chapter?  I get that Mama is furious and has sworn revenge on Luffy, but will Germa and the Sun Pirates get away now?

It was too ridiculous for people to believe, which is what allowed for the zombie virus to spread everywhere until it was too late. Then Yonkers happened, leading to the Great Panic.

In reality, even slow moving zombies are a massive threat because all it takes is literally **one** zombie and you'll end up with a horde before you know it. It doesn't even have to bite you, you can get infected from the blood and flesh entering your bloodstream.

The infection spreads because it isn't immediately fatal, so the infected person hides the injury and attempts to live normally until they suddenly collapse. They know that if they reveal that they're infected, they'll be quarantined and possibly killed.


You cannot truly win until you eliminate the absolute last zombie, and that's the takeaway at the end of the book - the war is 'over' but it really isn't because there are literally millions of zombies in the sea and in lakes / ponds, maybe some left under ground, maybe all of North Korea is zombified, many of the world's islands are crawling with zombies, etc.

Get rid of Redeker and the whole Mandela thing altogether. Write in a part where the US military realizes that the civilian centers were drawing the zombies away from the war production areas, have a military tribunal or a meeting of generals shoulder the blame for the Redeker plan.

There's a YouTuber who pushes Deutsche Auto Parts and works on VW products. He made a video to answer the question about whether VWs are reliable, and I swear to God, he spent a good 20 or 30 mins talking about random shit and dodging the question.

Alright, I can totally accept the reason for wanting AWD as I've had to drive through some very nasty snow weather lately, and I still remember some horrendous winter driving I have had to do on the highway and on city streets in past years.  You may not always need AWD, but for those days of the year when it matters, that's when it all pays off...
What were the lease terms like for the R/T 392?  Or did you want the AWD because of the snow?
I'm okay with that >_>  Just bring it back!
This AWD Challenger just seems like a severely compromised vehicle to me.  Combined with its AWD system, it is already too heavy for that V6 (which sounds like absolute dog shit), it has wheels and tires that are far too narrow, it has a slow transmission and a cheap interior.

On top of this, the one in this video costs **$45k** CAD (assuming that it's before tax).  The MSRP of the base AWD GT is $39245, which is only $2400 less than the 5.7L V8 R/T.

Assuming you were stupid enough to have paid $45k for this AWD GT, the much more powerful 6.2L V8 is available on the R/T 392, which starts at $52440, or roughly $7500 more.  Personally speaking, I would rather deal with RWD and save up another year in order to get the R/T 392 rather than waste $45k on the AWD GT.
If only it came with a 6MT and AWD.  A Mazda engineer explained that the 2.5T Mazda 6 used an auto transmission because 'it kept the engine in the power band more often'.  Like...that's not the point of a 6MT....
There is no question that Hyundai is gunning for the top, but they still need to pay attention to the quality of their cars manufactured at all of their facilities, and to keep at it for the long term.  I just heard of a Hyundai recall of over 1.5m vehicles where the engine may suddenly seize due to debris left behind during the manufacturing process (a coworker of mine had to leave his 2014 Santa Fe at the dealer this morning).  Canada doesn't get the super long Hyundai/Kia warranty of 10 years 100k miles, so my coworker was within a year of his powertrain warranty expiring.

My point is that it's not enough for JD Powers^* to say that Hyundai and Kia match/beat Toyota and Honda in *initial* quality, they also have to back it up with long term results over their entire lineup, and that will be a monumental task by itself.  That's not to say that Toyota/Honda are flawless (Honda's auto transmissions come to mind), but they earned their reliability reputation for a reason.

^* As a side note, JD Powers and many other such publications make manufacturers pay for the right to mention that their vehicle won a particular award.  Personally speaking, I wouldn't be able to bring myself to take these awards at face value.

Well... I think there are two differences here.  One, Ford owns the factory, while Apple doesn't own Foxconn.  Two, Ford has the experience to quickly set up a production facility almost anywhere they want because they have been doing it for a long time, and they have existing examples to draw upon.  Apple has the specifications for their products, but I don't think they have the experience in production line manufacturing to actually do it themselves.

In both cases, skimping to save a buck is likely going to cause either company harm (remember Bendgate?) so both setups will work satisfactorily as long as the quality is maintained.

China can make high quality items...if you pay them, and get on their ass about consequences if they deviate from the original design.  This is really no different than any other place in the developed world.  

There's a reason why Foxconn basically jumps 10ft in the air and performs backflips every time Apple twitches a finger.  My current winter jacket is a Fjallraven Yupik (Swedish co.), and it is the best jacket I've ever had the pleasure of owning, it is also made in China. 
Both of these companies (Apple and Fjallraven) have strict quality controls in place, and it shows.

However, there are still a ton of products coming out of China that are trash because these particular factories have no incentive to adhere to a high quality standard.  It really depends on the product, and on the quality controls in place.

I like how people are writing off 10km a day run, 100 pushups/sit-ups/squats **every day** as average training. It's not average, it's seriously intense.

You have to do it every single day, no rest or cheat days, in any weather, no matter if you get sick or if you stub a toe or whatever. The fact that you have to do it no matter what is the hard part.

On top of this with respect to One Punch Man, Saitama also fought monsters practically non stop AND he was holding down 2 jobs to pay for his apartment and food. So he also got injured and beat up, doesnt make enough money to eat well, and still managed to go through his training anyway.

The Accord dipstick is exactly how it should be done, and it isn't even that hard to make the Civic version halfway decent - just remove that orange plastic, add some hatchmarks on the metal and you're done. I dare say that it's probably even worse than the [one in the 2012 Civic](http://i42.tinypic.com/vi15h.jpg) because the latter has cross hatching at least!

Yeah, that's my thought exactly. I like your gym analogy because ripping muscles is how they get stronger (after they rebuild themselves), I'm just saying that this could be a potential application of the quirk's power as it is manifested in Deku. All Might got super buff when using his power, but Deku doesn't - his power is more like vital energy that is circulated throughout his body, which is what got me to thinking of how to use it as 'armor'. 
I got a close look at it at a Honda dealership and it was appalling how bad it was compared to the previous generation.

* the plastics in the interior were a sea of beige and shit brown, and the quality of the plastic was like those round taco containers that you get at a TexMex restaurant with the same look, same 'fibres' and same feel

* parking brake felt hollow and had a cheap, dull silver paint with a plastic button

* the interior of the driver's door was so flimsy you could deform it with light hand pressure

* the dipstick wasn't even metal, it was straight up orange plastic and you could barely see the oil on it

This car was apparently developed during the 2008 crisis, and the chief engineer was **squeezed** to cut the cost as much as possible to the point where he said that he "had his pants down and had nothing else left to give".  Honda didn't understand that people DON'T want to be reminded of how much they were negatively affected by the meltdown.  What better way to remind them of the harsh realities of life than to force them to drive in a literal shitbox to and from work?  If you're going to do cheap, then do it on another model of car like Kia is doing with the Rio.  Each successive generation of Civic is supposed to be better than the last, to make it *worse* is unforgivable. 
It's essentially armor, right? I was thinking of All Might's warning that heroes should not rely on their support gear otherwise they would be too dependent on them when they have to fight without it.

I'm getting a Tremors vibe off the first 30s of the video lol (in case people don't remember, it's the part where Val and Earl rejoin the freeway after they finish hammering in a wire fence).
I never knew about the reactor! It's really a clever way to change the swirl direction and pressure of the transmission fluid and it all happens mechanically.
I much prefer the traditional lever shifter with clearly defined shift points because I'm already so used to it, and I can shift between P, R N and D without needing to look for the button and press it.  If the buttons were all laid out in a row like the one on the [2019 Acura RDX](http://hanabi.autoweek.com/sites/default/files/styles/gen-1200-675/public/rdx19_p015.jpg), then it might be a different story because I know that P is the furthest button from me, R is a button that I have to pull back on, and D is the round button in the middle. Knob shifters are stupid af, and have no place in any vehicle.

It started off as Experience Nothingness, then it got tweaked to Experience Oblivion shortly after the skin was released. Zen mains everywhere thought this was generally a bad idea because the latter voice line sounded too upbeat, while the Nothingness line was way more menacing because of the drop in the tone of the voice line.

Oh... I didn't know that.  On a side note, where do you buy stronger centering springs?  The ones on my speed 3 are on a full metal replacement short shifter assembly and they're not the best.
Can't you fold the rear seats down and crawl in to pull the trunk release?  I mean, I wouldn't want to do this every day, but I think this should work in a pinch.
Ahem ... Dr Gerth.
I've noticed that (in my car, anyway) the tach needle does not exactly correspond to the actual revs.  I verified this by using my Cobb AP and the needle was consistently reading higher than the AP's digital readout once I got past like 4k or so.

Also, next time you're shifting from a high to low gear, you can just rely on the shifter centering spring to reduce the likelihood of a moneyshift.  Just pop the shifter out of 5th/6th while lightly holding onto it, allowing the centering springs to bring it to center, then pull back directly for 4th gear.  In other words don't grab onto the shifter with a death grip and try to guide it yourself into 4th, allow the centering spring that split second to center it first.

But seriously, I was a Bastion and set up inside of the dropship in turret mode.  I killed a heavy, then a whole bunch of trash mobs and I was looking around, thinking that our Pharah was flying outside so that our team could wipe out all the enemies.  

All I heard was "Gather together!" and "Group up with me!" in voice lines, and I was confused as to why the ship wasn't taking off.  That's when I turned around and saw all 3 of my other team mates teabagging me from behind while spamming the lines.  Soon as I turned back into Recon mode, the ship took off....

When you floor something that is RWD and has 460hp / 420lb-ft, your rear tires are spinning fast enough to lose traction.  The front tires are still gripping onto the asphalt and turned into one direction, and the heaviest part of your car is your engine bay, so your car will naturally pivot because the rear has no traction and the front is still holding on tight.

If you panic and jam on the brakes (a natural reaction to an 'oh shit' situation) or [lift off the throttle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift-off_oversteer), that's when you're fucked because there is now weight transfer from the rear to the front, causing you to exit off the road and into a crowd of onlookers tail-first.

Even Lexus has a TTV6 in the LS, and Acura will soon have a turbo V6 of their own.
Also, WRX CVT gets a different version of AWD system compared to the same car in a 6MT. The former is like a stripped down version of the STI (center diff with electronically actuated LSD) while the latter is a viscuous coupling.
>The interior was literally all hard plastic

Plastic from the taco containers at a Tex Mex. The ugly fibres mixed in with the plastic seals the deal. The parking brake was cheap as fuck and you could literally bend the door panel from the inside with hand pressure.

No words are spoken (initially) yet the two of them are drawn together before the mirror.  On one side, the tall figure of Galadriel dressed in white, glowing with an inner power.  On the other...a short, barefoot hobbit in farmer pants.  The only common thread tying them together is that they're Ring bearers and thus equal in status, because only they know what its like to bear a Ring of Power.

The part which I like the most about this scene is when Galadriel gives a faint smile, then [starts pouring the water from the ewer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3VOf3CBGvw&t=0m40s) while keeping her eyes on Frodo.  She dips the ewer as she explains in a slow, cadenced voice that he will see things that were, then *raises it* when saying "things that are" (clearly there is symbolism in the lowering and raising of the ewer).  You can just barely see her eyes look up from the mirror and back at Frodo with a slightly sly, knowing look as she finishes off with a faster paced "and some things...that have not yet come to pass" to give it more emphasis, while stepping back and bringing the ewer closer to herself, like she has said enough and the secrets of the future (poured out from the ewer) are now there for Frodo to reach out and take.

One thing to note is that Frodo doesn't realize how much of a burden the Ring is, or how exceedingly dangerous it is, until after Galadriel nearly takes possession of it - only managing to pull herself back in the nick of time, as if she had been about to fall off a cliff.  Also... I have a suspicion that Galadriel subtly manipulated Frodo into seeing that desolate future and into willingly offering the One Ring to her.
I find it interesting that there are people betting against Toyota *after* seeing the marvel that is the 2GR-FKS.  It really doesn't lose out against the turbo I4s in terms of fuel efficiency and emissions, but it has all of the advantages you mentioned and more besides, such as port/direct injection with self-cleaning cycles to keep that carbon away, Otto and Atkinson cycles, and so on.

It doesn't have a finicky turbo that's sensitive to oil temperature and quality, there is no turbo lag, it doesn't have to run as hot or work as hard under WOT, and it sounds hell of a lot better. Also, Toyota has been developing the 2GR series of V6 engines for over 14 years now, it'd be foolish to ignore all of that work and develop a new series of turbo I4 engines when they could simply keep refining the V6 for longer. It also gives them a differentiating point vs the other players in the segment.
Is that big breeder orb looking to betray Jahad?  I get that feeling, that he wants to break free of Jahad and either leave the hell train or something.
I think we were foreshadowed by Baam absorbing his sworn enemy.  According to the game world, a sworn enemy won't stop until it is slain, but Baam rewrites the rules and absorbs his copy into the orb through his control of shinsu.  He broke apart the sworn enemy construct using his own rules.

The largest difference (no pun intended) is the length. The GTI is 168", the Accord is 192"...that's a **24"** gap between the two. The Accord's 10 speed is a brand new unit, but I don't know if the new 7 speed DSG in the GTI is also brand new or lifted from another model and put into the Golf for the first time. I feel like DSG is more complicated based on some stuff I've [read](https://www.quora.com/How-bad-is-a-DSG-transmission-for-auto-transmissions-overall) but dat 6 year warranty tho. Also, I believe the GTI is made in Puebla while the Accord is made in Marysville.

Overall, I also believe the Accord is more reliable than the GTI, despite the new 10 speed Honda auto.

How much is the GTI vs the Accord?

They believe that only a stage 1 tune can save their engine from blowing up, so they get an AccessPort and slap an off the shelf calibration on it, and use only the freshest olive oil at 3k oil change intervals.

In reality, the EJ is just a massive piece of shit and you just can't change that without a full rebuild.

The narrator even says to hold it in place until it goes into P.
Interestingly enough, I tend to look to Toyota to see what they think the 'right' thing to do.  All of their new cars, including Lexus models, still have the traditional shift lever with locking positions.  No teaching required, just press a button, shift to D and go.  When you park, press the button, shift to P, exit the car.  So fucking ez.
In the link that I provided, there's a video from FCA to teach users how to use the transmission lever.  I think that's where I saw that you had to hold it in the 'P' position for a little bit before it recognizes that it should be in park.  It's been a while since I've watched the video.
It's likely that his Jeep wasn't even in park in the first place.  If I recall, the shift lever (illustrated [here](https://jalopnik.com/heres-the-problem-with-jeeps-recalled-gear-shifter-1782364420)) was designed such that he had to push all the way up to P and **hold it for a couple seconds**.  You don't have to do this with a traditional analog shifter.

Edit:  here is the [instructional video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUWVYrpd-3g&t=1m32s) from FCA where the driver is clearly shown pushing it into P and having to hold it in place.  The narrator even says to hold it there until it shifts into park.
53 regular maintenance records, no major issues... or issues at all.  That would be insane if it had been practically any other manufacturer, but for Lexus it's normal.  I assume that the previous owner didn't push it hard or use it for anything other than daily driving around Florida, but still!

>The saddest part, is that I would have saved some money by just being stupid from the get go. So it was stupid to be smart then be stupid. Should've been stupid from the start. And I was too stupid to realize that being stupid was smart. Ugh.

See my reply to you earlier.  This is exactly what I'm talking about.  The trick is to be reasonably stupid lol.
Being practical and financially savvy is very important...but you have to enjoy your life too - within reason.  You can think of it as an allocation of resources.  If you have the ability to allocate resources towards a new car that you don't really want (2016 Elantra), then consider putting those same resources towards something that you actually want (Mustang).  

In other words, the $15k towards the Elantra would be akin to 'wasting' money that could have otherwise gone towards the Mustang.  It's like buying a shitty Columbia 3-in-1 winter jacket for $350 and shivering your butt off all winter, then buying a Fjallraven next year for $500 and staying toasty warm.  If you had been a little more careful in your purchase, you could have spent that $350 towards the $500 jacket instead of having it go to waste.  Ask me how I know. (yes, I know that the Elantra can be sold and some money can be recouped, but it's still wasted money)

Of course, this depends on the cost of the higher-priced item so don't go putting your Elantra money towards an RS5 any time soon, but I imagine that a $15k down payment on a V6 Mustang is going to significantly reduce the overall cost of your finance loan.

At the end of the day, your quality of life is absolutely affected by your happiness level, so why force yourself to be unhappy inside **and** outside of your car?  If your car drives like shit, you're unhappy.  If you look with envy at your friends' cars, you're also unhappy.  Put the two together and you're unhappiness squared... that's no way to live.  
This is so true.  My sister in law (who works in a professional job) ditched her '08 Civic for a 328i, which has since been beat to hell inside and out, and now the engine is threatening to blow its timing chain tensioner (thanks BMW engineering!).  It's the equivalent of a BMW Civic and has less options and less comfort than my 'lowly' speed 3.  But hey... roundel badge!  Gotta keep up with her colleagues, friends from school, etc.
A BMW badge would work especially well, since the Kia 'tiger nose' grille vaguely resembles the double kidneys that BMW uses.

My left leg game is very strong.
Normal ice in the real world is going to get melted by lava, if the quantity is the same. All Aokiji has to do is to produce more ice than magma and he will win, as the temperature of magma is the most terrifying part of it. 

As for outproducing Akainu, keep in mind that there is more water on the surface of the world than there is magma - water exists in the oceans, air, in the ground, in one's body, etc. As Aokiji uses his freezing power, the water around him should also get frozen into more ice.

As the ice is melted by magma, the remaining liquid water will also act as a secondary heat conductor, producing massive amounts of steam. It's a known fact that water is able to provide a 'barrier' against molten metal / rock because it flashes into steam upon contact. Look up YouTube videos on a dude running his hands through a stream of molten metal.


Mochi is not an element like fire, lightning, ice, snow, swamp, etc.
Given Glasses' determination not to be bound by his limits, is there any possibility of him becoming a second Saitama?  We have so many incredibly strong heroes and characters that are hundreds of times stronger than Glasses', but perhaps it takes a special and sudden insight to realize that one's limits are an artificial barrier that can be overcome.  This is why someone like Suiryu can get so freakishly strong, but still cannot break past his limits because he accepted defeat and gave up.

It's sad af.
Neither are awakened, right?  Not that we know what an awakened Logia looks like because we've never been officially introduced to one....
Pugatron must be stopped...no matter the cost!
We know that awakened Paramecias can transform the environment around them into the element - Doflamingo and Katakuri demonstrated this power. Doflamingo can't use the string landscape to heal himself or power up as he generates and manipulates strings, but maybe Katakuri could have eventually learned how to restore himself by merging into the mochi and leaving his injuries behind.

Back to Aokiji and Akainu, they're able to transform into their elements of ice and magma, respectively. Naturally, I'd expect them to gain additional strength when they're surrounded by their own elements, and even more so when whole islands are generating said element for them to keep replenishing themselves with.

[Parking lights](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/1ZEAAOSw7ZlZpolg/s-l1600.jpg) on a car (it's the symbol which looks like two shuttlecocks colliding, between the OFF and the headlight symbols).  They basically act like non-blinking, non-clicking hazard lights.  The name seems quite obvious - they're meant for parking, but streets were narrower and less well-lit back in the day, and cars probably didn't have reflector plates either.  Naturally, you needed some way to let other drivers know that your car is parked there, so you would turn on the parking lights on one side of the car before leaving it.  

Nowadays we no longer have much of a use for this feature and hazard lights are the way to go.  However, I once used this while waiting in my car on the side of a dimly lit airport road because the hazard lights were too blinky and obtrusive.
It is likely that both Aokiji and Akainu are awakened Logias, something that we have never seen before.  During the course of their duel, Aokiji and Akainu were able to alter islands into habitats that suit their powers.  What's interesting is that you'd expect the islands to be a mix of fire and ice, but they're both solely warped by one element and not the other.  In other words, I don't think they actually fought on those islands but rather used them as a home base during the fight.

I think it's possible that awakened Logias can transform their surroundings, then draw upon those elements to replenish their power, which would explain the 10 day long duel.

It's the squeaky wheel system, it'll annoy the fuck out of you until you grease it.  Sometimes the wheel needs grease, which is not a big deal because the time spent fixing the problem pays for itself over the long run.  Occasionally you'll find a major issue that's not lubricant related, such as a loose bolt, or a broken wheel hub, or whatever.  Either way, it's a lose-lose situation if you keep ignoring it.
Ya that's the irony, he believes he invented TPS, but doesn't even know what he doesn't know.  He wants cars to be built at a jogging pace (ie. the production line is moving at a jogging pace) as opposed to the speed in conventional factories that implement TPS, which he referred to as "grandma with a walker" in terms of speed.

Any car company can design a factory to assemble cars at breakneck speed, the trick is to ensure quality at every step of the process and to catch issues before they escalate into major ones.
The guy truly believes he invented the Toyota Production System before Toyota did, that's when you know he's delusional.

I'm not in this type of industry, but I can totally understand the impact that a first impression makes.  We already judge people by the cars they drive because we cannot really see the person inside, nor do we necessarily know the person.  If I see a slammed WRX covered in stickers with vape blasting out the driver's window, I'm likely to have a negative impression of the person driving it despite logic telling me otherwise.

Interestingly...this tendency to make a quick decision based on relatively few visual clues is bred into us, it's a survival instinct that makes the difference between going home safe, or being eaten by a predator.
Why not both?  
>I know a lot of people who don't want a modern day V8 RWD car because it's not good in all weather and they can't fit a bunch of stuff in it. 

This is me and the Mustang GT - I like it, but it has little in the way of practicality for such a huge car. RWD is great when the roads are dry, but I can't imagine that it would handle snow days well even with a set of Blizzaks. I occasionally have to drive down some sketchy country roads after work and they turn treacherous with enough snow and ice. Plus, my dog can't fit in the back seat and I'm not letting her sit in front.

Yeah, it doesn't say '6 seconds immediately preceding the collision', but rather for 6 seconds prior to the collision, which as you've pointed out, could have been much earlier in the drive (such as waiting at a traffic light).

Misleading as fuck, if it's what Tesla intended with their wording.
Reliability. Strictly speaking, a car's purpose is to convey you from A to B, and back. When it can't do that, then you're stuck far from home, calling a tow truck to tow your car to the mechanic, hoping that he's there on a Sunday (he's not).  

You pay $149 for the privilege of getting ripped off on the towing, then you end up calling family or friends to give you a ride to stay at your parents' for the night, then get a ride back on Monday morning and hope that the mechanic will have time for you. 

To cap off your wonderful weekend, you end up borrowing your dad's car to drive 100km home to get a spare part that cannot be sourced that same day, driving back to the mechanic with part in hand, and waiting anxiously as he fixes it up for you.

The forums are saying that the RDX platform is a modified Honda Global Platform for the CR-V, except for extra space to accommodate the SH-AWD and an engine bay for the expected turbo V6 in the RDX Type-S.
Make sure you wear latex or nitrile gloves when using these things.  Incidentally, the Rain-X Extreme Clean does an excellent job of removing haze from headlights, it's essentially a mild polish.

You need something like [this](http://www.qualitydist.net/rnx-5080217.html), Rain-X Extreme Clean.  Apply twice for best results.  The best stuff I've ever used was Permatex No Touch Glass Stripper, but I don't think it's being made anymore.

Edit: You can still buy it from places like [these](https://carcarecaptain.com/shop/glass-care/no-touch-gs8-auto-glass-stripper-8-oz/) but I think it's getting phased out or discontinued, or something.
True... it's said that Subaru is very conservative and decided to stick with their niche strengths of standard full-time AWD across the lineup, boxer engines, high safety ratings and quirky, targeted advertising.  They know that there's a market to be had there that nobody else can really take away from them (not because they can't, but mostly because it isn't worth it).
Oh man, I'd actually be interested in one if it had a TRD Pro trim with the same V6 from the Camry, Toyota DirectShift 8 speed auto and a good AWD system.

I'm a firm believer in Toyota's philosophy of doing something right the first time, then refining it over and over until it is as close to perfect as feasible.  TNGA-L promises to transform the Lexus lineup, and I'm waiting to see its effects when the 4th gen IS350 arrives.
TFW a Corolla looks better than my Mazdaspeed 3.

Toyota and Subaru are separated by only 16 years (Toyota is 80 years old as a company), but the difference between the two is like night and day - Toyota is a global giant, while Subaru is a quirky afterthought.  Part of Toyota's success can be attributed to the way they do business and build their products, but I think that Subaru's reliance on two core technologies and a niche market are what really kept them from being as strong and vibrant as Toyota.

The AWD is great, but that's basically their one trick pony.  Almost nobody comes running into Subaru dealerships looking for premium build quality, beautifully sculpted aesthetics, luxury...or anything, really, except for their AWD systems and for their lifestyle of being vegan, crossfit lesbian birdwatchers who own one or more golden retrievers.  Of the few who are looking for something more than AWD and a particular lifestyle, a large portion of that tiny fraction are enthusiasts like us looking for performance bargains and we know what the market is like for *that*.  Subaru focused so much on AWD that it became a core strength, but also made them too specialized.  In other words, they skipped leg day.

Then there's the boxer engine.  There is basically no advantage to a boxer engine vs inline / V (in cars) other than lower center of gravity, packaging, lower vibrations and the horizontal piston layout being marketed as a unique feature.  EE showed some differences between a boxer and inline engine in a video that was made several months ago, and boxer engines are just heavier, more complex, cost more to make, and cost more to do R&D on because of bottlenecks in their design.  Porsche also uses boxer engines, but unlike Subaru, Porsche prints money and can pay their way out of any bottlenecks.
Yissss give me dat TLX Type-S SH-AWD.  I'm itching to upgrade to an AWD sedan or hatch with at least 300+hp, and I'm anticipating good things for the TLX.
They addressed all of the major issues that I've been having with Acura such as ditching the 9ZF transmission and the beak, bringing back real and exposed tailpipes, and significantly upgrading the interior quality.  The only thing that I don't like (subject to change, of course) is the push button transmission.  Nothing beats a lever-type transmission that 'lock' into the various positions of P R N D and don't reset to center like the BMW sticks.  I have to admit that the push button layout is symmetrical and cleans the interior up, but I think I would still prefer something more tactile and traditional.
I'm down with that.  V6 AWD RAV4 with that Toyota DirectShift 8 speed AT would be so sweet.
But... it already is a two way payload.  If you push, it goes forward.  If you can't push because the defenders are kicking your ass, it goes back (slowly).

This.  I especially hate the ones molded into the bumper, like on the [TLX A-Spec](http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.3179015.1495201981!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/article_1200/nydn-2018-acura-tlx-a-spec-white-rear-quarter.jpg).  They look convincing enough from a distance and even up close, but duck down and peer into those 'tips' and you'll see the tiny little pipes hiding in them.  Such a massive letdown.
The Infiniti Q60 **BS** will never happen.
Out of curiosity...are you leasing or buying? Not that it matters, the S4 is leaps and bounds better than the current TLX in every single way. Things may change when Acura brings out the turbo V6 and the Type-S, but for right now the S4 is simply much better.
Huh...TIL what those metal slats actually were. I had no idea prior to this.

Looks like the TNGA platform is yielding huge benefits for their lineup, with it on the Camry and now on the Corolla. Can't wait to see it rolled out across their lineup, and over the Lexus vehicles as well.
Neither dealer nor customer could reach an accord over the final price.
I think you're right.  I'm reading the web novel and the story telling and writing style took a HUGE leap in quality sometime around when Linley acquired the Bloodviolet.
Why don't you recommend the manga? I'm up to the part where he first gets the Bloodviolet.
/uj in case nobody gets it... someone actually thinks Blizzard GMs write personal thank you notes instead of relying on a form response.
Hey... thanks for bringing up Coiling Dragon, I started reading it.  This could make for a really, really good manga!
There's no way Baam could win against Jahad.  Baam may be growing incredibly fast but he's still like a level 20 vs a level 50 character (with level 100 being the current Jahad outside).  

My theory behind this huge power gap is that Jahad entered the Tower as a full warrior and fought the original divine sea creatures and other monsters / opponents BEFORE all these systematic ranker tests were conceived of.  He tamed the Tower, overcame harder challenges, and simply gained more exp by the time he hit the Hell Train compared to Baam.
Refresh my memory... did the God of Guardians actually say that Zahard (maybe not naming him by name?) fell for the demon, and did not embrace his true power?  And he was concerned that Baam would follow the same path?
I went to the US to help a family member, and I had a choice between shipping their vehicle across several states and flying down to the destination (with family member), or simply driving the vehicle on a 4 day road trip.  I opted for the latter, and I am now feeling very glad that I did (after reading this thread).  

I mean, who knows if the car would have made it in one piece?  Where would they put the car upon shipping it?   I still needed a car to drive around looking for an apartment for my family member...would the car be there when I arrived off the plane?  The cost of the plane tickets + car shipping would have been at least a couple thousand USD.  All of those unanswered questions and variables ultimately led me to decide on driving it myself.
I bought a 2010 Mazdaspeed 3 (Black Mica) back in Dec 2010 at a good discount + 0% financing.  It had 11 km on it, and was manufactured in Hofu City, Japan in Sept 2009.

Pros include:

* plenty quick

* really fun to drive (hydraulic steering, notchy shifter, heavy clutch)

* super practical

* nice tech for the time and price (6 cd changer, bluetooth, auto wiper/headlights, swivelling bi-xenon headlights, push button start).  The nav is a disgrace though, but who cares... my phone does it better in a vent mount.

* nice interior (the color scheme could be a lot better, but the material quality is outstanding)

* great visibility, easy to park

* very reliable (except for the turbo, a known issue that afflicts all Mazdaspeed 3 / CX-7).  Still drives like an almost-new car even after 8 years, with only a minor rattle from the glovebox and some clunking from the suspension sometimes (I suspect the cross brace beneath the cat converter).


Cons:

* FWD

* torquey turbo with lots of lag until 3k

* steering wheel angle sensor cuts your power if you turn the car and apply throttle (I'm not paying for a V3 AccessPort just to fix this)

* looks like shit if you look at it head on

* never buy a black car if you don't want to see your hard work at the car wash go to waste within the hour


I'll be sad to see it go when I decide on my next car in 2 - 3 years, currently planning on the next gen IS350 AWD F-Sport for that Toyota reliability and build quality with at least 311+hp of fun, but I might still decide upon an Acura TLX Type-S if I like it enough when it's out.
I think this scene really showcased just how freaking STRONG Cap is.  He was throwing full grown men around like rag dolls with just one arm, and hard enough to crack glass on impact and KO them.  Nice movie detail where he's shown breathing moderately hard, as if to remind everyone that he's still a human.
I read that he did construction and worked as a grocery store clerk before getting his pay at the hero association.
The point I'm trying to make is that he had to do his routine while working at his job, while coughing up blood, while his bones made weird noises, while he was almost passing out or throwing up. On top of that, he had to deal with injuries from fights. To do all of that every day is the real challenge, to have the willpower to stick it out no matter what, with no excuses.
This isn't creepy or anything  ^^^/s
/r/crossfit my dude...
But make sure you keep doing it even though you're coughing up blood, your arms are making weird cracking noises, you're sweating like a pig and you nearly pass out from all the stinging your body is experiencing.  Oh, and if a monster inflicted injury on you, tough luck, keep up the training Every.  Single.  Day.
Yeah, that's my thought too...things get easier the more often you do them.  Like his consecutive side hops, he probably does his pushups, situps and squats in a few seconds, then goes for a 10km run as a hero looking for monsters to kill, which also add to his training.  I'm not sure how much training he would still need if he is fighting trash mobs and one shotting all of them, but to him it's just a routine now.
I don't know why it's ESPer... ESP stands for Extra Sensory Perception, like mind reading and stuff.  Tatsumaki and Fubuki can't read minds, they're telekinetics.
> while working at his part time jobs and fighting monsters and while sustaining injuries similar to what Suiryu had after the martial arts tournament.

Did you miss this part?
One Thought Man
Yeah, you could hold down 'R' and it would flip between the two videos in real time.
Nothing to do with age, youtube videos that do stupid things to generate clicks are just dumb in general.  Like those people who buy the new iPhones and smash them, Jake Paul's antics, people who run their exotics to triple digit speeds on city streets, etc.
Yeah, I like the attention that is given to Mumen Rider, and that one Blizzard group dude who quit (the support-type hero, because he's still too weak to be anything else).

Also, I can sense that Saitama is disappointed by Suiryu's stated desire to become strong so he can live a carefree life, implying that his attitude / training / philosophy are all parodies of Saitama's.  Suiryu still ended up becoming extremely strong, but he was like a super nerfed Saitama with so much more potential that he was ignoring because of his outlook on life.
Exactly like Reaper from the Halloween event.

"I'll eat your souls!"

*right click 5 orbs into his forehead*
Well...I'm saying that he willpowered his way into his overpowered state.  He kept his training regimen going even when injured, tired, sick, angry...anything.  Even if he had a broken foot, he would have STILL gone for the 10k run.

It's more than just having the strength to change yourself into what you want to be, it's ignoring his limits of pain and endurance and willpower (ie. that whole part about breaking his limiter) and going further, and further.
I'm guessing there is a shortened path from the exhaust manifold to the turbos, and also a shortened path from the compressed air through the intercoolers back into the intake.  
This is the shift technique I use, and I find it especially useful for 2nd -> 3rd.  I used to hit that dead spot between 1st/3rd, but the wrist position in the guide has completely eliminated this for me.
To add to this, I've seen a driving technique where you put your palm on the left of the shift knob, pull it out of 5th and then down into 4th with your hand in that position while relying on the centering spring to keep it in place.  Your wrist position helps to prevent the knob from going into 2nd.
This was my exact thought.  
Question if anybody can answer it... I get why the turbos are in the V between the cylinder banks, but would this cause any issues with heat dissipation, or heat in general?
Well said.  Plus, he was stuck in the vicious cycle of job hunting (which I gather is a HUGE thing in Japan, more so than here in North America) and he just said nuts to this and went to do his own thing.  It speaks to our own desire to drop everything that makes our daily lives miserable, train up, and kill monsters every day with a single punch.
It's actually funnier if you reverse the gif...he's flipping forward and just lands on his ass at the end, ready for the MP questions.
I don't get the reference?  I was referring to that scene where Saitama was shown with his hair and tanned like Suiryu, with blood running down his face...then the next panel he's in his current form.


EDIT:  I get it now.
Funny thing is... I know exactly what you're talking about.  However, I don't expect ONE or Murata to know what a proper push-up looks like.  They probably did those push-ups themselves and just drew it that way.
ok
Saitama was told to git gud... and he did.
Imagine you've just gotten back from your day job as a construction worker / grocery store clerk.  You killed a mysterious being on the way home and it broke one of your ribs before it died.

You're beat to hell over the training you did earlier in the morning, you hurt all over from your job and from your injuries, you're hungry because you can't afford better food.  Your apartment is hot af, you're sweating from your fever as a result of your injuries, and you don't go to sleep until like 2 or 3 in the morning.

Bam, your alarm clock rings at 8.  Time for your pushups.  Time for your situps - with a broken rib.  Do the squats.  Now go for a 10km run....still with a broken rib, which hurts like all hell because you're breathing so hard.  Now go into work lifting construction crap all day.  Shop for groceries.  Hope you don't run into a monster because you can't fight...shit, is that a monster?  Damn... guess you'll have to suck it up and fight it.

Repeat every day for 547 days.
You try running 10km after 100 pushups, 100 sit-ups and 100 crunches. And do this every day. It is an extremely tough training regimen, it doesn't matter what shape you're in. **AND IT DOESNT END THERE** he still has:

* His day job(s)

* Fighting monsters and getting injured

Your training routine suddenly becomes a lot tougher because of the injury, especially if it's like a broken rib or a sore foot. Try doing sit-ups with a broken rib, or try running with a sore foot. For Saitama, none of these were excuses to slack off or take a rest day - he did it no matter what.

You're right.  The point of him revealing it is not to show that it wasn't hard, it was to show how mundane it is. Genos was expecting something like a super serum, or a blessing from the Gods. For a cyborg like Genos, those exercises are dead easy to do because he's a cyborg. 


EDIT:   I misread your comment... you said basically what I'm saying here.  Sorry.
He told Suiryu himself that he used to have injuries like he did. This was right before or after he killed Gouketsu.
Backflip over all the questions while getting away.
No regrets. As long as iTunes is still there, I'll never go back to Apple. Being able to use your own phone like a real computer and not have your file system walled away behind iTunes and iOS is so nice. There are other benefits as well, but for me that is the strongest feature of Android.
Posts like these are the exact reason why I won't buy anything from BMW, no matter how many people tell me that they're better now. The old formula worked for them so well in the past, no reason to change it...so BMW will continue doing it.

I hope to God that Acura follows suit on the RDX prototype and puts their own 10 speed in everything, while ditching that ZF.
Holy crap, it doesn't feel like it!  I play a lot of Reaper in FFA and he's faster, but not fast enough to prevent people from figuring out where and when you will come out of wraith form.  Moira's shadowstep is far superior because it is not as easy to figure out where she went, it travels much faster, you can use it to jump higher, you get back into the action way quicker, you can still escape graviton surge, avoid a dva bomb... 
**REPOSITIONING DEATH COMES HEY GUYS IM RIGHT HERE BEHIND YOU RIIIIGGGGHHHTTTT HEREE**

I use it only occasionally to get to places before enemies get into position, but it's too damn loud and slow.
I would like to see wraith form move faster, maybe even jump higher.  What would also be nice is being able to cancel wraith form by shooting/meleeing or pressing shift again so you don't have enemies literally camping you to shoot you the moment you come out of wraith form.
When Rob Lucci was fighting against Luffy, he commented on Luffy's body being made entirely out of rubber "right down to the veins and blood vessels", which allowed him to do Gear 2nd by 'doping' his body with increased blood flow.  Similarly, when katakuri is changing shape to avoid being hit, or splitting his arm apart to take out Mole, or using his DonutMan form, you can see bits and pieces of his mochi body being flung out or dripping away.

iTunes is the #1 reason why I switched from Apple to Android.  Why do I have to jump through all these hoops just to add 1 song to my library, or one video to the playlist?  Why is it telling me that it's going to wipe my iPhone because it can't find a matching iTunes library on my new hard drive?  Why does it have to resync ALL my videos because I manually deleted one video off my phone?

Is the windows explorer drag/drop interface THAT hard to use?

I see this all the time, and I've just come to expect that any BMW will be "just fine.....except for that issue where the engine starts puking rods, just drop another $10k in and you're good!"

BMW pursues performance to the exclusion of things like reliability and ease of maintenance. That's fine for what it is and for BMW's goals. It's just not something that appeals to me and I'm willing to give up some performance for reliability.

One of the engineers (interviewed by TFLcar) gave a bullshit reason like the power delivery characteristics of the 2.5T were better suited to an auto because of the way it quickly plateaus off before the higher rpm range. Like...that's not the **only** point of a manual, Mazda.
This is why you have to applaud Toyota's engineering for being able to make a V6 that still speaks for itself and doesn't give up very much vs the turbo I4s in the class as far as MPGs and emissions are concerned. If I'm not mistaken, the Camry's V6 is the 2GR-FKS with a simulated Atkinson cycle (where the intake valves stay open for a short period during the compression stroke) which would help explain the better highway fuel economy.
I wonder if we're seeing these ST variants of CUV/SUV as a result of Jim Hackett (Ford CEO) asking Ford Performance to justify its existence.
The Camry is 75% US components, 100% US made in Kentucky.

Doesn't matter, they are still siblings, their names still represent an order.  This is a recurring theme in all Japanese anime and manga, that the older brothers/sisters/classmates are higher in the pecking order and have more authority.  

Whether Sanji is Germa or not, that is not the point here.  I'm not talking about their power levels, or which ones have raid suits, or their training, motivation.  I'm simply referring to that trope of the elder siblings/classmates/co-workers having more seniority.
It's great to see the different personalities of Ichiji, Niji and Yonji in action here especially when they're helping Sanji to escape.  Ichiji looks tremendously badass when he's telling Sanji to fly.
> but having their physicality (specifically Niji and Ichiji) above Sanji's shows Oda's expert handling of continuity.

And especially Niji and Ichiji, since they're his older brothers.  
He won't fight Reiju, so count her out.  He can defeat Yonji and maybe hold his own against Niji, but Ichiji would win.  For now at least.  

It's all in the hierarchy of their names

I literally just finished watching Kimi no Na Wa (Your Name).  Words cannot describe how stunned I am to have missed this movie when it came out.  I tend to stick with sci-fi and action anime, but this one transcends my usual likes and dislikes.  My favorite parts are all of the subtle (and non subtle) hints that are given to you all throughout the movie, but the most powerful for me was the festival scene, and the events leading up to and after.  Simply spectacular.
I just watched Your Name... what an incredible movie.  I especially liked the timing of events...it really made me go back and rewatch segments just to see those parts again and feel the emotion and the power behind them.
I would like to know...has this technique been field tested in a safe environment?  Because I'd be pissed if this was the first time they were trying this out, and were testing it at the time of the accident (as reports suggested).
You've described a Honda 330i - 2.0T, RWD / RWD-biased AWD.  

I'm personally looking at the next gen Lexus IS350 AWD as a possible upgrade because it is likely to remain a RWD/RWD-biased AWD with a longitudinal V6 engine.  I'm willing to keep waiting to see if Acura delivers on their Type-S promise and turbo V6 engine, but we'll see.
I'm not familiar with US car prices, but I wouldn't pay more than $5k - $6k CAD for a 2010 Mazda 3 with that mileage (66k miles = 105k km).  Just look on Autotrader, plug in the numbers.  

You're getting completely screwed on that price.

Edit:  I drive a 2010 Mazdaspeed 3.  It's been really good so far even in 2018.  It has no rust issues, still drives great,  and has only one tiny rattle coming from the glove box sometimes.  The Mazda 3 was made in Japan from 2010 - 2013, and I'd like to think that is one of the reasons why mine has held up so well.

> RWD, V8, 6spd manual sedan

I know it's dead...but wasn't there a Chevy SS?  It was at least RWD, V8 and had a 6 speed.
It does, just look under the hood of any Nissan or Infiniti.


^^^/s?
I'll get some shit for this, but I would rather pick the dual injection Coyote V8 over that Hyundai/Kia twin turbo V6.  The latter has a shit ton of torque down low and makes good power, but those turbos are really tiny (I saw them up close at an autoshow) and makes me wonder how long they would last.  It's also a newer design and I'm sure it'll run into some teething problems, while the Coyote is practically bulletproof.  Plus, a naturally aspirated V8 has that instant, no-spool throttle response and that sound.
I'm also on board with a sedan 2018 Mustang GT, basically the Ford SS.  I literally cannot live with a coupe anymore, I need that rear passenger door access and rear space.  I don't always have people (or my dog) sitting in the back, but I *need* it for the times when I do.

They need to do it because you absolutely can't get those younger people to lease a new Lexus that has boring looks and so-so performance when they could be driving a BMW or Audi instead.

However, you can definitely convince at least some older people to stick with Lexus despite these changes because of the outstanding reliability and the customer experience.  The grille will be a turn off, but they'll remember the reasons why they went with Lexus in the first place and they may overlook the styling change.  Some of them may even embrace it.
That air vent looks like it wants nothing to do with the interior.
Ah.. so basically we want to see a short nose (bumper to front wheels) and a long hood (front wheels to around the dash/side mirrors).
So something like an IS350 would have the proportions required to satisfy this (since the engine is longitudinally mounted), but an Acura TLX does not?

Oh I'm sure it'll have just enough quality to last the 3 year lease. The trick is to get the BMW that doesn't fuck you over after the warranty is done.
Ok that's what I thought, the AWD versions have the 6 speed. I'm hoping the 4th gen uses the Direct Shift 10 speed across the board.
Did you think the IS350 was quick enough? Was it the RWD version? I'm looking forward to the 4th gen IS, depending on whether it gets some needed upgrades for the chassis, transmission and maybe engine.
Was it at least a 340i?
It was literally a blacked out Altima with no power upgrades and he was suckered into it because it looked fast, and he trusted that recommendation. I'm sure the Nissan dealership was all too happy to show him the nice 4 square paper, and got him hooked probably within a couple of hours. Nissan just sells Renault trash nowadays.
Sorry
The price of the Focus RS in Canada made me think twice about getting one.  In retrospect I'm glad I stayed away because I don't think I could have lived with some of the compromises.
Not too long ago, someone here bought an Altima Midnight edition based on a recommendation from a family member and was looking for ways to offload it.  It was painfully obvious he didn't do any research beforehand.
So? Did you think I was not aware of what car I drive?
Have you guys ever done a Mustang GT review, for the 2015+ models?  I keep toying with the idea of getting a Mustang GT during Ford Employee Pricing, and you can seriously get one for $40k all in without any haggling ($43k ~ $44k with performance package).

> Subaru doesn't have the engineering expertise to have solved all of the issues with the boxer.

I'm actually sure that they could solve those issues, but it might result in making the engine larger, heavier, more expensive.  These are not things that Subaru wants to deal with in their mass market vehicles, so they try their best to work around it.  For example, the FA engines have asymmetrical connecting rods to increase the stroke length (I think) without increasing the length of the rod.  The downside, obviously, is that asymmetrical is not an idea design for con rod...
So that's what's bothering people?  Being salaried = implying I'm being an elitist?  The thought honestly never even crossed my mind...jfc.  I only just mentioned it because I tend to type like I'm talking.
>Speed3 owning software engineer here. I've found a mixed ratio of owners ranging from reckless young kids who think it's acceptable to weave through traffic with a 40oz Bud Light between their legs, to home owning fathers who weave around other cars at the track on weekends.

Absolutely true that the speed 3 has its ratio of owners from backwards cap-wearing bros to relatively sedate 50 year old dad-of-three-kids.

People are misunderstanding what I'm saying up there... I'm not saying I'm part of an exclusive, champagne drinking speed 3 owner's club where only the freshest caviar is served.  I was only pointing out that the speed 3 crowd are not all "methed-out kids".  It is asinine to imply that I'm being an elitist for saying that I'm salaried and I own a speed 3 (of all cars to be elitist with), and have met other people who own a speed 3 and are just like me.  It is even more asinine that I have to spell it out.

Probably with VW still reeling from Dieselgate and with Herbert Diess at the helm (he used to be a BMW exec who squeezed suppliers to lower their prices).  I'm hearing of brand new MK7 Golf Rs over on vwvortex with window actuators not working, fogged up headlights, infotainment not working, AWD system not working properly, etc.  Even one which shut itself off on a mountain road and had to be pushed out of the way from around a blind corner.
I'm an elitist for pointing out that I'm part of the group of speed 3 owners working salaried jobs while not being assholes, not on meth, not destroying the car and not making a public nuisance of myself?  The definition of elitist is being a normal person now?  Okay, gotcha.

Well, you *owned* one ...but not anymore.  Also, it attracts that crowd but it doesn't necessarily mean that everyone who owns one is a douche nugget.  
*pops head in*

Is this the shit on Subaru-aholics Anonymous meeting?  It is?  

I look at it from an outsider's view, having never owned a Subaru before.  Subaru is only 15 years younger than Toyota, but the latter far outstrips the former in size, profitability, technology, production output, build quality, and so on.  I think a lot of it has to do with the niche that Subaru has carved out for itself as this quirky Japanese manufacturer making vehicles with standard AWD across most of the lineup, utilizing the boxer engine as the powerplant of choice.  

I like the AWD portion, and I like what the WRX STI represents, but the boxer engine is just so limited unless you are Porsche and can throw tons of money at it.  Without typing out a ton of details, I have to wonder why only Subaru/Porsche (to my knowledge) use this engine configuration while all other manufacturers stick to inline and V.  It's not JUST about packaging it into a FWD platform...
Spot on accurate...
That's unfortunate, the speed 3 owners that I have met are not anywhere close to that stereotype.  One's an engineer, another is a consultant, another is a financial advisor, a couple are software devs.  Most of us were working salaried jobs at various companies and have families.  These methed out kids you see might be the 3rd or 4th owners of those speed 3s.

Sadly, my speed 3 will be moving on to a methed-out kid in 3 years as the next gen IS350 is out, or possibly an Acura TLX Type-S.  Maybe a MK8 Golf R might tickle my fancy due to its discreet looks, but I worry about German reliability.

Edit: I see the downvotes and I'm being called an elitist for pointing out that I'm not a methed-out kid making a nuisance of himself, and that I've met other speed 3 owners who are like me - salaried people, not assholes, not dude bros.  This states that the speed3 crowd is NOT all methed out kids that blew up SRT4s and moved on, there are some normal people in there - salaried or not, that was not the point.  

Nowhere did I state that I look down on anyone else who don't work salaried jobs.  Is the standard of normal behaviour set so low that I'm now an elitist for not doing drugs, not being an asshole, and having a career?

He still screwed himself. The Tacoma could be worth exactly the same after 5 years.  It doesn't matter, he still spent 35k or more on a car when he could have invested in a career that would pay several times more than construction work and requires less effort.

And so what if the truck is still worth 35k? Is he going to sell it? He still needs a truck.
Yesterday, I proposed to my xQc with a custom made Mercy-themed Engagement Ring!

Two grooves cut into the solid rock on either side of her, literally inches away, with a 3rd beam aimed high?  Pretty sure he spared her.

I really don't think Baam is the type to annihilate an opponent that he feels like he has no personal reason to fight - especially if it's a female and a sibling of Aguero.
... he didn't miss.  Baam has a history of sparing opponents that are not at his level, especially female ones.
Maschenny has served her purpose - SIU has shown us how powerful Jahad is by having her beat on him with no effect other than to break a part of his mask.  The hype is on for that fight between him and Baam.

Notice too that SIU is drawing a similarity here - Maschenny is a Khun and is fighting Jahad, and gets 1 shotted.  The other Khun girl (forgot her name already) is fighting Baam and could have been 1 shotted, but was spared instead.  Baam shot 3 beams and only allowed 2 to connect on either side of her, with the 3rd middle beam shot high...
Also notice that Maschenny destroyed an eye off Jahad's mask...maybe exposing the false King underneath?  Recall too that we first saw Baam wayyy back in the cavern with the same red symbol on the rock.  Also, didn't Enryu's use of shinsu turn it red in his presence?  Might this be a link to Baam?

Yup, and that's how car dealers keep making record profits - there is an abundance of 20-somethings making jack for income, getting approved for vehicles they can't afford.  Some of them even buy new cars and stay at home with parents, not paying rent or food, which I find even more distasteful than what OP's brother is planning to do.
Has it been 12 fucking years?!  Damn.
The problem is that he's screwing himself at this young age (I'm guessing 20 ~ 21) by spending everything he has on breaking even.  There is no money going into investments - whether it's an investment into the stock market, or an investment in higher education.  At the end of his load, he will have literally nothing of value except for his (now depreciated) 2018 Tacoma.

By the time he realizes that, his best days are already behind him and he's starting off 3 or 4 rungs down the ladder compared to the people who exercised self restraint and looked towards the future, and not the present.  
The platform (Nissan FM) is also 17 years old and counting.  If so equipped, the Direct Adaptive Steering is also something I would want to stay far, far away from.  
Not surprised.  The Cult of Elon demands fanatical worshippers after all.
Does he think he'll be able to work at a construction company for his whole life?  Is this job even stable enough, or will he get fucked as soon as the contracts dry up?  How does he expect to go to school (what will he major in??) and how will he pay for it with a loan of $35k (or more) hanging over his head?  So many questions, so little answers.

He needs to learn that this is the best time to be investing in himself.  That means investing in skills that will pay off big time later down the road, and he's not going to be doing that as a grunt in a construction company for his whole life *while* paying off a car loan.  If he is unable to break out of this vicious cycle and keeps living in his fantasy land, he'll wake up one day and find himself older, none the wiser, living paycheck to paycheck and possessing zero marketable skills outside of construction work.  

But at least he got his 2018 Tacoma.

I like the [V35A-FTS](https://lexusenthusiast.com/2017/09/26/the-2018-lexus-ls-500-ls-500h-a-technical-review/), but I love the sound of the V8 too.  I think the V8's days are numbered in the Lexus lineup, and the TT V6 will make its way across the lineup of the LC down to the F models.  It's interesting that Lexus put it into the LS500, but the LC500 retains that V8 for now.  Typical Lexus...they're slowly introducing it across the lineup after it has proven itself.  They even make the turbos in-house to ensure consistent quality and performance.  That's why I like Lexus, they will rarely compromise when it comes to doing it right the first time.
>  I've been convinced to get a v8 so I'm saving up more to splurge

You're absolutely correct in saving to get the V8 (the V6 is no longer being offered btw), especially now that the 2018+ models have a V8 with port and direct injection so you don't have to worry about carbon buildup.  The 460hp far outstrips the EcoBoost engine by a mile, and it will make instant, effortless power in just about any gear.  The throttle response is immediate, the sound of that Coyote revving up into an aggressive snarl is intoxicating, and the experience is just so much different.

Even the extra cost of a GT is not an obstacle if you have patience, and your income is steady.  If you look at the numbers, an EcoBoost is almost exactly 73% of the cost of a GT, or $9510 less expensive.  If you can exercise some discipline and wait an extra year or two while putting money aside each month, you'll have that 9.5k - probably sooner, if you invest the money in some kind of tax free savings account or the equivalent.

Keep in mind that you're still splurging nearly $10k extra.  You're also paying higher gas costs, being charged higher insurance rates, and have to deal with higher maintenance costs (oil changes, tires, brakes + rotors, etc).  The higher costs of a GT do not just stop at the dealership after you drive away.  But you're buying the Mustang for an experience, and the Coyote V8 is a huge part of that and you might as well step up to it as long as you can afford it and not have to eat ramen for the next 5 years.
I would go for an RC-F. If you can force yourself to wait, 2021 is probably when it gets the new TNGA-L platform.
>It's like there is almost no overlap between performance and reliability, even if it comes at a high initial cost.

One thing I've noticed consistently from all the Germans, but especially BMW, is that they don't seem to care very much about reliability. Their ultimate goals are power and luxury, and nothing else really matters because their German competition is doing the same and they can't fall behind in the metrics which can be **immediately** felt and appreciated. In other words, the customer cannot feel the built-in reliability right away, and the Germans know this. Lexus knows this, but refuses to give up on their core tenets because their selling point is reliability, and it'll also impact the main brand (Toyota).
I think that this link should be enough to convince the casual enthusiast to leave that particular model of BMW alone. I mean...

You can look at it as Sanji not being limited by the hard exoskeletons that the modified Germa children have.

Sanji is free.  He doesn't have a hard exoskeleton or the predetermined superhuman attributes of his siblings.  Aside from the metaphor of him being free to grow as much as he wants to, we also know that haki draws strength from willpower.  We have also seen, from Luffy's fight with Katakuri, that haki is greatly enhanced by emotion and empathy...things that Sanji has in great abundance.

All of them appear to be made in [Aichi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_4Runner#Fifth_generation_(N280;_2009%E2%80%93present).  In general, I'd like imports to be made in the country where the parent company originates from (VW - Germany, Toyota/Mazda/Honda - Japan) but this is getting increasingly rare now and is probably a non-issue nowadays with all the automation that exist in the factories.
http://www.subaruforester.org/vbulletin/3518521-post3.html

I believe that only Subaru and Porsche use boxer engines (The Toyota 86 has a boxer engine, but it's actually a Subaru). The overwhelming majority of car manufacturers use inline or V configurations. I feel like that is enough proof that the boxer has fallen out of favor for the reasons listed above.  It costs more to produce, it doesn't package well for FF platforms, and isn't mainstream so it loses out on worldwide ongoing development (ie. development of the engine design in general, because it is so popularly used by most other manufacturers).

The boxer has advantages like lower center of gravity, it packages well for the AWD layout, and it is smoother in operation.  It's perfectly fine for non turbo engines (like your '18 Impreza) because you don't have the added stress of the turbo forcing extra air into the cylinders to create bigger explosions and higher temperatures.
Takeshi Uchiyamada, Toyota's Chairman, said [this](https://insideevs.com/toyota-chairman-tesla-enemy-role-model/):

"Tesla is not our enemy and not our role model. I think it’s the German manufacturers that rather see Tesla as a competitor."

So... Tesla, a car manufacturer, is not even acknowledged as a competitor by Toyota, arguably the largest and most successful car manufacturer in the world.

Yeah, I can't defend that.
They didn't say that outright.  They said something about hybrid tech with electric power assist, and that the 2.5L in the current STI cannot exist in its current form going forward.
Exactly, boxer engines have massive drawbacks that stem from the engine layout.  As I understand it, there is no way to 'fix' these drawbacks without spending much, much more on engine development, production and cost-per-unit.  This is a big part of the reason why I'm not entirely on board with getting a next generation STI as my upgrade.

This car, strangely enough, reminds me of my friend's old '90s Nissan Pathfinder that he had bought used, and sold 10 years ago.  They're not the same type of vehicle, of course, but they give off the same overall *feel*.  

It's that feeling of something old and familiar, squared off at the edges with unabashed pride.  A vehicle you could just get in on a hot summer's day, roll the windows down because the AC sucks, and drive 20km across the city to a mall where DVDs of questionable origin are peddled in a dingy little shop that is raided once a month by the cops.  It didn't coddle you with welcome chimes, a slick infotainment display and heated and cooled seats with Kungfu Grip™ action.  You got in the car, turned the key, hit the gas and bottomed out over speed bumps with resounding crashes and sparks sent flying from the frame contacting the asphalt.

Lexus used softer bushings just for comfort, right?  I'm wondering if this excessive tire wear is intentional (because Lexus prioritized comfort with the softer bushings, and sportier handling with the negative camber).

I too was a sweet summer child like you.  Then I did a short stint in sales (non car related) back when I was a poor student looking for spare cash in the summer.

Holy shit, the things they teach you and the brazen way that they pull it off... I must have gotten the dark end of the spectrum that verdegrrl was talking about up there.  I lasted 2 weeks and just never came back.  I went for another summer job not long after that that advertising a "warehouse" type job for students like myself.  I got all the way to the interview portion and got some weird vibes.  I asked a direct question like "is this a sales job?" got a confirmation and thanked the guy for his time before cutting the interview short and leaving.  I felt, at that time, literally anything else was better than being in sales.

Ah I remember your post when I searched this subreddit, you had a 2015 IS350 and you asked whether excessive tire wear was normal.  Any issues so far with the new 2017 IS350 as far as tire wear goes, or is it still too new to see?  I can't imagine they would have changed the camber within the same generation.
You're going to have a really bad time.
Thanks for the confirmation...did you have inner tire wear on your front tires as well?
Thanks for the info, would you need control arms for the front too?
That customer is one of the best kinds of advertising that the dealership could have.  He or she is a dedicated fan *and* has the income to be a repeat customer of new vehicles purchased outright.  More importantly, this customer is likely to be influential with other people, which in turn may generate even more profit because those people will have influence within their circle of friends and family.

It is indeed incredibly hard to imagine how this dealer could have decided to butcher this golden goose just for its feathers.
I wonder if it has the 2.5L turbo as well.  Is AWD too much to hope for too?

Will changing the camber fix these issues, or is this not recommended? Changing out all 4 tires every year (20k km driving) is insane. I'm assuming yours is AWD too.

Edit:  I guess you can't adjust the camber and you have to buy a camber kit.  [SavageGeese's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PuC64BDdQUE&t=5m26s) is starting to make sense now, I don't know how I missed this.  Thanks for bringing this issue up to me.

I'm looking forward to getting a 4th gen IS350, which is due in 2 - 3 years.
Don't focus on the gains.  My point is that the aftermarket promises you extra power and performance, with no drawbacks.  This is absolutely untrue.

You're putting more stress on the engine, the oil, the turbo, and on the drivetrain.  You're modifying the car to get closer to the safe limit that was engineered in for reliability.  Depending on the car, and the tune, and the gas you use and who knows how many other variables...you could get too close to that limit and experience engine and/or turbo failure.  The tunes also give you peak power and torque for only a very short period of time, and will make your car feel very quick when pushed, but it will run out of breath just as quickly.

I was in the same situation as you back in 2010.  I modded my speed 3.  Since then, I've undone most of my mods and couldn't be happier.  If I had to do it again, I'd do rear motor mount, short shift plate, get better tires and practice my driving.  Everything else was a waste of my time and money.
Even though I'm not in the market for a large SUV (waiting for the 4th gen Lexus IS350... /sigh), I'm still watching 4Runner review videos and configuring them on the Toyota site.  I just have a thing for well-made, super reliable vehicles that make you feel invincible no matter where you go or what the weather is like.
It really won't matter what you do to protect black paint, short of wrapping the whole car in 3M.  Just drive and enjoy it, use the car wash bay + 2 bucket method and Optimum No Rinse, wax it every now and then.  Scratches and swirls will happen, just ignore it.  Driving and enjoying the car is more important than fussing over every little imperfection... it's a car, it's meant to be driven.

As for mods - you really, REALLY want to keep in mind that the aftermarket preys upon people like us.  They promise all sorts of gains with no drawbacks, and 95% of it is horseshit.
Well, maybe because they sell 120k of them a year they become ubiquitous enough that they're super secret stealth wealth?  Based on the last review by Straightpipes, it looks like a very comfortable SUV that is very capable in any weather condition, rides high, has a no-nonsense look (for the most part), will be super reliable, **and** it can legitimately off road in case you need to go to your hillside chalet.  

I get the feeling that it's like a mini Landcruiser.
Congrats on the purchase of your first car, and a Focus ST to boot.  Personally speaking, I would leave the Focus badge alone...but I think that the Euro models don't have that badge.  Also, get ready for never being able to keep the car looking clean longer than a few hours ~ 1 day.

You'll likely be tempted to do some mods to it.  You'd benefit the most from an upgraded rear motor mount and new summer tires (when the stock ones wear out).  Don't put mudflaps on it... just... don't.  I'd highly recommend you stay **away** from all other mods, especially engine / power, if you don't fully understand their disadvantages.

Other than that, it sounds like an awesome first car and super practical to boot.
Civic Si is really good right now with the new design.

> If in Japan this was never an issue then Toyota may not have thought to check this kind of thing.

This might be it right here.  Toyota might have conducted quality checks in the past, and Kobe Steel always came through, so the two companies eventually settled down into a mutual trust relationship to save time and effort.  I'm guessing that the Japanese companies don't expect this sort of behavior between Japanese partners.  

Overall this is probably a good thing now that Kobe is becoming more transparent in structure (so that cheats and liars can't hide as effectively), and you can bet that Toyota is going to start checking the shit out of all their parts from all suppliers.

Toyota says it looks at TNGA as a complete rethinking of its manufacturing processes.  TNGA shares components where it makes sense to share them (steering wheels, buttons, switches, etc), it has the modular platforms, it also defines a new class of powertrain tech (engines, awd systems, etc) that will fit into the modular platform, and it is also a change to the way cars are designed and built by the designers, engineers and the chief engineer.  It's not just a set of components that they put together like a model kit, it really is all about efficiency and parts sharing.
TNGA can accommodate FWD, RWD and AWD. TNGA-L is the variation of the modular kit which allows for this. I read somewhere that TNGA is like a flowchart which changes based on the decisions you make at each point.  You choose a basic skeleton, then add in the parts which allows for FR, which then determines engine bay length, then you choose a seat height, etc. 

Edit: the LS500 and LC500 are on the TNGA-L platform.

Yeah...don't watch World War Z. You can erase that movie from your memory now. But **do** read the book, I found it to be a very entertaining read with the way it's set up being told through the narratives of the survivors. They could have made it into some kind of TV series, with each episode being a narrative in chronological order. Instead, they got Brad Pitt and made him basically into the harbinger of doom wherever he went.

"*but but but... it's a commercial van!*"  is literally the response of everybody in here who is defending the Metris.

The Metris and Sienna have

* more or less the same size

* sliding doors

* 7 ~ 8 passenger seating

* rear liftgate

Neither of them are equipped with anything special that set them apart from regular vans.  They look, feel and work like minivans.  People can call the Metris a commercial dump truck or a jetplane for all I care, it's still a minivan...but it gets a free pass because it's labelled as a commercial van.
Did she scream so loud and wake you up?
> If it lacks all the creature comforts of a modern minivan but can do 1 000 000 miles, then doesn't that fit a niche?

Yes, if it can do that, then that is definitely a reason to pick one (assuming a Sienna can't also do the same).  I don't think so though, thanks to its 4 cylinder turbo engine and all that weight it'll have to haul around every day.  That's just my opinion.

Funny you mentioned that it's an inbetween of a minivan and commercial van... it feels like a commercial van was gutted and had those seats / rails installed into it.
Which makes it remarkable that Arie (and his family) can use swords so effectively.  Probably because of the hints we get about their swords being made from shinsu.
It's a turbo 4 banger making 208hp, hauling a minivan's weight and up to like 7 passengers around.  This thing will be lucky to make it to 60k miles.  

The Sienna that Doug talks about has a 3.5L V6 (2GR-FKS).  It has port/direct injection, dual vvt on intake and exhaust valves, Otto and a simulated Atkinson cycle, and it has 296hp on top of all that along with the same combined MPG (22) as the engine on the Metris. 
I wrote a long thing somewhere in this thread, but basically I think Doug is right - it doesn't matter if you label this thing as a commercial vehicle, or if it's aimed at the airport shuttle market, or something similar where cheap, cheerless transportation is the name of the game.

It has all of the same basic features as a minivan.  It has 7 ~ 8 passenger seating, sliding doors, a rear liftgate, and it's the same size and shape as a minivan.  There is nothing special about it...no bulletproof glass, no armored doors, hidden .50cal turrets...nothing.  You can designate it anything you want, give it any number of labels...it's still a minivan that is horrendously outclassed by a base Sienna LE and costs $43k.

So what if it was designed NOT to have those creature comforts and features?  Just buy a Sienna for $10k less, then take a screwdriver or hammer and have a go at disabling or smashing every useless gadget for that Metris feel.
@ u/Doug-Demuro

So I've watched the video... and unfortunately read some of the comments in this thread.  Honestly, some of those comments have me wondering whether logic is a thing on reddit.  There is simply no logic to giving the Metris a free pass just because it may be designated as a commercial people mover.

If we look at the Metris vs the Sienna LE objectively as vehicles, we have very similar features that lead me to conclude that both of them are in the same class.  I don't see ANYTHING that makes the Metris special enough to be classed differently than a base Sienna.  In fact, it almost looks like the Metris started off life as a cheap commercial van meant for carrying tools or cargo or whatever, then some marketing genius at MB decided to convert one into a minivan.

So, going on the premise that both compete in the same class of vehicle there is a $10k price gap between the Metris and the Sienna LE, yet the Sienna has a 296hp 3.5L V6 (2GR-FKS) with port/direct injection and otto/atkinson cycle while the Metris has a shitty turbo 4 banger making 88 less hp with no gain in fuel economy.  It probably even requires premium fuel too, while I'm sure the Sienna will run just fine on 87.  

The Sienna has better folding seats - those 'seats' in the Metris are atrocious.  It was especially funny watching the rear seats being folded forward as one unit, but not even locking into place...like what even is the point of that?  The Sienna also has...better visibility, better interior, better gas cap location, better acceleration, better...shit...it has better *everything*.  Everything is literally better on a base Sienna than on that Metris.

This is why the comments in this thread are mind boggling to me.  If it looks like a minivan, works like a minivan, has all of the same basic features of a minivan and has NOTHING whatsoever to put it into a different class of vehicle, then by golly it's a goddamned minivan to me no matter how many people tell me it's a commercial vehicle.  

Objectively speaking, it has less features, less power, less practicality, less technology, and less attention to detail than a base Sienna.  Even the excuse that it's a commercial vehicle and it doesn't need fancy Sienna features doesn't pan out to me because, well, breaking these features in a Sienna will just put you in the same situation as if you had bought a Metris - except with $10k more in your pocket.
Does it really matter if they break all that tech?  The $13k you saved by buying a Sienna or whatever over this thing should be enough consolation.
/uj  I agree, it was a legit clutch play with that last moment ult from landing near an enemy.  Had that enemy not been there at the end of the jetpack jump, he would never have been able to make it in time.  Had his Mercy not come with him, he might have died even in rage mode.

It's certainly a lot better than the usual highlights where Reaper presses Q and gets a 5k - team kill ... unless it's one where an enemy Zarya's ult pulls him OUT of the Ilios pit.
Their cash flow suddenly became unreliable 5 years since the split, and they're taking on ever increasing loans just to keep running.

That's why I said electric water pump *for the turbo*, I'm just mentioning it because BMW is notorious for electric water pump failures.

Don't get me wrong, I feel that BMW set out to make a purpose-built high output powerplant in the B58 and they have succeeded beyond expectations.  The engine design is all about smooth, effortless power that can be used anytime, anywhere.  That said, I really don't think that BMW gave much consideration about its long term reliability, which doesn't mean that they're stupid or anything...it was just not a priority.
Yo... read the One Piece manga.  Watching it is fine too, but the manga is where it's at - it's the story exactly as Oda intended you to read with no fillers or side plots.  It is also highly detailed, consistent and accurate.  Get past the first few chapters and the art improves tremendously.  We manga readers are on the most fucking lit arc of all, Whole Cake Island, where an especially epic fight has just concluded.

Also, Attack on Titan manga is also very, very good.  If you are starting to get into more manga after this, I highly recommend Nausicaa of the Valley of Wind (manga only, NOT the movie), Full Metal Alchemist.  Oh, and One Punch Man (manga) is similarly superb.

I like how it is going to be branded as a Toyota, not as a Lexus.  I know it is the right thing to do (considering what Lexus is all about, and the number of high powered vehicles in its lineup) but it's still good to see a Toyota halo car bringing prestige to the rest of the brand.
Super Resonance Drive sounds like something out of the Gundam universe, developed by a mad scientist/philanthropist 200 years before the main storyline.
http://youwheel.com/home/2016/03/27/detailed-analysis-the-bmw-b58-inline-6-cylinder-engine/

Take note of the timing chain, wastegate actuator location, and electric water pump for the turbo. Sounds like an extremely powerful engine, but I really don't think you'd want to own one out of warranty unless your wallet is ready.
The 4Runner is made in the Tahara plant in Japan, the same plant that makes a bunch of Lexus models, so you've got that going for you there. Also, the 4Runner is just designed to run forever and not give you any bullshit. Toyota really doesn't screw around with a successful formula.

But who determines the shape?  Is it the tower looking at these adventurers and deciding what position they're in?  I don't think so.  Positions came from the great warriors as a tactic for fighting ever stronger beasts, and I think that these irregulars determined their own path and destiny, and also the shape of their baangs.
Which is why I found it cool that he's still wearing this setup, just as he was recorded in data prior to his physical self leaving the Hell Train's hidden floor.  Jahad on the outside is probably going to look significantly different because he no longer explores or adventures, so maybe he'll be shown as an older-looking Wangnan in a plain red  3 piece suit.
It's ironic that the most logical person on Baam's team is illogical when it comes to himself, and needed to hear logic from YHS, who is ultra deceitful on the outside of the Hell Train.


Thanks for clearing it up.  I thought it was something like that, but the translation made it sound like AA was only good at using shinsu to strengthen his attributes (stronger, faster, etc) and YHS was telling him to give up on what the clicker showed him (ice spear).  It's the whole bit about being born into the Koon family and having his attributes pre-determined, right?

Also, I believe it is true that there is no way he can defeat his father using just spear bearer abilities alone, and it is also true that he should give up on his pride and learn it anyway because it's one of his core (untapped) strengths.  It'll help him climb faster, fight better, and facilitate his goal towards gaining OTHER skills that might one day enable him to challenge for the position of family head.

As a side note, notice how Baam does not have pre-determined attributes like a person from the 10 families has.  He's unlimited in his growth potential, it seems.
There was an idea floating around where Firestrike could be used to instantly recharge the shield based on damage dealt.  If you strike 1 enemy, you get like 200 shield hp, 2 enemies 400hp.  All 6 = 1200hp.

Probably this one, along with more money I guess.  I think Biermann was approaching some sort of BMW mandatory retirement age (BMW supposedly forces their managers or whatever to retire at a certain age).  I don't know much about this policy though.
>The Camry is the class-leader in fuel economy, without having to resort to gimmicks like DCTs or CVTs.

Or turbo engines, for that matter.  What's amazing is that the V6 Camry gets 1 less combined MPG (22/32/26 combined) vs the new Accord 2.0T 10 speed's MPG (23/34/27 combined) while weighing more. 
 I'm willing to bet that the Camry's numbers are more accurate than the Accord's based on knowing that the 2.0T will have to work harder to make more power (and dumping fuel to cool the cylinders via direct injection), while the V6 doesn't have to work as hard when acceleration is required.

>Because they want to do it correctly; not be first.

This, exactly.  I look at their huge budget as a buffer which allows them to take their time in order to get it right.  This whole comment chain has been one circle jerk hating on Toyota for being so conservative.  I agree to an extent with respect to stuff like Android Auto / Apple Carplay, but Toyota isn't about to change a winning formula just because a competitor like Honda or Hyundai are making big changes.

Honda themselves has said that they tried to out-Toyota Toyota and ended up with less than stellar results, and this recent trend of big changes within Honda is the result of a decision to "do their own thing" and not try to copy Toyota.  Hyundai has the same idea.  They know that Toyota has a death grip on reliability and the whole tried-and-true thing, to the point where the average consumer already associates Toyota with reliability.  It's one of those qualities that you only get after decades of proven track records across numerous models.  Hyundai is not going to try and play second fiddle to Toyota, so they're choosing to move faster, implement changes quicker, at the risk of running into issues later.
I think it's more complicated than that.  The 370z needs a platform update, the interior is atrocious, it's heavy as fuck for a small 2 seater, and of course it lacks rear seats and the rear trunk capacity is a joke.  Even the tiny seats on the Mustang and Camaro, which are the 370z's competitors, are still usable in a pinch and their trunks are still significantly larger than that of the 370z.  But who cares that much about practicalit anyway... the fact is, the Mustang and Camaro will continue to outsell the 370z regardless of anything else because they have naturally aspirated V8s (sound, throttle response, aftermarket, etc) and a much, MUCH larger following in North America.
Someone else pointed this out, but Katakuri's eyes were cloudy and hazed over while Luffy's eyes were focused with his pupils sharply defined on the white of his eyes.

Also something I pointed out - Luffy's punch hit Katakuri's torso, not necessarily right on his spear wound, but with enough force to cause his body to bend in half which would tear his wound open.
But did she scream loud enough to wake her girlfriend?
Wait, so his pride is holding him back from learning this new shinsu method?  Is that what Yu Hansung is telling him?
So... the basic idea of this orb is to compress shinsu inside of it, make it way stronger than usual, then blast it out?  Similar to the idea of a compressor which pressurizes air / liquid?
Yeah, what I also find cool (strangely enough) is the gear he's wearing.  Someone like this has so much power that he can tear a huge gash through solid rock with one swing of his hand...yet he still has a red cloak to protect him from the wind and rain, that headgear of his with those ear flaps to protect his ears from getting cold (or whatever).  And of course, he still has a sword, as if he even needs one at all.  

It's like seeing a 1000lb grizzly bear wearing shin guards, a helmet and has lead knuckles strapped to its paws.  Scary, but totally unnecessary gear.  Of the family heads we've seen so far, none of them are wearing any gear or armor and only Arie has a sword because he's from a family that uses swords.  
Nice subtle detail - he's fighting all of them without even moving a finger, which further highlights just how freaking powerful he is.  He was only forced to move his hand when going 1 on 1 with Edahn earlier, but for these guys?  He's not even going to bother.

Also, is this the first time we get the 'KRRRRRRR' sound effect for one of Baam's moves?
There are a bunch of cars I'm looking at - STI, Golf R, IS350, Acura TLX.  The things they all have in common are that they're AWD, and they're all due for a redesign and/or a global platform and/or a new engine *soon*...as in 2 to 3 years 'soon'.

I could get any one of them now, but I really hate buying something and finding out that the next generation was literally just around the corner.

Did everyone forget?  Katakuri allowed Luffy to go into G4.  He intentionally allowed his opponent to power up, something that he could have prevented using future sight.  If Katakuri were 100% focused on winning at all costs, he would have stopped G4, summoned his spear and finished off Luffy there and then.
The force of Luffy's punch will cause Katakuri's torso on his uninjured side to move backwards, which will also cause his injured side to twist from the motion.  So you're right, even if the punch didn't strike Katakuri's injury, the force of impact will still affect it because it is on the torso.
When you move your torso from left to right in a twisting motion, your left side is moving as well as your right side.  Try it right now, put your hands on your sides and twist, you'll see that the torso moves on both sides.  If it didn't, then you'd never be able to move your torso at all.  When Luffy's punch hits Katakuri's torso on the right side, it will ALSO force his left side (the injured side) to twist as well, possibly tearing the wound open further.
Great observation... I didn't even see that!  

Edit:  Also, look at the panel where Katakuri is struck by Luffy's punch.  Where is his self-inflicted injury?  It's on his left side (the tattooed portion).  What is he doing right now?  His torso has just been bent almost in half by the force of Luffy's attack, which forces his injured side wide open, tearing his wound further.  The pain from that alone must be mind bending.
Luffy also landed his most powerful Snake Man punch on Katakuri's torso, where he has a spear wound.  Meanwhile, Katakuri's attack struck Luffy on his hard head, and some of that force transferred through Luffy and into the ground itself.  I'd say that Luffy had the upper hand in terms of who did the most damage with that final attack of theirs.


Edit: Some people are saying that it doesn't matter if it landed on the side where he didn't stab himself.  When you move your torso from left to right in a twisting motion, your left side is moving as well as your right side.  If it didn't, then you'd never be able to move your torso at all.  Think about when Luffy's punch hits the right side of his torso, the force of the attack will move BOTH sides of the torso, further exacerbating Katakuri's wound.
The whole point of the Civic Type-R is to showcase Honda out on the street.  There is literally no reason for the low volume Civic Type-R to exist other than as a halo car, and as something to shock people into the realization that the thing they're looking at is basically a Civic turned all the way up to 11.

Honda's #1 mission statement to the Civic Type-R's designers were to make it stand out, then add more stuff on top to make it stand out even more.  Don't get me wrong, I think it is a bit overdone.  I'm not a big fan of the fake vents front and rear, or the diffuser things on the roof near the back, or the black plastic on the fender vents but everything else is on point.  
What the fuck.
Your best bet is to wait a few months for the next gen RDX. It'll have the Honda 10 speed, a Honda 2.0T engine, etc. I wouldn't touch the TLX right now as it's old and tired. The CX-5 is a good CUV but I would really wait to see the new RDX.
Yeah you won't have a problem with the V8, but sudden turbo boost at low rpms in high gears can be a shock on the con rods or bearings. I would advise your friend to downshift if he finds himself in that situation.
>You're in 6th at 70 mph with three people in the car? Just roll on the throttle and it will pass with ease.

What RPMs were you at in 6th gear at 70mph?  I'm saying this because if it's low, then it's better to downshift 1 gear before rolling on the throttle.  Chances are that it's already running decently high and downshifting would be too much at 70mph, but just saying.
You didn't get the memo?  Prices have plummeted on the Focus RS hate ETFs thanks to the intent to announce 25% tariffs on Ford hate speech.  We've moved onto a diversified portfolio of Tesla, Mazda (rotary hedged) with 60% FCA for that guaranteed ROH.
Saves money. Why keep 2 body styles in inventory (spare parts), on the assembly line and in the books? They cut out on certifying 2 body styles for crash safety, emissions, fuel economy and who knows what else. That's all it really is - saving on what Honda deems as unnecessary cost.
They just want to...uhh...have a shower slumber party.
I know for a fact that the 2GR-FSE (FKS now?) in the IS350 is overbuilt and understressed.  It's really nice that Lexus tends to move at its own pace when it comes to performance, but also a bit disappointing.  I'm looking at a next gen IS350 whenever it is out on the TNGA platform, and I'm 90% sure they'll just keep using the 2GR-FKS on it and keep that V35A-FTS for any true F versions, and for the LS500.
So why don't the Sith dominate more, I mean, more than the time when Palpatine took over the Republic?  Is it because they tend to kill each other off?  We see how powerful Yoda is, but even he was unable to overcome Palpatine who is just a fraction of his age.  So Sith become more powerful at a faster rate, but burn out quicker?
I just want him to get out of the Hell Train and go back to the normal way of climbing the tower, with each floor having unique scenery, people, wildlife.  One of the major draws (for me) reading ToG is seeing the characters progress through one long roadtrip with a sense of freedom and openness to go places, do things.

But as far as high rankers go... I want to see Grace Luslec, real Koon Edahn, Asensio, and more of the heads of the 10 families.  Also, more on V and Arlene as they were during their climb.
I don't like xQc but I screamed so loud
In my opinion, Lexus may be lacking in performance compared to Audi or BMW, but you can always add in performance by way of higher output engines, suspension tuning, steering, and so on.  You cannot add reliability as an afterthought.
So how come nobody ever falls to the Light side of the Force?  Jedi turn into Sith all the time at the drop of a hat, but Sith never turn into Jedi unless it is through intense self examination and meditation.
It has always felt to me that Jedi should be allowed to experience the dark side of the Force and to find a way to build up a tolerance to it.  You would have way less bipolar swings from Jedi to Sith just because the former got addicted to the endorphin rush of using dark side powers.  Use both light and dark side powers together as one, as tools only.

A hammer is just a hammer until it is used to knock a nail in, or bash someone's skull.

You're all going to get a kick out of this - my head turned for a black 2018 Camry XSE V6.

I was making a left turn at a light last night, and the Camry pulled up and passed me on the right.  The distinctive taillights, reworked exterior and greenhouse, shiny black paint and quad exhaust tips were quite handsome when paired with the stock wheels.
I'm impressed.  I was expecting him to lose to Katakuri, but it seems that the King Cobra punch hit Katakuri at his mid-torso where he has that self-inflicted spear wound, while Katakuri's attack struck Luffy's super hard head.  That would certainly give the win to Luffy by a little bit.
I would actually love to see the real Luffy vs Big Mom fight, and not in a flashback or 'after the end of the story' thing.
I wonder, is it possible that the Conqueror Haki clash that knocked out Flanpe and her men could have also wiped their memories of Katakuri's mouth?  The only remaining evidence would be the pics from the cameras.
Much respect for Sanji.  He appears to have grown tremendously as a person, and as a man.  Oda is a master at telling us that Sanji has matured significantly and stayed true to himself without needing to resort to anything as crass as actually spelling it out for us.  This whole thing has been a bad deal for Sanji from the start, but he somehow managed to get his family to leave him alone and completely reversed Pudding's opinion of him through his confident manner, kind words and strong actions.

Would you say the same thing about the Liberty?

i screamed so loud 
Jeff himself stated that whip shot knocks people back. 
Oh look, Baguette's fap shop can knock people away, gee, nobody has ever thought of using it to knock people into a huge gaping hole in the map.  Nope, never.

Banana main btw.
When fucking **Engadget** is saying this shit is complicated, you know you have problems.
There is a gen 2 speed 3 in my area with widened fenders and all sorts of tacked on shit.  It also had a custom paint job or a wrap in a light baby blue color.  License plate:  REGRETS
I don't even trust the forums anymore, with all the aftermarket sponsorship and echo chamber talk going on there.  
It has been said literally 6 - 8 times already in this thread, so here it is again just in case it hasn't been made abundantly clear that modding is a bad idea if you lack knowledge and only read the aftermarket company's website, or listen to the model-specific forum.

**Do NOT** mod your car until after you've gained a good understanding of the potential drawbacks of the mod!!  Let's talk about one of the simplest of mods - a rear swaybar.  These are usually powdercoated, and come with a set of steel brackets + bushings and a set of steel locating collars.  It is undeniably stiffer than the stock part, and looks way sexier.  It is also easy to install.  What you don't hear:

* the powdercoating will eventually crack and flake off, exposing the bare metal to salt spray

* the steel brackets are often MUCH thinner than stock, and they're given a surface treatment like galvanization or whatever.  These will snap on you every year or so if you get salt on the roads, without fail, and you'll have to keep replacing them

* the steel locating collars will eventually rust and move around or fall off unless you loctite the literal shit out of them

* the bushings will start to squeak as the grease wears off

* the swaybar itself is usually a welded 3-piece thing, which I highly doubt is stronger than the OEM which is usually a solid bar of steel

That's just a RSB, one of the simplest of mods.  Now apply the same logic to major mods like ECU tunes and "stage 1" / "stage 2" mods that change the intake and exhaust parameters of your vehicle.  You're not getting HP and torque "for free".  Manufacturers these days don't really leave any power on the table without a good reason like increased reliability, emissions, noise, etc.  

For example...APR (a VW tuning company) loves to talk up their stage X tunes as unlocking free power out of nowhere, but there is *hardly* a peep about issues that may pop up like clutch slip, stressing the engine internals and the turbo closer to their safe limits (leading to lessened service life), and so on.  The same can be said for general application tuners like Cobb (makers of the Accessport) too.

&nbsp;

No aftermarket company thrives by warning customers away.  **All** of them are cashing in on people with limited knowledge, and relying on peer pressure to drive sales, or the lure of cheap speed / performance to keep the hype going.  Always keep in mind that the aftermarket is ALL about selling you on the effectiveness of their products, and very short on warning you about potential problems you may run into.

Hold on, let me get my expert on cars found in a barn and covered in barn dust.
It was the 2GR-FE for a while, now I believe it's the 2GR-FKS which has direct and port injection (D4S), Otto and Atkinson cycles on demand, VVT on both intake and exhaust, and various other improvements.  Toyota has been extremely disciplined about refining the shit out of their tech until it is bulletproof, something that I totally understand and support.
Nope, Alex on Autos did a video on the 2018 XSE Camry V6 and he says that exhaust does get piped through all 4 tips.  He showed how the exhaust pipes are Y-piped.
What doesn't kill it makes it stronger.
Yes, there are [more differences](http://kaizen-factor.com/from-fse-to-fks-the-evolution-of-toyotas-2gr-3-5-liter-v6/) between the older 2GR-FSE to the 2GR-FKS too.
They chose orange specifically because it's a complementary color to blue.
Thanks! I'm looking forward to the new stuff Toyota and Lexus will be getting, as I'm currently considering a next gen IS350, so any news on the V6 is always good to hear.
What roadmap graphic? 
She's gonna be a LOT of fun in Total Mayhem with that shield bash and whip shot going non-stop.
Likely just the result of a tune, the torque figures in the Tacoma and Camry are quite similar. 
Give them another 10 years, they're only just now getting started on that sweet EJ architecture.
It is very likely the 2GR-FKS, if it's the same engine from the Tacoma.

I saw a 60 year-old dude driving a 2016 WRB STI sedan, along with his wife in the passenger seat.  Seeing this makes me happy because it shows that the STI's appeal can transcend the vaping, backwards cap wearing subabro stereotype.
Those are some tiny turbos though.  I looked under the hood of the Stinger GT at the Canadian Auto show and the center housing is no bigger than a clenched fist.  Obviously they are meant for instantaneous boost (1 per cylinder bank, I guess) but how much can you push them before they go over their threshold?
The fact that the new (and last gen) Accords are perceived as *competing* with Acura should say enough.  Thankfully Acura may be finally waking up with the Acura-only turbo V6 that was announced at Detroit, along with the return of the Type-S badge.
This looks at home cruising the Serengeti while Sir David Attenborough does a voice over.
I screamed so loud into my gril gamer discord server (female only) that I hacked the game and made it play Taco Bell music which woke my boyfriend up, so he redrew all the characters as dogs, and wrote some fanfic of Brigitte actually being jetpack cat hero 27.  Guava mains are so tocksick masculinity and take no skill, support mains (Marzipan main btw) like me carry the weight of the team on our backs.  Thanks for listening, and praise Daddy Jeff (wrestle with death, prepare for Jeph).
I'd love to see an Acura TLX Type-S concept.
I spent about 1 min at the Mitsu display at the Canadian auto show wondering why they even bothered showing up.  To me, Nissan and Mitsubishi are now one and the same in their race to the bottom to compete on who can make the shittiest, most cookie-cutter inspired CUVs with ever worse build quality.
iTunes library
I don't use the file system everyday, but on the odd time I do, I find it indispensable to just copy a video onto internal storage using USB just so I can watch it at the gym (no WiFi) without using data. Plenty of other uses for the file explorer, but I find that I really, really hate not having it when I need it.
Get Solid Explorer on Google Play, and pay for the unlocked version. Best file explorer app for Android.
The same thing happened to me when I had an iPhone 4S. My hard drive died and I was trying to get the music and pics off the iPhone and onto a backup. Nope, sorry, if only someone had invented a phone OS that allows you to copy and paste files directly from the file system.

Oh wait, it's called Android. That was the last straw for me, even more so than the tiny screen compared to the larger Androids at the time. iTunes is the worst experience of iPhone ownership, I hate it so much that I haven't used it to sync anything on my iPad in literally 4 years.
Can you work directly with the file system in iOS like you can in Android? That is my number one issue with iOS.
Why did I get a Mazda 3? 

I got a Mazdaspeed 3 (it counts right?) because it was a fast hatchback and the salesman gave me a nice $5k discount and zero percent financing. Honda salesguys treated the 8th gen Civic Si like it was a Lambo, and I didn't trust the Golf GTI reliability.

In hindsight, it has been the perfect starter performance car for me. It's quick, has a lot of practicality for its size, has been very reliable (except for the turbo), looks good from all angles (except straight ahead) and it is unnaturally well-equipped for an econobox. I mean, the thing has auto headlights wipers, push button start, heated seats and mirrors, adaptive xenon headlights, auto climate control, LED taillights, push button access/lock on the door handles, dual zone HVAC, Bluetooth and even a **6 disc** CD player (which was awesome back then). 

Fast forward to today and there is nothing wrong with it except the driver's seat heater only works on the seat back. Normal maintenance has been cheap, and I have like 1 minor interior rattle. You cannot really tell that the interior of my car is 8 years old except for signs of wear on the steering wheel and driver's seat, and the outdated infotainment. I still love driving it, and feeling the heavy hydraulic steering feedback, the heavy clutch pedal, notchy shifter and the pure joy it gives me when I put the right foot down.

Like another person here, future me is looking forward to a next gen IS350 AWD F-Sport. I have a sizable down payment ready, but I'm waiting because I know the TNGA-L platform is just around the corner.  Also, the Acura TLX Type-S is set to make a come back, and that is also on the short list of cars to upgrade to. One thing is for sure...I'll miss this little beast when it's gone.
I don't remember Mobile network standby taking up so much battery life before.  Might have to bite the bullet and just do a factory reset later tonight...

I mean, for my usage I am noticing more mobile network usage than before.  Not as bad as that guy with 24% network usage but still a little more than I used to notice.
Mazda doesn't install catch cans on their cars.  This was covered in the recent thread on Direct Injection problems (SavageGeese).
What, you don't think the Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross is an awesome FWD CVT CUV?  /s
That 4Runner is made in Japan too, at one of the factories that also make Lexus.  Did you watch that StraightPipes review of the 4Runner?
I used to hate Toyota because of their shitty interiors and poor driving characteristics. 
 Their Camry and Corolla from like 2 generations ago were awful inside and out.  I was briefly considering a manual Corolla XRS 8 years ago, when I knew jack shit about cars, and was quite turned off by the interior, steering feel and the clutch/shifter.

As I learned more about cars, and about how Toyota actually does things and why it makes the decisions it does, I started to warm up to them.  I figured out that they were actually playing the long game by focusing on reliability so much that nobody is able to topple them.  Public perception has been changed to the point where most people are likely to associate Toyotas with reliable cars, even if they don't really know much about cars.

Now that Toyota is following through with their promises and implementing TNGA tech along with drastic interior and exterior improvements (ex. 2018 Camry), they've got me to reverse my opinion of them (and Lexus) to the point where I'm seriously considering a next gen Lexus IS350.  I still think that Toyota has a ways to go when it comes to sportiness in the rest of their lineup, but they're really nailing everything else.

Hmm... maybe they use cooled EGR to lower cylinder temps (in addition to controlling nox)?  It's essentially exhaust gas rerouted back into the intake to lower the oxygen content, if I'm not mistaken, and Mazda was specific in pointing out that this was a thing on the CX-9 2.5L turbo engine.
Unless I'm missing something here about the SkyActiv-X engine, this will always be a problem with engines that only use direct injection and have no way to catch or clean off the crap that will accumulate on the valves from the PCV valve routing that shit back into the intake.  
Yeah, brand new modular platform, premium interior, kept the V6 and made the exterior design so much better. They even stuck with the traditional (and superior) transmission lever and didn't do buttons, dials or whatever.
Probably helps a tiny bit with airflow, but mostly for style.
I'm okay with some auto stuff like auto headlights, those don't malfunction (although I wouldn't pay a premium for them either). But auto wipers? How hard is it to move your right thumb and flick the stalk down?

Now we see the reason for Jahad's mask?  He's not actually looking at the mirror, so he can't be deleted until he takes the mask off.
Rofl yes, on my speed 3 all it needs is a light coating of moisture and the wipers go berserk half the time, and the other half they don't wipe as often as I'd expect them to.
Automatic 'rain sensing' wipers.  They sometimes activate on their own because of dust or pollen on the windshield sensor, and that results in the wipers screeching across a dry windshield when you least expect it.  The sensors are also incorporated into a more expensive windshield design, again because of the sensor (which detects obfuscation, light conditions, etc).  Because of this, I only turn on automatic wipers when it's actually raining - defeating the purpose of automatic wipers in the first place.
There are different levels of power within Dragon too.  Bakuzan was a Dragon level, but he was completely ineffective against Gouketsu, who is also Dragon level.  I don't think Darth Vader would be high Dragon level, but I also don't think that he's just a Demon level either.
I thought it was quite obvious from the way Genus was talking about Saitama breaking his limits, and Gyoro-Gyoro sending RR and Bug God to wear Garou down mentally and physically.  It should have been obvious anyway from the last few chapters where we see Garou getting stronger and stronger after every fight, until he was confident enough to say that both RR and BG are nothing compared to Master Bang.
I approve of this new quality shitposting format.
Star Wars power levels and OPM power levels are completely separate though, so we can't directly compare the two.  It's ridiculous to even try, you'd have Saitama cracking Star Destroyers in half with a serious punch, and deflecting Deathstar blasts with his shiny bald head.  But if we try anyway, I still think he'd be in the Dragon category.  There are gaps in power inside that category, where Bakuzan was definitely far below Gouketsu even though both are classed as Dragon-level, and Gouketsu himself stated that there are monsters even more powerful than himself.  

I still hold that DV, if considered as a mysterious being, would still be Dragon-level if he was somehow translated into the OPM power level. 
You're right, it was on this sub.  Someone was explaining how money ("beans") is allocated by various manufacturers on their vehicles and said that the major Japanese OEM that they work for does not even bother to acknowledge FCA vehicles when it comes to the tear down analysis.  My guess is that they work for Toyota.
So the part with Jahad at the end is like when you're sneaking to the garage to get the car so you can drive your friends to a party, but your dad finds out.
The way Jahad so casually flings his arm and creates a huge chasm between him and the others is so amazingly well done.  Not only does it show that he has tons of power to spare, it highlights the metaphorical gap which separates him and the mirror-seeking party by actually creating a physical one, cut right through solid rock.  If he had moved that attack just 10 meters further he would have probably killed most of the party right there.
>After midnight last Sunday, a man in a Ford Edge traveling down a rural road in Addison Township, Michigan crossed into the oncoming lane, and struck a 2013 Ford Fiesta, which had two occupants inside.

>The Edge driver has been put in jail, and the police deputy claims that he admitted to drinking.

Not to take anything away from this tragic accident, but this is the main reason why I stay way the hell over to the right when driving on said country roads.  My wheels are even riding on the solid white line sometimes, depending on how close the oncoming traffic is riding to the center line, and I try to take the turns so that I'm not in the apex at the same time as the oncoming traffic.  I'm also ready to ditch onto the shoulder if need be. 
Synergies, model substitution and nitpicking:  Enough%

I love watching videos or reading stuff by Dave Coleman.
I'm glad that Toyota keeps reliability at the top of the list (Alex even says that a naturally aspirated V6 should be more reliable than a turbo 2.0) and has added sportiness without sacrificing much.  The Camry V6 gets just 1 less combined MPG than the Accord 2.0T despite being like 300lbs heavier and having more hp - this is probably because the engine can run both Otto and Atkinson cycles (the latter is more fuel efficient because the piston has to overcome less friction on the compression stroke), and the V6 doesn't have to dump fuel to keep the cylinders cool when power is needed.
So Master Bang can slaughter him like he did to FF Djinn?
Think of super rich people like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates as the Fremen, and the businesses of the world as the sandworms.

Now what happens if everyone has free money and can buy whatever they want? That's what happened to the Fremen in the end.
I'm continually impressed by Alex and his attention to details, concise speech delivery, video editing and just overall production quality.  As for the Camry XSE V6...I was at the Canadian auto show last Sat. and out of all the vehicles in Toyota's lineup, none of them drew as much attention as that white Camry XSE V6 with the red leather (softex) interior.  It's no Camaro ZL1 and remains a FWD family sedan despite outward appearances, but I don't recall the previous Camry getting this sort of reception.

Disaster Level: Dragon
> Katakuri has a complex about his appearance because he was humiliated as a kid and therefore hides his appearance; Luffy on the other hand as been ridiculed by Katakuri for hours, yet, he doesn't let it affect him.

I would also like to point out that almost everybody who has seen Katakuri without the scarf has been terrified of his appearance and shuns / ridicules him.  Luffy, so far, has been the only one to have seen Katakuri in his most vulnerable state and yet has not acted any differently than before.

Luffy also aims for the top - to be the Pirate King - and he already acts natural about it.  Few people would dare to stand near Whitebeard, let alone speak to him so casually, but Luffy didn't even think about it.  Almost nobody would dare get in the way of a Tenryuubito, but Luffy punched one out without hesitation.  He actually launched himself in an attack against a Yonko and went hand-to-hand with her (albeit briefly), and now he's dueling the most accomplished fighter in BM's crew, getting his ass handed to him, and still coming back for seconds when he could have easily escaped.  You have to respect that sort of single minded vision and determination, even grudgingly.
I didn't know this was an Engineering Explained video until after I clicked it. Pretty good watch.
Seconded for reading Frank Herbert's Dune. The other ones in the original books are good too, but God Emperor is also a stand out imo because of Leto Atreides.
Funny thing is, the palmaries grew in scale and number so fast that they achieved Pardot Kynes' dream earlier than expected, and the sandworms were driven off into smaller and smaller patches of desert. The greenification of Arrakis was itself the best way of getting rid of Shai Hulud but the irony is that this would also destroy both Fremen and the only source of spice that the universe depended on. Leto knew what he was doing, as he understood more than anyone else that he who controls the spice has his hands on the reins of universal power.
Ironically, it also destroyed the Fremen in the end. They who were shaped by the desert were unmade by their greatest dream.

I just went to a local shop in Markham, Ontario.
Interestingly enough, rumor is that Subaru is going to be doing its own electrification of the STI with some kind of hybrid power assist shit on the rear wheels.

It'll probably make like 307hp though.
Do you think IS350 F-Sport competes against the A4 and the 330i, rather than the S4 / 340i?  I feel like it sort of tries to sit a little bit above the A4 and 330i, but that V6 - as good and reliable as it is - isn't on the same level as the turbo 6s.  Is that necessarily a bad thing?  :/
> The 350 is better, and would be the only variant I would buy. It won't haul you to 60 in under 5 seconds, but it will be powerful enough to feel some excitement and not feel slow during spirited driving.


Thanks... I didn't realize it weighed that much at 3800lbs.  It's not even that big of a car, is it the AWD system, older Lexus N platform?  Or just the luxury stuff that weighs it down?
It's one of the few manga series that I've read which gets better as the chapters pile on.  There's a reason why it's been going on for like 20 years now and it's **still** improving upon what is already manga excellence.  
Question for you u/savagegeese, you seemed to really like the Lexus IS350 (with the exception of the lack of a manual), which as you know has the D4S system on the engine (among other things).  I intend to keep the car 8 - 10 years or longer.

Did you think the IS350 with that 2GR-FSE V6 had way more than enough power for street driving?  Compared to the turbo I6/V6 in the 340i / S4, is it really **that** much behind in terms of power / performance?  Basically, I'm looking for something that is super reliable (toyota/lexus), AWD, sharp handling, easy to daily drive, tons of power for the street.  I feel like the IS350 fits the bill.
Good point, I did intend to keep my car long term (7 - 10 years).  On my 2010 speed 3, the only feasible mounting point for the catch can is on the driver's side, right below the airbox.  You have to route two lengths of good quality hose from the PCV pipes, which are located on the engine towards the passenger side / middle-ish, down to the catch can.  Sounds good, right?  

* Did I mention that the PCV pipes are located in a very, very tight spot that makes it difficult to get your hand in there?  I did this while lying on my back, car supported by one of those ramps (and chocked, of course), cursing the entire time.  It sucked.

* Did I mention that the hoses did not come included with the can?  Of course they didn't.  I *carefully* chose some lengths of hose that were reinforced with fiber, were flexible and thick enough, and were rated for resistance to oil.  I was not careful enough - a hose popped off because it had dried out from exposure to engine heat (or something) and become rigid enough to work the clamp loose.

* One of the hoses I used was too long and there was water pooling in the middle where the hose dipped low - I had to remove that fucking hose, recut it and reinstall it again.  

* Dang, asking my mechanic to remove the under tray on every oil change (to drain the can) eventually weakened the tray and screw mounting points enough that a bit of it (under the driver's foglight housing) flopped down while I was driving on the highway.  There is now a missing 2" section of undertray where it had vaporized as it was dragged on the asphalt at highway speeds.

I'm sure catch cans on some other cars can be installed and maintained much more easily than on my speed 3, but this experience taught me a lot more than I wanted to learn.

You can just hear the "wtf were they thinking" overtones in his voice as he's talking about the PCV routing all that unburnt fuel and oil vapor back into the intake.  Fantastic video again... very well presented and, more importantly, easy to understand even for people who don't know anything about cars.

This is one of the reasons why I'm impressed with Toyota going more mainstream with their D4S system - they really could have just left it as DI only and gotten away with it like everyone else...but they didn't.
Not that much in the summer, but it was a lot of water and other shit in the winter due to condensation.  I just did it every month and a half to be 100% safe.
I used to have a catch can in my speed 3, let me explain why it turned out to be a bad idea.

* It has to be regularly emptied, which I did religiously every month and a half.  If you can't even get the average consumer to check their oil once every month, you sure as hell aren't getting them to stick their hands into the engine bay, turn a valve and drain out a foul smelling concoction of coffee-colored water, unburnt gas and other shit into a plastic cup.

* liquids in the catch can will probably freeze, or at least slush up, in extreme cold temps

* the hoses and can are not free and take up space in the engine bay

* if a hose pops off the can (which is possible and has happened to me) the car will idle strangely and ultimately fail to start until the hose is reconnected.  The average consumer will not know what happened, and how to fix it.

I got rid of the thing, got the valves cleaned back in 2016 and moved on with life, ain't nobody got time for that shit.
So good that even [warlords](https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/6ffl87/i_accidentally_purchased_a_nigerian_warlods_land/) love them!
As you have pointed out, warranty is completely separate from reliability and neither is a substitute for the other for one simple fact - the consequences of an unreliable car are immediately obvious and directly affect you.  For example, I was driving my dad's old Accord on the highway when the transmission shifted into fuck you mode.  I can't remember whether it was neutral or 2nd/3rd gear, but it was mildly traumatic to be cruising at 100 km/h just before that happened.  Even if it had been under warranty, I still had to deal with a transmission shifting itself into oblivion as I was going at highway speeds and could have gotten into an accident.

So even if a car had an absurdly long warranty with a high mileage limit, it would only be worthwhile if it was *at least* decently reliable, which I fully believe applies to newer Hyundais and Kias now.
I personally feel that taking chances and driving innovation is important, but this should not be done at the expense of reliability.  After all, what use is a car if it doesn't start, or is in the shop every couple of months or whatever?  Unfortunately, I think that the Germans are competing with each other on taking chances, so there is zero incentive to slow the pace.
Ahahaha I know this game, I say a funny voice line amirite?

Overwatch I'll put an end to your sad story.
Double tap power key to launch camera, oh yeah! Anybody else find new changes? I also noticed the screen mode has more variability options in the slider for the screen tone between warm and cool.
I don't own one (yet) but I know you can park it anywhere at work and not raise any eyebrows like "oh damn, he got a <insert expensive brand>, did he get a raise!?".  To them it's just a sensible, plain looking Golf.  You can drive co-workers to team events and lunches and not even get a single comment about the car.


Hmm... just wondering, what don't you like about One Piece?  Manga or Anime?
Fairy Tail was good only for fan service...nothing more.  It's always "uhhhh ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Nakama power up incoming!!" and the magic was so one-dimensional and tied too much to martial arts moves.  Same with Black Clover.  Fun reads, but if I had to rank them on a scale of 1 - 10 where 10 is One Piece, they'd be around the 4 - 5 mark.
I'm getting real fucking tired of Deku losing his fights, or not definitively dominating his opponent/opponents.  I know he's still basically brand new to his powers, but damn, even Kenichi in History's Strongest Disciple was able to one shot his opponents and display feats of strength and skill way more than Deku is...
I wonder.... if this was the inspiration picture.

Wow... that's awesome.  The blades almost look like wisps of light.

Too thin-looking, and way too light.  The lightsabers from Episodes 7 and 8 are way better as they have real weight and heft, and you can almost feel the destructive power as the blades clash, crackle with energy and cut solid rock and armor.
They're all good dogs, Brent.
Uhh... in Canada they're 19" Pretorias, which look nicer (IMO) than the Spielbergs that are shown in the review.  When Jakub said they're $250, it's not "$250 / wheel", it's literally a $250 option to get 19" Spielbergs instead of Pretorias.  
You realize some things **after** owning a hot hatch like my speed 3, that it can be better to fly under the radar and drive on your own terms rather than be judged and watched by everyone around you.
Dunno if you follow any news from Ford, but they're in crisis mode right now after Mark Fields was fired.  They put in Hackett, and the guy is basically tasked with axing stuff and showing investors that Ford is committed to turning the stock price around and to get back to the $15 range.  High on the list of things to axe, or cut back spending on, is Ford Performance - guaranteed.
I also want to say that your closing statement about GTI vs Golf R is a good one.  The GTI is $30,595, the premium GTI is $35895, and the Golf R is $42,065...that's a difference of $11470 between the base GTI and the base R (all prices in CAD), therefore the base GTI is about 73% the cost of a Golf R while the premium GTI (Autobahn) is 85%.

You either get the base GTI with your choice of transmission and save nearly $12k over getting the R, or you do what it takes to get the R.  The $6170 difference between the Autobahn GTI and the base R can be closed with 1 year (or less) of saving up money for a bigger down payment, and unless you really don't care about the power and AWD, then it makes more sense to go for the R because you're already spending that much money - you might as well go for what you want because the goal is well within reach.
It also doesn't have a huge spoiler, or 20" wheels, or a ton of badges / stickers / air vents all over the place.  It *basically* looks like a regular Golf from all angles.  The customers themselves don't even know it's supposed to be VW's top level hot hatch, to them it's just an AWD Golf R with extra pep.
It's still impressive as hell though, when you actually did a real launch next to Yuri.
@8:01  Holy SHIT... I have to ask, were the tires actually hooking up?!  That seems... unnaturally fast to 100km/h, damn!

Also, Rex is a good boy, he knows what's up.
If I'm buying a Golf R, I'm looking for a near 300hp AWD hot hatch that hides in plain sight, but can rocket to 100km/h in 4.5 seconds.  Getting it in a unique color is contrary to the factory sleeper look.
None other.
Ford Performance was on the chopping block the moment Hackett stepped into the role of CEO.  There is no way that this guy would ignore this flamboyant and less-than-wildly-profitable part of Ford.
Thanks man, looking forward to getting an IS350 AWD F-SPORT if it's still what I want in 2 or 3 years. 
How does it feel on acceleration with the V6 and the 8 speed? Do you feel like it is very quick on the street and in highway passing?  

The reason why I'm asking is because I want something like the 340i or S4 and their turbocharged 6 cylinder engines, but I don't trust anything German and I was really hoping Lexus would trickle down their turbo V6 from the LS into the IS350. Chances of that happening may be slim, judging by how conservative Lexus is, so I'm guessing that it'll continue to be that V6 for the next generation...
New engine? You mean the 2GR-FKS where the previous one was the 2GR-FSE?
I've had my HTC 10 since May 2016 and it's been almost perfect so far.  I hate the screen polarization when I have my sunglasses on, but everything else about it has been running in top shape minus a few small and faint scratches near the bottom of the screen.  I'm due for a phone upgrade this year, but I still really like this phone.  HTC outdid themselves with this model.
I screamed so loud my dva body pillow came apart
This is what I'm looking forward to, if I choose to get an IS350.  Dunno yet if I want to wait until the next gen IS350 is out and get a used 2018 or 2019 model, or go all in and get it on the new TNGA-L platform, possibly a new engine, new transmission, etc.

I had to watch this as therapy after being reminded of the Michael Bay Transformers.
The 4Runner is made at the Tahara plant, the same factory that makes a bunch of Lexus models. It is also billed as the most computerized and robotized factory in the world. This would help explain the high build quality. 

I was greatly impressed when they went through its features such as the crawl mode dials, the 4 hi/lo AWD, massive HVAC controls (easier to operate with gloves on), skid plate, and that most awesome power rear window. Sure, the infotainment sucks, the hood scoop is totally fake, but the 4Runner gives off this aura of invincibility, like no weather or terrain short of a natural disaster can keep it from doing its job for years on end. 
Yeah, my SDRSP is completely off limits as far as withdrawing money for any purchase short of a house.  The TFSA is about 2 contributions away from being maxed.  You could raid the TFSA for money since it's tax free and the withdrawal amount is added back in the following year as contribution room, but dat lost opportunity cost tho.
After the last panel, all I could think about was that Royal Ripper made the biggest mistake of his monster existence right there.
It was a joke...and if you read further they actually go and call out BMW for no longer being the ultimate driving machine, and such.

>>In regards to the company engineer's claims that the Toyota Camry has booted BMW from its position as Mazda's driving dynamics benchmark, Brown says, "The new Camry is very good, I don’t think that anybody’s gonna deny that. And frankly, with a few exceptions, BMW’s dynamic qualities have catered more toward a comfort audience rather than a sport audience."
It wasn't even that impressive, the tire just blew in and happened to catch like 5 of them standing stupidly in a cluster even though they heard the ult voice line.
Is you a gril?
Haha, literally one of the first things I did in the Civic Type-R at this year's Canadian auto show was to yank the visor to see if it moved.  On a side note, sitting in the Type-R gave me feelings that I shouldn't have for a car.  
Did you notice how his complexion changed from grey to a more healthy reddish-pinkish tone?
Your concern is that the Type-R will be killed off in NA before you get a chance at one, but I don't think this will happen.  It is built on the same line as the other Civic hatchbacks in Swindon (UK), so there are significant cost savings right there.  Like others are saying, it's a global car and there seem to be less barriers to offering the Type-R in NA as it's coming from the same factory as the base hatchback.  Its engine shares many of the same components as the 2.0T in the Accord and will likely be used in some form for other products from Honda and Acura, so there's more cost savings again.
Thanks for the detailed explanation!  That's very interesting to read...and also a bit sad to think of all those young guys who get in, take the cash, blow it all and get out of the military with zero skills and nowhere to go.
This whole sub is about making poor financial choices in exchange for enjoyment, and I'm no less guilty than anybody here.  I bought my speed 3 new and financed it, and I have enjoyed driving the car since picking it up in Dec 2009.  I had a beater '02 Civic prior to the speed 3, and it was paid off, perfectly adequate and super reliable.  However, what's the point of making money if you don't spend it on what you love - provided you can still save and invest to meet your financial goals later in life?

It's all about allocation of money, and I choose to allocate a portion of it on a car that will give me driving pleasure.  Having fun while driving is a tangible benefit I'll experience every day, and there is no other substitute.
You can sleep in a 911, but you can't drive a house!
Another question, when they leave the military, are they taught any skills they can use to ease them into a civilian job to keep them going?
I'm sure you realize the irony of your quoted statement as much as I do :)

(I'm Canadian)

Also, I guess the point I was trying to get across is whether these people discriminate against ALL foreign, or all non-exotic foreigns (BMW, Audi, MB, Lexus, Kia, etc.), or only against Japanese/Korean brands.
Oh.... it's a stepped approach?  It wasn't clear when I read the rules, lol.
It depends on the interest rate of the loan.  If it's, say, 3%, then take on the loan and invest the cash you would have otherwise spent.  Over the term of the loan, that investment is likely to make you more money than if you had spent it upfront (assuming you invested wisely).
What year IS350 and mileage?  Also, why do you feel the IS350 is worlds apart from the Camry, is it purely because of the RWD + longitudinal V6, the handling, etc?  I"m asking because I'm interested in getting an IS350, but not for another 2 - 3 years and I still haven't decided if I'll buy a used 2017 - 2018 then, or go for a new 2020/2021 model.  Just curious...
> 86 & GT

Does this mean they drive a lot of BRZ/FR-S/Toyota 86 and Mustang GTs?  I'm not familiar with US military personnel spending habits, aside from what I hear on reddit.
It depends on the interest on the car loan.  If it's 0%, you're borrowing that money at no cost for the term of the loan.  Assuming you didn't get screwed on the final price of the car, of course.

Even if the APR is like 3% - 4%, it's still typically below what you'd get if you had invested that money wisely.  You could pay $30k cash and get the car outright, but if you're offered a loan for the full amount at 3% APR over 60 months then it's probably better to keep your $30k invested over that 5 year period and make payments on the car loan.
If you withdrew $5000 or less, you pay a 10% withholding tax...so is that being taxed at 10%?  I think I'm missing something here.
It still doesn't excuse this sort of predatory behavior from the salespeople.  It's not like these poor, desperate, stupid or ill-informed people walk up to an ordering kiosk, punch in a bunch of numbers and drive away with that used car - the salespeople are very much at fault for using sleazy tactics, or even outright aggression to help the sale along.
What happens if you get rich enough and you buy a Ferrari? Is that buying foreign, or would you suddenly get a free pass because 'Ferrari'?
I went digging into the rules of a Canadian RSP (outside of Quebec) for withdrawing money (outside of buying a home or whatever else may be exempt) and holy shit...

* Up to $5,000 - 10% Tax
* $5,000 to $15,000 - 20% Tax
* Amounts over $15,000 - **30%** Tax

~~So if I went and  pulled out $15001, I only get like $10500, which is then reported as income and taxed as such, so I actually get way less than that.~~

My bad, I must have misread it.  If I withdrew $15001, the first $5k may be taxed at 10%, then the next $10k is taxed at 20%, and the final $1 is taxed at 30%.  Still a bad idea, considering the lost opportunity for growing that money....
They just care that they have the same specs and pass safety. I would replace them at the first opportunity with a good set of all seasons like Michelin AS3+ and winter tires on steelies for next winter.

Truth. It was like -20c a couple of weeks ago and I had my gloves on. Got in, started the car, adjusted the heat and fan using the physical knobs, and even rolled the seat heater control all with ski gloves on. Touchscreen controls for these? No thanks, you can keep that shit where it belongs - on shit cars like the Model 3.

Calling it now - Katakuri will win this, and only Oda is capable of getting us to want both Luffy **and** his opponent to win.  Think about all of Luffy's previous "real" 1v1 epic fights - we always wanted Luffy to win and Doflamingo/Enel/Arlong/etc. to lose.  But Katakuri?  The man is supremely talented and honorable, he's outfighting Luffy despite everything and it would feel off if he lost this without a proper explanation for his defeat.  

I'm predicting that both will be knocked out, Katakuri regains consciousness first and retrieves his spear, intending to finish Luffy off because the latter is out of haki after using G4: Snakeman.  As Luffy faces certain death, he will smile...which leads Katakuri to put his weapon away and tell him to get out of Mirrorland.  He'll acknowledge Luffy as a superb fighter, and look forward to a proper rematch one day.
He could only access the donut form after he has thrown off the expectations that were placed on him, so in effect he actually powered up.  And his moves have such funny names, totally incongruous with their power - grilled mochi, diced mochi, block mochi, flowing mochi, peerless donuts, and now this ... this donut man form.
Looks like he got an Ecoboost, from the Ford.ca site:

>3.31:1 Limited Slip Rear Axle ratio is standard with the 2.3L EcoBoost® engine and 6-speed manual transmission; available with the 2.3L EcoBoost® engine and 10-Speed SelectShift® Automatic Transmission.
My friend had the same year of Pathfinder and it was a fantastic SUV like you said, full body on frame, built like a tank, superb 4WD system for getting unstuck, went everywhere and did everything.  He only ditched it because of rust issues, and it's STILL being driven around by its current owner somewhere.

The Nissan of today is pure trash, and I suspect it's because of the Nissan-Renault alliance and also the brand's current direction of repackaging old shit under new exteriors in order to boost profits.
This is one of the major reasons why I haven't already bought a Mustang GT.  I love the car and its look, I love the power and the sound of the V8 going at full tilt, but we just had a few snow days in my city and it was tough going even with a set of new Gislaved Nordfrosts on steelies in my speed 3 (driving slow of course, no boost).  I can only have 1 car as my DD and fun toy, so I have to choose carefully :(
This is how the aftermarket keeps preying on the uninformed masses.  It is how I went and modded my speed 3 (with parts recommended on the big MS3 forums) before I really even knew what I was doing.  If I could do it all again, I would have just kept it stock and only swapped out the tires, rear motor mount, and added a short shift bracket - literally everything else has been a waste of time and money.  If you want a faster car, **buy** that faster car.

The only comment in there that is anywhere near positive is the one about the seats, and even that's damning with faint praise.  Like... "I ate from this restaurant because I was literally starving.  Their prices were cheap."
!RemindMe 1 day
No way, that dude went out with a bang, doing what he loved.  The 370z is going to be suddenly axed, like a long standing dead tree, and a new FWD CVT CUV will be planted in its place.
What?  The Nissan FM platform is from 2001 and isn't that the same in the G37 and Q50?
How much does it cost anyway?  
I've said it before, and I'll say it **again** - Nissan is the FCA of Japan. But even that's unfair to FCA, as the latter's build quality is probably better than Nissan's and they have *more* legit performance cars at a better price point. 

People love to tell me off when I shit on Nissan, then you read long term reviews like this and you have to wonder what else might be wrong with other cars in the lineup.
You don't even need a manual driving course, I learned manual basically by myself in 2 - 3 days.  Once you learn how to control the clutch (ie. how much to press the pedal or let up on it before it starts to bite) then everything else falls into place, including hill starts.  Just avoid riding the clutch (ie. holding the clutch at the bite point) and you can even learn it on your new car.
> People argued that it was somehow a nerf because they wouldn't know if the enemy they could now see through the wall was low hp or not and couldn't go kill it. 

Man, if I ever became a multi-billionaire, it'll suck major ass because there won't be anything left that I can't buy and therefore I can't dream about it.  
True enough.  I hope that something like that is available come 2020 as I'm looking to upgrade to AWD high performance and a 400hp SH-AWD TLX Type-S would be sweet.
Is the 4th gen the one being made in China now?
I know exactly how this happened - r/cars is a generalized forum to talk about cars, hosted on the largest and most well-known internet forum in the world (to my knowledge anyway).  There are manufacturer and model-specific forums but some of them are very obviously sponsored and curated by the manufacturer and/or the aftermarket that feeds off the target audience.  Sure, those forums have 'general' forums but nobody thinks to go to a Lexus forum's general forum to talk about the new Veloster N.  

There are 'forums' like on Jalopnik, but Kinja is literally Hitler/Satan and anyway those discussions are limited to the article.
This is a really enjoyable watch from start to finish, your combined enthusiasm is infectious and the editing is perfect.  It seriously made me turn and look out the window at my 2010 Speed 3 and long to get into it and drive it the way that you guys are driving that Veloster.  I literally got NO work done at all for the last half hour, thanks to you guys and reddit.
Damn man, Hyundai is going all in here, seriously impressing me far more than they ever did just a few years ago.  In my opinion, this may be just one part of their strategy to get more market share, but it is the most relevant part **to me**.  Appealing to the enthusiast market is not nearly as profitable as making the nth-iteration of a CUV-type vehicle, but it does show a level of acknowledgement that goes beyond just a body kit and red seatbelts.  It says to the world that Hyundai is here, and *they're* not.

I was watching a BBC documentary last night titled "Secrets of Wild India" and Attenborough said a very interesting thing about the peacock - peahens will flock only to the peacocks with the most extravagant feathers because they are a proof of the bird's strength and genetic potency that cannot be faked.  If you think about it, those tail feathers are heavy, they require a lot of preening and maintenance, and predators will likely find it easier to catch the peacocks that are weighed down by their plumage, and yet those peacocks are still running around with a big FUCK YOU sign on their ass.

Maybe this is the same with manufacturers and we're all peahens chasing after the peacocks?  haha.
Definitely Toyota.  Subaru gave the STI like 5hp between 2004 - 2014 or some shit.  If you want 15hp, then you'll need to wait 30 years.
There is an Acura-exclusive turbo V6 engine that the company announced about a couple weeks ago, along with the return of the Type-S trim. 
Mazda abandoning their MPS lineup is going to have consequences for them in the future, when Hyundai's N cars and Kia's Stingers are running rampant all over the place.  You can't just throw away the speed, then sit on your ass for 4 - 10 years and suddenly pull another one out and hope people flock back to you.
Hyundai the type of car manufacturer to do what Mazda thinks is childish.
Bro, let's see you ride a flying sheep, take its skin, then cut the head off a snake lady who can turn people into stone, use your winged sandals lent by Hermes in order to fly away, and later mount the rotting snake-haired head onto a magic shield.  Ain't no V8 can match those feats.

I want to sit down by your last pic and just pet them both, but I'd be afraid to wake them up. So cute...
Jim Corbett always treated hunting with respect. In this case, he hunted not for sport but for necessity - to help the villagers, otherwise they'd just keep getting killed one after the other.
It's not just a book, it's a series of them.. like Man Eaters of Kumaon, the Leopard of Rudraprayag, and More Man Eaters of Kumaon.

He painted a vivid picture of his travels through India as he hunted man-eating tigers and leopards, and you get to share in his deep love for the country, in his addiction for wanderlust and adventure, and his strong desire to help the people who are in need.  The India of his time was beautiful, majestic, full of splendor and untold experiences.  Contrast this with his unembellished accounts of finding the remains of the man-eaters' victims, gripped by horror and a growing sense of urgency as the shadows grow longer in the deep gloom beneath the boughs, knowing that the killer could be crouched nearby, watching....waiting for that moment he fails to check his back, or notice that the jungle has gone suddenly quiet.
The guy who shot it was a legend, Jim Corbett.  Highly recommend picking up his books and reading them, the words are guaranteed to send chills up and down your skin.  At the same time, they understate just how much courage and skill it must have taken for him to go out alone to hunt these things, sometimes even at night, and at one point even coming within striking distance of the man eaters he was hunting.

~~In particular, this Champawat tiger nearly got him on a couple of occasions, once where he was just about to walk by a boulder on a mountain trail, and another when he visited an abandoned village.~~  I was mistaken, that was the Thak maneater (I think).  The man had nerves of fucking steel, supreme confidence in his abilities and a literal spidey sense for danger.
Waiting a year also gives you a chance to see if there are any issues we don't know about, like with the Focus RS and the headgaskets, but if the price is right I think it's a good buy anyway thanks to warranty.
There's this layaway shop called Aaron's that was advertising a PS4 for like $40/month over a 24 month period.  Surely you can afford $40 a month, right?  It's only $10 a week, just stop having your morning coffee ($2 coffee x 5 days) and you too can own a PS4!
No wacky waving inflatable tube men?  I'm disappoint.
I see you subscribe to the [sneaky backstab 1H philosophy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPv5VK0TEKE&t=0m11s)
Just wait a year, people will be dumping the Stinger GT because they move onto the next new, shiny thing.

Soldier, you did okay.
Wolf has wares, if you have coin.
Perhaps you care to explain why you are standing so close to an Etch-A-Sketch with the opening scene drawn.
It depends. If it's something like a Mustang or Camaro, then a certain level of loudness is expected from them. Loud enough to let you know that there's a V8 with 455 - 460hp under the hood and to make people turn their heads when it roars past at speed, but reasonably toned when just driving around town. You don't buy muscle cars to be another generic family sedan or CUV on the road, you buy them for their presence.

On something like my speed 3, or a WRX or some other econobox? Hell no, I want to blend in and not turn heads, just leave me alone to drive spiritedly without attracting attention.
I'd say that this is almost certainly going to happen, since they talked about the Type-S TL, which is the precursor to the TLX.
What do you mean knocks the V6 out?  Acura announced that they have a turbo V6 engine exclusively for their lineup, not shared with anything from Honda.
I'm tremendously excited for the next gen Acura TLX, I'm hoping that we'll get a TLX that's taking all of the same cues from the RDX prototype while adding in that new turbo V6 plus SH-AWD and ditching the ZF9 for the Honda 10 speed.  I'll even grudgingly accept a push button shifter, especially if it's integrated as nicely as on the RDX center console.
**My contribution**:  the use of the term "double edged sword", used to describe something that is both an advantage and a disadvantage.  This is nonsense as you'd need a tremendous amount of force applied against the leading edge of the sword (the edge facing the enemy) to knock it back into you.  Even then, it has to overcome the angle at which your wrists can rotate forward and back and the tendency for your elbows and upper arm to dip and cause your arms to retract towards your body so that the 3ft~ blade is actually at an angle that won't cause you harm.  Suppose you DID get struck by something that has enough force to do all of that and send the blade slashing back at you while breaking your arms/wrists...then you're dead because you tried to duel with [this](https://3d4igz27oxtl2iwox73y9smh-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/media/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/04/9-elephant-flips-s2.jpg), or you were freakishly unlucky.

But if you try to explain this to people, you end up looking like a know it all arrogant prick.
I think this whole thread has been about Subaru and their headgaskets.  There's something about boxer engines that precluded their rise in popularity and I think it has everything to do with the fact that the inline and V engines are just better designs.
It's fine, the sea has a particular wavelength that restrains Devil Fruits.

I have a Paramilitary 2 as well, hands down the best folder I've ever owned in this price range. Extremely well made, with thoughtful touches like the jimping on the ricasso so you can choke up on the blade, and if the blade folds down while you're holding the knife, the ricasso is designed to stop harmlessly on your finger. I wouldn't recommend testing the latter feature, but if you carefully disengage the lock and slowly fold the blade down you'll be able to see what I mean.

I think this is the first real 1 v 1 where Luffy's opponent actually respects him and fights with him as an equal to the conclusion.  One might argue that Fujitora respected him, but I don't think so because that fight did not end with one of them KO-ed.  In all other fights, his opponent has always been looking down on him from start to finish.
Can someone explain to me why Willie and Eren did this?  

1) Willie exposes all about the Eldian empire and the Tybur family joining with Marley to keep the Eldians on the main continent under their thumb.  Why would he give away such a secret?

2) Eren bursts out and kills Wilie then basically declares war on Marley and seals the fate of all Eldians everywhere, basically blowing the Eldian peoples' so-called 'second chance' at redemption.  I get that he's mad about Marley sending titans over to the island, and the Marley empire is not about to just stop because Eren tells them to, but why attack at that location?  Is it because of the concentration of military personnel in there?
Have you watched any of the episodes where they show cars being made, like Mega Factories / Ultimate Factories?  I find those endlessly fascinating because you go from what are (essentially) raw materials into a fully functioning car within the span of hours on a continuously moving production line.
Excellent point, I didn't think of that!
>Katakuri allows Luffy to transform not because he's too tired to stop it, but because he respects Luffy and wants to fight him at his strongest.

This, right here.  When they first started fighting in mirror world, Katakuri was quite vocal about wanting to finish off Luffy with any means necessary.  It is likely that he would have even accepted outside help to put Luffy down, because he hadn't yet shed his image of the perfect Sweet Commander / big brother.  

He didn't respect Luffy then, but still fought without underestimating him because that's just his style.

It was only after trying his hardest to kill Luffy and failing, then being exposed for who he really is, that things started changing.  The 3 chefs reacted with horror at Katakuri's real appearance and personality and were killed.  Luffy, on the other hand, **treated Katakuri exactly the same** before and after the mochi shrine was destroyed.  I re-read that chapter and Oda drew it very clearly with Luffy saying "Our fight hasn't ended yet!" and running TOWARDS Katakuri, and the next panel shows the 3 chefs running away instead.  In the flashbacks, everyone runs from Katakuri.  Flambe and her men went from idol worship to full on paparazzi in the blink of an eye after seeing Katakuri without his scarf.  Luffy is the only one who does the opposite.

What really tipped the scale was Luffy running away to recover his haki and strength, then *returning* to mirror world where he had Katakuri effectively stranded.  He didn't have to come back, Katakuri even said that nobody would blame Luffy for running away, and yet he still came back to finish the fight.  From Katakuri's point of view, it would have seemed like Luffy had run away and quit, but he must have been very surprised to see him willingly come back....

Out of everyone that Katakuri had grown up with and met over his life, **only** Luffy accepted him for what he is even if he was lying on his back, guzzling donuts and tea while singing a stupid song, or being spat on and mocked by his own family and crew.  Only Luffy didn't try to hold Katakuri up to a false standard, and instead gave him the acknowledgement and respect that he actually wanted his entire life.  I'm glad that Oda showed this to us without having to spell it out in dialogue or introspective thought.
That sure looks like a $62k interior to me.

This is why I'm pleasantly surprised that the Accord still has the option for a manual and the Sport 2.0 is pretty well equipped and isn't a stripper model. 
Luffy can regenerate severe wounds by eating meat or drinking milk to instantly grow a tooth, maybe that's one of the hidden powers of his fruit - being able to 'bounce' back from injury.
I think he outperforms Luffy in that aspect, since he's awakened, he can regenerate a lost limb, he can use flowing mochi to move super fast... I think that awakening does more than just turn the environment into the material of the Paramecia, it might give a super boost to the user's powers.
Wait, what?  Katakuri can regenerate a lost limb?
But is there an issue with Toyota that makes them an inferior manufacturer?  I know Toyota isn't the bunch of lazy asses that people seem to think they are, otherwise they couldn't have risen to the top in car sales (until recently, I think) and consistently hold 1st/2nd places in reliability.  
Why do you think so?  And is that meant to be a compliment on Lexus, or is it said in the same breath as Acura and Honda?  Because Acura is literally a fancy Honda with only SH-AWD being mostly exclusive to Acura (iVTM-4 is actually SH-AWD, and is now on Honda vehicles).  Lexus has bespoke stuff that Toyota doesn't have like the RWD platform on the IS, the RC-F, GS-F, LS500, their turbo V6 engine...

>It will be Toyota in name and body design only - everything inside the car is the same familiar BMW stuff

This statement does not give me a good vibe.
What? Those were clearly Lexus vehicles in that ad. Are you sure you got it right?
Nope, unless it's an actual Mazdaspeed 6 that is AWD, over 300hp/300lb-ft and has a 6 MT. The new turbo Mazda 6 is AT only and FWD - if I was going to get a turbo FWD family sedan, I'll go for the Accord Sport 2.0T with the 6MT.
Have you always wanted to be on a waiting list for years, while only to be finally presented a car that reeks of cost cutting and poor QA but is passed off as 'the future'?  Do you cream your pants at the thought of zip-tied parts, cracked pillars, and panel gaps you can stick a hamster through? The Tesla Model 3 is for you.

If you don't like it, you're just not a real Silicon Valley boy.
I think that's the whole point of this commercial, showing that Lexus is spending time and effort to do it right.  If they obsess over this so much, then they're implied to have obsessed over the rest of the car and brand.  The reputation that Lexus has for quality and reliability is putting one near the top of the list of my future cars.
Damn, so close to invisibility too.
This sub circlejerks the Miata because of the reddit hivemind.  Say good things about the Miata, get tons of upvotes.  Say that you have no interest in one because it is a 2 seater, 2 door roadster that is impractical and doesn't have the power that I want out of the engine, and you'll get strawman arguments popping up like the one from the genius above.

*"Oh, you don't like the Miata, well let me ignore all of your valid arguments and prop up this strawman here, focus on the 'more power' comment and proceed to say that the MX-5 is faster than your Mazdaspeed 3 even though that is not the point of Miata vs Mazdaspeed 3 as a DD.  Next, I'll say shit like 'no sass, truth bruh' to make me sound like a good guy, while you keep sounding like a bad guy for not liking the Miata."*

I was ambivalent towards the Miata before, but now I'm tending towards dislike purely because of the circlejerking sheep that flock under its banner because reddit says so.  I'm sure it's a quick car on track because of momentum, it's super light, it's well engineered, handles great and all that.  It still doesn't change the fact that it's a 2 door, 2 seater roadster with zero practicality and not a whole lot of power.  My feelings don't change even if you put a 370z, or a Corvette in front of me - if I had to have just one car, it needs at least 2+2 seats, preferably 2 real rear seats.


Excellent point, old chap
.... I think I see the one you're talking about.  

It looks pre-molested by a mod bro, all the debadging is a huge red flag for me.  Passenger headlight looks all milky, interior is as greasy as a guido's hair.  I would either look elsewhere or offer something like 8k and see if they bite.  
Good for you
Well, year of the dog event is coming up in 2 days...
Uhh.... I don't see how this comment is about issues that haunt manufacturers, but I don't think you'll have any issues with something like this.  It's a naturally aspirated V6, manual (so you neatly avoid the Honda transmission problems that people are talking about in here) and it's a Honda.  Maybe the clutch might be going, but that really depends on how it was driven.  You can do tests to see if the clutch is still good.

How much is it?  I'm guessing it's a Canadian vehicle?
I have no interest in Miatas.  I know they drive well, but I crave more power, and I want my car to be far more practical than a 2 door roadster.
I had a CX-3 as a loaner while my turbo was being replaced back in 2015.  It wasn't very quick (obviously) but it drove quite well, had a much nicer interior than my speed 3, and did its daily driver duties diligently.  However, I longed for my speed 3 not only because it was like 3x quicker but because I missed the manual + heavy clutch, the manual parking brake with that satisfyingly metallic button and the hydraulic steering.  It makes me sad to see absolutely **nothing** in Mazda's current lineup that even tempts me in the least.
I don't know about Ford electronics or Hyundai interiors, and FCA has transmission issues with that ZF 9 speed and others, and these days I think even FCA is better than Nissan (although Nissan is still the FCA of Japan) but everything else sounds about right.
Subaru is notorious for using paint made from organic alfalfa and broken promises.
No, I think you're the first to mention this particular issue.  And yes, what blows my fucking mind is that we've been making manual transmissions since T-Rexes roamed the earth and we STILL can't get it right sometimes.
Sounds like they were trying for too much and ended up with the gearbox equivalent of a gunblade.  Not a good gun, not a good blade.
People like to think that golfers aren't true athletes, but you're using your whole damned body to whack that ball across a field.  You also need fine muscle control, hand eye coordination, and strong muscles also help to prevent injuries from the motion of hitting the ball.  Plus, you look good in those sweet endorsement deals if you're ripped as fuck.

Another sport that people don't think about are motor sports - racing bikes, cars, etc.  Being overweight may slow you down just that little bit and cost you the victory, every pound counts.  You need reflexes (of course), endurance and upper body / arm / wrist strength to wrestle with the wheel.  You need to be able to handle the adrenaline rush of going at speeds that will turn you into a red mist if you crash.  It's far different than just sitting in the seat of your Corolla and putting along at 30mph to the grocery store.
> The Audi TFSI engines were massive oil boats too. 1 liter every 500 km was considered NORMAL in the Audi warranty specs. Thats insane. Those engines were basically 2 strokes.

Yes, that is ridiculous.  No manufacturer should be able to get away with some words in the warranty booklet that absolve them of poor design.  
Not only the tuning, it has 2 dog clutches. If I understand correctly, they have little teeth on them so you can't slip them - the transmission has to disengage before the teeth can align, which results in clunky operation and momentary hesitation in power delivery.
What is the interest rate on your loans?  If it's high, pay that shit off first before putting anything into a car fund.
Two heads and horizontal too.  Doesn't this allow the coolant to remain on the gasket and eat away at it even when the car is off?
I'm doing this right now.  I can afford to buy a new car now and still meet my financial goals and responsibilities, but I keep telling myself that if I'm going to spend that much on a car, it'd better be a keeper for at least 10 years or longer.  So I put money away and invest it, and keep looking forward to future cars that might interest me like the next gen STI, TLX Type-S (assuming Acura makes one), or maybe a 4th gen IS350, or whatever.  I keep reassuring myself that waiting allows me to have the pick of the crop when it's time to buy, and that getting something new right now will only lead to buyer's remorse when the new gen vehicles are out.
Easy.  I just imagine myself, retired, out of money and working at Walmart as a doormat because I succumbed to new car fever when I was young, and suddenly I'm cured.

2010+ Mazda 3 has solved the rust issue, as far as I can tell, and I see quite a number of these running around here in Ontario.  I would not trade the G37 for a Mazda 3 to save gas, unless you can justify that the gas savings over the lifetime of the Mazda 3 will outweigh the cost out-of-pocket for you to trade in the G37 and get the Mazda.

As a **highly exaggerated** example, say you spend $1000 a month on gas for the G37, while the Mazda 3 will only eat up $500 a month on gas.  You trade in the G37 and have to pay $2000 extra to get the Mazda 3.  The Mazda 3 will pay for itself in 4 months, then you'll be saving $500 a month from there on.  Do this math based on extrapolated numbers from the Mazda 3 fuel economy (depending on engine choice) and you'll likely see that it's not worth trading in the G37 just to save money on gas.  Also, you know your G37 and what's wrong, and what's not wrong with it.  You can't say the same for a used Mazda 3.

If you're still set on going cheap and commuting in the city in a sandy and salt-filled environment, I would recommend a beater Civic or Corolla over any 2010 - 2013 Mazda 3.  Mazda was also in a weird transition phase between 2010 - 2012 or so, there was a mix of the old MZR engines and the first gen SkyActiv engines.  
I would never swap with someone else, you won't be able to sell the STI RA in 10 years for $75k if you're missing the original trunk lid and wing.
[Honda's "The Cog"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z57kGB-mI54).  Also, they did a little trollish mini commercial you might find on youtube that starts off just like Cog did, but the exhaust fails to hit the valves - "always use Genuine Honda parts".

>it should be noted that the entire rest of the world outside the USA gets the all-new 2.0L Turbo engine for their STI

Hold on a sec Matt, isn't this the EJ207 that you're talking about?  Or did I miss something while I was busy ignoring Subaru for the next 2 - 3 years?
Dealers: We know what we got.
>But in actually usable metric, being real world fuel economy, power, reliability, maintenance costs etc. Is this a positive thing for the end consumers?

My opinion is that this is an overall positive thing for the end consumer, but not in the way that you might expect.  I'll reference the 3.5L V6 Accord vs the new 2.0T Accord.  The take rate of the V6 has always been low compared to the I4, so the impact of said buyers is way less by comparison.  However the V6 is still a drag on the average fuel economy (as tested according to the EPA guidelines), it's a heavier engine so fuel economy goes down due to that, it also probably costs more to manufacture, and it probably doesn't benefit as much from R&D on the inline engines (correct me if I'm wrong), and I believe it is the same engine in the Acura lineup (making Acura a little less special).

Basically, my take on this is that Honda benefits by dropping the V6 from the Accord, which then benefits the consumer to some degree because Honda spends less on R&D/testing to meet fuel economy / emissions regulations, the car gets lighter, R&D and manufacturing costs are eased, packaging options are more flexible, interior and exterior get improvements from the freed-up cash, and now Acura can get the V6 (and upcoming V6 turbo) all to themselves.  

The packaging thing was the one I noticed the most since the Accord got the 2.0T.  Here in Canada if you had wanted a 9th gen 6MT V6 Accord, you had no choice but to get the Accord Coupe, which started at like $40k ~ $41k CAD, and you lost 2 doors and some interior space (this was in the last 3 years anyway, I don't really know or remember how the Accord was packaged prior to that).  With the 10th gen, you can now get a 6MT 2.0T Accord sedan in the Sport trim, starting at $34.5k (freight/pdi incl.) CAD.  There are good things about the 2.0T with regards to performance as it has more low end torque and it makes the Accord seriously quick for a family sedan with either transmission, but especially when paired with the new 10 speed.

Don't get me wrong, I feel like the 2.0T is not as good as the V6 as far as noise, throttle response, resistance to neglect/abuse and reliability are concerned.  Abuse/neglect will probably be a big issue for the average car owner.  How much will you bet that people will get in their 2.0T on cold winter mornings, start it up and use half ~ full throttle right out of the driveway because they were late for a meeting, or little Jimmy needs to get to soccer practice right away?  Oil change frequency is also a big determining factor in the lifespan of that 2.0T, and you can bet that owners will run the car right up to and past the maintenance minder. 
Oh.... my bad then, maybe he's a Brit living in the US.  The wording of his sentences and spelling of certain words makes me think he's in the UK.
In the UK, you mean?  From the way he was typing, it sounded like he was in the UK - using words like 'bloody', 'tyres', etc.  Iunno.
Be careful, 15000 km is recommended under ideal conditions. Manufacturers also like to throw in qualifiers like "...but if you live anywhere that has snow, or if you drive in the city, blah blah, then reduce intervals between oil changes". I would never run anything more than 7500km. Oil and filters are cheap, engines are not.
I would still warm up the engine as normal (10 min of normal driving) just to be sure, but I get what you mean. The turbo and its turbine shaft doesn't like cold oil, and I actually cringe inside if I'm forced to use any amount of boost in the first half of my morning commute. 
OP is probably in the UK.

They didn't even talk about a manual transmission when they referenced the Type-S... I want a good 6MT as much as anybody else, but I really don't think it'll happen :(
Katakuri is lit.  We're actually seeing a villain grow, and become stronger (not physically, but emotionally) and take the spotlight from Luffy without diminishing the latter.
I love how Saitama is drawn so plainly and poorly as Garou is approaching him from behind, then as his hand touches his shoulder he's suddenly well defined with shading and everything, and the speech bubble is even right over his eyes so we can only guess as to Saitama's expression right before the KO punch.
She did fight and kill an octopus after all...

But really good work, nice and concise, great artwork, good expression on Fubuki's face at the end.
Yeah, that's the most likely scenario.  They talked about the Type-S last appearing on the 2008 Acura TL and referenced a track-tuned chassis, more powerful engine, brake, better tires and cosmetic stuff.  The successor to the TL is the TLX, so I think that a turbo V6 TLX is very likely.
They said it was a purge valve or some shit, a $200 part.
*channels Attenborough*

"A solitary E93 M3 crouches by the lakeside. Haunches up, eyes darting everywhere, it laps at the water. It's wary. There are pRedditors about."
When my turbo went on my Mazdaspeed 3 it was fixed under warranty, but they didn't even test drive the car when I got it back otherwise they would have noticed it idling weirdly and shutting off by itself after 30s. That feeling of being elated that my car was fixed, then being deflated after seeing that they didn't even test it.
That's not the issue here. Something like this can be taken care of under warranty, but no amount of warranty coverage will ever make up for shitty service.
I'm only interested in seeing the differences between stock and the 2 OTS tunes.  The actual numbers and comparison to other motors does not really interest me because I know that all dynos read differently, especially these ones where the wheels are removed.  

If these claims are true, then that was a lot of torque that Honda left on the table.  A few years ago that would have interested me very much - now I'm so much more skeptical of tuner claims that I have to question *why* Honda didn't tune the engine to give more power.  The obvious answer is because they wanted the engine and turbo to be understressed and thus more reliable in the long term, and they probably also wanted to easily meet emissions, fuel economy numbers, and other regulations while leaving in some room for future bumps in power to keep up with the competition.
Also, this might not make much of a difference, but you can at least be sure that the Honda dealership will use OEM oil and OEM oil filters.

I feel dumb - when I try to explain cars and the reason why I love them to people who can't tell the difference between a Hyundai and a Honda and would just as likely buy a Nissan Kumquat because the nice salesperson said it fit their personality. It's not that I'm feeling smart or any nonsense like that, it's more like I can see that they just don't care but they're too polite to tell me directly so they keep nodding their heads as if humoring a kid and his obsession with memes.

Cars are truly fascinating because they're so incredibly complex, and are made in a single day at most factories with such precision that you can have raw materials going in one end and be driving that same car, made with those materials, at the end of the process. They provide transportation, but are so much more than that. 
*But but but....muh lentils and frugality*

This is why car makers tend to ignore what enthusiasts say, because of the sizable portion who want that brown, diesel, manual, AWD wagon used from the factory at $15k. Car making isn't a charity, if people stop buying these enthusiast-oriented cars new, car manufacturers will stop making them altogether. Hell, even if they're bought new they might still stop making them anyway like Mazda and the MS3/MS6.
What baffles the absolute shit out of me is how Nissan has all these weird trims like OP's 'Altima Midnight Edition' with zero power upgrades, 2 tiny cars when 1 would suffice (Micra, Versa), weird ass CUVs that look fast but are slower than molasses (Kicks, Kumquat or Qashqai or whatever), Star Wars inspired Rogue, and the recently-discontinued Juke.  It's like they throw everything on a wall and see what sticks.
Good point.  This is supposed to be a Nissan-Renault alliance, but I feel like Renault got the better deal out of this.
I know, I was just being tongue-in-cheek.
Did they actually try, or was there a technical reason, or something?
I got failed the first time because my car didn't have AC.  The POS beater car I used for my driving test lacked AC (and it had manual windows...), and it was raining so the windows fogged up thanks to the two of us in the car.  I turned on the hot air and shot it at the window on my side, the whole time wondering how the fuck am I supposed to defrost the windows without taking my left hand off the wheel to adjust the vents, putting the left hand back on the wheel, then my right hand to turn the knobs and press the switches.  All this while driving, as a first time driver, nervous as hell during the test.

Bam, failed.  Reason?  Didn't defrost the windows.  Motherfucker, I don't have AC so it takes time to remove the moisture (and I needed to vent the hot moisture-laden air out of the car anyway, so I would have needed to also open the windows using the hand crank).  Also, I can't reach over to the passenger side and adjust the vents that are blowing there.

Lesson learned - if it's anything but a bright sunny day, don't go for your test.

This sub is natural enemies with personalfinance and frugal.  

For myself, I will spend no more than around 50% of gross income, and I buy to own for at least 8 - 10 years or longer.  It depends on the car too.  If I'm looking for basic reliable transportation, I would be buying a used Civic or a Corolla, which is a small percentage of my gross income.  But since I'm looking for something that will put a smile on my face every time I drive it, I'm willing to spend way more.

My reasoning is thus: why should I torture myself everyday by driving a 10 year old Corolla with no power?  Did anybody stop to think that some people hate driving *because* they have only ever experienced unreliable shitboxes up to this point?
*Hey guys I bought a $2 glass baking tray and it exploded in my oven, can I just eat my porkchop raw and reuse the glass shards for something else?*

The Maxima has a 11 year old platform, a CVT (if I'm not wrong), and Renault parts.
I bought a $200~ Fallkniven A1. Why this knife and not some cheapo POS? Because laminated VG-10 steel blade, convex blade edge and Kraton handle plus Japanese quality (made in Japan, designed by Fallkniven). I've seen the reviews on it, I know how tough it is, and if I'm spending money on a camp / survival knife, it's gonna be a damned good one because I'm going to be depending on it to do what I want it to do without it crapping out on me. 
If it was just as reliable as a torque converter and able to handle all sorts of applications including high power, then sure, I'll be happy to accept it over a torque converter.  But I don't think it is.
