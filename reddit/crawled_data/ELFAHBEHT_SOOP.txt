That's a great idea! Thank you :)
Have you adjusted your fancy ergonomic chair yet? It's a thing of beauty. 
You have now been banned from r/Showerthoughts
We have these really nice ergonomic chairs at my work. I have mine set up exactly how I like it. I can't possibly bring myself to sit in someone else's chair. I would hate this guy at work. Although, I put a nametag on the back of my chair, so it's easily identifiable. 
Software Engineers usually tend to be more manager\-y. That's really the only difference I've found.

Don't worry. It's been removed by the mods 👌
Don't forget finding your passion, then realizing how grueling it can be if you make it into a career. How do people make something so awesome, so boring? 
Holy shit lmao

That gave me a good chuckle. 
WOW SPOILER ALERT

I don't think you'd be able to fill that shaft up very quickly.
No bean dipping.

Not for the rule. I agreed with that rule, it's the fact that it had to be a rule in the first place. 

Oh, what is bean dipping? It's a fantastic past time where you would curl your finger into a hook and slide it against someone else's chest in an upward fashion. Making sure to get as much of their glorious bean as possible. 

Many students started getting creative and making variations on the theme. On such variation was called the "Rambo", which involved doing this action repeatedly as fast as possible with both hands. Making sure to maximize speed and accuracy for maximum discomfort.

Boy, do I miss high school.
I had a shirt in high school from cross country that said "Who fartleked?" On the back. In Swedish, fartlek means "Speed Play". It's a type of training where you vary your speed a lot. Cheeky word play, good fun.

Anyway, the principal saw it and told me to never where that shirt to school again. 

He was an idiot, so I did anyway but yeah. Stupid.
Yeah, 20 mile swim and a long trek through frozen woodlands doesn't sound as bad as a swim across an entire ocean.

> However, games for the xbox one x will be incredibly optimized for its hardware so it'll probably get squeeze a lot of good graphics out of what is a much lower powered card than what I have.

Probably not. It's all x86 architecture, so developers really only have to program it once, then find settings that work well for a console and ship it. It's not like back in the day when consoles had a specific architecture that developers had to tailor a game to. 
I'd say.
Is this copypasta?

Yeah tbh

That's what hanging out with friends in college is like, at least for me. 

Ever played Hitman drunk? It's fucking hilarious.
I know right? I thought nothing of it at the time, but wtf was I doing? lol

I guess the movie we were watching ended, and we were all sort of doing our own thing. So I popped in some Portal. Then everyone wanted to know how it ended? Idk. That must have been 6 or 7 years ago at this point. So my memory is fuzzy. 
I was at a party in high school and started and finished the whole game before going home. 

Why did I do this? I have no idea. But the game is short.

Yea 
It was a massive glob on the tiniest price of chip.
The highest I've gone is 357,000 Scoville (Mad Dog 357), and that was pretty bad. I couldn't imagine going this hot.
Dude, this looks like something out of a cliche indie film. I was smiling the whole time.

Congrats!
This is my dream as well.

Right. It's not a magical battery. However, the graphene is used to increase the efficiency of energy transfer. So higher amperage, lower temperatures. That sort of thing.
[These types of batteries](https://hobbyking.com/en_us/graphene-1300mah-4s-65c-w-xt60.html) have been around for about 2 years.
Right, not quite.
Not quite right.
I like to use fine to mean, you know, "fine". Everyone asks me why I'm just fine. 

Okay. It's not a magnificent day and it's not terrible. It's just, fine.
I had a professor that would do something similar to this. They would take examples of stuff that was not good that people submitted and go over it. It felt terrible to have something that was explicitly yours gone over in class. I mean, it helped, but it still felt bad.

Chin up and soldier on. I'm sure you will be fine after knowing what the assignment really is.

My sister's birthday is in Pi day. Never had pie.

Although, I have had pie for my birthday before. Pie is absolutely delicious, so I agree with the switch.

Interesting. This happened a little over a year ago.

I had to drive 6 hours on about ~4ish hours of sleep this weekend. I devolved to pulling over every 30 minutes near the end. Also, just drinking stuff helped. Even if it was just powerade or water.
True. I have to use energy drinks by the afternoon, and a concerning amount at that. Pulling over and walking around a bit is the only thing that will work for me.
Caffeine helps. If you are against caffeine, good luck.

Lol. I know. It was late and I didn't care.
The incorrect comments in the video hurt to see.
Yeah, because that's ridiculous. Plenty of people would refuse to leave Android for iOS, or some younger alternative.
Hey it's actually you.

Also, I've actually learned most stuff I know about blender from you :) So thank you!
This site started going downhill the instant they added comments.
I'm sure every time they end that show, they also consider the perfect way to bring it back.

Yes, there are a bunch of different algorithms that are capable of finding a solution. 

Usually, in video games you will see A* (pronounced: A star) being used. This algorithm will find the most optimal solution the fastest. Usually you will use this algorithm if you need a solution somewhat quickly, that is the most efficient solution possible.

Another option would be a Greedy Best First search algorithm. This is used if you don't care about the solution, but you want a solution quickly. The only thing this algorithm cares about is if the next position will be closer to the finish than the current position. This will give you weird winding solutions at the end, but a computer will shred through mazes extremely quickly.
It's from Office Space.
🤔 got a source on that?

Not exactly. If it ran over your head maybe, but it could split you in half and you'd know.

Wow, that's some high quality H2O.
Oh, absolutely not. 
Right, but the first stage is about 40 meters long. They would need a special trailer to carry it, while being very careful. That would be like carrying a bit more than a windmill blade, if you've seen that done before.

Edit: You guys need to calm down. My comment was hardly dissenting. There's no room in this sub for any real discussion it seems.
Even if they didn't, it would be easy to solve. Once you have the state of a cube, it's a really easy problem to solve with a computer. So, because they are already detecting colors, they could probably implement the solving algorithm in about a day or less.
Right. And I don't know why you'd need to charge super quickly at your house. You'll be there for a while most likely. Stopping at a service station? That should be fast, in the matter of minutes.
I have those. They're beautiful. I actually have the 2200 mAh ones.

That is basically the movie Nerve.
That's why cops usually don't give each other tickets. It can start stuff like this.

You're using this meme incorrectly. It should be:

"Then I told them"

"I would have run in without a weapon"

Something like that. It's not just a bunch of people laughing, it's rich people laughing at fucking over the little guys and treating them like shit. 
Yeah, but these people are old af.
Right. We are in agreement.

Good point as well. I agree. 
True, but maybe that information would never exist that the other team needs? Two different teams will find two different ways to solve the problem. These techniques could inspire each other to achieve what the other person is doing.

Think about Amazon and Netflix. Amazon would never have streaming services if Netflix didn't exist. It's because of Netflix's existence that Amazon decided to also go into that. 

Competition is good, it breeds innovation. Plus, we can't stuff everyone into the same company.
No, the competition with each other will push each other more than working together ever will.

Basically, instructions that the game are telling the machine to do, and information about the currently running game, are stored in memory. The machine is basically reading the instructions like an instruction book from memory. First do step 1, then step 2 and so on. 

However, there's a glitch where you can change where the machine is reading instructions from. It just so happens that this place it moves to is storing information based upon what the player has done. So, the player can manipulate the data in  that area in just the right way to make it look like instructions that say "hey, the player won". So, the machine starts reading instructions from that area in memory, and it shows the game end screen.

Usually, if you didn't set up the data in this area before you did the glitch, it would probably just crash the game.
Yeah, I think I am thinking of those courses. I guess CS usually takes Calc I II and III, with linear algebra. 

The "CS lite" degrees still get hired as SE. Which is bullshit. Might as well call myself Professor from now on if we're just slinging titles around. 
CS doesn't require high level math and science and they all get hired as Software Engineers anyway. Pretty annoying tbh.
And getting bullets from the bullet farm!
The math that goes into making a 3D projection (like for video games) relies on where the camera is. So this effect will be ruined by moving, even if it's only slightly different.

A problem with this is that we would have to log alllll of the posts on the subreddit, and do our own search on them. Reddit's search functionality is useless for finding similar content if there is content that matches exactly. So you can't just throw a post in and find very similar results. You have to use it by picking out keywords and searching those. You might be able to get away with using Google pointed at reddit as well. 

Take this post for example. [Jenga is the opposite of Tetris](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/7xjmgh/jenga_is_the_opposite_of_tetris/). Obvious repost. Let's search for it. [Four results](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/search?q=Jenga+is+the+opposite+of+Tetris.&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all). Okay. Let's break it into the key parts of the thought. "Jenga opposite Tetris" [six results](https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/search?q=Jenga+opposite+Tetris.&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all). So we can easily miss posts by simple searching. [Google returns a bunch of extraneous stuff](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Areddit.com+Jenga+is+the+opposite+of+Tetris.).

However, if we could implement our own fuzzy matching algorithm, we could do some really cool stuff with that. I am aware of behind-the-scenes work going on in image-based subreddits to cut down on reposts. These bots use fuzzy matching algorithms as well. However, in order to do that, we need all of the data. 

So, we (the mods of reddit) are trying. It's just a ridiculously hard problem to solve from the outside.
It won't be as bad. Maybe an initial rush, but the autism was truly released when people didn't get what they wanted. If this is a mass release, they'll be sure to meet demand.
Will the flair backend work like normal? 

For example, will it break PRAW? 
That would be extremely helpful, thank you. I'll add this site to the automod in a little bit. 

Thank you!
We can do that actually. If you could send the list of spam sites to the moderators, that would be really helpful. I'll try to circulate it around to moderators of other subreddits as well.

We also can't ban by IP sadly. We don't have that much control.

It sounds wonderful.
Hey, I've been having a hard time lately, and I appreciate this comment a lot. Thank you for some perspective. 
I don't think servos are a thing in stock KSP.
I'd say it's more of a control system than a robot. I wouldn't call SpaceX rockets robots, for example. 

The plane itself is more robot than the rocket, but whatever.
I think this is probably scripted. That being said...

The only thing I have any authority to talk about related to this is mesh networking. If they take hints from mesh networks, it is "decentralized". Where networks will operate by themselves, but there is a central coordinator node that makes high level decisions. Like telling how to route messages, managing security concerns. Stuff like that.

So a pack would probably have an "Alpha" that makes a plan as long as it's not too intensive on the robot's hardware. You actually see this master/slave architecture a lot in hardware because it's very convenient.  

Although, thinking about it more, not every message in a mesh needs to pass through the coordinator. So, if you extended this analogy to packs of robo-dogs, there could be smaller packs that make up easy plans by themselves, and they send the request higher up if it's too hard. 
Report it with the exact twitter link and it will be removed. Almost guaranteed.

Word of advice: take a deep breath and calm down. The fear of rejection is strong, but the 'what-ifs' are much stronger years down the line. If she says no, then oh well. There's no big effect on your life. If she says yes, that's everything. I hope you get everything! Good luck!
They aren't *that* smart. They just follow this sort of thing more closely.

What did the comment say?
With Jurassic Park in 1993, it almost looks like a new revolution of how films are made comes around every 30 years or so. Some movie just does everything so much differently and better that it changes the playing field forever.
Or just burn out for a while.
Maybe just a gun where you shoot them with a dotted line to where they died. The death location would always be under the gun picture, so it wouldn't show up unless it was a snipe worth showing.

And a company that only exists because NASA awarded them a contract years ago.
Possibly, one theory is that it was just dead weight for Twitter, other theories are related to not being able to compete in the space against Instagram and YouTube. It had a gimmick that really limited how it could grow. 
Well, it doesn't exist anymore because it was failing to make enough money. That sounds like a failure to me.

I'm not the automotive student (actually an SE student). But those look like 1/4-20 threaded rods. You could bend those with your hands. If you try to apply any force to those, the rods will probably bend, pulling in the sides, and ultimately rip the whole thing off. The parts on the sides don't even look structurally sound, it's all quite shoddy and terrifying. 
Is that JuiceSSH, or are you actually mining off of your phone?
You can also read the [Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). It's not a heavy read at all, and it really provides some great insight into how cryptocurrency works.
Yeah, probably tbh.
Honestly, it's like the perfect anti-anxiety medicine. It's so relaxing, I could just melt.
It looks like the crash occurred here: https://goo.gl/maps/zfqK7h1X8vK2

That would be a terrible place to pass on the inside because the black car is going to try cutting that turn as tightly as possible. Either way, it's still a split fault because both cars should be aware of what's happening at all times.

When they came in and built the grid again, basically all of it had to be rebuilt. Also, Puerto Rico isn't flat, so pulling the old transmission lines down and putting new ones up takes a while. I remember someone from the Corps of Engineering talking about it.

No. Terminal velocity is caused by drag forces pushing against you balancing the force of gravity. If you're in an elevator, you won't experience drag forces, but the elevator would. There would be a 'zero gravity' feeling until the elevator hit terminal velocity (kind of, more G the closer it gets to terminal velocity). Then the velocity of the elevator would be constant, and it'd feel like 1 g again.

Good news for you. The company behind Farberware, and other brands are getting into the IoT market. They're using Amazon's backend to do it as well. So, your dream may be closer than you think.
I actually gave a speech on 'How to count' in my public speaking class at university. Apparently it's a hard concept to grasp. 

The last slide I started counting in base 3 with webdings. I think that really threw them for a loop.
What I don't understand is how someone can be so lax about testing something like this. Before I do stuff at work I read everything and make sure everything is ready about 10 times. How can you just blow through these confirmations? 
They can, but they also have a spot where you can list a whole bunch of stuff about you, and there are more individual questions to answer when you sign up.
My cruise control is broken, so now I just go faster than most people. Seems to solve the problem.

I guess I did that before, but it helps in this case.
Thanks bb
I'll be with you 5 ever. 😘
Maybe when they test their notification system. They should put in a message that wouldn't be misconstrued as an actual warning. 

Just a thought. 
It looks fake to me, but I've certainly met people with fabulous facial hair like that, so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
It ceases to exist.
There's probably a sneaky way to change the batteries. It looks like it's in one of those drawers. Maybe it opens?
At this point we've split Black into two camps. Dark and Light. White has already been said to be Light Black. So White can't also be a subset of Dark Black. This is because Dark Black implies the lower range of Black. So Dark and Light Black are split at the midpoint between Black and White. This means that "extra light dark black" just means that boarder upon which Black has been split. So the color smack in the middle of White and Black.
I'm gonna have to look into that. I'm not sure what it'll do on a 960, but I guess we'll see.
You make $300 on a single GPU?
Light dark black is dark white at best.
I'm sure she asked her students to wear dark black socks from then on.
That is very fascinating. Thanks for sharing.
The problem might be that H&M is actually a largely white company, so this racial slur might not have been at the forefront of their minds while looking at these pictures. Plus, these models take a LOT of pictures. One picture slipping through the cracks isn't that unreasonable.
That's about 4 times the diameter of Jupiter. Building this would be like adding a new massive planet to our solar system.
In the link for the tutorial, it says it takes about 5 minutes. That's also doing a bunch of extraneous stuff to make the process easier. I think if you made a system with C++ from the ground up you could easily half that time if you're smart about it.
Is this copy pasta?
I'm going to have to try that out...
Yeah, I have both. I prefer the Google Home because it just feels a lot smarter. 

I just wish there was just an easier way to go behind the scenes like you can with Alexa.
I've heard it that some people buy domestic cars to help with the domestic economy. And before you say that foreign car manufacturers have factories in the US, they say that the money ultimately goes to a foreign entity to pay for foreign engineers and other stuff. 
My Google Home has been terrible for this. When it goes off, I can just say "Ok Google, Stop". And it stops. It also takes forever to set alarms on it, so I only have 2... I should just use my phone.
Not really. It has to be stable to be a good currency. If it randomly spikes all over the place, it's not good at storing value. At this point, it's an investment opportunity and it's probably going to have to crash hard multiple times for people to stop trying to invest with it. 
Well geeze. That makes a ton more sense.
This is such a strangely accurate statement. I don't even know what a new post office would look like.
Well I just applied to U Wisconsin grad school too. So if I get it I'll be sure to look for the guy wearing the  purple UW gear.

Software developers are needed for the world to work as it currently does. Is it feeding the poor? Not exactly, but pretty much every facet of modern human life needs software in some capacity or another. While we might not be farmers, I'd say we are still needed. 
Sounds like something that would be in a Simon Pegg movie. 

I'd totally watch it.
I guess I'm making my list now lol

1. Become better at English. I'm a senior in college, but I've realized I'm not that good at writing. My vocabulary isn't the best either. I'm also taking a class next semester to help with that.

2. Stop depending on caffeine so much. My life is largely driven by chemicals and it's really not healthy.

3. Become more organized. I've done okay in this aspect over the years, but I still procrastinate a lot. I need to stop doing that.

4. Finally build my racing quadcopter. I've had it designed for a long time. It's just about saving up money to buy all of the parts.
Hey, sorry to tell you this but you're supposed to finish assignments at 5:00 am the day they're due.
According to Wikipedia:

>The 747's maximum takeoff weight ranges from 735,000 pounds (333,400 kg) for the -100 to 970,000 lb (439,985 kg)

The Falcon Heavy mass: 

>  	1,420,788 kg (3,132,301 lb)

I'll use the lower end for 747 weight, I'm assuming that's with no cargo. 

18 * 333,400 kg = 6,001,200 kg

So about 24%
Blood isn't that expensive. However, the drones are pretty valuable.
Would the plane pictured in the article even make that flight in reasonable time? You'd need something really fast to get there in a reasonable amount of time.

Yeah, I was wondering if there was an endpoint I wasn't seeing. I had designed the database with "userid" as the primary key for users. Then I realized it should probably be username. 

This question was mostly out of curiosity than really needing it. It also seems more robust to use a full name rather than a username if it was possible.

Also, thanks for the recommendation. I'll check it out.

I first started with dogecoin a couple months after it started. The first transaction is in May of 2014. I bought a knife with it, then held the rest. The knife sits in my glove box.

What do you think *unique monthly users* means? 
How else would you calculate it? I can't access the traffic page for the Donald, so that's the best your going to get.

So those light up suits they are wearing. Are those custom made, and how do you get into making those? Because that looks like it'd be really cool to custom make software/hardware solutions for those. If anyone has any experience with that, I'd love to know.

Why do we build a base anywhere? 

Mine for resources, research. It can be a starting point for larger missions. 

There are many reasons to build a base. Maybe many won't pay off for years, but it's good to invest in our future.
Maybe not with wings. That sort of requires an atmosphere. 
No, it's already here. We just have to build a sun base. 

Easy peasy. 
I happen to know an autodidact polymath that might be of assistance.

What I wouldn't give to meme one last time.
I have done a couple small plays in my youth. When you're on stage, the lights that light the stage pretty much obscure all of the audience because they are in darkness. You're essentially playing to a void that reacts with laughter and applause.
Very true. I feel like it made me a more empathetic person as well. There have been multiple occasions where I have included other people so they wouldn't feel like I have before. There was even an instance where I went to go put into action a plan to bully a kid that other assholes hatched. I went up to him, and just didn't do it. I had a nice convo instead. They all laughed at me, but I'd rather people laugh at me that be the type of person that has hurt me before. I can't do that stuff knowing how it feels... I mean me too thanks.
Except if it's a boring intro like Iron Fist.

However, HBO has fantastic intros. I always watch those. Game of Thrones, Westworld, Silicon Valley. All great. Although, if you skip Silicon Valley's intro, you have problems.

Um. No.

Nothing conclusive here as he is clearly joking. If you want to stir shit, it might be an okay thing to do it with until everyone is convinced there's nothing conclusive.
No, that's just part of the joke. They're joking about the absurdity of having this plan in action since 2003 and recently made a sketch about it.

This first episode is up btw.

Fantastic! Now I actually want to see it.

Also, the only real nitpick I have with it is the jarring cut at 1:44 from the BOOMBOOMBOOM music, to the shrilly music. One easy way to fix this imo would be to start the music right on the cut or right before the cut, mixed with the other music.

Either way, it's still 10,000 times better than the original one.

This is almost a Decision Analysis and Resolution (DAR Model). 

Basically, you just list different criteria that you are looking for. Let's say you're buying a car. So different criteria are reliability, cost, efficiency, and color. The amount each of these criteria matter to you are then scaled. So 5, 4, 3, 1, for example. These will be your coefficients. Then, you rank different cars based on these criteria and multiply the coefficients of each criteria to the ranking for that criteria. In the end, you'll get a total point value for every car and the choice you should go with is the car with the highest point value.
Hello I'm a future historian. How are you?
Oats Studio is more about the challenge I think. While they could do it with live-action, it's the challenge of doing it in a real-time graphics engine that is truly engaging.

Donkey Kong is a video game character developed by Nintendo, a Japanese company. 
And being able to get in, usually means you want to get in. Some people are content with not going to college, or the line of work they want to get into means they don't have to go to college. Same with people going to grad school in the US. If grad school was free and college was free, I don't think many more students will be going to grad school, as going to grad school isn't a step in an average student's goals.

Not completely on my end. They've still got one.
YES. After recently playing through DOOM 2016 for the first time, I'm firmly onboard with that idea.

They really do seem to just love making games, and the newest DOOM really feels like a love letter to the original DOOM. If they gave Star Wars the same treatment, that would be a really good game.
The editing process, seems to be where the true magic is. The description of the video explains it in depth:

> Traditional time-lapses are constrained by the idea that there is a single universal clock. In the spirit of Einstein's relativity theory, layer-lapses assign distinct clocks to any number of objects or regions in a scene. Each of these clocks may start at any point in time, and tick at any rate. The result is a visual time dilation effect known as layer-lapse.
>
>After releasing "Boston Layer-Lapse" a few years ago, I was able to quit my engineering job to focus on time-lapse and film making. New York City was the obvious subject for my next film, the immense skyline was ideal. However I was facing an unknown creative challenge: when I created Boston Layer-Lapse I manually animated layers because I only had about 30 layers in a scene, in New York I was making layer-lapses with 100-300 layers so I needed some method to help me automate my workflow. Luckily I have an engineering background I can lean on, so in early 2016 I started learning scripting in after effects, and began writing code to create different layer-lapse 'looks'. To create a layer-lapse effect, I am assigning a unique equation to hundreds of buildings simultaneously. For each frame, every building is calculating and deciding which time of day to reveal. One example of a script that yields a ‘look’ are the waves of day or night that move through some of the shots in this film. To achieve the ‘look’ I can set parameters like the speed at which the wave moves across the screen, how rapidly each layer will switch from day to night or vice versa, and I'll often use a random sinusoidal function to create a subtle oscillation inside the wave itself. Now I've probably lost half my audience but for those of you still reading, the final step is linking an action or a script to a piece of the music. One way I've found this can be done is creating a set of audio triggers for a song, so that every note or beat triggers a change. By linking a certain script to each of these triggers one can create computer generated layer-lapses that are animated in response to music. Admittedly, this film is still a combination of mathematical and manual animation but my goal is to create a layer-lapse film where all the animations are simply decisions made by each layer after analyzing the music and the script it was assigned. By making layer-lapses run on mathematics, there are also some really cool avenues to create interactive physical or virtual art installations where a person could actually touch and manipulate a layer-lapse scene in real time. The further down the rabbit hole of layer-lapses I go, the more opportunities for experimentation I am discovering. I love the process of creative exploration and hopefully my audience gets something from it too, thanks for watching!

You pretty much hit the nail on the head.

First, you ask them if you can touch them. If you can't, you just ask them if their head hurts, then their neck.. all the way to their feet. If you can touch them, you can move their limbs for them and ask if it hurts. Usually when you see "oh no! bleeding arm", you might just focus on the arm. However, there could be secondary injuries that you need to have the victim bring their attention to.
I'm in the process of getting first aid certified and they teach us how to do this too. Just wanted to point that out I guess.
That's another good point, and I would have to agree. I guess I just got used to them that they seem like they're just there. We've got a long fight ahead to get rid of all this stuff.
Nah, pick a weekend to watch all of them. Then go into existential crisis mode. That's the only way to watch it. 
True, I feel like this is why GoT is huge, while these other streaming shows aren't. You get to speculate with your friends over what the next episode might bring. However, with streaming shows, you just watch the whole thing. The mystery of what happens next isn't there.
Good points. The true problem is "pay-to-win". Loot boxes that only contain cosmetics will continue to be fine, because they have no real in-game value. They are also not tied directly to the progression system in the game. When microtransactions are paired with loot-boxes that provide progression in a game, then it becomes gambling.

Although, does the general public make that distinction? That's what IP owners like Disney have to decide. If they decide that "microtransactions" is synonymous with "gambling" to the general public, then they will certainly be pulled from kid friendly IP, and maybe even more beyond that.

Person of the Year doesn't mean the person with the largest positive impact. It means the person that was most influential over the course of the year. Considering he is the one person that I've heard most about this year, I'd say he definitely qualifies.
I also didn't see anything concerning the effect it had in spiders. They also plan on doing it to other animals. So either the spiders were fine, or they don't care. We'll probably know more once they do it to other animals.

Okay, cool beans. It looked like they needed to switch everything on one day, but I guess they were just trying to get their spots back.
Why does it seem like they come through on one side, then come through on the other in the same day? Why not just let people double park one day, forget about it, move it back to normal parking for a day or two, then double park on the other side for a day. Seems a lot less crazy than everyone trying to move back to the other side at the same time.

I just want to say that I love your username.

I mean me too thanks.
Thanks for the input /u/AcexSwordzman.

We are trying to crack down on reposting in a big way, and are throwing around ideas to try getting on top of it even more. This includes harsher punishment for people that repost content. We also have a lot of different tools to help us track reposts. An almost 100% sure way to get a repost removed very quickly is to report the post and link to the original post. Half the battle is verifying a post is a repost, if you provide the link that makes it a lot faster for us to verify and take action.

Thanks again for the feedback.
True. 

This is part of the reason why we need a multifaceted approach which includes reporting memes as normie. Also, u/keepdankmemesdank helps a lot for memes that haven't blown up quite yet.

Thanks for the feedback!

Technically speaking, the only thing being submitted to Reddit is the link to the "user content". Can it be argued (effectively) that reddit owns the rights to only link the content and not the content itself due to the fact that the only thing "submitted" to Reddit is a link, not content.
So you'd still rate the chicken very high?

But, as he mentioned, we mostly move through time so we experience the bending in space the most in the form of gravity. We can only move through space-time at a certain velocity.

You can. If you're on desktop, hit the little "save" button underneath any comment or post you want to save for later.
This trick also works well for searching an issue you are having on a certain things forum. It'll help you get to those less popular threads that has your answer just laying there.

PSA: if you find someone that is exhibiting signs of hypothermia, warm them slowly. Don't put them next to a heat source because you could accidentally warm them too quickly. Just give them layers upon layers to heat up.  
It's not a free speech thing. It's just an ethical boundary that should be woven into the journalist community. A boundary that is technically legal to cross, but is also frowned upon by the rest of the community. Sort of like doxxing a person. I'm pretty sure that's legal, but it's very frowned upon.

It's pretty easy. 

Just grab one of the arms such that it is sticking out of the top of your fist, and the point is pointing backwards. Then, make sure to throw it at about a 20 degrees. Do that a couple times and adjust how hard you throw it and the angle until it comes right back to you.
I'll have to agree on the Max and Billy point. It does seem kind of weird, but I'm sure there's a reason. They seemed to be alluding to a reason that they are stuck there. I'm hoping it isn't just because their Dad lives there and it connects into a bigger narrative.

Verizon used to offer unlimited quite a few years ago. Then they took away the ability to sign up for it, but people that still had it were "grandfathered in" and they got to keep it. So, if they had kept their unlimited data from the first time Verizon offered it, they would not be throttled because throttling was not in the contract they signed up for.

>Since the Clinton administration, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had regulated the broadband industry with a light touch, allowing the Internet to flourish. Unfortunately, the Obama administration’s decision to reclassify broadband service under Title II — its misnamed “Open Internet Order” — broke with bipartisan tradition. This reclassification imposed heavy-handed utility-style regulations on internet services and led to greater government control of the Internet.  
>
>This heavy-handed regulation has caused investment in Internet infrastructure to decline.  According to the FCC, among the nation’s 12 largest internet service providers, domestic broadband capital expenditures decreased by 5.6 percent, or $3.6 billion, between 2014 and 2016. As the new chairman of the FCC recently explained, “regulations designed for monopoly will push the market further toward monopoly.” This is not what is best for citizens of Wisconsin or the rest of the country.  
>
>One of my top priorities is to ensure the expansion of high-speed broadband throughout Wisconsin. On May 18, 2017, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for broadband services that was a welcome development. This action restores the light-touch regulation that allowed for a free and open Internet for nearly 20 years.

Honestly, walking is freaking amazing. Especially if you can just do it as part of your normal schedule. If you also constrict your diet a bit, you can easily loose quite a bit of weight.

>frame rate of a camera dictates how much motion blur there *can* be in a video.

If you have a super fast frame rate, your shutter speed also has to be super fast. If you have a lower frame rate, you can have a slower shutter speed as well. I was just lazy and didn't want to get into specifics. 
Yeah, but the frame rate of a camera dictates how much motion blur there can be in a video. So to show faster refresh rate having less blur makes sense. Is it 100% correct? No, but it gets the message across.

I know. But without writing up a wall of text it would have been hard to go over all of the stipulations. Are people that conceal carry 100% trustworthy? Absolutely not. But to have more than one person being an absolute idiot with a gun in a crowd is something I can't easily bring myself to believe. In the culture of gun owners, safety is paramount. Most of the people that have guns have probably also taken a hunter safety or gun safety course before. After which, you would know why would should not do what you described.

I know this just sounds like assumption after assumption, but the situation you described is not that believable and also uses assumption after assumption.
Anybody that is a responsible gun owner wouldn't start shooting across a crowd of people towards a target that they aren't certain of. To have multiple people shooting across a crowd toward someone shooting at an unknown target is even more ridiculous. The psychopaths shooting up crowds are the people to worry about.

I like the occasional stop-motion film. I loved Kubo. That being said, the style on this looks a bit rubbish when paired with what seems to be a relatively serious theme. Taking itself seriously and looking cheap at the same time creates a dissonance that feels uncomfortable. Maybe it's supposed to make me feel uncomfortable, but I really don't like it. I could also be reading the theme of the movie incorrectly.

From the description of the video:

>Watch the documentation of an Arab trying to beat an adult after driving wildly on the road.
From News 2:
These pictures, taken on the Kabri-Ahihud road in the north about a year ago, reveal another case of violence on Israel's roads. Amir Shehadeh, a 20-year-old from Kfar Yassif, was documented on the cell phone camera of police volunteer Rami Russo, driving wildly on one of the main roads in the north of the country.
>
>Shehadeh was recorded twice on Rousseau's cell phone camera while ignoring a white line and driving wildly at the risk of his life and the life of the other drivers on the road. When the two arrived at the traffic light, Rousseau photographed the offending driver. "As part of my volunteer work, I came to the conclusion that there is a parallel between people who behave wildly on the road and criminals from other fields," said Russo, and knew what he was talking about.
>
>At the first opportunity, Shehadeh stopped his vehicle in the middle of the road and Russo tried to steal the camera in his hand. Later he returned to his car and took out an iron loom to show Rousseau "who is boss on the road." But to Rousseau's great luck, he took out his gun and changed the balance of power.
>
>"Imagine a person with a 3-kilo rod landing on you. If I did not have the weapon at the time, I do not know what situation I would end up with, I could be Arik Karp II today," said Rousseau, who was praised by a commander Northern District Police.
The District Court was satisfied with service work for the young attacker, but now he was severely punished and sent him to one year in prison.

The description says that Amir Shedhadeh (the attacker) is from the town of [Kfar Yassif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafr_Yasif), which is an Arab town in the north of Israel. Which would technically make him Israeli Arabic. I'm not sure what race relations are like in Israel, but it could possibly be that this is pointed out due to some racial thing.

The estimated volume of the grand canyon is about [4.17 trillion cubic meters](https://www.nps.gov/grca/learn/management/statistics.htm).

A billion paper bills takes up [about 1250 cubic meters](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-cubic-volume-of-1-billion-dollars-US-currency-assuming-individual-dollar-bills).

Having these two numbers we can split half of the grand canyon into billion *dollar bill* chunks. 

2085000000000 / 1250 = 1,668,000,000 chunks

1,668,000,000 chunks * (1,000,000,000 bills * 100 dollars) = 166,800,000,000,000,000,000 USD. 

OR

166.8 quintillion USD

To put that in perspective, the net worth of humanity [is about $241 trillion](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-combined-wealth-of-everyone-in-the-entire-world-2016-9)

Fine, [look at this](http://www.people-press.org/interactives/political-polarization-1994-2015/) and say that more radical fringe beliefs aren't occurring. It's like you took my description of the study, then based your response on it without reading the study.  
It is happening though, and if you don't see it, you've been living under a rock. 

Here's a study from the Pew Research Center where they show that there is an increasing political divide in America with less people holding positions in the center every year. This leads to more shit-flinging fights between both ideologies than normal. Which is exactly what this post is about.

I completely missed a final. I thought it was on Friday when it was on Monday or something. I was talking to a partner on a project about it and he was in the same class. That's when I realized I completely fucked up. I don't even know how the fuck that happened. 

I talked to the professor, he let me use the notes I had prepared for it, and gave me full credit. He also had it graded within an hour. I love that professor. 
They're predicting the progress of computers, not social progression. Also, if they got that right, they'd probably scare a lot of people.
They said in the trailer that their bodies would be 0.0634% of their current size. Which translate to good ol' Matt being about 4.4 inches tall. 

Also, for their cash. They start with only 0.416% of the cash they end with. Which seems like the cash has a bigger multiplicative factor than how small they shrink down to. It's just more economical to make small things, apparently.

That doesn't prove one way or another that this was intentional. He gets a lot of exposure, but what to apply it to now? If he wants to capture this exposure, he'd send traffic somewhere that is easy for him to capture it. Like an actual YouTube channel for his band, not his personal channel. He'd also look into getting the band back together to build anticipation, and not say that it's probably not going to happen. There's a lot of variables that don't add up. Just because someone on Reddit stumbles into the limelight, doesn't mean they were try to get there. It's a big coincidence, but until more evidence presents itself, that's all I'm willing to call it.
If they want to promote something, they aren't doing a very good job at all. Posted to a YouTube channel that seems to be an old, personal one. Without ads. It doesn't link to any external sites. The band member said they probably weren't getting back together. 

I don't see the angle they'd be playing to be honest.

>
>n. 1) the criminal act of entering a residence or other enclosed property through the slightest amount of force (even pushing open a door), without authorization. If there is intent to commit a crime, this is burglary. If there is no such intent, the breaking and entering alone is probably at least illegal trespass, which is a misdemeanor crime. 2) the criminal charge for the above.

Okay, lets break this down. 

Bill Nye is an entertainer/educator, that calls himself "Bill Nye The Science Guy" because of an educational show. Something an HVAC engineer could to just the same. 

That system used on the "Mars Rover" is called a [MarsDial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MarsDial) which is essentially just a glorified sundial for calibration of systems on-board any mars rover. The [Planetary Society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Planetary_Society) is an educational venture which was founded by Carl Sagan (among others). Which does fantastic work, but it's still a public education program, it doesn't "do science". Also, he's the CEO, not the Vice President. 

While these achievements shouldn't be taken lightly, it doesn't mean Bill is a scientist or that it takes many qualifications at all to become a "science guy". That's because "science guy" doesn't mean anything. It was a title given to an comedian/educator by a couple producers in the 90's.
I go to them very rarely. Most of what I eat is cooked because it's a lot cheaper.

Don't worry about me.

It sort of is antimemes, but there's an added layer. An antimeme has basically one good way that it can go. Removing any punchline. Bonehurtingjuice can still have a punchline, but it has to completely miss the point of the original meme. Basically, if 14 yo kids dictated how all memes are now used, you'd get bonehurtingjuice.

Well, that was super disjointed.

Yes
I'm approaching this with cautious optimism. 

Also, Mr. Robot gets really boring sometimes, so I don't blame you at all. Sometimes going on 3 episodes with some weird mind trip stuff. 
Here's a bit of a source for you:

>If the next season's release follows last year’s example, fans can expect season four to arrive sometime in October.

http://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/745219/black-mirror-netflix-season-4-release-date-cast-latest-news-rumours

Which only adds onto how awesome October is going to be for series releases. So far, Mr. Robot on Oct 11, and Stranger Things on Oct 27. If all goes to plan, October will be the month of the mind-fuck.
Damn right, that was the type of software I was talking about. Not apps or whatever. 
Safety critical software I'm guessing?
To be honest, I haven't worked on any medical stuff yet. People always come in and try to add medical to my list when I'm talking about Aeronautical/Vehicular stuff. So I thought I'd try adding it. I thought this was true for any safety critical medical hardware, but again, I haven't worked with it before.
That's because if those things fail, they can kill you. It gets a lot more stringent when working with software that can kill you. Things like Aeronautical, Vehicular, and Medical software need to be tested extremely thoroughly. There isn't a cheaper option. I actually do this at my job, so ask any questions about it if you have any. I might be able to answer them. 
Arnold wasn't born in the US, so that's sadly not possible. Terry Crews is possible though, and that'd probably look something like this http://i.imgur.com/Cad06H3.jpg

True. It's almost entirely a dev issue once Sony gives the green light. The Rocket League developers said it's basically just a click of a button and cross play would go live instantly.

> “It’s literally something we could do with a push of a button, metaphorically,” Dunham told Polygon. “In reality it’s a web page with a checkbox on it. All we have to do is check that box and it would be up and running in less than an hour all over the world. That’s all we need to do.”

I don't see why that's any cause for alarm.
I wonder how that guy's inbox is doing. 

Hey /u/WaterGuy12, how's your inbox?
I listened to his podcast a couple years ago and they had this segment where someone would call in and ask about something scientific. Then either him or Bill Nye would try to answer it. Every time it felt like they were just pulling something that sounded vaguely correct out of their ass. Pretty disappointing.

I completely agree. 
He's worried about escalation, which is exactly what's happening. Escalation will lead to more deaths and more of a reason to fight. This will just fan the flames even more and lead to more deaths and more escalation. One side or the other has to make an active decision to put an end to the violence so the situation doesn't get out of hand.
well actually, they have a point. Free speech, amirite?

*Seriously tho*. Free speech, sure. But they certainly don't have an good points.

That's my birthday, so I'm not missing totality on that one.
I'd prefer if they did it a bit less violently. It's still a part of history, and if we could take them down without breaking them, that would be the best course of action. Although, what's to say the city won't just put them back up?
But if they go in there, and *say* that they're guilty, why would they go to trial and try to prove that they aren't? Isn't the entire point of this exercise to "stick it to the man"? Or can they not go to trial and confess? 
Yeah, but that's kind of the point. They are a chaotic evil that is playing against a lawful good. We are bound by definition to always try to prevent these attacks from occurring again. At what cost? I'm not sure. There is a cost, but not doing it is risking human lives. They will adapt, but does that mean we shouldn't prevent these attacks when possible? It's a very hard question to answer, and to answer it you'd have to put a price on human lives. 
Up until the start of this summer I hadn't watched the show. I've mostly avoided anything GoT related because one day I was going to watch it. So I said enough is enough and I watched it all. It feels good to be in the know now.

I actually found something. 

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/geoengineering/EGWCs6bE1j8

Somebody made a detailed outline of the episode! So it turns out that it actually was more successful than I first remembered. In the end, essentially nothing got planted. However, the delivery system sort of worked. Apparently the seeds *were* planted. However, they were flying full scale helicopters in this test, drones are a different story for how big the canisters can be. They were also trying to make sure that the canisters landed in a good pattern that would be conducive to actually growing a forest. So, I'd say there is promise, but it will take a bit of work still.
Not really. It was a while ago so I don't remember the specifics. They were also trying to drop it into some pretty soft soil, so that didn't bode well for actual hard soil. I don't think any of the seeds actually got planted. I tried finding the segment, but I couldn't sadly.
I feel like it's still about those things.

- drones have payload capacity limitations
    - requires new tech to increase payload/flight times. Need to be baby sat.
- ground can be very hard
    - requires new planter things to be designed so seeds can be planted via dropping.
- drones need to be loaded frequently
    - requires babysitting, or new tech that loads the drone automatically.
- it's difficult to drop and plant and ensure germination + growing past the first few stages such as first real leaves
    - requires new tech/baby sitting. The car might have this problem too, but you could check on them easier with the car possibly.

I actually like this idea a lot better. It is basically completely autonomous. Minimal babysitting if it's programmed right, and it doesn't require any tech that doesn't already exist.
Discovery had a series called Project Earth about 10 years ago. The purposed much the same thing, and the little seed planter things they dropped from an airplane just plopped onto the surface and didn't get "planted".

Some onion haters are stronger than others. I like to think I would have that same strength if this happened to me. 
If it changes anything, I somewhat agree. 

The customer isn't always right, but neither is the employee. If this was the first offense, we would talk about it with the entire team and tell them what to do in a situation like this. 

People can be moulded, and as a manager it's their job to mold sub-par employees into better employees and to spread the knowledge of the best employees to the other employees. After an incident like this, that employee would know to just walk away and come get the manager to deal with the situation.

I've had to study this on two separate occasions in college. 

It's ridiculous and only for philosophers to squabble with, because if we ever do reach general AI, they'll still maintain it's not conscious. Just look up the chinese room experiment, and the counters, and the counters to the counters. The counters to the counters are so ridiculously stupid, you just know the person arguing it doesn't understand or is afraid of admitting that we're basically just advanced robots.  
True. I completely agree with your second point, so I'll just focus on the first point. 

I haven't actually read very deeply into the implementation of the GO AI, maybe it calculated ahead a little bit, but that wouldn't be a pure neural AI. Essentially, every "neuron" is a mathematical function that takes all of the values the input nodes are outputting, then it outputs it's own value to the next neuron. This neuron may also take inputs from a bunch of other neurons, which then outputs its own values and so on. During training, when an output of a neuron is perceived as "incorrect", the training algorithm changes the mathematical function slightly in reaction to whatever happened. This changing of the mathematical function is super complex and I don't even understand it to a fair enough degree to explain it that well, and it's one of the main focuses of current AI research.  However, once trained, an AI will have a mathematical model to respond to certain board states. So, it's smarter than looking ahead and brute forcing because the model is trained to respond to common patterns, much like a human might do. When you play a game, you recognize patterns, and respond to that with statistically likely solutions that you have seen done before. For example, with chess grandmasters, it's almost reflexive what they should do, because they are simply looking for patterns. They aren't so much looking ahead as a brute force AI would do. 
> I don't know if that's even true.

True. I don't either.

wtf im racist now.
Same here. I seem to remember always being told to walk a mile in someone else's shoes. 
Yeah. I understand it (more or less). I took an AI class last semester at my university that only dipped a little bit into machine learning. It's really frustrating seeing people dismiss OpenAI's accomplishments without really knowing what they're doing.


People are afraid of speaking out. They always have been.

Speaking from your heart about what you believe in will always take courage. What we need now, and always, is courageous people willing to have their voices heard. Especially in the face of adversity. 
This is how the current YouTube recommendation algorithm works. 
The AI that played in GO doesn't "calculate ahead". That would be a classical AI that searches state spaces and uses min-maxing to win against an opponent. GO has a huge combination of moves that can be made, and it can't just "brute force" win against an opponent. Instead, it has to use machine learning and actually analyze the board state to figure out what move would be best. This is where it leans on its training data and picks the best move according to its past training. 

That's why the GO competition was such a ground breaking moment in AI history. 

I think what /u/heapstack was hinting at is that Dota has a huge state space (Possible states the game can be in). Way more than GO. This "incomplete information" sort of game would also means that a classical AI would have to churn through a huge number of possible states the game could be in. Instead, OpenAI would simply put all of the game state knowledge it has into the model for the game. And out the other side will pop recommended movements for the current frame based on the AI's past training on what seemed to work. 
I agree with your sentiment about Elon's never ending hype train.

However, the bot only trains by playing against itself. If they let it play online, it would start learning more human play styles and ways to defend against people trying to trick it.

Because NK is a wild card. Mostly, when the US launches something from our mainland, it's a satellite or something that's completely harmless. NK has been beating on the war drum for some time now. If they launch a rocket, it is most likely a missile, and if they turn around and say "that was just a satellite" then maybe they shouldn't beat that drum so hard.

I pay for Google Music and Pandora. Both have different strengths and different weaknesses. I'm willing to pay for two different services as long as they're both really good at what they do. Not just because they have exclusive content. 

Multiple competing services is a good thing, but having many extraneous services isn't beneficial if most of them only exist due to exclusivity.

Ever since they started taking it seriously. Reddit mods can get a bit too serious sometimes because they're too close to the issue. Can't see the forest through the trees and whatnot. I'll try finding a post but they probably deleted it. 

Here it is: https://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/comments/6s3e3b/if_this_post_gets_10000_upvote_i_will_unban
/u/GeckoGary posted to /r/circlejerk a bunch of times, each time hitting the top of the subreddit. Even hitting the top of /r/all. The mods of /r/circlejerk decided that they're admins now and they banned him for vote manipulation, which usually means using bots to get a ton of upvotes. This is something the mods can't be completely sure about and the admins never contacted them to ban him.

That's for his other idea with the car sleds.
There's no way they would let anyone on this thing without regulating the hell out of it. I suspect that there will be thousands of sensors throughout the entire tube to sense for stuff that could jeopardize the safety of the occupants. These sensors would test things like contaminants in the air that would put a hole in the capsule and shut the whole system down if it got too dangerous. Passenger safety would be the number one priority. There aren't people scheming behind the scenes to push the system in unsafe circumstances to make a quick buck.
Does it have to be underground? I was under the impression that it could be above ground as well. Like in this video.
What is this black magic fuckery?
I actually feel myself growing tired.

I never said it wasn't painful. I said it's not the same, at least in the context that he's using the word in.
Possibly. I feel like the jokes might grow a bit sourdough.
Okay. I disagree with the user's use of retarded, but I have to say it's not on par with "nigger". That's a bit much. It's a very crass and outdated way of describing a variety mental conditions such that it has turned into an insult, but it wasn't originally used to dehumanize huge numbers of people so they understood they were only property. All insults are not created equal. Some have a lot more history and carry a lot more weight than others.

But I suppose neither of these insults apply to me, so who am I to say?

 
No problem! Also, inverse kinematics would only be needed if you move the arms electronically through motors in order to figure out how to put the screen in a desired position. Which would be super cool, but not required if moved manually. You would only need normal "kinematics" equations to find out where the screen is if you move them manually.
Well, you're not a commie. So you probably wouldn't use commie units. 
I had an account like that. Someone found out what the password was and changed it :( 

I forgot to verify email sadly.
Well, there are two different ways that I suggested. 


The first way involves motion-capture technology. In fact, this way is getting super cheap with the current advancements in IR tracking thanks to the Xbox Kinect. Using that system, you would only need to put those white dots onto the screen corners. These dots are made of a special material that reflects a lot of the IR. This lets you turn down the sensitivity on the Kinect, and only see the dots. Then, you can track each screen, where it is and what orientation it is in. This actually could be cheaper depending on your usecase. 


The other way involves kinematics, which basically means you can figure out the position of the tip of some arm based on the length of each arm, and the angle of each joint. I said "Inverse Kinematics" before, but that's the study of how to move a robot's arm to a position. The inverse of figuring out where the arm is. You can figure out where the arm is by putting rotary encoders on each pivot point of the arm. It's actually pretty cheap until you calculate how expensive these arms are, they're usually about $100 per arm. AND the screen always has to stay on the arm. So if you have your screens on the arms already, this could be really cheap. But I personally prefer the motion-capture way in terms of elegance. 
Did he break his arms too? I'm sure he can wipe his ass, if he even does.
That's a good way to get burned out. AI is a huge field. Start with search algorithms and you'll be able to solve most problems by mapping it to a state space. Once you have that mastered, move on to algorithms that fit to models like you're suggesting. 
Not really. You're talking about position. Getting position from just acceleration is pretty difficult, and if you don't do it exactly perfect it will start drifting over time. 

I feel like you would have to track the position of each screen through a mocap-esque setup that could track the corners of each screen. Then you would be able to move the screens about and have a rock-solid image every time. Either that, or you could mount all of the screens on arms and use inverse kinematics to figure out the position of the tip of each arm. Which would probably be quite a bit easier.
Tru tho
