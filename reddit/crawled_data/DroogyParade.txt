YouTube Red. 

Which includes Google Music also. 
Does that matter much though? I know this is a nitpicking thread, but the Russos even said that Thanos was the main character of this movie. 

They've all had like 5 movies each for their own dialogue and character arcs. They were the B-story character in this one. 
One cries when I cut it.
Had the phone since launch. Barely a scratch on the phone.

I've been looking for an excuse to buy a new one, but this one is still working and looks like new.
What's up with this dumb hypothetical? 

I'll just buy a new phone. 
You can disable it.
Once the phone breaks then yeah.. it's unusable.. 

I don't get what you're trying to get at. 


Sorry I meant the proximity sensor.
I can't remember any of my previous phones having this feature. 

The proximity sensor turns off the screen while you're in a call, it doesn't disable screen function. 
My phone(OnePlus 3) has a feature where if the front camera sensor is blocked screen function is disabled. 

I don't know if this is available to other phones, but if does have a pocket mode, enable it.  
Without spoiling it I can't say why, but I don't think it was deceptive at all.
I get off at 10pm, 35-45 minute drive home. 

Fuck cleaning up dishes at midnight. 

Last few months though I've gotten into the habit of taking some steamed rice and chicken home from work. 
I was going to say this but with Houston. 

Cypress, Tomball, The Woodlands, Jersey Village, Pasadena, and even Galveston to some people to name a few. 


This is only due to the fact that people from certain backgrounds speak different because of the environment they grew up in, not their race.

I'm Hispanic but have been called out by other Hispanics for "talking white" growing up.



We can buff them out. 
I've been using Google Play since day one, but their UI is ass. 

I have a friend in my Family plan, but he still uses Spotify because it looks and works better on his phone.

YouTube Red being included is worth it alone. There's already a ton of music on YouTube, plus audiobooks if you can find them. 
Christopher Nolan as well. 
You're seeing the notch as extra added screen, when really it's just a chunk of the screen being taken off to make room for sensors and a camera. Which is why Apple did it, and I don't care if they did, I don't own any Apple products. What's bothersome is that now Android phone manufacturers are following this trend, but only because of the style Apple has set to attract people. 

Again, look at the S9+. Has a way bigger screen than the iPhone X and no notch. 


Extra for what? 

It's horrible for videos, which is the biggest reason for  wanting a larger screen. Just make the phone a little bit taller. Samsung has been going the right direction in this. 

I haven't owned a Samsung phone since the Note 3, but I might be getting the S9 soon. 
Killer Klowns is an amazing movie. 

It also has a great soundtrack too. 
Voss? 

Had the same problem happen to me the other day.
$90 from me. 

Bought tickets for the group the minute they went on sale. My friends wait until last minute for everything.
To echo what everyone else is saying, didn't realize HEB sold movies. 

Also if anyone is in the west part of Houston there's a chain called Games Plus that has great deals on movies, they'll have brand new sealed movies "used" for around $15. Another chain called Movie Exchange, which has a ton of rare finds. Almost bit the bullet on the Star Wars original trilogy theatrical cut they had on display.
We did a couple. 

Froze some other stuff. 
I took over a few months ago, it's easy as hell. 

The only bad part is when you have an unexpected slow weekend and you end up with a shit ton of extra product. Happened this weekend to me. 

It's not my fault, but damn does it feel bad. 


I noticed this a while back when I drive. 

When I drive alone it's just me listening to music, or podcasts. Sometimes I have those "I don't even remember driving home" moments, where my body is just on autopilot.

When I'm with someone we're always talking about the surroundings. 
Probably because we're seeing what was actually shot with the IMAX film. Which is a lot taller than the regular 35 or 70mm. 

So rather than shots be cropped to fit the rest of the widescreen format, they're shown as close to the native aspect ratio. 

It bothers me at times when they cut from the big action set piece shot in IMAX to a regular close up shot, but over all I really like it too. 
A few years ago I also ran into two dudes saying that they had been delivered a couple extra projectors for Buffalo Wild Wings. They showed me the "paperwork" for them. 

I declined their offer. 
Oooo ooo are we quoting each other now. Fun. 


>Hahaha this isn't you talking shit either huh? Funny how easy it is to see through you people. 

You can believe whatever you want. 

>How could a nobody ever hurt anyone's feelings?  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 

Pretty easily. Happens all the time. 


>I mean, you flat out say "I'm a piece of shit". Next time just don't make it so easy for me ya know? 

Did I really now? I don't see that in any of my comments. But since we can just do this. You literally called yourself a faggot. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 

>Hahaha that's what I said to you stupid!

Nah. You brought it up, meaning you actually care about them. I never once brought that up. 

Is that how sensitive you are? Poor baby. I'm sorry that you think that's talking shit. Didn't realize I was dealing with a little snowflake. 

I apologise if I hwurt your fweeling. 

You keep mentioning this "Reddit", but you're just as much on it as I am. Lmao. Why you insulting yourself like that bruh. 

Who cares about upvotes and down votes lol. Get outta here kid. 
I never talked shit, didn't even get a chance to read the joke. 

I ain't holier than anyone. Like I said, not my problem, and don't really want to help. 

You're talking to the wrong person here pal. 

Don't give a shit about this girl who probably just ran away with a boyfriend, like many of them end up doing. 

You really should stop assuming what other people are like. Makes you look kinda dumb. The only reason I'm even responding to you now it's because I'm on the toilet. 
Didn't cry, don't care lol

I never said I was going to do anything. Not my problem, but you have fun helping. ✌️
Guess you aren't proud of him anymore. :(
Apple did it, and they pretty much set fashion standards for phones. 

I just looked it up, it's under $10 a month?! 

I've always had the roadside assistance from Allstate so I never bothered looking up AAA. Might have to sign up for this. Allstate only covers like $150 of towing. Last time my car needed to be towed they charged me $95 to bring my car to a shop that was maybe 5 miles away. 
That's true. 

Better than nothing I suppose. 
I just moved closer to downtown, but still work out in the suburbs, so 30-45 minute drive while listening to podcasts. 

I know many people hate driving, but I really enjoy it.


What we lack in actors we make up in directors. Cuarón, Iñárritu, and Del Toro.

This is honestly just sad. 

I've been doing 60 hour weeks lately, but I'll either cook myself something at work or get drive thru. 




It's a fantastic show. 

The visuals are incredible. Some of the best Cinematography in a TV show next to Mr Robot IMO.
Don't go to r/headphones and see what they spend over there. 


We got gumbo on the menu.

Customer says it's okay, they can have a little gluten. 


Either way I wouldn't want to be around him when he started shooting.
My friend and I went to see Nightcrawler when it was in theaters. 

About 20 minutes into the movie some old dude walks in, had a large coat on and a hat. Sits 2 rows in front of us. I couldn't stop thinking about "what if" the entire rest of the movie. 

Fast forward to my friend and I sitting in his car, he turns to me an says, "that guy in the hat had me on edge the entire time." 

I think it's pretty common to have these thoughts now. 
Half the movie should have been cut. 

Hux was basically given the role of a stooge. 
Most Disney movies now seem to want to be comedies. 

Half of the deleted scenes from The Last Jedi are comedy bits. 
Those were apparently not true. 
Yeah, they should have had some people on the other side waiting to catch the car.
Answer: Albert Einstein. 
Our feeder roads are awesome, and we're basically the only city with U-turn lanes under the freeways. It was odd going to a city without them. 
When it got to the question of what do I call the road next to the highway, I knew it would know exactly where I am from. 

Houston is the only place that calls them feeder roads.
The podcast is where I got this information, and some of my own research after listening to the series. I've listened to the last part twice now. 

Only 32 weapons were recovered.

Yep. In the tapes you can hear Jones telling the parents the kids are only crying because of the taste, and not the pain. Fucked up. 
That's actually not true. 

By that point they would do anything for Jim Jones. There was a woman who cried out against the act, but she was booed off the stage. The children were given the poison by their own parents, who then drank the poison themselves.

They lined up and as they each drank they kept going up to the microphone and thanking Jones. 

These people were brainwashed. 
The unwilling were children. Which was a third of the people there. Out of almost 1000... 

The adults mostly all drank the poison willingly. 

Jonestown was running out of money and was pretty low on bullets by that point. The people who were gunned down were congressman Ryan and the camera crew at the airstrip. 
I think that's the point. 

Last year I had only one person say happy birthday to me on Facebook. I haven't posted anything on it in 2 years. Even that was too many. 


I honestly didn't realize this.. 

I honestly thought we bred cows that just produce milk now.

Use a small safety pin and clean out the USB port. 

I was having this same problem. Couldn't move the phone at all because the cable wouldn't latch on and it would just fall off. Bought a new one and same problem. 

I cleaned it out and there was a lot of lint that had been pushed down into the port. Compressed air won't get this out. 

I've had my OP3 since launch with the same cable.

Also we have no smokers in my kitchen either. One of them Vapes though.

My friends and I never ask each other for gas money. 

Even if I have to go out of my way to drive them home drunk. 

Last time I had to go out of my way to pick one of them up from the airport, he bought me lunch, but there was never a conversation over money exchanged. People on Reddit are so quick to jump on everyone's shit. 

We're all in our mid 20's. 

The only times we talk about gas money is when we go on our yearly road trips. 

My mom went all out. 

Texas flag shower curtain, Texas shaped toothbrush holders, Texas flag rugs, Texas flag towels, or they were all red white and blue.

I went in blind to The Founder and loved it. 

Micheal Keaton was incredible, he's such an asshole in the movie, but I just couldn't stop rooting for him. 
Yeah what an idiot. 

Saying that a movie with a concept that sounded dumb could end up being good. 
I'm so glad I bought it at Walmart a long time ago. 
True, but I like having a Blu Ray collection.

So I can block them. 
A little late to this party, busy with work the last 2 days. 

I feel like I have avoided everything negative about this industry. 

I don't do drugs, I rarely drink, I do work a ton of hours, but I'm usually fine by the time I get to my car and put on some music/audiobook. 

Also I get paid pretty well. Am able to live comfortably close to downtown. 
Back in the safety of my room.
I forgot the cleaning lady was coming today, I'm currently in the bathroom she just cleaned... 
I did listen to it. 

Which is why I'm saying that they willingly took it. They were pretty much brainwashed into these beliefs, and would follow Jim Jones to death. 

I was stating that they weren't forced at gun point to take cyanide. They wanted to die, because Jones convinced them that it was their only option. 
Most actually did it willingly. 

In the tapes they keep praising Jones while taking the poison. The people who didn't want to were forced first, but they were far out numbered by the willing.

I'm Mexican and we're both Chefs. He said we should move up there and open up a taqueria. 
They weren't making money. 

YouTube is a thing because Google has the money to host all the content for free. 
Go to Universal Studios and look for old people with a clipboard.
My friend and I did that a couple years ago. We were tired by that point and so why not get $50 to sit and watch a TV show? 

It was the pilot for a show called Strange Calls with Dani Pudi. Never aired though. 

We went last year and they offered us $100 for a longer session but we had another friend with us who had never been to Universal Studios before. 


Do you have location history enabled? Really helps. 

Also depends on where you live too. I just moved closer to downtown and have been getting more questions the last few months. 
I don't think more than half the people posting on there know what SMS stands for...

Bought the 3rd season of Mr. Robot with it. 
["Inside the loop."](https://i.imgur.com/q6df4mA.jpg)
No. 

In fact this season was kind of weak. Too happy of endings to be honest. Which is why I really enjoyed Black Mirror to begin with. It was a show that held nothing back, and left you with a punch to the gut. 
 
This season didn't really give me any of that at all.

I've never really cared about headphones all that much. Especially over ear ones, but these last few months I've been curious as to what I was missing. 

I bought these off Amazon with a Bluetooth adapter for $100 a week ago. They've been amazing. If anyone has any suggestions about accessories, please help me out. I'm brand new to all of this. 

I'd like to keep it under $100 for anything else I need to buy... *For now*..
I think I know my friends well enough to trust them with a book in my bathroom... in fact we have a small library in it for them to read just in case. 

Also why is everyone acting like going to the bathroom means everything suddenly is covered in shit? Do you change clothes and shower everytime you use the restroom? Just wash your hands dude.
I have one of those drawing tablets on the fridge and it's always covered in new drawings.

That had some buzz behind it. It died down because the show didn't do very well. At least not with anyone I've talked to. I could barely even finish the first episode.
No, they start at like 16 or 17 IIRC. 


The Dr. Phil episode is really good for new people.

It does a good job of showing you who Dick is and why he's "famous". 
I'm still on the OP3 I got at launch and this phone runs like new still.

They tried multiple times for the same places too, luckily my bank stopped all the transactions from going through.

One of my favorite podcasts The Weekly Planet does their reviews like this. It's either best movie ever or worst movie ever. It's hilarious.

I won't compare 4K to 3D.

You've already seen my 3D rant, but I have nothing against 4K. There's no compromise there. There's no compromise in upping the quality of something. Only in terms of money spending. Should I get a new TV or finally get the projector I've wanted? That's a compromise.
Pnash is my favorite, but the Enigma was hilarious. 

That was the episode where I upped my patreon to $20. Where he had to call in multiple times to explain the joke.

>I prefer the sense of 3D in scenes that weren't shot to showcase 3D

What? 

I get what you're trying to say, but if the movie is in 3D is should showcase it with as many scenes at it can. Like Avatar. It felt like you were in that world. In 2049 there wasn't really much of that, and there were no "bullet flying at the audience" moments that I can recall in the movie. 

To make up for the darkened image they edit it? They up the contrast? That would make the blacks less black, and diminish the quality of the movie.(just image, not story) 

I'm not saying you don't have to like 3D, but this movie definitely did not need it and it felt like a studio decision to get more money off ticket sales. 

I shouldn't have to make a compromise to see a movie. 
Hm.. so a show, who I give $20 a month to. Gave me a FUCKING AD?! You know what makes me a rage. Hidden ads. 

/u/DickMasterson explain. 
The 3D added nothing to this movie. 

It's really wasn't shot for 3D at all. There's maybe a handful of shots in a 3 hour movie that you could experience the 3D, but overall it really didn't add much. 

Half the movie takes place at night, or in darkly lit areas, the 3D darkens the image more making less details pop out. 

I was honestly surprised Dick didn't know about this. 

Or he could have just been fucking around and just saying that.

And while I love the 2+ hour podcasts, biggest problem kept Dick from rambling on and losing the topic. 
I've been doing that for the last 4 years and got jealous of my friends getting back hundreds of dollars. 

I was gonna spend the money anyway, why not just make the government hold on to it for a bit so I can have more spending money when I go on my spring vacations.

High rent, billionaires buying up all the land, food costs too much, and a homeless epidemic. 

I'll pass on living there. 

Would like to visit though.

The original trilogy isn't even THAT good. It's just a well told story that didn't try to hide half its story for a sequel. That's the most bullshit part about TLJ. All of Force Awakens we're given the mystery of Rey. Then in one fucking line Rian Johnson says, yeah fuck you for being invested in one of the key story lines that will go nowhere. Just like fucking Snoke. 

The original trilogy wasn't even planned out as such. No one knew how well it was gonna do, but they made a good story, then improved on it with Empire. 

These new movies Disney has planned out for the next two thousand years. So there's no tension with any characters. There's no Han frozen in Carbonite moment, no dark endings. There's no risk, everything is carefully planned out.
I wasn't planning on it, but the mall was open and I had 3 hours to kill before going over to my family Christmas party.

It's perfectly fine to have a headphone in, it's no different than having someone in your car and talking to them. 
That circuit board gag was pretty dumb. It's electricity, so let's plug one miss fire. Oh woops, I guess it leaked out of the other ones. Let's just bash my head into it then. BB-8 should have been dead about 3 or 4 times in the course of the movie. 

I just finished watching it a second time about an hour ago. There was a lot of dumb stuff in this movie. Lots of great scenes, but they don't make up for the bad. 


I don't work normal hours. I go in at 2pm every day, except for Friday, I gotta be there at 10am. 

It's the only day where I get a break for lunch at work.

I spend about 25% in Houston. Got lucky and live in a house that my friend's parents own, my friend pays no rent so it also comes with a maid and a lawn care service that he pays for. 

It's also near downtown where I'd be paying more than double of what I do now. 
The whole point of me getting it is because I want it now. 

All the presents I bought for myself I already opened.

All of my friends 24-27 age range disliked it. Most of the people who I have talked to that are huge Star Wars fans hated it. 
>if it's true

So why don't we wait until we know the truth to call them a rapist. After reading TJ's wife's statement it seems like a false accusation. Honestly it's comments like yours that feed the "guilty until proven innocent" fire. 


Is it anxiety? 

As a guy I still get nervous going out alone with my camera. I know most people don't care, but having anxiety makes it so that even one person being judgemental ruins my drive. 
I changed it to computer and can't stop myself form doing a Picard impersonation. 
During Black Friday I managed to sell 3 to a lady at Best Buy. I don't even work there.

No they did. They also founded the mineral water Topo Chico. Didn't you know?! 


You're comparing the feeder roads to a tollway? 

If you got on 99 I'm pretty sure you'd see people going 100 also. 
I didn't say it was a bad thing, just making an observation. 

I've been a huge fan of Abrams since Lost. 
Abrams doesn't like going past PG-13. 
Right? The whole point of Pa Kent dying was that it was a heart attack, and supes, even with all his powers, couldn't stop that. 

I enjoyed MoS, but the tornado scene is dumb. 
Unless you're an Uber eats delivery driver. 

Have ordered McDonald's many times late at night. 
Owner put up a sign on the kitchen board for an Ugly Christmas Sweater Contest. 

Now it just says Ugly Ass Sweat Contest.

Welcome to the kitchen industry. Culinary degrees can cost you about 50-100 thousand dollars, but you'll make $10 an hour at a Michelin star restaurant because you're doing it for the experience.
They're mainly talking about the Restaurant industry as a whole not being a sushi chef. 

I just became the Sous at my current place and the stress is pretty high. Money's gotten a bit better, but workload has increased a bit. Trying to manage labor and food cost, while having the owners telling you why you can't do this and that. We just had a health inspector come by last week too and he stuck around for almost 2 hours while we were in the middle of a big lunch rush. We passed, but damn did he make me nervous. 
I remember back when Asterios would live stream being at Maddox's house, it looked too small to fit a table in there. 

I can't believe I used to think you were the idiot when I first started listening to TBPITU. 
You can get them on Google Play Music. If you have a subscription you can stream them. 
100 degrees with 100% humidity. Summer days. 
I just got home from work and [this](https://i.imgur.com/Wrq6EE4.jpg) is what's left of my snowman on top of the car! 


I just moved here also from Cypress, couldn't find my gloves either. I put a hoodie in the dryer and changed into that after being outside. Feels great. 

Carrots! I forgot to put them on mine. Though there'd just be a bunch of rocks and a couple of carrots on my roommate's car when he woke up.
Did you wear gloves? My hands are freezing. 

These are the first snowmen I've built in my life. 

https://i.imgur.com/J9Aj7zh.jpg
I have! 

I built a snowman on my roommate's car. It's going to melt before he wakes up. Lol


They can't. 

My ex was from up North. She got so mad when we went to the museum district during summer and couldn't believe the humidity. She was wearing a short sleeved summer dress and I was in jeans and a long sleeve shirt. 
Just like Mr. Burns. 
Well you're forgetting Bridges and overpasses, which freeze a lot faster. My biggest concern is 45 or 610 freezing. 

Edit: oh no he deleted his comments after getting Downvoted. 
Hell yeah dude! My roommates and I were outside hanging out waiting for it. 
I've had a letter written to me before(I'm a dude btw). It's desperation. If you're ever in that situation, just write it but don't send it. Read it a couple days later to see what you actually wrote. 
Sweet, will be checking this out, thanks!
From Bandcamp itself, it's only a dollar. 
It was $80 without the ads. 

I don't need a tablet, so I just bought it to have as a just in case. I don't like Samsung smart devices. I had an old Samsung tablet that lost support after a year. 
This is why I bought an Amazon tablet this Black Friday. 

$80 for the HD 8. Installed the Play Store on it and it works amazingly.
Adam Pnash is even funnier for me. That damn accent gets me. 
He shows up in the barn to give a pep talk to Tony, and then at the end with one of the helicarriers to pick people off the floating Sokovia. 
I believe it. 

There's been a road closure every other week since I moved. Been making the adjustment down here a little difficult. 
I just moved to East end a few months ago. 

This shit is terrible. 
That's a problem with the cords not the plugs themselves. 

Currently having that problem with my OnePlus 3. Had it since launch with the same charging cable, but it's now pooping out on me. It's not the USB-C port, it's the cable being worn down after a year and a half of everyday use. 


Eh not really. 

I cringe when I touch hot stuff because I use tongs or a towel to grab hot items. Not gonna risk my hands to act tough. 

Been in the industry for almost a decade now. 

I made fresh mozzarella for a year as well. 
Disney planned this thing to be a half hour special on ABC. It's in the article.
Oh, definitely get out of there. 

Nepotism is the worst, and they're going to run that place to the ground without proper rules. 
I don't think you read the part where the kids are not loving it. 

It's hard to get kids to sit for over 2 hours. Coco's runtime is advertised at 1 hour and 50 minutes. 2 hours 10 minutes with the short, and 2 hours 30 minutes with the previews. That's a really long time to keep a kid sitting still. 

Also many people don't like Frozen. Such as myself, and they're saying the short itself isn't that good. When you go to a PIXAR movie you expect a PIXAR short. Not a Disney half hour special. 
The people who go in thinking that this "short" will be you know, short in length.

No need to be an asshole about it. 

I wouldn't call 20 mins a short anymore. 

That's a full length episode. 

Which is what this "short" was supposed to be. A half hour Christmas special for Disney. 

I'm going to wait until Coco is on demand to watch it. 
You need to talk to the owner. Mention this little tidbit. 

If the health inspector comes by and there isn't any gloves there's gonna be fines. 

Tell them to put you in charge of ordering. I know everyone says this, but you should look for a new place. Good restaurants need good cooks. If you're going this above and beyond for this place, a better restaurant could use your skills. 
He is apparently harassing his previous business partner and is now being sued. What an asshole. 
Right? 

When I went to Vegas the heat was so nice because you could just step in the shade and be fine. However my lips were chapped like crazy that week.
You didn't change them out...? 

Dude gloves are cheap. Change them out every half hour if you're bleeding that bad. 
In professional kitchens you're not supposed to hang anything off oven doors, because when you open them whatever's on the door will touch the ground. 
Last time I went I gave myself a budget of $150 a day. 4 days later I have no money left of that budget, but I had a ton of fun. 

Don't expect to win when you gamble. 

My friends and I are the complete opposite. 

We talk about movies day and night. 

Find other people to talk to rather than complaining about your social circle. You can't change who they are. Or make it sounds more interesting to their views, instead if having this "all anyone likes are sports and superhero movies" mentality. 
Coming in hot right in your ear straight from Dick!
Well they do write all of Asterios'' good content. 
He probably stepped down as director because of how WB was treating the story, and direction the Universe was heading. 

You have to remember that it's not his property, he doesn't call the shots. Also DC doesn't have a head like Marvel does with Kevin Feige, so he's just being told what to do by the multiple executives that just want to make money. Have you ever had a job with multiple bosses? It's stressful. 

Man of Steel came out a year after TDKR, and they didn't even have a world established. WB even wanted to have characters from TDK trilogy reprise their roles. It's a huge mess behind the scenes, that sadly we probably won't ever see. I honestly believe Affleck is a victim in all of this. 

For RDJ it's kinda easy now. He doesn't really have to do much. He's stated before that anytime you see Iron Man in the suit he's not even on set. They just film his face later. 
I mean.. it wouldn't be that wrong.. 

https://www.forbes.com/sites/robcain/2017/11/20/the-question-for-justice-league-is-not-how-much-money-it-will-make-but-how-much-it-could-lose/
Especially when he's the one who brought it up to everyone's attention and even laughed at it. 
They're great directors, but they're not in charge of the story at all. 

The reason why the MCU seems so cohesive is because Feige and Marvel are in charge of everything. Remember when Edgar Wright left? It was because of this reason. The directors have creative control on how they want to tell it, but at the end of the day Feige tells them where to go. 

Look at every behind the scenes making of for Marvel. Feige is always there talking about the characters and story. How many other movies have producers do that?
Wine. Costco is the biggest wine retailer in the US IIRC.
Google Music and YouTube Red basically became the same thing. 

I've had Google Music since launch and got YouTube Red when it launched since I was already a subscriber. 

One great thing is their family plan. It's $15 a month and 6 people can be on it. Which comes out to like $2.50 a person. So if you have 5 friends you can all just chip in $2.50 a month for the subscription. 
Sorry. I took it a little too personal. 

I like stacking my food. 
We plate it like that because all the flavors go well together. It's not a random assortment of vegetables and meat thrown on top of one another. 

I bet you're a pretentious douche who asks for a burger with everything on the side as well.
Hey Dick, just wanted to say your "I would have been happy with $500" rant was one of my favorites. 

I re-upped my patreon to $20 because of this lolsuit, and forgot how much I missed listening to the show unedited.
This and the "my friends, you bow to no one." From LOTR always get me. 
Yep. He's freaking out about leaving so he takes it out and puts it back in it's regular spot. 

Also foreshadowing that Creed will be the temporary manager at the end of the season.
I've heard it both ways.
As someone who does a haunted house every year for Halloween. It's a cool "cheap" effect that I'll be picking up for next year. 
In America, yes. 


Prove it. 
Mr. Plinkett would like to have a word with you about the prequels. 
It worked, all I see is *******, instead of Hunter2. 
You can have short parents and be tall. 

I'm 6ft and both my parents are like 5’6”. 
I'm pretty sure Uber drivers ask your name first before you get in the car. 

She was an idiot to just get in the car like that. 
I lose it at bed bath and beyond. 

Fuck yeah...?
Sous Chef here. 

Never done drugs and I only drink occasionally to socialize. 

I think there's something else wrong with me.
I haven't had a Samsung phone since my Note 3, but damn they're doing everything to win me back. 

I might just get the S9 next year.
I live in Houston. After Harvey it was almost at $3. Now things are back to normal and some places have gotten down to $1.95/gal. 

My car gets like 15mpg and my commute to work is 30 miles. I was so glad it went down this fast. 
Yeah, we come up with a theme and then make everything for it, it changes every year. 

We do not charge. It's something we both enjoy doing, it's a fun hobby. We try to out do ourselves every year with the size and complexity of the house. 

 
Growing up in Cypress, it's a big thing. 

Move to the suburbs and you'll see tons of kids out. My friend and I do a Haunted House in the driveway and last year we saw maybe 200+ people come through. 

It rained like crazy this year, so not a lot of people came out.


[This is the types of haunted house we do.](https://youtu.be/y7UIHET9cFk)

Should give them all a little of the old ultra violence. 
My history teacher showed this film to us when we were in highschool, multiple times. He had a two day lecture over the Kennedy assassination, and this footage he broke down and edited it to show everything that happened. 




It says they will pay in Walmart gift cards. 


I just moved to this house a week after Harvey, my last place didn't have recycling. 

Didn't realize this. My roommate is the one who told me about the glass situation. 

So what do I do with dozens of glass bottles? Throw them in the regular trash too?
Yessss 

B team all the way.

Our bottles are piling up too much.
Congratulations. 

You'll get a prize in the mail real soon.
I was at the store a few months back and just impulse bought the Philips Hue lights with 4 bulbs. Think it was like $150. My friends called me an idiot for spending that much on lightbulbs. 

They don't understand! 

I also recently backlit my TV, and I'm thinking of installing some light strips on the archway of the hallway and kitchen counters.
https://youtu.be/LFikOKLwDJ4
And again, they didn't really give their biggest audience(Youtube) any notice of this. A short video explaining what happened would have made everyone aware of how serious it was. 

They literally just brushed it off as a joke in the video, so why can't we?


Except we didn't really have all that context. 

I didn't know about the car thing until 2 days ago. Not all of us have a Twitter, or  check the subreddit every day. I just assumed videos were taking longer because of the short film they're doing. 

I think her response was way too harsh, and she took it way too personal. Art will always be criticized, and especially on YouTube comments. 

Yeah the book does look pretty cool. 

I'm gonna make those cubanos from Chef next week. 
I mean the movie didn't do very well at the box office, so it's not like it was gonna be crowded to begin with.
Think they mean that if you have a DSLR then your pictures will automatically come out good, not in terms of quality. 

There's times where i've taken better photos with my phone than my DSLR. 
Sorry. Guess they don't let you handle that kind of stuff. 

Good luck with your spatula and fryer basket. 
Turn in your tongs and your towel. 

Keep your knife, you might need it. 
The one where we find out what happened to House's leg too.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legends_Football_League 

>The league was founded in 2009 as the Lingerie Football League and was rebranded as the Legends Football League in 2013.[1]
Woah hey, big foul on that last part. We don't condone rape anymore. Go to the purse network for that.
I've said this before, but it's due to the fact that that's all we were to him. Fans. 

Have you ever heard Dick call us his fans? He only calls us listeners, and actually treats us like people instead of insulting us every chance he gets. 
25 and a chef, crispy bacon is better. 

However, I won't judge if you like floppy meat in your mouth.
Can you give me a percentage of the type of dicks that wall will be made of?

 Also, you will be paying for this wall too.
What's up with people always doing some sort of bullshit math for anything they recommend? 

He asked if it's good, so the answer should be yes or no. What kind of autismo do you have to be to give a math answer as a response?
For me it's wiping my hand on my left thigh. 

I keep a towel there at work, and whenever I cook at home I always end up doing it. 
Why didn't I think of that?! 

I'll just go out and buy a new car! 

Thanks dude!
I haven't bought it, nor will I. 

I wanted to but I still use my regular headphones a lot.

When I get in my car I plug my phone into the jack, when my friends ride with me I pass them the cord to put on their music, and I still have an old iPod in my car too. 

   
Was talking about battery size. Thicker phones, bigger batteries.
Yet every year phones get thinner... Apple boasts about shaving millimeters off their phones.
So better audio quality is to completely jump to Bluetooth, while it itself is not the best either? 

Bluetooth still needs a lot of work to become the standard. 

Also you realize now they can sell you more dongles? Go look at Apples website and see how many dongles they sell. Where before all you needed was the jack. Which came with the phone. 

This last point is also not about headphones, but Google also removed wireless charging too. When my Nexus 6(3 year old phone) has it. 
I like how everyone's response is to just buy another thing that was never an issue before. 

I already dropped $900+ on a phone, but the company was too cheap to include a headphone jack, so now I gotta buy a new adapter. It's not like it takes up a lot of space. 

I love my Bluetooth headphones, they're very useful at work, but hate when they run out of juice in an inconvenient place.    
Try to find an older edition. I got the 3rd one for like $10 used.
Say goodbye to weekends and Holidays. 

Also this textbook. https://www.amazon.com/Cooking-Textbook-Culinary-Fundamentals-5th/dp/013715576X
The Texas food handlers certificate is just taking a one hour course online. All you have to do is hit next for an hour, and you're certified. 


Depends on the job. 

I'm a chef and I'm pretty much practicing my cooking skills all day. 
Last year I went on vacation to Universal Studios in Orlando. Was wearing a Bad Brains hoodie and this girl working at the Simpsons land said she really liked it on me. 

Only one I can think of from the past few years.
This is pretty much how we do it at my place. Kept getting back med well steaks saying they were too rare because they had a slight sliver of pink.

Well done I was taught to just set it and forget it. 

Hm.. 4 within a 20 minute drive. 

Might check it out.
No hotel does that. 

What's crazy is that in Vegas you can go into any hotel and just walk around. My friends and I went last year and we walked around the Luxor and Bellagio, taking the elevators and going to places that mainly only guests go, and no one said a thing. 
Reminds me of that Lonely Island song. 

"Think she might have been a racist." 

"Doesn't matter had sex." 
Well then you need to take into account friction. 

Human skin and all of our insides aren't meant to move that fast. The Flash gets his powers through the speed force so that also protects him from dying, but he still needs a special suit otherwise all his clothes would burn off. 

Based on your rules you only have super speed, so you're still a regular human with that power. You'd just end up becoming jelly. 

I personally would pick telekinesis. 
Guess you're not a fan of most Nintendo games?
I had True Crime: New York City for the Gamecube. so much fun. 
Yeah the majority of people aren't soccer moms doing that. 

How bout you calm down. Isn't weed supposed to mellow you out?
My friends can't remember what they last bet on poker when high, no way I'd trust them going down the highway at 70mph. 


I always think about how they wipe...
Think you missed the point. The phone is already $800+. It should already come with the jack.

It's bullshit we have to drop even more money to use something that we've had for decades. 

I own Bluetooth headphones. I love them, but in my car the aux is my best friend, and my wired headphones don't need to be recharged.
Chef here. 

Depends if you like almonds, but not really anything special. 
Let's be honest though. Half of our pictures just end up on Instagram. 
You need a filter.
There's a Netflix plan that's a few bucks more to stream 4 devices at once. That's the one I pay for. 
😞
A lot of people just come to look at the pictures. There's apps and extensions just for Reddit images.
Arrow last season was way better than Flash. 
Yeah should have said GTA races instead. Those are one offs that I just watch randomly when I want something on in the background. 

Their episodic stuff starts off when they begin to do heists. 

For you and others that want to start as well, watch their GTA and Demo Disk videos. Some of the best improv out of them. 

Demo Disk start from the first video. It's episodic, GTA just find a title that you think you'll like. 
This may get some downvotes, but I thought The Dark Knight was pretty good.
He had a whole season for growth. 


I blame Iron Fist too be honest. He's very poorly written. Half his lines are "I'm the immortal Iron Fist."



What's the whole thing? 
We just have a big ass bag of them, that again I don't buy. I haven't cut myself in months so it's not really that much of a problem for me.
I don't buy them, and don't cut my finger enough to ask for them to buy bigger ones. 
We got those finger condom things. 

They're annoying as fuck though because they're small, so they won't slip off your finger, but they end up cutting circulation.
Yeah, I finished the book on Saturday. 
I mean, it's not like it's a hard job to do. 

Half the servers at my place have been there over a year and they still don't even know the full menu. 

It's an easy job, that a lot of them complain about making $2.50 an hour at, when in reality they're bringing in $15-20+ an hour with their tips. Being in the industry servers at other restaurants brag to me how much they make. Servers from IHOP and Denny's pulling in $100-200 on a good night working. Bartenders telling me they're making $45-50K a year working only 4 days a week.

It's basically a minimum wage job, that will never see a "livable wage" because every server will quit once they see their first paycheck. I work in a higher end restaurant and my servers can make $500 or more in one weekend.    
Everyone gets this wrong. 

In the book it's described that after defeating It, the children no longer feel a bond between. Beverly then does the one thing that will bring them all close and show them that she loves them. 

It's a weird part, but they don't have sex to defeat It, they do it because Beverly thinks it's the only way to keep them together.
Gotcha. 

Honestly, the whole book is great throughout. 

The kid side is better simply because we get to know the characters way more as children. We become their friends basically. The adult part is just them coming back together to fight IT again, and only takes place over the matter of a few days. 


I'm about an hour away from finishing the audio book. There's no second half with just the adults. 

The adult part is told along side the children's side. Cutting back and forth. Although the kids side does take about 75% of the book. 
The $12 option gets you ad free streaming. 

My friends and I all pay for a different service and share the passwords, so I can't really complain. 

Except for the new UI which is fucking terrible.
I believe FOX owns a part of Hulu though, as does NBC. 

That's why all those shows Netflix lost are ending up on Hulu.
What's with people abbreviating everything? 

You spend more time explaining to someone what it is than just typing it out from the beginning.  

It's like, WYGMIDFMTUY!  
Live in Houston and that's pretty much what I learned. 

Unless I open up a tab. 
A lot of it has to do with the calories. 

Let's say it has 1200 calories. Now if you divide it by six you can say, "only 200 calories! ^^^^per ^^^^serving" 
Are they free for everyone or do you need a eztag? 


You can often request someone to build it for you, for more money. 


I love putting my own furniture together. I moved last week, and Spent a few hours putting together my bed, dresser, desk and TV stand. I only lost one screw in the move!
GTA V gameplays are basically that if you haven't watched those yet. 
Why not just call in sick? You're already going to the doctor anyway so just get him to write you a note. 


What about your mom? 

This kind of upbringing has a lot more to do with the mother. I'm Mexican and if I would have let it happen my mom would have done everything for me. 


God I wish our kitchen was like that. 

I have to clean a flat top and fryer, meanwhile I'm watching pizza station finish their station in 15 minutes and book it for the door the second the clock hits 10.

I just called my last cat, Cat. She was chill. 
Oh shit dude! Was that after that intense scenes of them walking through the woods and a walker sneaks up on them killing a background Character?
Pratt didn't have a weight problem though. 

He chose to gain weight because he said it's funny.
I did. It's why I hate the show so much. 

It had potential. Just FOLLOW THE COMICS.
That's the last episode I watched. 

It was such bullshit they made that a cliffhanger also.
Game of Thrones has 67 episodes so far and it has accomplished so much. Compared to The Walking Dead which has 99. I stopped watching that show because it was going nowhere, it just kept dragging on and on until the big episodes happened. 

The Walking Dead is being milked to death, no pun intended, at least Game of Thrones has a definite ending already.  
Me: Maybe I shouldn't place my knife like that, I could cut myself if I reach by it.

Also me: Nah I'll just remember not to reach by it. 

Proceeds to reach by it and slice my finger. 
Some neighborhoods near Cypress got fucked pretty bad. 

Went out with my uncle in his truck and there was entire neighborhoods in 3-4ft of water. 
No you haven't, shanks_with_shiv.
I work near a very well off area in Houston. Always see Teslas around, and large trucks. 
Some highways do have a ruler on the side of ramps or exits marking the height in case of floods. 

However I've maybe only seen a dozen or so like that, and completely agree that there should be some sort of markings everywhere. 

What's crazy is that these roads aren't blocked off with anything. They just need to put a couple cones or tape and hopefully that'll stop people from driving through. 
They said not to call 911 because people were calling for everything. "911 I got water in my car." Is not a real emergency, and that's the kind of calls that they we're trying to avoid. Would you like to hear a busy tone if you were in actual danger?

Not to say what he's doing isn't a great thing, but don't spread lies and further flame the whole, "fuck the police" attitude of certain people. 
 
You know that's right.
Do you have location services enabled? 
Look at his post history. 

Asshole wants places to be open so he can grab breakfast because he has a lifted truck. 
Turns out the flies are actually running the park.
I knew what it was, still clicked. 
Everyone is safe here, thanks for your concern. 

We're lucky this neighborhood doesn't flood. 
Fuck dude, I can't imagine. 

I'm out in NW Houston right now and dunno know how I would take losing a collection I spent years on. Hope things are good for you when you return.
You're walking in poo water basically. 

Wash and dry your feet real good, especially between the toes.
What if I already ate and drank most of them?
If the item has an error scanning that means it's free, right?
Oh jeez... 

I'm a dude, and I would never think to ask a random girl if I could just walk with her. Even I'm creeped the fucked out about that kind of thought. 
They'll love your money but not you.
Probably some parents going through the kids clothes and donating stuff they think they wouldn't wear anymore. 

Mom threw out my favorite Pac-Man hoodie when I was in highschool. Still mad about that. 
Hey guys, this comment is just about your ad, and when you talked about buying knives. 

Don't buy an expensive knife unless you know how to keep it sharp. I work in a professional kitchen, and have seen many people with $2-300 knives that were dull as hell. Get a wet Stone and buy a cheap knife and practice on sharpening it. I have been using the same $50 knife for the past 3 years. 
> IMAX 3D and we're talking $25 tickets 

Damn. 

It's $15(US) where I live. 
As a straight dude, it's not an upside. 
I'm currently working with someone who got into this industry because they loved cooking. 

They're slowly hating the job more and more everyday.  


> got shit from the owner that I'm gonna let this place die.

Wtf..

That's all on them. You did the right thing leaving. 
For me it was because it was cloudy. 


I bought one for $350 last July, and it's still comfortable as hell.
Now you're just asking for them.  

If someone would have told me Locke was actually Jacks real father, oooo boy I would have been mad.
Houston.
I honestly think Disney was the one in control here. 


Or it's the slow season. 

We're about 60-70% patio seating, sun is out til 8pm, average temp is about 95~, and if we get even a light drizzle(like today) it makes it unbearable with our already high humidity.

I was given a Friday off a couple weeks ago. 
If they try that random table shit at our place they get in trouble, it just makes more work for the dishwasher.
The [poncho moment](http://i.imgur.com/kKNW05F.jpg) for anyone who hasn't seen it. 
Topo chico or Voss is my go to for sparkling. 
He paused the video and touched the screen. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWaNUEWqp2E
I think he's already been slaying that queen enough. 
So according to [this](http://www.slashfilm.com/james-cameron-terminator-genisys-endorsement/) he wasn't paid at all. 

Even so, the guy knows what he's doing. In the video he even states he had nothing to do with the movie, he's just a "fanboy", distancing himself from the movie in one sentence. 
Like any of you would say no to the money. 

You would take $5 to say the Emoji movie was amazing.
Houston is literally a swamp. 

I went to Vegas last year and the heat wasn't bad at all. Once I stepped off the plane when I got home I immediately felt the humidity. 
She's not. 

And I honestly don't even see how that would be a compliment. Switch out races and it sounds bad. "I wish all the blacks would go home. Except for you miss." 


I mean.. it was a digital code that would print on my receipt.. 

I don't understand how that would be an issue, to just print me off a code. When even their own computer said it was available. I'm gonna try a different store tomorrow. 
The Mr Robot subreddit figured out how part of the story would unfold in the first episode, which wasn't revealed until halfway through the season. 


I got a friend living in Hawaii and she hates that word. She said she got called that a lot, and not in a playful manner. 
The girl said if I just wanted the code, I said sure and she looked at the computer and said exactly "here it is, only 97 cents." 

I never even said the price, I just mentioned that I heard they had a sale going. She asked her manager if that was correct then he told me they didn't have any copies available in any store within a 130 mile radius. 
So I went to gamestop, and they wouldn't sell me the game for the dollar. They couldn't print me out a code because apparently they were all out?? 

Even though the girl at the counter looked up the game on their computer and confirmed they were available for the 97 cents. 
Thanks for the heads up. Gonna hit up Gamestop tomorrow. 
$7 per game?!

Lol


I asked the guy how much I would get for my 360 and about 20 games. He said maybe $50-60. 
That's the reason why I stopped going to the headphones subreddit.

I wanted to splurge and spend maybe $200 on a pair of cans, but damn some people think that because they dropped a grand on headphones and 500 on an amp you can too.

This is why I love photography. No matter how much your lenses and body cost, it won't guarantee you a perfect picture. 
Someone who I'm not friends with on Facebook put that as their status. One of my friends decides to call them a douche which makes it show up on my feed, because "X friend commented on Y status." 

I hate that I have to live off the internet or go see the earliest showing possible to avoid spoilers. 
It's not original, but it's a breath of fresh air. 

The PG-13 movie dominates the box office, and with it comes PG-13 violence. It's nice to see what will actually happen when someone shoots someone else in the head, or when they slice someone with a sword. Limbs and blood are gonna fly off. 


Target is where you spend a little more to not be at Walmart. 

One reason I like going to Target more is they have better Blu Ray selections.
Icons?
In the video they showed them rehearsing this scene before the fire, they're supposed to flair around and move away from the center so the people in the middle aren't trapped. 
Well.... 

Looks like I'll be cancelling my Audible.
It's not really the content I'm disappointed in. I have Netflix, Hulu, HBO, and Prime for shipping, but like I said, I own mostly Android devices and use a Chromecast for my TV.(will probably pick up a Roku soon though) 

Movies I just [buy](http://i.imgur.com/QtToe7v.jpg), so really TV shows are what I have those streaming services for. Netflix and Hulu have some of my favorite TV shows currently, except for Mr Robot(Amazon), which I ended up just downloading because I wanted a faster and easier way to stream it to my TV. 
Riding a bike to work is fine, but I'd rather take my car because it's way better. 

Their video service needs a facelift. I haven't used it in a while because it was too much of a pain to binge watch a show on it. God forbid you only have Android devices and a Chromecast too. 


Not all of us use Facebook either.
Truffle oil is pretty gross. 

I work in a semi fine dining restaurant and people think it's such a high mark of quality, and the owner sees it as something they can add $5 extra to a dish with it. 

It smells nice to some extent, but overpowers everything since the oil has a chemically added aroma, Dithiapentane.
My friend who has a Macbook buys games for when he eventually gets a PC.
You're forgetting inflation. For example The Game. Budget was $50 million. That's $76 million in today money. 
Kubo put me to sleep, somewhere around the part where they're in the water. My friend woke me up when it ended. 

Great stop motion and design, but it was a pretty dull story. 
Once you hit 100 it just shows you a ":D" icon.
This is gonna be stuck in my head all week.
Well you're the one who said it's hard to say you're no longer with them without explaining it 100 times. 

Saying they're an ex is way easier and no one will ask anymore questions. 
You can sum it up with two words. The ex.

September is a weird month. 

School starts back up mid to late August so for most summer is already over, and October is Halloween month so everyone is getting on horror mode. 
I can forgive conventions because the actors are literally in the room. 

Still annoying as shit though. 
It's interesting to read what WWII vets thought about Saving Private Ryan also.

Kingsman Secret Service was a February movie also. 
People who like guns(myself included) all think they can be Dirty Harry. 

In reality when will you ever use that gun besides the gun range? 

Comments such as these come off like you actually want to get mugged so you can get a chance to shoot someone. Like a Doomsday prepper waiting for the Apocalype.

My brother crashed his motorcycle and his ambulance bill is $3500. 
I mean yeah, you guys have like 5 or 6 states, right? We have 50.

It's apples and oranges. If we had that many states then yeah they'd of course be larger. 

Most of our states are actually liveable too. Isn't Australia like 70% desert? 
What's your point? 

Is your mind blown when you find out how small some European countries are?

 
That's how I felt the first time I drove from Houston to Orlando. 

Was so happy to hit Florida then my friend told me we still had about 5 hours of driving left. 
Aren't you supposed to stay under 50 for a donut?

We don't have the public transportation that they do either 
Well I've been looking for something to binge lately. Thanks!
I think the biggest issue Houston has is the size. 

Was hanging out with someone from out of town a while back. We went to the Buffalo Bayou Cistern, then they wanted to go to the Galleria not knowing it was going to be a 25 minute drive. They thought everything would be close together and we could just walk it.  
Think they were also trying to demonstrate that fire extinguishers aren't always as reliable either. 

You're supposed to replace them after a few years, and I bet almost everyone forgets to buy one in the first place, or replace the one came with their house.
After a while the choice becomes the curse. 
Whoops. I replied to you by accident, was supposed to be dfn85's comment that I replied to.

Don't think I drank water once when I was in Vegas.

>On the flip side, it was a bit unbelievable for an old man's speed and reaction times to be able to keep up with spider-man.

Peter is a 15 year old who has no idea how to really use his new powers. He can't even figure out his new suit. 

He is fighting a man who has been using his suit and honing his skills for 8 years. The "old man" isn't keeping up with Spider-Man, the suit and experience are.
You can blame the idiots who try to run away and accidentally wind up somewhere they weren't supposed to. 

I worked at a haunted house for one Halloween season. Half the people going through don't give yo shit about the workers. The one I worked at had some narrow hallways, and guess where what area I worked at? I got shoved and yelled back at a lot. 

Those people aren't really there for you, rather they're there for the actors in case of an emergency. 
They win in my book just for Halloween Horror Nights. 


I replaced my pads, and my bearings. Still with the light on. Turns out it's a wire that's all fucked up.

This is the thing no one realizes. The size of this city. 

If you say you live in Houston you could be talking about Cypress, Montrose, or Clear Lake. All of which are really far apart from each other. 
Exactly. It's 2 bucks here and there, and it makes me feel better. 


Only reason I like Studio Movie Grill is they pump up the volume of the movie way louder than normal to mask the sound of people eating. 

Where I'm at(Houston), there's a few chains that do the same. Studio Movie Grill, Star Cinema, and Alamo Drafthouse. 

I'm honestly not a big fan of them. I don't really eat while watching a movie, and the screens are way too small. Prefer IMAX. 
The coffee melted her skin.

What similar stuff did they do for the OP3? 

I got mine at launch and I remember nothing but praise coming out of this phone. The only problem a lot of people had was the sRGB color stuff. 
Who wouldn't like that anyway.

Once you get on Disney's payroll you're set for life. 
Hawkeye and Widow movie of their time as SHIELD agents would be pretty dope. 

I also love Hawkeye. People saying he didn't do anything in Avengers, yet he managed to almost take down an entire helicarrier with a few arrows. Dude's a badass. 
I like how people say this about Widow but then just ignore the fact that Hawkeye is a human too.

I liked Watchmen before I even heard of reddit. 

No. 

People remember it, and they know who James Cameron is. 

Also they just opened a very popular Avatar Land at Disney World, so I'm sure those millions of people who visited the park will remember it.
I've had my OP3 since launch. Love this phone. Won't be getting the OP5 though. Waiting for that Pixel 2. 
I did read the whole thing. I just thought that one quote was weird since I had never heard of that before, but it made me realize how much that basically applied to a lot of quinceneras I had gone to. Especially in Mexico.
According to the Wikipedia on a quincenera. 

>This specific passage marked a young woman becoming an adult, as she was presented as a virgin to the community for probable suitors.

I'm Hispanic and quinceneras always looked like small weddings without the husband when I went to them growing up.
Also the largest medical center in the world is in Houston too. So some of the best minds in medicine live here too.
Because most people will think it's weird. 

Unless you're attractive.
I'm not a server though. 

More of a /r/kitchenconfidential guy. I never interact with customers.
I work in a restaurant, and sometimes the customers wants to sub chicken instead of beef for certain entrees. The computer still makes them input a temperature, but most of the time when it's chicken they'll forget, so the computer by default puts in medium rare. 

So whenever this happens to a new server we like to fuck with them and tell them if the customer was happy with the medium rare chicken. 
Man, he went through all the trouble of editing this video and couldn't even think to alter more than 10% of his script. Makes me curious to see if he's ripped off other works.
And they want to remove headphone jacks.
That vibranium was stolen from Wakanda by Ulysses Klaw, one of Black Panther's villains. Not a random gunner. 


A lot of TV shows do. 

Mr Robot, Breaking Bad, Legion(seriously this one is just gorgeous sometimes), Westworld, Black Mirror.

The biggest problem is that all the movies basically have to abide by certain characteristics, so they can all fit the Marvel tone. 
In the first movie he said it was gold titanium or something like that. 

Also in Captain America they said that his shield was made from all of the vibranium that they had found. Stuff is pretty rare.
Thank you. I love that scene. 


These ads are not in the video. Take a look at my comment. The video I watched was months old and the ad is for a phone that just came out last week. 
Dude you too?! 

Mine was also a [FunHaus video](http://i.imgur.com/lcqIUF9.png)
I never said it doesn't. 

I honestly don't care. I like the show, so doesn't affect me negatively. Either way it doesn't bother me too much. Ads are already everywhere. 
Shocking that something has fans. 

I'm sure you own nothing that's branded, right?
That's insane. 

It doesn't come to my city until September. Guess I'm making a whole day out of it. 
Micheal Peña, man. Dude steals the movie. 




Apparently there's only one in Houston. Never heard of it before.  


Well some aren't open 24/7 actually. There's about 3 within a 10 minutes drive from me, and one of them closes at 11. 

But definitely check it out. They make their tortillas fresh in house, and they're great dipped in their queso.
Taco Cabana dude. 

It's some great fast Mexican food, and it's open 24/7.
Commenting so I can come back in the morning. 

Also where did you post the comment on? Most of my friends don't want to pose for me, and I haven't really found a way to find someone to model nearby without making it seem creepy? I'm still new to photography as well. Bought my camera last April. 
They were probably marketed wrong. 

Those movies have a lot more than just one being, well a "Fight Club", and the other about a serial killer that was never caught. The latter was probably since we never got any closure, and the general audience wants closure. 
I knew it was in Texas. For some reason that highway made me think of Texas. 
Bracelets? 
I'd like to be able to. Would make going to the beach or waterpark more fun.
Oh I know the size of Houston. I love this city, but on levels of popularity we're waaaay behind NYC, LA, SF, and Austin. 


I also live in Houston. 

It depends on the area. 

Also I honestly wouldn't say Houston is a *popular* city. 
$499.99


*Just* under.
A lot of them try to fluff up their videos past 10 minutes so they get more ad revenue.
Think of all the popular cities. Now don't live anywhere near them.

I'm with you on that. 

I don't like having my back touched honestly, it just irritates me when someone taps me. 
Because it was being viewed on a phone. 

Instagram was only on iOS for the first 2 years, do you remember how small those screens were back in 2010? 
It's the humidity that'll get you. 
I remember only seeing things from E3 on G4 shows. 


Also now we have every major YouTuber at that event doing behind the scenes coverage that we never saw.

If anyone wants a listen. It's hilarious.
This looks like it could be the album cover for a 70's band. 
Hm that's expensive. 

I ain't made of money dude. 


#BUT I'M GLAD YOU WANT TO EXPRESS YOUR OPINION.
I recently got some Philips Hue lights. Makes the room look so much better. 

They're a bit pricey though. Starter pack is like $75, comes with 2 bulbs. It's great to set them up on lamps and adjust the brightness. Makes my desk look a lot better.
Gorgonite scum. 

I love this movie​.
When I first saw the trailer it looked really cheesy. Almost skipped it. 

It has honestly become one of my favorite Marvel movies. 
Damn 3 year old should have known not to be a criminal. 
Ah yes, put those words in my mouth. 

I don't fear guns. Just trigger happy morons without a care for the public. 


>Pretty silly to be against our specifically outlined rights. 

Uh... 

>I like guns, I want to purchase one soon 


Now where exactly did I say I as against guns? 

You should check up your reading comprehension please, because I am in no way, anti gun. I just stated my views on how it looks like **for me** if I saw someone at the park with an assault rifle. 


Also do you realize when those rights were given our founding fathers didn't have AR-15's at their disposal. I'm just giving my two cents. 
 
Fuuuuck. 

I hope it's early October. 

I go on vacation the end of it.
It's not an irrational fear of guns that I have, it's a fear of a complete stranger walking around with a rifle strapped to them in public. 

I don't know this person, I don't know their mental state, and I don't want to stick around to find out. 

I like guns, I want to purchase one soon, but when I see a complete STRANGER in a PUBLIC PARK carrying a rifle. Yeah that's gonna creep me out a bit. 
No shit?! 

Looks like I just might buy it then. 
Good PR. 
Sounds like Houston. 

Fucking hate when a large pick up decides it no longer wants to be on the left lane, and switches to the right in front of you without signaling. Had this happen many times while driving down 290.
Yeah apparently 25% less power being used. 

But still. Imagine having that and 4000mah.
It's very convenient when you have multiple people in the car and they want to play something through the aux port. 

What's not convenient is only being able to pair your device to your car when not in motion. Tried to pair my phone with my friend's car during a road trip and it wouldn't let me unless the car was stopped. 
It only has to happen to you once for you to change your mind. 


More battery. 

How bout giving us another 1000mah. 

Think I might go with another phone this year. I don't like how they're going all Apple clone. 
Not all of.us are subbed there.
Keeping someone alive is a pretty good incentive. 


We had a NASCAR car one that we were sure rewinded faster than the other ones.
Snapchat does that automatically. It also thins out your face. 
I highly recommend everyone listen to the podcast episode of I Don't Even Own A Television on Ready Player One. 

I listen to it every few months because it's hilarious.

This will probably the first season of The Flash I won't rewatch. It took what should have been a 10 episode arc and stretched it out way too thin. 

However this season of Arrow. Definitely gonna watch that again. If you gave up on season 4 like many of us did, go and watch season 5. Great comeback and has some of the best episodes of the series. 
I'm just curious. With that kind of job, wouldn't they provide you a device of your own? 

I work in a restaurant and even the guys who deliver our linens have company phones for signatures and ordering. 
Should come check out Houston. 

Basically all that with non stop construction. Hate the constant road closures.
Big Daddy Marvel said so. 
His problem was infantalism, and he gave the example of adult coloring book. 

And it also depends more on what age range you are. Most of the people who do that stuff are probably in their 20's. I'm in my mid 20's and I remember my Facebook feed being full of adult coloring book stuff. Also the word "adulting."  
No worries. 

I was just wondering because most restaurants that I've been in always have the server clique. Who seem to have made their friends at that restaurant and will probably stop being friends with them once they move on to another. I guess it's probably due to their same work schedule, but who am I to say? 

I've never been one fond of making friends at work. I have a decent group of friends so making friends at work never crossed my mind. Plus with the high turnover of restaurants you won't see them for long. 
I didn't assume you were a server, I was asking an observational question. 

We have a great kitchen team, we all get along great at work, but most of us have very different lives outside of work. Now who's making assumptions. 
Do most servers just make friends at work and only hang out there? 

I work in the kitchen and we bolt out of there the minute we're done. I've never come to my restaurant unless I've needed to actually work. Servers are always hanging out and coming to work on their days off to eat/drink. 

Been at my place 5 years and have never once hung out with a single co-worker. 
Restaurant jobs pretty much require you to wear non slip shoes. 

Unless you want to eat shit while walking through the kitchen. 
It looks like Elyse is wearing one of Bruce's shirts since he's always wearing those kind of shirts. 
3 games plus in Northwest Houston, and 4 movie exchange stores all over. 

They have their locations on their websites.
Half price books is very overpriced in the Blu Rays​. At least where I live in Houston. 

We have a chain called Games Plus and they have a "used" movies section. I put used in quotations because they always have new releases brand new sealed, sold as "used" for $10-15. 

There's another chain called Movie Exchange and that one has a HUGE selection of DVDs and Blu Rays. They have one of the best sections for TV box sets. 
It actually does for them.

They spend about a million dollars per house last I was told by one of the employees. 

You can take a behind the scenes tour of the haunted houses and see how much went into building, designing, and casting the houses. 
This shit always trips me out. 

My friend and I do a yearly trip from Houston to Orlando. That takes us 15-16 hours.  
Right there with you my dude.
I found a few crumpled bills in mine. So I either had to fold them out to put in my wallet or just not use them. 

Tossed them in a drawer.
They probably just keep them on payroll until​ their kids have kids. 


Cheaper. 

We went last year for 4 days and had a flights plus hotel package. Was only $200. 

I like Dickies better. And they're cheaper. 
Here's the thing. Most people either want a Samsung or an iPhone. 

They're both metal and glass. No plastic to absorb the shock when it falls. 

Co-worker has the S8. It's glass screen from edge to edge. He dropped it after a week and it hit the corner and shattered. Accidents happen. People aren't doing it on purpose. 

I've personally only had one phone screen shatter. My Nexus 6. Fell out of my pocket while playing with a dog and hit a rock face first. 
Salt?
Dual cameras for one. No one's really asking for them. Just because the iPhone has them doesn't mean every phone now has to as well.
Or poor. 

>Prior to this time, lobster was considered a mark of poverty or as a food for indentured servants or lower members of society in Maine, Massachusetts, and the Canadian Maritimes, and servants specified in employment agreements that they would not eat lobster more than twice per week.[30] Lobster was also commonly served in prisons, much to the displeasure of inmates.[31] American lobster was initially deemed worthy only of being used as fertilizer or fish bait, and until well into the 20th century, it was not viewed as more than a low-priced canned staple food.

This did not work on comedy podcasts. Where the hosts make each other laugh out loud, or sometimes interrupt each other. Maybe it's because I'm not used to it but it was way too distracting and unsettling for me. 
He starts killing again in season 5. 

I gave up watching halfway through season 4 because it got so bad, but season 5 has become one of their best seasons. 


>I know several other people who have a similar setup. 

Again anecdotal evidence. 

I know a lot of people who didn't even know you could watch movies for free online. I just got a few co-workers into a site where they can stream movies and TV shows and they were blown away that you could do that. 

The average person is an idiot with computers, and most just watch stuff when it's available on Netflix/Hulu or HBO. 


I mean maybe a ton of people that you know, but that anecdotal evidence. I don't know anyone that has a fire stick, and only about half own a Chromecast. 

Personally I'll be seeing it in theaters and then at home the old pirate way a few weeks or so later when I want to rewatch. 
 
Oh I'm definitely a fan. What I was trying to point out is that he doesn't consider us that. Just fans. 

I'm a $20 patreoni because I'm a big fan of Dick, and it's the only way I can give back to someone who provides a shit ton of content. This podcast has the biggest fan engagement of any other podcast I listen to.  
One of the things I appreciate a lot about Dick was that he doesn't really call us "his fans." 

>Sean: All my fans…do you call the listeners “listeners”? Or “fans”? 

>Dick: “Listeners.” They're listeners. 

>Sean: Exactly, “fans” sounds really presumptuous and…yeah. All the “fans.” 

>Dick: I want to be all-inclusive. 

>Sean: Oh, all the fans, all my fans. Yeah, no, they're listeners, and they interact with us. 

>Dick: Alright…that's enough, we're done. Thanks, guys, thanks for listening.

I don't think you know what that means. 


But, if it makes you feel better about yourself, sure. That's exactly what happened.

No. But you apparently tried to.

Don't be a cunt.

My family is Mexican.
I can't be the only one thinking that's not an ER visit kind of injury.. 

Maybe it's just that my insurance is so shitty I won't go to the ER unless I'm missing a limb.
Season 5 made a huge comeback. 

Honestly if you made it that far start season 5. It's so good. 
And then you're paying $10 for an apple. 

Look at what happened to Georgia.

Right?! 

Latvia just hasn't been the same.
I've never had this happen before. 

I've streamed all their commentaries off the app, and whole albums too. 
They are. 

It's free to stream off the site, but if you want to download you gotta pay a dollar. 
Doesn't hurt the battery. 

I've had my OnePlus 3 since last June and haven't noticed any problems. A full charge gets me through the day, and if I need a charge I don't have to worry about time. 15 minutes gives me like 30%.
OnePlus DASH charging is incredible. 

I never worry about charging my phone anymore. 15-20 minutes plugged in and I'm good to go.
He cares about it. 

Dude's a billionaire with a blank check to do whatever he wants. Also Disney World is opening Avatar Land this summer. 



I played Arkham Knight on the lowest difficulty​ because I only wanted to finish the story. 

Plus my cousin only let me borrow his PS4 for a week. 
Every city has shitty traffic. 

I don't care about basketball.  

I'm not mad about the location. I'm mad that Texas isn't next. 
It's like 2 ½. But again. I don't want to go to Austin.
I worked for a party rental place that mostly did bounce houses. 

Worked Saturday and Sunday only. Got there at like 6am and ended at 10pm. 

First hour or two was spent loading the rolled up bounce houses on the trucks. Then we'd drive to the customers houses. I'd usually sleep during this time. 

When we had large events we had to stay there all day, I'd usually be on the rock wall. However if the event didn't start til late afternoon and we got there early I'd also take a nap in the ball pit. We would get free food and drinks, and whatever wasn't used at the end of the event. I remember the older guys taking cases or liquor home after really large events. 

It was super fun, and they paid me $150 a day. 
I never said it was good money, what I said it's not shit money. 

If the dude can live on his own, pay all his utilities and a car payment. They're not making shit money. That's what I'm trying to say. 


What if you drink expensive beer AND expensive water? 

Though I think "hipsters" have moved on to local brewery​ beer and cold brew coffee. 
I'll give​ you Scorpion King, but the Raimi Spider-Man movies had amazing CGI for the time. 

They also had a ton of amazing practical effects. [Doc Ock's arms are a great example.](https://youtu.be/kDY0WKvFwQ8) 
>I make a shit amount of money (31k a year)

That is not a shit amount of money. 

Unless you're living in a big city like NY or SF. 



 
He needs a new chair.
Sparkling water is the best. 

I mostly crave the bubbles in soda, and sparkling water fills that craving.

I don't really drink alcohol, and after work I'd usually drink a soda to wind down. Now I just get a large sparkling Voss water. 

Maybe it's because I'm Hispanic and drank Topo chico when I was growing up.
Maybe they don't have the money either? 

If he was a shitty husband then I can understand why they wouldn't want to go into debt to help him. 

If a shitty person gets sick they're still a shitty person that just happens to be sick. 

We gotta look on both sides of this. I'm all for helping people, but I gotta get the full story first before I give my money away.
Was hoping this would be in YouTube Red also like Lazer Team.

"Oh we never thought that."
I used to feel like my writing was shit. One time my friend was reading us papers from one of his classes. My god, some of them were terrible. This was also a class where everyone was an English major. 
Then your teacher does a search for plagiarism...
Who's to say. 

Avengers Infinity War might be a contender for number 1.

Force Awakens was something special. For many it was a sequel they've been wanting for over 30 years. It had all the nostalgia factors kicking in, and that trailer was incredible.  
I have no problem with weed mostly with the culture around it. 

Especially today. Where every co-worker over the age of 40 thinks they're cool for smoking and announcing it to the world, and everyone around my age making a big deal about it being 4/20. 

And good god if I say I don't smoke it. Some smokers take it kind of offensively when I say I don't partake. "Why not?" "Have you tried it?" "I bet you'd like it if you did."  
I gave up around this time last season. Took me a few months to finish out the last 5 episodes. 

Now I can't get enough. I need them!!
Thankfully I don't have a lot of paperwork and only paid like $36 to H&R Block.

I didn't have a return I paid the IRS $1. 

All and all I'm glad it was only a dollar. Compared to the $75 I paid last year. 
$1 for me. 


And lime. 

Or buy a bottle of Tajin.
Crimson Peak was Rated R, Del Toro just doesn't have that big of a pull.
I never said they don't? 

Did you not read my other comment?
Yes and no. 

When I think of the general population I think of the people who I work with. People who aren't gonna be interested in reading articles about filmmaking. 

People who dont even know about many of these "drama" films. They don't know about these mid budget movies coming out. Ask them if they know what A24 is. 

These are people who don't even know there's a drama film to watch at home. They're busy with work, kids or life in general. They know the giant Blockbusters because there's a commercial for one every hour, billboards all over the city, and countless other advertising for them. [You couldn't buy oranges without an Ad hitting you for Star Wars.](http://i.imgur.com/R2zYkAj.jpg)


You're saying it to the wrong demographic. 

The movie goer who browses r/movies is not the general public. 

That's who is making Marvel these billions of dollars. Movie studios invest millions into figuring out the largest target audience, because they're a business first. 
They can't hear you over those billions. 

You don't have to watch them. The originals are still there.
Nope, TX.

Did you save for like 6 months and not watch anything in between? 

Netflix isn't that expensive. 
I can only think of one reason why that scene worked for me and it's when Ronan asks "what are you doing?" His level of dumbfoundedness when Peter is singing and dancing like an idiot, it feels genuine. 


Imgur strips EXIF data. 
You know you can save the tickets, right? 


Am I the only one that doesn't really think this will be that entertaining? 

Drunk gameplays are fun because when you're drunk you can be loud and rowdy, perfect for these guys. 

Idk how they're all high, but in my mind it'll just become them sitting on the couch watching a movie or something.

I could be wrong, so who knows.
I got a laptop from 2011, cost me like $400. 

Have a OnePlus​ 3 and it beats it out of the water. 

If I have more than 3 Google chrome tabs open on the laptop it starts to lag. 

Would have never found Milked At Your Uncle's Farm without that advertising from Audible. 

That was hilarious.

http://introvertspring.com/comedians-depression-introversion/

>Comedians and introverts have a whole lot in common.  In fact, studies have shown that most comedians are introverts.  This makes sense when you consider how much time they spend observing and thinking (which can quickly lead to obsessing and over thinking). 

Also the fact that many comedians talk about their problems on stage. Bo Burnham comes to mind, especially with his ending of What. 

[Skip to 2:30](https://youtu.be/dQTZVnDE2Qw)

Have shit social skills because I'm an introvert, become more introverted because of shit social skills.

It's a vicious cycle. 
Sometimes I just want scrambled eggs with sliced fried hot dogs in them.    
Meh accidents happen, and when a phone is made of all metal it can get pretty slippery. I take good care of my phones, but I've dropped them by accident a few times, and a case won't protect everywhere. Was playing with my friends dog last year and my phone slipped out of my jacket pocket, it landed face down on top of a rock shattering the screen. 

However, you can't deny that most iPhone users have a cracked phone. You're one of the few that doesn't. 
It took years for Carlos to finally start getting affected by his joke theft.

>Plus based on the blur, we can already tell this wasn't shot on iPhone. 

Because iPhones automatically take better pictures? Or..?

The camera really doesn't have much to do with it as much as the person behind it. You probably wouldn't​be able to tell the difference in some pictures between my DSLR and my phone.
This is way different. 

If someone started posting my drawings or paintings online because they thought they were "Reddit worthy" I'd be pissed. It's an invasion of my privacy for one, and two, if I don't want to share a drawing I'm not going to. Also it might be something I'm not done with yet. 

I've started pieces and left them alone for months until I get another hit of inspiration to add more to it. 
I went in just expecting to get a Power Rangers movie. What I got was a very well directed, acted, and great looking movie. Some of those shots were great to look at. All that on top of a Power Rangers movie. 

For the first half it's just us getting to know the characters, and even if they never morphed it would have a very enjoyable movie. One if the best origin stories since Iron Man. 
I wouldn't call something I can do on my toilet social interaction.

We're on an online forum..

Man, I miss my old 93 Chevy. It was my first car given to me by my dad. Dark green, lifted with nice big all terrain tires, and the Chevy logo decaled to be the Texas flag.(I'm Hispanic btw, I know this comment comes off as a white country stereotype​, but I just loved that decal.) 

I love my new car, but it's not built like that truck. Needs something fixed every year or so. 


All this is opinionated though. What you don't hype up, someone else does. 

I had immense hype for Logan and it lived up to it, same for Deadpool. 

It just seems like you don't like the X-Men movies, but X-Men 1 and 2 are two movies that lived up to a lot of hype and kicked off the superhero genre. Just because you didn't like them doesn't mean they're bad movies.  
I love their sparkling water though. I drink about 3-4 a week. I work in a high end restaurant and can grab one at the end of my shift. 

Awesome thank you. 

So all I gotta do is tell them about the recall, and they'll fix it for free? 

Sorry for the dumb questions, I know nothing about cars.
Thank you!! 

Also.

What dealership would I go to? 

I bought this car from a used car lot place a couple years ago. 
That happens even with non R-rated movies. Just look at most of the crap that comes out on January. 

Dredd is a British Comic book, who most people only remember as that shitty Stallone movie. It's not the biggest property out there, and before 2012 no one was asking for a Dredd movie. 
No I get it. I was making a joke.

But you could also say the same about Logan. They wanted the children's DNA to control their powers. Hell they had already changed the world by putting stuff in the food to stop mutants from being born. 
Ant-Man kind of. 

The final battle took place in a little girls bedroom. On her toy train set. How much smaller can you get?

Dredd, since they basically treated the movie as "just another Tuesday for Judge Dredd." 
Gonna check this out tonight.
Good to have both on my OnePlus 3.
I don't think it had the most character and personality, but I did enjoy it a lot. 

However it dragged on so much towards the last half. The show suffered after a certain character was gone. 
Dick needs to hire Smart Mark to be his audio engineer.

This is pretty much me with every major Blockbuster of the past 2 years. 

IMAX has ruined watching those movies at home. 
I think this is mostly calling out the people who are proud of their scars and want to show them off. 

Only time I've ever felt the need to show one off was when some other asshole wasn't watching what he was doing, and he touched the side of my arm with the bottom of a straight off the fire pan. 
Right? 

It's child humor at this point. Which is funny. Maddox goes on and on about how much he hates children, yet those have to be pretty much the only fans he has left, so he pretty much has to cater to them.
Dick, I'm so glad you don't do any stupid sound drops in your show. 

I finished re-listening to TBPITU last week, and the sound drops got so annoying towards the middle. 

The only time they ever made me laugh was when sæn couldn't care about the drum roll. 
Your last point. Not calling you out personally, but rather people who do this in general. 

Why do you guys not check if you have money on you? I can't go to a store without checking my wallet at least 3 times. 
Why? 

I hadn't seen it before. 
You sound crazy. No ride ever existed.

He grew on me. His bonus episode was perfect. Dick isn't lying when he said he just ended up listening to the whole thing. You can't stop, it's just hilarious. 

Also I think Dick needs to hire Smart Mark to fix the audio issues with the podcasts.

Yessir. Houston.
I forgot to get in n out when I was in Vegas last year, so I can't compare.

Would Devotchka be fully gypsy punk? 

They've been my one of my favorite bands for the past decade, but I've always told people they're more of an indie folk/punk. 

Also I'd like to recommend The Freak Fandango Orchestra. They were highly influenced by Gogol Bordello, and you can hear it right away. 
$20 a month. Usually the payment goes through on the first of the month. 

You can pay only once if you want and it gives you access to everything that's been posted in the past on their Patreon. I started out with the $5 a month for the bonus episodes, but then moved up to $20 to have access to the live streams. 
I don't live in California. 

Like I said, I have a decent salary where I'm at currently. I mean, I'm able to be one of the $20 Patreonis and not even think twice about it. 

However I do plan on leaving the industry to pursue a different passion in life. Burning out of the kitchen life. 
We have to account for human error in the video. As he said maybe the barista gave him some extra stuff in his drink, the guy saying the muffin was healthy was just trying to make a sale, and the vegan sandwich is because someone at the store said it's vegan and healthy and probably that many calories.

But things you buy like sliced bread or peanut butter have been tested already, especially big brands. All it would take is one scientist to test a bottle of Coke, and if it's not the calories it says on the can then Coke would be in trouble. Those big companies spend millions figuring out every last molecule of their food. So when a bottle says x amount equals this many calories I usually believe them.

Eating less definitely helps, but doesn't hurt to know calorie intake matters a lot too. 

[Take this guy who lost 60lbs eating nothing but McDonald's.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.businessinsider.com/how-to-lose-weight-eating-only-mcdonalds-2015-10)
How'd you find them?
I agree, but also sometimes people forget how many calories certain things have. 

Like peanut butter. You can say "oh I only had a peanut butter sandwich for lunch." But how much peanut butter did you put on there. A tablespoon has around 100 calories, and let's face it, you're loading up that sandwich with peanut butter. 

So let's say you put 5-6 tablespoons of peanut butter. You're at 600~ calories. Then the two pieces of bread. 80-100 calories per slice. That's an 800 calorie sandwich. Unless you're​ eating with water then add the calories for whatever you ate that sandwich with, let's say milk? You're eating healthy so you bought 1%. That's about 100 calories a cup. So averaging maybe two cups of milk in that glass. 

That small lunch was roughly 1000 calories. Which is a lot. 

Counting calories isn't too hard if you use MyFitnessPal, it does it for you and it lets you know if you went over or under your daily goals.
It's really really rare for a restaurant to do shared tips. 


Any professional cook would tell you, we do it for the passion. 

We do enjoy cooking and we like making great food for people. That's pretty much our incentive to put out the best food. I actually am lucky to work at a place that actually gives me a decent salary, but many of the big celebrity chef owned restaurants pay shit. I knew a guy who worked at one of the nicest sushi restaurants in my city and he only made $13/hr. 
I'm a cook at a semi fine dining restaurant, and I fucking hate tipping. 

The servers at my place walk out with $3-400 a night on Friday and Saturday, but still the complaining of "I only make $2.50 an hour." It's bullshit. 

I've even heard one say one time "I only made $250 tonight." ONLY $250?! FUCK YOU. She had only been there for 5 hours too. 

But I still gotta tip, otherwise I'm an asshole. And that's what makes me a rage.   
My OnePlus 3 has such a fast fingerprint scanner.

However it has double tap to wake the screen. I think every phone should have this feature.

Oh man I remember one guy telling us he was going to pass out if he didn't eat some lunch. 

Had fun with that line for a while.

Shit. I didn't see someone make the same comment below. Just like Mitch Hedberg said "I need to read faster."  
Unless you're Henkel or Shun. 

We love our knives.
Thanks for the tips! 

However not in school, we're 25 so at this point it might be a bit too late. Way too many responsibilities. 

I'll just keep going back every October for the rest of my life. 
Oh I was talking about age. The OP said that's when he got his license, that's why I said that's when a lot of us got our phones. I was 15 in 2007.

I know it was a thing, but I don't think it was that big of a thing to text people. My first phone plan didn't even have unlimited texting. 


Edit: 

>As of 2007 text messaging was the most widely used mobile data service, with 74% of all mobile phone users worldwide, or 2.4 billion out of 3.3 billion phone subscribers, at the end of 2007 being active users of the Short Message Service. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging
That's when a lot of us started to get cell phones though. 

I can't remember anyone before 2006 regularly texting. 
Safety. 
I hate The Flash sometimes for this. In one episode Barry will be fast enough to see bullets fly in slow motion, and the next episode or hell even scene he's getting punched in the face, or just watches the NON SPEEDSTER run away. Cisco could just make him indestructible zip ties and Barry can just put them on the bad guy before they can even blink. 

But this is why I'm not writing these shows.  
Houston here. 

We never get shit. 
What about Disney? 

My friend and I have thought about just moving to Orlando and working for Disney or Universal. 

We go every year to Halloween Horror Nights, what an experience. 
I'm one of the few.

Still don't smoke or do any drugs. Occasionally socially drink, but other than that I couldn't care any less for drugs.  
Right? They had a huge choose your side campaign going on. 


It also came out during Valentine's Day weekend. So tons of couples going out to dinner and a movie.

Your grammar is not the best, and we need to aim for the best, remember? Those are your words. 

It's Picasso for one, and Banksy is highly successful, so successful that even you can spell his name right.

I'll just leave it at this. You've completely have done a 180 from your original comment. Going from we need to only strive for the best to "let the bad doctors in." Shows how much you stick to your views, and how easily manipulated you can be. 
You're trying to tell me to reach for the best, yet your  grammar is atrocious. Maybe you should go back to school and learn how to properly structure a sentence. 

One of the biggest reasons people don't go on to become doctors is because it costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, and not everyone wants to be in school for 8-9 years either. Many people make way more money and impacts on life than doctors. Are they not needed? No, but other careers exist that do way more than doctors. 

And some people just aren't cut out for that field anyway. Like you. You'd run the risk of misspelling a prescription and killing a patient. 

Keep on with those insults, they match the education of your grammar.
Oh boy here we go. 

You realize I said I agreed with you at the beginning, but what I'm trying to say is that they're two very different jobs. I'm not saying they're equal, but being a nurse takes a ton of knowledge. Do you honestly believe that anyone off the street can come and do all those medical tests they do? In fact they do a lot more than a doctor in a hospital, doctors handle more paperwork than actual physical stuff with a patient. Honestly, out of both of us you belong in the the_donald, seeing as how you're the one who's judging someone without even knowing what they do, and not realizing that there's differences between people. 

Also it's they're. Welcome to the internet, kid. 
Yeah, now you're just coming off as a condescending prick. 

Are you serious dude? 

I make enough money to support myself and my hobbies, and my future career I want to get into will just pay even more, and you're making wild accusations about my situations and others? 

Do me a favor and just don't reply to this comment anymore, as you obviously have no more to add to this conversation without reaching for your own narrative.
See I would agree with you, but you're still kinda sounding like you think nurses are inferior. 

I get what you're trying to say, but at the same time people should be allowed to do what they want. I don't plan on going into the medical field. In fact my dream career is in the art field, which a lot of people still look down on, but I'm still trying to get out there.
What's wrong with being a nurse? 

They work harder than doctors and frankly are more responsible for patients than doctors. It's up to the doctor to prescribe you stuff and diagnose, and yes that's very important, but a hospital is nothing without nurses. 

I'm not one, but one of my friends is currently in school to become one and he's busting his ass learning everything he can. 
 
The one by me became a Star Cinema Grill. 
Dude this is amazing.
You can't really compare Sarah Silverman and Patton Oswalt to Maddox. They're multimillionaires with huge careers. So they said some ultra PC SJW Tumblrina crap. They're still making millions. Your video was great but limped a bit at the end. They don't need any advice on their comedy.
Kubrick didn't write it originally with Spielberg in mind but her felt he was better at directing this sort of film, especially with all the special effects it was going to require. 

>Stanley actually said to Spielberg: 'You would be the best guy to direct this film, I'll be the producer.'

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/film/2000/may/05/1
>that place is already a shit hole. 

Ah yes. The argument of I know nothing about it, but I'll insult it to make my statement look better.
They're not telling people to jump the border, and it's not like they can just chain up every citizen to prevent them from doing so. 

They just wanted a better life in a world with a better economy. Kind of like how everyone has wanted since you know, America was founded. What did they call that? The American Dream. 

And it was a whole lot easier to get into the country back then too. Just get off the boat sign a paper saying that yeah, I'm from this country, here's my name and date of birth. I can only assume they didn't have some sort of electronic verification. 
Well, when they comment "life sucks :(" maybe it's time to re think life?   
I'm just comparing areas and prices, where my city everything "cool" is close to downtown. So living by that area runs you $1000+ a month, unless you want to live in a bad neighborhood. 

Columbus is still cheap no matter where you live. Compared to California especially. 
He thought it was a service to buy DVDs and Blu Rays from. 
So move? 

Tons of different cities that have a great cost of living. 

My girlfriend's from Columbus, and downtown apartments are like $8-900 a month. I couldn't believe it. 
Yep, and Steven Spielberg made it all happen as he had pretty much worked with all those studios. 
You're getting Downvotes because your comment basically reads as a "ruined my childhood" statement.

The original is still there, no matter how bad the sequel is, you can just ignore it and never watch it.  

Also to answer your why question. Money. That's literally the only reason. Go see how much money Split made compared to its budget. Movies are basically a business first. Like it or not, money is what makes them happen. 
I know, but we're in the Houston subreddit, and you're telling someone to move to a different city just to have something to do in the suburbs.
Yeah but then you'd have to be in Ohio. 

In all seriousness, my girlfriend's in Columbus, and the city is a lot smaller than Houston. She was surprised the Houston Zoo was almost an hour away,  and how much driving we did.
Are you sure you graduated highschool?

I agree. And that's the beauty of Android, we have those options. 
I never said those features shouldn't exist, this whole thing started because you were complaining about having to move your finger a whole inch to use the front fingerprint sensor. I stated that it wasn't difficult because I have those features and they have no affect on how I unlock my phone. 


6' here. 

My parents are like 5'4" 
Uh if you're using an S3 GET A NEW ONE. It's 5 years old. 

I get a new phone every year and a half. 

And the OnePlus 3 has one of the fastest fingerprint sensors I've used. 

Your analogy is stupid. Here's a better one. Your entire argument is like someone putting a $100 bill next to you, but you're saying "now I have to reach and get it? Why didn't they just put it in my hand, it's more convenient. I'm not gonna grab it."  
Holy hell dude... You're moving your finger an inch or two, it's not that hard to do. 

I have a OnePlus 3, front fingerprint sensor and double tap to wake. Right now I prefer this method. I have both thumbs and index fingers registered, never had an issue unlocking my phone. 

Also by the way, you can set it to unlock using the sides of your fingers too, not just the actual print. And I'm pretty sure there's an old post here of a guy registering a whole bunch of his body parts, and it worked.  
The human manifestation of "keep Austin weird."
I'm pretty sure this is why it's the best kind of satire. 

Also as a cook and photography/video hobbyist it's not easy getting shots like that, lighting and cinematography are on point. 


Chef's name is also named Jeff. I call him Cheffrie. 
Wrong. 

Gringo is what Hispanics call white people. While not a slur it's mostly said in a negative manner when referring to someone who's white. If they're talking about a white person(or someone with light skin) in a non negative tone they'll mostly likely say Guero.

Also a black person is mostly called Moreno.  
Take financial advise from someone who knows they'll be declined for a credit card... 
It's been said to death, but goddamn they blew a perfect mini series. 


Yeah, but not a lot of people know what happened in real life either. Like me. 

It's like saying that spoilers don't matter for a movie based on a book. 
My phone has USB type C and man do I love it. Best part is there's no up or down on it, so you don't have to do the flip the cable dance 

Many phone manufacturers are going with USB type C now. Google's phones began to use it, Motorola is too, and Samsung is probably gonna follow suit. The only reason why micro USB became standard was because of every phone out there using it. Except apple. Even Nintendo's new console has USB type C. 
He better, I want one.
And this is why you'll be soon replaced by a phone or tablet. 

Chili's or whatever chain restaurant it is has tablets on the tables that you can order and pay from. Can't wait for the day that I can go into a restaurant and not have to talk to anyone. 


People born in 1999 are 18 now.
Almost 3 hours if you have the extended collector's edition. 

I used to play it in the background all the time a long time ago. Have probably "seen" it close to 50 times.    
Saw it during the road show in 70mm, Blu Ray won't be the same. 
I pay $20 for the live streams, since sometimes you get to witness something that gets edited out of the show. Like this last episode with the audio issues. 

But yeah, I'd like to get more with how much I give. An extra half hour show of just voicemail like someone had suggested a while back, or something else. Dick start a twitch channel and draw Sonic or Mario. 
Movie studios are a business. They only care about the money first. It's why we get a horror movie every month of the year. Cheap to make and they bring in a lot of money. 
What's great about this is that they couldn't get the rights back to show what happened in the first movie, so they just basically remade the first movie within the first 5 minutes to catch the story up. If you watch The Evil Dead, right as the monster gets the jump on Ash at the end the second movie begins. There's an interview of Bruce Campbell talking about that. 
Everyone tries to emulate Dick's rage style, especially with how he describes things, and they all suck at it. 


Photography. 

Took it up earlier this year, pretty fun once you actually get some decent pictures and want to get better. 

Plus girls dig it. 
Well, it's 3am, just got home from the bar. Guess I'm installing iTunes.  
Why not read the article?
Now THAT is a rare find. 
They took it to go. $1 tip.
It's honestly not that bad. 

Or maybe I'm just desensitized to it. Seen Green Room about 4 times now. It's is very intense the first time you watch it don't get me wrong, but going back I get to appreciate more of the world building they establish in the background. 

Also why no going back to City of God. Such a beautifully made film. 
So basically, hitting the water won't kill you, it's the not being able to swim from the injuries that will.

Oh wait, no. Gotta pay for your own half. I'll provide some road snacks though.
The Biggest Problem in the Universe: Two hosts bring in a problem and they discuss/argue why theirs is the biggest problem. Then fans would vote on which problem was the winner and they discuss it at the beginning the next episode. It's one of the funniest podcasts that I've listened to. They would play fan voicemails and read comments that would shit on them. The hosts had a falling out and the show ended after 107 episodes. Which leads into my next podcast. 

The Dick Show: Co-Host of The Biggest Problem in the Universe, Dick Masterson went on to create his own podcast The Dick Show. Hilarious person, and IMHO wouldn't recommend you listen to this show until you finish The Biggest Problem. The show is much better when you get to know his character, and he addresses a lot of behind the scenes stuff of that other podcast. Especially why it ended.

We Hate Movies: 3-4 hosts discuss one bad movie adding their own style of improv along with their commentary. They all have great voice imitations. Highly recommended their BvS and Anaconda episodes. 

The Cracked Podcast: Topics can range from movie trivia, historical stories, paranormal, politics, etc. I'd say look through their episodes and pick out ones with titles that seem interesting to you. 


Lore: Host brings in an urban legend and dives deep into what could be the truth behind them.

How Did This Get Made: Similar to We Hate Movies, the hosts talk about a movie that they can make fun of. Highly recommend their Fast and Furious episodes. Show can be found on YouTube btw.
Was in an Xperia X10? 

I had one and it had it on the top right covered by a flap. 
Only to get Indy killed by his son. 
Amazon is not Netflix.

And it still airs on USA. Amazon bought the streaming rights for it. 
Nope. 

USA renewed it for season 3 halfway through 2. 

One of my favorite shows.
It's so crazy seeing this stuff. 

I live in upper Northwest Houston, close to the Tomball area.

Our power was back on a couple days later, and nothing around our area was damaged. Houston is a huge city, I never knew how badly some parts got hit.

Lots of drinking and masturbating.
I'm not carrying my water heater in my pocket all day. 

Phones are a lot more than appliances. 

When you call someone for tech support they ask for the brand because they all have different settings. 

 You can't throw someone a Honda Civic manual, and tell them to use that to fix their Tesla. It's just a car, right?
Watch any horror movie on opening weekend in a black neighborhood. 

Watched Paranormal Activity 3 midnight at a theater by one. Was the best. 

Watched Django Unchained there too at midnight and it was a hoot. 
He does what he loves. 

Most comedians don't get into comedy for the money. 
It might have worked if we saw them actually argue. 

The live show sucked because they scripted it, and made it seem like a talk show rather than what the podcast is; an argument about problems. 

An hour of Dick an Maddox sitting across a table from each other brining in stats, guests or props would have been kind of fun. The fun of the podcast was when they each got angry at one another, and that was missing from the live show. 

Also Shæn wasn't there.
So why is The Butterfly Effect ranked higher. 

In prison in order to make a point or whatever he goes back to his childhood while in class. He goes up to his teacher's desk and stabs both his hands through a metal rod. When he gets out of his little loop thing scars have appeared on his hands. Wouldn't those scars be there all his life. Yet the other prisoners react like they appeared out of nowhere. 

Also for a movie with the premise that one little change in the past can alter the future in huge ways. Stabbing his hands had no effect at all on his life.  
Made the mistake of buying Who Framed Roger Rabbit like this. Looks so off in the collection.
What gear did you use? 

Great tracking shots.
I guess I should be proud that none of these describe me. 

I've pretty much limited my cursing. Now it's just deep inhales and a second of eyes closed to suppress the rage. 
Got any mild air?
Dick's patreonis got deeper pockets. 
YouTube has tons of audiobooks. 

Just type audiobook into YouTube and I'm sure there's gonna be a book in there you'll like.
Google let's you invite whoever you want. 

Also has the added benefit of YouTube Red included with your subscription. And that can't be beat. YouTube turns into a music streaming device, with tons of unknown artist being on there. Plus audiobooks. 
The Dick Show: $20 

Mr Sunday Movies: $5 


https://youtu.be/Te8rNaLAz4o
They sell those cassette adapters at Walgreens dude.
IMAX doesn't even mean shot in IMAX anymore. 

Just means larger screen, and charging more money for the "premium". 

Personally I don't mind, because if I can see it in the largest screen possible then why not.
It's a set. 

When they go outside they cut and wrap shooting for the day, until they go to the building location for the outdoor shoots.
And just like Dash charging, you don't need much time either.
Show creator said they didn't try to keep a mistery about Mr. Robot's real identity. 

https://www.google.com/amp/ew.com/article/2015/09/03/mr-robot-sam-esmail-fight-club-inspiration-finale/amp/ 

He first imagined Mr Robot as a movie. And season one is basically the first act of that movie. 
Pucker that butthole! 


Hot Goss goes back for years. I'd say go back and listen to TBPITU. I've been re-listening to it, and it's still just as good.

I work in a fine dining restaurant, and servers here walk out with $3-500 a night. A NIGHT. And yes I understand my restaurant is not the average, but I've known multiple people that have worked at chain restaurants and they said they would walk out with $1-200. 
Eh you don't need quality supplies. 

My favorite pens to draw with are the cheap Bic pens that come in a pack of 20 for a few bucks. 

Same argument can apply to photography as well. Don't need a 5 thousand dollar camera to take great pictures.  

People give up because they don't want to put in the time to become better. I didn't have a lot of money growing up. Sometimes all I had was the cheap dollar store art supplies. They didn't make me want to stop drawing.
Spend a summer in Houston. 

Sitting by a fire in a 100 degree weather, with 100% humidity, at night! Not very comfortable. 

Our winters don't get under 30, so being by a fire is perfect.

Not only Facebook does this, but Google too. 

The other day I was talking with my chef about truffle oil. Few hours later I get a Google Opinion Rewards question asking if I've foraged for truffles and if I'm into fine dining. 

Freaked me out a bit. 
Not a lot of mountains in Texas. 

 
Never have heard people in Texas call them something other than pork rinds. 

Chicharrones can mean two different things for Hispanics. They can mean the regular pork rinds, or fried pork belly which has a good amount of meat. 

Source: Am Mexican. Been eating chicharrones all my life.
Don't think so. 

You're probably thinking of Droog which means friend in Russian/Nadsat.
Excited that this is playing at my local IMAX. However I definitely know its a digital one, didn't realize it would play in those.
https://youtu.be/Qezms0nOJps
Also people like me sometimes just don't know enough about it to give our two cents. 

I only got into photography about 8 months ago, so I still have a ton to learn. Going into threads where it's pros, or people that really know their stuff going on about gear or techniques. I can't really join in. I learn a lot, but my advice is not needed at all. 
I'm sure Disney will hear you over all that money they're making. 
Her dialogue was fucking atrocious. 

"Harley Quinn, nice to meet cha. Love your perfume, what is that? Stench of death?"  

I watched this movie at home and I wanted to walk out. I even went in with low expectations and it was just bad.   
Pretty sure that logic could apply everywhere..

>The national minimum wage is currently $17.70 per hour or $672.70 per 38 hour week (before tax).


So they were making minimum wage. 

Also sounds like a lot, but cost of living in Australia is pretty high. Everything costs more. 
 
It feels weird knowing James' last name now...
So you had a sample of a few 22 year olds, and you gathered that no one below 35 knows about those movies? I just turned 25.. I'm in that age range. Spider-Man 2 is still my favorite superhero movie.

Also the tune is from the 60's. And it has [millions of views on YouTube.](https://youtu.be/SUtziaZlDeE) Not to mention the song being spoofed by [The Simpsons Movie.](https://youtu.be/714-Ioa4XQw) Also being covered by [The Ramones.](https://youtu.be/i5P8lrgBtcU) 

You can't deny that it's a great tune that's easy to remember. 
 

Go out in the streets and ask a random person to sing you a super hero theme. Bet you they'll sing the classic Spider-Man song. 

I get that now Iron Man is a huge deal, but Spider-Man has been hugely popular for decades.

Also they pay RDJ $50 million a movie because he's smart and negotiated to get a percentage of the box-office gross. 

And I'm not trying to say Iron Man is not popular. I'm just saying that Spider-Man is also a household name that doesn't need to ride on someone elses coat tails to be successful.
Spider-Man is the most recognized super hero in the world, next to Batman and Superman.

I know people who weren't that interested in Civil War until Spider-Man showed up in the trailer. People like my dad. His favorite superhero is Spider-Man.

I got into photography earlier this year.. that DSLR man.. 
I actually never went to Draft House in Vintage. So I can't compare. 

But Santikos is a really great theater. They have a full bar, and menu. They don't bring your food to you restaurant style though. They recently put in those large reclining seats. Screen are big, plus an IMAX screen. 

Also huge plus(mainly for me), unlike AMC there aren't a bunch of smaller stores for people to linger around outside, which means less teenagers. 
Same, but it wasn't until my friend told me a month ago.   
I can't be the only one that prefers Santikos Silverado.

Gonna release with Rogue One apparently.
I can't be the only one that unwinds without alcohol. Sparkling water and Netflix. Have never felt the need to drink after a shift.

All I need is a large Voss sparkling water and I'm good for the night. 
Have you seen Birdman?

Same director. Entire movie is shot to look like it's one continuous long shot and it's incredible. 

 Also Gravity. Different director though, but amazing long shots.

Mexican directors love their long shots.  
You should check out Reddit is Fun. Probably the best UI for comments out there IMO.

I used to use Spotify, but after GPM I can't go back. It's been 4 years, and I have yet to find songs that aren't on GM. Usually I can find them in YouTube though.

And like I said, paying the same price for the same service, but with the added benefit of YouTube Red just makes it better.  
I only think it's better due to the added benefit of having YouTube Red. 

As for the music on Google Play, I can't say how the libraries differ. So far I've found everything I wanted on GP. Haven't used Spotify in like 4 years. They also recently added podcasts to GP. 

But YouTube also has a ton of music, so you could always make a playlist there and play it in the background. 
Wait, you have to live in the same address? 

One of the reasons I love Google Play Music is that it's $15 for 6 people, and all you have to do is sign in with your separate accounts through the invite the account holder sends, and that's it. 

It also includes YouTube Red with the subscription. Which I honestly can't go back to not having. No ads, background play, and downloading videos for offline play.
It's Funhaus. They each only own like 5 shirts. 
That bothered me a lot too. 

Also when he left Moana on the island after they met.. did he leave her there to die?


Am Mexican. 

You shut your goddamn mouth about Taco Cabana. 

When I was in Mexico. My aunt owned a butcher shop where most of the animals that were raised in our farm ended up. My grandma made tortillas in her outdoor kitchen from scratch. Ground up her own corn for the Masa. Had her own garden where all the vegetables and herbs came from for her salsas. She cooked pretty much all day, because it's what she loved to do. Don't talk to me about good authentic Mexican food. I've had it. 

But goddamn I love Taco Cabana.
I'd say watch the first episode of season 5 and if you're not hooked again then stop watching. 

It's leagues ahead of season 3 and especially 4. Oliver kills again. Which honestly makes him more interesting.
We had it on version 10.12.24 and removed it on version 10.12.25.

I have never once heard this in my life. 

Yet everybody on Reddit somehow thinks everyone in the south is just a passive aggressive asshole.
A few months ago I was driving through a large neighborhood that has a large park and golf course in it. When all of a sudden a large deer jumps in front of me. I slam on the brakes and come within a foot of hitting it. Then half a second later the other deer that was running besides that one hits the side of my car. It's scary as fuck, and you don't realize how much force they can hit with. 

 
[Take your pick.](http://www.irishcentral.com/roots/how-many-dublins-are-there-in-america) 

My girlfriend used to live in Dublin Ohio.
He said in his first comment he wasn't try to kill her, and the movie does frame it very well in how much physical pain he's in. Plus we had seen earlier in the movie how powerful Chewies bowcaster was. It sent troopers flying backwards. 

Also throughout the entire movie Rey carried a staff, and we saw she knew how to use it when she beat those guys trying to steal BB8. And while it's no lightsaber we can assume she at least knows how to use a stick like weapon.  
But I'm not a photographer. It's just my hobby. 

So me buying a new lens is a luxury, because no one expects me to have the greatest gear. But I want it anyway.
Since when did having no disposable income mean you can't afford anything. That just means you don't have money left over after you pay all your bills. And many people wouldn't go without internet now. It's a necessity. 

For ~$50 a month you can get so much for free. 
Because it's free.
It's fun. 

My friend and I hang out every Thanksgiving night. We go get coffee and then walk to best buy. 

It's not even that bad anymore. Stores open way earlier now, and most won't let you just storm the store. They have you line up and only let in a few people at a time when it opens. 

At least that's how they've been doing it in my area for a few years now.
I must be the Mexican 1%. Turkey, Ham, Tamales, and carne asada.
It's not Netflix's call on this. It's the rights holder. 

So when the contract expires, the rights holder can choose to charge Netflix more money to renew it. With popular shows like this FOX can try to extort more money, or Netflix could drop that money on an original show that they own forever. 

And while you may be willing to pay more for some of your favorites to come back, other people might not be. Remember when Netflix raised its price by like $2. That pissed some people off.  

Also if you honestly loved the show that much, support it by buying the DVDs. Also there are other ways to watch the show online.. 
We close at 10. Apparently a 2 top was sat at around 9:55. No one told us. 

We had been dead for the last hour so everything was clean, wrapped up and it was basically a wait til the clock strikes ten so we can go. At 9:59 I get rid of all the sauces that we make fresh every day. 

Ticket gets rung up at 10:01 and owner says we gotta make it since the table came in before close. Kill me.
Just not worth arguing this anymore. Plus it's ironic how you claim to be very educated yet keep making grammatical errors. 

I'm done with this. You have a good day. ✌
Good one buddy. 

It's even funnier with your bad grammar. 
I think you should do some research on why certain areas are like that. Some of them lack proper funding for their school, and some people are raised to certain values that they can't help. You're generalizing a whole group of people without trying to understand why they're like that. But hey, at least you got something in common now. 
And based on your experience you know everything about it the south, right? 

I get that a large portion of it lacks proper education, but that doesn't mean the entire south is uneducated. You understand that, right? 


Tons of cities to live in that do not fit your description of the "south".

First of all. You answered none of his questions. I'm someone who's not white, I've lived in Texas all my life and have never experienced racism. As for education, there's tons of universities in many southern states that are highly ranked. 

Also Houston having the largest medical center in the world, and mission control. 

Seems like a lot of people like you from "up north" are a lot more more bigoted. 
Probably didn't help that a lot of people didn't see it based on a ton of negative reviews. 

Also compare to the running times. BvS had a two and a half hour running time, versus Ant-Man which was two hours. BvS had less showings in a day compared to Ant-Man. 
Sounds like something that someone from Dallas would say. 
It's been getting down to like 55 the past few days here in Houston. 

Supposed to hit high 30's this weekend. 
Have you asked for the day off for a game and gotten hazed for it before? Or are you just making up your own scenarios in your head. 

I've asked for nights off to go see movie premieres before. Gotten teased for it, but so what? I asked for the day off, what does it matter what I do with it. 


Same. I used to love Swiftkey. I bought it like 4 times.(twice for my accounts and then my cousin and mom) I would install it on all my friends phones. Then they kept adding more and more features that made it slower or laggy. And finally they went free with micro transactions. So if I was gonna use a free keyboard why not give Google a try. 
Hey guys, remember me? Waiter that used to work here two years ago? Mind if I stop and chit chat with you guys, front of house seems a little busy right now. 
Why didn't Ragman stay behind. Dude is bulletproof. And he already has beaten up Church before. He threw him across the room when he was beating Oliver up before he got recruited. 

Sometimes the plot devices of the show make no sense. 
After a bit they honestly do. 

When you open them they do have that distinct flavor and smell, but then it dissipates. Leaving me with that beery aftertaste that pretty much all beers I've tried have. 
Like how pretty much every device out before 2015 used micro USB. Except some little company that kept their devices with a lighting port. 

And a lot of new Android phones now use USB-C. And this same little company keeps their lighting ports on their phones  thus making the whole dongle fiasco. 
What is it with people and saying "well you just gotta find the right beer." Do I **have** to drink beer? 

I'm 25, I've never drank bud light, Miller, or any of those other "shitty" beers. But have tried many different brews. They all taste the same to be honest. I've pretty much only have liked two beers, Stella and Shiner Bock. But even then they still taste like the rest. 


Had never heard of that before. 


The wife of that other guy in the Christmas special sang it during karaoke. 
For me it has to be The Flash. 

They gave us King Shark and Gorilla Grodd. 

TV CGI has come a long way. 
His videos have millions of views dude... 


Gotta time it right. 

My friend and I did all 9 haunted houses in just 3 hours yesterday. By 9pm we did the Krampus one more time since it was the only house with a wait time under 30 minutes. 

Today we did our 6 favorites in under 2 hours.


That's how it normally is. 

Also October is a huge month for them due to Halloween Horror Nights. I'm making this comment while waiting in a line at Universal. 

Haunted houses have 100+ minute wait times.
Maintaining a perfect speed limit the whole time you drive is nearly impossible though. 

Going 55.2 on a 55 is technically illegal then too if you want to be pedantic.

I was always under the impression that there was a buffer zone of ~5mph. Since I've driven by or past police officers going 3+mph over the speed limit multiple times.

I've been using this lens for about a month. And I think it's good as a walk around lens, especially for a beginner. I was able to get out of the habit of always having a zoom, and have gotten some (IMO) really nice shots from it. 

Took it to fright fest last weekend, and had a blast shooting in low light. Got me a new wallpaper too. 
I started telling a few of my friends the wrong times on purpose. 

Movie's at 8? I tell them 7:45. Works out fine. 

And to anyone who thinks this is me being an asshole, they all know I do this. We're friends, and little stuff like this isn't gonna make us stop being friends. I've been doing it for 6 years, we joke about it. 
Yes, pick one part of my sentence and not read anything else. 

>they don't want to set up any more settings on their phones

This is why it's faster for them. 

My friend just plugs his phone in and it automatically plays his Spotify without even unlocking the phone. So yeah, a little faster. 

For me personally, I own Bluetooth headphones, I'm buying a new car soon and you bet it'll have Bluetooth capabilities. But I still own a 3rd generation iPod nano that I keep in my car. So I'm still a firm believer in the aux port.
I'd like to see your statistics on that. 

Because almost everyone out of my friends group, ages 21-25 wants nothing but an aux port in their car. 

3 of them have Bluetooth car stereos, but still prefer to plug in the aux port because it's faster for them. And more than half own iPhones. 

They own iPhones because they don't want to set up any more settings on their phones, they just want it working out of the box. One of them didn't even know how to connect his car to his phone. 
Yeah, but will anyone miss them?
Where the hell do you live that a $10,000 car comes with luxury extras? I'm looking to buy a new car in the next few months and $18,000 is basically my starting point..

Also aren't all cars technically "brand name"? I've never seen a Ferd or Chevo around.. 
My test only involved doing it once. They have a spot behind the DMV that has a pole at the front and back of the spot. 

I haven't paralleled parked since.. even when I go downtown I'm able to find a spot, or sometimes I just pay for parking. I live out in the suburbs where it's an ocean of parking lots.
Never think that taking a picture of a tragedy is wrong. It shows people just how powerful these storms can be. Just like with war photographers. 

So that when someone says "yeah, how bad could it be." You could pull up one of those pictures. 

Living in Houston, I remember seeing all the damage Katrina caused, and it made everyone evacuate when Rita came.  
Even if the studio put it out on blu ray they'd lose money on it. 

While a good chunk of people will buy it, it won't sell thousands of copies. 

And even if they did a special limited blu ray release, we'd end up right back here again. 
Well at least now I can finish the season. I made it up until the last 4 or 5 episodes before I gave up. But being the completist I am about shows I gotta watch every episode. 
For every one that's like that there's another family that gets their kids everything. 

At my highschool the student parking had nicer cars than the teachers lot. 
That's why most get fast food. 

Also they get hour lunch breaks. 

I worked with my uncle doing construction one summer in highschool. Never had so much fast food breakfast in my life. 


It's a little bit racist. 

While implying that white people know nothing about Mexican food, he's also kinda saying that only Mexicans are construction workers, lawn care worker, and apparently waiters. 

Edit: I am Mexican myself, I have worked construction with my uncle for a summer in highschool, and guess what, there were other races working there too. Also they don't all rush to a taqueria for their lunch break. 

Most ate fast food or brought their lunch from home.

Same with Spanish. Reina is a popular name. 
Lütcrate*
Yeah it's great. 

The whole season was such a tease, it never held your hand and gave you hints as to what did it dit not happen but never a straight up answer. 

The finale was in my opinion, amazing. So pumped for season 3.
Real answer, filming from different angles and days. 

Real smoke would require you to reset, and then there's the problem if it's windy, also you can't really control how it will look. 

Sometimes CGI is a lot cheaper than practical effects.

I've had the phone since launch, been on HSDPA since then.. 

Even went to the ATT store to try to get it fixed and guy was messing with it for an hour and couldn't get LTE. 

Would I have to reset the phone and try all this, or do you think I can try again without resetting?
Doesn't matter who..
I really don't understand the hate for him at all. In the first Avengers movie he almost beat the team while under Loki's mind control. 

Him and Black Widow are just humans, yet she gets all the praise while he gets shit on. 
Just because it's an original idea doesn't mean it'll be good. 

And honestly, I see more people complaining about people complaining about sequels, than actual people complaining about sequels. 

Sequels can be amazing, since we don't have to establish worlds or new character, we can just go for an adventure. Look at The Dark Knight, Godfather part 2, Mad Max Fury Road, Terminator 2.
Don't forget while wearing your Mack Weldon™ underwater, after your nice shave with your  Harry's™ razor.
First picture I was like, okay dirty range, can be cleaned pretty easily. But then the second was that cutting board and I lost all hope. Jesus fucking Christ how can people actually think that's right?!  


When James is trying to talk and Maso keeps interrupting him. 

Sometimes I'm like, LET HIM SPEAK YA DICKHEAD! 
My biggest issue with the purge movies was the next day.

"Sorry I killed your husband Carol; I'm having a BBQ tonight, bring the kids!"  


I think that was a joke. 

Raimi has had a hugely successful career.
I don't think anyone called it a failure financially wise. Story and use of characters maybe. 

I still haven't even seen it. Waiting for the Blu Ray to hit my local used movie store. 
I'm sorry, but are you saying that with Guardians Marvel invented putting classic pop songs in movies? 

That has been a thing for a very long time. I wouldn't say they're pioneering movies, or doing anything differently. In fact, this kind of proves his point even more. "How do we get older audiences interested in our movies?" "Hey let's throw in some songs from their childhood!" 

My last boss is 50 and doesn't really like all the Marvel movies. But he watched Guardians after he saw the trailer featuring Norman Greenbaum's Spirit in the Sky. 
Sound track is not really the same as the score. 

If you meant all the pop songs then yes, but I'm sure no one would recognize the actual [score of the film.](https://youtu.be/GBp1Y-LoObs)
They use a round ball, and don't like it when people call it soccer. 
It'd still be nice to have. 

I sometimes miss just tossing my phone on the pad and going to sleep. 


What crap did you clean out of the Nexus 6? 

Nexus devices come without bloatware. Unless you count all the Google apps. 
I've had mine since launch. Came from a Nexus 6. 

If you like stock Android and don't want to break the bank, this phone is perfect. 

I only have two gripes with it, no wireless charging, and no front facing speakers. Aside from that it's the best phone I've ever had. 
2 videos finally made me listen. 

When they were talking about The Crow and Maso kept going "yesss" I couldn't stop laughing. And when Maso rants about the pit in The Dark Knight Rises. "You dig a hole and put a stick in it!"

So basically it was because if Mason that I started to listen. James.. he's alright. For a dickhead. 
When you own the songs you're able to download them to your computer. It's just uploading them to their server. 

Even songs you acquired by other means can be uploaded to Google Music. I've uploaded about 10 thousand songs from my personal library. 
It's tuna flavored gum.
I wouldn't call them "posers".

It just shows how the Punk scene is not a lifestyle like how many young people view it. It's pretty much a phase. In highschool I was like the characters. I would claim my desert island band something like The Cramps, or The Germs just to show how hardcore I was about Punk. If we all faced our fears like that we wouldn't still try to be tough Punks. We'd let our impulse take over. 

Now I'd probably say Queen, or A.C. Newman. 


All your accounts remain separate, you just are all connected to the main account. 

Just make sure you can really trust the people if you're the account holder, because they will be able to use your payment to make purchases on the play store.
I have a really nice mechanic that tells me to just order the parts online for cheap and he'll just charge me for the labor to put them on. 


I recently took up photography. It is a rich man's hobby. Especially when you start to get hungry for more gear. 

I've been eyeing a new lens for a couple months now. 

However not to say that you can't produce great photos with a cheap kit, but it also helps to have the money to travel and show people exciting locations. 
Computer. Kill Flanders. 
Everyone thinks they have an allergy nowadays. 

I hate when I get an order with an allergy, then I say well they can't have this, that or that. So they come back and say that this okay they just don't want that.
Why do people always throw in concessions with the movie prices. 

It's not mandatory to buy overpriced food with a movie ticket. Can you not go two hours without eating something? 
My IMAX theater charges $15. 


[This video](https://youtu.be/s0JQfoMZbTM) takes someone who is completely new to photography, and give them a week of training to go up against a pro photographer. 
Few podcasts I recommend. 

We Hate Movies, comedy show where they discuss a crappy movie. 

Biggest Problem in the Universe, two hosts bring in one to two problems and discuss them for an hour. Just recently ended, but there's over 100 episodes. And each host has a new podcast now, so if you end up liking it. 

The Cracked Podcast is good and informative. 

Most of the other podcasts I listen to are movie related. 

Hundreds of audiobook on YouTube, and there's also other ways *cough*torrents*cough* to download audiobooks.
Very true. I could maybe recommend some new podcasts if you want. Just let me know what kind you listen to. 

Also YouTube has a lot of audiobook on there. If you get YouTube Red you can listen to them in the background. 
Listen to podcasts.
I'm still stuck on thingamabobs.
I actually think it gets better when you rewatch it. I've seen it about 6 times and every time there's a joke I forgot about that slays me.
Are you allowed to take photos? 

It's because the suburbs keep getting bigger and bigger. 

I'm out in Cypress and every year a new subdivision is being planned out.  

In the past few years two lane back roads have become four lane main roads with dozens of stores on each side.
As a kid I sided with Max now that I'm older I just feel for Goofy. 

He's just trying to be a good dad... 


Also whenever my friends and I go on a road trip On the Open Road gets played a few times.

I think it was pre recorded.
I used to get shit for ”talking white” by other Mexicans growing up. 

Sometimes the worst racism you can experience is from your own race. 
Probably the announcement that the new wolverine might be rated R. After years of fans wanting it and fox making it PG-13 because ”R-rated movies make no money.”
I think I might be the only person that didn't like this movie.
Oh man I remember we had a special stick for one of our robot coupes for like a year. 
Burger restaurant chain in Texas. 

Has some of the best fast food burgers, and their spicy ketchup is the best thing out there.

Recently H-E-B(a giant supermarket chain in Texas) partnered with Whataburger and they started selling their ketchup.
Like when to use a semicolon? 

I'm pretty sure the owners of my place will just tell you that's why they hired all of us.

Also I'm sure most business owners started their businesses so they could be their own boss and not work for someone else... I never claimed that they knew everything.
Wait, you operate your own business but you're staging at other places? 
As a cook who just took up photography, couldn't agree more. Also the photos looked very bland in their coloring. It just looked like he applied a black and white filter on Photoshop without editing anything else. It just looked like light grey on darker grey. 
I think it's a great strength. Because then you'd limit yourself to the amount of stories you can tell. 

To use my examples above. Without this constant change of these characters we wouldn't have stories like The Killing Joke, Dark Knight Returns, or Flashpoint. 

Each writer is allowed to have their own take and interpretation of the characters. And it allows the characters to evolve with the times. 
Bane is a super interesting and complex character in the comics. You should read up on his back story. 

Batman and Robin ruined a great character and made him a joke.
But to.use your argument, comics are always rebooting. Batman has had hundreds of incarnations in the comics. 

They're the same character, but they're all in different stories. The Dark Knight Returns, The Long Halloween, The Killing Joke, and New 52 are all different stories of the same characters. 

So movies getting rebooted shouldn't be an issue. In fact I'd love getting stand alone movies instead of worrying about a cinematic universe. I'd love to see a live action Killing Joke, and Red Hood. Hell just take the new batch of DC animated movies and turn them into live action. Flashpoint Paradox would be amazing on the big screen.
So what does it matter what one person thinks of the movie? I liked BvS a lot, but I can tear it to pieces too. I know what was wrong with it.(however the 3 hour cut fixed some issues I had with it) 

I just enjoyed the movie for what it is. And goddamn, do I love me some Batfleck. 
Fucking Houston. 

3 narrow lane highway, with construction concrete walls on either side. Better get from the left lane to the right without signaling so I can catch my exit. At 80MPH. 

Seen big trucks do this the most. They're the worst.
Sharlto Copley in District 9. 
I stopped going to the AMC near me mostly because of all the kids that hang around it. It's In a big shopping center, so there's always teenagers walking around. It's not their fault, but I just associate AMC rowdy kids now.

I live in Texas, and there's a chain here called Santikos; The best theater in my opinion. AMC has recliner seats, but I'm in that minority that doesn't like them. Santikos has a full bar and restaurant, so Alamo Drafthouse doesn't have that big of a draw for me. And Alamo's screens are smaller. 
Basically a job. 
[This one.](http://heroichollywood.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Civil.jpg)
Not to mention it takes a lot of money nowadays.
As someone in the culinary industry. It's lacking a lot of "fuck", "needs salt", and "pendejo".
Don't heat it. Just put some jelly on it and eat.

It's basically a cracker. 
Pretty much what it is. 

Just no seasonings.
My ex girlfriend thought this was so weird and made fun of me for eating pre toasted toast. 

More for me. 
iPhones in general. 
Friends and I went to Vegas 2 months ago. We pretty much decided we'd be trash people the minute we stepped into the hotel, because fuck it. Boy what a great week. 

I got us kicked out of the MGM.
Yeah but how many people have the access to so much of what he has. 

Watching his videos on YouTube there's tons of celebrities popping up, he has the time to go out and shoot a video with actual production value because of where he comes from. 

I'm not talking shit, I enjoy his work. I'm just jealous. 

I want to be able to make it in the movie industry as a cinematographer and maybe direct a movie too. But it takes money. 
👍
You sure do love being a bigot, don't you buddy?  

Have a great morning. 
So you've met shitty tourists and now hate an entire state's population because of them.

Because we all act like that right?  

Replace the word Texan with any ethnicity and see how you sound. 

Also having the largest medical center in the world. 
Uh they most definitely allow for mods and special orders. 

Especially when they come back saying "they're a regular and just dropped $1200 on wine." 

Working at an upscale restaurant right now. And people that eat at upscale restaurants want their food their own special way. 

It's only the Chef owned restaurants that do the no mods stuff, or the very very nice ones, you're not gonna go to Alinea and ask for everything on the side.  
5 years ago the Galaxy Note came out. Everyone started making fun of how big it was, no one was going to purchase a phone that big. When I got one people were commenting how big it was, and it looked silly. Note users were in the minority then. And looked what happened. Even apple bit the bullet and released a larger iPhone. 

All it takes is one one to start the trend. 

What if one carpenter said "why use a belt when I already have my hands to carry my hammer, you're just in the minority that wants a belt."
I have to say. Star Wars is one of those movies you've seen without seeing it. Pop culture has spoofed it every way it could. One of the biggest examples people use of a spoiler is Darth Vader being Luke's dad. 

Doesn't matter if you've never seen the original movies. You've known who Luke, Leia, Han and Chewie were, and their journey across the galaxy your whole life. Unless you live under a rock.

I've actually never watched Jaws from start to finish. But I know pretty much every iconic line and scene from the movie simply because of pop culture. And I do have a certain nostalgia for it because of that.
Well you could have waited 6 years then binged it all in a few weeks too. 
They're not that bad. Currently on my month free trial and I think I'm gonna keep it for a while. Finished Game of Thrones in two weeks, now started Silicon Valley and already on episode 5. 


Yes. And here's a [comparison video.](https://youtu.be/ucrurqdL3yM)
Camera quality is decent. It doesn't compare to my DSLR, but it gets the job done. Has tons of nice features. 

Battery life is great through. I get around 4-4½ hours of SOT average. [Sometimes 5.](https://imgur.com/a/YCLt9) But then there's the Dash charging. Which makes a huge difference. 

The near stock Android experience is a huge plus. It has some features that stock Android didn't have.(I'm coming from a Nexus 6) I love this phone. And the fingerprint sensor is so fast.

Edit: Here's a little comparison between my DSLR and OnePlus 3. https://imgur.com/a/Q9sur 

1 is my DSLR.
I currently work in the culinary industry. Was trying to become a chef. 

Fuck that. I'm looking for an office job now. 

I've had people tell me that I'd get bored of an office job, they hate sitting all day blah blah blah. Go stand in front of a 600 degree oven for 14 hours then tell me how bad your desk is. 
Buy a power bank. 
Just today my coworker was talking about how all cops are against black people. 

"If you're not white get ready to get shit on by them." His words. 

I'm Mexican and have never experienced any sort of mistreatment from a police officer. I've been pulled over 3 times in my life. And never had a problem with the officer. One was even kind enough to tell me how to get my ticket dismissed. 

If you're approached by an officer and you're giving them a bad vibe, then that's exactly what you'll receive in return. However I do understand there's those that just do things because they have the power. And I'm lucky to never come across one, and hope I never will.
Yes and no. 

Would that master photographer be able to take amazing photos of a lion hundreds of yards away with just a simple point and shoot? No. He'd need a larger lens with a bigger focal length. 

However in just normal scenarios either would do fine. 

However having a nice camera/lens so you can crop your pictures later without sacrificing quality is great. 

Sometimes I just shoot, and later get the composition I want by cropping out the unwanted space. 
Depends. With the carne asada we also have burgers, hot dogs, and some Asian noodles my mom learned to make from her friend. 

We're Mexican. 
Parks and Rec has been over for like 2 years now.
You can stab through Kevlar. 
Even Netflix has this problem though. 

In newest season of Orange is the New Black some of the subtitles wouldn't match up. Nothing major, but just little words here and there being switched up or sometimes not even being there.  
Two hosts. Each bring in 1-2 problems and they discuss them. 

It's hilarious hearing their banter, and they bounce off each other great. They're very vulgar, witty, and their comedic timing is on point. 
The Biggest Problem in the Universe. 

It recently ended due to the two hosts having a falling out. But before then it was one of my favorite podcasts. 104 episodes. So plenty to listen to. 


Houstonian here. There's dry heat?! 

All jokes aside I went to Vegas last month. While it never got that hot, it was an experience.
