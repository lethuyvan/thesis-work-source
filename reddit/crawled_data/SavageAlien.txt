This worked for me, hopefully it helps others:

Go to Apps & Features, select Sea of Thieves in the list of installed apps, under its name you'll see "Advanced Options", and in there you'll see a "Reset" button. Do this and you should be good. 
Because Rare talked about Ship Captaincy coming with their original 3 month update that would also bring Pets. They said this was going to be put on hold for a while to focus on bringing us Hungering Deep, Cursed Sails, and all the weekly events.
Maybe, though I wonder if this ship wreck and the painting all connect to the Hungering Deep. They did say they would drop hints and tease us.
Yeah! Definitely my favourite ship set from the beta. I hope this means it's all connected. Hungering Deep, Killer Whale, Shark ship.
Yeah that's my point.... Mate. They like to make patch note interesting by adding some flair.
It could be a tease, but then it could just be a "in-game" explanation for why clothing and thing differ from region. We've seen them make these little "backstories" before. It's more interesting than saying, "we're restricting cosmetics sets to regions".
That's pretty close what's been going around:

Grog Chest: 700g to 1300g

Sorrows: 840g to 1560g
Scale Tests weren't. You can also pretty much see these all in their promotional videos and screenshots.

The BestBuy price must have gone down sometime recently. Anyway, while this is still a very popular webcam, there is a newer model the C922 that's been out at least year and for some reason Logitech didn't replace the C920 completely so both are sold. I won't complain, it's a very solid webcam and $60 is a great deal.
Probably to do with the XBOX giveaway. :/
This isn't too surprising, yet cool to have confirmed. It's like the Ferry of the Damned. A single hidden area we all get teleported to.

Thanks for reporting back!
You mention text chat, but did you try it? I'd wonder why this would work, but chat wouldn't. (just in case, T is the hotkey for text chat btw)
You can't. I really wish we could. I've muted it for a reason, thanks. Sometimes it's nice, so I think it should be an option, like seeing if there was an @everyone in that channel. Other times I won't care.
Eye of Reach?
No, this has actually happened to people. Servers have just plain shut down on crews outside of maintenance. There were a lot of reports of this happening about a week or two ago.
On sloops, yes. Galleons it's moved further away
Well fixing the interaction hit box would have been good too. But moving them away from each other does the trick.

No idea why the armoury should open if only the ammo box is in sight.
Except that, unlike the other 2 factions, simply gathering the items on the your list don't count as complete until delivered. Find a chest? Done. Kill a bounty? Done. Caught a chicken? That's nice, deliver it!
Merchant Alliance already does, too. If you need 1 pig and 1 chicken, then hand in a pig it will show 0 pigs 1 chicken

Yeah it's a welcome change yet a lazy fix. I could be looking at the ammo without the armoury in view and I'd still have weapon selection popping up... The new placement will take some getting used to.
Are you getting an error when the game crashes or just plain exits? Seems to be a few AMD issues out there ranging between driver issue errors and crashing with no error.

I'm not sure what you're saying. I'm showing that it was more than just concept art. Yes it was old, but we do see that style of mermaid in game already. They take us back to our ships. 


No, I know what they mean. In the 2016 Trailer, you can see [mermaids looting(?) a shipwreck](https://youtu.be/K7ueT7WiH1U?t=53) (in-game/engine footage)
The Hungering Deep is more of a bigger world event. These might add or change things in the world and have their own thematic event. Weekly events will occur, too, which will likely be smaller possibly in the form of challenges or special quests. 
It's possible, too, that they reorganized their plans and the riddle isn't relevant now. We really need another tease.
Suggesting that you'd only wear your sword belt over your coat "because it doesn't make sense otherwise" sure sounds like you're taking a realistic approach.

As for the belts, I'm not totally convinced. When you look at films as you suggested, the shoulder belt seems to be worn the most over coats with waist belts only being worn over coats part of the time.
> No one has mentioned the idea of it being realistic but you dude.

> I tried to make it as  as transparent as possible

It's about as bright as a freshly cracked glow stick.
What would you propose they do to improve it while sticking with the **extra-minimal UI** design of the game?
>that would indicate that we can't independently customize the flags on our ships.

Not really. The screenshot shows the **set**. Hull doesn't depend on sails, so the flag doesn't need to be either. It's just *missing*, it's in Rare advertised image, so it exists *somewhere*.
They're right, though, and I've read some not great things about Samsung not honouring warranties in Canada.
I've seen some long loading times on PC, too, and my PC is decent. I don't think it's 100% specific to user hardware.
Who is that bird? This feels like one of those stories where some stranger messes with the main cast's memories and worms their way into the group.

Maybe Sirens? 
It's not in the shroud. In the same book it says a crew found it and was hunted by the Kraken until they surrendered it.
To be honest, I might be an update behind in Beta, I'll update and test it out. I'll make sure I'm updated and hope that sorts the issue out despite not being listed in any patch notes. 

Some times it would be weeks before it logged me out, other times just days. 
Seems like a mix of Unicorn + Sea Horse (Hippocamp) as it's got a fish tail; same as you see all over the Ferry of the Damned. The Hippocamp isn't typically depicted with a horn (that I'm aware of) so I'm guessing Rare just said "Eh - why not!" to give it a more mythical vibe.
I hope we can get /u/DBrady 's attention in regards to this. It seems to be affecting a bunch of users. He did comment in one thread suggesting it was a a Cleaner app, but I personally don't have any installed.

Update drivers, go to AMD control panel and turn off Global Shader Cache, and set in-game lighting to Cursed/Common. 
There's a number of AMD users being affected, but there doesn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to it. 

I wasn't affected at first, but strangely enough it started (for me) after last week's patch). That's when I looked for solutions and found it was an ongoing issue for others.
Does closing it with the X on the title-bar do nothing or right-clicking the taskbar icon? In-game Menu options to Exit the game sometimes just hang, but those others seem to usually work.
So what you're saying is they could have done a simple minimalist logo and made it look very clean.
There's now a [Suggestion + Feedback section](https://www.seaofthieves.com/forum/category/67/feedback-suggestions) to the forums, too.
Yeah the whole game as a UWP app sort of sucks. I don't know a whole lot about UWP but it may be M$'s way of forcing some sort of DRM, which we all know just causes more problems for the users.

I do know Ted Timmins is PC Design Lead and you could reach out to him, but I honestly don't know how much control they have using Microsoft's UWP. 

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/justteddii?lang=en)
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/justteddii)
- [Sea of Thieves Forums](https://www.seaofthieves.com/forum/user/teddy-25)

The taskbar icon has a weird, useless grey border on it, too. I don't know why they did that. Just cut out the grey and keep the black & white. It would look much cleaner. 
More likely the tent is just where he conducts business. 
Where/when did they announce this would be in their first update?
Based on what the devs have suggested, we should expect at least a couple new items before the 3-Month update that will bring pets and possibly "ship captaincy", whatever that will mean.
I think it's more likely they decided to make it more than just a giant squid.
If you look at the concept art, the "head" is more like a fish's body with tentacles, it could work.
That's concept art of the Kraken from The Art of Sea of Thieves book.
Nope the xbox game bar uses **ALT**+win+printscreen
Actually Win+PrntScrn auto saves, those others just copy to the clipboard. 
Win+PrntScreen will also auto-save screenshots if that's all you need, but it captures your entire desktop across all monitors if you have multiple screens.
Having the same issue. Timing lines up with the update, I figure?
It's concept art from the "Art of Sea of Thieves" book, not final artwork obviously but the direction they were heading, and it would match up with skulls we've seen in game.
I didn't have crashes until after yesterday's update so I updated my drivers and have my Water set to Cursed and it didn't crash. Going to see if I can play with higher water settings when I have more time.
What kind of crash do you experience? Any error messages?
Might be worth posting what graphics card you have and driver version. In case you haven't, try updating drivers as a few have Sea of Thieves fixes.

RX480 8GB here with almost 0 issues. I've been playing since the Scale Tests earlier this year, and only had 1 graphics related crash. Driver version doesn't appear to matter in my case since I've done update since I began playing. 
Typing "ope" I get Notepad, too. For fun I tried "open" and it gives me Paint.... OK...

Yes, if you choose to delete your pirate, you will lose your progression and gold.
That's cool, which games are you referencing? Just asking out of curiosity.
> The devs haven’t released any sort of road map, which is a pretty big red flag. 

Not every game does this. It would be nice to calm us down, but not expected right? Like if people were happier the 3 months wait for more stuff wouldn't seem so far away, without a road map, right?

I'm just thinking of games like Fort Nite or Overwatch don't tell us exactly what's coming out months ahead of schedule. Maybe hints of a theme or some teases, but nothing solid until when it's right around the corner. Another older example could be Team Fortress 2, which also started very light, had a ton of updates but they were often kept as surprises until announced. 

Edit: This is just me asking an honest question...
Perhaps it's a Pirate Legend quest?
If I recall right (it's been a while), there's a "minimize Big Picture" option or something to that effect in the the Menus.
You understand I'm not disagreeing with you, right?
But we at least have this option. It's more than console players have. I always see console players say that PC would get an advantage if this happened, but we are already ahead, and if Rare adjusted the preset sensitivity BOTH sides **will benefit**. And that's a good thing.

As for whether PC players want to switch dpi during game, I don't see why not, but *it's a personal preference* so everyone is different. *(If all PC players were against this it wouldn't be so readily available)*. It's a simple press of a button and several mice have special "sniper buttons" which when held down will change the dpi.
I know exactly what to say. Don't believe everything a customer support representative tells you. 
The best solution would be to increase the game's preset sensitivity even slightly. The only side that truly loses with slow aiming would be consoles/controller players. PC players can just use doing switching like you said which is very common among gaming mice, but controllers are stuck in molasses.
If you already assume it's been asked then the search function would be handy to use.
True but Shadow skeletons thrive in darkness and have mean looking glowing eyes. Either way I can't wait!
I thought the Edge magazine article suggested they wouldn't be friendly ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
They were mentioned in that Edge magazine article. There's an even meaner looking game model that the devs previously showed off at Comic Con, too.
And margaritas at the midnight buffet!!! 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Seaofthieves/comments/84fn9i/athenas_fortune_sign_spotted_in_newest_video/
It's controller friendly, and OP has a controller, so eh, why not...
I'm aware of that. Rare also said they would push smaller updates between the large ones. Things like the trumpet and drum might arrive a lot sooner based off their wording.
That the bigger update with pets in 3 months. They said things like drums "aren't too far away" which might mean a minor patch before then. I don't think they'll wait 3 months for things that are so close to being ready.

Edit: Another answer in the AMA says they'll do small patches and updates between big updates.
Yeah, same. I wonder how long "not too far away after launch" will actually be.
Windows 10 supports the platform required to run Sea of Thieves, older versions do not.
To be perfectly honest, with Classic Shell, Win8.1 doesn't feel very different to 7.
Eh, doesn't sound like a different ship from that answer. This other answer from another question further implies it's skins:

> RareLtd: Mike: When we bring in ship captaincy the **legendary cosmetics** that you acquire will apply to both sloop and galleon.


This is something they have said will be looked into after launch. I wouldn't expect it too soon.


This is something they have said will be looked into after launch. I wouldn't expect it too soon. 
Yeah that could be right.... But I still signed up in January and have Insider, so still confused by your statement that Insiders were only up until December.
Fair enough, I'm probably confused. All I know is that the question was why the other user couldn't see the forum post this thread links to, it's under the "Sea of Thieves Insider Programme" area. So going by your info, they just need to be part of Xbox Insider....??
I'm referring to how you said Insiders were alpha not beta players. I joined the Insider Programme after December, and have access to the Insider section of the forums, pretty sure you needed to sign up to the Insider program to have SoT show on the Insider Hub to play the Scale Tests (except Final Beta)

Founders are Insiders, but not all Insiders are Founders, nor did they all participate in alpha
Not pre-December'17.... Insiders are basically anyone who played up until the last beta before Final Beta as those Betas/Scale Tests required the **Insider** Programme. Edit: changed hub to programme.
It would be nice if they add a message when you pick saying what can/can't be changed. I'm sure some players will have no clue and judge a pirate on hair or pegleg.
Oh, yeah for sure. I thought we were talking about navigating the shops. My bad
Personally, I'd want WASD+mouse over scroll wheel for this reason. Edit: for some reason I thought we were talking about scroll wheel in shop lists.
To expand on this, you'll notice that it requires Windows 10 (can't run on 8 or older). The reason it's a Windows 10 exclusive is because it uses UWP (Universal Windows Platform), which you don't really see outside the Windows Store. UWP helps with cross-play, and sure it's not the only way to crossplay, but it's a Microsoft game so that's the platform Sea of Thieves is built on, therefore locked into the Windows Store.
This has nothing to do with answering what content exists. Ted Timmins is "PC Design Lead" at Rare and the forum thread was specifically about improving PC experience. 
You asked about  weapons. There's only 2 weapon slots... You can use scroll wheel or 1 and 2... hopefully you get to customize those, I forget...

Everything else falls under "items". Shovel, lantern, banana... etc and that's what we're talking about getting binds for.
My pleasure. I know Sensitivity is a definitely a hot topic, and it's good to not only that the devs are listening (even in their last week to launch!) but also to know they have ideas and plans to tackle the feedback, even if it will take time. 
On controller? It's Y button to cycle the 2 weapons now, correct?
There's a redesign in the works... But, you know, with Valve time, and all, that may not happen for a long while.
They plan to have hotkeys for the item wheel, not sure what else will get hotkeys. We'll have to wait and see what gets in the full release. Please use the search function there was a thread just the other day about this, among others.
Banana is one of the easiest items to switch to already, a hotkey would have a such a tiny effect on balance if any. 
...and a proper Main Menu with Settings and Exit options. 
I tweeted Ted about it, and amazingly he found time to answer back saying they are working on it and hoping to have it in release. /u/_Colty_ should be pleased to hear this.
> The more random stuff that goes in it, the more difficult it becomes to see relevant notifications.

Most of the time, I have 0 other notifications active. I'd even qualify this as a relevant notification. It wouldn't even appear there for very long, only when it was active and relevant. 
Your drawing is amazing!
Switching to a banana, maybe, but even with the banana out you still have to then eat it, and that still leaves you exposed during the heat of battle. You're shaving off a minuscule amount of time in the grand scheme of whatever situation you're in. 

Most other items are non essential in PvP and hotkeys wouldn't really provide you much advantage over others. If you can think of a situation I might have overlooked, I'm open to hearing it.
Yeah it's a bit odd!!! It was a special event he was at, no idea if they were playing a special build or not, but it's been a month it was missing in the Final Beta? Hmm...

"The ability to assign radial items to hotkeys was clearly the most important thing, which has actually gone into the build, so anybody who plays this weekend will experience hotkeys for the first time
> Why should Rare use ressources to make a game perfect for a secondary platform

There's no secondary or primary platform. Rare is developing the game as a whole (they don't see it as separate) and have taken a TON of feedback from PC gamers to make sure Rare makes a good PC game (rather than it feel like a port).

I suggest you [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaCWxjK3Pa0) (Radial item hotekys are @ [26:21](https://youtu.be/kaCWxjK3Pa0?t=1581)) to see how dedicated they have been to making this as much of a PC game as a console game. Hotkeys are even mentioned as being added in hopefully by release.

Edit: added timestamp video link for radial item hotkeys

Edit 2: Sounds like Hot Keys are still planned. /discussion
Ted Timmins did a presentation earlier this year, about their experience in developing Rare's first PC game. He spoke about how they took a ton of feedback and tried to include as much as possible to satisfy PC gamers. Resolution, framerate options, etc... This is how we got the Field of View slider. 

[Ted mentions hotkeys for radial items specifically in his presentation.](https://youtu.be/kaCWxjK3Pa0?t=1581) Even says they are in the demo build they had during that weekend's show. 

I'm curious why we didn't see them in the beta, and I'll be a bit disappointed if they somehow vanish from the final release.

UPDATE: Ted says they hope to have it in release. 
It's something they said will be in release. Perhaps they just kept crews public during betas to get as many players in as possible. 
There's patches that go out at least once a month. I'm not sure what OP is going on about.
How do you diagnose these options. I've begun experiencing disconnect/reconnect sounds and I believe it might be my external hard drive or the port it's plugged into. Any advice?
Sea of Thieves is a UWP game, you don't see a lot of UWP apps outside of the Windows Store.  This is why it's will only run on Windows 10 and would be a huge part in the reason for its Windows Store exclusivity. 

Edit: Killer Instinct your traditional executable and supports older Windows OS systems
The beta had about equal ratio Xbox and pc players trying it out.
They says it's so we don't spend hours and hours creating "the same character we would make in any other game" .... instead we just spend hours looking for the right random pirate. Yeah...

I get what they're aiming for, but it's just too little control for a permanent character. I think this new bookmark system will work well. 
You get a choice of 8 randomly generated characters, you can then choose to "re-roll", giving you another 8 to pick from. A lot of people weren't happy with this approach for a number of reasons because you are locked in to the Pirate you choose, and people want to be happy with their choice. 

Having the option to "favorite" and set a side characters keeping them set aside while you keep rolling will help a lot. Until now, you couldn't go back so if you saw a Pirate you "might" like but wanted to see others, there was no way to save it just in case the next so many weren't to your liking.
in theory your friends could have used their own personal lanterns
A proper Exit and Settings option on the Main Menu would be wonderful....
I really hope they have keybinds for the radial items in the full release. We have a video  from a while ago with Ted Timmins saying they added it, but where is it? Hmm..
I agree. I don't see how anyone can say this is balance for console players when PC gamers have dpi switching built into gaming mice. This just leaves console players stuff with slow aiming.
> just turn your dpi up if it’s an issue

You think it's a balance thing because of cross platform, but then you suggest PC players should just do it with other software.... so really the only player that suffers is the console player who CAN'T adjust sensitivity. 

If Rare made adjustments it would benefit all players since you seem to already understand PC players have other options.
I think the solution would be for Rare to tweak the sensitivity for all players, a slider wouldn't be necessary.  
It's not just for PC players, and not just the sniper rifle and it's not to "360-no-scope console n00bs". PC players already have an advantage by using gaming mice with dpi switches. Console players don't have this option.

Aiming, or just using your spyglass, or cannon or really slow. This affects **both** Mouse and Controller players, and BOTH type of players would benefit from ANY adjustments, wouldn't have to be a slider. In fact a simple slight increase in sensitivity for all players would help, I wouldn't want a sensitivity slider if Rare could just find nice balance between sluggish and user friendly. 
I'm just imagining a thick cloud of feathers upon impact. Attack in the confusion of feathers and clucking!
If you're referring to Scope Sensitivity, and wanted a setting to tweak it, I've seen both ~~console~~gamepad players and PC M+K players ask for adjustments. *Many PC players can already adjust DPI sensitivity on the fly with gaming mice*, while gamepad players can not. Adding some sort of option for both control schemes would make it fair because this is not a PC/M+K only issue here.
100% leaked from Pioneer, you can see the username watermark. 
I don't mind the Pirate Generator in theory, but the way it's handled (at least as we've seen) is lacking. Just keep rolling until you're happy or get bored. Now you're stuck with that one. Maybe I saw a pirate I *miiight* want to pick, but kept spinning/rolling, those other pirates are lost. 

There have been lots of good ideas to improve this experience, one of the simplest being that Rare ought to add a "bookmark" option to save those pirates we like, have it take up a spot in the generator while we keep rolling.

Xbox has its own party chat features, too. Discord isn't a special case here. 
So basically Timeline has replaced Task View? I'm not on an insider build, but that sounds kind of rough. I like the simplicity of the current Task View.
You know you could visit  origin.com  and take a look? It's a publisher sale on until March 6.
Someone else posted it, too, but [here's the video](https://youtu.be/kaCWxjK3Pa0?t=1566)

At around 26min he says they'll assign radial items to hotkeys. He says it's in a build already so we should have it at release - fingers crossed.
They said in a video they will let us bind items to individual keys, the betas have been dumbed down versions of the full game so there's still a chance we'll see these options fleshed out with release.

It was the one about making a game pc players will enjoy.
Hmm I guess with a username like /u/NinthRiptide you'd probably prefer #9 ?
This is great but you would have really nailed it with a classic green Steam skin.
EVA Foam, yeah. OP appears to be using EVA Foam mats you'd find at hardware stores, and L200 is a type of EVA Foam, it's basically the same stuff. It's really common in props and costumes [ex. armour] like what you see people wear at conventions. 
I became irrationally excited the moment I realized this was crafted from foam. You did an amazing job! Very inspiring video! 

I've made some foam props in the past, and I find the process a lot fun. A lot of work, but a lot of fun!
> This animation style was nicer

It all depends on what you want to achieve. The abstract backgrounds for Bugs Bunny cartoons worked great, looked great, and fit the cartoon. I can't imagine it done any differently.
Yes, thank you. 3D doesn't make something great. Painted backgrounds can be works of art. WB / HB had some great stuff.
> Hannah Barbera garbage?

thems' fighting words. Because it didn't have 3D backgrounds they're garbage? A lot of what they and other animation studios pulled off on the cheap back in the day are works of art and should be admired. (Of course there will always be exceptions, in the past and present too )
They aren't perfect, but I do see similarities. 

Here's a few things these (mostly) have in common: James Bond featured predominantly on poster,a hint of blur, colours are in the cool blue tones and de-saturated like an old photograph, shadows are dark practically black, and they have white title text with golden 007 gun logo.

A few stand out because they either have too much light in them or stray from the cool blue theme. Live and let die and Thunderball are too green, while Quantum of Solace is all warm, nothing cool about the colours there. 

I would have personally tried to place the titles in a similar area as best possible and standardize the golden logo better with the text being around the same size to improve readability.
I imagine your stuff will be valuable to someone no matter what voyage you're on.
Something similar happened to me. Weird part being that I was below deck at the time (sloop). 
Yeah. Too easily exploitable, but saving inactive quests might be more reasonable, they aren't shared until voted on and active. You spent cash on those after all. You'd be out of luck with Bottles though since those are immediately shared with the crew.
I like mine too. I'd hope they'd somehow allow us to choose to remain with what we have, but I'm not sure they're set up for that. 
Yeah, I can't say why it got disabled for you, mine's been going fine since the update.
My personal preference is to bind the extra side button to middle click which I find a lot more comfortable to use on a regular basis. 
Yeah it's very borderline violet. Fewer people would be confused if we had a proper blue cup there next to it.
No, we have always had the first 2 permissions. OP is mistaken in saying these are **all** new permissions. The only new permission is the Download related one.
These permissions are not new. The permissions are required to do what Imagus does.

"read data on the websites you visit" = read links 

"change the data on websites" = display the images over your current page

RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite) and uBlock, they require the exact same permission. Most (if not all) extensions that interact with websites will require it.

Browser history permission is so for the option to remove hovered images from your history. Downloads permission is to enable it to have a download hotkey.
Canada's got a holiday, too, for what it's worth, not that it matters much to a company in the UK.  I would have been happy with extra time on Sunday, but I sailed my booty off on Saturday.
Of all the permissions Imagus has, "manage downloads" is the least "scary".

By downloading Imagus you agree that Imagus can:

- Read and change all your data on the websites you visit

- Read and change browsing history

- Manage your downloads

Google is kinda bad at naming permissions but, to be fair, they are pretty generic and cover a wide range of use scenarios.
Other options besides Ctrl-S: 

1) Hold CTRL while hovering and right click to get your usual "Save Image As" menu. 

2) Tap "O" to open in a new tab, then save from there.
>Especially since it's exactly what happened to the extension I used before Imagus, HoverZoom.

[Is it really?](https://i.imgur.com/Zccm07U.gif) Is this **exactly** what happened to HoverZoom? [The exact same thing?](https://i.imgur.com/ytNl2DA.jpg)

(It's not.)
[I made a list last year](https://i.imgur.com/ePkKZoL.jpg) Big ones on the left are my lazy attempts to fix them. The smaller lineup are existing emoji.
A more fitting example would be that you broke up with a bad boyfriend. You have a new boyfriend who is pretty nice. You have been dating for a few years, all is good. One day while your boyfriend is out at work your landlord comes to change the locks. You get a key. Boyfriend comes home, knocks and says his key won't work. Says you'll have to let him in and tomorrow go together to get the new key copied for him. You begin to wonder if he's gone bad like the last boyfriend. You continue to remain suspicious even though he acts the same. 
Asking "Can we have a change log?" because you want to safe and informed is normal. Assuming every update like this could mean there's some nefarious intent is too paranoid. 

There's always a chance. There are updates that happen in the background that we never notice. You noticed this time because the permissions changed. Chrome has actually improved its extension security since HoverZoom, too.

I'm honestly still confused what it is about this specific update that has you so worried still.
Yes, it's just the 4 of them since Steven left.
Sadly I've noticed a lot of recent posts have stopped offering alternatives, zippyshare or otherwise. (Though I understand it might be time consuming to upload twice)
I believe users were reporting that **Ctrl-S** to save was broken. (based on what I've read here) EDIT: It might still be broken??
> I'm not saying that you could monetize off that. I was describing just a few of the issues with Chrome extensions.

Then I guess I simply didn't understand how we got from the one comment asking users not to panic, to your comment. Monetizing? Malicious? This extension has a feature to download the things you hover, it makes sense it'd need the permission. 

But it's true there's no harm in asking "Why?".
Yeah I thought it might be a P183 because the 1 screw securing the lower drive cage is at the bottom edge while earlier models had it on the right edge... still, there's details that don't feel "right" for the P183.

The middle piece of frame between the PSU and drive cage, for example. I think it's to mount a fan? That doesn't appear in images of the P183 case. 

There's also holes in the middle of the PSU divider floor to route cables up from PSU to the GPU/Mobo... that doesn't seem to match either.


I honestly don't know what to think other than this is an awful lot time put into researching an old, retired computer case.
Google also does a shit job of describing permissions some times.

I dunno how you could monetize off "manage downloads" permission. My immediate thought was "Oh maybe Chrome tweaked its permission security and now Imagus needs permission to be allowed to save files.... seems that's pretty spot on from what I've read so far.

Edit: forgot a word.
Then Chrome apparently changed how that worked, so the feature broke. Now here we are with an update.
There's a quote **from the dev** saying in another thread that **an update will fix downloads**, but it ***will require a new permission***, and ***not to panic***. That's pretty clear and reasonable. It's not a change log but good enough until there is one. I don't know where your monetizing and nefarious theory stems from. HoverZoom was years ago and Chrome has since updated its extension security since then and often. (Like requiring download permissions)

Some suspicion is natural, but we should balance that out with some smart critical thinking. "Why would Imagus need to manage downloads?" Well, maybe to save images because that's a feature it has!

There's no harm in asking questions, but suspicion is just jumping to conclusions, and a slippery slope. **Use the evidence available to you**, find a *logical solution* that makes the *fewest assumptions*. If further evidence points to nefarious intent then so be it.

Same with that other thread. Those permissions would be to allow Imagus to read the links (the very purpose of Imagus) it needs to load as well as add (or hide) the image links in your browser history. (Ex. I have it set to hide links from my History so I won't have all the memes I see on reddit cluttering my browser history).

It's just been [the 4 of them](http://www.barenakedladies.com/splash/files/fakenudestour-cover.jpg) since Steven left. 

You might have seen them perform WITH someone else, like a couple years back I saw them when they toured with Alan Doyle's band. 
Thanks so much!
Would someone be willing to make a Zippyshare mirror?
I know some people that live/have lived in Nunavut that would probably love high speed internet.

Edit: in fact they'll have 15 megabits per second by 2019
It wouldn't be all that expensive, really. There would be deals for certain days. It was like going to the movies with friends but video games instead. 

Another reason back when we had one in my area (Ontario) was that the residential internet kinda sucked, but that's not a huge issue these days, which is probably one reason they're less common.
There was a gaming cafe here when I was in high school, it was nice because we couldn't all afford the games and gaming systems and our small town/rural internet sucked back then. Higher speeds just wasn't worth it for regular home subscriptions. Obviously this was before Netflix and streaming and we eventually got decent speeds.
But my point is more what if the expressions are consistent, would the shapes still matter?

In Android N, out of the 77 basic blob smileys, they only needed to fix 7 or so. That's not bad. I wonder what people would think if they had just improved their designs, like Samsung, rather than start from scratch. 


The developers actually put out a few patches after release that fixed a good number of things.

The impact of this fixpack (at the moment) is very low. For now it's mostly minor cosmetic things like gender of character to fit voice, and little details in a couple conversations. There's only a few relatively small recipe/quest fixes, and a fix to enemies still respawning in 2 areas after clearing.

The effort put into this is still appreciated. I wonder what else they have planned.
But is going from blob shaped to round really that important so long as the expressions are consistent?
I think in this case you may want to check out *Through the Keyhole* in the featurettes.
See, it's scifi because it has an alien with a fancy gun. That's *super* light scifi, and exactly my point. Your debate was with someone who believes in harder scifi as true scifi. They barely see Star Wars as scifi if at all. Predator won't be the example that persuades them otherwise. 
The clear ones by Orico look neat. I've had one on my Amazon wish list just waiting for the right drive to come along.
I'm not the same user you've been chatting with, but i just thought I'd point out that some of those examples like Predator and Edge of Tomorrow are really light on the scifi, and not good examples to back your point, imo. One's a monster movie and the other's a war/disaster type movie. 
They did also say it looked outdated, above that. It also feels like you're taking a pessimistic view on the idea of changing the client. Change won't hurt if done right.
Most people want it to feel modern (look pretty). It sort of feels like something from Windows 7 era or earlier compared to other clients.
Steam totally needs a modern overhaul, behind the scenes and cosmetic. The last one major UI overhaul was in 2010, but that version has received a lot of small updates/tweaks sprinkled over the years. It looks different than now than in 2010, it's subtle, and still outdated, but I'll give them credit for not leaving it like it was at release in 2010 like you make it sound.
I used Resource Hacker to give it a blue & white icon. Much nicer.

What's wrong with zippyshare? I've actually noticed fewer post have included mirror links to zippyshare which I found to be handy on certain occasion. So if you could enlighten me I'd appreciate the info.
Worth noting that your screenshot isn't the default skin, which is also very nice. There's also a lot to pick from on the web.

I've been enjoying Potplayer, but damn it that yellow icon is ugly. It can be customized, but it's an extra step we shouldn't have to take for an otherwise good looking program.
But what about the ones that are clear and consistent in expression but have their "cuteness" taken away to fit in better?
Consistent should mean that the expressions are they same/similar between sender and receiver. Smiley face shouldn't have a big toothy grin on one and a closed mouth on the other. 

It's become more clear that it's important to be forward facing. We saw it with the older blobs that faced sideways, and now again here with Samsung's emoji. Blobs went round to fit in, too. I've actually seen people argue that the blobs were ugly purely because of their shape.

Personally, expression is all I need, they can be round, blob, square, and looking at the changes Samsung made, I'd say some of their sideways emoji were nice and added character.
I still miss the [old Android ghost](https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/160/google/3/ghost_1f47b.png). Now we get... [the snap chat logo?](https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/160/google/119/ghost_1f47b.png)

This seems to be an issue if your screen scaling/DPI is set higher than 100%. Is that your setup, /u/techvenkat ?

>depending on your device you need to set the Zoom level from 100% to 90% or 80%, but you can’t use Chrome or view other websites with that zoom level.

Actually, zoom level is saved per website, but I think google sites will be effected by zooming out the New Tab page.
You haven't mentioned what resolution you run at. 

So I did some testing.

I'm at 1920x1080 with 100% zoom and regular DPI. I have 8 sites available.

Using 125% system DPI, it displays 8 only when the windows is maximized, it is reduced to 4 squares if the window is any smaller, but SIX if snapped to the side.

---

Using 100% system DPI, and only resizing the window I notice the following:

I see FOUR (1row) if the window HEIGHT is lower than 710px

I see SIX (2x3) if the window WIDTH is lower than 864px

THREE if the width and height are lower than 864x710

TWO if the width is less than 694px

NONE if the height is less than 566px
I didn't make the claim, I just linked a review to back it up. Did you read it? [It shows the MX300 does take a performance hit when full compared to the new MX500.](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12263/the-crucial-mx500-500gb-review/3)

I have a MX300 525GB. I like it and I've recommended it to friends; I'm also cool with it being beat by a newer model.
I guess considering there's a newer, better model out, it's technically old enough to count.

You should check out [this review of the new MX500](https://www.anandtech.com/show/12263/the-crucial-mx500-500gb-review) to see how it compares to the MX300. 

You'll see why the MX500 is recommended here vs the MX300.

That's no way to treat your friend, buddy! 
Check out IKEA's "As-Is" section for a board. They'll often have a number of spare shelves or kitchen cupboard doors that should be a good size. You can raise it off the floor too with legs IKEA sells.
They're pretty common still, surprisingly. Amazon, New Egg, and Best Buy (online and in store) all sell them. 

Staples did have a big clearance on them last year in favour of selling the RGB version.
Well... I'd rather they fixed the website code. I mean, just look at that menu; It's all aligned on the left, with that BIG empty space on the right.
The artist did these like 5 years ago. To be honest, I hope they have a decent animation career doing other projects by now.
> I bet you posted this because you love Calvin and Hobbes and look what it got you.

Not sure what you're trying to say; It got OP upvotes/karma. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
No, old ones had teeth. The new ones just have outlines now, around mouth, tongue, and teeth. They appear to have forgotten to outline the mouth on the "nerd" emoji.

In fact some lost teeth in favour of a solid black mouth. 
Google built Allo up to be exactly what it was on release, but that didn't stop /r/Android from hyping up SMS features that were never announced. Granted Google never specifically said "Allo won't have SMS" either...

For this news, there's some interesting theories and evidence to back it, but they're still just theories. Hopefully we'll have more info soon, until then my own excitement level remains at neutral/skeptical.
I think Star Wars, Calvin and Hobbes, and any mainstream stories inspire and bring people toward film, art, writing, science. People writing fan fiction or drawing fan art will move on to making their own stuff.
can you name an example game that does?
Imitating Watterson's style goes hand-in-hand with the theme of these type of drawings. "Friend A & Friend B" walking on a log, or  [taking off on an adventure](http://media.abclocal.go.com/content/creativeContent/images/cms/1089707_630x354.jpg)

It's not their personal art style, obviously. Kesinger works at Disney animation, and quite adept at imitating another artist's style as it's one of the most important skills of the trade. 

Here's a [Adventure Time/Star Wars crossover by him](https://twitter.com/briankesinger/status/958833143850590208) (Finn and Jake / Finn and BB-8)
Really? That's dumb. Which games? I'm used to seeing Fullscreen, Fullscreen Borderless, and windowed.
You can tell it's not Kesinger because this style isn't as refined. It's drawn more as a  beginner/amateur would as it doesn't hit the same level of detail and accuracy. A good example is Chewie's flimsy bowcaster blaster (it's just rough lines) and Han's hair that doesn't fit the C&H style.

Kesinger has been an artist at Disney for around 16 years. He knows anatomy and how to apply volume and detail to objects.

I'm not saying the art OP is posting is bad, but it's not on the same level and it's easy enough to notice the differences if you know what to look for.
I think that one's credited to Chris Wahl, actually.
Left pane feels "muddy" with that grey acryllic and dark text. Go with white text or lighten up the pane background.

Pinned Apps don't feel necessary as you have that on the taskbar and start menu.

You should use the actual eject icon rather than that arrow.

Move the list/icon view buttons. They're creating too much empty space being on their own horizontal plane/area. I'd say move them to the bottom corner opposite the Command Prompt.

What is the Command Prompt space meant to represent? Would it display other options depending what's selected?

You have a New Tab button. It would be nice to see your idea of your mockup with other tabs open.
> >I prefer a clean-looking and minimalistic design which hides the functionality of the ribbon in the background.
> 
> I think you just literally said "I prefer minimalism over functionality". what. the. fuck.

I'm guessing this mock up has the ribbon minimized. What OP means by "hiding" the ribbon in the background. I can see an arrow to the right under the search box which is a lot like how it's handled now.

>Thumbnails

OP's mockup is displaying the icon in detailed view, you can see they included a button in the mockup to allow viewing larger icons and thumbnails. Again, this is a lot like how it's handled in the file explorer now.
All that grey on grey isn't ideal. Aim for better contrast especially in text.
That's pretty unbelievable considering the amount of proof of ownership it sounds like you provided. Makes me think there might be more to this story. Either way, I would keep trying. 
It's that cabbage diet.
**Moose Tracks** or **Mint Chocolate Chip**, depending on mood and where I'm getting it. There's a local dairy company that makes some really awesome ice cream flavours; in the summer they'll always have lineups of people trying to decide what to get.
I feel like my fix was a lot simpler and solved the problem.....

I fixed my double clicking by bending my clicker's tension spring back into shape. I've also heard static can be a cause and adding some tape between the clicker and the piece that presses it down on the inside can alleviate the static issue)
Double clicking can often be caused by wear of the clicking mechanism, and can likely be fixed. Here's how I was able to fix my G500.

It involved taking the mouse apart, opening the small clicking mechanism, bending a very delicate tension "spring", and reassembling. It's not a DIY fix for everybody, needs patience, attention to detail,  and steady-ish hands. The result is worth it when out of warranty and you have the guts to operate on your beloved mouse.

(I've seen it suggested that humidity/static can cause this issue too and adding a *thin* bit of vinyl tape on the plastic piece that presses the clicker can act as a buffer)
Nah, OPs title is confusing
Title is "Weekend Deal", so I understand their confusion.
> Emojis are popular because Apple, and MacOS had emoji support before windows. Many people probably think Apple created emoji.

Eh, there were emoticons before emoji were a thing - MSN Messenger, AIM, ICQ, they all had "smileys".

It' s true that Apple was pretty much first in the mobile market to solidify their emoji as a recognizable brand. That paired with the simple fact that Apple products are popular they have before "the" emoji. All the other platforms have their own styles, so no one else except maybe Samsung had enough clout, but Samsung's emoji are.... something special in their own.
Remember emoji aren't just the expressions ("smileys" / "blobs"), they include animals and objects, too. These were almost completely redone between the old "blob" set and the new Android O set. The new ones either look pretty bad by comparison, feel like cheap copies of Apple designs, or both. 
Android N blobs looked great and were actually very consistent to unicode/iPhone expectations. Older versions lacked consistency, and it was a shame they were so slow updating them.

Now we have Android O emojis... Google threw away solid designs to start from scratch. While I'll say I don't mind some Smiley faces and people, anything beyond that is pretty bad in comparison. It just feels like an artist was told to copy iPhone's emoji using Macromedia Flash.
Samsung is king of being different than everybody.

Android N's blob emoji set was pretty spot on for most expressions. They only needed to fix 3-5. Way better than what Samsung has had.

The problem with emoji is that we only usually get updates with major Android versions, and there are users stuck on older versions with (you guessed it) old and outdated emoji.
Yes a Mark All Read button is a good idea. It won't harm those who won't use it, and will help those who would.

Also the option to mute/ignore unread messages in **muted** channels. This would cut down on unread messages, too, in some cases.

Example: Maybe I like a server, but want to ignore a channel *completely* because I have no interest in the topic it was made for. I shouldn't have to mute @mentions on the *entire server* just to stop seeing a count of missed messages in one channel I'm not interested in.

Yeah, using Win+tab you see all applications open in the current desktop and existing desktops are along the bottom. There's a New Desktop button to make new ones, and you can close them from there too, either using the X button at the thumbnail or middle click. Right-click an application and you can do stuff like move it to another desktop.

Gotta keep an open mind with the leaks being a year old. A lot can change in that time... or nothing at all. Hopefully we won't have to wait another year to find out! 
Exactly. The Steam client needs a lot more than just a fresh coat of paint. Even the Steam client we know now has had several changes in the past 7 years that a skin couldn't accomplish on its own. 
They had the 2010 UI in Beta for a bit. A month, maybe 2? I can't remember exactly. So it depends on your definition of "very long".

EDIT: and they often had larger feature updates in beta for long enough to test, maybe a couple weeks to a month depending.
FYI - File size is 5.61 GB
 

>fans regularly make fan fiction versions of his work

So, just like nearly any other story or art out there? How dare someone be inspired by Calvin and Hobbes to be creative and make something! 
Why? In animation school we'd be given assignments to pick existing characters and try to draw and animate them "on model". It's good practice.
Don't let /r/calvinandhobbes catch you saying that. I mean, it's not a hive mind so obviously there's people that like Bacon and Hobbes. However, the people who don't like it are super vocal whenever it gets posted, and it does often enough.
the new stuff is animated.
Looking at you, anime sequence in Horton Hears a Who...

80s kid here. Got to high school and they pretty much wanted anything worth handing in to be typed.
I'd say my storage for sure.
This is awesome, I love the colours. Where did you get the blue and orange cube shelves?
I found getting haircuts hilarious; reactions were precious, and I could easily calm them down with a laugh, reassuring them that it always does that and they weren't too rough.
Sunlight? *Hsssss!*
I used to have this to a lesser extent when I was younger. I don't think it ever lasted half an hour so maybe not 100% the same thing. It lessened after high school, but I had fun with it while it lasted. Now I only get pink discoloration, a bit more than normal I guess since people still comment on it. I was also really bad with hives, which I think was related in a way because that doesn't break out as badly as it used to, though I do get a case of the itches.
Personally, I keep my GNex around as a bedside alarm clock.
You think it was mistranslated? The images clearly match up with the text (Fleur-de-lys/Quebec, Maple leaf/Canada), so it's tough to say for sure if this is intentional or what.

It would have made more sense to say "Made in Quebec, Canada" and provide that in both French and English.
Please elaborate
Of course hard wood will be more slippery than carpeted fabric. Shouldn't be much discussion there. In either case treat stairs with respect and be careful (like don't run when your socks make it slippier).

Grew up with hardwood stairs, open (no railing), now live in a home with carpeted stairs with railing. Have slipped on carpeted more times probably because I feel there's no way I'll slip and move too fast on them, and it hurts less being fabric so I continue our to make the same mistake.

Carpeted will have their advantages for pets, disabled, elder, clumsy, etc, shouldn't be much discussion there. Still like the aesthetic of wooden but feel unsafe?? Find a solution that works for you and don't give a second thought if someone says it's silly.
> which means **running bare metal** if it's Nvidia. If it's AMD **make a VM for PleX** and hand it the GPU.

Eh, at least this is approaching regular prices we had at that time. 
Non-rgb version often hits that price, so you aren't too far off.
I guess so, and that's probably it, so that's cool, I'm down for preserving visuals. I know I've seen Blue Planet II hit ~2-3GB on this sub.
Dude, I know. I read the OP, maybe YOU should? And try reading my whole comment, too, please. You'd hopefully tell I didn't mistake this for a 22GB single episode.

quoting OP:
>File size is larger than a lot of other encodes on this sub but I was shooting to maintain quality.

Even OP admits this is high and I haven't seen a lot of 45min show uploads in HEVC hit this file size, so my question is within reason, too.
What made you choose ~2GB file size for each episode? I only ask to understand, not to criticize. As you say many shows encoded in x265 are smaller, they barely hit 1.5GB, and those that do are 1+hours, not 45minutes like Discovery. 

With so many varying x265 filesizes for movies and tv, it's hard for n00bs like me to tell what's too much or too little.

Edited: first sentence said "this file size", now it says "~2GB file size" to make it clear I know this is 11 episodes.....
Same-ish, in it feels like Steam, but different-ish at the same time. Which makes sense, they have a style they want to maintain, but wish to modernize.

Compared to [these screenshots from Summer 2017](https://imgur.com/a/hPXSV) and we've got a more subdued colour scheme dominated by Dark Blues with white. Bright blue tabs, and green buttons are gone. It feels darker and plain without that extra touch of colour.

The carousel of square tiles follows suit with a blue/white shade over the images. They've simplified the design by cutting down on certain elements like the outlines around the sidebar sections, and the individual "blocks" for each game (we still have highlight blocks for when the mouse is on an item).

It feels more modern, but I miss the touch of colour, and the header texts on the sidebar blends a bit too much with the background colour.

Ownership/Development of this one's changed a couple times, It probably still works well if you have an older copy from the original dev, but I really can't comment on its performance since then
Yeah, there's room to improve 2K/4K usage. You have a good point about the taskbar icons. I think the only solution we have is to increase dpi scaling.

But you're still asking for bigger icons? And to have live tiles on the desktop? ...but you seem to hate tiles (basically large icons) at the same time.

Anyway, yeah desktop  live tiles (or widgets basically) could be handy. Rainmeter is super popular for this reason. Personally, start menu works for me because there's rarely a time where I don't have something open, which means I can just pop open the start menu and not interrupt  my workspace. I don't use live tiles, but that's how I treat shortcuts. I have nothing on my desktop, because I open everything from the start menu. (Usually by typing its name, but I have a few pinned items)
> some of us are using 4k screens with tons of real estate. i wish MS would make better use of high def displays

What do you see as a solution to this? I ask because I'm confused. You seem disappointed to have 2 inch tiles (actually squares are 1 inch @100%) taking up screen space and say it isn't efficient. Then you also wish MS would make use of your 4k screen space?
Seeing everybody with dark themed Cortana on their start menus too.
> dark themes have crappy readability

I can't argue the well lit room and flux points, and while light vs dark is a lot of personal preferences I would be worried  that if it's actually hard to read for you, there may honestly be something wrong with your eyes?

It's not all about using dark themes in dark rooms either. I use Dark themes all day, brightly lit rooms, dark rooms, anywhere in between, no issue.
[Skype for Web](http://www.web.skype.com) has a dark theme.
>edge is used for a lot of background stuff

Such as...?
Cool. Apparently this is good for streamers/anybody who want to control settings for multiple c920 webcams as the Logitech software would link those changes to both.
Yup, the c922 has been out for over a year so it makes sense the c920 will drop, but slowly. I grabbed mine during Black Friday for 59.99 the same price I grabbed my c615 several years ago.
Having a Windows install customized to my needs is better for my mood. 

To each their own, really.

These things can be re-done/fixed.
I'll give it a try, thanks!
right, I meant more like HOW do you use it haha sorry
Stupid question: what do you do with this?
Holiday promotions are the best. Any other day and your bill would be doubled or more. I hope these Freedom promotions stick it to the big 3.
I've never had to beg. I call retention, point out that a competitor has a better deal/promotion, ask if they can match it. In my experience, they will match it. If I'm told they can't, then it's best to just hang up and try again because more than likely it was the service representative being difficult.
That's a good point. At least in Ontario we have both Loblaws and Real Canadian Superstore, I think it's Atlantic Superstore on the east coast?

Come to think of it they have a lot of different stores and names.  independents and valu-mart, and of course they own No Frills, T&T, zehrs, Fortino's, freshmart, Wholesale club... Shoppers........ and a bunch more other names in other provinces... it's pretty nuts when you stop to think about it.
>Biggest bullshit is removal of control panel link to settings for different background on multiple screens.

What's missing? In both Control Panel and the Settings I have to right click a photo and select "Set to Monitor 1" and then pick another for Monitor 2... This is on Win10 1709

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the issue?
Grew up using MSN, mIRC, ICQ, etc, and yeah afk and brb still mean the same thing. You'll be right back back... logging off/being offline never was a requirement...
What sort of visual feedback do you mean? I'm only half aware of some of the Google things going on at CES
Probably because it's a pretty empty comment on its own. Why is saying the movie "turned out **fine**" debatable? No one's saying it's the best thing since sliced bread. If they disagree, they should offer something.

At a quick glance, Rogue One appears to have [done well at the box office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_One#Reception), and beyond simple sale numbers, it seems to have been fairly well received, too (7.8 IMDb, 85% RT). So all in all, I'd say it appears to have done "fine".

Edit: fixed a word, added a link
I have a logitech g502 mouse. It has 3 side buttons, 2 are the usual, the third is set to middle click so that I can use it more often and more comfortably. 
Wow, that DARK CORE mouse is pretty sexy and looks comfortable with those side grips. I especially love the 3 side button layout.

I've been a hardcore fanboy for the Logitech G500 series mice and this is SUPER tempting.

I just don't know if I can give up my freescroll.

2010

They haven't ignored it, but haven't done anything huge. There have been a bunch of improvements since they first introduced the grey look in 2010. We didn't even have tabbed chat back then.
That meme's been around since the first Crysis.
> Crysis 3 

Well, see, no one specified WHICH Crysis until you did right there.
Can confirm.
Links work fine, and don't worry about the meta or order stuff. Not even your fault, and it's easily fixable by the user.

Basically how it works is Plex, a media library, will scan the folder, see S03E02 (ignoring the rest of the filename) and then ask TVDB what title and episode summary it should display. TVDB says S03E02 is "Subway" and gives a cover photo and summary.... But in reality the file is "Anger Management" so that's what you get when you hit play.
It's pretty easy to do the hack that gets custom skins to work (...Naturally, if you can't follow instructions and are severely technologically incompetent then you'll have a bad time.). The amount of custom skins out there for Windows 98 to Windows 8.1 is HUGE (probably 95 too I don't remember). There are some really nice ones, and something for every person's tastes.

Unfortunately, TileIconifier only changes Tile images (such as you see on the start menu), and doesn't come close to the level of customizing the other user was suggesting. You'd want something closer to CustomizerGod, which can replace icons and some images in DLL files, but can't do the imagery in Settings or similar areas of Windows 10.
Ok, so apparently the order is a bit wonky because of a few episodes. They aired with season 3, but Wikipedia and this pack leave them out, placing them at the end of season 2 instead.

Just keep this in mind... I found out when I added them to Plex and the metadata (titles, descriptions) got mismatched. 

The episodes are Subway, Panda's Friend, and Neighbors. Another user posted them here separately, so good on them and thanks to everybody posted these!

Edit: was confused but figured out the issue, now sharing what I found.

Either way, your screenshot didn't feel like the best example as it's almost identical to what we current have in mainstream FCU release. Smaller icons, with text beside them rather than below. ...and I know that image is from M$'s own blog to hype up the changes, so I'm not blaming you at all.

Yes, we're getting Fluent in Settings and that will make it pretty, but it's eye candy and it doesn't automatically mean everything is better. At least they're working at it, trying to find a design that can appeal to their modern ideas while satisfying all the nay-sayers that miss the "good old days".
This is great, you did an awesome job. Your drawing is amazing too by the way! I love that you posted so much of your progress. I hope you do more of these.

Many artists like to mix the pink and grey to get a nice medium consistency. I've done this and it's the best of both worlds for projects like this. Hard can be good on its own in places where there's fragile bits.

Another product (but not essential) people like to use is Aves "Apoxie Sculpt". It's a two part mixture and is pretty tough. I see it commonly used at the armature stage to solidify joints (hips,arms,etc) and again to do fragile bits (like the harder sculpey).
It doesn't show Domain/Workgroup stuff and doesn't have links to the System Properties window.
>it has even more system information than the 'old' one.

It appears to have traded Domain/Workgroup information for Windows version/build information. 

And no link to the System Properties like in the old.
I'm not sure what your screenshot is trying to show....? The other user has been using the Date & Time settings page as an example, while your screenshot is just the Settings "front page" which isn't even all that different than how it looks in FCU.

Lots of cool artists stream on Twitch and many have shots of their art/battlestations but you're right there need to be way more for inspirations sake :D
Do you stream when you make art? Twitch or somewhere else?
As an art person I love to see how the spaces they create in, and yes they'll be messy but inspiring and interesting. There should be a sub for this.
At least we can cast Twitch to Chromecast (for now anyway), unlike Amazon video
That whole album is surprisingly decent.
Yeah but other apps have no problem loading them as animations. Works fine in sync and boost for example.
Ah. In Canada they're just an income tax service.
I'm out of the loop. What is it about H&R Block that makes this malware?
Nougat was peak Blob, nearly the whole set was perfect, and they could have reached perfection in Oreo... instead they decided to start from scratch which apparently meant digging up a copy of Macromedia Flash (circa 2002) and putting it in the hands of an intern who has no idea how animals look in the real world.

I loved the blobs and I also don't mind Oreo's smileys even the people... but anything that's not a person is either dull, or poorly done. They ruined so many great designs that could have just been updated.
muting a channel stops notifications, but it still have the red unread bubble, and OP just wants an option to ignore those too. 

Sometimes you mute a channel and want to know if there's important things, other times you want to mute a channel to ignore it completely. You can't really do that, Discord will still keep count.
This isn't going to be a good option for all cases, like in OP's. 

Maybe you want pings, you want to be kept up to date... but not for that *one channel*. So you "mute" it... it's some topic/game you don't care for.

You will still see that red bubble counting all the pings and this adds to your overall unread count. IMO this makes the unread counter pointless if it can't ignore muted channels/servers. "oh hey I have 8 pings, oh nope it's the muted channel that I have to manually mark as read"


Sold, I assume?
That might do it! I have an old original G500 and the braid is near mint. Packing it up and moving it around a ton could easily wear the braided fabric.
**Dirk Gently season 2**

grabbed half from a thread that mysterious vanished, anyone know why?

files were labelled as 1080p x265 D0ct0rLew[UTR]

Edit: I wasn't crazy; [thread was deleted...](https://www.reddit.com/r/megalinks/comments/7l25z1/dirk_gentlys_holistic_detective_agency_season_2/)
Sure though I was specifically referring to the part where they said labelling this 2005 was stupid, when it's in fact standard practice to refer to shows by the year they began airing.
The year represents when a show first began, not the year of the specific season/episode.

It's more common to see years with movies, but for shows it can help differentiate between remakes, etc, or in this case "generations" (NewWho and ClassicWho).
Yeah, the video glitch is probably hard coded.
Watching the 1080 with PotPlayer, I noticed one video glitched toward the end. Audio sync seemed fine in potplayer.
I might have to try this. Does it "just work" or did you have to do an extra step?
Common or not, sounds pretty scummy. 
How the hell does something like that happen...?
That looks amazing! You did great. That extra blue really pops, and the rocks and shadows keep their natural colour and definition.
Yeah, it could be perfect if it wasn't such a strong touch-up. You could try going into Google Photos and manually adjusting the photo. Use their presets and just adjust the strength or go deeper with other tweaks if you feel creative.
Honestly I much prefer the unedited photo, but it's your call. I'd totally get either printed!
Do you know for sure the wireless doesn't work? Double checked on an xbox console?

Older Xbox One controllers don't support wireless with computers but the newer ones do.

Here's an [example picture comparing](http://digitalspyuk.cdnds.net/16/31/640x320/landscape-1470071350-xbox-one-s-controller-5.jpg) NEW (left) and OLD (right). Hint: Front body surrounds the XBOX guide button, old ones  will be a different glossy material.
adding that Wired XBOX 360 and XBOX One Controllers, 

or the XBOX One S controller wireless should work [S is the newer model. [Picture here](https://static.bfads.net/u/xbox-one-s-controller-2016-250-2.jpg) and [also here](https://compass-ssl.xboxlive.com/assets/0b/ab/0babba44-5eda-4d9e-9498-174dbb036bed.png?n=one-controller-bluetooth-comparison-l.png) should help if you're confused]
That's.... odd. No notable slow downs on my i5-6600k or my MUCH older Q6600 (with only 4GB RAM).
does it really struggle?
Eh, some strategically cut pieces of cardboard? Is yours entirely on the carpet or partly off like OP? If cardboard feels too cheap (I doubt anyone would notice) you could maybe grab some felt feet or something like it from a dollar store.
The only reason I see that kind of desk would wobble is because part is on rug, the other on flooring (like we see with OP). You'd just need to level out the feet somehow and be good.
Hues for both the red and blue? What bulbs or strips?  What's the setup/layout like?
I think Logitech changed their warranties some time between the Core and Spectrum. Core was out a while before the RGB thing took off.
Gifted it to a friend for his birthday for jokes and a group of 8ish or so of us (guys and gals) all played it. I'd say we got our money's worth of entertainment.
For Canadians, it will be $99 @ Best Buy during Christmas/Boxing Week.

Skins are nice and there are several good options.

However it doesn't excuse Steam from not updating their own interface.
Very true. Some complaints against a platform can still be valid. Like Steam's outdated interface ("skin"). When Origin was new there were a lot of things wrong with it, and I still wish it would snap to screen edges like a normal program. 

I haven't used uPlay a whole lot, but I think it went through similar growing pains as Origin did at the beginning.

Is the playlist set to private? I had the same problem but it appears to be fixed after setting it to Public.

Weird Playlists are private by default and my Mini played my other playlists without any issues. As soon as I requested my personal Christmas playlist she'd it gave me a radio *based on it* and she even said the exact playlist name when doing so!
> no title bar, and a goddamn hamburger button. That makes it feel very amateurish.

Firefox does this too?  Firefox and Chrome look *almost* identical **by default**. 

[It has no title bar](https://www.mozilla.org/media/img/firefox/hub/quantum/video-screenshots-poster.53338a3605e3.png) or Menu bar until you turn them on.

[Firefox also uses a "hamburger" menu (that has nested sub-menus)](https://cdn.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/photon-firefox-57-3-4.png) and has done so for a long time..... I like Firefox too, but why is Chrome amateurish for doing this but not Firefox?

Tabs are on top of one large omni-bar (for urls and search). Very similar idea to Chrome's layout.

The difference is Firefox can be customized which is nice, and it sounds like you've gone and personalized it to your tastes which is cool.

Anyone wishing to personalize or tweak Firefox's appearance should check out /r/FirefoxCSS (you should be somewhat comfortable with CSS)



What stands out the most for you in regards to interface?
I saw someone suggest wiping the bottom down with rubbing alcohol to clean it off which may allow something to stick better.
I gave it to my Mom as an early Christmas gift. Her sight isn't completely gone, but bad enough setting timers and even using the computer is pretty hard.

She loves this thing! Adopted to using it quickly. Timers, weather, music, the time. She has even called me from it! We've got IFTTT setup so she when she adds a shopping list item it's shared with me so I can do some errands for her.

Going to try some simple home automation in the future. She doesn't have a smart thermostat but that's coming soon judging by her enthusiasm toward the GHmini.
There was a bug in smaller windows where they would sometimes overlap with the search box and the other buttons. Had to do with longer channel titles. Not a big bug but it could be annoying depending on what servers you're in.
Yeah that doesn't sound so bad. I can see having a special situation where you need the extra data, but then not the rest of time. 
> 5 hours of data free.

Data measured in time. How in the world does that work?
How much are you paying for that 1GB? Last I checked in Ontario you can barely get 1GB plans at this price on a normal day unless you got lucky with retention or old plans.

I'd love plans to be cheaper, but if I'm paying the same I'd pick the higher data cap.
Yeah, only reason I dislike it is because the buttons are small (at least compared to others in Windows 10) and *they shrink with the UI.* 

Since they are small to begin with, going down to even 90% means you have to focus that much more. Imagine this at a smaller size, or try it out yourself. 

I also think they are a bit crowded together, but that's maybe more a mix of personal preference and my wishing they matched more closely to the native buttons in Windows.
Ah, you're right. I misunderstood, my bad. I thought it was loose when scrolling rather than clicking.

I don't click my middle  mouse at all ever since I've owned the original G500. Thumb button as middle click makes using it 1000x more comfortable for me.
I remapped the thumb button to middle mouse and use it all the damn time. Much more comfortable for me that way.
Sensitive scrolling with the Lock on? Like it's loose? I only have issues with the wheel when freescroll is on. 

~~What are your scroll lines set to? I think the default is 3?  Try changing that setting see if it helps.~~ 

Edit: disregard that. Misunderstood. Sorry.
Spectrum had a decent sale during Black Friday this year so there's a chance.
Ah, thanks. Yeah I bet it would especially be appreciated on larger displays/resolutions.
Acrylic will be new and noticeable. Maybe not to you, but some will notice. 
A bit vague. What do you want to see exactly?
Eh... Personally I'd be happy if it was bigger (and buttons further apart) to match title bars in other apps (I'm on W10 for reference) and **most importantly** not shrink when I scale down the rest of the UI. 
Not necessarily a good idea for every change, especially big and important ones.

Having one user interface lets them focus on looking forward when they add or improve features. It's just extra time and work to keep the old stuff and then to try to make every new change work with the older stuff. 

Here, I'd rather they just stick with one design and make it work and look good of which it sort of fails at a bit in each category.
I just want them to say they're working on fixing it. 

The old one had problems. The new one has problems.

Just please put effort into making something that works and looks good.


Last I checked, this was bugged. It goes away for a bit but comes back. 

Someone said Discord was aware of the issue and was working to fix it.
Yeah haha. Seems like it'd be hard to beat at this price.
What's a good alternative to this? Roku? I was considering this for just  a simple Netflix device any other stuff isn't super important especially at this price range. I know I'd get tons of features at a higher price range. 

Thoughts?
OP is using the beta, which they didn't specify, so not your fault that you didn't know. 

Search is different in beta it's had a significant face lift. 
You should make an edit to your post if you can. Explain that you had filters on.

It's too bad it remembers your last search filters and what you typed.. Makes it a bit confusing at first. I guess I can understand why it remembers but it would be easier in these cases if it didn't.

We already have the option to defer "feature" updates, which still allows the important security updates to come in, but skip a major update like FCU for a while. I'm not sure it's clear how long this holds off the feature updates, so that could use some work.
I get this issue too! 

I'll Remote to my family's computer from mine and they will have a black screen afterwards, requiring a manual reboot using the switch on the tower.

My machine is Win10 and the family pc isn't, so I thought maybe that had something to do with it. Are both of yours on 10 or different?
Any idea how it's done now? How does it integrate GMail? I'm not able to test it myself for now.
Depends on your use and what you care about. c922 does 60fps @ 720p (vs c920's 30fps), has slightly better low light, and slight improvements in colour. It also has green screen style background remover software, but not perfect, so I wouldn't decide on that feature alone. c920 has a blue "in use" light, c922 has a white-ish yellow light I think. 

Check YouTube for video comparisons. 
Here are some alternate options while you wait for your wish to one day become true.

*Ctrl+Tab* to go down the list

*Ctrl+Shift+Tab* to up up the list

*Ctrl+K* then type a friend's name and hit *Enter* (or select their name with the mouse) to go to DMs
Or 2 fingers at once in an up or down motion. 

Anyway, I guess some older or budget laptops do nothing.
That's weird I woke up to find Google Now displaying the very same article as OP. I never get unrelated garbage article like your Kardashian example. Obviously everyone's experience may vary.

>Heatgun will easily melt the plastic

Which is why I said SAFE distance. I didn't say they are the same, but the result can be similar. 

Heat gun is obviously **way** more powerful and you'd need to operate it carefully and further from the mini in short passes, while a hair dryer could be used longer and closer. 

Certain DIYers/hobbyists and the like might have either laying around. 
Cool, sounds interesting! Thanks a lot!
For your followup video, can you explain the resistors a bit more for us n00bs and show us the complete wiring setup? This video you jump from adding the resistors to already half of the mini put back together.

Thanks for the video by the way it's really awesome. 
Neat night light - where'd you get it?
I assume a hair dryer or heat gun (at a safe distance) would also work with removing the orange pad rather than the boiling water trick?
Whatever happened to AliQ :(
It would be smart to even say what the recipe** IS** like say in the title or at the very least along with the recipe.

Eh, they had to know they'd lose that lot when they chose Capaldi. It's not a misstep if they understand that the show must keep evolving. It's the very nature of the Doctor and to keep with the cute boy trend would be simply pandering.

Well the user you were replying to in the first place DID mentioned brown water.
Check through the Origin client, ME3 DLC shows up under Extra Content for me.

Be warned you need Bioware Points to purchase, which some find to be too much of a headache to bother with. (If ye get me drift, matey. Arrr.)

I recommend at least the Citadel DLC, it's fun.
Your screenshots all look clear to me.

> Who wants to go to leave your house and go to the store just to get a glass of water?

Apparently people who have concerns about their brown water... They're also buying 20L which is WAY more than "just a glass of water".
What nestle is doing is pretty scummy, but honestly I'd drink it before I ever drank Dasani. I could never finish drinking a bottle of theirs. Other people seem to drink just fine. I guess everyone's taste buds are a little different?
My town's water tastes sort of off to me. Growing up, my family had a farm that was on a well and that tasted better but we also frequently bottled our own water from a spring that I still go to. It's a bit of a drive but tasty.
They actually added BattleEye sometimes in the last couple months 
So, I really have to ask, you know just in case.....

The Start menu is sluggish? How so???
I don't know anything about this show, but I found reading the comments between you two funny, sad, and frustrating. It's like you both watched a different show.
>Well, it's been on the fringes of popularity in the states since...the 70s.

True, but I was referring to within the scope of the show since its revival in 2005. And my point was that it wasn't necessarily "hurting" before Moffat, but there's no denying Moffat did wonders for the show's success.  RTD did a fine job to get it off the ground with Eccleston as Nine, then Tennant as Ten. 

Moffat saw to it that it grew even larger after that, with Matt Smith's young "cool" Doctor, and Karen Gillan's long legs and red hair, their quirky attitudes combined, all did wonders in bringing a ton more fans into the Who-niverse.
Start Menu, Task bar, jump lists... etc.
IMO, any decent Hangouts replacement would require a video calling feature.
The list view just isnt the same as pre-10 start menus. You can't have small icons and organization options are limited.

Personally, for my uses I've adapted to tiles and things but can see a lot of issues if you're more of a list person.
Well yeah. My point was that they would either have to allow crosstalk between Allo and Hangouts(GMail), or replace Hangouts with Allo completely. (I don't think Allo is in a position to completely replace Hangouts just yet.) Either of those things would be really huge news.

I'm not sure Google will choose either of those paths for multi device support if/when it happens. They may simply allow sign ins to Allo using Google accounts so tablet/web users can chat without their phones. Who knows...
Trying to organize your start menu shortcuts your own way? Ha good luck. Want subfolders? Nope. Fuck you we're going to just clump all the shortcuts under the first folder.

(Example can't have Games>Steam, they will ignore Steam and all show under Games)
But don't you need to go into file explorer to do this?
>Bring the show to a level of popularity in America that's never been seen before?

To be fair, It was already gaining popularity. North America had been watching since 9 just like across the pond.   Moffat still did an excellent job at expanding its popularity and keeping Who on the air. 
I use Hangouts almost everyone and while I haven't done group video calls, one on one work well with the exception being that it can forever for the ringer to stop even after answering (wtf).
We should all hangout and see what we come up with.
Hangouts is pretty nice and having IM and video in one app just feels right and flows really well from desktop to phone.
This was probably your point, but yeah, GIFs these days are just short, soundless videos. (Because html5)
Thanks for doing this you glorious people/companies!

Cool new design ya got there!
You should check out  *An Adventure in Space and Time*, it's a docudrama where he portrays Hartnell. It was made around the time of Doctor Who's 50th anniversary.
> Correct but it is also going to replace Hangouts completely in the future

By the time they add the features necessary to replace Hangouts (not even talking SMS), they'll launch a new chat app and the cycle will begin anew. 
> Gmail chat integration would be killer but I don't think this is it yet.

Since GMail chat is presently tied with Hangouts, Allo+GMail integration would be HUGE news.
Might be related to that **v.redd.it**  bug in that other thread

Lots of people having errors right away, my experience was more like yours

I get wanting to "hack" the Steam Link, but like you said it's not powerful enough on its own. It would be pretty easy to do what you want if you incorporated a pc into the equation.

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Couldn't you just stream kodi or whatever from your PC to the Link?

I was waiting on Xposed, which I guess sorta works now, but also just lazy. It's holding up okay for its age. 
Sounds like you're both using "almost lost" in different ways. In your case it was lost then found, and in the Disney case it would have been lost if that person hadn't recorded it.

You would almost miss the bus by catching it at the last second or maybe meeting it at the next stop. 
More specifically water and electricity are a nasty combination.
The phone might be waterproof, but that's not a guarantee the tech inside is as well.
>literally any other piece of technology is fine spraying water on.. but not PCs

Why? How about don't get any electronics wet? Never get tech wet unless you absolutely know what you're doing or it's built for it.

*If something does get wet*, it's not necessarily the end of the world.  Especially if it wasn't powered (electricity is the enemy). Like how you put phones in rice, you need to get your electronics completely dry. Make sure all the water has evaporated or there will be corrosion at which point you can kiss your tech goodbye.
I've seen people swap out the g502 wheel for the older g500 wheel which is plastic with a rubber grip.
I was wondering if you could do that, or if they were both assigned the same button IDs.... But yeah it could be sort of awkward, maybe not. Neat idea.
Seems pretty in tact to me still. What do you think is disappearing?
Hmm, interesting thought. Where else should I look? It'd help if OP had posted an example....

Game + Season Pass on Steam is ~18 (canadian) - seems like a decent deal if I wanted to grab it all?

Exactly my point. It listens and only sends your questions (or whatever). Some people think it's sending EVERYTHING all the time. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
> The G900 has free scroll and thumb buttons. **Not as many as the G502 though**

Yup, exactly my point. 2 side buttons is ideal starting point, 3 is a dream. (and others besides the G900 and that wireless one don't have freescroll)

I get to "update" with "Check for Updates" as the result, once I add the **s** at the  end, it suggests Java "Check for Updates" as Best Match, listing 5 other results, all Windows related update links under the heading "Settings"
I know people say the G502 is heavy, but having that extra thumb button and free scroll.... mmmmmm.... yeah that's good stuff.
NSA employees have to pass the time somehow and that means messing with your ability to turn on your cool wall lights via voice commands.

*"Ha they think if they repeat the command for the 7th time it will finally work! ... Now wait 30 seconds and turn them on. That'll really upset them!"*
Well yeah, that's its purpose. The device is waiting for you to "wake it up" by saying "Hey Alexa/Google". We shouldn't be surprised it's listening. 

The part that gets people is it also records and sends your questions to Google/Amazon. Again, this is how these devices work their magic, shouldn't be too surprising. Some people will still be understandably cautious of this detail. There's even concerns that these devices might be sending everything they hear, *but that would be noticeable or at least easy enough to check.*

I'm guessing the typical recordings are stuff like "set timer for 15 minutes", or "How big are Scarlet Johansson's boobs?"... Mundane stuff like that. 

We've already got lots of mics in our lives: phones, cars, webcams, and security systems. This is one more to be cautious of and if you're a privacy enthusiast, then yeah... you probably won't want this but already know it. 
Province? I'm in ONT.
I'm seeing $179 here as well. Ontario.

Yeah that's why I said "Even if you're streaming". We're talking about the Steam Link after all, which streams from a PC somewhere.
My point was that you may not see a use in it, but this doesn't mean it is useless for others as well. 

Blind or not, timers, music, weather, reminders, etc are Echo and Home's basic uses. Why should I pull out my phone if I'm cooking just to set a timer? What if my phone's in the other room charging or I'm just not carrying it? Maybe I just want a music speaker I can talk to.

My phone's old and I'd rather not bother with it lagging out while I ask it a question. $40 seems reasonable for a little hockey puck size speaker that can do all that. 
It probably doesn't cost them a ton to make such a small niche product.

Wireless VR, eh? Even if you're streaming it, wouldn't that be technically demanding?
Wired works pretty great, and it's a pretty neat little device to play games on, even stream my desktop. It's not for everyone, but lots of people seem to enjoy it.
In my case, I bought a mini for my nearly blind mother who doesn't have a cell phone and she will be using it to set timers and reminders, ask about the weather, and play music. Eventually she'll be set up with a smart thermostat too and she'll be able to set and check the temperature.

Sure there will be people who find them useless. I personally have no use for a Chromecast but there are tons of people who swear by them so in the end you just gotta be you and let others be them.
Those sold so quickly! I wish I had caught one.

I need to wash mine but I'd be cautious of using the washing machine no matter what brand. Since yours was a generic brand, maybe the heat from the water was too much for the cheaper adhesive? Or perhaps it was the force of the agitation from the machine.

I'd treat it mine like a delicate item and fill a storage container with warm water and detergent, agitate it lots and let it soak.
I don't recall any major hijack issues other than your typical phishing schemes.
Looks like only 2 of 11 gaming mice listed on their site have it.

Besides, I said freescroll AND extra side buttons are what keep me using those specific mice.
I enjoy the smoothness it allows and can control it well with my finger.

The only time I'd call it unwieldy is when I spin it wildly, but that is obviously on purpose.
Well they both have freescroll if that helps
What happened on Steam?
The freescroll wheel on the g502 is also a really nice feature for web browsing and stuff.
I wish more mice had the freescroll option and extra side buttons. I see no shortage of nice mice out there but those features are why I stay with my g500 and g502.
Dang, Out of Stock. Not surprised though, great price!
I've been using "Piktures" since the fall of QuickPic and it has Name, Date, Size, Last Modified; all having the option for Ascending or Descending.

Yeah good thing Steam has improved since the original 2010 overhaul.

While we're talking 2010 and computers... Windows 7 had just come out, Google releases their first Android phone, the Nexus One, and Apple gives us the first iPads. FCC was fighting FOR Net Neutrality. How things change.
You might want to consider something between ant size and monstrous. 

Can't see how you benefit from posting it at that resolution anyway since everything (minus the phone rendering) is either blurry or jaggy.
Yep, all my tabs went black.
Sure, but I fail to see how that directly relates to your comment about Steam for PC

Isn't the general consensus that there are better 3rd party reddit apps? There's a bunch of good options on Android, not completely up to date on iOS options.

You mean 2010 when it was released? And even then it's gone through changes since then. Look back at the 2010 version when it was brand new. Much uglier than today, so that says something.

Looks like those sold out. 

You can tell because the listing no longer says "Sold by Amazon"  (not to be confused by Fulfilled by Amazon)
Yeah, OP wants it for Links.

Edit: Sale is for "Sold by Amazon" products, so if you don't see that and the price higher, it probably sold out.

Seems that one's probably sold out now.

White, Blue, Red, Grey-Green, Green-Orange, and Winter Forces appear at $45. The prices go up to $59 Patrol Tech then $69 for Minecraft designs.
That makes sense.
That won't get the "open links when you tap the thumbnail" part of OP's request.
Half way there. OP wants an option for the "thumbnails" to open the links, while the title opens the comments. Like how image posts will open the picture, when you tap the thumbnail, but comments open from tapping the title.

Sync does this, apparently, and it's not a bad idea for consistency.
No problem. Don't sweat it. 

If it's brand new (and by **Microsoft**) you won't have to worry! They should all be this design no matter what colour: black, white, red, blue, Minecraft.

Only exception the way more expensive Elite controller. 
Oops sorry I forgot to say which is new and old .

No - the newer one is on the LEFT, with the XBOX logo piece being part of the main body.
Lots of gadgets can prove pointless to people who don't have a use for it, and that's okay. 

In this case: Want to play some video games on the TV, but your PC is in a different room? Steam Link! Especially handy for when you have guests over and want to play party/co-op games. 

It's not even restricted to video games, that's just its main use scenario because it's a STEAM product. You can also access your desktop and do other PC stuff.
All you have to do is either setup shortcuts on Steam to open non-steam games, or minimize Steam and access your desktop. 
Yes. Any new Xbox One controller by Microsoft should be the "Xbox One S" version and support bluetooth.

You should find controller for like $45/50 at WalMart during Black Friday sales

Easiest way to tell is [compare the two in this photo:](https://cdn1.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2016/07/Xbox-One-S-Bluetooth-Controller-5.jpg) 
Left is New - Right is Old.

On the LEFT the area around the XBOX logo is part of the front piece of the body. 
On the RIGHT, that XBOX logo area is part of the **shoulder** section, glossier and has 1 diagonal line at each shoulder, and a different colour if the controller isn't plain black. 

[Another illustration (bottom is new)](https://compass-ssl.xboxlive.com/assets/0b/ab/0babba44-5eda-4d9e-9498-174dbb036bed.png?n=one-controller-bluetooth-comparison-l.png)
I mean, yeah, I guess? I'm not sure what you were expecting from it, but it does what it's meant to do well enough (stream your Steam gaming from PC to your TV)  and with decent controller support too.
to fix that you gotta turn off film grain in settings.
Nuts. Any guess how long it's been in Canada? Since I heard the echo was coming to Canada I've been hoping it would integrate with Audible, but that looks like a work in progress coming later. Ugh. Such is life as a Canadian.
Any luck? My mom has a US Audible account, looks like they recently made Audible Canada available?? Hmm.. 
Nah, it's not necessarily light and fan. It can be whatever. My front entryway has 3 light switches for example.

While yes, it would make sense to distinguish them, it's custom built by OP, and they must know which button does what. The buttons are out of the way because they wouldn't want just anyone pressing them, and they only need them at times like powering up, or blue screen errors. 
It's not too difficult to figure out. Platformers can be pretty straight forward if you're just learning.
Chromecast prices drop during sales all the time, can't see why the Home would be any different. But yeah, also trying to beat Amazon. I'm going to get one of each, Alexa and Google, and let them battle to the death.

I noticed a few sound bars, as someone who hasn't paid much attention in that area of tech - what's looking good?
Stock wasn't so bad last year I think the sale ran out before stock did, by then with prices the way they are, more people may be looking to pounce on deals.
It's just the one nightstand actually.
Yeah, and surely we can have colour and personality while still meeting today's minimalistic trends.... but no, we have to have black, white and greys... even bookmark folders are greyscale now. 

Where's the "Firefox" flair that sets it apart from other programs?
I'm simply shocked they went with the high contrast black and white look in general. It's just so hard on the eyes.
Depends on your tastes.

I'd rather have aero on and use a few lines of custom CSS to fix the issue. Luckily it was a quite easy to fix.
Those do nothing but add a background image. Doesn't really improve things at all.
I think Hitler had a fuller, more normal, mustache during WWI and didn't adopt the iconic "toothbrush" stache until later.
It's so plain, and like 96.7% colourless, even the bookmark folders are black and white. All the colour must have gone into that new logo.
weird, looks fine on my windows 7 machine
>Still, if you like the old themes and styles, I don't see what the better alternative is. 

...

>It would have been nice if they had an official "classic" theme or two at launch.

That would have been a good alternative. Or at the very least not sucking all the colour and personality out of of their design or just simply allowed some easier form of customization beyond css editing.
How can adapt this to change all folders to use a custom image?
Do you just want a button that displays your bookmarks? There's a button for that in the Customize window. 

3 Line Menu > Customize > look for "Bookmarks Menu" (star with line underneath), drag it where you would like it
Just want search? Why not set your preferred search engine as your home page.
Do they still look this way with the default theme and all your userChrome.css customizations turned off?
Yep, looks like it's related to whatever Windows theme you're using. Do your other programs look like that?
Honestly if it's an issue you encounter a lot then it certainly would merit a post so that others who have the same problem can chime in and know they aren't alone. It has a higher chance of getting buried in an unrelated thread.
Nah. It's orange and on Hoth so that's a Snowspeeder.
Poser and hoser are sort of different though
It sure looks wrong.

 Maybe they meant it like "Hey", but why not just say hey? I use it as a sort of "meh" sometimes, like a sort of "so-so" intention. "Ehhh, that pizza tasted okay". Wouldn't try to force an Eh at the end of that though.
I guess your point was lost on me. The way I read your comment I thought you were linking a screenshot.

Taking out the DashPlaylist part leads me to a Prairie Dog video on r/aww  ...  What does that have to do with imgur and OP's issue?

It also frequently went on sale during early access for 50-70% off its EA price ( coming to as low as ~$10) . Its more recent sale had it at $30 (50% release price).

I just hope the new price tag is worth it. 
>there are a lot of cashgrab games out there. 

Sure, like releasing a new CoD game every year.
Don't forget they did that AND doubled the price for full release.
make sure it's in [profile folder]\chrome\ not just the base profile folder

Any tips on how I might simply change the color of the line at the top of tabs from Blue to whatever?
>No, but it will have stickers. Lots of stickers.

Sticker loot crates.
I tried them all before my first post. Default, light, and dark, they were all white - only the custom themes had dark crosses. 

With some CSS help from people on here, I got it looking much better.
This helps a lot, thank you!
You can remove/hide most of those:
Home, Pocket, History&More, and sidebar
Any way to tweak the new tab button? thinking a dark colour rather than the current light or maybe have it resemble the tabs.
I assume using middle click is out of the question?
Wow the folder icon thing is handy! Could something similar be done for the main menu icons? The black and white look is really bland.
You can add a Bookmark icon like what you want 

Menu>Customize>find Bookmark button and drag it where you want.
3 dot menu at top > hide read.
Those lines have been in Firefox for a while.
>By default it can reinforce bad habits.

My point is that the bad habit already exists. Yes it does reinforce it, but you can't lay all the blame on this page which you can use as tool for good.

A blank page is a totally valid option, but pinning sites might be more beneficial depending on the circumstances. If you pin useful pages then it would encourage productive habits by having useful sites right in front of you.

>You can remove them temporarily but they creep up on the list again soon enough.

If Firefox's dismiss option only temporarily forgets a site, then it should really consider a more permanent option. I believe if you tell Chrome to remove a site, it's more permanent.
The 3 lines top right, that's the Menu. You can also right click an empty space on your tab bar to reach the Customize page.

[Customize should be half way down that "Hamburger" menu.] (http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/news2/firefox-57-quantum-web-browser-now-available-to-download-here-s-what-s-new-518521-4.jpg)
Yeah I hide the top and bottom bar, and the FAB. All I see is pure reddit content most of the time.



I think I'll stick to just letting the icon light up the way it does now without this badge. It's cool that you're implementing it for those that want it though.

On the topic of notifications... I think it'd be nice if we could turn off unread counts for muted channels. There are a lot of "spammy" channels that I want to mute, but still receive notifications from the rest of the server. It would cut down on my unread count by a lot.
At least I hear we can turn this off if we choose (such as in the case you have 1000's of notifications)
I just turned off the stuff I didn't like. This is something they don't mention until the very end of article. Then there's this part...:

>The act of opening a new tab is already a distraction that moves focus away from what you’re doing. [...] Seeing icons for Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other time-sinkholes was already quite distracting.

Ok. Hang on. First, if you're seeing Facebook, Twitter, etc, it means you're already visiting those sites the most. Second, you should be able to either hide those sites from the list or better yet pin sites you SHOULD be visiting.
I think I've seen some posts about how to make the menus dark with the custom CSS, I'm going to try some out today.
Anything that's click able? Ok let's see if I got this:

So a typically setup might be: Tab, close tab button, new tab button, Back, Forward refresh, site security padlock, address bar, bookmark this page, (any extensions you haven't hidden), menu. 

Like that??

And then I think Firefox has a couple extras that you can't hide through normal customization. Address bar drop down arrow, and the 3 dots. 

Like that?

It's hilarious how, when you activate Dark mode, the Customize window changes to this dark grey but that's the only thing really other than the tabs that change..... Not options windows or the menu... What a tease!
> There's useless stuff in the general UI. They try to be minimalistic, but they don't manage to do it. Yeah it's less clutter than before, but so much useless things. When having 1 page open, **Chrome has 13 buttons, Firefox has 17.** Both are too many in my opinion, but Chrome still doing better.

What do you count as buttons?
It's actually a specific casting SDK (Google Cast) and isn't necessarily interchangeable with other ways of casting or receiver devices.
It's actually Google Cast these days and work with a variety of devices, including the Chromecast.
Can you share a screenshot? I'm interested in what you came up with. I'm not a fan of the new, square, bland, monotone look.
I actually preferred how the previous Firefox had colour and personality to its UI. This is just white and blacks which is too much high contrast for my tastes. The new Firefox logo is so jazzy but the UI of the browser feels a bit bland.

Minimal and plain are trends I hope we can grow out of a bit.
Or skip that menu and add the Bookmark button directly to your addressbar.
You can add a Bookmark icon like what you want
Menu>Customize>find Bookmark button and drag it where you want.
I think Garden Warfare might have been given away at some point in the past, so it may come around again.... some day.
>  these UI changes go under a lot of testing and feedback before being released to the general public as the standard version.

I feel like the interface still has some things to iron out and work on -
 despite testing and feedback. 

Take Dark mode for example, you see the Customize page change to grey but other pages like Options and AddOns don't change to fit the dark mode. Menus also don't change, they remain the stark, blinding white.
Menu>Customize

Themes box at the bottom > select "Default", or "Light".

Funny you had Dark on by default.
> it doesn't show my most visited sites in general when I open a new tab.

Try the Cog in the top right corner, then turn on Top Sites. Funny it wasn't on by Default...
It's not bad but also a bit bland at the same time?

The [menu's jet black icons](https://cdn.ghacks.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/photon-firefox-57-3-4.png) on white background feels a bit harder on the eyes than the softer grey icons from before. 

Options window is also just plain off-white, the [old grey sidebar](http://techdows.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/changing-Firefox-preferences-from-tab-to-window.png) was kinda nice. Added some personality. Also if you set the theme to Dark the Customize page changes with a dark background, but options and similar pages don't?? I guess they have some things to iron out. 
Haha ohh. Carry then!
Eh, this looks totally fixable. 

Adjust the color temperatures, then some minor adjustments to their RGB settings until they LOOK the same, the RGB levels won't match exactly. Every monitor is slightly different.
One monitor is likely set to warm tones, the other to cool. 

Edit: I have a similar LG monitor at work, there's color temperature settings. They can totally be adjusted to match closely.
We still probably shouldn't encourage buggy early release games with these types of awards no matter how popular. It would set a bad example.
90 minutes of Link breaking pottery and being chased by chickens (set to Benny Hill music)
The space shows up when Firefox isn't maximized. It's for dragging the window around.
Pinned tabs don't fill that space. It's meant for dragging the window.
simple solution would be to watch the movie
Why not a series of Zelda movies? Lots of stories to go around. Similar to the games, each one take on a different style.

Edit: shorts might be better
Yeah working with the Schulz family helped a lot. No doubt Nintendo will have a lot of say on this project with Illumination.

Something I wish had happened with the modern Dr Seuss' movies. Blue Sky's Horton Hears a Who and then Illumination's The Lorax.
No, Win7 is not obsolete, and Firefox isn't "entirely new" software. Win7 is supported and you get the update just like everyone else, so why not take it into consideration a bit?

Its userbase ranks significantly high and is still commonly used. Much more common due to users sticking with it through the Windows 8 era. You can find various statistics back this up whether it's w3's browser use stats or Steam's surveys or another statistic aggregation site.

I wouldn't begin to consider it obsolete until 2020 when extended support ends.

Please tell me there's an option to not have it at all.
I don't think it should look that way. What Windows are you on? Is it a classic or custom theme you're using with Windows?
I had the same problem as OP. Restoring to defaults worked after restarting the browser.
I'd love it if the new tab button wasn't just a white + which is difficult to see on Windows 7's aero glass. 

Would be a good improvement for those with poor eye sight, I bet.

Maybe an option to switch it to the dark + you get in custom themes, or if it were more like a tab/button... anything to help it stand out.
I have a few packs that all have Discord icons, so it's certainly not "absolutely no icon packs".

You can try to request one. Lots of icon pack artists have a way to submit icon requests. 
I ran into this tonight. In my case, I only had black bars if I entered fullscreen through theater mode first. Without theater mode, it filled the screen completely.

The simplified horse model from before wasn't great. The head wasn't a horse head. As that goes, this is a bit of an improvement.
Yeah, exactly my point. The moment you put it on reddit it becomes a form of this "outward attention" that you describe. 

I don't feel comfortable lumping everything in on the same level as the terrible Calvin peeing sticker.
They MIGHT have made some change off traffic to their site (there's no ads now, but there may have been once upon a time), but that's if you got that far.  Still not at all worth saying things like "Bill should burn down this guy's house"
>I don't think he's talking about merchandising.

It depends who we're talking about, the higher comment that lead here says

> "a well done sequel and/or at least a little well done merchandise would be nice."

while the reply says 

>"a toy, even home made, ruins that."
I know what you mean. They start with fan art and their talent grows and they keep drawing and creating new unique stuff until they're making the next generation of cartoons.

Someone actually said they hope Bill burns their house down for doing this comic. I know fandoms can be intense, I guess C&H fandom isn't excluded from that.
Why is it off putting to see an adult making jokes?

You realize the comics were written by an adult, right?
There **is** a line. The Calvin peeing stickers crosses it in many ways. I don't think every piece of fan art should be tossed in the same category.
Yeah, Calvin and Hobbes inspires generations of readers to imagine and create.

I don't think we should hate on every piece of C&H fan art that we see. There's definitely a line as with any intellectual property, monetization and distastefulness come to mind. However it feels really wrong to see threads like this with artists being called talentless hacks and their creations labelled blasphemous.  Some of these things are done by honest fans, and getting crucified by people who share the same interest must suck.
Mr. Watterson's comic inspired many to use their imagination and create. I find it hard to take such a strict stance against any and all fan creations. 

All those people who create plushies and posting it here on Reddit? They are taking intellectual property, Hobbes, and gaining fame (karma and views). People who do wall murals and tattoos, and even kids drawings. They are all done out of love and passion and shared to others to spread the love and bond with others.

They don't deserve to be thrown into the same category as "Calvin peeing" sticker.
I don't think he's made any statements against fan art. Has he? (Correct me if I'm wrong) He was against licensing C&H out for toys and merchandising, cartoons, and things. Totally understandable. 

C&H is such a beloved comic that's inspired generations of kids to laugh, explore. It only makes sense that artists that grew up on it would want to pay tribute in various ways. It wouldn't feel right to think of Mr. Watterson being against fan art in such a broad sense.
Could even be Francine. 
Burn down his house? I don't think Bill would go for that. I get not liking it, but that's not cool.

>The idea that Calvin would be the same person at 6 and as an adult is **retarded**.

Same person? He's still Calvin, and allowed to make jokes whether he's 6 or 96. Adults make jokes. An adult wrote Calvin & Hobbes for crying out loud.

>You know who I knew when I was that age? Fuck no. Most people don't.

I know and have even run into bunch of people I knew from a young age, I think that's totally going to be a personal  thing and it's odd to expect our own experience be reflected in someone else's work. 

>I hope Bill Watterson finds the artist and **burns their house down.**

**Wow** - you're taking this waaaayyy too far!!! Bill and C&H encouraged us to laugh, play, to imagine, and create. I think the only destruction I think Bill caused would be Calvin's playtime.

You know this is fanart, it's not meant to replace the original, or continue it in any official way. Just a tribute with a fanciful "what if" scenario. Not really uncommon thing to imagine what characters would do in certain scenarios and to have fun with it. Lots of artists like to draw their favorite stuff and share it.

Edit: took out the less important bits. 
>Doubt it he seemed very private. Think he stopped mostly because of over comercelisation.

I'm not sure how that factors into whether he likes or dislikes a bit of fanart. The artist probably grew up reading Calvin and Hobbes, and it very well was one of many things that inspired them to pick up a pencil, to begin drawing, creating, and imagining. I like to think as artist Bill would understand that much, and that the thought of some fan art doesn't keep him up at night. 

I do believe Bill would also encourage the artist, or whoever, to find their own voice and style, rather than relying on the work of others, and they'd be happier in the long run for doing so.
Care to elaborate?
>Watterson retired about a decade before mashup/remix culture really took off.

There were plenty of times comic strips would include nods/tributes to others. It wasn't a new concept, but they likely had to tip-toe around licensing and copyright. 
"Concept art is a form of illustration used to convey an idea for use in films, video games, animation, comic books, or other media before it is put into the final product."
Yeah, that's not what concept art is, tribute is a better word. Maybe you mean it's conceptual like it follows a "What If" idea? 
> These are fucking atrocious.

That's pretty harsh.
If you're saying the game list is short, then you can try to remove "Tasks" shortcuts you don't use (Store, Friends, Community, those type of things). Go to Steam Settings>Interface>Taskbar Preferences (button at bottom).

It's also possible to tell Windows you want the list to be longer.

Apparently IIII was more common in Ancient Rome, and the "subractive" way (IV = 5-1) for SOME numbers was only an alternative way of writing. They were a bit inconsistent and it wasn't until much later that people attempted to standardize Roman numerals, to avoid confusion. 

Source: Reddit thread, ["Why is 8 in Roman numerals VIII, when IIX is shorter?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/2d8ed2/why_is_8_in_roman_numerals_viii_when_iix_is/cjnyelf/)

yeah it's a duller, more distressed sort of blue than 11 and 12's which were very clean. 13's reminds me of 9/10's for colour, but then it also had a dull/dirty look in classic Who  too. The smaller details definitely appear to pay homage to the more classic TARDISes

Forget the splitter. You don't need it for 2 monitors and the 460 you have all the ports you need on the video card.
>VGA to HDMI 

DVI to HDMI would make more sense. 
Your new monitor might have DVI, it's pretty common, you may even get a cable. Depends on the monitor....

If for some reason the monitor doesn't have DVI, and HDMI is your only option, then DVI to HDMI adapters exist.

Post pictures, but there's probably at least another output, like DVI.
 Native support means you can assign button X to "Open Map" or "Jump" rather than "spacebar". If a game supports it you can do nice things like different configurations based on context like if you're in a vehicle or a menus, etc. The Steam Controller also has a slightly different rumble system, game can take advantage of that. I think games can also include icon sets to be used in touch menus. Someone who's used their controller more with supported games could explain it better
Yes, exactly the point. The only difference I see is the menu bar is put at the bottom on my phone. 

Wow, lazy much, Humble Bundle?


I think the question was more about (generally speaking) what uwp apps are better than their win32 counterparts. Not just the color pickers, but yeah the Photoshop color picker is pretty solid.
I think the point is it wouldn't hurt to add HEX and even CMYK. HEX is common, it's been part of Photoshop's color picker for a LONG time. Whatever we might want to use it for doesn't matter and MS has even made these updates this with their modern color picker.
> Please, there are more crap .exes out there than there are apps on the Windows store.

In all fairness, executables have been around FOREVER, and support a range of Windows versions. UWP apps are relatively new and are still gaining traction (and limited to W10). 
So, the biggest difference is the Chromecast gets content streamed (casted) to it from apps on other devices, phones, tablets, etc.

Roku and Amazon's device have the apps on the devices themselves.

As for performance, I think we have to wait for some reviews to pop up.
I think it's more comparable to a Roku?
I feel like it's been a lot longer than that.
Bzz Bzz this thread is swarming! Good luck everyone, THANKS OP!

>it’s pretty obvious that the singular they is going to become an established part of the English language whether or not people want it to.

Hasn't it been established for a long while though??

Coincidentally I had a similar conversation with my mother (born in the 40s) a month ago. She stopped to correct me when I used they (singular) and I explained how common it was. She just looked at me like I was from another planet, while I had a similar reaction to her confusion¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
There's code to detect devices. You can have a "mobile" layout while still having a "desktop" layout. This sort of thing has existed for a LONG time.
A bit off topic, but the new layout for navigating their "Current Bundles" is a bit much. The "cards" seem unnecessarily HUGE. Seemed simpler to navigated when you had the smaller links along the top.
I was wondering why every shortcut had to be in those blue boxes with dashed outlines. My eyes feel tired after reading through just part of the list.
@bottom: Why not just go ESDF at that point

But, like, whatever, just use whatever is comfortable, dude
Some essential information you might want to add: 

The newer XBox One S controllers support Bluetooth. No need for the Microsoft USB adapter if the controller is new. You also say "PS4 controllers now also have an available wireless USB adapter". That's great and all, but it's worth noting that Bluetooth adapters are a whole lot cheaper (this goes for the xbox adapter too). 

I think as adapters go, at least the XBox adapter might be a better choice as it supports more connections and peripherals from what I hear. I'm not sure about the PS4 USB adapter, that one is probably a glorified Bluetooth adapter, but with the size of the dongle hopefully the antennae's bigger, so you think it might support more/better connections, too??? I haven't used either, so I can't say for sure.

Hopefully someone else can add to this... I know I saw a thread on this very topic a week or more ago.
There's no need for the software in the guide if you're just using the controller to play games. Looks like that software allows the us of it to bind desktop style shortcuts to switch apps and do stuff on your desktop. Something the Steam Controller is good at doing out of the box.
Yup! 180-190 Was typical at the start of the year, too. Amazon hiked it up to ~200 during the summer, but luckily it's back down to a passable price.

To compare, it was $150-160 at the end of 2016 and $112 on Black Friday.
Yeah $180 is a very typical "normal" price.  ...It's more amazing (sad really) how these are passing for $230 these days. 
That's fine if you're comfortable. Really whatever works for you to get good and quick reactions.

Since your hand is practically there already you could try ESDF rather than WASD. Some people swear by it. Might be worth a shot depending on how you use your pinky to game. I imagine it frees up some extra keys on the left.
 I saw "zipped" and thought it was in split into parts. Thanks for re-upping this! This works too.

If it said the reason was due to a recent purchase, Did you make a recent purchase? Either on the store or market?

I know Steam will ask to verify your e-mail from time to time, but that's just to keep your information up to date.

But you say Steam said "due to a recent purchase" so if that's right it would be good to say if you yourself had bought anything recently.
Glad to hear the Steam Link is working so well for you. As for your PC it seem very odd that you have to install drivers every time you plug in the wireless adapter, is that on Windows 10?

OP what is this from and you show us more??
The brow is just way too exaggerated in this specific case. So much to the point it looks OFF. Like an open mouth or 2nd nose. 

Your typical cartoons wouldn't draw such an **extreme** forehead, because it looks so strange. If you do exaggerate it, your art style had better match it somehow to be cohesive. 

[Take Phineas and Ferb as an example](https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/open-uri20160811-32147-mfeeod_d6c052b8.jpeg?region=0%2C0%2C1024%2C320). Super weird faces, right? The exaggerations are all in the "right" spots. But no protruding brows, [just smooth foreheads.](http://www.tabletmag.com/wp-content/files_mf/doof824.jpg)

But your first comment said protrude nose OR depress forehead. Why not both? I'm thinking like [this caricature of Alfred Hitchcock.](http://www.doctormacro.com/Images/Hitchcock,%20Alfred/Miscellaneous/Alfred%20Hitchcock%20caricature_01.jpg) And since noses usually stick out anyway, what you said had me confused.
It's not a matter of being "unrealistic". It's a cartoon, yes cartoons will be unrealistic to varying degrees. This is just a weird artistic choice. Even for a cartoon. Maybe some super weird cartoon could get away with it, but this one's simple and tame.

You mentioned things like "the eyes are dots" or "the mouths are line". Those make sense for cartoons. The forehead here is just too exaggerated for the rest of the art style. Why is it so pointy? It looks like a 2nd nose and other have said open mouth.
> It's weird when someone points it out, but it's easy to ignore if nobody is explicitly pointing it 

That's subjective, there will be people that notice these things, and have a hard time un-noticing. (without having it pointed out)

>there's tons of other details about this cartoon that aren't "realistic":

This is wrong. The issue is not about being realistic. Of course it's a cartoon and liberties are always made. This is not a nitpick as such, it's something bigger that stands out (to some) in a **weird** way. Even in the context of this simple drawing. I've seen comments saying it looks like an open mouth (like Pac Man), it even looks like a 2nd nose.

>(regarding sharp points) The bow in the boy's hair, the girls hair, the spot where the girl's back meets her head...

Hahaha - True! However those points are more "natural". I wasn't saying there was NO sharp edges at all. I'm talking the art style as a whole and whether it explains the weird forehead. The shoulders, hands, arms, body are all smooth and continuous. It's all very simple and relaxed until you get to the Pac Man face that can cut you in half.
>you basically have the choice between a nose that protrudes or a forehead that depresses. 

Why is this a choice? Why not both?

A nose protrudes (meaning extends outward), so of course it will stick out. Noses are often the #1 protruding facial feature (then maybe lips, chin, beards, etc). 
This may not be "crappydesign" worthy, but it is still questionable design. 

You're right, in character design you're encouraged to find unique, absurd, weird, and exaggerated choices to help art style stand out. 

This case, a certain design choice stands out and begs the question "why?". 

The artist's style doesn't display use of any other sharp edges on the kids body, arms, etc, not even the clothes, it's are all smooth. What was the thought process for the sharp forehead? To be honest, it's a bit weird

Dude, tbh, as someone reading this exchange between you and OP, it's you that's sounding rude and ungrateful here. 

First you say there were no links. Now there was one but it didn't work.... so why not say that? And you're upset that the other links were still uploading?? Why not be chill while you wait for them? Why waste more time on all this arguing.

Ha, no worries
You're right. These are just modern Neanderthal children. It's funny how evolution rid them completely of their eyebrows, but the brow bone structure seems to have become even sharper. Somewhere along their evolutionary path, their ancestors must have used their immense brows to hunt and kill their prey.

They also developed the ability to read upside down without issue and, even more amazing, they developed floating hair!
I have heard of this from my mechanic but my 03 Cavalier lasted over 12/13 years before having to change a rear lamp. I'd say that's pretty damn good.

In this case, I meant crowded as in they are spaced quite close together. It's quite a change from having big buttons. 
Would you expect them to do this with everything they changed? I'd rather they fixed the issues that still exist with the title bar, have it functional and look good, and then move on to other issues and features.
It's a different kind of crowded now. The old buttons were bigger, easier to hit. Compared to your standard Windows titlebar, Discord's new one is short, and the buttons have very little spacing between them. Though the spacing may be similar to that on Mac or Linux, I think those sit closer together.
Yeah, but that doesn't change OP's point. This new title bar is still small and the 3 buttons crowd *each other* (like spaced closely not overlap) rather than being crowded by other things. On top of that, if you scale your size down to even 90% or 80% (Discord settings) the title bar and buttons shrink with it, making OP's post very accurate.

True the last one looked OK, but they were due for a good hard look at the top area of Discord. No matter how they approached it, there would be some changes away from the old look. Some people would be unhappy with whatever changes they made.

The top area didn't work great with smaller window sizes and long channel names. The window controls (Close, etc) would get overlapped by all the other stuff up there, and it also was kind of a grey-area for what/where you could click to drag the window.

Like I said before, they shouldn't have rush this, and tested out designs for longer. They addressed some of the issues I mentioned, but caused others.... smh

In this case, OP has and IKEA desk and monitor shelf, IKEA also sells decent, adjustable chairs. If you go through the trouble to get good computer parts, you should get yourself a good, comfortable chair, too. Most basic office chairs will have some sort of adjustments. 

OP has already clearly put effort into adjusting the height for their monitor, I don't see what's so difficult here to aim for a nice height. 

If you can't afford an adjustable stand, use books. Non-adjustable chairs often have a common, comfortable height. If it's too low, use a cushion. It's not difficult.

It's ok, but I'd have preferred if they made it larger. It's smaller than your typical windows 10 title bar.
Also scales with the users UI scale settings so the smaller you set it the smaller the tittle bar and buttons become.
I'm not a fan. The title bar and close/minimize buttons are smallish to begin with and they scale to your personalize UI scale settings. Smaller the UI, smaller the buttons.

Needs to be fixed.

That's cool; they should show off the different variations.

In any case, I still feel like the default appearance (if that's what we're shown) ought to be improved.
Ok. Good to know.
Could you show us some previews of these layouts? The ones you showed us have 0 depth, as jantari said.
Less Transparency. Make the "main" areas solid, I feel like only the left menu should be acrylic. Or at least make the "cards" solid for each download. The grey text for the detailed information isn't a good choice against the transparency.
>so he isn't completely false. Perhaps some cheated during beta and wondered why they got the ban.

What/Who isn't false? I was agreeing with who I replied to. Might have replied to the wrong comment?

> It was very few people out of 400

I'm sure it wasn't a lot of users, but to be fair Bungie didn't give even the slightest hint of how many were mistakenly banned. "We have identified a *group of players* who were banned in error." Yet they were so quick to with their original count of around 400 bans in their original statement, even mentioning 4 bans from the beta that were overturned. 
Yup, it's unfortunate that mistakes happen sometimes. False positives or whatever the reason. Wish the system was perfect, but it clearly isn't.

What matters is how they deal with it.

This... was done poorly, acting like these banned users were all using malicious tools, then a short time later overturning a (undisclosed) number of bans. All while not sending out an apology? Come on, Bungie.

In contrast, Epic recently updated Fort Nite Battle Royale's anti-cheat system, and it banned several users by mistake. They e-mailed these users with a written apology and offered them a copy of Fort Nite Survive the Storm or in-game credit. 
aaaaand now they say they made a mistake with a few bans. 

 ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ Whew, It's been an entertaining day!

Bans in Blizzard games are supposed to be per game, not for the whole Blizzard account. 
> The internet BS in question is the idea that overlays are causing the false bans.

True... Though better to be straightforward and say what's up. 

Whether it's that the bans are in fact all confirmed cheaters or they don't know 100% yet, just say it.  Without an official statement, this tweet just adds fuel to the issue. 

Edit, they finally releasee a statement a couple hours later. 
> Bungie confirmed third party apps won’t trigger a ban.

They claim the programs SHOULDN'T cause bans, but the Bungie community manager says they don't have any more information regarding bans at the time. [This Tweet from PC Lead at Bungie](https://twitter.com/ShockAndShaw/status/923033887269257216) calling the issue **"internet BS"** is a bit aggressive seeing how they haven't posted any official statement with details about these bans. Not a good way to diffuse the situation. 

Edit: they finally posted an official statement... Looks like they're confidently calling all the bans cheaters.
Edit:looks like they unbanned some users...hmm.

I'm aware of the autorun icon, which is why I asked if that's what they meant instead of "thumbnail". They also suggested formatting the drive, which is overkill for the autorun icon.
Ah, yeah, that does explain why it looks off. I had a feeling OP's transparencies looked a little simple/basic.
>The level of blur is the same. The brightness is different. 

So you used a grey, rather than white?

> Others have suggested using a solid background.

Yup. That'd be the best solution. Microsoft suggests as much, "Surfaces behind primary app content should use solid, opaque backgrounds."

This would be your primary app content. You wouldn't want anything behind the window distracting from the main content of this window.
> Yeah I think you have an old thumbnail on the drive

Maybe you mean icon? You'd just need to delete something so trivial.

"Thumbnail" doesn't sound like a thing... Tell us more about this "thumbnail" you speak of.

Should the main body of the windows actually be transparent? It seems you have a lot of text and colour changes which becomes way too busy when you add transparency. If you think it works, then perhaps 80% might be a better choice here?

Yeah, lol, it's a great mouse for everyday use. The third side button is handy! (I bind mine to middle mouse)

It's a matter of opinion. Like I said, I don't mind my G502, but it is definitely on the heavy side.

To compare: 

[Logitech's G403](https://gaming.logitech.com/en-ca/product/g403-prodigy-wired-gaming-mouse) is ~90grams, and 100g with weight

I'm curious why you seem to have an issue with muscle weight. Fat will always take up more space than muscle, and healthy muscles will help in the long run. There are plenty simple exercises that you could do semi regularly.
Right, yep - I sort of simplified that other explanation, to get the idea across. Thanks for posting a tutorial, I know there's a lot of haters, but this should help many.
You must mean Beta release?
Really? Thanks, I'll have to check mine again. It updated earlier, but the usual old icon was there.
OP's does look REALLY busy, but you can use whatever images you'd like. The app they paid for ~~allows for the wider tiles~~. (see edit) ...The free ones let you customize your tile with better icons makes the whole tile experience a lot better.

Edit: My bad, the paid app, Pin More, lets you pin documents or folders, thinks you might not normally be able to pin. Hence the MORE in Pin More.
[They probably mean like this](https://www.trickyways.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/start-menu-icons-04.png)
Where'd you get the new Firefox icons?
Nice idea. Support for subfolders, too... and bring back the small icon view for the program list. You know, basic stuff we had in past generations of Windows.
Weight is a common issue, that it is too heavy or the weight distribution imbalanced compared to some of Logitech's other offerings. Same goes for the scroll wheel, which can be loose/imbalanced for some owners.

I definitely find it a bit heavy, but comfortable. My scroll wheel is also suffers from being imbalanced as it "wobbles" a bit in one direction while using it in free scroll mode.
It's from using it all the time. Similar to how you see those memes about the W or S keys being worn out on keyboards. The oils from our fingers wears through this stuff over time. 
And all they've done to update it since is add RGB :/
That'd be nice. Support for subfolders, too... You know, basic stuff.
Agreed.  It even ignores subfolders if you try to organised it yourself. Any shortcut in say "Games\Steam" will just show up under Games in the start Menu.

I much preferred the old, classic start set to small icons. Very compact, and easy to organize.
No, this is just in reply to that other thread that was showing off their tiles. OP of this thread posted in there too.
That's why I said the entire return of a Doctor using a new actor should be treated with care and respect. Both the choice of story and actor.
This would be the cleaner way to do it. I also like the better consistency in the art you chose for your tiles.
You reminded me of a big issue I have with win10 start menu. I made a "Games" folder like you, but also had a few subfolders inside. Like "Steam", and "Origin"... Stupid new Start Menu collects **all** shortcuts from **all** these folders and groups them **together** in one list! Totally disregarding the subfolders I made. 

What the hell, Microsoft?!
TBH, I liked the classic XP-7 way of doing it, a nice summary of most used apps and I'd set it to small icons, too. You could pin favourites to the top and have everything quickly accessible.

Since the tiles have replaced that in win10, I've sort of adapted. I've hidden the list view and I pinned a dozen of my favourites programs (no other win10 BS apps), mostly set to small tiles. I have some very simple, appealing custom icons (not busy like OP's) for them so it's not a cluttered mess.

In the rare case I need something else, I will just do a quick search, or open the list view by clicking to it.

Sort of a balance between old and new. The way Windows sorts the list view now is shit anyway. Why can't I have subfolders now?! It just groups those shortcuts all under the parent folder. Um, Microsoft, if I wanted it like that I'd have don't it that way!
>Personally I would be against any other such re-castings without the same treatment to the individual they are trying to replace.

So you want a biopic for each actor that's been the Doctor? That the new actor should become the old actor before becoming that Doctor? 

You liked Bradley because you were "eased" into the idea as he played Hartnell. That's well and good. Makes sense. Surely the ultimate reason you liked Bradley and can accept him now is because he is a good actor that fit the part.
 
Edit: forgot to agree that there should be a HUGE amount of care and respect put into having another actor step in as a previous Doctor. If ever done attempted again, you'd to be sure you had the right actor and right story worthy of their return.
Honestly it would have been a lot easily just to AT LEAST use the folder structure the way it was intended and use the My Documents for your stuff. 

I'd honestly suggest, with all respect to "how you've always done it", what you're doing is sort of a bad habit and you should rethink the way you store your files. Use My Documents. There's shortcuts to that already. Or better yet, set up your own "Me" folder. You already seem to know how to relocate those special folders, so why not customize your storage a cleaner way?
Let's be fair here... You're looking to download SEVEN seasons of a show at 1080p. 500mb an ep is decent!

Totally get wanting to save space, though! I see another user say they have a version at around 60gb, so smaller does exist, and a x265 pack might cut it down too.... 
But why pin the user folder?  Why mess with the folder  structure Windows has in place? Why not have your own proper data folder somewhere else?
How often do you use all of these that they need to be pinned? Then again I ask that when I see desktops with as many shortcuts.
Steam even has recently played games in its jump list. i like using that and I'll pin my top 5 or so.

Yeah, that's cool, everybody has their way. Whatever works, right? Gestures are neat. Me, I love middle clicking links (like on reddit) for new tabs. I'm a bit of a tab-aholic....

Anyway, point is there's lots of built-in uses for middle mouse, and I'd personally never remove that functionality completely.
That's not right. 

I just checked Google, and [it is "phil-leap".](https://youtu.be/rsnYWXTADbA?t=7) It's like how you'd say Philippines. (hint, it's *not* Pho-lop-ee-ns)
First I'll say mine is set to the third side button on my G502 (the "sniper button")

In a web browser it can open links in new tabs (I use this a lot!), and it closes tabs. ([A few more web uses](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hidden-middle-click-tricks-web/), I don't use these often)

Similarly, in Windows, it opens new windows from icons on your taskbar, or closes them by clicking the thumbnail previews (I use this often - handy when you have a few windows of the same program open).

Some games and programs will default to Middle Click for rotating or dragging the camera view (RTS and MOBA games), or other key functions.

I used to use it for voice chat, but then I played more MOBA games and mixed it up a bit, I'll use it for melee in FPS games now.
>the other folders were displaying even after they were moved

So, wait... YOU moved them into the MyDocuments folder? Why? Now I'm having a hard time understanding what your goal is here...

Also, why do you have so many folders in the User\Me folder? The ones you blacked out.
Maybe yours just needed a fresh wipe? I dunno, no way I'm just lucky. Mine runs alright with stock Android and gravity box.
Oh that's why they appear open and the social folders aren't just, for example, the music symbol or blue download arrow 
The funny part about this is that what would have caused a bunch of OP's special folders to just migrate into his My Documents folder (or MyDocuments in this case)??
This is weird. What were you doing when this happened? The My Documents folder should be "My Documents" with a space and have a special icon, yours has no space and plain folder icon.... Hmm. A mystery.

You are right the special folders, Music, Links, Contacts, etc.. SHOULD be in Users\<Username> not  Users\<Username>\My Documents. So what happened? 

To answer you question, you can simply right-click  Users\<Username> folder and pin it to Quick Access.

What version of 10 is this btw? Your icons look slightly different.
Are you wanting to hide the Language bar? Change languages from X to Y? Something else?
"Middle click" is pretty damn handy, you should keep it around!

> then you probably dont have any shortcuts of the said programs in your start menu

The issue might be that they have pinned items that exist outside the start menu folder. This seems to be a common issue among search complaints, there was at least one posted just the other day. 

Surely pinned items *should* be searchable...
You could say you saw the Babysitter photo he did. Say something like "that sandwich totally looks photoshopped, no one would hold it like that in real life" Like really, who does/can? 
Your photo clearly shows your thumb to be on top facing outward. OP's Babysitter photo has the pinky on top, and the thumb on the inside.

Easiest way to check if this is right is to just cross your arms (in front of you) with your palms facing you. Thumbs will be on the outside, pinkies on the inside.
You don't even have to put your arms behind your back. Just cross your arms with your palms facing you.

Damn. The image on it looks photoshopped, that's how crisp it looks. Even with a hint of that "3D" pop. Credit to whatever camera you used to capture such a clear photo too.
If the clouds had been painted too, and the weird scribble (top right) touched up it might not look as bad. As it is, the original black lines make it worse than if it was painted or edited more.
Weird. I go on every day or two and the posts are for sure within the last 24-48hrs, sometime I'll see a photo from "4 hours ago" in above "40 mins ago", so clearly out of order, but never a difference of weeks.
It's a pain compared to having in software options do it per game/program and being able to set it and forget it. Saves time and sanity.

Because if you mucked with your screen settings anything else you played on that screen would look funky until you readjusted again.
It's mainly for the elite controller, which has paddles on the back that can be remapped, most games just support your regular style gamepads.

>If we had made a crop out of a 4K screenshot, it would basically be 1080p and **really jaggy**.

I understand that these are cropped to cut out the HUD, but why would cropping make it really jaggy? Cropping simply cuts ouy a portion of an image. 

If anything, the compression would be the culprit.
Simply cropping shouldn't make a huge difference. I think you're saying they've been also been resized? 
>No. Bad user!
>Fuck! People will complain about fucking anything!

You Ok? I wasn't complaining and don't see any other complaints here. So far it's been a pretty tame GUI discussion. I get the colour thing, but OP's Greys appears to be one of the older preset Greys offered in that *limited* selection you mentioned *before* MS added custom colours (Creators Update). 

>issues like the one you're describing.

What I was describing is a relatively basic UI concept worth discussing. Is it worth fixing? Probably not. Is it a HUGE issue? Doesn't appear to be. Is it the colour's fault? Not entirely. The flat white UNDER the action centre is causing the transparency of the Action Center to be solid, which just happens to be similar to OP's accent grey. Again, rare that this would come up often, so not a huge deal. 

Is it still possible MS could have done something more in their tile design improve the distinction between OFF and ON? Absolutely; And That's not complaining that just a fair critique. 
not "more" transparent, the tiles you have set to "ON" will be solid in whatever your accent colour is.
You're not wrong, DS9, TNG, TOS... all abbreviated without the ST.

STD is just funnier for some. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
That's a bit unfair when they're just pointing something out.

Sure, if they choose a colour it'd be fine, but MS could have done more to improve the tile interface just the same. After all, they allow you to pick these colours. Right?

In OP's case the issue is actually that the solid white background behind the Action Center that causes the transparency of the background and "Off" tiles to appear solid. Likely a rare occurrence in itself, but still, it does point out a small flaw, though *minor*, in the way MS chose to design their tiles.  

A couple ways you might fix this. You could make the text/icon for the OFF tiles grey or transparent rather than white (presently same as ON). You could also perhaps make the background of the tiles more transparent, but the text would be my first choice. I know right now grey text/icons indicate UNAVAILABLE/DISABLED, but it would be easy to tweak them too.

[Android uses a similar design to what I'm referring to.](https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/TGFktB0gKkds-hT19SOYClE_kvg=/fit-in/x/2017/09/08/b78e301b-d85f-4a9d-86a5-e3c5c353dbd5/android-oreo-notification-shade.jpg)

There's another app on the Windows Store that is like TileIconifier but supports wide. I don't use it, but I'll update this post if I can find the name.
Yeah Start Menu tiles are a much prettier alternative, and it allows you to enjoy your pretty wallpapers that much more!

I also personally enjoy utilizing Steam's jump list and pin my most used games there and that makes the Start Menu that much less cluttered.
Yeah, what's the point in showcasing those items in their merch photo-shoot if it's not available? 

It feels less like "Hey, buy our cool stuff!" and more, "Hey, check out the cool stuff you CAN'T buy!" 

Hopefully /u/BulletzQS can forward some of this feedback.
Mind sharing the Chrome icon? Been looking for a decent one to use.
> then there are definitely some conclusions we can draw about your own health. No offense

All we can conclude is that they appear to follow a low carb diet (they said as much). What more can you determine  based off their initial comment?
>the vast majority of it doesn't matter or make a difference.

Maybe to you. You make it sound like the ending of 3 is all that matters, where it was the overall setting, and the character interactions that had me so invested in the story for countless hours and sleepless nights. 

Yeah the ending was a major let down, but let's not pretend that
> It's actually a bit better

In what way?
Eh, I don't know about died. I use Hangouts just about everyday and have done so since before it was named Hangouts. I just use another app for SMS. However I do understand how some people would be upset. Different strokes for different folks.
I use an app that shows a notification with my To-do list, or whatever I need to be reminder of. No need for screenshots and changing backgrounds

>high fructose corn syrup with a bit of artificial tomato flavoring.

As a maple-syrup-blooded Canadian who apparently doesn't have this up here, I'm so sorry, eh.
>Two syllables vs three. 

I'm all about calling him Monkey, but Winston and Monkey are both 2 syllables. I feel like monkey just flows more in the heat of battle versus monkey.
Like others have suggested, there might be different teams working on PvE and PvP modes, but FortNite still falls under one name and product, therefore not true "standalone" by definition. 

Paragon and Fortnite are standalone from each other because those are entirely and completely separate products.
>self-absorbed American

I think it's safe to say when someone says "everyone has it" they are at the very least *definitely* talking from their own personal experience. Either their immediate contacts or people they know. 

Since you assumed American, you must already know, too, that WhatsApp hasn't taken off like it has in other parts of the world. It isn't just the United States, either. Canadians gravitate to FB Messenger and we still use SMS, too. iMessage is also pretty popular. Communication platforms are still an ongoing issue here, and Facebook has been a household name for a LONG time.

It's nice to be reminded that WhatsApp is THE go to app everywhere else and I'm sure it's great to have everything figured out, and it's great to know there are other successful options as well. Over here, we're still figuring things out, dipping into each and giving them a go. Hell, we're still fighting with our carriers for affordable plans.
Yeah, I don't get how people can say Hangouts "will disappear any moment". Google has confirmed it's not going anywhere, they're just not working as heavily on it. 

I'm not happy about some of the changes/choices regarding Hangouts, but I'll continue using it as it's the best choice for me at this time.
Oh, damn. Good to know.

>"only back-up Google photos while charging and WiFi"?

My Photos has "cellular data backup" toggles for photos and videos, and a toggle for Charging under "when to back up". Seems to do the same, just split up under separate toggles.
try warranty replacement, or get a replacement off ebay?

Maintenance tips: Always be careful how tight you wrap the cord. Keep it untangled as best you can.
Do you mean they've been appearing "from nowhere"? Mine sort of has "bends" where it was coiled for packing at the factory... Are they causing any issues? Popping out of the braiding? 

If it's a big issue you can either try warranty or just buy a replacement cable off ebay.
Shouldn't be too hard. They're essentially really thick stickers. Peel old ones off, try to clean those area of the glue goop with rubbing alcohol or something, then stick new ones on.
Try [XmouseButtonControl](https://www.highrez.co.uk/downloads/xmousebuttoncontrol.htm), on the surface it's a lot like any mouse button customizing software, but but with more "poweruser options" in macros and extra options. 

You can set per-app/game profiles and such. Good program.

Just be careful with things like scrolling to click and advanced macros, bordering what might be considered "cheat" area. I wouldn't use it for many competitive games.
And replies to the comment stating it is NOT 7200rpm. Mixed indeed.
> bing search results

you can at least turn that one off
I know everyone is saying the neck looks funny, but it's not too bad seeing the source photo. Like, this is really awesome!

I'd work on refining your lines, and softening your shadows/highlights. Examples would be the back of her neck appears very straight and angular but her actual neck is straight from the head, then a subtle curve midway that extends out to the shoulder.

Example of highlight/shadows is the shadow on the neck could be softened to lessen the look of being flat, and her clavicle closest to us looks thin and sharp, so again I'd just soften that and give it more volume.

I know someone who was so broken from the accidental loss of Tali, they had to take a break and play other games for a while before coming back to try again.
The writing for Renegade dialogue can pretty entertaining!

"Do you think the formalwear brings out my eyes?"
The ending might have made no difference, and been upsetting, but playing ME1-3 had many smaller choices that affected the "in between" story. Those character interactions and seeing who lived and died, cursing because you made the wrong choice, etc, that's what made those games fun to play for me.
>(although I like the Mickey Mouse short that goes into this)

Haha I like that short.

Those events with Mickey must have had an effect on Donald, he seems quite comfortable around all things boats in the episode of [Chip'n'Dale, "Chips Ahoy".](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4fJdXL6f6U)
Thanks for explaining it. Comments seemed to like both, so I didn't mean to say that either was inferior, just that there were as many recommendations in favour of Palomar.
Eh... She compared the sounds. It's not much of a stretch, really, especially when she probably hasn't been around a lot of mechanical keyboards.
["Non-slip Knot"](http://www.kryston.com/ultimate-knots/#non-slip). Commonly used in fishing. Some would also suggest the [Palomar knot](http://www.kryston.com/ultimate-knots/#palomar) (edit: but both are good).

You can read about it in that first link, or see what else reddit had to say about it from this week in the  [interestingasfuck thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/71qg5a/how_to_knot/) (44,511 pts / 1,278 comments), in [Survival](https://www.reddit.com/r/Survival/comments/71rt4v/how_to_properly_tie_a_fishing_line_knot/) (860 pts, 83 comments), or [coolguides](https://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/71s40e/how_to_knot/) (670 pts, 37 comments)
Exactly! Well said. I **loved** it as a gag but it also delightful weighed in on the plot. I have such fond memories of watching it every year, too!
I loved the use of humour, [using Rudolph](/spoiler), in the latest episode to push the plot. I loved that scene and how it came back in the end.
yeah, it's a common enough mod for xbox and playstation controllers.
I have Cortana turned off, so no, that doesn't happen. 

You can try [turning off web/Bing search](https://www.howtogeek.com/224159/how-to-disable-bing-in-the-windows-10-start-menu/) in Cortana settings
>  if you type something into search on the start menu and it doesn't find it, it automatically boots Edge, even though that isn't my default browser.

Is this on on W10? It must be something you can turn off because I've never encountered this issue.
> the bad versions all had updates halfway through that made them reasonable again

It was only a year from 8 to 8.1, granted that would be enough time for a lot of people to hate it, and IMO 8.1 didn't fix the biggest issue (the start menu). Using a 3rd party replacement is what makes the whole OS usable for me.Never had any other issues with it, so it's hard for me to trash talk it. ....Ok, that's not true. I seem to recall my old Bluray drive wasn't supported. 
I hated Windows 8 when it was released. Refused to install it. Terrible.

Now I have a machine running 8.1 and it's quite usable. I have a classic start menu installed and it's quite snappy. No complaints I can think of. My main machine is on Windows 10.
>If you tried to run windows 10 on a vista machine it wouldn’t work all that great either.

I see what you're trying to say but that's a poor example.
Interesting. To date, La La Land was the only time I've encountered this issue with x265.
Strangely my launcher didn't have the Patch Notes banner this time (edit:it showed up eventually, but I had already played a bit); It only has the Junkertown video and Free Weekend banner. 

I also know my friend doesn't really pay attention to the things in the launcher much, but he sure notices the times we get popups in the game.
This is what I do. Helps filter out all the uninstall shortcuts that get put in when you install things. Like I get the OP issue with Devices not even showing up, but why are we surprised that search will come up with app uninstallers when you search for uninstall?
