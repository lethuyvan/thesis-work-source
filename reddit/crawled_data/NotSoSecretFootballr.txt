"Why would Uber and Lyft do this"
People (myself included) noticed with iOS 11.3 that WiFi had dropped in speed. Not everyone has experienced this, but there have been numerous posts and comments regarding this. 

Basically you get slow WiFi speeds of like 0.5 mbps on an otherwise fast connection (I usually get 400/500 mbps). 

This is an issue I never experienced in all my years using an iPhone (including the 4 months I have used my X so far), nor an issue I experience on any other device I own. 

I assumed it was a router issue until I saw the number of posts that have come out stating the same issue I have, and the fact that my other devices are fine. 

Count yourself lucky you do not experience it, as it is infuriating, and I am rinsing through my data every month. 
Ah yes, [the good old peaceful, non distruptive taxi strike](https://youtu.be/B7zXoSY1R6s)!
Hopefully it fixes the slow wifi issue many of us have experienced, I want to throw my X into a shredder. 
One of the better trackpads on Windows, especially with the Windows Precision drivers. I am also a fan of the trackpoint (that red nub in the middle of the keyboard) feature Lenovo has, but not everyone is a fan.

That being said, the MacBook trackpad trumps any windows trackpad I’ve used easily. Apple is just a cut above everyone in that regard. 
Way too old for that inflated price, maybe take a shot at building a hackintosh?

You could also save up longer and buy a Mac off the apple refurbished site, which are basically brand new devices (battery and external components all replaced). 
I think the X1 Carbon can compete with the XPS line in terms of aesthetics now, with XPS still taking the edge. The new X1 has slim bezels, slim design, premium feel. [Here is the latest one](https://i.imgur.com/c92h4j5.jpg). 
I mean, look at the sub, we are bound to house the biggest Apple fanboys. I admit I am an Apple fanboy, but I cannot defend them anymore, and the past year has been a horrendous experience with Apple. 
Tim Cook is clearly a numbers guy, not an end-user guy. I can see Apple lose some steam if this trend continues, especially after the horrendous state iOS was in for a while there. I've been using iOS since iPhoneOS 3, and without a doubt last year was my worst experience with Apple. This was between going through 3 2017 MBPs, and having to restore my phone many times because iOS bugs, I am so sick of Apple lately. 

Everything I own is Apple, I use AirPods, an iPad Pro, an aTV, an Apple Watch, iPhone X, and a Macbook. I won't be replacing any of them with another Apple product when it comes time if Tim Cook does not get this company together, and start working on some damn quality control.  
Or a Lenovo X1 Carbon. Those things are tanks, house the only keyboard that rivals the MB keyboard, premium, reliable, and easy to repair. 
I did the same! Just not renewing my year. $30 is not too bad of a loss, I just know now that going forward it is not worth the yearly fee. 
This is ridiculous, I only get FIFA and NHL from EA Access, I think this solidified that the service is wasted on me. Considering both have gone on sale I could have spent $20 extra to get to play them since December. 

My fault for not researching for sure, but I’m cancelling my membership. 
As someone that uses excel quite a bit (large datasets, pivot tables, VBA), I would definitely recommend Windows over MacOS. 

I’ve owned a retina MacBook Pro, and excel just is not the same. It’s nearly caught up to the windows version, but keyboard shortcuts, VBA, and speed are my issues with the macOS version. Excel just feels much more sluggish on my MacBook.

I recommend the Lenovo X1 because it’s build quality is exceptional, and it houses the only keyboard I prefer to my 2015 MacBook Pro. Lenovo laptops are tanks, and definitely made with businesses in mind. 
What OS do you prefer?

Windows: Lenovo X1 Carbon

MacOS: Macbook Pro
Retail in a nutshell. I remember years ago in high school working at a high-end clothing store, and people had a tremendous amount of difficulty comprehending that "Up to 50% off" is not the same as "50% off". 

Then they get mad at you as if you are the one that creates corporate promotions and policies lol. 
> I forgot to mention that Things has an email feature where you can email items to Things and have it add it a list automatically. I have it set up to forward a copy of emails from my boss to Things’ Inbox view so I can tackle those processes.

This may be the feature that pushes me to buy it, thanks for outlining all of that!
That intro is an inside look at WoodysLab
Yeah it’s crazy how fast they go. That should send a message to Apple honestly. 
They stopped selling the 13 inch ones brand new, at least on the Canadian apple site!
He wanted to be on that Lebron highlight level 
> Don’t buy anything you can’t afford to fix. 

Never said I can't afford it, I am just saying it is absolutely ridiculous that you *need* AppleCare for peace of mind that a piece of dust won't destroy your >$2k product. I cannot believe people like you are still defending Apple on this, you should not have to *buy* an extended warranty for a device to work past 1 year. Aside from coil whine, which is not nearly as serious as the freaking keyboard not working, my work Dell XPS has not had an issue, nor has the fleet of Lenovo X1s. I am confident that they won't be destroyed by a speck of dust. 

>You wouldn’t buy an expensive sports car or luxury vehicle and when something fails be upset you have to pay premium to fix it because you didn’t extend the warranty...

Not going to agree with this comparison. The keyboard issue is huge, and way too common. You cannot take it to a third party repair shop, unlike with a luxury car that you are free to take to any mechanic. The repair process for 1 key ensure you can *only* take it to Apple. Maybe on the next Audi they can take cues from Apple, and design the car so you have to replace the entire front end to fix the timing belt. In addition, something like this would result in a recall in the automotive industry. 

 
Yeah it's crazy how serious the repair can be for one single key. Apple can be forgiving sometimes with out of warranty repairs, but should you really be relying on Apple's mercy to repair your laptop for free out of warranty? Nope, and it's the reason I am waiting. 
Apple sells the 15 inch 2015 model brand new on their website, and also sells 2015 13 inch models on their refurb site!
>This keyboard has to be one of the biggest design screwups in Apple history. Everyone who buys a MacBook depends upon the keyboard and this keyboard is undependable.

Spot on. Even if you do not experience issues now, what happens when your 1-year warranty expires? You could shell out the extra hundreds for AppleCare, but should you really be required to on a device that costs so much money?

Hoping for a 3rd gen butterfly keyboard this year, otherwise I will just buy the 2015 15 inch MBP. 
His interview with Julian Casablancas sure was something lol

Wait what?! All these years I thought that was Bob Marley too, TIL!

Absolute goosebumps. The incident happened right in front of my office building, so it's been a really shitty day, and I saw things I hope no one else ever does. 

This brought me to tears when I saw it during the game. Thanking the first responders was a nice touch, because they handled the situation extremely well. The world is not always so bad.   
I'm sorry, my comment was just emotion fueled and I have cooled down a bit (was not a good day to say the least). It sounds too aggressive towards your post.

You are absolutely right, and your comment is needed for people to read so they can feel safe again. It may take me a bit to feel safe in my area, but people living in constant fear is not what we need.

Thank you for your comment, and I apologize again if it sounded like I was directing it in any way at you. Was just a crazy time. 
I don't consider him less than human, I consider him a waste of a human. I don't think bombs are the way to retaliate with events like this. 
Well fuck, this sounds eerily similar to the London attacks. 
You too! Police seems to have everything under control, a lot of the area is roped off. The response time on this was really good, security guards from the office buildings rushed out to help as soon as it happened. 
There are a few churches. One is right on Yonge , another (Catholic) church is a bit further up, and there is a Catholic one a few side streets over. 
You too, it's terrifying when something like this happens so close to your home. You take care as well, I know this can be a bad mental experience. 
Yup :(
I am so sorry man, I hope you are okay, and please be sure you are talking to someone about everything. I have never experienced PTSD, but I cannot imagine how hard it is to live through. Please talk to someone about it, anytime you need a random internet person to talk to I'm willing to listen.
Hope you are okay man, it's a terrifying experience and it really hits you when home does not feel safe. 
Definitely premeditated, this was not a freak "jumped over the curb by accident". Lots of condos and office building near here too, and the driver did this during the time many of the buildings take lunch... 
Everyone is okay, I just hope the families of the few that were hit are okay. Just fucking sucks when home does not feel safe.
Not many, I know what you are talking about, students are always at the food court in the North York Civic building. This happened around 1:30, students are luckily usually gone by then.

Thank you.
Yeah I kept thinking that but it happened right in fucking front of me. I live right in front of North York Centre by the Best Buy. This was something I thought only happened in other areas, never this close to him. I need to shut up before my emotions make me sound like an ass, but I hate this world. 
Did not see the driver, it was a white rental van (small one). He went along Yonge Street hitting various people, 2 people hit in front of my building, 2 more were hit about a kilometer down. 
~~Happened right in front of my building, can answer questions if anyone has, but most of the information is out now.~~

Edit: I realize now that my comment sounds a bit insensitive, and I sound like a news reporter trying to steal the thunder or something. I just freaked out since this happened to close to me, was not thinking, and wanted to talk to people. I apologize if I offended anyone. 
Thank goodness, hope that waste of a human is still alive. Death would be too easy of an exit for them. 

Edit: sorry if I am sounding like a dick, but I have never experienced something like this so close to home.
Happened right in front of my building, fuck. I saw 2 bodies on the ground :(

2 more people hit near my buddies house ~1km down from me, so sounds like he hit multiple people along Yonge (10 reported). Was a white rental van, police and security have locked down my building right now.

Yikes!! Did not know it was that expensive. Depending on the price of a 7, I would say it is worth it. I would wait if you can, but honestly it sounds like you need a phone sooner than later. The 7 is still an amazing device, and will be supported for years to come. That matte black colour is my favourite iPhone colour!

Not sure why you are being downvoted for an honest question...

Hypebeasts. People will see a celebrity wear something and latch on, and in this case, Kanye + Champion changed the image of the company to people.

It's the same as those "Thrasher" hoodies that you would see skaters wear. A Kardashian wore one, they got popular, hypebeasts latched on.

Not trying to trash anyone if my post comes across as such. 
> they're ridiculously expensive

Going to defend them a bit here, no they are not when you compare them to their competitors, and for the quality. Read up on Fjallraven, and *why* those bags are expensive. They last forever, and are talked about quite a bit on /r/BuyItForLife.

The G-1000 material is water resistant, dries quickly, and can be made waterproof if you desire using wax. Incredible backpacks for the outdoors. If you wait you can easily find them on sale, I bought a rucksack from them at 50% off, and Costco has stocked their backpacks at a much lower cost in the past.

That being said, I agree with you that they are the new "Herschel" bag, becoming a fashion thing. Not everyone buying them will care too much about what I mentioned above. 
They're absolutely everywhere now, I see one a day in Toronto, Canada. 
I like them on my Macbook or PC, but definitely not something I wanted on mobile. 
Cheers!
I would take it to a **reputable** third party repair shop if you do not want to pay Apple to swap out the screen. An Apple Store is definitely recommended!

Worst case you could buy a cheap glass screen protector for your phone so the cracks/chips won't cut you. 
lmao thanks for noticing that, no idea what was going through my mind. Edited. 
What is this from lol
I would prefer that model as well to be honest, I just think it would push a lot of people away! EA makes too much money off FIFA points at this point though. 

A subscription model that is cross-platform (in a similar way as Rocket League) would be amazing. 
I feel the same way. The 8 has the same design we have used since ~~2017~~ 2014, so the X felt like a big jump!

Edit: error
Apple has always been a premium brand, nothing new. 
NHL 18 was added without notice this year. With FIFA 17 being added April 21 I would not think they are shaking anything up yet! We will probably see it by the end of April.

>make it a monthly subscription game

I could *maybe* have seen them doing this a year or so ago, but not anymore. As big as FIFA is, that would alienate a significant chunk of the fanbase, especially during this EA-backlash period that got resurfaced in full force with Battlefront 2. 
I would honestly rather have one of the teams just blow out the other so I can have my sleep schedule and health back. 
I saw someone with plasti dipped taillights. Easy way to turn any car into a ghetto mobile. 
Do people not verify the number of bills in a bundle? Whenever someone made a large withdrawal at the bank I used to work at, we would have a machine count the bills before putting them in the bundle. 
Being completely honest I am relatively new to baseball, and I am not 100% sure on who is usually legit. I have heard Quintana is usually good which is why I did not think dropping him is an option. 

Ray and Paxton have been my worst pitchers outside of Quintana, which is why I was leaning towards them.

Thank you for clarifying that for me, and for making me realize that I may have to do some more research in order to know who is due for regression, rather than relying on Yahoo rankings. 
> Hard to call any of them droppable

Agree with you completely there, it's simply due to the size of the league that I can even afford to drop one. In my mind I had Ray, Paxton, and Weaver as being drop candidates, so thank you for the confirmation! I just need to decide on which one....
Only 6 teams in the league! Thanks for the input man!
Tried moving one of them but no takers, managed to get Strasburg in a trade. Pitchers aren't too hot of a commodity in this league, for example, someone dropped Dallas Keuchel (who I put a claim in for immediately).

Need to drop a pitcher to activate Realmuto.

Is there any one of those guys (pitchers) that stands out to you as the worst of the bunch (even though they are all studs)?

Thanks man
You win that trade in my opinion
Carrying too many pitchers right now, finding it difficult to drop one.

* Categories: Wins, Saves, K's, ERA, WHIP

Who would you drop out of;

* Taillon
* Weaver
* Corbin
* Paxton
* Quintana
* Ray

My other pitchers are Strasburg, Verlander, and Nola
Some of you guys are just overly negative the second the Capitals lose a game lol, not that I blame you. Every single year it's a game 7 nail-biting series that ends with the Capitals getting knocked out. Usually with the Caps facing some unearthly goalie who has one of the best game of his life. But guess what, we got to see one of the best players of all time on the team, in addition to regular playoff hockey. 

We have **nothing** to complain about when a team like the Arizona Coyotes, who not only miss the playoffs but get threatened with relocation constantly, would *wish* to be in the Capitals position.

Holtby earned his throne back 
[This site (Don't Tell Me The Score)](http://www.dtmts.com/) offers daily highlights that date back a few years without spoiling the score in the title. 

When I lived in England (live in Canada now) I tried my best to follow the Elite Ice Hockey League, which is a league in the UK. Their website is here: http://eliteleague.co.uk/view/eliteicehockey/

Honestly right now is a prime time to get into the sport, since playoff hockey is incredible. You would think you are skydiving with the adrenaline that pumps through you as you watch your team play in yet another overtime game, or a win or go home game 7 (shoutout to a certain team).

Just watch the playoff games, or highlights on the site I mentioned above, and I am sure you will find a team that fits who you like. 

Is there a football/soccer team that you follow? People could suggest a similar team.

Not flagships that compete with the iPhone. But people buy cheap android phones with cheap specs from manufacturers that clog the OS with bloatware. Then they get an iPhone and compare it to that cheap android phone, which will obviously provide a better experience.

I had no clue he was this big of a scumbag on the ice. Watching this series, in addition to the clips that people have posted, has completely changed my opinion on him. 
I agree. I went back to Narwhal yesterday after switching between the official app and Apollo for a year. 

Narwhal has the least amount of bugs out of those 3, and Apollo is just a buggy mess right now for me.

I actually a lumber pillow I use at home, was worth the price for sure. At the office we have Steelcase Leap v2's, but I don't feel the hype too much for those.

I'm still young that I do not want back issues down the line, so a Herman Miller is worth the investment for me. Thanks for suggestion, had not looked at the Mirra.
Threat of Joy was such a good throwback to Is This It, I loved it. But fair point Oblivius and Drag Queen may not be fan favourites!
I remember hearing in an interview or something that Julian (lead singer) put his mic through a small amp, with another mic recording that amp to get that effect. 

It may not be for everyone, but I loved it!
Definitely Interpol, such a good band!
The Voidz can be a bit overwhelming for new listeners, but I think any Strokes fan will like Leave It In My Dreams, potentially Wink and Lazy Boy. From there you appreciate the rest of the album!

Julian is having so much fun with The Voidz, perfect outlet for him with the creative freedom he may not have with The Strokes. No way the Strokes would have put out a song like QYURRYUS. I still much prefer The Strokes, but I found myself liking Virtue much more than I anticipated I would, just had to go in with an open mind and a fair chance. 
Saw them in Toronto just over a week ago, the concert was incredible! The energy they have when playing live is awesome, they interact with the crowd often during the songs, it was just a good night. Don't leave right away btw. 
Every thread I have seen on AskReddit regarding the "perfect album" will have a comment about Is This It, usually followed by someone replying how Room On Fire is near that too, then how FIOE is underrated, then how great The Strokes are.

It's awesome!
Angles was so underappreciated by me when it first came out, that album is incredible. Top 3 for me. 
Thanks for the reply! I’m considering spending a high amount on a Herman Miller, probably used, because I don’t want my posture ruined from sitting a chair that much. 
I know, that’s why I said I was contemplated putting that $150 *towards* the Aeron. You are right, I understand it’s not fair to compare them 1 for 1. 
This is tough, have heard mixed reviews regarding this chair. Tempted to just go out and buy it, but I could put that $150 towards a Herman Miller Aeron or Leap v2...

Anyone feel like this chair has good back support?
Too many rumours for this not to be true, they definitely have had something in the works.

I bought that same case for my iPhone X. I liked it at the start, since it has a similar design to the original iPhone, and it offered good protection.

Ended up returning it after a week. Warning you now, that back picks up scratches incredible easily, and is a fingerprint magnet. I preferred the Spigen clear case for my X, then used a UAG Monarch, then a leather case, and finally just ended up buying AppleCare+ and going caseless. 

Another option to show the back that I used for a bit was a Rhinoshield bumper (watch drop tests, the thing is awesome) with a tempered glass protector for the back of my phone. 
Pocket Casts if you are willing to pay, Overcast if you want a free option (although you said you are not a fan of the interface). Pocket Casts offers those features.  

I am a podcast fiend, and would rank the ones I have used over the years as;

* 1 - Pocket Casts
* 2 - Overcast
* 3 - Downcast
* 4 - Apple Podcast app

The official podcast app got worse over the years for me, I stopped using it with iOS 10. Downloads would just stop, it would not remember my place, just became a mess with the rest of iOS for a bit in iOS 10. Have not used it since. 
It comes and goes, getting pretty ridiculous that Apple cannot fix this.

Extremely common, I saw stop signs in England as often as I see roundabouts in Ontario. I prefer them since I feel like they are much quicker, and less stopping. I can definitely see why you see them as strange if you have not driven on them for a while!
Just can’t get on board with this style, those Guess shirts that are popular now just seem too in your face gaudy about it. 

To each their own though!
Going against the majority, I like the chainsaw. 
I prefer manual but driving in North America, or at least here in Toronto, means you will constantly be in bumper to bumper traffic. When I lived in England it was easy. Now in Toronto I am parked more than I am driving, so an automatic made sense. Especially since this city loves its bloody stop signs...not a roundabout in sight  
Switch to carbonated flavoured water, watch the weight drop. 
Good on you! Budgeting for it was a good step, and having the knowledge to work on it yourself is an even bigger step. You will save a large amount of money doing the routine maintenance yourself rather than going to a dealer, especially with a German car.

I had an 04' Audi that I got used first year of Uni in 2012, saved a fortune by doing the routine maintenance and ordering parts to do repairs myself. Sold it last year, but it was still running at 417000km!
Shareef is on standby 
Maybe he didn't want to post from another account, or had second thoughts? I wouldn't put much thought into it bud lol, no conspiracy here
> if it is reasonably cheap to maintain

Unfortunately with BMWs it can get *very* expensive down the line, high up there in most expensive cars to maintain. That being said, if he budgets around maintenance costs OP has a car that he owes no money on, which the majority of people can not say. 
Over $9 million now!! Donations from over 60 countries, this is absolutely incredible. 
First off, welcome to Canada!!

> Is it normal or common for all 4-year-olds to have hockey jerseys?

No it's not that common, she's not going to be out of place or anything. I had a couple growing up, but never when I was 4 years old!

If you want to get a jersey down the line, buying brand new is not the only way to go, since they can be *very* expensive. Kijiji and Value Village will offer you some good selection, and you can always scope out clearance sales at stores or online. Right now the NHL has moved from Reebok as their jersey supplier to Adidas, and many places still have the Reebok jerseys on clearance.

That being said, not everyone owns a jersey, and you aren't obliged to buy one! It's an expensive cost for something you won't be wearing every week. 

If you want to get into hockey by the way, now is a good time as the NHL playoffs just started. No Alberta teams are in it, but playoff hockey can be incredible!
Same here, normally wear a suit to work so this is a change. You donate and you get to wear a jersey, was a good idea. 
Albert Hammond Sr, Lizzy Goodman, the drummer from The Killers...the rumours are there! I still think 2019 is when we get new music. 
Have not found a leap v2 for that cheap, but I've only been checking for a couple of weeks. Will keep my eyes out for one.

Do you prefer the Mirra or Leap v2? My office uses the Steelcase Leap v2s, never tried the Mirra. 
I went with the Tele, just felt better to me. Thanks!
Long and McQuade?
The default app is better than I thought.

I've been using it while I wait for Apollo to release 1.2 to fix the bugs...which could be any month now lol
Playing around with the MiM tele in store is what convinced me to switch, preferred the Tele pickups. 

Also nice username lol
Yup. BBM lost because they took waaaay too long to port over to iPhone and Android devices, just RIM/Blackberry being stubborn.

Something something "if you aren't paying for it, you are the product"
Thanks! I ended up with the Arctic White Tele, absolutely love it. 

>AM are known for always swapping their gear each album.

One of the reasons I am so hyped for the new album in May, can't wait to see what they've done with the theme of the album!
I get what you are saying, and would agree with you a bit, but honestly right now what Strokes news is there?

If there were constant rumours or new content regarding The Strokes I would understand the frustration, but right now AHJ and The Voidz are the only new things we can talk about around here.

It's not like content about The Strokes is being downvoted, this sub is still a Strokes sub, but the band usually keeps rumours pretty quiet. The Voidz and AHJ content are not suppressing The Strokes content since, well, there is nothing new right now!

Also I think the example you were looking for was people not posting Nirvana content in the Foo Fighters subreddit! Again, I understand the frustration, but right now The Voidz and AHJ will be talked about more than The Strokes. 
I know, could have worded that better. Meant that Julian still has a connection to The Strokes. This is similar to his comments during the Tyranny release period, and then we received FPP. They clearly hate people focusing on The Strokes constantly while pushing their other projects, which is why I do not see his comments as any indicator of The Strokes being finished. This is also why they just sort of dropped FPP, rather than let people know publicly they were in the studio. It would only result in people ignoring the Voidz, CRX, AHJ, Summer Moon, and Little Joy, while spamming "where is the new Strokes album". 
>We can safely say there will never be another Strokes record

Where do you gather that from? There’s no way you can “safely say that”. Obviously he is going to hype his Voidz album up, and downplay the Strokes to keep focus on the Voidz when they release a new album. Same thing as in 2014 when he said he felt emotionless with the band when Tyranny was released. Then we got FPP less than 2 years later. 

It's been pretty clear from Julian that with the Voidz he can present ideas, and the guys are all on board and fit in with it. With the Strokes he feels like he would have to force them into a song idea he has, which he hates doing.

Look at QYURRYUS, there is no way The Strokes would have worked with that song the same way the Voidz did. The Voidz as something positive for the future of The Strokes. The Voidz gives Julian his creative outlet, and you can tell he is enjoying himself. It stops Julian from feeling forced to get everyone in the Strokes on his wavelength, which would probably lead to extremely high tension and arguments within the band.

This also bodes well for the fact that with the past few albums Julian stepped back a bit with writing everything, with the other members contributing to the song writing. Julian has his creative control with the Voidz, and has his creative contribution with The Strokes.

He does not hate The Strokes, just look at his performance in Argentina last year. He has stated how he looks at them like his brothers, and is always in contact with them. 

It's been rumoured **heavily** that The Strokes have another album in the pipeline. We just have to deal with the fact that they take longer than others to release albums, especially with the other projects the members have. Lizzy Goodman talked about how they have another album in the works, but that they take time. The Killers drummer let it slip during an interview during their tour with Albert. Heck, Alberts dad even slipped up a bit. 
Where did you manage to find them for that cheap? Absolute steal!
You have the exact same favourite songs from Angles as me, such an amazing album. LISITM is a masterpiece. 
One thing I love about the Strokes is how they have such versatile albums, and everyone has different rankings.

If I ranked them personally it would go;

* Room On Fire

* First Impressions of Earth

* Angles

* Is This It

* Future Present Past

* Comedown Machine

That being said, I love every single one of those albums and it is hard to rank! Will people disagree with my ranking? You better fucking believe it, and there are people that would rank Comedown Machine as their favourite album. Best band in the world. 
I preferred it to Tyranny, and slightly more than Virtue (which is hard)!
Actually ended up getting the Arctc White MiM Tele! It's awesome!
You were right, ended up with the Arctic White Tele. Sat in the store for about an hour playing around with one, could tell the difference! 
Yup! Checked prices around, and it is not nearly as expensive as I thought. Thank you!!
Had no idea the Strat could be modded this much, thanks for the detail! 
Good point, sometimes it's better to not overthink things. Thanks man!
Thank you very much for your input, glad you like it! If it was not for the restocking fee I found out about ($180), I would probably be swapping my Strat for that exact Tele!

I've been hunting for the Strokes sound, and the consensus seems to be that the Jekyll and Hyde pedal is needed! I think I'm better off putting that $180 towards that pedal and a new amp for now, but a Tele is on my list for a future purchase (in that Arctic White).

The MiM quality is amazing for the price!
Thanks for the reassurance! My Strat has the 5-way toggle, and I saw Fender's video on swapping adding a humbucker to a Strat. Does not seem too difficult, so keeping that as an option for the future. 

Even paying someone to do the conversion for me is cheaper than the restocking fee for swapping my Strat for a Tele it turns out!
Great point, does not make sense to pay the restocking fee. I am going to keep the Strat.
Thanks, your input helps a lot. I think my decision has been made to stick with the Strat, as it does not seem that difficult to swap out the pickups down the line. Considering the restocking fee is $140 USD, I think I am better off putting that money towards upgrading my amp.
$180 CAD (~$140 USD). I will look up guides on how to change the pickups on my Strat. Do you think it is worth it to pay someone to swap the pickups, or is that a pretty straight forward process? 
You are right with the Strokes, Albert uses a Strat, and Nick uses an Epiphone Riviera with P94 pickups.

I just know I do not have the skill to replicate them, which is why I considered the Tele as it is more beginner friendly (from what I read). 

Going to try out the Tele, but sounds like keeping my Strat is worth it considering both bands are able to get their sounds out of a Strat. Thanks for the reply!
Thanks for the input! I definitely wish I considered the HSS Strat before, right now my options are limited to the S/S/S Strat vs the Tele. I own the Strat, switching to the Tele will cost me the restocking fee. 

Considering purchasing a Les Paul or Riviera down the line for that versatility with 2 guitars.

Thanks again man!
I definitely feel like this will not be my last guitar haha, already looking at getting a Riviera in the future! 

Considering it will cost me ~$180 CAD to switch my Strat for the Tele (restocking fee), I may be better off using that money to upgrade my amp!

Thanks for the input mate!!
I played a Squier Classic Vibe Tele without plugging it into an amp, but not a MiM Fender Tele (none were in stock). I preferred the feel of the MiM Strat being honest, which is why I went with it in the end. Now the guitar shop by me has MiM Teles, which sort of brought me deciding whether or not I swap my Strat.

Your comment is actually pushing me to just keep the Strat and invest more into an amp.

Swapping my Strat for a Tele will cost $180 CAD, and as the difference from what I gather is not that drastic, I would be better off learning the ins and outs of my Strat and upgrading my amp. 

Thank you very much for your input by the way, it is greatly appreciated!! 
Checking them out now! I notice they have a similar video for The Strokes, cheers!
It has an S/S/S pickup configuration. I currently have the Strat, but reading on this sub has made me considering returning it for the Tele. I am quite the beginner, so I feel like the Strat is wasted on me right now with all of the versatile options. Reading here tells me the Tele is more "plug and go" friendly with the pickups. 
Thanks! Sounds like I'll be going with Orange for my next amp. 
What's the model name of the amp? Looking to upgrade from my Fender Mustang to an amp that takes pedals better. 
Joey Votto and the Canadian Goose, name a more dynamic duo.
How do you have the vinyls mounted?
Thanks, that’s the move I made!
6 team league and he was dropped for Ohtani (Pitching). Thanks, will drop Gray for him!
Drop Weaver or Gray for Quintana?

No problem man! I’m like you in that it takes me a few listens to get into a band. 

I was actually a late bloomer with The Strokes, became a fan with their third album First Impressions Of Earth. Through that I listened to their first 2 albums, and I was hooked. They got me into playing the guitar and changed my music taste!

That album gave me my favourite song and video, worth the watch and listen: https://youtu.be/pT68FS3YbQ4
Under Cover of Darkness, Threat of Joy, You Only Live Once, Reptilia, Last Nite, What Ever Happened, Life Is Simple In The Moonlight, Ize of the World, Heart in a Cage. 

Just off the top of my head. 

Here’s an easy way to visual this, the sub had a March Madness type 64 song knockout tournament with people voting their favourite songs onto the next round. You can see which songs made it far to determine fan favourites:

Thanks, I have Votto. I owned Freeman last year, and have some bias towards how great he is (until the injury kept him off my team for a while). Was offered that trade and it was tough to decide!
You can definitely ask for more than DeGrom. 
Who wins this trade;

* Team A: Freddie Freeman

* Team B: Joey Votto
WALL MOUNT THAT SHIT BOIII
Hopefully they fix their merch supplier issues someday.....someday
Yeah I agree, but Alex is right after him for me!
Exactly. Pushing them and spamming them about The Strokes is not going to have any benefit, we just need to be patient. I would much rather let them do their own projects, breath a bit, and focus on The Strokes when they feel motivated to. Would rather wait for, as you said, a genuinely happy version of The Strokes as opposed to a rushed "lets get this over with" version. 

There will be another album, no doubt about it, and we know they like to take their time with these things.

So hyped for the next album, managed to get tickets to their next show in Toronto. JC is the only person that tops Alex Turner as a frontman IMO. 
It does hurt to hear a bit, but I would not look at this too negatively. It's been pretty clear from Julian that with the Voidz he can present ideas, and the guys are all on board and fit in with it. With the Strokes he feels like he would have to force them into a song idea he has, which he hates doing.

Look at QYURRYUS, there is no way The Strokes would have worked with that song the same way the Voidz did. This is why I see the Voidz as something *positive* for the future of The Strokes.

It's been rumoured *heavily* that The Strokes have another album in the pipeline, and hopefully another tour. I would never see the band breaking up, you just have to deal with the fact that they take longer than others to release albums, especially with the other projects the members have (mainly Julian and Albert).

They really dropped the ball...their old merchandise supplier went bankrupt, but they should have sorted that out by now with new merch.

Resorting to redbubble for a Strokes sweater, since there is no other option.
Thanks! 
Where did they find that shirt?! 

Looks awesome man, happy birthday!
Share the exact same opinion with you on the production side. I noticed this as well after their performance of Wink on a Spanish talk show (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v38OUrU4Q), which I prefer to the album version.

I still like the album, it's interesting for sure, but some songs seem a bit too...distorted? Not sure what word to use haha
It's interesting for sure, definitely would not call it my favourite album.

I liked Leave It In My Dreams, Wink, and Lazy Boy, but I agree the production on this album was not my preference. 

Here is a live performance of Wink that I prefer to the album version: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9v38OUrU4Q
Yeah RoF is my favourite album from them. I'm biased since I am a huge Strokes fan, but I have loved everything they have put out, even Comedown Machine. 

If I ranked them personally it would go;

* Room On Fire

* First Impressions of Earth

* Angles

* Is This It

* Future Present Past

* Comedown Machine

Even though I rank Comedown Machine last, I loved that album, cannot wait for the next one! Happy Julian has a creative outlet with the Voidz, rather than feeling stuck with The Strokes. I feel like that will make the new album even better!
As someone that loves The Strokes and was not a big fan of Tyranny, I say you can give it a chance. 

I particularly liked Leave It In My Dreams, which had a Strokes feel to it. Lazy Boy (a song sort of in between the Voidz and The Strokes) and Wink were my other favourite songs. 


If I had a dollar for every time I have watched that 2017 Argentina performance...
Buddy if you think spamming Brick by Brick in every discussion thread, while spamming the sub with Brick by Brick memes is top class comedy you are a lunatic. 
What’s the sub name?
>but not having a tour date near you

I’ve already decided I’m going to spend whatever it takes to go to their next show in New York or South America if they don’t come to Toronto. 
You sound exactly like me, except I got into the Strokes after FIOE. Love everything they put out, and can’t wait for their next project. Since they have not come to Toronto since 2006, I’ve already set money aside to pay for a trip to one of their shows (probably in South America). I like Lazy Boy and LIIMD, but definitely prefer the Strokes over the Voidz. 

In the meantime, have you ever listened to the Arctic Monkeys or Interpol? I get similar Strokes vibes with them. 
I'm okay if they push this stuff back so they can make sure it actually works...

My $1500 phone can't even sort messages in the correct order...
The dedicated GPU model had the fan issue, iGPU models do not. 
If they do then I'll probably be buying an X1 Carbon and ditching macOS. The X1 is the only laptop I can think of that matches Macbook quality, the XPS comes close too. 
Don't play it on PC. I did, ruined playing PUBG on Xbox. Soooo much smoother on PC. 
I can’t be completely certain, but literally every new laptop since, I want to say September, has had the 8th Gen Intel chips. The base i5 8th gen chip (8250) is quad core as opposed to dual core, so unless -Apple decides to use an outdated chip in their laptop (which would be ridiculous) I am pretty certain. 
Can guarantee those people read the signs and do it anyway since they are, well you know, absolute cunts. 
I have a solid desktop PC I built, good suggestion there, not something I thought of. I use Excel (especially VBA) quite a bit, and the macOS version is lacking some features, which is why I bootcamp. 

The route you suggested should be perfect, thanks!
Honestly I would wait if you can. I bought a pair in September, and absolutely love them. That being said the sound quality is average at best, and noise isolation/cancellation is non-existent. If Apple improves on sound quality or noise isolation they would be absolutely perfect, and that is my only gripe with them. 

I would probably have upgraded to the new (rumoured) pair if I did not have to drop another $100 to replace the case that was stolen from me!
That sounds like what I am going to do. 128gb is too small for a laptop, and I could really use that quad-core CPU for bootcamp. 
Thanks! Was worried about quality a bit, but reviews are good enough to take a chance. 
Tempted to try my luck again with the butterfly keyboards at that price, or wait until the 2018 quad-core 13 inch models.
Yeah I would actually put Vancouver above Toronto, it's rough. 
I poke at myself all the time in Rocket League lol. If I miss a shot, fuck up a save, I spam "What a save!".

Agree with you completely, was just trying to indicate that people abusing a company's goodwill can often push the company to change policies. 

Excellent points, and I can see why my comparison was not the best. 
Slightly off-topic, but hopefully Costco's return policy is something that stays, and is not abused by people. Abuse is what forced L.L. Bean to change their lifetime guarantee.

The X screen isn’t that much smaller, the lack of bezels just makes a huge difference. I did the same thing as you, from 7+ to the 10
Check out Fjallraven backpacks, they usually have good prices on their clearance. Make sure it’s the G-1000 material, which can be waxed (they sell the wax) so that the backpack is waterproof. It’s water resistant as is, and dries quickly if it gets wet, but again you can make it waterproof easily. 

Read up on Fjallraven, Swedish company that is known for being BIFL in quality. Just bought a backpack from them for $90 (Canadian) taxes included, which was on sale from $180 (Canadian.

I just realized I did not clarify in my original comment, but I had the case for my X. They did not make the traditional case they had before (with leather buttons), so my options were the Rugged one, Wallet one, or folio one. The Rugged one is the case that has hard buttons!
Wait for the next gen coming out this year. Normally I oppose waiting, since the next iteration will always be better and no point in waiting, but this year is different. 

The new 13 inch MacBooks will be quad-core, which is a big step up from the current dual-core models. If you want quad-core right now in a MacBook, you’d need to splurge on a 15 inch. 

They also may be improving upon the issues that come with the current gen butterfly keys, which *still* cause issues for people. 
Going to look for highlights after work, thanks! 
Proud new T-Shirt fan! Thanks man, I'll be visiting my boys down there soon. They converted me to college football (which is not big at all here up North), so naturally I followed the Aggies. Now I'm into college bball, and naturally went with A&M again.

I would pay so much money to experience that, seeing the Strokes live is on my bucket list, and that concert was the best I have seen. I noticed that as well, that you guys sang the guitar riffs (especially during Reptilia).

Must have been an amazing experience to actually be in that crowd!
South America loves the Strokes. Watch their Argentina concert from last year, I would pay for a trip to Argentina just to see them. Looked absolutely incredible, the crowd was insane. 

Considering they have not come to Toronto since 2006, I’m going to jump at the next opportunity to see them live. Already adding to a Strokes concert fund lol.

Gavin Free is a lucky man
I would keep Vasilevskiy, I don't see Tampa resting him that much. That being said, you could get a huge return for him, since he is a top fantasy goalie. Maybe try and get a huge haul from a team that is desperate for a goalie? I would only trade him if you get a HUGE return, depending on what your team needs right now. 
Drop Allen for Mrazek. With Elliot and Neuvirth out, plus with his recent performances, Mrazek is the number one goalie in Philly. 
Keeper or redraft? I wouldn't take it in a redraft, in a keeper league it would all depend on how many players you keep. 
Those world cup of hockey tickets were so cheap on the resale markets. Saw Sweden play Europe rink side for $30, met lots of Team Europe players (Chara is a literal monster, Josi is a nice guy). 
I would do it. 
I would do it. 
I like Rakell. He's more versatile with his C/LW/RW.
With the way Mrazek has played, I would drop Elliot. Trouba is back on ice (could be a bit before he is back, but shows progress), and Johnson has a separated shoulder. 

Honestly? I would drop Elliot and Johnson. 
Is this a redraft league, and who are your other defenders? Risto is awesome in a hits league if you are short. 
You enjoy life better this way, great mentality to have.

Crap...Allen is a free agent, I am out of adds for this week, and the guy with Price will probably grab him. Considering my goalies are Murray and Holtby, I am in for a wild ride. 
This is one of the reasons in my money league that we set trade review time to 1-day.
Of course they want ALOT, it’s Erik fucking Karlsson.
That’s Facebook for you. 
I seriously don’t get what they gain out of vetoing. It’s such a bitch move. I understand if something ridiculously lopsided comes out, or collusion, go ahead and veto. But who are they to judge who wins a trade, and then veto that trade if it helps someone in a playoff spot. It kills one of the best parts of fantasy sports. 

Fantasy sports are so much fun, wouldn’t call you a loser in the slightest lol, everyone has their small hobbies. There’s a guy out there collecting stamps, he’s probably cool af, enjoy your hobbies.

Then again I’m the guy that had massive excel files I would work on at work for my fantasy leagues lol. Fantasy sports actually helped me learn VBA and python. 
Tell me about it...they’re dicks. I’m getting a new group next season for sure. 
There is a certain group in the league that veto everything, it’s a 10 team money league. Those Leonard trades were vetoed last week, before this news came out (I was receiving Leonard, I’m in 5th). 

Other trades that have been vetoed;

* Marc Gasol for Horford
* Marc Gasol for Gobert
* Davis for Durant
* McCollum for Love
Please save our Holtby
Had a trade of Thomas and Porter for Leonard, it was vetoed. Then had a trade for Porter for Leonard, it was vetoed. I for one would like to thank my atrocious veto- fetish league for vetoing those trades lol.
I’m thinking the same about Holtby at this point. I say that as a Caps fan, and as someone that drafted him in the second round... 
Even David Beckham
Wait for the 2018 MacBook Pro. I know this is said every year, but this time it’s worth the wait. 

Right now you’ll be looking at a 7th gen i5, whereas with the 2018 you’ll be looking at an 8th gen i5. That’s a big jump, as the 8th Gen is now quad-core. 

Another reason is the current state of the butterfly keyboard. Reliability is not acceptable for such an expensive device in 2017. Keys sticking, popping, and the cost of replacing a single key (literally hundreds) are worrying. I went through 3 2017 MacBooks before giving up this year. 
After using a 6 Plus, 7 Plus, and 8 Plus, I could never go back to a phone smaller than the X. The X seems like the perfect size to me. 
It’s a Best Buy Canada policy for hygienic reasons. I think they are the only company in Canada with the policy. 
Wait to see if Washington improves on defence by trade deadling
Vasilevskiy and Hellebuyck are holding their own
I understand the defence took a hit this year, but my goodness Holtby what happened. My biggest draft regret. 
Which is exactly why I said others may have a different experience. In the /r/iOSBeta subreddit others reported the issues I had, I did not assume everyone did!
I had issues when I installed iOS 11, but sounds like you may have a faulty pair if that has been happening since you purchased them! I would take a trip down to an Apple Store, they can replace them on the spot. 
If you are in Canada headphone sales are final once you open them, but guessing you are in the US where that is not a rule!
The beats solo 3s are not exactly comparable to AirPods IMO. The beats are on-ear, which is a different category than IEMs. The AirPods are meant to be the most convenient pair of headphones you can use, and are truly wireless. You put them in your ear, music starts playing, pull them out, music stops. You charge them on the go by putting them in the small carrying case, and simply tap your ear to change songs. You can have one in, leaving your other ear open to listen to your surroundings (which I do at the office, could not use a pair of Beats). 

The Beats win in sound quality, but the Airpods win in the convenience area. It all depends on what you are looking for in your headphones. 
You bet!
There have been many posts on this sub, and /r/iphone about the Space Grey X peeling like this. The display models usually have this, but then again they are treated poorly. It's the users posting about this that is concerning.

* Music randomly pauses when listening through AirPods or Jaybirds (which proves it is an iOS issue with Bluetooth, not a headphone issue). Did not have this issue on this exact same phone prior to the beta - restarting my phone fixes this for a while

Others may have a different experience, just sharing mine. Did not have these issues before installing the beta, but that’s beta life!
Way too early to say. I thought it was fixed, then a week later it starts again. 
I would take that in an absolute heartbeat. Seguin > MacKinnon, Holtby > Gibson. Seguin is only 26 years old, and has been consistently putting up awesome numbers. He also carries that C/RW position eligibility that can be valuable. Holtby has had a rough season because of Washington's shoddy defense, which I can see them fixing by next season. 


I don’t think Burns will be long term at all. He played a bit after his injury, and then was pulled (San Jose won the game at that point, no point in him playing). I can see him missing today’s game, *maybe* the next one, but definitely nothing long term. 
Put him on IR pls Philly
No, not in the slightest. They sound average at best, maybe *barely* better than the EarPods, but basically on the same level. 

That being said, I love mine and would not trade them for any other pair. Most convenient pair of headphones you can buy. 
That's a lot cheaper than I expected, wow...
I have an Apple Watch, and had the same issue. For  whatever reason, I found that I only had this issue when I was wearing my Apple Watch. 

Now I believe this is an iOS 11 issue (adding to the list...), because I did not have this issue before. The way I fixed this (temporarily) was by removing my AirPods from my iPhone, turning off my Apple Watch, restarting my iPhone, and then repairing the AirPods. Then I would turn on my Apple Watch. 

That method has worked for me so far. 
Do you have an Apple Watch or Fitbit?
It’s not his ears, the AirPods are average at best with their audio quality. That being said, I love my AirPods for the convenience, not for sound quality. 
I’m about to drop Holtby don’t @ me. This man has managed to ruin many fantasy weeks. 
Sorry if I caused you stress! But right now I would not panic, your MacBook is definitely not on a fixed clock. It's just the risk that pushed me to return mine, especially considering how soon I experienced my issues before fixing them, and how expensive the machine was.

I hope that Apple does what they have done in the past with these types of issues (the graphics card failures on old 15 inch MBPs comes to mind), and offer some sort of solution when you are outside of your warranty. 

If you do not lose out on much money by swapping, I would (personally) try and swap it out and wait to see if they fix these issues with the 2018 models.

However, to put your mind at ease if you want to keep yours (which I recommend if you are outside the return period), think about how many of these Apple has sold. If they *all* were bound to fail, that would be such bad publicity for Apple, and they would have to offer some solution (as I mentioned the possibility of above). The huge backlash from the battery situation shows that Apple will react to bad publicity.  
Popping sound came out about a week after purchase (returned it). 

Keys sticking happened about a month later, cousin took that MacBook because he would deal with Apple on his own. 

Caps lock was a day after purchase. At that point I returned it and decided I’ll just wait for the 2018 MacBook!

I love Apple. I just wish these issues would stop (iOS and the keyboard), because they still have the best user experience. I’m too invested in this ecosystem!
I love the keyboard, but the reliability is not sufficient for such an expensive machine. 

(Copy and pasted my comment from below):

I went through **THREE** brand new 2017 MacBook Pros purchased at an Apple store, all had some issue with the keyboard. 

* 1: random popping sound
* 2: stuck keys resulting in “rrrrrrrrrrrrrr”
* 3: stuck caps lock and light

Sure Apple is willing to fix/replace your keys now (which involves replacing half the bloody laptop), but what happens when AppleCare runs out? Do you really want to gamble on the Genius Bar throwing you a bone to replace a key on your >$2k laptop for free, when they could charge you hundreds (literally hundreds for a single key) a year from now once your warranty ends?

I know people say “just buy AppleCare”, I should not have to in order to have peace of mind my $2000+ laptop will last longer than a year without needing repairs as a result of dust. 
The hate isn’t for the typing experience, the majority of people can adjust to it. The **warranted** hate is for the atrocious reliability of the keyboards. I went through **THREE** brand new 2017 MacBook Pros purchased at an Apple store, all had some issue with the keyboard. 

* 1: random popping sound
* 2: stuck keys
* 3: stuck caps lock and light

Sure Apple is willing to fix/replace your keys now (which involves replacing half the bloody laptop), but what happens when AppleCare runs out? When you look at the LUDICROUS cost of the out of warranty repair for a single key, you would be criticizing it as well. Do you really want to gamble on the Genius Bar throwing you a bone to replace a key on your >$2k laptop for free, when they could charge you hundreds a year from now?

And before people say the old “just buy AppleCare”, I should not have to in order to have peace of mind my $2000+ laptop will last longer than a year without needing repairs as a result of dust. 
I’m trying to move Kuzy because I feel like I have too many Capitals, so may package him with Gio to see if someone bites. 

Have Pavelski, Giroux, and Backstrom that can play Center. May try and nab Draisaitl
I would take that in a heartbeat 
I would go with Bjugstad, but they are pretty even. Bjugstad just hits/shoots a bit more. 

Just depends on who you have more faith in, Malgin with Hubs/Trocheck, or Bjugstad with Dadonov/Barkov. Both play on 2nd PP unit

> That is until Hoffman gets traded to the Blues

I want this to happen, if I had to pick a team in the West it would be the Blues. Also your username is mint. 
Varlamov, Raanta.
You can definitely drop Kesler. If you really want the C/RW option, Duchene is a good option, seems to be settling in with that Ottawa offense. He should (most likely) be on that 1st line with Hoffman ROS. 
Honestly I think you got a better deal! The 8250 is a big jump from the 7200 that comes with the $799 XPS! You get a quad core CPU that will keep that laptop living longer. 
I would do it, but I personally do not see OEL getting traded. Since your league does not count +/-, that Arizona playoff schedule works well for you. 

>I lose out in blocks, which is a category I struggle in anyways.

Would not be a bad idea to just punt blocks at this point. 
I like Skinner and Perreault
8 team, H2H, Cats are G, A, PPP, SOG, +PIM, Hits

I *NEED* to drop someone because streaming is too valuable in this league (no +/-, so no negative to playing a guy).

My current team;

* C: Backstrom, Kuznetsov, Giroux (LW)
* LW: Marchand, Huberdeau, Ovechkin
* RW: Pavelski (C), Simmonds, Hoffman (LW)
* D: Burns, Ristolainen, Gostisbehere, Klingberg, Giordano
* G: Holtby, Murray

As much as I do not want to, I feel like I will be dropping Huberdeau or Gio (who I am against dropping with his 2nd half resurgence last year). Risto gives me hits. No one will take Hubs in a trade. 


Who should I drop? Thanks guys :(
iPhone X here, I hate it. 

* Haptic/Taptic Engine is incredibly buggy

Apple doesn’t seem as focused on QC as they used to be unfortunately. I hope I eat my words with iOS 12. 
He's on waivers in my 8 team league. If I did not have Holtby and Murray I would grab him!

> What's Simeone doing in the Europa if he's that brilliant a tactician.

Look at the group they were in. They *at least* made the Champions League. 

> We can beat Atletico if we show up.

Over 2 legs? BIG if...
Wenger is not good at adjusting his tactics when they fail. Atletico has it this year IMO, Simeone will destroy Arsene. 
1. Sells all DMs
2. Doesn’t buy another DM
3. Makes a last minute bid for Jonjo Shelvey 
4. Deploys Neymar as a wingback

My beard makes using these things during phone calls impossible. I can hear the scratching on the mic. 

Consider taking them to Apple if you are still under the 1 year warranty!
> i wish they would have embraced the silliness that comes with a comicbook movie.

Nolan wanted to make a “dark” superhero movie. Superhero movies were (and still are to some people), bland. Just because you don’t fit the audience, it does not make a movie “overrated”. You are entitled to your opinion, but it’s not right to call something overrated because you are not a fan. 

That’s like me calling Game Of Thrones overrated because “I wish they would have embraced the silliness that comes with medieval fantasy movies like Monty Python and the Holy Grail”. 
I enjoyed Logan and haven’t watched the old Wolverine movies, give it a go!
That’s what I’m hoping for! I also have in the back of mind the possibility he’s out for the season. But I love the rush of the risk ;)
I like to take risks lol. High risk, high reward. 
> People like you with your ridiculous ideas about what's safe and not safe are the reason people still text and drive.

You don’t deserve a fucking license with that moronic mentality. 
Kawhi owner offered him to me for Porter straight up, accepted it so I’m hyped!
Like a baby xenomorph
Shipping and taxes were included in that price!
Can vouch for this, had the same thing happen to me. Paid for the replacement. 
I lost my AirPods case (long story, AirPods were in my ears luckily), and I talked to Apple who replaced my case. It came to $114 CAD, which is pricy, but better than paying $220+tax for a new pair. 

Go to an Apple Store, or start the replacement process online. If the AirPods themselves are okay, you’re fine. 

It’s also hilarious the size of the box they ship the case in is, it can fit a 15 inch MacBook with lots of room to spare. They do this for shipping size logistics or something, but still hilarious. 
I think the jury is out on Saad. Atkinson is picking it up though!
It's hilarious how much you personally hate this guy. Upvoted because I love salt
Had no idea they changed the payment model (bought it almost 2 years ago). Not a fan of that move. 
Had no idea it moved to a subscription model, I got lucky with the one time payment a year ago I guess!

I wouldn’t go with Strong anymore either then, dislike the subscription route apps are taking. 
Personally I think you’d be giving up too much if you are saying Laine + Kuzy + Werenski for Seguin + Carlson. 

How does the rest of your team look?
Have you tried Strong?
Good catch! I’ll blame autocorrect on that one. 
Considering the “up to 24 hour” reload time on the Presto website, and the number of times I’ve seen the Presto reload machine go down, I can already tell this will be a nightmare. Hope I’m wrong.

Where did the author get that from lol
You win this, take it. You a good enough goalie pair that should hold you over until Smith comes back, apparently the injury is not as serious as it seems. 
You win this trade, do it. If you are worried about it being "even" enough that it is not vetoed, I would not worry, it's fair. 
I would drop Gibson out of those 3, but I would not recommend dropping any of them. Could you not swing a 2 for 1 trade or something?
I would personally do it. However, I saw you post another trade below (Arvidsson + Chychrun for Ekholm + Silverberg), and I would take that one over the Aho one. Arvidsson is a phenomenal player with that top line in Nashville, he will hit 30 goals next year IMO. 

I also am not convinced (as someone who has drafted him twice) of Silverberg. I feel like every year we think "THIS will be the breakout year", but I think the jury is out on him. 

Sure it hurts a tad to trade away Ekholm, but Chychrun has the potential to be better than him. I say do it!

Who uses comma’s in 2018? Complete waste of time. 
Thanks man, was fishing for confirmation my gut feeling was the right move!
That's what my gut was telling me, thanks for the confirmation!
That's my dilemma (no one I want to drop), just wanted confirmation I was doing the right thing by rejecting. I got lucky this season with some buy-low trades (Marchand, Burns, Pavelski) and waiver pickups, so don't want to mess this team up. 
How many keepers do you get? I like Aho, and believe he is better than his stats this year. 
I like team B, whoever is receiving Josi
Varlamov no question. Sateri will take some more minutes from Luongo
I personally would not drop Backstrom or Boeser, but if you were to pick up a goalie, definitely go with Hutton. I believe he has taken the starting role over in St. Louis now, Allen can't catch a break (yesterday's loss was not his fault). 
My finger is 99% on the reject button, but wanted to know your thoughts on this trade.

8 team, H2H, Cats are G, A, PPP, SOG, +PIM, Hits

I receive;

* Tarasenko
* Pietrangelo
* Letang

I give;

* Ovechkin
* Klingberg

My current team;

* C: Backstrom, Kuznetsov, Giroux (LW)
* LW: Marchand, Huberdeau, Ovechkin
* RW: Pavelski (C), Simmonds, Hoffman (LW)
* D: Burns, Ristolainen, Gostisbehere, Klingberg, Giordano
* G: Holtby, Murray

I feel stacked at LW, which is the only reason I did not immediately reject this trade. I would probably drop Risto. Ovi is the number 1 player in our league. I am first place in the league, playoffs are a lock at this point. 
I would not call that trade collusion personally, definitely not veto worthy. Giordano is a 2nd half monster, and Keller could give you some points going forward if Arizona goes on a streak (BIG if). The guy receiving Radulov wins here IMO, but it's not a completely one-sided trade. 
Can you go fuck yourself with the constant spam? 
Appreciate the free service, but I hate Streamable, and wish there was a more used alternative. It’s the only video streaming site my internet appears to have issues with. Even on LTE using my iPhone it does not load reliably.

* Traded Brook Lopez and McCollum for Porzingis

* Traded Porzingis for Durant

Ended up accepting it. I don't think the Leonard owner would offer the same trade if we had a timetable of his return. I agree that Leonard is worth the risk as a potential top 10 player. 

Thanks!
I would do that, especially considering Magic said Lonzo would still be the starting PG in LA. 
If you can manage to pull that off, run don’t walk. 
Even looking past the fact that you are getting Embiid, Mirotic will thrive in NO (will see more minutes with Boogie out), and JV is having one of the better years we have seen from him.

Well done!
Keep Gobert. The Jazz are on fire, and will be making a better playoff push than the Clippers IMO. 
Take that and RUN. Daylight robbery. 
Vucevic > Turner IMO, both carry an injury risk, and Collins does not appear to be breaking out this year.

I would do it. 
Whoever is receiving Harris wins here IMO
With Clarkson gone I think Hart will see solid minutes, I wouldn't worry about Ball being back hurting him. Especially if Thomas is coming off the bench. 
If you are receiving McCollum, JV, and DeCarroll I would take it, I say you win. McCollum is a fantasy beast, JV is having a great year (but dependent on Casey not inevitably benching him like he loves to do), and Predator is having a good year in Brooklyn. 
I think you are giving up too much with Middleton + Mitchell. I would try Middleton + Jackson to start with.
I would take that. Bledsoe is great for CAT leagues, and Turner should be able to supplement blocks later in the season for you. Worst case, ride the waiver wire for blocks, or punt them if you are constantly losing in that category.
I would take it especially with the way Rubio is playing. John Collins was set to break out all year, but I think we know what we can expect from him at this point. 

All depends on if you have other big guys that can fill in for Collins

I would recommend waiting until Friday or Saturday before making a purchase. They have their inventory blowout sale, which is basically a huge markdown on their used guitars and equipment. You can check what products are on sale if you google whatever store you are going to. Each store has different items on sale, it depends on their used stock. 

Eg, not sure which one in Edmonton you are going to, but here is the sale prices for the store in South Edmonton: https://www.long-mcquade.com/promo/BlowoutSale2018/Edmonton-South-Blowout-Sale-2018.html

I definitely recommend trying to get a Fender MiM if you can!
I take it you never worked in retail. Before I got an actual job, I did, and let me tell you it’s ridiculous with the amount of absolute cunts retail people have to deal with. When someone is pissed off at Apple who do they yell at? You. You are the only face they can put to the company. They get harassed, sworn at, and what can they do back? Put on a fake smile and apologized, because “the customer is always right”. 

It can be ridiculously demoralizing, and I can’t imagine what this battery fiasco has done to retail workers at Apple stores. Entitled people everywhere. 
Oh my apologies! Didn’t see that part. 
Sennheiser is a German company, and they are definitely one of, if not THE favourite for audiophiles. They specialize in headphones, and do an awesome job at it. My HD280s weren't that expensive, and sounded amazing for the price. Their noise cancellation is not on the level of Bose, but their sound quality is steps above. 

They are a huge brand, so go to a Best Buy or somewhere and you can probably try some out. I am tempted to replace my QC35s, but just can't justify the cost of doing so. If I did, I would be looking at another pair of Sennheiser's as an option for sure!
No, go to Sennheiser if quality is important to you, Bose if you want noise cancellation. Bose is overpriced audio quality wise, but ahead of the competition for noise cancellation. 

Source: own a pair of AirPods, Bose QC35s, and had a pair of Sennheiser HD280s.

I used a Pixel 2 XL as well for a day, and the apps just felt....sluggish? Not that there was lag or anything, everything just felt more smooth on iOS. Also noticed that resolution scaling in certain apps that looked great on iOS were janky on Android. I just think the number of Android phones with various resolutions makes it difficult for developers compared to iOS developers. 

Just my experience. I will say the design philosophy on Android has come a LONG way, and is on par with iOS. The Play Store is seriously filled with junk though, and apps typically come to iOS because of the huge piracy problem on Android that deters developers away (see: Carrot Weather). 

In regards to iMessage, I think Google needs to get their act together and come up with a good solution. They have introduced so many messaging apps that users are just confused, and it's one of the reasons none of them have caught on. I think if RCS messaging replaces SMS messaging in the near future, Android will finally have a true iMessage competitor.

Unfortunately you will find your options are very limited with iOS, Apple likes to lock users down. I’ve been using iPhones since the 3G,  and we STILL do not have the ability to change default apps. 

What you will learn to love though is iMessage, and the AppStore. I find the apps on iOS are more polished than on Android. 
Unless you’re from Toronto, where you have Toronto FC, the Raptors, and the Blue Jays. Vancouver on the other hand? Well they have an inflated housing market. 
I did the same thing. Bought a squier classic vibe tele, and loved it. Went back to the store I bought it from for an amp, ended up swapping the squier for a MiM strat. They are a seriously good bang for your buck, amazing build. 
If you’re near a Long and McQuade (they are across Ontario) go in and ask some questions. They are extremely helpful, and you can try out the guitars in store. 

They also have a bunch of specials on used guitars. I would throw a curveball if you are willing to save a bit more to get a MiM strat!

I followed him after the QWOP video, couldn’t stop laughing at him back in the day! Glad to see he’s successful. 
First off, thank you SO much for the thorough reply! I wanted an in-depth review before I dropped some money on more headphones. 

>I don't listen to the bass heavy shit that the QC35s are good at.

Neither do I which is why I was considering the switch, in addition to the sound quality. I listen to alt/indie rock (like The Strokes, the Arctic Monkeys), and Bose is not known for being forgiving for this genre. The ANC on the QC35s is incredible, and if the Sony's can hold their own (or beat the Bose like you said), this is an easy decision!

>On these, you can actually turn the ANC off 

They actually have added this to the QC35s now, but I REALLY like that ear cup feature. With the Bose, you have to turn it off in the app, which can be annoying. After reading what you said, seems like the Sony's have a lot more features to offer than the Bose. That ear cup feature sounds perfect. 

>Not only that, there's an "ambient sound mode" which is super cool.

This may actually be the feature that pushes me over. I can't use my QC35s at work because I need to hear people sometimes, this ambient sound mode is just what I need.

I rarely use the app, if ever (other than to turn off the ANC). Funny you mention the colour, I was actually looking at the beige colour. They look really classy, and are on sale right now. 

Thank you!
> i got a pair of sony mdr 1000x 

How are you liking them? I have a pair of the Bose QC35s, and was considering jumping to the MDRs or the Sennheiser PXCs. Are the MDRs comfortable? 
THANK YOU!! I had no idea, I think you just pushed me back to Narwhal!
~~Sometimes I jump back to Narwhal, but I really dislike the lack of a true night mode.~~

Narwhal does in fact have a true night mode if you were like me and did not realize it.
It’s been ridiculously buggy for me lately. The good news is the developer is an extremely nice guy that keeps the users informed. For example, imgur fucked him over recently, which stopped imgur links from loading in the app. He kept updating us in the Apollo subreddit as to what was going on.

Amazing developer, he deserves the constant praise this sub churns out. Also, FUCK imgur. 
The entire point of the AirPods is that there is no wire in the way pulling on your ears. You don’t realize how much that small wire makes a difference until you use them. You sound like the person that loses things easily if think people are losing these left and right. If they’re not in your ears, they’re in the case. These are one of the few Apple products worth the money. 


It’s made by Apple, means it’s shit bud. 

Seriously though, they are my favourite headphones. So convenient, that the average sound quality does not bother me. Have a pair of expensive noise cancelling headphones, and I’m still using my AirPods 90% of them time. 

One of the few Apple products worth the price. 
Wtf? Where did you even hear that...I use one AirPod all the time in the office, and have forgotten one at home without issue. Plus if you lose one, you can go to Apple and buy a replacement pod. 
Welcome to Reddit, every subreddit has its own “circlejerk”. You can live with it, or you can join the “complaining about circlejerks” circlejerk.

Thank you for the reply, but this was about a year and a half ago. I will look for the emails, forget which account it was since I made a new one when I bought the app. 

I apologize for sounding harsh and for my language, but it was extremely frustrating. I also searched online, and found an alarming amount of people sharing my experience. 

With the revamping of the site, are you guys working on fixing the payment process? I have bought the premium one-time payment on the app, but I refuse to pay for the website subscription until the payment process is fixed. 
I refuse to buy UG premium after my experience. Went back and forth for months trying to cancel my membership, and was told it was cancelled 4 times. And yet, after removing every card from my paypal so they couldn’t charge me, I got 12 “hard fail! We tried to charge your account but we were rejected, make sure to update your payment” emails. Eventually just blocked their email address. 

Their app and database are awesome though.

If she’s opposed to the AirPods and their price, I would recommend the JayBird X3’s (especially if they’re on sale, check Best Buy or Amazon). 

I had a pair, and they sound MUCH better when compared to my AirPods (which admittedly, I use a lot more). They have extra foam tips for noise isolation, and removable wingtips (with 3 different sizes) so they can fit your ear properly. 

Read reviews on them, they’re phenomenal. Well built, come with many extras in the box (case, wingtips, earpieces), last me 7-8 hours on a single charge, and absolutely worth the price. Don’t buy the Freedoms, they were a (more expensive) downgrade from the X3s in my opinion. 

Here is their website, you can usually find them cheaper on Amazon or Best Buy: https://jaybirdsport.com/en-ca/x3-bluetooth-headphones.html
Never in my life would I buy refurbished headphones. Here in Canada Best Buy does not even accept opened headphones as returns for hygienic reasons. Once you open them, sale is final. 
Think of the silicone case as Tyler Bozak. It’s good, but it’ll have its downtime (it’s a dust magnet and shows its age easily). 

Think of the leather case as Auston Matthews. It feels premium, gets better with age, and will be worth the higher cost in the future.

Eh, I wouldn’t compare selling a s0 watch in the future to selling a first generation iPhone. The iPhone changed the mobile world, literally. That device changed how we use phones, it’s clear when you see pre-iPhone devices vs post-iPhone devices. 

The first generation watch? Not so much in my opinion. Smart watches were already a thing, and the AW didn’t revolutionize the smart watch industry. That being said, I would never trade my Apple Watch for another smart watch. 

I can see the s0 watch being like the OG iPad, or OG MacBook Air. Being that it would be purchased at an extremely cheap price for a nostalgia trip in the future. 
For $80 though? That’s a good price to use it as a watch and notification device.

[Tim Cook used his original Apple Watch in the shower](https://www.cultofmac.com/313413/yes-can-wear-apple-watch-shower/amp/), so I wouldn’t worry. The issue with water and the non-waterproof Apple Watches are submerging them in water more than a metre. 

Also;

>	The Apple Watch Series 1 has a water resistance rating of IPX7 under IEC standard 60529. ... With a rating of IPX7, Apple Watch Series 1 is water resistant to a depth of one meter (about 3.3 feet) for up to 30 minutes.

You’ll be fine using it in the shower. I don’t recommend testing the “water resistant under 1 metre up to 30 minutes” claim though!

Both mobile operating systems have their pros and cons. iOS is trumped by Android with their notification system, ability to change default apps, and (as small as it may seem) their volume HUD that doesn’t block a huge chunk of the screen. Not to mention when you compare Siri to Google Assistant, it’s no contest. 

That being said, I’m an Apple fan. I have a MacBook, Apple TV, iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch. I don’t see myself switching, I just really like that Android may push Apple to work harder. I’ve been using iPhones since the 3G, and I feel like iOS is stagnating. Features like Animoji’s and iMessage stickers are taking priority over stability it feels like. While AR is very cool, I just want to Apple to stabilize iOS, fix the notification system, add a dark mode, and minimize the volume HUD.

Have driven from Toronto to California twice (awesome trip, the US is beautiful). From what I’ve seen in my experience, Toronto (specifically the 401) houses the WORST drivers I have ever seen. 80km/h in the left lane, merging at 40km/h, cutting into ending lanes to jump ahead. The latter involve people pushing others out of their lane JUST so they can merge back in, and they aren’t afraid to drive on the shoulder. 

I dread driving anywhere near Scarborough, that McCowan express/collector merge before Kennedy offers a dash cam montage worthy clip every time.

Had an X for a week, returned it for an 8 Plus. Took 1 day before I went right back to the Apple Store to return it for the X. 

It just felt old using the home button and those massive bezels, the new gestures are so fluid. TouchID is faster no doubt, but it is THAT noticeable? Not anymore for me. First week using the X I had lots of failed FaceID logins, now it’s rare. TouchID sucks when in the gym or if your hands are wet, while FaceID works fine. 

The screen on the plus feels small for the big size. I used a 7 Plus for a while, and I’d be lying if I didn’t say there were times when I wished it was smaller. Wearing a suit it was easy to just put it in jacket pocket, but jeans or anything else it was a bit too big.

Going to strongly disagree here. I know many people that use the Android Auto app. Why? Because it’s built well, and is extremely easy to use. If Apple manages to build a good Carplay type app that is similar to Android Auto people will (IMO) use it. 

>	I’d imagine not many people actually use the “DND while driving” feature, either

You’re right there, but different scenario than having an app similar to android auto. 
It doesn’t, but people are acting like it’s literally fucking impossible.

Absolutely love it, thanks for posting that!
I’m one of those people. Thought they were overpriced and ridiculous, but decided months after release to give them a chance. Haven’t looked back. 

I use them more than any other pair of headphones, they are ridiculously convenient. The sound quality may be average, noise cancellation may be non-existent, but my goodness are they easy to use. Even when compared to Bluetooth headphones with a bit of wire at the back, they are so much more convenient and freeing. 
I’ve had constant freezing like you that requires a force close. Luckily the developer seems very responsive and active, so should be fixed soon. 

I just hope this app doesn’t turn into Antenna (bugs, not too active dev), because Apollo was finally the replacement for it. 
Honestly right now the XPS 15 is the better buy. I went through 3 2017 MBPs because of keyboard and popping issues (all of them bought brand new, returned) before I just gave up. MacBooks are CRAZY expensive here in Canada for a base model, let alone with upgrades. 

Wait for the 2018, and hope that they fix he keyboard reliability (even if you don’t have issues now, what happens down the road when the 1-year warranty expires), and have a non-TB 15 inch. You can always sell the XPS in that scenario, the 15 inch ones seem to hold their value. The 2018 13 inch MBPs should have quad core processors as well.

I think there are people that dislike the Voidz, and do not like seeing posts about them in the sub. The thing is, what Strokes news is there right now? I prefer the Strokes to the Voidz by a margin, but the posts here do not bother me in the slightest. 

There is more Voidz news right now, so it will be posted here. Especially with the new album coming out, which I am going to use as my way to go back into the Voidz with a more open mind. Just seems people need to learn to keep scrolling, and just chill with the trolling/hate.

100% Boot Camp or a VM. Excel on a Mac is not on the level of Windows. Some VBA features lacking, and it’s much slower on even the newest Mac compared to an older Thinkpad. You notice this when running certain formulas, I especially noticed this during Monte Carlo simulations. 
I wondered this too, and ended up paying the $7 CAD for the app. Have not missed a thing, don’t see the need for the subscription for my basic uses of the app. The watch app is perfect, and the iOS widget is nice. I’d recommend it, you don’t need the subscription at all!

Apps often come to iOS first, and are better designed (in my opinion). Other than that, iMessage and FaceTime have me locked in. WhatsApp is not that big where I am, so I rely on it for group chats and sending pics/videos. 

I would have said the "iOS experience" before, but I cannot say that anymore with iOS 11. I love the hardware of my iPhone X, I just wish Apple would get their shit together with some of the minor annoyances iOS has. I EASILY put iOS above Android for years (have been using iPhones since the 3G), but with Oreo and iOS 11 that gap is closing. I still prefer iOS, but after using a Pixel 2 XL I can definitely say Android has come a LONG way. 

Excited (and hopeful) for iOS 12, because I do not see myself jumping ship.

Went from a 7+ to an X, returned it for an 8+, then returned that for an X again. Once you use the X, the bezels and home button of older iPhones just feel...clunky? Not sure the word to use. 

I LOVE the display, Samsung is definitely ahead of the competition, and Apple made some mods of their own that makes the display even better (120hz touch, not refresh rate). You don’t notice the notch after a week. 

The gestures are so fluid and easy to use, and tap to wake is something I can’t go without now. FaceID has improved a lot for me, and I only get a couple of fails a week now. 

The only things I dislike is the location of the control centre, and that FaceID (obviously) does not work whole my phone sits on a desk. The latter is not really a problem either, as I can just tap in my passcode.

I think I know what you mean, but watch what you say. 
You Only Live Once. Everything about it just clicks, Julian on the chorus, the guitars, the drums, everything about that song live. Watching that Argentina crowd made me realize it may be worth the experience to fly to a festival to see The Strokes play, because they have not been to Toronto in over a decade. 
LOL. I hope you get him, Pavelski is a stud, just a slow start for him. 
Thank you very much for the thorough review! The biggest thing that has deterred me is the pricing (I’m in Toronto, so have to deal with Canadian shipping). It’s already $60, then I have to factor in shipping and potential duties!

I may hold off a bit for a sale if it feels a bit cheap, but it’s definitely on my radar. 
What's the verdict?
No there is not. iOS is now known as a mess when it comes to notifications, Android has pulled ahead (by FAR) with how they handle notifications. 

The good news is that iOS grouped notifications in the past, and with the complaints there is a chance (as slim as it might be) that Apple improves the notification system with iOS 12. The chance that it doesn't change exists because Apple often has a "we already know what you want" mentality. 
Room on Fire is what got me into the Strokes, my favourite album of all time.

The guy drops Pavelski NOW?! When he starts to pick it up? 
I went from a 7 Plus to an X, then returned it for the 8 Plus. After a couple days, I ended up returning it for the X again. After using the X for a week, it's hard to go back to the bezels and lack of gestures on the regular phones.

You don’t notice the notch after a week, and the OLED display is stunning. 

My recommendation? Wait if you can, because "once you go X you can't go back etc.".
There is a difference 100% between the Apple Milanese and the third party ones. That being said, I bought a third party one for $20 CAD. Even a used Milanese would not be that low, and the difference in quality is not worth the premium in my opinion. 

Returned my official band to Apple, because it just felt overpriced. Skeptical of third party Milanese bands being sold as "genuine" on eBay!

> Fuck.... the Yankees?

My man!
I bought both, ended up keeping the X3s, returning the BeatsX, and getting some AirPods. I found the X3s to sound better, and had better noise isolation when paired with the included foam tips. 

The charging was definitely better on the BeatsX as you use lightning, and it has fast charge. My X3s last me so long (7/8 hours easily) that this has not been a problem for me, I just charge them at night. It is annoying that they have some proprietary charger. 
That’s something integrated into the screen, not just a feature Apple decided to turn off for every other iPhone. It would drain battery. 
> The only thing you’re missing is that they don’t fit in everyone’s ears properly.

Good point. I never had an issue with EarPods and AirPods fitting my ear, so I often overlook this. 
Normal use? Yeah they are fine. But in a loud environment (like in a gym)? You will find yourself blasting your music just to drown out background noise. I have a pair of JayBird's I like to use when I want better quality and noise isolation. If the convenience factor is not that high for you, and wires do not constantly annoy you, I think your money is better spent on a different pair of headphones!
In Cook fashion: “Well....to date we’ve paid developers X billion dollars in ad revenue, and we have some new imessage battery stickers. We think you’re gonna love it!”
I use it for tracking stock prices in my portfolio, the fantastical calendar, carrot weather, battery levels for my watch and AirPods, and the news widget (since Apple hates giving Canadians things - still no news app up north).  
> Love that I can have one in and listen to background noise at work in case someone asks a question or what not.

Exactly what I do! Easy to have a podcast or audiobook going, while still being alert to anyone that comes up to talk to me. Plus that automatic pause when you take that one AirPod out is perfect. 
Honestly? Extremely average. I put them near the level of the EarPods, and you better get used to background noise, because noise cancellation is pretty much non-existent. 

But you don't get AirPods for sound quality and noise cancellation, you get them for the technology and convenience! 

The tap to change/pause song, automatic play/pause when you put them in your ear, the ease of use, and the freedom from wires are what makes them a good purchase!
When I first started with them, I considered returning them because the sound quality is average at best, and noise cancellation is non-existent. But after 2 weeks, I decided the convenience factor alone was enough to block out the negatives. Have owned them for a while now, and use them more than any pair of headphones I have ever owned.

It’s mainly nostalgia that makes things like this popular. Personally it reminds me when I first got my iPhone 3G in high school, playing super monkey ball / doodle jump / tap tap revenge, jailbreaking with redsn0w, finally getting to set a wallpaper with iOS 4, etc. Just nostalgia from years past!
You’re entitled to your opinion, and no idea why you are being downvoted, but for me I have yet to use a screen protector that did not diminish the screen quality and looks of the watch. Again, we all have different opinions, and I respect yours! 

You make a good point on the price, but for me the AppleCare is not **just** for the screen, it covers any damage I can do to the watch. That makes it worth it for me. The out of warranty replacement cost is a lot higher than the AppleCare + replacement fee. 
Or just get AppleCare and enjoy using the screen. 
And the stability! Really miss how folders were pre-redesign, so much faster. 
Took it last year online. As ilanae said, you just learn some straight forward concepts, not a "must take course". I recommend it if you are looking for a professionally related course during a tough semester. The whole course was one massive report, I cannot find/remember the exact weighting. 

It was something along the lines of 25% beingyour rough draft, 10% being your proposal, 5% being spelling and grammar, 10% your sources (with a small write-up for each), and 50% was the final draft. 

The professor provided some example topics, and you were able to propose any topic you wanted. I wanted to see what the professor would say if I asked to write a report soccer related (obviously narrowed down in my request), and miraculously she accepted. Was such a fun report to do, discussed ways to improve Chelsea FC through some financial analysis, player metrics, and trends in the sport. Utilized a lot of skills I learned in FIN631/731, and learned a lot about the sport. 
Apple wouldn’t do anything? They give you a 90 day warranty after a repair.

They sure can, no age restriction. If a parent drives their kid to McDonald’s, hands them their credit card, a child can go buy whatever they want in McDonald’s. That’s similar to you handing a child an iPad with your credit card tied to your iTunes account that they know the password for.

The iPhone X is the first phone where I’m not using it without a case. These Apple repair prices are getting absolutely ridiculous. 
If an app switches to subscription, I look for a competitor that offers a one time payment. 
Wow! What concert is that?
Hopefully they come up north! The Strokes have not come to Toronto since 2006, and seeing the Voidz live may be as close as we Canadians can get.
Worst case you would just be future-proofing 
Third party repairs are so hit or miss though, i believe it’s worth the extra money to go to Apple. I’ve heard enough horror stories, and the one time in my life that I went to a third party place to replace the screen on an old 5S, they messed up the front camera (blurry). They were adamant they did not, despite the fact that it worked fine before taking it to their shithole. Had no proof, so was stuck. 

Obviously there are good technicians out there, but I don’t think it’s worth the gamble personally. 
I think having that area be customizable would be perfect, but this is Apple, and customization is not something they focus too much on unfortunately. 
Ice Poseidon. Thought the episode was going to be overhyped when I read the discussion before listening, but that was some grade A old PKA. 
Wow what an experience that must have been!
Have to disagree with you on the keyboard. Having the keyboard on the bottom edge would be a nightmare for typing, and I guarantee people would be dropping their phone more. 
Buddy, clean that screen lol, yikes!
Developers are hurt by piracy on android, the developer of Carrot Weather touched on this when someone inquired about an android app. If you google a popular app that is on android, it usually gives the suggestion “App_Name apk”, probably from pirates looking for the free download. 
If you have not had issues by now, I would not worry too much. 
Went through 3 MacBooks in 2017, keys sticking on one, and a "popping" sound on two of them. For the amount I paid I did not want to gamble on Apple repairing my device if it is out of warranty, considering how ludicrously expensive the repair cost is for the keyboard. Hoping they fix everything with the 2018 models. 
>	MacBooks don’t come with defects as often as they used to.

Until you look at the butterfly keyboards
401 drivers show otherwise 
This is how it was for me working at a bank, no paid breaks. Want higher minimum wage? There are things that go with it. 
It was never exactly like its pictures in the photo above (unless you were jailbroken). Notifications were grouped before, but not like OPs picture. 
>	I know I’m gonna be downvoted to hell for this

Ah, so we’re still whining about fictional downvotes. No idea why’d you think this, since there are a bunch of people that dislike OLED displays on here. 
Amazing how far Google has come camera-wise, when compared to the older Nexus devices. 
Not in the slightest, some people feel entitled despite it being a shared road. We all have places to be. 
Probably agitated by the rubber neck gawkers and left lane campers, so they decided to drive recklessly to get away from them. 
Have you looked at the Bellroy leather cases?

Subjective. I know there is a massive “Bose is overpriced and are literally the worst” circlejerk, but their ANC trumps any other headphones. Sound quality, highs v. lows aside, the ANC on the QC35s beats Sony and Sennheiser easily, enough so that I returned the others. 
Tike Mrout
Do you have the Facebook app installed?
Look at his post history I don’t think he’s being serious lol
Your username lmao
...cannot believe I did not know this, thank you very much!
He's an alcoholic no doubt about it
I prefer Spotify for their playlists, UI, and (much) better music discovery. I could not get into Apple Music, and I despise the design of the app now with that size 48 font.

I never use Siri for picking music, which was one of the appeals of AM. The lack of an Apple Watch app is not a deal breaker for me either, I can still skip/change songs on my watch using the "now playing" screen. 

It doesn't hurt me to pick up my phone to choose a song rather than my watch or voice doing it. I have a playlist I just shuffle for when I'm driving.

Solid input, we truly are grateful to have you in this sub. 
Let me guess, you’re an NFL fan? 

>This is why people don’t like basketball

And yet, the NBA’s viewership has jumped, while the NFL’s continues to fall. But keep living in your bubble. 
They fit better because you don’t have a wire pulling down on them, makes a bigger difference than you would think!
This is just like when those all those unoriginal twats spammed their rip off versions of the game Threes! in the AppStore. The worst part was one of the rip offs (2048) became so much more popular. 
RAM is ridiculously expensive now because of the shortage, Apple tax or not. 
Did you miss the many people defending apple on it?
I know people that were paying almost $100 for 2gb of data, and $70 for 500mb if data...Canada phone plans SUCK. Only now have things started to improve. 
The atrocious keyboard reliability issues deterred me in 2016. This year, I went through 3 MacBooks before finally just returning my 2017 rMBP due to popping sounds and keys sticking. 

The butterfly keys are nice to type on, but reliability is atrocious. Apple has a guide on how to blow air into the keyboard if keys get stuck, not something you want to see in a near $2k CAD laptop with 128gb of storage. 

I understand Apple swaps them out or fixes any issues you have, but are MacBooks not known for longevity? So what happens in 2/3 years when your warranty is up and you continue to have these keyboard issues? You gamble on Apple still supporting them, or else you’re out the $550 CAD repair cost for the keyboard. Again, not what I wanted to see with the price I was paying. 

Just giving my opinion. 
I paid for AppleCare+ on mine, the cases I saw made the watch look like something out of fallout. I go careless and if it breaks, I’m covered for 2 years with 2 accidental damage replacements (with a cheap deductible). 
You seem to be taking it more seriously than me, considering how much you are spamming this sub. Time well spent for you I guess. 
You need to go out more dude
Source? Sounds like a DailyMail rumour. 
You did exactly what I did! I got the X, decided it was too small, got the 8 Plus, and then went back to the X. After using the X with the gestures and form factor, the 8 Plus just feels...old. I always liked using gestures (something I liked on the old Blackberry Z10), and the tap to wake feature is awesome.

The screen is better on the 8 Plus for videos, but it wasn't really a huge issue for me when using the X. I do not notice the notch at all anymore. Surprisingly the screen difference was not drastic for me personally, unless it was using night mode in an app. 

People have different preferences, so it definitely comes down to what is most important for you in a phone OP!
>	Way to be a dick and try to twist some words. 

Wasn’t my intention at all, but I’m sorry sensitive pumpkin. 
Wow today I learned! Thank you very much. 
>	If not you’ll need to buy a $150 adapter

A DVI to HDMI adapter wouldn’t work? I use one fine on an older monitor I have. 
No, google.com should be. 

Edit: lol some of you are lazy people eh 
Excellent point, thank you.
If you don't care about it as an investment, why do you care about the investors that are selling their coins? The value should not matter much to you, it does to the crypto-investors that are looking for gains. 
If that's a tantrum to you, it's clear you stay indoors a lot. 
This guy sure loves to talk
No one can give you a definitive answer. That being said, it looks like Bitcoin could fall a bit further, and litecoin usually follows it down. 
Yeah, they dictate the market a lot on Quadriga. They create buy and sell walls which blocks the price from adjusting to other changes in a timely manner. Probably going to move to binance, and just use Quadriga to withdraw in the future. Quadriga does not really have an incentive to do anything about it, as they make a lot of money on their high fees. 
Quadriga is a terrible platform honestly, there are bots that force a huge variance in price through massive buy and sell orders when compared to other exchanges. Bitcoin and Litecoin will be rising on other exchanges, but will be stuck on Quadriga, and vice versa. 
Oh, I’m sorry for sounding like a dick!
What is the point of your comment?
I mean a Canadian was literally just nominated for MVP in your national sport, but you do you. 
Certainly is a unique way to spell it
You support the show 
I used this app for years, but man has it gone downhill. Seems like when the “force touch” update came out the quality of the app diminished substantially. So many times I would have to force quit the app as it became unresponsive, and you *still* cannot save photos without the app crashing. I’m hoping this gets fixed, and I still use the app, but it’s not as good as it once was. 
What exchange are you using for your pricing?
Higher demand with cell phones using ddr4 ram now
It’s absurd if people believe that Christmas spending is what caused the drop
Lol re-read your comment thread 
Stay tuned for another instalment of “just moved from Android, what are the must have apps?”  
If you dislike the patina leather develops, I would return whatever colour you have and get the black leather or midnight blue. Leather ages and absorbs oils, it’s pretty much inevitable. Your case might not look as worn as OPs down the road, but it is not going to stay looking new!

My series 1 can last me 2 days 
Not sure why they would confuse you considering we aren’t the world. The US is behind us (Canada) in contactless payment systems, hence the popularity of these type of posts. 
If they say that, you tell them you want a piece of ID after you hand them money so you can open it and verify it works before they leave. Better yet, if a seller isn’t willing to let you open the box to verify it’s an actual phone that works, tell them to fuck off and just leave. 

It’s so easy to re-seal a box filled with a paperweight or knock off iphone. She absolutely did not do her due diligence. Christmas time is ripe with scammers unfortunately, and I hope she manages to get something out of this story, as unlikely as that is!
>	"You're not as smart as you think you are," she warned.

Would it not be common sense to **test** the phone and open the box? Simply checking the IMEI and getting a receipt means nothing when you do not test the device...those can easily be faked. 
I know haha. If we got through the 5 year hiatus between FIOE and Angles we can get through this break while they work on some solo stuff. 
If you do decide on the X1 Carbon head on over to /r/suggestalaptop and search for the X1 Carbon. A bunch of those threads have a link to the Lenovo corporate friends and family discount prices. 
The jailbreak community is so toxic now, the golden era is gone. I’ve been jailbreaking since the iPhone 3G and redsn0w, miss the old iOS 3-8 jailbreak days. 
Ecoute has this!
My goodness some people are delusional fanboys that think Apple shits gold products and can do no wrong. 
Do you live in a cold area?
I don’t agree with that one, people were right to complain considering the album was **forced** onto people. It wasn’t until the backlash that apple offered a tool to get rid of it. 
Ah, a level headed person that knows what they’re talking about. So many inexperienced investors here that are just downright gambling. 
Let me buy some Enron stock 
Forsberg wasn't traded for Erat ^ever ^^rightguys
Really recommend reading "The Bad Guys Won" if you have not already! Talks about that era of the Mets, and gives you a lot of insight as to what was going on behind the scenes. 
That would be a Merry Christmas for someone (potentially me), thanks for doing this bud! I wonder if this hits /r/all and you get randoms commenting how much they love "light coins" lol
Nowhere is safe Claude
You clearly care about the points when you are complaining about them lol
I think everyone has a wolf shirt tbh. They just sort of appear. 
Well today I learned, thank you for making me aware. 
THEN PITCHFORKS
Bitcoin could hit 100k, Litecoin could be accepted on Amazon, become the official currency of Switzerland, and people would still call it a bubble. 

Not saying it is or isn't, but "bubble this and bubble that" is repeated as often as "to the moon".
Did they specify what currency the $400 valuation was in? Because It is right there in Canadian dollars!
Neither have I! I use raise to wake more than pressing the lock button, which is why I guess people are having this issue. Have not had a single accidental screenshot. 
No no no sorry! Poor wording on my part haha! 

Just saying I was in a similar situation as you. I was trying to log into my gmail which has 2FA, they text me a code whenever I login to a new computer. When I switched to Rogers, I no longer received any verification codes, so I was locked out of my gmail (like you are locked out of your Coinbase).

I kept trying to login, and after 3 days of countless login attempts I finally got a verification code text that went through. I never used 2FA text codes on my Coinbase account.

Was just suggesting for you to keep trying to login, in hopes of one of the verification texts going through. Nothing to do with Google, was just using them as an example of me being in the same boat as you. 
I had this exact same thing happen to me with my RBC account, they flagged the Interac Online transaction. Called support, he transferred me to the security department, I verified it was me, done. 

There is no risk lol, banks do this all the time. You won't have to call in every time, RBC is just making sure you are the one doing Interac Online transactions, and not someone else. Normal security measure. 
He feels like he is above the world, delusional lunatic but with money.
Do you have the TestFlight app installed?
Please Apple, for the love of God, let us HIDE certain emojis or favourite some. So many pointless emojis. 
You have to ship yours, wait for them to paint, then they ship it back vs. them shipping you a painted pair quickly. Just think of it like $30 expedited shipping. 
You literally don’t notice it after using an X for a day. The time, battery, signal strength, etc. all fit perfectly in those ears. 
Did he say this in an interview? I've been down thinking if the Strokes are going to have a lengthy break, but that excites me. 
I'm not sure if that matters to be honest, but for reference I am using the base chequing account!
Here is what Roger Ver, co-founder of Bitcoin.com (who has recently said Bitcoin is garbage and to invest in Bitcoin Cash), said about insider trading; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONmAixoP83M&feature=youtu.be&t=11m52s

TLDW; He said there is nothing illegal about it. Regardless, not something you want to hear from the guy pushing Bitcoin Cash. 

Check out his twitter if you want some entertainment, he is the biggest promoter of Bitcoin Cash. [Here he is flipping out on a reporter because he said BCash instead of Bitcoin Cash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCOjCEth6xI).

Edit: [He just tweeted that he believe there should not be an SEC, and insider trading should not be illegal](https://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/943635857126445056)
The Mail app has so much wasted space on the iPhone X, I hate Apple's recent UI changes. I guess it's good for those with poor eyesight, but at least give an option to create smaller text and stop wasting space. 
Yeah it's definitely the last resort option. I just managed to get my verification code from Google after trying for the past 3 days, so maybe try ever so often to see if the code eventually goes through? Did not even speak to Rogers, just kept trying and it just went through.
You would have to coinbase contact support, only way. 
That's my fear, because I believe it is a network wide thing, not so much as a "switch" that they can turn off. That's why I was going to try and ask if they can see the incoming message that is being blocked, and if they could just relay that message (or the code) to me.

As soon as I login, changing my 2FA method. The weird thing is that other apps (like Uber and WhatsApp) can send verification codes to me, but Google cannot. Which is exactly what you are experiencing with Coinbase. 
You would being completely honest, just giving an option if you are speculating that BCH will jump up before Coinbase trading opens.
It's remained pretty steady on Quadriga today
Just buy ETH on Coinbase, transfer to Binance, then trade ETH for BCH
Sorry I didn't mean to direct last part at you, was meant for those worried. Even reading my whole comment now I sound like a dick, was not my intention, my apologies. 
It sucks! This is something they introduced last month, I am willing to put up with some spam texts if it means I can actually receive verification codes.

What I would do when you call them again is try to login to Coinbase while you are on the phone with a customer service rep, so you can say the code is incoming now. That's what I am going to do with Rogers when the hype dies down!

No problem man!
I only guessed all of this because I did the same thing (I am guessing) as you. Switched from Telus (who does not block these texts) to Rogers for that $60/10gb plan. 

Bell also blocks them as far as I know, Telus/Koodo are the only carriers that do not. I am currently locked out of one of my gmail accounts because of this crap! 

Two ways you could go about this; 

* A - Contact Coinbase saying you no longer have access to that number.

* B - Try calling Bell, and tell them you have an incoming verification code that is being blocked.

Honestly not sure which method is faster at this point, because not only is Coinbase being hammered, but the wait times for carrier support is crazy from everyone trying to get in on that plan. I would bet on Bell getting back to you faster personally!

I'm waiting until later in the week to call Rogers so I can get into my Gmail. I recommend switching to the Google Authenticator method! 
You say this like your phone screen is on 24/7. I mean, just get AppleCare if you are this paranoid. Or get the 8.
Was this by chance a carrier change in Canada? 

It is not a number porting issue, it's a "short number SMS" issue. Basically your carrier is blocking verification codes from going through due to them picking up the SMS as "spam". 

This was something new certain carriers introduced, and the reason I ask if this was in Canada is due to Rogers and Fido being 2 carriers that introduced this "blocking" in November. 
Have you received verification codes from them before? If so, have you changes phone carriers recently? 
They said "post only mode for at least 60 minutes" about 70 minutes ago. So for all we know it'll be post only mode for the next 10 hours.
Oh don't worry, Coinbase if doing an internal investigation! What a slimy conniving company, glad I left them.
Good luck, I sincerely hope everything turns out okay man.
Binance will allow you to swap coins. Not sure if you can do LTC -> BCH, but I know you can do BTC -> BCH
If you are Canadian I can vouch for Quadriga
No problem, understandable to worry when it appears like your money/coins are missing!
Yeah don't worry yet, the markets and exchanges are hammered right now since the Bitcoin Cash introduction. My buddy is having the same issue trying to move his BCH from his ledger.
It's high demand
They're investigating themselves, this does not mean much... Probably just a PR move
They are in "post only" mode for the next 60 minutes
Keep dropping, I want more
Got in around 100, HODL baby
12pm EST is going to be interesting, looking to buy the dip.
Investigation will probably just be;

"Let me see the numbers, this bad press is crazy! We made that much? Awesome, keep it up! Remember to shutdown trading when people want to sell!"
Yes, be patient. Exchanges are overloaded, 10min is nothing lol 
This dip wasn't that bad compared to past dips
Lol Coinbase investigating itself
Then again it could jump at 12pm est when the new crypto investors on Coinbase try and jump in due to FOMO
Exchanges and networks are overloaded
Also be prepared to potentially call RBC, they put a hold on my bank account after funding Quadriga through Interac Online. 

Understandable being honest, just had to give them a quick call and verify that it was me doing the Interac transactions. 
You need to complete both verification parts in order to get access to all types of funding, but yes that means you are verified through the Equifax part!
~~The fact that you’re downvoted for your opinion is sad, people trying to justify their purchases with downvotes lmao.~~

This was quite the roller coaster. 
Can’t believe I messed that up, not the first time too haha. Thanks!
Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Fantasy sports are the only reasons I use it. 
Yeah I sent the trade to the Whiteside owner, giving him a day before getting back to the Gobert owner. 
Thanks for the input, I think I am going to do it. 
Someone offered me Gobert for Porter straight up, am I a fool for thinking of rejecting it? I have some injury prone players already which makes me weary. 
If you can get past the wait times, Quadriga is the best platform for Canadians IMO. 
Otto Porter
Shutdown risk
They are overloaded, as are many other exchanges. You will get your money. 
Some people need tellers, bank drafts immediately, large withdrawals, etc.


You can use a 16 digit card as long as it doesn't have the VISA logo on it. For the Interac Online process you just login to your online banking for RBC. Just got my transaction (deposit) confirmed by Quadriga, so I can 100% confirm this works. Have not done a withdrawal yet, so won't vouch for that. 
I actually used RBC! They support Interac Online, my card looks exactly like this (minus name+number obviously): http://www.rbc.com/newcomers/_assets-custom/images/rbc-clientcard-personal.jpg

^
That is the standard RBC card, I don't believe you need a 13 digit card for Quadriga? Can confirm the 16 digit RBC card worked. 
Well that is reassuring at least! 

Could be because I am on a new account and need to change something, will try support when they aren't overwhelmed haha.

Thanks for the reply!
Does it come from a short number (5/6 digits)? Those are the ones Rogers is apparently blocking, which I am guessing Google uses for my account for some reason.

I can receive SMS messages from other people, so I know it's not that. I also managed to receive SMS verification codes on my phone on Sunday when I was with Telus (who I read *does not* block short number messages). I reset network settings on my phone, rebooted, nothing. 
Those calls are recorded, report what happened because that is ridiculous. 
Quadriga should still have interac online withdrawals, which I believe are a min. of $50. Coinbase and binance won’t allow you to withdraw funds into a Canadian bank account, so I would keep a Quadriga account for withdrawals. 
It sucks, but you are getting lumped into a queue with those trying to get to retentions in order to change their plan. If you go to another carrier and port your number, it starts the process of cancelling your old service. 

I went to a Rogers store because the Telus wait times were crazy and they would not switch my plan in store. Ported my number in the Rogers store, Telus service cancelled. 
Can't even imagine haha, at least it's almost over! Happy holidays. 
Honestly at that point just go to another carrier and port your number over, that's what I did. 
> I'm busy

So are they, which is why the wait times are so long. I was 1071st in line for Telus online chat support, you need to realize the number of people trying to get these plans is substantial. 
Must have been crazy for you guys! I think people need to realize that systems *CAN* crash, and the number of activations the past 3 days must be ridiculously higher than normal. 
It's for a complete plan, [here are some details for each carrier](https://forums.redflagdeals.com/cell-phone-plan-megathread-10gb-60-2155328/). 

Rogers and Fido have apparently extended the offer until the end of today (originally set to expire on Dec. 18th), so I would do your research quick!
Can't believe I missed that haha. Thanks for the quick reply, I subscribed!

Merry Christmas, and happy holidays!
Best way I know now is to buy some bitcoin/litecoin/ethereum on Quadriga or Coinbase, transfer to Binance, then swap your bitcoin/litecoin/ethereum for ripple. Binance has every coin you can imagine.
What type of withdrawal did you try? Coming from Coinbase who has their own issues, it seems like Quadriga is not the exchange I thought it would be. 
No, was a new customer leaving from Telus! I believe if you were trying to switch your plan with your current provider (ie, Rogers to Rogers rather than Telus to Rogers), they would tell you to call customer support.

I went to Telus, they told me to call corporate support, so I just went to a Rogers store and switched. Was on hold with Telus corporate for 2.5 hours a week ago, did not want to hear what the wait time was with the new plans lol. 
Is it bad that this does not seem that bad to me? Just switched from my Telus corporate plan, and going over 600mb raised my bill from $62 to $122. Roaming was also $5/mb. Hurt to pay $300 to switch (then again, I owed them that for my phone), but the overages were ridiculous. 

Personally I don't see myself going over 10gb, but thank you for the warning OP!
That sucks! Any way you guys could take emails, and then send out a bulk email when you get some more in stock? Hoping soon, but understandable considering the huge demand. Thanks for the great service!
Quadriga seems to be best option for us Canadians, but that is not saying much. Don't believe any time frame they give you, they clearly do not have the resources to handle capacity, and temporarily blocking applications to get through the huge backlog is apparently impossible for them. 

I recommend trying to get verified as soon as you can, because you will be in for a wait. Took me over a week, some people it took 2 weeks. 
Just did an interac online fund, "your transfer has been flagged for manual approval". Fed up with Quadriga, hire more staff, or block new applications until you can get your shit together. Considering how long it took to get verified despite the "24-48 hour review time", I have no faith in Quadriga getting ANYTHING done within their specified time frames. Their word means nothing. 
He probably believes it’s homosexual people causing him to be single, when it’s just that he’s a piece of shit. 
I found with wind the cost savings weren’t worth the no signal/roaming zones. Inside the GTA? Golden. Outside the GTA? Let’s play “will I have signal today!”
> Rogers' support website that would actually put you in a queue

Telus was nice enough to put you in a queue without any hassle, only problem was I was customer 1071 in line for the online chat lol.
Anyone switching plans know if cancellation fees are still a thing? I was on a Telus corporate plan, and I know I have to pay $320 as my device subsidy, wondering if I am going to get nailed with a cancellation fee as well.
Went into a Rogers store Sunday morning, no wait. 
> Pavelski

Missed out on him on the waiver wire, cannot believe the dude dropped him (who is in second place). He also messaged me (I'm commissioner) as to why he could not drop Matt Murray, then he offered me Murray for Bishop. 
Both good points, touché. 
> the quality is insane

Considering how much I paid in Canada ($80), it better be!
Still young, I have high hopes for him. Wait, am I one of those people overrating him?!
I haven't heard many Jays fans hyping Tulo the past 2 years, I would say Pillar is more overrated than him. 
Other mice work when you use the same USB port? If it is not a driver issue, and the G502 works with another laptop, sounds like a port issue. 
Yeah I kind of wished everyone used WhatsApp, but iMessage is definitely king when it comes to my area and age group.
Those big ass bezels though, plus no one is taking away my “tap to wake”. 
iMessage 
Some people have different priorities. It’s like the whole “iPhone EX v. iPhone TEN” pronunciation that offends people. 
With Freedom you also get to gamble on whether or not you will get service outside the GTA. 
I didn't either for a bit, [but this is what OP is talking about](https://imgur.com/k0X0Ul3).
The inside of them is a microfibre material. The space between the case and phone is so thin, I don’t think you would need tape. I had a magnet I would put between my 7 and the Apple leather case I had, worked perfectly. 
Had to perfect that red dot
If the billions of other posts like this haven’t changed the way developers post their change-logs, I don’t get why we need more lol.  
Well now I look like an idiot, touche!
I mean, people have been saying that for how many years? It's a gamble, but there is a chance crypto is here to stay.
They added a bunch of cryptocurrencies to the terminal. It's promising, but I wouldn't say this is something that will cause a major push. 
Fair, but don't you think 8gb is a bit unreasonable? There has to be cache or something else, my iPad Pro only had like 4/5gb taken up by the system OS. 
I didn't take offense, just saying what you sound like. I'll stay on reddit, but I appreciate the warning! If that's your definition of a joke, I recommend staying off reddit.
Something along the lines of woody not loving her 
What? 8gb is ridiculous for the system to be taking, this is a mobile OS. 
Read his other comments, pointless to argue with him. 
You’re not everyone, my goodness you sound like an arrogant dick. 
Probably June, no set date yet. 
Every MacBook except the air has used the butterfly keyboard since the 2016 models. You could look for refurbished deals on the apple website (I wouldn’t get refurbished anywhere else, apple refurbished are pretty much new) for 2015 models. 

They improved on the butterfly keys with the 2017 models, but issues still persist. Personally I would get a 2015 refurb from the apple website, or get the air. The only con with the air is the screen being a tn display (less viewing angles v. a Retina display). 

Check out some YouTube videos on it before you buy it! 
AppleCare+ my dude
Cross post this to /r/iWallpaper , you’ll find nice ones over there too! For iPhone X wallpapers, I recommend /r/Amoledbackgrounds   
Guessing they mean one that sort of incorporates/acknowledges the notch
Get 256. Apple is a complete joke with their 128gb entry storage at that price. At least in Canada where you will pay over 2k for a dual core base spec 13 inch with a 256gb ssd. 
Honestly if you can wait, do it. I went through 2 rMBPs this year because of the keyboard and popping issues. There will be people that don’t have the issue, or say that a can of air will help, but look at how much you are paying. 

There’s no telling in 2 years when your warranty is over what happens, because the replacement costs from a single piece of dust getting under your keyboard is ridiculous. You shouldn’t have to stock up on air canisters, and the number of reports I read on here with butterfly key issues should have deterred me in the first place. 

Personally, wait for 2018 model, where they hopefully fix the keyboard issues. 
Picture of it? Could slap a skin on it. I can vouch for Dbrand, and they have sales often (wait for Boxing Day if you can). Slickwraps has good reviews too. 
Assuming next season which has better FAs
Winners. Got a pair of nice leather gloves that work with touchscreens, only $29. They definitely have warm gloves that work with touchscreens for <$20
Unfortunately she passed away. I respect woody for even doing the show, let alone taking some time off. 
So Noel all over again, that is tucked. 
In a 1 for 1 trade?!
Lazy people cannot even click a link, and then get offended if you call them lazy, it's hilarious! Luckily they can just downvote if they get offended, rather than take the time to type out a comment, which can be tedious work. 
Thanks for that image in my head!
Former teller from one of the big banks in Canada, TD should have refunded them already. When we issued bank drafts, customers get a receipt. In the event of a lost/stolen bank draft, they can bring in the receipt and we can pull up the status of the draft (deposited, cashed, outstanding). If it was outstanding, we could just reverse the transaction instantly. 

If it was deposited/cashed elsewhere, we would have to start an investigation. I never saw that happen, there is a reason banks would not accept drafts unless the name matches EXACTLY what the name on the account is.

UPS is at fault for losing the package, but TD is more at fault. This should be bad publicity for them, not UPS. 
Imagine a 400 pound Cousins coming at you down the court
This could be huge once Disney pulls their media (and Fox's) off Netflix onto Hulu, interesting to see how the markets react once we know what their streaming plan is.
Is it your day job to shit on the iPhone X? Maybe work instead of complaining about others choices and you can afford the next one. 
If you can manage to open an account and get verified, people have waited 2 weeks now! I've only been waiting a week, but they are really overloaded. 
The Coinbase app is awesome, I use it everyday. I think the app has allowed people to jump into trading crypto easily, so I would say it *appears* to be the most popular in Canada.

Quadriga definitely has that opportunity to become the best exchange in Canada. I wouldn't put either Coinbase or Quadriga ahead of one another right now, since both have issues. I prefer the ease and UI of Coinbase, but the platform and options with Quadriga.

I did not touch upon it yet, but you are absolutely right on Quadriga falling behind if they do not add more coins like Coinbase is slated to do in the coming year. [This comment from them should be encouraging, but time will tell!](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinCA/comments/7jekwq/quad_more_coins/dr5u6mf/)
Yeah I don't leave my coins on the exchange, but you lose some money on transfer fees doing that method (transfer, transfer, sell), and it's easier just selling and withdrawing on one platform.

Last week Coinbase went down for me on several occasions, and caused many people to miss opportunities. Feel free to correct me, but I did not see reports of this issue with Quadriga. Browse /r/coinbase and you will see that. 

Coinbase also caps you at a $250 limit for a while, could be 6 weeks, could be 6 months. I've been using the site for a month and I am still capped at $250 (despite ID verification the day after I made my account).

I hope Quadriga introduces more coins, but also hope they fix their verification and clearing times. I used Binance just so I could trade IOTA.
Not sure what the benefit of Coinbase is to Quadriga, as they have had their own issues the past week. Plus they removed the option to withdraw in Canada. 
You are being downvoted into oblivion, but you are absolutely right. Even if it was not clear for everyone what the name was, all they had to do was click the link and BAM, name of app with an appstore link. 
It's pretty random it appears. There was that post where someone said they have waited 2 weeks now, and people that applied much later than that guy were getting approved. If nTrust traded LTC I would have jumped ship already.
I only have EQ verification, waiting on second verification. I can only do a wire transfer or use crypto capital, no EFT, etransfer, or Interac online options available.

Not sure why Quadriga boasts that they offer "2 methods of verification, you only need to complete one" when it's pointless to complete one. 

They have a lot to improve on, but going to give them the benefit of the doubt with the backlog they have. I have waited much longer than advertised, but still giving them a chance.

You must have an exciting life for a nickname to bother you this much. 
He looks like a fucking horse. All those bribes and he couldn’t get a better dentist? Guess he spent it on those lips. 
Wait Australia has the news app? Thought it was only the US! Wtf did Canada do to Apple to deserve no news app. 
> Currently best in canada.

Agree with you there completely, and in my opinion, it is the best platform available right now that lets you withdraw in Canada.
Every exchange is overloaded right now with verification, go look at the Coinbase subreddit. Not saying Quadriga is the best exchange you can use, but it's not like there is some exchange instantly verifying people in this boom. 
I think it is help@quadrigacx.com
I believe so, they must have a huge backlog. They've suspended e-transfers right now, I read that somewhere on this sub. They probably want to finish processing existing etransfers (like yours) before taking new orders.

I wouldn't panic yet.

Edit: [Confirmed, they are saying they have a backlog to go through.](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinCA/comments/7jjbkb/quadriga_etransfer_funding_not_showing_up_after_2/dr6xade/)
They said they were getting through the backlog and should be good to go Thursday (today). Fingers crossed, because I am waiting too. 
>	how is lack of lack of touch ID subjective?

Its subjective because some people love it and others do not? Google the definition of subjective, I’m sure you’ll be pleasantly surprised. 

Keep enjoying that circlejerk of yours. 
Gonna take a wild guess and assume it’s AR Lyrics
Even without IR I have no clue how he’s available in a 16-team league, do you guys only have 2 bench spots or something?

Get him ASAP
I don't think the difference is that noticeable no?
Thanks for catching that, you are right!
Sounds exactly like Toronto 
Rumours point to December ~~22nd~~ 21st, which is the same date it started last year!

Ouch
I had this issue with Spigen glass protectors on my 7, went through 3 of them, all had this issue. 
PayPal 
iTunes has been a clunky mess for years, don’t hold your breath on them fixing anything anytime soon. 
Message iTunes support, they’ll probably refund you or give you the English copy. Never heard of this happening personally!
All the big reddit apps utilize 3D Touch; Narwhal, Antenna, official app. 
Silver was sold out for a bit, but the past month I could go into any store and get at least a space grey!
Got mine 30min ago without issues, used PayPal. 
Link through PayPal, just used the site for the first time ever and got my code, I’m in Canada. 
Just bought through CDKeys and got my code, downloading now. In Canada. 
Only 3000 rubles for the Russian accent dlc!
Which literally happens with every game release, and megathreads rarely work. Just keep scrolling, it’s not that bad....
There’s a store by me that’s been selling the game since yesterday
Added to my reading list, thanks!!
How was the book, worth the purchase?
Noise cancellation is non existent on the AirPods being honest, AirPods and background noise are best friends. Got a pair of Jaybirds for the gym for that reason, that said I use my AirPods more than anything. 
Ovechkin :(
I think they brought the sign back just so people had something else to complain about. It’s like the sign is parking in the bike lane. 
A Barcelona fan complaining about fans throwing stuff, rich lol. 
Quadriga is good if you’re Canadian!
Fair point!
It also houses the most unreliable MacBook keyboard of all time 
Good luck!
I don’t think I’ve ever seen a post here where the comments don’t argue how wrong everything is. 
I deal with that in Toronto everyday. Those people that think they are more important than everyone else, and deserve to be at the front of the line. Infuriating. 
Thanks for the input man, not a basketball expert so still learning!
I drive an Audi and I see pricks in every make and model, even Audi drivers. I just always wondered what made BMW the worst out of the bunch. 
But why BMW over Mercedes and Audi? The CLA250 is pretty cheap for a luxury sedan, and I see as many of those cutting people off as I do BMWs. I see your point though, explains why CLA250s drivers act entitled, perfect for "flexing on a budget".
