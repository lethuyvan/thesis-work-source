See! I even can see her on top 3. Idk maybe its her charisma. Im gagged
Thank you sis ‚ù§Ô∏è lots of love to you as well 
I really can relate to her bcs i, inside have such low confidence that makes me start thinkin that i don‚Äôt deserve anything good. The feeling that hating myself and don‚Äôt believe in myself that i deserve and capable of doing anything. Im happy i picked my flair
PURE ART
I didnt read ANY s10 spoilers

And to be honest i didnt expect to see mayhem to go this fast. In my mind, she‚Äôs one of the most polished queen of the season

But then again i think maybe its true that she‚Äôs not as Big as the other girls. And her fashion is probably sometimes out of date. I wish the best for her

Team up with TKB
If they put Aja in the bottom for bad reference explanation then why they saved monique ass? I mean, the album was just released couple years ago

Jk dont take it personal twinks
Of season 10? Sorry Milk but this is my trade of all season. 
All aquaria‚Äôs looks are my taste
This
On serious note please someone convince me that was Ru bcs (for me) she looked so white in that episode
Miss congeniality 
From the beginning i decided to put my season 10 flair, i directly put miz cracker, never changed it ever since.

Is it enough or i have to make complete narrative about how and why and when i picked my flair?
I took my flair after 2nd episode bcs i wasnt sure who to pick. 
What loss? 
No. The race is all that matters for me. I said for me. Sorry i dont follow lot of girls after or before race

Thats why i said ‚Äòor we just haven‚Äôt seen it‚Äô

Or may be i havent seen
Thanks buts still too dumb to differentiate vague and fake lol
Omg pardon this stupid asian bish. Yes youre right sorry i dont speak English 
Disagree sorry i love him
I kinda think they will keep vixen at least until top 5, i mean they kept derrick and vixen drag is actually pretty good

Im not team blair but i really want her to win now. I mean she‚Äôs incredibly talented and she‚Äôs young. I know we have tyra and violet but both winnings (controversially, and I disagree) were questionable. I want blair to represent the youth drag. Or eureka. I want some diversity in winner circle 
I don‚Äôt necessarily agree but i love analytical response thanks!
Yuhua on 2nd place i could not believe it. (I mean im happy to see it)

THANKS boo
She aint lying. I mean, Dela gave it to her intentionally so it was hers
NO TOO FAKE

thats the current one my brain is tired cant remember old ones
Can you spoil me the current list please
Omg i almost picked yuhua (or eureka) but I swear to God i picked cracker from the beginning. 

I swear to god
6 as2

And s3
So monique is 5th runner up?

JK 
You got mine boo. Im asian
Monet reminds me a lot of bob (sue me) but either less talented or we just haven‚Äôt seen it
Same i was so focus on as3 so i skip this season spoilers. I feel like Blair is really doing great and i think she‚Äôs my most favorite addition of the winner circle 
Dusty is the hottest among all s10 man
I love season 8. I love the girls and the challenges. It‚Äôs just not a season i will ruwatch constantly because

* too predictable winner
* rupaul‚Äôs best friend race (the drama didnt seem genuine at all)
* only 12 girls. With double elimination and questionable returning queen. Sue me
Why eureka placed so low on the next episode prediction?
Im so distracted by her majestic nose 
My tickle bone feels very attacked 
She reminds me of one antm girl 
I was really dont care for her but now she‚Äôs my savior
I love Yuhua!!!
The trinity taylor of the season
Omg i love you sis üòÇüòÇüòÇü§£
I hope i can be as rich as you so i dont have to sell my old phone to get the new one
Hi there cutie
Come on old school antm. Tyra will save this gurl till at least top 6 to make the show hilarious no matter how terrible their pictures are. She‚Äôs always kinda be like ‚Äòbut i like this picture tho‚Äô
I need this for my phone wallpaper

Tag yourself im the lady in blue on right
Yes. Sorry
My favorite morning news anchor tbh
Well there‚Äôs nothing for her to fix to begin with tbh. 

And you compare her mug to aja‚Äôs old mug

Thith......
Dela‚Äôs lip-sync ability  i never knew she had in her sleeves tbh
Then the finale comes and the crown queen is?
5 challenges win
5 challenges win
This is my kind of hall of fame.
I do. Because im lonely
Actually it‚Äôs villaintina & lord dela.
On serious note i don‚Äôt necessarily see the hate for her like i saw for roxxxy or phip or tyra. Or the less extreme, current hate of milk, or alaska of as 2. No. It‚Äôs just. This sub kinda, discredit **her time on race**. Like, some people keep saying dela is the real top 4 not derriene. Or some bunch of people joking about Shea is the real winner. There‚Äôs blatant difference between hating and kinda discrediting someone
2 out of 4 are my all time favorite 
This what if question, You just want her to win. Dont worry she already did
I dont hate pearl

I hate her for being on top 3

Im being real, im shangela, i keep it real
My winner
I think she wore part of it on after elimination video on youtube
I tried to put infamous gurl take it easy gif by alaska and i failed

On serious note i respect her decision 100% and beyond. But this is my art. I cant change it for anyone
Ok wow your profile pic (2)
Im glad toxic said this. 
Max instead of Mariah and im good.

Trinity can win as5
Just say Trixie. (1)
Omg i hope i was as talented as you 
Unpopular opinion but trixie‚Äôs look didnt do anything for me. It‚Äôs predictable basic trixie. 

Sue me
Exactly 
Unpopular opinion but trixie‚Äôs look didnt do anything for me. It‚Äôs predictable basic trixie.

Blair is kind of twink i like
Those nipples 

I cant say nipples?
As interesting as it could be, Im not either. 
Im a huge robin fan and im agree with this, in term of creativity of exploring her ability 
Sometimes i wonder is it possible that the production team paid naivesmalls to spread false rumors. Not 100% false. But the core ones. To make it believable (okay i used jinkx perfume too much this morning)
Haters may hate. #realwinner 
Ginger is asian?
Too much T in this thread 
Are you indonesian?
This is really disgusting. Go outside. Go walk children in nature. Its just a tv show
That poster looks.... good
Is that Ru eliminating my favorite every season?
I agree actually 
For most moaning on Tv herstory
People seemed to cant enjoy joke anymore
Im okay with it. They dont have to educate me all the time

[i dont know Celine,](https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/files/2015/03/17/tumblr_nld8xkFLWp1qiohboo10_500.gif), i know her songs, not herself. I genuinely ask you guys is she really tammie brown-ish like this in person?
Now, run devil run & party!
This mv brought me to kpop and i never find the way out
If courtney wasn‚Äôt invited for next Allstars......
Idk but i just really wanna see cheech and kennedy to slay, like how i know they could
Oh jesus, gross
I agree she didnt do the best

But i also agree that she got the worst material to workin with
To be fair, i kinda agree that her lines were not funny at all. I mean, when you have something like they did for mariah 

Poor girl
Bendelacreme. 
Aja 1st runner up
The new princess disastah looks like cute starter pokemon next to her final evolution form
All hail the new glamour toad omg cant stop cackling 
I dont watch unhhh (sue me). So trixie. She‚Äôs really way more outspoken and funnier
It was good. Aja Dela and Bebe NAILED the shit. But as a fan of both kennedy and chichi, i was really really disappointed. I expect so much better than that. 
I just watched the show and i cant even remember what did Milk do
Top 2/4

Raja-Manila
Bianca-Adore
Sasha - Peppermint
Tyra - Raven

Im sorry my dear but you are up for elimination 
I hope chi chi will strike back real soon 
Bebe looks so STUNNING

Not a popular opinion but i really hope Tyra will do it again as well
Omg i need this
Naomi did so well in Music Video challenge imo. They both should‚Äôve shantayed (i dont want them to eliminate kim)

Im wasting my time worrying [spoiler](/s Trixie) joining the winner circle while someone like Manila isn‚Äôt 


Not that i hate [spoiler](/s Trixie). It just doesn‚Äôt feel right
Definitely Manila


Even though i dont like this bih bcs of what she did to my fan favorite, i also would say Shea

Both of them.

Lowkey think Detox deserves it. And Courtney because she educates people. 

Also ginger and dela. Bcs they both slayed their og season. 
I want producers to lock Nina for AS4

Shes worthy

I dont think that‚Äôs racist. Its just my opinion tho
Thank you im just making sure :) thank you

Manila definitely deserves the spot
Idk but do you think the FPR girls need to be rotated at this point? Ps: I dont hate them 
I want roxxxy to be my drag mom tbh

What if serena didn‚Äôt read books.

I will read more books, study harder, get higher final score and better career without worrying i would look like serena. 
What if shea pull some tricks for the final lipsync

What if trinty choose shea for final lipsync 
Youre ready to die?
Whats so being rude of saying fame looks like jade jolie? Im just afraid some over sensitive twink like you take it personal so i put  precaution. I love fame and I personally like jade... 5Gs
Why trixie looks like a ventriloquist doll
All T no shade
This is not an offense but this video reminds me of jade jolie
Omg agree 100% i think its unnecessary to put shea, trinty and val in the same season because each of those bitches deserves their crown 
Agree. I hope its val or trinity

Im cool if its shea. She deserves it anyway
From fan favorite to AS4 winner. Haters stay depressed 
Hmm choices 
Bianca vs Raja. Damn. Any tips?

I agree with this 100%
Looks like the tuck
Cucu?
I love-hate Aubrey O‚Äôday. She‚Äôs fierce but really she‚Äôs kinda too mouthy
Chichi
Morgan
Dela
Kennedy 

In that order
Theyre having comeback. Good. As a rookie, their promotion kinda lack. Or its just me. I mean, they need to promote more songs.
Tbh for me, following the pattern of past AS winners, Dela deserves it the most. 
Omg yas 
Max
I wanna see less popular queens who maybe aren‚Äôt that funny or maybeeeee dont have such big big big personality, yet have talents to show

My top 3 list includes Max, Ivy Winters, and Lineysha


That‚Äôs true but part of me still think that her mug as whole looks like Val‚Äôs

I mean, first naomi. Now this. Im not saying Aja doesn‚Äôt have her own aesthetic. Maybe she likes to take inspiration from other queens

This is just an opinion. Im cool with her and anticipate her on AS3.
Zorobin. I love this ‚Äòtheory‚Äô lmao
Youre the only one who understands me here :(
A super fan: derrick barry
Im not ready for this apocalypse 
That maruko. Dead
Yall sleeping on miss kennedy
S2 & 3 are GEMS. Watch it gurl seriously 

I‚Äôd like to see chichi & dela goes far. Dela deserves the crown

Id love to see morgan slay the game. And Kennedy to murder the lipsync again
Annoying twink who starts at season 7 and stan pearl to win
DEAD BY CUCU
üòÇ i know
All that i need is to see her slay the lipsyncs
Come on through season 2
TrixYa stan are the worst ijs
I said i felt
Lmao no shit Sherlock 
Im excited. And glad they got 2nd chance. But no offense, competition wise, i feel like this is a big downgrade from AS2.

Am i the only one? 
I get it. Im excited but, not so much

I hope i dont hurt any of queens fans but for me, state wise, and competition wise,  for me this cast is kinda weak. Dela is the only real competition here
Omg same even busier than joslyn
Yas gawdddddd i needd an HD PLEASSEEEE
I hope its gonna be all different from all the spilled spoilers. I tried hard to avoid spoilers but still its everywhere and im not always strong. I want a surprising winner actually. Sue me 

Omg you forgot her? She should take you to church

Category is...... off season

JK KIMORa
Idk but when i watch carmen/yara & dela/darienne, I thought its because the challenges. 

Yara&carmen challenge was about cheering the military. I just think they wont eliminate someone with that kind of challenge. I remember the michael jackson challenge of ANTM allstars. Kinda same

While dela&darriene, it was ru make up commercial right? I mean, i just think ru didnt want to eliminate anyone who put their effort to promote her product.

Plus the alyssa&roxxxy situation. If i were ru i wont eliminate anyone as well. It was my roast. I dont want to look butthurt or sthn

But then again its all just my random thoughts. I cant explain it better since my language limit.
Agree. Detox won  this one
I stop reading when you state that katya won read u wrote u.

Ofc theres that kind of possibility. But still, wanted J out of the group & literally decided go kick her out of the group are whole 2 different stories
Valentaja. Your filter is beautiful üåπ 

JK OMG JK
Come on fan favorite 

Oh wait
I think the left one just a bad picture. Not a bad make up

Maybe its just me
I cant wait for this gagerine we deserve 
Wow I personally think that Raja is the most charismatic out of all the winners. I repeat. Out of all the winners.
As if she‚Äôd get that far (2)
[all she has is her look? gurl](http://www.dragofficial.com/uploads/1/9/3/9/19395567/5137049_orig.gif) 
Funny but in my mind Jinkx will be first out. Not because i dont like her but somehow i just think no one else would (maybe Raja if she pull out kind of her nowadays drag)

And for violet i think she will end up on top 3 (five at least). Tyra definitely gonna be on top 5 for the sake of drama
This is my POV
Im gonna make it short. I disrespect J because she told public that she was KICKED OUT by the ot8, which she was in SM longest than anyone in the group, and she knows exactly that members could not kick other member just like that. She knows EXACTLY how it works. But she blamed the girls. Thats when I disrespect her so much. She put the burden to the girls. Tried to play victim

Plus with the rumor that she actually already wanted to go. Which all made sense  for me. She still blamed the girls. Gurl. No
Thats my favorite runner up
Its so shocking for me as someone who thought that TTS will still be here after snsd
Max
Gee.
I always like Girlgroup. Destiny‚Äôs Child, Pussycat Dolls, Danity Kane...

A close friend of mine told me that there‚Äôs this one girlgroup which has 9 members (that used to be so big, i mean, 9 members?)

I used to dislike asian music so i ignored him. But finally i watched the mv. It was cute. But the music I couldn‚Äôt get off of my head. The music on ‚Äòneomu banjjak (short stop) banjjak nuni busyeo‚Äô is SUPER CATCHY. Thats when i started to stan
I think they still try to figure it out of how to stay in the group without being in sm
Im devastated. I need help
BAM
Come on, pussycat dolls
Sigh


Off season 
Twinks nowadays....
Left one is my type of guy, but I could never ever get 
Valentina tbh. I was rooting for kimora & trinity at the mtq (trinity got lot of hate back then, my instinct always goes to support the underrated one)

Seeing valentina in cheerleading challenge changed everything. She rocketed to be one of my most favorite queen ever.

And to my most favorite queen after the reunion. 
Sorry raja but i had to pick manila
Val & Kim
Look queen like Max
There‚Äôs a high chance that youre gonna be attacked by katya‚Äôs fan

But i like the idea of detox/alyssa winning
Cynthia agreed to compete 2nd time
Not a popular opinion but yara gave better energy that alexis or raven (you can see a glimpse of her slaying it) but the edit focus too much on raven. With lazy sexy movement. I mean. It‚Äôs PCD! Thats the first clue that you need to DANCE

Sue me
Shea didnt prepare any tricks for finale lsfyl
Tati looks ..... good.

Anyway theyre my top queens (max is my most favorite ever) 
Dont worry gurl i started with 5 too and i dont regret it
Got my vote
Ooops i did it again by viviene & honey
Still don‚Äôt understand why the judges came for tatianna‚Äôs look. 

Maybe i just love her so much 
We‚Äôll see
I have big respect for them, because this season was reaaaally exhausting 
Re read it from the beginning 
#teamMonet
I read somewhere ru actually knows which lipstick that the top queens picked. So, if that was true, shes the one stirring everything 
As a fan who brought like 2-4 copy of every release, im proud 
Her whole drag race existence is underrated and under appreciated 
ART
Carmen & raja for my own pleasure 
Tati & alyssa (bcs phiphi said that wasnt that great)
Coco alyssa
Morgan sonique
Laganja joslyn
Any dida
Any coco
Sasha velour, winner. How??

JK MISS THANG
Why are you talking
Those oversensitive 14yo kids who started at season 7 
Queen yara should‚Äôve been in top 3 i agree.

But she decided to give  alexis mateo free pass.

Thats all for today‚Äôs T with Tati.

Thankyew

Disgusting i hope she‚Äôs okay 
How‚Äôs your head

Fashion forward. Just my taste. Best aesthetic of all time for me. In and out of drag 
Thats my prediction too but by the luck of Nuest, there‚Äôs huge chances that they can do the same, re-branding Afterschool. My hopes still fly bcs last year they post new year greeting. Idk did it mean anything. But still...
Kaeun is actually real good at everything (vocal, one of lead dancer & rap) at least based on my playboyz friend

And i just love eyoung so much
If i have my own agency im gonna do anything to have a contract with this girl
Pledis potentially put After School to join? I have mixed feelings about this.  But i do miss them. I hope kaeun + eyoung will participate. Theyre such waste talents.
Old but still made me cackle 
Tatianna‚Äôs at least it looks pretty

But I definitely need katya‚Äôs spray for my nina bonina negativity

I still think Trinity & Shea deserved it more and still forget Sasha is the reigning queen sometimes. I‚Äôd be like ‚Äòwho won s9? She- oh Sasha‚Äô  

I still think that if its not bcs charlie & val, the finale format wouldn‚Äôt be like that. I mean, i was 100% sure that they didnt want Sasha to win. Bcs if they did they should‚Äôve made her win several challenges like the ball and probably snatch game. So her win will seem more legit



but whatever it is what it is 
Omg why this got downvote? 

Who read this in tyra (banks) voice?
How about just face those morons and speak her mind like normal people do?

Omg we‚Äôre definitely definitely not talking about that kill yourself thing because i didnt, in my reply, saying anything like supporting Tyra 100%.
 
[Lemme sum it up sweetheart:  First you said something about healthy response thingy when the comment you replied didnt say anything about that And now you say something about me supporting tyra told kids to kill themselves   ](https://m.popkey.co/28ab87/kW9rd.gif) 
This is only for her character in TyPhi series
I thought Tyra has explained it there. Yes for us its just another snapchat post. But for her = tons of tag and post and messages saying that she didn‚Äôt deserve the title AGAIN like she keeps getting on these years. Sometimes its funny. But gurl we dont even know a half of what shes getting. 

And answering your question, yes. Its an healthy reaction bcs she told phiphi directly and face it herself instead of making shady post. 
Props to for picking gengar

I do think it's kinda fucked up how you guys are making a joke of it and saying shady things because this was my moment it isn't a joke to me this is real and this is my life and this is something I've waited since my entrance for and for you guys to be up here talking about how deathdrop belongs to Momma Ru,  that's not what's important, what's important is that I should‚Äôve been tagged and that's what we should have talked about, this is really special and I do feel hurt that you guys would take advantage of this moment for yourself.
Cmon girls We‚Äôre gonna do some exercise. 
Raise your hands to the air. And this is for you, one word 

Chill pill bitch.

Abernattine, you need one 
I personally think that it looks lame and tired. I mean, it is what it is. She is who she is. The problem is she keeps doing her thing, she‚Äôs not tyra sanchez. She wont feed the drama. She stays away, and wont involve if she doesnt have to. And focus on what she‚Äôs doing. Thats for me is way more classy. 

On the other hands, i really want to respect these queens. Esp Shea. She‚Äôs for me, hands down, one of the fiercest queen ever. But the way they keep talking things about someone who doesnt even care about you. Kinda seems like gangin up on her. And kinda feel like what Eureka said on Ru-nion was right. They seem like the new Detox clique for me.

Idk its just an opinion btw.

If you stop your argument at ‚Äòalso she won that title on her own‚Äô, I could have sent you my upvote
Im so torn. I always love tyra despite of all the hate towards her. She always manage to give us some good ass drama like this one. And i always have a special place for raja in my heart

THE WAY TYRA CALLED OUT RAJA LIKE THAT. [never thought one day this happen. ](https://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/2017/01/28/636211810865716993-1423727251_tumblr_og8l6ix7c41vaeumwo1_500.gif)

Yes by posting this i wanna state that its not that i dont love them. Bcs i have pretty much the same inner saboteurs too in me
S1 : i watched s1 and never had time to ru-watch it. Mostly bcs i cant stand the filter
S2 : Pandora. I agree that her runaway were tragic. I really love her the first time i watched s2 tho.
S3 : Carmen. She was pulling nothing but body. 
S4 : none 
S5 : detox. I reaaaaaallly love detox at first time watching but after ru watch it several times she didnt deliver anything special actually
S6 : definitely Milk. She almost did nothing to the show. Especially her runaway.
S7 : trixie. I mean. She was just floating by
S8 : thorgy. At the moment s8 aired I couldn't understand why she ended up win nothing at all. But now i see that she's not as strong as others in every challenges
S9 : maybe val but i still love that bish

Ps: omg yes adore for s6 too. Most times she did horrible she just jokin around so the judges got easy on her
Hey ya'll good evening. My name is Duffy Swan, im from Indonesia. It's somewhere in southeast asia, you probably know Bali, well thats part of out country. My drag name came from the fact that my real name is dafi, and kids used to call me duffy duck. I pick swan because i want to show them i grew become a beautiful swan. Only to hide the fact that im an ugly ostrich now. 

Last week i gave you snippets of how to live in indonesia. Well im gonna give you bigger vision tonight of why you should visit Indonesia at least once in your life. 
Well for you who addict of cleaning, living here in indonesia is ideal because we really like to clean. We clean our home everyday. We sweep and mop them twice a day. We really like clean and shining floor. So much that if sometimes you visit here and goin to malls, you probably gonna see some old lady took off their sandals before coming in.

The next thing that we're so clean is we clean our ass by water after we poo. We dont trust tissues. We clean our ass by our left hand. So be careful next time you shake hands with us. Ive warned ya. 

Oh and most toilet here doesn't have tissue. So if youre in case forget to bring tissue to the toilet here, enjoy the rest of your day going everywhere with your wet ass. Dont worry, youre not alone.

And we're really well mannered, especially the lady. You know, woman when they're on period theyre just gonna threw that used sanitary napkins. But not here in indonesia. We clean them first. By our hands. And then wrap it gracefully before throw them away. Thats just how classy we are. 

You know i really like to tell you lot lot more of my beloved country. But i suggest you to come here and experience yourself. Its gonna be the trip you wont forget. Good night everyone /waving my left hand to the crowd/

Manila because she seems fun
No
Well you could say they give aja the rudemption and ongina the tati arc while morgan could actually get both story line since she's from older season and arguably the first and original queen who went home too soon
I mean just continue with the rest of us who already applied the challenge 
Trixie. Aja. Ongina. Milk. Out of the list you can easily pick those queens to go early. Morgan is a fiercer queen for me who at least will make it half of the race. She aint back from dead to go home first
Im just giggling, michelle

Its hard for me to explain further because of the language barrier. They look great yet its frustrating because they could pull of tons of other look.

"A-yo stop! Lemme put it down another way"

Confession:
My name is Duffy Swan, and i came long way from Jakarta, Indonesia. My drag style is highly influenced by Korean Pop culture. Its a lil bit more fun, lil bit high fashion sometimes and lil bit of everything. My fear competing in this race is that they dont understand me because of the language barrier and different joke reference, but well /shrug/ thats their problem
Im curious how many queens have said yes?
Chad is normal.
Bianca. Idk but definitely not steel
Cynthia is ready than she ever been. 
This. Can anyone answer?

Belle?
Can anyone just tell what did she say
And jaemin. I 100% worry that SM announce his withdrawal anytime. I mean for a rookie idol its not normal to get such lobg long long hiatus. He's my no 1 NCT bias ;(
Sunny. She seems so unhappy and sad esp after Jessica's withdrawal. For me like ticking bomb and she can out anytime. I really want her to be her again. The energy pill of the group

You can hate her because of things but you can deny that bish is sickening and one of the fishiest fish ever walk through that door. Not fish. Her level is mermaid. Fishiest queen ever

Why should you, and not the other contestants be crowned America's next drag superstar?

I wanna win drag race because of something like this
Coco is the real lipsync assassin ijs
Lucky she has her asian friend to make her relevant 

Too far?
Omg pimp lady from the election
Twice
Nor derrick then
I thought shes dead
Yeay you've cracked the code
My theory (im sorry if its not Original but this is really came to my mind after watching the finale)

SEASON 9 finale wasn't supposed to be like what it is, because:
- Shea's obvious winner edit
- If they wanted to make Sasha as winner, i think they would let her win something else than just 2 shared winnings. I mean, then her winning will seem pretty legit
- they changed the format bcs charlie & Valentina.1 queen refused to lipsync is already bad. And then maskgate happened. I think the producers feel like they have to remind the viewers & future contestants that lipsync is the most important aspect of the show.

Im not teamshea (im teamtrinity) but i have to admit that shea was robbed as fcccccck. 

About the reunion 
- Aja's attack on Valentina was staged. It's obvious that they wanted to change the title of miss congeniality (maybe after seeing hateful comments towards val) but they dont want their hands to get dirty)

Thats only an opinion btw. Sue me

Edit typos
I mean, who will judge AS4 

You know, its gonna be years ahead, and Ru....

She played it right. Maybe she wasnt the most REAL queen ever walked through the door. But she did some nice things like being supportive towards queens like nina and farrah, and always avoided drama like she did to alexis and aja. I mean, she was pretty congenial back then on race, for haters to discredit her congeniality just because us messy fans or because shes fan favorite is not acceptable at least for me.

About not showing her true color, i mean she was in a competition ofc she needs to focus and play nice towards other queens. You can see she participated in lot of extra clips and thats enough of being socially active at least for me. And now she, for some other queens, has changed into someone that she wasnt, i mean thats human nature, she has less interest now, that she has eliminated. Then she moved on to another thing to focus. And i still dont see anything wrong with that. She aint saint but haters make her looks like daughter of lucifer or something just because she played the game she had to play. I think she  kind of reminds me of Bendela. Why haters complain so hard this time? Part of me agree that those queens are insecure of Val's popularity, and brought some weird obsession of them to val breaks the character. They maybe misunderstood thats not character thats just how she played the game

Okay you ask for my opinion then you got my pov

Coming from peppermint stan

Okay
I literally just clapping when she said being fan favorite means being the true winner. When its right its right tho. Some other alumni said the exact same thing
I think at some moments eureka and alexis supported her too. 
Thankyou for sharing your story
Thankyou so much i sent you message

Dat chest tho
She is amazing and sad to see she got one of the lowest percentage of Miss Congeniality.
Shoot 
SHOOT
I actually enjoy Bob's book ball, her finale lipsync and white dress, also from finale
Serena cha cha

The OG brain queen that is too smart that the show couldn't handle her. Her soft sculpture is legend
Trinity looks so gorgeous thanks
Category is: drag race fan re-doing violet chachki
Am i the only one who doesnt want Trinity to be on AS3? She needs to win this season. I highly think she'll be ginger minj on AS3. Shea will pull off chad for sure. But Trinty, idk. I really hope she wins this season. 
Finally first toot 
Girl. Im shocked too
Hello, it's me
Like your vajoyna

Haha sorry i just cant help
Btw

Dont forget the edit.
They could make Max looks like crazy attention whore

Maybe they can make the lipsync as just, well regular finale lipsync
Im sorry im just too shocked rightnow. The fact that shea & Trinity probably wont win........
Darienne lake had chance to beat bianca

Im done
If this happened on s4

America's next drag superstar is....

DIDA RITZ

Babe i lost my word.

I still want Trinity to win. Only give it up for Shea tho. 

The gagerine
No because I thought it gonna be 2 NY girls with Kimberly

But loooowwwwkey yes because she entered the werkroom 1st. For me anyone who came 1st into werkroom gonna make it far. Or at least producers thought they gonna make it far. 
All T no shade
The tightest top3 were S3 & S5. And probably AS3

And you will reply that roxxxy had no chance
Do you really have to repeat it in every comment? S5 top 3 were so tight. Tamar did you watch the show?
Dont underestimate s5 roxxxy just because you just watched her AS2 last night
OMG I WANT SCARLETT JO TO GUEST JUDGE AS3

Btw what a nice nice interview. [So you guys still think Ru wont crown Val just because the lipsync? ](https://68.media.tumblr.com/c2d3ae63cfe48849702330fa06b22823/tumblr_odj2x0XOtj1si3tc1o1_400.gif) 
Omg i feel you
She came for ru when anyone else couldnt
Its impossible. Just wear something simple and do some funny shit. 

Reminds me of alyssa (or roxxxy?) comment to jinkx in who wore it better mini challenge 
I feel so dumb that i dont get the joke
Rupual doesnt run shit on her side. RUPAUL does
Hi sichina cha cha
Raja's makeover look was a choice btw. I love raja. Except that raja
Google humor. How bout dat?
Fuck you alyssa

Thats my regular curse 
Whats up nerds
Why you let producer did what they did to max?
Only Tyra sanchez
Raja
[........ okay](https://media.giphy.com/media/8sC6URZeIbTMs/giphy.gif) 
No. Sorry. It's not because whoever i root this season. But looking back we got queens like chichi, detox, keneddy, or latrice royale, who are, for me, more deserving 

But it is what it is tho
LMAO get her jade
I barely can see anything tbh
Detox should've won that read u wrote u tho.
Choices

And people still voted that alaska 2 looks I couldn't believe it
Is that katya
- No leak
- Crown 3 of them so at least we wont know who's gonna win
- max
- manila luzon
Max
Shookt
Looks old. 
[finally](https://m.imgur.com/vdPLsrQ?r) 
We need someone to go home 1st
Im okay as long as its manila
This is hypnotizing 
Oh so it's another 'we hate Valentina' club day? Lets see how much we can hate Valentina today. 
OR 10yo valentina haters, who started at season 7, busy talking shits about valentina and her stans and busy proclaiming how congenial peppermint is, sometimes reminding how roxxxy o'hara cunt-ish Valentina was. They dont even know who are roxxxy and phiphi 
Nooo. Yes but no. Their deep voice. Their kind of awkwardness that i cant explain. Even lowkey their fashion sense. Sasha is like the upgraded level of princess
Duffy Swan

My name is duffy and kids used to call me duffy duck
Thats what im gonna say in top4 'what you gonna say to little dafi'
Okay i probably will be downvoted because of this. I just want you to know i mean no harm

But Sasha really reminds me of The Princess. With a liiiiil bit more brain, personality and humor 
Seems like someone busy downvoting anyone who put trinity on top. 
I say yes
That was shitty game. We deserve another game 
I love how people thought that Kimora would slay. I love her. I wish she lasted longer

1Trinity
2Shea
3Sasha
4Popper
Maskgate
Truth
No one outside valentina stan agree that she should win?

Oh okay sure because valentina was the monster of the season right?
Okay briar rose
[gowrl](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DBQdqyBUwAE-t6r?format=jpg) 
Written using period. Satanic
Aja's wonderful make up skill
Sasha is definitely 3rd for me but mainly because how clear i see the producers dont want her to win
I mean, iirc manila and alaska had better stats than jinkx or raja. Im pretty sure about raja tho. People here said it several times
Neck up looks good. 

Upper waist down looks good. I like how the dress fits her. 

But i dont like the tank top-ish top of the dress

Pardon my bad english
I mean, so did alaska. Or manila iirc

Yeah. Shea is winning, we all feel it like we felt to bob but Trinity sliiightly better chance than sasha. 
NOW THIS IS ART MAWMA
In other words. Tyra said chelsea's photo looks like Aja
Toot for your make up
Unpopular opinion. 
I want KimChi to win AS3
 Now you know who are the messy twinks ones. The haters or the stans?
For me, the last 3 seasons had the same patterns

Bob, Alaska, now Shea > consistently slaying - lip sync/meltdown/bottom - win

And that low moments weren't that legit either. At least for me. Like the producers only want us to see them, idk, the winner in low position? Weak side? Or to cover up the obvious winner edit?

Only my opinion btw. Sue me
I think im okay now if its her at the end. [but i'll be honest, i want Trinity to snatch the crown](http://www.pride.com/sites/www.pride.com/files/2016/10/14/289cf0a747534c348bc8062e940fe313.jpeg) 
Omg i feel bad for you. Only because you mentioned valentina
At this point i think its only between shea & trinity. So your mother just need to execute 1 
1 valentina. with lil bit of shea, sasha & charlie
2 alexis
3 idk for me none of them really stood out as comedy queen
4 eureka & trinity
5 cucu. 
Shea got winner edit
Trinity seems be liked by Ru
Sasha got 3rd placer edit. Like she's good, but they wont let her outshine the winner
I think its like s8 ep1. Crews actually have assigned them the look
She was. I never stan her but i admit she killed most challenges. But imo its clear that they dont want her to win. Because her edit is so faaaaar from winning edit. It even feels like they try to degrade her, make her less good as she supposed to be. 
Im trinity fan too but im super cool about her stats. Imho Sasha wont win this. If they want sasha to win, sasha would've won last challenge. So she will have more than just 2 shared winnings in her pocket. Clearly its gonna be between shea & trinity. Thats just my opinion tho. Sue me
Ikr me too
At this point imo Sasha wont win. 

If shes gonna win the judges will let her win this time so she'll have enough win in her pocket instead of just 2 shared winning. For me now shes just like pearl or naomi. Top 3 but wont win. 

I really think she deserves to win tonight, also shea actually but for me the only right formula is to give it to sasha. So they will look like equally strong. Its just my opinion btw. And im not even sasha stan. 
Yes. I agree
Btw I seriously think Kimora deserves more recognition. 
Valentina. And Kimora sometimes
Omg now she came for Bianca. Idk about you but this is new AS winner i think we really need rightnow lmao
I kind of think the winner and MC  voting are way different. Remember everytime Ru about to crown someone she said the decision is hers to made

Btw IMO if the queens got the right to decide, Valentina would still have big chance to win. She was really nice to other queens and maaaay be the queens will play it safe and just choose a fanfavorite. Thats just my opinion btw :)
[omg thats me! yes they hated me](https://68.media.tumblr.com/110263c63ddc7e4294ddea36563459e7/tumblr_onr7l3WfEp1w7jkrwo1_500.gif) 
They hate her fans. With a lil bit of hating the fact that fanfave will snatch the MC title (what if the fanfave actually deserves it?) And somehow they have illusions that Valentina is a fusion of phiphi o'hara and roxxxy andrews level kind of like villain
Everytime i reload the voting page, Aja's photo is the first one to show up. So. I kinda dont believe the loading theory. Unless someone could give any deeper explanation, i will enjoy the thought that Val is leading.

Sue me

(Somehow i kinda feel the sue me ending of a comment is like downvote repel. I love you nina)
Tbh yes im gonna be upset. I want Trinity because she brings something new to the winners circle. And i wont be mad if Shea snatched it. Because she deserves it. I dont say sasha doesnt. I just think the two are more deserving
Are you sure the haters are not the messy twinks ones? 
I feel so happy seeing val lead the vote. Sue me
I had to because its so silly
Hahaha who cares they can hate val as much as they want. Shes still makin money
YAS VAL

Edit: I hope its legit

Downvote me as much as you want. 
Wheres the blood i need sum climax
I wont be so curious if you wrote 'doesnt really deserve it' but you wrote really doesnt deserve it. 

Let me ask you a very fair question. What did valentina do so she really doesnt deserve it?
Haleloooo
[ikr :(](https://media.tenor.com/images/3bceec51f2b46c1385dc5cb74e7c7b3a/tenor.gif) 
Valentina. She was being nothing but calm at aja's meltdown and being so supportive towards other queens. I will get downvoted because of telling the truth
Ivy winters
Yes this is what im talking about.

Im sure that val haters are the ones who actually twinks
Yas ‚ù§Ô∏è 
[yea im this kind of fan](https://68.media.tumblr.com/755d32335b4a9d6908382ea6f4af65ec/tumblr_oofi4qTYGV1vah80go1_500.gif) 

Btw i dont think you drag her down because of that. But because you said nonsense. For me nonsense = bullshit. In this case = valentina is such cunt / least congenial of all. I really appreciate you for explaining above. I agree with that. For you, this girl could be more than others. Thats fair thought :) i just don't particularly agree with your 1st statement. And im sorry for taking it too serious. I really like her!
I upvoted you back henny ‚ù§Ô∏è 
Me too. Omg these people
Yes i totally agree with the way you argue, because for you pep could be more congenial. I just dont understand how people actually attack valentina, call her villaintina, said that shes not congenial AT ALL. Like you can be nice to someone like eureka or aja. EUREKA. I mean she constantly threw some shade and created some drama. I live for her, i just hate some double triple quarter standards here. We valentina stan could be annoying sometimes but dragging val down like this is pretty unfair and baseless 
Did we watch the same show? I mean, who is villaintina? You dont have to vote her but how can you say valentina as villain? 
E X A C T LY
I really dont understand just because Val is gonna win = she was cunt. I mean, tamar did you watch the show? Shes pretty congenial btw
Val. 
Me debating to completely stay away from next season spoiler but cant imagine spending even just one day in off season without checking shitposts 
Farrah & Charlie fussion were the best
A trident 
Detox is dat you
In serious note. I dont think people hate bob or shea. Some of us just dont maybe just want other queen to win. Or maybe just dont like how obvious their winning chances are
But trinty win s9. 
Art
This season is actually pretty bland. But idk i dont think it belongs to 'worst' category. And the casts are actually strong tho
Im with you. I mean. And she didnt win. And tbh dat naomi thing that tyra threw  wasnt even that shady. 
Exactly. Not a popular opinion but for me season 2 is one of the tightest season ever. If naomi was there, she wont even surpass sonique

I still love naomi btw.
Best response 
Whats the t?
I love drama and i love ms smalls. But i prefer her to stay away from this drama. She's too young for this. 
Come on syaria queen cant wait to see you werking hijab
Henny giving us ramadhan queen realness
Come on peeking nipnip
I never see Aja in such, in control expression like that.
I love dax. This sub doesnt. But i do.
Season 3 challenges were pretty exhausting too esp the sewings
And lil bit of pandora right?
Trixie isnt that strong, competition-wise
As for now, for me the frontrunners are Trixie, Chichi, Kimchi, and Valentina. And probably Nina Bo'nina Andre Charles Brown only if she can overcome her inner saboteur
The fans voted pennytration on s5 online voting contest
[who lowkey enjoy dis?](http://queerty-prodweb.s3.amazonaws.com/content/docs//2016/05/acid-betty-drag-race.gif) 
Max. Her aesthetic is my most favorite of all time.
Manila and Raja. My most favorite top 2 ever. 
Valentina. She's so interesting in term of attitude and i love her perfectionist side
Shade chi because shes so clumsy, yet shady. And her aesthetic is so genius
Ivy winters because shes probably the best seamstress in herstory of dragrace
Bianca del taco trio. Because obvious reason


Honorable mention detox, violet, tatianna, chichi devayne, carmen carerra, trinity taylor & kimora blac
ME TOO! Hahaha sorry then but really shes really fierce and i didnt expect that at all.  
I thought it was merch like doll or something. This is perfect even in HD zoom
IKR! Finally someone acknowledges her
Is that dax wearing red?
I cant explain my analysis due to my limited english. 

All i can say is reallllllyyy want Trinity to win, to represent the pageant queen in winners circle. Shea is fierce. But i love the idea of something new to the winner circle

But i know Shea is gonna win. Her edit for me, is verrrrry similar with Bob's
I didnt mean to say that she messed up. English isnt my first language so my explanation is so limited . What im about to say is there was something happened to each and every one of them, who people thought will slay from the ruveal.
Omg kenzie has such really interesting bone structure. Tyra banks probably will recruit her to her show
That's probably the best so far. But my problem with aja is, she once said that she's a fierce fierce fierce lipsyncer so the judges couldn't send her home. Idk maybe because of that, I expect more from her. And i didnt get that. Shes good. But just. 
Aja didnt nothing but okay. Shea did good but nina's energy was really lacking. Trinity did so well but charlie really dragged the show down. The lsfyl for me is not about one person doing great. Idk about you but i always consider both of the queens lipsync before naming it a great great lsfyl. But well thank you for reminding me how great trinity was 
After reading the last trivia i really think Trinity seems actually has chance to win. Shea got the winner edit i know. But, trinity is so fierce damn
Im sorry but the fact that alexis and peppermint still in the race kind of blows me. I didnt say that they don't deserve it. I just didnt expect it. I thought either eureka, aja, valentina, farrah or nina would be there. Well they kinda messed up so for me alexis and pepper just dida ritzing their place to be top 5. 
I cant remember any fierce (edit:) LSFYL this season, i dare to say.

Except for peppermint. But i cant watch cucu so, yea
Biological woman 
Look back with exact same expression 
Me too omg i feel sad. But then again congratulations once.
Oh i love this runaway theme
If i do drag i want to look like Max.

Her aesthetic is still the best. For me
I love trinity since her promo shoot tbh she looks sickening.


I dont like valentina's promo. She has no neck
Paris hilton - Nothing in this world
Amerie - one thing
Danity kane - bad girl/showstopper/one shot/striptease
Mariah carey - it's like that
Kelly clarkson - behind these hazel eyes/my life would suck without you
Nicole scherzinger - whatever you like
Destiny's child - bills bills bills/bootylicious/jumpinjumpin/ independent woman/survivor
Sugababes - push the button
Girlicious - like me!!!
Ashlee simpson - boyfriend/l.o.v.e

Basically all popular songs when i was highschool
Makes me wanna hug her and never let her go. Never let her go - Roxxxy Andrews
Where can i get skeleton legging like nina?
For me, after seeing tatianna, i want them to give another chance to not so popular yet fierce queen.

I agree that tyra sanchez probably needs to re-introduce herself on another season. 

And queens like max, kandy, april, tkb, jessica wild, ivy winters, joslyn fox. They popularity is probably mediocre and they deserve more recognition 

Not gonna happen i know
If it aint on bet i dont watch it
Rumor has it that detox is dead right after as2


Who we see now isnt detox. Its her talking trash can wearing detox's make up. Oh the trashcan also tweeted all those controversial tweets for sure
Trinity is my 2nd pick from the beginning. So im joining the tucking club now.


im cool if its shea tho
What about saintmora?

And anyway, good luck with that!

(Here comes the downvotes)

Ijk, ijk
Is dat magnolia on the back
Hhha why? I like the simplicity 
When she said violet has intention to be a little bit bitchy? But dats true. At least on early episodes 
True tho
Miss fame. Love her. Not her name

The princess. Esp when youre aesthetic is pretty far from princess

Madame laqueer. Esp when people just call her madame.


And i love hate kimchi. I freakkkking love her tho.

Ones of my most favorite names:
- Max
- Dax exclamationpoint (or just dax)
- Violet Chacki
- Naomi Smalls
- Detox
- Raja
- Tyra Sanchez
- Ivy Winters
- tatianna
- raven


And my most favorite are probably Laganja Estranja & Manila Luzon
Trinity: drag is versatile 
DAMN idk whether im stressed over work or this is really funny
Sasha belle
Some of them...
PMW. PS made wrong
WHATS UP NERDS?

MY NAME IS DAX EXCLAMATIONPOINTS AND IM THE QUEEN OF ALL NERDS
Good. I just want Trinity to win tho
Last statement im so agree. Thats why i want trinity to win. At least finally we have pageant representation 
Clock the flair. Nina = negativity 
STMW. Spoiler tag made wrong
Editing is obviously your passion
This
Nina is that you
Dammit :(
Why can we, valetina stan, just have our moment to feel grief and sad and angry? I mean, all of us do when out favorite sent packing. And i mean, it just happened. [why?](https://68.media.tumblr.com/17e07c3c8805cf5592cd6d4f243887d8/tumblr_ns23ltluAE1uym6sbo7_400.gif) 
I was thinking it. Jade said it
I hope Val learns something from this. And upgrade herself for Allstars 3
Your spoiler is the best thing
Omg this.
Where should i sign
Seriously tho im being super dramatic but this is the very first time i lost hope to the show. I mean, last time my fave at least made it to top 3 (toxie & kimberly)

Dobt blame me. Please just let us, val stan to grieve
MY ONLY LAST HOPE IS TRINITY NOW :(

but im okay if its shea 
Omg I thought about age
Wait i thought that theyre just dont have enough budget to use QueenB songs? 'wont let their music be used on the show' like really?
Cynthia lee fontaine's snatch game
But im gonna be honest the most iconic moment of the season is Aja's speech towards valentina.

[oh, and farrah](https://dfhfzl.tumblr.com/post/160757682312) 
"No, you're done because I'm gonna tell you why you're done"

Katya. 

More to her fans tho
I need this too
Citizen of The Baldtopia
Yes bcs she said before like she can kill lipsync and the judges cant send her home. And when she finally lipsync i was like, thats all you get?
Battle of the bald
Imo Because Raja is Raja. Shes FIERCE. Tbh her charisma is slightly higher than Manila. Despite the tight stats

In the other hand, probably Raven's charisma is pretty much bigger. I love tyra tho. She deserves her win 
Season 8

Wonky eyelash. Lisp. Big toes

You got me gal
Okay now i know the major spoiler looks like. I expect to see something but not in a semi(or it is) HD picture. Clear. No room for possibility. I will avoid this next time. My bad. Thanks for educating me. 

I feel bad for farrah but then again, one less queen to worry about
Omg and she was back to sleep after ru talked to her. Only tyra sanchez
As expected from my ivy
Wait where's vivienne? Lmao
