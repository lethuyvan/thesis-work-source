I've read upper 70s. I personally don't run single fan cards, so I'm not sure.
For those still buying, pretty decent deal. These things run *hot*, so beware. It's been quite a while since these cards were this cheap.
Same tactic my dude. This is the way to go.
Any GPUs I buy will mine other coins, not ETH.

Potential block reward decrease plus Casper incoming = bad time for buying new hardware dedicated to only ETH.
Hybrid Casper will be one PoW mined block for every 99 PoS blocks.
Okay but why link to the document showing that three addresses mined all the BTM?

Good find using the search! My memory is pretty bad, so I didn't recall that. My bad, I'll take the fault.

Anywaym as a follow up, OP said he was using ethOS (which I just caught via a re-read), and [according to the changelog](http://ethosdistro.com/changelog/) ethOS last updated to Claymore v9.6 with ethOS v1.2.3.

ethOS does support a command `update-miner claymore`, so it's possible that either a changelog doesn't note that a new version is used, or that OP updated, but the post is pretty limited.

Maybe he can chime back in?
This is essentially how Claymore works. Unfortunately loading the DAG is part of the dev fee process and isn't included in the "2%" advertised.

Might I recommend giving [Phoenix Miner](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2647654.0) a try?
Temporarily pinning this to the top of /r/EtherMining
What I found works best on the cool side is to open one flap of the tent and use a high-CFM box fan to blow air across the miners, and another standard box fan at the bottom of the tent to cycle air back to the top.

There are four exhaust vents that lead to three 440 CFM fans. [Here is a better visualization from the top](https://i.imgur.com/qRSuPYZ.png) to show how all exhaust vents are routed.

Good luck everyone! Nice contest guys.
We weren't approached for this particular contest, but in the past we have not allowed it if the contest required interaction outside of the Reddit platform (eg: subscribe to channel, fill out an ad-based survey, etc...)

Since the email field is optional, and there doesn't appear to be any motive outside of sef-promotion (plus a sweet ass prize), I dont see an issue with this.

Good luck to all, wish I could win this one!
Zipties will work best, just remember to pre-drill any holes to avoid insulation in your tent. That stuff will generate static electricity and stick to things.
No problem! I have close to neutral pressure judging by the tent's nature (not sunken in to indicate negative, and not puffed out due to positive). No official calculations until I figure out my final thermal needs.
Yes, the hot air needs to be removed for this to be effective.
Yes, but it wasn't efficient. Eventually ambient temperature just kept raising and it wasn't efficient enough to JUST pull hot air. Separating the exhausted air helped greatly.

This happened to me when I was about 12 or 13. I grew up around the ocean all of my childhood and should have known better, but I somehow got caught in a rip tide and couldn't get back out.

There were two dudes about halfway between me and the shore. After about five minutes of me fighting the ocean, I yelled out to them and thankfully they heard me and were able to swim towards me to pull me out of the current.

It's been about 15 years since that happened and I still think about how differently that could have ended up.

What controller should the K40 be used with in the setup?
Mind PMing or pointing us at a location where we can be resourceful and find it?
Tent temperature will vary depending on a lot of factors (tent height, number of cards, air flow and circulation, etc). In my 4x4x48, the temperature varies nearly 10^*F from top to bottom (since heat rises).

Just make sure your cards are a reasonable temperature (55-75^*C). The lower the temperature, the more efficient your setup is.
No. The S9 is an ASIC to hash SHA256 coins, Ethereum uses Ethash.

These are referred to 80-rated and 100-rated breakers.

* 80-rated can only handle 80-100% load for less than three hours.

* 100-rated can handle 100% load continuously.

Obviously, the latter costs quite a bit more for a reason. Check which you have, there may be some wasted space on your lines.

Stolen power
They were caught over stolen power, lol.

I count 10x clusters of miners. 60x on each shelf, 14 shelves to a cluster. That's 8,400 miners, and at $8.036M value (according to Russian site Ren TV), that puts it at about $1000 per miner. L3+ or 12TH/s S9 pricing territory.

* L3+: 4.23 TH/s (4.6 LTC/day, or $36k)
* S9: 100.8 PH/s (7.3 BTC/day, or $56k)

In short, these guys were making mad money.
>	1 By saying "could" , and quoting prices that don't exist you are living in the past, and in your words,"is incorrect." You are also leaving out the fact that Batch one was selling for $800. That means they can make these devices for probably <$500, and therefore will control the mining market in both product and mining. For the record, most of us also work in data centers and manage infrastructure.. -

How is it appropriate for me to be able to quote historic pricing, but you can bring up the Batch 1 launch price? Guess we can't agree here.

By the way, here's a one in stock for $229 on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/MSI-RX-580-ARMOR-4G/dp/B06XZZ93FQ

[Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/AeCjnPu.jpg)

A few community members, based on their work in the field, anticipate the E3 to cost around $600 to manufacture.

With three other ASIC manufacturers confirmed to exist for Ethash, according to Susquehanna Investment Group (who originally broke the Bitmain news), there are other options that may emerge, however this is likely not to occur before Casper assuming it doesn't hit significant delays.

And for the record, I specifically consult on large-scale data centers for mining.

>	2 I will concede that a RX580 can hit those specs, but the bottom price on newegg right now is $339. Still way more expensive than you are stating, and as people have said - a) Bitmain probably has more efficient miners already b) They can mine way cheaper than anyone else c) They were able to sell them for $800, proving that that are way cheaper and will eliminate competition.

Supply and demand. Buy in bulk, or find the right supplier and they can be had cheaper. Right now, you're waiting on new cards because prices drop because GPU manufacturers didn't pick up 10 months ago when they knew miners were buying up cards. Bitmain stepped in and took up the slack, and now we're unfortunately in this position.

* a) This is speculation. If a more efficient miner does exist, it's likely a few dozen percent more efficient at best. The availability and cost incentive does not exist for faster memory, which is what Ethash functions on (the speed of I/O, not the core clocks)

* b) Yes, because of economies of scale. This is true for most people who mined ETH early on and had the ability to continue mining at scale due to inflation

* c) We already know this. Bitmain posted [higher profits than Nvidia last year](https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-mining-co-bitmain-shows-higher-2017-profits-than-us-gpu-giant-nvidia-report-finds)

>	3 See my previous counter argument as to why Phil's claim that ASICS make the network more secure is just not valid.

Seems like we're going to be in a loop here, so I'll disregard.

>	4 I didn't say "profit" , I stated that a rig running 24 hours will today make .015 ether. Check it on etherscan.io yourself. Point being you need a lot of machines to make any money at all, and by doing nothing, you are giving Bitmain a huge advantage and control of ether by letting them sell, and mine faster and better than anyone else. See my previous post for more info.

Then mine. Economics play a huge part in who has control over a network. There's nothing stopping from Bitmain or any other large player from buying GPUs and doing the same thing. I guarantee you that people have already been researching FPGAs for more efficient mining and that was welcomed, but now that Bitmain jumped in, it's a problem. My point is not to defend Bitmain, but show that this is an advancement in profiteering.

This argument holds on the same principal that stakeholders not mining is the same as "doing nothing"

>	5 Thanks for your psychological analysis of my post, but if you had read this thread completely, you would see my previous post that concisely pointed out the flaws in each PDN listed. Yes, people that are enthusiasts are emotional about this because we see a replay of the Litecoin ASIC transition coming, and those were not good times.

I'm not going to address this.

>	6 You brush off centralization by saying it is a "moot point" ? Based on this, most of the crypto-community and I will never agree with you if you don't think decentralization is important and see no point in arguing with you anymore.

I called your argument about pricing moot, not centralization.
Any time. I know emotions are running high within the community right now, so any little bit counts.

I appreciate everything the core devs do for the project. It's a thankless job and it's important to hear a bit of praise every now and then.
I think that a lot of the main stakeholders (e.g.: non-miners) feel this way. I was reading through Hudson Jameson's thread in /r/ethereum earlier and this is pretty much the consensus there.
> PLEASE QUIT SAYING A 180MH/S RIG FOR $800-$1800 IS ON PAR WITH WHAT MINERS PAY.  The only way to make a rig this efficient and fast is through buying seven 1070's , a motherboard, processor, memory, PSU, and case. The base price for a GTX 1070 is $400 at the cheapest.

First, I disagree. I consult on large-scale mining and datacenter infrastructure builds on a regular basis and your statement is incorrect.

This same hashrate and power consumption can be achieved with six RX480s, which, prior to the increase in GPU cost, could be had for around $225-250. That's around $1,350-$1,500, two 650w PSUs are $150, Process + z270-P is $155, risers are $40 for a pack of six, memory is $50, and you can assemble it on a wire rack. Total cost = $1,805.

Second, the entire point of an ASIC and hardware maturity is to provide more efficient ways to secure the network. I understand the centralization argument, but this is a moot point.

> Now, since that rig, running 24 hours will make only .015 ether or ~$5, how many of these machines do you think people need to actually make money? At least 10 of them.

This is completely dependent on cost of electricity.

> Don't try to tell me cheaper RX 580's can do it either.

Yes, they can. With a proper overclock and undervolt, they can place on-par with performance per watt of the E3.

> Please quite talking about mining when you really don't understand what it takes to make it. Everyday regular miners built the ethereum network, and will walk away from it and let you guys and Bitmain have a beautiful relationship together.

I'm simply stating factual information, I did not take a side on the matter. Your post is full of emotions seeking validation, and I understand why you are upset, but an ad hominem fallacy isn't helping.

----

Lastly, again, I stress that if the developers choose to hard fork, it's important for the developers to make a single stable fork that resolves the issue. This means waiting until the unit reaches someone who can provide insight on how it works and confirm if the intended fix will in fact do what is intended. Don't rush a potentially disruptive release if it may have no effect, or its effect could be nullified with an update.
Cost analysis show that the E3s, assuming they're using DDR3, are closer to $600 for Bitmain to build.

I am fully aware that Bitmain is believed to mine with their equipment. That's pretty much the general belief across the board. I'm not okay with their practices, but that doesn't change the other points.
Mod from /r/EtherMining here.

Sorry for the wall of text here, but figured I'd throw in my two cents (this is also the closest I've come to hitting Reddit's 10,000 character limit!)

----

I feel that ASICs are a form of Proof of Work maturity in the sense that the currency has grown enough where economies of scale forced the production of more efficient ways to mine. If a miner is only turning a $20 per month per machine profit after electricity costs, the time to break-even on an investment is much higher than if a more efficient solution were introduced. Ultimately, the goal of mining is seigniorage.

ASICs should not be viewed as a formidable commodity, rather, they should be seen as a tool. Tools are never intrinsically good or bad, some crypto developers even intend for their coin to eventually be used with an ASIC. Some coins, such as Sia, were designed to specifically work with an ASIC developed in part by the founding development team.

Switching gears to talk about ASICs and Ethereum for a moment.

Bitmain announced the E3 at a price of $800 per unit ($1,150 after power supply and shipping); a fraction of the cost of a GPU rig running the same speed, this meant that the barrier for entry was significantly lowered. At the new price of $1,800 per unit ($2,150 after power supply and shipping), this aligns the E3 with the price of a 180 MH/s mining rig. Since the hashrate and power are nearly the same, **IMO price point alone doesn’t give the E3 a significant enough advantage to warrant a hard fork**, disregarding the possibility that a more powerful ASIC is being built to operate on the Ethereum mainnet.

The Ethash algorithm is notoriously memory hungry because it's tied to the amount of I/O events that can occur. The higher the number, the better the hashrate. A few community members speculate that the E3 has a large quantity of DDR3 modules on-board, if a more powerful ASIC exists, it would need to have more expensive modern memory, it's likely going to be a minuscule gain over the E3, not five or ten or twenty times the hashing power like some people are expecting.  It is unlikely that Bitmain will sink additional time and capital into the development of a faster Ethash ASIC to sell so close to the potential release of Casper, especially with the current hardware limitations and threat of their current technology being stymied.

----

The community is very much divided on the topic of ASICs, so this makes it a touchy subject and difficult to remain neutral on.

Some members are very passionate about the integrity of the network and potential of centralization. This feeling comes from the thought that If Bitmain is developing these ASICs, there is nothing to keep them from operating their own datacenter full of E3s. However, as confirmed by CNN, research firm Susquehanna confirmed that there were at least three other companies working on ASICs in “[various stages of development](https://www.ccn.com/bitmain-has-developed-an-ethereum-asic-miner-wall-street-analyst-claims/)”.

Other miners are concerned primarily about their falling profits. As we all know, it has always been a gual to transition token distribution PoW to PoS, making it unmineable. Until then, every coin counts. If the barrier of entry (cost) is removed by the introduction of a lower priced, more readily available miner, profits are threatened. Because the ASIC may have the potential to be bricked via a hard fork, miners that are more concerned over profit are cheering on said hard fork, looking at their best interest rather than increasing the global speed of the network. Some of these individuals have filled the mining subreddits with FUD, including manipulated photos and unverifiable claims of Bitmain's involvement with well-known websites/organizations.

During the latest crypto-boom, people were spending upwards of $4,500 (whereas MSRP pricing would have actually been closer to $1,900) on mining rigs with equivalent hashing power to the E3. Many people who bought into mining at this time were unlikely to make a profit with Ethereum. After raising the price to $1,800 per unit ($2,150 after accessories and shipping), it is unlikely for those that buy the E3 at current pricing to break-even by the launch of Casper, assuming it is launched by Q1 2019.

ETH's “three pool centralization” was at 60% with GPUs alone, something that the whitepaper specifically called out as being problematic with Bitcoin at 50%, including ASICs. Point being – centralization is not necessarily a problem caused solely by ASICs, but rather caused by economy of scale. As larger mining operations grow, even with GPUs, they can afford more hashing power much more quickly than the average in-home miner. As with any financially stimulating venture, mining is not excluded from profiteering. I have worked with clients who have warehouses full of GPUs; the centralization problem exists without the need for ASICs, I promise. It's just now coming to light because of Bitmain.

----

I don’t believe that the Ethereum foundation or the core developers have mistreated the mining community at all. In fact, I believe that the course of actions currently being taken are levelheaded and emotions from the community are just running very high.

At this time, the developers have chosen not to emergency hard fork. Understand that this does not indicate that a hard fork will not take place in the future or as a part of a larger update.

During the April core dev meeting, the team clearly stated that they weren't yet sure how the ASICs operated, specifically said that they weren't sure if they could be "programmed", implying they may believe that it's an FPGA attached to a number of memory modules. If the ASICs could be updated to be unbricked, then the fork would have been for nothing and the problem returns. Given that Bitmain has never done this, it is highly unlikely to play out that way, however forking the second largest cryptocurrency (by market cap) over a theory is potentially disruptive.

A hard fork would require development resources to be removed from the development and launch of Casper re-focused on finding a suitable method to brick ASICs (at least one community member has been independently working on this) and perform a potentially disruptive event on mainnet.

Lastly, we need to address the falsification that Ethereum is “ASIC-Proof” or even technologically “ASIC-Resistant.” Hudson touched on this in the OP, but still reiterating it here.

Ethereum never promised that it would be ASIC-proof, merely that it would provide an economic incentive to be resistant to the development of an ASIC. I would like to produce a quote from the [Ethereum Wiki](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Problems):

> “Ultimately, perfect ASIC resistance is impossible; there are always portions of circuits that are going to be unused by any specific algorithm and that can be trimmed to cut costs in a specialized device. However, what we are looking for is not perfect ASIC resistance but rather economic ASIC resistance.”

> “The problem is that measuring an economy in a secure way is a difficult problem. The most obvious metric that the system has access to is mining difficulty, but mining difficulty also goes up with Moore's law and in the short term with ASIC development, and there is no known way to estimate the impact of Moore's law alone and so the currency cannot know if its difficulty increased by 10x due to better hardware, a larger user volume or a combination of both. Other metrics, such as transaction count, are potentially gameable by entities that want the supply to change in a particular direction (generally, holders want a lower supply, miners want a higher supply).”

This is solidified by revisiting the whitepaper, specifically the section which identifies how ASICs will be economically stymied:

“This model is untested, and there may be difficulties along the way in avoiding certain clever optimizations when using contract execution as a mining algorithm. However, one notably interesting feature of this algorithm is that it allows anyone to "poison the well", by introducing a large number of contracts into the blockchain specifically designed to stymie certain ASICs. The economic incentives exist for ASIC manufacturers to use such a trick to attack each other. Thus, the solution that we are developing is ultimately an adaptive economic human solution rather than purely a technical one.”

So with the Ethereum team providing only an economic reason to not develop an ASIC since the beginning, there has been no falsification or wrongdoing in my eyes.

----

One of the core values of the ETH is that block rewards are to be distributed amongst miners in an egalitarian fashion; ultimately, this will be solved by Casper and the switch to PoS. We should also bring to light that PoW mining was always meant to become obsolete with the introduction of PoS on the Ethereum network.

Mining was always doomed from the start; it is just a ticking difficulty bomb waiting to explode.

Last December, it was estimated that the network could process somewhere around 10-20 transactions per second. As more ERC20 tokens are launched, the network becomes more congested and requires even more hashing power to efficiently (see the Crypto Kitties movement to understand just how disruptive network congestion can be). The Casper update seeks to speed up block times and enables network-wide sharding to reduce latency. **IMO, this is what we need to be focusing on; a stable, tested release of Casper**, not a losing battle against ASICs.

> the devs are totally ignoring the community by not giving us valid consideration.

I disagree. The devs stated that they weren't yet sure how the ASICs operated, specifically said that they weren't sure if they could be "programmed" (implying they may believe that it's an FPGA attached to a number of memory modules). Given that Bitmain has never done this, it is highly unlikely to play out that way, however forking the second largest cryptocurrency (by market cap) over a theory is potentially disruptive.

> What other avenues can we explore to continue to make ourselves visible? It's critical that this doesn't get sweeped up under the rug.

Carbon vote, raise issues in Github, etc. The devs referenced Reddit as an outlet, so I'm sure they're aware of this thread by now. I don't believe that the devs are sweeping this under the rug at all, seems more like an approach to wait and see before jumping and making the wrong move.

> You say that you are fine with civil discussion, but consider by not allowing any discussion there is no longer a space for any civil discourse. I can't be responsible for the bad actors here posting FUD/Fakes, but is it really worth shutting down the whole topic due to a handful of bad actors?

I believe that this thread is a fine place for a topic on the matter. In no way am I shutting down meaningful discussion. In any thread I remove, the OP is directed to this thread as an outlet to post their discussion. If I scroll through it, I can see copy/pastes of threads that I've deleted, so people are doing just that.

Since the ASIC was announced, I've taken nearly 150 actions against threads posting fake information, spam, users attacking each other, etc. When the threads get broken out, the moderation of the sub become more complex, and given the heated emotions, more likely to result in intervention.

I spend a great deal of time diverting from my personal life to check on this sub while I'm at home spending time with my family, taking a break at work, going to the gym, laying in bed, waking up in the middle of the night, etc. You guys don't see the bulk of what comes through meant to do nothing but incite fear or insult other people.

I appreciate that you can respect it, and I hope that this explanation can help to give insight on why it was made.
I ended up getting a K40 based on this recommendation, thank you! It was $350, so enough to play with and see if it's something I want to scale up with later on.

That's exactly what's happening and Is why this thread exists.

I'm fine with a civil approach to getting the developers' attention, but the moderation impact has been far too great. Photoshopped pictures, name calling, general FUD to get a point across - it's not the right way.

I'm positive this will end up at a carbon vote to get a hard point across, but my guess is that developers will wait to fork until they can get concrete evidence of how the ASIC operates.
Nice! Happy mining!
That definitely seems a lot more reasonable. Huge price drops occurred across the board today too.
I'm guessing that network difficulty and coin price is forcing their hand with this one. I do expect a hardware refresh soon, but this drop seems more economical to me.
Understood.

I still feel like the article initially referenced is highly unlikely. Current production is believed to be less than 50,000 units per month since January, which would lead to a 600,000 unit per year production if continued at scale.
I think you're referring to [this post](https://steemit.com/technology/@cloh76/bitmain-to-release-ethereum-asic-miner-the-antminer-f3), but the "leaked board layout" is just an obsolete script miner blade.
No, it was Susquehanna International Group. They openly named themselves when revealing this data.
This is the first time I've read something like this and no research firm is mentioned. The attribution to "industry sources" doesn't add credibility at all.
> The mass shipments of the ASIC miner are planned for the fourth quarter of 2018

Yeah, there's no way. Availability aside, and even if a hard fork is not pushed, batch 2 will be unprofitable by the time Casper launches.
A lot of serious accusations in that /r/ethOSdistro thread.
> They just fail to notice how important is this to the community imho.

I think that the developers appreciate that emotions are running high right now and that it isn't a good time to make rush decisions. As I [noted elsewhere in the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/8auy55/regarding_threads_on_bitmain_and_asic_resistance/dx56s8h/), the developers really don't know how the ASIC works with 100% certainty. The smart move would be waiting until the units reach someone who has the technical knowledge to dissect one and provide insight about how it works.

We have a few guys that are on the board who work on an engineering level with high bandwidth memory that have provide (probably accurate) speculative information on how it functions, but if for whatever reason they're proven wrong, multiple hardforks to solve one repeat problem could be damning for Ethereum.

> the "new" (probably not really new) ASIC is only like 2.5 times better so, again no big deal.

2.5 times more cost effective, not 2.5 times better.
I personally feel that this is one major reason not to hard fork until the miners are in the hands of someone who can provide non-speculative insight on its functionality.

If it is decided to hardfork over the ASICs and they end up being bricked, then the intent is complete.

But what if it doesn't solve the problem? Or, what if they are programmable and it's brought back to life? if another hardfork is needed, the disruption is even greater and for something that could have been avoided with a small wait. That absolutely would not look good.
This is the same tactic that I actually use with GPU mining. Sometimes you strike gold.

I bet the wifi connection is actually prompting you to install an SSL certificate for filtering decryption. But yes, test and report back.
Depends what's on the other side.

* Is there a captive portal?
* Is there a NAC server that can identify the Bitmain equipment by MAC and is blocking it?
* etc...

What happens when you plug in a wired device like a laptop/desktop?
Not bad, but you're gonna get slammed for simplification. Miners want to be able to have detailed information about profits, not just number.

* For hash rate, you may want to consider giving the option to choose a card and quantity, letting it pre-fill this field.
* Make the algorithm selectable, then pre-populate table based on which coins use it, and profits based on the input hashrate
* Add calculations for electricity (wattage, pre-selectable based on card)

Not sure where you're pulling the live data from, but just want to say that I'd advise against using WhatToMine's API, as it's not typically regarded as the most accurate.

Other than that - it looks good! Nice and smooth UI, great job.

> The biggest long term threat from Bitmain is their Sophon which is actually essentially a GPU - which I don’t believe can or should be tech technically stopped

I saw that come across this morning in a Tweet from them, but I haven't gotten to look at it. I'll take a peek; depending on how ridiculous that is, it could open doors for bitmain into the autonomy market (Baidu, perhaps?)

> The ETH dev team didn’t say No anti-ASIC fork or measures. They said no emergency hard fork based on speculation made sense at this time, because of E3 specs and limits on next gen capabilities weighted against the risks of a hardfork splitting the network. They have indicated they remain open to putting an Anti ASIC change in a normally scheduled release.

I think this is important to remember, because the devs gave several outlets. I agree that it might be counter-productive to fork anything before the inner-workings of the E3 are known, so holding off for a planned major release, assuming nothing else comes along, may very well be the best option at this point.

> If the community really wants to push for a fork, someone needs to setup either a CarbonVote(which I hate), or perhaps a modified CarbonVote with one vote per address based on having a balance at least 30 days old. That’s the true way to get concensus it see the breakdown of opinions. If not a carbon vote then some other large exposure poll, but a carbon vote would be taken more seriously.

Yep, this will likely need to be the way things go. I think it was Jamesen who proposed this on the dev call, but didn't bring up the stipulations as mentioned. To avoid economics of scale playing a part in vote-swinging, the methods you mentioned (balance age, 1 vote per wallet, etc) could definitely help. There was already a favorable Twitter poll that may have not gained enough attention.

> If the community bands together and demonstrates a strong vote in favor of a an ASIC disabling fork, with the purpose being to either push the dev team or begin a user initiated hardfork, i am more than happy to provide the patches I have for the major EVMs and open sources miners supporting such a fork. I believe the community has the right to choose action, but if they can’t even band together to initiate a formal vote I would hardly call that concensus.

I think that there are a lot of emotions at play and stakeholders need to understand exactly that the potential reprocussions of a hard fork might be. I'm not against it, so I think that this is a good measure to investigate, but education will be key in making a smart decision by the community.

Once emotions die down, I have no problem with this. But until then, it is becoming cumbersome babysitting each thread to watch out for personal attacks and misrepresentation from both sides of the argument.

Sharing opinions is great and it helps to better the community. Calling one another names and Photoshoping photos to create scare tactics are not.

So again, just to be clear, this change is not permanent.

WhatToMine hasn't updated to reflect the difficulty change I believe. XMR will be most profitable until people catch wind.
Wherever you can find them. Amazon, Newegg, Micro Center, etc...
I was letting it go that way at first, but it's gotten out of hand. You're not seeing all of the posts and threads I've deleted, but the toxicity of the community are pitting members against each other.

I get that people are hurt, and I can appreciate what this has made a lot of people feel towards the project. The devs need are aware, I think they want it up to a carbon vote by the sounds of the last talk. A "put your money where your mouth is" approach. But centralization may win there are a higher stakeholder.

All good points, thanks for making them.
I don't disagree that it has put a lot of people in a predicament that wasn't expected. But it does explain the more than doubling of the network hashrate since December.

But don't take this thread as me taking sides, simply trying to deescalate the emotions running wild from everyone right now.
I'm not sure why I wrote thatin hindsight. Long day and 15 hours of driving will do that.


I suppose I mean that the devs encouraged carbon voting, which is irrelevant here.

To clear things up, anybody can fork it themselves into an independent project if desired.
He didn't have to CGI anything. It's basic HTML markdown that you change in the Antminer's /www/pages/cgi-bin/ directory.

I could replicate it if you really care that much.

Furthermore, I'm sure the next generation won't be called the E3 lol
Sure is:

https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#mining-centralization
It's possible that the increase is just a farce to further delay a hard fork. But at this point, everything is just a guessing game. The second batch will not be profitable, IMO.
This is a great post, thanks!

> I would propose to consider ASIC resistance a property of a proof-of-work, and not a property of a coin.

I disagree with this notion, because this would cause a ASICs to be viewed as a formidable commodity, when they should rather be viewed as a tool. Tools are never inherently good or bad, but how they are used can be, and some developers intend for the coin to eventually be used with an ASIC.

Therefore, I would like to revise this proposal to break out different PoW conditions which a coin may fit:

* **PoW-I**: Coin is intended to be used with an ASIC, or one is expected by the developer and no action will be taken.
 * *Example*: Sia (SC), Dash ([Yes, they did expect it](https://github.com/dashpay/dash/wiki/Whitepaper)), or any *new* SHA-256/Scrypt coin.
* **PoW-R**: Coin is considered to be ASIC resistant, meaning that the algorithm is developed in a way which hardens the method of PoW so that it is difficult to develop an ASIC. If the algorithm is compromised, it is **not required** for the developers to modify the coin or algorithm.
 * Example: Litecoin, Ethereum
* **PoW-P**: Coin is considered to be ASIC proof, meaning that if an ASIC is developed to mine the coin's algorithm, **developers pledge** to come up with a black to brick the devices.
 * *Example*: Monero

> An ASIC miner for ethash still needs to use memory chips and can do no better than to max out their bandwidth.

Also accurate. A few people have speculated that the E3 is a bunch of chained DDR3 modules, given the price of DDR4 and Bitmain's expected profit margins (and Ethereum's "poisoning the well" form of ASIC resistance), it likely was not economically feasible to make the unit more expensive. After the dev meeting confirmed that no action was planned, Bitmain raised the price of the E3 more than 125%.

----

Furthermore, I think it's important to note that Ethereum never promised that it would be ASIC proof. I'd like to produce a quote from the Ethereum Wiki, [found here](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Problems).

> Ultimately, perfect ASIC resistance is impossible; there are always portions of circuits that are going to be unused by any specific algorithm and that can be trimmed to cut costs in a specialized device. However, what we are looking for is not perfect ASIC resistance but rather economic ASIC resistance.

...

> The problem is that measuring an economy in a secure way is a difficult problem. The most obvious metric that the system has access to is mining difficulty, but mining difficulty also goes up with Moore's law and in the short term with ASIC development, and there is no known way to estimate the impact of Moore's law alone and so the currency cannot know if its difficulty increased by 10x due to better hardware, a larger user volume or a combination of both. Other metrics, such as transaction count, are potentially gameable by entities that want the supply to change in a particular direction (generally, holders want a lower supply, miners want a higher supply).

This is solidified by [revisiting the whitepaper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper), specifically the section which identifies how ASICs will be economically stymied:

This model is untested, and there may be difficulties along the way in avoiding certain clever optimizations when using contract execution as a mining algorithm. However, one notably interesting feature of this algorithm is that it allows anyone to "poison the well", by introducing a large number of contracts into the blockchain specifically designed to stymie certain ASICs. The economic incentives exist for ASIC manufacturers to use such a trick to attack each other. Thus, the solution that we are developing is ultimately an adaptive economic human solution rather than purely a technical one.
I see no credibility here other than scare tactics.

Locking thread
Not only the vocals, but Mess killed his character in the video will showing off his quirky attitude. Bravo guys.
I'm not disagreeing, but this is a common misconception. The white paper never uses those words, though it's implied.

Read this comment where it's broken down: https://reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/8abad8/_/dwxbnhk/?context=1
No worries. I agree, that's exactly that's next.
No, I quoted another user's post ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/8aa64j/eth_core_devs_have_decided_not_to_emergency_hard/dwx04y5/)).

In reference to waiting to brick ASICs in a later hard fork, one of the devs (Piper) said "That also probably lets us know that we're breaking something instead of just probabilistically breaking it at that point"
Yes. The dev team clearly stated that they weren't sure how the ASICs operated (specifically said that they weren't sure if they could be "programmed", implying they may believe that it's an FPGA). Forking a large coin over a theory is dangerous.
This is exactly why.
Sure, and I agree with this. But I think that the community as a whole at this point is in a peer-pressure based frenzy because they were told to be irate over it. I say this because many people are claiming that the [whitepaper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) has explicit callings for Ethereum to be ASIC-proof or ASIC-resistant, when in reality, it has neither.

A lot of people mining simply care about the bottom-line: dollars and cents. The network is an afterthought and I've gotten [a lot of flack for the line in the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/wiki/intro/shouldimine): "Do you consider cryptocurrency as more than just a tool to make money?"

As Vitalik mentioned today, it's difficult to predict a 51% attack until it's already happening, and the current state of the ASICs, according to the dev team, does not warrant a hard fork. We can *assume* that Bitmain has better hardware, but without concrete proof, large voices can call "overreach" on the devs. **I think that's what they are trying to avoid**; you don't just hard fork the third largest cryptocurrency on a hunch.

Here's a brief synopsis of ASICs in the whitepaper (I've posted this before):

> First, the mining ecosystem has come to be dominated by ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), computer chips designed for, and therefore thousands of times more efficient at, the specific task of Bitcoin mining. This means that Bitcoin mining is no longer a highly decentralized and egalitarian pursuit, **requiring millions of dollars of capital to effectively participate in**.

Just taking a pause here to mention that the Bitmain ASIC is roughly 70-80% cheaper than current market prices for an equivalent GPU rig, or 45% cheaper at MSRP pricing.

> Second, most Bitcoin miners do not actually perform block validation locally; instead, they rely on a centralized mining pool to provide the block headers. This problem is arguably worse: as of the time of this writing, the top three mining pools indirectly control roughly 50% of processing power in the Bitcoin network, although this is mitigated by the fact that miners can switch to other mining pools if a pool or coalition attempts a 51% attack.

Also pausing here to mention that Ethereum is in this state already. Ethermine controls ~28% of the network hashrate, F2pool has ~17%, and SparkPool has ~15%. Arguably, the Ethereum network is in a more sensitive state. [Stats available here](https://etherscan.io/stat/miner?range=7&blocktype=blocks)

> The current intent at Ethereum is to use a mining algorithm where miners are required to fetch random data from the state, compute some randomly selected transactions from the last N blocks in the blockchain, and return the hash of the result. This has two important benefits. First, Ethereum contracts can include any kind of computation, so an Ethereum ASIC would essentially be an ASIC for general computation

Moving lots of memory quickly; e.g.: GPUs

> - ie. a better CPU. Second, mining requires access to the entire blockchain, forcing miners to store the entire blockchain and at least be capable of verifying every transaction. This removes the need for centralized mining pools; although mining pools can still serve the legitimate role of evening out the randomness of reward distribution, this function can be served equally well by peer-to-peer pools with no central control.

We're using pools anyway because solo mining isn't achievable at an affordable entry point anymore

> This model is untested, and there may be difficulties along the way in avoiding certain clever optimizations when using contract execution as a mining algorithm.

I'm curious why we even considered hard forking if "poisoning the well" was originally designed to thwart the ASICs.

Please condense to original thread [found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/8aa64j/eth_core_devs_have_decided_not_to_emergency_hard/)
My understanding from the brief (distracted) overview is that they won't be proposing a fork before Casper unless they fear the reality of a 51% attack that cannot be mitigated by other means.

The ASIC details that have been released are not significant enough to be disruptive and by the time they would know that something worse existed (government-developed ASIC or centralization), it would have already be on the network and action can then be considered through "emergency" means.

Take my word with a grain of salt and go by the [**official EIP**](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/958) that is to be updated later today.
Casper test net is expected to be functional by August
According to the [**meeting agenda**](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/36), it is planned for [**EIP 958**](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/958) to be addressed.

* Edit 1: 10:55am EST - Core ETH devs have decided to not do anything in response to the ASICs.
I really believe that popular YouTubers made the community have this attitude by criticizing miners and gamers buying into the idea.

Then Nvidia played typical shill and blamed miners for card shortages, not themselves for deciding not to increase manufacturing for over 9 months.

The bias is stupid and I just shrug it off, but I never hear the end of it at work about how "miners are the problem"
A lot. I recently ran into a school that had a > 20% infection rate of XMR miners on one to one devices.
> approximately 1.3 million devices to be made and sold.

Curious where this number came from. More likely is 50,000 - 100,000 units. With S-curve taken into account, scaling to 1.3 million units would take well over a year.
Have you [read the whitepaper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper)? ASICs are mentioned only five times, and it never once says that the coin is "ASIC Proof", but implies that there are incentives for it to be resistant.

Here's a brief synopsis:

> First, the mining ecosystem has come to be dominated by ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), computer chips designed for, and therefore thousands of times more efficient at, the specific task of Bitcoin mining.

Network engineer here. What you're looking to do is set up a split tunnel IPSEC VPN.

A full tunnel will route all traffic back to a central location whereas a split tunnel will only route certain subnets back and dump the rest of the traffic out to the internet. This is important to avoid stale shares.

There are a lot of hardware and software VPN solutions, depends on how reliable you want it to be, and how much you want to spend.

2AM EST on Friday for anybody ~~wandering~~ wondering
A lot of people have tried similar approaches but when people found out they were not transparent about a dev fee, all hell broke loose. If I have one word of advice: Don't call it "free" if there is a dev fee, the community will eat you.

That being said, I think Awesome Miner needs some competiton! I have a lot of clients that use AM, but don't like the entire featureset and self-hosted concept (yes, they have the "cloud" function now). If you improved on that, I believe you could market a good paid service.

Good luck!
Easiest answer and is correct.

For most people, a smart switch is fine, but those with quite a few miners and large capacity circuits, PDUs are the way to go.
Even at $30 those are a good price. Direct from APC, those probably retailed for close to $1200/ea when they were new.
I made a video on this a while ago, using a screensaver to force mining. [Check it out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xu93LBVJ6k).
This is an $800 all-in-one solution, which is why it is financially attractive to many miners.

With a traditional miner, you need to purchase everything to build a PC, plus power, plus risers, plus GPUs. A rig will run about $4,000 for the same hashrate as the ASIC.
Please repost with more details, such as an output of your error. Further posts with little detail will be deleted.
Chances are, if they were mining ETH ahead of time, they converted to BCH before yesterday's pump (coincidence that they only take USD wire and BCH? I think not.) It would be silly for them not to, [especially given the 3% flash in market price](https://i.imgur.com/FsCMuK8.png) as soon as the E3 was announced.

But if you're asking "did Bitmain mining ETH cause it to crash?" Absolutely not. The market as a whole is down, and that includes ETH.
Is your OC unstable?
These ASICs are equivalent to about 6x GPUs. To put this into perspective, an L3+ ASIC for litecoin is around 22x Nvidia 1060s.

I personally feel that this is a low cost solution to continue decentralize by offering a minimum price of entry for Ethereum mining before PoS; there's not much centralization (big players mining the majority amount) occurring with a limit of one unit per customer.

PoS will prevent all future Ethereum mining after it exits hybrid stages.

Nothing will happen to the Ether mined by the ASICs, but they will likely not be able to continue mining unless they're just designed to be fast-access to memory modules. Hard forking may do nothing, depending on how these work.
/r/TheHackerMan
It can't. That's why this is Ethash only
They might be piloting something, but I'm fairly confident that they would have put them out for sale. Bitmain knows that Ethereum's PoW days are numbered, so why would they not try to capitalize with a more expensive product?
I bought one, but I recognize that it's at a risk. Originally I wasn't going to, but it's not like I'm buying a bunch of S9s when hardware is going to refresh soon, so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Here's why I didn't want to:

Current pricing and difficulty break-even is a four month ROI before electricity costs. Shipping isn't until end of July, and there two variables stick out at me:

* Potential algorithm change would make the next viable thing ETC, assuming that doesn't hard fork (I will be buying some ETC though, I could see this pumping up the value)
* 3 ETH > 0.6 ETH block reward EIP takes that break-even out to 6 months at current pricing, though theoretically price should be driven up
* Should Casper hybrid begin by the end of the year, the potential ROI after break-even is not worth it taking up my space and capital

I do think that this is a very attractive price point. Hell, one of them is as much as 6x 1070s. BUT viability is limited and salvage value is non-existent. Difficulty for GPUs will shoot up anyway, so we're about to see a lot of network hashrate divert to other algorithms.

IMO, this isn't enough hash rate (180MH/s) or availability (one per address) to warrant the concern for centralization.
I think everyone was.

As for the OP's post, it [appears to have been removed by automod](https://i.imgur.com/CAUAeZ4.png) for reasons not controlled by this sub. Are you the OP and posting from an alt account? Because that's the only person who would have gotten a notice that it was removed.
What I'm saying is that it was not removed.

It's right here: https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/86vkfk/rented_hashpower_in_smaller_pools/

If I open it as an incognito window, meaning as someone who does not subscribe to this thread, it is still visible.
I see no problem with the details, but anyone can report a post or comment for violating rules. It will only be removed under three conditions:

1. Reddit Admin (not the mods of this sub) feels that it violates the site-wide rules
2. Mod team removes it
3. If the post receives three user reports, automod will remote it.
I used different pools and blocked outgoing traffic on the L3+'s VLAN to everything except for my pools. Another option is a local stratum proxy and only allowing the proxy to talk out to the pool.

After disassembling the Blissz firmware, I believe that I narrowed down the code execution to be in the cgminer binary, as the miner ignores changes and overwrites the ones made in the config files. I am not skilled enough to reverse engineer the compiled cgminer. I thought about just replacing it, so I SCP'd into the device and just swapped it out, but on reboot this will revert. I'm not sure how to recompile the firmware without bricking the L3+, so I'm of no help to replace it on a permanent basis.

Let me know if you find a guide!
Not sure if sarcasm or what. But I'm not seeing a single thing removed by myself or /u/Automod.

This is the only post I see by you that has any mod action pending, and it's a user report: https://i.imgur.com/frI4Jpp.jpg
Bitmain has always historically been believed to sell "used" units. No proof exists, but the idea that the company's hardware refreshes are based on selling old equipment is generally thought to be the truth.

We've also seen several jumps of 18 TH/s randomly over the past few months. Speculation that these were batches of F3s were also made. This would be around 12,000 of the 1.5GH/s units pictured here.

I don't fear centralization with ASICs, but it is worth noting that GPUs will pretty much become worthless with ETH if these are real unless the EIP is granted and the algorithm is changed. You should read it here: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/958

Looks like an awp3++ (unless a similar case was used for something else).

Give that it's a 1600w PSU, probably a max of 1400w? More likely to be somewhere between 800-1200w though.
Thanks, appreciate the kind words.

I understand that some of the more veteran users have issues with some of the new guys on the sub. There are fundementally different ways that the two groups operate, and it's ever more apparent in the past few months.

It's a difficult balancing act for sure, and without censoring opinions, there's not much I can do to pursuede the community to think one way or the other. Sucks.

Regardless, I wish you the best and hope to follow the progress of your side efforts. Your input will be missed.
I've deleted a single comment on this thread that told OP to "suck a bag of dicks".

No other comments have been deleted by me. I believe in an open forum with as little sensorship on opinions as possible, meaning I remove as little as possible from the discussions. However, if stuff like that arises that just baligerantly insults a user, it has no place in the discussion and I feel that it appropriate to remove.

I'm unsure if OP is insinuating that the moderation team suppresses posts and comments related to opinions we don't agree with; because I do not. If he is referring to downvotes, then that is unfortunately something we can't control, as those are unmoderatable.

Juding by the upvotes on the post I replied to, I don't want the stigma to spread that we actively surprsess posts or remove things that we don't agree with. FUD isn't good for crypto, and it isn't good for this sub, so I wanted to nip it in the bud, so so speak.

**The moderation log confirms this**: https://i.imgur.com/VsEcMBd.png

Always feel free to reach out with any questions.
The post read "suck a bag of dicks OP".

Disagreements are fine, but comments like that are not.

So 300% capacity with 20% charge cycle lifespan. Ouch.

A few questions then:

* When do you consider the battery lifecycle to be depleted (at what percentage of initial charge)?
* Does capacity diminish linearly as you put the cells through discharges? (e.g.: 10 charges = 270% capacity, 20 charge = 240% capacity, etc)
* How much more affordable do these batteries have the potential to be? Right now 5.3 kWh of battery power (444x 18650s) runs around $1500 used; meaning a Tesla 85D has around ~$25,000 worth of battery cells. Do you believe that LiS batteries can be manufactured at scale with a comparable cost given its 20% lifespan?
* How do you feel about the long-term feasibility to LiS batteries compare to solid state products being researched now?
Our sales engineer specifically told us to avoid moving up to 5.6 for this reason alone. Hoping 6.0 is a bit more flexible, but I haven't tried the beta in my lab.

SEO is hurt by long titles, so that's why most news outlets keep under 180 characters for the hed (headline).
Yeah, I agree; not sure why a "weight saving" plastic valve cover is even worth a mention. I also checked Toyota's patents and could not find any mention of a resin-based head. Could be that the material is some special woven polymer or something.

Pretty much every car I've owned in the paste decade other than my MK2 Golf 8v has had a plastic valve cover. The '90s is when automakers really started to get fancy with cheap plastic and longevity on those parts *really* isn't that great.
No worries! I wouldn't have known unless their press team told me. They agreed that it was worded confusingly.
Just wanted to mention that I got clarification on this from Toyota's media team.

This pertains to the **valve cover only** and has nothing to do with the cylinder head. The press release was just poorly worded.
I do too. And now that I think about it, there's a supercharger within a mile from my local facility too.
It's so frustrating because literally every other filtering company has a Chrome extension, yet Fortinet wants you to pay ~$3-4/user for FortiAuthenticator

Yup. We have another client that we push EMS for and negotiated that way, way, way under list. It's an easy decision for me. They just reiterate that they can't allocate funds right now (likely because their last solution was free). I'm still on their case about this. Thanks!
I think a Google Form would be ideal for this. A few members have tried to collect that data but I can't recall the outcome being published.
Playing the long game and assuming it will recover.

Sure, it's a loss now, but continued mining at a lower difficulty could result in a higher coin accumulation for a potential recovery.
Interesting take on it.

I honestly can't remember the scene OP is talking about because I haven't seen this movie in a very long time and was relaying information I knew about this common tactic.
It was a common Axis trick (specifically German) to use prisoners from concentration camps to stage as decoys. It could have been that the directors wanted to convey that soldiers weren't trained for this, or simply to convey ignorance. No idea, but I'd really like to know now lol.

As the Nazi part rose to power, the party's propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels, began to take control of all radio and news paper outlets. This became a crucial part of a many smaller projects created to lull the general populous into believing there was foreign aggression towards the German people extending past the sanctions imposed after WW1.

Specifically, this aided the German's first power move against Europe as *Operation Himmler* took place to make people believe they needed to bring territory forfeited to Polans back to the Fatherland by staging border incidents.

In 1939, one of the towers used by *Sender Gleiwitz* (one of the stations broadcasting Goebbels propaganda) was "attacked" by the Poles. History would record this as a false flag maneuver crafted by the Germans, as they took prisoners from worker camps, dressed them in Polish military garb, and staged an attack on the radio station.

It wasn't until 1945 that one of the SS officers came public with the information before the world realized that this incident, the one the "officially" sparked cause for the German invasion of Poland (and ultimately WWII), was carried out by Germany on its own people.
Play nice or get a time out.
Nobody cares where anyone mines. It's just more profitable in some countries.

Not sure what this post is trying to convey.
Bitmain has always been rumored to sell their devices used.

Though this has never been confirmed, many miners feel that it's common practice for the company like Bitmain to mine with a batch for so long, then turn around and sell them.

If there is an ASIC out there for Ethash, which is possible, it's theoretically smarter to keep it a secret before the ETH contributors find out and [attempt to push an algorithm change](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper).

You need to move heat out of the room you store the miners in. Ambient temperature is important, but being able to move volumes of stale unconditioned air is also important.

This *concept* applies to you, but to scale it will only appeal to large builds. But learn the concepts of [hot and cold isles in datacenters](https://www.missioncriticalmagazine.com/ext/resources/MC/Home/Files/PDFs/WP-APC-Hot_vs_Cold_Aisle.pdf) to properly build out a cooling solution.

In August/September of last year the D3 had a break-even in 20 days. By November, difficulty increased over 800%. Today, it might generate about $200 by year end.

If Cryptonight goes the way of x11, it'll be the same road. I don't trust it at a $12000 price tag. Early adopters might make out, but by second batch, I'd be iffy.
Correct

I feel bad for the people who don't realize the algorithm is changing for XMR. Not like other coins aren't minable, but still. At $12k, this is a hard pass.

This is going to bite quite a few hands, I bet.
Last I heard it was $800 and Asia markets only.

They're rebranded 1080s with GDDR5X, so terrible with ETH.

Again, speculation.
No for sale posts. Removed and locking.
OP got a timeout for his responses. Don't be a dick.
Right. Usually a residential ISP provides a dynamic public IP. But if it changes, how will OP know the new one? He'd have to use a DynamicDNS service and something local on his network to update it.
NAT'ing generally doesn't work like this.

You map a Public IP > Private IP. Using DHCP (without a reservation) can release the lease if the unit power cycles during the DORA phase and another device can claim it's IP.

It's a 48x48x96 tent. I've since upgraded to dual 6" Vivosun 440cfm fans to expel heat.
Looks like we have [very similar setups](https://instagram.fash1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/vp/23243629a949ad5b8e7ba195a967c06d/5B4A776A/t51.2885-15/e35/27576632_535473850165908_1473588109433110528_n.jpg).

I'll have to take a more recent photo of mine, but I actually found my rigs to run cooler if I ran airflow sideways over the units in the same configuration.
I agree with this; it's mostly malicious gains with XMR now.

I'm honestly trying to figure out how a single GPU ("$120/month") is supposed to be a space heater, or worth that much.
Yep. The "isAuthToRun" call from AntBleed may have been resolved, but there's still a call home since the fix.
I go one step further than this lol.

In addition to my GPUs, I run ASICs that call home. That's something that I'm not okay with. I VLAN off my traffic and allow traffic to *only* the IP of my mining pools.
Secure it with a password (other than root/root) and forward port 80 from your router to the internal IP of your S9 (make sure it's statically set)

Just have to hope your NAT'd address (external IP) doesn't change.
As long as your PSU supports it, 240v is more efficient. Less power draw per circuit, more stable, and ability to run higher power (think of Bitmain's APW3++ 1200w on 110v vs 1600w on 240v).

There's a social club near me that still has one of these in operation. It's even certified and stamped by the state.
I have big ol' hipster glasses and I actually had a really annoying time getting my glasses to fit.

So I [bought these guys on Zenni for $9](https://www.zennioptical.com/p/metal-alloy-full-rim-frame-with-spring-hinge/4500?skuId=450015).

They work perfectly and are cheaper than pretty much any alternative out there. My wife told me I can't leave the house with them on though.
I'm willing to bet that he had a bad unit and swapped his damaged hashboards out for yours.

Not sure if they have serial numbers on them, of if there is a "quality" seal on the unit.

Edit: Looks like the hash boards might be stamped with what batch they were from. Take a look: https://i.imgur.com/WJas5Kv.png

I would accept the return and if they did damage it, or swap the boards, refute the case and let eBay know what they did.
* $10.53 per L3+ on viaBTC
 * .0498 LTC
* $0.39 in Doge via merged mining
 * ~78 DOGE

So $10.92/day per miner, total.

Speculation. Look up the past threads on this.

I wouldn't advise doing anything until an official announcement.
I mine with viaBTC (what OP posted) with my ASICs on occasion; right now the luck for LTC is meh, so I'm back and forth between P2Pool and vBTC. It's a decent pool with a great app (app was actually why I even tried the pool) and fair earnings. They offer PPS+ and PPLNS with active switching but limit you to once every 24 hours. I saw a ~23% increase over my last profit switching pool.

I was considering pointing my eth rigs over too, but haven't taken the time to do it just yet.

Hashrate is a modest ~775GH/s so it's not a tiny pool, but not near larger pools like Ethermine or Nanopool.

In the same boat. I asked on discord and got no response.
I work with one of the largest first-level importer of the cards in the US (one that sells and distributes to the big name stores). I can say that this has not been communicated in any way with myself or the other dozen vendors I work with when consulting.

Additionally, prices have risen over the past six months due to the cost of memory. VRAM from Samsung and Hynix have increased 30%; meaning a $400 1070 would be reasonably priced at $520 (high-level overview calculated on MSRP, but you get the idea. Memory prices are up across the board. In fact, the same DDR4 RAM I paid $130 for last year is $230 now.

Unless you can provide concrete evidence or reputable source reporting on this, I'm tossing it up to speculation/FUD.
Removed. Please don't link to non-Bitmain sites when talking about Bitmain ASICs.
Thanks for the input! I'll put this on my to-do.
One of the ideas is to have a second mod work on helping keep this up to date. I spend a few hours each week trying to go through it and comb out details when I'm made aware.

Regardless, always welcome for feedback. Could you point out any area which you feel to be dated?
Need time-stamped photos my dude.
I run Vivosun 6" 440cfm fans. About $60 and pull ~80w. Could consider two of them to move 880CFM (~20% more air) with 18% less power ($0.15/day).
Agreed, traditional 6" (ducting) worm clamps are best for this type of install. $2/ea at Home Depot.

The 6" ducting is also called "dryer ducting" and is about ~$0.9-$1.20 per foot.
Yes. I originally didn't have my ASICs in my tent, so when I moved things together, it got pretty hot. I also didn't have an intake inline fan and couldn't cycle fresh air fast enough, so I set up a box fan to run air *across* the hardware to cool temps, with the added benefit of pushing fresh air into the tent. Worked well.
Assuming the availability is there for next gen cards, sure.
I'd have to read into this to be sure, but I'm all to familiar with MITM attacks. Assuming it doesn't use any sort of HPKP (cert pinning), you should be able to intercept, decrypt, alter, re-encrypt, and send it off. The downside is that this will increase latency and as a result, stale shares.
This isn't supposed to be a TA, lol.

It's saying that if you aren't trading, you're missing out on profits. Mining and holding is a way to make money, but mining and trading it a way to make much more, especially in a bullish market.

But that's a post for /r/EthTrader
980 cards are still going for $400+ [on ebay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=gtx+980&_sacat=27386&_sop=1). If the new cards are scarce, I think the 10xx cards will remain close to MSRP for quite some time, even with the market flooded.
Cash | Buy Order | Sell Order | ETH Balance | Net Worth

$1,200 | - | 1.333 ETH @ $900 | 0 ETH | $1,200
Boiiiiiiiiii if you don't move those intake fans away from the tent flap.

Actually it looks more like a perspective thing since I can't see the side caving in. Should be okay, just watch for it being unable to move enough cool air. I might also recommend a box fan to move air across your tent (left to right). I ended up setting mine up to blow air additional air in from my side flaps with two box fans and dropped ambient temps from 94-98^F to 77-85^F.

Also, I really like the controller on that inline fan.
Honestly this depends how much you trade.

If you're a buy and hold guy, this is easy. Bought in at $100 and sell at $900, you're up $800.

But if you trade more frequently, you have the potential to earn more *assuming* you don't make a bad trade. Example: buy in at $100, sell at $200, re-buy in at $150, and then sell at $900, you're up $1100.

Looks about right. My GPU miners use about 2MB an hour, and my ASICs are under 500KB

Yeah, it seems like they only care to support the Windows platform lol. I didn't care enough to dig into it when I posted this, but I suppose that will be next on my to-do.
Network engineer here. I think you need to focus on much more than just DHCP pool sizes; this is an entire infrastructure project.

First, let's talk about your edge device. Client needs to decide if they're going to just use whatever juniper or business-class edge device the IP dumps on site, or if they're running their own. Consider running a security appliance (like an ASA) before the core, because the last thing you want is to have someone compromise your miners and take 1TH/s of hashing power for their own wallet.

My GPU miners produce about ~50 sessions/second (ASIC less than 1/3 of that). At 5k clients, you need an edge device and firewall capable of handling 250,000 simultaneous sessions *at minimum*. A Cisco ASA 5515x or 5525x should do the job, but it's not cheap.

Next, switching.

Assuming you buy all 48-port equipment, you're going to need ~105 switches (plus spares) and the rack space. Keep in mind, you also need to consider cable runs, punch downs, and drops. Either some Cisco C2960x-48 (~$2,500 street or ~$500-800 used) will get the job done.

You'll be converging over 100 switches back to your core, so now you'll need some distribution switching. The 3560 should be able to do this, then converge them all into a 3850 core.

In short, this is a full blown infrastructure project and shouldn't be taken lightly. I'm just pulling these specs out of thin air without reviewing project details, so be sure to do your homework and hire someone who is familiar with enterprise datacenter setups.

And I totally forgot to talk about your DHCP setups, lol. As someone else mentioned, an active/active Linux ISC setup would be a good bet here. Segregate machines in /22 broadcast domains or smaller (I say /22 because of the number of sessions being similar to that of a lightweight user) and if you see performance problems, take them smaller.
I had mine taken down. The OC and power savings is around ~5.1% and the mining fee/switching works out to just under a 5% loss. So it makes the firmware not really worth throwing on the miner. If the dev fee was removed, it might be a different story.

I took a look at the compiled and running code on the L3+ and could not locate the configuration that continually inserted the devfee code. It appears to be baked into cgminer anyway.
Thanks for the information! I really appreciate it.

> if for any reason they don't have enough LTC available to payout miners then your earnings will be forfeited

Oof. That's rough.
Thanks for the info! Is PPLNS really that much more profitable than PPS+? Is there a profit switching pool you prefer that pays out in LTC?

I like Prohashing, but there are way too many red flags for me to mine there (fees, up time, business practices, etc).
I do have AwesomeMiner, just not enough ASIC miners (only 6 L3+ plus a handful of GPU rigs) to judge profitability on multiple pools. I wasn't sure if there was a chart or what.

Are you seeing more profit mining LTC directly or on profit switching pools?
ahashpool is most profitable at only ~95GH/s with scrypt?

Where are you getting these stats from? I'm not questioning it; just legitimately wondering where I can keep an eye on the same numbers. Thanks!
Each board pulls 200w; so 800w +10% (880w) is Bitmain's recommendation. At 80% duty cycle, that would be an 1100w PSU. Bitmain's APW3++ is rated for 1200w on 110v or 1600w on 240v.
Where did you order them from?

I work with a lot of resellers, and my wife works for the distributors to the big stores. Her organization gets supply directly from the manufacturers to sell to the box stores. They have been having very scarce supplies over the past month and the situation had not improved.

Was your card charged, or was a hold put on it? Did you have an estimated or hard ship date? Is this a reputable company?
Hive is pretty decent. I tried it over the weekend too, and once you get past the small learning curve of the web interface it's smooth sailing.
Wait, is ethOS displaying ads on the dashboard now?
I'm assuming you want to be able to boot and view the BIOS, etc.

I'll let you know upfront that this is expensive. An IP KVM switch is enterprise equipment and is *not* cheap.

So that's why you buy used!

Specifically something like the [HP 408965](https://www.pcliquidations.com/p71348-hp-408965-001-ip?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cse&utm_term=71348&r160164167166161&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2snUBRDfARIsAIGfpqHLX4zpDc9deD_DkZOk7Z95fIA5AjheRAL52cxNb77QLUP3czcphXsaAvBUEALw_wcB). Ultimately, these get coupled with [RJ-45 terminated interfaces](https://www.ebay.com/p/HP-Rack-Console-IP-KVM-Switch-KVM-Interface-Adapter-286597-001/17012054894) that is useful as long as you have a PS2 port for keyboard and mouse. I'll have to dig deeper if you need USB.

IO Gear also makes an [IP KVM with USB](https://www.iogear.com/product/GCS1808KITU/).

To get this across the WAN, you'd need to decide how to tunnel across to the data. Maybe terminate a VPN there?

Good luck!
ASICs are great until they're obsolete. Bitmain beat the proprietary Sia ASIC to market and eventually when more get delivered and the Obelisk ASIC comes out, break-even will be months out.
You're probably exactly correct on this one! It's definitely a niche market, and when you're used to spending ten times the price because something is tailored to be adaptive, a market brought mainstream like this will get a great deal of business.

Thanks for the kind words.
Two main issues I can think of.

First, if a tag or seam begins to irritate the skin, it might not be possible for the wearer to actually reposition themselves depending on their physical limitations.

Second, some of the kids have sensory processing disorder and can start having breakdowns because they don't understand what they're feeling. A lot of kids who have CP derived from a hypoxic event have some wires crossed that make them confuse pain for another stimulation (e.g. laughing when getting a vaccine).
My daughter has CP and Target recently released a line of [adaptive clothing](https://www.target.com/c/kids-adaptive-clothing/-/N-1laue). Holy shit, you'd never think such a small thing can make life easier.

From hidden slits for her feeding tube, to elongated necks for her tracheostomy, and even a [jacket that basically zips in half](https://www.target.com/p/girls-adaptive-puffer-jacket-cat-jack-153-purple/-/A-52782097) to make it easy to get on and off; they nailed it. AND it doesn't cost $300 just because it's adaptive. I'm really impressed to be able to walk into a store and just buy something that works for her like a normal kid.

I doubt the person who convinced the store to do this will ever realize what a big deal this is for families like mine.
Ethernet is not measured in gauge (well, it is, but that's not useful in this case), but rather in cabling standard. The T-568B wiring standard was finalized in 1995, and Cat5e has been around since the early 2000s.

Any modern Ethernet cable will work.
Any evidence to back that up?

I work with around two dozen resellers and across the board while consulting with other companies and my bulk cost has only gone up around 5% if you take rising DRAM prices into account.
Dunno. I just delete them and move on with my life.

My wife works for one of the largest distributors on the east coast that deals with a lot of the box stores. I get GPUs at cost, and can confidently say that they haven't increased more than 5% from the manufacturer since last summer.

This isn't to say that costs aren't being increased elsewhere, but the consumer gaming market isn't really getting shafted by the manufacturer in price, more so availability (which, though indirect, is consequently driving up price).
Nvidia isn't increasing the price to resellers. The box stores are making the money on you.
Well the price of the S9 went up from $1400 > $2700, soooo
See the below from /u/AutoModerator 
There are a few, and it's gotten worse as a lot of people in the community have come over from the gaming side of things, or are simply unhappy with the way profits have gone. I'm not going to defend either side on it, but I also won't promote those kind of actions.

But it's the internet dude. Gotta either let them go, or [report the coments](https://i.imgur.com/ruyMk85.png) so they pop up to take care of in the mod queue.

Here are a few from the thread that you mentioned:

* [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/7zrpeq/nothing_like_that_new_card_smell/duri9xy/) which came from someone clearly not in the mining community.
* [This guy](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/7zrpeq/nothing_like_that_new_card_smell/duqbumw/) who was immediately downvoted
* [Then there's this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/7zrpeq/nothing_like_that_new_card_smell/duqhgc6/) calling you out for being [self-admittingly "passive aggressive"](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/7zrpeq/nothing_like_that_new_card_smell/duqgpf0/) in the same thread

The old saying goes, "opinions are like assholes..." and there are a lot of both around here. Gotta either work together to report them and flush that out, or brush it off.
First, make sure your home has the capacity on the main panel. You can't just add a sub panel and call it a day.

If you have 100A service and you put in a 200A main, you still will likely be stressing the lines from your power supplier, so call them and ask what amperage service you have. If you need to upgrade lines, you'll likely need to have an inspector verify the work and submit an approval to the power company before they come out to do their work.

Now, when I did this for my home, I upgraded my entire panel and ran 240v. Calculate your total draw per rig and decide how many you're going to run. You mentioned 1GHz, which is about ~35x 1070s. That's ~3.2kW of power draw from the cards and ~800w of idle system draw, or 36A on 110v // 17A on 240v.

I personally would run multiple 240v circuits for this, each machining out on 20A with an 80% maximum duty cycle. I set up each circuit with 4x 6-20P outlets and a 20A breaker. For my ASICs, I draw 3.3A per L3+ and 5.5 per S9. I run a maximum of 3x S9s per circuit, or 4x L3+.

Hope that helps!

I work in public education elsewhere in the country.

Mandated reported is *definitely* a thing outside of CA (in response to /u/lildootdoot; I responded to the wrong comment thread), but requires the discretion of the reporter. Additionally, mandated reporting is **not anonymous**.

Couple that with special needs parents repeatedly pushing what they believe is best for their child (I'm one of those parents, so I should know) and you've put the teachers in a compromised state that surely influenced the decision.
I normally don't like to give tax advice, but this is a simple one.

* Asset = tangible (GPUs)
* Expense = nothing physical to show at the end of the fiscal year (salary, benefits, etc)

You should be using a straight line depreciation calculation based on the month of purchase, life expectancy of the GPU, and the salvage value. If you don't know the last two, assume 24 months and $0 (it breaks). Should it break further or you sell/extend the service life, you'll need to make adjustments when filing for another year.

Based on the size of your mining operation, I'd suggest reaching out to a CPA regardless.
Here's what I generally do:

**Scenario**: 6 cards were working yesterday, but one card stopped working today and won't come online with reboots.

**Troubleshooting**:

1. Unplug one card and boot back into the OS. Is the card showing up?
 * No: This card is not the problem. Shut the rig off, plug it back in and repeat until you find the one causing the issue.
 * Yes: This card is the one having the problem, continue to troubleshoot.
2. You found the card having the issue. On the motherboard, unplug the USB 3.0 cable from a known good PCIe x1 adapter and replace plug your known bad card into it. Does it work?
 * No: The issue is not the PCIe x1 adapter, continue to troubleshoot.
 * Yes: The issue is the PCIe x1 adapter, replace it. If this doesn't work, the PCI slot may be bad on the motherboard.
3. Since the PCIe x1 adapter is not the problem, we should test the next component in line: the USB cable. Swap the known bad cable for a known good one. Is the card showing?
 * No: The problem is not the USB cable, continue troubleshooting.
 * Yes: The problem is the USB cable, replace it.
4. Next up is the riser. Swap the riser from a known bad card to a known good card. *including power connections* (make sure that the GPU and riser are plugged in to the same PSU, no exceptions). Did this solve the problem?
 * No: Plug the GPU into another computer and ensure it works. If it does not, you may have a damaged GPU.
 * Yes: The riser is bad, replace it.
I just had this happen over the weekend.

I know you replaced the riser, but did you troubleshooting the USB 3.0 cable and PCIe x1 connector on the mobo? Any time I had a riser fail, it has been the PCIe riser connector on the motherboard, and was again this weekend.
6x Nvidia 1070s per rig.

But 1060s at fair market price will be around $2,100 entry for around the same, plus have higher resale.
From what I recall, these are laptop GPUs with an embedded system running the mining software instead of Windows/EthOS/etc.

Using my tutorial, I see!

Another way to do this pretty much instantaneously is to use a Raspberry Pi to monitor your miner using the application's API. When it reads an abnormal hashrate for so long, it can use it's GPIO pins to control a relay that will short the reboot pins on the motherboard. I'll have to try to dig up the project.
Yep, I agree with that. BCH faced the same initial fight and is still alive.
[Sup](https://i.redd.it/fkrimf5ry2g01.jpg)
Yeah, the take from the LTC community is that the fork is largely unofficial and unwanted. These kinds of tactics to get people to point hashing power at the coin are disheartening.
Kind of funny, given how security conscious Tesla is. This is the future of connected vehicle and should be feared and regulated.

I wonder what they exploited...
Yeah, this is an age old argument. It was said when LTC was at $10, $25, $50, $100, etc. Mining is a calculated investment and should be treated as such. New miners are late to the party, but as long as it's profitable (or they wish to take a calculated risk to hope that their investment is in the black in so many months), then this is a decision that they need to make.

Additionally, LCC is a sha-256 coin, you realize how beaten out you are by difficulty and ASICs?
No problem! A cheaper alternative would be a 2960s, also ensure you're buying a non-PoE device to avoid high costs. These things are reliable used because they're built for enterprise. There's a reason they cost $7k brand new.

If you only have three rigs; that might be overkill. Maybe invest in a better edge device with a large number of wired ports instead?
Hello fellow miner.

Look into networked PDUs.
lol

Is this what things have become?
Problem is, everything is a rumor at this point.
/r/Ethtrader
I mined BWK upon release for three days and dumped it for $5200 when it hit peak.

It's quite possible given enough hash power and hitting enough coins at the right time. Probable? Unlikely. But definitely possible.
Yeah, this. It seems localized to the configuration of whatever slot that's connected to. I had an extension cord fall over a top-facing vent recently and caused ~80^F temps in an otherwise 65^F environment.
Oof. I would not be dual mining Sia at a 7MH/s ETH loss
Consider lowering intensity of the coin you're dual mining.
All open
That's really up to you. $4k for 180MH/S is about double the cost to built it yourself. I suggest learning how to build one first: https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/wiki/

Furthermore, you'll be bringing home around $18 per day before electric costs are factored in, making your break-even around 4 months at current difficulty and rates.

Only you can decide if that's right for you, so I suggest putting the effort in and making the decision for yourself. Good luck!
Tier your cards. Right now they're all just blowing hot air onto each other and it can't raise quickly enough to get moved out by the top inline fan.

I have my top shelf exhausting upward and all subsequent bottom shelf exhausting to the back of the tent. A box fan sits in front of each row to push air out.

See this image for an example of how my tent is set up: https://i.redd.it/fkrimf5ry2g01.jpg
B& OP.

Thanks for the easy links!
Yeah, I figured as much. I'd just weight static routes with different ADs and set an SLA to down the route if it fails to respond.
Honestly my GPU rigs bring in more than my ASICs ($14/day compared to $12/day) and entry is about the same cost. Resale value is higher on GPUs anyway, making your actual ROI (after end-of-life depreciation is considered) higher.
I had to delete my post asking for the blissz firmware, but when everything was all said and done, the dev fee basically equalized any gains anyway, so just keep that in mind.
Yep, I use AwesomeMiner as well. Doesn't get any simpler and covers basically everything you need.

My only complaint it that there's no external access or API calls (that I know of), so "alerting" can be more of a babysitting task.
Is this just being used as a backup route out of your network? If so, maybe consider adding something more inward like a Layer 3 switch (Cisco 3560) that can do dynamic routing and failover if your Gateway of Last Resort should become unreachable.

Not sure if the Huawei or Mikrotik supports RIP or anything; but alternatively you can use static routes and IPSLA arguments to achieve it on the Cisco device.
Thanks so much!
You don't mention how the devices are connected to the internet (wired/wireless) or any hardware.

Be aware that rigs can easily degrade your wireless connection if you're running 2.4GHz. not only do the cards generate interference, but so does USB 3.0 (risers).

Crypto is a risk, no matter how you look at it. This past year has been exceptionally well, however the recession that we've been in so far (and market uncertainty as it heads mainstream) can make is question if the contracts are worth the risk.

I don't want to tell anyone how to spend their money, but just keep in mind that there will always be overhead. Someone needs to buy the GPUs to hash and it's never going to be for-cost.

Genesis, for example, is $4,440 for 2 years of 120 MH/s. That's $37 per MH/s and at the end of Year 2, you're left with just the payout you've gotten.

120 MH/s is about 4x Nvidia 1070s. At retail cost, you could get these for around $350/ea ($1,400) and the rest of the rig for ~$200. At 450w ($0.1/kWh), you'd pay $780 over the cost of two years. Your total investment for these rigs are around $2,400 before you recoup the cost for cards.

Let's say you sell them for $150, that brings your investment to $1,800 ($15 per MH/s) for two years of mining. This is completely agreeable to your statement that building a rig can be cheaper. I think the key phrasing is:

> "under certain circumstances if you get in at the right time"

That's absolutely true, and I completely agree with you. Mining as a whole is all about timing and knowing when to trade. But unfortunately as difficulty rises and the amount of "lock-in" to one coin you have with these contracts, it's just not that appealing, especially at 250% of the total investment cost.
Say it with me:

Cloud 👏 mining 👏 is 👏 a 👏 waste 👏 of 👏 money 👏

People buy into it because they think it's minimal investment for big return. In reality, it's a risk (just like mining) that leaves you without any equipment to sell when you're done.

Sure, it's attractive because you don't have the overhead of having to physically house and manage miners, but that doesn't quantify the loss in my book. I'd rather buy coins or host miners, but that's just my preference.
Ah, you're right. I didn't notice that!

I submitted a case (#09347636) to Belkin regarding this and they are looking into a feature request.

LCC is a SHA-256 coin, chances are the ASICs will hit it first.
First, welcome to the enclosure club! You'll love the cost savings and lack of heat.

Here are a few points I'd like to make:

1. Install fans at the top of the unit
2. Ensure you have the proper air flow. [**Here is a document**](http://www.pbsionthenet.net/article/10268/Enclosure-airflow-calculations--a-simple-guide.aspx) explaining how to calculate flow in enclosures.
3. Space out your fans. Unlike the photo you posted, you don't want to necessarily just draw air out of one central point. This can cause hot spots and some cards may not be cooled as well as others.
4. Leave headroom in the enclosure for hot air to collect. This may not seem important, but my cards get a LOT warmer when moved three feet closer to the top.

You're looking for inline fans. I personally run [**Vivosun 440cfm**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CTM0JF2/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) units. I ran only one when I had three rigs in my tent, but after moving my ASICs in, I'm hooking up a second to improve temps a bit more.

You can use conventional 6" dryer duct to move the air, but make sure you get the proper worm clamps and a Wye splitter (or better yet, two venting outlets for improved flow). The straighter the ducting, the better flow you will get.

[**Here is an old video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6Z36k5P3To&t=2s) that I uploaded showing when I just had two rigs. [**This is how it looks now**](https://i.redd.it/fkrimf5ry2g01.jpg), and creates quite a bit more heat.

Good luck with your build!

Just apply for a business license with your state and if it asks to describe your business, just list "data center" or "hosting provider". It's usually as simple as filing online and writing a check for $100 or so.

If you say 'Crypto' to banks, you might as well tell them you're a pot farmer in a legal state. They don't want your money because the industry as a whole is new and risky.

Just call yourself a datacenter or hosting provider, plain and simple. 
When the drivers crash, are they locking up to where CLI is not accessible? I've had cards on Ubuntu just disable themselves when this happens with no impact to system state.

I would honestly use Python to automate this software-side if there are no kernel panics going on to stop it from running.

Base if off of this: https://forum.zensystem.io/t/hashrate-monitoring-with-python-claymore-and-collectd/282

And just add a function to monitor `reportedHashRate` and `sudo reboot` if less than `thresholdHashRate` for `idleTime`.
Fortunately you have some brick and mortar resources availabile to you as well.

My wife works for one of the largest first-tier suppliers (who sells to the big name box stores) and even they are tapped right now.
What OS did you throw on the rigs?

Good luck, because stock is scarce all around and it's likely not getting better any time soon.
Monero isn't the first to do this. The entire development of Ethereum on the Ethash algorithm was designed to thwart ASICs by a tactic called "poisoning the well". Read below:

>	... one notably interesting feature of this algorithm is that it allows anyone to “poison the well”, by introducing a large number of contracts into the blockchain specifically designed to stymie certain ASICs. The economic incentives exist for ASIC manufacturers to use such a trick to attack each other.

This isn’t saying that other coins using Ethash (Dagger-Hashimoto minable coins, not coins using Ethereum contracts) aren’t at-risk. Bitmain has already sold [GPU builds in the past](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitmain-debuts-high-speed-ethereum-gpu-miners-after-dash-rollout), however this was a widely unsuccessful grab (at least in the US market).
If it's real, and you're mining ETH, it means nothing. Ethereum as a whole is [ASIC resistant](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) and can (in theory) adjust its algorithm on the fly.

If you're mining an Ethash coin (and that's the algorithm the miner is made for), then just move to a coin with a different algorithm like CryptoNight, Pascal, NIST5, Skunkhash, etc... Difficulty with re-distribute and hopefully coin prices will adjust accordingly.
It's all about moving the air out.

The tent keeps the area around them a proper temperature and doesn't raise my bill to condition the air. I actually went from an $60-80/mo portable AC to the tent with a $6/mo fan and it's been golden.
Happy cake day!
That's a shame :(

Consider the use of SMoS (free to try) or HiveOS (free up to three rigs).
It was a rebalancing of the "ice age" block time. AFAIK it's not on the "to do" radar to decrease again.
What was connected to that line?

Specifically, how many cards and risers were chained together?
Lower power consumption, higher base hash rate

> You know the thing in your kitchen that heats up food? The microwave? The reason that a microwave works is because it causes water molecules to rapidly vibrate at 2.4GHz to create heat.
2.4 GHz is the same frequency that 802.11 a/b/g/n, though that operates at ~100 mW at the radio emitter. Your microwave is probably 800-1000 W - much higher. Long term exposure to 2.4GHz at -85 dB (probable noise floor) is probably not great, but I doubt it'll be as terrible as standing in front of a microwave for the same amount of time.

> 2.4GHz is also really good at penetration (in b4 "your mom"), so it'll go through walls very well, but not so much through people because people are water, and water "resonates" ("vibrates") at that frequency.
tl;dr: Use 5GHz wireless if you're that worried, the rest is likely just heat.

Gotcha; not sure why I forgot FE cards were a thing.

Anywho, be persistent with your troubleshooting efforts, and do what I mentioned above. Make zero note of mining while working with them, otherwise you'll likely carry on with no resolution for ages.

This is an interference issue if you've got a ton of cards. You'll need to go hardwired.

The mining community uses "ROI" synonymous to "break-even" on the cost of a rig.

In reality, ROI isn't a measurement of time, but a measurement of value over a set period of time. **For example**, you can say that your rig made you $800 over 30 days, but you can't say that it took 30 days to ROI your $800 rig.

Nvidia chose to go the shitty route with headless 1060s as "mining cards"; we see where that got them :)
Honestly though, that's like saying that the influx of cupcake war TV shows didn't influence people to go out and buy a KitchenAid stand mixer.

All of a sudden, a dozen little home-based bakeries form around your house and now the price of mixers have inflated 20%. It's how the economy works and to place blame on the miners for taking advantage of an industry tool (GPUs) for business rather than leisure is just lack of insight imo
I'm not saying Linus' take is inaccurate or a bad thing, but those forming opinions hearing that mining is the problem automatically jump to conclusions.
The problem is, big YouTubers like jayztwocents has openly come out to blame miners for the video card shortage, even Linus mentioned that it's responsible and price hike, completely ignoring that this has been piling up for longer than it takes to conceive, gestate, and birth a child.

Card manufacturers refused to ramp up production, and in Nvidia's case (never mind their [already shit business practices](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/44h7dv/why_do_people_hate_nvidia/)), even passive-aggressively [came out against miners](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/cryptocurrency-mining-graphics-card-prices/) to defer blame.

The public bought into it and just inherently blame the miners for causing every single problem in their life.

* Are GPUs expensive right now? Yes.
* Are GPUs hard to find right now? Yes.
* Are some big businesses (*cough* Genesis *cough*) [taking advantage of this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/7vdh6f/25_million_new_gpus_came_online_in_january/)? Of course.

But the hate between gamers and miners need to end. If I take a trip over to my help desk at work (filled with gamers, some of which I play with regularly), it's a constant beratement whenever any news breaks because they know I have quite a bit invested into mining.
- How many risers do you have?
- Does the 7970 drop in hashrate when moved to a riser?
By trade I'm a network engineer in the education sector and every year I judge K-12 NOCTI and CIS projects, so seeing someone ask for help on this topic involving mining is pretty cool!

* One of our members mentioned using a RPi's GPIO pins to flip a relay and remotely restart their rigs.

* Or, you could host a web server on it that serves up rig statistics.

* Or use it to probe temperature statistics at the rig and configure an automated warning when it gets too high.

Good luck with your project and be sure to keep us updated with what you end up doing.

It's basically a test payment gateway so you can "test" credit cards without them having to actually send them to your processor.

I was only able to replicate it on mobile (not desktop), and it seems to be resolved now. I just didn't want someone to complete the checkout process on your guys and then you lose money by a sale being marked as "completed" when the funds were never charged.

After operating a drop-shipping firm for many years in the past, I wouldn't want it to happen to me. Hope it helps!
FYI - you should also disable the Test Payment Gateway in the BigCommerce settings

I have a Ubiquiti USG as my edge device, then my miners converge into a Cisco 2960x switch.

I've also used a Linksys Velop, Eero v3, Ubiquiti Amplifi, Fortigate 60D, and Fortigate 60E setups on the network edge without issue.

Are your miners wired or wireless?

So you could set up a batch file to do this and allow a task to run for so long before quitting, then opening another batch file...

But your earnings all won't be the same. You might earn more at 3pm than you do at 6am, and whoever is running at 6am is going to get the short end of the straw.

I got tired of paying $60 per month to cool the room it was in and knew that the solution was to pump air out in order to cycle new fresh air in.

I also knew that by volume, it would be much easier to pump a smaller volume of air out (128cuft tent vs 2800cuft room), which is why I decided to try the tent out.

It now costs me $4/mo to cool my rigs and they stay cooler than ever.

I was able to stuff about eight rigs in here before deciding to go ASIC.
Oh no worries - I didn't take it that way.

I'm always open to suggestions on how to better the community, but I won't try to implement a fix that might not work. Goal is to be open and transparent with the moderation here.

Impossible to know. Closing for speculation.
If you saw the automod queue, you'd be amazed how much you guys don't actually see.

It's difficult to get automod to catch everything too; all it takes is a character to be off, or post worded differently and it's not caught. Then balancing how strict automod is to filter posts is another story.

I'll often lock or remove low effort posts, but I'm not always here to take care of issues immediately as they arise.
I went to the Towson store and had zero issues with myself and two buddies buying a card each.

They made it clear that they wanted to save cards, and after chatting with one of the employees, they told me that management specifically wanted to save them because it helps them to **upsell custom built machines**, and was more profitable in that aspect.

It's not about the customer, it's about money. They figure that they will sell less custom PCs if the can't stuff graphics cards in them.

Impulse bought a Walther PPS M2 that my local shop had for sale.

I just let air flow in through the bottom flap; the intake fan does the rest.

Summer raised ambient temps a bit, but cards were still running about the same.

Can you link me to the exact board and show me somebody using it with that number of cards? I can throw it up in the wiki if so! :)
Yeah, unfortunately I've never used a Titan card first hand, so I don't have an answer to how it still works *to this day*, but a few posts from mid-December claimed mid-30s.

If anyone has one, fire it up and let us know!
Last that I've read was that the Titan Maxwells were still performing well, despite the 9xx cards going to shit.

I'd like to know refuting data if that is the case, however.
Thanks for the info.

I try to keep the wiki list of pools short and sweet, and will typically only add a pool if it is requested, or if I start to see a number of people jump on board.

Unfortunately, I can't comment on non-EN pools (about half of this list), as I don't know Chinese or Russian.

This is a good resource, so I welcome newcomers to read through this thread.
January 9th, 2018 was the last revision.

I don't mind adding new products, but I won't just randomly add ones that look like they might work without researching them, or finding someone who has them working. Hearsay causes more harm than good.
Depends on the generation. Maxwell cards get around ~35MH/s, Pascal is around 40Mh/s, I believe.

A 1070 is around 180w, whereas the Titan pulls 250w, making the Maxwell card less efficient than a 1070, and just about tying the Pascal card with the 1070.

But considering that a 1070 costs ~$700 used on eBay right now, that's not so bad.

Something isn't right, and this isn't the best blanket advice to just give people.

Here is my tent setup: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6Z36k5P3To

I have mine cooled by static air alone and two large box fans mounted to my racks; ambient tent in the room is 65^F and the temp inside the temp doesn't get past 85^F. Cards read ~55-60^C while hashing.

### Questions and suggestions:

 

1) **What CFM is that fan?**

 * I run a single 440 CFM 6" inline and have zero issues.

2) **Why did you not mount your fan inside the tent?**

 * Try this, you'll move more air.

3) **Where does your fan exhaust?**

 * If it's going in the same room, you'll be fighting against yourself.

4) Remove any bends you have.

 * The more turns your ducting makes, the harder it will be to push air out. You might not think this makes a difference, but by straightening my ducting, I lowered ambient temps by ~10^F

5) What's going on with your intake?

 * You're basically breathing through a straw if you're moving 6" of air and sucking in 4". I'm not sure if it's being conditioned or what, but that just seems odd.
Read the rules.

You're right. I'm not sure why I wasn't thinking about that.

Could very well be; but your PCIe ports ~~will~~ can draw a max of 75w despite being powered by the 6/8 pin.
* 12 cards
* Max draw of 75w to mobo per card
* 900w potential max draw

That'll do it.

Update your BIOS. If the option isn't available still, call Gigabyte and ask them about it. They'll tell you if the board supports it.

>	Crossfire/SLI is not required because the cards don't need to coordinate or exchange data at any high rate. They coordination is tiny and done via the mining software. You can have a bunch of cards of different specs and it should work fine.
Yes, you can use two 650w for a combined total of 1300w. Be sure to not overload a single PSU and evenly balance between them.
Take a look at this page on the wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/wiki/hardware/psu
I use the home depot racks. $20 for 8 cards (10 if you stretch it) with directional airflow is perfect for me.

You can get smaller tents. How many miners do you have and how are they set up?

I went from paying $60/mo to cool the room to $4-8 to run the fans.
I dump it outside via a dryer vent.
It's a hydroponics tent, and yes, I do this:

It's way more efficient to move air than try to repeatedly condition it
You need to hire a consultant who deals with this kind of stuff.

It sounds like you're trying to mix multiple kinds of infrastructure together that won't mesh well at the end. Nvidia recently prohibited use of its cards in data centers as well, so be sure to thoroughly research any kind of implementations.

Power consumption depends on what else you're running, 220 vs 110, cooling, etc. I'm a network engineer by trade and have consulted on numerous data center builds and mining ventures; it's never as easy as you think in this department.
Are you asking what hardware you need to reach that capacity?

A lot of people I know are moving towards [SMOS](https://simplemining.net/) or [HiveOS](https://hiveos.farm?ref=5798); both are free to try (SMOS is free for a few days, HiveOS is free for up to rigs and has a really nice dashboard), so if you keep having issues, maybe run a temporary boot on one of them to see how they compare?

I personally just stick to Windows for lack of complexity.

All,

MaxHash has refuted these claims in a post [located here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/7pky46/warning_predatory_mining_pool_going_around/dsiidjz/). Unless this thread gets out of hand, I see no reason in a civil open discussion about pools and mining fees.

That being said, it is the miner's responsibility to learn how pool fees affect them, as well as which type of payment systems are best. Just because one user views something as a scam, doesn't necessarily mean that there is or is not a problem.

 

^(I'm not defending either side, and have no "horse in the race" when it comes to this pool.)

 

Please do your due diligence when choosing to mine.

Thanks! I'm planning a trip to Ikea for a few shelving units and re-purposing an entire room for filming. You never really realize just how much effort needs to go into some of these videos until you're behind the camera.
Over 6 months since I started to use Insights exclusively and zero of my units have had similar issues.

Not saying that they never will, but in my experience, with quite a few units, they have held up fine.
Very welcome.

Thanks for the feedback!

I wouldn't have thought about matching those, but it's definitely a good idea to "blend" things like that together. I'm trying to find a good way to move towards a textured background, just haven't found the right thing in my home yet.

As for editing, I primarily use Premiere, however I have been seeing a lot pop up about Resolve (specifically because of the way it handles h.265 encoding), so I'll probably give that a try. Jim seems to do a great job with motion graphics and shots in general; I don't want to copy his style, but I envision something similar - maybe color grading is the right way to get there.

I tried to flush it out (albeit, I wearing headphones so that probably plays a bit into it) but I'll take that into account going forward.
I do a lot more tech-focused videos including product reviews - a *bit* different :)

Do you have a Facebook page that you post the videos to (aside from your personal one)? I've seen a lot of reviewers start to publish to their Facebook page so that the videos can be shared from within the Facebook platform rather than link out to YouTube.
What did you do to grow or advertise your videos? I'm growing about 1-2 subs per day, but I'm having trouble with is getting more views/subs on my videos and am not sure how else to push them without being spammy.

/u/sporkindustrial should probably pay up the offered bounty, to avoid being banned by the sub.
Having this same issue since last night (with gas at 50) and can't figure out how to move funds around. This is one of the most counter-intuitive exchanges I've used to date.

Hey /u/dumnzzz,

Did /u/sporkindustrial ever pay out the bounty he/she advertised?
I wonder if there are other settings that are optimal for OpenCL. You could certainly try it and let us know, but there are many variables which affect hashrate, including cards, driver versions, OC settings, and application parameters.
I personally use [**two EVGA SuperNOVA 650w G1 units**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/wiki/hardware/psu) per rig. These have enough connections out of the box to power six cards and molex risers safely at up to 1300w.
This is good advice, a lot of people don't think to just call the manufacturer and ask for more connectors.
Use Afterburner. XOC has that weird limitation (I prefer how it looks, but whatever).
As long as your cards are active and in device manager, just start mining.

Are you having problems that make you think otherwise?
Thanks for the sound advice.

I have Tower spun up for my Apache nodes and am working to trial out NGINX to load balance them prior to moving over from Citrix Netscaler. Unfortunately I'm also dealing with the requirements coming from upper management, so a new set of constraints have come into play.

Example currency?
Ethereum prices increased and a second wave of new miners bought in.
All good.

Think of a PSU as a wall. On one side of the wall, you have DC power which is used to supply converted electricity to the components of your PC. On the other side lives AC power (assuming you're in the US).

The PSU is rated in DC power, meaning that a 750w PSU will supply up to 750w of power on the DC side.

Next, you need to know the efficiency of the PSU. Efficiency measures the ability to convert power to DC from AC less loss due to parasitic and heat conditions. Let's say you have a gold PSU which is about 87% efficient; you would expect the PSU to pull up to 862w from the wall at full load (750w) on the DC side.

Does that help?
You're thinking too much into it.

That's even easier than my recommendation ^([I forgot screensavers even existed]), good catch.
After I automated everything, next to nothing as long as no problems arise.

If something does happen (miner stops mining, unit goes offline, hashrate dips below expected, etc...) I am notified and the proper action is taken automatically. If the notifications continue, there is an issue that needs to be manually addressed (rare). I check on my rigs for maybe 15-20 minutes out of the entire week. As of yesterday my shortest up time for a single unit was 100 days.

If you're just cashing out, it takes minutes to do. If you're trading, that's a whole different ballgame and can consume your life. I don't feel like it's appropriate to include that here.
Download this: https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/

Save this as "RunMiner.au3" and store it in the same folder as your miner. This should work natively with Claymore, but if you are using Genoil, replace *EthDcrMiner64.exe* with *Ethminer.exe*.

    #include <RunMiner.au3>
    While 1
       Sleep(10)
       $idleTimer = _Timer_GetIdleTime()
       If $idleTimer > 1800000 And Not ProcessExists("EthDcrMiner64.exe") Then
          Run("notepad.exe")
       ElseIf $idleTimer < 10 Then
          ProcessClose("EthDcrMiner64.exe")
       EndIf
    WEnd

To adjust the time idle, change the `1800000` value located at the line beginning with `If $idleTimer > 1800000`

Good to know! Just wanted to make sure.
Video footage was the only way, otherwise they were basically going to just deny the claim (they did and I had to reopen it).

They also mentioned that some markets have GPS units in trucks and if a driver is at the address, they will deny the claim.

The only way I can recommend to avoid this is to require a signature.
Except Vitalik has openly said that [1000 ETH will be required to stake initially](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6tj5d0/any_updates_on_ethereums_pos/dllfyd1/).

Sharding will **possibly** enable less to stake (the post specifically states "possible"), but I don't think that's even up for discussion at the moment.
Right, which is why I mentioned it was on the TestNet
> If you have 1500 ETH how much would POW generate for you?

Nothing, because PoW isn't based on staking.
This currently uses Claymore, fyi.
Do **you** collect a dev fee on top of Claymore, or have you replaced Claymore's dev fee with your address? Just trying to promote transparency here.
ccminer also has decent mods tailored to specific algos.

For example, the Alexis mod blows NIST algos out of the water, and SP gets around the same as Claymore. No dual mining though.
Minimum validator deposit is 1500 ETH

So at the time of writing, if the testnet alpha were to go live, a validator must stake $1,132,500 worth of ETH.

Ouch.
Just had to file a claim with FedEx that took over a month to complete.

Driver "delivered" the package, video footage proved otherwise. They denied it until I sent the footage via a YouTube link... which (according to the view counter) wasn't watched.
There are plenty of posts that have addressed this in the past. Here are the three accounting terms you should know:

* **Payback period**: The time it takes to pay back the cost of your risk (the miner).
* **Net Present Value**: Measurement of Risk over Return that factors in all risks (including the cost of capital [the miner], investments like electricity costs) final retuns over a finite period of time.
* **Return on Investment**: Actual return over a finite period of time.

I get that people are wrong, and it has been beaten to death time and time again. The people who are doing this as a hobby do not care. If it's a business doing this, they're probably not on this sub, or I've already scolded them for trying to use Reddit instead of a CPA. The rest just say it correctly.
[**AwesomeMiner**](http://www.awesomeminer.com/) maybe, depending on how many rigs you have.

I believe it has a graphic function, but I haven't used it in a few months and forget.
I interviewed one with a former employer and his skills were great... except they all revolved around technology that was developed and used only in India.

He knew a lot about GPON and WAN technologies (he came from a NOC), but was very limited on the engineering side of things. Anyway, apparently his former employer refused to use Cisco, HP, UBNT, or any other "standard" gear that I run across (hell, even Brocade). Instead, they used something that was manufactured in India and used pretty heavily by their ISPs. I wish I could remember the name of it, but I had no idea that the company even existed until I googled it and read more.

I know back in 2010, India banned Chinese networking equipment, so that could be a large reason behind the lack of use. Additionally, India has a very big push for "made in India" equipment, and heavily taxes companies who don't source <x>% of resources from India when manufacturing products sold there.
Last Christmas my wife and I came across this and bought it for her brother.

I was absolutely not ashamed to ask the frail old woman at the counter how much the calendar would cost.
I was thinking about going this route too, but boards were too expensive and didn't have enough ports.

Instead, I recommend grabbing one of the [**suggested power monitors from the wiki**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/wiki/hardware/powermonitor) (I use the WeMo Insight) and set your board's BIOS to automatically power-on in the event of a power loss situation. Then, the WeMo can take care of everything for you remotely.
That's what I'm getting at.
SMS and MMS are both archaic. I really wish that a singular messenge platform with end-to-end encryption would be widely adopted by key players in the mobile market space (looking at you, Google and Apple).

Problem is, Apple is set on using iMessage and Google is set on being open.

iMessage is great. I love using it and it's feature integration makes things a breeze to build apps into the platform. Now, you can use iMessage on desktop, as long as it's a Mac, but Android and Windows get zero support.

Android is its own worst nightmare. I loved Hangouts and tried to get all my friends to use it. Cross-baked to iOS, available as a browser client for Desktops, it was great! But Google didn't want to *force* a standard message client on devices and left it open... Needless to say, only a handful of my friends and colleagues actually used hangouts and the rest used regular old SMS.

This is one of the reasons that services like WhatsApp are thriving elsewhere, but I wish the U.S. population would get on board instead of using whatever is more convient without doing anything (stock messenger app) or flashy (whatever they download from the Play Store).

If developers were to set a time and miss it, it could potentially affect ETH's market share negatively, which is why you will only find speculation until a plan is in place.

**Do not coil your extension cord**

Super important, otherwise you drop your max amp draw and *will* start a fire more easily.

That being said, get a high amperage outdoor cable. There are a few good ones suggested in this thread.
Someone just did this over in /r/CryptoCurrency - take a look!

Thank you! To you and yours as well
I was considering doing something similar with my RPi and using GPIOs to trigger relays to turn on/off a set of inline fans.

https://m.imgur.com/a/hAKER

Would help to keep temps in check and lower the bill. It does add a layer of complexity for those with a touchy (temp sensitive) overclocking setup though.
Just don't activate it.
Before you do, give this a try:

1. Plug in cards one at a time until you get a black screen and can't boot.
2. Remove the card that gave you the black screen
3. Boot and install Windows **in UEFI mode** (ensure the BIOS is set to enable Win8/10 features)
4. Once Windows completes the install, reboot and enable 4G decoding
5. Try to boot into Windows, if it fails add a card and try to boot again
6. Once you boot in, let the drivers install and reboot. Confirm the card is recognized in devmgmt.msc (device manager)
7. Reboot and add each card one at a time like in step  6

You should also try a Linux-based OS like [SMOS](https://simplemining.net/) or [HiveOS](https://hiveos.farm?ref=5798)
Care to elaborate? I've set up probably for dozen of these rigs with zero issues.
Thank you for the giveaway.

Happy holidays to all, and good luck!

I'm not going to get into the debate of pricing relative to BTC or USD.

In my eyes, the cost of investment has risen which is why I'm seeking out alternatives.
I've heard this debated due to both cylinders having high EGTs due to the manifold design.

But #3 is the weak link (the one placed directly next to the turbo) due to the fueling system. Some people do the [parallel fuel rail mod](http://www.northursalia.com/modifications/drivetrain/fuelrail/fuelrail.html) to just feed extra fuel and prevent lean conditions.

I never heard of the clearance problems being the source of trouble with 2008-2009 EJ257s, but I still feel like this was relevant to OP's question. Same holds true to oiling issues, which I count as maintenance-related, and OP wants a car that he doesn't have to worry about.

I wouldn't call a turbo Subaru light maintenance, mainly because I wouldn't trust putting anything off. I've owned a few and have zero gripes with the reliability of the n/a cars, but 255/257s are heavy for sure.
I disagree.

Thin oil, oil starvation, low oil pressure (see a common trend here?), debris, etc... all can cause this problem. It's not *just* a clearance issue.

This isn't even mentioning the ringland problems that the EJ255 and EJ257 motors have, typically falling on cylinder 3 due to lean conditions.
2008 is the worst Year for the EJ257.

Due to repeat crank failures because of rod bearing failures, Subaru decided to treat the crank to a nitride coating to harden and protect it from grooves. Unfortunately, this also lead to - wait for it - more rod bearing issues.

I didn't know about this when I replaced my second EJ motor with one from an 08 STI with around 82,000 miles... It developed rod knock shortly after install. I'm not saying that all of the cars develop rod knock at 80k, but it was a common failure number.

If you're worried about maintenance, Subaru probably isn't the right choice. Horizontally opposed motors should probably get a little extra love, if anything.
It was removed. What was it?
Open up device manager and check to see if both devices are recognized.
Holy shit this thing is expensive. You could buy another Oculus at its retail price.

But my real question... is it worth it?
You can if you want, but if you're not providing services to any clients, you can likely file capital gains on your personal taxes.

As one of the posters mentioned above, business status can also affect deductions. You complicate it more as you add layers to it.

I'm not a CPA, but that's how I started.
I honestly don't get a lot of traffic through them, which I don't care about to be honest.

I've been thinking about another sub giveaway soon, just haven't had time to sit down and think about what fun way to do it.

Actually, I may do something based off that idea. Good call!
I wish I made a ton, would have really helped this holiday season!

So far, I haven't gotten to even cash out my mining since I started. Everything keeps going back into funding more and more equipment. Then when more equipment comes, more infrastructure needs to be upgraded to handle the power. It's a never ending cycle.
Literally exact same scenario. I'll be checking out the Avalon 821 whenever they launch, depending on the price. I'd prefer the S9, but this might just be a price gouging attempt before the S11 announcement.
Greed pushes everything unfortunately.

Yesterday, Antminer S9s were $1,400 from Bitmain. I was planning on buying ten units during the next ordering session. Today, they're $2725.

lol, pass.
Good bot
Hey, great job. Stories like these make modding this sub worth it.

I love reading when crypto does something good for people. I will constantly read about how mining isn't profitable, or how it's a waste of time. Just look back on the posts from a year or two ago when the same things were said. You do you.

I wish you and yours the best this holiday season.
In the past we've [allowed threads like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/6hmqpf/minerproxy_ethereum_stratum_proxy_dont_let/), so I won't openly recommend it or publicly endorse it. I will say that if it gets enough reports, it will be removed by automod.

I would also recommend ensuring that whatever you post be opensource, as a lot of people have issues running closed source apps on their PCs.
Stability, price, support, etc.  The z270 is proven to work in many scenarios and is one of the easiest boards to work with. The 110 works, but at upwards of $200 due to mining popularity, it doesn't make sense for a lot of people running 6 card rigs.
You left out an important part:

> Mass manufacturing of the 7nm chips will start in May of subsequent yr.

So, 2019.
Price. Imagine having to run fiber to every single household you cover. Fortunately ISPs have already done this for the most part, and new installs are the responsibility of the home or business owner.

Fiber strung on telephone poles can run about $20k per mile, and I don't even want to get into the cost of running underground.

Next, consider where these now have to terminate. A huge provider chassis switch is where everything ends up. Each 48-port line card might run $4,000-6,000, plus would require an SFP for the fiber ($100).

With an expected replacement life of five years, that brings your ISP's equipment cost to around $3.40 per user, per month.

That number is grossly over simplified, but I'd actually expect the number to be closer to around $7-8 per user each month before taking actual fiber line runs, employee costs, and other miscellaneous expenses.

None, because SLI and Crossfire don't affect your hashrate.

8GB RX580 is near your price range for best hash with a modded BIOS.
Do some pcaps if you can, I'd be interested in knowing if/where it's phoning home to.
I'm saying this for the people who simply don't know what they're getting into.

Most people don't know how to segment machines on their own VLAN (let's be honest, how many consumer-grade networking devices have support for VLANs or inter-VLAN routing?), or don't know the first thing about security. The mod queue gets several messages per week for people who have had their wallets hacked and think we provide support for that.

The whole industry may not be pumping out malicious devices - you're absolutely right about that, but there are a decent chunk of them floating around, and that's enough for me not to trust most end-users to recommend them.
Define "isolated".If you can route to it, it's not isolated.

Additionally, I would worry about becoming part of a botnet, or something mining on my hardware.

Problem is, most of these units are manufactured at the same place and sold off in bulk to resellers.
Another member found one they ordered riddled with malware. I suggest against this.
"You must minimize use to less than five servers"

> Two miners

Yes, argue with them. You have two computers, not "ten servers". If you would take this to court for arbitration, this would shoot them in the foot, as they openly admit that the unit can withstand the heat of "five servers".

Additionally, you're using the dryer duct, right? Ask how they expect you to dry your clothes.
Whatever works best. I prefer open, but it depends on your cooling scenario.

Also I have no problems buying a used Mobo, but finding one that supports what you need is difficult. Plus warranty concerns.
1. Plug in cards one at a time until you get a black screen and can't boot.
2. Remove the card that gave you the black screen
3. Boot and install Windows **in UEFI mode** (ensure the BIOS is set to enable Win8/10 features)
4. Once Windows completes the install, reboot and enable 4G decoding
5. Try to boot into Windows, if it fails add a card and try to boot again
6. Once you boot in, let the drivers install and reboot. Confirm the card is recognized in devmgmt.msc (device manager)
7. Reboot and add each card one at a time like in step 6.
You actually don't even have to do that. Most pools will just show it as a single miner like this.

But otherwise right!

There's a ton of suggestions, my choice being the ASUS z270-P.

It is a battery powered unit, but other than that it seems pretty quality.
~~There's a reason it's super cheap. I've never had that issue, but I can't say I'm surprised given it's 1/8th of the price.~~

Ignore me, I read it as **generic**.
Just why my bill was over 24 hours past due, lol.

1060s are what I recommend. Best price/power/hash ratio in my book, especially when using the modified ETHMiner (24/25 MH/s)

I outfit my rigs with 1070s - two EVGA 650w PSUs ([**linked in the wiki**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/wiki/)) take care of it with room to spare.
This is why we don't recommend cloud mining.

> I can only start in Feb, 2018. Will it be worth

Value is subjective, there will always be a coin that you can mine, but value is what you make of it.

> Should I go with dual mining or solo ETH mining?

Again, your choice. Coins like SC increase your electricity consumption and don't really affect hashrate that much. Only a few bucks a month unless you expect it to increase in value.

> 4. We are on PPL here in PA, anything I should ask them about power usage?

I'm in Harrisburg, they now call me the day I'm past due on my bill because my rate is that high, lol. Check your contract and just be sure that there is no tiered rates where you live.

Because American politics are corrupt in this aspect.

Ajit Pai is a former Verizon attorney who specifically handled regulatory and competition issues. Now, he's the head of the FCC and has openly disclosed his disdain for net neutrality.

In the past twenty five years, the "big three" (AT&T, Comcast, and Verizon) have collectively **"donated" $45,976,539 to politicians**. [Here is a list](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/11/16746230/net-neutrality-fcc-isp-congress-campaign-contribution) of those that accepted the funds, for those that care.

Now, ISPs are cashing in their favors and the constituents are going to be the ones to pay.

There are two ways for data to leave the US:

* Long haul under-sea fiber
* Satellite

Should the laws pass, it will become possible for ISPs to shape traffic going over its wires. Let's think about that:

1. Traffic leaves your company's datacenter via a Comcast connection.
2. Comcast hands off its traffic to a backbone provider like Level 3.
3. Level 3 now hands off the traffic to AT&T where it will ultimately terminate at the long-haul fiber going overseas.

From this, we see trickle-down cost to consumer. Level 3 pays AT&T to send certain traffic over its network. Comcast will pay the costs for both Level 3 and AT&T. You, the consumer, will pay the costs for Comcast, Level 3, and AT&T.

Want to access a US-hosted site from outside the US? No problem - but you're at the mercy of who wants to pay in order to send traffic to you, and how much they want to pay to prioritize their speeds.
Welcome to the copy/paste that is [all of Reddit posting the same thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepOurNetFree/comments/7j3vy4/heres_a_theme_that_any_subreddit_can_use_to/).

Anyway, this isn't about a nationality. The repeal of this bill will affect more than just Americans, but anyone in the world who uses an online service provided by an American business.

Reddit is an American company that, although hosted in AWS, could be subject to additional hosting fees from ISPs to reach end users. The laws being repealed also protect corporations from having to pay the piper (so to speak), and then protect the consumer from double dipping.

It might not seem like it affects you, but when sites like Reddit can no longer function in the black without hosting large amounts of ads or offering a subscription fee to pay for its increase in hosting costs, it will affect everyone.

You can choose to agree or disagree with the sub's stance on this, but after being asked to participate, we polled the sub and 78% of those who participated in the poll decided that /r/EtherMining would join this same movement for 24 hours.

Everything in life is a gamble, I just happened to get lucky. The first bit of Mona I bought, I was sitting in a car waiting for my wife and just happened to have some spare change on Bittrex. Mined it for a bit, made a huge return.

I had prior interaction with the devs in charge of BWK and mined it for a few days when I saw it came out.

These are just two successes where I made a decent amount, but there have been plenty of examples where it was just wasted time and efford.
They're all new coins. You'll wait for a minable coin to show up that looks promising (see my comment above) and mine it.

It's a calculated risk, some won't pay off.
Basically, you watch the new coin announcement forum like a hawk. Find a brand new project, read through any white papers (look for copy/pasting), research project stakeholders, etc.

Then mine the shit out of it before other people do.

Hope it takes off and then sell your large bags. You'll win some, and lose some.
You don't profit or lose until you sell.

I don't think BWK is on whattomine, but Mona definitely is after it shot up in value this last time around.
Step 1. Watch this forum: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=159.0

Step 2. Mine something immediately when it comes out

Step 3. Set crazy sell orders when it hits and exchange and let it go on on the third wave up
Bad editorial clickbait.

Mine whatever coin is profitable. I brought in $1300 from BWK in three days, $1800 from a week of mining Mona (and holding), etc. Those alone have paid for two rigs worth of 1070s.

Going to copy/paste my response from the [other thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/7i6n2a/ethereum_rig_not_working/dqwgpco/) because it is still relevant.

> if you pay for something , you can hope to get a support from the seller

Years of working in Enterprise IT tell me that this is not the case. You pay for a product, support is separate.

In the case of Claymore, you're not even paying for the product - you're working in a "freemium" model, that is, Claymore is free to download, free to distribute, but if you use it, you pay a commission in exchange for a higher hashrate and ability to dual-mine coins.

I read through the [BitcoinTalk thread](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1433925.0) and did not see any expressed agreement to provide support.

This subreddit is a community where those who enjoy mining are welcome to ask for assistance in getting up and running, discuss problems that they are having with mining, or discuss the current state of affairs regarding mining Ethereum.

**I don't use Claymore**, but I can help to troubleshoot an issue.
That's about right, at the expense of increased power. Everything comes down to how much you're willing to pay for the card, and what you consider to be an acceptable MH/watt ratio.
Per Ethermine.org 17 hours ago:

> We are currently experiencing degraded network performance with some of our EU servers.

and again 15 hours ago:

> Because of the problem we had to temporarily disable statistics generation and block distribution. We have now re-enabled both modules and all blocks are currently distributed.

That's awesome! I'm glad you were able to make use of it. My goal was to help people get up and running with minimal issues. I have actually just begun to update the wiki again with new and relevant information, hopefully it helps others.
You need to add more details if you want reliable answers.

1. What OS are you using?
2. What errors are you getting?
3. When was the last time you were able to mine successfully?
4. What has changed since then?
5. What pool are you mining to?
6. Upload your claymore config to pastebin and link it here.
That's not how that works and is rather condescending. Just because you pay to use a product, doesn't mean you pay for support.

I get that a lot of people don't like Claymore, and that's fine, but being hostile towards others because they need help is just rude.
They come, they go.

This is a cycle. If you saw my mod queue, you'd realize how much you're actually saved from having to deal with. Complaining helps nobody.
The reason you have no on-board video (on the motherboard) is because Ryzen doesn't have an APU.

If you're spending $3,000 on 9 cards, that's ~$330 per unit. The equivalent 1060 6GB can be found locally in the states for ~$260 -$300 and have a much higher resale and target market for when you're ready to get rid of them to upgrade/get out of mining/whatever. Always have an exit strategy.

Plus, the warranties for those are atrocious when you can get a 1-3 year (depending on manufacturer) for the same price or less per card.
I would personally never buy the "mining" cards. They have a shit warranty, no resale value (headless), and are basically just 1060s.
Did the BIOS reset after you pulled power? Check to make sure that 4G decoding is still enabled.
Ask a sub dedicated to Nicehash.
Regarding SLI, please see this section of the wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/wiki/hardware/gpu#wiki_crossfire_.2F_sli_bridging

> No performance gains in mining

You're also basically building a space heater. You will need to move the conditioned air away from the cards or they will just be constantly fighting the environment to cool themselves down. It doesn't work that well.
Read the first section of the Wiki and do a bit of research https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/wiki/index

This question gets asked *a lot* and the answer is simply: only you can decide. Some people will tell you to mine, others will tell you to buy crypto. I say: you need to figure that our for yourself.
Nicehash hit it hard. I was mining 130 coins per day for the first two days... Now it's 1 an hour lol.

I pointed 12 cards at it.
The first two (dcri/ethi) are good examples, but the other two are already covered there.
A lot.

Consistent full load (depending on the intensity) for the GPU. Best way to know your actual power consumption is to [use a power monitoring solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/wiki/hardware/powermonitor).
If disk usage goes to 100%, nothing else is connected, and you've reinstalled with the problem still recurring - sounds like an issue with the HDD.

I would do the following (one at a time):

1. Try a different plug on the PSU for the HDD
2. Replace the SATA cable from the HDD to the mobo
3. Try a different HDD

Yeah, I'm still salty about Sigt. The developers and drama ruined that project and I called them out on the sub and discord whenever I got the chance up until they day they abandoned it.

I mined a few hundred and am comfortably sitting on the rich list, so I'll hold it until the white paper release or third pump.

My goal isn't to tell you guys what to mine, I'm not in it to coin shill. But when I see a coin that gets a ridiculous amount of hashrate pushed to it (sitting at 1.6 TH/s this morning), I'll throw it out there.
Very cool! Great job.

Do you have plans to release the server-side code at all?

I don't mind sending telemetry data to off-site, but it would just be something I'd like to host in-house if possible for no reason other than I'm bored, like to tinker, and have an Apache cluster sitting around doing nothing important.
They're likely calling to make sure you know this is happening and aren't surprised by your next bill. Probably trying to tell you, "hey, do you know about this, or...?"

Honestly, it's none of their damn business, just like it's none of your ISP's business what you do (within the confines of the law) on your network. The demarcation point is your home, what happens after that should not matter to them.
Looks more like brakes locked up and the vehicle pulled that way.
For anyone wondering, this is caused by an old version of Polaris BIOS editor. Downloading a new version [like what OP linked below](https://github.com/IojkinKot/PolarisBiosEditor) fixes the problem.

First and foremost, You WILL still receive coins to old addresses if you send to it. But Coinbase does openly state that they change wallet addresses after transactions: https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/2276500

Here are users complaining about addresses changing:

You WILL still receive coins to old addresses, but Coinbase KB articles specifically prohibit the use of your account for mining rewards: https://support.coinbase.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2340440-how-do-i-receive-digital-currency-?b_id=13521

Though there is nothing in the ToS which explicitly prohibits this, I'm sure this can still be used as a loophole should an issue arise. I never said it was not possible, in fact the first words of your quote are me saying "You can". I don't care what anyone mines to, web wallet or desktop wallet, but denouncing risks due to personally beliefs and a false sense of security is the very same "bad advice" you claim is thrown around this sub.
Regarding risers powered by SATA...

# From the [**Wiki**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/wiki/hardware/risers):

General rule of thumb is to convert the least number of times as possible to avoid poor quality components. It is also important to understand power draw versus the standard of the connector which you are planning on using. Your video card will pull up to 75w from the PCI-e slot itself, then require the remainder be sent from the PSU rail directly.

* 6-pin PCI-e Power cable is rated for 75 watts/13 amps, the same amount given by the PCI-e lane on the motherboard.
* Molex is rated for 132 watts/11 amps.
* SATA is rated for 54 watts/4.5 amps. - **Do not convert from SATA to Molex/6-pin**, this will cause an overdraw and could result in a fire.

----

In a PM, I also mentioned to remember that electricity is lazy. This means that if, for some reason, it believes that the easiest path is through one SATA > * adapter, it will take it and create an unstable scenario that might overdraw and melt something.

Check if you have both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. If you only have an IPv6, disable it on your router (if possible) and mine a bit.

Otherwise you'll need to contact Ethermine.org and ask why they're not with the times.
If you have zero experience I would say that it will be a learning curve.

Use whatever OS you're comfortable with for an easier setup for experience.
Service 👏🏻 level 👏🏻 agreements 👏🏻

How the government failed to impose these in the initial agreement is beyond me. Likely lobbying.
Network engineer here - it's costly but doable and will ultimately require somebody somewhere to pay to connect to a big ISP so you can out to the rest of the internet to do your Googling and Amazon shopping.

Talk to your municipality government leaders and bring industry professionals with you to help explain how THEY are getting scammed and how, with a some help from the town, this can save residents thousands of dollars over (many) years.

There have been examples of this succeeding and small towns building their own regional WAN to stop big internet.
If you're running Linux, 4GB is fine.

For reference, when I started I has two identical rigs, one of which had 4GB of RAM and a 60GB SSD, the other with a 120GB SSD and 8GB of RAM.

Both called the same config and executable from the same network share, but the lesser-spec'd one would randomly display "out of memory" errors in Claymore until I increased the system page file to 16GB and filled nearly the entire SSD.

You'll probably be fine, but just keep my scenario in mind.

I'm very hesitant to do this due to pressure from the team at GPUShack in the past. See this thread:

https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/6wrbbw/regarding_links_to_ethos_distros_read/

Should it be GPUShack's responsibility to protect their source code if it's close source? Yes. Link obfscucation is *not* a form of security. But I won't "poke the bear" on that topic much more.

Now, I don't wish to compromise the integrity of this sub, nor do I want the sub to be removed from Reddit over piracy concerns, so I've generally left it to a "if it's reported before I catch it, I remove" model.

That being said, I will not remove discussions on this topic as a whole. It's important to have a discussion about and properly sort out.

The fact is, though I believe in open and free software, I am not an expert on the GPL license and can't accurately enforce it. I reached out to GNU back in late July/Early August and did not receive a response.

I urge anyone who does get a response to please have the proper parties from GNU reach out to me. Please PM me if this is the case for my email address.

This has been asked a few times and every single time I recommend it if you understand the costs involved.

Solar is a very complex industry that has been falling in price, and I love it! If you live in the U.S., you may want to buy in before the tariffs are placed on Chinese panels and the solar credit is revoked.

Now, that being said, solar is an investment. You need to first decide if you're running on a proper grid tie-in system, or if you plan on using an off-grid storage system (think Tesla PowerWall or bunch of car batteries for DIY-goodness). If a grid-tie system is that you're aiming for, check with your electric company for what reimbursement is for electricity sent back to the grid from solar. It's not always 1:1.

Additionally, if doing grid-tie, you'll need a proper shut-off to avoid sending power back to the grid when the grid power turns off (per UL 1741), an inverter like the Sunny Boy 10000 will take care of this.

Lastly, be sure to calculate your needs properly. Account for ~20% panel loss through inversion and understand that the investment may take a few years to pay itself off.

Check out /r/Solar for more information.

I'm honestly not sure, but that's the only correlation I could find between people saying that there was a discrepancy of the number of cards they could pop in before needing to flip the switch.

1060s are best bang for buck when it comes to price/hash rate/electricity consumption. Any future rigs I build will be 6GB 1060s.
Depends on the amount of VRAM. For 1070s (8GB VRAM), it was at 4 cards for me.
I've used them before when they were running the promo for a free .035 in BTC if you signed up... this is back when BTC was at ~$600.

Sure wish I didn't spend it on a copy of Grand Theft Auto or some bullshit.

Anyway, yes, they are legitimate, but be aware that shipping may be slow and support is kind of lax.
Yep, I have zero issues with these. In fact, it's literally the only board I run in my cookie-cutter rigs.

It's a matter of knowing when to turn on 4G decoding.
You need to move air out of the space, otherwise it will heat the area and the rig will ultimately end up fighting against it to cool.

Whether that be an exhaust fan, or even one of those little [in-window fans](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Window_Fan_2.jpg), something will need to vent.

I live in a typical suburb neighborhood with houses built in the '60s - aka they all look the same and have a brick fascia.

I have a front door and rear door that leads to a screened porch, both of which have cameras at them. No side doors.

Package was left at the front door per the delivery ticket however despite the camera showing no delivery, I still checked around the house. It was absolutely not delivered.
No, I confirmed that it was correct with FedEx.

Not sure, but there were quite a few families that passed through during our stay. Home births and lack of modern meds seem to complicate Amish births a lot.
It's purely decorative now. I live in the capital of Pennsylvania (about an hour from Amish cities both North and East of me) and we recently had a well known barn ("the star barn") demolished in Middletown, PA.

Yes, that's the same town that had the faux nuclear meltdown at Three Mile Island.

Anyway, I've also had people mention that it was used by early settlers to set their barns apart from the Amish who denounced flashy things, including colors on their clothes and decor in their homes.

Nowadays, they make a tax-free killing by operating businesses on compounds and selling mass-produced wicker and rural looking furniture.

My daughter spent two months in the NICU when she was born and there were always Amish there.  They spoke in Dutch and would not socialize outside of their circle when waiting for doctors or anything. Time to pay their bills? Cash. Huge wads of cash.

~~Do we have an actual number now? That's all very speculative and hopefully lol~~

LOL 0.2MH/S

I was very, very hopeful and wrong.
The 1070 TI uses more CUDA cores at a higher clock, plus GDDR5 (as opposed the the less efficient GDDR5X in the 1080 family) clocked higher out of the box. Judging by what we know (I assembled the below table) I'm guessing that we'll see around 18-21% higher efficiency over the 1070.

~~**A fair estimation is likely 31 MH/s out of the box and 38 MH/s OC'd**~~

Again, these are just estimations and we aren't sure what numbers will actually be until early next week. Interesting to see how accurate these predictions are (I'm likely being overzealous).

Edit: lol first review is in. 0.2 MH/s gain. Wowwww

The summer between my sophomore and senior year of high school was great. I was hanging out with the kids who just graduated and had fuck all to do. The perfect storm.

One night, we were hanging out at this run down pizza joint we found a few weeks earlier that was open bar hours (food until 2 am). I rode passenger in one car and another kid that I had met only a few times also drove to meet us there.

The car I drove with had to leave and the new kid offered to drive anyone who wanted to stay home. Nobody obliged, even though I considered it and was comfortable enough to say yes, declined.

On the way home, he veered off the road and ran into a metal pole at a rail road crossing and completely destroyed the passenger side of his car. His hip was fractured and I believe he spent a week in the hospital.

I would have been killed, there was no surviving that crash as a passenger. One of those surreal things that you look back at and value the impact of the smallest decisions you make.
Do it! I duct mine back into my return air.

Yes, users on different VLANs. My current thought is that users are flopping between wired and wireless (even though wired has a lower cost metric assigned to it) and registers the authentication with that address. Because DNS can't fall off fast enough, it's causing the problem.
Yep. If you can stuff enough of 'em on a board. [I've been saying it for months](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/6u7zga/comment/dlqpikp).

1070 will likely hold resale better and are a generally better multi-purpoae card. That's about it.
Nope. I'm thinking DNS is still the underlying issue moving between DHCP scopes, but can't pinpoint how to fix it.
This is because of the memory type. The 1080 has GDDR5X whereas the 1070 has GDDR5. The GDDR5X cards have higher clock and memory speeds, however the timing straps are looser on GDDR5X, which causes it to be less efficient on mining.

The 1070 TI uses more CUDA cores at a higher clock, plus GDDR5 clocked higher out of the box. Judging by what we know (I assembled the below table) I'm guessing that we'll see around 18-21% higher efficiency over the 1070.

When a miner switches algorithms, it will need to generate the DAG to hash. This process takes twenty or so seconds with six or more cards.

I like the cut of your jib, guy.

Put me down for 300.
This sub is specifically about mining crypto. You can learn the basics of that in our wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/wiki/
How much do you plan on spending on the rig? My guess is ~$3000 based on the MH/s. Right now, that will net you 10 ETH. If the value raises to $500 in 6 months, that's a $2k net. If in 6 months you mine 5.5 coins, less the $3000 you spent, that's -$250, plus your losses in electricity.

I personally mine ETH while it's substantially profitable, then drop into alts.
That depends, do you expect price to increase? Can you wait 6-8 months to break even?

If so, mine away. This question gets asked a lot and even a year ago people went on about it not being worth it anymore. Well, look at us now. Make an educated judgement call.
This question has been asked time and time again. Regardless, there is never enough information to make a solid choice.

* How many are you buying?
* What's your budget?
* What currency are you mining?
Registration and inspection are two different processes in America.

* Registration is the process of claiming ownership of the vehicle. Most states require you to renew your registration once every year to keep the car's license plate associated with the car and the owner.

* Inspection comes in two flavors: safety and emissions. Safety inspection ensures that a car passes state safety requirements (in sound condition to operate on the roads). Some states require this to be done annually, others biannually, and some only when you buy the vehicle. Emissions can be dependent on counties within a state and may or may not be required.

Airpods will default to the first name of the owner + "'s Airpods".

4G decoding changes the mapped addressing space from x86 (32-bit) to 64-bit so that I/O resources can utilize more than 4GB of system memory.

USD? Not many people.

The biggest factor is making sure that the mobo you select has the option for "Above 4G decoding" **when you start throwing more than 3 cards at it**.

A lot of "cheaper", non-mining boards don't support this and aren't usable. When I first started out, I bought one or two without this option.

Oh.

Anyway, yeah, these numbers are pretty inaccurate.
Break-even does not proportionately follow an S-Curve based on the amount of hardware you have. Right now, the time to get your money back is about a year, unless price moves up substantially. When Byzantium goes live, this should drop to 8-ish months, but then climb as difficulty once again makes its way up.
This has been answered in this sub several times. Please give a search.
The 2008 was one of the *worst* years for the EJ255/EJ257 motors. 

It was the introduction of the forced crankshaft - which is great! Especially considering that the turbo EJ motors are absolutely notorious for spun rod bearings (I had two go on me), the harder crank meant that it was less likely to cause damage to the internals when that happened.

And that's when you realize that they didn't actually change the road bearings. So you've got soft bearings against a harder crank - what do you think happens? Around 80k miles, the bearings tend to spin.

Just be aware that it is a problem, and be sure to change oil often and inspect for metal shavings. A magnetic drain plug is also a great idea.
This is a tough topic and pushes for reason of regulation.

In my opinion, the lesser loophole is to tax when the currency is mined and "confirmed" or awarded by the pool. This should also burden pool owners by requiring an accessible report of time/date when something was mined.

Now here's another tricky part. One exchange might be trading at $350, while another is trading at $365 - who is to say which is centralized? If I record it at $365 and then sell it at $350, I'm in the red and have taken a net loss, despite profiting anyway.
They still advertise as having Vardiff here: https://www.alpereum.ch/join-pool/

However there is an update here that says differently: https://www.alpereum.ch/updates/

When creating these charts, we reached out to pools and/or used whatever information we could readily find online. Unfortunately, conflicting or outdated information can often lead to exactly what has happened here.
You're right, this was a mixup between a communication we had with Nanopool and Dwarfpool and was not updated here.
Last I read, they had previously. /u/etherchain can chime in on this.
Being in IT, I always wondered where the default Cisco hold music came from.

[Here's the answer](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/the-strange-story-of-ciscos-sort-of-beloved-hold-music/283262/)

### It's lit.
You have at least another 10 months of mining
Just complain and send it up the ladder.

It is for PC, thank you for that info!
Also recommended in those threads: just call them.

100% is a good way to burn your fans out.

A better idea is to do 1:1 (50^c = 50% fan, 60^c = 60% fan, 70^c = 70% fan, etc) if your cards can handle the reduced air flow. Also set a power limit if you haven't already.
Yep, any sort of induction of negative pressure in that room will be better than allow it to be stationary. Let me know if this helps!
You linked to the creator's studio (https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=B775Chzxxqw), which isn't accessible to people. Links should have "watch?v=", not "edit?o=U&video_id=".
Yep, this is the answer. Remember that your power source *must* support something like this. Chances are, each rig is pulling ~8-12 amps (depending on power draw), so overloading a single 20A circuit is easy. Fortunately, enterprise PDUs also come in 220v, so a high-amp 220v circuit could easily be your answer to this.

Or, it might be cheaper to buy 5 WeMos ($175 for mini, $225 for Insight) than to buy a breaker, install 220, hire an electrician, buy an enterprise-grade PDU, etc.
I will never not post it whenever I get a chance lol
Bad link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B775Chzxxqw

Anyway, the problem is that you're just moving heat away from the rigs and increasing ambient temps. The rigs are fighting themselves after the room gets up to temp.

You want to move the air outside. My solution was to [**use hydroponics tents**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/6vv1nm/i_decided_to_cool_a_few_of_my_miners_using_a/). I was able to use two three-tier racks and squeeze in four rigs per 48x48 tent (though if I wanted to, I could probabl squeeze in 6 if I moved the cards closer together). This maintains GPU temps in mid-60^c temps.
I have the same complaint. My G430 sounds worlds better.
Meanwhile other UTMs are able to accomplish this without such a problem. Have you tried using RADIUS events to accomplish this?

Thinking about exploring RADIUS-assigned VLANs if all else fails.
# What is this?

We've had the request for a quick-response area for members to get quick answers on common issues, but a sticky wasn't the best place for it (despite the [**FAQs in the Wiki**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/wiki/))

# How do I join?

Go here: http://discord.gg/XMSvATj

# What can be discussed here?

Pretty much anything related (or unrelated) to mining. We're also looking to establish a PnD-esque group to keep an eye on which coins are beginning to trend and worth mining. **Traders are also welcomed** and encouraged to participate in the trading channel.

# Why Discord?

It's a common platform that many in the community already use more than Slack or Telegram.

# We're looking for mods.

With a more active community, we're in need of some mods to keep things active and moderated. I've been doing my best, but it's a difficult task for one man alone.

* Mods should be established in this community (Reddit history will be checked)
* Prior moderation experience is preferred
* Mods of the sub will also be asked to moderate Discord

Interested? **[PM me here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Robbbbbbbbb&subject=Moderation%20Application)**
> override by a service/admin account doing something, generating logon event

I have a select few service accounts on the "ignore" list. Fortianalyzer is just showing a blank user. Is it possible that, even though the user is ignored, a different account is generating an event?

> override by RDP generating logon event on BOTH source-PC and the destination server (this can surprise people)

Shouldn't be due to the amount of users getting the issue. This is in a school where they use an app that utilizes remote-viewing of student machines, *but* (again) no alternate user is shown connected to that IP, just a blank space.

> DNS - Check if the PC's DNS entry is correct

Yep. I had this issue and thought it was scavenging, so I locked everything down pretty tight.
CPU-based coin, and only with credits. Plus, it's against ToS.
Yep. People ask my why I recommended specific ones in the wiki, despite them being less efficient - because they're safe. They might have four on a string, but you can run two PSUs and safely power two risers per string.

This was one of the hardest tasks of finding a good mining PSU when I started.
> =D

( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
For me, it was the lack of professionalism.

* The answer to anybody questioning where development was is to "go on Discord", where it was a troll box 99% of the time (not that I didn't contribute to it)
* Threats and lack of composure by the lead dev team when something would go wrong (threats of lawsuits, flaunting of money or past involvement with government institutions)
* Lack of *actual* news, but any response to claims attacking the coin or those involved was immediate and not well thought out
* Criticism of feedback
* Lots and lots of drama

I met a lot of great people when mining this coin, so the only thing I lost was electricity. Upsetting to see it begin to fizzle out.
Could maybe do coinhive and open a bunch of tabs lol
I bought Moon on release day and didn't finish it because I wasn't a fan of the art :(

I really miss 2D/top-down style Pokemon.
Glad you got the issue taken care of. My G933 problems were much more annoying to deal with, especially with a month of no contact.

Nope. Logitech support blows the big one.

https://www.reddit.com/r/LogitechG/comments/72nssu/logitech_you_have_to_get_your_email_support/

Best of luck.
This gets asked often. It's against ToS, but yes you can. Like others have said, a CPU-based coin (like Monero) is a better option.

Let me know your results.

I'd be interested in doing something like this state-side.
Any time. Glad you were able to get set up and going.

Knowledge-sharing is very important, no matter the industry and I my hope with the guide was just that. We have some pretty baller members here that are able to help with whatever problems you find yourself running into, so if you get confused at any point feel free to ask away!
This is cool!

I'm glad you can give useful information like this to the community. Thanks for contributing.
I'll take a gander - will likely have to get accustomed to the system and write up a guide for users.

^(I could have very well missed your PMs with the amount of messages I get)
No.

VRAM makes it impossible and computing power is too low to be efficient.
Everyone was blaming the miners for dumping and causing no rise in price, but lol. I think this shows differently.
Incremental.

40* = 40%, 50* = 50%, etc...

Actually kind of neat. Well organized and aesthetically pleasing. Great job!

Hope it doesn't throw off too much heat for you!
https://www.reddit.com/r/ethermining/wiki
You'd have to seek this information from pools, which is unlikely to be provided.

It's not something published on the blockchain, nor is it supplied by the pools because it's typically what they use as a security feature to lock one's account until they can verify originating IP.
Factor in difficulty changes, equipment failure, etc. You're looking at 2-2.5 yr break-even at minimum from mining ETH alone.

Nothing ever goes as planned.
Can't just blame the "cheap PSU". Need more details to determine a possible cause for this.

* What PSU?
* What was plugged into this cable?
    * How many devices were chained off of this cable?
    * What kind of adapters were between this cable and the device it was plugged into?
    * Was the device over-drawing power?

Posts like this can easily just spread FUD.

Well if you like them I guess that's what matters.

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Yes they are. I'm guessing their FAQs haven't been updated in quite some time.
Ethereum has a built-in bomb called the 'ice age'. As it freezes, it becomes less profitable to mine. This was meant to force the devs into hurrying along PoS, but obviously it didn't happen in time.

So, the fork will reduce the time it takes to solve a block while cutting the reward from 5 ETH to 3 ETH, while still maintaining a 20-25% profit increases (from today's earnings, so: **not much**).
Right now, $280k can get you 875 ETH. This setup would take around ~2.5 years at current rates to mine the same amount.

Logic:

730 per year at current rates while consuming 225 ETH at current rates for electricity, factor in equipment failure and difficulty changes (*1.5)

Not saying that there aren't other much more profitable coins (there are, plus potential shitcoins), but that's way too long of a break-even for me, and also impossible with ETH alone.

Happy cake day.

For Nvidia, that's honestly not too bad. 6x 1070s is around ~$2,800. Plus those racks are expensive. All-in-all, he's probably charing what you could do this for with new hardware, just pre-assembled, which saves on labor.

Playing devil's advocate, but I certainly wouldn't pay that.

This is a good idea! Basically Doge, but not for meme reasons.

# Chrome limits your CPU usage to 1% per core, per tab.

Would you rather your grandparents get ads (that they don't know how to block), or use 1% of their CPU to temporarily mine cryptocurrency? I know which I'd choose.
Light mining isn't a huge deal, honestly. Worried about "premature wear" on a solid-state system is pointless, IMO. Additionally,

# Chrome limits your CPU usage to 1% per core, per tab.

It's really not as invasive as one might think. So as long as you're not hoarding tabs, you should be fine. Would much rather have this than potentially malicious ads on user machines.
Market price tanks and stringent market regulation would be my guess.
Depends how you play on cooling the space the GPUs reside in. I have them installed like this on my single rig wire racks, but I vent their enclosure from the top.

Added this to the FAQs: https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/wiki/faqs/main
Hey all,

We did this for a few months in the past and had mixed results. Some lodged complaints that it was too frequent (daily), others that it was too infrequent (every other day, then weekly, then biweekly).

At this time, the solution which has been asked about again and again is a "state of mining" thread to discuss the changes surrounding ETH and the mining community, whether that be what coin to mine, how Metropolis will affect earnings, etc.

Feedback is always welcomed.

They need a more stringent filtering policy for stuff like this. Often, it's difficult because phishers will create a templated site that appears legitimate during reviews processes and then blasts the fake site out.
Because people are people.

They can make mistakes or simply be ignorant. That still doesn't excuse this from being a valid, and effective, phishing technique.

Yeah, this. Everyone is afraid to flash their own BIOS but have no problem trying to load a random one they found on the internet with the same chance of it bricking their card.
I've been on both discords since the first week. imo there needs to be more control and tongue-in-cheek moments by those involved, despite is being a community-driven project.

The lead dev also gave his coins away, which is a nobel gesture, but also in itself is concerning because now they have no stake in it.

I wish it the best, because I still have a decent bag of them too haha. Will likely stake and forget about it for a few months.
I was an early miner of Sigt and can't believe the amount of drama surrounding that coin now. Jeez.
We demoed it and I personally did not like it.

No flexibility, just a glorified wiki. If we didn't like the way it did something, the answer of the rep was borderline "you're just using it wrong".
What processor? This is likely due to the reporting and WMI polling that afterburner does to show you info on the dashboard. The more cards, the worse it gets.

I have a Pentium in one machine and a Celeron in another, and you can tell the difference between those two.
Ah, [epoch time](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), the moment the Unixverse began.
When enabled, your motherboard has a specific "path" mapped to 64-bit memory. In order to make the necessary memory reservations for your graphics cards (and other PCIe devices), your motherboard has to be "told" to change the mapping.
This has to be a bad rep. Our reps are honestly so great at getting back to us about stuff. If something breaks, they typically send out an engineer and rep at no cost to us.

I left some feedback for Apple regarding this.

https://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html

> Toggling Bluetooth or Wifi from Control Center simply disconnects from a given device and does not actually turning off the radio itself in Settings.app. This is counterintuitive and leads users to believe a false sense of operability while causing the facade of a battery drain issue. Please relink these controls.
That's for doing this. My 933 is having the mute problem and I've been fighting to get a response since 8/28.
Created a ticket for my mic not muting/unmuting with my 933 back on 8/28. After no response, I emailed them again and finally someone responded on 9/11 with a generic reply. No responses to any emails since then.

Before then, I fought with them about an issue on my G910 only to tell me it was working as intended. Six months later, in the release notes for the GSuite software, was the mention of my issue being resolved - despite telling me i was wrong.

Honestly the worst support I've dealt with for any company and I work in corporate IT, so I've gotten the worst of the bunch (or so I thought)

As for SSDs, the cheapest you can find. A lot of people will say to get 60GB drives, but just remember that you may also need a 16GB page file (Windows), so that's cutting it close.

I personally chose the z270-P.
Nada, any sort of enterprise wireless is a no-go. I actually didn't even know that the Watch had wireless built in my first day using it until I got home, I thought it just piggy-backed off of the phone's Bluetooth alone.

Wireless settings are pushed from the tethered iOS device.
I activated "Lost Mode", but no luck. Also hasn't shown up on Find My iPhone. Oh well :(
I took it off to use the bathroom at work and got called away for an emergency. When I returned it was gone.
I feel like both of those things are user preference.

I have both turned off as I was getting too many false positive wake ups throughout the day. Does wrist detection need to be on for the one-time passcode?
I've just have the passcode turned off completely for months, this is the first time I'm revisiting the issue.
That's not the experience I've had with it. Is this controlled by a setting?
If I'm using my watch, chances are it's because I don't have my phone in hand. Entering a passcode each time can be annoying.
9 of 'em - you got it!

A lot of people use the Add2PSU for a cleaner way to do it, also to expand past 2 PSUs if using low wattage units.

I honestly use a switch for mine, however these jumpers will work just fine because common DC power ground. It's whatever you prefer.

Hey man, thanks! I went ahead and joined the channel this morning. Will take a listen, as that's *exactly* what I'm looking for.
1060s are still the best hash to kWh for ETH, at least imo.
The way the guide is worded is intended to make you question yourself. Kids were jumping in and spending their life's savings on rigs during the initial mining craze for ETH, and then losing it all because they didn't know what they were getting into.

We're all doing it for the money, it's just the way we prioritize it that differs.
I flip through the threads here and there. I wish it wasn't full of low effort posts or constant bickering. Makes researching anything difficult.
I wish Memecoin [wasn't a letdown](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/memecoin/).
To be fair, I wrote the wiki linked on the sidebar lol. I don't know everything, it's just upsetting to see the community treat anyone that the perceive as new or inexperienced like this.

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
When you set up the WeMo, you are asked to join a network on each device. I haven't tried it, but I'm fairly certain that it'll support different subnets.

I can try this later since I broadcast a few SSIDs for my labs at home.
The line about the dev and code is fud that will cause sell offs.

Completely irresponsible for the exchange to put the coin on blast like that.
This is more a limitation of your electrical supply.

100A service can handle ~3-4 miners with typical use. 200A can do closer to 10.
As others have mentioned, hydroponics tents work very well. This is exactly what I do and it keeps my rigs nice and cool. I recently moved up from two test units to four and temps have not really moved.

I can fit about eight rigs in if I use two triple tier shelves, so ~48-64 cards depending on how many cards per rig.

https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/6vv1nm/i_decided_to_cool_a_few_of_my_miners_using_a/
IMO you can't compare future growth to historical data. Nobody can be 100% sure on what price will do, however I predict a rise due to PoS transition (much like everyone else).

You can also mine alt coins, something which I have been doing, and trading to ETH.
I still think this is the way to go: https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/6vv1nm/i_decided_to_cool_a_few_of_my_miners_using_a/

My cost for Oracal 651 WITH transfer tape is $0.005/sqin

So I'm guessing this is about $0.00125 or less.
I used to have both a case and screen protector.

Removed the latter because nothing on the market fit well enough. Then removed the case too, because it made the watch feel bulky.

I'll admit I was worried that I would scratch things, but after months of slamming it into things, everything is still fine.
I believe I read that they just sold off ethOS, not sure if GPUShack (the business) was also involved in that.
Going to remove this because it's not relevant to our sub's goal (mining), but to answer your question, one of the most common ways to buy BTC is through [**CoinBase**](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5594a46d6238622379000049). Make sure you pay with your card and not your bank, as the bank transfer can take up to a week to process.

From the [**Wiki**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/wiki/wallets/typesofwallets)

Type | Use Case
---|---|
Exchange|Your currency sits on an exchange like [BTC-e](https://btc-e.com/), [Coinbase*](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5594a46d6238622379000049), [Kraken](http://kraken.com), or [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/). It is generally not recommended to leave currency on an exchange if you are not trading.

**Recommended** option is to use a desktop wallet like [Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases) and backup your private key for offline storage in *at least two places*. The golden rule is if your data doesn't exist in two places (flash drive + paper), it doesn't exist at all. [Here is a simple video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6lE0Ctaeqs) showing how to set up Mist.

Other than being fairly insecure, Exchanges may generate new addresses that you are mining to. Might not seem like a huge deal, but then you're mining to a non-existent address and can't get your coins unless you change your payout address (and hope your auto-deposit doesn't trigger before you get a chance to).
That's actually cheaper than I was expecting for NEY. Neat.
It did on the keynote. The same with the controls of that AR game.
ERC-20 tokens reside on the Ethereum network and can be stored/viewed on MyEtherWallet.

So far, I'm supplying around 1.5 TB per node which was trading at around 20k satoshi per StorjCoin last month ($0.80 USD at the time). I haven't received a payout but I'm expecting about $10 per rig. It's experimental for now, so we'll see how it goes when the payouts disperse.
I stopped mining Sigt after the second halving and the dev complications. I hold a nice bag of them, but unless the coin shoots up in price... Meh. Not worth starting now unless you have hopes of the project bringing in > $.80 IMO.

A lot of people swear by Monero, but they're also staking future potential in that. Not a bad choice, but again, investing in what *could* be.

Zec is a fair good choice. PoW, comparable to ETH, and frankly takes less of a hit on swings than ETH's wild ride - but that's not much fun :)
DCR is the most common right now I'd have to say.

Sia isn't much. I was bringing in around ~1400 SC/Mo on each rig, which (right now at $0.006) is around $8. At its peak of $0.02/SC it would be worth $28.

I also host a Storj node on my machine, and if you pick a decent CPU minable coin, you start to use everything you can on the rig.
The WeMo Insight let's you do that remotely: https://imgur.com/a/rtk3R
Unless I want to change what coins I'm mining, I leave it alone. So very rarely.

First and foremost, get yourself set up with [TeamViewer](http://teamviewer.com) to allow for remote access to the machine.

But understand that this still might leave you with an inaccessible rig if it crashes and become unresponsive. So, because of that, at minimum, I would get a [**WeMo Insight**](http://amzn.to/2sSC6Ol) or [**WeMo Mini**](http://amzn.to/2tUjrl2) (the former will tell you power consumption while the latter will not).

I wrote up a guide on [**how to automate this**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/6m4b77/how_to_automate_the_reboot_of_an_unresponsive/), but you will need to make sure that your rig's BIOS is set to automatically power on in the result of power loss.
I think they didn't want an "S" on the 10th anniversary of the iPhone.
Someone stole my Series 1 last week, so I will be, unfortunately.
Fairly certain it's just white. In fact, it's $20 cheaper than the current remote.
I was playing with my phone today to see how it felt to bring my thumb to the bottom of the phone, and it wasn't exactly comfortable.
Connect one at a time. If it's your 4th/5th card, you probably need to install the OS and THEN enable above 4G decoding.
Yep, exactly. Then we need to fear the app simply not being usable if it detects that you're using an X and the permission isn't enabled. Facebook is already good at picking people out of 2D photos, I'm sure it would have a field day with 3D. Also I **hate** the Facebook camera itself. I swipe into it by accident at least 5+ times per day ^(and now it takes two swipes to get out of it)

Shitty, but I wouldn't put it past some of the more malicious developers out there.
Agreed. This indicates that it will be available for developers to utilize. I'm willing to bet it's not *intended* for ads, but will probably be used for it at some point.
These should hit US shores soon. Alibaba has 'em up for $5/ea @ 200ct minimum quantity. But I like that this gives options. Will probably pick some up if/when some of mine go (not that I want them to).

**The less adapters you use, the better**
I personally don't upgrade to the "S" iterations, but often find myself buying the major releases for added functionality. The loss of Touch ID is making me contemplate making the jump to the "iPhone X" though... it worked so well.
Not for me :(
Stuffed 24x cards in and was able to cool with a single 440cfm. But make sure you allow fresh air in, otherwise the cards can't inhale fast enough and temps aren't optimal.
When all else fails, negative pressure will keep it clean 

https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/6vv1nm/i_decided_to_cool_a_few_of_my_miners_using_a/
I am going to disagree with Sia. Prices haven't been over a cent since ASIC miners were announced by the founders and it's doubtful that the price will fluctuate much.

ZEC and ETC are likely good mines, DCR is close behind. I'm not holding my breath for XMR though.
I keep my cat out of the room lol

But I decided to put my miners in a hydroponics tent. So far, it's done more to keep my units free of dust and properly cool my rigs than anything else.

https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/6vv1nm/i_decided_to_cool_a_few_of_my_miners_using_a/
Yes. This is necessary for anything CPU, its byproduct is heat.
It's on Nova as well right now. But it has been sent to Bittrex and Yunbi for approval. Bittrex wants 3 BTC for listing though.
What should your criteria be? Time? Profitability?
1. What card?
2. What were your OC settings?
3. How many cards on a single string of Molex connectors?
Yep. I did this:

https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/6vv1nm/i_decided_to_cool_a_few_of_my_miners_using_a/

The key is to contain the heat and vent it away from the space you want to keep cool. A tent works perfectly.
I'm not trying to be a dick, I just do this for a living and a common part of my job is to handle litigation requests and consult about these types of things. OP is stepping on dangerous ground without knowledge.

A lot of stuff goes on behind the scenes. I have a rack full of server equipment in my basement and still avoid this liability lol.
Awesome! I'm glad you used it!

Please excuse automod, he's there automatically to make sure people know about the wiki as a resource :). Don't hesitate to ask any questions you might have.
Welcome to the discovery phase of a lawsuit. All of this will be uncovered, we're not as anonymous as you think on the internet.
> full security

Which entails? How are you handling IPS and known vulnerabilities? What's your patch management going to be to mitigate downtime?

> anti-ddos protection

So you're buying into CloudFlare with multiple locations or have a /24 to throw up to another mitigation provider?

> I hardly doubt any forms of "hacks" would occur and even then I wouldn't be liable

That mindset makes me not want to touch your pool, period.
Furthermore, do you have the funds and are you willing to stake your own personal money when your "pool" becomes compromised?

This just happened to another well-versed miner who let a simple x-forwarded-for vulnerability get the best of him and lost nearly all of his pool's funds, and, as a result, did not have the ability to compensate his users.

I am a network engineer, so I'll just chime in on the points you've already made

1. If you don't have the knowledge, hire a consultant or don't do it at all. You're playing with people's money.
2. Agreed with this. Virtualization, scaling, and redundancy are all important here. Also load balancing.
3. A dedicated IP is pretty much a must. Even a Dynamic DNS entry has some time it needs to catch up. That takes time and will cost people money.
4. I don't know your local laws, so I will recommend you read up or consult a local business attorney who is familiar with crypto.
Depends on the model. There are a few companies out there that make breakout boards now.
That looks like it triples the thickness. Pass.
Try to clean it up with some isopropyl alcohol on a non-abrasive cloth/q-tip/whatever.

How was this card and the riser powered? Any converting? How many cards on a single strand of connectors?
Welcome!

First, please have a go at the wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/wiki/index

The "Is it worth it" question comes up a lot, and the answer relies on the person. The real question is how long you expect to wait on your ROI. Eventually, you'll surpass break-even if you are diligent.

Eth will hard-fork later this month to allow for continued mining, or feel free to mine another alt-coin and convert into Ethereum.
Correct.

Some of these are also network-manageable.
This is basically anybody with anything public-facing. If people knew how many automated bots are just out there scanning their network for vulnerabilities every single minute, they would be paranoid to put anything "on the cloud".
These are called **Advanced Persistent Threats** (APTs).

They're super hard to get rid of. A common practice of these guys is to establish a heartbeat between infected nodes (computers) that resembles typical network traffic, but has a certain identifier that only the software recognizes as a keep-alive.

Let's say an infected node goes offline and the other nodes no longer hear from it. They then believe that node is compromised and will write a bit to their code space to change their MD5 hash to avoid being recognized. They might change their heartbeat frequency or communication type, or it might even trigger an attack.

Here's a good baseline article from the SANS Institute that's worth a read: https://cyber-defense.sans.org/blog/2012/10/23/advanced-persistent-threat-apt-and-insider-threat
I use this exact button on all of my rigs. Just don't cross PSUs between risers and cards, you should be fine.
Because blame the miners.
/r/hardware swap for sales. Against the rules on this sub.
Check out the wiki first and foremost: https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/wiki/

Next, for a well-rounded rig, consider mining not just GPU coins, but CPU and storage as well. My rigs pick a profitable CPU coin, as well as have a Storj node attached.

For heat, I have my miners displacing air in a hydroponics tent. It cools better than AC, and uses 1/8th of the power. https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/6vv1nm/i_decided_to_cool_a_few_of_my_miners_using_a/.
I agree with this.

Honestly, paper wallets and private keys generate on fresh machines (VMs) are your best bet. Keep things in a lock box and save yourself the excessive funds. One of those hardware wallets just got caught for exposing the private key in the boot loader or something, but I don't recall which.
From the Wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/wiki/wallets/typesofwallets

Type | Use Case
---|---|
Exchange|Your currency sits on an exchange like [BTC-e](https://btc-e.com/), [Coinbase*](https://www.coinbase.com/join/5594a46d6238622379000049), [Kraken](http://kraken.com), or [Poloniex](https://poloniex.com/). It is generally not recommended to leave currency on an exchange if you are not trading.


**Recommended** option is to use a desktop wallet like [Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases) and backup your private key for offline storage in *at least two places*. The golden rule is if your data doesn't exist in two places (flash drive + paper), it doesn't exist at all. [Here is a simple video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6lE0Ctaeqs) showing how to set up Mist.

----

A great example of why not to store your coins on an Exchange is BTC-e. Take a [**look at their main site**](https://btc-e.com/index.html) to see why, and know that those affected were only returned 55% of their staked funds, and none of their fiat currency.
We demand redundancy. Why else do we pay for Soft Serve as a Service?
That depends on the GPU. I can't answer that with certainty, but I do know that AMD cards are generally fed through the PCIe slot before the 6/8 pin, whereas the 1060 pulls primarily from the 6/8 pin.
One of my first tech jobs about a decade ago was doing warranty work for Dell.

I had a call for someone's brand new top-of-the-line XPS laptops and went to their house. No response at the door. But the house was gorgeous. Tons of land, well kept (clearly by a company), a front door alone that was more than my month's salary. It was nice to admire it for a bit.

I called the dude and he gave me the address for his work, about 30 miles away. Turns out, he was the head pastor for a church. No idea how he afforded that home, but it wasn't provided by the church, and he was one of the most uncomfortable people I've dealt with.
Ideally 1:1, but 2:1 if the cables are 16-18awg has done fine for me in the past with Nvidia cards.

Remember that a card can draw up to 75w from the riser before it uses the accessory 6/8 pin connector.
1200 or 1500 is excessive.

My 1070 rigs draw 750w at the wall.
Your first resource is the wiki! Have a look at the hardware section if you need suggestions on motherboards and whatnot.

https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/wiki/index

$3000 is budget territory, but can net you a rig of 6-8x 1060s easily.
General best-practice is to at least center and faraday the data center, but that's often expensive and until recently has been denied in many buildings I've worked with. Some very important ones, though not GOV'T, are in DC.

Some I've worked in have drop ceilings from the DC to the surrounding offices. Just because it's best practice doesn't mean the appropriate people are making those decisions unfortunately.

:(
Aside from iron mountain and other storage centers, there's probably not many.

Maybe financial and some gov't, but after working in both the former and latter (specifically for DR-related stuff), I can confidently say that unless it's purposed for something very important, the money was spent elsewhere.
I read your post on its entirety. I am letting you know that cloud mining it pointless and you're better off doing one of the options I listed. Plenty of people, myself included, have turned a 50% profit on a rig and bought another.

### Do not buy into cloud mining.
Please do not buy into cloud mining. Either buy ETH or build another rig. Cloud mining is a pyramid scheme.
I have had issues in the past with older cards, really depends on what the drivers think that it's "allowed" to install on. Someone who has done it can tell you for sure.

My question is: Why use server?
Per the request of ethOS proprietors, we cannot allow this. Please read this thread for more info:

https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/6wrbbw/regarding_links_to_ethos_distros_read/?st=J71440SA&sh=c0491908
You will be fine with 4GB until PoS.
Second one of these I've removed. No buying/selling is permitted on this sub. Please take all sales to /r/hardwareswap.

If I have to do it again, it's a ban.
That's not my point at all.

I'm recommending users that are worried about their data being compromised to mask their use behind the anonymity of a VPN service. Your traffic is categorized even if it's not shaped. Chances are, your ISP sells that data to marketing firms.
In my opinion, BTC isn't worth mining directly without an ASIC. Check http://whattomine.com/ and do research on a particular coin to get an idea if it is worth mining.
Network engineer for an ISP here.

I just want to point out that traffic shaping is a relatively easy practice. In this context, it's bad. But "ISPs are looking inside your data packets" makes it seem like they're reading your traffic and making decisions based on the private content. Chances are, it's literally just to decide how to prioritize traffic.

Anyway, the best thing to do to combat things like this is to use sites or apps that encrypt with HSTS whenever possible, or to simply use a VPN service like [**PIA**](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) to keep your traffic from being decrypted.

Certain Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW) can often do this automatically by just looking at a packet, but sometimes this relies on destination IP address as well. It's a tough battle that everyone is trying to win.
Thanks! It's adaptable to pretty much any coin.
I too work with schools! One of my clients had a teacher like this. She kept putting foil over the AP. When doing a deployment, I hid the new one in the ceiling and maked it's location with tape.
Thanks, dad.
100mW while touching an access point vs 1000w of a microwave.

An AP will also experience free space path loss, causing power to halve as you double your distance.
Sure, difficulty would drop and earnings would go up.

But then Ethereum's variable transaction fees would kick in and spike [like they have done before](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/ethereum-transactionfees.html). Less hashrate on the network would cause weak hands to sell and a drop in price, effectively nullifying your profits until price rose again.
Post for reference in case anyone needs it: https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/6wrbbw/regarding_links_to_ethos_distros_read/
It has been the only game I've liked playing so far on my Switch that I waited for in the cold on launch night. I finally picked up Splatoon the other day and meh. BoTW is great.
You realize that there are both pool fees and network fees involved, right? Sending small amounts would just cause congestion on the network for other people, hence why this isn't commonly done.
I'll give the same answer I did [**in the last thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/6w1tyz/do_mining_rigs_emit_radiation/).

> Network (and wireless) engineer here! Anything that emits heat, light, or radio waves emits radiation.

> You know the thing in your kitchen that heats up food? The microwave? The reason that a microwave works is because it causes water molecules to rapidly vibrate at 2.4GHz to create heat.
2.4 GHz is the same frequency that 802.11 a/b/g/n, though that operates at ~100 mW at the radio emitter. Your microwave is probably 800-1000 W - much higher. Long term exposure to 2.4GHz at -85 dB (probable noise floor) is probably not great, but I doubt it'll be as terrible as standing in front of a microwave for the same amount of time.

> 2.4GHz is also really good at penetration (in b4 "your mom"), so it'll go through walls very well, but not so much through people because people are water, and water "resonates" ("vibrates") at that frequency.
tl;dr: Use 5GHz wireless if you're that worried, the rest is likely just heat.

As for your concern regarding signal, it's likely an EMI field surrounding the rig. The EMI is likely causing RFI that increases free space path loss and kills surrounding signal. When you turn on a microwave with a spectrometer running, you start to see [interference everywhere](http://files.metageek.net/marketing/Chan5/Learn/images/id-microwave.jpg) (for reference, [this is what](http://sieci-wifi.pl/wifi/images/vendors/ekahau/spectrum-analyzer-interference-identification.jpg) three wireless networks on seperate channels look like).
What are you asking for exactly? The wiki is intended for beginner to intermediate setup help, not coding. That's a lot more complex than you might think, especially with writing a miner from scratch.

Genoil is likely the least complicated out there, plus it's open-source.

TIL.

My hand is healing from a painful 1/2" circle where my skin literally peeled off where it was rubbing (was trying to start an old prime-less mower). I actually put on gloves as a buffer, but it sounds like that's what made it worse.
Yep. This card in particular: https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814137135

I received an email and push notification.
[Okay](http://i.imgur.com/vJsoQ0J.png).
40,000 more blocks. Depends on the network hash rate.
I can play around with it to be sure. I'd imagine that it would make it warmer the slower it is. Eventually there will be a sweet spot in the curvature for fan speed vs efficiency. Airflow is great - remember, the less bends in the line, the better your airflow is. I was able to achieve around 5-10^*C better temps when improving my duct routing.
[The tent itself is $110](http://amzn.to/2w2vVqX).

$184 is for the tent, fan, hangers, ducting, etc. I think that might have been the number you were looking at.
Looks pretty close. The 4x4x8 I linked above is $110, so that's a $14 savings alone, plus an assembly time of about 10 minutes. For something pre-built, costing about the same, I'd have to recommend the pre-built tent. Plus, it keeps the cards cooler than actually cooling the room itself.

I am reading card temps in the mid-50^*C range.
I had a feeling lol
Ayyyyyyy. Who is this?
Here's what I'm trialing. Keeps cards in the mid-50Cs

https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherMining/comments/6vv1nm/i_decided_to_cool_a_few_of_my_miners_using_a/
You messed up somewhere. Confirmation was seconds for me earlier.
Oh that's an old Compute 1.3 card.

I'm not certain anybody has put these to the benchmark test, but IIRC, the memory clock is fairly slow. Honestly the best way to find out is give it a try.

Please keep me updated!
