I didn't say it was a close fight. I said it was a competitive fight. You're telling me you weren't on the edge of your seat in the first fight? I was thinking Aldo was gonna win until he got hit with that brilliant 1-2. I was on the edge of my seat because it was competitive. Many people and I found the first fight to be competitive. Maybe you didn't, but we're arguing about something kind of subjective. Also, a race is a terrible analogy, it's completely different to MMA in terms of the aspect of competitiveness.
So a fight can't be competitive if the other guy gets finished? HIGHLY disagree. Rory v. Lawler 2 is a prime example. How can you look at that fight and not call it competitive? Lmfao. Rory was winning on cards and rocked Lawler multiple times before being finished. You would describe that fight as not competitive?

Aldo v. Holloway I was competitive. Aldo was lighting Max up for the first two and a half rounds, ie half a 5 round fight. I could see an argument for II not being competitive.
It doesn't even look bad today lolol. Tail-end career Aldo losing in a flash KO to prime McG and having two competitive fights with prime Holloway is in no way bad.

Why no hooks and uppercuts, those do much more damage
Rory is making a shit ton more money fighting for Bellator.
I didn't agree with the hate, but I think a large factor was that Bisping already had a sham defense against Henderson and Whittaker was already interim
Definitely think Eddie is an excellent anti-pressure fighter and would have more than 20% chance, but this was also bathtub-victim RDA. Thicc WW RDA might've performed better. I'd say 65-35 RDA, based on complete speculation, gut instinct, and fanboy bias
Nah people don't usually do that, it's perfectly acceptable to let fighters go out to chokes (Holm Tate, Bisping GSP come to mind) tho I do agree with you sometimes people will knee-jerk a reaction when it's Mario

Block then immediately break/transition. Be unpredictable, or they'll be able to block your transition. You can transition to another position like single collar, then break if necessary. Or even throw in your own attacks.
Spamming uppercuts: lean to the side/back and counter.

Uppercuts mixed in with hooks

1. Try to figure out their favorite combos, apply appropriate head movement and counter.

2. Make some space, go jab/straight followed by opposite side body kick. Uppercuts can't counter range-y body kicks.

Head movement spammers

1. Attack the body. Front kicks are great for that, mix it up between body and head front kicks.

2. Punish them. They go side to side? Hooks. They duck? Uppercuts. They lean back a lot? Jabs/straights followed with head kicks or whatever.

It's really just about figuring out other people's patterns and punishing them for it.

GSP should be #2 if he's going to be on the list. He left the P4P list at the top, then came  back and defeated the champion from the weight class above. Now there's talk of him coming back at LW. Though whether or not he should be on the list in the first place (since his return is up in the air) is debatable.

Are you being obtuse on purpose or are you just actually that dumb? How hard is it to understand that the 10 second signal reminds the fighter that the round is about to end, and that a fighter understands that since the round is about to end they can try to maximize risk/reward by going for something? I seriously don't know which one it is.
Because TJ said so himself. And it makes sense. Fighters often try shit when they hear the 10 second timer.
Check my reply above
Use less head kicks, those use massive amounts of stamina and if you miss it's even worse.

Focus on boxing. Go to the head, go to the body, mix it up, sprinkle some here and there. Hide body kicks and leg kicks by using them at the end of combinations.

If you're fighting a pressure-heavy fighter who keeps pushing forward so you need to keep blocking, try to see which sorts of punches they go to the most and use head-movement/lunges to avoid and counter.

If they're heavy on straight punches/jabs, duck and uppercut or slip and counter. If they're heavy on uppercuts, slide back and counter hook. If they're heavy on hooks, duck and uppercut. Maximize your lateral movement by moving to the side instead of retreating to the fence constantly.

When you're good at this, then put in head kicks occasionally, at the end of the combination, replacing your body kicks. Set up your attacks.
It's just the angle
I agree, which is why I said Aldo was starting to slow. I was just saying it wasn't the exact same, and was pointing out the differences. Maybe the reasons for what transpired was the same, but the sequence of the actual events themselves were not.
>Your strikes also come out faster if your feet are planted or if you chain combinations.

Tell me how this is irrelevant to your original comment. And this is why your opinion is pretty worthless, sorry:

>Gameplay within an established genre is easy to judge. I hop into any first person shooter and obviously I can judge the gameplay. Give me a Madden game though and will I be able to judge it within the first 45 minutes? Probably not. I sucked at FIFA for the first 5 days I played it, and honestly I still suck now. I thought the gameplay in FIFA was "sluggish" too. But guess what? It's a soccer game and I have no experience with soccer games. You can tell OP has minimal experience with fighting games because he complained about the control scheme. Undisputed 3 was widely recognized as THE BEST mma game ever, and guess what? It has an extremely similar control scheme.

Back to your comment:

>I get it dude. You're good at a bad game and you're proud of it. Bravo. I guess try to feel okay about things like having a life and having real world skills and talents :(

Lmaoooooo. Let's not pretend you're above the insults either. Anyways, if you want to compare real life skills I'm down. I'm sure I'll have you beat. Just because I enjoy a video game doesn't mean I have no other skills. Get over yourself.

Back to original topic, here's my edit to original comment:

>Git gud nub means: This game has a learning curve and a high skill ceiling, like many other games. Just because you don't want to take the time required to get associated with the control scheme and the gameplay and just because it doesn't play exactly how you want it to doesn't mean that it sucks
Please read my edit. And also, why do so many people hate TW3 for the first couple of hours, or have to push themselves through the first couple of boring hours, then claim it's the best thing ever? If you asked them to judge the game within the first 45 minutes they'd probably tell you it sucks.
Your statement was

>If you can't judge a game within 45 minutes you've made a shit game and no further judgment is really necessary.

So answer this specific question based on your extremely specific statement. Can you judge the Witcher 3 within the first 45 minutes?

Besides. Like I said. Gameplay within an established genre is easy to judge. I hop into any first person shooter and obviously I can judge the gameplay. Give me a Madden game though and will I be able to judge it within the first 45 minutes? Probably not. I sucked at FIFA for the first 5 days I played it, and honestly I still suck now.

It has an extremely similar control scheme.
Read my edit.
Did you read the rest of my comment. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄

Git gud nub
Witcher 3 takes a couple of hours to get into. And that's a pretty established genre. Most people don't have a lot of exposure to fighting games.
Jose also took Holloway 2 on short notice, he had been training for a 3 rounder with Lamas. And although he lost at around the same time it wasn't the exact same way

EDIT:

Aldo Holloway 1: Jose had slowed with output but not by a whole shit ton. Holloway caught Jose mid-head-movement with a 1-2 that knocked him down, then followed him to the ground to GnP finish.

Aldo Holloway 2: Jose slugged it out with Holloway, and ended up gassing. Holloway poured it on, attacking the head and body until Jose shot for a takedown, which Holloway reversed and used to obtain top position. GnP to finish.

MAJOR Differences:

1. Jose was gassed in 2, but not 1.

2. Jose was dropped by a 1-2 in the first and that's how he ended up on the ground. In the second he shot for a takedown which was reversed.

3. Beginning of the end in 1 was when Jose was knocked down. Beginning of the end in 2 was a fuck-ton accumulation of damage on the feet, when Jose shot for a takedown.
That's because there's a huge variety of strikes in MMA... Undisputed 3 also had you pressing multiple buttons for the more advanced strikes. Your strikes also come out faster if your feet are planted or if you chain combinations. The game has issues but 45 minutes is not enough time to judge this game.

Tldr: git gud nub

Edit: Let me clarify. Git gud nub means: This game has a learning curve and a high skill ceiling, like many other games. Just because you don't want to take the time required to get associated with the control scheme and the gameplay and just because it doesn't play *exactly* how you want it to ***doesn't mean that it sucks***
I bet this is because imagine this scenario:

People never fucking press skip because they're busy trying to memorize combos

You're not really taking your own advice?
How so?
Wonderboy gotta be in this discussion for sure about best strikers in the UFC. Obv he has a striking bg tho
I don't think they are feints, Bisping reaches pretty far and does commit and without the wing Chun stuff Anderson is doing here they would've landed
She has great grappling. Taken off the roster after this fight tho
Deuce*
Conor can't keep up the pace like Holloway can though and get stronger through the fight, and that's how Holloway beat Aldo. Aldo did well until his gas tank couldn't keep up with Holloway
So she should bulk?
Scenario C

Rose is a bad matchup for Joanna, beats her again, but loses to either Andrade/Gadelha or KK or whoever else
Tony is touchable af but he'll touch you back in worse ways 😉
He isn't ready. I say give Superboy some time to grow as a prospect instead of rushing him like the UFC has been doing.
LMFAO she's basically Artem

He didn't fight his normal style because that was the gameplan, and as we know Rory sticks with the gameplan. After the fight Rory felt that him and his coaches were too concerned with what WB was going to do, and were playing WB's game and trying to figure out WB's puzzle which he thought was a bad idea and it prompted him to change up his camps and to spend more time at his original camp in BC.

1st round was extremely close. I scored it for Hendricks on my first watch, but on multiple watches after it was extremely hard to score and honestly could've gone either way. I think a big factor in it was also how dominant GSP was. Seeing GSP struggle was surprising, and thus on the first watch I scored it for Hendricks, thinking it was a clear round even though it wasn't. I think a lot of people were also affected by that.
It's a hardware engineering/physics problem. Is Google good in that area? Google's main strengths are in software engineering
Why do you hate DC?
Exactly. Plus, RDA has good ground game, compared to WB's nonexistent ground game.
Check out my edit. With fightmetric link.
RDA was light on his feet and moving nimbly, throwing hard and fast power shots.

[RDA threw and landed only 9 less strikes in Rd 4 than he did Rd 3 and actually landed 5 more strikes in Rd 5 than 4.](http://www.fightmetric.com/fight-details/9220acccebf14a46)
RDA did not tire lmao. RDA and Tony both kept the same pace all 5 rounds. He lost because he was out pressured by Tony, and pressuring is hard when you've been eyefucked.

We don't know how much it changed. This was a fight at the highest level and at the highest level the littlest things matter. An eyepoke of that magnitude is waaaay beyond the "littlest things". If RDA hadn't been eyepoked who's to say he wouldn't have won the third as well as the fourth and fifth?
>[Victory in New York! Georges St-Pierre came back after four years of inactivity to win the UFC middleweight title against the great Michael Bisping at Madison Square Garden tonight. It was perhaps the most dramatic fight of his incredible career. **Despite his incredible past successes there have always been three constant criticisms of his work, the first, that he did not finish fights, the second, that he never fought above his weight, and the third, that he fought in a tactical fashion that made some of his fights convincing, but unexciting.** Mr St-Pierre took time off to train and reconfigure himself in a way that would enable him to prove people wrong. He worked with Freddie Roach on his punching power and with the squad on submission skills and tied everything together with Firas Zahabi. Tonight he stormed back into the octagon and finished a great opponent in a heavier weight class above his own in a very dramatic and action packed fight. This fight had it all - striking, takedowns, submissions- all encased in back and forth action. When Mr St-Pierre first mentioned to us his desire to come back, it was me who suggested taking on Mr Bisping. My reasoning was that all his career, He had beaten tough welterweights. If he came back as a welterweight it would add nothing to his legacy. Only a significant change in octagon demeanor and weight made sense, so we began planning. All credit to Mr St-Pierre and his worthy opponent Mr Bisping. We are all so proud!](https://www.instagram.com/p/BbGnQtkjUeS/)

Beating the GOAT doesn't make you the GOAT, do you think Conor is FW GOAT and GSP is MW GOAT?
I'm aware that it's a high level counter. You didn't bother answering the question though. Woodley has always waited for that counter. What's evolved? Give me specifics.

>If you seriously believe that the Woodley that got beat up by Rory would have beat Lawler and Wonderboy you are incredibly biased.

I believe Woodley has improved. I don't believe Woodley had shown he has evolved his game to deal with a long/tall pressure/volume striker with excellent ground game like Rory. Lawler wasn't pressuring him like Rory did and Woodley capitalized and managed to find the KO with a beautiful series of feints in the first. WB was scared of the TD cause he got mauled by Woodley in their first ever round which nullified his kicks, and made him scared of the overhand right. Making him unable to properly pressure Woodley and tire him out like Rory did.

Rory isn't scared of the TD. Rory has proven he can execute the pressure/volume gameplan. Woodley has not shown he can defend against a fighter like Rory. Rory is Woodley's nightmare matchup, and even Woodley thinks so, recently calling Rory "a stud and [his] toughest matchup on the universe [sic]".
Bisping won 1 title defense and Anderson had 10.... Stop being obtuse
Yoel has never won the title or any title defenses, Anderson is the GOAT MW for sure.
And the longer you defend the more shit is thrown at you and the more your game is studied. Which is why long title streaks are absolutely necessary for a fighter to be in GOAT contention talks. Also why Aldo is the FW GOAT and it's not Holloway (yet).
RDA said he was seeing triple of Ferguson. The fact that he won the third just shows how good he is, it doesn't say anything certain about if it was fight-affecting or not, maybe he would've won the third fourth and fifth if he hadn't been lobotomized
Which would be cancelled at least 4 times guaranteed
>He beat the current champ four year, before the current champ evolved his MMA game

What's evolved about Woodley's game? He backs to the fence, waits to counter with overhand rights or TDs, and occasionally explodes in linear bursts peppered with feints.

>Daley's always had massive holes in his game and so has Lima in terms of take down defense. I still give Rory credit for beating both however it wasn't like he destroyed Lima, he pretty much utilized lay n pray.

Rory started taking Lima down and controlling him to win the fight after his leg swelled up due to damage. It's called fight IQ.

>"he was winning the fight till his nose shattered into pieces", you make it sound like it was some kind of freak injury and not Lawler's striking that stopped Rory.

I agree with this one partially. This fight was extremely competitive, but Lawler's traditional southpaw game gave Rory trouble just as Hendricks had done with GSP. Rory was able to work around it and win 3/4 rounds though, but eventually the accumulation of Lawler's straight punches were enough to destroy Rory's nose. However! It was an extremely competitive fight and Rory was extremely close to beating Lawler, the champ. AKA absolutely top competition.

>The Wonderboy wasn't competitive and Rory had a year off prior to the fight so I don't think you can use that excuse.

It was a clear cut decision, but that doesn't mean it wasn't competitive. WB wasn't able to tool Rory like he was able to do with Whittaker, Cote, Ellenberger, Hendricks, and Masvidal. Also, his nose did break again during the WB fight, and Rory admitted he didn't let his nose heal up properly because he was anxious to get back in the gym to continue sparring and stuff.

>His loss to Condit was a long time ago, so I don't think it's too relevant, Condit hasn't looked great recently either.

It's relevant to the point of Rory always fighting top competition. Pretty sure this was like 21 year old Rory's second fight in the UFC, and he dominated the fight but Condit was able to use veteran smarts to finish in the last few seconds.
Also if DC's boyfriend, DC's parents, DC's gym, and literally everyone he interacts with speaks Portuguese... *and* his parents were originally from Brazil, then yeah.
Just checked the vid, it's been a while since I watched it and you're right that Tony was the one telling Werdum to quiet down. I had remembered Tony as being the aggressor, however, and Tony did very abruptly and rudely told Werdum to quiet down while Werdum was already talking in a hushed voice responding to a reporter.

Werdum's "history" of calling people "gay" is DC. Werdum called DC "maricón", which has multiple meanings, some of which include "nance", "sissy", etc. Werdum and DC are also close friends, and the only reason this spiralled into something huge is because some idiot on r/mma used Google translate and freaked out at Fabricio "talking shit" to DC when he really was just ribbing his good friend.

Fabricio Werdum: "I love Cormier, he’s my good friend for a long time."
Maricón: fagot, fag, fairy, poof, queen, nance, faggot. All possible translations according to Google Translate, and native speakers on r/mma have attempted to explain it's usually along the lines of sissy.

Werdum called DC a maricón, which set r/mma in a frenzy because of r/mma's idiotic hivemind mentality and overprotectiveness of their favorite fighters. R/mma forgot that Werdum and DC are friends who joke around a lot and Werdum was definitely just ribbing DC on a self-serious topless insta pic.

Fabricio Werdum: "I love Cormier, he’s my good friend for a long time."
~~Nope. Werdum had asked Ferguson to lower his voice because he was doing an interview next to Ferguson but Ferguson kept going and Tony was talking mad shit, saying he'd beat up anyone including Werdum who was sitting next to him. That's when Werdum got pissed. Get your facts straight.~~

I should get my facts straight

FW had plenty of contenders. LHW doesn't.
What about "the cage"
"DC is playing it safe by moving up to fight the baddest man on the planet."

"Yo Rockhold! Lemme fight you you're a middleweight who's 1-2 in your last 3!!!"

Fuck Gus. It's undeniable that his two fights with Jones and Cormier were epic but outside of that he's a maelstrom of salt, inactivity, and eye pokes. I used to like him but I'm starting to dislike him a lot.
That build "quality" was dogshit. It was creaky and soft at certain points at the back where you could push and it'd literally flex in. The rubberized coating came off in patches. It was cheap and flimsy but it was acceptable because it was literally a cheap phone but the Pixel line build is literally not even in the same universe and going back to that build for the Pixel line is like going from the interior of a Mercedes to the interior of a Nissan Versa
Which were originally WebOS and BB10 gestures
Idk, that was one strike. Weidman got mazzagatti'd by Herb in this fight, Rockhold basically TKO'd him three times over multiple minutes of savage beating. I'd probably take the one super hard strike vs the sustained beating.
Lol
Thompson didn't do it because he was scared to use his kicks and scared of the TD because Woodley punished him for it so badly in their first fight in the first round. His kicks are a huuuuuge part of his striking arsenal. Rory has a good ground game like GSP, and thus didn't have to worry about it as much and even took Woodley down.

[GSP also said his original plan was to fight Woodley. Danaher convinced him to go for Bisping.](https://www.reddit.com/r/mma/comments/7j5njl/_/)
He wouldn't need to avoid Woodley's kill shot for 25 minutes, he just needs to avoid it for the first round and a half. By being active and pressuring/punishing Woodley for sitting on the fence like Rory did, GSP can have Woodley gassed and confused/hesitant to pull the trigger. Thompson didn't put the pace on Woodley and that's why he still held that power in the 4th and 5th. Guaranteed Woodley would be gassed within 3 if he got worked like he did against Rory. GSP would wear him down and out.
Are you using a third party charger? This would happen to me when using shitty third party chargers.

No need to be snarky. That's the sentence I was talking about. You mention Mendes' last four fights and his last three losses (to Aldo, McGregor, and Mendes), and then immediately pivot to talking about his most recent two losses to McGregor and Edgar, and instead of his third most recent loss to Aldo you run back to ten fights ago?

Do you not see how this might be misleading? You changed subjects in the space of one word, "with", and that gives it a second meaning. One which actually logically flows more naturally, because one would assume you're talking about the last four bouts, as that's the subject the first half of your sentence.

>Mendes is 1-3 in his last four and has stoppage losses to Aldo, McGregor, and Edgar.

That's clear. Also, how is McG even relevant for the title picture at FW anyway? Dude's never going back down.
I thought you meant in his last four. Your sentence was misleading.
Nope. Went to war with Aldo but it was a decision.

Also let's put this in context: TKO'd Lamas inside 1 right after. Lost on two weeks notice to McG after giving him the hardest fight of his career, and lost to Frankie Edgar shortly after by KO after Edgar clipped him with a shot on the nose, when he probably should've taken more time off.

Mendes is still a tremendous wrestler who just happened to have a tough run against the GOAT FW, a former FW/LW champ, and a former LW champ. He's by no means a goner, and he's now had time to recover and give himself time to hone some shit down instead of leaping right back in. It's just a shame he couldn't've continued to work with Duane, like TJ.
Yes. Tested positive and fessed up
Such a hype fight, it'll be sad if the Blessed era lasts only 1 defense tho
>NEVER once have I forgot how to speak my native language.

That's not the question though. It's not "have you forgot your native tongue", it's "has your native language fluency dipped in any way"? Has your family noticed your verbage/accent of your native language slipping a little? I'm bilingual too, and I can say I probably speak my native tongue with more of a Canadian/American/white-washed accent than how I did when I was living in my native country. My parents have noticed this a bit. My vocab is also worse because I rarely use my native tongue.

Mackenzie's secondary language (English) proficiency has slipped a bit due to not using it as much as her primary language (Portuguese).

>"People think that because I grew up here it's all English," she says. "But my dad and my step mom are both Brazilian. My boyfriend speaks Portuguese. I'm speaking Portuguese more than English. All day.

>"I still have lots of interactions in English of course. But I think in Portuguese. Anything to do with fighting is all in Portuguese in my mind. When I'm working out, I'm counting in Portuguese. My dreams are in Portuguese. I even talk to my dog in Portuguese."
[I've seen the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Npfa4i8ws5M) Based on all the hubbub surround this I honestly thought it was gonna be a lot worse. And over seven years? Idk. Maybe she was even trying to talk more like a valley girl initially to fit in with the other teenage girls and is just more relaxed about her accent and heritage now, she wouldn't be the first. Teenage girls can be brutal.
>The truly bizarre thing about Brian Ortega is that he seems to lose every single he's in... until he wins. His mixed martial arts record is basically a highlight reel of him walking down every opponent, getting mauled in the process, and then landing some fight ending punch or submission. The fact that it wasn't in the third round was the truly surprising result of this contest. The fact Frankie was outlanding the cow 3-1 before getting introduced to the sweet sweet scent of canvas was not surprising in the least.

It seems like recently (at least in his last two fights, which admittedly isn't a lot of data points) he's been picking up the finishes faster and faster. He almost got Cub in an anaconda in the first (saved by the bell), then got that guillotine in the second. Frankie he finished in the first emphatically. Man, Holloway/Ortega is gonna be so much fun. I kinda wanna see Aldo/Ortega too but first the UFC should let Aldo smash a couple of easier fighters.

Submissions from guard at the top level seem to be getting rarer and rarer. The only recent one that comes to mind for me is Ferguson Lee, where Tony submits Kevin Lee with a triangle. Have there been any other recent ones?
Maybe the slight technicalities are needed less since women are less powerful and explosive. The danger of the KO is lessened, so mistakes are punished less frequently, which disincentivizes practicing proper technique.

The lesser competition/less refined competition could also play into that.
Not really. Rogan isn't known for being objective. He talks like he is, but he really isn't.
In MMA wrestling he probably would. He'd fuck him up on the feet then take him down when he wasn't expecting
Marc Goddard and Big John both had long win streaks at the top of the game
Lmao, why wouldn't I watch my "fav fighter" fight?
Yeah, it didn't land cleanly. You can see from the other angle that it's the calf/ankle that hits Khabib, not the heel
Ferguson is a bad matchup? Lol if RDA had won one more round he would've won the fight. It's not hard to think that RDA would've eeked at least one more round if Tony hadn't tickled RDA's brain with his index finger.
RDA lost because Tony v. RDA was decided on who was pressuring more/better. Anytime either was pressuring they were winning. Pressuring is kind of hard after the other dude has jammed half of his index finger into your eye-socket though. Maybe the fact that RDA won the third shows just how good he is, that he's able to win rounds even after being eyepoked and that he might've won the fourth and fifth too.

If you seriously don't think eyepokes are going to affect a professional fighter fighting the #3 or whatever fighter in the world, try putting a pencil an inch into your eye socket and go do some other stuff, let me know how much it affects you.

Fights at the highest level (such as RDA Tony) are often decided by millimeters. Tony literally won by one round. An eyepoke as major as the one in RDA Tony is going to be a large factor.
Gassed? Lmao RDA did not gas, he was throwing heat and volume in round 5 just like Tony. RDA lost because Tony v. RDA was decided on who was pressuring more/better. Anytime either was pressuring they were winning. Pressuring is kind of hard after the other dude has jammed half of his index finger into your eye-socket though.

RDA can go five rounds at altitude with Tony Ferguson without slowing. Tyron won't be able to ration his energy like Yoel if he's trying to wrestlefuck RDA was my point.
Woodley is good but will he have the cardio to keep consistent high level grappling up for 5 rounds if he can't finish RDA on the ground?
RDA is decent enough of a pressure/volume striker that he could potentially Rory Woodley. His ground game also negates the Woodley takedown threat.
Round 3 has to be yours but maybe you weren't doing much damage on the ground and he had significant moments where he rocked you in the first and second. Then I could see it going his way.
Using head movement or sliding?

Yo I went from a 22" bong to vaping for health reasons. Heavy smoker, and I too was chasing that retarded high. Go with the Sticky Brick. I own a Mighty, Sticky Brick, Magic flight, and have used the Pax extensively. The Mighty is dope especially with a bong but if you want something similar to combustion it has to be the Sticky Brick. I use the Hydrobrick Maxx, and it's the closest I've gotten to combustion retarded high. Use code SBL on Puffitup to get 20% off.
Also have a Mighty, and I got the [D020-D bubbler](https://www.dhgate.com/product/d020-d-9-inches-bubbler-glass-bong-water/244202146.html) as suggested by the recommended rigs link in the sidebar. Didn't like it, as I would get water splashback and it just didn't feel very effective. Ordered [this bong](https://www.dhgate.com/product/big-glass-bong-complex-design-inline-perc/382055821.html), also recommended in the sidebar link, and it's a whole nother game. Completely transformed how I use my Mighty. Super dope, would absolutely recommend. I get huge pulls from it, and it feels more similar to smoking a bong and hits so much harder/better. If you put ice in it you can literally pull until you completely fill your lungs multiple times.

It's not as simple as that though, in some cases long legs help with grappling. See Jones
That's not answering my statement that Tyron has not shown he has the skills to beat Rory. Styles make matchups, and MMA math doesn't work. Just because Rory can't beat WB and Tyron can, doesn't mean Tyron will beat Rory lol. Rory is a terrible matchup for Tyron, and Tyron has not shown the skillset required to beat Rory.

WB was also hesitant to open up against Tyron with his kicks because of Tyron's explosive wrestling. Rory has excellent ground game and actually took Tyron down in their bout.
I never said he hasn't improved. I said he hasn't *shown* that he can fight the type of fight that Rory would impose on him. Give me an example of a fight he had where he has *shown evidence* that he can deal with Rory. Otherwise, you're just spouting conjecture.

>Kelvin: was giving Tyron space and getting lit up until he started pressuring iirc.

>Robbie: gave Tyron space and got KTFO'd quick.

>Thompson: has no ground game.

>Maia: spammed single legs all night.

So tell me, how has Tyron shown he can deal with the diverse game of someone like Rory? He obviously has the chance of knocking Rory out quick, someone like Tyron always does. But the last time they met, he wasn't able to initiate that due to Rory's clever feints, outfighting/length, pressure, and volume. Since then, he hasn't shown an ability to deal with someone like Rory.
RDA would share those advantages with Rory, but Rory does have the benefit of size. It's part of what makes RDA Woodley so interesting to me.
Why? He still fights like he did against Rory their first time. Back up to the fence, wait for the counter. Too bad Rory has good ground game, good pressure, and good volume, aka the perfect recipe to stifle Woodley's game.

Edit: someone explain to me what tools *specifically* Woodley has shown he has improved on since their first fight that would help in their second. I'm sure Woodley has improved, he's certainly much more tested, but has he improved in the areas he needs to to avoid being backed to the fence and styled on? WB is a counter-striker with kicks as his main weapons which he was scared to use against Woodley because of the TD threat and his own non-existent ground game. Rory is a pressure/combination fighter with good ground game. Just because Woodley beat WB and WB beat Rory doesn't mean Woodley beats Rory. MMA math doesn't work. Styles make matchups.

Every time this topic gets brought up people automatically bring up Woodley's recent wins and claim Woodley would now murk Rory, with absolutely zero analysis or technical discussion about Woodley's/Rory's skills.

U/Infieldofdreams was saying your criteria is bad because it's not actually applicable to MMA as a whole. He points out that using your criteria leads to Ronda being the GOAT, which many people would disagree with.

Your candy analogy is not great. It's more like this:

You: Judging by a set of criteria (e.g. taste, texture, etc.) Skittles are the GOAT candy.

U/Infieldofdreams: Yeah but by your criteria, Tootsie rolls are the GOAT candy, not Skittles.

You: Well I don't like Tootsie rolls, so they're not part of the discussion.
Lmao, so it really should be

>I think the only way to judge who should be the GOAT is by judging who was the most dominant over their competition **unless I personally don't care about their division**
Yeah, Rogan's really dumb like that. Pretty sure he's called Conor and Max the FW GOATs because they knocked Jose out lol

Getting shit on for 2 rounds would completely sap his energy and shit on his confidence though. Woodley has cardio to go for 5 rounds when he's doing minimal work. RDA can literally hold the same pace at high altitude for 5 rounds.
Unless Woodley folds to the pressure and volume of RDA like he did against Rory. If he beats RDA though, it will definitely be good for his stock.
Woodley even though he doesn't want to. Also you need another space between each line in a list or it'll just come out as one line.

Foiled by a bot
Alvarez wasn't necessarily considered weak, but was most certainly not considered the best lightweight in the world by many especially with Tony and Khabib right around the corner.
Conor too. Werdum got a huge amount of heat for it because it was directed at DC, a sub favorite. It was most likely a joke too, because DC and Werdum are extremely friendly and joke around a lot.
Werdum talks shit to people in his own weight class too. Also a lot of people start shit with him from lower weight classes like I mentioned above, so it's not like it's completely unprovoked. Is Werdum just supposed to take infinite shit from people below him, even people who aren't actually that much lighter than him just because they're lighter than him?

I don't think Werdum was in the right for throwing a kick at Edmund, but Edmund was also in the wrong for shouting and being in the face of an opposing fighter after he did nothing wrong to Travis lol
It's so obvious to anybody who watches the sport I didn't think it was necessary lol. It'd be like if someone said: "Brazilian soccer fans are not nationalistic". There's no reason to contradict that with more than "lol no you're wrong" because it's so fucking obvious lol
I'm not saying the word itself is not homophobic or not offensive, but what I am saying is that it's not really representative of Werdum himself being a homophobe. In many countries outside of NA, what I've encountered in Asia, Africa, and many other places is that those cultures tend to be less PC. Words like faggot are thrown around a lot by people who aren't homophobic, because it's slang/lingo. Again, ignoring whether the language is okay or not, it's not really a good indicator of whether or not the speaker is homophobic.
English doesn't seem like OP's first language.
For sure, OP has no idea with what he's talking about and is spreading false information and still is getting upvoted, smh reddit
>Huge homophobe

Is this because he used the word "maricon"? Native Portuguese speakers have already confirmed that in that context that word is more along the lines of "sissy".

*EDIT* He was even using it in what was a joking-friendly way with DC, judging by their past interactions. See below for video.

>Starting shit with basically everyone in every weight class below him.

Can't exactly start shit with guys in the weight class above him can he?

>Rockhold

Uh yeah Rockhold talked huge amounts of shit on Werdum before the Velasquez-Werdum fight. [Even DC and Cain are friendly with Werdum](https://youtu.be/r1Y9aVEOnTI).

>Tony

During that interview Tony was slipping shade on Werdum before Werdum snapped back at Tony. Tony was saying he could beat anybody up, even Werdum who was sitting right next to him. So yeah.

>Colby

Really? Do I even have to go over this one? Call a notoriously nationalistic country a shithole and their people monkeys as well as being a general douche, fuck yeah, I'm on Werdum's side here.
Yeah lol, it's kinda embarrassing that shit like this gets upvoted in this sub

People always say Woodley had improved an insane amount, I don't see it at all. His game has not changed. He would still back up to the fence and picked apart from Rory imo. Where has he improved specifically that would help him against Rory? Rory imo is his nightmare matchup.

Long lengthy striker, she was leaping in and out much better than Claudia, Andrade, and Karolina if I remember correctly and was much lighter on her feet. She also KO'd Joanna with a left hook iirc.

I'm also excited for a rematch.
Rory was winning their first fight when he was fresh and new on the scene before Condit's (great and opportunistic) finish. Rory would for sure maul Condit now.
Yeah, but Aldo's biggest problem against Max was his relentless pace. Aldo was able to hold his own and even get the better of Max in the first two rounds when his cardio was tip top. Like I said though, I do agree that Conor would be extremely difficult for Aldo, but it remains to be seen whether Conor would be worse of a matchup or not as bad as compared to Max.
Doritos crash course is free and fun and Peggle is casual and fun too
Conor doesn't have the relentless cardio that Max has though, and both Conor and Aldo would slow after the first two rounds. I think Max is more of a stylistic nightmare for Aldo, but I do agree that Conor would be an extremely dangerous fight for Aldo.
Aldo doesn't need juice, but we can pump him full of EPO. Imagine 5 rounds of first round Aldo, jesus fucking christ

GSP has a great list of names under his belt

Koscheck, Hughes, Fitch, Penn, Alves, Shields, Condit, Diaz, Hendricks

Completely stylistically different. RDA is a pressure/volume fighter who has a strong wrestling/ground game, and WB is a counter-striker with a terrible ground game. This means WB was scared to open up because he was afraid of being taken down, especially with his kicks which are some of his main weapons, something RDA won't be scared to do.
Wait what? I took that as him being more low key. Please tell me I'm wrong
If Tony loses in the near future I'd want to see a Barboza Ferguson rematch, this time without an illegal head kick.

How long did you think he thought about what he was gonna say after beating Nate in their second fight? Deffo a long time, surprise surprise motherfuckers did not come outta nowhere lolol
Perhaps regularly was the wrong word. I meant it's not rare at all. Marquardt pulling his punch on Maia comes to mind, Hunto with his walk off KOs, Machida does this, Lauzon as said below, there was a gif of Assuncao on r/MMA the other day, plenty of fighters do this
If you watch MMA a decent amount this kind of thing happens regularly. Fighters regularly pull punches or stop fighting when they realize their opponents are incapacitated

No yeah for sure, but you're probably happy that there are Brits representing Britain on the big stage aren't you?

The narrative is that she's a pussy and that she backed out due to a runny nose.

[Did you see her statement?](https://imgur.com/5uZSHBf)

It's not just a runny nose. Do you know what sinusitis symptoms entail? Check out these threads:

[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/6m8m36/amanda_nunes_statement_on_pulling_out_of_the_fight/djzpgcv/)

[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/6m8m36/amanda_nunes_statement_on_pulling_out_of_the_fight/djzubtn/)

In the thread:

>Sinusitis is no joke. I've been hospitalized twice because of it. Knocked me on my ass.

>For frame of reference, I've wrestled with a dislocated shoulder and broken ribs (separate occasions).

>Sinusitis can be paralyzing.

Guaranteed if it were Holly Holm who pulled out or Valentina who pulled out due to sinusitis people wouldn't be fucking up in arms. It's because Nunes is not a very likeable person.

That's what she said herself. She was feeling terrible, and unfit to fight. She knew she had a good chance of losing the belt fighting in that condition, and who the fuck was gonna back her up after she lost the belt? Dana? The fans? Who? Literally nobody. She did what she had to do so she could come back and fight and defend her belt in decent health against a dangerous opponent, knowing close to zero people have her back in this sport due to her zero popularity (poor looks/marketability, poor English) with her only bargaining chip being her belt, which she earned fair and square, and defended, fair and square.

And do the UFC doctors have a good record? Spoiler: they don't. They've cleared guys who were clearly not fit to fight, who've been brutally knocked out in recent times.

Admittedly, Nunes did not handle the situation well. But to claim that she is a pussy, or scared of Valentina, or only had a runny nose is just plain ignorant.
can't wait until GDR becomes the first UFC quadruple champ - the true GOAT
People also shit on Nunes for the sinus infection issue and slurp up Dana's narrative that she was being a pussy. So stupid.
This is a hard one. RDA has great pressure, great volume, and great ground game, but gives up around 3-4 inches in height and 6 inches in reach iirc as compared to Rory. This puts him around Woodley's height, but I think Woodley still has a couple inches of reach on RDA. I don't think RDA will be able to tool Woodley like Rory did, due to his shorter length. I think this fight will actually be a great test to see if Woodley has grown in terms of standup game v.s. strong pressure fighters with well-rounded games, and a decent litmus test to see if he'd be able to handle Rory and beat him this time around. It's a great matchup.
I see Woodley using the exact same strategy of counter-striking off the fence through exploding, and using multiple wild feints to set up charging forward bursts to place his big right. These strategies have shown to fail against people who can punish him with volume, without fear of the takedown. His game hasn't changed in this area, or are least he hasn't shown it.


Saying he beat Wonderboy and Wonderboy beat Rory doesn't mean his standup has evolved at all.
Lmaoooooooooo
Specifics. What about his stand up has improved? How has he shown better fight IQ than before?
hello mr henry
What makes you say that? Genuinely curious, Woodley's favourite tactic is still backing up to the cage, and Rory has the pressure fighting and ground game/TDD to punish Woodley for that strategy as he's shown before. I like Woodley, but I don't think he's shown the improvements to beat Rory.
Maybe they've known each other for longer. Could have been friends/acquaintances for the last decade for all we know.

Yeah that's called emotionally cheating. Particularly when it results in physical cheating, as it did. Lmao
Take off your rose-coloured glasses and look at Jim and Pam objectively, not the way the show writers tried to portray them and have them come off as. Jim was a selfish bully (see Dwight) who actively tried to steal someone else's fiancée, lied to his wife about literally buying a home, lied to his wife by taking a job in another part of the country and concealed it. Pam emotionally cheated and physically cheated on her fiancée with her coworker. They're not great people who were written to be in a fairytale romance by doing dumb romantic gestures for each other lmao. They had genuine feelings for each other obviously, but they were also hugely flawed.
Emotionally cheating on Roy with Jim.

Jim's terrible too. Lying to Pam, making huge decisions without talking/discussing with Pam, etc etc. ( e.g. buying the house and taking the job).

Main event was pretty bloodeh buddeh

Not necessarily a war but definitely not an easy fight for either fighter
Jose's reach is 70", Holloway's is 69", and Edgar's is 68". Jose and Holloway are both big FWs, Frankie is admittedly not a large FW but used to fight at LW and now fights comfortably at FW too. Holloway does have a couple of inches of height on both Jose and Frankie though.
It's gotta be Holloway or Whittaker. If Holloway Edgar had happened and Holloway had defeated Frankie, it would be Holloway hands down. While Jacare and Yoel are extremely tough opponents, I think Aldo and Frankie are more impressive. Aldo is the FW GOAT, with his only losses in the past decade to Holloway and McGregor. Frankie is a former LW champ with his only loss at FW to Aldo and defeating Frankie would've put an extremely strong wrestler under his belt too. Yoel and Jacare are both scary ass dudes but fall a little short of the decorated careers of Aldo and Frankie (as a combination, Jacare was previously a SF champ tbf)
I played both. Enjoyed both. Definitely play both, in order

I think the curve of the screen should match the curve of the phone. That's just good design.

I favour Woodley and Lawler over RDA but I would actually say Lawler has a better chance of beating RDA than Woodley. I could see RDA pressuring Woodley to the fence and dismantling him like Rory did. That's literally RDA's favourite game: constant pressure and volume - and it happens to be the best way of beating Woodley.
I agree. Larkin dismantled Magny. RDA ran through him, but he didn't tear apart as many aspects of Magny's game as Larkin did
I'm not. I just thought it was funny that when asked where Instagram was popular you responded with "China" and "India". This was before your edit to include the younger Western demographic, which I actually agree with.
Key word

>Personally

It's an opinion. Many other people don't agree with you. Colours and options are good because it's completely subjective and other people have other opinions on what looks good.
Lmaoooooo Instagram is not a popular messaging app in China or in India if that's what you're trying to say. WeChat and QQ for the Chinese and WhatsApp for the Indians is more like it. Pretty sure Instagram doesn't even crack the top 15 list for either country.

Now, younger people in the states and Canada do use Instagram and do happen to message on insta a decent amount, esp when sharing/discussing media such as friends' photos and memes and shit like that. So people do use Insta for messaging.
I'm sure he wouldn't have to dick around for long. Conor fights Ferg (lmao) and GSP fights Woodley simultaneously-ish, then Conor v. GSP. The UFC is super eager to make Conor v. GSP happen.

I just set it up myself and I find that the profile that works the best for me right now is as such:

App: Pixel Launcher

Enter: Set screen timeout to 7 seconds

Exit: Set screen timeout to 120 seconds

This is because usually when I put my phone down it's on the pixel launcher. When assistant is triggered thru the home mini it pops up on my phone too, but exits onto the pixel launcher when the command is completed. Screen timeout is then 7 seconds. When I'm in any other app or my screen timeout is 120 seconds.
Same. Apparently a fix is to use Tasker to set screen timeout to a lower value when assistant is open though.
I'd cry
>Jose has lately adopted the strategy of winning the early rounds and coast for the rest of the fight

Nah he used to get flack about that, but lately his recent fights have been nothing like that. Mendes II was a war the whole time, McG was a KO in the first, Edgar II was a crisp boxing/TDD clinic, and Holloway ended in the third.
Not only was it on purpose but it's also a direct word for word copy.

GSP has tissue paper for skin
Agreed, I was referring to before Bisping got dropped though. While Bisping had his wits around him he was able to defend well after takedowns and mount his own offense. GSP's gnp after he rocked Bisping was heavy though, and it was partially why Bisping opened himself up for the submission.
I noticed that too and totally agree. GSP wasn't able to hold Bisping down and do damage at the same time iirc. I'd disagree and say that while Bisping did good work from the bottom it wasn't an absolute punishment. It was mostly slicing elbows and we all know GSP's skin is like tissue
You do realize you are giving me your time by replying right? Lmao it's almost kinda cute how dumb you are. It's also hilarious how your only sad, shitty trick is "tl;dr". Next comment prediction: "uh I only read the words "tl;dr" and "sad"." Fucking guaranteed lmao.

Rockhold is huge though and might be able to destroy Kelvin from the outside with kicks considering Kelvin is so small. Though I could also see Kelvin knocking him out, he does have negative defense and poor hands lmao

I'm literally dying at that last "buddeh". You put effort into that. You thought it would be scorching and have effect. Lmfao I can imagine your loser fingers typing it out while you chuckled to yourself through your neckbeard.

How do I know you have a neckbeard? "Alpha guys tend to get hot girls bro, and hot girls are fucked in the head cause they're not interested in my loser ass". I'm almost sad for you hahahahahaha go back to r/redpill
>I quoted you as saying you doubt they have a social media person. I said they did. But sure, maybe they don't.

1. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄 That's false. That's the narrative you're pushing. That's why you're arguing with me and that's why I'm repeating myself. Can you just fucking accept that that's not what I meant nor what I said so we can move the fuck on? Are you trolling me? For fuck's sake you're worse than Trump with this fake news bullshit. Jesus.
1. This could be an honest mistake by the sponsor. We don't know how they run their company, so we don't know how often they are keeping track of sponsorship call-outs, or what their process is.



2. Additionally, we don't know Fili's contract. This could be another factor that could make this an honest mistake.



3. Because our only source of information is a 45 second video in which Fili spends ranting and destroying a scale with a baseball bat, it's probably best to see if more details are revealed before we work ourselves into a frenzy.


My main point of contention is that you are pushing the narrative that I said there was no social media employee who's job is to keep track of this stuff. I think there is. I also think that it's a possibility that the company could have discovered after Fili's last post that contractual obligations were not fulfilled even if they have a social media employee, or at least an employee that handles social media part time, and are thus not attempting to screw or manipulate Fili like Fili is saying himself.


You seem to know a lot about Vitagoods' daily operations. Either that, or you're jumping to conclusions by making assumptions. Is this clear enough? I'm tired of repeating myself.
You're thick. I was using that as an example as to why the sponsor could have a legitimate reason for not contacting Fili until after the third post. I used an arbitrary example to show that we don't know the full story and shit like the example I provided could've happened, so maybe we should wait until we hear the other side before jumping to conclusions. Do you understand now? Or should I explain it in four letter words or less?

You **are** the one talking shit. You talked shit about my "hearing comprehension", unprompted.

Ahh, classic r/all bullshit. Next you're gonna attack me with "uh you probably only watch Conor McGregor bro, I bet you don't even know who Fedor is and you haven't seen UFC 1 through 200". Right, *buddeh*?
That's because he deleted his vitagoods posts. I looked back too and it's gone, but you can still find references to it on Google.

Like I said, I never disputed that they have a social media employee. I was discussing the possibility of Fili's post flying under the radar, since we don't know how Vitagoods handles their sponsorships. We've been arguing because you said this

>That would be more than enough time for the social media person to check and see if he was fulfilling his contract

and I presented a possibility where this would not matter. You've since decided to hide under the guise that all you've ever said is that there is a social media guy and that I said there was no social media guy, which I never said there wasn't.

I wish I could lend you some of my incredible, unflawed logic or my unparalleled high IQ so you could see this - you sure as hell need it.
Because a college degree means you're smart, have great reading comprehension, and/or are good at reading fine print. Looks like someone's never been to college. Dummy.

>2. Fili posts 2 instas, with no face. This is okay.

>3. Fili posts last insta with no face, contacts sponsor for sponsorship money. Sponsor checks to see if last insta has face, negative. No money.

>Of course this is just speculation. But jumping to conclusions without the whole story or at least giving the other side a chance to respond is classic Reddit.

Why don't you use your brain or your reading comprehension before you start talking shit?
I never said the company didn't have a social media person. I guess if that's your whole point then it was unnecessary and added absolutely nothing whatsoever to the conversation, and there was no need for you to comment in the first place.

I meant it might've slipped thru the cracks. You interpreted that as "there's no social media person". You interpreted wrongly.

It's also not semantics to point out I used the word "constantly". Constantly implies there exists such a person, and that person is not "constantly" checking Fili's IG. Again, you interpreted wrongly.
It's a trainwreck because there's a lot of miscommunication, misunderstanding, and it's a mess. Am I wrong? And why don't you tell me exactly what's so shitty about my points? Or try to point out the flaws in my logic of my "shitty" points in the original thread?
Idgaf about downvotes lol. There isn't a flaw with my logic, and there is a flaw with his argument. It's as simple as that and I challenge anyone to prove me wrong.
You're right, my bad I was being a dick. What I should've responded: How do we know they were hiding anything though? What do we need to answer this question? Both sides of the story.
>I don't have Instagram or id check, but more than likely Fili posted those 3 ads on separate days. That would be more than enough time for the social media person to check and see if he was fulfilling his contract.


Previous comment was addressing this, pointing out a scenario where the social media employee would not have enough time to check.


>Our original comment chain stems from you saying they don't have someone checking his IG


Literally flat out a lie. You even quoted me. Proof, with emphasis on key word:


>Yeah, but I doubt they have people monitoring all their endorsements on IG **constantly** lol

Obviously I know somebody is checking to make sure their contracts are being upheld. That's obvious as fuck. I'm saying they don't have someone constantly refreshing their profile over and over and over, and so that's where this problem could stem from.


>In fact, I agree with you in my previous contract about we don't know what's in his contract. Yet you've responded to that again.


Yeah, cause I just described a scenario that's in direct conflict with


>That would be more than enough time for the social media person to check and see if he was fulfilling his contract.


We agree on lack of contract transparency. We disagree because I think there's a possibility that their social media watchdog could operate in such a way that there would be a timeframe for an honest mistake to happen. You disagree. I pointed out a scenario in which it could happen.
Lmao, redditors aren't known for their level-headedness 😉
Come at me loser
You missed the point of my last comment. Lemme rehash

1. Contract says: 3 endorsements, 1/3 has to show face

2. Fili posts 2 instas, with no face. This is okay.

3. Fili posts last insta with no face, contacts sponsor for sponsorship money. Sponsor checks to see if last insta has face, negative. No money.

Of course this is just speculation. But jumping to conclusions without the whole story or at least giving the other side a chance to respond is classic Reddit.
Yeah, but it could be possible that that person checked up on Fili's insta after Fili asked to be paid/told them he completed his portion of their agreement, then realized he didn't actually do his part. Or maybe the agreement was that he had to show his face in at least one post, and they were waiting on the last post. 


There are literally countless possibilities. All I'm saying is this is funny but we shouldn't just jump to conclusions based on a 30 second Instagram video of a fighter ranting then smashing a scale with a baseball bat.
Ahh yes. I'm sure it's all a verbal agreement. Yo bro why don't you put our shit on your insta bro? It's fucking fire, everyone loves it

Dude is getting paid to do something. There's almost certainly a contract/legal papers involved.
Only one way to find out buddy
Yeah, but I doubt they have people monitoring all their endorsements on IG constantly lol. Fili could've told them when he was done and then they were like bro you didn't read the fine text.

And maybe that's not true at all either. Guess what we need? Both sides' stories. Reddit jumps on witch-hunts way too often without the full picture.
This is hilarious but we should try to hear both sides of the story first. Maybe showing his face was part of the agreement and Fili missed that. ~~Fighters aren't really known for their reading comprehension.~~ People are terrible at reading fine print.

Had to check if you were u/fightsgoneby, he's been raving about that
He was asked about it, so he answered. He made sure everyone knew his opinion was potentially flawed by saying first that he hasn't seen the video. Aldo did nothing wrong.
TJ was definitely wobbly, but was still bobbing and weaving his way outta there. I guess his slithery snake instincts kicked in
Werdum thought he rocked Stipe so he chased carelessly, led with his chin, and ran into the KO. Overeem has always had a suspect chin, it's pretty crazy Stipe KO'd him from guard but not unthinkable especially since Stipe was able to land accurate shots directly to the chin. With JDS it was some really good cage cutting, a good awareness of Junior's weaknesses, and Stipe was able to line him up for that perfect shot when JDS had nowhere to go.

Definitely not the most conventional run, but I wouldn't say it's weird weird. I do agree that his punches look weak though, it doesn't always seem like crisp technique but Stipe seems to be really accurate and powerful regardless.
>I haven’t seen the video

Hmm... I wonder if this has anything to do with that. Nah, it's way too much of a reach, I'm sure Aldo is in favor of fighters laying hands on officials.
Look up Joey Diaz
Nah, Jones is way better. Dude sucks as a person but he was obviously special. Love Condit, but there's a reason Jones was considered P4P #1 and potentially even a GOAT and Carlos wasn't.
Funny how we want the money fight but Holloway wants to defend, usually it's the other way around
Yeah. Bisping has fought top level competition and just got taken off his winning streak. Silva, GSP, Rockhold, etc. Rashad has lost to everyone including Sam Alvey lol
Magazines, pictures, Instagram, imagination, etc etc etc
Max also couldn't get his offense on because Aldo was so ferocious and fast. Once Aldo slowed Max was able to pour it on. It didn't look like just nerves.
Or maybe you're just stupid. Try using your brain a little? OP has fed you a biased version of what happened, i.e. her account, and you've just eaten it up with no sort of critical thinking. Seriously asking, are you literally stupid?

>  I came in, and she had FIVE other girls in the tiny room. I told her his name, and immediately she says, 'Oh yeah, I slept with him!' and started laughing. She then proceeded to give me every detail of their encounter while I was standing there pretty shocked with all of the girls watching my reaction. I played it cool as she told me about how great he was, all the positions they tried, etc etc. I then left

Doesn't sound like she tried to change the subject, and she even said she played it cool because she knew everyone else was watching her reaction.
>it is obvious OP is inexperienced and sensitive regarding dating. The more experienced person that the other girl apparently is would certainly have seen that and guessed that OP would feel humiliated.

Perhaps the girl assumed OP was looking for sexual tips/talk/advice since OP decided to ask a very sexual person about a previous hookup, where the girl likely doesn't know much about the guy except for how good he is in bed.

>the girl seems to have gone into a lot of details, and no it's not necessarily ordinary to share every detail of sexual encounters, especially in such a quite public way ;

Sounds like girl talk. Most girls do this, particularly the more outgoing and sociable ones. No, it's not necessarily 100% ordinary, but OP also *wanted* to ask this girl for details about this guy. The girl was just being honest and open about her experience.

>on that topic, I'd also say it's one thing to share details of a sexual encounter with a friend who isn't involved, it's completely an other to do it to someone who's just starting to date that person

OP never said she told the girl that she was looking to date this guy. If I were this girl I would also assume it was for a hookup, especially since she met this guy on tinder. Not to mention that the girl seemed to be telling OP to go for it, by complimenting the guy's skills in bed.

>OP clearly was mortified as the girl shared those things and the girl must have clearly seen that. Either she was oblivious to it, in which case she should pay more attention to people's attention when she talks this way ; or she wasn't in which case she should have cut it short.

OP said she played it cool.

>Anyway, my point wasn't to blame X or Y. My point was to say : while it's certain OP's inexperience and sensitivity played a big part in her getting hurt, we have too little info to say it's 100% the only thing that happened here ; the possibility of the girl being mean to OP should not be discarded.

I agree. The problem is that this whole thread has already jumped to the conclusion that this girl must be utter trash who is seeking to undermine and humiliate OP.
Lmao, thanks for the tip neckbeard
Why does it strongly look like that? I assume it's because the whole mean girls stereotype is a common one, and you've jumped to place this college girl under this category. It's easy to do that because OP is inexperienced and sensitive and has written her entire post with this bias. Try putting yourself in this girl's shoes. Nothing out of the ordinary happened here. She was likely just hanging with her friends, because that's what people do in college dorms lol. Based on OP's description their conversation could look like this:

"Hey can I talk to you about a guy"

"Sure come through"

"So I met this guy on tinder. His name is Mike"

"Oh Mike! I've hooked up with him before, he's so good in bed...."


In which case I fail to see any fault on the girl's side. Meanwhile we already know that OP is inexperienced and naive and as a result sensitive on the subject.
That's not what I read

>I came in, and she had FIVE other girls in the tiny room. I told her his name, and immediately she says, 'Oh yeah, I slept with him!' and started laughing. She then proceeded to give me every detail of their encounter while I was standing there pretty shocked with all of the girls watching my reaction. I played it cool as she told me about how great he was, all the positions they tried, etc etc. I then left and had a bit of a cry.

OP played it cool then broke down after.
Yes, but HOW does the other girl know this?

If you're saying it's because she walked to the other girl's dorm and that shows it then you just don't understand how some college dorms work. People flow in and out of rooms all the time. Doors are kept open. It shows nothing.

As for inviting OP, maybe it was easier to talk about it in person  than to send it over text. Maybe they live close together cause it's college. Maybe since it's college it's totally normal to ask someone to come to your dorm.

If anything, gossip is better done in person than over text, so there can be no screenshots that can be shared.
How does the girl know this? OP gave her no details.

"Hey can I talk to you about a guy"

"Sure come through"

"So I met this guy on tinder. His name is Mike"

"Oh Mike! I've hooked up with him before, he's so good in bed...."


Etc etc. You get the point. Tell me how this is some egregious act of insensitivity
Explain to me how it is "bitch-like behavior". Guys do this too. And what's the issue with talking about sexual encounters in the first place? Maybe you're just an uptight sexist

Let me tell you what your problem is. The whole mean girls stereotype is a common one, and you've jumped to place this college girl under this category. It's easy to do that because OP is inexperienced and sensitive and has written her entire post with this bias. Try putting yourself in this girl's shoes. Nothing out of the ordinary happened here lol.
Um what? Loads of people talk about their sexual experiences with their friends, and it even sounds like it was complimentary. Who cares? This is completely normal behavior.

I don't see what this girl did wrong at all. She was probably hanging out with her friends when OP messaged her to ask her about a guy, so she told her to come through to her dorm. OP mentioned this boy and the girl told her about their sexual experience.

Where's the problem with this? It's not like she was rubbing it in OP's face, or even necessarily knew that OP might have feelings for this guy (that OP met on tinder, no less), OR even knew that OP wanted to talk about him in more than a sexual way.

Honestly it just sounds like OP is kind of inexperienced and sensitive as a result of that. Read the following quote:


>I really don't know what to do. I like this guy and I don't care about his history, but I feel so insecure now and I'm not sure how to get past it, especially after knowing that they slept together in his bed.



What kind of person is insecure about the fact that the guy has had another woman in his bed? OP sounds inexperienced and naive, which is not an insult, just a simple obvious fact. There's nothing to be freaked out about here.

OP, chill out. Unless you want to exclusively date virgins, the guys you're going to date are going to have had another girl in their bed at some point.
Many people think GSP had tougher opponents than MM or Silva. I don't need this model to confirm what I think, I simply have to compare their opponents.

* DJ has the longer title defense record (by 2 fights) and has fought more recently.

GSP fought better competition, multiple generations of fighters, and came back after a four year layoff to win the middleweight title. DJ is amazing, but I don't think he's got GSP's resume yet.
Counterpoint: I used BB10 for a couple of months and going back to the buttons of Android and iOS feels archaic navigation-wise. I'm glad the X brought gestures back to the mainstream, and really hope this will force Google to change to gestures once they realize how clunky buttons feel after.

It wasn't a robbery. It was a close decision, literally one of the closest fights (scored five rounds, 10-9 must system) the UFC's ever had.
That's arguable. Two clear rounds for Johny, two clear rounds for GSP. Only round in contention is the first round. If you're judging the fight as a whole I'd give it to Hendricks too, but with the current system I scored it as a Hendricks win first, then a GSP win the second time I watched it and third time.

You're conveniently ignoring what he said about the display being sharper - due to the iPhone 7 having a pixel density of 56% of the Galaxy S7's - as well as being brighter. Which was two-thirds of his argument. Not to mention, having the option to have over-saturated colours is something many people want as evidenced by the Pixel 2 XL and Pixel 2 launch, with people asking for a Vivid mode even more saturated than the Vivid mode already provided.

GSP would maul Woodley and it wouldn't even be close. GSP has dominated so many stocky powerful fast orthodox wrestlers and would do the same to Woodley. And if Rory can nullify Woodley's standup GSP sure as shit can. I can see Lawler giving GSP a little bit of trouble though. Traditional southpaw boxer, just like Johny Hendricks.
I had the same issue as you, had multiple replacements. I recently contacted Google about another replacement for burn in issues (it really isn't a big deal but my warranty expires soon and I'd rather have a recently refurbished/checked over phone) and I mentioned all my replacements. My guy went above and beyond though and now I'm getting a brand new Pixel 1 from Google. Never hurts to ask!

Nowadays the Toyota can do most of what the Rolls can do, but you know what separates the two? Materials and design. Get over it. People want to pay for things that look nice and feel nice. That's normal. There's nothing irrational about that, and it's hilarious that r/Android struggles with this concept
My Nexus 5X would flex, rattle, and was softer in some areas than others. It was a cheap piece of shit.

My Nexus 5 was also not consistently dense, and the soft touch plastic coating rubbed off pretty quickly.

I'm using the Pixel right now and it's leagues beyond either the 5 or 5X. There's no way I'd trade back.

That's the full doze u/JustPlainTed was referring to. Happens when you leave it stationary for long periods of time.
We'll hear it twice, once for Joanna and once for Cody
That entire season was gold
Aldo v. Edgar II also showed that it's completely possible to shut down an opposing fighter's offense while mounting your own substantial offense, none of that Woodley Maia bullshit.
Eddie only managed 8 minutes against Conor.

IMO this most likely goes like this:

Round 1-2: Conor wins these or TKOs Max in these.

Round 3-4-5: Max wins these, or TKOs Conor in them.

It's hard to decide which is more likely. It's a compelling matchup.
So what you're saying is.... it's time to bet the house?
That might just be because of how shitty Touchwiz is. 
It is if nobody's saying "PEDs are the only reason Robbie won". Which was the assumption I was running under.
You're right, my bad
> Yeah PEDS are the ONLY reason robbie won

Straw man argument. Nobody's saying that.
Agreed, but no one's crowning anybody. People are just discussing their opinions and beliefs. All I'm saying is that it's not a far cry to think Rory is the best WW in the world, it's not unreasonable, and it's not really overrating him by any notable amount because he's definitely up there.
I see. I agree with those points, but we're looking it from a different angle. I think it's impressive that he was basically only put in one pretty bad situation with Maia and was able to mitigate it really well. I think 25 minutes with Lawler would make it almost impossible to not be in a bit of a brawl at some point.

The difference between our perspectives on Rory I think is that you're comparing him to GSP. GSP is the GOAT WW by far, and many could argue he is the P4P GOAT. I think Rory could potentially prove himself the best WW on the planet today, but obviously that doesn't mean he's on GSP's level.
I wasn't making excuses. I was saying Rory can clearly hang with the best in the world, and with some minor adjustments could probably prove that he *is* the current best WW in the world.
The "then" at the end of the sentence made it sound like you were thinking Rory was whining. I may have read that wrong, my bad.

I don't think Rory thinks too much about this stuff. He says the second Lawler fight was the most fun he's ever had, so obviously he doesn't have his shit twisted regarding PEDs (not that that would be bad). People keep snidely implying that Rory ran away from the UFC because of Lawler or PEDs or whatever, but Rory left because he wasn't getting paid. That's what he said, and that's what makes sense to me.
I wouldn't say a ton of trouble. He successfully shut Maia's ground game down, not giving up any submissions or letting Maia score a 10-8 on the ground. Maia won it clearly, but immediately after Rory took over easily.

As for the big mistakes and unnecessary damage, which fights are we talking about? I remember Rory slipping up in the Condit fight and losing in the third after winning pretty much all of the fight, but he was young af and that was his second UFC fight. I can't remember any off the top of my head.
His fight with Thompson was a very strategic fight, and he lost because of that. Wonderboy also didn't do much damage on Rory, there just wasn't much going on. I'd like to see him try a more aggressive strategy, like he's said. That's not to say Wonderboy would lose to Rory, just that I think the outcome would look different.

His loss with Lawler involved him almost knocking Lawler out, and having very many big moments as well as being ahead on the scorecards.

So he had two close fights with two out of four of the best WWs in the world, and absolutely dominated the other two. I think he's pretty well rated.
Lmao you didn't read his thoughts did you? He pretty much said he doesn't give a fuck. He was asked about his opinion, and he gave it. He's not crying. He literally said he doesn't give a shit. 
He was just asked, and that's what he thinks. Where's the problem with that?

>“I didn’t call so and so and so and so someone who was on performance-enhancing drugs,” he said. “I don’t have an issue with whatever. Someone asked me, ‘Do I think Robbie Lawler is on steroids?’ Yeah, I do. That’s it.”
It was rude of Tony to say he would fuck Werdum up unprompted and then tell him to hush after. Watch the whole video, maybe the narrative you're following isn't the whole story.
Tony said "I'd fuck Werdum up". He then later told Werdum to shush. So Werdum got mad. I would too.
Just watched Cain v. Werdum again and Werdum came over to talk to Cain and seemed chill, and he normally seems like a nice guy based on embeddeds and how he interacts with other fighters after fights.

This whole thing has been blown out of proportion. People are freaking out over Werdum saying shit in a language they don't understand, and Tony even said he would fuck Werdum up before Werdum said anything. Then he told Werdum to basically talk quiet because he was being interviewed even though Werdum was being interviewed too so Werdum got pissed. I would be too. People on here are fucking retarded sometimes.

And then any time you call anyone out on it they're just like w-well Werdum and this dictator guy! Nevermind that it was irrelevant to the discussion of Werdum's personality and that guys like Weidman and Frankie are also entangled with that dude.
So what if Tony's pulled out of one fight in his career. Idc if Tony has pulled out of 10 fights, if he wins the interim belt Conor fights him. Period. Or he gets stripped. Conor can go dick around and do whatever he wants without holding up the division.
Lmao, another case of Reddit not getting the full picture before launching into hate circlejerks and full on self righteous seizures
That was clarified to be not what it seems. Read the comments section of that post if you want more detail by people who actually speak the language and didn't just use Google translate
I used a Blackberry Q10/Z10 for a year. Gestures are not complicated, and if you are over the age of 2 you'll get used to it in like 2 days. Not only that, but I guarantee you'll love it and going back to buttons will feel archaic. Your workflow really does feel a lot more fluid with gestures instead of buttons.
30-26, 30-27, 30-26. Sure sounds very close.
Pre-USADA Hendricks was pretty much the worst stylistic matchup for GSP. Powerful traditional southpaw with loads of cardio and a really strong wrestling base. Stifled GSP's jab which was pretty much what GSP uses to set everything up, limiting his arsenal.
#**THATS THE FUCKIN SEED**
Let me poke your brain like that and tell me if you see just one of me
Whoosh
Tony ducks into Lando's kick and falls on his hands and knees. He plants his left foot while Lando misses a right straight, gets on both his feet then slips backwards as Lando throws (lands?) a left hook. That's what I see after pausing the gif like 20 times
really high up
But Cody proved himself against one style (Cruz's). To be that high up on the p4p list you need to have fought a wide array of top 10 talent with different styles imo
Stick something leg sized behind your knee and squeeze (or use your other leg)
GSP would completely wreck Conor's shit on the ground, the size difference is too much. It'd be a TKO or a sub imo
Did someone say Henry Cejudo?
No, it's not her fault. That's not mutually exclusive with her not handling the situation in a cool-headed way though.
I bet if the refs started docking him points he'd all of a sudden be a concentrating creative fighter
Didn't he have like a 50 round win streak
And at 155 let's be honest
5 significant strikes in there
That was less intimidation and more disrespect and getting under his skin. I doubt Aldo was the least bit scared
Because her and Holly's fight was dogshit boring and as such the arena wasn't booming with cheers which makes it a lot less likely that she wasn't able to hear the bell
Why? Because Dana said so?
>imagine

We're discussing theoretical situations buddeh

Spoiler alert there aren't actually 100 mighty mouse sized Jon Joneses running around
It definitely sounds bad but I'm pretty sure he's saying let's set a date any time anywhere.
And almost KO'd Lawler...
Weasel was definitely behind that
It was close and basically came down to the first round which could go either way. If the fight were judged as a whole, I'd give it to Johny. Since it's judged round by round, I gave the fight to GSP.

Traditional southpaw power punching wrestler. The fact that he's a traditional southpaw makes all the difference, it allowed him to stifle GSP's jab which in turn limited a lot of GSP's weapons and setups. GSP would and will have no such problem with Woodley, if he hasn't gotten worse since retiring.
The rest of the words: IS GONNA GET WRECKED BY GSP RORY-STYLE

I like Woodley but you're comparing him to the WW greatest of all time if not *the* greatest of all time. Orthodox power-punching wrestlers is not a demographic that GSP has struggled with.
Not really, you need a lot more cardio for a five rounder
McG refers to RDA's injury as a bruised foot and has a history of perpetuating that through the media, as well as saying things like RDA was too much of a pussy to fight him and had to use the bruised foot excuse to avoid the fight, etc shit like that.
Kinda hard not to give GSP those props when he's easily out-wrestling all the elite wrestlers in his division though
I don't think McG is just talking, I think that him being the showman that he is and always seeking bigger fights is looking at Khabib as one of the biggest fights he could have in the UFC. I don't think he's just talking bullshit to please his critics and to sound bad ass, that doesn't sound like something Conor would do.
Conor himself mentioned being interested in fighting Khabib in Russia.


Edit: here's one of a few times he's mentioned Khabib.

Rory would probably be down to fight both of them at the same time
Always good to point this stuff out though. Being mindful of what we say and being self-aware is always a good thing.
Hard to be less competitive than their last fight
Jon Jones doesn't know what's coming for him.

Volkan by first round boop, bet the house boys
>how bout u go an fuck off my comment then u peice of shit u think I need a stupid fuckwitt like u telling me about looking good who the fuck are u take your worthless advice and get the fuck out of here

-Spicelymma
Fuck that. I still wanna see Conor fight Khabib, Tony, Gaethje, Holloway, Aldo, and Barboza in that order. Too many fun fights for Conor in MMA, fuck boxing. Put Nate somewhere in the middle there, let Conor fight some other guys first.
Guessing /u/Heknarf meant Nate should try harder to take Conor down, defend against leg kicks or otherwise try to mitigate them. 
Honestly I'd prefer to see Conor fight Tony or Khabib, they would make much more interesting matchups. If Conor fought Nate again, three out of his last four MMA fights would be against Nate. We've already seen what both have to offer, I'd rather Nate fight Conor somewhere down the line.

But whatever, this is better than Conor v. Kevin Lee lol, and Tony v. Nate is still a banger. Rooting for Tony cause of this reason. Nate will still get that Conor fight later regardless, there's too much money to be made.
Professional athlete with 2 years of training in BJJ and other forms of martial arts vs professional actor? Yeah CM would fuck Brad up. Duh.
I've been having this issue with the July patch
Woodley vs Rory (mostly cause I wanna see Rory bringing excitement back to WW title fights again)

Max vs Conor (Max has improved so much since, and is the only FW Conor couldn't finish)
How does she know who this *secret* admirer is, or that she even has a *secret* admirer
Exactly. There are rich assholes from every nation. Lumping 1.4 billion people into one category is kinda retarded. Canada literally has less than 3% the number of people that China does.

This is my problem when people lump "Asians" into a group. Asians are 60% of the world population. How the hell are you gonna lump them all into one socioeconomic category?
I feel like the leg kicks played a big part in that and if Conor didn't have the kicks we would've seen Nate having more success on the outside
Dana: No good deed ever goes unpunished
Before he was finished by Diaz in the second round, then won a majority decision in an instant rematch*

Personally think he deserved it after Aldo, but after going 1-1 with a LW gatekeeper at WW idk. There were more deserving contenders, e.g. Ferguson.
Only contentious round is round 1, which was extremely close. Personally on my first watch I scored it for Hendricks, there was a really good r/mma breakdown on the first round though where OP went into detail into explaining why he scored it for GSP and it swayed me.

Definitely controversial either way though.
I thought so too live, but on multiple rewatches Khabib had his feet under him. It was a clean shot but the eagle was not rocked.
Hear me out: Hendricks Diaz super fight

Systematically broke down the guy who was never the same after. Death by a million jabs. GSP is low-key one of the most savage fighters.
Nah, GSP will do to Woodley what Rory did.
Talk shit get hit bitches
Boops > knockouts

Volkan will get his own list
Despicable. Magana deserved it.
I personally don't read too much into the Ferg fight. That fucking eyepoke tho
Great idea, poor execution.
GSP was always much more active than Rashad was in that fight 🙄🙄🙄🙄

Ahh. Good point. 
> What's nice is the thought and the gesture.

Yup, you're saying what I'm saying now buddeh
LW is a shark tank.
>BJ. All recent debacles aside, he's still only lost 3 times at lightweight, one being the Pulver majority which he easily redeemed and one being a robbery by Edgar.

https://www.reddit.com/r/mma/comments/6t69mm/_/dli91el
Really cool of him but let's be honest, the cost of that is nothing to Conor. What's nice is the thought and the gesture.
I alternate between loving and hating him, he's hilarious but he crosses the line into cringe/too far sometimes, remember that interview where he won't stop humping the reporter?
Honestly if the Anderson Aldo fight kits were still available I'd buy one, that shit's a fucking collectible at this point lmao it's a fucking meme fight kit
Ahhh that sucks. Is there any way to minimize that? And are if you don't mind what other tolls are taken on the body?
What about your body does BJJ fuck up? I'm interested in starting but I'm not interested in having the joints of a 50 year old.
Tony hasn't fought because Conor is boxing and Khabib ate too much tiramisu. I would consider Conor active too but let's not pretend LW isn't a bit gridlocked rn cause of Conor.
I think it's because Apple hardware is so much more ubiquitous.

FAKING DEATHS WITH THE BOOOOIIIZZ
No, but context is important and makes human actions understandable. The second fight had much more shit talk, much more publicity, and people were writing Bisping off as an easy fight for Luke. Bisping was an asshole after winning, but he had a dude look down on him with his nose in the air and talk about how he's not even going to have to try to murder him, and there was a definitely a bit of truth in that so it probably hit close to home. It was a huge underdog thing too. Asshole-ish, but understandable considering it was Bisping's biggest career achievement and he was a big underdog on two weeks notice. That's not an excuse though, he obviously could've handled it better but Bisping gonna Bisping.
Not really. I agree with OP, and I've watched their first fight 3 times. This is also coming from somebody who enjoyed Rory v. Thompson. At least they were trying shit, unlike Woodley Thompson I and II. There's just too little activity​ for a 25 minute fight.
His striking defense consists of hopping backwards in a straight line. It works for the most part for him because he's athletic and big, but it's by no means great striking defense.
Link? Could use some hype up doe this guy idk him
Might be a money thing too, that was an issue last time
There's a difference between trash talk and setting up your sparring partner in a crack house
4D reverse backgammon my friend
Yeah, I think it was less reading Cormier and more programming his mind into thinking it would be a body kick.
He didn't. It was three times in two rounds, it's just put together. Dariush was throwing other shit too, Barboza just read him well.
Honestly I think if I got treated like that and then was bombarded every day by idiotic McG nuthugger fans I'd probably react the same way. You'd need a godlike temperament to be calm in this situation. 
He talked shit to try to set up a fight. McGregor probably knows a liiiittle about that.
Yeah, but it's probably like 1 kick per 15 punches. They're different sports, there's no need to compare dick size.
Exactly. MMA body shots on average are harder, but at much less volume than boxing body shots. You're not gonna spam spinning back kicks like hooks to the body. Lots of MMA fans getting butthurt in this thread.
I think he misspoke and corrected himself saying "coach"
Lmao imagine if the third guy took advantage of that scenario and just sprinted past the first two guys
I'm a fan of both but that's a dumb comparison. Chael is joking/acting. The Diazs believe what they say. Big difference.
That's a horrid font
Walt is a despicable disgusting human being. Try being married to that and not lashing out.
I get worried watching it drop. When it's below 70% I get worried. Probably from being used to having shitty battery life. Out of sight out of mind.
Power is one of the last things to go. You lose your speed and reflexes much earlier.
!Remindme never
Thought you were talking about Aldo for a second before I remembered all the coke lmao
I'm an engineering student and I keep it hidden. My Pixel battery life is great. I'd rather be worry-free.
Huge bezels, physical home button, literally the worst phone I have ever seen in my life
How did Overeem expose him? I had it scored for Werdum myself. Either way it was a close fight.
I'm a Cruz fan but I'm not that bummed about his loss. He took the loss well and he'll be back as compared to Aldo and Cormier who were visibly crushed. Both Aldo and Cormier also had so much more pressure on them to win as well.
Also it's really stupid when people act like sleazy behavior didn't happen in the past. Shit like this happened in the past too, inappropriate touching, rape, all that crap. Progress has been made in areas like this, let's not pretend the past was some sort of golden age, cause it fucking wasn't. In many ways it was worse, especially for underprivileged peoples. So shut the fuck up about that sort of stuff.
It was *obviously* posted to imply that and to mislead people. Do you seriously think it wasn't?
It was *obviously* posted to imply that and to mislead people. Do you seriously think it wasn't?
Paulie tweeted that before he knew McGregor's camp was gonna post some pics of him on the mat from a shove and try to pass it off as a knockdown.
No rules, no judges, Rory style
Apparently he was injured in camp and couldn't practice throwing kicks
Your old highlight reel vs. trying to pass off a shove as a knockdown is completely different lol
Nah we'll just make an interim virtual champ
Imagine if he had GSP's jab
>since the winner's stock will have risen from... beating a top MW in Bisping

Nah. This situation is good for Whittaker but not like how you described. GSP is a UFC star and a money fight. If it's Whittaker v. GSP, Whittaker will get exposure and a money fight.
Wrong, it's Schaub
Romero is more bullshit to me. Why would the champ fight the guy the interim champ just beat, and if Romero wins against Bisping why is the interim champ trying to unify the belt against a dude he literally just beat. It'd be a fucking mess.
He said he was seeing double. RDA isn't the kind of guy to make excuses or make shit up
Wtf, her whole body looks weird as fuck. It seriously looks like they only took Joanna's head and upper arm
RDA is always game and always pressuring. Lawler hits like a motherfucker. It'll be exciting af.

Cyborg seems like a nice person, watching the embeddeds she seems genuine and also seems to love her fans, which is nice considering she gets a lot of hate
They're going to have to CGI that, or get Wonderboy a stunt double.
Security clearance: Corner
Bellator is synonymous with cringe
No. He's not. Hendricks is a traditional southpaw, and powerful wrestler. This is the deadliest combination for GSP, who was denied his jab by Hendricks' right hand and his takedown setups. Rory had similar problems with Robbie, who also denied Rory his jab and also has great takedown defense.

Woodley is a powerful wrestler and has a monstrous right hand. GSP has faced fighters like that before and dealt with them. In addition, Rory tore Woodley apart.

Woodley cannot be compared to Hendricks when considering how GSP would match up.
Imagine if he refuses to tap so you have to break it

Johnson v. Borg

Nunes v. Shevchenko

Stephens v. Melendez


And now Dos Anjos v. Magny? This is a killer card. Not much starpower, but who fucking cares? These are dope fights
Tomato potato
Maybe Jose would've preferred to lose to a more respectful opponent and made less money though. Like how he said he would've felt much better with Chad taking the rematch rather than losing to Conor. Money isn't always the most important thing to everybody.
That wheel kick was pretty close range
Why's he an asshole? Genuinely don't know
Nunes Shevchenko should be fun too, no? Honestly this seems like a decent card just one lacking starpower.

Jesus, just remembered JDS v. Ngannou and Stephens v. Melendez are on this card too. This is a great card.
Lmao that's the only time it would get hot
Comment
Just watched it again, there was time for like one or two hammerfists/hooks which might've ended the fight or at least wobbled Bisping more. It was a lot less time than I remembered though, you're right the fight probably wouldn't have been stopped. Anderson deff should've tried to do something in the next round
This is Cormier with Popeye's for breakfast lunch and dinner

Thiiiiicc
You ruined Miesha for me
If Anderson had just gone for the GnP after KO'ing Bisping with that knee in the fourth, Bisping wouldn't have had a title shot at all either. Rockhold, Weidman, Silva all fucking up... the middleweight division can only blame themselves.
I back
Two words: Stock market.
Stipe would murder Jones.
Also Anderson didn't see it coming, didn't have his feet under him, and had his chin high up in the air.
Fact: The result is controversial

Fact: Gunnar lost

Fact: There was an eyepoke

Opinion: The result is worth an appeal
It's annoying. You might as well have 10 dead pixels on the side of your screen.

What tips? What questions? Lmfao. Google Thinkpad X250 review.
I did consider that possibility. Even if we disregard the fact that it has upvotes, the racism from the original commentator still stands, not to mention that there are so many commentators like this. Racism is a problem with the general populace, with MMA fans, and with r/MMA undoubtedly. It isn't extremely prevalent on this sub, but it is definitely noticeable.

I also thought about it some more, and I still think the upvotes matter. If I commented

>No apology to Val... no remorse.. just I want I want give me fight me fight.. **Gay people** excuses.

do you think I'd get upvotes? If I commented

>No apology to Val... no remorse.. just I want I want give me fight me fight.. **Woman** excuses.

do you think I'd get upvotes? If I commented

>No apology to Val... no remorse.. just I want I want give me fight me fight.. **Black people** excuses.

do you think I'd get upvotes?

There's a certain leniency with stereotyping and hateful behaviour outside of the big liberal hot topics of homosexuality, feminism, and African-American racism. Tell me that's not true.
Lmfao. Khabib pulls out like a motherfucker, is extremely picky about scheduling (due to Ramadan), and fights like once every two years. Amanda has a much better record of making it to the fight than Khabib.
Anderson had the charisma, and let's be real; women are judged based on their attractiveness more than men, especially in a sport watched primarily by males.

Brazilian athletes are also judged harder than white athletes by Americans. Brazilians are up to no good and are juicing. American/white athletes often get the benefit of the doubt. This isn't always the case, but it often is.

Edit: lmao, came across this just now:

>No apology to Val... no remorse.. just I want I want give me fight me fight.. Brazilian excuses.

https://www.reddit.com/r/mma/comments/6m8m36/_/djzvpya

30 upvotes. Shit like this isn't hard to come across.
Really? One KO loss against Stipe who has murdered everyone while he was in his home country trying to put on a show. Then toyed with Travis for 3 rounds and arguably won this fight against Reem, almost finishing him, and he "looks like crap"? Lmao
They don't deserve ten points.

7-7: Woodley Wonderboy II
Honestly I feel like people are upset at Nunes for very little. Nunes doesn't pull out that much and she does have a legitimate reason to pull out. This feels like a combination of her being not particularly charismatic, unattractive, and Brazilian. Oh, and a splash of Dana's lies.
I will never not upvote this meme, I'm still pissed at Wonderboy for blatantly lying about that
You're kidding right lmao
That "odd appreciation" is called an erection buddeh
Walt is a drug cook, murderer, child-poisoner. Skylar has a off-putting personality and is a cheater.
Next time communicate to your wife about your issues and problems with your life and marriage instead of cooking meth, shooting people in the head, placing your kids' lives in danger, and poisoning other people's kids. Walt is a monumental fuck.

We can play at this all day. Walt has done more fucked up shit than Skylar BY FAR.

And I have another issue with "husband you don't want".

Their marriage was fucked because of Walt. Walt was obviously lying to her, deceiving her, disappearing for extended periods of time, and exhibiting all sorts of crazy behaviour. When Skylar would ask him about it, he would gaslight her and pretend she was making shit up. It's honestly so pathetic and patronizing in how stupid Walt must have thought Skylar was. Cheating was wrong, but again, *human* and *understandable*.

If you haven't yet, rewatch BB. Through the first watch I was constantly pissed at Skylar and annoyed at her character. She was the buzzkill. Watching it for the second, third, and fourth times I realized just how fucked up Walt was, how normal Skylar was, and completely changed my mind about the scenario.

React to it as if it were real life, not a TV show. Skylar and Walt are both flawed, but Walt is so much worse than Skylar.
Let's recap that Ted scenario.

Walt breaks bad, constantly threatening and lying to his wife, cooking meth, killing people.

Skylar can't take it any more, has to look for intimacy and normalcy somewhere else, i.e. Ted. She kind of breaks bad herself with helping Ted with his sketchy paperwork

Skylar breaks it off with Ted.

Ted is a huge bitch and blackmails Skylar. If you remember correctly the paperwork was fucked, and Skylar doesn't want to give Ted the money but if she doesn't the White family is fucked.

At this point Ted is not her "lover". It's not like a present to him or anything, she just got screwed by fucking Ted, which was a result of her mentally breaking after Walt's horrendous treatment of her and his terrible actions. Fault all around, but it can't completely be blamed on Skylar.
I thought she was unlikeable at first too. I agree, she isn't pleasant and has many flaws. I think she definitely became better after the first two-ish seasons though.
Yeah, but Walt's "overreacting" included him killing people in cold blood. He shot Mike just cause he was pissed.

Skylar isn't the most pleasant person and she has many flaws, but Walt is a bad person.
She definitely wasn't the nicest to Walt at the beginning, but that diagnosis example is a bad one imo. It's human and understandable that she wants her husband to consider chemo lol. Many people react like that when faced with the potential death of a close one, and while it might be selfish, it's coming from a place of wanting her husband to live.

She obviously took it too far with the whole intervention thing, but again, she was freaking out cause her husband had fucking cancer and didn't want any treatment.

Choosing not to get treatment is also a bit of a selfish decision in itself
Floyd
Jesse reacted like how a normal, good person would react in that scenario. It's weird how people thought Jesse and Skylar were pussies/bitches when they were reacting realistically to Walt who was completely off the rails.
Masturbation duh
Mystic Caallum  🙌🙌
Koscheck was legit af.
When people talk GOAT they usually mean P4P GOAT. No one's saying Silva would beat Fedor lmao
I didn't say it was the right decision. I said it was a very understandable and human mistake, and that it's not as simple as being "oh they made the wrong choice, shame on them, stupid poor people". My point is that it's easy to judge people when you're not living their day to day and struggling like they are.
See my comment here: https://www.reddit.com/r/mma/comments/6k9eyf/_/djkp5fn

Experiencing poverty gives you perspective and understanding of these people's situation. It's hard to have that perspective and understanding without having experienced poverty.
There are so many factors though. Third world country poverty is  different to first world country unemployment (not to trivialize your situation), assuming you're from the US. Not to mention these people are farmers. Farmers need children to help with work anyways, so it's not like having children is all loss. There's also the question of sex education. I can't imagine that poor Brazilian farmers are receiving any sort of adequate sex education. Either way, ten kids is obviously not the smartest idea but the Palhares family is human, and it's not hard to empathize with people in their situation.
He didn't answer the question because he doesn't know. Poverty is a bitch, and it's extremely hard to understand unless you're in that situation or have been in that situation. Have you?

Watching from your couch (and in retrospect) you can say that was a dumb move. In the cage though, it's a lot less clear. It wasn't the best course of action. I took offense to summarizing it as "aka he was dumb".
>Cat is dumb

>no one is that dumb

>remember when werdum

Then I provided context. You countered by saying that it could just be summed up as "aka he was dumb". I don't think that does the moment or the fighter justice. I believe context is necessary.
World champion calibre mixed martial artist who's dedicated his life to martial arts, finished two HWs people consider GOATs (HW GOAT for Cain, GOAT for Fedor), has an illustrious career, slips up once against the current reigning HW champ who's career wins are chock full of KOs in a weight division where one punch is all that matters, and you call him "dumb"? Lmao. Let's see you do better. He's human. He made a human mistake in the heat of the moment with tons of public pressure and viewership on him. Get over yourself.
Tbf Werdum thought he had Stipe hurt, and he was trying to put on a show for a home crowd.
Nope, keep Sage innocent and pure
You can really tell how much Tony has improved. His style still looks familiar, but it's much more stiff and a little wilder here. He's so much more fluid and tight in his movements now
Man, I'm picturing GSP v. CM Punk now and it's hilarious.
should be

>Floyd Mayweather's account

instead
I definitely think Conor outboxed Nate, but I also feel like a factor in that result was the leg kicks. Nate would've done better with the boxing if his lead leg wasn't getting chewed up.
Nah Conor getting the LW shot was worse. At least Mayweather McGregor isn't holding up any boxing divisions.

Edit: What I meant was that boxers shouldn't feel as bad as the LW division felt when Conor got his title shot because it's not like Mayweather was gonna fight any of them anyway.
>He was couldn't kick because Holloway closed too quick

Don't remember Pederneiras saying that.

>Aldo injured his leg

That was context, not an excuse. He said it back then and he's reiterating here that Max was the better man that night.

>Aldo didn't follow the game plan

Reason for loss. Not an excuse. What's your point? I'm unsure.
You realize it's a joke right? Like OP isn't going to do shit with his degree
Tyron was asking for money fights but regardless of that he took the number 1 contender fights as soon as they came up. He's the most active champ too, taking those fights fast. Maybe you shouldn't hate on him.
>3)

Most likely there will be some sort of clause in the contract to prevent Conor from doing exactly that. 
Weidman himself said the exact same thing
What does calpolkid mean
Don't remember it was when Conor was running/walking away from Nate with his hands on his hips and Nate was pointing and laughing

Conor. Conor v Nate II.
First "rest bite" and now a double comment. Jesus.
Yeah, cause the mma world doesn't revolve around r/mma. The overwhelming majority of mma fans do not frequent boards like this. Check Facebook. Instagram. Twitter. YouTube. You'll tear your hair out.

Hell, check out the live threads from 212. Check out the plenty of shit posts that (thankfully, because this is r/mma) got downvoted or ignored. Aldo does not deserve this kind of ignorance and attitude, that's all Aldo fans are saying.
Not only that, but the translator fucked up what Jose was saying in his interview. Jose said was that (paraphrased from memory) it was too short a fight, and that they should do it again, but the translator said "it wasn't a fight" and got Jose booed, along with fumbling the rest of his interview and making similar errors.
Could have. Didn't. So we'll never know. Dumb article.
Fine. 7 title defenses in 3 years, 9 in 4 if you count WEC, which you should. Or an 18 fight win streak in 8 years. Take your pick, they're all impressive.
Florian fight
That's stupid. So Bisping is the greatest middleweight ever? Silva was goat, but he got beat by Weidman who got beat by Rockhold who got beat by Bisping. So following Joe's logic Bisping is MW GOAT. In most cases it just means whoever is the champion is the GOAT. Stupid.
Chad
FW will have a breath of fresh air when Aldo beats Holloway and moves up to fight Conor... hopefully
You're about 16 hours late buddy
Brilliant. I wish Aldo were more active.
The article has the entire quote...
You're right. GSP was denied his jab because Hendricks is a traditional southpaw. Woodley would get absolutely wrecked by GSP. Look what Rory did to Woodley. People here sleeping on the GOAT WW, if not the GOAT.
There was already a thread about this, you're supposed to give your training partner space when they get knocked down by a body shot
What? The rematch proved he wanted to regain his stock. He lost his mystique losing to Diaz, so he needed to immediately regain that by setting out for a rematch. Conor was also smart enough to realize he fought a dumb fight with Diaz the first time around by trying to KO him, and that he'd have a better chance attacking Diaz's known weaknesses. It proves that Conor knows how to manage his image well, it doesn't prove that he's afraid of losing...
Anything interesting come up? Don't have time to watch the whole thing rn
You may be color blind
Actually the HW title defense record has been tied not broken.

Randy Couture, Tim Sylvia, Brock Lesnar, Can Velasquez along with Stipe Miocic hold the HW title defense record at 2.
Lol, there were people on here saying Rory was done because of his nose and Daley would take it.
It was a close round. Someone on r/mma did a really good step by step analysis of the round, you should look it up
The only contested round is round 1. Big Rigg won 2 rounds clearly and so did GSP. If you watch round 1 you can call it either way. Watching the fight for the first time I thought Johny won too but on multiple rewatches and actually attempting to score it you can have it both ways. It was a close fight (with the UFC scoring system).
That's what the piece was saying. That Bush is smart but there was a false narrative being spread about him.
That's the name of the article. It seems like he's actually really intelligent
George W. Bush is smarter than you: http://keithhennessey.com/2013/04/24/smarter/
Partially. WB also couldn't let his hands go with Tyron because of the takedown threat.
Rory said that he's spending more time at his gym in BC because he felt Tristar focused too much on what WB was gonna do and not his own game - aka violence.
I bet you couldn't handle the "cuddling" for sixty seconds.
Conspiracy theories usually lack common sense
It seems like Thompson "lets his hands go" when it's lower ranked fighters but at a higher level he becomes a point fighting bore. Maybe it's cause the lower ranked fighters mostly just charged at him. 
Imanari roll*

I think Rory can beat Thompson too. Get close, take a shot or two, clinch, takedown, submit. Like you said though, easier said than done. Rory said he fucked up by playing Thompson's point fighting game, which is totally true.
Wonderboy v Rory

I enjoyed that fight but most people didn't

Defiantly is a vastly different word
You know if this was a Brazilian wmma fighter all the comments would be about PEDs

Before 211 everyone was saying Andrade was on PEDs cause of her shoulders and shit. McMann is soooo much bigger relatively than Andrade here, and all these comments are saying "thick" "she looks great" etc. Woodley is right when he talks about racism in MMA
He had to throw the coffee like a shot putter otherwise it would've spilled over everyone behind him
All I'm saying is I know how Conor and Nate match up. I want to see Conor fight a new true LW contender or rematch Aldo. Woodley wouldn't be optimal but it's a bit of an intriguing matchup anyway.
Everyone there but Nate. Save Nate for later.

3 = left hook

4 = right hook

5 = left uppercut

6 = right uppercut
3 is the left hook, 1 is the jab, 2 is the straight

BlackBerry keyboards seem small but I have big hands and they work perfectly for me. The thing is you have to get over the idea that you can't touch other keys. On a hardware keyboard your thumb will depress the key that you want to input, but will probably be touching the surrounding keys. You can't do that for software keyboards (discounting the software back-end of course) so soft keys have to be larger, and thus hardware keys seem small. Give it a shot in store or something, that'd be the best way to find out
It's the least risk for Thompson. Like the first kick he tried for in their first fight got him taken down and ground and pounded. He was tentative after that. With his kicks out, all he has left is his boxing. It's the least risk in that he thought he could outpoint Woodley with the boxing.
Thompson was deadly scared of the takedown threat, leading him to take the path of least risk, ie the boxing. Rory and GSP both have great TDD and great ground game, so they don't need to worry about the takedowns and can just fuck Woodley's shit up

Big difference: Condit has shit TDD, Masvidal has great TDD. And since we're talking about Maia, that makes it a big issue
Can't wait to watch him rip Holloway up
Condit has shit TDD tho
Oh man, Woodley would have a looooot of things to say about that
Because he's Conor's training partner
He was pissed because he felt he deserved the rematch which he did and didn't get. Since then though his outlook has definitely changed and he's calmed down.
Rory fight definitely wasn't a war, but he looked spectacular in that he shut Rory down in a way that nobody had ever done. He made Rory play his game, and won every single round. It was impressive in that way.
[See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/66jopy/whats_the_most_heartbreaking_mma_moment_youve/dgkixbv/?context=1)
It's nasty, but imo not as bad. Silva's was intense physical pain. Aldo's was the ultimate humiliation in front of the largest audience the sport had ever had. Getting knocked out by a taunting clown in thirteen seconds who had been trash talking you for a full year. Family, friends, and fans expecting and wanting you to teach McG a lesson. I'm sure it felt like he let the whole of Brazil down after what McG said.
Bigly is a real word. Dictionary.com:

>Adding the suffix -ly is a thoroughly standard way to form an adverb from an adjective. However, although bigly was in use from about 1400 to the early 1900s, it never quite caught on in English, perhaps because the adjective big also quite adequately functions as an adverb: to win big.

**THE FUCKING SEED**
Agree with your point but Lawler wasn't close to "one of the most dominant champs in the UFC" and I wouldn't even go so far as to say "dominant". Entertaining, sure, but not "dominant". 
Nothing else in this thread beats this imo
It's called getting fucked up

You can't read.

>aside from 

And who the fuck said anything about top four wins? Jesus.
>Eddie's top wins aside from Joachim Hansen, Tatsuya Kawajiri, Patricky Freire, and RDA are ehhhhh

Can you read?
True. I disagree with this view in your original comment though:

>never thought of [RDA] as being better than Eddie

I still say Eddie's resume doesn't look nearly as impressive when you look at it in detail. Forget the comparison with RDA. Eddie's top wins aside from Joachim Hansen, Tatsuya Kawajiri, Patricky Freire, and RDA are ehhhhh
So what you're saying is that he dominated Pettis because he punched him really hard?

Even if his orbital wasn't broken, do you really think Pettis would've won that fight lol
Because I'm looking at impressive wins, like I said. If you [remember](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/656e1j/eddie_alvarez_stops_rda_with_a_ferocious_onslaught/dg7yah5/)...

Forget it. You think Eddie is a better fighter, I think RDA is. It seems by the top comment in this thread that most people agree with me anyway. I don't give a fuck about your opinion and I'm tired of arguing this point, as I'm sure you are too. 
I'm saying some of Eddie's wins are not necessarily as impressive as RDA's wins. That's my argument. These are the other guys then, discounting the ones I was arguing before. These are Eddie's "impressive" wins, vs. RDA's "impressive" wins.

* Joachim Hansen

* Tatsuya Kawajiri

* Patricky Freire

* RDA

Certainly not as impressive as 

* Benson Henderson

* Nate Diaz

* Anthony Pettis

* Donald Cerrone x2

Is it?
Edited with RDA comparison.
No shit.

Fine, let's look at their other common opponent, Cerrone. Eddie lost that fight easily, while RDA destroyed Cerrone. Twice.

You also didn't mention Eddie is 1-1 with Aoki, 1-1 with Chandler with his win being a split decision and his loss a RNC.

Let's recap.

* Aoki: 1-1

* Chandler: 1-1, split decision win, submission loss

* Melendez: Split decision

* Pettis: Split decision

And those are the top fighters Eddie has faced, the most impressive examples in your "win" column argument.


Dos Anjos, on the other hand, murked his opponents.

* Cerrone: 2-0, unanimous decision (29-28), TKO

* Pettis: unanimous decision (50-45)

* Diaz: unanimous decision (30-26, 30-26, 30-27)

* Henderson: KO
Obviously. I'm just saying RDA's win over Pettis is much more impressive than Eddie's win over Pettis. It's misleading to only compare the wins as if they are equivalent, you have to see how they won too
Dos Anjos dominated Pettis for 5 rounds when Pettis was at his peak though. Eddie fence fucked Pettis to a split decision after he was already mentally destroyed lol
>chronologically
Yes it does
Because that fight and those fighters don't exist. It's Weidman Silva 1
Alvarez didn't expose him, he caught him with a sneaky hook behind RDA's guard. A great shot, props to Eddie but it's not like he was dominating RDA. Tony stabbed RDA's eyeball with his finger, otherwise RDA was edging it. 
Also nutsack 
Pretty sure he did that before, that's how he knocked Kos out
I think people are focusing on the nose too much. Rory lost the championship fight to Lawler because of the nose, and people just jumped to the conclusion that because of that Rory was gun-shy with Thompson. Thompson is a puzzle, and Rory decided to play the smart fight which he usually does anyway. If the UFC had given Rory a more conventional opponent I have no doubt Rory would've taken that easily.
Man, Rory dominated Woodley. Watched this fight a long time ago, did Woodley have his moments? I don't remember him managing anything significant.
For real, Condit was Rory's second(!) fight in the UFC and Rory had taken 2/3 rounds and was super close to winning. Props to Condit for pulling the victory tho
~~Full head of hair~~ Rory ~~was~~ is a monster.
What changes do you think he's made? I haven't seen much change in his game tbh
I'm thinking security needed? Unwelcome visitors?

It was a rule made up on the spot to satisfy Conor. He was only there for Artem like he said so himself. Seemed like he got more emotionally invested in his team later but that's why Artem was let back.

His time is up? Did you see his last fight?

Disagree. Weidman beat Silva twice, more decisively than Conor beat Aldo. Is Weidman GOAT? If Weidman beat the champ in the division above after losing to the #5 contender, would he be GOAT? No.

>Defenses arent all that.

Yes, they are. Defending a belt is completely different to challenging for the belt. Defending a belt is having everything to lose and also continuously fighting the best and most worthy who have spent a lot of time gameplanning and watching you fight. It is having a giant target on your back, fighting all sorts of styles and contenders who all have different strengths and will take you into different areas. Challenging and beating the champion is nothing compared to a streak of title defenses.

If Conor had defended his LW belt he would have fought Khabib, Ferguson, RDA, Nate Diaz, Barboza, etc etc. If he had defended against all of these monsters then I might consider him GOAT. As of yet, he's not the GOAT.
I'm not exactly sure how Hub is on Android but on BB10 it was literally what you would want. Swipe up and to the right anywhere, all your messages are compiled on a single page. You can respond and converse straight from the hub.
* Fedor had extreme agility for a HW, was very well rounded, and had like a 30 fight win streak in a division where the longest UFC title reign is 2 fights.

* Anderson had 16 consecutive wins and defended the MW title 10 times, the longest UFC title reign, and consistently ended his fights in crazy ways.

* GSP was arguably one of the most well rounded fighters, barely lost a round in his title reign to top-level opponents, avenged his 2 losses in extremely dominant fashion, and defended his belt 9 times, the second longest title reign.

* Aldo dismantled his top-level opponents, was extremely well rounded and dominant, and defended his belt for 7 fights (9, including WEC).

Conor has a lot of catching up to do.
yeah that's called blackberry hub
I see. It's probably frustrating for Tyron to constantly have his hard work attributed to his genetics and race though.
Lobsters and crabs are hugely fleshy on the inside though. Are scorpions and tarantulas? I feel like those are just crunchy.
Genetics and talent are nothing without hard work. Sure, Tyron wouldn't be where he is without his genetics and talent but the majority of it *is* his hard work.
It's missing "a real physical freak" or "a terrifying man"
This is the way I see it:

The police deals with the drug use, DUIs, etc, basically things related to the law. The UFC handles what happens related to the sport (which they did, with USADA).
He's probably moving up to 155 Aldo v. McG II leggooooooo
>compared to top level guys

Artem would obviously have his way with anyone in this thread, but compared to top level guys he is mediocre. Look at his record. If it weren't for Conor, Artem wouldn't have been let back into TUF, wouldn't have had his UFC debut, and would've been dropped from the UFC much earlier. Better fighters have been dropped for less.
I don't think so. DJ, McG, Cormier, Aldo all should be higher ranked imo. 
He's got those immigrant manners
Sometimes you just have to ball out, throw hands, and knock a motherfucker out
Cody has a reach disadvantage of 3" in his division and Artem has a reach disadvantage of 5". It's not the worst comparison. Reach isn't Artem's biggest disadvantage. His biggest disadvantage is being a (relatively) mediocre fighter.
That's not what I'm talking about, all I was saying is that people with less reach have been able to make it work. Less reach isn't a career-killer, and so Artem's reach can't be used as an excuse to why he's a mediocre fighter. He simply just isn't great. The reach doesn't help, but it's not the only reason he's not great.
>Cody is also fighting far smaller guys

Cody is fighting guys around Cody's size and Artem is fighting guys around Artem's size. Artem isn't undersized at FW and Cody isn't oversized at BW.

>and is a bunch quicker with better technique

Exactly. Hence

>It's not just the reach, it's the skill level.
If everyone is taller, that makes no difference lol

5'7" Artem v. 5'6" BW guys and 5'9" Artem v. 5'8" FW guys is pretty much exactly the same. Not sure what your point is
Avg BW reach is 1.5" less than avg FW reach so basically Artem is like Cody minus 2". All I'm saying is that Artem wouldn't be some world-beater even if he had an extra 2". He'd definitely be better, but he'd still be fucking Artem Lobov lol
Ummm "my German SSN"
Cody Garbrandt only has .5" reach on Artem. It's not just the reach, it's the skill level.
Yup. Cody's only got .5" on Artem and he's always had impressive showings and is now champ. Artem just plain sucks (compared to top level guys obviously)

RDA got caught by a sneaky shot around his guard against Alvarez, and lost a close 47-48 to Tony after a gigantic eyepoke in the second. He looked great in both fights, despite struggling with weight cutting and passing out beforehand​. He does not look done, and there was not a huge difference after USADA.
>He fights his ass off, never complains, and has great character

Love the guy
No, it wouldn't. Fucking lol
I wouldn't even be mad
Woodley suggests he encounters a lot of racism and is the worst treated champion. He most likely encounters a lot of this racism online. How is that not a real situation. Please, explain to me.
I'd argue that what people say online is part of how Tyron is treated. Just because it happens online doesn't mean it's not real.
Racism complaints are justified anyway. Check out comments about Woodley on YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, etc. R/MMA doesn't really reflect the entire MMA fanbase.
Why not? You'll never see it.
Even if he loses he's still 100% in GOAT contention. Anderson was on a string of losses and there's no doubt he's a GOAT contender.
No, he's humble and smart. It's definitely part of what lead to his GOAT contention. If you think every opponent is going to be your hardest you train as best as you can and you don't take anyone lightly. It's a smart and humble approach. Look what happened to Rockhold when he took Bisping lightly.
Worse? Rory at least tried shit...
Goddamnit it happened again.

GSP got caught. He then fucked Serra in the ass a couple of fights later, completely dominating and outclassing Serra. GSP proved it was a fluke. Why'd you think they never did St Pierre v Serra III? 
GSP beat people decisively though and avenged every loss extremely convincingly. At no time did he look extremely lost or was he ever dominated to the point of Anderson v. Sonnen. Imo GSP's competition was also better than Silva's, but that is obviously arguable.
Made people who have won several medals and tournaments in straight grappling look like fools.
You all are missing Jose :(
Not to mention if you go through mainstream outlets like Instagram and YouTube people shit a lot on Woodley, including racist comments and such. R/MMA is not a good indicator of the hate Woodley gets.
Idk, I'm pretty hyped to see what changes both fighters make. Will Woodley come out and gnp Thompson into submission? Will Wonderboy "let his hands and feet go" and show off some crazy karate skills? Watching the [Inside the Octagon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dn9yKYJQpK0) analysis helped in hyping me up.

Holly with basically anyone other than Ronda is pleasant
Yup, skipped through it. Not to be a hater but it's a pretty simple story and the excessive flowery writing didn't do anything for me except make me skip to the tldr
IIRC GSP was sticking to VADA because they were ready to do the required testing in the timeframe that the fight was going to take place, while USADA was not. Also if you check out GSP's first professional fight he looks pretty much exactly the same as he does now, and he was working double jobs as a doorman and a garbage collector (?) so he probably wasn't on anything
LW? McGregor, Nurmagomedov, Ferguson
Those are some niiiiice shoes, don't hate
*Has* the division caught up to Aldo? Aside form McG who's an anomaly, Aldo dominated Frankie in their last fight. I'd still pick Aldo over any FW right now, tbh.
for real, what a boy
That'll play
Gotta thank Rousey for that tbf
It's a sarcastic joke. Black MMA fighters can be stars and cheered, contrary to what Tyron thinks. The guy is getting downvotes cause people don't get it lol.
No I agree with you lol, if he wants to take a break rn it makes sense so he can fight after getting the title, I'm just saying it looks really bad when he's shit talking and he's actually describing everything he's doing (ie avoiding the fight). It's hypocritical, and Aldo is actually trying to fight! What an idiot lol
Never pick against Aldo is just good advice in general.
Well then he should shut the fuck up with his Jose Waldo gimmick, it was funny but now it just makes him look like a huuuuuge dumbass. He's the one holding the fight up, Jose has called him on his bluff like 40 times, stfu Max Holiday
I don't even care I'm just happy to see Also back in the octagon
Believe
Max Hideaway accidentally ran into him at Disneyland
Nice save
Pretty sure Roy immediately clinched up but I might be remembering wrong
Esp considering how OCD and hardworking GSP was. He definitely had the best nutritionists and stuff too.
Rory also looked hesitant against Wonderboy because he's so stylistically different, and he was looking to play a smart fight. Put him in against a more conventional fighter and I have no doubt Rory would look great again.
* BJ was formerly a WW champ already
* Frankie moved *down* to a smaller weight class and got a shot (mostly because Aldo had pretty much cleared out the division) 
* Couture was the previous HW champ and fought for the *interim* belt at a smaller weight class
* Pettis got a shot at FW, a smaller weight class because he was next in line for the shot at LW but didn't want to wait

Conor was not previously a UFC LW champ. Conor was not moving down to a division which was cleared out. Conor was not previously the WW champ moving down to take on the interim LW belt. Conor did not earn a shot at the WW belt and move down to fight for the LW belt instead. And yes, some of those guys that you mentioned I would consider were also gifted shots.

>Conor had a better claim to the title than all of those considering he was a champion in another division and had beaten the #1 p4p fighter in MMA.

I don't think he necessarily had a better claim than all of these guys; you've conveniently skipped over a bunch of facts that I've pointed out above. It's certainly arguable, however, and I do agree with you in that he deserved a LW shot at RDA after KO'ing Aldo. At that point it seemed as if there were no ceiling for him, and it was deserved. After that was cancelled, however, and he got choked out in the second round against a #5 LW, nope, a title shot was not a convincing fight to make to me.

>Doesn't take anything from the victory. As long as you beat/dominate the champ, you are the champ.

I don't think it does either. I just think he was gifted the shot to make that victory happen.

>Kind of hypocritical to say that if Aldo can fight a champ without clearing out the LW division, Conor shouldn't. You are essentially agreeing that champions get to cut in line for title shots.

Did I say that Aldo should have been gifted the shot? No. That's a strawman you've nicely set up. I was comparing Aldo's reign to Conor's, and pointing out that Conor had not had anywhere near the same kind of dominance that Aldo had shown, and even then Aldo was not gifted the shot. So why should Conor have been?
I never said he was gifted the belt. I said he was gifted the shot. Getting "fast-tracked", especially after a convincing loss to the #5 LW, in my opinion, is being gifted the shot.

Also Aldo earned the interim belt, and after Conor abandoned it was made undisputed. It's certainly not the cleanest way of getting the belt, but is a different scenario altogether which is not what the discussion is about.
Conor did not work his way up the division. He went 1-1 with the #5 LW in the world. Gifted the LW belt fight? 100%.

Dominating that belt holder was impressive, absolutely. However, styles make matchups, and there are definitely other fighters that could beat Eddie but would lose to Khabib, Tony, RDA, Barboza, Johnson, etc. etc. To fight the champion you have to prove you deserve it by fighting your way up.

Not only that, but Aldo wanted a superfight back with Pettis back in the day. Aldo was not given that shot. Aldo had dominated and cleared out his entire division. Conor had 0 defenses in the FW division, and yes, was gifted the LW shot.
*I* was not talking about just the post itself, and you were replying to my comment and hence starting a conversation based on what I established.

Those reddit links are the first two links I pulled up. I've recently encountered 13 second comments too.

If you think r/MMA is not a bubble and is indicative of the general MMA fanbase you are sorely wrong. Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter are where the general MMA fanbase lies. Commenting on the behavior of the general MMA fanbase in an MMA forum isn't a reach.
I'm not a hater, I actually like McGregor. And I already addressed this, learn to read.

https://www.reddit.com/r/mma/comments/5s2hce/_/ddc3ztw
It's not a prevalent problem on r/mma. On social media and other MMA forums it is though.

**Edit**: I did one quick reddit search for Aldo, and clicked two links on the first page. Ctrl-F "13"

I don't think you looked very hard. Here's [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/56ap9r/jose_aldo_and_conor_mcgregor_are_both_81_in_the/d8ip5fh/). Here's [another](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/4girbk/jose_aldo_did_not_turn_up_for_a_radio_interview/d2hwpr0/).

I went to his Instagram. On his most recent post, every single page of comments has a reference to 13 seconds.
All the McG nuthuggers spamming 13 seconds have definitely never watched Aldo fight.

Aldo and McG *neeeed* to fight again
It's not gonna happen. Anything can happen, but this, nawwwww
I said if Conor dominated Aldo, then yes, I would think less of him. It's pretty clear what I said.
13 seconds means a lot of unanswered questions. If Conor had handed Aldo's ass to him for 5-25 minutes, then there might be a debate. As it is now, Aldo is without a doubt the FW GOAT. I like the Silva analogy. Weidman beat Silva twice, more decisively than Conor beat Aldo, and Silva is undoubtedly the MW GOAT.
And here's why wireless charging is great. Imagine if your nightstand was a wireless charger. Drop your phone and it automatically starts charging.

But he's not
Lawler MacDonald II
Seconded
That's also the new post-196 McG, who imo has made extremely large improvements.

Didn't McG also never really gameplan for any specific opponent until after Nate?
Nope. Ronda was humiliated over a round and a half. Technical beatdown, and then a headkick KO. Jose was caught and KO'd by the perfect counter.

Also Jose's competition was much more skilled than Ronda's, and his reign was much more dominant and impressive.
I have no idea if this is true but I'm upvoting anyway I choose to believe
He wouldn't be the featherweight GOAT for me. Not until he defends his belt for a nice decent streak. Being the GOAT means fighting the best of the best for a long period of time, defending against all styles and having everyone out to get you and gameplanning for your specific style. It's having a giant target on your back, at the top of the division. Conor hasn't done that.

Even if he beats Aldo in a rematch, he's not the FW GOAT. If he defends the title for a stretch, I would consider him the FW GOAT.
Not only that, but a non consensual transaction of something that was clearly meant to be private. Disgusting
I'm also right handed and I disagree. It's more uncomfortable to crimp my thumb to hit the *recent apps* button than it is to just move it down to hit the back button. 
Loose skin lol

Difference is Barao was dominated by TJ. RDA was not dominated by Alvarez or Tony.
He deleted his comment, what'd he say?
Basically clean
[throwback to Jon Fitch](https://youtu.be/Hoo5jwlT7xE?T=492)
Jose should've used more leg kicks
MAAAWDS make it happen
I agree. Honestly I could have still seen RDA working his way up the LW ladder. Alvarez just lost big and Khabib v. Ferguson is gonna give us a winner and a loser as well. RDA could have fought a lower ranked opponent, then fought Alvarez or the loser of Khabib v. Ferguson then maybe a title shot at that point depending on how he performs. Of course, since he's been having weight cut issues the move up to 170 makes all this LW talk pretty much irrelevant anyways.
I didn't say RDA was a bum before his loss to Khabib, which, IIRC he didn't even get a full camp for. And yes, I do know that RDA did beat Cowboy for the first time before Khabib but his LW tear was post-Khabib.
People keep saying RDA got mauled by Khabib. First, this was RDA before his huge improvements at King's. Second, while Khabib won all three rounds without a doubt, no round was even close to a 10-8 and RDA was never in serious trouble and was able to deflect most of Khabib's big shots.

If they were to fight today again, I think RDA would do a lot better. I would not be surprised if Khabib won, but RDA would do a lot better and would have a chance of winning too imo.
Idt he lost terribly. He was never dominated.

Against Eddie, he got caught through his guard, right on the chin. Great punch by Eddie, but otherwise RDA was doing pretty well.

Against Ferguson, RDA won the first round definitely, got [violently eyepoked](http://i.imgur.com/sYSXpR7.jpg) in the second and lost momentum and lost that round, and still managed to win the third round. He then lost the fourth and fifth and I think the eyepoke had a large part to do with that. 2 out of 5 rounds still isn't that bad, and it's really close to 3 rounds which would've been a win.

Ferguson is an extremely talented opponent and there was almost no allowable margin of error for RDA. I think he could've stayed within the margin, and could've won at least one more round if not for the eyepoke.

It definitely would've been close either way, these are two of the best in the world versus each other.
That constant pressure would force Lawler into swanging and banging.... Fuuuuuck 
Defending a belt is completely different to challenging for the belt.

Defending a belt is having everything to lose and also continuously fighting the best and most worthy who have spent a lot of time gameplanning and watching you fight. It is having a giant target on your back.

Challenging and beating the champion is nothing compared to a streak of title defenses.
It was a BvS joke
Also Nate's wrestling is nothing compared to Chad Mendes' or Frankie Edgar's, and Chad could barely get Jose down and certainly couldn't hold him down and Frankie got thrown around like a kid by Jose. I think Nate will have a very hard time taking Jose down.
Where'd you hear this? That sounds seriously bad
No, it was because Uriah asked TJ at a barbeque that the two were having with their wives and Uriah directly asked TJ if the rumours were true and TJ said no then bounced like the day later
Wouldn't say it's as simple as ducking

GSP: Is being selective in who he comes back to fight

Nick Diaz: Doesn't want to take the Lawler fight unless it's for serious money

Maia: Deserves a title shot. Shouldn't have to fight Lawler to get it.
I like AMOLED with on screen buttons. The burn in is mild so you don't notice it, and it means you can get a free replacement near the end of your warranty. Perfect.
Also Holly works great on the counter against aggressive opponents as we saw against Ronda. I can see Holly beating Nunes.
Also cause he was training at Glendale. He's switched to King's though.
Three letters. G. S. P.
Aldo hasn't said he isn't waiting for Holloway. Last thing he said he was gonna do was do the fight with Holloway, and then move up to fight Conor. Then Holloway backed off with a bunch of excuses and since then Jose hasn't said anything about not fighting Holloway...
It was cool that Khabib offered. It was badass. Tony also did the right thing by not taking that offer. They're not mutually exclusive.
Ayoooooo
The rules say a 10-8 should be *considered* in that scenario though, not necessarily granted.
Like other people said Aldo admitted Conor beat him, it was a poor translation.
Anik would've short-circuited and melted down. Miesha by simulated death.

Swanson
Defending a belt nine times is different to a nine fight win streak. Defending a belt is having everything to lose and also fighting the best and most worthy, whilst having a win streak doesn't usually mean that.
Disagree. Thompson is a puzzle, and Rory decided to play the smart fight. If the UFC had given Rory a more conventional opponent I have no doubt Rory would've taken that easily.
Jon should accept the BJJ match on the condition that Danis meets him in the octagon when his suspension is up. I'd pay to watch Danis beg Jones to stop his beating.
Tony does that, he's making fun of that
Yeah but didn't he call Aldo out again like 2 days ago? Lolol
Aldo tried in his UFC 200 post fight IIRC
Not only that, but you wake up disoriented on cold canvas in the middle of a fenced cage with bright lights flashing every where and massive crowds cheering and chanting... It'd kinda be scary as fuck
Google definition of stagger:

Sounds fine to me.
could have been an adrenaline dump from celebrating his win to having to get back into the cage for another 5 min. of course it could also just be anderson being anderson.
It's not like it was a mystery. Big right hand, that's it.

Ok. Forget the CW belts. Let's look at the UFC belts.

Conor wins the FW belt. Instead of defending it against what should have been an instant rematch for Jose (or a defense against Frankie), Conor moves up to fight RDA, but RDA drops out and he fights Nate Diaz, loses, getting choked out in the second. Now Jose takes the interim belt against Frankie, schooling the number 2 contender. Conor fights Nate again, because he's "obsessed". He scrapes by and wins 48-47 (good fight, but it shouldn't have happened immediately). Conor gets his instant rematch against #5 LW Nate Diaz for no belt, but Jose doesn't get his instant rematch against Conor after holding the FW belt since 2009 and not being defeated since 2006? Ok, now Conor gets gifted a title fight with Eddie, having gone 1-1 against a #5 LW, being choked out in the second round in the first fight and winning 3 rounds to 2 in the second fight. Still not defending against Jose, the interim champ, or Holloway, who's on a 9 fight win streak. Unbelievable.

Look, I like Conor. Him not defending the belt though is pretty annoying. He literally hasn't said anything about defending against Khabib or Tony, both deserving contenders.
2 CW titles, 2 UFC titles. How many defenses? I'll let you do the math.
The way we could have found out is if McG defended a belt of his for the first time in his life - disputed, might I add - against the interim champion.
This is why the rematch needs to happen. JDS knocked Cain out, then Cain savagely beat JDS for almost 50 minutes. It's MMA, anything can happen. I'm not saying that would've happened in Aldo v McG II, but they were (are?) the best featherweights on the planet and honestly I don't understand why people don't want to see the best fight the best.
He was scooting it out of the way. Should have used his hands but he also just came out of a 25 minute war and is in the middle of being interviewed so its understandable
It probably thought you misspelled "beacon" for the police siren when you searched "bacon"
It thought he might've misspelled "beacon".
I'm a big fan of Conor's walkout, the mix of Sinead with Biggie is great. Sinead live, however, was a letdown. The performance was extremely lacking; apparently her audio equipment wasn't working properly.
It was close in that RDA literally only needed one round to win the bout, and no round was a 10-8 iirc. I also disagree that Dos Anjos didn't have an answer. He won two rounds, how would he do that if he didn't have an answer? The momentum also clearly shifted into Tony's direction *after* the eyepoke, and like I said since they are so competitive and are around the same level skill wise an eye poke would have been extremely damaging to RDA's chances of getting that third round.
Kennedy too I think
RDA v. Ferguson was close. I had it a solid 48-47, and RDA was looking lost after the giant eye poke, not especially before. When you're fighting someone like Tony Ferguson, an eye poke can definitely swing the fight.
Nah. Imo Pettis should be fighting lesser competition; he's been getting crushed in his fights and has been jumping around weightclasses etc. RDA got caught by Eddie but was looking great up until then, and lost a close decision to Ferguson after a huge eye poke. I'd say Dos Anjos v. Alvarez II, and Pettis v. someone just outside of the top 10 at 155.
What do you mean Aldo won't take fights? Last I heard he said he wanted the winner of Aldo/Holloway and then a rematch with McG.
Nah, I could see Holloway pulling gangster shit like stand and bang. Definitely could be an amazing fight
Nah, Woodley took Wonderboy to a draw and I don't think Cowboy is on the same level as Wonderboy
I'd give the first to Choi. 29-28 Swanson.

Did you see the comments on the post?
I was thinking screwdriver
Jose defended his title for six years and was undefeated for like a decade. Conor hasn't defended once. Yeah, Aldo is the FW GOAT for sure.
Fun fact from the article

>The Morgan Stanley note also estimates the Pixel will be half as profitable for Google as the iPhone is to Apple, thanks to the former device's higher cost of materials.

>The Pixel phone will generate a 22%-25% gross profit margin, the note says, varying according to the model. For perspective, the iPhone 7's gross margin is at around 41%, but this has notably declined from 57.7% in 2009.

What problems with Drive? Just curious. The thing I like about Photos/Drive is I don't have to hit save, I don't have to think about it at all. It's always automatically instantly saved and instantly accessible from any device connected to the internet.
Thank you, exactly. McG is certainly a better fighter after his Diaz fights, but him destroying Alvarez in prime form is just classic Conor mauling someone with a height and reach disadvantage. That's not to take anything away from his accomplishments though.
Not disagreeing with you but everyone always mentions Mendes, which is a poor example imo. Frankie's left hook grazed Mendes' nose, and Mendes was KO from the snap not the power. It was more about the precision and not the power.

Have you tried Google Photos? By far the best photo service in my opinion.
Fine. Challenge Woodley. Assuming he wins, drop down to FW for Aldo v. McG II.
He was pulled because he made the conscious decision to not attend the press conference, KNOWING that they would pull him out

>the only mistake Clinton made was trusting other people at State not to send her classified information.

Wrong.

>For example, seven e-mail chains concern matters that were classified at the Top Secret/Special Access Program level when they were sent and received. These chains involved Secretary Clinton **both sending e-mails about those matters and receiving e-mails from others about the same matters.**

Not to mention the months and months of lying and blatant lawyer-speak to dodge the truth. That's not a mistake in your mind?

********************

>No evidence of intentional mishandling

You're right about how there was no evidence of intentional mishandling. Let's let Comey weigh in on this, however:

>There is evidence to support a conclusion that **any reasonable person** in Secretary Clinton’s position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding about these matters, **should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation**.

[Source: FBI.gov](https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system)

********************

>No laws were broken.

You don't know that.

[Potential violations of statutes](http://www.factcheck.org/2016/07/a-guide-to-clintons-emails/)

>Comey said the FBI found evidence of “potential violations” of federal law, but such cases are generally not prosecuted. “Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case,” Comey said.

>It’s clear, though, that she violated department policies. Comey said, “To be clear, this is not to suggest that in similar circumstances a person who engaged in this activity would face no consequences. To the contrary, those individuals are often subject to security or administrative sanctions. But that is not what we are deciding now.”

Even if she didn't break the law itself, she certainly violated the spirit of it in many people's eyes.

[Federal Records Act](http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/04/02/396823014/fact-check-hillary-clinton-those-emails-and-the-law)

>Watchdog groups conceded that she may not have violated the text of the law, but they argue she violated the spirit of it. The Sunlight Foundation's John Wonderlich explained to Horsley:

>"[O]ur expectations for public service are [that] public servants use their official email accounts."
Wonderlich also found it ethically challenged, if not legally, for Clinton and her team to have been the filter for her emails:

>"The final arbiter of what's public or what's turned over to Congress shouldn't be private staff working for Hillary Clinton. It should be State Department employees who are bound by duty to the public interest."

********************

It’s sad that our standards for President of the United States, Leader of the Free World, the most powerful person on this planet have fallen to "not indicted" and "not a blatant racist misogynist".

Either way, this is to some people an indicator of a blatant disregard for honesty, for government transparency and an indicator that Hillary Clinton thinks she is above the rules (yes, she did break State Department rules). It's a sticking point for some people. Get used to it.


[FOIA](http://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/04/02/396823014/fact-check-hillary-clinton-those-emails-and-the-law)

>Nonetheless, Dan Metcalfe, who was the head of the Justice Department's Office of Information and Privacy from 1981 to 2007, blasted Clinton in an op-ed in Politico. He said what was "unprecedented" actually was Clinton's exclusive use of private email and her own Internet service provider in lieu of an official account "so that the records of her email account would reside solely within her personal control at home."

>That means "she managed successfully to insulate her official emails, categorically, from the FOIA, both during her tenure at State and long after her departure from it — perhaps forever." He called that "a blatant circumvention of the FOIA by someone who unquestionably knows better."

********************

Back to my original point anyway.

>People are right to patronize and mock the people who made a big deal out of the emails.

Those people are a huge reason why Hillary Clinton lost the presidency. Instead of attempting to reach out to other people and trying to convince them that the email situation is not as big of a deal as a Trump presidency with logical facts and sincere attempts to change people's minds, many Hillary supporters were snarky know-it-alls busy patronizing others and labeling them as sexist bigots. And now we have a Donald Trump presidency. HAHAHA.

You know, it's kinda funny how things have changed. Bernie supporters were the ones originally complaining about the unfair system, about the unfair media and Hillary supporters were adamant that Bernie supporters were crazy. And now that she's lost, all of a sudden it's turned to OMG ELECTORAL COLLEGE SYSTEM IS UNFAIR!!!! RIGGED RIGGED RIGGED POPULAR VOTE OMG LET'S GET THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE TO MAKE HILLARY PRESIDENT ANYWAY!!!!! OMG MEDIA MADE SUCH A BIG DEAL OUT OF THE EMAILS IT WASN'T THAT BIG!!!!!

Fucking hypocrites. They deserve Donald Trump as their president.
And also he's the interim champ and it seems like the UFC doesn't give a fuck about uniting the belts.
Politics as usual = establishment politics = big reason why Hillary lost

The same people that patronize and make light of issues that other people consider important ("Emails!") are the same people shocked that Hillary lost.
[Right, totally](https://scontent-sjc2-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/p750x750/15099523_331571163885767_4464838200359124992_n.jpg)
Jose is also the interim champ though, while Khabib is not.
I think his late career resurgence is due to heading to King's/Cordeiro. His loss to Eddie was him getting caught which could always happen especially with his pressure-heavy style and his loss to Ferguson imo was a little due to the eye-poke and a lot due to the fact that Ferguson is an unpredictable pressure-heavy beast.

Post USADA his build also hasn't changed at all, and he was still impressive when he was going last night.
And it seems like he has camp issues.
Did a lot better than against Lobov but still really badly
McG is gonna sell no matter what. Personally I think since Jose is the interim champ and dominated the division for so long this should be a no brainer, regardless of "how hard it is to sell to the casual audience".
Unless she thought she could stop the fight with the takedowns and gnp.
>mostly software

Exactly. You can get 95% of the way there, but that 5% is extremely noticeable.

Also, snappiness on the 6P took a big hit because of the 810 i.e. hardware. We don't know why the 6P lags opening up the camera unlike the Pixel, but it's likely due to a combination of software and hardware. Quality of photos is molding software to hardware.

You can't separate the two like that. Google obviously spent a lot of time optimizing the software for this specific hardware, just like Apple does. That's the key. It's not just oh let's magically improve the code so every single variation of every single manufacturer's phones runs buttery smooth.
Check out r/Googlepixel. The phone is just really smooth and fast. It doesn't heat up, the camera launches fast, and the battery runs consistently and for a long time. Like I said. You really have to use it to get it. If you have the spare cash and I were you I'd just get the phone and try it out within the return window.
Used a 6P extensively, now on a Pixel. The two phones feel very different. You really have to use it to get it.
This is just anecdotal of course but the Pixel runs unbelievably fast. Personally I found the 6P to be a little janky even out of the box, and sometimes even slower than the 5X, likely due to the piece of shit they call the 810.

There's no Android phone like the Pixel. I wasn't that excited for it even though I preordered, and man, I'm a believer now. Whatever Google did, touch latency, 821, whatever it was, it fucking works. This thing is speedy as fuck.

As for the lagging after a couple of months, I've never had that issue with stock Android phones. Sense, Touchwiz, those would definitely slow. It could be due to my clearing of app cache every couple of months as I ran out of storage space though.
That's not true. Those aren't screenshot buttons, they share links. The screenshot option is gone in the Pixel. Source: I have a Pixel.
Source? [It looks like Herb Dean is in the back](https://gfycat.com/MeanHiddenAmericanriverotter) so I don't see why Cain would've thought they were going into the centre
I know exactly what video you're talking about. Everyone refers to that but I think someone in r/MMA noted that he was demonstrating something to Gunni and it wasn't related to Aldo. Either way, I'm not saying it was a fluke. All I'm saying is McG talks a lot of shit, is a good counter striker, observed a flaw in Aldo's game and got a bit lucky that everything came together perfectly and some of the shit he said stuck.

Edit which seems to be a lot of what you're saying too, so let's just drop this lol
It would be over in the first exchange is one of many claims Conor made about the fight. Before every fight he makes many claims, some of which contradict each other. Many times, the shit he says doesn't even come true. See Diaz. I think this is pretty well summed up as "throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks".
