You buy a normal tripod and just stuff your money and credit cards in one of the legs and carry it around with you. 
It does feel just a little too big, personally. I mentioned in another comment that I had the X at one point and that was practically a perfect sized phone for me. Big screen, small(ish) package.
Doing my duty. 
I wish!
I personally didn’t like it because it couldn’t match the convenience of unlocking the phone flat on a desk with Touch ID. 
You don’t like boxes?
Wow. What?
🤷🏻‍♂️

Some people care too much sometimes. 
Thanks! And I did! Though I do really like how the 8 feels in the hand. 
Thanks. It’s pretty striking. I really like it. 
Today OP was pretty cool.  
Though I agree they are (and most flagship phones) are expensive, they’re within our means to get, so we did. 
Yup!
I had the X for a month. I didn’t care for Face ID. 
You’re welcome. 
How clicky are the Samsung case buttons? As good as Apple’s I hope. 
It’s only from videos taken from the camera(s). Online videos play fine, like YouTube or web based videos. But just camera videos are not playing correctly. 
Ok so I put LOS on my Essential and whenever I try and play a video from any camera app, it freezes the video but continues to play the audio. Tried it with Lineage camera, Gcam, and Essential camera. They all do it. 

Would you have any idea wtf is going on? My google searching has not found anything related to my issue. 
What, no toast?

Honestly, I missed my Note going to the S9+. I only really used the S-Pen for fun here and there, but I really got used to the fingerprint sensor placement and I love the square design of the phone. 

I will say that I did get better battery life out of the S9+ though. I have the blue version and it looked really nice. But I did like my Note a lot. Probably my favorite Android phone ever.

They send you simple survey questions for market use, but you get monetary compensation for it.

That's pretty much what I figured. And that’s fine. Not really a huge issue, I just wondered if there was something quick and easy I could do. 
It's treason then!
How do you live your life if this is important to you?
They may not be great for durability, but I will say that they are probably the best case with the clickest buttons.
Even if you found one or wouldn't be safe to use. If you use wireless charging with any phone there shouldn't be any metal between the phone and charging pad. It creates heat and can be dangerous.

Unless you mean a battery case with wireless charging built into to the to charge the case itself. In which case I've never seen one like that.
Got a reliable link how to install Lineage?
Does lineage improve the jittery-ness of the screen?

I got a Gcam port recently and its so much faster and better. If I can fix the jittery screen I would go back to the Essential as my daily driver in a heartbeat.
Do the silicone cases collect dust easily from your pocket?
Ya I have JoD. 

Went from iPhone 7+ -> iPhone SE -> iPhone 8 -> iPhone X -> Samsung J7 when I purchased the Essential phone and to keep JOD -> Note 8 -> Galaxy S9+

And here I am thinking of getting the red iPhone soon...
Annually? Since August I'm on my 7th phone lol.

"It just works."
Unbox Therapys fucking face in those thumbnails actually angers me.
I've found that on the S8, Note 8, and now my S9+, Nova launcher makes some animations smoother than Samsung's default launcher.
Funny because my S9+ can accomplish the 3D touch with long presses, it has live photos, is so much smoother than when I had an iPhone X, and Android is so much more stable than iOS has been.

😂🤣
I use Nova launcher and the default SE theme. What about the default launcher do you like over Nova? 

I personally keep it simple in Nova. Looks pretty similar to default. I just like the added features or convenience Nova gives.
I think looking at just the hours like that is not an accurate measurement. Because there could be many factors to what is draining your battery in the background, as well as the sort of use you are doing with your phone. 

It's just showing you an estimate, so I'm guessing that if you use your phone heavy one or a couple days in a row, it'll show you less hours estimated battery life compared to if you were a light user.

The reason screen on time is a good measurement is because it's literally showing you the battery life when the screen is on and in use (so when you're actually using the phone to browse Reddit or watch YouTube or something). Not just sitting on your counter or in your pocket not in use, but still slightly draining battery.
I actually tested my battery for the first time on any phone just the other day. I let my S9+ get down to 2% before charging and I had 7 hours SoT. I don't have any battery saving on, I use AoD, I have max display settings on, brightness is auto but usually around 75%, WiFi and Bluetooth on.

I was blown away by it. Maybe it's not the best SoT you'll see in this subreddit, but I was more than happy with it.
If you slide the notification a little too the right and click on the gear cog, you should be able to disable the notification for that app.
I use this and I think it feels pretty damn close to my co-workers iPhone X Apple leather case:

And just like that, he learned that water gives no fucks.
"At Apple, we know your dumbass will drop our expensive shit. So we designed it using only the heaviest of glass, the butter to our bread. This means when it inevitably falls, it'll land completely flat, dispersing all shock equally throughout the phone. The result is a near unbreakable screen. Or a completely shattered $500 fix. We're not sure, but you won't leave iMessage for that chance anyway."
I'm so proud of Linda. 
No

I can only assume because it landed completely flat (by design???) 

This is my favorite part lol

I'm using this:

Galaxy S9 Plus Case, S9+ case, Belk Premium Vintage Series Protective Rugged Back Case covered by PU Leather Classical Business Style Cover for Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus / S9+ 2018 release Blue https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0792X5JB5?ref=yo_pop_ma_swf

It's not quite .3mm minimal, but I find the leather feels pretty nice, especially for the price.

I held my co-workers iPhone X with the official Apple leather case on (blue as well) and I honestly thought both cases felt very similar.

My mistake. I read what you said as a normal plan, not the 55+ plan.
Fair enough. But even still, I can't find that plan at $70. It only shows me $60/line. 

Can you provide a link where I can get this deal?
That's what I thought too and I was thinking, "ya, sounds about right". 
So "as an engineer", as you've so delicately said 3 times as a mother would with her divine perspective on any topic, please explain why my iPhone 8 or iPhone X would always reload so many apps? Nothing ever seemed to be ready to use going from app to app. Shit was so annoying. I have not had anything close to the same issue on the Note 8 or S9+. 

Also, the current shit show that is iOS 11 is so bad I can't take anyone seriously when they still try to defend it and say it's more optimized and "just works". This is the buggiest, worst iOS to date and it literally made me go back to Android. I have had absolutely zero issues on Android and find it's a much smoother experience.

I'm genuinely curious what n*ggas be like.
Rear window of your ~~crossover SUV~~ Subaru seems like the perfect place.
Yes
I hope it gets better.

I'm turning my phone on in my dark bedroom and it auto sets to like 40% brightness. I turn it all the way down. Then I can immediately turn my screen off and back on and it sets itself back to 40% brightness. In a fucking pitch black room.

Wtf. Like looking into the sun, Samsung.
I did.

Went from iPhone X to an Essential, then a Note 8, now a Galaxy S9+ (I have JoD through T-Mobile, but purchased the Essential). 

I haven't had really any bugs whatsoever in my Galaxy phones. And pretty much everyone else in my life uses iPhone and regular SMS/MMS texting really hasn't been an issue. The only person I send images or videos to are to my wife and I convinced her to use Allo just for that purpose.

I honestly couldn't be happier to be back on Android and on such premium phones without all of the iOS 11 bullshit.
Good to know. My coworker has the Apple leather case on his iPhone X and those buttons are so clicky I love it. I want something like that on my Galaxy.
How clicky are the buttons? The tactile-ness of buttons are almost more important to me that anything ride on a case.
Not so much worried but I would get in touch with either Samsung or your carrier soon about a swap.
What exactly were the updates?
Please someone report back about the screen jitter and say if it's improved at all!

Or any camera update to stability!
I'm not in the eco system, but I had a good amount of iPhones over the recent years. I love them still and there's no don't they're more polished hardware and software wise than 90% of Android phones. 

But man, I've been saying this since iOS 10.X, and especially during the wrath of iOS 11, the bugs and freak outs and unstable shit that has been going on with iPhone literally turned me to go Android. And I haven't been happier.

But I'm anxiously waiting to see what comes September for the next iPhone. So we'll see.
Yes I've seen the scores. But like I've seen other people mention in the past, numbers aren't everything. 

I've owned both the iPhone 8 and X, and my normal, real life day to day is better, more efficient, and way more stable on my Note 8 than either of those phones ever were. And the Note has lower scores too.
No, man. Come on. I only bless the rains down in Africa.

Like others have said, with JOD you cannot upgrade on T-Mobiles website. You have to call customer care or do it through T-Force on Twitter. I haven't tried doing it through the T-Mobile app, but that could be a possibility.
Well I figured as much with your name.
Hey, I live in (metro) Detroit!
Is it though?
Like others have said, I have JOD through T-Mobile, so I'm getting the S9+. If I don't like it I'll go back to the Note 8 until the Note 9 comes out (if that's worth it).
"It just works"
Usage is not screen on time.
I understand where you're coming from, and honestly I was you. My previous Android phones were just not up to par with iPhone. That's why I kept going back. But this past year and I iOS 11 just sucked the life out of iPhone for me.

You're right in also saying Android had become much more stable, so I don't have to worry about common things like dropped calls and such.

But I disagree with you saying things like AOD and the S-Pen are gimmicks. To me they're conveniences. I hated the finger print sensor on the S8 because I was so used to the home button on iPhone, but now I'm totally used to, and actually like, the finger print sensor on my Note. And it's even farther away than what the S8 has. So for me, these are great features that I may not use all the time, but I'm glad they're there.

You can purchase it on Amazon, at least in the US you can.

Don't play with my emotions like that. For real they did? I may have to call customer service back today and check.
Wait... How do we know you didn't plant u/showmeurrgenitals as a heckler?!
No case. 
Yup. It's on the mega thread. The S9+ has a down payment for everyone. Oh well though.
Well my Essential is my backup phone. I have no issues with using that cable on my Note 8. So that's weird.
So it seems you're wrong on the no down payment for the S9+...
Do you always talk out of your ass and sound like a pompous dick, or just today?
I don't even care about benchmarks anymore. In have a Note 8 which I'm sure got destroyed by iPhone 8 and X, but I had an iPhone 8 and X and I'm so much happier with my Note in pretty much every way. 

Actual, regular daily use the Note has been a better, quicker, much more stable phone the even there iPhone X ever was when I had it. 

Also benchmarks don't mean much when your OS (iOS 11) is a dumpster fire.
I thought for sure you had a stroke when writing this.
While iPhones have usually slaughtered Androids for years, I couldn't get over the shit that still currently is iOS 11. Went back to Android (Note 8) and haven't experienced hardly any issues, especially no where near as many or as bad as iOS.

It's all personally preference of course. But to think pure benchmarks will mean a phone is totally and completely better than what it beat is kinda silly.
Awesome, thanks!
I am on JOD and didn't have a down payment for the iPhone X either. 

So for sure I won't have a down payment for the S9+? Because I've had conflicting responses in this subreddit about it.
When will they be on display?

Also, is it confirmed that all customers must pay a down payment for the S9+? Even if you qualify for the top tier credit and have been a customer longer than 3 years?
I know it's not a fair comparison, but how was the Moto compared to the Note? As far as camera and things like scroll fluidity and speed.

I thought about trying out the Moto, and I love the Note, but I don't like the price.
Why did you go back to the Moto from the Note?
I'm blaming you that I own a Note 8!
This is very informative, and a little upsetting since the down payment will be a deal breaker for me. I jump too often to justify any up front costs. But thank you for clearing this up for me.

I've never heard of the police joe. What do they do?
This is a possibility, yes. But I'm assuming I won't only because I didn't have a down payment when I jumped to the iPhone X. 
Awesome, thanks!
I thought there was some sort of stipulation that you couldn't jump to a phone you previously owned? I mean like the exact same one.

You're wrong. On Mohs Scale of hardness, the higher a material is in the scale, the more resistant to scratches it'll be, but it'll be more fragile to breaking if dropped or hit with force.

So even if Apple, or any manufacturer really, decided to use even diamond for their screen, nothing would be able to scratch it, but you dropped it, it would still shatter.
Apple's marketing bullshit about being "the strongest glass" doesn't do anything for fragility or breaking, just scratch resistance.

This comparison is completely pointless. The Pixel brand is only a year and a half old. iPhone is 10 years old. Even the Nexus brand is what...5 years old at best?

And there are so many other Android manufactures, whereas Apple makes one phone.

I guess I just don't see the point of this post.
Ya I recently found this feature too, but personally I don't like it. Anyway to turn it off?
lmao how to: get ~~rid of~~ brain damage
Most everything was an upgrade. I didn't like their version of iMessage though, it could be better. And the blue color in the settings is terrible. It gives bad contrast and some readability issues, and the color doesn't really go with Apple in any way.

Otherwise a very well made video.
Jesus fucking Christ lol
Definitely the brand. "Everything Apple makes is superior and more expensive" mentality. 
How old are you? Because I've been back and forth between Android and iOS many times over the last couple of years and no one ever gives me shit when I'm on Android.

But I'm 35 and married. 

To me this whole "green bubble" issue is something younger people do to be exclusive. Even if they're on their iPhone 5c getting green bubbles from someone in a Note 8. To them, green bubbles still means poor person.

Who cares. 
Oh look, a made up statistic.

Aside from the camera in the S9, I think there new processor may be one if the few things I know that is new. TouchWiz has become Samsung Experience, maybe with the S8? It's a lot better than what it used to be. But you are correct in thinking that the Pixel will be vanilla Android and receive updates first.

That's on you deciding what you want from a phone. Cost, design, camera, battery life. The Note and S9 will offer more features than stock Android, and some welcome those features; some don't. The Pixel camera I think is the best smart phone camera on the market, even better than the iPhone 8/X.
If you check out r/Android the Galaxy S9 has been leaked already. Not much of a design change but supposedly a pretty big camera upgrade. 

It'll officially be unveiled at MWC at the end of this month with a tentative release date a couple weeks after. 
I've been in several Android flagships in the past and none have seemed to get the smoothness of iOS (though I've never tried a Pixel). However with iOS 11 and the disappointment of using the same design in the 8, I wanted to give Android a try again and went for the big dog.

The Note is by far my best Android experience ever. As smooth as iOS hands down. More features than iOS (even if I don't use all of them). I still prefer a finger print sensor or even a pattern (or just more options really) instead of being pigeon holed into face ID. 

I use the S-Pen from time to time and it's a nice feature to have. Discord works much better on Android, which is great for me since I use it a lot. 

I haven't really had any bugs whatsoever either, especially compared to iOS 11. The Note has honestly surprised me how great of a smart phone it has been.
Wanted to go back to Android after the shitstorm of iOS 11. And I wasn't happy with the decision to use the same design again with the ~~6, 6s, 7~~, 8. The X was cool and all, but not for the price (IMO). 

For almost the same price as the X, I feel like the Note gives me so much more. 
On the contrary, I've had more iPhones and really rather prefer iOS. But iOS 11 left a sour taste in my mouth and I think the X is really over priced for what it offers. 

I've been back and forth between Android and iOS many times over the last few years too, so I'm familiar with both.
Why did you move from the Note to the X?

I went the other way, going from the X to the Note and I couldn't be happier. 
Just in time for February.

Yarr! That booty not be worth the laziness!
Funny, the very reason I switched off of iOS is because of how bad 11 has been. 
Though people are correct in saying Snapchat is pretty bad in general on Android and not as optimized compared to iPhone, Snapchat is much worse on my Essential compared to on my Note 8. So you're correct in thinking it's shitty on your phone. 
Were you coming from iOS before getting the Note?

I had an iPhone X when it released and am now on the Note and the Note is way superior to the X in almost every way. To me, this is hands down the best phone I've ever had. And I've had a lot of flagship phones in my recent years.
The Jew fro guy from Zack and Miri?
You can't. I made it.
"New" lineup. 

Exact same as 2017. 
You touch the screen with your finger or S-Pen. 
I have the Essential but switched to a Note 8 after a month of using it. 

Overall the phone is good, but I'm too picky about phones and what I expect out of them.

Personally the industrial design is top notch, one of the best easily. Software is good, the scroll jank is real but I honestly didn't mind it too much. But the camera was just too unreliable. When it worked, still images were pretty good, portrait mode I think is really good, better than iPhone. But the stock camera just takes forever to open sometimes and taking the photo and saving the photo takes forever compared to current mid range and flagship phones. It would also crash more than I'd like to say. And personally that's a deal breaker for me since I take a lot of photos.

Since being on the Note, this is by far the best Android experience I've ever had. I don't like the price or my monthly bill from it, but that's the price you pay for quality.

To each their own though. I think the Essential is a step down from the Note, and that's fine. You just have to be aware of the differences between them and make sure it's right for you.
Fuck, man. I had to read it 5 times before I understood what the hell they were trying to say.
Almost r/boottoobig material, in sense. 
"Gone utterly awry!"
Honestly I had the same issues with both the iPhone 8 and X she I had them. I thought it was strange so many apps were reloading. 

I don't have this issue on my Note 8 at all.
I mean, it worked out for them for a little while.

There's a non-gay way?!
I thought the same as you about the jank and scrolling lag. But now I'm on the Note 8, and still have my Essential, there is a world of a difference in smoothness between the 2. 
Dammit
I saw on Erica Griffin's review of the Note that even if you hide the Navi bar and don't see the home button icon, you can still press hard on where it would be and it'll work and take you to your home screen. You'll even get there haptic feedback when you press it.
Why?

Or was there something specific about the Note you didn't like?
Why do you want to jump out of the Note 8? I'm waiting for my jump to be available in a couple weeks to jump to it.
So the service was not a slam dunk, but how is the phone after getting the new battery?
Can anyone chime in with their experience with these? I've been thinking about getting a Google Home Mini and maybe a Roku. I'm sure this will be just as good or better because they're both Amazon products. But are they worth it? Do they work seamlessly and fast?

But... The Android app is working much better compared to the iOS version here.

While there may be truth in some things you say, the fact is that Apple actually admitted to doing this, and no one else has. 

So you're basing this post on assumptions. *"Ok, Apple throttles their old phones. Android does it too!"*

Do they? Maybe Samsung, maybe not. Does LG, or HTC, or Motorola? It just sounds like you're trying to justify Apple by hypothetically passing the buck that Android does it too.

I think it's shitty that Apple does this. I don't see how throttling their phones to an almost unusable point is "better for the customer". Apple is a business, and like every business, they're in the business of making money.

Would it better for them as a business to find a cheaper way to fix their old phones that'll benefit the customer? Definitely. But why do that when you can practically force people to buy their latest phone instead of fixing their current one?
I love iPhone and iOS, but after iOS 11 I was extremely unhappy. 

I switched to Android and though there are things I still miss even with the mess that iOS currently has, I'm pretty happy on Android. 
Even with the dumpster fire that is iOS 11, if you are integrated in their eco system, it'll definitely work better than an Android phone.

I hope you have a good experience with the Essential phone!
Do you still have an iPhone and are thinking of switching? Or did you already switch and have Apple products you don't use (well you can still use everything except the Apple watch I suppose)?
Are you saying that when I am in settings and you see GSM/WCDMA/LTE that I should select that option?
I switched from iPhone X to the Essential, and having an iPhone 8 before that, and iPhone 7 plus before that.

First of all I mainly switched to save money because I got the Essential so cheap.

The biggest difference is the overall smoothness compared to iOS. This is not new and is usually seen in just about any Android phone. Now I haven't had an Android phone since the Galaxy S8 released (and returned it 3 weeks later)  so I can't compare how to is to that. 

People say there still is scroll jank or lag, and it happens for sure. However, I was really unhappy with iOS 11 because iOS lost a lot of its flow and overall perfect smoothness.  My iPhone (and many others as seen over on r/iphone) would have many bugs, shit would freak out, apps wouldn't open. I still get that with the Essential phone, but like I said, I'm saving on my monthly bill by having this phone.

I will say that it is refreshing to be on Android again. I'm learning new things about it I didn't know back when I had the S8. Overall I really like this phone and Android. You'll miss iMessage and the camera speed. Essential has been updating their camera and I've actually gotten really good shots. I prefer their Portrait Mode over iPhone. It has much better edge detection. But the overall feel and speed of taking and saving a photo is a lot slower. 

The phone feels great, it's a beautiful design. Pretty slippery without a case, but no more than the glass back iPhone 8/X. 

I would say go for it. 
What is your date/weather app?
What's the current price of OVRY?
Ah yes, the highly anticipated Essential PhTwo
Unfortunately this is working as intended. The only fix is the bullshit you have to do yourself that others mentioned: jailbreak or turn off notifications. 
Why is Inbox better than Gmail?
What are your camera settings?

I have this camera app on my Essential phone, and have tried several different configurations, but the quality isn't that great and it crashes constantly.
Lol 
Do you?

If it makes you feel any better I was able to buy the phone for only $100. 
It is a white one and it looks amazing! So clean.

What is the TalkBack setting do? I turned TalkBack on to go into settings and I could barely navigate my phone because of how Talkback works. I couldn't scroll and got scared I wouldn't be able to turn it off.

So what does what your recommend do and how do I do it?
Holy shit, me too. I have a hard time writing the number 3 too, it's the motion to do it. My brain actually hurts when I try to do it. And since the S is a similar curving motion, I have a hard time writing that too. 

I was able to train myself to write the S from the bottom, but I still severely struggle writing a 3 in any fashion. 
To my knowledge, you're correct on both ways. Though I haven't heard of anyone trying the mail-return way though. 
The madman!
I will be doing that this week I think. My Essential phone is coming Tuesday and am looking to get out of JOD. 

Did you just order a new Jump via phone and afterwards go turn in your old phone to the store?
Dude, I watched Guardians 2 on a plane and was laughing out loud so much. But that scene, I was fighting so hard to not burst into tears right in front of everyone. 
How was the shutter speed? Any lag?
How did you order it? Calling customer service?
Super. I’m an industrial designer too and I think Apple is making pretty bad decisions lately (lately over the last couple of years)
Do you just suck Apple’s dick on everything they do or are you just a delusional asshole in general?
Jesus Christ Apple, why did you put in the B-Squad to make iOS 11?
Unless you have an iPhone 8 or X, there are literally only 5 options for the regular recording mode. If you think that’s too confusing for iPhone users, you must not think very highly of them. 
I can’t remember how many times I wanted to change my slow mo from 120fps to 240fps within the camera app, but can’t because Apple is stupid and makes things “simpler” by creating more steps. 
Come for the workout, stay for the pegging!
That’s good to hear. Over on r/essential every time someone mentions T-Mobile it’s always how bad reception. 

I’m looking forward to getting the PH-1, and though I know it’s not perfect, I really can’t pass up the deal I’m getting.

TL;DW?
At the time iOS was on 10.x and was a lot smoother than iOS 11 is now. So I was used to that. 

I really didn’t like the fingerprint sensor placement, tried iris scanner and didn’t work too well. However in hind sight I should have tried the face scanner. 

Everyone I know uses iPhone so I missed iMessage. 

I really like the design is the S8 much more than the iPhone by far. The screen was just amazing. Great, fast camera. 
Just this year alone I went from an iPhone 7 -> Galaxy S8 -> iPhone 7+ -> iPhone SE -> iPhone 8 -> iPhone X
This is the right answer.  
?
iPhone X. It’s usually just the edges aren’t very refined. 
Yes I know this. However even when there is a clear subject with great natural lighting, I have had the Portrait Mode blur part of the subject on the same plane as a non-blurred part. 
I tell ya hwhat 
Like a fingerprint sensor?

Sorry for the confusion! I didn’t mean I hope you work on the transitions, I meant the phone manufacturers. I hope they realize that a gradual transistor into slow-mo is nicer than the current way they have it. 
I currently have an iPhone X on lease through T-Mobile. I can get (and am getting) an Essential for $100. I understand it’s not going to be even in the same ballpark as the iPhone in terms of software reliability or smoothness, but overall do you think ill adjust t it’s “quirks” or will I absolutely hate it?

I’ve used both iOS and Android over the last few years so navigating the OS isn’t an issue. 
Great video!

One thing I hope gets worked on in the future for all slow-mo video is the transition from regular speed to slow motion. It’s such a hard break going into and out of the slow motion. If it were a gradual transition it would look so much better. 
Because there’s more to a phone then how you show notifications?
Courage
Would you say all other companies that include the fast charging brick with their phones are all doing it wrong?
How else could they milk their loyal customers then?
Gets you that sweet, sweet YouTube money. 
The real trick is to stretch out your 3 steps out to hit that 10 min YouTube mark. 
That clickbait title though. 
I currently have the iPhone X but am getting the Essential in the next couple of weeks. After reading some of the current issues with the software and camera, I'm a little scared I won't like it. But I'm getting rid of the iPhone and keeping the Essential to save some money (I'm leasing the X).

How has your transition been from not just iOS, but the iPhone X to the Essential phone?
I understand what you’re trying to say, and there’s no way to do it that I know of. At least not from the phone. Google is probably your best bet.

“Let me jus.....I need to...lie down for a sec.”
Yes I do.

At work my phone is on my desk, so unlocking it with Touch ID can keep it on the desk.

With Face ID, I have to pick it up off my desk and look at it or use the pass code. And even if I pick it up, it's still not as reliable as Touch ID. If I didn't get the right angle or close enough to my face, it won't recognize and I have to retry it or use the pass code.
Brilliant insight. I’m sure this will fix this bug that Apple can’t seem to fix. 

You dick. 
My wife used ERJ77XANJWYE

Thanks again!
I used **9AHF3F9N4FYR**

Thank you!
Yes, but when it’s on my desk I’m either leaning over my phone to unlock it or picking it up and looking at it to unlock it. 

With Touch ID it can stay flat on the desk, not having to lean over it or pick it up, and quickly unlock it with just my finger press. 
I was comparing the difference when having to enter your pin on the X compared to using Touch ID. 

But I am using Face ID, then I have to pick up my phone from my desk and hold it Amin front of my face. 

Touch ID is still faster and more convenient in either case. 
1. Tap screen

2.  Swipe up

3. Press “Face ID” text to enable passcode

4. Enter passcode

5. Phone is unlocked

**OR**

1. Press finger on Home Button

2. Phone is unlocked. 
He kept saying something about "tree fiddy".

Dunno what it meant but I had to boot his ass out.
I like the X for it’s beautiful design and form factor along with the screen, but so far I much prefer Touch ID to Face ID. 

No where near as fast and reliable and sort of seems gimmicky. I don’t like that I have to lean over my phone while it’s sitting on my desk to unlock it, or pick it up and hold it in front of my face. It’s still much faster and better than what the Galaxy S8 offers compared to their iris scanner or face recognition, but Touch ID trumps all. 

I’ll honestly probably go back to the 8 or 8+ in a month or two. 
Nah, google maps and photos is far superior to the Apple version. 
No one knew math could be so hard. 
I wish iOS used rare doggos instead. 
I have the Simple Choice plan. Do these trade in deals require the One plan or whatever is there only plan now? And does it require a new line activation?

You have this problem before or after the update?
If the price stays on sale when my next JUMP is available I’d like to try the Note 8. 
Now this is the quality post that I don’t understand, but what I was looking for!
Oh I completely agree. Google can’t seem to figure out one of the most basic and important uses of a smart phone. It annoys the hell out of me too. 

That at the same time, that’s sort of the difference between Android and iPhones anyway, right? iPhone is known to be ready to use as-is out of the box with very little customization needed (or allowed). Android lets you do whatever you want, but at the same time almost forcing the user to have to download 3rd party apps just to make the phone seamless in many applications. 

Both are different, both are great in areas, both are bad in areas. It’s really just what you prefer and what works well for you. In this case, iPhone is your flavor. 
It sounds like you were sharing photos using a normal texting app through SMS/MMS. That is the worst and slowest way to do it. 

If you share photos and videos a lot, the best way to do it is through WhatsApp or any other app that uses data. It works just like iMessage and is fast and doesn’t compress the photos. 

The only problem with that is convincing your friends to start using it too. 
I got the X coming from the regular 8. I do miss Touch ID especially since I use my phone a lot at work while it’s flat on the table. 

The larger screen is beautiful and the real estate is great. Animojis are fun and funny but haven’t used them since the first day. 

Camera is great, but basically the same as the 8+. 

If you want to drop $1200 on a phone and can afford it, I would say it might be worth it. It has that wow factor and people will notice if that’s important to you. 

Personally I don’t see myself keeping this phone for more than a couple of months. But that’s only because I’m on T-Mobiles JUMP on Demand program. 

In which case, I think you’ll be happy with an 8 or 8+ honestly. 
You can still see the border of each image moving in the video. 
It’s been so long since I’ve had an OLED phone I guess I never noticed. I remember hearing the whole OLED-gate with the OnePlus 5 screen though. 
The video doesn’t seem to show as well as I see it while scrolling, but some images like the waves seem to bounce in the black color. 

It’s also easier to see when you watch the border of each image. It sort of rubber bands around. 

Is this normal?
I mean it shouldn’t. The gorilla glass is strong enough to withstand the metal of a zipper. 
No
So you’re telling me I’m right?! Sweet Christmas. 
Wait until Samsung hears that Samsung beat them with a Samsung screen!
[I’ll pull out this retired doggo just for you.](https://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/golden-retriever-and-science1.jpg)
RIP, almost. 
It’s bad where you live, so it must be terrible everywhere!
I would call and find out if your plan has international coverage without extra costs. But as long as your phone has WiFi calling enabled, as long as you’re on the hotspot network, calling should be free since it’s on data. 
You are on their network LTE, it’s as good and fast as being on a WiFi network in the states.  
When I have gone to japan for work, best thing you can do is rent a WiFi hotspot. There’s several of them right in the airport, I’ve rented from SoftBank and Docomo. Either are fine and about the same price (about $10/day). If you’re able to spend that sort of money it’s worth it. Just turn on WiFi calling and you can now call and text (or WhatsApp or whatever) with LTE speeds and don’t have to worry about roaming charges. 
Not sure. I still have the 30 day one though. 
Looks like I might be SOL then. 
Few reasons. 

While I like the X a lot, I don’t know if it’s worth the price.  I didn’t think the Note was worth it either at $930 but at the reduced price I’ll definitely check it out. 

iOS 11.1 still has some problems that I feel Apple should have fixed before releasing but they didn’t. I know they update, even faster than Google, but still, it’s not as smooth and polished as they are known for. 

This is a dumb reason, but I’m not completely sold on Face ID, but if I’m going to try a phone without any fingerprint, at least I want to try the Note that has face scanner, iris scanner, (terribly placed) fingerprint scanner, and pattern unlock. 

I know I’ll miss iMessage, but I’ve done without in the past alright. 

The screen is better on the Note, and I know apps will update to fit the X screen better, but due to the new size of the X, some apps get cut off oddly. Im only guessing the Note doesn’t have this issue though. 

I like to go back and forth between iPhone and Android, and JOD allows me to do it. I had the S8 when it released and went back to iPhone; but I want to give Samsung another chance. Why not do it with their latest and greatest?
So is there any way for me to ditch the iPhone X and get the Note before my 30 day JOD is available?
You are correct. I just disabled the double click option and it turns off instantly. 

Much appreciated!
This is both good and bad that more than myself or just you are having this issue. 
I also noticed this same flickering when there are notifications on the lock screen and I’m doing face unlock to open my phone. But I couldn’t replicate that so easily. 
Yes. 
How does your X compare to the Note 8?

I’m also on JoD and am thinking of trying the Note. 
I predicted a post like this would happen on Nov 3. 

How wrong I was. 
What’s wrong with that sort of case? 

Asking for a friend. 
I watched the keynote and totally don’t remember seeing this.

Hey guys, look at my used old case. And I put it next to this new one.

In this day in age, how would someone be able to get by without their phone for more than a day? It's my only form of communication for my personal and business life. 
Really? That could take up to a week for them to officially receive it. And I'm supposed to be without a phone for that duration?
So question about returning via mail.

I have the iPhone 8 now. I ordered the iPhone X. Let's say I get it Friday, swap SIM cards, return the 8 in the store in Friday as well, and the X is my only phone.

Now let's say 3 days in I hate it as want to return it. Am I supposed to mail in the X, be without a phone from the time I ship it out to the time they receive it, then go to the store to get another phone?
Put it on your to-do list. Don't forget!

Don't you dare play with my emotions like this!

Too bad indeed. While feeling those soft boobs, you know, the ones that feel like sandbags.

Ya but you can also turn that feature off, so you don't have to press the home button to unlock it after you use touch ID. 

Seems like they'll definitely be a learning curve with the X. 
I had the same issue, but realized I only had the Gboard keyboard from the Google app. Once I disclosures downloaded the actual Gboard app from the app store then the gif feature was there. 

Don't forget to delete your other Gboard - Google keyboard because otherwise you'll have 2 Gboards.

August is when they release the Note. Usually April is when they release the "S" variant. 
Best way to resolve it is to use something like WhatsApp or Allo, messaging apps that work like iMessage using data, not SMS/MMS. 


Thank you for the reply. I actually just found a video taking about some of these points after I posted this. The YouTuber said you have to unlock the phone to change the volume to mute or vibrate, unlike iPhones mute button. But you for sure can just press the volume when the phone is locked and it'll still change the volume? 


And does the edge lighting just flash a color around the edge of the phone when you receive a text, or does it actually turn the whole screen on like an iPhone?
It feels good in the hands. 

Ladies...
You can at least take me to dinner first!

I really had my heart set on the new Traverse. It had enough room for my wife and 3 little girls and our puppy, Spot.

It was in our budget, had good safety ratings, and I was going to get a GM discount from my uncle.

I was about to sign the paperwork when my wife yelled to me from inside a Traverse she was sitting in at the dealership. Her gold iPhone 8+ wouldn't fit on the charging pad.

I yelled "FUCK YOU" at the salesman, set fire to the dealership, and decided to use our daughters' college funds to go into deep debt and get a BMW X6 M, because that fit her iPhone better when charging it.
I'm sure this is extremely frustrating for you, but I can't help finding this slightly funny watching you try and fail over and over.

You can use Facebook messenger as a dedicated messenger right? Android users can integrate their number and use it that way, but I don't think iPhone users can. 

Does it compress images or videos at all?
Gotcha. I didn't know that. 
What are its SMS limitations?
I'm on T-Mobile. I think worst case scenario I'll make my wife reluctantly download Allo or WhatsApp just for me, but I was wondering what other people are doing.

Why did you get rid of your S8+ to go back to the iPhone?
You're absolutely right. My experiences with shit frame rates, random screen flashes, random and inaccurate auto brightness bugs, freezing camera app, Wi-Fi not finding available networks, iMessage quirks (still from iOS 10), and a home button that will unlock but not open to the home screen even though the "Rest Finger to Open" feature is enabled, I must be wrong! Not counting the other people who are literally uploading pics and videos of their iPhone doing fucky things. 

Thank you for showing me the errors of my ways, loyal iSheep. 
Dammit! I was just thinking about switching to it too. 
The S8+ too? What was the price before?
Did Jerry Rig Everything do his test on the 8 yet? In can only guess they the "hardest glass yet" will still scratch at 6 on the Mos scale of hardness. Glass is glass, they ask seen to scratch at 6, whether it was Gorilla Glass 3, 4, or 5. 
iOS 11 sucks. 
Been eyeing the Galaxy S8+ for this past week myself, even though I had the regular S8 when it launched and swore is never go back to Samsung. 

And yet, here I am. 
That's why bringing lube wherever you keeps you prepared. Try and keep up. 
I understand that there are adaptive display features with color shifts to make it easier on eye strain and such, but I don't think what I had in my S8 was an adaptive color display feature. 

Warm tone, like the iPad in your link, is an orange-ish/yellowish tint, like s light bulb or the sun as you mentioned. The problem with my old s8, and I've seen others post pics on Reddit back then too, was that the tint was straight up red/pink. That's not a warm tone, it looked like a white balance issue. 
So...yes, there's still a slight red tint to the screen?
S12 master race.

Looking at it again, I gotta say that it's strange the black border of the comic is warping the way it is. I'm no burn expert, but does the unburnt center of paper warp if just the edges are burning? And some parts don't look like it's simply bending the paper, when looking at the warped image compared to the flatness of the edges. 
I know this won't actually give you any explanation, but I use Photoshop everyday for my job. 

The outside of the book is actually burned. Now whether that is actually a book, we don't know. Could be anything. 

The image of the comic, to me, looks super imposed on the burned part. The ashes around the image look fake and more like a Photoshop brush then an actual burn. Something about it just looks unnatural. 

So I suppose my answer to your question is, "you can tell it's Photoshop by the way it is" 😕

Now they only push iPhones and the expensive Galaxy phones. People are still making threads now how stores don't have V30s in stock and no display units. How often do reps offer a Motorola product?

If you mean that the Quick Reply message fades away and you’re left on the lock screen only, it’s when you touch outside of the massage box. 

I hate it. It’s so stupid because if you mistype or press somewhere outside of the box accidentally, you have to unlock the phone, open iMessage, and go into the conversation to continue. At least they leave what you were typing in the message bar. I think when the iPhone 7 and iOS 10 released last year it would just totally delete what you had typed before.

I don’t hate Android. I love that shit. I just wish it was on par with iOS. And maybe it is with the Pixel. I’ve never used it but have only ever heard good things about how smooth it is and how it’s the standard of Android. 

Both have positives and negatives about them. I still really like iPhones and how iOS works overall. However, I *personally* hate how they’ve just reused the same design AGAIN with only minor changes (though the glass back is both functionally better and feels better in the hands (ladies)). Maybe a lot of people don’t mind or have the idea that “it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” mentality. But I find it very lazy and an obvious move of just milking the cash cow on the design side. So many other companies are making changes every year, and while not all are great, at least they’re trying. 
Fair enough. 

I haven’t had an LG phone since the G4, and that wasn’t anything grand. I’ve had the Galaxy S7 and S8, and while their phones are beautiful, their OS experience isn’t up to my personal standard (based off of iOS really). 

I’m hoping the beefcake that the V30 seems to be on paper will prove to be an Android champion. 
Glad to hear it. But what sort of Bluetooth issues are you having? I listen to Spotify in my car every day so I hope it isn’t affecting something like a vehicle pairing.

When I was on my SE i installed iOS 11. It definitely felt that it worked faster. I had an iPhone 7+ before so I was used to the instant fingerprint unlock compared to the SE too. 
Just tried it. Didn’t change anything 😕
How do I do that?

In the last year, I had the iPhone 7 from release, got the Galaxy S8 for about 3 weeks, came back and got the iPhone 7+, then last month got the SE to save some money on my bill. 

I like the small total form factor of the phone, but goddamn I miss the screen. But I'll be back on the regular sized 8 next week so it'll be fine 🙄

When I had the Galaxy S8, I was able to put the phone directly on the magnet (with no case) and it would stay because the wireless charging coils provided enough metal to attract the magnet holder.

I guess we'll see if the iPhone 8 will be similar, but I'm just saying that you may not have to buy any metal plates to stick on the back of the phone anyway.
I'm in a similar boat.

I leave for vacation on the 23rd, but if I can get it shipped to my house guaranteed (impossible to guarantee, I know) or have it shipped to a T-Mobile store and have it waiting there for me when I return, that would be preferable. 
Whoops, got mixed up on colors reading it quickly. You're right.
Why would her own name be at the top of the chat then?
I like the reduced price on my T-Mobile bill compared to having the 7 Plus. And I do enjoy how it fits in my hand easily. But I'm still not used to texting on such a small keyboard, and clicking buttons on websites or reddit or whatever is a huge pain in the ass.

I'm seriously considering just getting the 8 and calling it good.
Yup. 
I don't dislike the 6 design at all. It was pretty different compared to the 5, took some getting used to with the new organic form factor, but I do really like it even now.

However, Apple has been seen as a tech company that drives industrial design over the last decade (or 2). They are very good with creating hardware that seamlessly works and flows with their software. They don't follow trends for the sake of following trends, and even if they adapt a current feature from the competition, they will usually create a trend even though it's not new. 

But let's look at the bottom line. Apple is a business. And what is their business? Making money. The 6 design works, yes. But it's probably saving them billions over the last 4 years not to have to design a new package for their phones. It's not innovative,  but it's cost effective. And as a designer, I hate having to bow to the powers that be who want to save those coins.
I have had an iPhone 6, 6s plus, 7, 7 plus, and now the SE. Literally got the SE to save some money via T-Mobiles JUMP on Demand. I don't care too much for the SE form factor. But because I currently have the I must not have any idea what I'm talking about, right?

I never said change for the sake of change. I'm talking about change to not only keep up with design and technology trends, but to perhaps be the leader of product/industrial design that Apple uses to be known for. If every designer had the same mentality as "this design is iconic and if it's not broken don't fix it," we would never have progress. 

But what do I know?  Just a professional industrial designer by day. 
Making millions while talking as a monkey animoji. 
Reducing the screen-to-body ratio as mentioned by many others is an easy and quick fix, while still keeping the home button and Touch ID feature. 
It's outdated. 
That 4 year old design though...
So I went to the website to get my 3 reports, and after I got my TransUnion one the site fucked up and got a timeout on getting one, and tried then got a pop up saying "Thanks for getting your 3 reports, see you next year."

But I only got the 1 report. How can I get my other 2 now?

Welcome to reddit. 
Are you me?

I just switched to the SE from a 7+ to save some money for a few months (T-Mobile JoD lease program) and though the battery is legit and charges fast, I have the exact same gripes as you. 

I miss the haptic home and it's overall faux clickyness. I have a really hard time clicking buttons and shit, typing is a mess with the smaller keyboard, miss those stereo speakers. 

I want to try and hold onto the SE until Black Friday to make a decision to either get the iPhone 8 or the LG V30 as well. 
36 hours of SoT?

Garbage.
or SLUT.
Of course some of these features are subjective. I really ended up hating the S8 fingerprint placement, and the iris scanner just isn't as fast or reliable as a fingerprint (when done correctly). 

Also, I really do love OIS, but getting a wide angle photo is much cooler to me. Plus I probably wouldn't record video too much with it anyway.
For me, the fingerprint sensor placement is very important. The on-screen display seems much better too, being able to swipe between difference apps.

Like mentioned by others, has on board quad DAC. I like the wide-angle lens, and the f/1.6 will (should) be better in low-light scenes.

Personally I would never use the S-Pen, so I'm not the consumer for the Note line, but I'm sure it's still a great phone.

I had the S8 for about a month when it released before going back to iPhone, but the V30 seems to have really checked all of the boxes that I look for in a phone.

I have high hopes for this and may switch to it.
Wat
Sound logic. 
I just went from the 7+ down to the SE last Sunday. It feels like a toy and the screen is (obviously) a huge difference than what I'm used to, but I'm saving about $18/month on my bill. And I'm probably going to cut the phone insurance through T-Mobile too to save an additional $10/month.
I get your point, but no one has to have a $1000 phone or pay $2.73 a day. Plenty of $200 phones are perfectly capable of doing just about everything the average person needs out of a smart phone.

So do I want to pay $2.73/day to use my phone, or $0.55/day? 
Looks really good.

Some quick critique:

- The highlights make it seem slightly cartoonish, especially where it wraps around the side. The hard light looks nice though.

- It's a little strange to see the phone on the right leaning on the other one, because I feel like it's going to fall over.

Otherwise, awesome!
If you play it from a different source (computer speakers for example) and record yourself with Clips, maybe that'll work?
Thank you.

It was taken with an iPhone 7+ though, so I don't know if that's a high enough resolution for you or not. You can PM if you want.

What country are you using it in?
If you're going to be a fanboy about it, how was Apple's build quality during bend-gate? Or how current iPhone 7's will freeze up when trying to make a call/are in the phone app? Or offering 16gb models for fucking ever? 

I like my iPhone, but they're far from perfect. 
I agree. But that is nearly impossible when it comes to a piece of technology. Off the top of my head, I can't think of one product in the tech industry that hasn't changed over time. And watches don't count because they're mechanical. 
Difference of opinion I suppose. I will give you that the differences are sometimes visually minor, and changes are down to millimeters in difference, but they literally changed height, width, and thickness of each model in the Galaxy phones. Screen size is different. The button is completely changed on the S8. 

Literally the only difference when comparing the 6, 6s, and 7 is that the 7 has a radius around the camera bump because it's a part of the aluminum back. Everything else is the same. 
I disagree. I think there is a much greater difference between the S6, S7, and S8 than there compares to the iPhone 6, 6s, and 7. 
She died.
Designs are always changing, especially with technology mixed into it. There will never be an end design where you no longer have to make changes. 

I agree that you shouldn't change a design for no reason. But in this case, if it's holding back features and tech, along with not keeping up with other design trends, then you must make a change. 
That is completely subjective. 
A tech company renowned for their industrial design reusing a 4 year old design is why people are making a big deal out of it.

I still like the current design, don't get me wrong. But you can't deny it's dated, especially compared to what other companies are making nowadays.
From where?
So do you have both the G6 and the REVVL? Or did you trade the G6 for the REVVL? And do you find it could actually replace your G6 as a daily driver?
That is a concern. But I also hate paying what I pay for my flagship iPhone 😕

I think that's my problem; I don't really know what shape my head is. The local bike shop doesn't have a great selection of helmets so I have to find some other place soon to try some on. But I really liked the Scorpion. 
Fair enough, I didn't know this. 
I actually ordered a scorpion exo 2000 but it was a fucking tight fit and had to send it back. But it was miles ahead of my current shit ass cheap helmet. 
Some people are commenting on why this is a bad idea. Never thought about it, but what is a good way to store your helmet?
I'm getting a new helmet and have narrowed it down to the LS2 Breaker helmet and the Icon Airmada helmet. The LS2 is $40 cheaper, but I don't mind spending the extra money if the Icon is a better fit and safer helmet over the LS2. 

Thoughts on which I should get?
It's definitely a learned behavior to use it. 

I don't always use it for everything, but I really really missed it when I went to the S8 for times like opening the wifi menu. 3D pressing on the settings to tap the wifi list compared to Androids swipe down, tap settings, tap wifi. 

First world problems, I know. But once you start using it you'll find it's a lot more convenient. 
I'm mostly interested in the every day animations from opening  and closing apps, to how smooth the animation is, if there is any noticeable lag or stuttering or drop frame rates.

I guess since you have both too, which do you find easier and more convenient to unlock when picking it up from the table or desk? I personally love iPhone's front fingerprint scanner because I don't have to pick up the phone to unlock it. I know both the G6 and S8 have the readers on the back, but I had trouble quickly and accurately finding the reader on the S8. And the iris scanner was cool, but still not nearly as fast and efficient as a finger print reader.
So the G6 is smoother then?
Even if you believe in the after-life, I find it strange that you'd think the sole purpose of this life is to determine the next. Is this all a test?

No it's not. In which case, I live to have fun and provide for my family so their lives are the best they can be. Same goes for my 2 dogs.
Goddammit 
I believe it's already in effect. 
So I just went into my local store and the employee seemed to either be misinformed or misunderstood the new JoD feature.

I asked him about upgrading every 30 days, and he told me that you can only still upgrade 3 times a year, but you have a 30 day grace period before Jumping again. 

But I read the T-Mobile article and it pretty clearly seems to say that you can upgrade every 30 days, basically 12 times a year. 

Wright & Co. 
Great environment, great food (a tad pricey though).
But is there a way for me to check to make sure I'm eligible for it?
Ya I have the JoD where I can upgrade 3 times a year. So I'll qualify right? Is there any way I can check on my T-Mobile site?
Old news? This article is dated today. 

But for real...when does this roll out? Every 30 days!? I love it.

Because they are the ones who want a magic pill or product that will make them lose weight without that pesky diet and exercise. So not only do they buy into it but they are also pushing it for others to buy, since now it’s “their job”. Then they post stupid pics of themselves using the product with no actual evidence or signs that it’s working.

Well on my Vulcan I wore just Nikes because they were smoother sole, whereas my boots or dressier shoes with a heel would catch on the peg. But now it seems, from other comments, that my shifter is missing a rubber sleeve all together anyway. 
I was riding a 1996 Kawasaki Vulcan 500 cruiser. I sold it last night as well as purchased this new (to me) 2000 Triumph RS sport bike. 

I'm getting used to the seating position and weight distribution, but this tiny metal peg of a shifter is absolutely killing my toes. I don't know if I'm not positioning my foot correctly, compared to a cruiser. Or is there a rubber covering that it's missing?

Either way, I have a shift sock on the way from Amazon, and have been looking into motorcycle shoes with hardened toes. But I just wanted to get r/motorcycle opinions on what I should do to save my foot!
This is Scam City. Never click links in emails directly if you're suspicious. 
I know this doesn't answer your question about iCloud, but this is the exact reason why I prefer Google Photos over it. It's much easier to deal with and you can use it seamlessly between Android and iOS.

When the Hound and Arya were together (can't remember which season), they came across that house with the man and his daughter. They gave them food and a place to sleep for the night, but the Hound ended up mugging the father and stole his money, leaving them with nothing after they were already scraping by.

So his theft was basically the result of them starving and the father killing his daughter and himself.

Since I've had T-Mobile, which is 3 1/3 years, I counted 9 off the top of my head.  But I feel like I'm forgetting 1 or 2. This is only due to the JUMP! On Demand feature they offer(ed), and I probably bent some rules here and there I don't think they thought about. 
I had an 6S Plus last year, got the S7 Edge. Returned it within a week and kept the 6S plus. Got the HTC 10, returned it kept the 6S plus. Got the S7 regular, kept it for the summer, got the iPhone 7. Had that until the S8 came out. Had that for 3 weeks, came back to an iPhone 7 Plus. 

I like android for a lot of reasons but iPhone works for me for a lot of other reasons. 
On the contrary, when I had my S8, I noticed some lag when opening the app tray. I installed Nova (paid version if that makes a difference), and holy shit was the phone a lot smoother on most animations.
Jesus Christ!

Oh shit, who was first? C&H or Jay London?
Jesus this is horrifying. 
I love Android for many reasons, but I had to trade in my S8 to go back to iPhone for several reasons, the "smoothness" being one of them.

It's on such a minute scale that I think most people don't notice (or care). I really thought and hoped the S8 would deliver, but to me, it didn't. It's a lot better than the S7 (which I also had), but still not up to iPhone quality.

I remember hearing/reading a long time ago that iPhone sort of "fakes" their animations. So the software and code priorities animations over actual app load times. Aside from the fact that when apps re-open there is a second or less of a "screenshot", so while it looks like it's loaded very quickly, it may actually still need to refresh or load completely. It's all done in the background, but the end result is a buttery smooth animation between apps, opening apps, closing apps, unlocking the phone, key presses, slide transitions, everything.

Like I said, this was just one of the few things that made me to back to iPhone. But once you experience it, you can't not notice the difference between Android and iPhone

But in the end, it all depends on you, the user. Do you care about a rather insignificant difference that really doesn't affect the overall use of the phone and it's capabilities? For me, yes, I do care.
Hahaha, oh man. Good show, Apple.
Also note that usually those green box message, or for me as of late, a pic sent to me, are weeks if not months old that still show up.

I don't use it. I like the idea and I'm glad you can use it or not.

I just prefer and am used to either clicking the home button with a non-touch ID finger or clicking the power button "mid raise". So when I had Raise to Wake enabled, the feature would turn on the screen right before I clicked the button, resulting in me turning off the screen way more often than I liked.

It just came down to bad timing based on my habits.

I also had the S8 for about 3 weeks then switched back to an iPhone 7 Plus (had a 7 before getting the S8). Felt the same way, loved the screen, camera was great, liked the new differences Android has from iOS. The phone *felt* beautiful in the hand.

But it was the little, and sometimes big, things I missed from iPhone that made me go back.

Damned near everyone I know has an iPhone, so iMessage was perfect. Google's messaging direction is....disturbing.

Fingerprint sensor was better on the S8 compared to the S7, but having it on the back was strange. I got used to it, but for me, I use and unlock my phone while it's on my desk at work, so the front home button on iPhone is a winner there.

Apps definitely work better and smoother on iPhone, even Google apps. 

I'm really excited for the next iPhone, especially since they got lazy with the 7 and reused a (at the time) 2 year old design.

I haven't been hardcore either side, but have used Android longer. I still really like what Android has been doing and plans to do and some of the flagship phones are really awesome. 

I made a post similar to yours last Monday. I was on an iPhone 7 since Sept, instantly preordered and got the S8 when that released. Loved it instantly, but it wasn't without its non-iPhone pains. 

Iris scanner was cool but not as fast as Touch ID. Fingerprint scanner was improved in speed compared to S7, but the location was a bad decision, especially for me since I open my phone and use it a lot while laying on my desk at work, so having to ether pick up the S8 every time to do anything or use the pattern every time was pretty cumbersome compared to what I was used to. 

I came back to iPhone after 3 weeks with the S8 and I'm here to stay. I realize that it's the phone and system for me I guess. I still hate iTunes and don't use many preinstalled Apple apps or anything, but iMessage is great, the phone is solid, and apps, even Google apps, work better on iPhone. 
Ah I see you've experienced the MMS iPhone/Android lag. Very, very annoying. I'm also on T-Mobile and have the same issue and same circumstance.

Maybe it's because he started actually gaining momentum and a following since announcing his candidacy, and the media looking into his readily available past and seeing how completely incompetent and horrible he is as a person, businessman, and candidate?

I mean, I think it would have been more difficult for the media to NOT show stupid shit he said and did and tweeted from his past. And he they "treated him fairly" by not publishing stuff from his past (that wasn't really hidden or anything), wouldn't that be painting a false narrative of him?

Everything he bitches and moans about from the media, he has brought upon himself. More often than not, the media is just publishing stuff he has said or done, not putting words in his mouth or making it seem like he did one thing or another. 

It's nothing like "He wore a TAN suit!? He hates America!" No, it's more like "He is under treasonous investigations and possible obstruction of justice." *"Oh ya, I fired that Comey guy. I'm no longer under investigation, comrades."*

It's something, alright.
I actually had much, much better animations and smoothness after installing Nova. Stock SO was so-so at best.

I'm coming from an iPhone 7. Unfortunately Android has never come close to the buttery smoothness of iOS. Dunno if it ever will. It's just how they are coded differently I suppose.
I just switched to Nova and my God, the animations are SO much smoother.

Coming from an iPhone 7 i noticed immediately the difference in animation quality, but was ok with it (kinda not really). But I remembered I had the purchased version of Nova when they had a sale on it a while ago. Installed it and my S8 feels smooth opening and closing apps as my iPhone does. 

That alone was worth it me. But now my home screen also looks like a Pixel home screen so I really like that too.

You are mistaking a belief for a religion. 

Atheism only believes there is no god/higher being. It is not ruled by a specific set of rules or laws. It does not dictate your moral compass, nor have any specific teachings, philosophies, or code. There is no church of atheism (but if there is I'm sure it's for tax breaks only like actual religious churches get). 

In any case, it's not a religion.  
One might even say, a WORLD WAR!?
My immediate thoughts about Light.

It's American, that's whatever. But like I told my friend who showed me this trailer, Light is a calm, collective, highly intelligent, sophisticated, and good-looking guy. 

It's not fair to make any assumptions about American Light, but at the very least, he doesn't look sophisticated or good-looking at all. And to me, that was an important part of his character. He used his charm and good looks to progress his plan as Kira.

But I guess we'll see how it plays out.

They basically (or actually) said they moved from a 2 year design cycle to a 3 year cycle around their September event. 

So this year will definitely be a redesign. How drastic? No idea. But I'm hoping it's something major, since it's also the 10 year anniversary of the iPhone.

Not sure how this will affect their nomenclature (will the 2017 iPhone be iPhone 8? iPhone 7s?)

If you want to solely use Gboard, then you have to remove the "English" and "Emoji" keyboard under Settings -> General -> Keyboards. Now Gboard will be the only one left and it shouldn't switch over. 

However, as mentioned from other posts, some apps or in certain situations, the iOS keyboard will still pop up. There no way around this to my knowledge, but shouldn't happen too often.

In my experience, when Gboard would update, I would have to restart my phone for it to get it to work properly.

iPhone 7+ has a 12 megapixel camera.

Free Google Photo storage saves up to 16 megapixel images.

I'm not too good with numbers, but it would seem that the free option for Google Photos should be able to save an uncompressed iPhone 7+ photo.

Google Photos all the way. 

Biggest reason is that I switch phones more than the average person, and I like Android phones and switch to those if I think it'll be a good phone to have for a while. In which case, Google Photos works very well across both platforms.

I'm having trouble sticking with it. It's nice when I can scan the barcode and it gives me all of the nutrition info. But when I eat lunch at my work cafeteria, it's pretty frustrating to guess what to input for the food. 

I am still trying to eat healthy by eating salads and soups instead of the main course meals like sandwiches, pastas, even turkey or chicken dinner-sized meals (because they'll come with a lot of rice or mashed potatoes or something tasty yet full of calories).

But when I have little to no idea what is in the soup (aside from chicken and beans in the White Chicken Chili soup for example), especially when it's soups like Thai Fire Rice soup, or Chicken Enchilada soup. How do I input that!?

Even my salad. I'd almost rather not put in each individual piece of the salad and guess how much it is. It just doesn't feel very accurate that way.

I want to stick with it and it's only been a week, but it just doesn't seem as useful as a tool as I thought it would be. 

Maybe if I start making my own meals and measuring everything out?.....but that just seems like so much work to do....
If/ when universal RCS rolls out on T-Mobile, how does this work between Android abs iOS? I want to come back to Android but everyone in my life is on iPhones, and would definitely miss iMessage.

No dude, he's a person not a number. 
I'm curious, because his house is nice and lives in an upscale neighborhood with a nice car (I don't live too far from him considering and I follow him on Instagram), do you think he pays for his tech and fun gadgets from his own pocket? His subscribers and views don't compare to MKBHD, but it seems that he has more income than MKBHD.

I've always wondered if his online persona was his only source of income, because it seems like he had money before doing this gig. Unless I'm way off on how much people can make from social media. 

Ultimately, I'm just pretty envious he does what he does and has the money to do it 😜

Though no official confirmation from Apple, their move from a 2-year to a 3-year design run phase, in my opinion, would mean the iPhone 8 will release in September 2017.

The 7S variant, if one comes out at all, may come out in the Spring, like the SE did.

Also, 2017 marks a 10 year anniversary for iPhone, so it makes sense to reveal something big, flashy, and new for the product line. Which would also be smart to give it the new nomenclature, and not the "S" variant.
I was assured by 2 different sales people in 2 different stores that JoD works with any phone.

I think when they introduced it it was only for flagship (expensive) phones, but now it seems like if I wanted to JUMP from my iPhone 7 to the ZTE Max for $7/month that would be fine.

Yup. Mine would either play the pre-installed U2 album or this one album I downloaded years ago. I don't ever use Apple Music so when I got my iPhone 7 I just deleted the music app. Haven't had a problem since. 

In fact since I did that, Spotify will auto play much more often. It'll either pick up where I left off even after hours from being in my car, or nothing will auto play. So much better.

Ya I know. But I like using the mag strip pay feature. I use that more than NFC, but that was also very hit or miss. 
Man when I had my S7 Samsung Pay would work about 50% of the time. And when it did, I feel that it was slow to do so. Apple Pay, though only working with NFC, works flawlessly and within a second pretty much every time.

I know it's still speculation, but would I be able to use JoD from my iPhone 7 to the SE?

I like the 7, but if I could save some serious coin per month by switching to the SE then I will!
This is how I feel. When it would work it was cool. But compared to Apple Pay, it's definitely not as smooth, fast, or consistent (yes I know they're different technologies).

Actually I had problems using NFC almost every single time. I ended up only using the magnetic pay just because that would usually work. 

Apple Pay works every time within about 1.5 seconds via NFC. 
How long did this take? I know After Effects only a little, and for me to make this would take maybe a days worth of work (8+ hours easily).

Does this affect only purchases and monetary items? Or would this lockout also keep you from accessing services like Google Photos?

Because, personally, I would be mad about losing apps, but I would be devastated if I lost years worth of photos and videos I could never get back.

I didn't. She didn't reply but we've texted each other a lot since then. Which doesn't show.

You should be fine in a perfect world, but I've sent back 3 different phones over the last several months, and every time I had to call CS abs request them to stop charging me for the phone i returned. 

Don't be surprised if you're charged next month for your returned phones. 
Does that cat have red claws?
Hey now, those swastikas aren't going to Reich themselves!
That's disappointing to know :(
It shouldn't be more expensive, but it's not cheaper either. They break down the total cost of the phone over 24 months. Ultimately, it's just a different way of paying the same price for the phone.
If you currently have JoD it should work for you. I am a JoD customer and I asked customer service last week if this phone will be eligible for it and she assured me it would.
