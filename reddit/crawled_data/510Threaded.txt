You only have to do this if your are getting the iPXE boot issue
The rom bar is the Base Address Register for the ROM of the device. Setting it to off removed the virtio's network option ROM and it allowed the VM's bios to skip the setup and loading of the ROM which also disables the iPXE boot.  

[Here is where I have it](https://imgur.com/YcEyYxI)  
My nic is only a 2 port one though
Something that I had to do with my pfsense VM was add "<rom bar="off">" in the xml for each of the passed through ports else it would have tried to do an ipxe boot on each one.

The Earth King has invited you to /r/LakeLaogai.
A raspberry pi could work too if it's connected to your network.  

What you could do is have the pi poll Tautulli every few seconds or even every second and if a remote steam is active, set a GPIO pin to high, if not, low. That way you could have it anywhere in your house and not tied to your server.

/r/electronic_cigarette is the sub for reviews, advocacy, questions, etc. Hand checks are not allowed unless its in the Weekly Pics Thread.
I had a similar thing happen to me but it was just 1 transaction.  

Over a year ago on a Friday night I got an email from Blizzard saying my WoW sub failed to renew. I immediately checked my CU account and noticed a $400 charge from a Chase bank in Illinois (I live in a different state and I don't use Chase for anything). I then called my credit unions emergency number and had my card (debit) canceled.  

The next day as soon as I woke up, I drove to the credit union and signed a fraud charge agreement and they told me that if the charge goes through (if was too late for the charge to be denied) I would get a credit reimbursement while the investigation was ongoing (only had like $110 in my checking account so the charge pulled 300 from savings (i then turned off overdraft protection)). Charge went through and about 2 hours later, i got the reimbursement.  


After seeing the charge on my account on Friday, I immediately changed all passwords that I used and setup my account to notify me of ALL authorization and posts.

The drives do not really need to be precleared. A simple format is good.  

If the drives are brand new, then a preclear would be useful.  

What OP can do is get 1 large drive to act as a holding drive. Transfer all data from 1 drive to the holding drive, add the drive to unRAID and format it then add the data from the holding drive and repeat. The holding drive can now be your parity drive when finished.
If you go over 30 disks in your array, you dont want to use unRAID and should move to a proper RAID setup
Whats the file system on the disks?  

You have mix and matched disks and if you want an easy solution, then try out unRAID. It is well worth the one time purchase.

> to use on a mod with almost the same size and form factor as the drag  

Most mods are in the same form factor, including the drag. You going to blame Sigelei for ripping the form factor of the 150 from the drag?

You wanna compare the sizes of the drag, pulse and other mods?  

Drag:   90x54x24mm  
Pulse:  77x50x27mm  
Pulse 80w: 82x54x25.9mm  
Sig 150: 103x57x23mm  
Battlestar: 83.5x40x34mm  

Sizes look very close to each other

Being near the positive just really increases the chances that something can short it, like a coin, or wire clipping.  

Plus wraps are 10 for $3 so when in doubt, rewrap
Under the thin PVC wrapper is the negative connection. All of the battery besides the positive terminal is the negative.  

If the wrapper is torn near the positive terminal, then anything conductive could cause it to short.

It is where it is in the image but the cyst is smaller

I am a programmer and a simple change might sound simple on paper, but once you dig deep into the codebase (i.e. WoW and the default bag issue (yay extra 4 slots)) and make the initial change, you realize you just broke something else or some cards are coming up more than others so you fix that issue, but that creates another bug and so on.

.img is not the same as .iso  

A .iso file is essentially a virtual disc that is mounted and then executed from.  
A .img file would be akin to a virtual hard drive and the partitions and data that a VM makes changes to are actually written to the .img file.  

You should be able to boot straight to the .img file by pointing to it in the Primary vDisk location field on the Edit VM screen

I am someone to loves to level new characters (even after I already have all classes at 110). I moved to a new realm to be with some RL friends on Tuesday and we are having a blast leveling new toons. I was on my lvl 15 monk and my friend was on his level 7 warrior and we were questing together. I wasnt one-shotting mobs for him and we both had a ton of fun doing ALL of Eversong and Ghostlands.
I've been through every single RC and have had 0 or only very minor issues (that were resolved) and updated to stable 6.4 smoothly
6.4 is still so much faster than 6.3.5 IMO

Thought the same thing, needed more context to figure out what it actually was
I am leveling with a friend from 1 and we are at about lvl20 (me druid, him warrior) and we are having a blast going through all of the Ghostlands quests. When he was level 7, I decided to see how it would be to quest with him on a level 15 monk and it was still even, I wasn't 1 shotting things for him and we were both getting full XP.
No where is it mentioned that he used heirlooms

Pretty sure you spent more on RAM than the CPU or GPU
Yep, i kept switching classes to decide on what to level when the patch goes live (im moving to new server probably too) and I had a blast on almost every class. Even with full heirlooms, i could not pull more than a few mobs. 

Probably going to do either a druid (balance or feral), shaman (elemental), hunter (MM), or priest (shadow).

         {
             if (cap.Match(obj.Test())) {
                 var veh = obj as Vehicles;
                 if (veh != null && !cap.SourceContains(veh)) {
                     vehicles.Add(veh);
                 }
             }
         });  


Now if I had to rewrite the LINQ:  

    List<Vehicles> veh = objs
        .AsParallel()  
        .Where(c => cap.Match(c.Test()))
        .OfType<Vehicles>()
        .Where(a => !cap.SourceContains(a))
        .ToList();

You would only be able to access it remotely if you forwarded a port on your router to unRAID's port 443. Otherwise it would have literally no access to it.

It kept failing for me and when I googled the error I got in the logs, it came up with a post like a day ago says its temp down.

I am ok with proxies as long as it's not power nine AND actually thought was put into the proxy itself. If it's just a sliver of paper with the name of the card and mana cost on top of a basic land in a sleeve, then no. I don't want to constantly have to check the oracle text on my phone when I forget what that card did. (Also applies to full art proxies, all oracle text and basic card info is required and unobstructed)
Why i use unRAID...not having to buy multiple drives at a time (more than 2 as I usually upgrade the parity drive at the same time)

Super is not a remake of the originals, that is Kai (originals in better quality and no filler episodes (i.e only manga canon episodes))  

GT is NOT canon and Super takes place right after the Boo Saga.
Plex and Emby both support something called transcoding which is when the client device does not support the direct playback of the file (either the video or audio of it). One thing that those 2 have that Kodi does not is the ability to access and play your library across the internet. Transcoding over the internet allows you to watch your bluray ripped Linux ISOs at a lower quality so that the server is able to serve the video to you (i.e. you have a slow upload speed).  
This also you to have a central server in your home that can stream to any client on your local network (usually direct play so full quality)
you cant show that and not say the skin, and is that a Kodi backend, or is it Plex/Emby?

Nightborne going horde is mainly because the blood elves had to deal with the same addictions but to the Sunwell, and Tyrande treated them like shit.  

Void Elves going Alliance is because the Blood Elf leader (can't remember name) did not trust Alleria being near the Sunwell (because void magic)

> While I agree that Blizz should use their own testers,  

Yes, but what they are wanting is feedback from the player base, not the workers.
You dont need to completely redownload the game. Copy over the current game into the PTR folder and it will only download the update

The public tends to go towards whomever is the loudest on social media and the news. All the bad stuff about something gets a lot more attraction to the public while anything even with facts and sources towards the good stuff just goes under and few believe it.

oh yeah, i just dont have a clamp style RTA and not really a fan of RDAs
Why i wont run under 0.15...the lower the resistance (and usually higher the coil mass) requires more wattage to reach the right voltage which reduces battery life
Nope, regulated 20700s  
I just a sweet spot of 0.25 for my tank
yeah, i like my ohms to be around 0.25 or 0.3.  
Plus 8 wraps wouldnt fit without shorting in my RTA

but a very good one for the internet ;)

It was ohming out too low for my tastes in dual coil, [remade it in kanthal](https://imgur.com/eCZp56o) without fucking it :P.  

Thanks for the insight though
The fuck-up was that I accidentally wrapped them in opposite directions.  

Usually my fused clapton wire ends up being all kinds of twisted. Usually I wrap clockwise and that did not end well. Decided to try wrapping counter-clockwise and its perfect.  

[Did it again with all kanthal for a slightly higher resistance](https://imgur.com/eCZp56o)
those 2 are unusable together in a velocity deck.  

I have a vice that has 3 connected ball baring swivels that holds the fused cores at one end and the other is connected to my drill and I kept the cores very taught while i claptoned it.  

Cores: 2x26g SS316  
Wrap: 36g Kanthal  
ID: 3mm  

have not ohmed it out yet, but steam engine is saying 0.37/coil or 0.19 dual

Nice, sadly we have to go up against some of the top bands in the country for our state comps since we are in the same bracket (Owasso, Broken Arrow, Union).... It's a challenge

Can confirm, school didnt fund shit for the band program. All of our band events was fundraised by the 150 or so band students.
If I'm the one who's drunk, why are you seeing double?
can confirm, spent more time with my band director (and other assistants/teachers) than any other teacher for all of high school and I respect all of them for devoting all of the time for the students.  

Lets add this up...  

Band Camp (8am-4pm M-F (3 weeks before first day of school) on campus) - 7 hours/day - 105 hours  

6:50am-9:20am (before school to 10mins before 1st hour ends) every school day after the first day of school (Mid August) to November (Marching Competitions (went to BOA Grand Nats my senior year)) - 147.5 hours  

3 to 4 local (state) competitions (on Saturdays 8am-8pm (sometimes later)) - ~12 hours each - 48 hours  

Friday Night Football games (we went to every single one) 5:30pm-~11pm - 12 games @ 5.5 hours/Friday - 66 hours

Total of 366.5 hours or 15.27 days per marching season  

4 years of HS marching band - 61 days of just marching band related activities  

P.S. I played and marched the Euphonium
