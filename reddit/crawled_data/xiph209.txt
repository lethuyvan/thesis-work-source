Hopefully that will  change when they update the app.

This is really nice of you OP. Thank you
Yes please!

Thank you for the code. This game is really awesome.
I was skiing. This is some sort of access point to the ski slope. We almost missed it because there is mist everywhere but there. I suppose the trees are blocking it.
But op got your upvotes now same way
It's 2018 and we still don't have Spotify available here...
Can anyone integrate all the previous jokes?
But CAN you?
I will try this as well. Thank you


Edit: it certainly works. Thank you very much
Listen to this one. You'll be able to tuck your feet under the blanket no matter what.
Yes. I`ve noticed it on PC version, while on the phone there is no change; sync is just as it has always been
It seems you can post stuff on your profile now, which you can obviously moderate so I dunno.. is it like you get your own sub? Also you can set a profile pic and a header. That's all I've noticed
I simply threw the cube into acid. It respawned lol

So you're telling me I've been sniffing boogers all my life?
[Here's mine](https://i.imgur.com/4wkOFec.png)


Nova launcher and custom icon pack made with adaptions
Suntem niste muisti... Csf
Here we say "were you raised in a tent?". I suppose it makes more sense
What icon pack are you using?
That's what I'm struggling to understand as well.
It's Adidas gene, duuh
Interesting, however I've never explored the artistic part so I don't know if I got that in me.  And yea, I tend to mimic the behaviour of the person I'm stressing with... But that creates stronger bonds, right? I don't recall having any accidents either.


Thanks for giving a bit of info.
I always thought I can feel if something is off about someone. I would just say 'meeh.. I don't like this person.'  


Given enough time others would come to agree that there was something bad about that person.


Well, I didn't know you can see that in the chart. What else can you tell me? This is really interesting.
They would have more if they'd launch to Romania as well!
Why is the Flash there?
Unfortunately it is a private photo. Can you change that?
I don't want to root it. If you have a screenshot that would be awesome
This is amazing. Thank you very much! 


I appreciate this and the simple 'only border' wallpaper from the other thread.

Happy holidays!
Does swift minimal only work on s8 and note 8? I got a galaxy a5 2017 and I'd want to apply this theme
Of course I don't mind. It would be awesome if you could make it
Can you please make this for a normal screen with 1080x1920?
Hello. I keep seeing wallpapers made for iPhone X that have a cool border. I would like to have a wallpaper like that as well but I don't have an iPhone. 


Can anyone make a wallpaper 1080x1920 which has that cool border, please?
It replaces the physical home button
I'll leave this here. It might help others...


I used a custom widget made with kwgt. Placed the widget under the icons; (I enabled that widget overlay setting). Disabled the dock and changed the height padding of the desktop.



[it ended up looking like this](https://i.imgur.com/xweGnLL.jpg)
These 3 are simply amazing. Thank you for sharing!
Awesome setup. I like how the important things are displayed at top of the screen. I tried to get that for so long that I gave up
TODAY! TODAY TODAY!. oh.. not today :(
Any apk that would work with galaxy a5 2017? 

I really do not know which I should actually use. 
Thank you!

Well I only used 3 widgets, nothing more. But I am expecting to see my steps number going up when I start walking. Also that thing didn't reset once a new day started.

I like that launcher but this small problem made me go back to nova
True. That's awesome. The only thing I don't like though is that the widgets stop updating after a while
Nice tumblr page! I`m already on the other side. Nece trapped me in a box...

Edit: you might see the background as black but I'm using magical particles live wallpaper. I've set the particles size to as low as possible.
Sounds good then. How is a mod pack created? I don't know how to install mods separately
Modded!! Awesome! But we`ve played vanilla for so long! On the other hand, MODDED! Arghhh...

We had vanilla. Then we added plugins; not bad. plugins are good... gave us some purpose and extra fruits (who eats those tho??? maybe you can add more kinds of meat. maybe..)

Well server is dead. The restart will hopefully bring us back together. Good old times!

I like modded just as some of you guys too! but maybe not every one and obviously not every one will agree with this. If we decide to add some mods what would we chose? Would we go full modded like "Foolcraft" for example; or we would only have some basic mods that will keep us to vanilla as close as possible?

I feel like introducing mods to the server requires lots and lots of shared opinions.

P.S. I am up for any option. I will happily play either vanilla, either modded as long as there will be people who want to join :P


P.S.part2 -> This is the longest comment I`ve ever done! THX NANA
That's all I wanted to hear. Hahah


I remember last time we had Gods I got punished every 5 minutes or so and I'm not even that unfaithful
Is it possible to not choose a God? I'm not a fan of their often punishes so I'd rather not pick one.
The upvotes?
Please someone post a large article. But not in English so OP has to figure what language he has to translate from first

Makes sense...

After contemplating and pondering upon this affirmation I came to the conclusion that this matter would require an even greater amount of energy and time to only slightly gasp the mere importance of the true meaning of this matter.

One could only hope to understand the true meaning of this unanswered question of the univers. There's no need to say that only by giving your whole time, energy and your very soul  you'd manage to gain the answer.

So...

Yes

This happened at Untold festival in Romania too. It was fantastic!
Thank you very much
Yup. Just play with the hue and you'll get lots of variations.

Honestly I enjoy the purple wolf more
Maybe on future maps that can be done. Right now there is no possible need of iron since our farms were working a lot.
Someone help this guy!

We need to know the truth
Thank you!
Yea that's sounds like a great idea. I'm sure we can do that
Thank you! Really nice of you

I wouldn't like that
I'm waiting here at goldie gold train station.
Another question: can I only change the colour of the quick settings. I see that if I apply a theme it will change the  colour of other apps too. 

Got any idea?
I would but this on my wall

They had to make sure you never leave that balcony  or what?
An app. You can find it on Google play
I got it from backdrops. I don't have it right now but I'm sure you can find it there
I did that as well and it says no email is registered. 

So it's confusing because when I want to create one they say it's already used
Well I tried few more times and last time it actually said that the mail is being used. Now I'm thinking I might have used it as recovery mail for my gf  and if that's the reason I can't make myself a new account I will change the recovery thingy

I try to fill my time as good as I can. But with this college life I barely do anything else. I read books now and then, in the winters I go skiing (that's the best thing about winter). I play a lot of rocket league but I'm still not good at it. Meh... Well, regular stuff I suppose everyone does, you know? 

What about you?
> College has taught me a lot & has changed me for the better. I used to be shy and introverted before college but now I'm generally more talkative and have a lot more friends.


Same here. 

This is crazy! Everytime I read a new reply I'm simply amazed. Seriously I wouldn't believe this if it didn't happen to me. 

Dem zodiac...
I know that it weren't that lazy sometimes I could do more things. I'm doing good in college, though I know I could do better. I'm a Med student. Relaxing is good and I manage to achieve that mostly by staying alone with my thoughts. Now this is were the contradiction kicks in:  after a while I can't stand the loneliness so basically I want to talk with someone most of the time. I hope this makes sense. I have my moments when I want to go out in clubs, but that's a rare thing because I don't like really crowded places. I'd always choose a pub over everything when it comes to getting out. You can sit, drink, talk, eat there so it's much better
I'm from Romania, I'm a Med student. Ich bin 21 Jahre alt. Ich habe Deutsche in der Schule gelernt
Hey. I'm not from Germany and I'm sure I know too little German to actually use it but I'd like a new friend in my list
Yea. I know what you're saying and I agree. I feel the same as you. Man this zodiac thingy is really strange but interesting at same time

Hello fellow virgo
I am faithful in relationships, yes. I think that's one of those important things. 

When it comes to writing I can't say I'm a good writer or a writer at all. Well indeed I can express my feelings better through writing and I'd rather do that than talking about how I feel. 

If you're interested in Virgos this can become an AMA
Thank you!
Using Tumblr to find stuff was a great idea. So I found out I have moon in leo and pisces ascendent. Strange thing is that I knew virgo and pisces are opposite... Im both. Heh

Yea... We got too much iron now. I did some math and we've gathered over 100 stacks of iron blocks
It is said that one farm will give you a golem every 6 minutes


I get 11 and a half stacks of ingots in a hour
1. You need to have 65 blocks between two farms in any direction.  2. There are 10 villagers in each farm (maybe more because I've put two and each then I fed them. Minimum requirement is 10 though. 3. I don't know anything about consoles, sorry
26 iron farms + a villager breeder on top
Thank you! 
That's cool! I'll surely use that design next time 
We tried to build one one the server and it didn't work. 

Anyway I'm satisfied with the drop rates and the look of the farms

You can make the new chests with their shells. They're called shulker boxes and they're basically  backpacks
The farm is located in End. Use the end gate which is above the spawn spot in End. Gather as many shells as you need.


PS. Lilly is not actually part of the farm.
That`s quite a nice present!

Even more awesome is that you want to share it.
Oh. I'm sorry. At that moment I had no access to Skype. Won't happen again

After lots of testing I realised we cannot use the system until all 11 spots are occupied. As the title says there are 9 left;
you will find the ATM at spawn behind the beacons
there will be 2 chests: the buttom one will have few papers stacked in 2. Rename both and leave one in the upper chest I`ll put them in the system myself.


And please update the remaining spots :D

New redstone machine: an elevator.

The simplest way to fly around, or dive in water.

Z and I plan to build more of them around the world (currently there are 2 towers: one at my place and one at spawn)


Make sure to check them out.

PS: I left a chest with chorus fruits at bottom. Take one in case you get stuck. (yea, it could happen)
In the center of each machine you'll find a dropper. Place your payment there. 

The left one will pop out one of the following: cobblestone, redstone, iron or diamond. 

The right one: after you place your payment and hit the button you'll have to check the same dropper. The number of diamonds you can win is correlated with the number of times the light goes on minus 1. eg. if the light goes on 5 times, you will win 4 diamonds. (you take your prize from the same dropper)

EDIT: I changed the circuit for the diamond slot so you can win more.
UPDATE: I`ve added a second [slot machine](http://i.imgur.com/u9AKEnb.jpg)


EDIT2: so thanks to lilly whom came with a great idea and also donated items for the prize pool, I added a third slot.

Here you got the chance to win one random item (everything from simple blocks to enchanted armor).

It works like the middle one. You put the payment in the dropper (in this case diamonds) and hit the button and then one random item pops out.

You never know what you'll get...

Have fun
