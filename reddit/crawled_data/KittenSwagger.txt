I figured someone would mention Adobe with this. Idk...if you think about it the Creative Cloud is a much better deal than buying it outright. Photoshop was around $700. Once you purchased this; if there was an updated...you were screwed and needed to buy the newest version. Now, you can get photoshop and lightroom for $10 a month. When its updated; you get the newest version. Don't plan on using photoshop for a while? Turn off your subscription and enable when you're ready. You could buy the $10 creative cloud access for photoshop for 5.8 years before you reached the price of owning photoshop outright.

Well depending on your location, check out ikea/target/walmart?

You can always find things within your budget. If not a retail store, craigslist etc.

We still have Easton Stick for another year so; were good.

However, he can always improve on his accuracy and making smart plays. But overall, im comfortable where we are at with him. He's been playing, and starting even, since he was a freshman; he knows what is up.

This is funny to me. This is the exact mindset that people flame Apple over (ie. Apple Music/Apple Maps) But yet when Tesla does this, its smart. Interesting.

That and your example of Apple wanting more money for the license is a mute point. Manufactures have been using Car Play and Android's version for years and years...Not only for auto manufactures but Alpine, Clarion, Kenwood, Pioneer, Sony, and JVC. Are you saying that all these companies are stupid and losing money on this?...
Apple Maps doesn't automatically incorporate Tesla Superchargers to your route...wow, absolute garbage indeed.

Your argument as to why they shouldn't have AA/CP in their cars is that more options for consumers is...a bad thing?

Yeah. Im done arguing with you. 
How much was this package? $3500?
I get what you're saying; however aren't like nearly every car that *does* offer CarPlay, also offering Android's version? I know Chevy, Mercedes, BMW, and VW do. 
> If hands-free is the ultimate goal I should be able to use Siri flawlessly to get everything I need done.

I do. Siri works 99% of the time for me when asking basic commands in my car. Sounds like the problem is you...

Not sure what you're point is here exactly. So **Apple** CarPlay is 'absolute garbage' because it forces you to use **Apple** Maps? Ok? 

Not sure how I have been getting around in new places for all these years using the absolutly horrible Apple Maps. /s
Curious. What about it is 'absolute garbage'? Exactly? The UI is designed that way to focus on a completely hands-fee experience. Its minimalist by design. Not sure what you are expecting here...
Yes. This is my biggest hang up on a Tesla. It's suppose to be this future car...but no CarPlay? Why.
Well i mean, I would say 80% of the population buying phones don't follow iPhone rumors.

That would make sense If Disney has 4K available on iTunes...they don’t. 
Damn. Did not know that. Kinda sucks.
This is probably a stupid questions but im not totally familiar with the process for the 3. If you ordered a Model 3 today, when would you expect to receive it? (roughly) 

edit: nvm, found my answer (12-18 months)
Sorry if this is a stupid question but you can add free supercharging to model 3s for a price right?

Why would anyone *not* add that? 


Edit: k. or downvote?
I think its a deal. A lot of times these movies are $25 a week or so after release. $20 for probably the biggest movie eve (i honestly think it will be) is a good deal. 
Plot twist, Jshootstuff is Casey. 
Who does this? Even if you are the biggest comic book fan in the world; this is a Disney movie geared towards drawing kids and families in. Who goes to these movies and screams fuck you? 
I preferred Final Fantasy 7.
I agree. I thought it was very interesting how, for me at least, I found moments flip flopping on how I felt about Thanos. Some scenes even understanding what he is trying to do. This is classic example of good vs. bad guys based on how you are viewing their goal.

Thought Thano's character was done perfectly and really makes you think about what is going on with him. 
>  They had the guts to kill our heroes 😱😱

Don't hold your breath. Im going to go out on a limb and say there is a 85% chance they are going to bring them back.
> What Arrested Development character showed up in this? saw a trademark for one in the credits? 

Tobias was in a holding tube with the Collector. He was in 'Blue Himself' mode. 
I was almost thinking this was a Snoke-type villain ending when Thor stabbed him. 

Would have been very interesting. 
> So Dr. Strange.... he knew all of it was gonna happen right? I mean the stuff he was saying “We only win in one” “We are in the end game now” “I had to do it Tony”. He knew by letting Thanos have the time stone that he was actually saving the universe by setting up the survivors to destroy **Thanks** right?

You're welcome


I was thinking that too. Tony has lasers that cut through hulls of spaceships...
Well, to be fair I have seen a lot of people talking about how the upcoming Spiderman movie could end with Peter getting on the bus for a field trip (the beginning of Infinity Wars) 
Well its 'random' but 1/2 the people in the Universe 'die'. 
678-136-7092 is Steve's number. Give it a call. 

(not joking, saw a still from the movie on YouTube)

Edit: its an Atlanta number.
...you honestly think that they are just killing off Boseman? No.
Tobias when he 'Blue Himself" was in a tube at the Collector. 
Im not too sure that's how that works. I was thinking that after Tony and Spiderman save Dr. Strange on the ship, he keeps asking Tony to turn the ship around and go back to Earth. He clearly wanted to go to Earth so that tells us that he can't just teleport anywhere. 


Or how they edited out infinity stones on the gauntlet. 
Nebula has a ship. Not to mention, Thor can access the bifrost now.
He's essentially shamed/scared that Thanos beat his so easily. Im imagining in the next Avengers movie he will turn Hulk at the right time to save Bruce.
I agree 100%. I felt very odd about his character the whole movie...but not in a bad way. Like I legit wanted to hate Thanos for the typcial 'bad guy' reasons but couldn't. There were parts where you almost relate with him or understand why he's doing what he's doing. 

Such a great movie. 
Holy. Shit.


This movie was incredible. Honestly, without a doubt, the best Marvel movie. Period. Worth every minute of the 10 years.

Don't feel bad for him. He 100% can't take criticism at all. I mean look at the whole ad fiasco. Instead of just being like "oh damn, well im sorry I didn't disclose this was an ad like I should have done to be compliant with the law"; he essentially through a fit.

When I read your post I can't help but think to myself; What on earth would they have to say about it that would make them upset?

How does having the shit that your dog leaves in someone else's yard being placed in your own yard make you upset and what could you possible even say to them? 
Its always a huge act. One thing I can't stand about his vlogs (now and in the past) is his fake clumsiness. It gets really *really* old watching a grown man pretend to trip or run into things, fumble cameras around, or include outtakes of him trying to say a simple sentence but 'messing up' and doing a retake. 

Edit: Let me just say one thing, I like his videos and watch nearly all of them. I just hate this forced "im a clutz! Im so normal!" shtick he's trying to do all the time. 
Whenever I see these tweets I imagine them sitting on a couch 2 feet away from each other, silent.
Nice write-up. 
Regardless, the 'problem' is there is still three cables sticking out behind it. What I am saying is; they need to make these with a one-and-done cable. One plug in.
I love these stands but what completely ruins it is that you need like 4 cables sticking out from it. These manufacturers cheap out and make you supply the cables so therefore making you have one for each device. 
You could absolutely make this up..

Well I'd say most people do. I mean if you have an iPhone, just open your camera app and point it at the QR code; it will automatically bring you a popup with a link to w/e it is. You dont even need to take the photo. Id imagin Android is the same. 

Nope, only you

Well with his buyout at only $150k still; any FBS program would have no problem covering that for him. 
[Klieman's base salary will be $424,480 this season. Has potential to hit nearly 500K with performance bonuses.](https://twitter.com/DomIzzoWDAY/status/987007980683124736)

His buyout remains at $150k

EDIT: Figures do not include his fees for TV appearance, car, $25K for a personal appearance fee, paid tuition for his kids, longevity bonus, football camps, etc. 
You most likely [need this](http://august.com/products/august-connect-wifi-bridge/) for your Smart Home/August setup. Its the WiFi bridge that allows you to control your August lock when outside your BT/WiFi network. As I recall, the newest model has it built in, but this one just connects to an outlet near your door and set up in the August app.
What up /u/Doug-DeMuro
This is great. However, I really hate that August makes you go into the August App to connect to your lock remotely when you're not at home. Seems really stupid that I can't just unlock my front door quickly without manually connecting remotely.

> he's going to throw us for some loops from time to time

I really doubt that. He's passing 368 off as some new and exciting adventure that's totally different that what is out there. This is Team 10 (or will be) and his normal vlogs. You can eat up his speech trying to convince his audience that its not just simply his vlogs again all you want; but you're only fooling yourself.

Now dont get me wrong, good for him for doing them again. Its a proven model and source of income and fishing net to catch some whale sponsors. More power to him; but just be honest with us.
Same. Signed up before the launched. Got an Apple TV 4 for free for the 3 month prepay.

Before this i was subscribed to the HBO streaming service for $15 a month. Added HBO and access to HBO Go for $5 a month with DirecTV Now. So that a lone is 'saving' me $10. Not to mention as a thank you for signing up when I did, DirecTV gave me my HBO access for free for a year. 

Worth every penny.
Thank you for doing this. If this is a weekly thing; awesome.

Might I suggest maybe doing an Excel file for this? That way people can filter by price or title etc.
The first season of this show was great. I enjoyed the engineering aspect of it. 
Literally any 'noise' that comes out of Cardi B's mouth.

The matte finish iPhone 7s Plus was the best looking phone Apple has made IMO. I would give anything to have that matte finish on my X.
Boosted Board's website is getting hugged *HARD* right now.

RIP.

Edit: the reason I was on their site is to see how much the Boost Board Mini X (the one hes reviewing) weighed. 17 fucking pounds? I would assume this would be something Casey would use for airports but...almost 20 lbs? Why wouldn't you just get a normal Boosted Board?
Well right. They go with Generation _X_ for every product. I was talking more of their Series X line. 
Where does Apple reference that?
Why not have it connected to your gutter? 
The worst part is their employees don't understand it either. I was in the Apple Store in St Louis when the Series 2 was launched and the Apple store employee was asking about my SS watch. I said its a 'Series 0' and they straight up were arguing with me that it doenst exist. I kept telling him, yes i know its not officially called a Series 0 but...it is. After about 10 mins of this guy telling me I was wrong and assuring me that its **ONLY** Series 1 and Series 2 out there, i left. 
Oh. I thought you mean like natively without changing the source of the audio.

With all that effort, why not just use Siri that is built into the remote? 
How?
Looks pretty dope
Why? How often are there problems where they need to take down a drone? This seems like a waste of tax payer money for such a small population. 
Again, this i the dumbest reason to complain about the HomePod. If you are buying premium speakers for both music and home theater; they are *different*. You do not use a HomePod for your TV...
Significantly? A Sonos Play 5 (which is the closest comparison to the HomePod in terms of sound quality) is $500.

If you are talking about the Sonos Play 1; then no. They are not comparable. 

Source: i own both.

Console? Why would you want to do this? music and home theater are two different things. If you are buying a premium speaker for home entertainment audio then the HomePod is not what you are looking at in the first place...

>It doesn't.

It does.

Exactly. That's why Apple themselves have stated *many* times (including the keynote for it) that is IS NOT a smart speaker that is premium. It is a premium speaker first and foremost that they added Siri to. If you buy a HomePod because of Siri; then you're shopping wrong. 

They know that this isn't suppose to be some massively adapted consumer speaker; they are going after Sonos purchasers. 
I dont understand why people think this is so outrageous. I would be willing to be nearly 90% of people interested in the HomePod are Apple Music subscribers. Not to mention, you can still use spotify to play music on the HomePod through your phone.

I've had a HomePod since day 1 and have zero complaints. 
Exactly. I don't understand why people think $360 is so much for a **premium** speaker.

This isn't a $30 amazon bluetooth speaker...

Something is definitely up with the Samsung deal. iPhones and Apple Watches have been making appearances in his videos A LOT more than usual. 
He has, been over the past 1.5 years he has been very careful in only showing his Galaxy on camera. The only time he uses an iPhone in his videos was when he was reviewing a product that primarily uses iOS for the newest updated (aka DJI)

If you look back on his videos over the past 4? months or so, you'll notice that he has been wearing his Apple Watch and showing his iPhone **a lot** more. Something tells me the Samsung deal is either gone or maybe Samsung finally realized paying him a ton to whore out their products wasn't working like they wanted. 
This picture is amazing. Very jealous of the car and trip.
jian yang?
No he can't. Its rented as is. I highly doubt subleasing is allowed for this space.
That and I wonder if he has the basement as well. Remember all that time and money that CNN spent converting that basement into a studio with all the lighting and what not...all for a white desk for some sub-par videos?

Ride a _____ while being towed by a _____?
Im sorry as im sure this is either common knowledge or in this thread but...what game is this?
Why dont they just release their stuff in like one theater? Or what Netflix should do is build one theater themselves; play their movies/shows 24/7 and charge people a few bucks to come watch it. Then essentially have their headquarters and a dope merch shop there.

Wait...so they shot the guy because he closed the door on them? Simply holding a knife in your home isn't enough cause for them to enter without a warrant...correct? 

If that is actually what happened; I see a nice check coming this guys way from the city. 
Apple defines exercise as any activity you perform that is the equivalent of a brisk walk or more. To determine exercise, your Apple Watch looks at your heart rate and movement data. That means that things you do on a regular basis like getting up and walking around your office or taking your dog for a walk probably won't raise your heart rate enough for the Apple Watch to deem it as exercise.
Well i know that large places like Disneyland have 1 to 2 hr waits, but i guess I never just thought about it and did that math that going on three rides could take 6 hours. 
It's a little 'expensive' but I think its worth it. 
Do you happen to have the link to the seller on eBay? Im curious how they even word this.
What did eBay do? I mean I understand that they can only do what they can to try and make both parties happy; that and without tracking its kinda hard to 'prove' anything.

I just sold a drone on eBay and someone did the buy it now option like an hour after i listed it. Thought, cool that was easy. Next morning i paid for the shipping label online (even took a $20 hit on it to add insurance, signature, etc. since its a $1400 drone). Shipped it out, then a few mins later they message me saying the intended to add it to their Watch List and *not* the buy it now. I mean I already shipped it out so i declined their cancel request. That and who accidentally buys it through the auction then accidentally paypals me the money? 
So essentially you go to Disneyland to go on 3 rides? How long were the rides?

This seems insane. 
Best burgers in the cities is at Red Cow. Fuck.
>  Most of what Elon's doing *appears* to be for the betterment of mankind


Weird how that works.

Measuring exercise has nothing to do with starting a workout and everything to do with your heart rate and *actually* 'working out'.

You could start a workout (an outdoor walk) and simply walk as normal and not break a sweat; not a workout. However, someone 5'11" 300lbs...that same walk would most likely elevate their heart rate and count towards a full workout. 



wtf are you bitching about? I was replying to someone that literally said :

Lol yeah I’m cheap as hell buying both peel and peel knock off cases for my 6s plus, 7 plus and X. Lol ya got me. So cheap. 
Dope.

What camera settings was this using? Phantom 4 Pro?
I have yet encountered a reason to contact Amazon regarding their Peel equivalent. You can spout Customer Service over product all you want; which is fine. 

but for me, with a sheet of plastic (as you of all people should know, is exactly what these products are) Ill take a quality or IDENTICAL product at a reasonable cost over some overpriced case that will provide you with a customer service replacement.

Like i said, there is nothing wrong with favoring their customer service; but to me id rather have the option to buy three of the Amazon version 'peel cases' and still have money left over Vs. the one Peel (even with a free replacement)

PS. The fact that you even need a replacement on a thin plastic phone case make me question the product even further.
I have had both a Peel and a Amazon knockoff Peel...do *not* buy a peel case. Just go on Amazon and find the alternative. They are incredibly overpriced. 
Iv had mine out of a case or screen protector since day one.

No scratches front or back (besides the tiny micro screen scratches that you just wont ever be able to avoid)

I think the "The Forum is a joke" attitude is a meme in and of itself.

People of Fargo, more notably /r/Fargo, seem to think they they are above the Forum and that they are horrible journalists and a terrible newspaper. Newsflash, they are just as good, if not better, than any other medium sized city's paper. They cover nearly everything major, and minor for that matter, in our area. WTF do you want them to do? If you send them an opinion column, they will 99% of the time publish it...a lot of us laugh at them for that but that is actually really great. They get people's voices and opinions out there.

I really doubt the 'true fans' are the ones that sit in nosebleeds vs literally everyone else in the arena. 

Yesterday the Forum had some joke on their site/in the paper about how Killbourne *doesn't* own downtown and they own less than you think.

Good one. Thought that was a pretty good one.
Oh absolutly. However, this logic can't be made by someone that makes countless statements and videos about how you can't 'make' a vial video or about how its never about the money; its about the art/video.

If he is 100% about the money; then just fucking say so. Don't try and paint yourself as some 'filmmaker' that cares about only making quality 'movies' (aka, YouTube videos)
Psh. Typical response from a liberal. 
I live in an apartment where there is a lot of older people. This drives me NUTS. If im in the elevator going to the underground parking, the door will open and there will be some old man/woman just standing there in the middle of the door. They just stand there expecting you to move out of their way so they can get in the elevator, but never think to move to the side to let you out. 

Fucking hate them. Every day it is this shit. 

This.

Its *very* tough going to my girlfriend's family house. They are Mexican and if anyone has had *actual* Mexican dishes...well...they suck. I know everyone's tastes are different and some people (most people) probably love it, but I don't. Most Mexican dishes are extremely dry, overcooked meats and a lot of flavorless filler (potatoes, rice, etc). I just hate it and avoid eating when im there. However, its tough because they just constantly are asking me if i want this or that. I don't want to be rude, but they just keep trying to force it. 
I know Reddit gamers love to look down on it; but the Call of Duty franchise for xbox was and is a good stress relief for myself. I use to play the Modern Warfare at my friends house for hours years ago. We would just sit there and take turns playing.

Recently (last Sunday) I finally just saw that they released a Modern Warfare Remastered (i know that it came out months ago) and I was super pumped about it. Went and bought it and have been reliving the good old years (not really)

Well I mean, lets be honest here. The type of people that will be buying a AirPower *probably* have the latest and greatest Apple products. I can't see how someone would have a S0 or S2 Apple Watch, but going out and buying a AirPower for $150-200 (presumably) 
And TBH the Series 3 is **so** worth it compared to the S0,S1, and S2.

I was honestly shocked in the speed difference. If you are an Apple Watch wearer and dont have a Series 3...get it now.

I do not live in Goldmark. However, you are 100% correct. All rental places are, for the most part, the same. They are businesses. 

What kind of experiences have you had with Goldmark? These 'reputations' you talk about are a classic example of a Reddit circle-jerk; just in real life. People hate on them and say 'fuck Goldmark' because others say it. Are they perfect and *the best*? No. Far from it.

>are all places that **appear** to be better choices than Goldmark

Oh? How so? 

>We're not talking about me.


Which one is it?



Remember everyone. Only people with shit credit and felons live in Goldmark. 


Also not incorrect? Find me *one* source on your statement. You can't just say you're not wrong with literally **zero** proof of your wild claim.

What apartment complexes are worthy of your aspirations? 
That's a pretty wild assumption you have there on a 'good majority of Goldmark's tenants'. However, not unexpected. 
It looks nice, and great job with this. However...

Why? You're placing a solid metal/plastic cylinder within a hollow plastic cylinder? Seems like it would be a pain unscrewing this every time you want to use it. 
Does Goldmark have tenants?

> I’m also OCD!

It's always interesting how people chalk up just having a preference to being tidy etc to "omg i have OCD".

You do realize that is an actual mental illness and its not something like having all your watch bands on the same notch; right?
Even with Goldmark being so shitty, im sure they will get on this as soon as possible. That is the kinda thing that they can't blame on you and will deffinetly hurt their image if a story breaks about it etc.

With that being said, obviously no one *wants* mice in their home; however its very common. Especially in the winter. I saw something years ago that was talking about in any given building, you're about 15 ft away from a mouse pretty much as all times. You just never see them. 
Nope. Its Becky.

> So a one time bonus. But the companies take advantage of that tax credit indefinitely (hypothetically of course).

Bingo.
Our company gave everyone a $1,000 bonus earlier this year because of the money they would be saving from the taxes. However, giving all 20,000 employees $1,000 still was only a fraction of the overall total amount the **saved** from this tax break. Who really ends up paying for this and making up the difference? That and people were acting as if this $1,000 is life changing. 

$1,000 is a good chunk of money and can definitely help someone out; but this isn't going to be life-changing. Id rather them keep the $1k and continue to pay in the taxes they do to fund bigger and better things. 
This one is interesting to me. Mostly because honestly...honor roll students int he 70's were, for the most part, more understanding of what they know than students now. A good example of this is, they didn't have the internet to look shit up or when they sat down and did calculus they *actually* understood what they were doing and had to manually figure it out. /respect 
Nope. No one remembers this wildly successful treat. 
>For example just because USB C years ago was using 2.0 speeds at the time, doesn't make USB-C not a faster connector.

This is the funny part of your argument. Apple hasn't released the official specs of their lightning cables; however test have been done  showing it tops out at USB 2.0 speeds (480mbps).

Where as USB-c, currently, uses USB 3.1 technology (~5Gbps). This isn't even 1/2 of what USB-c is capable of supporting as well.

There is yet another reason why USB-c is better than Lightning. If not, please show me one source showing that lightning has been data speeds, shit...how about *one* showing it has the same speed offered by usb-c.
Wait a min...so you saying: 

>Don't see why they'd switch to USB-C. It offers no benefit over Lightning. 


Your rationalization for this is "well if Apple made [product that doesn't exist] then fast charging lightning would be used."

Just so were clear here, a non existent product is what you're saying proves your point that usb-c **isn't** beneficial to lightning? lol ok dude.

It doesn't basically; it does.
I have a HomePod and love it. I have also had an echo dot and gave it away after about 2 months. Alexa was constantly going off for no reason and was **horrible** with controlling Philips hue lighting systems. If you didnt say an absolutely exact series of commands you'd get an error. However, I can say at least 3 different ways to turn off the lights in my living room, kitchen, dining room, bedrooms etc. 

But of course, as /u/Traveling_squirrel has pointed out, Reddit is an echo chamber of Siri haters.
> You may be literally the only person I've ever heard claim Siri is better than or on par with Alexa,

Minus the *countless* articles and comparisons on virtual assistants. Reddit seems to have this massive boner for shitting on Siri with no basis other than 'because'.

Apparently it is...because you keep thinking that non USB-c is currently capable of quick charge. I literally have given you sources stating this. How is it that hard to understand?
> So we can conclude that both usb c and lightning both have the capacity to quick charge.

The fact that they have literally told consumers that the only quick charge compatible cables are USB-c would help us conclude that you're wrong.

Please. Show me *one* article or source saying that non-USB-c quick charges an iPhone. 
Bingo.

Do you even own a HomePod? I feel like you don't. I have yet to have a feature advertised by Apple fail for me. Unless you're counting Siri requests that are a stretch from what they normally do on a iPhone/iPad/etc already. 

But sure, Siri totally cripples my HomePod. My music listening experience is absolutly trash because of Siri. /s

But you literally just said:

>No one besides Apple would ever dream of making a speaker without bluetooth or an aux cord
> Yes, HomePod is about music first. And it does a phenomenal job at that. But I suppose since the iPhone is first and foremost a phone, that if it had a shit camera or a crippled App Store, you’d be okay with that too?

Your 'argument' makes zero sense. You just said its 'only selling point' was that it was a speaker. That literally IS the selling point, dude. If you're buying a HomePod expecting features and an experience not provided by what Apple is even advertising or stating; you're a fucking idiot and deserve any kind of disappointment coming your way.

 Not to mention your 'what-if' argument makes zero sense as A. it doesn't have these problems and B. What about Siri functionality makes it **crippled**? 

I use my HomePod to listen to music and control basic HomeKit functions every single day and have yet to have a 'crippling' experience. 

> Siri’s gonna have to come a long way before something like this makes sense. With the current state of Siri, the only real selling point of HomePod is that it sounds really, really great.

These are the comments in the sub and /r/Apple that I can not stand.

The 'only selling point' is **litterally** the reasoning Apple gave about creating this product. People act as if Apple is trying to make an Eco. They are not. They are making a premium speaker, and added Siri to it for an added bonus. Stop mixing these two around. Apple has said *countless* times that this is a speaker and about music **first**.

> Bluetooth file transfer

That is a stupid example. (not trying to call you out or say you are stupid, you're not. Just FYI) You're using a blanket statement of 'file transfer' as if this is a common occurrence. That and you're missing the most important question; what kind of file? There are FAR more efficient options and tools for data transfer. 

Your examples are really stretching. You're talking about Apple's low level GPU accessibility (Metal) as if this is some downfall and negative experience with Apple. Are you kidding me? Not to mention holding a grudge against Apple for not voluntarily having 3rd party services be defaulted in their own OS. Give me a break. 
It is still a 'locked-in' limitation. You can't pick and choose, its either Google/Android is 100% open or its not. Just as Apple still allows you to use what you want in some way or another. Holding a grudge against Apple for not using their time and resources to allow 3rd party services within their iOS as defaults is just...stupid.

I have never understood sleep tracking for everyday consumers. What is the point? Aside from the painfully obvious 'go to bed early or on a consistent cycle' what is the point of these figures? 

It's not like you can do anything mid sleep about waking up. So essentially you are just gathering all this arbitrary information about your guessed REM cycles to do absolutely nothing with. I dunno...seems so pointless.

You mean like how Google forces you to use google maps when you type an address into google search? Or if you google a business and want to copy the address out of their web page; you can't. You can only open the address in Google Maps.

The point is; they all do this shit. Its not like Google and other companies are 100% open and free for total control and customization. 
You're getting awfully upset that an Apple product is defaulted to open webpages on their default browser.

I understand preference and what not; but what about Safari is so terrible that you hate it so much? What is Chrome on your iPhone giving you that Safari isnt? Additionally, as far as I know, Safari is the faster browser and less of a RAM hog. No?

Edit: Ok. Or just downvote instead of answering or having a conversation. 
I agree. People love to try and point out about how 'cut off' Apple is trying to make their customers to their ecosystem; I disagree. They are a business first of all, to expect them to make it, let alone encourage, the use of other's products and services is...stupid. However, what major function does Apple 100% cut your access to? Music? As far as I know, you can still download and use Spotify on 90% of their devices. My Apple TV has Plex, they don't 100% force you to watch movies from iTunes. I could go on and on.

Edit: lol Ok. Or just downvote instead of answering or having a conversation. 
> That one is pretty obvious. The Homepod is great for a living room or den, but what if I want a speaker in my kitchen or bathroom? People want high-quality, connected, multi-room sound. But not everyone wants to pay $350-700 for each room. 

Bingo. I love my HomePod and would love to have many throughout my home. However, im not going to place a $350 HomePod in my bathroom. However, a ~$150 more 'budget friendly' HomePod in my bathroom/kitchen...sure. Ill take three. 
The tip feature with a widget on my iPhone is great. Not to mention the find nearest ATMs, find nearest coffee shops is great.

> Sooo how do you go about removing the inequality while doing nothing?

Being a normal fucking human. Teaching our kids and setting examples that skin color, race, age (for the most part), religion, political views, etc. have nothing to do with how a person acts and how they perform their job. Certainly not *forcing* tolerance or 'equality' isn't going to change anything.

You can't change the mind of those that discriminate based off of this. If you think hiring a director *because* she is female is going to fix anything; you're sadly mistaken. 

What is the acceptable amount? What's the cut off?
You realize that you literally posted that you took off within the boundaries of the Everglades Wildlife Management Area...right? You see that cool little green color in your map? Know what that means?

That's my point. This is a factor for a lot of single men and women eating for one. In a lot of cases, there is a thin line of massive savings when faced with going to the grocery store and spending $50-100 in groceries; or hitting up $1 meals for the week.

For instance, my local Old Chicago has $1 slices of pizza on Tuesdays. I can get a *full* meal for $2.

I guess the point im trying to make with this is people act as if $1 for a burger or chicken sandwich isn't frugal because you can spend $15 to bring that cost down to $0.75. See what i mean? 
> Haha I kind of like keeping my spots secret.

Yeah. That response right there proves /u/jeep-benny correct.

This isn't some 'special' spot and your lack of willingness to prove you're not in a National Park when it literally would be as easy as a screenshot your log in the DJI profile; proves this. 
> A 1$ burger doesn't fill **me** up at all though. **I would need to eat 5**. Hence how my example works better for **me**. **I** can eat almost all you can eat at home for 3 meals with 10$. A $1 burger makes **me** feel sick and doesn't fill me up at all. 

ok. exactly.


No it doesn't. You're telling me that you can go buy a single roll, 3.5 oz of chicken, a single squirt of mayo, and lettuce for less than $1? lol

Yeah I'm going to go ahead and call BS on that.
> If you shopped in bulk

Iv posted this to other; that is not what I'm asking you to do. Make me **one** chicken sandwich for less than $1.20. Not go to the store, spend more money and have multiple. Why stop there? Why not go to the distributor? Why not go to the farmer? etc. 


damn...if a McChicken is $5.60 there...how much is an 'actual' chicken sandwich at McDonalds? $30?
...but you're forgetting the main aspect to why I said what I did. 


$1 < $10.
Nope. This logic doesn't work like this for what Im asking. Im asking you to make ONE chicken sandwich for $1.20. Not go to the grocery store, spend $25 and make 30.

One.

If this is the case, why stop there? Why not just buy a chicken farm and make it yourself? (extreme example, but thats my point.)
Shaunduras gives him a run for his money...
Exactly. Going and buying a McChicken for $1 and grabbing 30 napkinds doesn't mean you spent $10.
I don't know, man. I mean obviously fast food isn't healthy; so we'll get that out of the way right now.

However, its kinda hard to beat dollar menus when you're eating for one. The amount of calories provided by $1, not to mention time/effort; make it quite frugal. 

Edit: I would love for someone to attempt to make a chicken sandwich (McChicken) for less than $1.20.

Edit Edit: **A** chicken sandwich. One. Not go to the store, spend >$1.20 and have multiple. At that point, why stop there? Why not go directly to the farmer? Why not buy your own McDonalds franchise and own 3,000 McChickens for $.18? etc

Well i mean...she is/was. Its not like that role was some groundbreaking writing. She was a token character; just as Shia's character was and replaced. 

Edit: i had never heard about her audition...and i dunno. If its true, yeah thats messed up. But at the same time that article you posted is literally a he said, that he said, that she said XYZ. This is a weird time for people in Hollywood, and people in general. Its very easy to be branded something you are not by a few, or one, accusation. You don't even need to be guilty of it; as long as people think you might have done something...you're guilty. 

Disagree. The costume design, cinematography, etc are **far** more important than best actor imo. 
Agreed 100%. That and seems kinda rude/bias to have only 2 of the 5 people up for Best Song perform. 
Well *they* aren't producing the show. They are just as much out of the loop as we are. 
Naw, Hollywood has moved on from Black Lives Matter and racial equality. The new hotness for them is Time is Up and how there aren't enough women directors. 


Because it can't ever be just about talent and merit. It has to be forcibly 'equal'. 
I thought she was blacklisted because she was beefed with Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg pretty publicly and was rude etc. 
I agree it is somewhat boring...but im 100% against performances for the Oscars. They already screw over the 'little' award winners with the acceptance speech time to allow best actor/actress what seems like a full 10 mins to rant about whatever they want; while giving 1 min for best costume design. 
I wanted to see this movie; is it really that bad?
Why didn't you present last night with your fellow Star Wars co-stars at the Oscars last night? 
A little? She is unbelievably obnoxious. There is no way in hell im watching the Oscars if she is hosting. No way.

We were watching the Red Carpet show before the Oscars and Micheal Strahan was on this mini stage interviewing Daniel Kaluuya and she just straight up walks into the interview and goes something like "IM HERE!" I already hated her, but after that last night I literally walked out of the room until the show started because of her.

Those are always cool stories and interesting finds and 'deals.' However, MSRP isn't a good indication of worth. I mean, you got it for free anyways so its 100% profit if you ever sell it.

Exactly. I hate it so much. They should all get the same amount of time; and they should get rid of the performances all together. No one cares about seeing a live performance of a song up for Best Song. Not to mention that it seems extremely bias that they invite only one or two to sing their songs when other nominees are not given the chance. 

The Oscars is bullshit either way. 
Holy shit i would have died.
Age has nothing to do with it. There have been plenty of actors and actresses that were nominated at very young ages and have yet to be nominated again.
Exactly. Which is what happened.  

My biggest complaint about the Oscars is that an Oscar is an Oscar. Best Picture and Costume Design in my eyes are equal. Its bullshit that they give these 'lower' winners like 1 min to speak, then give best actress/actor 10 mins to rant about whatever they want.
Well *generally* its the director or main actor/actress that get the speech time for Best Picture. I mean...there is like ~20 on stage of that award, they can't all speak. 
Cringey...but spot on.

>Democrats, who are more likely to support this type of decision, tend to be **poor**...so that's not a very outlandish assumption.

>So you don't agree that the democratic party is the party of the **poor**? Interesting.

Wait, so the thing you do to have some 'more' fun with HomePod is tell Siri to play music by X, then while its doing that, you think of the next artist you want to play?

That is why in-screen touchID integration was such a big thing. If they can get that down; bingo. 
im split. Im glad they did it, but sometimes i really miss just resting my finger on my phone to unlock when its flat on my desk at work. I just wish they would make the viewing angle wider. 
> so as cheap as possible without being a total dump 

Again, a price range would be nice.

You can not have 'as cheap as possible' and 'without being a total dump' as your requirements. They go hand-in-hand. Pick one of the other.
.....lol

What.
You're not understanding the context in which i am talking about...

Clearly they believe that FaceID is more secure...that is obvious as it *is*. What i am saying is **IF** they would have left both, that's how it probably would have gone down to get people transitioned. 
It is fast, but its not as fast as Touch ID was when they removed it. Lets get that clear...
They should.

Last time they had this deal (during their initial launch) a bunch of people I know signed up for DirecTV Now and did the 3 month prepay. Then went into an AT&T store to see if they could just get their Apple TV there; they could and did. However the kicker is DirecTV still also sent them Apple TVs via mail. So they got two. 
Agreed. If Apple would have left TouchID on the back or something, i could see Face ID being fast as hell, but not their main authentication method for Apple Pay as an example. 
I agree. Apple could make Face ID blazing fast if they didn't run through secure level scans and just made it about 'unlocking your phone' 
And yet here you are...posting it.
I'm not sure if you are or ever have been salary in a professional workplace but how it works is you do not have 'hours'. You are paid salary because that involves coming in early/staying late to ensure your task and job function is taken care of.

That's why you are paid salary. Therefore your segment about someone sitting down for a home loan 10 mins before normal banking hours close is kinda a mute point as that's literally what their job role entails. It has nothing to do with the amount of money they make; but the terms at which they are paid. 
It really is. I was surprised (not sure why i was) when i got my X on just how much smaller it 'feels' compared to my 7s+. I know the screen is bigger...but it just felt so tiny.

For me, it will be PERFECT when they have the X design in a Plus size form. That will be the sweet spot for me. Fingers crossed for this fall.
> A better comparison would be if a server got of at 4:50, made it to the bank at 4:55, and then asked to sit down with a banker about a mortgage.

Well, considering most lenders are salary; I don't think they would have a problem with this.

That and I have been to plenty of restaurants where the doors were locked ~20 before closing. You're acting as if there is some law saying "they have to serve you". 

>And as I'm lying on my back... humiliated... I turn to the girl, and ask: "So, do you come here often?"

This is where we know this story is a lie.


Also, why would you post your real name and current work address to Reddit?...
That is such a shitty thing to do.

This is a little off topic, but still in the realm of what we are talking about. What is the acceptable time before close that you can go to a restaurant? I see it on both sides of this, as a server/cook and as a customer. I think if you close at 11 and you show up at like 10:30 that's fine, but i know others don't. That and I know *a lot* of restaurants clean up early so they can get out of there then get mad when a customer shows up. I know that sucks, but I would be willing to bet money that the actual business owner would be more than happy to receive income for their business. 

Think if this same logic was at a place like a bank. Lets say you're a server at a restaurant and you need to deposit your check and you get off at 5. The bank closes at 5, so you are able to close early and make it over to the bank at 4:50 only to find the staff at the bank wanted to leave early; so they did. How pissed would you be?
No. Dont bother with anything other than Anker.
Search Anker Lightning cables in Amazon. Literally they best and only 3rd party cables to get for your Apple devices. 
very possibly, however until an official announcement is made by Apple; im going with the X being the smallest. 
Ya know...besides literally everything but the chassis being replaced...
I agree. I think going forward, the smallest iPhone will be the size of the X.

Did you even read what you sited? It's within your own link.

>FAA official on media call: Autonomous flight is allowed if operator is in place to jump in if needed and drone is within sight.

Reading comprehension is key. Again, they **do not** have 'special rules' for autonomous flights. If so, please provide me with an FAA link to these 'special rules'. They fall within the same guidelines as human piloted for non commercial use (aka, Casey)

But again, what do i know? I only spent hours studying and taking the practice test and the full test for UVAs with the FAA. 
You do realize their drone stunt was done on a mountain...in December...after it was shut down...with permits. Right? 
>They have special rules. 

What? You're joking right?

As someone who has taken the FAA's remote pilot certificate; there are no 'special rules' for autonomous flying UASs. 
Oh I totally get that. However, its not Hector that is controlling the airfare prices. That's the airlines. Not a single thing they can do about it.

Hector brings in *a lot* more money for the FM area than people realize. People in our area (and people visiting to be honest) love to rag on Hector for being so small and crappy etc etc...well this is how you change that. It's very similar to the Red River Zoo's 'problem' in the community. People bitch about how small it is and say that's why they dont go. Well, if you don't put money into it; it will never grow.

Works, Thank you!
Why? You can connect your Apple TV to it if you'd like. You can airplay to if from your PC...
This is the formula that I have not. It worked when I tried only the first two formulas, but when I kept going it gives me the error that there are too many arguments in the formula:

>=IFERROR(INDEX(Maria!$A$2:$D$21,MATCH('Rep Monthly QA'!A3,Maria!$A$1:$A$20,0)-1,2),INDEX(Caitlin!$A$2:$D$21,MATCH('Rep Monthly QA'!A3,Caitlin!$A$1:$A$20,0)-1,2),INDEX(Demetric!$A$2:$D$21,MATCH('Rep Monthly QA'!A3,Demetric!$A$1:$A$20,0)-1,2),INDEX(Derek!$A$2:$D$21,MATCH('Rep Monthly QA'!A3,Derek!$A$1:$A$20,0)-1,2),INDEX(Joe!$A$2:$D$21,MATCH('Rep Monthly QA'!A3,Joe!$A$1:$A$20,0)-1,2),INDEX(Lynsee!$A$2:$D$21,MATCH('Rep Monthly QA'!A3,Lynsee!$A$1:$A$20,0)-1,2)))))
That worked perfectly, thank you very much!

The only thing I wish shows like this would *not* do is the 'previously on' intros. Whenever they show a clip from an interaction that happened like a season ago or whatever its almost like a spoiler for that episode. 
Came to post this.
This. 
Random question; what are you trying to stream from your phone in 4k that you can't pull up with your Apple TV directly? 
I've owned an Alexa device and gave it away. It was HORRIBLE with controlling my home's Hue lighting system. If you didn't say EXACTLY what it was, it wouldn't work. 

Another thing that Homekit/Siri doesn't get enough credit for. It responds to your HomeKit devices in a real way; not some exact phrase. 
This is a no-win situation for Apple with people like you. They came out with an *amazing* product that plays music; and does that extremely well. All Siri tools for listening to music is perfect. This is what you and I were buying.

Then when they add features, such as what you described, read/send text, weather, news, control HomeKit enabled devices, set timers, alarms, answer most generic questions and you're upset.

100% promise you that if they would have just locked out all Siri interactions other than music requests you'd be bitching about that. There is literally **no** winning with users like you. If you wanted something to act like your Google Home, then buy a Google Home. 

Edit: This isn't a dig at you, im just talking about people in general. There is this weird stigma that Siri is just absolute garbage and that Google/Amazing is light years beyond it...but that's far from the case. Go on Youtube or somewhere and watch an actual Virtual Assistant comparison (unbiased) and you'll see that they are all mostly on par with each other. [Here is a great example to start with that mkbhd did.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkpAro4zIwU)
This is the problem with the HomePod. Not the lack of Siri 'advancements' but the lack of people listening to Apple about what they designed. People keep expecting this to be a Google Home/Eco competing product; its not. 


Apple has said *countless* times that this is a premium speaker that they added some Siri functionality to. Not the other way around. Why do we all keep acting like Siri interactions was 100% the purpose of the HomePod; because its not.

> I really wish the alarm app worked with homekit though.

That would be cool. 

> turn on the space heater

Use an oil-filled portable radiator unit. Might be more expensive upfront but it is MUCH safer and wont leave your air dry.

If you're going to be doing this, make sure your portable AC unit has a physical on/off switch or knob. If its digital, which nearly all are, the unit could be on and running smoothly - you tell Siri/Homekit to turn the switch off and the AC unit will power off. However, when you tell Siri/Homekit to return power to the AC unit if its digital you will have to physically press the power button. 
Where? Link please.

**Please note. The AirPower is not three separate charging bases glued together; it is one unit that charges multiple devices regardless of where it is placed on the mat.**
Honestly...go to HDMovieCodes.com

Iv been using it for about a month now and its great. You can pick up HD and 4k iTune codes for next to nothing.
Seriously though.

*Everyone* was playing it and everyone was just so 'chill' with each other for like two months. You'd pass by someone outside with their phone in their hand, and 80% of the time you'd end up having some sort of interaction.

A good friend of mine lost a bunch of weight and met his current girlfriend playing Pokemon Go. They formed a club in Lincoln Nebraska and have a ton of people involved in it all to this day. 
A lot of people take party buses to the bar in Hickson (Knickerbocker Liquor Locker) and the Wild Rice Bar. They aren't far from Fargo but offer you plenty of time to enjoy a few on the bus. People also go out to Haggies in Mappleton on party buses for the same reason. Then once you go out to those bars out of town and come back into town, hit up the bars in South Fargo or West Fargo.

Whatever you do, do not go downtown with a party bus; that is an absolute waste of time and money. 
There is no 'extra heat'. It is the same as if you were charging via a lightning cable. Its Thermodynamics.

And according to [this article](https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-airpower-the-new-apple-wireless-charging-system), it offers fast charging.

>The thing is, unlike most features on an Apple product, this "fast charging" is barely noticeable and not a major improvement to the experience.

As a iPhone X user with a Samsung fast wireless charger, I diagree with you. I use these everyday...
What? 90% of Samsung wireless fast chargers are 9 watts. 

The point is; you claimed its not fast charging. However...it is. You can say 'barely' all you want; but it is.
TIL; 7.5 watts isn't fast charging.
Exactly. People are freaking out that Apple is most likely going to charge $150-200 for a wireless charger that can support up to three devices to fast charge; but yet don't bat an eye at Samsung's $89 single wireless fast chargers? ok.
>Sure it doesn’t charge multiple devices on the same mat

Exactly.

> but I’m not paying 10x the price for that feature

Then don't? I really don't understand the hate on the price. This is a wireless charging pad that will fast charge at least three devices at a time for $150-200; and people freak out. [However, Samsung sells an $89 wireless charger for one device and thats fine?](https://www.target.com/p/samsung-174-fast-charge-wireless-charging-convertible-black/-/A-52697003?sid=61S&ref=tgt_adv_XS000000&AFID=google_pla_df&CPNG=PLA_Electronics+Shopping_Local&adgroup=SC_Electronics&LID=700000001170770pgs&network=g&device=c&location=9020758&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIz_XI0bO82QIVAahpCh07zA73EAQYAyABEgIUtPD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)

You don't sound irrationally bitter towards Taylor Swift at all...
So? Please explain to us all how every song *should* be written. 
You mean like counter suing a DJ that sexually assaulted her for $1 to prove a point? When people talk about how “fake” celebrities are....it’s stupid. You don’t know her, so how do you know how someone is?
I would hope so.

And don't call me Shirley. 
I don't know. I think Taylor Swift gets this stigma about how all her songs are breakup songs and this and that. When in reality, she's dated the same amount of guys as most 20-something year old girls do. That and why is it ok for John Legend and many other artists to sing nothing but love/breakup songs...but not her? I think there is this double standard with her people have.

So using your own link; yes. It is a switchblade.
Well tbh...isn't it?
I enjoy Mail Time a lot. I think its just interesting seeing what products people sell him. 
I agree. One of two things is happening here. 

1 - OP is using a VSCO preset (or something similar) that is adding grain and not wanting to say so. 


or


2 - Something is wrong with their drone.
I posted exactly what /u/honzayk said when you uploaded an image to this sub last week.

IDK what you're using to export or edit your images but that is not right. You do not gain *that* much grain or lose image quality that much going from RAW to jpeg. 

Something isnt right. Your images should not be this grainy...
Well that's not what we are talking about. OP is asking for something that does this. /u/Ven0m3886 said it doesn't exist and that all lock or door opener actions require user approval. We're not talking about HomeKit only-actions.
This isn't true. I have a August smart lock that unlocks automatically when i get within 30ish feet of my home. It was set up in the August app for auto-unlock. 
I purchased and installed the August 2nd Gen lock in our Apartment about 2 weeks ago. Bought a August Connect sensor and plugged it in near the door as well. That way I can lock/unlock when outside of the house/network. 
If the drone pilot was following the correct protocol for his UAV; their FAA number should be listed somewhere on their drone from when it was registered. This is the exact reason why the FAA required the number be somewhere on it. So they can find out who's it is. 
Then I suppose the "what are those?" joke just completely blew you away. 
How? If you're *that* impressed by that level of acting I can only imagine what the Emoji Movie will do to your brain. 
> Killmonger is the first villain since Loki to steal the movie away from a Marvel title character.

But...he didn't. Like honestly. He wasn't terrible by any means, but he didn't steal the movie away; not by a longshot.
Ideally you'd break even and not owe them anything or get anything back. That way you are holding onto your money throughout the year. However, unless you are living paycheck to paycheck; I know a few people that essentially look at it as having someone else hold onto ~$2,000 for them to get back in the spring. I mean you can always make more money off that with investments, but most will not so whatever. 
It is bought with your refund; not your return. They are not the same thing.

Most important IMO.
You mean like the Siri function on the Apple TV 4 and up?...
There is no argument. If you're telling me that Black Panther *hasn't* had article and media posts about the black community supporting it before its release then you're living under a rock. Shit. How many posts on Reddit where there over the past couple months about the whole "white people can't see it on opening night yada yada" thing? 

You can plug your hears and hum all you want; its out there. 
Well, I suppose I'm going off film canon much like Star Wars. They said that the powers were stripped...so they were stripped. 
lol Jesus Christ, dude. No wonder you're so bitchy about your HomePod. You are literally shooting yourself in the foot. You're complaining about practicality with Siri and listening to music and how the lack of Spotify on your HomePod is bad; but yet [just ignoring the information provided by Apple on what audio sources are supported.](https://www.apple.com/homepod/specs/)


I give up with this discussion. Again, you've made up your mind on what you want out of your HomePod. Good luck.
Ok, since you didn't answer my question before; You're telling me that you bought a HomePod and do not have an Apple Music subscription? That's what you're saying?
Yup. That's the joke. You got it. Congrats.
We get it, Reddit. You like Deadpool.
And yet here you are...bitching about how horrible apple is for not building in the ability for you to use your $120 Spotify subscription on their products. What assholes.


(also, i know its hard to understand but Apple Music is $9.99 a month. Not sure where you're getting $160 from other than the exaggerate your narrative. 10*12= 120) 
[I hate it when people use the 'youre doing it wrong' meme but in this case...you are doing it wrong. You're telling me that you bought a HomePod and do not have an Apple Music account? (which includes iTunes Match for free in it btw)? That is like complaining that you can't use your Apple Watch on your iPhone 4s. "I mean, its an apple product...why doens't it just work?!"](https://imgflip.com/i/24pm92)
Because if he **had** his super powers at that point in the movie i wouldn't care. But at that point he was normal like you and me....so huge plot hole. 
thanks for sharing. Just can never tell when people are making us BS for karma. 
Well no. That's not really what we are talking about. They can't just come in whenever just to look around; their has to be a reason outlined in their rights as Landlords. 
But...it...does. Look. I get what you are saying, but this is also the real-world. Someone buying a $350 Apple speaker 99.9% of time *has* Apple Music and can play whatever song, station, genre etc they want. 


You're literally looking for a reason to be upset. MONTHS ago when they announced this Apple themselves said this is **NOT** a smart speaker. This is a premium high end speaker first, with the added bonus of haivng Siri second. You need to remember this. The HomePod's competitor isnt an Eco Dot. Its a Sonos play 3/5. 
Well I don't think they ever would. Just like im sure the RT or Meta accurately reflects really how the Emoji Movie is (Not saying the Emoji is ok...i never have seen it, nor will I.)
This is a common myth about jumping into water from very high. It was tested by Mythbusters and shown to be false. 

>Eventually, they managed consistent drops (mostly just below 300 g), finding that the hammer reduced the impact slightly, but the 150-foot (46 m) fall would still be lethal.


It's not the surface tension that kills, it's the change in acceleration. That can't be prevented or slowed by affecting the surface. Unless you can somehow get the density to change from air to water over several tens of meters.
Ok. I get it.

However, for me, just know that until some sort of proof; im going to call BS. (which is fine. who cares.)
BINGO.

I was going to post that our local radio morning show did this EXACT same thing last year. 

/u/AquidneckIsland is lying. 
Idk what you're so upset about? You act as if Apple having their product support their other product natively and giving you the ability to use Spotify through AirPlay on it, is the worst thing in the world.

Its pretty clear that you've made up your mind on what you want to think of it. 

End of the day, you said: 

>but they all support Spotify. Except HomePod.

Which is wrong. The HomePod will most definitely support and play Spotify; through AirPlay. 
Are we all going to just ignore the fact that a ~300 ft fall into water wouldn't kill someone on impact?....
> just as there are many blacks who will upvote just because there are blacks in the film.

Bingo.

I thought it was good, but its not anywhere near my favorite Marvel movie. Its a good movie, but that's about it. I dont see where all this amazing praise is coming from. 

Its like Deadpool and Reddit. Anyone not saying its amazing is just some person 'that dont like black people' but there are countless people praising it simply because its a 'black film'. Just see it for what it is, people. A Marvel superhero movie. 
idk i disagree. I saw Black Panther last night and i thought it was good; but not 97% good. The story line was weak. Not saying it wasn't a good movie...but I think it's hyped because of the racial movies the media and reddit is making it to be. 
Well tbh i was hoping when they asked them what his country could possibly contribute to the world; i was hoping he would turn on his BP suit. That would have been sweet.

Sure it does. Play it on your phone and AirPlay it to the HomePod. 
> Single timer.

Ill give you that one. I would love to know their reasoning for this. It has way more than enough RAM for it.

>No spotify. 

This is a stupid thing to complain about. Do we then hold Echos, Google Home, etc. as a negative score because they don't support my Apple Music subscription?


>Worst in class general question answering.

This is false as well. Do yourself a favor and **actually** do some research on Virtual Assistant reviews. They are all mostly on par. There are *countless* videos on this, but people like you just go along with the 'Siri Sucks' cirlcejerk. [Here is a great example and unbiased real-life review you can start with.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkpAro4zIwU)

>Most unnatural sounding speaking voice. 

Also false. Again, do yourself a favor and change the voice. I have mine set to Australian Female and it is *by far* the most natural sounding VA out there on this (to me)

>No calendar integration.

Ill give you that one as well, but Im curious what you would like your HomePod to do? I mean, are you looking for a HomePod to replace your phone?
Like what? People rip on Siri a lot but never give any examples of why.
The only problem i have with these is that the cord ruins it. You can't see it in your photo because its dark, but that just makes them look super tacky when its not dark IMO.

Not sure how they can fix it but w/e
This is clearly above 400 ft...
If you gave the appropriate notice of not renewing your lease and they are showing your apartment to a potential buyer; yes. (again, most do not do this and give a 24-hour notice...but they can choose to not)

This shouldn't be a surprise to any renter. It's very clearly written out in your lease. 
Dude, we aren't talking about 'disrespectful' this is a chain replied talking about tenants 'rights' and the lawfulness of it. As I said in my first reply in this thread, most places give 24 hours as a courtesy(mostly because it gives people time to clean their shit up so they aren't embarrassed and make the apartment look better for the person interested). The apartment complex I have experience with is a high-end building with the average unit around $900. Not really sure why you seem to think that the practice differs from the 'expensive apartments'. So again, this is a black and white discussion on the legality of right-to-entry; not what is nice and respectful. Which, again, is a normal of 24 hours notice; however they can enter whenever they have someone interested in looking at the unit.

Best of luck on being an internet expert. That's Mr. Manager to you. ALL CAPS.
North Dakota Law: 

>LANDLORD RIGHT OF ENTRY

>A landlord may enter a dwelling unit:

 

>A. At any time in case of emergency or if the landlord reasonably believes the tenant has abandoned the premises, or the tenant is in substantial violation of the provisions of the lease or rental agreement.

 

>**B. During reasonable hours, and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspecting the premises, making necessary or general repairs, decorations, alterations, improvements, or agreed services.**

 

>C. During reasonable hours and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of showing the rental unit to actual or potential purchasers, insurers, mortgagees, real estate agents, potential tenants, workers or contractors.

 

>Unless it is impractical to do so, the landlord must attempt to get the tenant's consent for an agreed time of entry. The landlord may not abuse the right of access or use it to harass or intimidate the tenant.

 

>NOTE: Consent may be presumed from the tenant's failure to object to access after reasonable notice is given. The tenant may not unreasonably deny access to the dwelling unit. 


And FYI, a knock on the door is notice of showing. 

Again, source; I ALSO WORK AS A MANAGER AT AN APARTMENT COMPLEX. 
Again, its not illegal. 
It's not illegal. You are wrong. They can show their apartments once you give a notice of not renewing your lease at any time. Most give a 24 hour notice as a courtesy; but they legally do not have to.

Source: Backup manager at an apartment complex.
Not that im aware of. Only lock (like the HomePod)
Yes. Your phone/watch will lock and unlock your smart lock. You can only lock via HomePod.
Same. Season 2 was a huge let-down.
I agree. I always thought it was kinda dumb they dont release an episode a week. 

Makes sense. Could you imagine how much buzz/media/press Netflix would get each week if they did an episode every Friday of Stranger Things?
Yes.
> Should Apple disable HomeKit lock functionality on iPads too?

It has been removed since iOS 10.8 i believe. Unlocking, not locking. 
> What was removed? The ability to ask Siri to unlock a door when no password is set? Yes. 

Yes...you know...what we are talking about.

>But not the ability for Siri to unlock a door pee say because she will still do it but ask you to show your face on iPhone X.

Ok? No one is talking about that.

Exactly
...exactly. That is why we are talking about hands-free actions. Hence, HomePod. No one is saying you can't unlock your door via Siri on your phone. 

Don't believe me? Try and unlock your Door from HomePod.
Nope. Wont open it.

>Update: Apple points that hands-free "Hey Siri" functionality will work with every HomeKit accessory with the passcode turned on, just not for **doors lock or garage doors**.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2016/09/21/apple-homekit-siri-security/#74f9ae6b62e5


It is directly related to outside the home securty threats. It was removed in iOS 10.1.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/aarontilley/2016/09/21/apple-homekit-siri-security/#74f9ae6b62e5
That or having someone unlock your house while you are sleeping...
I agree, until some sort of voice recognition is in place that is relatively high in security; having HomePod tell me to unlock my phone defeats the purpose. At that point I would just use Siri on my phone to unlock the door.
Nope. I was reading about how it was removed due to security issues with people accessing the voice commands via windows or mail slots. Better safe than sorry.
What was this shot at? I like the image but that is grainy as hell.
>  It looks like a DSLR took the photo

Click the image and focus on the cars upfront and you will not think this.

I like the image...but this is crazy grainy. 

Because a Phantom 4 Pro's image is significantly better...because the Phantom series performs significantly better in windy conditions. 
Well, the Phantom series does significantly better in windy conditions.
And i have owned a Stainless Steel Series 0 (zero scratches obviously) since day 1 Apple Watch launch and a Sport Series 3 (no scratches) since January of this year.

I know that eventually a scratch will occur on the sport...because its glass and not sapphire. 


If you are trying to say that something changed between the ionX glass from the Series 0, 1, and 3...it hasnt. 
Have a HomePod and apartment; can also confirm...yes.
Uh hate to break it to you but its literally impossible for granite to scratch sapphire crystal. If it did...it's not sapphire crystal.


Edit: Not sure why this is downvoted...its a scientific fact...
I don't know what you're expecting here? You didn't get the sapphire screen...what do you expect? 
What kind of switches did you use for what devices? I find the only switches i need are for my Hue system, and for those i just use the dimmer switches that stick onto the wall.
Or just a one time fee. If its a cool game and gets you moving and motivated, i see no problem in paying like $5-10 for it.
As a Day 1 SS S0 owner; the change to the S3 **is** worth it. Its not even close the change in speed battery life etc. 
The only thing i can see that would cause them to change it is a drastic change the the thickness of the watch. Which I dont think is coming soon; and when it does eventually happen...who can blame them. I dont expect them to keep the design of this the same forever. I mean think about it, they already have allowed us to use the same bands from series 0 to series 3 for almost 4 years now.
Ok those make sense.
Wouldn't you take your devices with you?...
Idk, i just fine lugging around a 5.5 lb premium speaker to a gym as somewhat ridiculous. If you're bringing a speaker to a private gym every morning, chances are you already have a bluetooth speaker. That and you should really invest in some AirPods then. You'll love them a lot more than lugging that around. Im not trying to attack you or anything like, your belongings, do what you want with them. Just seems...ridiculous. 


PS. I just think its funny already hearing "i bring mine to the a private gym every evening' seeming as how it was released last Friday. TIL: Every evening = the past 2 evenings. 
How? I mean im not saying your idea isn't good, but i guess i dont see how a $350 premium speaker would be education focused?
I had this exact same problem 4k Apple TV in my living room was just called 'living room' but when i added my HomePod it was called Living room (2). Renamed my Apple TV "Living Room Apple TV" (as i have 4 in my house), then the HomePod as "HomePod" hard reset my phone and it changed. I think it just needs a moment for it all to sync. 
I saw this on Amazon the other day when I was curious if there were accessories for the HomePod yet. I honestly do not understand the point of it. When or would would you be transporting your HomePod enough to warrant a leather 'case'? I just don't get it. 
> Casey lands one of the most coveted interviews in recent years.

uhhh...
Agreed. While that's great they added this; I will never go back to them from MidCo because knowing Cable One...they will just remove that feature a few years down the line. 
I did see a clip of a running stun where he actually jumped between two rooftops. Broke his ankle too. 
Tools? Would you like me to include a Philips screwdriver, a rag (for stain) and a pull saw? Tack on another $10. You're really reaching to make this $70 piece of pipe and wood worth it; aren't ya? 

Tools to thread pipe? Dude. They are pre-threaded. Do you have hands? Or would you need to purchase those? 
That honestly could be it. 

But then again, there are a few places here in Fargo that if you don't follow the cult obsession with it; you'll get downvoted. JL Beers, Junkyard, Sandys, any of the 'taco' trucks, etc. 
lol What?

Here ya go, this is Home Depot only. So price it out cheaper looking around. Not to mention this is more pipe than you even need.

Looks great
Ill tell you this much though, they are 1,000X better than the trash they serve at that truck that's parked at Fargo Brewing Co.
Well seeming as how a majority of my friends, and SO (who is Mexican) tells me that this is not authentic in any way, and that their food is not gluten free; I'm going to go with that. 

Also, psstt...they don't exclusively use corn. But if you think so, go for it.

About as authentic as Sweet-o-Burrito or w/e it is.

edit: I see I triggered /r/Fargo again.
Please tell me this post is a joke. $60 + shipping for about $10 in Home Depot supplies.
Them: "Authentic Mexican Tacos"

Also Them: We're gluten free!

k.

Edit: edit: I see I triggered /r/Fargo again.
No, it was for scuba diving, not Target.
I thought I was alone. Thank you.

I do not understand Fargo's obsession with Sandys. Hornbachers or really any grocery store have just as good, if not better, donuts. 

Every single time I get Sandys, its on the verge of being stale. Pass. Paradise Donuts (Sweet Rings) was/is FAR better. 

edit: oooo the sandys cirlcejerk crowd is out in /r/Fargo today!
They burned a witch on C-SPAN dude...yes it was.
The Dutch Secret Service just sounds...delightful. 
I don't know about what area you live in; but around here a  lot of people have blue porch lights for 'honoring' fallen police officers. 
Yeah no problem. Well Financial Institutions and card issuers make money off you spending and using their cards to start with. Merchants are charged a % of the total sale as a fee for accepting Visa/MasterCard/Amex/etc. same with the card issuers. So even paying your bill off each month in full, banks are still making money off you using your card. Its a win/win/win.
What are you talking about 'rent'? 

How it works is your use your credit card, then as long as you pay your full statement balance at the end of the month/next month/end of cylce date; you are not charged intrest. 

Therefore, if you use your credit card and pay your bill in full each time, its essentially the exact same as if you are using a debit card. The only difference is (based on your type of credit card/program) you receive rewards for using it. Therefore, you're money ahead. 
Step 1: Brewery

very very mediocre beer. Not trying to be a beer snob, like what you like, but to me...Killstone is stale Fargo Brewing Co.
Should be interesting. Glad a business is moving into that space that is a little more welcoming and inviting to visit.

Hopefully their beer is good. Im glad we are getting more options out there but please don't be on par with Killstone or that Praire one (over by Pizza Ranch) 
I don't pay a dime more using my Credit Card as I would using my Debit Card. In fact, I'm money ahead using my credit card. 

The only time that not using a credit card to pay for something is a good idea is if you have zero self control. 
What?
I guess iv been lucky. I've always had them deliver on time. In fact, if you look back in my post history you'll see that Best Buy actually sent me my Apple TV 4K a day before it was supposed to be launched. 
Well...go get it.
No problem. Papa Bless.
Get dem points, dawg
If you're an Elite Plus member. (thankfully? i am.)
Same. Last night and early this morning I went to Best Buy's website and searched HomePod and didn't see any indication that they were going to do Pre Ordering or anything. I shrugged it off as oh well. Then went to Apple when it was opened; then realized Best Buy *did* have this option. They should have put a banner up or something. 
Ordered in white via Apple...then came on here to see what others were up to and saw someone ordered through Best Buy. I would much rather get points from my credit card & Reward Zone points; not to mention just go to my Best Buy that's 5 blocks from work on 2/9 and pick it up.

So canceled my order with Apple and went with Best Buy. 
This was shot on a cell phone...You're acting as if they had a film crew on stand by. Oh wait, its a freaking news station. They do and it takes them all of 30 seconds to do this.

But that's not really their market. People are acting as if the HomePod is a Google Home or Alexa rival. Its not. It's a premium speaker first, then an assistant. If you are buying a Google Home for music quality then you are going to be disappointed. Just like if you buy a HomePod to only do Siri tasks you will be disappointed. 
>  I have no life, and I'd love to piss this dude off every day.

This is the level of petty I was I could be. 
What was pointless? WDAY using their own resources to take 2 mins out of their broadcast to honor one of their employees efforts and work? Yeah...pointless. 
I agree. I mean its not horrible pizza. Don't get me wrong. But something like Maddios for instance, same exact taste and quality and is cheaper and much faster. 
I just use my drone for photography and videography. Nothing terribly serious. 
I forgot timely too. Takes like 45 mins + to get a pizza there. 

edit: word
Most overpriced and overrated pizza in Fargo.
Are you a Vikings fan?
What did you drop it on? I could see this with a Stainless Steel model as they are more brittle. But I thought the Sport would prevent this. 
Fair enough. 

not trying to call you out or anything. Apple Care is the way to go always.
Apple Care for your watch is $50 + $69 service fee for replacement. ($119 total + tax)

The cost of repairing a screen, out of pocket, is $229.


I mean obviously Apple Care is the way to go and is cheaper but to just check up a $220 job as not worth it on a $450 device?  come on..
$400+?

Where are you getting this price for a screen replacement? 
How about we make an even newer answering machine message with even more pep? 
Seems like Telecris (spelling?) is the more favorable option now with college kids etc. They run payment boost promos like constantly now, and if you don't donate for like 2/3 weeks they will send you a coupon for like an additional $20 for when you do come back. I think right now if you start donating for the first 5 or six donations you get $50 a time. 


the only downside I find with it is Biolife had a nice online scheduling system years back when I donated. Telecris was walk in and 50/50 on if you wait or not. However, they might have reservations now. idk 
I literally booked a room out of the blue about a month ago (mid December)...
I do too. I listen to my friends playlists and what my friends are listening to all the time.

Exactly The whole time I was watching it I was thinking this is a recreation of the Generation Mobile video. I don't know if that is a good or bad thing. Good content..but feel like its trying to be 'the old way' idk
HoDo and Raddison vacancies would say otherwise...
I wouldn't think so. However, pizza ordered to hotels is extremely common. I would assume a very large chunk of the business would be from hotel guests. That and a large group of people are always in the bar at the Holiday Inn. A surprising amount each weekend actually. 
"They yelled Fuck you to Millie!"

Boo fucking hoo. 
Bingo. The media is just feeding into this as it gets shared thousands of times by salty Vikings fans trying to distract themselves from being utterly humiliated. They need something to play the victim card.
As an Eagles fan living in the heart of Vikings country; can you please send me a link to this...for science. 

They are salty AF. Don't worry, they will move on to play the victim to another team soon enough. 
They get SO butthurt. You wouldn't believe the shit I see and hear from salty Vikings fans for the past 2 days.
Go fuck yourself. Its Z.

I can't see it being wildly successful. I mean it'd be cool to stay there if you're visiting...but all the big money companies that bring the money in for like meetings/conferences etc aren't going to be downtown...

Wentz is the future. Foles is amazing however.

I think, after we win the Super Bowl, Foles will be a hot ticket. The Eagles should capitalize and trade to pick up some OL. 
They only started doing this stupid chant in 2015 when they opened the new stadium, and even then they stole it from some soccer club in Europe.

The point is value is determined by each person...

A $1 Mc Chicken to you is a value; a $7 sandwich from Chick-Fil-A is a value to someone else. 
> meets my expectations 100% of the time

Wait...so what you're saying is **IN YOUR OPINION** that is a great value? Weird how it works like that. 
Oh, my God, that's disgusting! Naked pics online? Where? Where did he post those? 

Ugh, those disgusting porno sites! I mean, there's so many of them though! Which one?!
Because you got two notifications on you phone over the course of how many years?

Sensitive much?
Where do you go for chicken sandwiches for less?....

(waiting for you to say a McChicken)
> but it's not something I'd go out of my way for. 

Then don't.

I don't get the hate places like these get when they open and the FM area gets excited for it and have long lines. Its new. People want to try new things.
No, you dont notice at all.

I agree.

I dont get why reddit loves to rip on Siri so much but yet acts as if Google Home or Alexa is just top notch. They are all the same, if anything Siri is better in some areas. 

I have philips hue bulbs throughout my whole house and I gave my echos away because they simply would not work without failing a few times when doing the simplest things such as changing the living room blue. 

There are COUNTLESS comparison videos on Youtube of the virtual assistants, and they are mostly stack up the exact same; but this sub and most of Reddit just blindly think Siri is the absolute worst. 

Here is a perfect example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkpAro4zIwU
Guess this doens't make much sense to me. Why would you be on someone elses account on the homescreen and do this? 
AY OH!!!!
And yet you have other options on iOS other than a headphone jack-less iPhone. Weird. 

The irony in this is that your comparing an Operating System vs. a single manufacturer. This 'debate' is apples and oranges. If you're talking about OS vs OS; there are plenty of iPhones that have headphone jacks. If you're talking about iPhone 7-X vs. Pixle 2's or Note 8's etc. then that makes sense. 


Edit: Classic Reddit Apple debate. Downvote because "Andorid is better, sheeple!"
You're not getting it.
Dude...

 Im not disputing climate change. What im saying is if you are going to **debate someone/something** and have a show around it. You need both sides; regardless if you believe it or not. 
IDK man, I have found with nearly every discussion, there are cased on both sides on reddit. The whole reddit circlejerk thing isn't really true. Unless its Deadpool. How do people love that movie so much? 
Exactly. Like im not one to say that climate change is a hoax or not real etc, but if you're going to have a 30 mins show on the debate of climate change actually have a debate and show sides of an argument. Dont just yell at whatever poor sap you bring on and talk to your audience like they are idiots. 
He, over the past few years, has become very full of himself. His newest show on Netflix is a prime example.

Bowties prices are about to tank.

Jesus. Forgot about that.
Agreed. It makes no sense how they install them. They have the screws for the key/opener on the OUTSIDE of the unit. All you have to do is unscrew them, touch the wires, and it opens. What a friend of mine did to his was take it off, and mount it from the inside of the garage with the hole still accessible.

The sad part is, this is 100% true.

North Dakota State University Bison here. On behalf of all NDSU fans (Carson Wentz's college): You're welcome. 
I traveled to Youngstown this past season for the NDSU game and overall Youngstown was a decent place. However, once walking into the stadium; took a 180. Everyone I interacted with beyond then was a dick. 
As someone living in Fargo (right next to Minnesota) yes. Vikings fans are unbearable. 
Eagles (Carson Wentz) fan from North Dakota checking in. Surrounded by Vikings fans, can not wait for the Eagles to crush the Vikings. Even without the Ginger Jesus. 
nevermind its an indoor stadium..
Sara D is literally cancer. The fact that its a direct rip off Casey is just cringe.

Came to post exactly this...

He makes videos now about making videos. How many times is he going to boast about making a 'movie' about making a 'movie?'
Could you ELI5 why they go on that side? 
/u/wutsurname

We having a end of season winner thread or?
I guess that is how opinions work. So again, please explain to me how the Moorhead Sams Club was **far** nicer than Fargo's?
Haven't you heard?! The community LOVES the Unity video! Such a fun and hip way to connect with the youth!
How? They are literally the same store.
If you buy a lot, well not even a lot, but often in bulk; having both is great.

Some things are great and found at Costco, others are best bought at Sams Club. 
One the one, and biggest, thing i can think of is our punter was hurt after the first kick. Therefore every single punt and starting drive position for JMU was a 'what-if' situation. Our special teams was **not** a normal performance. 

Also, if turnovers are the major 'what-if's for JMU...I think SDSU would like a word.
Eh, i wouldn't say 'nicer'. They are essentially the exact same store; just different layouts. 
Doesn't surprise me. FM area doesn't need to Sams Club. That one was dead every time I went (3 or 4 times).


Also...to the other person that commented on this; you're shadowband bruh.
> So many moments where I could ask "what if JMU...".

That can go both ways...
> Could care less about bison

You could?
As someone that was sitting 1st row on JMUs side...yes there was.
Im assuming you were not in Frisco. Both benches cleared, but only after that JMU player threw a punch. How he wasn't ejected from the game, I have no idea.
Seriously miss Anish.
I think Weber State would like to have a word with you then...
lol classic.
something looks different around here...but yet feels at home.
It was good. About 5000
JMU ARE THE GUYS WHO THE STRIPPERS DONT LIKE. 
Not to mention there was a prominent NFL scout there...Carson pretty much needed to play one more time to show them something. 
Bump. I have a couple hundred BluRays/DVDs that im looking for a way to get into iTunes. 
$85 for $100? That's a bad deal bro.
Im thinking so. 
The Juice Press/Hot Sauce merch thing is just...stupid.

If you watched Casey on Hot Ones you would see that he is definitely not a 'hot sauce' guy. So to me this is pretty clear that all the involvement Casey had with this is placing a photo on the bottle. 
I think Beme wants to move on from Beme. Their videos are terrible. 
I agree. I wish he would just admit that he overreacted and go back to his Canon 80d. By far the best focusing camera he has used...and cleanest setup. 
Im not surprised.

He went on a video upload kick and hyped up his 'holiday movie' and Max's movie. Now that they are both out; he went dark.

Everything is uploaded for a reason. He was doing somewhat regular content for a while so that people would watch his major uploads. 
Naw you're right. Hop on the circlejerk of Apple's impending doom from employee disgruntlement from this missing yearly gifts.

I know when i get a job I fully expect gifts each year on top of my salary/bonus/PTO/insurance. 
Bingo.
> Welcome to corporate greed

Ah yes. Corporate greed for not giving a gift. Or you know...the fact that they offer competitive wages and healthcare, but don't let that get in the way of the circlejerk for not giving employees a tshirt. 
So far 37:42 split. Seems about right.
What seats were you getting for $35? 
Iv gone every year (minus last year, but i still bought a ticket in August and sold it when we lost) and i have never seen a ticket (besides standing room) for $35. 

Tickets, as i can remember, have gone up $15 since the beginning of construction last year, then another $10 this year; which made a normal sideline ticket cost roughly $120 a seat with fees/tax. 
Sell? Do they even own it? I thought it was on lease? 
The price increase in tickets for the past 2 years since construction is hardly making up for the entire south enzone's sales being at the ~$80 price point they were at before construction. They are no doubt making less in ticket sales. 
Yeah its insane that the NCAA wouldn't have something in the contract for bidding for the venue that would allow for the removal of a large section of seats for construction. The fact that the FCS Championship game is being held somewhere that essentially has 16,000 seats is stupid. 
A fellow Theta Chi.

Hello from a former Phi chapter.
Honestly...it is.
Just wait a little longer. I know it sucks doing that but just hold tight. If anything, even if you don't have tickets come January 3rd, go down to Frisco anyways. You **will** get into the game. Trust me.
I could see it being an a successful wedding venue tbh
Oh ok, I didnt catch on. Thanks
How did this go from a guy telling her to not wear a bra...to rape?

I mean almost everyone had committed some form of sexual harassment. In some way or form; everyone. To lump someone saying "damn you look hot" in with someone that rapes another person is just stupid. 
Yeah it seems crazy to go and bank on this but its true every year. Almost every year there is a shortage of tickets before the game (this year is much worse though) but the market right now is just inflated by people wanted to make as much profit as they can. Come closer to the game the prices will dip.


With that being said, remember, the NCAA increased the ticket prices again this year so most tickets were around $120 after fees/tax. So a $200 ticket isn't **that** crazy. 
> on your property.

I would be curious to see if this is actually the case. I know with a lot of software and what not that you think you 'own' you actually dont...
> Their nicer ones are good and decent management.

Where is a 'nicer' Goldmark building exactly...
Agreed. Its a very nice building. I just wish something fun and successful would go in there. Location has to be hurting it. 
/BUMMERTHREAD
As much as it is popular to hate on and be a ___ snob...you're 100% right.

Their products are very sub-par for the price. 
Thanks for posting this. This is exactly why I was holding off. Now if you could just add it as a form of payment online like your credit/debit card through the Marcus app; that would be amazing.


To me, this seems like the perfect thing for someone that is free in the morning/early afternoon and likes movies. Showing up a theater at 9 or 10 am and going to a movie using this would be a piece of cake. The in-person ticket buying is a deal-breaker for me. 
This, I am actually bummed about. 
Screen protectors on watches...ugh.
with the Movie Pass? 

Tuesdays and Thursdays are $5 (however Thursday is for students but...you look like a student to me) for everyone.
It is legit so far. They have over a million subscribers already. 
I'm sure it has to do with your route or even the secured mailboxes (maybe they are broken).

Instead of this, i would suggest contact your post office to find out why.
I dont see how it couldnt. You know, for your troubles. 
Where are you seeing this?
I am curious about this as well. I know, according to the website etc, it should work without a hitch. I think what is most curious to me is that you have to buy the tickets at the theater. At least that's what I gather from the website?


Either way, I don't see how they make money from this so If you're able to order tickets/seats through the app I need to sign up asap. 
> at church

Makes sense.
eh, Sonic gets a fairly large amount of business each day. 
Ha! Jokes on you. I have no friends to tell about!
Not sure why you're being downvoted. That part was cringe AF.
Or they could tag JMU with a penalty every time they do it.
I agree, they wont be able to stop people from it; however you have to also look at it as they are aware of this 'issue' and might have the refs penalize for it. 
lol at this one

Tellin ya. Star Wars + ESPN = TV Time.

No Frisco for Briscoe.

Yeah it has Tabasco mixed into the sauce 
hold my beer.

Old Chicago is the most underrated pizza in town. People brush it off as just another chain restaurant and tout Rhombus Guys, Blackbird (which is good), etc as being 'the best in Fargo'. However, Old Chicago pizza is incredibly good. 

The Double Deckeroni pizza is the best pizza in town. Hands down. 
If you try and like Rhombus Guys, then go to Maddios going forward. Their pizzas are cheaper, taste exactly the same, and are *WAY* faster. 
I've seen and heard good things about Hot Dog.

Which given its location downtown, makes me really surprised they are still open and at that location. 
> to pay

Who do we set up payments to unlock this feature? AT&T, Verizon, Comcast...who?
Oh yes. This was talked about on Bisonville. If you want to get on ESPN tomorrow, have a PC Star Wars sign. Its like a 100% guarantee. 
No it would be like if Nature Valley sold you a granola bar and then you opened the package and its just granola. 
> 95% off at Hollister

Wait what? Where? Link me.
I thought Walt Disney was dead?
Seems a little unfair for the Huskers to have to play both SDSU and UND at the same time. 
I knew it would when I posted it. JMU fans can take it as a 'been there done that' type of comment if they'd like but im being serious.

Not just last year; for the past what, three years? ESPN has been shoving Star Wars memes and references down our throats about NDSU. So for another team to just start up with it makes me kinda scratch my head. 

Which I always thought it was stupid that Bison fans embraced them so hard. Do they not know what happened to the Death Star?
Its well made...however the whole 'Star Wars' thing is pretty run out with NDSU. I would be willing to bet money they make a Star Wars/NDSU related reference at least twice on ESPN for our game Friday. They have been talking about our 'Empire' on ESPN for the past three years.

Guess it's easy marketing with Star Wars coming out tomorrow and everything. 
YOU'RE NOT WRONG
> Harry’s solo stuff is pretty good if you like some slow paced rock.

Eh.

His 'inspiration' is the Beatles. His album and songs are basically just trying to steal their style and sound. 
I don't think this is one of those things where it is one or the other. It can be both. You can both have an exposed team along with giving credit to the opponent.

That and it's not like this is the first time all year. Richmond came into their house and lost in the last minute of the game as well. 

It really comes down to which teams show up on Saturday, but lets not beat around the bush; SDSU is a far better team offensively and defensively than Weber State was. 
/u/Trojann2 nailed it in his post below. Id be willing to bet this is a great move he is making to make sure JMU gets a nice payout when he moves to another coaching opportunity. Taking a play out of Coach Bohl's playbook on this. Smart move
Bingo.

This is exactly what this is.
>but that defense is incredible 

If they are going to get past SDSU, they are going to have to step up for sure. I don't think anyone would disagree that Weber State is some high-powered offense, and they put up 28 on the road. SDSU, I would argue, is twice the offensive force as Weber State was. 

>SHSU winning this would be the upset of the decade quite possibly. 

I agree on this 100%

You're forgetting the biggest thing stopping us from moving up; we would need a new stadium. Land $ Building $$$$$$$


Oh damn. I know our student tickets for playoffs are $5.
Weren't the tickets free for students last game? 
I know a bunch of die hard SDSU fans are going. 

There is a big group of them taking a few flights.
It will be. No doubt.

> Khalid

IMO he was what made JMU so good last year. That kid was a beast.


That was probably the worst play call in the playoffs so far. Why?

Not sure how they didn't call that.
With a day filled with blowouts, this game is great to watch.

Im really rooting for Kennesaw State. They are a great team and super fun to watch.

Friday night tailgating is what I live for. Seriously the best tailgating.

They will. The CEO of Marcus Theater has tweeted about it. They have the rights, just not as many as they would like to get to the lower theater markets.
No doubt. There was tickets being sold on facebook/bisonville/etc all week. But that doesn't negate the fact that the school sold out. 
in 2018 our favorite celebrities will be born.
I remember when I was a kid if you got enough of them you could build a Fintstones car from it.

The Feels Like in Brookings is 15 degrees. Props to the fans out there right now. I know it may not be a full stadium, but from the ESPN feed im watch sounds loud.

Working fine via ESPN app on Apple TV.
This is the first time in a long time where SDSU is on the other side of NDSU for the bracket. Fingers crossed for a Dakota Bowl. 
That’s very true
How many scholarships do they have 
These Terriers are definitely not neutered. Takes some balls going for it on 4th as much as they do. 
Someone in the tailgating group of mine needed two more tickets and gobison.com was marked as unavailable. 
It’s ok lol
It’s one of those “sold out” games. All the seats were sold, just not used. 
Hold onto the damn ball. 
Easton is having one of those games where he is 
making good calls on throws. Next week (if)...we’ll see
I’ll take it over the Wildcat for sure.

15 degree tailgating didn’t stop anyone. 
I saw yesterday another player was suspended for this game?
Whatever man, you prove my point exactly. 

Don’t let me stop the circlejerk. 
52 years of coaching is a hell of a career 
Crazy the different from 290 to 240 is 
And yet I’m not surprised in the least. 

2017 everyone. 
I represent myself. Just as the asshats shouting DUUKES that have never posted topics in this sub before 12 months ago represent themselves and not JMU as a whole. The attitude in this forum is toxic. No one knows anyone and when it comes to actually meeting or having an actual conversation about topics at hand; it’s shit. Which is to be completely expected as the circle jerk of reddit is no exception here. You can think I’m a piece of shit all you want, you and I see people acting like jackasses in this site on a daily occurrence. If I speak my mind and someone takes it as some offense that’s on them. It’s real easy to just run online and say someone’s salty “because”. To me, you’re a piece of shit. I have seen poor choice of words from you as well so get off your high horse. You can think whatever you want of me because I know at the end of the day you’re going to sit behind your keyboard and judge instead of going to the tailgate lot or team maker event. 

Ultimately what this place comes down to is shit talking, when not under bison flair, is playful and banter; but under it is cocky and “poor quality”. And you know it.

TL;DR; fuck you too and I really don’t care what you think. 
They didn’t show the jury this?
So this is literally what I said in the game thread and get “salt” for saying; but now it’s fine to say? Good lord the circlejerk is strong. 
Salt because you accuse me of being salty? Your logic is air tight. Sure got me. 
Ah, so you’re just talking out your ass. Got it
Hate you too

<3
Lol how am I salty again? 
Salt? What lol Who gives a shit? You beat unseeded Weber State, pull out the red carpet. But lemme guess, this is salt lol
It’s almost as I do other things. Nuts. 
Because tickets are being listed as we speak...go look for yourself.
Why would I sell mine? lol
Im no the one selling my tickets...might wanna tell that the JMU fans listing them...
Im not the one listing my tickets.....
And the Frisco tickets slowly trickle for sale on Flash Seats...
Prepare yourself for the hate.
The key to Frisco tailgating is to fly, but pay one of your friends to drive. All your shit is there, but you get the convince of flying. Noice. 

If its your first time going to Frisco, rent a car and drive with some friends. That's the most fun. 
Game is far from over. JMU starting to gain back their momentum. 

You got it, fam.

In all seriousness though, book a flight now. Add the insurance, worse case you're out ~$12?
Not the cameraman's fault. Most likely these are the tripod mounted ESPN cameras they bring with them. They placed them on a bleacher and active fans will do that with a zoom.

This.
Agreed. Those are the assholes that stick in peoples' heads about fan bases. Not what JMU or any team needs; some idiots ruining it for everyone. 
Yeah and it looks like it wasn't just some one dumbass. Came from a few. I know we've been screwed over in the playoff (the 'phantom whistle'). They should definitely have zero tolerance for this during the playoffs especially.

Agreed. Look forward to em each week.
God damn Weber State defense is no joke huh?

It was a tackle during a kick. As I recall, it wasn't a 'holding' call, by traditional sense. That would be like a penalty being called for hitting the QB after the ball is thrown. (not exactly, but you get the point) Either way, the call was the call, nothing anyone can do about it now.
>ARTICLE 3. a. Under postscrimmage kick enforcement rules, fouls by Team B that satisfy the conditions in paragraph b (below) are treated as if Team B had been in possession at the time the foul was committed, even though by Rule 2-4-1-b-3 team possession had not changed.
b. Postscrimmage kick enforcement applies only to fouls by Team B during a scrimmage kick and only under the following conditions:
1. The kick is not during a try, a successful field goal, or in an extra
period. (A.R. 10-2-3-IV)
2. The ball crosses the neutral zone.
3. The foul occurs before the end of the kick (A.R. 10-2-3-I, II, and V).
4. Team B will next put the ball in play.
If these conditions are all met, the penalty is enforced according to the Three-And-One Principle. Team B is taken as the team in possession with the postscrimmage kick spot as the basic spot (Rule 10-2-2-c). See Rule 2-25-11 for the postscrimmage kick spot. (A.R. 10-2-3-I-VII)

The ball never passed the neutral zone so Team B (Weber State) is *not* taken as team in possession. (during the 'hold')
Got em'
I am surprised with Weber State, I know I shouldn't be, but I guess I just have them stuck in the 2014 season in my mind for some reason. 
Could have fooled us.
How so? Genuinely curious as I attempting to look for the rule on change of possession mid-play and seems to favor the fact at the time of the hit, Weber State was on defense. 

Do you have a link to why it is the correct call? 
That’s..the...point. At the point of the hit, he wasn’t a defender. 
Weber State blocked the field goal and ran it back for 6. Called it back for one Un-timed down for Weber Stares ball because they tackled the kicker when they fully hadn’t recovered ten ball yet. BS call for sure. 
Shhh you gotta let them relive their super bowl for years to come. 
Yeah idk. When Weber St got him they were technically on defense. I can see why their coach is pissed. They got screwed. Should be 14-10. 
If my predictions are correct and playing like they are tonight; SDSU is going to stomp JMU.

Cant do that. They literally can not win.

If they do very minimal design changes and focus on hardware and software they will get bombarded with the criticism that it 'hasn't been innovated'. This already happens. Look at the iPhone 7 or 8. Video after video, review after review of how its 'just an iPhone 6, with updated hardware. Apple needs to reinvent and redesign the iphone for (current year)'s standards."

Solid reply. Yeah it seems like Montana has fallen off the wagon of what it was and should be. Good to see them trying what they can to get back into it.
Yeah, i guess what else could you ask for tbh
Yeah it seems as if there would be too much bad blood and resentment to be efficient. 
No they weren't. FCS, sure. College football? Get fucking real.

But sure, lump all the fans together. I do the same with JMU fans and their 1.5 season dynasty. 
Example, from 2012 through 2014 when NDSU was on a 33 game winning streak, they were not 'the hottest team in college football, let along FCS'. That's my rationalization. 

If they mean hottest meaning just winning streak, sure. Hottest in terms of sensationalism, hype, thrill? No. 

Again, what i find funny about this overall statement, is the hypocrisy with most FCS fan base that as long as its not an NDSU fan saying this about the Bison, its fine and justifiable.

Don't take this as some sore of hate or personal attack on you or any JMU team directly (although it most certainly will be). Im just posting my thoughts on how asinine it sounds saying this about them and all of college football.

Key word

Edit: I *know* this is going to trigger you but...

how is it a reality and undeniable that JMU is **the** hottest non-power conference team in the college football, let alone the FCS? Just fuck every other team right? 

I **100 fucking %** guarantee you that if any sort of ISUr/NDSU/JSU fan said this last year or in the past 4 years, you and others would be calling bullshit and going on and on about X's team's cocky fans. I guess what I'm saying is I am failing to see how having one, potentially two winning seasons now makes them the hottest college football team (not just in FCS). Is JMU a great team? Absolutely. No one is saying they are not, but I just find the hypocrisy of outlandish claims such as that as quite funny given all the butthurt over the past 4 years. 
It literally says that the voting is once a day for X amount of weeks...

You think 14,000 individual people voted? lol no. Those are *votes* not people.

Perfect. Thank you. Is that for the 1.8 Soylent? I just got my first box of bags yesterday. So im new to it all.
I agree. I wish all the luck and hope all the MVFC teams pull a win. Somehow we need both UNI and SDSU to win. Somehow.

That is a fantastic idea. Didnt even think of that.
Im not saying you're wrong, but at the same time just some guy on the internet saying 'trust me, i have my sources' doesnt exatly mean shit.

What 'drugs' is a **huge** factor here, at least for me. If this is weed, then whatever. Should they be kicked off the team? Sure, it's still an illegal drug and goes against the contract they sign when joining the team. However, I wont think poorly of these kids. 

Now hard drugs or HGH? Yeah...that's different. 
Uh well...that example doesn't really work. That 'small group' is more than 6,000 voting members from the 17 branches of the Academy of Motion Pictures and Sciences are sent a nominations ballot for the Oscars.

You know...the people who dedicated their lives to film. Not just some 24 year old that thinks Deadpool should win an Oscar.
I think what they are talking about is the term 'best'.

Why is it the best? Because enough random people (around 500) took the time to vote? There is no metric of measurement other than that.
Its all user voted...However it is one vote a day per IP. A lot of these places have their employees vote everyday. Example: Hatch.

I agree 100%. You'd be crazy to say no. That and what gamer would turn down the chance to be in *any* game?


While I agree with you on the whole potentially scaring away future guests; in doing so that makes the whole point of the podcast and having these guests.

I watched the JP podcast to see a *real* and unedited response to why he is such a douchebag; not some fluff and blindly agreeing to make it look like everything is 'all good'. If that's what the point of the podcast is, then I just wont watch anymore.

It's really not though. Don't believe me? Go on Youtube and look as assistant comparisons. Siri is right up there with Alexa/Google/etc. 


We went to that holiday shopping event at the mall Sunday night and Junkyard had a booth there giving samples and selling beer. The dude working that both might be the most overly intense/annoying dudes i have ever witnessed in my life. 
Also If you flipped NDSU and JMU while leaving the rest of the bracket untouched. NDSU’s projected chance of winning the title would decrease 17% to 43.6%. While JMU’s would only increase 33% to 34.7%. 


So take that as you may...
> No one else really has.

Richmond put up 13.
You're preaching to the choir her with NDSU fans. We have been going through this for 5 years now.

For the past 6 years NDSU has been placed on the 'wrong' side of the bracket and has had to go through a gauntlet of MVFC teams etc. This is the first year that I can remember, where we have 'lucked out'. But you're also forgetting this is the playoffs; not a single team on either bracket is a cupcake team or an easy win.


The only difference between this year and the past few is you're on that side this time and not us. Guess sometimes it doesn't pay to be seeded #1.
Well i hope you guys make it down. A MVFC championship game would be dope.
If JMU doesn't make it to Frisco, it will be by SDSU's hand. Calling it now.
That's usually how those games work
Very true, I guess looking at stats it should be a no-brained for Furman. But who knows.

> Please tell me the NCAA doesn't also make this about money.

Literally everything they do is about money. The FCS is a **HUGE** loss of money for the NCAA. 

Why else would we have the Championship game played at 11 am.

Yeah they did
And Northern Arizona had quality wins?

I'm not trying to take away from North Arizona's season but, both 7-4, with what I would say the harder schedule going to Eastern Washington.
Yeah...Eastern Washington got screwed. Just a thought.

It is actually legal to fly there.

This is interesting. When I got my drone like 3 years ago I messaged and talked to the Fargo Park Director and was told that while there is no ordinance on drone use in their parks; they could also deem make the determination that they are not allowed in the parks. I have been respecting what I was told 3 years ago and don't fly my drone in the parks...well, I fly over the parks, but I don't take off or land from the parks. They can't control the air above it, only the ground.
That will be a great game. 
I don't think its super late in the market at all. Their competitor for this is *not* the Echo or Google Home; its Sonos.

> THAT'S OKAY, MOST OF WHAT YOU SAY IS ALREADY TRASH

CASE IN POINT; EASTERN WASHINGTON

BULLSHIT. PROVE IT.
Right, as it shouldn't Just a reality we all have to face. The FCS is a money pit for the NCAA so they won't make it anything other than regionally played playoff games. 
I think they are pretty solid, but I do think the hipster Fargo crowd hype the fuck out of Junkyard. But whatever.
My thoughts exactly. I remember seeing comparisons of the screens and the iPhone X was brighter and more true to life colors.

I really take anything from these groups of Youtubers with a grain of salt. Him, Jonathan & gang are buddies with Casey Niestat now...who is on the Samsung pay train. They have done too many videos together where I just can't take his opinion as anything other than bias.

You work there, but yet still fail to see that they dont up-price their shoes $50 'compared to other stores'? Do you work for the cleaning crew there or?
Sure seems like it. We got a huge 5lb bag of frozen green beans at Costco for like $5 something. Same with broccoli. When we were going to the local grocery store and buying fresh, the heads of broccoli seemed like a huge waste of time and rip off. 
Too much...
Sara Deitchy?! No shit...did she finally go full on copy casey and move in the same building? That's funny as hell. What a freaking joke.
It doesn't matter. But, as I said, its very obvious with the knockoff looking emojis
I am not trying to drag this out or call you out, so dont take it as that. BUT...

$50+ compared to other stores? What shoes are you talking about exactly? I have yet to see a athletic shoe over +/- ~$15 from anywhere else. Infact, that same Ultraboosts are $10 cheaper at Scheels than Journeys. 
Its hideously obvious that was posted on Android
This is so weird. wtf is wrong with that dude? It sounded like all that guy did was keep the players on the sideline?
This happens nearly yearly with MVFC.
So your original comment of "$$$"; what are you referring to? What shoe or boot were you saying is '$$$' at Scheels compared to elsewhere? I mean, you surely have an example and aren't just blinding thinking that its more expensive 'just because' right?
Scheels is the same price as nearly everywhere else when it comes to shoes. If you think $100-150 is expensive for quality leather boots/shoes; then you shouldn't be buying leather boots/shoes. 
Depending on what you are looking for. Sneakers etc, I would say Jounreys in the mall. They seem to have the newest and current versions of shoes from Vans to NMD's etc.

For casual/non-sneaker; DSW is alright. Their mens section is kinda stale. I would almost say Scheels is best for that category.

But in terms of dress/business casual - DSW all the way. 


Also, Trade Homes in the mall can be great if they have what you want. Their staff works on commission, but I have found time and time again their store is different than other commission based stores in that they actually help you; and more often than not will give you socks for free or will give you % off. 
> They get a lot of campaign money from the coal industry.

Which doesnt make sense really. Their industry is dying. How do they have all this money to throw around to ensure their dying industry continues to make less and less money?
I'm sure this will be lost in the comments but, I saw on Twitter (which they have since deleted) that Dollar Shave Club has been running ads on Hannity and promoting via social media. Their twitter is a mess right now with people calling them out.

Can confirm.

He was just making up things to hate on essentially. 

I know what you mean. No matter what, UNI always gives us problems. 
Would love to hear a JMU fans thoughts on this game. I couldn’t watch, just watching via stats at the NDSU game but gotta thing, barely winning at home in the last  min against an unranked team would make me nervous going into playoffs. So, just a bad game or?
"LMAO" find me **one** credible source or study showing that TouchID is more secure than FaceID. 

The fact that /u/PM_ME_YO_GAMS_GIRL thinks he is smarter than any other engineer is laughable. 
Because its more secure...

This has been stated hundreds of times. If you're that upset that TouchID isnt on the X, then dont but it. Simple.
yes. this is information in Apple official docs.
Is that how you are now that you're an adult? When you interact with someone difficult at work you have two options 1. beat the shit out of them 2. Cry and whine to them?

You sound like a winner.
> I would have beat the shit out of that person.

Because that seems like the appropriate action to take...
It depends...who is paying for it? If you are *not* paying for it; go to Quality Autobody.
I bought a pixma pro-100 a few years ago with the intention of making prints for clients, but aside from prints with wedding packages; i let them take of it on their own. I would suggest making a Pixieset account. That way you can do the shoot, upload it and email it to your client. Then, set up the store feature and your client/their relatives can just order prints right off the site. Best part is they dont take a cut and you can set your prices along with the printing studio does all the work of creating them and mailing. 
I agree with this. That was quick and painless, having to double tap the side button and have it scan is a tad annoying. 
Well shit...do you have a source for this? 
At first, like 2014, this was a funny joke and made sense. But I mean, all jokes aside, have you *actually* used Siri? It very rarely doesnt do what you tell it to do (within reason) or fuck up understanding you (within reason).

I understand it is an on-going reddit joke to hate on Siri, but look up comparisons between Alexa, Google, Siri, etc. and they are all exactly the same...
That and if they gave you a usb-c to lightning cable in the box, people would bitch that they didn't get a usb-a to lighting cable. You can't make people happy. 
Just go return them and re-buy them.
This really isn't a thing anymore.

Senior photos from around 2006 to now are vastly different. Senior photos are more viewed, if we are being 100% honest here, as a thing for Social Media more so than wallet sizes to hand out to people. I don't think people actually even do that anymore. 

If you look around or view senior pictures of seniors these days, they are essentially portrait sessions with some artistic shots in there that they can use on Instagram later. They days of the super tacky staged studio shot for a senior photo is over. Its been over for years. 
I've always loved cinemagraphs
> The point is that just being a different product alone isn't enough to justify charging over 3 times as much as other, **very similar ones**. 

No. You are missing the point.

Where did I say a single Ikea pad was worthless? **You're not getting the point. The point is there *is no other product on the market that can charge multiple devices via one single pad* for Christ sakes. Open you're fucking eye.**

You're missing the point of the AirPower. Its *one* unit that supports multiple devices. If you're looking for single charging pads that you can disperse around ayour house, you're not in the market for a multiple device pad. Apple knows this and that is why they advertise the belkin and morphie pads they do. 

All im saying is, please find me one unit that supports multiple devices (not the three charging locations like the Ikea etc pads) that is less than $150 and one cord. 

You're comparing apples to oranges. 
I get what you're saying, however i dont think its really *that* overprices at all. People keep linking to other products similar to the AirPad but in reality, how much would it cost to 'make' this same product? I bought a fast charge Samsung Qi pad on Friday for my iPhone X and it was $50. that is for one device. $50 x 3 is already at $150. I could see $200 being right on the money in terms of cost for design/product. 
I would love to hear about Mi Familia Taco Company.

They took over the storefront that Taco Shop over off 45th was in. Looks dope so far.
Trash.
That and they are super speedy. The only complaint i have with Mangos is the service is hit or miss. Its never *terrible* but there has been a few times where the waiter is non-existent or just really short and not personable. But who cares really. 
I mean its your money. Buy what you want. 

All I am saying is this is *new* features here. No one is forcing anyone to buy an AirPad, but at the same time...why are people complaining about the price? This is Apple. The product, service, and craftsmanship of this going to be on par with every other apple product and be top notch. Who buys an Apple product expecting it to be the cheapest price? 

EDIT: Im not trying to lash out on you directly, just people in general btw. 
I think their food is trash, and so does most of /r/Fargo. However, in real life, a vast majority of my friends love that place. I mean, its not like they just sprung up out of no where. Their food truck was extremely popular before their storefront was opened. 
I agree that the title of this thread is shit.

However, these types of deals do not just happen. I would be willing to bet money on it that Kilbourne had been communicating with the owner of Sweeto and talking about the cost of leasing the space during and after their renovations. To act as if their rent wasn't going to skyrocket is just stupid...get real. Of course that is the reason they are leaving their storefront. 
Ah yes. It's finally that time of the year where everyone bitches about everyone's' driving while thinking they are the greatest driver in the world. My favorite time of the year. 
That's not the same. The mat you linked to is essentially 3 individual pads in one housing. The AirPad as I recall, will be 'one' unit. So you can place your devices in any location. 

Its different overall. Just saying. 
To be fair, there is not a Qi charging mat out there that allows for multiple devices to charge at once. Im talking ONE mat, not those 2 or 3 charging pads at Ikea. This is suppose to not matter were you place it. As i recall, this it the only one like this. 
Yeah a lot of stores are even taking away the self-checkout kiosks. I think the Ikea in Minneapolis turned them off as they saw a lot of theft. 
Maybe they are continuing with market tests. Or they went ahead with it. What do i know.
Sam's Club is Walmart (essentially) However its a different market and customer base (usually higher income, upper middle class).

Walmart was actually testing that scan-and-go feature on their own app in some test markets a few years ago. They found that it hurt sales as customers are very aware of what their total is. They scrapped it for Walmart and will never use that. Sam's Club however...

Edit: What do i know, they probably brought it back and use it now.
How is this not the top comment. I don't understand why people are outraged. They have a ton of money, of course they have tax experts that are going to look and find everything they can to save money. If they are not breaking a law or regulation than they are no different than any other company trying to use tax laws to their advantage, the only difference is they are dealing in billions instead of thousands. 

Lol k
If only they were looking into the incentives that Killbourne Group has received

Duracell Powermat

I have had a Qi power pad that came with two external battery banks. Both charge on the pad at the same time. Iv had it for about 3 years.
Was this at MSP?
Please report back.
lol idk what you're trying to argue. That Im wrong? Oh ok. Then the whole point of this subthead in your post is that its illegal to not allow it to call 911. Well, since im wrong and you're right, you best get to contacting someone about their illegal activity.



The point is. It only applies to cellular phones. Your Apple Watch, as much as this is going to trigger you, **is not** a cellular phone. 
No? I bought a phone. Not addition support software. 

This is like bitching that you have to pay your power bill to charge your phone.
Bingo. The Vsauce guy is getting really..well..bad.
>Looking back at phones, the defining feature was whether it could make phone calls. 

Because that's what we're talking about right? Because someone said cellular modems, right? Or was it in reply to the conversation? hmm

[What cloud storage does Samsung provide?](https://www.samsung.com/us/explore/samsung-cloud/)



No. It's not a phone that sits on your wrist. It is a smart watch that has the capabilities to make voice calls. 

Apple has said time and time again that the Apple Watch does not and never will replace a phone. 
Fair enough, just as Apple deserves the right to offer us literally 0 GB of storage for free.
Yeah last two games have not been his best. However, all season (minus these past two) he's been killer so. Who knows what's going on with him. 
A cell phone vs. a smart watch for one. Others being smart devices, networking gear, hot spots. Basically anything with cellular capabilities but not a 'phone.'

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_devices_with_LTE


This is true for phones. Not LTE devices. 
I agree. I don't get why a main 'negative' reaction from the 8 is that is has the same shape and overall design as the 6/7 phones. Who cares? Are people honestly expecting Apple to come up with a completely new phone design every single year?
That's very interesting. I know they can't hit every single feature in keynotes; but this seems like something that should have been talked about. Did I miss something? 
# **Not those studded bracelets tho!!**
Thats not how that argument should go. Jesus people. You act as if you're entitled to all the cloud storage you want. Do you have any idea how expensive it is to run cloud storage? I don't know what I expected posting about how less than $1 a month for 50 GB of storage is not expensive at all on /r/Apple...
20s
Oh no dont take it as me diving into what you said directly; just with the overall situation. A lot of people have been going on and on about how Apple shouldn't have fired him yada yada
NO. 

Its fucking $.99 for 50 GB. You're talking about 4k video, $1000 iphones and yet $0.99 a month is too much?
I think this is the most difficuly week of the season (well for me anyways). 

Seems to be a lot of NDSU over SDSU picks but I dunno. Much like UNI; SDSU always gives us a run for our money. Won't be an easy game at all. 
That's horrible. But at the same time, good for the victims to come forward to say something instead of letting privileged players get away acting like they can do whatever they want. 
It wasn't the first peek though. It was like 15 seconds of her swiping down the control center...after videos from the announcement were posted. This gave us zero new look or inside information. It was just a stupid video of her swiping in a non-controlled environment. Apple has a zero tolerance policy on unauthorized media content so; the dude knew the risks when he handed over his phone to hid daughter with a vlogging camera.

PS. 'young girl' isnt she like in her late 20s? (edit: a word)
Why stop there? Why not just wait until 2023?
Naw. Its more-so his fault. You *should* know that working on the design team for Apple on their hottest new phone **before** its released; you probably shouldn't allow your kid to record playing with it in the lunch room. 


This has got to be Rule #1 told to you when you start at Apple. You'd have to be pretty stupid to think it wasn't a big deal.
