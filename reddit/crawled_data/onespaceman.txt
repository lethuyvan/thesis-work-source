At the very least, Blizzard should make Barnes actually take the card out of the deck and make it a 1/1 instead of pulling a copy. That way when I polymorph the 1/1 ysera, it's gone for good.

It's insane to me that anyone can think that 30fps is fine. 60fps is the bare minimum of what I would call acceptable and that's for single player games. Standards are much higher for a game that wants to be competitive.

That explains why Jamie likes men who eat a lot. She's just anticipating the new male.
It started with one little ship. Toast + Poki. Toki. It felt nice. Really nice. I didn't think there was any harm. They looked so cute together.

Then i saw the potential in Tily. Now there were 2 ships, but it wasn't a big deal. 2 ships is manageable.

Enter Joast. Joast was big. Joast was explosive. I've never had such a high. It was so cute, I just couldn't stop. But they kept teasing. They told me to resist, and resist I did, for a little bit. But it was too late.

I needed ships. I needed more. I began to ship right and left. Scarra + Toast. Deathblok + Clannad_Fuko. Temmie + Chris. I couldn't stop. All I cared about in life was shipping. I promised myself I would ship one more time and that I would quit for good after.

But I didn't. I couldn't.
That shouldn't be a problem. Sony can always just permanently keep the old names hidden internally, so games can keep verifying against it. Then just duplicate the old names to a new, changeable field and display the new field instead. It's not a hard problem to fix, so they either don't care or don't want  people to change their names.
Make it deal 5 damage to friendly minion, heal 10. That way it's still a great activator for lackey, but to kill a cube they need to use a fully charged spellstone or dark pact + mortal coil.

It could be because people play qp and comp differently, like playing heroes they aren't as good at, or just don't try as hard, or mess around, which lowers their qp mmr.
Because the original Arma battle Royale mods had third person. Other battle Royale games sort of went along with it.

This would require changing healers to be more like soldier. Dps who just happen to also heal, otherwise no one will play healers anymore, because why would you if you have basically no impact on the game.
A niche case, but it could be useful if you are still holding the other team at that section, have visor, and want to flank ult them. Gives the other team much fewer options of where to run.
Have it work like a usb 2FA key which just emulates a keyboard that prints out the key when a button is pressed. Though this would probably need dedicated copy/paste buttons on the mouse.

Soldier


**Bronze**  
Stay alive most of the time.  
Keep your distance from the enemy and throw damage toward them.  
Use rockets for general damage or to kill flankers

**Silver**  
Start working on focusing down individual enemies.  
Learn to take better positions on high ground.

**Gold**  
Really start working on aiming, controlling spread with bursts.  
Know the good positions to take at each stage of the map.

**Plat**  
More aim. Really work on getting headshots.  
Expect the other team to contest your high ground. Be able to either defend that ground or to escape to safety if unable  
Use rocket more effectively, to secure kills, rather than just throwing out damage.

**Diamond**  
Get lots of headshots.  
Able to anticipate flankers and divers, and so be able to duel, or reposition yourself effectively and preemptively.
Try Battlerite. It's inspired by Mobas like League or DotA, but cuts out all the creeps and objectives and is just teamfights.
I feel like giving headshots on such an inaccurate attack is weird, like if scatter arrow could headshot. It rewards RNG bullshit, rather than aim.
What's that Mei? Kill them all? Good idea!
There's no need to do this anymore. Updates now let you setup a custom game with 0 cooldown on sleepdart

I love all the Amanita Design games. They are so charming, and the music is top notch. Their latest game, Samorost 3 is the best one yet, with gorgeous visuals and such a good soundtrack.

A cool fact: Floex who did the music for Samorost 3 is named Tomas Dvorak, same as the guy who did the music for the older games.

I personally love the round robin into playoffs format. I do prefer teams not to be split up into groups, but recognize that if there are many teams participating, it can be necessary.

I do wish tournaments would go for double elimination more. Single elimination doesn't have that potential for a comeback, as well as requiring a mostly pointless third place match.

There is the problem of how to give the undefeated team in double elimination finals a winner's advantage, though. The most fair would require the lower bracket team to beat them in two matches, so they also have to be double eliminated. The problem is that the match lasts way too long, especially since overwatch finals are usually BO5. Alienware Monthly gave the upper bracket finalist an extra point at the start of the match, which I feel is somewhat fair, but am not entirely happy with. I don't have a good answer for how to best fix this problem.
Hello
If you go to a fast food place you're not going to just stand there and hope they eventually make you a sandwich.  You tell them you want this bread, and no, you don't want lettuce on it, etc. Talking in game doesn't have to a be a conversation, just a basic interaction that helps everyone do what they need to do. 
Because it allows the second team to use plays that would otherwise be a losing strategy to win. Suppose the first team fully held the first point using a standard defense on Hanamura by holding at the choke and the attacking team got no or a little percentage points.

The second team does not have the option to hold the same type of defense now. They have to hold on the point more and give up more of the choke, because the attacking team can otherwise send in a tracer, sombra, genji etc. to just touch the point for a second to win.

Sure the second team could have sent in mobile characters to try to backcap when they were attacking to try to build up percentage points, but that is a gamble because a coordinated attack will more likely secure the whole point. Now the first team has an option to just cheese the win, which forces the second exam to have a less defensive position.
Because after killing your target, you have to reload when you could be doing damage to the next target.

As much schadenfreude that would provide, I don't like the idea isolating toxic people together. If all they experience is toxicity from other teammates, their perspective would be that everyone playing this game is toxic. People can change, especially as they grow up, so it's better not to give people any reason to think a shitty attitude is normal or expected in online interactions.

I probably would just play board games or something. I'm too attached to KB+M and mostly play FPS and strategy, so consoles are a no go.
I use the Roccat XTC and it's been working for about 2 years now. I configured it on Windows when I first got it and haven't touched the settings since, though, so if you're constantly tweaking the settings it might be harder.
I wasn't contesting that point. The damage nerfs go far enough to fix her being a 1v1 monster. No reason to also halve her only self heal.
I agree with the damage nerfs, but I think the grenade impact heal change is too much, especially since that is Ana's only source of self healing.

MGEMike plays DPS for Faze Clan (goes by Mikey now) so it's possible we might see that.
I don't agree. I think as long as he can 1-shot 250HP heroes and almost 1-shot tanks he will be broken, because he punishes players who are playing their role correctly (On the front line, damaging enemy tanks and blocking path to their supports and long range dps). I think Roadhog should have to be careful who he hooks, instead of being guaranteed a kill whoever he hooks.
No roadhog turns otherwise good positions into bad positions because he can pull you from that good position into a bad position which is into the barrel of his scrap gun
A tip for audiobooks. Use an app that allows you to speed up the audio. I usually listen at 1.5x speed which cuts out a quarter of its length, and is usually not any harder to follow.
You don't. Notice how OP doesn't get any ult charge for their deaths. Lucio's boop gives kill credit because it also does 25 damage.
Borderlands 2 soundtrack is a similar style, though with its own flavor. I like the Captain Scarlett's DLC soundtrack the most, but the base game and other DLC tracks are also good.
Played with a legitimately pro mercy last week who redefined what that character can do in my eyes. Dude wasn't just healing, he was a monster with those pistol shots, and he was able to outheal the spam from the enemy junkrat while also damage boosting our DPS to take out the enemy pharah. And when he used it ult, it was solely to Rez the whole team at once, and getting us to just straight up wipe the whole team without us having to respawn and regroup. Truly great mercys are fantastic

An idea for mercy.  
1. Can only resurrect 1 teammate.  
2. Ult charges faster  

Rez right now is too much of a gamble to be relied upon. This way, rez is a counter losing a key teammate in a team fight, to be used when mercy is still around other teammates. To make her better when on her own/defending herself give a speed boost when her pistol is out.

This makes the competitive scene weak and unstable. Balances for pub play, don't necessarily work competitive and v/v. People find the competitive scene only by chance, or if they specifically look for it, creating a small player base.

Later updates that change the game to support competitive play, angers and splits the community. (Just look at TF2)

The problem is that gunboats are so good nobody wants to use anything else. The only way to change this is to either nerf gunboats or to buff soldier to take even less self damage. I personally wouldn't mind the second option to make the banners and shotty more viable.

You (and friends) try to solve a mystery by reading the details of the case.

Very fun and intensive game.
The ABC level of jump academy covers the absolute basics of rocket jumping. It only requires rocket jumping across a few gaps, up a ledge, and probably the hardest part for new players is basic air strafing through a hole without hitting the sides.

If you are waiting for the arm to raise for the backstabbing, the enemy will most likely move out of the way by the time you stab. Try to backstab the moment you face an opponent's back without waiting for the animation. It takes some practice and prediction, but is much more reliable.

Insurgency has a system where 3 players need to call for a vote kick before the votebox is brought up. It works pretty well to prevent rage kicking, though it is much harder to kick someone who should get kicked.
I might actually do this. I've never streamed before and it seems like a fun thing to try out. I'll get back to you when I get some time and choose a game to play.
The walking isn't really a problem since you can double click to instantly go to another scene. I agree that the plot twists were poorly thought out, though.
Filesystems are at their most basic, instructions of how to organize bits of a file for storage. Most modern filesystems break up data into small blocks, and then write some extra information about that data that can be used to prevent and/or reverse corruption. All this is usually done by the kernel or a kernel module, the software that preforms the most basic tasks of your operating system.

When writing to another filesystem it reads the data and lets the other filesystem's kernel module organize the data to its own specifications.

When writing to your NAS, you are most likely transferring data over TCP which itself is a kind of filesystem, but for transferring data. It also breaks up data into small blocks and has error correction. The NAS then reads that data, using TCP, and then writes it to the disk using the XFS module.

Windows doesn't include the module to read/write ext4 portions and so, can't read them. There is third party software that allows you to mount ext4 drives, but it is slower and probably has more risk of data corruption.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong at any part. I did my best to sum up my basic knowledge on this topic.

>Tf2 devs will streamline this map because it's got his name on it  

b4nny has never been involved in the dev process before so there is no precedence for assuming this will happen.

>tf2 development team does not care about community projects.  

Electric Boogaloo, End of the Line, Invasion updates. Even if they sucked, they still happened even though Valve is not obligated to.

>Understand there was not a single point in which I directed hate on b4nny or phi.  

You very clearly implied that you are dissatisfied that b4nny has sway within the TF2 community, so much that you speculate that the developers will add the map into the game officially before other, preferred projects

edit: also, why can't you just be happy that it could come into the game. More content is good for everyone. Just because you prefer other projects doesn't mean other projects can't make it into the game as well. I sincerely hope Frontline makes it into the game as an official update. I'm a fan. But don't bash other projects just because of some minor dislike for the creator.

Also, this could very likely make it into the game sooner because it's just a single map, unlike frontline. It could very well *be* part of the update, if it ever happens
Apparently seeing how the votes went from +7 to -1 now. I think it is safe to assume the shills from the anti-b4nny echo chamber are adamant to bury this.
/r/tf2 will streamline these downvotes because it's got his name on it. Sure, more content for TF2 is great, but anyone who was born with the correct number of chromosomes knows that the b4nny is a egomaniac that doesn't deserve to have an opinion on the direction to take this game. ((Regardless of popularity)). In the off chance /r/tf2 likes something b4nny also likes, they resort to personal attacks. Example. Above comment.
Whether or not it is good content is inconsequential. /r/tf2 bashes b4nny.

For browsers there are several data compression addons, but the downside is that all data is routed through a third party. I haven't used any so I can't suggest a specific one.

You can also install NoScript which prevents scripts from executing on sites. This can prevent data being sent back and forth from your browser and the webserver, but it does break some sites from displaying or working correctly.

Another option is to install a text only browser like lynx, on your home server and browse internet over SSH on your client device. (I assume that only the text displayed is sent over ssh, not the website data. If this is wrong someone correct me.)
If words are not set in stone, then it should be alright to correct people on word usage to what you perceive as correct. Otherwise words meanings would be set in stone.

In the fonts include a backup font like so:
    URxvt*font: xft:Fira Mono for Power line:regular:size=11, xft:Deja Vu Sans:size=11

If you see a player cheating best thing is to record it. Get the player's Steam ID by typing "record player-name" or "status" in the console; player names don't mean anything since they can be changed.

You can try sending the info to customer support  at New World Interactive (not Valve, they didn't develop the game and don't provide support for it) and they might issue a ban on the player.

Save it as a script, put it in your $PATH and you can call it by name from terminal, bar, or a launcher.

Just fixed it. Thanks for the heads up.
Glad to be of help.
I'm not sure what the problem could be. Try binding another program to the key combo to see if that still works.

You could also try symlinking or copying the script to /usr/bin so that you can call it by name without the path.
I just tested it again with dmenu and dmenu2 and it works fine.

Can I get the output of

edit:  
./= will work if you're in the folder where = is located. Or you can copy/symlink it to /usr/bin or preferably to a [custom PATH](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/environment_variables#Per_user) you set up to be able to call it from anywhere with just the script name.
Did you make the script executable?

edit: or if you would like to keep using an image viewer, I use [imv](https://github.com/eXeC64/imv) because of feh's weird behavior.
Unlikely.

Nope, it worked right away for me.
[This (free) online](https://www.coursera.org/learn/songwriting) course goes into depth in getting a natural singing cadence. It requires no obligations, so you can just watch the video lectures, I highly recommend it.

Not strictly guitar related, but I enjoyed these music audio books.

Perfecting Sound Forever: An Aural history of recorded music  
The history of music recording technology and techniques. Has a great overview of the rise of record companies, the changes from radio, to phonograph, to tape, to cd, and even more recent events such as the loudness war.

Mostly yes, but it may require tweaking. Each folder is for a different application, so if you want the i3 config, copy the contents of the i3 folder to your home directory. Be careful and backup your files first, though.
Thanks!
I'm staying on arch, so it is an option, but with budgie + wmutils, I've gotten so close to how I actually want to use a WM, there is really no need.

Sure. Tiling is too strict for me with the sharp delineation between tiled windows and floating windows. Snapping windows to the edges is all the tiling I need. Plus I like title bars so I don't have to press a modifier to drag windows.

I wanted something basic, didn't want to deal with openbox's xml and standalone mutter is too barebones, so I went with budgie.
The info on my [Github repo](https://github.com/onespaceman/dotfiles/tree/64ebed545a9cf066765cecee463e2d3fdc60ab96) is pretty comprehensive, so check it out there.

I'm switching to budgie desktop, so I made this farewell post before I nuke everything.

edit: [Archived release for posterity](https://github.com/onespaceman/dotfiles/releases/tag/v1.0.0) for when files get overwritten by my new setup.
Here is [a script](https://github.com/onespaceman/dotfiles/blob/master/scripts/scripts/music) I use to arrange windows. It's for floating windows, but the idea is the same.

It opens urxvt with some command and gives it a unique name with -name.  
Then i3-msg changes the terminal windows using the name it assigned before.  
I3-msg uses the same commands as in the config file, so you can just write out the commands in the order you execute them to get the end result
That's fine, thanks!
Everything looks fine, so it must be a problem with lemonbar.
nevermind, that's probably the percent for volume. I would suggest running
>bash -x /your/script
without piping it to see if the problem is with the script or lemonbar.
line 62 you have a stray "%" before "$space"
hmm. Add "break" on a line after the sleep command and get the contents of 
>bash -x /your/lemonbar/script

The "break" makes the script only loop once so you don't get a huge wall of text, so don't forget to remove it once you're done.
Don't use $ when you declare variables.

If it still doesn't work can I get your .Xresources file.
Could you post the updated script?

Line 25 you have %FG instead of $FG. Also you don't have the variables for colors set as anything.  
Either change the $C0 variables to $COLOR etc. or the $COLOR variables to $C0.
I bought it too, and feel like it was worth it. The constant Iine puzzle did get tedious though, so I'm taking a few days break before jumping back in.
Try some ancient literature. I enjoyed the Iliad, the Odyssey, and Herodotus' Histories from Librevox (I don't remember which readers though, so I can't recommend a version.)
Yep. This got post here not too long ago, and now I try to help with the misconceptions. The original explanations aren't too bad, just a little inaccurate/simplified.

Yeah, your right. I mixed up roguelike and dungeon crawler for a bit.
Unepic also is a coop roguelike. It is actually very clever with the death mechanic. When a player dies, they are sent back to the last checkpoint. In boss fights dying is inevitable, so the strategy is to stagger deaths, so at least one player is alive in the boss's chamber, and for that player to remain alive long enough for the revived players to get back to the chamber in time. If all players die, the boss is reset.

Why the double bars?
Go to each playlist, select all the songs, right click, add to library.
With a FIFO file, I can have variable refresh rates. I don't need the bar checking for pacman updates every second. Also I can use the inbuilt "mpc idle" command to wait for song changes to update the current song.
Very nice, comrade.
Ultimate edition. The DLCs were my favorite parts of any of the games.

That tutorial is for lemonbar OR dzen2. So use either one.

Cool. I'll keep an eye out for it.
Did you click "Add Port Forwarding Rule" before "Save Settings?"
I'm interested. Do you have a github or similar? I'd like to take a look at it.
Crytonomicon  
Part of the story is a fictional rendition of Bletchley park (WWII code breaking facility). Walks the reader through how basic cryptography works, different encryption methods, and how it is/can be used.
I'm going to be vague to avoid spoilers. After watching it, I could see that the game was pretty and the soundtrack was beautiful (I still listen to it from time to time), but it didn't blow me away. I then read about other people's experiences with the game and the moments that stood out for them were what can't be experienced from a video - the exploration, the interactions, and realizations about certain features of the game.

If you know someone with a PS3, I'd suggest borrowing it and then renting the game. It's not long and can be played in less than 2 hours.
I included them because they are the backstory to the Aeneid.
#####The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire - Edward Gibbon
The standard reading for Roman history. One of the first mostly objective histories of the later Roman Empire and up to the fall of the Byzantine Empire. Very long and dry, has its flaws, but still a good read. Prepare to read the word avarice 60 billion times.

#####The Rise of Rome - Anthony Everitt
Pretty good overview of the beginnings of Rome. Great job of telling how likely a part of the history is true or legend.

#####The Classics - The Iliad/Odyssey, The Aeneid, The Republic, etc
After you get an overview of Rome's history, you can read these to see what Romans saw as their history, and their own views of the times.

#####Biographies
Haven't read many, but Adrian Goldsworthy's books on Julius Caesar and Augustus are pretty good.

Because that's how magazines work in real life.

When you insert a new magazine, you chamber the first round, which means the magazine now has one less round. When you reload, the round from the first magazine stays in the chamber, so the second magazine remains full.
Already a feature.

I tried homeshick and gnu stow, but decided it was overkill for such a simple job.

I just wrote a bash script where it copies the current dotfiles (which are specified as a list at the top of script) to a git repo. With option flags, I can first save the old dotfiles as a release (to easliy archive an old setup), or commit and push the changes to github.

No. I played offline with friends using this setup.
In console type  
>map [map name] [gamemode]

and have other players open their console and type

The map names and game modes should show up as a list when you type the first few letters and you can hit tab to auto complete it.

If you want to change the script as mentioned in the other comments, the [Ubuntu manpage](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/vivid/man1/mpc.1.html) lists all the possible commands for mpc. Helpful if you need just the album title or artist returned with a command.
Thanks for the album art script.

A little hint: instead of the sleep timer you can add

>mpc idle player

which waits until mpc preforms an action.

I'm on to you dkeg.
Yeah, I had to change the default action to not invert colors.

You'll have to add "rgb" as an argument when you run the script

I think i fixed it.  
Try the [new version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onespaceman/polyfy/master/polyfy), see if it works.
Good catch. Thanks

If you're on windows you'll need to install cygwin. I don't have any experience with it so I don't have more help than that.

If you figured it out or are on Linux/OSX, install [imagemagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) and download the [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onespaceman/polyfy/master/polyfy).  
Make it executable by running
>chmod +x /path/to/script

The commands to actually make images are on [github](https://github.com/onespaceman/polyfy)

If you aren't familiar with the terminal, all this isn't very easy to make sense of and really isn't worth the effort for just this script. All it does is make editing automatic for a few layouts.
👍👍👍
None. It's just a wallpaper :D

Edit: I realized you might have meant the screenshot from /u/Djzongreethesecond.  
It's from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/3owphw/saturated_gradients_xfce4/)
Didn't know there was a name for this. Thanks, will do.
Great Idea!  
It's actually quite easy.
in lines 64 and 137 change $file to $file2
and under line 86 add  
>file2="$1"; shift

now the command is
>polyfy /path/to/file /file/to/cut/shape/from <options>

It only works if the two images are the same size though. I'll work on it, see if I can get it to work with any size and add it into the script if I can.
Thanks! It's for the greater good of ricier rices so I think it applies.
Much appreciated!

If people can make post praising a game that they finally got around to playing, they are also allowed to make posts criticizing games. Otherwise, this sub would be a feedback-loop of the most popular opinions.

If I understand it correctly, X used to do jobs that are now part of the kernel or software libraries, and has extra steps that aren't needed anymore. Modifying X to get rid of these steps would break compatibility/be too much work, so it's better to write a new display server and have people move over to it.

Any book about the Roman greats such as Julius Caesar, Scipio, Pompey, and Agrippa. Adrian Goldsworthy's biographies of these figures are very good.
I haven't really seen much hate for Linux from Mac gamers, just mutual sympathy and support. Apple gets a lot of hate from windows gamers as well, and even some Linux users (overpriced, garbage specs etc.). On /r/macgaming many people are excited that Linux is gaining traction because of the OS similarities and because opengl is used by us both.

Of course this could just be cognitive bias, but this has been my experience.
Agree. I'm finishing up the third volume right now and is a great overview of not only Rome/Italy, but the rise of European and Middle Eastern powers as well. Just be prepared to read the word "avarice" a billion times.

Both are great! They do get a bit repetitive, but the games are short enough that it isn't too annoying.
The Costume Quest games.
The Discworld series is like R&M but fantasy instead of sci-fi. Both have nonsensical logic, are very quotable, and can be profound at times.
Depends on if you actually have a dedicated card. Open up you applications folder > Utilities > System Information > Graphics/Displays and see if you have something other than Intel listed, like AMD or Nvidia.
All macs have an Intel integrated graphics, but high end ones also have dedicated graphics cards.

Integrated graphics are not really cards, but are built in as part of the processor. Even though these have really improved over the past few years, they are still weak and can't run many games very well or at all.
A windows phone style launcher would look nice and can cover the whole home screen with shortcuts and widgets.

You could also argue that the user was never given the source code, but the compiled code. Having a compiled version doesn't obligate the provider to give the source as well.

No. The El Capitan doesn't have a true ping-pong effect. It only slightly delays between the left and right channels to create depth. If you still want a Strymon the new Dig pedal has ping-pong delay.
On Intelligence by Jeff Hawkins is a good non-fiction book about intelligence in general. It proposes what actually defines intelligence and how brains might work. The last part talks about how AI would look like, how it would think, how self aware it would be, and how it might be used.
The Discworld series by Terry Pratchett. He details much of the world and often compares it to our universe and how it differs. There are even "The Science of Discworld" books that teach our real universe's properties while explaining how it works in the fictional world.
[Rondo cases](http://www.rondomusic.com/pedalcases.html) are also a nice affordable option.
No. It's only good if you are OK with the developer's chosen workflow and with limited customization. Plus, it's looks like it has been abandoned after the initial release and first few updates.

Much better (free) alternatives are available now, like feedlyreader, Palabre, News+, etc.
Alternatively, try a journal/diary app. I don't have any specific recommendations as I don't use one, but many apps do have a calendar built in, and their main function is writing notes for specific days.

To do that open up the command prompt and type in

Any tips for new players? I play and love Insurgency and heard that Red Orchestra is in the same vein. I played for two hours and got a grand total of one kill and ~20 deaths. I keep getting sniped by players I never see, even when I follow my team mates and do what they do.
It would be FPP since the S stands for shooter.

Also, the list needs to add Insurgency. The best go-to multiplayer FPS in my opinion.
8.1 uses far less resources than 7 and games usually run better (at least on my Macbook). All the complaints about 8 are about the interface, but at most it's only an annoyance.

 I agree that the gameplay would be hard to recreate, but the rest aren't that special. The story wasn't FTL's strong suit, though the lore and classes were interesting. The soundtrack was great, but hardly replaceable.

The modding community is great for FTL, but small. I expect the multiplayer aspect of solar crusaders will result in more communication and sharing (unless, of course, the game is a flop.)

 The Dev is also committed to keeping to updated and is very active with his users on g±.
I don't have an RSS feed but a tip to see if your existing games on Steam have been ported. In your library show only your games on Linux, add all of them to a category. Now any newly ported games will show up as not categorized.

If you have your library organized already and don't want to mess that up, go through your games one-by-one and add all Windows-only games to a category. That way when you show Linux-only games that category will show up if there are any new ports.

Hope this is clear enough.

This is nonsense. Digital signals are not shaped like anything — they are sequences of numbers. Unfortunately, the type of representation in diagram 8 has led many people to confuse graphics with reality.

Let's be clear. When the samples in a digital signal are converted back into an analogue signal, they pass through a device called a reconstruction filter. This is the process that makes the Sampling Theorem work in the real world. If there are enough samples and they are of sufficient resolution, the signal that emerges is not only smooth but virtually identical to the analogue signal from which the samples were originally derived.

I agree that it isn't infinitely exact, but it's exact enough that it doesn't matter in real world use.
Digitally produced sine waves are no different than analogue ones.

Here is is a good [article](http://xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html) on the subject and the easier to understand [video](http://xiph.org/video/vid2.shtml).
Yeah. Just like people who use fuzz. It's a nice effect to use at crescendos and such, but I wish people would focus on the real music.^^^/s
Getting that high number can be fun, though. Arcade games have had high scores since they started. People make up challenges like speedruns or collect-em-alls and have a blast doing it. The only difference is that some challenges are not tracked in game and the other are.

People have different ideas of fun and it's fine to include these, especially if it doesn't affect those who don't like it.

Example: I would probably never use the knife if not for trying to get that achievement for knifing 5 enemies in one round and I have a blast every time I try.
I enjoyed the game, though. It's very relaxing, and uses the phone's touchscreen and accelerometer features pretty well. Also the art is phenomenal.
If it's the horn blasts she likes, she might also like ska. The Aquabats are kid-friendly, but I don't know too much beyond that.
So many, I just can't choose.

Bastion + Transistor, Mark of the Ninja, and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons are some off the top of my head.

Closure is a neat indie puzzle-platform game with a black-and-white charcoal art style. It has a cool mechanic where the platforms are only there when lit up with light, so you have to carry around light-balls and rotate spotlights to traverse the level.

It also has a neat soundtrack with title song sounding like the soundtrack from Portal.
What about a cheap FM transmitter? Couple that with cheap pocket radio or see if your phones have FM receivers built in.
Each set of beamed notes is equal to one quarter note in length.
Perpendicular to the strings. Slanted buckers are still parallel to each other.
I made those :)

A little easter egg: If you inspect element and find the image for the picks, you'll also see guitar silhouettes that were meant to be used for flair.
Mount & Blade has the best swordplay I've encountered. Both attacking and blocking is controlled by mouse movement so it feels like you're following through with a swing.
Pushbullet.

Most wineskins have to be setup specifically for each game, as most require certain libraries/tools/settings and won't work unless setup right. Try downloading the files from theportingteam.com for the games you want.
Listen through the whole Discworld series. Each book is fantastic, and both Nigel Planer and Stephen Briggs are great narrators.
Race the Sun is incredibly peaceful once you get the hang of it. Until you cash, and the sound is like nails on a chalkboard.

The Bridge - A mix between Braid and Limbo. Not as great as either but still enjoyable.

Antichamber - Portal and Escher mixed together

The Swapper - Dark space puzzle where you can clone yourself to get past obstacles. One of my favorite atmospheres in any game.

Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons - more an adventure than a puzzle, but a very good play.
Do you have any task killers installed?
The Anomaly games are tower offense where you have to destroy towers and get past defenses instead of defending.

Got one to replace a Barber Tone Press and it's much more transparent.
Yep. I like the Unix system and security because much better than windows. OSX feels like it was thought out to be cohesive, while Windows has some great ideas that are just half baked.

I honestly would love to move to Linux instead, but it's severely lacking in proprietary software that I use (mostly music/video production), so I use the next best thing.
I listened to the audio book and it was great, understandable, and nicely narrated (I can't recall which version I listened to, though). The biggest downside was when I wanted to look up a character/place on the wiki, I had no idea how to spell it.
I don't have a specific recommendation, but gog.com has a nice selection of gaming-related films that you can check out. They are also DRM free.

I play survival and checkpoint the other way around. In survival I just rush to the next point as fast as possible and only shoot if I see the enemy. Otherwise I dash and duck. With checkpoint I take it slow and try to weed out any insurgents before moving in.
Or you know, people actually enjoy the comics and like sharing them when they are relevant. It's not supposed to be overly funny, but is observational humor.

VVVVV - hard platformer by the same developer as Super Hexagon

Super Meat Boy - another hard platformer

Race the Sun - obstacle racing

Bit.trip games - rhythm games

Dude just use bootcamp. It's much easier than trying to make wineskin/crossover work.

I kid, I kid. Yes that counts, now.
Right now a share of Google Inc is worth $541 so 4,400,000,000/541 = ~8133087 shares
Technically no, since the Apple IIe used DOS and not Mac.
Braid - Puzzler with cool rewind mechanics. Always recommended along with Limbo

The Bridge - like a mix between Braid and Limbo

Super hexagon - in the vein of VVVVV and by the same developer. Super hard and a great game to get a quick fix.

 Antichamber - an Escher-like portal.

Fez - another geometric puzzler. Very cool art style, mechanics, and hidden secrets.

Spacechem - Very fun logic gate puzzle. Gets really hard after first few levels.

The swapper - a dark space adventure and puzzle
On intelligence by Jeff Hawkins - a theory of what intelligence is, how the brain might work, and how AI might act and look like, and its effect on society.

This is your Brain on Music by Daniel Levitin - Why we have and like music and its psychology.
The Bridge is a puzzle game that's like a mix of Limbo and Braid. It's not the best game but very interesting if you liked the other two.

Just updated to 10.2.5 and its giving me a blank screen and the Play Services error. Didn't happen before. On lollipop 5.0.2 and Reddit sync Dev.

Edit: Clear data/reinstall didn't fix it, but I installed the pro beta version and it works fine.

Edit2: I'm moving to the Pro app from now on. Is there any way to have the pizza theme activate in here that I bought in the Dev version?
You're welcome, you idiot.
I think the best way is to have people PM the gifter for the key. That way OP could personally handle each gift.
I don't like the term psychedelic because I'm not a fan of drug culture or use, and it puts me off any music that has direct references to such.

That said I do like the music that comes out with the label, my favorites being The Flaming Lips and My Morning Jacket. I find psychedelic music has much more beautiful orchestration, doesn't stick to the typical song structure as much, and has just enough weird to keep it both interesting and listenable.
Oh yeah. I meant to say not to try wrappers for New Vegas specifically. I've had good results with wrappers for other games too.
This would be nice for smartwatches, though.
Yeah parallels is not any good for gaming. Use the Mac version, it runs pretty well.
I say don't even try wrappers. I spent a ridiculous amount of time trying every wrapper I could find with different tweaks to try to make New Vegas work, but the furthest I ever got was the main menu. Fallout 3, on the other hand, was very easy to setup and worked well.

This is my top wanted feature for Play Music. I'd like the default action on playing a playlist/album is to resume where I left off instead of starting anew.

Anyone know where I could make a feature request that google would actually see?
Mount and Blade Warband is loads of fun with other players. It requires some practice to get the hang of, but is great to blunder through together.

Garry's mod is great for just messing around or to play some unique game modes like prop hunt, murder, or Terrorists in Tinseltown.

I also second Civ5, though it does takes forever to play through a game.
Cryptonomicon is mostly about cryptography, but it might be something you like. It alternates between WWII and modern timelines and teaches some great things about both old-fashioned and modern wiretapping, cryptography and code breaking.
The Bridge is very similar to Braid and gets hard towards the last levels.

Antichamber is a pretty unique first person puzzler. Has a similar feel to portal.

Fez by itself isn't very hard but the secrets do give a nice secondary challenge.

Spacechem is one the hardest but most rewarding puzzle games I've played. It involves building "machines" that break apart and bond elements and requires forethought, programmer-type problem solving, and trial-and-error to solve.
Get a file manager app and make a new file named ".nomedia" to the folder you want to exclude.
I wonder how it would look like with the power supplies plugged into a power conditioner, like a Furman.
I was going to say to stop downvoting you for having a differing opinion from the majority, but to devalue someone else *opinions* on what makes a game great is just narcissistic.
Sleeping dogs is pretty much GTA set in Hong Kong with Batman style combat.
The Portal games are fun puzzlers with funny dialogue. The Batman games are some of the most fun games I've played, though a bit violent (less so than shooters though IMO). Garry's Mod is a great companion to Minecraft. It's a sandbox that allows you to build pretty much anything from cars to rockets to designing your own game levels. It's a bit of learning how to download assets and manipulate items in the game but not too difficult.
I haven't played the Talos Principle (yet) but I like Jeff Hawkins' On Intelligence. It discusses what intelligence and consciousness is, how AI might look, work, and feel like, be different from humans, and its applications in the future. It is non-fiction, but is aimed at any average reader.
I know. Usually a good story enough to keep me going, but I was just so frustrated and had other, better games to play that I decided it wasn't worth it.
I agree. The gameplay was abysmally boring (very much like Spec Ops: The Line which I couldn't even finish) and the story didn't wow me like the first did. It did have great moments, but I think the hammer-to-head explanations in the end ruined it.
/r/ifyoulikeblank is a nice subreddit for these type of questions and suggestions
The swapper
Thanks. I've been wanting something like this.
Not entirely similar, but Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons gave me the same feeling as Bastion. Both have colorful settings, but hide a dark story.

Darren Korb also wrote the soundtrack to Transistor. It's very similar to Bastion's.

Antichamber is another game with weird geometry and exploration.
For new Post-rock I'd also recommend Saudade by I/O. The song Input/Output has the best bass guitar I've heard.
Mark of the Ninja. It's a 2D game, but is my favorite stealth game and very well done. Allows you to kill everyone to make shadow runs. Great use of distractions, concealment, and planing.
You're right. The interviewer said eff at 5s but the band member said E.F. later on.
If you can't find one there are open-source/free alternatives available like musescore or lilypond.

Get 8. It boots much faster, uses less resources, takes up almost the same amount of disk space. The metro interface is different, sometimes annoying, but not that much of a downside.
It runs great on my 2011 MBP. Should work fine on yours.

Can second this. I've had these for a little over a year for gym\work use and they are still going strong. Battery life lasts ~8 hours and has great sound. They aren't the most comfortable though.
The Glitch 2 vst should be able to do it, IIRC.

You can pause FTL with spacebar at any time to do actions.
Strategy games like Civilizations, Xcom, Crusader Kings 2, Hearthstone, or FTL

If you like point and click adventures try games by Amanita Design and Deadelic.

Kerbal Space Program is also great.

Three kinds of people, then.

Those who take it far too seriously, those who take it with the right amount of seriousness, those who use it as a tool, and those with a fanatical devotion to the pope.

Four! Four kinds of people.
I played and loved it. The music is, as always, superb. The gameplay is fun with a combination of real-time and pause-and-plan combat sort of like FTL or Fallout's VATS. Voice acting is great.

The story is slightly unsatisfying, but I would play again.
A quick Google search found this site http://www.chrisconly.com/free-rhythm-backing-tracks/.
You may have to remap the keys in the emulator's preferences.
Kwaidan is a collection of Japanese folk stories. Very interesting as a contrast to western literature.

Progression is free, has material design, and an active dev.

Go to Universal Access, remove steam from the list completely, restart steam and allow when it asks for permissions again. This worked for me even before the update, so it might be worth a try.
I've fed a TC Hall of Fame and Strymon El Capistan into themselves to create a doubling of reverb and delay to create extra long washes. A warning though, it's easy to go into feedback and might damage your ears/amp if you're not ready for it.
Progression is a workout tracker that is completely free. The Dev removed all ads recently, and is still planing to update with more features like google fit integration and exercise illustrations. Link me: Progression
I think Steam's review system is better than most, since it's just a recommend/don't recommend system. It places more emphasis on the description than on the average points/stars given by people.

It does have flaws though. Funny reviews get too many votes, people don't recommend a game solely because they don't think it was worth the price they paid, niche games are more likely to get "mixed" reviews.

/u/Poem_for_your_sprog is my favorite user in reddit. S/he shows every once in a while with a beautifully written poem and leaves, like a soft-spoken /u/awildsketchappeared.
I use Viral Popup which plays in a floating window that you can position anywhere on the screen.
That probably means it's connected. Have you tried using it in Steam Big Picture mode? Also try to see if it works when plugged into USB.
Why not use openemu instead? Would probably work better.
I really enjoyed Things the Grandchildren Should Know by Mark Everett of the band The Eels. It tells a great story of going through the tragedies and general nihilism that life gives, and still be able to find worthwhile reasons to enjoy and love life. (This is just what I got from the book, it really isn't that cheesy).
I discovered it the same way, about 2 years ago. I was also hooked on first listen and remains one of my favorite albums to this day.

I enjoyed the composition of the songs because they play like movements in classically composed music with tempo changes and dynamic range, but infused with weirdness, which is hard to find in many modern genres.

That said, I still rate Soft Bulletin higher, though I didn't much like it at first. I like the melancholy mood of Soft Bulletin much more than the optimism in Yoshimi.
The Submarines
Yep. That's what I use as well. Dev is constantly updating it too, so still worth buying.
FYI there are audiobook apps that speed up playback. I usually listen at 1.4x regular speed because the regular speed is just too slow.
A+ game if you liked Bastion, but wanted better gameplay.

It has a pause-and-plan alongside real-time combat that reminds me of Fallout's VATS system, but more advanced/useful.

My personal opinion is that the story is not as great as Bastion's, but the atmosphere is cooler.
It just has to find a niche to be successful. Pebble is still doing well despite growing competition, because it focuses on its strengths (battery life, always on display, cross-platform). Apple's watch's greatest weakness is that it's tied to iOS. Windows making their watch platform independent could really help it become popular.
I couldn't get New Vegas to work at all with wineskin. Fallout 3 worked very well (a few crashes throughout the game, so quicksave occasionally) by downloading a pirated wineskin version and installing steam in the wrapper and installing FO3 regularly.
There are a few developers on the Google Fit [site](https://developers.google.com/fit/) though i don't know if their apps are integrated yet
That's not an unpopular opinion. It's actually the predominant one, at least on reddit. People support municipal ISPs because it is the most probable solution to getting better speeds. Other companies won't move in to compete with the local ISP and google fiber is even less likely.

It is easier to work with your local government than to lobby state or federal politicians to disallow the current oligopoly.
The Darth Bane Trilogy if you like Star Wars
Not really futurism at this point, by Cryptonomicon goes into detail about cryptography and even talks about cryptocurrency and its uses. Impressive considering it was published in 1999. It is historical fiction, though, so not exactly what you're looking for.

For nonfiction I recommend On Intelligence. It mostly is about what intelligence is and theories of how the brain works, but does talk about artificial intelligence, how it might look, act, and be used.
Steam and spelunky need to be installed in the same wrapper. It won't work from different ones.
Race for the Prize, The Spark that Bled, and Yoshimi Battles pt 1 are great starting points
The Flaming Lips' Soft Bulletin and Yoshimi albums.
Short answer is to me it feels like the artist is just pandering.
I don't hate hip-hop as music (I really like it, actually), but I hate the culture that goes along with it. I despise the gangster, stoner, and misogynistic lyrics that goes along with the genre.

I do like some nerdcore songs with more absurdist lyrics, but for every one of those songs, there are thousands that are about video games/internet culture which just make me cringe.

I agree. I still haven't finished the game because I keep getting too frustrated. I only keep (kept?) going back because the story was interesting.

And the music is completely unmemorable. Each time someone mentions it I only have a vague recollection and have to relisten to it on YouTube.
Map it to a virtual controller using controllermate. It's a bit tedious but almost always works when I wanted to use a dualshock 4 for a game that only supports Xbox controllers. Also let's me set a dead zone for the analogue sticks.
8.1 is much faster than 7. Boot up time is ~15s vs 60s and I've yet to experience the slowdowns I've come to expect from Windows. Plus you get a free upgrade to Win10.

I can try. I still can complain and petition Verizon, but it seems that half of /r/android is mad at me for doing so. I still have a voice and will use it as much as I can.

I wish I could use TMobile (and I probably will when Verizon kicks me off my grandfathered unlimited plan), but I don't have a designated workplace or WiFi. It's multiple job sites that change every few months when we finish.
I actually like older stories because I can read one after another without waiting for the next installment.

Plus I don't miss the discussion because I never comment here anyway.

Wait...
We want a subsidized phone because Verizon doesn't lower bills, no matter if we buy subsidized or not. We just don't want to double spend.

And Verizon is the only carrier at my city who has good reception in the 50 mile radius that I work.
Apple does have the advantage of having a desktop OS to implement their features. Android users will always have to install a third party app to get anywhere.

That's why I'm excited for Android App support in Google Chrome. It will finally allow for a uniform experience between desktop and mobile devices without being limited to a single OS.
You might like Cloud Atlas. It has parts that are written in different voices and formats (a journal, letters to a friend, etc.). While each part mostly stands alone they share themes and references to one another.

The tomi paldanius cover of Living on a Prayer is incredibly fun and relatively easy to learn.
The riddler trophies in Batman Arkham City were some of the most fun I ever had. Also Psychonauts.
The puzzle is a standard explanation of the psychology of music. If you're interested in more I suggest reading *This is your Brain on Music* by Daniel Levitin.
I recommend *The Garden Of Forking Paths* as an introduction. It's a short story that has been adapted to and inspired many other works and is the story magic realism is introduced with in literature classes.
Definitely try out the Discworld series. Pratchett has a similar comedic style with 4th wall humor and cultural references.
Yep same here. I don't really know who the guitarists in my favorite bands are but just enjoy and try to use what I hear.
I have the mission engineering VP-1. It has a built in buffer and tuner out (though you need a stereo to dual mono cable for that.) It also doesn't use a string/ribbon so you never have to worry about it breaking like in Earnie pedals.

It replaced my Boss volume pedal which cut out a lot of my treble even when I didn't use the tuner out. The MEVP doesn't have this problem.
Naya's Quest (free flash game) and Antichamber also have weird geometry.
It does say a brief history, not a comprehensive history.
FYI there are fonts that help with some forms of dyslexia. If you use ebooks I'm sure you would be able to load them on a kindle or PC for her to be able to read easier.
Machinarium, World of Goo, Waking Mars, The Cave
[Glitch 2](http://illformed.org) should work nicely, even if it's not the specific VST TWDY uses.

Also /r/wearethemusicmakers is a good place for such questions.
I started with the Discworld series a few months ago and am up to #25 so far. By suggestion on /r/discworld I'm just reading in publication order which I like because ~40 books are a lot to go through and the jumps between stories keep each plotline from getting boring. Plus you'll miss fewer references to other storylines this way.

The audio books for Discworld are great. Just make sure to get the ones read by Nigel Planer and the later ones by Stephen Briggs.
High Strung
For an audio interface I recommend the TC Desktop Konnekt if you have FireWire. You can get one for ~$120 and it has the same preamp as in TC's high end interfaces. Very good quality and easy to use.
I second this book. Also I'm currently reading Catastrophe 1914 which goes much more in depth into the first year of the war and am enjoying it very much.
I recommend this book as well. It's a great read, easy to understand and informative.
No its just that you don't acknowledge that houseofjazz has a valid opinion that just differs from yours and you are acting like a jerk about it. Please don't do that.
What is wrong with you?
Here are some of mine from another thread

You could look into headphones that have active noise control. They listen to sounds around you and generate "anti-noise"
I'm listening to the Discworld series right now. It's a fantasy/satire series with about 40 books. All are at enjoyable and easy to follow and Nigel Planer is a great narrator.
I can't say which one is better first but read PSF if you are more interested in history and TIYBOM if you'd rather learn the science.
Lightning browser because it's fast and has easy navigation with slide-out drawers
In addition to learning music theory as suggested by others I recommend reading two books.

Perfecting Sound Forever: An Aural History of Recorded Music is a great history of music recording methods, formats, and problems.

This is Your Brain On Music is a great explanation on the theories of why we have music the psychology of enjoying/disliking certain music.

Both are available as audio books if you aren't a big reader.
Naya's Quest is free flash game made by the creator of VVVVVV and Super Hexagon. Its main mechanic is playing around with isometric geometry.

Antichamber is also really mind-bending.
I also use a OCD and love my Strymon El Capistan. The best tape delay emulator IMO. Also check out /r/guitarpedals if you haven't already.
The Swapper, Braid, Thomas Was Alone, Tiny and Big, Trine, and Waking Mars.

If you like point and click games play Botanicula, Machinarium, and Super brothers: Swords and Sworcery.
Then you might like a dungeon crawler like Diablo or Torchlight. I can't give a specific recommendation for which one as I haven't played too much of those games.
The To The Moon OST also has moody piano music.
If you like the humor in Borderlands try Saints Row
The Rest is Noise by Alex Ross - Brief overview of Modernist music. Very dry and opinionated at times.  
Perfecting Sound Forever: An aural History of Recorded Music by Greg Miller - cannot recommend enough to anyone interested in music recordings.   
This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession by Daniel Levitin   
Jazz: A History of America's Music by Geoffrey Ward   
Things the Grandchildren Should Know - A neat memoir by Mark Everett of The Eels
Yes please.
Shadowgrounds Survivor. I haven't played it so I can't give any information on how it plays.

XCom/Xenonauts is grid based and has RPG elements, but it's more a strategy/tactics game.
appsandoranges.com is sort of what you want.
That's a fantastic couplet.
You could try some Noir classics like M (German film), The Maltese Falcon, Sunset Boulevard, and The Third Man.

For newer films I liked Brick, Blade Runner, and LA Confidential.
The Discworld series by Terry Pratchett. He makes fun of fantasy cliches very well in unexpected ways, and has very memorable passages and one-liners. Every few chapters had me pausing for a minute to chuckle over a phrase.
Just a tip, you can get wineskin wrappers for windows games and just get rid of the Windows partition. It's more work to setup but will probably be worth it because OSX has so little malware compared to Windows.
I'm playing Guacamelee right now and recommend as a fun experience. Its a 2D brawler that works really well with a controller.

NASB is a good modern translation that keeps much of the traditional English translation. ESV/ASV are translations from the original Hebrew/Aramaic/Greek texts and are as literal as possible while still understandable to an English reader. Read NASB if you'd rather have an more Anglican narration or ESV for a more Hebrew/Early Christian narration.
Get Torchlight. They have the same gameplay as far as I remember from playing it ~10 years ago. It goes down to $3 on sales so it will be much better value.
I don't play on consoles so can't give any recommendations, but you should be able to use a controller with some of these on PC.  
Just check on a game's Steam page if it has controller support.
Not a life-changer, but I found Things The Grandchildren Should Know to be very motivational, and not in the cheesy "how to make everything awesome" way, but more of "life is worth living even if the good times are scarce."
The term your looking for is "Indie Games." And your living in their golden age :)

Bastion - Hack and slash action with beautiful story and music. If you want a steam key PM me. I have a leftover from a humble bundle. 
Mark of the Ninja - Ninja  
FEZ - Very pretty puzzle/adventure with hidden secrets abound  
Rogue Legacy, FTL, Super Meat Boy, Hotline Miami - You die a lot  
Torchlight - dungeon crawler  
Frozen Synapse - Tactics/Strategy  
Super Hexagon - fun time waster for a few minutes at a time  
The Swapper - relaxing puzzler that I think is just beautiful  
Psychonauts - a cartoony, fun 3D platformer. Anything by DoubleFine is good, really.  
If you like point and click games get any game by Amanita Design. They're all good

He'd love Dredd. It's a prime example of a no nonsense action flick.
If connected a PS3 controller through Bluetooth to my macbook, no problem. For the TV you need a mini display to HDMI adapter (about $8 on monoprice.com) and you should be set to go
I've played through it a couple of times because it's so calming. And to try to get that pesky achievement of only dying so many times in a play through :)
VVVVVV is similarly unforgiving with fast replays

These are recommendations with the albums I like most

Simon & Garfunkel - Sounds of Silence and Bridge over Troubled Water

Kings of Convenience - Riot on and Empty Street

Iron and Wine - The Shepherd's Dog and Kiss Each Other clean for layered compositions. Older albums for simpler songs.

Belle and Sebastian - Dear Catastrophic Waitress, Boy With the Arab Stap

If you don't mind Bluegrass influenced folk - Nickel Creek - This Side
I like Google All access suggestions. They have been more accurate for what I like, especially for niche genres. If you don't have All Access you can just search on the play store and it gives you the same suggestions.
If playing clean or light OD you don't have the natural compression and sustain you get from dirt pedals/amp. A compressor can help with that.
On Intelligence by Jeff Hawkins. It's a theory of how the brain actually works and a criticism of modern neuroscience methods. Covers what intelligence is and how artificial intelligence will look like and affect us.
On Intelligence by Jeff Hawkins. Its a theory of how the brain actually works and a criticism of neuroscience to date that I enjoyed and wasn't a hard read. Covers what intelligence is and how artificial intelligence will look like and affect us.

The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene is a great introduction to modern quantum theories.

Our Mathematical Universe by Max Tegmark is on the multiple universes theory part of quantum mechanics as well as the mathematical nature of our universe(s). I personally don't take him too seriously especially when he added on irrelevant criticisms of the scientific community toward the end, but it's a novel read nonetheless.
That'll do it. Glad you got it to work.
Heh. I prefer Sync over News *because* I don't need to swipe between comments and the story. I'm glad there are so many reddit apps out there so the devs aren't yelled at to implement every users' preference of navigation in a single app.
I've used the Boss fv-500 with a flashback, and it worked fine.
Sucks to your ass-marr
If you like Douglas Adams, read his Dirk Gently books. They fit both criteria.
You can't. It's a bug with the WebKit/blink mobile engine
I've only played with it a few minutes but FL Studio is pretty neat though not as beginner friendly.
I think there's a bug/feature with recommended apps on Google play where when people swipe away recommendations, it automatically rates it as one star. Idk if this is still true, but you could look into it.
Archive.org has a copy

I wouldn't get the fuel tank. Mine is poorly isolated and makes my compressor and drive hum. A search on Google shows others also have this problem.
Try Memoryhouse's album The Slideshow Effect.

[Bonfire](http://youtu.be/UHI-3wiAy5c) and [The Kids Were Wrong](http://youtu.be/zs3xVfCG0Hg) are good nostalgic/wistful songs.

The Antlers' [Hospice](http://youtu.be/xSi_FE52TAY) is similar.
Hey. I've been using your browser for about half a year now and I've enjoyed the extra features you keep adding.

A little problem I have is if I listen to bandcamp songs and then close the tab, the music keeps playing in the background until I force close.
So nice. I'm almost afraid to listen to demos in case I want one
Tamora Pierce's Immortals series has a similar feel of adventure and discovering/training powers. Give the first book, Wild Magic, a go and see if you like it.
Your best bet is to read an existing guide like [sweet water's]( http://www.sweetwater.com/insync/guitar-pedal-buying-guide/) and look up demos on YouTube.
I hate that you sound like a jerk right now, but damn if this exact reaction didn't run through my head right now.
The ditto looper x2 allows uploading backing tracks to the pedal through usb and works decently well.
Try heavy usage of triads to make it sound almost like a rhythm part with walking thirds and fifths and licks in between. You can also try using a looper to play the rhythm part though this is hard to use without sounding repetitive.
I like it when they include the genre in a comment instead of the title. I like to try to guess the genre by the pedals and then check if I'm right
Fascinating. Your arguments have won is over and I agree that Beatle is the best. Good discussion!
You probably already played them, but i enjoyed getting the achievements for the Portal games and somewhat for HL2. There are easter eggs hidden away in corners that gave me the same feeling as looking for secrets/solutions in Fez.
Yeah this is a well known theory of music being a puzzle for our brains. I recommend reading or listening to the book This Is Your Brain On Music by Daniel Levitin if you want to go into depth. 
Don't worry man. I replaced my x4 with an el capistan and couldn't be happier. It's a completely different machine
Yes he did, a galaxy nexus
The effect is called an arpeggiator
Nope. I did it on wifi while he was on mobile internet.
Try the barber tone press. They recently upgraded it with extra controls and a smaller footprint for about $150. Or get the previous version used for much less. I had one for about half a year, but replaced it with a deep six because the tone press cut the high end too much for my tastes.
Try Psych. It's not animated,  but has that wacky feel and recurring jokes/tropes throughout the episodes. It's an easy show to watch as a group.
Yes. I don't know exactly how to set it up but my brother used it so I could login with my google account on his phone from my computer
Teamviewer lets you do this. It's not perfect, I've had trouble with opening the drawer and stutters in screen updates, but it's a decent, free solution
Don't buy the chameleon. The outlets are poorly isolated and make my compressor and overdrive hum. A google search shows other people have the same problem.
They can be setup for different tunings. One is for standard, another is in open g etc.
Here is a comprehensive guide to playing jazz

http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/jazz/
I've used a boss FV-500 with a Flashback x4 successfully
On proguitarshop.com you can get it for $136 with the code SAINT15. I ordered one yesterday so I have no other insights to offer
Thank you. If you want some deeper reading on music psychology, I enjoyed This Is Your Brain on Music. It talks about how our brains decode music and the evolutionary reasons for why we like music.
Music is pleasurable to us because it acts as a test for pattern recognition. I'd say Pop music is popular because it allows the greatest amount of people to decipher the song enough for it to be pleasurable, but different enough to give some challenge.

Rhythm is important because it the easiest and first part people latch on to. They try to figure out a pattern recognition to be able to predict how it will continue. If they are right they are rewarded with dopamine.

Lyrics are rarely abstract because It is easier to understand (not to mention write) for the majority of people. I know American culture is very focused on extroversion and relations between people which might explain why songs are about people or experiences. Lives are more defined by external battles rather than internal.

Pop music is also diverse because if each song was too similar it wouldn't provide enough of a challenge for the brain. That's why new sounds and experiments are always being made with new music even if they do follow some tropes. That's why Cher's "Believe" became so popular. It had the qualities of a regular pop song but included a new element of autotune that challenged previous conceptions of music in people.
Not if he used the gear to make a living. You need separate insurance for income-earning gear.
Neat. I'm a big fan of Walrus's Deep Six. It's the most transparent compressor I've ever used.
The voodoo pedal power 2 is the most popular, with reason. It has outputs that will power line 6 pedals and all your others. I have a Fuel Tank Chameleon too and agree that it's a waste of money. I have problems with hum because the ground is poorly isolated.
The DL4 uses 1200mA. The fuel tank only provides 300mA per output. You're going to need a separate power supply.

Does the ditto still work with another power supply?

Edit: try powering the ditto without the other pedals connected. The total power draw might be too much and you will need a bigger power brick.
The problem is it's ridiculously overpriced. As an overdrive it's already expensive, but what gets me is the circuit is just 5 components, one of the simplest designs ever. It's just not worth it, especially when compared to other transparent drives like the Timmy.
Things the Grandchildren Should Know by Mark Everett is by the frontman of The Eels.
Try out an Egnater Tweaker. It comes in 15 or 40 amp and has American, British, and Vox circuits. Has great clean sounds and takes pedals very well.
You need one of these

http://i.imgur.com/YNpg19I.jpg
http://bedroomproducersblog.com/ is a pretty good resource to find free/cheap VSTs.

I not sure if this will work with Logic but try moving the .vst files to Library/audio/vst.
Do you have a screen overlay app like lux or twilight enabled. Android sometimes disables allowing permissions while those are enabled to prevent apps tricking users into letting them do bad stuff
Pretty and neat. Is there a side view pic?
Maybe add an askguitar or discussion flair for threads like favorite ___ or for general questions

Edit. While I'm here, why is the header bottom still weird?
Also similar is the [Everything is a remix]( http://everythingisaremix.info/) series which goes beyond just sampling. I still rewatch it from time to time.
I can freshen up the design for the page. I have submitted a few features to /r/guitar like the upvote/downvote picks and flair pictures. You can see some of my ideas on /r/thisisjustforme and am happy to start working on some options for whatever is needed.
Those are ABY boxes.
Try [Hydrogen](hydrogen-music.org). It's open source and is available for Linux/windows/mac
Check out Nickel Creek. It's the band Chris Thile of Punch Brothers was originally part of.

My favorite album is This Side, but all three are great.
for last.fm just use Simple Last.fm scrobbler. It works with most players.
Linkme: Simple Last.fm Scrobbler.
The Desktop Konnekt is a very good interface that can be bought used for under $100. It uses FireWire 400 so it needs a FireWire 800 connector for a Mac, but it's very cheap

Everybody Knows by Leonard Cohen
The Flaming Lips. Start out with Soft Bulletin and Yoshimi.
Goodreads.com or librarything.com
1000 arms sound very similar to [Grandfather Clock]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP4L9thuW9o) by This Will Destroy You

Edit: it seems both bands had a collab album called Field Studies
Music123 is owned by the same company as Guitar Center and Musician's Friend, which means they have a pretty good return policy. Try contacting customer support and complain until they agree to replace it.
It's a great pedal with lots of options. However it does sound a bit flat. I've bought an El Capistan to remedy this and it's replaced most of the delay settings, but I still have the x4 as a secondary delay and looping.

The toneprint editor is a nice idea, but I found myself spending too much time messing with settings rather than playing. If you don't mind these downsides, I say go for it.
Try finding a discogs app. Discography looks nice.

Linkme: Discography
Very cool stuff. Walrus makes awesome pedals, especially the Deep six, which is, so far, the best compressor I've tried.

They're also working on a reverb right now which I'm excited to see
The el Capistan also has this.
At least buy me dinner first, Timeline.
I bought a Mission Vm-pro recently. I really like it over the Boss Fv-500 that I had before; the fulcrum is more toward the back so fast swells are much faster and because of the buffer it doesn't cut out the high end like the Boss did. 
It is expensive though, even with the 15% off discount on Black Friday.
Linkme: Spaceteam.
This is needlessly complicated. Just wrap cables end to end and repeat until it's short enough then secure with a Velcro tie. Doesn't kink or tangle and you can throw it across the stage.
This sounds gorgeous. It reminds me of the bluesky shimmer effect.  
The dry loop is very interesting, and could give some incredible layered sounds. The only thing missing that I can see is stereo inputs/outputs.
Would you still like my stuff to add in? I gave the resources to Code347 but can send it again.
Community? It's lighthearted and has jerk characters with redeeming qualities.
I made some stuff like new vote arrows and flair (can be seen on /r/thisisjustforme ) but the mods never implemented it, even though they said they liked it.
I think they were just hosted by those subreddits, but anyone could sign up. I think this giveaway should stay inside patientgamers to stay more to its philosophy instead of many people signing up in hopes of receiving the latest games
I personally like [antennapod]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.danoeh.antennapod)
Greensleeves is a great fingerstyle song. I especially like the version in the second part of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6NxYRQL9SQ)
[Bearfoot Honey Bee/Beest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axYZmqvvGiU). I've been wanting one for a while, but as beautiful as it sounds, it is a bit expensive.  

Also see the Timmy Drive, JHS Morning Glory, and if you want something grittier, the Walrus Voyager.  
I would recommend the EM-Drive but it is horribly overpriced for the minimal circuitry it has.
[Floppy drive music?]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHJOz_y9rZE&feature=youtube_gdata_player)
GOG still has the advantage of having "Good Old Games." The Humble Store, so far, is focused on more recent indie games.
Greensleeves/What child is this is a very fun fingerstyle song

[This](http://www.thegearpage.net/board/archive/index.php/t-834299.html) outlines pros and cons of several volume pedals though I think he overstates the amounts of tone suck.
Very nice. Looking forward to that soundclip

The one big image would be best, since each separate image requires a separate request (which is usually the reason for slow load times on sites)

Hmm. Mine is slower, especially when switching between apps
Wow. I didn't know that. Seems a bit douchy on their part.
If you want to support small sellers or want boutique pedals, prymaxevintage.com has a 15% off sale too with the code GEAR15
I have the 380 Pros and I agree. But I did need to [mod it]( http://www.head-fi.org/t/406187/modding-the-sennheiser-pc350-headset) because the bass response was lousy out of the box.
Prymaxe Vintage has a 15% off sale right now. It only sells new stuff but it's great for harder to find pedals.
If you're not opposed to foreign films, try The Mystery of Third Planet. It's a soviet film about exploring space with weird creatures, and nice story suited for children
I agree. I played HL for the first time this summer, after playing through HL2 multiple times. It was just underwhelming, and I had to force myself to finish it in the end.
Vertigo is caused by displaced calcium crystals, so hair regrowth would not help
Or *gratis* and *libre*, respectively.
Which is why I said "charge the most." I should have probably stuck an "and" in between the two to make it clearer.
This Will Destroy You and Do Make Say Think are also good
Maybe try Nickel Creek. They use mandolin in most of their songs and sometimes banjo.
Crusader Kings 2 is all about strategy. The military is just a means instead of an end. Takes a few hours to learn though, so I recommend watching some YouTube tutorials first
Economics. Companies charge the most they can at which the greatest number of people will buy the product.

To keep it simple, x86 is the same as 32-bit.  
You can run either 64 or 32-bit software on 64-bit computers (but only 32-bit on 32-bit computers)  
64-bit versions of software allows for more RAM to be used by the program.

VSTs have to be the same as the DAW that you're using, but you can use utilities like jbridge to be use incompatible VSTs
The guy at Prymaxe Vintage makes great demo videos.

His demo of the Bearfoot Honey Bee has me aching to buy one but I can't justify spending $200 on an overdrive. Someday though.

I have the DR-500MCE. I say the only thing great about it is the neck pickup. Everything else is mediocre. The piezo sounds terrible and the guitar itself is very boomy.  
 I've had an Alvarez acoustic-electric before that someone broke and I regret not buying another instead of the Epiphone.
People can save money until they have enough to buy one.
OK. I see what you are trying to tell me now. I was just using the economics definition of a luxury good to explain that iPhones don't need to be rare to be a luxury item.  
Unfortunately macroeconomics don't always translate to micro situations well because of instances like you're describing.
That is just opportunity cost. Something is always given up to buy a something else. In these cases it's just more extreme
If they bought it, they could afford it.
If a luxury item is common it just means that income levels are high enough that demand for the luxury product is also high.

Can't go wrong with a Strymon El Capistan. One of the best dTape pedals around and you can control many settings including flutter, which is what I think you are wanting.
No, this way doesn't tangle up the cables either. I always toss cables too.
I just fold cables end to end. No thought required and no twisting. I also use velcro ties that attach to the cable so it doesn't get lost.
Heh. I'm picking up the same tele, color and all, this Saturday at a local shop. Can't wait.

If you're rooted you can try installing the [xposed framework]( http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1574401) and the [app settings module]( http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2072081).

Then you can change the font scale on any app that you like without giving up features that you like.
I didn't have this problem because I spent a lot of time just sitting back and listening to the music. To each his own, I guess.
You are a horrible person. Is no one else outraged by this senseless violence. I mean, things could have turned out badly. Injuries could have been inflicted. For goodness sake, what did that poor telecaster ever do to you!!?

True bypass vs buffered.

Any internal trim pots/switches?

Shortlist of which artists use it
One reason is that they define the types of chords. The basic chord is 1-3-5 notes in a scale. In different modes they give us major, minor, diminished, and augmented chords.
I carry a notepad with me at all time and jot down any ideas that I hear or come up with. Sometimes it's a story, or might be a phrase/word I would like to use.
I like it. The ending caught me off guard and made me laugh a bit.
What discount code?
I believe the updated version (stereo input version) of the El Capistan has non latching switches.
FYI there is already /r/MusicInTheMaking
Get a Hohner Special 20.

I like it. It sounds very much like Poe, especially because you use the same rhyming scheme as *The Raven*.

I would change "Nothing but stones..." to "Naught but stones..." so that the meter isn't broken.
Quadruple entendres are obscure references to British naval history
Why not? If that's the sound they are looking for, let them do it.

This app allows setting the DPI for specific apps using the Xposed framework. I've been using it for months now without any problems except that I have to reinstall the framework every time after clearing the cache in recovery (this is simple enough with the installer/updater app for the framework).

You can also disallow permission for app, though I've found it breaks some apps.

Oh thanks. I liked this pedal, but the price pushed me away.
Looks like I know my next project!
I am trying to find a new pedal to replace my OCD. I agree that it's a great and versatile pedal, but only for lead.

I do not like it on my rhythm parts at all. Thanks for the suggestion though
These are great! I'm liking the Timmy and the Morning Glory.

I don't really need a boost because I want my leads to blend in instead of standing out, but thanks for the suggestion

Hot diggity, that was fun and that tele is gorgeous.
I recently bought a 72 deluxe in a beautiful walnut finish. It is a fantastic guitar and feels much better than my american strat (though that may be because I need to get it professionally setup). The buckers are good, but nothing special, so you may want to upgrade those down the line.

My only real complaint is that the neck is not wide enough; I need to be precise with my fingering but consistently mute the strings or play the ones I don't mean to.

But it's such a great guitar, I work around it.

That Tele is gorgeous. What make is it? It doesn't look like a fender logo.
So do I, but the screen still gets scratched by sand particles
Because most scratches come from being carried around in a pocket, not being dropped.
Yeah I have one input

The tap-a-delay logo looks like the planet express logo on first glance.

Also nice setup

Agreed. Powers of Ten is one of my favorite albums and Gray Pianos Flying is just a masterpiece of a song.

No it's private. Dropbox also encrypts files if you're worried about security.
I can't help you recover the lost photos, but you should install either Google+ or Dropbox and setup instant upload so your photos are automatically backed up online
Can't speak for the Hall of Fame specifically, but TC makes some fantastic hardware with great build quality.

They are way ahead in digital effects with ideas like toneprints and the polytune. One of my favorite manufacturers.
No
For me it's the opposite. I feel that standard dreadnoughts are boring and not as useful as a sexy, sexy cutaway. I sometimes just sit there and stroke the luscious curve.
Great job, Santas.

What exactly are you having trouble with? I tabbed out Airtap a while ago if you want:

The most important parts for me were to keep a steady rhythm, learning to hit harmonics accurately, and one handed picking.

You can also sign up for a jamplay.com trial and watch Mongrain's video lessons on his techniques. It has some really good stuff on there.
Have the x4 and agree with all your points. So much fun to mess around with. The looper is a great added bonus.
Dammit how many times do we have to go over this.

"Stock" means the ROM the phone originally shipped with.

AOSP/vanilla means an unmodified AOSP ROM

I believe I saw in recent thread that it's called Travis picking

I think it's just a lower gain input to use if your guitar has pickups with a high gain. The "-6 db" means it is 6 decibels quieter than the first input.
I just got a Flashback X4 (today!) and though I can't compare it to other delay pedals because it's my first, I'm loving all the customizations available. You can even load more profiles from TC Electronics' site with your computer or a phone (this feature is really neat. It's called toneprint if you want to check it out.)
Led Zeppelin - Stairway to Heaven, Over The Hills and Far Away  
Bon Jovi - Living in a Prayer  
Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here

Play with headphones, nice ones if possible, to enjoy what I think is the best part of the game and my favorite game soundtrack of all time.
This has been submitted how many times already?

Also, you have posted this before.

Harmonics tapping and one handed picking. Look into Erik Mongrain for this.
You forgot the [rant] tag.

Anyway, you answered your own question. Flash is becoming more irrelevant. I and many other users never use it and don't have a need to.

Also, you can just sideload the apk. It still works even if it's not available on the play store.

Have a Brother MFC 8440 from 2005, still works great 7 years later. 
I would like to take this moment to remember /u/SL61 as he was found to have no life since receiving a few well meant packages from /u/vanillacustard.

I think a long press of the mic would be just as useful and less cluttered.
My favorite Superbrothers song along with [The Prettiest Remix]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=do6Y07jq9u4&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player). Made chills run up my spine every time I defeated a trigon.
Yes, but that's not minimalist to me

Enqueue is 28MB compared to iTunes' ~200MB, uses fewer system resources, and fills my needs without having to spend time tweaking it.
It's bloat if we don't use it. If you use those features, keep on using iTunes, by all means.

I personally use Enqueue because it is simple, music only, and supports flac and ogg.
I just got a refurbished pair of HD-380 pros for $90. They have a removable cord and are like new.
Not really. I barely remember my first guitar. I broke my Alvarez, but the thing I miss are the sweet long-sounding harmonics. And I want to sell my Strat.

I'm just not a very sentimental person.
Agreed. I have an Epiphone DR500MCE which is a beut, cost around $550 but you could probably find a comparable acoustic instead of an acoustic-electric for less.

I also had an Alvarez artist series which was perfect for me as a beginner (and I still miss).
I use and buy FLAC for easy conversions. Most stores sell mp3 files at 320bps which is the standard highest quality mp3 file. I prefer to use V0 files which have a variable bitrate meaning the conversion software changes the bits per second as needed throughout the file instead of having a constant rate. This means that files are smaller without any discernible loss of quality.

I also convert to a lower quality V2 mp3 for my mp3 player which has only 4GB.

Long story short, if you're happy just buying mp3 files and don't have problems storing them you shouldn't worry about it
You could use solid explorer to transfer the photos from Dropbox. Much easier than the official app.
I jumped ship about 2 years ago. The reason, ironically is that I needed for my phone to "just work." I use Google's ecosystem of Gmail, Docs, Maps, and voice and Android just has better support. Over the past two years Google also introduced Play music, Movies, and Books which work great and, (dare I say this on r/apple), work better than anything Apple has to compete.

Also, android looks gorgeous since 4.0 when compared to iOS.
Glad you're enjoying it so much

You have to wait three days first.
Piracy. Mods should delete.
Right now, Machinarium and the beta for Superbrothers: Swords and Sworcery.

Disclaimer: I play these for the soundtracks
Here is a great exercise I am using to help explore different sounds: Play along to songs you like. Not to songs you have learned or have tabs of, but just jam along. Try to create harmonies, a backing riff, or a solo. Explore the composition of songs, how the different instruments and parts work together. You will find parts you like that can be used to start composing your own music.
Ugh. CNET writers are terrible.
Could you make it into a dual-joystick? Guerilla Bob style.
OK. I just played this game for 20 minutes. It is awesome, not just for a first game, but just awesome.

Some criticisms:

The controls need work. I barely ever jump because sliding from right/left to up doesn't work. I would also like to run backwards while shooting.

The menus are hard to read. The text is way to simplified and could use more pixels. Some image elements like the mute button are blurry. In the pause menu, clicking back unpauses the game instead of going up to the main menu.

Good stuff:

Love all the basic things eg. achievements, upgrades, bosses, character customization (maybe add more characters in future updates)

Aiming, headshots, great weapons. With regular damage it would be cool to have some knockback effects.

The extras like buildings and firepower support is great!

Hope this all helps. Keep it up!
I don't have extensive experience with it, but I heard lightworks is pretty good.

The workflow is different though, so it will take some learning.

Edit: Nevermind. Still no mac version available.
Galaxy s3. You can look at my flair to see that
I have ones made by Samsung that came with my phone and work great. My only gripe is the the buttons are ordered. As vol+, vol-, play/pause instead of vol+, play/puase, vol-.
Question: why is gapless playback so important?
Definitely the tablet version. On my s3 the regular version didn't even fill up my screen.
Have you tried aerovan's CM9 builds?
I used these when I still had my dinc2 and other than a few minor quirks, everything worked great.

Second. Their recent update makes the app nice to use and the mark as read gestures are handy.

Well, it was made for iPad and iPhone first.
YESSS! I was wanting Machinarium for android for a while, but Superbrothers is a complete surprise as the team said they had no plans for it.
Open /system/app/Wallet.apk and check that its permissions are rw-r-r
Everything except photosphere works on my d2vzw.

Edit: Updated to fixed version and everything works. Thanks guys!
For me it's not so much what their musical tastes are as it's how much of a musical taste they actually have. I enjoy listening, discovering, and playing music so much in my life that I come up to a person wondering what they like to listen to. I enjoy hearing their opinions on music.

If I talk to someone who says they only listen to pop (or more often in my area, country) I am more disappointed that they don't take music as seriously as I do, never going below the surface, rather than because of their preferences.
Incidentally, Macs don't have an iBooks app. They can only be read on iOS devices.
Why on earth would anyone want to convince other people, much less their friends, to torrent?
Verizon gives sim cards for free. Oh wait...
Could another reason for math anxiety being common is that it's hard to just wing it?

Math problems require comprehension, logic, and problem solving much more than writing and early science classes. Once pupils put a similar amount of effort into their math homework, they do poorly and assume that they are just bad at math, and begin to loathe math related activities.
That's wifi direct, not WiDi aka Wireless Display.
It's an alternative to Widi, which is Intel's solution.
Android 4.2 is introducing Miracast which is the android (and open standard) equivalent of Airplay. Hopefully some new apps/hardware are developed by the end of this year to take advantage of it and allow you to do exactly that.
Installs great on official CM10 nightly for Galaxy S3 (no need to flash manually)

Yes, that is how it works. It basically just runs some JavaScript on the page to get the login details and fill it in.

Bookmarklets are set to expire in two weeks since it's last used, so if you don't use them often you will have to set up a new one. I never had a problem using them multiple times.
I just use the bookmarklet and mobile site.
I also like the authenticator option to prevent unauthorized logins.
Running CM10, 4.1.2 I was able to delete Calendar 4.1.2 and Google Calendar Sync using Titanium Backup, but had to leave Calendar Storage. Otherwise the Play Store Calendar would crash on launch.

NFC can be used in all the ways passbook is used, and more.
