Well, guess you should have gotten a PC.
Yeah, I mean don't get me wrong I love tinkering in windows, I've built more systems than I can count. But it just gets annoying. Like I just did a fresh install to fix some registry bugs, and shit still gets funky for no reason. Tired of dealing with it.


I developed on a windows system for 4 years, and I'm 6 months into an Os x environment. It is nice.
I work on an imac for work, have two built PC's at home.

It's nice not having random errors, bugs, crashes, etc all the time for no good reason.

Plus as a developer, the ecosystem is more saturated than windows, and it's just easier to do shit.

Don't get me wrong, I love this display. It's fantastic. It just struggles hard on dark scenes, for example half the cut scenes in Shadow of War. The color banding is atrocious in dark scenes, and that sucks.

That's why I said it wouldn't be great for watching movies. Outside of that, it's great.
You don't really want this monitor for watching movies. It's a tn panel with terrible color reproduction.

Dark scenes are a hodgepodge of grey blobs. The only downside to these displays really.
And all of those phones are boring. You're point?
They look exactly the same as the S8's.

This kind of comment makes me feel good, because I always saw it as I'm garbage compared to actual programmers, because I decided to become real good at CSS & front end in general.

No, it's not. If this ISP owned ESPN, and was offering it to customers for free and with higher bandwidth priority (fast lane), then it would be discriminating against competing services.

If my local hotdog vendor offers to give me a free coke for buying a hotdog, it's not discriminating against Pepsi if I can still buy it.
Yeah I tried an app that did bubbles for like all messaging apps, was nowhere near as good
So they're giving you access to a paid service, ESPN, and I can only assume the Netflix bit is saying their provided speeds are up to a standard that Netflix says are optimal for streaming.

In the end, most terms that make it to advertisement is just marketing fluff.

"On February 13, 2017, the¬†Senate unanimously confirmed Shulkin as the U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs in a 100‚Äì0 vote,¬†making him the only cabinet nominee by President Trump to have unanimous consent"


Yeah, it happened in Trump's administration and he should bear some of the backlash, but you're just completely ignoring the perpetrator of what you're angry about. That's what I'm saying is stupid here.


>You sound like you enjoy being a victim.


Lol, you're argument skills would make you fit for the T_D crowd.
He was voted into his position. Everybody voted for him. But it's not his fault for his actions, or the fault of the people who approved him, it's only the fault of the person who nominated him?

Do you not see how this logical is just ignorant? Do you want to blame AIDS and cancer on Trump too? I don't like him either but this is just stupid.
Did anybody here read the actual article by politico, instead of this opinion piece? Unless Trump told him to do this, I don't see how the article can say it's his fault. This guy was unanimously voted in as secretary of the VA.

On another note, why is garbage bias media like shareblue still spammed here? We hate shit like brietbart, yet shill for this garbage on the other side of the coin.
They don't display cookie warnings because that want to seem like they care about your privacy.

The USB dongle is meant for power, not data transfer. There's no reason to upgrade it to 3.1/type c. Especially since there's no TVs on the market with type c connectors.

Probably just burglary.

For starters, asking for 4 different things in the title is a great way for it to not go anywhere. Address a single topic m8. Not 50.

And there's already a shit load of WH petitions on the topic, one of which has well over the required 100k signatures, maybe share that one.

And lastly, even if Trump responds to that petition in any sort of timely fashion, he can just respond by saying "I stand by the FCC chairman". In other words, he can just say no.

You don't seem do understand what the word "demonetize" means. If a video is demonetized, then no ads are going to appear on that video via YouTube's ad program. So neither YouTube nor the creator will make money off the video.

...why are half of these blocked out? What's the point? And there's a whole heap of software not on this list, so to claim "Every shorcut" seems overstated.

The trade-in price for the XL 128gb is $410. The asking price on ebay is around $480. Take out Ebay's fee, plus cost to ship, and you're pretty much at a wash. 

A straight trade-in is just less hassle. That's why people would do it.
Ah well I think I found our problem here compadre. Your comment states:

>Except T_D isn't a **debate** subreddit nor ever claimed to be a neutral subreddit? It says it right in the side bar, don't be a tool. However news, world news, politics, etc, remove posts and ban users who have differing viewpoints from the alt left?

Did you intent to type the word "Default"? Also, pull your head out of your ass, it's not a good look on anyone.
Touch√©
How does that relate to what you posted? You're throwing a fit about subreddits that ban people for no reason, then champion a sub that does the exact same thing. Do you not understand how that makes you look stupid?
> Every subreddit that isn't heavily censored or moderated is always fairly conservative because mods don't ban them or remove their posts.

I'm usually up pretty late, and it's just annoying to have the white menu in the dark. I can use a dark menu any time without issue. Idk, just a preference.

Google added the ability to have "themes" in Oreo, and even had the dark variant in the beta before disabling it. I just want the option to go bXk.
I could be wrong here, but a lot of this just looks like hyperbole to express how the story of the game pulled him in. That he isn't actually triggered to the point of debilitating nightmares, but just expressing that it was a good game, albeit in a weird way.

Again, I could be wrong, but I also don't go around calling everything a "snowflake" like an autistic 14 year old.
Wasn't aware of that. Makes me wonder why the person who made this specific theme didn't take that into account.
Planting anything essentially on the property line is just asking for trouble though. Especially in an HOA neighborhood.
I've got substram running now, but the theme I'm running (baltic) doesn't work well across the board. It changed a lot of backgrounds to black fine, but didn't change the font color. So I've got black text on black background in some instances.

It's apparent that the officers knew exactly who this person was, and where happy to see him arrested, for probably what they felt was harassment from the guy.

But at the same time, they knew this guy watched them, recorded them, everything, waiting for officers to slip up. And they STILL arrested him on a bullshit charge that they knew wouldn't stick. 

How can they have been so stupid?

But the other tweet isn't saying the opposite. The two tweets are talking about two different things, hence why there's two tweets. One is about pregame ratings, the other about game ratings.

The OP article used a bullshit click-bait title, but the info is still there if you look.
How does one cherry-pick a tweet, when they quoted the entire thing? If the single tweet can't provide proper context, then why was it even tweeted out.
Maybe from the tweet that was linked in the OP:

I've got two pairs of IE2's and I can wear them literally all day, and forget that they're in my ears. So guud.
The silicone earbuds that Bose uses are the most comfortable things in existence. Hands down. I lub dem.

Edit since this got a lot of updoots: If you need to replace your ear tips for bose headphones, don't buy the off-brands from Amazon. They're a completely different material and hard as a rock. Spend the extra and get legit bose replacements.

For wifi, the pixels have a feature that lets you shut off wifi antennas, and have them auto turn back on within range of a trusted WiFi network. 

And as far as theming, there was supposed to be a way to invert the top drop down, but I don't think that one actually came out with Oreo.
A lot of settings on the pixel didn't make it to the Nexus, including gestures, wifi controls, theming controls, some other stuff I can't think of off the top of my head. Took months to get the assistant, which was not as full fledged as it is on the pixel.

I kinda assumed it had to do with Bluetooth capabilities, but I could be wrong. I'm doomed when I lose my headphone jack.

Yeah, and the show interweaves the story's of the major marvel movies. After Winter Solider is where shit hits the fan.
The show gets better, but viewership started to slip I think.
> Just cause Floyd is a bad person doesn't make him a bad 

I said nothing of the sort, but that's all your comment implied.
Dude that whole fucking season was next level. And the way it was split into multiple parts felt like watching 3-4 seasons all at once.
Eh, I could never get into that one. Loved the actress and her character but didn't care for the show.
...what does this have to do with my comment? At all?
1 judge had Conor winning the first three rounds. The other two judges gave Conor a single round.
That doesn't create 404 issues. Plus IGN is bigger than a hug-of-death from reddit.
Shield was almost canceled for this garbage. After their best season yet.
So not only did this link 404, but IGN's 404 page is the worst thing in existence. Zero links back to the main page, and it taunts me by telling me to "Search" for what I'm looking for, without a search tool.

Da fuq.
Yeah Conor easily took the first 4 rounds, and yet every judge had every round to Floyd. Da fuq.
"Reed College"  

Huh, I guess I'll give this one a google.

"Located in Portland, OR"

Oh, well that makes sense.
Yeah I'm pretty skeptic on our season outlook, after our performance in the last two post seasons. With Hossa down, Toews really needs to pick it the fuck up.
Yeah, but Kane can really play with anybody, especially with Anisimov at center. But Toews kinda needs the pick-me-up that Sadd can hopefully provide.
I miss our loaf :'(
Fuck man, his head smacked on those bricks. Should probably swing by an ER to check for brain swelling. It be the silent killer.
Jebus, your accuracy with full auto is so good.
Well US Marines aren't going to be deployed to help control a protest or riot. The National Guard would be the next step after local law enforcement.
Downsampled to a stunning 180p
It's half dodge dart, so that's understandable.
> When they send in the ~~Marines~~ National Guard your point would make more sense.

FTFY
> Gotta be specific otherwise those generalisations are gonna make you look (dare I say the word) anti-semitic.

Yeah, it sure would be a shame if people thought us jew-hatin folk where "anti-semetic"!  
/s...
I'd gladly sell you my N9 for $150. It's a worthless piece of garbage. Only use I've gotten out of it in the last ~2 years was as a video player for long flights.
My boat trailer cradles my boat!

CHECK MATE ATHEISTS
Only if the ghillie suit is made out of cigarettes and cut up bud light cans.
Accurate.
y tho
Oh god people still play DayZ?
I hated Hillary. But I hated Trump more, so I had to vote for her. It was a rough election.
What in the effff. Get outta here with your David Blaine shit.  


No but really, I never would have thought of crawling through a wall lol
Oh boy did I try
srsly, im over here itching my everything now.
[I know your pain. I got stuck in a house in waterworld.](https://youtu.be/vdFzW2bI_9s) Turns out that just because you can get inside by climbing a downed tree, doesn't mean you should.

Also, none of the voices are mine, shadowplay was being dumb.
Well if we retaliate, NK will definitely fire missiles at live targets. And I don't think the US Military can guarantee that they can 100% stop those missiles. So for the US to retaliate, we have to accept the likelihood that a nuclear missile will detonate somewhere.
probably hooked the car battery up to the vape pen for max vape action, na'mean?

a'suhhhhhh
My man!
That's standard practice. Probably paid leave.
Yeah, I'd kill to see it in Imax but I just know somebody in that room of hundreds will hell or clap or do something stupid. And it only takes one to make others jump in. I want that shit dead quite, and pitch black.
I can just imagine all the people yelling and screaming at different scenes like it's a shitty horror movie. 

Naw.
NSFL tag for those tiny flags man. They had tiny flag family's, you know.
Pft, maybe for some people. I did the same lazy shit in College for 4 years made it out on time.

Just remember, C's get Degrees. (And the occasional D in math because calculus doesn't mater IRL)
Hackerman 2: The Hackering
So lost without this bit. Thx op
What's with the 8-man squad..?
I think a leaderboard would make more sense
To the Shadow Lands... Ermahgurd I wanna see Asshai now pls
But will he break the wheel?!
The war will definitely hit Kings Landing. The roof is coming off that throne room, per the visions from the House of the Undying. King's Landing will probably be decimated, leaving not much left to rule over. This would give us the bittersweet ending George has talked about.
Probably a mix of steel and dragon glass, tempered with the fire from a dragon.
I mean, if we start at the beginning, when he picked up the credentials he had to show ID. So either he just so happened to have a fake ID for the guy he was impersonating, or this is just fun BS marketing.
Like, at what point does it become easier to just hire a person fluent in English to do the voice over?
Fucking love how his native accent game out in the immediate post-fight interview, and the following interviews. You could barely understand a word coming out of his mouth.
Yeah that happens early on, when it's just swollen with pus. But after awhile it just hardens into scar tissue.
He either makes it outta the round for a quick break, or hits the mat. He just wanted the chance. He said he'd rather hit the mat then not have the chance.
Naw, he was on the but that didn't fall, not on the sea side. If he died they'd show it more
That's how Floyd fights. Have you ever seen a boxing match before..?
So glad there aren't large groups of roaming assholes  on motorcycles around me
I bet it accompanies a flashback that Bran goes back to see.
*Dragonstone* is so fucking good.
They probably just abandoned the email after the deposition, I would hope.
Yes, I understand this. I was being sarcastic.
How can people be intimidated by their skinny kid abs if they are wearing shirts..?
Having power to 4 wheels has literally nothing to do with how tire tread acts on water.
I identify yellow as the sun. Ya'll going to take the sun to court for trademark infringement?
No but clearly they hate statues of Confederate generals because they owned slaves. That's it. That's the only gripe. The ownership of slaves. Nothing else they did in their lives is relevant, clearly...

Edit: Adding the /s before I get burned for witchcraft. I won't float on water, so don't try it.
I think this would be pretty complicated, there's a  whole lot of factors in a "heal all" situation. The amount of health needed to fill, how many potions per pokemon, the best way to utilize the most out of each potion so you don't waste a whole potion on 2hp, etc. etc.
Man, the prosecuting attorney put their emails on public record. That sucks.
Pft, most of Tumblr is porn. The crazies are vast minority.
They actively throttle YouTube traffic. Sooooooooooo
Woo, Proprietary cook-top and Proprietary pans!

Also, his pronunciation of the word "crepe" is hilarious.
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  


-duh
If he doesn't kill himself in his cell first.
And so began the invasion of the Weeaboo's & Neckbeards.
Mashing more clothes into your washer gives them less room for agitation, so they don't get very clean.
Did this person get a sex change just so they could pull that card on people? She'd probably get a Negroplasty if she could and ask for some slave reparations.
...can't tell if troll...   

Just going to assume troll.
You're a fucking idiot.
Do... do you know what a pyramid scheme is..?
You would still be paying a social security tax. Taxes don't stop during a government shutdown.
> NFL style

That wasn't any sort of NFL style. That was just chest to chest wreckage.
They also hired some of the best attorney's they could. So that is another reason for the expense. But yeah, paying any attorney or law firm for over a year of work is going to be expensive.
This isn't the same thing. Actually, this looks like an artist mockup. But still, the stadium looks nothing like that, nor does it sit over a highway. And it's a lot closer to the mountains.
So, when's the Hearthstone movie coming out..?
He was recently on Tosh.0 as well
Over $900 and only 64gb? Really?
It's time for Ethan to attempt the record for world's longest [Yeah boiii](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvtQYsckLxk)
No, welcome to crazy extremists. Do you want me to call the right Nazi's? No, because that would be stupid.
Sounds like a nightmare.
> A lot of people don't like the Foo Fighters and have legitimate perspectives, it's a fact

Very true, nothing wrong with that. But you don't have to be a pretentious cunt in displaying your opinion. But hey, I guess I'm just over here being butthurt by words or something.
Sounds like the things from War of the Worlds
Hey now, wait a minute...

Something seems... off....


Them is some nice new glasses, Gus! They suit your face. Keep up teh memes!

Big in the music biz are ya? To know so many people with a rich knowledge of music and music history?
And then road maintenance crews come to repair the bridge, and knock all that shit down.
Man, Ozzy's voice is pretty rough.
Yet here you are
It's 1,000% real. No fake news here.
[Steve, send the phone spiders](https://youtu.be/zLaQnrJSp9g)
Was commenting on OP calling them Antifa when he has no idea who this person is. Other than an asshole. But this sub has a raging boner to call everything "antifa" so i guess that'll happen.
No, I don't follow boxing. And people aren't all gathered around in Vegas at a Multi-Million dollar fight to see Paulie hurl shitty insults. A majority of the people coming to see this fight are MMA fans, and don't give two shits about Paulie. He looks like a fucking idiot pulling this shit, like he's absolutely desperate for attention. I don't care how successful of a boxer he was, this is pathetic.
Who nobody cared about until he sparred with Connor.
"hey look, somebody using their constitutionally-granted right to protest. I bet they're just a bunch of antifa terrorists."

wat
Alt-Right was a term coined by people to call themselves, it wasn't started to be a negative connotation.
You have to add a "?" at the end of it. Then it sounds about right.
This guy riding his coattails hard.
Wait... Nazi's hate jews, and we hate Nazi's...   

Israel is basically a jewish population, but they hate israel...

Somebody's head is going to explode
My money is on flashback with bran, seeing the wedding. Ooooh boy. And maybe we'll see him leave for the battle of the Trident, putting on his Ruby studded armor.

Well now that my expectations are high, it's time to prepare for disappointment.
[Pretty sure this is a reference to this image from a shitty video.](https://i.reddituploads.com/12b944fea17842fa9fb6915c91bf3b8b?fit=max&h=1536&w=1536&s=cb0fab1c0a3a9094f135efaeb403b62f)
> weird campaign pep rallies

He is campaigning for reelection. I wish that was a joke.
All of the shit going on in the US right now, and he's still holding rallys...
They bitched enough to make Gary not want to deal with it anymore, and left Rust entirely. Helk is top honcho now.
people put themselves out there on American Idol, doesn't make them good.
So when is danny going to meet ghost..? I need dis
And he can sing show tunes.
I feel like with smart TVs, there's less and less of a market for a Google tv product. Especially with Chromecast.
Don't remember. I wanna say it happened in a vision in qarth.
and made a garbage edit on top of that
This isn't even an article. It's a blog post. From an unknown source that could barely install a wordpress theme.


Because this is 100% just some guy's blog. Hell, it's probably OP's blog, trying to rake in click traffic for ad revenue.
# #ESPORTSREADY
My best? My best what? What did I blow exactly?
Had the same damn thought.
Aaaaaand this sketch was 100% on point.
The cost went up when he wasn't pumping gas. Seems like an overcharge to me.
> Holding an active gas nozzle upright keeps gas pooled near the sensor.

The resting position of the nozzle is an upright position...  


> Maybe you don't believe that. Maybe you prefer to think there's a government conspiracy.

Where the fuck did this hostility come from..? And assumptions?

>I say put the damned nozzle back in place like we all do and check your receipts if you suspect fraud.

Well, he did that in the video. GG.

>Godddamn.


Bro, chill.
Lol when did I claim to care about anything here?

You're so fucking defensive, that anybody commenting at you is clearly some sort of enemy in your mind. Don't worry, I'm sure you can find some sort of safe-space echo chamber somewhere.
You're statement was to fucking stupid to write a better reply.
> The fact that you lost to Donald Trump tells me you fucked up bad.

Weird, I don't recall personally running for the office of President. Thanks for reminding me.
It's kinda hard to fuck off from the actions of the Commander in Chief.
