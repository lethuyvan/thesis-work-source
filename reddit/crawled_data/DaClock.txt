Beautiful.
okay
**1st time** ~~watching~~ **finished**

This show, man. 

It throws you a premise involving inequality, unlimited power, and the hope of a better future. 

From the start, it was Lelouch's goal in making the world into a better place, all for his sister. The way in which he got it, however, was the ultimate sacrifice. 

Throughout the entire series, it looks as if he was trying to obtain complete authority, whether it be from the royal family, or the world as a whole. And that's why this finale is so shocking: who wouldn't want to rule with an iron fist if they had the chance? 

But seeing his history, the relationships he developed, and his true ambition throws that thought right out the window.

"..now the only thing that remains is to get rid of [Lelouch] and finally break the cycle of hatred." Using him as the scapegoat, society can finally progress from its malicious incarnation.

I have to say, this has to be hands down one of the best series I've ever watched. It holds a special place in my heart from being the 2nd anime ever recommend to me.
üòÇ

Now it's stuck in *my* head again.
[Oh, Tom.](https://youtu.be/l69Vi5IDc0g)
Most Vista PCs are just XP machines flashed with the newer OS. Therefore, the PC has underpowered specs. For a game that isn't graphically intense, however, I think Mania should run fine.

**MINIMUM SPECS** (found on steam page):

OS:¬†Windows 7 / 8 / 10 (officially)

Processor:¬†Core 2 Duo

Memory:¬†2 GB RAM (very important)

Graphics:¬†DirectX 9.0c compliant video card 256MB

DirectX:¬†Version 9.0c

Storage:¬†400 MB available space

Sound Card:¬†DirectX 9.0c Compatible

**You can check your PC's specs by:**

featuring **Garfield¬©** from the *Garfield & Friends‚Ñ¢* Series
**1st time, dub.**

Having started this series two years ago, I find it amazing at how Lelouch developed as a character. Some things never changed, such as his quick thinking and chess analogies. Others, such as his decisions, wouldn't have been made possible if he never received his powers. 

That's why it seems paradoxical when he says to C.C. that he's made his decisions by himself all along. If he'd never met her, Lelouch's destiny wouldn't have made nearly as large of an impact to society as he did. 

And then there's Nunnally. Despite everything, Lelouch has always wanted to create a better world for his sister. This was always his main objective, and Geass has helped lead towards there, one step at a time. 

This show has always kept the stakes high. That probably has to do with the many types of organizations the characters fit into. Royalty, the Elevens, and loyal citizens: three groups commonly seen interacting with each other. Yet, on the outside, you never know when you'll meet a Black Knight in public, or a royal member ostrichsized by their family.

I'm pretty much rambling over the show at this point, but for the episode as a whole, it was phenomenal. One of the best song choices used, tight fighting, and it leading to an exciting conclusion.

**[Boy was I wrong.](https://youtu.be/huHY5ViHRYw)**
New person here.

This is the third or forth anime I've watched. It's definitely one of the most "out there" concepts I've seen. 

The beginning wasn't too crazy: just two kids, one wearing a blue sweatshirt, another with lips that puts Adam Ellis to shame. All looks normal until a crazed motorist smashes the living hell out of blue dude.

The animation varies a lot: it can go from being blamed to going batshit crazy in an instant. 

Honestly, I got lost once our protagonist in blue talked to everyone at the dinner table, shouting all at once (the hell is a Fooley Cooley anyways?). 

The ending went by quickly for me: all this talk about robots and dimensions and about that iron shaped factory up on the hill. üòµ

Overall, an experience I've never seen before. Again, I'm very me to this anime stuff, so I'll see whether I'll watch this until the end.

Yeah, it has been a while since V2. I've been using BlackPlayer EX in the meantime. Too bad it doesn't support double/triple clicks when using earbuds.
I loved Poweramp. It was a music player with a multitude of features, like tag editing, gesture controls, and customization options. If only Oreo 8.1 didn't break the notification, it would be perfect for me.

Max has done an immense amount of work over the past two years, and it shows. Hopefully, the app will be as feature rich as before, all inside a revamped UI.

(P.S., doesn't Poweramp look similar to Android P?)

3) Sometimes I wish my Pixel can reenable WiFi when it comes in close proximity with a saved network.

Also, the length in which notifications can be snoozed should be expand upon. 15 minutes can be long if I just want to dismiss a notification quickly.

One more thing: the notification shade should have a toggle to enable the dark theme. I don't want to have a black background as my home screen forever.

5) Always on ambient display: I always worry about my battery life, so I'd kept the option for it to display for notifications only.

Correct answer:

[Cherimoya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherimoya)

It tastes like a papaya-pineapple blend but it's ***so sweet***
what is this?
Dude,

I've been in a similar situation with a girl I'd grown to like who only saw me as a friend. She even has her own girlfriend. But that shouldn't keep you from being happy. 

People grow up and make their own decisions in life. Not everyone will agree on it, but we must respect their decisions. You can't change a person's mind once it's been set.

There's nothing wrong with you remaining friends with her. However, continuing to dwell around "what could've been" is not only counterproductive, but unhealthy. Hell, it took me a year to realize that my friend has much of a right to make her decision as much as I did. Once I realized this, I moved on. 

Will anyone ever replace the same feelings as I once had for her? Probably not. But you shouldn't let that discourage you. We're young; we've got ourselves the rest of our lives to find "the one."

Don't sweat it.

[Gun laws has been a sensitive topic](https://gun-control.procon.org) since Columbine. There have been many protests regarding the implications of strict gun laws, enforcing thorough background checks, and more. However, the argument that others bring is that the 2nd Amendment reserves the right to bear arms, which includes hunting with rifles and self-defense using guns. Not all guns kill people, yet, numerous people are killed with these weapons.

One can argue that since times have changed, it's time to amend the Constitution. However, this is nearly impossible thanks to the involvement of special interest groups in the government: most notably, the NRA. [Politicians who receive donation from the group's PAC](https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/recips.php?id=d000000082) typically reject gun control laws.

The Founding Fathers, while earnest in their intentions when writing the Constitution, [hadn't always intended to make it permanent.](http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch2s23.html) However, the document was written as a more effective set of rules to govern the people after the failed Articles of Confederation. Not everything they wanted done with this new government was written in, so they opted on an ["elastic clause,"](https://legaldictionary.net/elastic-clause/) which could allow the Constitution to be interpreted as needed in Congress.

There are points to be made in both sides over the debate of guns. While the problem may not be solved today (especially in this escalated political climate), one can remain optimistic that we, the people of America, can reach an all-inclusive conclusion before any more kids are shot.

I wanted to post a video about [our president](https://youtu.be/wdtpPCBL1Qg), but then I realized that's just adding more fuel to the fire.
Maybe a weekly current events megathread should be set up?

It sucks that recent events fueled tensions between groups of people, but there has to be a way to constructively debate on these issues.

Debates are fine, but we shouldn't outright ignore them.
Let the war commence!

It's true that Android devices can lag when there isn't enough free RAM available. However, the reason being for this is due to either the device (how much RAM it came with) or the apps running on it (e.g., Facebook). 

While a device using most of its RAM may seem concerning, it's how that memory is being used. You won't notice a performance hit if several apps are up & running. However, if one app draws more RAM from the amount available, then you'll start seeing lag, since other apps can't utilize that memory.

Free RAM isn't inherently bad, either. It means there aren't any apps that are utilizing it at the moment. When more apps are opened, they will take up more RAM.

If Android requires more RAM, it will close apps that remain dormant in the background (such as in your recent apps list). For example, opening up YouTube right now may close Gmail that was open a few hours ago. Of course, necessary processes aren't killed (such as Gmail Sync) which runs separately in the background.

The reason why task killers are not needed is that they force close apps in exchange for freeing more RAM. The problem comes when you try opening the app again‚Äîit takes more time and consumes more energy to reopen a (force closed) app than it would to launch an app that was previously in use. 

Hope this post dispels any misunderstandings with how Android RAM management.

When it was my brother's birthday, we bought him a cake with one of those candles that plays the birthday song. It was a special occasion, and the party was really heating up, so at first we didn't hear the sound coming from the candle.

Unfortunately, it was one of those candles with no "OFF" button, and by the time I noticed, I was already in bed when the sound kept playing. At this point, I had a splitting headache.

The song just kept playing over and over. It was like a car alarm that no one has the key to. When I woke up, I begrudgingly walked to where the candle rested, opened up the capsule, and cut the wires attached to the battery.

All I had to do was to cut the damn wires.

I'd buy some small purchases from indie and not-so-indie developers (Cave Story, Rocket League, Rayman Legends, Puyo Puyo Tetris, etc...)

Story time...

1 year after the Wii launched, my brother and I thought it was finally time to dive into the world of video games. It was December, and we started leaving subtle hints as to what we wanted for Christmas for our parents (leaving a store catalog with the Wii circled, setting nintendo.com as our computer's homepage, etc.) 

It was Christmas, and it seemed as if our prayers were heard. Our dad was ready with the camcorder, and we opened the longest box there was under the tree. 

Moment of truth. We open it, and...

It was a freaking [Intec Interact](https://youtu.be/K0-NdIcjmCE)! 

It wasn't their fault for being tricked. After all, they had good intentions. But god damn I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed.

A year later, they made it up by buying us a PS2, and I couldn't be happier playing Spiderman: Web of Shadows than a lawn mowing game.

What better way of showing a dysfunctional family by doing a Jerry Springer skit?

Anyways, there were four group members; one was going to be Jerry, one was Jeanette, and the other two were her parents. Things were working out until we realized we had 3 guys and 1 girl in our group, and everyone had their role already, so...

I was Jeanette's mom.

When has it gone to the point where a person's beliefs cause others to automatically hate them?  I'm no conservative, but even I can understand that the majority's opinion is just that: by the majority. There will always be a smaller minority (e.g., liberal extremists, anti-Trump conservatives) who do not abide by the same opinions. 

I have friends that are Trump supporters, but that doesn't mean I hated *them* after his inauguration. Not everything should be interpreted as a personal attack.

If people in your area are used to iPhones, they'll keep purchasing iPhones because they just work. There's nothing wrong with that.

However, with any group of people, you have people that go to extremes who will denounce anyone who differs from tradition.
