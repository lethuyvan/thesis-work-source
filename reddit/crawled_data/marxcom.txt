“Markets” not specifically after market router market. Even on that front Apple doesn’t have an advantage. Though I wish they continued there. 
I’m buying a mi box. Take my money 💰 
Why would you want nougat when Oreo is out with better features and security patches 
The competition has caught up and Apple is feeling the tension on every front. Markets that were previously dominated and monopolized by Apple are now challenged with many new comers who are way more innovative. 
Sure, they would deliberately walk left to right and again across it. And lie right on top no matter what you are doing. 😂
Why are cats obsessed with keyboards? I just don’t get it. 
Yup. Just what I did.
😂😂.
That didn’t help. I had reset the watch. Solved 🤦‍♂️!
Apple controls everything Siri and does. It’s functionalities are very limited. 
This is why I’m not surprised Bixby is surpassing Siri now. Apple has lost control of Siri.
Remind me again, please. How many days money-back guaranteed?
Granted. But overall developers need to figure out better text input method on thes oses. Samsung Tizen has pretty nifty solution that guesses the next three possible letters right on the current key. I was impressed when I used it. Not the best tho. 
Siri?! Seriously? Please don’t get me started. It’s the worst assistant for simple task like that. I’ll have multiple tries to achieve something that easy. 

Me: Hey Siri abc. 

Siri: eh bee see.
Many thought Apple was going android. I really wished they improved on that concept tho. 
First, not everyone buying these has an Android phone.  Second, you shouldn’t depend on a third-party solution to common things. It’s very agreeable that Android Tv and the very lazy processor (that is being overrated) on the Sony Bravia line don’t provide and great user experience. Even with X1 extreme (which is very great for image processing) you are left wanting and frustrated with your tv. 

I really like to see they have in TV Oreo. But we have till 2021 or never to get that update. Sadly, even people buying 2018 Android tv are stuck with Nougat while Oreo has been out with new security features and patches for a year now. With all these, my next tv will be a Samsung or LG. 

And btw all the noise about poor image quality (blooming, greyish black, blah blah) on products other than Sony is just talk gimmicks for the geeks. 

Don’t take my word for it. Get your own user experience. You can see I’m just one pissed off, butt hurt Sony customer. 😂😂
Some of those reviews you mentioned might have been mine also and you are right. Don’t get me wrong, the Android Os overall is flexible and can allow a lot of customization and usage. 

But on the tv like me x930E, it’s very sluggish. I don’t feel comfortable messing with system apps just to get my tv to be faster and trust I’ve tried all the recommendations online. Nothing works. It’s an is problem. Moreover, it’s very unintuitive compared to lg webos and Samsung tizen on the tv. The over design is boring. It lags and crashes. O That’s true. Sometimes you get frustrated by the latency with the supplied remote. Even worst is text input. 

But after, several months, I’ve learned to live with it. Connected some good set-top boxes to avoid using the tv os and only use the great hardware as a monitor: buy a powerful android tv box and an Apple TV 4K. You will realize that the Apple TV Os has a better user interface and experience and is constantly updated and give access to premium contents. Great UX too. I won’t bring on the Nvidia Shield argument: it’s a personal preference thing. But text input on the Apple TV is worst with the iPhone assist which makes it easy. 
Wrong!

Nvidia shield 16gb and remote = $179. Pro version is $299.

Apple TV 4K 32gb range from $149 to $179. 

64gb Apple TV 4K is $199.

Look it up. 
Especially now with the death of net neutrality.
Cable and satellite companies are on hot lava. People are done being ripped off. 
Too many device resets.
It think it depends on the device you are casting from, what you intend to cast, and the source (what app you want to cast from). 

Maybe I’m not getting what you want to do.
Chromecast.
Backward thinking much? Or should I say backward writing 😂
Very disrespectful to hang up on this person.
You must have flipped the order.
Product Red. White TouchID? Get out of here.
Awesome 
-AirPods. 

-MacBook if you can. 
Apple: letting a call ring endlessly is disrespectful to the caller. 

Me: my iPhone is more than a calling machine. A call just interrupted me and I lost a client. Calls, like messages are nothing but notifications that you need to respond to something or someone.
Do we blame google or oems and developers for the slow pace of android adoption?

I’m not a software geek but I like to know why it’s so hard to implement android versions. For example, why would a developer or manufacturer be implementing android 6/7 now when 8 has been out for a year. 

It’s like making a window vista can only computer in 2018.
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
So in your words not anti-consumer but retarded.
Do you have to swipe to view the clock? No. Why can’t we do same for weather?

Factor in gloves etc. 
Like how much power does raise to wake consume on iPhone. 
I miss jailbreaking 😭😭
How many swipe and clicks are there just to view a thing as simple as weather? Until, 11.3 weather widget wasn’t auto updating. Still doesn’t at times. 
Not everyone should go to college.
Could be faulty hardware. iPhone or earphones; either or both. 

Btw Bluetooth is a dead technology. Has never been perfect.
I live in a region where knowing the weather is just as important as knowing the time especially when going outdoors. It’s a bipolar weather region. A quick glance to know the forecast or current temperature is very good. Android has had this forever. 
Can this be merged into iMessages app. I don’t think Apple will introduce a stand-alone app just the sake of RCS support. But would be a great added features to iMessage. 
It looks very much like it. 
Wow. You must be an artist. 😂
Seriously, if apple is very true to being brave at removing deprecative tech and design as they did with the headphones jack, they should start by removing decade old designs from their softwares. 

iOS has has this annoying volume HUD forever. The icon layout makes it unique but still needs some overhaul. 

Having to swipe and click several time just to look at the weather is also annoying. I could go on. 
iOS 10 was my favorite. Still is. Wish I can roll back. 
Let send this post to Craig F. @ Apple.
There are tons of new UI and security features that are missing in 6&7. And won’t it be nice to have Oreo on on our tv before P comes out in few weeks?
The NShield is way too expensive in the configuration I would like. I’ll shop other options or just stick to Apple TV 4K and Xbox one S. 
I had few about medical benefits. Told them that I had preexisting conditions. 
Mac portable? 🤷‍♂️
Anyone using TV Oreo yet?
IP7+ Poorer battery life. iMessage bug still persists. 
It works perfectly well. The physical quality is poor. Mine broke in no time. 
Apple should allow users to downgrade to iOS 10. It was by far the most stable. iOS 11 is too buggy. I never liked the new control center UI.
Selfie on iPad also has more light and is brighter. It’s does lose some details tho due to lesser pixels. 
That’s what I thought too. But each time I made FaceTime calls on my phone and iPad the difference stands out immediately. I guess it’s because the iPad screen is larger and brighter thus emitting more light on the subject. Even my friends say the same about their iPad FaceTime calls. 
Why are we bragging about nougat when P betas are out. I haven’t seen any tv with Oreo just yet.

Very great article. Next former CNET Brian Tong and Techno Buffalo Jonathan Reintger. 

Brain and CNET bashed the Apple Watch. Techno Buffalo had poisoned opinions on the iPhone X (later retracted in a video). 

I’m waiting for consumer reports to retract false HomePod verdict.

Hey
Welcome dearest sir. 👮‍♂️
Is opera vpn safe?
Don’t buy any hardware that promises features through future updates. 2017 Sony customers were screwed into believing that they will get Dolby vision but took full years to their disappointment. I’m stuck with a 930e: no Dolby Vision, no android tv Oreo. It’s sluggish and slow. Hardware is great tho. 
Ah google and their many trying-to-figure-it-out apps.
Google is killing off uncertified hardwares. Check the define info. Most gapps will not work. 
IKR. And that’s why I want it removed cuz it’s not covert. FB was never cover till today. 
It should be removed for FB messenger too.
Installing an alternate ROM in most cases voids your warranty. 
Good summary 
So much for openness and support. I just hooked up an Apple TV 4K and I’m good. Native Dolby vision, HDR10 and more. 
MoF, food joke and all, I am 😂😂😂
It’s not only about apps. Android O doesn’t only introduce new features but it entirely overhauls and optimizes the TvOS platform. The current os version is laggy and sluggish. Moreover, Oreo brings tons of security patches that all users need.
I faced the same dilemma when picking my tv two months ago. I was a little constrained on budget tho. I wanted a tv that I won’t replacing in two years due to image retention or burn-in. I do watch a lot sports, news and play video games. These are mostly not good for oleds over extended periods of time. I also wanted something with a little bit of feature proofing. I ditched the x900e due to the lack of Dolby Vision support. I could not afford the 75” 940e. I got the 65” 930e instead. I never had any Samsung as an option. I would only do a qled from Samsung but they are way overpriced at 65”. The thing with android tv and me is a love hate relationship kind of thing.
I’ll try that and see. For now, I have an Apple TV 4K hooked up. 
Anyone know of custom rom for Sony TVs. PS4 apu for example?
I really wish I could install the ps4 apu or just something better than the slow sluggish and damn laggy android tv os.
