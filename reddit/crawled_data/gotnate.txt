So there is. Funny how that is the _only_ menubar option that isn't also replicated by a button in the UI.
I'm not seeing anything that's any better than the MAS version, but i'll keep my eyes out for any reason that this was worth the upgrade. So far first impressions are 1) round icon instead of square, 2) it started me with a clean slate rather than importing all my settings from the previous version (which did the same thing by abandoning the version before that) 3) Remote PCs now have fancy thumbnails and 4) user account management has a terrible interface where saved credentials are no longer tied to the remote PC.
I'm happy to hear that this feature is in the upcoming version! This doesn't quite sound like my GPS issue, as I always have my phone in my pocket, but the situation doesn't surprise me since apple is reserving the good stuff in the name of battery life on the watch.

Thanks again for the great app, and I'm looking forward to the update teased today! :)
I've upgraded to first class on Alaska a couple times for just $50 at the gate.
> 44 domestic gates and 2 international gates

that's far too large of an airport. I prefer the little single gate airports. security is always a breeze because it's done a single plane load at a time, and you always know where your luggage winds up. Not to mention that I live just 20 minutes from one of these airports, and it's at least an hour drive to an international airport.
WorkOutDoors is my favorite workout app! If I had one request is start the workout with the red compass in auto-rotate mode - or at least the last mode i set it in. A second request would be access to media controls like the standard workout app, but I don't know if watchkit even allow that. These upcoming changes you mention sound absolutely spectacular!

Question about the "improved geocaching," is this related to bird acquisition right after opening the app? I've noticed that it always starts with a very weak GPS signal, and if I don't give it a few moments to dial in my location, I get some pretty crazy tracks at the start of my walks. This is something the apple workout app doesn't do (then again, the apple tracks seem to be smoother too, perhaps it's a higher GPS sampling rate, or they are applying some smoothing that you're not?), and I wonder if "improved geocaching" fixes it?

Cub, I just want to thank you for dubbing over your parts where your mic was muted. Any other time I've seen something like that, the footage gets cut and a quick summery is given, or highlights with disembodied narration ("and here is where I...."). You went above and beyond by taking the time and overdubbing the muted parts. I probably wouldn't have even realized it had happened if you didn't mention it! 🌟
I'm seeing the same thing in 13604.5.6. It seems to have started happening about a week ago (when aapl turned on the 32 bit warning) and i haven't even updated to 10.13.4 (too much of a shitshow from what i was reading when it shipped)! I'm finding myself forced to log back into many many more websites whenever I quit safari. It's almost as if they turned up the aggressiveness on tracking protection.
MacOS (and MacOS X before Mavericks) handled this much much better. Than apple went and made each monitor it's own separate spaces container and consistency went out the window. Menubar and Dock behavior is also quite inconsistent now, especially if you load up the system with hundreds of windows. You can go back to the old behavior where all monitors share a single unified spaces container in Mission Control preferences. Uncheck "Displays have separate Spaces". I believe it'll force you to relog for this change to take effect. Despite the horribly inconsistent focus behavior, I've found that overall, I do prefer each display having it's own spaces container. 
Normally yes. These ones are immortal though, so they don't die.
Since it's inside a structure (regardless of biome), rain isn't a problem, but since the structure is in a mesa biome, snow golems melt right after being spawned in. So we had a mod spawn in ones that won't die. This also means we can go up and wack them with a sword and nothing happens.
I used [Replay Mod](https://www.replaymod.com). First, I let the mod record gamestate as if I had changed nothing, then afterwords, I went in and defined the fancy camera paths and rendered out a videos of the same recorded gamestate. The replay only records gamestate for chunks that are loaded by the player running Replay Mod, and the interface for defining camera paths and rendering videos is a little clunky, but the results are incredible if you work within its constraints. I do plan to publish more replay mod clips and videos. Stay tuned.
Siri has different capabilities on every platform. iPhone seems to be the most broad, but also a little less reliable. Siri understands me better in both Car Play and Watch, but also offers a narrower scope of capabilities both ways. I don't bother with Siri on macOS because it's so limited, and I can just type into spotlight instead. I don't have a home pod (nor any interest in that product) but I understand that siri is even more limited than macOS, but takes priority for "hey siri".
I didn't do the science for this farm, but as I understand it the chances that a pigman will spawn is dependent on the number of portal blocks. Tall portals make for more portal blocks per obsidian block. I've only ever seen pigmen spawn in on the obsidian, so I assume they teleport down to the obsidian. Chances are, Il Mango [did the science](https://youtu.be/jJxg95INknA) (note: this farm is not based on mango's video), but it's been quite some time since I watched that video.

Some people consider that cheating. Other people aren't even op and _can't_ do commands. Otherwise, yes that is definitely a workaround when you discovered that you made a huge technical mistake.
yeah, we had some constraints placed on us in order to not lag out the server. I don't think that farm would be moderator approved.
You don't need 10,000 stacks of rotten flesh?
It's an immortal snow golem. If it wasn't immortal, it would melt in the mesa biome's heat. At the time it was spawned in, the mod who did it was renaming everyone and everything with "nug" in the name, and thus "Cheaty Nug" was born.
I forget how many portals there are in this farm. Probably 16, maybe 32. I'll have to go count them.

Nether Portal blocks in the overworld randomly generate zombie pigmen. The more portal blocks there are, the more pigmen it generates. If you're not careful, you can wind up with 2-way linked portals in which case, some of the pigmen will link back out to the nether. Since this farm agros them, if the portals linked anywhere, _angry_ pigmen can show up in the nether. Give it enough time, and a lot of angry pigmen will be hanging around your nether side portal.

2 days to clear these pigmen feels like a stretch for me, but i suppose if you run this farm for weeks on end, you can wind up with 2 days worth of pigmen all jammed up in the nether.
It's a portal based zombie pigman farm. We built it for the gold, but we're counting the rotten flesh it generates as a byproduct. Why? Because it's funny! It generated 10,000 stacks of rotten flash over the course of 4 or 5 months. The counter was over-provisioned to indicate up to 9,999,999, but I don't think it'll even hit 100k before the season ends. Also, the counter display happens to indicate a couple 0's as 8's thanks to rain adding water to cauldrons.
As /u/Snod-GNR says, the redstone itself wasn't effected by the rain, but the cauldron fill level was, and this 7-segment display happens to be sensitive to cauldron fill level. In some very old versions of minecraft (before I ever played), rain would wash away redstone dust. It must have been quite annoying.
I have an Impulse Item Sorter on the item input. While the sorter is letting flesh through, it unlocks an Etho Hopper Clock (set to 65 items). When the hopper clock clicks over, an observer sends a pulse down the rail line which leads to the input on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxodhIPW5IA) 7-segment display.


E: I jumped back into replaymod and did a [quick flyover](https://gfycat.com/PlaintiveDisgustingAxolotl) of the redstone described above.
Nobody wants a bunch of angry pigmen hanging out around their portals! The main portal to the farm is a fair distance from the farm itself, and nobody uses the land directly beneath the farm to risk cross-linked portals. There are some technical mechanics about never exiting from the farm portals to never link or spawn one on the nether side to help with lag as well.
Sorry, this farm was home grown between a buddy who used to play on this server and myself. It's really just a bunch of nether portals, with some strategically placed snow golums (these ones are immortal because the farm is in a mesa biome) to anger the pigmen that spawn in them, and water to bring them to the player for fortuning (or drown them if the player isn't clicking for some reason). There is no tutorial.
I already covered the cauldrons with slabs, but water had already been added. It's just a matter of identifying which ones are overfilled, and bottle 1 or 2 levels of water out. I thought I did this when I added the slabs a couple months ago. Seems I missed some.

The cauldrons are on a piston feed tape, and comparators read fill level and light up some number of lights based on that and signal strength. I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxodhIPW5IA), with my own redstone (Impulse Item Sorter stopping an Etho Hopper Clock while locking the sorting hopper + observer on the hopper clock that fires every time it clicks over) to trigger the counter once for every 64 rotten flesh that flows through the system.

E: I jumped back into replaymod and did a [quick flyover](https://gfycat.com/PlaintiveDisgustingAxolotl) of the redstone described above.
When I built this counter in the middle of the mesa biome, I failed to account for the river biome that the counter actually wound up in. Rain added water to cauldrons, and it seems I still haven't fixed them all yet.

For more facepalmage: here is the counter anti-climatically [clicking over from 9999 to 9960](https://gfycat.com/BlankDifficultGalapagosmockingbird).

Agreed. Zen+ is to Zen as Kaby Lake is to Skylake. A minor clock bump that is otherwise largely the same part, where all the new toys are really on the new chipset.
Z270 was also a minor update to the Z170, and is required for the new special features of Kaby Lake (something something DRM, something something octane) but Kaby will otherwise run in a Z170 just fine. Unlike Coffee which due to the power issues mentioned above is locked out of the Z170/Z270 even if the board was over-specced in the first place.

FTR: I just did one of the smallest upgrades ever: i5 6600k at 4.4GHz auto-overclock to i7 7700k with a tuned overclock to 4.9 GHz at 1.245v. It ran stable at 5GHz with an auto-overclock, but it was also 13 degrees C hotter. Why? My game box is now a media box, and that i5 was a bottleneck. Now the i7 is a bottleneck, but a _slightly_ wider one (thank you hyperthreading and extra MB of cache), and I got a great deal on the i7.

While everyone in this thread is nostolgiating, I played 1.7.2 modded at the end of its life. I started minecraft when 1.9 vanilla shipped.
In Minecraft you can press F3-B to turn on hit-boxes that include an eyeline which shows where the player/mob (and even entities that don't have eyes) is looking. You can use this while the other player is accurately pointing at things on maps, so I feel like the camera is indeed where the eyeline is in the hitbox. Additionally, when you throw items out of your inventory, they come out of your face, as you throw them in the direction you're looking.
10 years is an awfully long foresight. Sure x64 will still stay around in the workstation and server spaces for now, but in the consumer space (you know, the platforms that run steam) we are NOW at peak x64. Both Microsoft and Apple have made overtures to moving their platforms off intel and onto ARM. Microsoft is already on their second try, this time with an emulator that targets the majority of the existing windows applications pool - 32 bit x86. 

Meanwhile apple is deprecating the same 32-bit x86 (they can because they have actual developer adoption of x64) and are rumored to also be bringing macOS to ARM. 

The writing is on the walls for intels domination of the computer industry. 
Windows x64 is a dead end. Microsoft is dropping backward compatibility for it with the ARM x86 emulator. There's not much point in updating steam to x64 on Windows at this point. 64-bit ARM otoh should be a clean starting point on the new windows platform.

I'm upgrading from an i5 6600k running stable at 4.4 GHz on my z170 board. If I had known I would be doing video work on my game box, I would have started on the i7 (6700k) but at the time, it was strictly for games. Now I'm doing video work and bumping into the i5's limits, and this deal popped up! It's not quite a wash for if I had started with the 6700k, but I get the generation bump as well (of course most of the generation bump came in the form of the z270, and i'm not getting that)
They could, but they also put a world border to remove should an update change world generation, giving them (*ahem* cub) all new chunks to explore.

Now the entire image is blurry, and underscanning to correct this doesn't help the blurriness.

Oh believe me, when there is a choice, I go for 64-bit. That doesn't mean that 32-bit software doesn't wind up on the machine anyway. I found 32-bit java the other day and was flabbergasted.
Most of my Windows software is 32-bit, and when I'm given a choice, 32-bit seems to be the default. Especially games, which is the only thing the platform is good at. Microsoft's move to only support 32-bit software in the ARM emulator reflects this weak up-take of 64-bit Windows software. Do you really think they'd just give up on 64-bit backwards compatibility if there was much software to speak of in that flavor?
Thats because there is little to no Windows 64-bit software out there. Most of the apps you run on 64-bit windows is running in the 32-bit WoW (Windows on Windows) environment. Photoshop Ran OK in the Rosetta PPC->x86 Emulator, and [it appears to run OK in the Microsoft x86->arm Emulator](https://youtu.be/PaSmZzo3Y_c?t=82).

Iskall, i like the idea of using a cobble generator for points, but I think it's too easy to deposit your cobble in the chest right next to the treasure pile.

You also need to make it crystal clear which blocks are to be mined and which are part of the scenery, otherwise players will pick apart the arena!

On the flip side, the external GPU won't also be pulling double duty driving the 5k display.

I watched the first season when it was fresh and quite enjoyed it. I just listened to the audio book of the first book and they did a fantastically good job with adaptation (better than game of thrones IMO). They added an additional story thread to the show that I assume came from book 2, (though it also expands on backstory beats that were mentioned in passing in the book) and i don't recall the last ~1/3 of book one in the show. I'll have to go back and re-watch season 1 before I move on to book 2.

I build prototypes (both visual and technical) in creative. This gives me an idea of how much of what resource a project will need, and/or proves a technical concept. It also gives me reference material when I build the thing for real in survival. I agree that creative mode is a very different game from survival mode. And technical minecraft bridges both.
This has unintended side effects such as preventing mobs from getting in boats/minecarts or picking up gear you intentionally drop for them. Better to use a command block which forces all endermen to hold a barrier block when they spawn in and another to stop creepers from exploding (though I have no objection to the last one).

I have no complaints about apple's support. They are top notch and have been for some time. And they better be given how much money they charge for their products. If I had been on any other platform, I would have paid half as much up front and if the phone had died in the same way, I could simply buy another one and still be ahead in dollar value. I buy apple products because 1) they have a history of high quality products with a lot of polish. 2) I can march into an apple store and get the top notch support that I expected and received. I didn't feel it was worth mentioning that they simply met expectations on that front.

My complaints are all about #1: quality control and polish are gone and have been replaced with a "we know better than you" attitude and ratcheted up lock-in. I find it unacceptable that the watch is so deeply tied to the iPhone that I had no choice but to erase the days progress and start over, regardless of how much data was restored to the iPhone. It's a bitter pill to swallow, probably because it's a suppository which I volunteered to take while crossing my fingers that it won't happen to me. In fact, if I had never bought the watch in the first place, the iPhone falling over wouldn't have even been worth mentioning, once again due to apple's high level of support, I would have gotten my new phone and been on my way.

And it's not just the watch/iPhone. It has been decades since apple has made a computer which I have said "I need to buy that" for reasons other than it's the platform where I am the most comfortable. In fact, apple keeps shipping products with more and more reasons to say "I don't want to buy that at all." Nobody wants a notebook who's keyboard fails if you look at it wrong. Especially when you have to replace half the computer when the keyboard inevitably breaks. Even if you can take it to the apple store and get that same top notch support.

Apple computers used to be something you can open and upgrade, but now they're sealed appliances. They has always charged a hefty premium for RAM, so the solution was to buy the bottom spec RAM from Apple and buy commodity parts on the market and install them yourself.  You can't do this anymore in the name of thinness, with a single lone exception in the product line: The 27" iMac. The same 27" iMac which used to have a retirement path as a monitor/server with Target Display Mode. It's been half a decade since you could buy a mac with slots, and two decades since there was even one offered with 6 slots. Yes, sometimes upgradability is desired without adding a rats nest to your desktop. I remember when you could add ports to a computer after purchase, but now you get the choices that apple decides to offer. It used to be a big deal that you can swap notebook batteries on the fly. You could even pop out the CD-ROM and put a 2nd battery. That choice and feature are gone. Mag-safe was a brilliant port for power delivery. Gone. Back on the iPhone, they never offered a replaceable battery, and they had no good reason for killing the headphone jack.

Frankly, this event simply adds to my growing list of concerns with apple, and the wrong path that they seem to be on. Nobody will care if nobody speaks up, so I'm speaking up. It's pretty much impossible to "vote with my wallet" given how healthy the revenue stream is, even if I switch to any other wearable platform, and cripple the integration (I happen to like seeing notifications on my wrist thankyouverymuch).

The neat thing is that the health app is actually one of any number of front ends to that data. Third party apps can hook into this exact same health data and present insights (and/or log metrics), with user control over what apps have read or right access to what data.

For example, my smart scale has it's own dedicated app to read data off the scale, and writes it to the Health datastore but both the scale's app and Health are pretty meh about presenting and interpreting the data. Meanwhile, [Happy Scale](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/happy-scale/id532430574?mt=8) reads this data out of the health datastore and shows me a much better presentation of my weight loss journey.

oh man, this thread is hilarious. _EVERYONE_ here is so deep in denial. Reality is Bitcoin has been dead ever since the censorship started. The corpse has been looted and now we have two parties fighting over which is "the real bitcoin". Fact of the matter is we now have two "real bitcoins": Bitcoin Cash which is scaling through blocksize increases (as proposed in the original whitepaper) and Bitcoin Segwit which fights tooth and nail to prevent scaling in order to bolt major breaking changes onto the existing codebase.

I think the only thing we can agree on here is that both bitcoin successors are stores of value, just like every other major cryptochain.

Purchased it on OPs recommendation. First walk was pretty satisfying! Unlike other GPS Tracks apps, it syncs the full workout back to apple workouts, including the GPS tracks! This app is clearly presenting the GPS data differently from the standard apple workout. I think apple applies more smoothing to the trail.

I love that I can pick and pre-load map tiles on the watch, and at a glance of my wrist I can plan an ad-hoc route that won't take me to dead ends. The only thing that could make this app better is if there was integrated music controls like the standard apple workout app.

I know that when Tango talked about it was during one of his then frequent live streams. I'm not going to start digging through VODs from a year ago though - if they're even still available.
> Tango said he asked X about Zedaph in the first episode.

[Are you sure about that?](https://youtu.be/CW_Y3Mp1Gcg?t=901)

Meanwhile, Xisuma [only introduced the new hermits](https://youtu.be/8hTsXCehR2o?t=163). He did not say who invited them, or even who floated the idea. Incidentally, he also ["accidentally" left night vision](https://youtu.be/8hTsXCehR2o?t=763) on for much of his early shenanigans after setting up the command blocks.

In the case of Zedaph, it was Tango.

Next assumption?
Not sure where you got that information, everyone else says it's a democratic decision with a unanimous vote. _every_ hermit has veto power on inviting new players.
If anyone _own_'s the server, it's cubedhost. X, Impulse, Tango, False, and I'm sure a few other technical players also happen to be op, and X certainly abuses that aspect the most, right along with playing the admin role of trimming chunks and managing the cheaty command blocks, loot tables and head dropping tweaks. 

In S4, False summoned custom heads for her patron hall. Also in S4, X played some mini games from his camera account because his main account was far off in the end and he didn't want to bring it back yet. In S5, Impulse put his camera account in survival mode at his double blaze spawner to soak up the mobcap while he and Tango built the over the top wither farm. Tango has kicked mumbo on multiple occasions due to creating so much lag that he can't do what ever he's doing.

And then there's hermitcraft.com. That is "written and designed" by Hypno!
I think "just" is perfectly justified. Just like in movies they build "just" enough of the house for it to look good on camera (the facade) and create the illusion that the whole thing is there.

Yeah, but that's a wither skele farm where blaze rods are a byproduct. the double blaze spawner should have better rates.

hi, i'm currently helping to strip mine the nether. We're making way for a full perimeter (and then some) wither farm, rather than looking for quarts. I've personally dug up nearly 6k blocks of quartz ore over the last 3 weeks or so at maybe 3-4 hours a day. 

My group did a full perimeter dig for a guardian farm last month, and it gets better XP rates than the Ender-Ender on our server. Mostly because guardians drop bigger XP orbs, but also because people load the end which tanks rates at the ender-ender. Then again, rates tank at the guardian farm too when other people load their own ocean temples.

This is fair. I understand your position here, and don't really have much more to add. 

It has been an interesting debate, and something that I don't think could have happened on that other forum. The pro-segwit position is not popular here, and that tends to also shut down discussion. I expect that most of that unpopularity comes from being tied so directly to the censorship that has been occurring in the other forum over the years, not to mention the astroturfing. I know it has _certainly_ biased yours truly. 

I got into the cryptospace because as a nerd, I thought it was technologically brilliant. I have been very much soured on the entire ecosystem once the politics started, and the censorship sure didn't help. I miss the days of _consensus_, but I do not expect that to ever happen again.

Thank you for expanding on that.

Just like BTC/BCH, we have ETH and ETC. Unlike BTC/BCH, it's quite clear to me that ETC is a dead-end with ETH maintaining momentum. BTC/BCH is as i said above, simply bickering over the corpse of bitcoin.

I hope you also lost all respect for bitcoin when it did the exact same rollback. Remember the rollback of the accidental 92 million bitcoin in  2010? How bout the accidental fork in 2013 due to a database layer change? New technology is hard, and mistakes happen. It gets much harder when censorship and politics get involved.
Dood! you just replied to a bot!
>> The entire point of a protocol change is that all the nodes agree to follow the new protocol

> That's called "consensus". It was achieved with segwit (100% of miners). It was not achieved with Bitcoin Cash. That's why Bitcoin Cash has an insignificantly small hashrate behind it, compared to the segwit chain.
> 

If segwit had indeed achieved "consensus", they could have been honest about it instead of censoring any decent. Where there is censorship, consensus is literally impossible.

> The only reason why people buy eth or ripple is because they don't understand the supply and demand effects of high supply coins. They just think "oh this is cheaper, I can get rich quicker". New altcoins can be created every day, so they will always eat into Bitcoin's total market dominance, because there's always a newb looking for the next "get rich quick scheme".

Everything you said above applies 100% to ripple. Eth is not bitcoin. It is taking blockchain technology in a different direction, and shows a lot more promise as a technology than bitcoin ever did.

> Ethereum is centralized, period.

Thats rich coming from someone who is obviously positioned in the blockstream camp. 

> It's not a competitor to Bitcoin.

> but it's not bitcoin

>  It can never be bitcoin. 

Agreed. It's something different.

> It has inferior characteristics.

Not sure how you came to this conclusion. I say "Different", you can say "inferior" all you want, but you're going to need to to do better than that to convince me that Bitcoin (RIP) SegWit, or BitcoinCash are better than Eth.
Hav a looke at my poste histery. I no speal good.
Nice selective quote there.

> A hard fork would have been cleaner and honest, but politics and censorship got in the way of that and killed bitcoin.

The entire point of a protocol change is that all the nodes agree to follow the new protocol, as has been demonstrated multiple times, _including_ bitcoin cash. Instead censorship and politics threw out the simple solution. Now you have the technical baggage of watching for old nodes doing something that is now forbidden whereas a proper hard fork would have left them out of the new protocol all together. 

These politics and censorship successfully fractured the network, and now the technically superior Etherium, _AND_ inferior ripple have both walked into the schism. Good job blockstream!
Point is, an old node functions on the forked protocol until it mysteriously doesn't. A hard fork would have been cleaner and honest, but politics and censorship got in the way of that and killed bitcoin.
> if they repeatedly try to perform invalid actions.

And of course a pre-august node knows that these actions are invalid how?
I don't see a difference here. If a pre-august bitcoin node spends an anyone-can-spend transaction, they get banned from the segwit network. /u/bitcoinmom is correct. bitcoin is dead. The two successor chains are squabbling over its corpse.
Overcast and Apple Maps for me. I'd love to have the option to use google, waze, tomtom, copiolot etc. ODBII engine management would be neat. Couldn't care less about messaging or telephony apps.
Apple won't give entitlements, or even SDK access if your app can't be categorized onto this list:

> **Audio apps** can deliver music, news, podcasts, and more using a consistent design that's optimized for use in the car. **Apps by automakers** can provide vehicle-specific controls and displays to keep drivers connected without leaving CarPlay. **Messaging and VoIP apps** that work with Siri can be updated to appear in CarPlay.

whatsapp falls under that last category. E: Maps and ODBII engine management both seem like low hanging fruit which apple refuses to pick.

I can concede that blazes being general nether mobs isn't particularly illogical, especially with wither skeles also limited to just fortressess. Guardians should still be restricted to ocean temples though, as what else would they be _guard_ing?
Look dude, if you're trying to imply that Estonia [isn't a first-world country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_in_Estonia)... I'm honestly not sure what to say to that. Perhaps you should simply read the implied /s and move on.
Like I said, you need to be in a first world country. e911 has been a thing since the 1990s. I can't speak to the reliability about either system, but I do know that e911 is widely panned for routing calls to the wrong call center, in addition to spotty coverage. Given that one system is 20 years old and the other is 2, I'd venture to guess that it's AML that makes e911 redundant. Hence "advanced".

It could just be a 50 hz 220 vs 60 hz 120 thing. Different technologies which accomplish the same thing while being incompatible with eachother.
Do you have a proximity key that they foisted on the Sport and Limited trim levels? [This](https://www.wired.com/2017/04/just-pair-11-radio-gadgets-can-steal-car/) is why I refuse to purchase any vehicle with such a "feature".
> Apart from the UK, AML is fully deployed in Estonia, Lithuania, Belgium, Iceland, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand and Austria.[8] Moreover, around 10 countries around Europe are testing AML as a solution to problematic caller location in an emergency with the aim of deploying it by the end of 2017.[9]

Sounds like you got to be in a first world country to take advantage.
Halo, the 3rd person squad based game shipping for mac and windows in 1998. Don't get me wrong, Halo:CE and its sequels did a fair job of capturing the story and environment teased in summer 1997 and the actual synopsis out of the mouth of Jason Jones which I was present for in January 1998. But it was such a major disappointment when Microsoft bought Bungie and changed the platform and direction of the core game.
In the context of Quark the mod and the reality we have, I fully agree. Leaving it up to the ender user or modpack maintainers to make theses tweaks always a good thing, even if there are some questionable defaults.

In the context of "what vanilla should be", changes to mob spawning mechanics actually detracts the uniqueness of these mobs and makes no sense. You may as well spawn parrots in forests and polar bares in deserts. 

Leaving it up to the user to turn it off only creates the tyranny of the default, and whichever way they are set will be how 95% of the end users will leave it.  Everything else quark does add content, or refine existing game mechanics. Heck, in our fantasy world where quark is part of vanilla, mob spawning mechanics should simply be abstracted into json files, just like they're doing with crafting. That way the map makers can make ghasts spawn in jungles, if that floats their boat.
Except for the random blazes and guardians.

This is something incredibly personal. If I stroll along with someone while having a conversation, I can go hours and only make a couple minutes of "exercise". If I give myself a pace that the watch actually counts as "exercise", I'll leave my conversation partner in the dust. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

My last car had a silky smooth CVT. My new car's CVT was programmed to rough shift because people were put off by the silky smooth CVT. Also, go check the settings for your adaptive cruise control. Before I did that, my car would brake super hard and super late.
If the case doesn't break in a fall, but the phone does, you got a bad case. I would never buy an otterbox again if they don't replace the phone.

I've been using some suuuper sketchy cases for years because the first one broke while the phone survived in a 4 foot tumble onto tile.

Oh good, I thought I was going crazy becuase /u/dunkmachine2011 said the video was wrong and then pretty much repeated all the same details.
huh.. thought I typed "L2" rather than the "autopilot" brandname. sadly, i haven't used either GM super cruise, nor autopilot or autopilot 2, though i'm seeing plenty of reviews panning AP2.
keep in mind that we're talking about the poor man's car:

you can plonk down a deposit for a model 3 and hope that tlsa gets their manufacturing act together and go without a car for the rest of the decade, or you can walk out of a subaru/toyota/ford/gm/chevy/honda dealer with something that is far closer to autopilot than simple fixed speed cruise control. today.
sounded to me like the timing was intentionally shifted, but the players didn't keep up at first.
It still amazes me that people still think that CA is a fucking desert. No, only the parts without water (and where people decided to settle for some fucking crazy reason) is a desert. Up here in the bay area, we export our water for the crazy sand people.

Smells like bullshit on billing to me. I'm paying sonic $9.50 a month to "rent" a modem that I cannot buy. This is worse than comcast. I am also forced to pay all the fees on telephone service which I do not use nor want. This is also worse than comcast. Finally, there was an introductory rate $10 discount, and yet somehow my bill is now $20 higher. Internet service is OK. Support is OK. Pro net neutrality is great. If comcast had the same net neutrality stance, I would switch to them in a heartbeat.


I only made it a little more than one season in (if that). I'm incredibly selective on my TV preferences, and TSCC simply didn't make my cut. I may some day revisit the show now that it has run its course, but to me it felt like it was too different from T1 and T2 to really be called Terminator with The Sarah Conner and The John Conner. It could very well have stood on its own as its own story with its own characters and time travel fuckery, but instead had to wedge itself into a franchise who's rules were already being bent.

Edit: Not to mention that Genisys recycled some of the concepts that were evident even in that first season, and negated the entire show (along with the rest of the franchise)
The US has been using Iraq for target practice for [longer than you think](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War). According to the book of knowledge, Operation Desert Storm was happening at about the same time that T2 was wrapping up production. I remember as a 10 year old thinking that this Iraq war thing was just the start of the new World War. I guess I wasn't far off that mark.

I also wonder which cut of T2 you're discussing. The original cut implied that Judgement Day was prevented, but they decided to re-edit it to make that ending more ambiguous and open up room for more sequels. Some of that cut content made it back into the ultimate edition (or whatever they're marketing it as).

Keep in mind also that T2 was really the first of the big summer blockbusters that hollywood has been hooked on for the last 2 and a half decades. The sequels failed to live up to that auspicious achievement, as hollywood was now firmly entrenched into the formula. Also, Arnie was getting old and Cameron didn't want to return to the franchise.

T3 was basically the direct sequel that said "nope, Judgement Day was only delayed lol" and all the rest of the franchise built on the world established there. Salvation had the potential of being a good show set in the dark future, but it was only a shadow of what made T1 and T2 great. Genisys was a shitshow that should never have been green lit due to the level of time travel recursion and fuckery required for it to make sense in the context of T1 and T2. The Sarah Conner Chronicles looked like a good alternate setting between T1 and T2, but like Genisys, requires time travel recursion and fuckery for it to make sense.
No, a lack of an _upgrade_ model is the reason why Panic discontinued Transmit for iOS. They could very well have adopted the ad model or the subscription model, but Panic feels yucky doing both. To each their own, and I respect them for making the decisions that they did.

$10 once (no upgrades, no ads and no subscriptions) leads to [this](https://panic.com/blog/the-future-of-transmit-ios/).

Welcome to the world of apple taking 30% of that subscription revenue.
And my axe!
given that it's a homebrew, i think the definition of "cheating" is entirely up to the builder. Pretty sure the Apple I did have a ROM of some sort, so a modern EEPROM as a substitute is fine IMO.

It turns out that the Others are just Cylons and Game Of Thrones is the continuation of Battlestar Galactica - God did it.
> There’s still conflicting reports about how much it will slow things down.
> 

Everything I've read say that the slowdown is workload dependent. Games which make practically 0 syscalls will have no performance problems. Databases which are all I/O bound are by necessity also syscall bound, and will see major impacts. Your personal computer (little p to be inclusive) will see light performance impact, but reddit and everything else that runs in a datacenter will see heavy performance impact.

TL;DR: It depends.
If you give the schematics and specifications to an experienced builder with a known good track record, and one with a known bad track record, it isn't necessarily a given that the one with a bad track record will _meet_ your schematics and specifications. We've seen this before with TSMC vs Samsung A8 CPUs. The phones with a Samsung part got (slightly) better performance and (slightly) better battery life. I would not be surprised in the least to see next gen iPhones with OLEDs manufactured by both LG and Samsung, with similar performance new, but different aging profiles.
not for the monthly challenge.
I got this one too. Sadly, for the January challenge, it wants me to burn 2.5x my normal calories. Maybe i'll get an attainable goal in February!
Or ever. See ZFS - it was going to be the big new thing in OS X Leopard. Then it didn't ship in Leopard and was eventually removed from the marketing materials with PR drivel about it still being in the works. Now we have APFS.
> I think people also are missing that games have been a flat price of $60 for as long as I can remember. With inflation, they should probably be about $80 now instead.

I remember when games were $70-80+ on cartridge\*. Before accounting for inflation. Modern AAA games are getting squeezed on both ends. They charge _LESS_ for them, and they take significantly more resources to produce in the first place. This is why the juggernauts like EA are thriving. They gobble up the smaller houses who only just make margin, and turn out incomplete low quality shit that looks nice. On top of that, they then turn around and charge the difference for a "complete" experience which is still buggy and user hostile.

\* Keep in mind that cartridges being physical silicon do have additional overhead over optical media and digital downloads, but only the largest games with the onboard co-processors and RAM actually ate up all of this overhead.
> All because of a disclosure statement

No, all this drama is over a _LACK_ of a disclosure statement. If apple had been up front about battery health, and _HOW_ they're mitigating issues created by battery health, this would not have blown up in their faces. Instead, they left a cryptic one liner in a software update and let the conspiracy theorists come up with explanations for poor phone performance.
Apple's hinge game has been spot on since they switched from external hinges on the PowerBook G4 Titanium to the internal hinges on the Aluminum PowerBook G4 and iBook of similar vintage. The TiBook hinges were notoriously bad, so I guess the right person got put in charge after that fiasco!
The real question is: Where can I buy a blender with a cord that long?!
And now we're going around in circles. This is where someone chimes in that this is too little too late.

You forgot the sane and rational option: tell the device holder that the phone has entered limp mode so that they know _WHY_ their phone is running slow. You know, like when any car made in the last 30 years enters limp mode and the dashboard lights up like a christmas tree.
I'd rather they tell me that the phone is running in limp mode and that the batter needs to be replaced. Imagine if your car went into limp mode, and the dash didn't light up like a Christmas tree.
Having worked jobs where I'm both sitting all day and standing all day, I felt much more ... slobbish after long periods of sitting, so I bought a standing desk. Best investment hands down.

I'm lucky enough to be able to work from home, so I made sure that was within walking distance of anywhere I really needed to be, and I get my steps in that way. (It's also incredible that I drove my car just 3000 miles in a year!). ~~A month~~ 40 days ago, I got an apple watch and have gone on a daily walk for 35 of those (in addition to whatever walking I've been doing anyway). There are some local trails with some spectacular frosty views at dawn.

As I age, I do find myself motivated to get my shit together. This motivation may also have been brought on by community crisis. I'm actually forming habits that I should have formed as a teenager, and I've shifted my sleep window forward so that I have some time for those chilly walks at dawn. There is still much I can do for my own health and wellbeing, such as cooking for myself more.
> Before version 6.0 (_that is, on systems from **2008/2009 and earlier**_), the ME can be disabled by

So what you're saying is that ME can't be removed from _modern_ intel CPUs. I'm not sure who's spreading missinformation here. Nobody's talking about a processor from a decade ago.


-----------

Edit: I want to disclaim that the above was written before coffee. Looking back I think it was a little harsh and didn't really contribute to the conversation - especially in the context of libreboot which I admit that I haven't looked much deeper than knowing that it's a thing. Apparently it is only a thing on those same CPUs from a decade ago. As /u/Jokaer0 points out, ME Cleaner exists, but it doesn't fully remove ME on modern CPUs, so my pre-coffee brain took that literally as "if parts of ME are still there, ME is still there".
PPC machines (at least the apple ones) have a 68k emulator in the ROM.
While true, 30 years ago cmd-shift-1 ejected the internal floppy drive and cmd-shift-2 the external if you had one. This is why cmd-shift-3 is still take a screenshot.

I left some ranty feedback about **CUSTOMER SAT** being severely impacted when i got [this advertisement](https://i.imgur.com/6jEEwCH.png) on my wrist. Then I turned off all notifications for the TV app. The maps app is something that I actually use. I may have to reconsider keeping the watch since OP got another advert.
You are correct. I've used Pixelmator for years and was recently trying to do some edits on the iPhone version. The only thing that I could find that was common between the 2 was the name and the file format.
None of the above. The correct answer is HK-47. Meatbag.

The snark is on the phone app too, but I only used it once to setup the watch applet, so I can't really speak to the quality there. The watch applet is pretty good though.
It's one of the highest rated Apple Watch apps, and it is incredibly heavy on the dark snark.

> It's the first Star Wars movie of my entire life that I left my seat bored.

This. Even TPM didn't leave me board. TLJ was about half an hour too long, and pooped all over the setup that TFA left it. As much as people said that TFA felt like an ANH remake, this one felt like it was trying even harder to stay in the ESB and ROTJ mold and didn't bring _anything_ unique, fun or frankly entertaining to the franchise. (OK, that's a stretch, there were some fun and unique bits which could have been distilled down to a couple episodes of SW Rebels)

Now a movie set about a decade before TFA? Thats the movie I want to see. I want to see an entire movie of Lukes failure, not a couple flashbacks. I want to see who Snoke is, and how he came to power. I want to see Phasma kicking ass and training stormtroopers, [whining about TLJ](/s "not be setup as a big bad commander, only to be snuffed out in her first scene which was more than 1 minute long. Imagine if Firmus Piett had a big build up in ANH, only to have his exact same arc in ESB. Thats what they did to Phasma.").
My 165Hz monitor ships with a 144Hz limit. I had to go into a menu to unlock the faster speeds. I think there are cable quality constraints, otherwise things get unstable at the faster speeds.
Yeah, had this happen. It showed up after rebooting the phone or watch or both (don't recall which)

No, Lucasfilm released the laserdisc version with burned in letterboxing on the 2006 DVD set. We want a proper high resolution anamorphic film transfer.
This looks like a modification of the same Mumbo Tree Farm that I built all the way back in Minecraft 1.9. It sent saplings all over my base. The Insomniac Tree Farm on Titancraft Season 2 was significantly better! Not sure who's design it is, but the wood is harvested for every tree on the spot, and it kept up with the saplings a lot better. It's a shame we never finished decorating it, and my custom sapling return system was buggy and not quite fully implemented. Maybe we'll get it right on season 3!

> Large screens are a usability compromise in some ways, but Apple seems to be trying to meet users halfway.

Conversely, the plus size phone and UI are a good fit for my gigantic hands.
> Emulation, especially across architectures, usually has a not-insignificant cost on resources. 

At those costs, emulation provides a (mostly) seamless migration path as apple has demonstrated twice with 68k -> PPC (existing software actually ran faster on high end quadras than first generation power macs, including MacOS itself. Once software started to be ported over the tables turned.) and PPC -> x86-64 (at least this time around Mac OS X was native and only existing software was emulated!). In both cases, the entire software library eventually moved on and it was a win for everyone.

However, Microsoft isn't apple. They have consistently failed at long term support for other architectures (Alpha, PPC [yes, the same PPC as above], IA-64 [not to be confused with x86-64] and even ARM), and the software library has never moved over to being native to anything other than x86 (not even 64). They also have a pretty terrible track record of even providing a built-in emulation layer. This time may be different, but personally, I'm not holding my breath.
I hope you're unplugging from the wall and removing the batteries, otherwise off is really some kind of warm standby.
In that case, someone failed spectacularly on the post-processing. McLain may have voiced some more lines, but it doesn't sound like GLaDOS. At all.
I don't know why you're getting downvoted. It wasn't her voice.
You forgot Popcap and Maxis.
how do you combat sweat interfering with the HR sensor? If I push myself I sweat and then suddenly I get either no HR reading at all, or I get HALF of reality. (i've also seen double reality while at rest hmmm). I've found that I have to move the watch up and down my arm to get real readings again, or even switch arms mid-workout.
My LG headset started buzzing at me all the damn time because it doesn't think it's connected to the phone. Even while playing music (which sounds fine) it'll buzz away. It did _NOT_ do this before i got the watch.
I think it needs 10 days of base data before it starts giving you monthly challenges. Otherwise, it's in the activity app under the achievements tab. You'll see 2 for December 2017, one for getting a perfect streak, and one for the monthly challenge.
I'll see your anecdote with one of my own!

I used to live in an apartment that didn't even show up on Apple Maps. I sent them feedback which never got a response, but I once saw an unmarked sensor van in the parking lot, that looked an awful lot like the ones that Mac Rumors posted about.

I don't have anything to add as I have not had this issue, but 20 years ago, I would say rebuild your desktop.

Games are the last Windows stronghold. I used to do my gaming on Windows and my work on MacOS. Now I do my gaming on windows and reboot my macbook twice a week. I did give Linux a fair shake for my workstation for almost a year, but then it ate itself in a botched distro upgrade. It may be time to give linux another shot for my workstation, though I was never particularly comfortable in it. It's awesome for anything that doesn't need a UI though!
Yes, and I couldn't clear it either.
Quite frankly, "Bitcoin" died on 8/1/2017. Two chains emerged on block height 478558: Bitcoin Core with Segwit, and Bitcoin Cash with EDA and scaling.
Now that Intel has put out an update to the Management Engine, they're leaving it in the hands of the OEMs to push out firmware updates. Who here has gotten any firmware updates since  11/16, and does it [pass the intel vulnerability check](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/27150)?

My Gigabyte Z170MX Gaming 5 most recent firmware is from 6/30 and fails the intel vulnerability check. It almost feels like the Android game where critical firmware updates are slow to reach end equipment due to lazy OEMs. HPs and Dells are getting their firmware update already, but I have to wait for Gigabyte in order to patch my custom built rig. I'm curious what the status is for the MSIs, Asus's and other board manufacturers, not to mention _newer_ Gigabyte boards, so that I have another factor to consider when I make my next build.
You could do it in two phases. Save up for the ballers PC with a meh monitor, and then save up for a monitor that is actually worthy of the ballers PC.

The nether loads for a moment when they go through the portal and then unloads. When Mumbo goes to the nether (or another hermit goes near Mumbo's nether area) it loads and the mobs "get taken care" of then. Bottom line: I wouldn't worry about it.
Sadly, [Title Safe Areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_area_\(television\)) have been a thing for longer than displays with edge to edge screens. I applaud apple for adding simple parameters for safe areas, and I look forward to them being standardized in CSS. I also think that the iPhone X's display physically removing pixels was a bad decision, but "the market" has gone gaga over it.

Given that it took literally 0 effort to [find a $100 game](https://www.gamestop.com/ps4/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-war-gold-edition/140107), I'm sure that means that _SOMEONE_ wants to pay for it. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Extra microtransactions and all!
Natural scrolling makes sense on a touch pad. It drives me nuts on a mouse. It drives me even more nuts that the same setting is applied to both devices.
Snow Leopard, Mountain Lion, and El Capitan were great releases. They were quite light on big wow front end features, but were rather refinements and optimizations of the previous releases. Think Windows 98 SE. High Sierra even brings along a new filesystem. Sadly, I think Sierra was more stable. Lots of issues here, just like iOS 11. Part of that perception could very well be rose tinted glasses, but I don't recall any of the "minor" MacOS updates being so bad out of the gate. It feels like Apple did a bad job with QA this year.
Springs and gears.

MLC and TLC SSDs track bits in low, med, and high (and more granular) charges in the same amount of physical space as SLC SSDs did reading just high and low. The problem is that the error rate goes up when you have more charge zones to read as we're hitting quantum effects now and no 2 charges are exactly the same level. Sometimes that cell set medium will read high.

Ars Technica did an in-depth article on this subject [here](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/06/inside-the-ssd-revolution-how-solid-state-disks-really-work/).

I tried the xperia play in 2011. It was an underpowered shit phone, running on an old version of android that had compromised controls. The game library was fractured between the google and sony stores, and there were absolutely no compelling titles on offer. Even running emulators on it was a terrible experience due to the shit controls. I returned it after a week.
I love how they put a Finish button where Microsoft wound up putting a Start button.
And they charge a hefty premium for upgrading to usable amounts of RAM. This is one reason it stings so much that they decided to solder ALLLL the RAMs
I think the downvotes were enough for that, but thank you.
Thats because text doesn't convey the dripping sarcasm and i didn't bother with the /s tag.

The grandparent of my comment said to get a hue instead. My comment was a juxtaposition of the parent's comment asking how the hue is meant to replace this "flame" bulb.
ding ding ding. This guy gets it.
The big differences are in the UI vs NS prefixes, and some cobweb clearing in the evolution from AppKit to UIKit.
How is a flaming bulb supposed to change colors at my own whim with an app on my phone? Or the change of the weather?
That's plausible. I found that the move ring tends to advance over the course of the day without an explicit "exercise", and since that was the start of my day, I naturally closed my rings anyway.
Completion time in what?
I don't know what i'm looking at here. It's not converging.
Somehow I did not get this badge, but racked up 40 minutes total, including 2 workouts that were longer than 11 minutes each. 🍟

ninjedit: now that i look again, i got the badge afterall (along with a 7 workout week). It just never told me and it was NOT there last night.
When you're looking at the list of workouts on the iPhone Activity app, you can tap the year in the upper left corner. That gives me monthly totals (which in my case is just 1 week). I don't see anywhere that would be yearly or lifetime totals though.
Yes, I have been using the open goal outdoor walking workout for almost every walk I took this week (I've used other workout apps on occasion, but like the Apple data best). Very surprised that I have already covered 20 miles with this thing.
1 week in here, and i agree with just about everything as above. _including the walk in the rain_. One thing to add is that the rings don't quite reflect reality I went for a 36 minutes walk this morning and was only credited 29 minutes, ~~and somehow I didn't earn the Veterans Day badge, despite TWO workouts that were over 11 minutes each.~~ (The veterans day badge appeared today).
The CarPlay protocol does allow for the car/head unit to forward GPS data to the phone so it can turn off that major battery drain. No idea if any cars, or head units (OPs in particular) implement this feature.
They even did a big reveal at a MacWorld keynote saying that it would launch on Macintosh. Steve had every right to be furious. Halo CE did eventually ship on Macintosh, but it was a port of the Windows port, so it wasn't very good.

Apple ID has been a thing since the 90s. Then iCloud comes along and says "create an iCloud account" so I did. And it hasn't been a problem until iOS 11 came about. Apple provides no migration path, and all I get is a flurry of what amounts to "you're holding it wrong" responses when I point out that something that has been working fine for a decade is a problem for the hot new feature. I don't know what else I should have expected. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Because I used my Apple ID for iMessage the way it was meant to be used. I used iCloud for backups and photos, the way it was meant to be used. They started as different things and now we're in a mess where i have bifurcated data and can't use the cool new thing.
Why fix what isn't broken? It hasn't been broken for a decade.
You're holding it wrong?
It's not a separate account for iMessage, it's a separate account for backups and photos.
iMessage didn't exist when the iCloud account was created.
Not to mention an entire fan servicy episode which was never aired by Toonami.
Valkyria Chronicles does this. If a character dies on a mission, they're dead. However, it only saves if you succeed in the mission and proceed with the story, so you do have a chance to restart and try not to kill the character.
The crazy part is that text to speech still pronounces it as an I.
and this makes it crystal clear _why_ it takes about 16 years to launch the game.
Impulses server Just reset a week or so ago, so now's your chance to get in on the ground floor there. Tango's server is due to reset "around the new year". Given the late stage of the world, there are some incredible end game builds here.

I played the entire season on Tango's server and have had lots of fun. There's a great community there with some awesome mods who operate with a light touch. On the modded side of things, the server runs spigot with some moderator tools such as world guard and worledit, but from a player's POV it is more strictly vanilla, with some game mechanics (such as redstone) tweaked to be more server friendly. Commandblock add-ons include xisuma's first mob head pack, a couple custom boss fights, and a resettable super-size mansion.

Impulses server so far seems to be a lot more vanilla. Where Tangos server started out with a pre-set spawn area, Impulses is strictly world-gen where the players will develop a spawn town organically. Impulses server is also much more strict on claimed areas, with 20x20x20 town plots and 15 chunk x 15 chunk main-base claims registered with the mods, and in restricted locations. The full head pack is installed here as well, and there is some command-block trickery to show welcome messages and when you're in the town area ("Pulse Valley")

I also logged into Zedaphs server once. It seems pretty mature, but I have no idea what stage that one is at right now. I can't speak for Mumbo, Xisuma, Cubfan, Iskall or Scar, as I have not joined their communities.
Not if compared against the 7 plus (and 8 plus). The GPU is pushing just 400000 fewer logical pixels, but then has to scale the whole thing down to 1080p.
I have the base radio with the march patch - have not gotten the newer patch(es) installed.

The dealer handled the issues very very poorly. I made an appointment to get my issues documented (reverts to initializing, unstable carplay. It even locked up once with a frozen image from the backup camera and no ability to change the radio volume or tuning), and hopefully a firmware update installed. I noted this when I made my appointment. When I showed up for my appointment I got blown off with a "yeah, i've seen that. wait for a patch". I was furious that I had to take a chunk out of my day to bring my car to the dealer only to be turned away because they didn't read my own damn notes and call me ahead of time to tell me not to bother. And the kicker? They didn't even check me in, so I got an automated "you missed your appointment. would you like to reschedule?" message.

I escalated this issue to SOA, and when the first patch was released, they and the dealer were able to get me taken care of. Probably because it was a full-on recall. Of course this update did not resolve all my issues, so I kept the ticket open with SOA, who's last communication was in May stating that they "expect a new release in the next month or two," and that they would get back to me when it is ready. As I understand it, there was an update in June, and possibly another since, but I have not heard a peep from either the dealer or SOA. I even reached out to the dealer in June or July only to feel like I was talking to a brick wall with absolutely ZERO feedback.

My first Subaru was great. No issues, and the (different) dealer took care of me. My Second Subaru has had loads of entertainment system issues (such as those stated above, and even a post-update full on reboot) and I feel like neither SOA nor the dealer has done a good job being receptive to my concerns. When my lease is up, I will probably be looking at other brands due to this poor showing. Not that any other brand is better for end user support. Buggy software on a new platform I can understand. I accepted that I was probably going to be more or less beta-testing the new car on the new platform which had only been in full production for a few months. I did not expect to be treated so poorly post-sale - especially for a repeat customer.
There's always the classic up up down down left right left right B A Start
And just like every other shoe-store, they have very limited selection on shoes that fit. It just so happens that at that one particular time i was shopping for shoes, the Zappos selection for 'virtually every brand FOR MY SPECIAL ~~EYES~~ FEET' == cheep chinese crap.
I bought a pair of shit Chinese shoes on zappos once. the laces fell apart, so i replaced those. then the rest of the shoes fell apart. I went back to redwing after that.
Why stop there? A *phone* doesn't need a camera at all, or a color screen, just something that makes phone calls and has a battery that lasts for 15 weeks. Just bring back [this tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310) and be done with it. 

Now a personal communication device? Please give me the bells and whistles. The biometric sensors to lock down access are a must for something that is essentially an external brain. Having actual 2x zoom (however clunky of a solution it may be to put an entirely separate camera sensor and lens package on there) has changed the quality and types of photographs I take on the only camera that matters - the one that I have on me. I'm sure a 3D camera would do the same. A big beefy GPU is a must both for automagically improving the camera output, and playing your games on your fancy screen. An IR Blaster is really fun to have. Just go around changing peoples channels and turning off their TVs all while looking like you're texting. 😈

All of this runs contrary to the tank described above. You're going to have something that is fragile, has shit battery life, and still has legacy telephone connectivity buried in there.
If Nintendo had acknowledged that a 2D Mario game wouldn't work with touch controls, they wouldn't have made a touch screen Mario game. They tried, and failed. They took what would have ultimately been a bad experience, and butchered everything that makes a Mario game special, and still turned in a bad experience.

The always online part didn't help matters. The only time anyone wants to play are when they don't actually have an internet connection.
> Nintendo is not going to butcher the experience of true 2D Mario.

Reducing the controls to just jump pretty much butchers the experience of true 2D Mario. It's so frustrating to not be able to actually control Mario!
> I have 8 gb, want to add 8 more.

> just match your current ram speed.

My car is slow, but it's not because it doesn't have racing stripes. And since when is the ability to remove heat fancy? Thats like asking me to find a car without brakes. No, i'm talking about the bullshit like LEDs that change color based on CPU load. THAT's fancy. And completely useless. Like racing stripes.
In the same way my car without a racing stripe is slow.
I've had a 1070 since August 2016. So far it's worked great.
What? Fancy RAM isn't necessarily faster RAM, and if you mix and match, you'll limit the performance to the slowest part anyway!
But isn't Intel's new pattern Tick, tock, tock, tock, tick?
No, like the TruTone feature that automagically pushes the white balance yellow when your indoor lighting, but that's only on the 8.

OP is either half way through the 2 year cycle which qualifies him to start over on a fresh IUP and phone, or he has to pay for the other half of the phone. Of course he could sell that phone and use the proceeds to pay off the 2nd half of the IUP.
And on the other hand they now have giant four door monsters that look like a hummer went to a costume party dressed as a Porsche. I saw one parked next to an actual Porsche once and it was incredibly apparent what an abomination that thing was.

Right, something my dealer made a big song and dance about.
From what I recall, the Impreza is only made domestically as of MY17.
And now watch as Window Server eats 90GB of RAM and your entire computer halts and catches fire in a fit of disk swapping.
I have a tendency to skip the stream replays because they aren't really content. They're 4 hours of host hanging out with their patrons who throw money at them while they do the most grindy work. Quite booooorrrriiinnng if you're not actually there and not interested in watching people throw money at the host.

The actual exception was [Tango and Zedaph cooking with various handicaps applied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy4Pxw2OTFw). Totally hilarious and not just more grindy gameplay. People still threw money at them though.

I'm not hating on anyone for doing what puts food on their tables. Nor those who can afford to patronize their peeps. Youtube used to put food on peoples table for producing good content, but since that monetization pool has dried up, you got to find some other way to eat.

As long as Iskall (Or Xisuma, Tango, Impulse, Zedaph, Cubfan, Joehills, False, Ren, etc) keeps producing well edited and entertaining videos, I'll watch them, but I honestly don't have the interest or time to go watch live on twitch/mixer, or the replays on youtube - especially when they feature games which I have no interest in. 

Multiplayer (co)streams and live IRL events on the otherhand are fantastic and I eat them up. This is why, out of all the names listed above, the only streamers I've stuck around for are Tango, Zedaph and Impulse, and even then I'll skip a fair number of streams just due to not having enough time.
You might want to check in with the car industry and the massive shitshow that is entertainment systems in new cars.
That's a minor plot point!
"Why are you reading placeholder text? This text is only here to validate the page layout. It isn't worth reading."
Color me unsurprised. Overall the car is great, but I’m continually disappointed in the reliability of the entertainment system. I leased eyes wide open that I was more or less beta testing the new model, but I even feel like my feedback was ignored. This was my first, and probably last new car on a new platform. Hopefully all the kinks will be worked out by the time the lease is up. 
And I’m sure this is the same sad reason that they solder RAM now.  They don’t _trust_ end users (and of course, so that can change a significant premium for usable amounts of memory). 

It leaves us power users who _can_ manage our own systems (sometimes even by trial and error that breaks things) without a preferred platform. Windows is shit, and the Linux end user experience is a nightmare. 
~/Library/Preferences/*.plist is far from rooting around in the OS, but OK than.
> the only surefire way to fix these problems is to wipe your iOS device entirely and set it up from scratch. Don't even restore it from a backup, _as this will often bring back corrupt settings_ that are causing the issue in the first place. 

This right here folks is where the apple sandbox is a trap. Under EVERY other operating system, you can root those corrupt settings out and restore the rest of your environment. With iOS? fuck no. 

*sigh* and it's still better than android.

can't speak for OP, but the one time I was on pain meds, they got me high as fuck, but i was also still in just as much fucking pain. It was brutal and I gave up after the first does. Some people just respond to the meds differently.
Thank you for expanding my one _very general_, and somewhat hyperbolic opinion statement into 4 paragraphs of opinion! 🎯
If you think a touch screen is bad, you should see the _trackpads_ they're putting in lexuses. They're so bad that you have to navigate 3 menus deep and it calls a CSR to program your car.
not to mention the new crazy UI with squiggly lines and the _FORCED_ tutorial when you just want to use the old app that actually works.
SoundJam MP was awesome, then apple bought it and bastardized it into iTunes.

Apple [dipped their toes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAd) into selling ads, but it completely flopped with a revolving door of executives because everything the ad people wanted to do were forbidden by the rest of the company.

I think this is as strong of evidence as the OP will get (which IMO is pretty weak).
If by "90s and earlier", you mean "60s", than you are [technically correct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-sharing). The best kind of correct.

Not to mention that you can cheese it with an [afk fish-farm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y31TEbKjSpg). All you have to do is use auto-hotkey (or the like) to simply hold down right click and walk away.

Its just incredible that the structures were razed to the ground, but all the trees are still there.
Did Apple lay off their QA department? there are issues all over the place with all of this falls releases. LTE Watch gets stuck in captive portals. APFS password recorded as the hint. All sorts of weird UI glitches on iOS 11. This is a very poor showing for Apple all around.
Off hand, there is Middletown which was wiped out a couple years ago, and the Oakland Hills near 20 years ago. I don't currently have the time to look into the current state of either situation, but they're a good place to start to get an idea of what will happen here.
The same applies to flights _from_ STS. My flight on Monday was moved to SFO at no charge (of course, I had to make travel arrangements to SFO, but that's a different story. so many somber faces. quite heartbreaking.)

Only if Intel allow it, and they're not in any kind of position to want to allow it. The IBM deal was kinda a big deal to scrappy little intel to be able to take on the big boys like DEC, so they accepted IBMs terms. Present day juggernaught Intel is in a position to walk away from any deal with terms like that.
On the other hand, AMD holds the cards on the 64-bit extensions to x86. I'm sure Intel and the new AMD owning entity would come to terms pretty quickly.
You're thinking of Cyrix who reverse engineered x86 and then was bought out by VIA.

AMD got the license because IBM insisted on dual sourcing the CPU for their grand-daddy PC.

Indeed it is very much not as black and white as i stated. This is a very good article, and introduces a ton more nuance than my two sentences no longer than a tweet.
Better put: biometrics are not passwords. They're usernames which need to be backed by a 2nd factor for authentication. Apple is irresponsible to not offer support for a second factor.

Of course, they don't want their consumers locking themselves out of their devices, and need to support some kind of initial unlock fallback, so the above statement is not so simple to make happen.

Also, not in terms of software. The screen has the same 375 point width as the non-plus phone, and when you account for the margins needed for the corners and notch, the same 667 point height as the non-plus phone.
The plus line has always had a better camera from the non-plus line. Not to mention the better screen. The X has an even betterer camera and betterer screen (though not necessarily any bigger for actual app usage)
I think the iPhone 7 was the 2nd s on the 6 line, and the 8 was the 3rd s. Given this new pattern, I think the 6s is going to be the last iPhone on the s line.

My new 8 plus is nearly indistinguishable at a glance from my old 6s plus. You have to know what you're looking for to tell them apart - the camera, the headphone jack, the button colors and the exposed case color.
Thats OK Etho, I finished the Nextus, and then iterated on it several times. The original prototype looked and worked quite a bit like your monstrosity (I even used the same word weeks earlier!) Now it's 1.5 blocks wide per slice and almost unrecognizable from your original design, but it works to spec! Thanks for the awesome idea! :)

Some day I'll do a showcase video, and will of course give you credit for getting the ball rolling on the project.

Also, we still love you! Good luck on the next project you start. Perhaps you can delegate someone to finish that project to.

I had difficulty using this feature ever since 6s launch day. You have to do the gesture _just so_, or you'll get no response. It turned out to be faster and more reliable to just rely on the home button. Therefore, I have ignored this broken feature for most of the lifetime of my success plus. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 
My success plus _indicated_ terrible battery life after i gave it a day or so to settle. Being unsatisfied with this bad battery life, I cycled the battery. It took iOS 10 normal times to drain, and after a full charge, indicates a proper 2 day battery.
This is like saying that because Foxconn MAKES the iPhone for Apple, [their in-house designed phones](https://www.sharpusa.com/forhome/mobile/models/aquoscrystal-306sh.aspx) should be just as good as iPhone. Samsung _fabricates_ the A series chips (except for the minority fabbed by TSMC). Apple designed and tapes out the chips for fabrication.
As someone who would be buying AppleCare Plus+ Pro Extreme anyway, the cost difference is a wash going with Citizen One or Verizon, so I went with Citizen One to keep my options open ~~when Verizon decides to shitcan my line~~ if I decide to hop onto some other carrier.

and all the more reason for me to dislike my dealer. I've asked them multiple times over the months if there's another update, and they more ore less blew me off. *sigh*
If you got your car before march, there was an update around then which the dealer needs to apply. There was a recall because at the time the entire head unit could lock up and prevent access to the backup camera. If there has been another update since then, they haven't told me.
Not many changes that I've noticed. Slightly revised maps UI. Signal Bars are the new Signal Dots. Castro now shows the playback speed with a dead button that does literally nothing. New Siri look and voice.
My 2017 Impreza's head unit is quite finicky and unstable. 3 car play versions later, and it's still finicky and unstable. I've learned to tune the radio to the local classical music station because it won't stay off the radio, and plug the lightning connection into the phone after i'm done reversing. If I (or my passenger) slightly touch the lightning connection or move the phone (or I take a... spirited turn with enough lateral G forces to move the phone), carplay is interrupted and sometimes it takes several minutes to re-establish.

At least it's been months since the last time it dropped all the radio presets.

According to [this blog](http://vashivisuals.com/the-hot-new-filmmaking-aspect-ratio/), Netflix is a big fan of the 2:1 aspect ratio.

And we still have it because modern TVs still _SIMULATE_ overscan to ruin the picture and introduce lag all at the same time.

This entire thread are people whining that when you optionally opt into overscan mode on the iPhone x, the notch then cuts off part of the picture.

My objection to the notch and corners starts at the user interface with bloated forehead and chin controls in portrait and completely ruined layout with a ton of dead space for landscape.
I see it, it's synced up with the taptic tick on my 6s plus.
 I think Apple has been drinking Intel's cool-aid.
TL;DW: bloated forehead and chin UI in portrait mode to account for the notch and corners. In landscape mode, tons of dead space on the sides and bottom to account for the notch, corners and home widget.

When the standard chrome is not used (such as the home screen, or the weather app), it looks quite nice.

Apple has done it 3 times, and they all came with some kind of backward compatibility mode which lasted for some years.

* Classic MacOS -> Mac OS X (The Blue Box booted your entire Mac OS 9 environment in a virtualized sandbox)
* PPC -> Intel (Transparent Rosetta Emulator translated PPC code to x86 on the fly)

I think it's safe to assume that there will be some kind of backward compatibility mode for an arm mac which runs much like Rosetta.
Yeah, the American payment industry still defaults to swipe and sign. Even today where the banks are issuing chip and sign cards (don't get me started with the lack of chip and pin), many payment terminals still _only_ support swiping. I am finally starting to see more Chip and NFC terminals, but you may as well not even bother with chip transactions because they take about 3 weeks to process. Where available, NFC, Cash and Swipe are all faster than Chip.

I double facepalmed when Mumbo put all those furnaces on all his hoppers. [Current consensus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8s7S-xFVZcg) is that furnace+hopper is _more_ laggy than an uncovered hopper. Mumbo really wanted to use furnace+dropper to reduce lag.

This right here. If Curse/Twitch in it's current state appeared today with no history it would be the best modded minecraft launcher out there. The problem is, the version of Curse which it replaced was a _BETTER_ modded minecraft launcher, so now everyone has their panties in a twist. Including myself. I **HATE** the new launcher because it's not as good as the old one. Then I look at the field, and everything is just so terrible, and I have to reluctantly come back to the shadow of its former curse. 

The community is begging for someone to step up and replace Twitch with something that is as good at being a modded minecraft launcher/browser/installer that the _OLD_ Curse was, but without all the scope creep that they have had all along. That's a very tough nut to crack.

> Note that, in SP, some client-side mods (optifine is a notable example) have _**additional**_ effects that they don't have in multiplayer.

The disconnect is that your reply subtly changed the subject to add some nuance which has no bearing on the fact that using client side mods makes it by definition no longer vanilla. Subtlety which obviously went right over my head, as I thought you were saying that optifine doesn't change gameplay at all on MP.

I too play on a vanilla server, and (with moderator approval) run optifine, light level overlay, inventory tweaks and schematica (but the printer is banned - something i wouldn't use anyway). Some other players have made a stink over how schematica changes gameplay to make it "less fair" by letting you paint by numbers, and to a lesser extent light level overlay for letting you quickly spot spawnable spaces. The extreme example of course would be for a client side mod to let you fly or see through walls. 

Coming back to the core conversation, Hermitcraft is a vanilla server (with some gamerule, command block and loot table changes) and many of the hermits run some light client side mods which do indeed have effects on gameplay. Of course OP's question was about middle-click which is something that has been in the vanilla client since 1.9 for survival, and much longer for creative.
/u/wonka_02 said that there are no mods on hermitcraft, as it's vanilla. I pointed out that many hermits use optifine. You said that optifine doesn't change the gameplay, and then I cited 3 examples where it does indeed change gameplay. Not sure where the disconnect is here...

A good notable exception of a mod which does _not_ change gameplay would be replay mod, which only records world state change and allows you to make more fancy time lapses without a camera account.

Hermit Wars was very much a beta/prototype of what Hermit Quest turned out to be. A lot of the concepts were there, but they weren't executed as excellently. Hermit Quest's gameplay refinements were very much informed by everything that went wrong with Hermit Wars. I too am looking forward to the 3rd iteration!

Further demonstrating my point about non-standard UX. You shouldn't have to change away from the default to get an app to conform to the host platform behaviors. And again, we're talking about a _GOOD_ cross platform app!
IntelliJ is the perfect poster child for non-native applications which do everything they can to avoid conforming to the host platform's look and feel. It's quite powerful, but it's look and feel does _NOT_ conform to any platform beyond JetBrains' platform. And it's not just the big stuff like the fact that the window chrome looks nothing like the host platform. The macOS keyboard text interaction which has been trained for 30 years into my muscle memory have completely different behaviors on the jetbrains platform, and I'm frequently caught out when I do some keyboard sequence and get some different behavior instead. Example: cmd-delete removes every character to the left of the cursor on standard macOS text controls, but in jetbrains, it deletes the entire line. 

It's this kind of (lack of) attention to detail which leads to applications built in non-native cross-platform toolkits (such as swing or electron) becoming second class applications on all platform.

You have to also take into account that much of the Tolkein world building wasn't meant for publishing. It's fine that it's a difficult read because it was only meant for backstory and world building.

I can never remember who designed what, but I think Doc is using an ilmango design for his bulk storage, and X copied Doc's version. As I said, Tango designed his item sorting system, which indeed Mumbo is copying. Mumbo's storage room looks quite nice too.

Yes, doc is absolutely killing it lately. Tango's doing quite well as well. And I got my own villager in Impulses base! Let's not forget the creative chutorials which Ren was doing before he shifted over to Moba Lisa II.

And of course, I am taking inspiration from all the hermits. I did a not too terrible hillside terraforming last week (still need to go back and bonemeal it), and have spent the last 2 weeks picking up Etho's mini-nexus (nextus) design and running with it. I've got it nicely optimized  since I made my post about my prototype and I'm now actually building the final version.
You forget Iskall and Wels building the same dark room ~~flushing~~ lagging spawner stack! Also, Docm and Xisuma using the same shulker box bulk storage system. Also also Tango and Mumbo using the same item sorting system (though at least this one was designed by Tango).

I too found this frustrating at the start of the season, as not only were all the hermits building the same contraptions, but they were also doing it at the same time. They've finally diverged a bit, but here we go again with both cub and X putting up creeper farms at the same time. Using cats - at least they both did their own science.

In addition to what everyone is saying, if you have a completely blank mac (like say you had wiped your drive for windows or linux) there is still internet recovery built into the firmware of any mac sold in the last decade or so which will download and install a working version of macOS as long as you have an internet connection.
Perhaps VM = Virtual Memory. My guess is that they're leveraging APFS to get that swap file off the root filesystem into it's own slice or container or whatever term APFS uses.

Every Debian release is [named after a Toy Story character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_version_history). I'm not aware of any agreement with Disney and Pixar, but apparently some key figures in Debian worked at Pixar in the early days of the project, so there could very well be an agreement.
Those AVX units are there because these are xeons rebranded for the consumer space, and xeon buyers are the sorts of very select group of very powerful customers who require them. This does exclude kaby lake X, which of course does not include AVX because they are consumer kaby lake chips with their graphics neutered.

not with that attitude! the trick is to log on every day, get my iron ration and log off. then when i'm ready to play, i'll have multiple days worth of rations. At this point i've got beacons all over the place, i'm using iron blocks as building blocks, i have all the hoppers i need, and i still have more iron than i know what to do with.
instead, Win10 edition has microtransactions. weee!
You just described how it has been for ages. Headline says the new behavior takes away the option for the app to offer _only_ "Always" and "Never", and put the user in control to pick "When in use" anyway.
Alice. You're thinking of Alice. (I still like Ferrous Wheel as a better name)
> Iron is too valuable

it is? The server I'm on has an iron titan and i get 3 stacks of blocks as a daily ration.

Here's a scenario where the 24" would be the better buy: If Windows and apps handled screen scaling with any kind of grace. 150% looks quite nice on my 24" 1440p display, but there are so many quirks that turning it back to 100% is a must.
Artificial segmentation to make you buy the latest and greatest. See Hand-Off, Continuity and Air-Play for other examples. The excuse is *always* that they don't want to add support for the not quite latest version.

The Jamstick only has 5 frets. Rocksmith does expect a full range guitar (24 frets?), so you're going to have a bad time for most songs. No idea how it would handle techniques such as hammer on/off or slides and bends, but I'd imagine those would be a poor experience as well.

I don't know about your steam library, but out of my 343 game library, 244 games are compatible with macOS, and [Quick n' Dirty Steam Linux Compatibility Checker](http://steam.bravehost.com) says that 168 games are Linux compatible. Why? because I focused on mostly mac compatible games, which does indeed exclude EA, Ubisoft and the other AAA houses, and games which have been ported to (or cross developed for!) macOS tend to also be ported to linux as well.

Just like you wouldn't expect to play Halo on a Playstation, don't expect to play Overwatch on Linux. But there is of course TF2.

X, you asked if the scoreboard helps the dig go faster. I think so. Tango's patreon server has the same score board for digging out our massive quad-whitch farm. A ton of progress has been made since the scoreboard went up, despite pleas for a month for helping dig it out. People just like seeing big numbers next to their names.

Then again, the mods offered prizes, so perhaps that extra competition helps motivate us.

In this context, the integration in no way implies the power of the graphics solution. A modern intel integrated GPU will beat the pants off an ATi RAGE II you might put in that 8600 (than again, the non-accellerated 8600 would also outperform a Rage II). Here the integration is all about being able to swap parts to meet needs. Something which is absent across the entire Apple lineup. Hell, for the vast majority of the Apple lineup, the RAM is integrated and where storage is modular, it is on a proprietary connector which requires considerable disassembly to access.
Nice Color Classic there :)
When I unboxed my dell gsync monitor I went gaga over the tiny bezels. Then I turned on the monitor and was quite disappointed to find that the actual bezels were quite a bit larger than the external cosmetics implied. Still the smallest bezels of any display I've ever owned.

I want to give Biffa props for the editing and use of the camera account. Very Fine. The only nit I could pick is when he does a cut mid-scentance. There's no face cam to show the cut, so it would be much smoother if he cut the audio separate from the video.

Honestly, I overbuilt my system with a "mid-range" GPU in the form of a 1070. The thing that urks me is that I have a high frame-rate monitor, but nvidia's own "recommended" settings kill the framerate by giving me 3160p super-sampling down to 1440p. I can't tell the visual difference if I switch back to 1440p, but I can sure see the framerate difference! So it's not just that people are targeting the wrong settings for the hardware that they have, so are the manufacturers!

Adaptive cruise control in stop & go traffic is amazing. I don't get into that kind of traffic jam often (the perks of working from home) but when I do, it is a major stress reliever. I recommend changing it from the default setting to the comfort setting, otherwise it stops and accelerates a bit hard for my taste. I have only ever needed to push the button once for it to resume from a stop, but otherwise, yes it is as advertised.

On my Impreza, there is an indicator behind the wheel that shows weather it has lock on the car ahead, and there is a little beep every time lock is acquired or lost. Very reassuring

A word of caution though, don't use it in traffic on windy roads. I was using it in such a situation and as we went around a hairpin turn, the system lost it's lock on the car ahead of me and tried to accelerate to the set speed. I stopped that right quick!
It matters because it's not the behavior we're used to from previous cars - even previous subarus. It also matters because it violates CarPlay behavior guidelines. Finally, it matters because the one thing more annoying to turning on the car and finding it tuned to AM/FM *again* is when turning on the car and finding it tuned to static because it dropped all the AM/FM presets. *again*.

Yes, you have identified a workaround. Now my getting out of the car routine has to be:

1. turn off engine
2. unplug phone (AM/FM turns on - 2014 Forester would have gone silent, CarPlay guidelines says that the radio should return to previous state - off in my case)
3. roll the volume to silent
4. open my door

In any other car I have ever driven, turning off the engine also turns off the radio, so this is actually doubly annoying.

I did report this issue to my dealer, along with half a dozen other issues and feature requests, some of which they were able to address, and others with undesirable workarounds like the above.

Meanwhile, the other hermits are still doing synchronized projects. They moved from AFK fishing on mushroom islands to building slime farms.
I'm eager to see what they do on Saturday. I'll check in and report back. Also had a chat with the new owner of Sebastopol Cookie Company - she wants to make Main Street two-way again. I can't see that helping with traffic, but I can see it helping with navigation!

In the consumer space, Apples Fusion Drive works pretty well, and is even bootable. BUUUT: like the Microsoft solution, there is no GUI to configure it and you're out on a limb if you decide to do it yourself with your own drives. Apple wants you to buy an entire computer with Fusion Drive configured out of the box.
It's called roleplaying, and quite honestly, it makes for significantly better content than going to a mushroom island and afk fishing.
Ship more storage without requiring amputation!
Yeah, nHo are definitely roleplaying as heals to stir up the drama. I think the hermits noticed how popular the Logfellas roleplaying drama was and decided to turn that knob up for season 5 right along with the dungeon rate.
lol, if you get slow RAM modules you won't notice the difference either! You'll see it in the numbers benchmarks give you, but that's just about it.
It's all relative of course.
There is no doubt that apple has prototype ARM macs in the labs. They already ported the majority of the OS to ARM in the form of iOS, and the rest of macOS's NeXT heritage has been a highly portable architecture for 30 years. This is how they were able to surprise the world with Intel Macs in 2006.

The question becomes when/if they'll ever ship a product. If anything, I would expect a further hybridized\* product with both x86 and ARM chips taking on the role of high power/performance and low power/performance applications.

\* the 2016 Touchbar MacBook Pro's are already hibryd products - that touchbar is running all off an ARM chip.

Maintain a spreadsheet of your AM/FM radio presets. ~~If~~ When the head unit drops your presets, you can quickly reference your spreadsheet to re-apply them.

I don't think it's possible to be lazy/non-rush a new production line on a new platform. Growing pains are bound to happen in such a situation regardless of who is doing the manufacturing. And of course, you're going to be bleeding money until you can start selling. Case in point from the opposite end of the spectrum: Both Tesla Model S and Model X have had endless production problems.

I've been corrupted. I heard Movie Dobby's voice for those quotes..... Guess I need to dig up those Jim Dale audio books again.
Yup, mine was done a week or so ago. And a Head Unit recall a month or so before that. I'm expecting another HU update at some point, but no idea if that will be recall worthy at that point. I also only got my letter for the first recall 2 or 3 days ago.
Are you kidding me? I was in complaining with less than 200 miles on the clock! Two recalls later, the head unit is still crash prone, and given how frequently they are lost I don't bother setting more than the 1st page of radio presets.

The car drives great though. Puts a grin on my face when I'm on a mountain road, and eyesight is amazing.

As annoying as it is to have issues with a new car, the pragmatist in me recognizes that they have only been in production for a few months, and issues are bound to come up early in the run. It's the early adopters tax. Or maybe the beta tester's tax.
The software behind the head unit is unstable. It has lost the AM/FM presets 4 times over the course of 4 months and 1000 miles. It has exhibited other buggy behavior (thought admittedly, less often after the recall) such as odd carplay feeze-ups and reboots, and before the recall update it even dead locked once. couldn't change the tuning source or volume and the image from the backup was frozen on the screen.

macOS, watchOS, tvOS, phoneOS, padOS. It would certainly make a complete set, and allow the iPad to truly mature into a proper platform not held back by the iPhone.

I'm not holding my breath though. 
Agreed. I want the iOS 6 music app back. Then again, I also want the Mac OS 9 SoundJam MP back, although that era of iTunes wasn't so terrible either.
I wonder if they're having headunit headaches like me and are trying to decide if they can recommend the car based on that. They've non-reccomend over less.
The first visit was me being extra paranoid because i bottomed out the car in the first 200 miles, so i had them perform a complimentary inspection, with a focus on the suspension and whatever damage i may have caused (all cosmetic happily!)


The second visit was for the initializing issue, and it really pissed me off. They brushed me off with "Yeah, I've seen that. Wait for a firmware update." and didn't even check me in. The least they could have done was call me before my appointment and tell me that so that i didn't have to take a chunk out of my day over it.

The third visit was the 1st recall where they installed the firmware update on the head unit.

The fourth visit was the second recall where they installed the ECU update. I mentioned some of the odd head unit behavior, and how I would prefer it to behave for some features (like staying silent rather than reverting to radio), and they set me up with a followup (tomorrow) to get those properly documented. The radio decided to "initialize" for the 4th or 5th time in between visits.
Yes. I have an ongoing case with SOA, and have my 4th (or maybe 5th) dealer visit tomorrow. I've now put over 1000 miles on the car, and the presets reset for the 4th time last weekend!
As a long time PalmOS lover, I regret never owning a WebOS device. I could see the potential, and I could see that it was being held back with underpowered hardware. Unfortunately, Palm was already in a death spiral and had to rush the hardware. HP's stewardship of WebOS was a disgrace (just like everything else HP has done in the last decade). At least LG put it on some TVs.
If anything, Microsoft was [too early](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_PC) in mobile. (then again, so [was Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Newton "eat up martha")!) But their answer to iOS was indeed very weak.
LG: please dust off WebOS! modern SOCs should run it quite well!

Samsung: Please grow a pair and ship Tizen on a flagship phone.


That is all.

The good news is that Microsoft was able to salvage that effort with WSL and Bash on Windows 10. If you do enough spelunking, you'll even find references to whatever the codename was for the Android project deep in the bowels of WSL.
Yeah, running it locally with whatever the default memory allocation is resulted in it not crashing, but sitting on the loading screen forever. Then I tossed it on my local server (don't know why i didn't start with that), and gave it 2G, where it loaded but suffered from terrible lag. Once I set my server to 4G, everything is butter smooth unless i'm flying fast and need to wait for chunks to load.
The marketing when they introduced the global platform indicated that both a proper hybrid and a full electric are in the works

Mechanically, the car is great. I love the paddle shifters, and the interior is a big step up from the 2014 Forester I stepped down from. Eyesight is also quite handy in stop & go traffic.

The new car-play enabled head unit has been nothing but a big ball of fail. The radio presets get lost to "Initializing" every couple hundred miles, and the software is crash prone, especially if someone thinks about touching the phone (or you take a curve quickly and momentum touches the phone) which causes the fragile lightning connection to break. Also, for some reason pandora opens on my phone and takes over from the Podcasts I was listening to about one in 10 engine starts. When everything is behaving, the head unit is great, but it's pretty unstable, even after a safety recall firmware update.

What would I change: I got the premium trim, and the bits from the upper trims I wish I had were the fancy color screen in the center console (the forester had this), active torque vectoring (only on the sport trim) and the fancy LED headlights (only on the limited trim).

In addition to the above changes, I wish that the backup cam would come on at full brightness if the headlights are on. Turning on the headlights dims the screen, as it did the video display on the Forester. However, putting the car in Reverse brightened the Forester display back up, which does not happen in the Impreza. It makes it hard to see the backup cam when i'm backing out of my garage. Also, the ride hight. I wish it was maybe 1 or 2 inches higher. I've scraped it on left turns into parking lots a handful of times. This was something I did not consider when I picked the Impreza because I've never had to worry about it before -  I've always driven taller cars!
There are FIVE posts!
It's something else to go from Eyesight powered adaptive cruise control on the highway to paddle-shifter powered manual control on mountain roads and back! :)
The shift lever can go between M and D. When it's in M, it's fully manual until you switch it back to D. When it's in D, you can use the paddle shifters to override the current setting, and then it's in manual control for a little while. It seems to switch back to D on its own when you try to go out of the power band appropriate to the gear your in - most of the time. I did recently find myself stuck in 2nd gear expecting it to kick back over to D, and it didn't. I quickly flipped it to M and back to D for it to behave itself.
Xisuma did that because he did a ton of grinding in the end and didn't need any more shulker boxes.
The paddles feel pretty smooth, and the fine grained control vs D-L on the forester is fantastic. Engine braking is so much smoother. I learned how to drive on a manual transmission (and it's been many years since I drove stick), but it's quite a bit smoother than I could have done when I learned to drive. It's also smoother than any traditional automatic I've driven. When in full D mode, the CVT has been tweaked to rev more like a traditional AT. I could go either way on that one.
I moved down from a Forester to an Impreza. The lower ride hight makes a huge difference. There's a lot more being blinded by oncoming headlights, and I have managed to scrape the underbody a few times on left turns into parking lots.

I don't think the forester had much getup, and the Impreza is no different, with the exception of when either car is loaded up with people. While I could tell the difference in both cars, the Impreza struggles to accelerate a bit more.

The Impreza is definitely a quieter car. 

I can't comment on the manual gearbox in either car, but I must say that I absolutely *LOVE* the paddle shifters that the Forester didn't have.
Lol, good luck unsoldering the surface mount RAM for that upgrade, and also keeping your warranty.

Yes, memory compression helps to some extent, but when I put my heavy workload on each machine, my old iMac with 24GB of RAM kicks the ass of my MBP with a fixed 16GB of RAM. The iMac did have 32GB at one point, and I have looked at the numbers to see that the last 8GB makes no difference for my workload, so they got donated to an intel NUC. 

Fixed memory from the factory is fine for the consumer laptops, but it is a travesty for the ones which are labeled as Pro and marketed to the upper end of the spectrum, especially when they refuse to offer decent amounts of memories for *my* workload.
This right here is what drives me bonkers. Apple has always overcharged for memory. Now you have no choice but to pay that premium, or be shackled with a crippled machine.

Correction: Players must place their extra/discard hermitrons in the center chests. They get to keep the shulker boxes.

4 month owner of impreza premium here: the 6.5" head unit's carplay is just as good. The software across the line has been a tad flaky however. AM/FM radio presets are often (4 times in 1000 miles!) lost to "initializing" and the HU is crash prone enough to call for a full blown safety recall - the system was known to lock up (frozen image, unable to change volume, source or radio tuning) preventing access to the backup camera. Sadly, the software is still unstable after the dealer installed firmware update - I had a full blown reboot yesterday after some "spirited driving" caused momentum to toss my phone around and jostle the lighting connection.

Mechanically the car is great, but that's not what we're here to discuss.

Congrats on your new car, and hopefully you'll have better luck with your head unit than I have so far.
Because the [last time we got to vote on something like this](https://www.californiataxdata.com/pdf/Prop13.pdf), property taxes got locked down and fucked over state funding.
FWIW, they're also raising registration fees on electrics to offset the non-consumed gas.

Nobody bought the Saturn because it was a $700* system and nobody had it in stock. Also the 32x fiasco.

I put my car in park, get out and open my garage. \^_^

My 2014 forester had homelink, but I had to keep my clicker with me anyway because the only way in and out of the garage was through the main door. New garage has no opener, and new car doesn't have homelink.

A couple years ago, I attempted to go Linux (whatever the contemporary Fedora was, due to near relation to the rock solid CentOS we use on our cloud servers) as my daily driver and I was simply less productive. My test failed after less than a year when a yum update rendered the machine unbootable. Completely agree about not using Windows for my daily driver. I put it on my game machine, and I only tolerate it there because games are mostly only targeted to Windows.
I wouldn't call that a redesign. I'd call that an appliance. DO NOT WANT.
it's all dust in the wind until Pascal drivers ship.
Just _**sell** me a white-label macOS_, and let me build my own machine to my own needs. Apple has proven time and again that all they want to make are integrated appliances, and those do not meet my needs.

Edited for clarity. hackentosh is both unsupported and a license violation.
nVidia has also been purged from the mac line for at least a year now. There are still no macOS drivers for Pascal!

Actually, it's a pretty decent emulator. I cleared the first level of Sonic Spinball without effort. Then I opened Sonic CD and after first being impressed with the quality of the FMV, I was wishing I had a turbo button because it was running at 160 FPS. I never knew Sonic could move so fast!
Good to hear. I'm not paying $5 a second time for a 2nd set of iOS ports. Disappointed to see that my original purchase has gone to /dev/null. Just like the good port of Mega Man II (But at least now I have the shit port of Mega Man II... Lite, so I guess that's less than /dev/null).
Apparently, I won't get "Sega Classics" because it's already in my library, but the "Sega Mega Drive & Genesis Classics" In my steam library does not include any Sonic games, and there is no "Sega Classics" in this package…

I feel like I'm about to be denied Sonic 1, 2 and Spinball. Anyone have any ideas?

Edit: I went through with the purchase, and Sonic 1, 2, 3 & Knuckles, Spinball and Dr Robotnic all showed up as DLC for "Sega Mega Drive & Genesis Classics", so I guess it's all good.
On the other hand, a bit of broken glass leaves evidence behind that your car was broken into. If a technically advanced thief (all he needs is a $15 RF repeater to make a weak signal strong) breaks into a proximity enabled car, you might just think you're crazy if something you thought was in your car goes missing.

Of course you could always wrap up your proximity key in aluminium foil, or a commercial or forensic faraday case.
But not the headlights or roof rails. The sport also has active torque vectoring which would be nice on my dream build.

Also, the reason I don't want the sport or limited: they have [horribly insecure proximity](http://www.techlicious.com/blog/toyota-prius-smart-key-hacking-remote-keyless-entry-thief/) keys. It removes the entire point of having a mobile storage locker.
Apparently the fancy LED headlight assemblies from the US Limited trim are $800 each, and from my reading installing them on the lower trim levels is a giant question mark. Otherwise, that's the one feature on the Limited trim that I wish was on my Premium trim. (That and the fancy information screen above the head unit)
Can confirm. The 3 or 4 times I've been through that pair of interchanges has been exactly as described. Now imagine doing it as a newbie in an unfamiliar car with satnav that randomly stopped giving directions. yeesh.

Yeah, the steering wheel button on the Subaru I got instead does work exactly as expected when the phone is plugged into usb. If i'm on bluetooth, it requires a long press to activate siri, so it's still not all wins.
I recently test drove a modern car which has both the button and carplay. The button only activated the car's shitty assistant. A long press on the carplay home button did activate siri though. Oh and there were teases for in car navigation, but they wanted you to sign up for OnStar before you could use it.
>  People complain about Google Maps not having a CarPlay app, but Apple isn't stopping Google from creating it.

Yes they are. Apple only allows two types of carplay apps: media and communications.

https://developer.apple.com/carplay/
It's not even the 3 most recent apps. It's the most recent audio app, most recent communications app, and maps. Works well enough for me, but I am still considering getting a cheap android phone (without service - just tether the iPhone) to try out the android auto experience.

Yeah, Subaru's StarLink telematics features (not to be confused with the StarLink touch-screen head-units) are all white-labeled on top of SiriusXM's telematics service. I wouldn't be surprised if the MySubaru app is part of the SiriusXM package.
And none of that iOS software integrates with CarPlay because apple has locked down the platform.
I don't think I said it was a defense. I said in one scenario, a violator receives a lawsuit without warning, and in another scenario, a violator receives warning and has a chance to modify their behavior before a lawsuit is filed.

If anything, the lawyer should have asked the litigator if they had talked to the violator before taking the case, and since they DID take the case, this raises ETHICAL issues, not LEGAL ones.
And by not confronting the violator, they are indeed "allowing" them to violate because they don't *know* otherwise. Litigation should be a last resort, not a blindside.
Step 1: sue.

Step 2: talk to the violator and politely ask them to stop.

Step 3: talk to the parents of the violator if the child continues to violate.


 - MURCA!
It sounds like the neighbors decided to litigate rather than simply talk to the child and/or parent, leaving the parent to speculate as to why the neighbors are such poor communicators.
I'm also not going to sweat it. Just making an observation. I also went ahead and deleted the beta profile and rebooted. Perhaps 10.3.1 will gracefully switch me back to mainline, otherwise an OS reinstall may be in my future.
Interestingly, my 14E5277a is not offering to update to the GM.... It says I'm up to date.
Meanwhile, I'm considering buying a shitty android phone just for google maps on Android Auto. Of course I understand that platform is just as locked down as CarPlay is, so I still won't be able to get ODBC/system status on my fancy touch screen.
> Siri - Support for checking car fuel level, lock status, turning on lights and activating horn with automaker apps

That'll go over like a lead balloon. My car-connected app requires a PIN and ages of time to do any action, and the entire "vehicle health report" is basically a list of which alert light on the dash might be lit during operation - no fuel level. 

Of course this might vary with brand and will probably only be integrated starting in MY2020 if CarPlay integration pace is any indication. And even then, I prefer to be locked behind a PIN to take any action anyway!
Except for the part where https://[mydomain].com hangs before it gets to any webserver.
I went to IKEA last year with the Forester I just traded for an Impreza, and the tabletop for my new computer desk barely fit inside. Had to scoot the drivers seat forward making the drive home kinda cramped and uncomfortable. I have no doubt that tabletop will not fit in my Impreza Hatch. Next time (assuming there is a next time) I'll have to figure out how to secure it to the roof rack!
The other factor to speculate on is that under the stewardship of any car company, this tech and patents would wither and die. Under the stewardship of Intel (or nVidia who in this segment, Mobileye competes with believe it or not), all the auto-companies can get this tech from an independent vendor. Same reason Bosch technology is in every car made in the last decade.

Bottom line is Intel sees major growth potential in mobileye and thinks $15b is a bargain to buy into this segment.

I have two sets of 3 numbers which are all over the place.

My fuel log for 2 tanks shows an average of 26.98 MPG.

My frist tank was 28.85 MPG and my 2nd tank was 24.76 MPG. The numbers behind the wheel showed 25MPG and 26.2MPG. The numbers in the center dash were completely bonkers at 19MPG and 18MPG. Both tanks were mixed driving, with the 2nd tank a little more city.

Early indicators for the 3rd tank are 33 MPG behind the wheel and 27 MPG in the center console. That was mostly 80 or so miles of freeway driving.

Of course keep in mind that the engine isn't done being broken in on my Premium Hatchback. I'm hoping that the center console numbers begin to approach reality, otherwise there is really no point in having this redundant display.
It turns full blown computers into locked down console appliances.

I don't know about in your case, but the Subaru head unit stays on for a while after turning off the car and opening the door. I found that out the hard way when it had a *hard* lockup while I was reversing, and the last image from the backup cam was frozen on the screen, even after stopping the engine for 5 minutes. It did come back to life the next time I drove, and the dealer has installed a new firmware update since then. The head unit is still buggy though. :(
I'm on a (buggy) Subaru OEM headunit, and have seen something similar. I have intentionally listened to pandora via carplay exactly once. Occasionally (maybe 10% of the time), my podcast will continue to play over CarPlay after plugging in and shortly after, Pandora will kick in. The funny thing is that if I'm on the Now Playing screen, it'll continue to show the podcast I was listening to (paused) and tapping play will stop Pandora and re-resume my podcast.

It could very well be the HU's built in Pandora Integration (which I don't think I have ever used) inadvertently triggering Pandora thanks to some other bug. This seems unlikely given the different brands of HUs though.
I have used the Utah DMV and the California DMV. The California DMV is a nightmare of waiting games, forms and repeat visits. The Utah DMV is literally walk up to your window and do your business. In and out in 15 minutes.

As it stands now, Sick Care is as bad as, or worse than the California DMV. If Health Care was anything like the Utah DMV, I'd take it in a heartbeat, but of course we all know that's not what will happen.
So it took me ages to actually find the download. Don't be like me. It's on http://hermitcraft.com under 'maps' on the sidebar on the left. 3.something GB.

For some reason, I spawned in Iskall's base, with his gear, but was locked out by claimed chunks. Anyone know how to unclaim all the chunks? ```/admin unclaim``` does nothing.
Pre update, I have seen the clock randomly reset, lost my radio presets 3 times (i made a spreadsheet after it did it the 2nd time), and had a complete hard-lock while I was reversing once. 

After the update, I can't play podcasts over bluetooth because it would continually cycle between play and pause. Car-play works fine though. I'm going to continue to monitor the situation. I too will be sad if I lose my presets again.

Oh, and I still have a bogus average MPG reading in the center console of 15mpg, while the screen behind the wheel reads 26 MPG. That tank is almost up to compare with reality, but last time around, reality was a full 2 MPG better than the reading behind the wheel.
The one time I was on Hydro, I was high as a kite, but it did nothing for pain relief. Not a particularly fun combination.

The guy at the service desk told me that they're all taking 2 hours and that the firmware is downloaded from the internet for each car. This explanation sounds fishy, especially since it only took you 30 min. Maybe my dealer uses dialup? It was at this point that I looked at the movies playing anytime soon and I wound up seeing A United Kingdom. It was a good show, but I could have waited to see it on the small screen. I got a text message that my car was done about 10 minutes from the end of the movie. 2 and a half hours for me. 

My one drive home was uneventful. All the radio presets were wiped again. This time I sat down and put all my presets in, rather than the abbreviated set last time. Did I mention that I put my radio presets into a spreadsheet? This is now the 3rd time I used it.
Daylight Saving Time. It is a net-drain on society as a whole, forcing the majority of the population to randomly change their schedule leading to among other things drowsy driving and poor productivity for two weeks out of the year.
And my axe.
Be careful with bulk updating your tags. I still see garbage in my library left over from a bulk update I did a decade ago.
It's such a shame that a Blizzard came along and sucked all the air out of the room which was occupied by that war themed hat simulator.
Probably because the potential loss of the backup cam (it happened to me once when the entire head unit locked up!) is a safety issue, so they have to go through the safety recall protocols to make sure everyone is notified.
How long did it take you to get the update applied? I've been seeing reports of 2+ hours. My appointment is tomorrow, and I'm trying to figure out what to do with my day. Maybe I should catch a shuttle to the near by movie theater and see Logan again.
Overall, the two players are quite similar. The devil is in the details. Overcast's claim to fame is indeed the audio processing to cut out pauses, and tweaked EQ or other effects for voice optimizations. Overcast also has a nice web component, but there is lots of room for improvement there. 

Castro's inbox/queue/archive metaphor is very clean, and I get the impression that Marco was trying for something similar with Overcast 3. They both have the ability to queue new episodes at the top of the queue. Ontop of the playback queue, Overcast still hast playlists and is quite flexible in controlling what podcasts go in what playlist(s). This also muddies the waters and makes the entire app a little more complex than Castro.

Castro also lets me toss new episodes to the end of the queue and has nicer push notification popups. Overcast pops up notifications for new episodes sooner than Castro does though.

Both apps have OK support for CarPlay. I don't drive enough to critique either app here, but I have seen a lot more spinning wheels on Overcast 2 than Castro. 
After using Overcast since 1.0 (yes, i paid for it!), I just switched to Castro when the new version shuffled the UI. I figured it was a chance to try out the competition. While it doesn't have the smart speed feature, I actually keep it a notch higher in playback speed, so I may be saving some time. The one thing Castro doesn't have which bums me out is the voice booster feature. It's simply harder to hear Castro podcasts over the speaker in my shower (first world problems).
Telecommute, avoid the highways at all costs during rush hour, live (and work - see above) on the outskirts of the population mess. If all else fails, self driving car (or at least adaptive cruise control)
My '17 Impreza had dealer plates installed, and when I put the state plates on, the holes looked like they were there from the factory. My '14 Forester's dealer plates were in holes that looked to be drilled by the dealer separate from some factory holes.
That'll do me no good. I have oil changes rolled into my lease!
My appointment is for Saturday. My head unit has dropped its list of favorite station presets twice, randomly reset the clock once and locked up while I was reversing once.  And I only have 520 miles on her! Saturday can't come soon enough.
