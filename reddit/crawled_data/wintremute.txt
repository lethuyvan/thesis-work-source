I'm part of the GenX generation.  We job hopped instead of staying with a company because that was the only way to get raises.  We got hit by 3 major recessions, started late, lost what little retirements we had saved, and started over.  In the 19 years of my career, I've been laid off 4 times with extended periods of unemployment. I raided my 401k multiple times to pay my rent. I have no illusions that I will ever be able to comfortably retire.  

I have a good job now and I plan to stay,  but again, I'm starting late.  I'm basically at 10 years instead of 25.  I'll work until I die, or until I'm unable to work and will have to depend upon social programs.

Back in championship form, I see.
Holy shit this is starting to happen to me.  I've been taking Tramadol for over a year now, putting off a hip surgery I can't afford. I've never had these symptoms before this, only some mild bipolar episodes.  The Tramadol gives me crazy wild vivid dreams, but sometimes I dream mundane things that I later think were real.  For example, last month I remember cleaning out my refrigerator.  I remember scrubbing the dried food from the corners, every bit of it.  The next evening, I opened the fridge and broke down in tears when I realized that the fridge hadn't been cleaned.  I dreamed the whole thing. It seems so real... I remember every bit of cleaning it.  It's terrifying to think I might be losing my mind. I can only hope that when I can stop these meds the symptoms will go away.

The camera speed tickets here in Tennessee are unenforceable because they aren't ran by the police. It's a private company. We throw those tickets in the trash. They even say in bold type "Non-payment of this fine cannot be held against your credit, points on your license, or reported to your insurance carrier." In other words, it's a bullshit scam to scare people into paying. The city gets a cut of the money so they allow it to continue.

Probably varies from one region to another. In my part of the rural US south farm country, the first thing you described is a trailer, the second one is a wagon. The wagon has its own steering axle and is therefore not "semi-articulated".  Language variations are a weird thing.

Testimony is immune to NDAs. She can tell-all on the stand at any one of many future trials, including divorce proceedings. 
Her book deal and movie rights will be woth more than whatever % of Trump's debt she could ever get.  Regardless of any contract she always has the right to a divorce. 
From the pattern, I'd guess early 90s.  Country blue was a damned epidemic at the time.
We should start a GoFundMe to fight this... Oh, wait...
Too late. The intended audience already believes it and no amount of evidence will change their minds.  They don't want truth, they want warm fuzzies from having their biases reinforced.

Absolutely this.  If you have special dietary needs don't expect the world to cater to you.  In fact, you should probably stop eating out all together unless you *know* the menu has something you can eat.  I'm not de-breading your fried chicken, or changing the fryer oil because it's had shellfish in it.  Go home and eat a salad.
This is why I live in BFE.  4br, 2ba, 2 car garage, 24x36 workshop, on 2 wooded acres. I paid under $120k in 2014.  My salary goes a hell of a lot farther here than it did in the city where I couldn't find a tarpaper shack for under $300k.

Not only the first 16 to beat a 1, but also to do it twice in one tournament?
I was caught a bit off guard that we had broken 90.  We really didn't run the score up, just pulled away.  The flip side of that, we gave up 75. D was not strong tonight (other that some nice blocks).  Pull that against almost any other team in the tourney and we lose.

He could have just let the guy retire, but no... he had to fuck him out of his pension.  Why?  Because he's Trumpy and Trumpy does whatever Trumpy wants to ensure that Trumpy wins. <punchable smirk>

WKMS had an interview with... someone, I forget who.... involved with the investigation and that was his main talking point. 
It happens here in the US south too on a much lesser scale.  The local headlines about the Marshall County High School shooter (local to me) are all about how he's a atheist and believes that life has no meaning, and that's why he shot 14 people, killing 2. It's a total PR campaign by the churches.

I grew up on a tobacco farm.  When I was 9 years old (in 1985), my father decided to "teach me to farm". I was given my own acre of farmland to use, and we planted it in Burley tobacco.  I worked it all spring and summer, bought chemicals and fertilizer on credit from the co-op.  Dad fronted pay to the folks we hired to help with the labor.  Come December, we took the crop to market and after expenses, my profit was $5000.

Instead of reinvesting the money in the farm, I bought a computer (Commodore 64).  I decided at 9 that farming was too damn hard work and I was too smart to waste my brain in laboring.  I spent the rest of elementary and high school learning all I could about computers.  I went to college on a scholarship and got a CS degree. I also stayed current on as many tech certifications as I could.  Today, I'm the lead IT Administrator for a multi-national manufacturing company, and tobacco farming is only done by the largest factory farms that can sell it wholesale. 

The smartest thing I ever did was say, "Fuck being a farmer!"

Im a Liberal and I own guns. This bullshit is exactly why I'm opposed to the NRA.  I believe in responsible gun ownership and comprehensive safety training.  It's way too easy for the wrong people to get a gun in the USA. The background checks are a joke, and criminals just buy their guns from other criminals... When they have to. It's painfully apparent that many mass shooters passed background checks and bought their weapons "legally".

I don't claim to know the answer to stopping gun violence, but we need to invest in finding a way to stop this from happening. Is it mental health? Yes.  Is it gun policy? Yes.  Is it complacency? Yes.  Stop pointing fingers at the "other side" and work together to find a solution that doesn't punish law abiding responsible gun owners for the actions of these domestic terrorists.

A lot of rural electric companies are starting to roll out fiber.  I have 1Gb coming into my workplace in the middle of BFE nowhere.
We're trying to get at least 100mb connections to all of our sites for SD-WAN. The one in the most rural area has 1 option.  100Mb direct Ethernet from the power company @ $1947/mo + $2000 installation costs. Still cheaper than the 15Mb MPLS line they have now.  No cable, no dsl, and satellite companies won't work with us on our data requirements.  Oh well, not my money.

They refuse to see that the majority of SNAP recipients do have jobs.  The largest employer of those recipients?  Walmart.  The favorite child of uber-capitalism.  The largest grocery retailer to accept SNAP? Also Walmart.  

Walmart pays their workers so low that they need SNAP to pay for the food they then buy from their own employer. The real welfare queen is Walmart and the politicians it owns.

As in every other thread, we don't know if they were referring to the core or the feed. We just have to wait. Stop interjecting your opinions. 
I think they really didn't expect this response and now they're milking it.  My prediction: The core landed fine and they'll release footage of the drone landing tomorrow to a great hurrah.
The transmitter uses a lot of power, so I'd guess less than 24h unless they used the car batteries.  Then, who knows?  Anyone care to do the math?
Maybe in 6mo, if Mars happens to be there at the time, which it won't.  And the batteries will have long died beforehand. And it's too far to transmit from that distance with that equipment.  So, no.  Never.

I made an offer on a house.  The owner had a fax and no email. I had email and no fax.  So I would sign the papers, scan to PDF and email it to my realtor, who would print it and fax it to the seller.  Seller would then sign and fax to the realtor, who would scan the fax to PDF and email it to me. After going back and forth a few times the pages were unreadable.  I ended up withdrawing my offer because of it.  Ain't nobody got time for that.

I've got a 50s Danelectro combo amp for clean and an 80s Peavey Ultra head into a custom 1x12 cab for the rest. 4 channels, la di da.  Anyways... I use my volume knob more than my pedal board. This demo just says that it's great for recording solos.  Yay.
Yep, I'm coming from the same place as you.
This is more of a how-to construct than a recipe. No measurements at all. "Cook shit and put it together like so".
Could I bother you for a list of where you sourced your materials?  I'd like to make a table top version and that 80s woodgrain is awesome.  Now I need a couch with waterwheel mills on it.
Exactly 1.27 squirts.  J/K.  It's really a feel thing that you have to learn as you go.  Just know that you can always add more of something but you can't always take it away (although water is one of the few exceptions). After a few times you will get the lightbulb.  It's not rocket surgery.
It really varies for spices.  Some will drain away, and others need to cook with the meat.  YMMV.
Um, measurements?
Why in these demos do they spend the entire time noodling leads?  I mean, that's great but that guy's going to sound pretty damn good through anything.  Now can I hear a few chunky bar chords to get a feel for the gain characteristics?  How about rolling the volume and tone knobs up and down so I can check out the breakup response?
This North Korea shit - and yes I expect us to be in an armed conflict with them quite soon - is serving two purposes.  One, it distracts his base from the investigations.  Two, war Presidents get reelected.  It's his only chance of a second term.  He'll sacrifice the lives of thousands of Americans and possibly hundreds of thousands of Koreans just to keep his office, and the Party will back him all the way to Pyongyang and back to keep a Republican in the White House.
You see, he won and they should give up and give him everything he wants, because that's how Congress works.  How dare they disagree with him?  Don't they see that he won?

I'm from an as rural as it gets area of TN. The right wing churchy people are a majority here, but they are a minority in the US as a whole.  The biggest problem in the rural south is that the churches are very deep into politics and tell their flocks what issues to believe and who to vote for.  They are not the norm in American society.
Actually it isn't.  It's the rabid vocal minority's. Only 14% of the country voted for him, and he lost the popular vote by 3MM votes.  He's the least popular president in generations, and he'll probably die in prison.

I spent a summer in the high desert of Western Wyoming and my friends and co-workers were amazed that I'd continue working hard in 100+ weather.  To me, the dry air was a relief.  Yes, I drank *gallons* of water, but there was no miserable humidity.  It felt like a mild Spring day in West Tennessee.
Amen.  It doesn't actually solve anything, it just causes more problems for the people who love you.  It shifts your misery to everyone else. If anything else, please know that your death will hurt the people you love more than it will hurt you.

Apparently Reddit has an angsty hardon for suicide.  Fine. Bye, cowards.  Make your mama cry because you couldn't deal with life.  I'll be over here recovering and living a life.

Thank you for sharing this.  It's the brutal truth some people need.  I've battled depression my entire life and I come from a long line of other sufferers.  This is no joke, I have lost ~~3~~ 4 uncles, 4 cousins, and 3 friends to suicide.  There have also been a few "accidental deaths" along the way, and I only know my family history back to my grandparents and their siblings, so there's probably more.  It's easy for me to call these people cowards or say they just gave up, but I have myself been in the depths and I know how helpless it feels.  Maybe your post will help at least one person wake up and realize the trauma suicide causes to not only yourself, but also to your family and friends. Help is available if only we can get them to seek it.

Edit: 4 uncles if you count my aunt's second husband, whom I barely knew.
Par for the course for this administration.
No joke, I ordered a BLT sub "plain" at the Subway drive through and when I got back to work it was just fucking bacon on fucking bread.  I called the store and the guy was like "What? You said plain, brah!" I had to educate him that BLT stood for bacon, lettuce, and tomato, because he really didn't know that.  People wonder why these jobs are being replaced by robots...

How do you access them when the batteries die?  "Oh no! There's a mass shooter rampaging in my office!  I have a gun in my hidden compartment, but the batteries are dead! The humanity!!!"
Also distance is a problem.  It would take me 12 hours straight of driving for me to get to DC, and I'm only 1/3 of the way across the country.  Anyone from the West coast would have to spend $1000 or more for a last minute flight just to get there to protest.  People hold local rallies, but no one pays any attention to those.  If you want your protest noticed, you have to do it in DC.

Bzzzt!  Wrong.  Try again, political troll. Management isn't (usually) a member of the union.  That's for the workers.  The union is why those jobs pay well and have good benefits.  You know why so many jobs suck and have shitty pay, and no benefits nowadays?  Because right-wing hacks like you killed the unions that protected them.  My father raised a family on his union factory job with only a high school diploma.  My wife and I have college degrees, and the corresponding debt, and both have to work to have the same standard of living that a single income would have given us 35 years ago.  So before you spout the seig-heil of the "conservative" party, remember that the only thing they conserve is corporate profits at the expense of the workers. Unions fight that.  You like 40-hour weeks?  Paid overtime? Vacation days?  Sick leave?  Thank a union worker, because without the men and women who fought *and died* for those things, you'd just be fired the next time you catch the flu.

Exactly what happened to me with my left hip.  I literally woke up one day and it was hurting.  Went to the doctor and took X-rays and found out that I had stage 4 avascular necrosis.  3 weeks later I had a hip replacement at age 40.  That was 18 months ago and now I need the other one replaced.  Since then I've gained about 40 lbs.  Combination of lack of exercise and opiate pain meds that make me hungry all the time.
I'll hope one of those 27,000 people is a urologist that can reverse my vasectomy, then get to populatin'.
False dichotomy. A better example is alcohol prohibition.  When it was made illegal it created a black market, mafias, and unsafe, unregulated liquor that blinded and killed its drinkers.  People will find a way to get what they want regardless of the law.  Murder is and has always been illegal, and no one is advocating otherwise.  Abortion is a protected right per SCOTUS and Roe v. Wade.  And no, abortion *is not* murder.  There are decades of case law to this fact.  Just because you feel that it is, does not make it so.  Your opinions are not equal to opposing *facts*.

Eh, don't sweat it.  I started losing my hair at 19 and it was gone by 28.  Just accept it and go for a short style that complements your face.  Too many people are hung up on hair.

If that's the case then it's not up to code anyway and should be reported.  You can't have multiple rooms and outside lights on one circuit.

I hereby claim copyright on the note A-440.  Pay me.
Ya, Mon!
1. Have a bone marrow transplant waiting. (Or some of the patient's own).
2. Nuke the patients marrow, no immune system.
3. CRISPR in a bubble. 
4. Transplant.

Overly simplistic, but it could work.
The fact that half the population has an HD movie camera in their pocket and none of them has filmed aliens is pretty good evidence that there are no aliens around.
They believe what they want to believe and no amount of evidence will change their minds.  Works the same with crazy religious nuts too.
When you have Alzheimer's disease and aren't capable of doing your job, but your handlers won't let you quit because it'd be bad for them.
I lost 10 pounds in one afternoon! Ask me how!
It would start a witch hunt to find out who the friend was.  
Thanks.
It doesn't hurt us personally, it's just wrong and bad for the children. We don't plan to move because we both have good jobs (financially) in a low cost of living area.  We considered moving to the city, but the cost of living is so much higher that we would be taking effective pay cuts even with the higher wages offered there. And I can always buy alcohol in another town since I commute a rather long distance.
I've discussed it with her, but she is afraid of losing her job if people find out it was her or me.  This is a tiny little town where everyone is in everyone's business.  She won't even be seen buying alcohol for fear that a parent might see her and try to get her fired.  Small town redneck churchy bullshit.
Absolutely. My payment on my 4br 2ba house on 2 acres with 2 workshops in the country is less than rent of a 2br 1ba apartment in Nashville.  I'll commute, thanks.
I'm also in the south.  My wife's public school begins every morning announcement with a prayer.  
It's not the first time.
It's pretty much the norm in IT.  I've turned down a (rather shitty) severance package because the NDA would have hurt my future job prospects.  They can go fuck themselves with that 1 month salary and benefits.
Thousands of jobs for the housekeepers and landscapers of the CEOs who pocketed the profits.

I see I've cought the eye of /T_D.  Suck it, donflakes.
Speak for yourself, skinny.
I'm in Tennessee and I haven't seen a gas attendant since the early 80s.
This is exactly what I was referring to.  Thanks for answering.
So literally any chocolate.
May alarm didn't go off this morning.
They already passed a tax on states that didn't vote for Trump.  Why not this?
War presidents get reelected. 
It's his Ghaddafi starter kit.
And much of that money went to Trump himself because he was playing at his own resorts.  The Secret Service is paying him rent in Trump tower in order to protect him.
Buyers remorse.
When I see this I always think of music.  When it goes into a certain resonance, I wonder, is that a 3rd? A 5th? An octave?
I had pretty much the exact same experience in Kentucky.
That's more than my wife makes in Tennessee as an 11 year teacher.
One could argue that the ice age is why humans evolved to be the dominant species on this planet.
Thanks,

The lazy.

Possibly to be performed sometime before 2021.
Depends on if he loaded it or a dock crew.
Way to jinx it.

We call that the yellow snow effect.  Democrats could warn against eating yellow snow and Republicans would fight it.
I do around 100 miles a day. I have a good job that happens to be in a shitty area that I refuse to live in. Second, my wife has her job 70 miles in the other direction.  We live in the middle where cost of living is low. This is a very rural area and it takes 30-45 minutes to go anywhere. 
[Can't truss it](https://youtu.be/am9BqZ6eA5c).
Most are already independently wealthy and/or making millions in kickbacks.  The salary ain't shit.
I live in a very poor area.  All my Goodwill ever has is clothes and VCRs.
Is that the flight that Paul McCartney was supposed to be on but missed?  I sorta remember something about that, but it was 16 years ago. My memories of that week are older than some redditors.
Lens flare and overexposure.
How the hell did al pastor (of shepherds) get associated with pineapple? Seems unrelated.
That's a lot of dollar rims.
Without a reference wall, that settles nothing.  Maybe we are the wall.
Sue him.
Outsourced murder.
And vote for the GOP.
Methinks he doth protest too much.
Yeah liquor is pretty cheap in KY.  I think my last fifth of Bulleitt was $29. Luckily I work in KY, and in a wet county, so it's not a special trip.  Too bad I also have to pay KY income tax.
I read a report somewhere that something like 1 in 18 children aren't the children of their "father".  That's a lot of cheating.  I wish I could find that link again.
A major part of that is peer pressure from white evangelical churches.  The church pastors preach conservative talking points and threaten anyone who might disagree.  Vote Democrat, go to hell for supporting abortion and gays.  It really is that simple.
Education makes people more liberal.  They ask questions and look for evidence.
I don't think this info will help me much in West Tennessee.  In my entire 42 years of life, it's only ever been cold long enough here for me to walk on ice **once**, back in the late 1980s.  Nice to know, though.
No, theirs just stop taking a charge to force you to upgrade.
Made by Harmony.  That one is early 60s. They're good guitars if the neck will adjust straight.
Probably a step drill bit.
He was delicious.
"Elections".  They don't need meddling. It's just a "Do you love Putin?" poll.
Ok, well that would be good.  Nice to hear.
Because you touch yourself at night.
It's because they were still dressing the same in the 80s and 90s, and you associate that look with old people.  I do it too.
Now people just slice golf balls into the sea.  Pleasure pollution.
"Jesus, Ethel! Cover yourself!"
*Crucio!*
So does that require a particulate filter or SCBA?  Is that a Low-O environment?

/Just re-upped my respirator cert this morning.
Splinched.
Chemicals.
Permanent until it's eventually repealed.  We've reached a point where we have two sets of laws in the US. One for when the GOP is in power, and another when it's the Dems. Back and forth.
I remember a satirical "news" story about how Obama was to give a speech warning children not to eat yellow snow, and how the GOP was preparing its response touting the conservative value and cultural importance of eating yellow snow, for Jesus.  Seemed hilariously insane at the time.  Now I wouldn't bat an eye if Trump was to issue an EO making yellow snow the official snow of MAGA.
Please inform the American South.  Churches run everything here.
I rarely ever carry cash.  By the end of the year I'd have maybe $20.
I expect the biggest impact in the near future to be in long-haul trucking.  That's somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.5 million well paying jobs in the US alone that will disappear because of automated trucks.  There will still be a need for short haul drivers, but the pay will be much less. Likely not even full-time.
Inform him that yes, there was a mistake and you should not be working for people who lie to you.  That's about all you have.  It sucks, but without an actual employment contract it's just his word vs yours.  Just remember that if you quit you don't get unemployment.  Make him fire you.  Good luck with a new job.
Prisoners don't have a lot of income.
Give the boy a red card.

Damn, I 'bout broke my thumb hitting upvote.  You're a good brother.
Excuse my childishness, but... LOCK HIM UP!!!
That's waiting for the other companies to come move their lines to the new pole.
This is almost a form of self-harm.  Like arm cutting for spoiled little rich girls. "I hate myself and my life.  I'll get butt implants."
Plastic.
As an inhabitant of the American South, I find this disturbing and unnatural. Then again, we panic and die over 1" of snow.
This is known as a coincidence.
Everybody aboard the Yam Bus!
I have internet-only from the cable company, which is my only option.  Well there's satellite, but that's not really useable for me because of the data caps.
Im internet-only and my bill goes up $5-10 every six months like clockwork anyway.
Pretty much a weekly occurrence in my home town.
You must not have cats.
Work my fields and try not to die of dysintery.

It's called fusion generation because it's always a generation away!!!
Thermonuclear bombs (H-bombs) are fusion.  Who's the fool?
We need to standardize the sarc mark. 
That's what happens when you put glorified burger flippers in positions of authority.
We call that the fuck it bucket.
Sorry, bro.  Your day will come.
When a gang of gays kicks the shit out of a conservative just for walking down the street then I'll have some sympathy.  Right now you're just upset that people are treating you the way you treat others.
Fall begins on or about Sept 23.  There's plenty of fall baseball.
As a Kentucky alum, the seasons are MLB and College Basketball.
Not me.  I worked in banking IT.  It's bullshit to be crawling in a ceiling pulling cables in a damned tie and slacks.
Sounds good to me.  I'll try it.
Wow, I've never heard of it, and I'm from the Memphis Area where we will literally rub *anything* on our meats. I'm definitely ordering some.  Amazon has Jada, Chippy, and Matani brands.  Which one do you Aussies recommend?
Chicken and sushi just has me picturing raw chicken breast rolled up in nori and rice. Mmm... salmonella rolls.
Cavender's Greek Seasoning is amazing as well.  Makes a great season salt, and also a great veggie dip.  Just add it to sour cream.
Pouring one out for Steve Irwin.
Yeah, I know.  It was a joke.  I think it's really just some great advertising.  They need a dummy load, why not a Tesla?  I'll add the /s.
They appear to be lift points.
This just helps to confirm my suspicion that Elon plans to take a one-way trip to Mars at some point.  He's going to want his things.

Edit to add: /s
Actually it's both, and it's awful, yo.

Lincoln, cane, helmet hair... Just another day of our elderly problem in the US. There are so many of them, and soon to be so many more.
How is it interesting?  It doesn't give any details, but just states that a document exists.  [Here is a Wired article that covers it well](https://www.wired.com/2007/09/mecca-in-orbit).
Heavy curtains.
If that was mine, that "luthier" would be paying the bill for a *real* luthier to fix it right.  Cough it up, ass.
Practice relaxing your throat a little more each time.
But not on the plastic.  I feel my face stuck to it now.
My grandparents' house was that way. Biggest room in the friggin house and it only got used at Christmas.
Makes my ass puke buttermilk.
But can he dunk?
That cinnamon shit ain't chili.
I live in a dry county.  All my liquor comes from KY.
My ISP (Spectrum) goes up by $5 every 6 months like clockwork.  It's currently $64.99.  I expect an increase on Jan 1.
When you wreck your old truck but the bed is still good.
That shit has 12 seasons?

Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Bernie Madoff!
Download a car and keep your dollar.
Organ amps.
Likely because they're no longer useful to him.
Hair spray and shoulder pads.
He always wanted a purple heart.
