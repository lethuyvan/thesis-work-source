Duck Duck Goose, Simon Says, and What Time is It, Mr. Fox? with my friends. With my family, the card games War and Slap Jack, and something that had no real name. We just referred to it as "the hand-slap game". You and one other person stand facing each other, hands out, palm-to-palm but not touching. The one whose palms are upturned needs to quickly bring one or the other hand (or both!) around to slap the back(s) of the other person's hand(s), which are palm-down. The other person needs to twitch their hand out of the way to avoid getting slapped. It really develops the reflexes!

Yeah, it's not clear to me whether it's aimed at River or at Jayne. The phrasing is ambiguous (his use of the word "innocent") and it seems completely without context (he and Jayne had been discussing celibacy and sexual urges).

Your comment about residual emotion does make sense, if his thought was indeed aimed at River. Either way, it's a very interesting (read: tease! tease! tease!) bit of characterization for Book, not so much hinting as screaming that he's not quite what he appears, but leaving us wondering what exactly he is.

So far, so good!

Some do, some don't. It entirely depends on what your entertainment budget is and how much money you're willing to spend on a mobile game. Some people have the disposable income, some don't.

If you go the freemium route, it will take time to collect the resources to advance. As long as it's not an event, there's no time pressure, and it's certainly not a race.

40 neighbors is an excellent start. To maximize resources gained during events, you need at least 10 neighbors. You get 3 friend actions per neighbor, and during events you get event currency (prize track and crafting) for your first 30 friend actions, which translates to 10 neighbors. But you can have up to 100 neighbors and event or not, you will get regular game currency, XP, and FP for all friend actions.

If you go the freemium route, just grind, grind, grind. The shorter the collection time on a building or a task, the more it proportionally pays out (four 1-hour tasks have a higher payout than one 4-hour task), but realistically you need to balance your real life into this. You don't necessarily have the time to just sit around babysitting your game and collecting all the buildings that are ready in a few minutes. Any character who isn't involved in the event, send them on tasks. Just grind and be patient. If you have characters that have tasks but they can also help with the event, prioritize the event. Events are limited-time things. Any non-event task can wait.

As you acquire more stuff, your Conform-O-Meter bonus will increase and boost your payouts. You can see what your bonus is by tapping the stars next to where it says what level you are.

Another option you have, which is safe but controversial, is to request assistance from the givers at /r/freedonuts. You're above level 15, so you qualify. Just be sure to read their rules and restrictions very carefully first. They're very strict about what they're willing and able to do and how often they're willing and able to do it.

Other general advice: If you ever get to level X and start wondering why you don't have access to a certain thing, it's because some things have quest-chain pre-requisites. Go through everything in your task book first and look through "The Store" to see if there's any item with its name highlighted in yellow. This means it's required to proceed in a quest line.

That depends.

In some languages, the gender of regular nouns is assigned purely from its phonology. If the word ends (it's typically the ending) in a manner typical of gender A, then it will be assigned gender A. For example, if a new word ending in "o" emerged in Spanish, Portuguese, or Italian, it would likely be parsed as "masculine" by native speakers because in those languages, the "o" phoneme is associated with the masculine grammatical gender. 

In an entirely different language with a different gender system, a new word might inherit its gender based on what it is. Say there's a language with a gender for "plants". A tree would be assigned "plant" by native speakers for readily transparent reasons. But say later their society invents the boat, which they make from trees. It's unrealistic that they would invent a new grammatical gender, so boats would inherit the "plant" gender. Boats are vehicles of transportation. If later on this language gets a word for "car" or "airplane", they will inherit the gender established for vehicles, which is "plant".

There is also a minimum karma requirement, along with a minimum account age, to be able to create your own subreddit.

Linguists don't talk about "proper" or "improper" use of language any more than biologists talk about "proper" or "improper" dogs. Linguists observe patterns of speech by native speakers of all dialects and collate the data to help understand how language in general works.

There is such a thing as a standard dialect in any given nation, but it is somewhat artificial. "Standard" is not synonymous with "correct" and "non-standard" is not synonymous with "wrong".

Dictionaries are nothing more than curated museums of how people tended to speak last year. They are not comprehensive nor are they meant to be prescriptive.

It is extremely common for a word to start off with one meaning, and then over time take on different meanings that either supplement or replace the original meaning. This is one of the core mechanisms of language change, which is both natural and inevitable.
It's not a glitch, it's a feature. Quests you haven't acted on for a while get stashed in the box to clear up room in the task book. You tap the box to open or close it.

It's best to have a solid idea for a subreddit before you dive in and make one. Subreddits cannot be deleted once created, and their names, just like usernames, cannot be edited. Moderating subreddits is a lot of responsibility once they get going.

But if you have a plan, then go to the reddit main page and look on the right side. On the old design it will say "Create your own subreddit" and on the new design it will say "Create community".

Once you've created your subreddit, you can find support at /r/modhelp.
To post pictures? That depends on the sub you're posting to. Some have high requirements, some have no requirements, some don't permit pictures to be posted at all.

To make your own subreddit? The exact amount is unknown, but it looks like between your account age (more than one month) and your combined karma (more than 100), you should be able to make your own subreddit.

Check out [Khan Academy.](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/exponential-and-logarithmic-functions/introduction-to-logarithms/v/logarithms) They have modules on all math topics.

To get you started, it's important to understand what logarithms are. Just as subtraction is the reverse of addition and division is the reverse of multiplication, roots and logarithms are the reverse of exponentiation.

Let's look at a simple equation: 3^(2)=9. 

There are two ways to reverse this. One is to take the square (2nd) root of 9: √(9)=3. In other words, what number raised to the power of 2 gets 9 ? The other is to take  log_3 (9)=2 ("log base three of nine is 2"). In other words, 3 raised to what power gets 9 ?

For 3^(7)=2187, we can ask what the 7th root of 2187 is, what number we multiply by itself 7 times to get 2187: ^(7)√(2187)=3, or we can ask what power we need to raise 3 to in order to get 2187: log_3 (2187)=7 (log base three of 2187 is 7). 

Having a solid understanding of what logarithms are will help the various rules make sense.

Ambiguity happens in natural languages. If you want a more naturalistic conlang, then I wouldn't worry about it.

That said, there are always ways of reducing ambiguity that don't rely on unique vocabulary. Even in English, we can eliminate the ambiguous pronoun referent by simply not using a pronoun. "Rob is nice to Andrew when Andrew is behind the counter" vs "Rob is nice to Andrew when Rob is behind the counter". Or you can re-cast it to be unambiguous even with a pronoun: "When Rob is behind the counter, he's nice to Andrew" vs "When Andrew is behind the counter, Rob is nice to him".

Take another good look at my example and compare it to yours.

You need the http:// or https://
1. Badges are just fun bits on the website that you get when you log certain milestones. They're nothing more than encouragements or a way of gamifying the experience. I've been doing NaNoWriMo for about 10 years (give or take) and I can remember when there weren't any badges. ("Badges? We don't need no steenkin' badges!" O:-))

2. Just hitting the minimum word count is not enough to "win". You need to officially verify your word count after winning has been enabled. You do this by **copy**-pasting your entire text into the designated box. Illiterate monkeys will count your words *and then delete the text*. It's strongly recommended to verify your word count often, because different programs have different word-counting algorithms (and LibreOffice is notorious for counting smart-quotes as words). You don't want a nasty surprise at the last minute. All that said, "winning" isn't the be-all, end-all. Sure, the website has some virtual goodies and a handful of sponsors have special offers for winners, but that's about it. **There is no shame in not "winning".** There's no stick here, only carrots. If you wrote more words than you otherwise would have, then you won. NaNo is about giving you motivation. Everything else is just gravy.

3. [Camp NaNo](https://campnanowrimo.org/about) is two separate sessions during the summertime: April and July. Same principles, different setup. For example, there are no prizes and you get to set your own word count goals. You also get partnered up with a handful of people in virtual cabins. This is just another way to have the social aspect because the only organized local events are in November.

4. There are some good resources in the sidebar here --> . I've used a lot of different programs, both cloud-based and off-line. [Yarny](https://yarny.me/) is a cloud-based, nothing-to-install poor man's [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview). (Scrivener, by the way, is one of the NaNo sponsors that gives winners a 50% off coupon for buying their software. They also have a special NaNoWriMo free trial version. [Normally the free trial lasts 30 days.](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/download?product=Scrivener) The NaNoWriMo free trial [lasts between set calendar dates](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/nanowrimo), which they adjust for the different instances of NaNo and Camp NaNo.) The other free alternative to Scrivener that's more robust than Yarny is [yWriter](http://www.spacejock.com/yWriter6_Download.html). I've also used [Zim desktop wiki](http://www.zim-wiki.org/). A lot of people prefer Google Docs. I will also use a distraction-free program such as [FocusWriter](https://gottcode.org/focuswriter/) for the actual writing, and then just transfer the text I produced into whichever program I'm using for the actual storage/organization. In the end, it's just a matter of trial and error to discovers what works best for you.

5. Just remember that the website is **NOT** where you keep your story! Also, make backups at least once a week.

 a. Definitely attend the local events in November! Write-ins are a great way to socialize and to really get your word count up. If you can't attend write-ins, there are plenty of virtual write-ins available online, hosted by the national NaNoWriMo Twitter account, your local NaNoWriMo Twitter account, probably various Discord servers...

 b. The rules (I prefer to think of them as guidelines because this is a personal challenge, not a contest) say that you can only count words written during NaNo per se. But you are strongly encouraged to plan/outline/whatever before NaNo begins. Of course, plenty of people love the thrill of "pantsing it" (flying by the seat of their pants, as it were) and going into NaNo with minimal if any idea of what they're going to do. Again, it all comes down to what works best for you.

 c. The philosophy behind NaNoWriMo is "You can't edit a blank page." You need to bind and gag your inner editor and lock it in a closet for the duration of NaNo. You are slinging out an initial draft. All initial drafts suck, this is a fact. Embrace this and find freedom in it. Let go of any expectations of quality and see where it takes you. Don't waste time fixing things, no matter what that thing is (but especially if it's spelling or grammar--seriously, save that for the final spit and polish). If you need to change a fact or event or anything, just make a brief note of it and retcon, retcon, retcon. Don't delete a single word you put down. The objective is to add to your word count, not subtract from it. By the same token, don't feel you need to write the story in the same sequence it's intended to be read. In this universe you're creating, you are a meta-god. You are a time traveler. Bounce around as much as you need to or feel like doing.

 d. Take advantage of non-busy days to get ahead. You will have busy days where you will struggle to get in any words at all. 

 e. If you're not having fun, you're doing it wrong!

Language is what we actually say.

Writing is just an artificial means of recording what we say.

The contraction "could've" sounds like "could of", and so there are some people who record it the second way instead of the first way. It is purely an orthographic issue. Same with "their" vs "there" vs "they're". They all sound the same, so some people record them interchangeably.

Grammar would be things like "two wugness" instead of "two wugs" or "Her gavingsed it to I" instead of "She was giving it to me".

No one has upvoted any of your submissions because you've done nothing but spam since you got here. The only comments you've gotten on your posts have been AutoModerator explaining why your post was removed.
Plugging your answer into the original problem and seeing if it's true is a great way to verify that your answer is correct.

For example: Say you were asked to solve 3x - 9 = 45. If you mistakenly did this:

3x - 9 + 9 = 45 - 9   
3x = 36   
3x/3 = 36/3   
x = 12

Then plugging x = 12 back into the original equation will get you

3(12) - 9 = 45   
36 - 9 = 45   
27 = 45

Obviously this is wrong, and this tells you that you made a mistake somewhere. So you start again and hopefully this time you realize that you subtracted 9 from 45 when you should have added it.

3x - 9 + 9 = 45 + 9   
3x = 54   
3x/3 = 54   
x = 18

Double-checking one more time:

3(18) - 9 = 45   
54 - 9 = 45   
45 = 45

This is true, therefore your answer is probably correct. This method works regardless of what kind of error you made. Maybe you didn't subtract where you should have added. Maybe you just calculated wrong, like saying 7+5=13 when really 7+5=12. This will still alert you that there's an error somewhere.
> I've been told that lesbians secretly want to be men and feminine gay men are basically women because they behave like the opposite gender.

Yeah... No. That's completely wrong. Who you're attracted to sexually and/or romantically has nothing whatsoever to do with personality or gender roles. It's a bit like saying that the reason why an adult likes chocolate is because they're childish. It's not just wrong. It's essentialist and homophobic. It implies (not so subtly) that women can only like men and men can only like women, and that this is the only natural and proper way of things. It's total bullshit.

> to qualify trans do I need to have physical dysphoria? As in strongly disliking my female body and wanting male body parts?

I'm not the best person to weigh in on this because I'm not trans, but my understanding is that being trans is a spectrum, and experiences of being trans are quite varied. You don't have to violently despise your body to be trans.

Trans people who aren't sure if they're trans or who worry that they "aren't trans enough" (whatever that means) are often pointed to the following resources:

* [The Null Hypothecis](https://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/04/17/the-null-hypothecis/)  
* ["That was dysphoria?"](https://genderanalysis.net/articles/that-was-dysphoria-8-signs-and-symptoms-of-indirect-gender-dysphoria/)   
* [Cisgender people: What happens when you question your gender?](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4hgcp8/cisgender_people_what_happens_when_you_question/)  

How you feel after reading these could be a decent measure of whether you're cis or trans. Trans people tend to relate to the first two links and find the comments in the third link mind-blowing.

**A salesman sells something at an 8% loss**   
If we take the units for granted, then you have the first part right. I would have set it up as the cost of the item is C and the selling price as 0.92C, but your way is equivalent. It's just a matter of what units we're working with. 

**If he had bought the thing at 12% less**   
Less than what? Less than C? It would help to see the original problem as given by the instructor (although if it's not in English, it might be less helpful to me). I'm going to assume it's less than C, in which case 88C is fine.

**And sold it at 26 more**   
This is badly worded. More than what? More of what than what? Does it mean he sold 26 more units? Is it supposed to say 26%? Does it means he sold it at (1.26\*88)C? Does it mean he sold it at 126C?

**He would have made a profit of 11(1/9)%**   
I'm a little confused by your notation here. Is `11(1/9)` meant to be a mixed number, read as "eleven and one-ninth"? Because it looks like multiplication, which would be equivalent to `11/9`. If it's meant to be a mixed number, the convention to use when no special formatting is available is to just leave a space: `11 1/9`. Absolute clarity is very important in scientific writing, and mathematics is no exception. I'll assume it's meant to be a mixed number based on the other comment.

**Find the new selling price of the item**

I've already made a number of assumptions. I don't feel confident going further with this until the issue with the 26 is resolved.

If you're in the USA, then your legal signature is whatever you used to sign your drivers license/state ID card. Say your name is Beatrice Elizabeth Helen MacKenzie. If your current drivers license displays your signature as `Liz MacK`, then that's your legal signature.

It's only for special things that require your full name (like a marriage license) that you'd have to sign fully as `Beatrice Elizabeth Helen MacKenzie`. And if the instructions are to initial it, then `LM` is all you need.

So if you ever want to change your legal signature, take advantage of the next time you renew your drivers license.
> So I'm seeing a psychiatrist for all those obsessive thoughts, and today I happened to tell him that I had a crush on my female friend, and he told me that there must be a 'male' or 'masculine' side of me, that's why I'm attracted to females.

You might need a new psychiatrist. The idea that homosexuality is the result of having an opposite-gendered nature somewhere in you is very wrong and quite outdated.

You seem to have the right idea regarding gender roles or stereotypical gendered preferences =/= gender.

Based on how you describe yourself in terms of identifying with female characters in fiction and not having any discernible dysphoria, it sounds very likely that you are not trans.

If you were a man, the reason you'd find romance with a man in it more relatable would be because you'd identify with the male character. From the sound of it, you don't relate to hetero romance stories because you're not attracted to men.

My father was never formally diagnosed, but after I was diagnosed and we learned all about Tourette syndrome, he realized that he had a mild form of it himself (and started suspecting his own father had a form of it as well, which all makes sense because there is a genetic component). There's nothing inherently wrong with self-diagnosing as long as it's done in an informed manner. (Also, I hope that after your consultation with your GP you'll get a referral to a neurologist.)

I don't have a huge issue with taking the easy route and telling other people that your tic disorder, which is very similar to but not necessarily Tourette, is Tourette. It's kind of like saying that you're from <major city> when in fact you're actually from a suburb about an hour away. It's a convenient reference point for those who don't need to know all the details, but it still gives them a rough idea of what's going on.

Remember that slope is rise over run, or height over length. Perpendicular means they form a right angle where they cross.

The slopes of perpendicular lines (except those that are parallel to the x-axis and y-axis) multiply to get -1. So if a particular line has a slope of 5/7, the slope of a line perpendicular to it will be -7/5.

Standard form of the equation of a line is y=mx+b, where m is the slope and b is the x-intercept, or the point where it crosses the x-axis. This point is (b, 0).

You're given 3x-5y=20 as the line that is perpendicular to the one you're looking for. We just need to solve for y.

First, we subtract 3x from both sides to get -5y=-3x+20.

Now we divide everything by -5 to get y = -(3/5)x + 4. The slope m is -(3/5), which means the slope of the line we're looking for is 5/3.

The equation of the line we're looking for is y = (5/3)x + b. We can solve for b by plugging in the point we're given, (4, -1).

-1 = (5/3)(4) + b

-1 = 20/3 + b

b = -(20/3) - (3/3)

b = -(23/3)

The equation of the line we're looking for is:   
y = (5/3)x - (23/3)

yo habl -o   
tu habl -**a**s   
él habl -**a**   
nosotros habl -**a**mos    
vosotros habl -**a**ís   
ellos habl -**a**n

`-ER` verbs like COM**E**R   
yo com -o   
tú com -**e**s   
él com -**e**   
nosotros com -**e**mos   
vosotros com -**e**ís

`-IR` verbs like VIV**I**R   
yo viv -o   
tú viv -es   
él viv -e   
nosotros viv -**i**mos   
vosotros viv -ís

Sending crooks to your friends' towns will definitely help them if they tap them in time, and it will help you regardless (although you get more if they do tap them). If they don't tap them, then it doesn't hurt them, it's just like you didn't send them at all.

No down side at all. They've had this mechanic in the game for a while now. Exactly who or what you unleash in friends' towns varies, but the benefit is the same: extra event currency.

As /u/sunshine_desserts said, when there's not a major event going on, you tap buildings or spray graffiti on certain buildings. These get you regular currency, XP, and FP, but graffiti will temporarily hurt the friend's righteousness score, until they clear it by tapping on it. Otherwise, tapping on buildings has the potential to help your friends because it reduces the amount of time it takes for the building to become ready to collect. Obviously, they only get that benefit if they tap it in time, but it certainly never hurts them.

Because the word to describe an animal in that pose is "salient". The field of heraldry is using a word that already exists. They're not inventing anything.

The sense of the word used more commonly (as in "She retold the story more succinctly, emphasizing only the most salient facts") derives from the original meaning of "jumping" or "leaping" because if something is salient, it metaphorically leaps out.

If you haven't read the original books, READ THE ORIGINAL BOOKS! There are so many awesome little things that just don't translate to the screen or simply got cut or changed.

This has to be one of the very few, very rare times when the show based on the books is more highly favored by the author than the original books. Daniel Handler had his brilliant idea that would tie everything together partway through the book series. His work as a writer on the TV show is his way of going back and re-writing the story with his idea implemented from the very beginning. I kind of hope he'll novelize the episodes as an excuse to re-write the books the way he wishes he did originally.

They're called linear equations because when you graph them, you get a straight line.

There are never more than two variables in a linear equation:   
`x`: This is your **independent** variable. That means the value of x changes directly.   
`y`: This is your **dependent** variable. That means that the value of y changes depending on what the value of x is.

The standard form of a linear equation is `y=mx+b`, where m and b are some constants. Neither x nor y are ever raised to any power (other than 1, trivially).

Then surely you know that minimal pairs are by definition not homonyms, and that suprasegmentals like tone are sufficient to create minimal pairs. 
Where the heck do you stick the pins?
It's not separate at all. It's a matter of (not) understanding how tone works. What /u/ambient-toast said is exactly equivalent to saying that the words "pat" and "bad" are identical, just with different voicing. Just because English doesn't have tone doesn't mean it's not meaningful in other languages.
Ooh... 
It is not "silly semantic pickiness" unless you believe that "pat" and "bat" are homonyms. 
I am also a native speaker. 
Perhaps it should be more explicitly pointed out: All *natural* languages are more or less equally complex overall.
Again, that's quite a leap to go from "I don't understand it" to "No one understands it."
Then they're not identical.

In tonal languages like Thai and certain dialects of Chinese, tone makes just as much difference as voicing (pat vs bat) or stress (CONflict vs conFLICT).
That's not unique to English and has nothing to do with language complexity. [All languages are more or less equally complex overall.](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/prx36/when_linguists_state_all_languages_are_equally/)
I'm using other words to explain it to you. There's a difference between "It doesn't make sense to me" (no shame in that) and "It doesn't make sense."
Think of it this way: You don't *have* to say "people whom I know" or "the chair that's in the hall". You can just say "people I know" or "the chair in the hall".

There's also the shorter version of this:

Could you clarify what you mean by "color is not innate"? It sounds like you mean different language populations perceive color differently. That is not the case. It's a matter of different populations dividing their semantic space differently and using different metaphors to describe colors. Language does not define anything. Populations determine how language is used.
No, folk etymology is kind of the reverse of that. It's when people make up a story for how a word came to be. It does not involve changing the meaning of the word.
Others have addressed the bulk of your question. I just wanted to point out that it's not a matter of switching the *letters*, since writing is just an artificial way we record language. Metathesis is a matter of switching *sounds*.

These days, letters just have capital and small forms. Once upon a time, some small letters had initial (start of word) forms and medial/final (middle/end) forms. The letter i even had a stand-alone form that resembled the capital form, kind of like how medial/final s resembles f (except it lacks the crossbar). This is why we capitalize the pronoun I.

So what is the answer?
It's pretty rare for a cis person to agonize over their gender as long as you have. It's pretty rare for it to end up being some form of OCD instead of being trans. In general, cis people barely think about their gender at all.

If you're able to, look for a counselor/psychologist who is knowledgeable/reputable in trans issues. That person can help guide you through your feelings and help you understand what your feelings mean.

In the end, only you can determine whether you're trans or not, but generally if it walk like a duck and quacks like a duck, it tends to be a duck.

You say you've had these feelings since you were 12. I'd wager that's when you started puberty. It's likely that this is when your body started producing hormones that your brain isn't wired to process. Left untreated, dysphoria can lead to depression and self-hating.

Again, if you're able, please see a counselor/psychologist who specializes in trans issues. They will probably be able to help you.
Well, what is the answer, then?
Maybe. But not all mobile devices/apps have that same problem.

There's a difference between gender and gender presentation. Someone can be gender A and have no problems presenting as gender B.

English isn't the only language that has syllabic consonants. Also bear in mind that spelling is just a way of recording what comes out of our mouths. Our spelling was standardized a while ago and it has not caught up with the natural, normal shifts that happen in pronunciation.

Anyhow: Not all syllables require a vowel for its center (nucleus). English permits sonorant consonants to act as the nucleus of a syllable: apple, butter, prism, and button are pronounced more like ap-l, but-r, pris-m, but-n. (I'll spare you the IPA.)

Some Slavic languages permit more obstruent consonants to serve as the syllabic nucleus.

The glottal stop (or plosive) is called that because it's located in the glottis, which is in the larynx itself.

It's not about should. It's about what comes out of a native speaker's mouth. 
/u/Shad0w2751 explained it very similarly to the way I explain it.

Addition has subtraction.   
If 5+4=9, then what is the solution to 9-5=? What number gets added to 5 to make 9? But the operation is symmetrical. You can also calculate 9-4=? What number gets added to 5 to make 9?

Multiplication has division.   
If 3\*4=12, then what is the solution to 12÷4=? What number gets multiplied by 4 to make 12? But the operation is symmetrical. You can also calculate 12÷3=? What number gets multiplied by 3 to make 12?

Exponents have roots and logs.

Consider 3^(2)=9.   
We can ask what ^(2)√9 equals. That of course would be 3. But the operation is not symmetrical. We can't get back to 3^(2)=9 by asking what ^(3)√9 equals.

But we can ask what power we need to raise 3 to in order to get 9, and that is where logarithms come in. log\_3(9)=2\* because 2 is the exponent applied to the base number 3 that gets us 9.

Generally, there are only two bases where the base does not have to be written explicitly: base 10 (you would just write log(100)=2) and base e (you would just write ln(x)=y). With or without an explicit base, it's always log() or ln() just as it's always sin() and cos(). The logarithm is a function and requires a parameter, which goes in the parentheses.

\* This is read as "log base 3 of 9 is (or equals) 2". The 3 is meant to be a subscript, but reddit/Markdown doesn't do subscripts.

It could be a second language issue. In many Romance languages, the word for "question" looks a lot like the English word "demand".
People like /u/Funkyldj who are saying that it's because it's a personal pronoun are wrong. As many follow-up questions ask, then why is that literally the only personal pronoun that's capitalized? No, it has nothing whatsoever to do with "you" and "he" don't always refer to the same person. We don't capitalize "me", and that's merely the object form of "I".

The truth is, it has to do with the evolution of English orthography (our writing system). Used to be certain letters had different forms depending on where they appeared in a word, similar to the differing forms of Arabic letters. [If you look at a copy of the Declaration of Independence, for example, you see word-initial and -medial lower-case "s"s that look a bit like "f"s, minus the crossbar](http://repealfisa.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/declaration-of-independence.jpg). This was getting toward the end of that practice, however. Earlier, more letters had more special forms, and "i" was one of them. When the letter "i" appeared by itself, the form it took was similar to the capital "I" we're familiar with today. Thus today, when all we have is one standard form of capital and lower-case letters, writing the single-letter pronoun "I" as a capital is a holdover from those earlier practices.

The rules vary from language to language, but it's normally the personal pronoun in the subject that gets dropped, usually because the verb conjugation lets you know what the subject is. It's rarely a matter of "any pronoun, anywhere". You need to consider whether it's really needed or if it's optional and its function can be served on a different word.

For example, "You are a woman" in Italian can be either "Tu sei una donna" or "Sei una donna".

But you don't need uniquely conjugating verbs to let you drop the subject pronoun. Japanese does not conjugate to person, and it also drops the subject pronoun.

A chapter should have an inner structure just as all the chapters together are structuring your book on a larger scale. It's not a matter of number, it's a matter of how well it's structured.

But here's the explanation:

In Chicago style, question marks and exclamation points only go inside the quotation marks if they're part of the actual quotation. Consider your first two examples.

> He said to me, "Do you like pie?"

"Do you like pie?" is the question that the guy asked. The question mark belongs inside the quotation marks.

> Did he say, "All is good"?

Re-phrased as a statement, we want to know whether he said "All is good." The thing he said is not a question. We are merely asking a question about what he said. The question mark belongs outside the quotation marks.

In other words, consider the scope of the punctuation. Which part is the actual question? The whole thing, or just the part inside the quotation marks?

The sentence about the robot is a question. The word "robot" is not itself a question. Therefore the second version is correct.

The sentence about pie is more complex than it seems at first glance. Both the entire sentence itself and the quotation are questions. But it goes against convention to use two question marks. You'll have to double-check this elsewhere, but if memory serves, the question mark goes in the first place it applies, which would be inside the quotation marks.

Simple question: Did you grow up together in the same house? If the answer is yes, you can NOT call yourself an only child. I don't *care* what your relationship with her is like.
Nice!
They've had this mechanic in other events before. You accumulate crooks in your own town (the bandit masks) and send them to participating neighbors by tapping the icon for it in the upper right corner. If you don't have the icon in the upper right corner, then you can't send crooks to that neighbor. If there is an icon, it will display the number of crooks you can send to that neighbor (usually a max of 10). This is not necessarily the same as the total number of crooks you have available to send out.
YES!!! :-D

No, you were right. The only time `?` and `!` go inside `" "` (or `' '`) is when they're part of the quotation. The other person was thinking of how American convention handles `,` and `.`.
It's because you can not compare this to growing up without another child in the house. I don't care if your sister is 100% pure evil, the fact remains that you grew up together. Regardless of your dynamic, that dynamic existed. You can disown her all you want, but there is someone to disown.

> What etiquette on cross posting your own video?

Cross-posting etiquette in general varies widely from sub to sub. Some prefer that you credit the original poster, although in your case that's you. Some prefer that you make no mention that it's a cross-post. Of course, that comes from before we had the ability to directly cross-post, when you had to manually just re-submit it to the other sub.

Basically, as long as it's on-topic for the sub (especially if it really fits in and doesn't just superficially tick the boxes) you should be fine. When in doubt, ask the mods of the sub in question.

Definitely get a referral from your primary doctor to see a neurologist.

On the one hand, you have the motor and vocal tics that get worse under stress. On the other hand, Tourette tics are usually described as "It's me doing it, but I feel compelled to do it and it's uncomfortable to resist the urge to do it", and tend to diminish while concentrating on something.
The first part is not useless at all. You are asked to calculate the whole based on a part of a part.

$1624 is 80% of his monthly charitable donations.   
His monthly charitable donations are 14% of his monthly income.   
What is is total monthly income?

Reality check #1 is that his monthly charitable donations are more than $1624, and reality check #2 is that his monthly income is even more than that. $203 is less than $1624, so that tells us that something went very wrong in the calculations.

The first question we answer is "$1624 is 80% of what?" You started off on the right track, but got off of it rather quickly.

We do start with X\*(80/100)=1624   
X = 1624\*(100/80)   
X = 1624\*(10/8)   
X = 1624\*(5/4)

100/80 = 5/4 which is greater than 1, which means X is larger than 1624. 

X = (1624/4)\*5   
X = 406\*5  
X = 2030

Your answer of 203 is off by exactly one order of magnitude, which means you made a decimal point error somewhere in your calculations, but you were otherwise on the right track.

But we're not done. We've only just calculated what his full monthly charitable donations are. We now need to calculate his monthly income.

The second question we answer is "$2030 is 14% of what?"

Y\*(14/100)=2030   
Y = 2030\*(100/14)   
Y = 2030\*(50/7)   

100/14 = 50/7, which is greater than 1, which means Y is larger than 2030.

Y = (2030/7)\*50    
Y = 290\*50   
Y = 14,500

Now we have found the answer to the question of what his monthly income is.

As you say, multiplication is repeated adding.   
Exponents are repeated multiplication.

Another way to write x+x is 2\*x or just 2x.   
Another way to write x\*x is x^(2).

Another way to write x+x+x is 3\*x or just 3x.   
Another way to write x\*x\*x is x^(3).

       39  
     x 32  
    ------
       78   
     1170  
    ------   
     1248

Why? Because 39x2=78 and 39x3=117. The 3 is in the 10s place, so you multiply that by 10. Then you add the two together. I'm really not sure what you were doing with ( 2 x 9 + 2 x 3) + (3 x 9 + 3 x 3) = 60. That's not how the procedure works.

Now then, you weren't multiplying 39 by 32, you were multiplying 3.9 by 3.2. Both of these numbers are between 3 and 4, so your answer will be between 9 and 16. Or you look at how many significant digits there are after the decimal in each number you're multiplying together. In 3.9, the 9 is one digit after the decimal, and in 3.2, the 2 is one digit after the decimal. That's a total of 2 digits after the decimal, which is what you need in your final answer. So 1248 becomes 12.48, which is between 9 and 16.

Yes, "stricken" is a word and it is the past participle of "to strike". The past participle is used in the passive voice.

As with some other verbs like "to hang", whether the regular or irregular form is used depends on the sense intended. As someone else mentioned, something can "be stricken" from the record or you can "be struck" with an idea. Criminals can "be hanged" and clothing can "be hung".

Why did you put *words* in scare quotes?
Definitely see a neurologist. But from my non-professional, completely layperson standpoint as a person who has TS, it sounds like it might be TS.
Busted ... I didn't read the article. Shame on me.

EDIT: I read the article. I agree with you about "years back". It sounds perfectly natural to me.
You should make an appointment with a neurologist.

But generally, the diagnostic criteria are some motor tics and at least one vocal tic. Sniffing and coughing count as vocal tics.

Do you feel like it's you performing the tic, but you just have this overwhelming urge to do it? What does it feel like when you resist the urge? Do you feel some kind of build-up inside? The common analogy is an itchy mosquito bite. Scratching it only provides very temporary relief, but not scratching it drives you crazy.
"Pass out" is common in both senses in my dialect, and I've never been confused. The "faint" meaning is intransitive and the "distribute" meaning is transitive.

EDIT: No, I didn't read the article. I know I should have. My bad.

EDIT 2: Read the article. Sure, it might get confused with a different sense, but it's hardly unique that way. Take "passed". I hear it, I think academic success. Lots of people these days use it as a euphemism for "died", presumably short for "passed away". And how many comedians would be short on material if words and phrases didn't have multiple meanings?
I'm 40+ and American, and "pass out" is entirely natural for me, both in the sense of "distribute" and in the sense of "faint".

I have to agree with the others. You're coming in as a beginner about halfway through the third act. At best you'll be able to get the Damaged Jebediah Statue. You might be able to craft a trench or two.

Ruffians are the NPCs for this event. You can see them on the splash screen when the game loads. They're the woman with the pigtail and knit hat, the man with the mohawk and Bane mask, and the man with the mustache and red sunglasses. They wander around everyone's town and give event currency when tapped. If they're not showing up in your friends' towns yet, then you haven't gotten to that part of the questline yet.

Except the Big Bang was not a creation event. It was an expansion event. We don't know where the matter came from and we don't know if it's meaningful to talk about "before" because time is the relationship of cause to effect. But cosmologists characterize the Big Bang as an expansion event that is possibly still ongoing.

No, that's not how language change works.

In the original Latin, they had the root "amicus", which meant "friend". It is related to the verb "amare" meaning "to love". That root lives on more transparently in words like "amiable" and even the name Amy. If you know any French, "je t'aime" means "I love you."

Adding the prefix of negation to "amicus" yielded *inimicus* (with the vowel morphing according to phonotactic rules). That's how the word came to be in Latin.

Over time, as Latin spread and influenced other languages and morphed into the Romance languages and the Romance languages influenced other languages, the relationship between the historical root and the historical prefix became fuzzy. Particularly in English, which is not directly related to Latin, we inherited the word as a singular fused-together thing, not as a sum of parts. There is no root "emy" in English. That's what I meant when I said that the English word "enemy" is monomorphemic. As it exists in English, it cannot be broken down into component parts. It's only the word's distant ancestor, with its origins in a different language, that had component parts.
According to the entry for "enemy", it traces back to the Latin *in-* + *imicus*, literally "not-friend". This makes it cognate with "[inimical](https://www.etymonline.com/word/inimical)".

In English, "enemy" is monomorphemic. But etymologically it can be broken apart.
[It's because there are actually two different prefixes that have converged into "in-".](https://www.etymonline.com/word/in-)

The specific issues relating to being trans, I'm supportive but I don't pretend to fully understand. Not at the personal, experiential level. But I do understand very well the broader issue of fighting off toxic messages that I've internalized.

I was fed the lie that I'm incapable and unworthy. I was fed it for so long that I came to believe it. It feels strange to me when someone tries to tell me that I am capable and I am worthy. It's very difficult to shed that belief. It still has a strong hold on my mind.

You were fed the lie that you're not a woman. And it's a very difficult thing to let go of, because you're surrounded by not just individuals but a whole society, a whole culture, that keeps repeating the lie to you, complete with utterly fallacious arguments in an ultimately vain attempt to prove that they're right. It's hard to not internalize that. 

So framed in that way, I do understand that aspect of your struggle. But you. Are. A. Woman. And anyone who tells you otherwise is. Just. Wrong. And yeah, it's hard to face them down and tell them what they can do with their opinions, because you feel hopelessly outgunned. But if 5 billion people said the earth is flat, that does not change the fact that the earth is an oblate spheroid.

Douglas Adams once said:

> [“This is rather as if you imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, 'This is an interesting world I find myself in — an interesting hole I find myself in — fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!' This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be alright, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8mJr4c66bs)

That's anthropic bias. We fit so perfectly into this world that it must have been made for us. But the reality is that we arose out of the world and have adapted, however imperfectly, to it.

Analog watches need the position of the hands interpreted. The big hand is on the 5 and the little hand is between the 6 and the 7. The big hand is between the 3 and the 4 and the little hand is just past the 8.

"Transgender" is an adjective, not a noun. And no. The real-life truth is that not all trans women are gorgeous. There are numerous factors involved, including how old they are when they begin transition and how far along they are in the process of transition. But what they look like on the outside has no bearing on who they are on the inside. Also be aware that there is such a thing as trans men and non-binary people. 
You're right. I don't know where I was going with that.

There are some good resources in the sidebar.
Yes.

The word "transit" means "carrying things from one place to another". "Transitive" is the adjective form of that. In math, the transitive property means that under the right conditions, terms can move around and the meaning doesn't change.

Let's move away from variables for a moment and think of an example that might happen in real life. Let's say you have eight shirts that are all green. So the first shirt is the same color as the second shirt, and the second shirt is the same color as the third shirt, and the third shirt is the same color as the fourth shirt, etc. So it's just as valid to say that as it is to say that the first shirt is the same color as the eighth shirt, and the third shirt is the same color as the fifth shirt.

In math, variables stand for some unknown number. In this case here, we have a bunch of variables that are all equal to each other, which means they all have the same value. They are all standing in for the same number. If the number of legs you have is `l` and the number of socks you wear is `k` and the number of shoes you wear is `s`, then all of the following are equally true:

`l = s`   
`l = k`    
`s = l`    
`k = l`   
`s = k`   
`k = s`    
`l = s = k`  
`l = k = s`   
`s = l = k`   
`s = k = l`   
`k = l = s`   
`k = s = l`

Why? Because `l = 2` and `s = 2` and `k = 2`.

Your spoiler code is broken. The text you mean to hide is fully displayed, albeit in a strange format.

`[spoiler](/s "text to be hidden")` is the way you need to do it.
It's part of how the verb is conjugated. We use "do" and "be" as auxiliary verbs to help conjugate other verbs. It's the "do" and "be" that carry the tense. It's not "I was looked", it's "I was look**ing**". It's not "I did went", it's "I did **go**".
Pretty much. It's best to think of "to be" the stative verb and "to be" the auxiliary verb as two different things that happen to look like each other, because their usages are so different.

EDIT: Also, it's not modifying a verb like an adverb. It's part of how that verb is conjugated.
You start off saying that "was" is a state-of-being verb. I start off by clarifying that point.
And then I re-considered and edited it. It doesn't say "immediacy" anymore.
"Was" by itself is a state-of-being verb.

"Was" as an auxiliary verb is just how we conjugate the continuous aspect.

The issue here is not active vs passive voice, but rather the relationship with other actions.

"He was looking at him" -- past tense, continuous aspect, active voice.    
"He looked at him" -- past tense, perfective aspect, active voice.

"He was looking at the horse when suddenly something spooked it and it bolted." -- While X is happening, Y happens.   
"He looked at the horse and called out." -- First X happened, then Y happened.
I'm crafting as many wall pieces as I can for future design options. Coming in behind that is trench pieces.
I'd never considered "resemble". That warrants further investigation. But how are "see" and "know" not active verbs? I mean, they're certainly not stative verbs.

Your throw-away is probably newer than your actual account. Your actual account was probably made before the new profile system was rolled out.
Because it's rude and 100% unnecessary.
Which raises the question: What does "primitive" mean here? 
All genders. Not all beings. It's a reasonably well-defined term, and your interpretation is nowhere approaching reality. 
In that case, it's the same as on an actual computer. Upload the images to your imgur account and just post the link.
A copula is also called a stative verb because it is used to describe the state of the subject, as opposed to an active verb, which describes the action the subject performed.

In many languages, the subject complement takes the nominative because it's a direct reflection of the subject per se. In English, the only vestige we have left of a declension system is our pronouns, and it's not very robust.

Prescriptive grammar insists that the subject complement always be in the nominative. Linguists observe that in practice, pronoun subject complements (particularly after "to be") are often in the oblique. But since our declension system is not very robust, the oblique looks just like the accusative on the surface. 
/r/help is not a general help forum. It is for reddit-specific help only. Please find a more appropriate sub to post this in.
"Him" is not the direct object here. The direct object takes the action of a transitive verb. Transitive verbs are by definition active verbs, and "to be" is a stative verb. Stative verbs take subject complements.

As for the rest of the story, /u/recualca explains it well.
I think I saw a cup exchange on LiveJournal. You could Google for that kind of a thing.
Math is much, much more than simply being able to count.
Whether you're trans or not, you will probably find some good tips on how to bind in /r/ftm.
I just Googled "motorcycle hand signals" and found this:

She looks so soft! I want to snuggle her!

How old is she? Does she still have that "new puppy smell"?
Well, the two subs were meant to have different focuses.
The subreddit for questions like this is /r/whatstheword.
It's adorable, but cats (felines in general) go in /r/blep. Dogs (canines in general) go in /r/blop. 

This sub, /r/blup, is for anything that is neither feline nor canine.
You mean you're using the desktop site on your mobile browser? 
That depends entirely on which app you're using. You'll need to find the subreddit for that app. 
Try asking in the sub for your device. There's nothing we can do for you here. 
Votes are used to calculate karma, but karma is not one-to-one with votes.

Different subs can have different criteria for posting. Some subs require a certain amount of karma. Some subs require you to be whitelisted.

For certain purposes, subs only look at the karma you've accumulated there, regardless of how much total karma you have. 
Never look for logic in language. You might as well ask why it's not "heels over head". 
R4?
I think those are figurines, not actual puppies. 
Given that calorically, fat is fat, it's probably a good yardstick. 
Nah. He lacks the warmth and depth. 
Aaahhh, you're right. That's what I get for posting late at night. 
Here's the quick-and-dirty, I might be getting some finer details wrong, ELI5 breakdown:

Tense places it roughly in time: Past, present, future. I ran, I run, I will run.

Aspect says whether it's finished or ongoing: Perfect (finished), imperfect (unfinished), continuous (ongoing). I had run, I do run, I am running.

Mood (from "mode") is the other considerations: Active (I threw the ball), passive (The ball was thrown), imperative (Throw the ball!), etc.
That entirely depends on your device. Have you tried Googling "how to take a screenshot on [device]"?
Spray butter is approximately 4 calories per 5 sprays.

Using parentheses or even just a space helps to constrain what gets parsed as the superscript.

`b^(2)+c^(2)`     
`a^(2)+d^(2)`    
or    
`b^2 + c^2`    
`a^2 + d^2`
Pure coincidence. That connection has been debunked.
The key distinction with cheetahs is the line they have coming down from the inside corners of their eyes, like rock-n-roll stage makeup.
If you want line breaks, you need to hit the spacebar twice before hitting enter.
No pronouns at all? Not even demonstratives? Or just no personal pronouns? What about possessive pronouns?

k != v    
k = f(v)

The admins are not revealing the formula.
I think you're looking for /r/test.
Right. Derp.

For some reason, the way its nose is buried in the back of the Golden Train affected my ability to recognize it.

Now if only I can find where my Nerd Gold went!
That is brilliant! My current setup is just the Golden Train right in front of the Santa Teresa Tram.

What are the two items to the right of the Golden Train?
Wienersmith, actually.

I do understand the confusion, though. Despite different art styles and comic formats, the two do often tackle similar issues in similar ways. 
I have zero artistic talent. That's not a requirement for cross stitching. All you need is the ability to count and follow relatively simple instructions. As long as you have a pattern, there is no guesswork.
Whether that's accurate or just a glitch in how the numbers are presented (like the XX.X00001% bonus), I don't see any harm in piling it all on.
Sigh... 
I like your Ponymotes. :-P

This is a browser issue, not a reddit issue, and /r/help is exclusively for reddit issues. 

That said, it looks like your cat managed to hit ctrl-minus, which will zoom out the current tab. If you had been in, say, your email at the time, then your email would have zoomed out and reddit would have remained at normal magnification.

ctrl-minus zooms out, ctrl-plus zooms in, and ctrl-0 resets to normal magnification. (Please note, this is just the key that has + on it. Do not use the shift key.)

You might want to spoiler-tag the answer there.
The question was about formatting, not zooming.
You're cute even without the bunny overlay!

Karma is not one-to-one with votes. It's determined by a formula that only the admins know. Just keep in mind that votes != karma. It's more like f(v)=k.
Yes. The Old West rocks are completely perfect here.
No, adding /o/ to the ends of names does not make them vocative. The vocative only happens in second person -- "O captain my captain" -- and prefaces the address. Whereas you can talk to someone else about that neato thing you saw and how that weirdo cut you off in traffic.
Oh, I never said I outgrew the affinity toward things goth. Just the "look at meee!" phase. O:-)
I'm 43 and ditto.

Well, except for my "look at me, I'm a goth!" phase. That would have gone better if I had any makeup skills. :-P
> A great analogy to use for mental health is that these problems are as physical in nature as being short-sighted. You can’t just ask someone who needs glasses to ‘look harder.’

It's not an analogy at all. That's exactly what so much of this is. The brain is a physical thing.
Wolves are canines. Canines /r/blop. 
Seriously, though, the elephant is trying to shake trunks, but the woman just has a nub of a nose. 
If you really want to delete all trace of your posts and comments, edit them first and delete the contents, then delete the post/comment itself. (Post titles cannot be edited, however.)

I see what you did there.
All I can see is Android\data\com.ea.game.simpsons4_na\files -- all it shows in com.ea.game.simpsons4_na is files, and it shows nothing in files. And this is viewing it on my computer. I can't even see that much viewing directly on my tablet.
Confirming what /u/TCanada808 said. It happens automatically when it hits 6 months of age. Which means it's baked into the basic reddit code. It's not the same thing as when mods selectively freeze posts.
The desktop site has lesson notes. The mobile app does not.
I often tap Freddy Freeman by mistake.
I have yet to find an emulator that won't crash when I run Tapped Out. I've given up.
I once briefly worked in the kitchen of a nursing home. Three meals per day was included in the cost of living there. The menus had no prices and no money was exchanged at the point of service.

One ladle filled a bowl of soup and a cup of soup the same way. The bowl was only nominally bigger--the difference between whether or not sticking your spoon in will make it overflow. The size scam is truly pervasive and points to the companies that make/supply the cups and bowls.
It's common for righteousness to drop after you've leveled up. The best fix is to just add training walls to your town. There are plenty of buildings you can hide them behind so you don't have to worry about them looking out of place. Or you can even use them as walls/fences and strategically place things in front of them to hide the doors.
I have a Nexus 7 running Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Where do I find the app file?
Indeed. Consider the word "[fundament](https://www.etymonline.com/word/fundament)", which used to be the common term for one's butt. There's the derived word "[fundamental](https://www.etymonline.com/word/fundamental)", which is used to mean the basics of something, based on the metaphor of building on a base, which sits at the bottom.
D'awww...!

Someone already mentioned /r/babyelephantgifs. So I'll mention /r/wibblies.

I wish I drove. My life would be so different. 
If you don't know, then the truthful answer is "I don't know."
I found a few self posts in my own history that have the link icon instead of the dialogue icon. I have no idea, either.
It's a collection of a lot of different communities. Each community has its own topics and its own rules, but in general it's more about sharing and discussing content, and less about individual members the way Facebook is.
A linguist would say, "That's not how a native speaker would say it."
