I can't believe I didn't already follow her! Just saw her with straightened hair, looks great :') 
I wonder if Michelle has ever straightened her hair. :o 
I don't like it at all. And unfortunately, all I can do is apologise. 
>most likely it was a major factor behind his split with Jay.

....

Is this basically a hip-hop version of the Game Grumps split? 
That guy is a nobody compared to Kanye but he stood up for his beliefs right in Kanye's face. And he spoke so eloquently too. It's inspiring, even. 
Oh...... Oh my.......... Oh wow.
I'm rewatching the series with my parents and I figured the remix would never see the light of day....  now I'm wondering if maybe I should watch only the recut with them.
Oh no IndieGala what is you doing???
>Personally, I’ve had nothing but professional and wonderful experiences working with @ChannelAwesome. 

This is exactly where Tamara and Malcolm should have drawn the line. :/
Got it. I'm excited af to play!
He surprised me in Blockers. Played a great comedic and emotional part. 
Unfortunately, that's not the case for me.
A random person replied to my disappointment on Twitter that Save The World didn't go free saying that Save The World did go free for her. She seems like a real person and not a troll. 


Additionally, it seems like Save The World was downloaded when I check from the launcher but that was pre-patch.
That's toxic masculinity at work right there. I wish people who scoff at the term would understand that. 
Please go. 
The Gilmore Girls one. Amazing. They even put Dean playing air drums.
I'm not even a TotalBiscuit fan as such even though I've been subscribed for years. Heck, I didn't even know he hosted a podcast with Dodger (and didn't even know she was pregnant until the baby tweet). But man, this hits me hard. He is a brave, brave soul. And I hope he truly enjoys his remaining days here.

Oh, and the fact that he's revising his content to include his wife is really awesome/sweet. 
Squidward on a chair! 
Yo, nice. No need to spend any money.
Labour Day?
Farewell Season 3! This was the season that the game really blew up in popularity. All my friends starting to play it encouraged me to play more and even to purchase the Battle Pass. 
Honestly, I view Felix as worse and more damaging. But far less disappointing because despite the fact that I liked him, he didn't feel like an important part of my life like Channel Awesome did.  

I'm wary of how close he is with Jacksepticeye though. I love Jack, and I'm arguably more connected to him than CA. :/
Ehhhh I just don't like this kind of content really. :\
Oh, no problem dude. I just think it's kind of low effort. Sorry I called it dumb. Having a meh day. 
I think this is dumb and a complete overreaction but...

Holy crap, that was Ben Mendehlson??? 
I say this a lot. I got it from one of the Jack Sparrow origins books. 
"I don't care about racism" is a hallmark of racism. 
Read the name as "Doggo" at first. Relevant username. 
They were never part of the actual company 
Yeah and the third guy whose name I forgot. I more meant people on the side of #ChangeTheChannel. Ellis is markedly not. 
I mean. I also forgot to mention that they never actually hurt anybody. They didn't have any abusive or unprofessional practices like CA, and didn't say or do anything racist like Jon or Felix. 
Nobody left Channel Awesome, the company, except Holly and that was four years ago. 
FINALLY. 
Thing is, there's nobody left to abuse anymore. 
I've got to say that Fine Bros is a COMPLETELY different situation. They actually apologised compared to the non-apologies from Felix, Paul, and CA. 
Beth Elderkin and Tim Sampson (Shark Jumping)
I want to as well. But I won't.
Yeah. Guess so. Sad that this is how it is ending. No sense of closure or catharsis at all.
He lost a lot of fans on /r/JonTron, and I've set all the JonTron meme subreddits I made to private with a disclaimer of Jon's racism. And yet, a ton of alt-right people just flooded /r/JonTron after we left to replace us. I visited there after a new video dropped out of curiosity, and someone pointing out the racist stuff got massively downvoted and replies to the effect of "we don't care". It's disgusting. 

I feel really sorry for the mods on there though. They're good people. Hope they're  doing alright.
Business as usual, I guess. 

What a shame.
Same. It's literally the definition of insanity. 
I really enjoyed the depressing ending. 
My university has had one of those for years. I think it's upkept by the Student's Guild.
Pitbull would be the first world leader to also be Mr. Worldwide. 
I feel like some people don't realise there's a solo mode in this game....
Now it's time to grind to Level 100 :P
Gabriel Luna being the Terminator in it has me hyped. 
Let's hope it works out as well as Tomb Raider, Doom, and God of War did.
no i didn't get to pet him :(((((( 

hopefully i see him again some time when I go walk in the park again
But. That's clearly not what the movie is gonna be since it's gonna centre around Live Aid.
i saw a big doggo with beautiful black fur yesterday 
Oh hey I see JonTron is on Facebook
Honestly, you kind of had every right to complain haha
He's playing PUPG 
Haven't really been having stuttering but a few patches ago I've been having much lower FPS than before
When I think of a cute animated doggo, Parton Oswalt comes to mind faster than Louis CK. Great choice. 
IT STILL DOESNT HELP AAAAAAAAAH
Eh. I don't think Donkey is that similar. 
> I think you still can go back to 60 if you force yourself and let your brain adapt to the sluggishness for long periods.

I game and work at 75 FPS, but on some games (especially on my old laptop) I settle for 30 FPS either because I have to or because I don't want to stress the GPU. And I'm fine with it tbh.
I think Fortnite is one of the few multiplayer games that you don't NEED 60 FPS for. That said, my friend is pretty good at the game on her i3 laptop running around 40 FPS, and I'm pretty sure that is bottlenecking her ability. So YMMV.
Honestly, go with the 1070Ti. Some games could very much use the extra VRAM, especially something like Rise of the Tomb Raider or GTA V with extra settings.
Oh Michael.... 
Yeah, DirectX 11/12 is way less fiddly but it's Windows only. 
Agreed. 
Man that would require so many emotes and costumes.... 
TF2 crossover confirmed. 
Nope. It's real. All of it. 
That sentence was a rollercoaster. 
Thing is that the new DOOM has a very deep lore to it too. The Doom Slayer is a very fleshed out character, and the mythology and setting have a lot to be explored in. If this sucks, I'd be very disappointed. 
To me it sounds like she knows that was a fabricated narrative but she doesn't care. It's the realest thing she feels. 
We all love Santa Christ! 

^^^^^^^\(or ^^^^^^^used ^^^^^^^to)
Yeah! You're probably right.
Probably would be too similar to Mushu though. Genie and Mushu have similar roles in their respective movies.
No surprise. Will Smith can do his own goofy and animated without having to copy Robin Williams. 
It's up 
Bill! Love that guy!

(mmmmmhhhmmmmm) 
The redesign doesn't have mod logs, but any changes in redesign shows up in the regular mod logs.
I understand that. All I can say is that we're having internal discussions. No mod logs required and I don't really use redesign either.
Again, not gonna give details of internal discussions. 
He cares too, we all do. He just hasn't worked with redesign at all. 

As much as I dislike it and disagree with it being done, this isn't being done to impede users. 
As much as I am not pleased with that person right now, I am really not at liberty to say who it is. 
I'm not pleased about this either. 

EDIT: I changed it back to readable. 
Yeet! 
Idk. A lot of them. I've had numerous laughs watching TNC but now I'm starting to forget specifically which ones. 
Erm. Can't remember. :P
They've directly referenced things from the sub before.
Looks pretty good! 
When I googled the movie, the synopsis seemed to hint that they completely left out one of the main focuses of the movie. 
Fixed it, guys. We're sorry.
We're fixing it now. Sorry, guys.

EDIT: The sub should be at least usable now. Still working on getting rid of some of the sidebar widgets. Please bear with us.
That's not bigotry. Leaving this post up just because of the valuable discussion it stimulated. 
>im just going by past experience that younger mods usually answer first. I didnt know if your sub was the same way or not.

I understand. 

>why would one of you guys want to destroy functionality of the sub for a lot of users?

I think that this was implemented to be just changing the background as a sort of Easter Egg/joke about the redesign. It wasn't actually intended to break the functionality of the sub. We're working on it! We do apologise. 
>mentioned the lower 3 mods since lower mods are more likely to respond than higher ones.

That's not true. If anything, I'd say the top mods/older mods are more responsive. 

We're having some internal discussions right now. We were aware of this thread before you pinged me. We're working on it. 
Fingers crossed? We know The Russos lurk here for sure. :P
Hey, you're not--
Look at it from his perspective. He doesn't see them as human. He sees them as scary robots killing humans.

I'm very fond of the idea that our morality in real life is absolutely not equal to what we consider in media. Otherwise cheering on the badass action heroes killing people in action movies well.... it isn't as fun. 
What am I doing moderating this subreddit? I have no self-control.
Probably Nostalgia Critic Batman and Robin. Not exactly sure though.
Prepare for us to parlay most of the mod stuff to you for the next few days. :P 
Honestly, a producer can take his unfinished work and release it. It's been done to great effect with Michael Jackson's newer releases, John Lennon.

I learned about it from OMG Facts YouTube videos... 
Mine would be 100% red
I hope they release it. I think he'd want that going by that statement. 
Both questions I would love to see answered.
Approving all the comments below because they encourage discussion, despite the misinformation.

AND THANK YOU 
I thought that one would be impossible, but it ended up being one of the first missions I completed. Legit, just landed in Tilted, baited an enemy and placed the trap on the floor as they chased me into the room.
Rumour has it that the comet will unlock Save the World for free which means no more free V-Bucks sadly.
I didn't expect that, those are just my ideal weapons for those situations. I know the pump is way better, which is why I've been trying to use it. But I still suck at it so I didn't put it in an ideal list.
I loved on Person of Interest how Jonah and Greg picked a fake name to credit as music supervisor when it was really them all along.
Love your work on Game of Thrones and Westworld, but Person of Interest is by far my favourite work of yours! Got a favourite track from Person of Interest?
> but if you're trying to win dropping in the less populated areas can make this a lot 

When the game came out that's exactly what I was doing, but it got me in sticky situations way too much and I'd get no combat experience and horrible loot then just get sniped in the Top 10. 
thanks aaaa
I've been doing that for about a month. I've stopped using the tac almot entirely
i'm almost at that mark myself
> Where are you dropping?

Wherever I feel to/What I need for Weekly Challenges. 

>Where are you pathing?


Towards.... the..... eye? Don't understand the question.


>What are you prioritizing in the game after your initial drop/looting?

Don't really understand this question either. Sometimes I'll push towards enemies. Sometimes, I'll try to build a metal fort, sometimes I'd look for better loot. It really depends on the situation.

>If you were to have your choice of weapons/items in a kit what would you use?

Early game: Legendary Silenced Pistol, Purple Tac, Scoped AR, Grenades, First Aid Kit

Late game: Golden SCAR, Heavy Shotgun, Legendary Bolt Action, Mini Shields, bandages.
 i want my first win :(
That's so cute! The couples I know who play haven't put any money into the game hahaha
That's hilarious. I can't wait to play StW. 
Can't wait for Save The World to go free. 
They don't??!!! Then what the heck was that guy shooting my structures with? A silenced pistol? I'll check the replay tomorrow I guess. 
I just lost a match because of a crossbow. It was down to the final four and I had a very high structure that nobody could take down  because it was anchored in a lot of places in the Storm. I was gonna be able to get the drop on a player building his own Fort in the middle of the eye, but I couldn't build forward anymore because someone else kept shooting my fort with the crossbow. I ended up having to build outwards back towards the storm and then looping around behind a tree and a building back in, then had to go onto the floor. By that time, I had no materials, the other guy building a fort killed crossbow guy and the other guy, and then he descended from his fort and killed me with a shotgun blast.

Would have been able to get the drop on him if my walls weren't being destroyed by an infinite ammo weapon. 
In small YouTube communities, YouTubers you like can definitely be your friends. Probably more common with Twitch though. 
Yes!!! I am! :') Awesome to find fellow a fellow Trini Westworld fan. Thought there were only a few of us. Then again Flow made HBO free for the premiere so maybe not. :P
The username. "Dat gyal" is a thing people say here. But thinking about it now, it's probably a reference to Dat Boi. 
I meant in general 
Yeet. 
OH RIGHT! I forgot about that! 
I mean, CA did not even utilise the extent of personal info Facebook can produce. Just building profiles of users' personal data on their friends taking quizzes and stuff, right? If you were to somehow compromise Facebook and take ALL the users' personal data, including Messenger conversations and WhatsApp conversations (which is technically impossible due to E2E Encryption), that would be an absolute NIGHTMARE.


It really does seem like Delos is trying to take over the world, because what they did is about a million times worse and more dangerous than what I just outlined. 
Skipping back and forth in time like Dolores was all through Season 1.

Also are you Trinidadian? Lol
Park *Six*?!?! How many are there????? 
Damn... Ford......... Wow. 
I hope Hale doesn't die 
Dolores wants to take over the world what the heck 
Sizemore should have been like "Well.... I guess it's only fair."
Wow the Robert Host isn't even bleeding. 
"Everything is code here, isn't it?"

Whoa. 
Baby Ford is creepy af now. 
Mmmm bacon. 
They're keeping record of all Guest information and DNA? I guess Delos must have absorbed Cambridge Analytica in the late 2010s. 
RIGHT? Is this all a machination of Ford? For Bernard to be let into all these places despite not being human? 
Bet there's gonna be a drone host cosplay soon 
Thought for sure Bernard would have been outed at the door handle... 
Oh I definitely think Bernard is rewinding. 
I mean... realistically... wouldn't we all try to do the same? 
Never thought I'd relate to Sizemore more than all the human characters but... here we are. 
Exactly my thought process there. 
Thought she was gonna let him run a few metres and kill him like in Black Panther. 
I was mixed on Maeve last season but I really like her now. She's clear in her ambitions. 
Hah. The Man in Black looking straight into the camera, great. 
I'm looking forward to villain Dolores. 
For once a song they actually had in the old West.

Man... Bold prediction here: Dolores is gonna be straight up villainous. I don't think I have any sympathy for her now. I feel like Bernard and Maeve will end up being the "heroes". And Teddy is gonna betray Dolores, I think. 
HALE!!!!!! YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
"Not all of us deserve to make it to the valley beyond."

Damn.....
I think it's confirmed now that Westworld is near China! 
I'm pretty sure Stubbs knows Bernard is a host. 
Whoa! That car is badass. We're getting a lot of world-building right now. 
I'm fairly sure it's Arnold now 
I.... I don't know. Is that even Arnold? Or is it Bernard? I have no clue and I love it. 
Representing how much more the Hosts are becoming human! 
You're not wrong, but a text post explaining this would have been approved. As it stands, the post was just a repost that had been downvoted. 
Thank GOD that HBO doesn't upload the episodes to HBO Go the morning of the day the episode premieres like Starz does with American Gods and their streaming service. 
It's not about "humour I don't like". I'm not watching Family Guy every week to rant about it. It's about spreading bigotry. 
I DUNNO, I'M JUST BAD 
Probably a lot.
I'm not getting anything confused. Hell, even judging by your username. Dankmemes is for edgy memes.

And as for "ironic" humour, I've seen many posters common across dankmemes and serious hate groups. 
Alt-righters hate him. A lot. 
Which is relatively few compared to their remaining million subscribers.

I hate to say it, but I think they've won. 
IDK, I'M JUST BAD. I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW TO IMPROVE. 
That subreddit has so much racism, misogyny, transphobia and all sorts of other bigotry all over and the mods encouraged it. It's bad. I care because you're bringing it into a sub I like. 
This video has already been posted. 
I'm sorry, this has already been posted!
Yeah it really is :/
I think this basically confirms we'll never get an apology. 
BECAUSE I'M BAD? 
By "that subreddit" I meant /r/dankmemes. /r/rickandmorty used to be bad but it's never been an edgy meme board to post tasteless things. 
Of course that subreddit would post something so disrespectful and tasteless shortly after the death of a pop musician. 
367 SOLO, 54 DUO, AND 93 SQUAD 
I STILL DON'T HAVE A WIN. GOSH DANG IT I'M MAD. 
You're an amazing parent. Keep it up. 
Probably all Steamed Hams jokes. The mods seem to have limited them to the top comment. The moderator in me is pleased, because it's genuinely good moderation, but the shitposter in me is disappointed. 
You're looking at it strictly from the negatives though. Your experiences with Internet friends could also be criticised, that it wasn't as safe back then. People could be completely disingenuous.

I've made some amazing friends on the Internet in recent days. 
Thank you! 
I don't think I regularly play any small games like that 
wat
Uhhhh... Talk to them? 
I have big criticisms with Firewatch, but the game is effective at giving you chills and the dialogue is PERFECT. 
CS:GO has writers and an established lore as well. 
>Throwing out $10 words then is all like "ur".

I... I do this all the time. I use "you're" and "ur" in the same sentence sometimes. I don't even know why. It's just how I text. 
Oh I know one specific gamer who is like this and possibly even worse
I have a lot of female Internet friends (I'm a guy), but from Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit, Facebook, Discord, even Omegle... hell even cess pools like Chatous. But I don't think I've ever made a female Internet friend on a game. I know a lot of my female friends avoid speaking on games just to avoid creeps. 
Ahahahaha gosh I love Sam Bee. She's hilarious. I need to check out her TBS sitcom. 
Are you sure? I actually did think it was a cockroach but immediately assumed "oh it's probably some kind of cockroach that's illegal to own in the US". 
People have got to stop thinking of gilding comments as gifting someone a subscription to a service and instead think of it as a "super upvote". 
Department of Redundancy Department 
Ah true, I just like to be realistic with casting I guess. 
For now, it's about ex-CA contributors and Channel Awesome contributors. If you've got recommendations, go check out the Discord, we have a channel specifically for this purpose.

Hell, I would love to have Jenny Nicholson, Hbomberguy, Contrapoints videos posted here. I agree with your point. This sub could become the place to discover awesome channels in the review/commentary community. But we'd have to have a lot of discussions about rules and whatnot. 
The only castings I like here are Bill Hader as James Rolfe and Allison Brie as Kaylyn. I think a lot of the problems are with age difference and big names in small parts. Assuming it comes out TODAY, I'm fine with Hader being older because that's just a cameo, but Brendan Fraser, Paul Giamatti, Stanley Tucci... Mehhhhh. 

Let me try.

* Jesse Eisenberg as Doug Walker
* Seth Rogen as Rob Walker 
* Paul Dano as Mike Michaud
* Brian J. Smith as Mike Ellis 
* Hasan Minhaj as Bhargav Dronmraju
* Anna Chlumsky as Holly Brown
* Pete Holmes as Justin Carmical
* Christy Carlson Romano as Lindsay Ellis 
* Dove Cameron as Kaylyn Saucedo 
* Bill Hader as James Rolfe (cameo) 

I think that's all I have for now 
She has all the damn degrees and experience to do it! So I have no doubts that it'll happen if that's the trajectory she wants to take.

If Rian Johnson can hit it big and stay as grounded as he has, Lindsay sure as hell can. 
>Hell, even her drinking wine on the beach could be recent since she lives near an ocean.

She posted selfies from the beach in the same clothes just a few days ago. Like six days or so. 
Oh wow I didn't know that. That's freaking awesome. 
>Pretty much why I both do and don't want to watch the latest Nostalgia Critic episodes, and can't blame people who do.

Yup. Totally. :/ Same. 
This blurs the line between essay and documentary, really. But to see Nella show up was just really really nice. And then the ending was pretty emotional. I hope we do get to see her bring more of her filmmaking expertise into the video itself (rather than just informing the script). I think she's finally found her comfort zone. And she's making enough on Patreon to keep paying her writers, and can afford (what I assume are) the paid soundtracks she uses. 
The ending bit where Lindsay comes home to an empty house was also filmed recently, as were the beach parts (and any part of the video where she's wearing the Dark Universe t-shirt really). 
I'm sorry man :(
MRAs are completely different from feminists. They're not two sides of the same coin like you're implying.

Anyway this conversation isn't productive and is wildly off topic so I'm stopping it right here. 
Of course. But feminism is advocating for woman to have equal rights. That's the definition of feminism. 
Yeah, that doesn't inspire any confidence at all. Anti-"SJW" people in the current day YouTube landscape are very dangerous.
>he's got a hatred of feminists

Um... I feel like I'd just immediately not trust that guy based on that. Does it mean he thinks women are inferior to men, or that they don't deserve rights? 
The only good answer 
I'm a fan of Fredrik. In fact before the document even came out, when it was just a Reddit thread, I tweeted at him saying he should do a documentary and he replied saying he would with a crowd funding campaign
Team Deatchmatch
If someone makes a Channel Awesome/That Guy With The Glasses documentary, this has to be in the soundtrack for sure.


EDIT:  I also found this same channel did a cover of the SchmoesKnow theme that is truly epic. I didn't even think that possible.
Oh.... That's arguably worse. ROG is one of the most famous names in PC gaming.
I don't think he'd do that. I feel like he'd probably get Malcolm or Walter to do the episodes or something. 
Crazy? Where did you hear that? If anything she's one of the most rational and reserved people I've ever seen to come out of Channel Awesome. And even among her own new circles, she's prone to drama far less than than Natalie, Harris, or Dan (all three of whom are great). 
YAY SHE GOT FOODY
Yeah, I'd really like to know too. Heather has been streaming Life is Strange but I don't know if she has made any comment whatsoever. 
Disneycember doesn't really have anything to do with Nostalgia Critic, and they actually quietly dropped the Editorials and started release NC Reviews every week a few months ago. 
🎶 The Review Must Go Ooooooon

The Review Must Go Oooooon 🎶

What? It's a catchy song. 
But... it's both. Why can't it be both? 
Rust Lord most definitely fits the theme. It's a parody of Star Lord from Guardians of the Galaxy.
That's not the point. The point is that they were being forced into a schedule to produce videos while not being compensated for it at all. At the very least, they could be promoted on the site. After all, they were being paid in E X P O S U R E
Will GPP force ASUS to cease branding AMD graphics cards as Strixx?
Damn. That's a hell of a dream. 
Man I would like to know too 
It's. Like. Mathematics though 
Oh heck. That's a short amount of time. 
Ellis and  Dronamraju have long left IIRC 
Robert Plant skin included? 
I'm 20 and I've never won a solo or duo or squad 
I shudder thinking about the input lag  but I really wanna try out Fortnite on a huge screen like that. 
Is it bad that I was hoping for that for some reason 
I have seen nothing but frustration at that on /r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS. So much so that PlayerUnknown had to come out and say they won't be removing it. I highly doubt that is coming to Fortnite, and definitely not in the main game. 
I think something is happening anyway because a comet actually appeared the sky.

I actually had a dream about it last night, that's how much I was thinking about it haha
It isn't for that. It was originally for if Michaud took down the subreddit, but now that he's demodded we're looking into turning into a sub Discord. That will take a little time and effort though.
Re-review with the new context 
Ohhhh, it was an LTM? How often do we get those on PUBG? I got the game two days ago lol
To be fair to Bluehole, Tencent is one of the biggest corporations in the world...
There's TDM on PUBG???
If you see anything on the sub that is abusive, please report it.
Yeah, I think that's the point she was trying to get at there.
There are four shareholders in the company. Save to assume Doug and Rob are two of them.
I mean, they do use it a lot. It's just that generally I guess he wanted to keep the regular shots of the critic against a background consistent.
Yeah, especially since Barney's wife passed away recently. I wish him the best.
That's indeed what I was thinking too.
YouTube isn't censoring him.
Exactly. Hope he doesn't cover it.
This is a good comment. 
Jeremy's red background isn't too bad all things considered. It's not blank and it looks pretty good. Besides, he tends to usually have something in the top left like in Weekend Update. 

I think they went with the blank wall for NuCritic because the original Nostalgia Critic videos were in front of a blank yellow wall.
Eh.... Can't really imagine him saying that sentence in particular.
I must say, moderating /r/ChannelAwesome is something I've wanted to do ever since I joined Reddit. It's a shame these are the circumstances it had to happen under. 
👏👏👏 Well said, Luis! 
Sigh. Wonder what that thread was like. 
Fortnite, but technically that's not released yet. There's text chat in the lobby. And they recently implemented a communication wheel to ask teammates for shields, health, ammo, weapons, and to call out an enemy sighted.


What's War Mode? I got the (PC version of the) game last night. 
This should be flaired with Breaking Bad spoilers 
Change The Channel was perfect because it had the double meaning of "don't tune into them" and "the company needs to apologise and make amends". Then when they doubled down it meant "full boycott". 
OP was being sarcastic, but this post is still in very poor taste, I'd say. 
Oh wow this is great
Omg. I want to see it. 
Omg. I want to see it. 
Yeah I know. 
The more active mod has one comment total on Reddit.... and it's from a year ago.... not even on this subreddit.... and he's Mike Michaud. 

That report isn't going anywhere, unfortunately. 
Just... breathe. 
Ooh, this seems like a nice deal. 
"Okay listen, you have a point, but you're blowing it out of proportion."

The other side isn't as bad as you think.

Both sides are the same!

Actually, your side is more in the wrong, and here's why. 

The other side is innocent."
Really? That's kinda cute. 
Fun fact: Rob Scallon and Tamara have been dating for years. Not sure if they're broken up now though. But I know they were together from about 2012 to 2015 or so. I had no clue they were associated at all, since I see Rob as from such a different circle to TGWTG. 
Thank God for Jim 
He tweeted about them today so... 
Yup. I've switched almost exclusively to watching James videos. 
Most likely Fred Knudsen will.
And the racist comics

>Chances are that they didn’t know and they only found out what was happening because of the person they refer to in their chat logs and then they proceeded to act on it accordingly. 

Even if that's the case, the fact that the document said he was terminated a year later means that they should have realised that that Jane Doe (who was groomed) wasn't the same as the second one who they fired him immediately over. It just goes to show even more of the unprofessionalism the document called out. 

And you know what? If Holly was still working for them, or if they had an HR department at all, that would have been avoided.
no.
Awwwwwwww!!!
I think the game is better as a whole now, but that music playing at a victory royale was cool.
Damn, was hoping this situation would improve but it seems to have only gotten worse.
Jordan Peterson isn't involved in it AFAIK, I just know H3H3 is cool with him and many on the Change The Channel side would not be. 
FUPA Law? You mean fund, right? This doesn't really have anything to do with fair use so I don't see how they could use that.

Also I don't see the majority of them even *wanting* to use it, considering two of their biggest creators are Lindsay Ellis and Dan Olson who constantly criticise Jordan Peterson, plus multiple producers are trans or outspoken trans allies.
The Screen Junkies situation is nothing like the CA one, and they didn't do that at all. They immediately fired Signore, and posted a video of the top SJ people sitting at a table and discussing it, supporting the victims, and *actually* apologising.

I always liked Channel Awesome more than Screen Junkies but in hindsight, Screen Junkies was just so much more an *actual company*. 
I maintain that The Review Must Go On is one of the best things Doug Walker ever put out. It's shockingly honest, well-written and full of great comedic and dramatic moments (funny enough two of those were directed by Lindsay... lol). It's full of the kind of subtlety I haven't really seen in anything else Doug has ever done. 
That makes a lot of sense actually. But damn, he should have still told the others that he was retiring the Critic. 
That wasn't the point here really. 
Their response was *why* I unsubscribed. 
Don't beat yourself up about it too much. Your data storage is on par with Channel Awesome's! 
Oh, it's real alright. It's some real fanfiction. 
Around 2013. Not exactly sure how I even found TGWTG. Maybe it was through references I saw on TV Tropes. But mostly just watched The NC. 
Hope you found a valuable creative output since then! 
Also Tamara Just Saw, Top 5, Orbit Report, First Viewing, and probably others that I'm forgetting.

Also Nostalgia Critic episodes are not separated from Editorials.

They basically just didn't care. Especially since Michaud seems to still be the only one updating the site. 
What if we say Bill? Will Bill appear? I love that guy! 
Yeah but I mean it's Donald Glover. 
Totally. 
Ah, I see. We don't treat them as spoilers at all on /r/television. I feel like people would complain if we did haha 
Wait, hosts/musical guests are considered spoilers here? :| Oops. 
A real life black superhero coming on just shortly after a fictional one. 
Glad I wasn't the only one who misread it as that. 
That would be hilarious.

But I feel like it's out of character for Childish Gambino. 
That would be hilarious.

But I feel like it's out of character for Childish Gambino. 
YESSSSS. FINALLY. 
YESSSSS. FINALLY. 
Not too far off considering some of the recent revelations?

Dee: "So what about craft services, where are they?"

Dennis: "HAHAHAHAHAHA!" 
Most people don't even know Vsauce is a site collecting content from other producers. I didn't.... 
Chris Stuckmann was in. 
Ideally I think they or any company/endeavour shouldn't be moderating a subreddit for themselves though. It should be fan modded but officially supported. 
Is that Mr. Data? 
Compilations are fine. But I'm not going to support anyone who hires him, especially so directly. 
Ah true, his comments were political. But also racist. He said black people were biologically less intelligent than white people. He parrotted white nationalist talking points.

Also I find Jones very funny too. But he's doing real damage. I would never support him. 
Philly D isn't racist. He certainly isn't a neutral "reasonable voice" either though. 

Racism isn't a "political view".
nah
Yep. But this sub has no moderation, so...
Jones and Jon are racists, and Felix panders to racists. 
~~Hey, that's the name of the show!~~ 

Ahhh yes, that didn't look like an animation studio to me... Makes sense that it was a secondary job.
Damn. You should resubmit this. It needs more attention. Dan's face and the nervous smile says volumes. We should have known lol
And now that CBS and Viacom will merge back together again, it's possible he could bring the actual character back without issue. Though it is worth noting that when "Stephen Colbert's identical twin cousin, Stephen Colbert" appeared the next few times after, he took up more traits of the original "Stephen Colbert" and they even stopped mentioning that he's a different character.
He was an illustrator. Not sure where the janitor thing came from.
Sounds more like you hate TV Tropes than they love CA. 
I'm pretty sure something like that wouldn't involve accusing their dead former collaborator of rape or using sexual abuse to market a product. If I find out that Lindsay Ellis, Dan Olson, and Fredrik Knudsen were in on something like that, I'm pretty sure I'd lose respect for them. 

Also this hasn't been "juicy" like Keeping Up With The Kardashians or some YouTube drama crap (honestly the former is way better than the latter), this is just a big hole of depressing.
Welp. One of the few things that could have gotten me on board for this has now happened.

Mackenzie Davis too!
Gosh, I watched a few ralphthemoviemaker videos and subscribed to him because I enjoyed them, but I haven't enjoyed anything of his since. I just find his videos so dull. :/
Man, I have so many. I'm really not sure. Probably The Christmas Tree because of the beautiful message at the end. Probably won't ever be rewatching any to find out though...
Foals - Spanish Sahara

Ringo Starr - Photograph

Hey, you're funny! They should put you on Channel Awesome! 
Where did this joke come from? 
I feel like the Fine Bros situation is not nearly as bad as this... Like.... Not by a long shot. 
Someone already has requested it. I'm considering messaging an admin for help as well. If any active moderators of big subreddits like I am are reading this, can you PM me? 
I've always wanted to learn this on piano but I think this might have convinced me to actually start. 
He used the "I should buy a boat" meme with the cat. That was great. 
>It's kinda like finding out Santa isn't real or something.

Santa Christ, Santa Christ, we all love Santa Christ.

:(
Feel kinda glad I cried myself to sleep early last night so I didn't have to have the same 3 am depressed thoughts you did. Because I totally would have. I'm so sorry dude. 
Someone already did. 
I mean... There's one huge rape accusation shaped reason he might have been reminded this exists... 
Hmmmmmm
Well we have here, which apparently is modded by Michaud. Hoping the Reddit Request gets granted.
Yeah, but it doesn't work in place of Skinner as well as Walker does.
Wait.... is mikemvs Michaud? 
Screen Junkies also took the time and bothered to actually organise properly. That took them very far.

I agree that it was the best thing he could do for himself, but I think that he should have at least acknowledged that he enabled some really horrible people to say horrible things. 

Oh and I had a feeling you hadn't seen the comics but I didn't want to ask lol
Ohhhhh!!!!! I see. I didn't know that haha. 

Damn. Wishing you all the best with this stuff.

Okay still not sure what happened even after googling :/
Okay still not sure what happened even after googling :/
I think he'll probably just be getting a normal office job. 
Now you see what I was talking about last night. 
Wow. That's a Nostalgia Critic reference, right 
He removed Channel Awesome from his Twitter profile
That's true!

And uh... Charlottesville? :/
Well what I'm saying is that social justice Tumblr did use the term until about 2015. Then it became the term you described to just mean anyone who cares about social justice. 
what about F L O A T P L A N E
He gave the sexists ammo and did absolutely nothing to try and explain himself. 
well now i have 
most definitely 
No, I'm saying they used it as an argument despite the fact that they were just sexist. In addition to people who had a legit problem with it. James never clarified or anything. I get the feeling he's quite hands off in terms of running Cinemassacre channels and accounts. 

I think you're misunderstanding my tone as hostile. I'm still a big fan of AVGN.
I feel really really sorry for her tbh.... 
To contrast lemonheader, I really like a lot of the essays. 
Might as well start it now! It's a fantastic read.
"An ass" is different from overtly racist comics dude. 

And yes, the Ghostbusters thing was for his own reasons, but many on the alt-right (and other antifeminist circles) use his argument to justify their hatred of the movie due to sexism. 
It really did feel like they were just looking to blame a woman 
Oh crap. This might be the saddest part of all. I love Malcolm and Tamara. :(
Yup. And it's not their fault at all. I'm also wondering about Heather, Aiyanna, Jim, and Walter. They also worked in the same studio and do things on CA. I doubt Michaud owns Top 5 lists, right? 
It seems like Malcolm and Tamara actually are under actual, proper contracts. So it might actually be a contract thing. 
Wow. That's sad. 
Goodbye and goodnight. 
I don't really think that's making light of it at all. That scene was a gut punch. Then again, I might be biased considering I'm never off /r/marvelstudios. 
This sub went from hilarious shitposting to downright depressing within hours. And now I can't sleep. I hope you find something to believe in soon. I also recommend that you talk this over with a counselor or therapist. It'll help. 
I've had all the implements for a NC cosplay, I've just never done it. 
>It makes me feel sick, like I'm guilty by passive association and support. I know that isn't the case but the shock is simply not wearing away (particularly when the situation is getting worse by the hour).


That's *exactly* how I feel. Thanks for putting it into words.

Also Luke Skywalker did a human thing. I really think Rian Johnson deepened the character in The Last Jedi and gave him a beautiful ending to his arc.

Sorry, I know that's not the point here but. Damn I love The Last Jedi. 
Barney Walker is still a pretty damn good composer, at least. 
I mean Mike Matei's extremely distasteful and extremely vulgar racist comics from the early 2000s came up last year, and Mike had quite a bit of misconduct on the Cinemassacre subreddit. And James didn't even comment on those at all. And then in 2016 there was James with the whole female Ghostbusters thing.

But those are downright forgivable compared to some of the Channel Awesome stuff. 
I started watching Allison's Baywatching. It's damn hilarious. 
One of my favourite Nostalgia Critic moments (God, I have so many) is at the end of the Christmas Tree review when he rants about how the filmmakers didn't even try to give a decent moral. He gave probably one of my favourite Christmas speeches of all time in *anything*about how effort is important in all that you do.

Now to know just how little effort Doug and CA management put into securing the safety and wellbeing of many of their producers, it taints what in my mind was such a beautiful speech capturing the spirit of Christmas. It ended up being laced with hypocrisy. 

Christmas is going to feel a lot emptier this year without Disneycember and the Nostalgia Critic episodes. 
Yup I totally agree. It really is the end of an era. But things will just go on. Do you think Channel Awesome and its influence will become forgotten to time? Without them we arguably wouldn't have the YouTube landscape of today.
I'll toast to that. I enjoyed The Nostalgia Critic so much but I don't know if I can ever look at it without thinking about all this. So I just might never look again. 
>SJW has been from the start an insult directed at ANY and ALL left-leaning people with an interest in feminism and anti-racism.

I absolutely hate the phrase too but, that's not really true. I first learned the phrase on Tumblr and it did indeed refer to completely extremist views. But since about 2015 the phrase was hijacked exclusively to fit exactly what you described. Ever since then I haven't used it. 
Oof. 
That's just factually incorrect. 
I would wager that too. Why dismiss the whole campaign as "slacktivist" then? If it's literally something 51% of the population faces.
I won the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 (2016) giveaway. I realised I didn't want the movie at all and I'd have to pay to get it shipped to me (internationally) and I knew my friend's girlfriend liked Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles so I gave them my friend's address and apparently she received it just fine. My only experience with Awesome Express shipping lol
I feel bad for only paying attention to The Nostalgia Critic for the most part all these years. I started watching Allison's Baywatching series yesterday and it's gut-bustingly hilarious.
I honestly disagree. Doug and Rob come off as arrogant and complicit, but not as completely horrible like Michaud. Additionally, I don't think The NC is completely needed to do their reviews anymore.
> \#metoo slacktivist campaigns

Wait wait. You don't believe *any* of the stories from the #MeToo campaign? Not a single one?!
I think they just felt lucky to still have Angry Joe and felt like he could bring them some viewers. Thinking that they knew that slapping him with a contract could cause him to leave. Maybe a similar thing with Chris.
Ahahahahha. wow
They doug themselves 
I'm glad this sub is swerving into this rather than  removing all comments speaking against Channel Awesome like the route /r/JonTron went. Love the mods on there but that community has really become awful now, and I had a lot of love for it before and in the few days after Jon's racist rants. 
It's because of the "SJW" thing tbh. It's so completely unfounded. 
Will do
The 1070Ti on the front page rn is still in stock!
Ohhhh right that's an American term. We always call them commentators here, sorry.
wow
5 hours and it's still in stock!
I mean.... They can. A lot of small form factor PCs and beast laptops are on the market. But again, consoles are just easier and better for more casual gamers.
Hah. Commentators. But I wouldn't be surprised if they start being called casters more due to Twitch's popularity.
Thanks so much for the communication and hard work!
Legends of Tomorrow. After the two-episode pilot. "Alpha particles were not well-known in the 70s." Meh.
A LOT. Especially internationally. My guess would be $65M OW, $230M Dom, $600M WW

YAY! I'M GLAD YOU FEEL BETTER FRIEND
I want one with the caption from the meme :(
/r/oddlysatisfying 
Come bubka
Yes. The singer does. 
Hmm. Sure you can't go any higher than that? 
You should know that the sub is awesome. 
Your match doesn't necessarily represent what your voice is like at all! Just who your range is identical to.
Before you do, try out Fortnite. It has a much more fulfilling solo mode than PUBG (in my opinion) and you can play cross platform with your Xbox friends. Oh. And it's made by the people who made the Unreal Engine, so performance issues are few and far between. 

If you get an
XB1X for PUBG, your performance will be good, especially with recent patches but you will probably be highly unlikely to hit 60 FPS with the XB1S and you will struggle at 30 with the original Xbox One.

That said... I really do wish I had PUBG. 
Woosh! 
Oh. Well no, I think they're entitled to think that about the joke tbh. 
The implication is "just in case" they pass away that is being pushed in the thread.
Wait. But you said "hill to die on" implying this could bring about a lot of people starting to dislike him. I think this is relatively minor compared to stuff he's done in the past (but still bad). I think I'm confused about your original comment, my bad. 
No. They scanned the actors they needed. Where does "just in case" come into play? 
"Trans people aren't the real marginalised group! YouTubers are the ones being persecuted!!!" Ethan said, jotting down ideas for sarcastic remarks for his new video on Joey Salads' latest 'social experiment'. "Ha. Nah. Too on-the-nose." Ethan tore off and crumpled up the yellow notebook paper and threw it towards the trash can. 
The fact that Sean (Jack) lives near, and still heavily associates with, Felix makes me very very uncomfortable. But he still seems like such a nice guy and his videos are still great. Man, I honestly don't know where I would be without him. He's such an important person in my life and his videos have helped me get through a lot.

Then again, I thought the same about JonTron and then I dropped him like a hot potato, or more accurately, hot garbage (if you were on /r/JonTron in the aftermath of the Destiny debate you know what I'm talking about) so I don't know.

BTW, found a great JonTron replacement the other day. QuintonReviews. Him and PeanutButterGamer should suffice. And the content is about 10x more frequent.

Oh. And Ethan is already about two miles into the bad path. I'm still holding out hope he can walk back. 
Yikes, I forgot that tweet was on TDOV. Yeah. That makes it about a million times worse. 
Yes, you can blame them, even if it makes them a lot of money. That's kind of the point of accountability. 
Thank you so much for this. Every time I come into a /r/h3h3productions comments section, it's seriously disappointing stuff, with fantastic comments and insight underneath. Gives me some  hope in the community.

I haven't watched the video in its entirety, but I'm going to hazard a guess that it's probably not the worst. Ethan was right in the Hugh Mungus video, but the very existence of the video signalling the shift to alt-lite content is probably worse. Maybe even something like the podcast with Keemstar, JonTron, or Jordan Peterson could be seen as worse. 
He definitely does. And it gets more and more disappointing every time.

I don't think the original tweet was bait. Just a stupid joke that has unfortunate implications. Him just not apologising would have made me roll my eyes. But this kind of childish behaviour obviously manufactured to get people riled up is what seriously gets me stirred. Which is what he wants, I guess. So. 
Hill to die on? This is like the sixth time Ethan has pulled something like this and he continues to grow and become even more popular.
Yup. Totally. The tweet wasn't so bad in itself, just quite unfortunate. Kinda like similar jokes when watching old episodes of Whose Line. 

It was him doubling down like this and calling TRIGGERED that lands him squarely in obnoxious/transphobe-pandering territory. 
I think we can now proudly put Ethan in the same category as Ricky Gervais. 
Thanks man!
Mods, pls flair "Steam, not PC"? 
Oh damn haha. 

Yeah. They had to play in the World Cup qualifier tournament.... I barely even knew that was a thing before. 
Imgur is overloaded right now so here are my results hosted on.... [TinyPic? I guess?](http://oi64.tinypic.com/2j3jzb9.jpg)

The rest was most certainly not legit. He was CGI'd into a lot of the movie. And in the case of many of the stunts, he was always meant to be CGI.

Read the story. 
Yes! We've talked about this before. :P I've met him. Idk if you remember. 
Yes! We've talked about this before. :P I've met him. Idk if you remmeber. 
The different art styles work together so well! Good work. 
I'm not sure if your entire comment is a joke or if you just capped off your serious point with a joke. I'm thinking the latter because you did separate paragraphs. 
I still can't believe your username is Larry Gomes lol
Same. The lighting and terrain really make it look like Fortnite. 
That's it! You got it!
Oh gosh, one of the biggest twists was just spoiled for you. :|

i dont
oh boy /u/Prax150...... they really got us worried. how are we gonna contain this
I wanna go on record and say at least three of us in the Slack mod chat for /r/television actually thought this was going to be serious. And I was one. :| 
Edited my comment 
Check the edit 
Uhhh..... hey look Holdo has purple hair! Hahahaha. That is. Hah. That's bad somehow.
> They're trying to make Lucas Film look like they're (uniquely?) taking advantage of the actors.

Precisely. Especially with that thumbnail. 
Erm. I don't know about the video games thing. I would love to know if the Battlefront devs actually received scans of Daisy Ridley's face. I kinda doubt it though, considering the games would feature MUCH lower quality models compared to what they would use in the CGI for films. Remember the games would run on an original Xbox One, which is FAR weaker than a CG studio's render farm. 
> a routine thing that isn't done for the purpose of re-creating a dead person, officially

Yes it has. For Furious 7. 


This is, at best, faux outrage over a routine scan that every blockbuster film does and, at worst, an excuse to hate on the new Star Wars films because people don't like how they were handled.
Oh, I thought it said six months.
Huh. You're right! It does work. Except for the fact that it's not snowing in BvS or JL. But no the times do actually line up, that's my bad. 
The new Call of Duty looks great. 
/r/mildlyundertale
I was about to say... Haven't played League for like four years but I've been playing Fortnite BR since it came out and haven't really found any toxic players on there. 
Same. Mentioning that's she's Hollyhock or Mortal Kombat Date from Master of None should help though. 
Hold up, what's wrong with Vice? Am I missing something?
Not only that. He went from Green Lantern in 2011 and a short-lived TV series in 2012 called The River to writing for Alien Covenant, Logan, Blade Runner 2049, American Gods, and Murder on the Orient Express. *All in 2017.* 2017 really was Michael Green's year. That's four of the smash hits of 2017 (be it financially or critically)... and Alien Covenant.
That would be great. But I wanted a Barbara in her late 20s, just at the age she would be at present day in the DCEU. 

Although what even is that anymore? What year is it in the DCEU? If Man of Steel took place in mid-2013, BvS took place six months later, and Justice League only a few months after that, how did Barry Allen watch an episode of Rick and Morty that aired in late March 2014? Did he speed into Adult Swim and put the episodes on a Flash drive? idk 

Also I don't even know if this is going to be DCEU or not.
Honestly, Bumblebee seems great.
>I only go on the sub occasionally, but I rarely see anything outright hateful, and they're usually not very high up

What a clickbait title. Not even clickbait. People aren't clicking to read the article. 

All major blockbuster productions do this. For CGI doubles. Don't you guys remember the Logan behind-the-scenes video posted on here like a week ago?

Hell, that might as well be all of our usernames. Probably would be mine if I didn't already have an Epic account for Unreal Tournament 4 and Unreal Engine 4. 
Fair enough. 
I wouldn't say I'm obsessed. It's simply something that I've observed myself falling into, so I now try my best to push back against it. I'm not sure your comment complies with the rules of this subreddit though. 
Whoa. That's amazing. 
Sure thing! Here you go. 🌵 
Oh, they do? In that case I feel like it probably was popular there because they hate it lol
Oh yeah, that's true. 
You can absolutely buy them directly. But there are also loot boxes. Sometimes it's all about looking for a good deal or good trade on the skin you want. To me, that's a whole underbelly of the game that is also very exciting to be immersed in, but now it's under question whether CS:GO trading has caused more harm than good. 

Either way, it's a marketplace, so to me, CS:GO purchases are more like investments, and are thus more justifiable to me than Fortnite skins.
Unfortunately, I doubt it goes on sale before it goes F2P.
That's ironic, considering /r/dankmemes is a wretched hive of toxic masculinity and homophobia (and extensions thereupon).
I'm optimistic

Been eyeing the Razer Chroma Blackwidow V2 but the prices went up marginally as of late.

So I'm thinking about other options. I want a good RGB keyboard with tactile and clicky switches (not necessarily Cherry MX Blue, I was going to go for Razer Green). 

Also a question about RGB. Can I get [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0en6dvVMJjM) on any RGB keyboard? I also saw a good one for CSGO.
Maybe PUBG? Idk. You need to practise to be good in CSGO... Hmm.

Tomb Raider 2013 is pretty intensive with maxed out settings but still looks amazing with normal settings I realised.

The whole song borrows a lot from Maps. It's basically a thematic sequel. 
God I love this song. 
Because PC players may not want console players in their squad. 
A coda in musical terms is a passage that ends a piece of music. A previous song on the same album is called "For The Damaged". So "For The Damaged Coda" is a wordplay as well as reprising "For The Damaged" to end the album.
Absolute unit.

My uncle (late 50s) would be prone to this for quite a while since ever since he'd had a smartphone, he'd had tiny weak Android phones with barely any keyboard space (in fact one of them was my old phone that I lent to him, the Galaxy Y). A few weeks ago he got an iPhone and he's been typing totally normally ever since.

Ironically he has the iPhone SE which is super tiny compared to the rest of its generation and every iPhone since. 
Agreed. 
Nope. PC. 
is this some kind of meme?
what 
Gonna need this. Been playing since the day after it went free. Still haven't gotten a win in any mode.
This is practically printing money for Netflix. They can make this for like $1000 an episode excluding salaries. And in addition they can promote their own shows. I'm sure the Netflix reality shows Joel discusses are positively impacted by Joel making fun of them because nobody really watches those reality shows anyway, compared to on E! where him making fun of the Kardashians is actually damaging to a billion dollar brand. 
> No more Netflix bonging sound, which is nice as the joke was getting a bit stale, and yet I also kinda miss it. 

The whole format of the show is stale and that's part of the appeal imo. I loved them using the Netflix "budum" sound because it's infamous in my family.
I was totally expecting it to pan to Feig, Pizza Ghost, and ~~Mankini~~ One Piece Man at the end there.
Fair use m8. They've already used footage from E! on the new show.
Oh. In that case it *is* universal then. Because it's the same misalignment. Oops. 

This is a Twitter meme right now, but Netflix screwed up and the tweet probably blew up before they noticed and people probably aren't giving it much negative attention... except in niche subreddits where people make fun of misaligned text. Point is, it probably didn't make sense for them to delete and fix it.
Not on mobile though, which  the majority of Twitter use is on. I don't think this fits this sub.

It's funny, Hogg wasn't mentioned in this particular single thread at all. It was an understandable mistake though! All the stuff in your inbox, probably a lot to process.

Wow really?

It's strange to me that they would use a modified CryEngine considering that development of the games were taken completely out of the hands of CryTek starting with Far Cry 2.
Really? Could have sworn FC3 was in Unreal Engine. 
Oh. I didn't know they switched over to another engine. Is that in-house from Ubisoft? I've never heard of it. 
It's the emote. That's what it looks like to me, anyway.

Epic needs to start a marketing push. Fortnite is the biggest game in the world right now but it's still dwarfed by regular mobile games. The fact that it's bloodless plus the creative aspect could be used to its advantage to make a killing in the mobile market.
Just about kids spending money their parents gave them? 
Is this like a PS4 exclusive thing...? Because I haven't encountered a toxic or annoying player in Fortnite Squad Fill to date. Going back to play some CSGO the other night was awful by comparison.

What year did you graduate? I went to high school in the 2010s mostly so maybe it's a generation gap thing. Also race, because people of Indian descent tend to be way shorter. 
Oh yeah he's a great bowler. IIRC I even saw him have a really good innings batting as well. Can't remember where or when though. One  of the things I love the most in cricket is the feeling when a lower order batsman (i.e. a bowler) wins the match by hitting some boundaries. For the team I support of course.

Nobody was talking about the woman's looks. It doesn't contribute to the conversation at all. The comment was just there to insult a woman's looks. Sounds deserving of downvotes to me.

Really depends on what you want to prioritise. Personally, I could use the space. 
AMD is awesome. NVIDIA is the one with crappy business practices but they're still pretty awesome regardless. Right now I'd definitely say go for an NVIDIA card because of price gouging. 
Honestly I just crank up my graphics to native resolution and max graphics (without SSAA or MSAA) and see if I can get away with more (most likely not) and then adjust to suit. 
Freaking love gaming laptops. You can carry your rig anywhere.

A lot of people, especially people on this sub say they're not worth it but especially now with GPU prices, they're pretty great. 
What motherboard and case do you have? The front I/O on my 300R and M5A97 r2.0 can be weird sometimes but not straight up not working like that.

Maybe try a BIOS update?

Glad to be of help! :)
This is like the Purge
I don't think so. These guys are clearly having fun and dancing. It would be embarrassing if one guy were doing it and everyone else was staring, and honestly that's what I would have expected Fortnite to give rise to back in September. But instead it has gone wildly mainstream so that "regular" people just do stuff like this in clubs. 
This game has essentially replaced Fifa for a lot of people apparently.

No data is available for my country. That sucks. :/ I was really curious. 
I believe this was also the original intent for JC Denton from Deus Ex. Which is why his name is so gender neutral. 
So far playing Saints Row 2 as a female character, nothing feels out of place at all. You'd think The Boss was 100% written as female, especially since such a wacky unrealistic world is set up.

I play Skyrim as male but I think it's gender neutral enough that it could be any gender. 
Interesting. The singular "them" is used constantly in Undertale and it never feels out of place. Maybe because they don't try to force any particular gender onto the character. 
Oh my gosh yes. Thank God I never got the hang of doing that and never made it a habit. 
That's such a HUGE gameplay change that I can't believe a storm wasn't kicked up about them removing it. Guess that's why it's still in Early Access. 
I find well-programmrd rumble on the controllers goes a long way to immersion. 
Holy crap. The Pink Bear winning the match is so impressive then. He came back from being AFK and played it cool until he was out of your sight and then hauled ass and disappeared without a trace.

Hmmm. Usually it tends to be due to a physical toll though. Some athletes retire in their early thirties because they can't physically do it anymore. That's not the case for e-sports. Though I suppose mental health is also a concern.

Wait, didn't you start "holding like a champ" anyway? 
I don't know how this translates to the general public but I went from having no interest in this to really wanting to see it due to some of the promotion. Lena Waithe endorsing the movie went a long way for me. And then the critics and reviewers say it's really good.

Welcome
I thought the "rito" made it obvious. 
It's $30. You'll have to bring it REAL good to get me to shell out thirty bucks for a game tbh. 
Someone mentioned on another sub that PUBG has no real art direction. There's nothing that really distinctly makes it PUBG besides the gameplay and premise. In a way that's admirable but it's also a huge negative and part of the reason I haven't even thought about buying the game yet. 
Don't worry, mate. My karma is balancing out in general anyway. :P
Well. Yes. I agree with that. It basically was just "haha u wach jacksepticeye ur gay hahahahaha". It's dumb. 
The vast majority of people on Tumblr are female. So it's more likely that the OP is female.

To be clear, the comment I replied to originally just said "his". It was since edited. 
More likely her

No. I don't think anyone hates him for being friends with Felix. Also people who dislike Felix these days have quite valid reasons. 
Absolutely nothing. Maybe just that he still associates with Pewdiepie. Also note that "gay" was being used as an insult here. Which I thought we were past... 
he innocent!!!!!! 
Yup! But she ate egg salad sandwiches. And the bread is HEAVY in carbs. It would be better if she had a lettuce wrap or something.
Krasinski is just as busy though, and he's the one who said this.

I'd say Mike Schur would also be difficult to get, but he's still doing things exclusively for NBC-Universal so I think they could finagle him to produce. 
I immediately heard it in Colin's voice when I read it. 
"Hi, my name's Helen Anne Stevens. What do you mean if I have any other names?"

Because this sub has really gone bad. There's literal transphobic slurs in here and the post is wildly popular and still up.

I'm not really blaming the mods. They're cool and I've spoken to them about this before. But it's getting really out of hand now. 
"Oh no, we're already three minutes in and I don't have any wood!" 
Hey nice it went from 200 upvotes to 1200. ☺ 
Making a new subreddit is absolutely a hassle, but it's pretty easy to migrate when the community is small.... like 200 people. /r/Fortnite is too big now to do that. Additionally, the post histories and stuff will be gone. So the best thing is to have /r/fortniteBR 
Hah. Very clever. Wish this got more attention.
No. They never did. Which is why Drew points it out.
Actually, the credits in a weird style was done for all of the US run except for Season 1 and it wouldn't necessarily be done by the winner. Season 1 just had the performers talking on stage with the music playing over them and the crowd applauding. 

The CW revival does it similar to how it was in the UK days with Aisha asking the "winner" to read the credits. 
Hah. I got a solo kill with the crossbow in early game at point blank range while the other guy had just looted a chest and got an assault rifle. It was 90% luck but 100% awesome.

I really like the crossbow tbh. I use it.
what the heck are you doing here this was my secret subreddit with 400k subscribers
Agreed. Because Black Panther will run and run and will seemingly have fantastic legs. I think Infinity War will smash it on OW and then drop HARD for the second weekend (maybe like 68%), making it very front loaded. 
Oh, it's from /r/dankmemes. That would explain a lot. 
Yeah!!!!! Straight up slurs in /r/teenagers now. Classy. /s

Wow, her last movie was four years ago and it was directed by her husband. Seems like she's working mostly as a spokesperson and rep these days. 
I think you need to check out interviews with Stephanie Beatriz. You'll be in for a surprise.
Awesome! When she was announced to be voicing her in the animated series, there were a lot of people calling for her to play her in live-action. 

Now let's hope the same thing can happen with Oscar Isaac and The Addams Family...
When Tommy said he was "originally [from] Europe" on Jimmy Kimmel Live, James Franco visibly freaked out because Tommy had never actually admitted to it in an interview before. How did you react to that same moment?
Hah.  I remember that part in the book. 
With the original director back, I think this is gonna be great. 
Yep, a short film. It's on YouTube. 
Yup! You got it. I thought it had an underscore. Hope he gets here to give us the info. Spencer is THE Whose Line fan. 
Haha alright

I'm still puzzled as to why they were ever separate in the first place. 
Is it okay to not be American? I am interested. 
That's amazing. 
I do see what the issue is because it sounded like you thought you had to pay for the game on mobile. But I think   it's awful that people are calling you dumb and downvoting you. It's just a misunderstanding. 
I... don't see how this helps you do that.
>then the middle ground is to use the free version in an emulator to try it, right?

yup you should do that
> I think the recent PUBG Mobile pops up a warning saying it will only match with other emulator players.

I tried PUBG Mobile on BlueStacks and got no such warning. In fact I got 6 kills and placed 7th. I assumed because I was playing against people on their phones is why I placed so high.
160 ms isn't THAT bad. I have no idea what my ping is in Fortnite because idk how to check it, but good ping for us in Trinidad is about 90 to 100 in CSGO and Overwatch.
Heck, 14.8 million is huge in this day and age. 
I've been watching an immense amount of Whose Line clips on YouTube lately. So much so that my entire YouTube front page is full of them plus maybe a Linus Tech Tips. I've seen at least three occasions on Weird Newscasters where Colin calls Ryan "Stormy".

12Medbe could probably give you an exact number of times and even the exact episode numbers and taping dates, but I forgot his Reddit username. 
It was not announced but at a game developer's conference recently, footage of it was shown.

Too bad I didn't get any. 🙃
It's fiction. They can make up whatever they want. IMO, the constant use of "world" instead of "Earth", the landmass matching perfectly with Venus, and the acid rain make me totally buy into it. The moon could be explained or handwaved away. That's the fun of fan theories.
Fortnite replays will be coming soon.
The television landscape is a lot more diverse (still not diverse enough though) so hopefully we see some of that spill over into film soon!
Hope so! I liked it.
That does deflate it a bit but I still think it's pretty solid. 
Yep. Which is a great idea, but 800 V-Bucks is too much. Should be 100. 
This is way better than most people have been suggesting. Props. 
Hah. Took my friend's CSGO with steering wheel idea. 
I prefer Guardians 2 as well. Feels a lot more character focused. 
I actually got a hilarious short range crossbow kill tonight. I'll post it tomorrow. 
The BS numbers might be an understatement in many cases. I remember it being a big deal when /r/agentcarter hit 10k subs. There are definitely more than a million Agent Carter fans worldwide... 
Bingo. Fortnite is the biggest game in the world right now. Dedicated subreddits are still a fairly niche thing and while the existence of /r/popular helps, this sub still only has 300k subscribers. PUBG sub has almost twice as many despite the player and viewer bases being lower.

That's because a LOT of people get their Fortnite news from Instagram, Facebook, Word of Mouth, and.... the game itself. 
On a serious note, I'm hoping they expand the game modes a lot when the game leaves Early Access. Imagine having actual 1v1 and 4v4 modes with rounds. 
oooooh 
I was shocked by my friend telling me his age 3 years ago. I thought he was like 31. But now in 2018 I gotta say... he kinda does look his age. :/

Don't often say this about The Game Theorists videos but I 100% buy it. It totally makes sense. 

Except for the part at the end where he says people rocket off and escape to Earth. I think it probably just makes more sense for it to be a Venus colony in the far future where humans somehow terraformed Venus.
Ahahahaha yes. Brilliant. 
Right???? I don't think that would exactly be affordable though hahaha
Ooh I do wonder if I could go to the Puerto Rico show. 
Definitely no tour coming to Trinidad and Tobago. :/

I always imagine that if I had a big sister she'd get me cool stuff I didn't even know I wanted like this.

Still never won a game. 

I've been replaying Tomb Raider (2013) to prepare to play Rise of the Tomb Raider and man I forgot how amazing this game was. It ended up leaving a bad taste in my mouth because when I beat the game the first time (when I just started getting into games and stuff), I did all the optional tombs and started going around collecting all the stuff and was thoroughly bored. It was underwhelming just how little there was to do after the story, especially coming from games like Arkham City on my PS3. 

But damn, it does indeed have replay value. I'm utterly thrilled playing it.
I haven't seen the admins do any wrong yet with the banning of subreddits. If they were banned, it was for a good reason.
Reminds me of the gangsters from Key and Peele. Straight from "we need to deal more drugs and make more crimes happen" to "that's being irresponsible with your finances, Carlito".
I really liked it! Probably the best video game movie objectively outside of Pokemon and Papers Please. 

One thing it was severely lacking was supporting characters. The  changes they made to the retained characters were fine and all, but I really missed the ship crew.
She tried to at one point. 
Uncharted is Tomb Raider, but Indiana Jones. 

Tomb Raider (2013) is Tomb Raider, but Uncharted. 

Tomb Raider (2018) is Indiana Jones, but Uncharted.
You knew about this already, but a third year student in the same course of study as me got permission from the lecturer to take the last five minutes of class to inform us about an opportunity to become a junior travel agent. IIRC the lecturer was the Dean of the entire faculty. If only he had stayed in the room to hear her pitch... 
Hopefully his character dies immediately. Maybe his parachute doesn't work or Cable fires a missile at him or something.

Because I reaaaaally want Terry Crews for J. Jonah Jameson. 
heckh
> They said the 30$ was the premium price you needed to pay for a “fundamentally better shooter”.

The servers are like 12 tick.... Honestly, PUBG looks great and I'm sure I would have a lot of fun with it, but the "fundamentally better shooter" thing is BS considering fundamentals like the tickrate are pretty bad. 
I mean.... This is a quality, critically-acclaimed AAA game. +1 doesn't really matter to me in this case because I'll actually **play** this. 
Thanks so much! It worked. I put the Steam window with HITMAN DLC visible and Episode 2 showed up in the DLC immediately. That was kinda funny.
I mean that's a lot, but I imagine other smaller streamers combined would still make up the majority.
Hah. I didn't even try to get into Level 2 until the second time. 

Funny enough, the second time I found a back passage that let me skip a lot of enemies. It felt so cool.

What? That's really strange. Here in Trinidad where our system is based heavily on the UK system, teachers adding students on social media is somewhat common especially if there are any projects or collaborations. 

Especially with WhatsApp in Sixth Form. We had groups for each subject and the teachers for the subjects in the group.

/r/WhyWereTheyFilming   
Hm. I've played with someone from my Epic Games friends list who was on iPhone and didn't really have any issues apart from the obvious disadvantage of them having to face off against people with M+KB.
I would love if they added a Deathmatch mode or something. That might end up making the most popular mobile deathmatch game ever.
This is hilarious, dude! Hopefully with the replay stuff coming out soon Machinima can be more convincingly made (without HUDs and stuff). Also when Save The World goes free, that'll probably help.
Mainly? I haven't even heard about those guys at all. I just know it from the streamers I watch not playing a game. 
I think Fortnite and PUBG will become mainstays like LoL but CS in some form or another will be the pinnacle of skill-based games for the foreseeable future. 
CS:GO is an e-sport though.
Honestly I am surprised Overwatch is so low with a tournament on plus regular streamers. Overwatch E-Sports is in its infancy though, I suppose.
That sounds amazing. I should try it.
He too tiyod
Dog, I am not worthy to receive you. 
It's important to keep informed. But I understand.

Honestly, especially with stuff like Ragnarok, Black Panther, and the things the TV shows deal with, politics is inevitably discussed in this sub.
Man.... Twitch's embedded video player  has a long way to go.

I really need to play Hellblade. It looks so good.
Yes!!!!! Finally! 

This is not only great for people with weaker systems, but also to check out your demos and see where you went wrong. Also awesome for benchmarkers. I remember when PUBG added the replay feature and made benchmarking it a LOT easier.

Nothing particularly political about that comment, mate. But I do see what you mean.

Hey.... it's a sale.
33 seconds, to be precise
Ooh nice. I'm quite a bit further than you are. That's a great part of the game though.
Welp. I'm now extremely hyped for this. 
How far are you in the game?
this is katana
Hm, that's interesting. Yeah, Far Cry 3 and Blood Dragon run pretty poorly for me. I can max it out, but it varies from like 40 to 70. FreeSync definitely helps smooth that out visually though.
Oh, I've seen a lot of it, but that might be because I'm a mod. I haven't seen what OP is talking about in particular though, like microaggression type stuff except in /r/movies.
heck. 
Ahhhhhh, I see. That's interesting. I wonder how that affects performance.
Yep. 
The 6300 is a three-core six-thread, I believe, but marketed as six core. I could be wrong though. I've learned a lot more since I researched my build.

Ghost Recon Wildlands is pretty heavy on the CPU but is also pretty biased to NVIDIA from benchmarks I've seen. Ran like absolute mess on my PC, even though I can max out Doom at 70+ FPS... 
Yeah, I figured this was where this would go lol. Thanks anyway!


I don't like the upgrade path that going with a Ryzen+Vega CPU would put me in. I already have a 1600 in mind.

It wouldn't be so much of a problem if I were open to building a new system, but I kinda just want to make a minor upgrade to mine at the moment. 
Oh I think the upgrade from 3 to 8 cores would definitely help me. I can kind of already Twitch stream DOOM (2016) with no issues at all, but I noticed today that I was getting a bit of lag when editing a raw photo in Photoshop. I figure it'd probably be better to get an 8350 for GTA, CSGO, and video editing as well anyway. But I wasn't sure if 8350 was the best for the socket. Is it? 
I think you missed the word "upgrade" in there, mate. 
No way, man. I'm planning on upgrading to Ryzen later on. Getting a whole separate motherboard is not in the cards
Someone reported this for targeted harassment lol 
I haven't particularly seen what you're talking about, but some links in modmail would be nice, OP. If you even considered saying the R word, we should take a look at it. 

And please keep reporting racism, guys. 
I don't think there is a non-filtered one. It's a deep fried meme. There's a lot of alt-right/edgy humour people over on /r/DeepFriedMemes. I downvote most of the posts I see from there on my front page these days. 
Same here
Thanks for the guide!
>  i have an asus 24” 1080p freesync monitor that Im currently using with an r9 380.

Hm. I think it's more realistic than Overwatch. :P But I do get what you mean. Still, I find lately I've been wanting to recommend the game more.
Try out Fortnite. Been absolutely loving it.
Prices for DDR4 are through the roof so it's not viable for me to upgrade to Ryzen right now. I'm on an AM3/AM3+ socket and have an FX-6300. What can I upgrade to?
This is awesome! I can't wait to try this kinda stuff out.
Awwwww he think he getting pet thru the glass :'(
I've owned Human Revolution since I got it as a gift in September 2014. I played it a bit but put it down.

I've owned the previous titles in the franchise since February 2015 when I purchased the Eidos Anthology (30 bucks). And then a few months ago my friend gifted me Mankind Divided. So I figured it was time to get cracking on the series so I took it from the top. 
Wow! I totally forgot about that.
This looks fantastic! Seems like it has the potential to be really heartwarming.
The Tumblr post might be from a long time ago when you couldn't find it from simply Googling 
Those aren't Epic Games. You mean Unreal Tournament? 

*budum tiss*
Deus Ex is so good, right? Really immersive. 
I think I'm close to the end of the original **Deus Ex**. What a game. I think I want to replay it immediately using what I've learnt going in blind before moving on to Invisible War.

Of course... **Fortnite**. Is there anything else to say?

Also been trying out **Rules of Survival** whole waiting for Fortnite mobile on Android. It's kinda bad. But it's heaps of fun and a very satisfying distraction. The daily challenges are great. 

Also been trying out **H1Z1** because I don't have PUBG and it's been pretty fun too! I could never find a driveable vehicle though.


Just play your backlog of Steam games instead. 
Tbh that was the plan all along for me. Wait for a price drop, get an OG Vive. 
The game is great, but honestly DOOM (2016) Multiplayer is the best to replicate the old feeling of the original Unreal Tournament to me. 
The world needs Tony Stark to solve this problem. 
I think they should fold the screen to play that into the BR mode. Make it another tab to click on rather than a different option than Battle Royale. It'll feel like a whole new game added to the Battle Royale as opposed to something different that people won't play. 
Also, like someone else said here, art direction. PUBG doesn't really look distinctive. Fortnite looks like Fortnite. 
Not true! Life is Strange's spin-off was made in Unity!

...the main game though, Unreal, yeah. 
This is what push-to-talk was invented for. 
WILL!!!!!
Seymour! Tilted Towers is on fire!
For Steamed Meme?
"It's a UN expression" reminds me of "It's a UNATCO expression" from [Steamed Hams But It's Deus Ex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dcNz_EWzvY)
Would be great if I could play it
The Fortnite player base is so huge, that would be a viable option I think.
Just tried it. The storm looks amazing from above, but it was unplayable due to lag. Regular solo mode is fine.

EDIT: And now solo is unplayable.
I'm surprised the matchmaking times didn't drive him insane 
I said "monetize" not "make billions"
Well clearly people are asking for it.
"it" in my sentence meaning  75 Hz
That sounds like an absolute nightmare to me tbh. I can never remember or interpret directions like that
That's awesome! How do you monetize it though? 
How did I read that in Ralph's voice in my head without even knowing it was him...

I don't disagree with the concept.
You still don't get it. I'm not doubting that at all. Obviously if they can understand each other, an advanced alien race figured it out. What I'm saying is that trying to explain it is a lost cause because it can't be sensibly explained. So do like the TARDIS circuits and don't explain it at all. Leave it at "universal translators exist". 
You're misinterpreting what I'm saying. Because what you're saying is exactly my point. There should be absolutely no need to explain it because it doesn't make sense. Language is too complex for the explanation to be that simple. So I'm just saying it should be ignored altogether in the movies, like it seems like it will be. 
You didn't understand what I meant. Maybe I didn't phrase it properly.

I understand the concept of universal translators but I think it's something that is quite far-fetched to do things like translate complex grammatical rules, sayings, slang, and idioms while still retaining meaning in real time. So the explanations James makes don't really make sense.

I said I think that if anything needs to be said about them, it's that they work like the TARDIS translation circuits in that it's essentially just magic. Like Speedforce and Pym Particles. They do what they do just because they do. 
Honestly. I hugely disagree with Gunn on this. So many things wouldn't work in a universal translator. We are almost there for business conversations, conducting transactions, having friendly but simple conversations. We aren't there to translate complex sayings and phrases into ANY language instantly. I think it should just be hand-waved away like in Doctor Who.

I didn't even know Geoff Emerick wrote a book. I've got to read it. 
legitimately very sad

EDIT: Whoa... just watched the Part 2.... damn....
The script says "ye gods"
perfect
Pretty sure Nakia is an heiress
I love love love James Corden. This is the first person I've seen scrolling down this page that I'd be really sad if anything bad came out about him. 
>The video games I've been seeing my son play have been horrible. Very bad. Very bad. And violent... Except Fortnite. That one is great. The best. The best game. 


heck
Can't tell you the difference between 75 Hz and 144 Hz because I haven't seen 144 Hz gaming, but I will say it is a cut above 60 Hz for sure. 
I was in your situation. Hadn't had that big a monitor until I got my 24" 1080p. It is DEFINITELY not the sweet spot for 1080p. I'd say that's about 17" to 21" honestly. I have only seen a 24" 1440p screen briefly but I'd call 24" the sweet spot for 1440p.

That said, I love my VG245H. Which happens to be the monitor you linked there. I think if you go with the 27", you'd think it's too big for 1080p. I say go with the ASUS. Because I'm really happy with this monitor. Really, I chose the 24" because I want my upgrade path to be more 24". 
But.... it is random though right?
Omg. How did they not think people wouldn't notice that.
heck
heck
And it's free? 
Oh it's pretty bad and pretty unpolished. But it's functional, and there are some truly fantastic UI choices. 
heck 
I don't suppose this comment will go over well but here goes...

I feel a little let down at how male the recommendations are. Don't get me wrong, all of these channels (that I've seen) are awesome (especially Tom Scott), but Captain D himself said that his audience is about 90% male (IIRC).

I just wish women were more encouraged to pursue STEM both as a career and through general interest things like these videos.

It kinda bugs me how I watch, like, dozens of TechTubers and only one is female (IFixIt).

I'm not even sure what my point is honestly, I just had to get that out there. 
Eh... The two I know best there, Tom Scott and VSauce were terrible and alright respectively. 
Was it actually Brady's voice? It kinda did sound like him. I've never heard of that channel though. I just recognised the format from Numberphile and Computerphile. 
heck
heck
heck
Hah. Nah. I got 4 kills and placed 38th the first time and then 1 kill and placed 6th the second time.

But  I feel like a kill is more within reach than Fortnite. Is that weird? 
heck
Funny enough, I'm coming FROM Fortnite and trying this out because I can't wait for Fortnite on mobile and. I like it a lot!
I haven't tried Squad yet, and idk if I will. I get that fulfillment from Fortnite, CSGO, and Overwatch. This is just a spot of mobile fun for me.
Whoops. Not 2JL in that case... I don't know what kind of math I was using there. 
I cried in Ant-Man, Civil War, Doctor Strange (when he was trying to write his name), Guardians 2, Homecoming, and Black Panther. I've also cried numerous times at Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., once at Agent Carter, and multiple times in Daredevil and Jessica Jones.

Get on my level m8.
Something like that. 
Possibly.

My theory is that it's the line he says before he resets the universe and "balances" it. It seems like this will be his motivation. To balance the universe by taking an unfathomable number of lives
YES!!!!!! IT WAS PERFECT! Showed me enough of the plot for a great trailer. Felt more like a Trailer 1 and the Trailer 1 felt more like a teaser.
Ah alright cool! Thanks.
My friend is gonna be able to run this better on her brand new iPhone 8+ far better than on her laptop with an i3.
What if you buy the season pass on one platform. It will transfer to the others, no?
Just saw some stream footage of it running on the X. Damn, it's so smooth.
I'm on Android. Guess I have some time to clear up some space....
I do see what you mean now. 
Sell at $100 and watch your stock disappear immediately. 
I ordered multiple things at the same time and they all came in the same box. So assuming I get 20,000 boxes:

* 20,000 [ASUS USB Bluetooth adapters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DJ83070?ref=yo_pop_ma_swf)
* 20,000 copies of [*Meet Me In The Bathroom: Rebirth and Rock and Roll in New York City 2001 - 2011* by Lizzy Goodman](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0062233092/) 
* 20,000 [Behringer U-PHORIA UMC404HD 4-input audio interfaces](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00QHURLHM?ref=yo_pop_ma_swf)
* 20,000 [6-ft male DVI-D to male HDMI cables](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014I8UQJY?ref=yo_pop_ma_swf)

Obviously I'd have so much that I'll be giving a bunch of these things away to friends and family and even strangers as well. And I'm gonna take the perspective of selling everything as fast as possible rather than supplying retail stores with the things in bulk over a long period of time, which would require completely different calculations. 

Another ground rule for the scenario: Zero legal fees or consequences (including civil suits). 

I know quite a few people who would benefit from the audio interfaces, and I'd be a legend over on /r/wearethemusicmakers if I gave away 200. I also want to help stimulate the music industry where I live so a local giveaway would be awesome too So say I put aside 3,000 of the interfaces. That's still 17,000 left to sell. Where I am, I could sell them for about $125 apiece. I might have to sell most online though where I could lowball it for 80 bucks removing say $20 for shipping. That's $1.02M.

I could probably sell all the bluetooth USB adapters here if I just go up to people and lowball it a LOT. So much that it wouldn't make sense to pass up the deal at all. Five bucks. That's pure profit right there. Keeping back 2000, that's $90k.

If I sell the books for $10 each again keeping back 2000 of them, that's $180k.

Say I keep 2000 of the cables and sell the rest at $5 each. Another $90k.

Total profit: $1,380,000.

Sounds like an awesome life to me. 
Are your shoes American Eagle? I think I have the same pair.

That's badass BTW. I've been playing so much Doom lately. 
hecko
Considering they said "it's probably really impressive effects", I don't think they even watched the video.
The long con
...What? Look at the video, dude.
It's more like he can't imagine being unselfish in any way at all. 
Oh, so they're just using from previous tapings for this season? A shame. The political climate is PERFECT for Whose Line.
wow.... i'm gonna start doing that with new episodes!
One of the first videos that got me into doggos :') 
Beep beep beep beeep
Hm. I'm not really into watching big steamers. I mostly watch CSGO and Overwatch e-sports, breebunn, echoics, and a few small streamers. On Twitch at least. So I don't really know the big streaming community. 
heck
Hm. I guess I'll see if I watch his stream more going froward. 
Ben Shapiro is absolutely terrible. You saw his comments on the March For Our Lives yesterday? Ugh. 
Yeah totally. 
I'm not going to even engage in this conspiracy theory nonsense.  
People are getting downvoted in here and the conspiracy theory stuff is getting upvoted.... are you kidding me???
It is.
You forgot to mention that he's the "edgy" type much like Notch as well.
[Travis Scott](https://i.imgur.com/iHDZkJU.png)
I doubt that. It might just be people who don't really care about the streamers and whatnot just choosing to not upvote it. E-sports discussion on /r/Overwatch is very thin.

Idk. It's just that I wouldn't yell at a new friend that way I guess. At good longtime friends sure. But he's not just "messing around" you can tell he's getting pretty competetive. But it's a single flaw, it's not like that makes him a bad person or anything. He seems pretty nice.

Raising money for charity will always put a good mark for someone in my book but it doesn't necessarily mean much if everything else about someone is a red flag. Pewdiepie still does charity stuff, right? Either way, Ninja isn't like that at all from what I can tell. He seems pretty cool. 
I think he's talking specifically about movies. But yeah, Beasts of No Nation, Betting on Zero, Hush. There are a lot of great Netflix films.
Same. I really though it was a limited time thing until the game blew up and... it stayed. 
I saw him yell at Travis Scott a bit just now. I do see where they're coming from. But he seems like an alright guy otherwise. 
I love them. Reminds me of Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. 
Yes! I got this on my second ever game. I thought that it was a feature and was confused when I played the game again.
I think it's all platforms but XB1. Not sure how crossplay works on that. But between PC, PS4, and iOS, it will be fully cross play compatible.
heck
Pretty sure it was like that since the start. I was here the day after Battle Royale came out and people were discovering it and assuming it was a glitch that allowed PS4 players to spawn in PC servers.
You're right. It's just that you kinda expect someone with a big fanbase of kids especially to keep his cool more. But yeah it didn't sound too bad. It was just a bad first impression for me. I see that I was mistaken now tbh.
The first I even heard of him was someone in here talking about how he was calling a player bad for crouch walking and killing him. I rolled my eyes because it reminded me of awful CSGO people. But then I saw some of the lets players and whatnot I follow on Twitter interacting with him and he seems alright. Actually watching him.... yeah he seems pretty cool .
This is actually my first time watching him. He seems like a nice guy. 
Fortnite has cross-platform.
Yeah, I thought people were overreacting on Twitter... but they aren't. Fortnite really has taken the world by storm.

Ironically, this is barely cracking top ten on the subreddit. 
Yo! I was waiting for this series to come back. I hope it becomes a lot more regular.

I'm so ready for this.
Awwwww he don't understand babby can't throw ;-;

Nope. I've got Marshmallow. Doubt we'll be getting a Nougat update for the Note 4 though. 
heck
myself today 
That's kinda personal 
I'm worried now because I have a Galaxy Note 4. It's closer in specs to the S6 (which will most likely be supported) than the S5 (which is the same generation as the Note 4) but only released a month after the iPhone 6 so I'm starting to doubt it will be supported.
How about a highly simplified (and smaller) game world? And less players. So this isn't the 50v50 I'm talking about anymore. Maybe 20v20. World about the size of the third circle. Max resources. No pre-existing houses or structures on the map, just completely flat. Wall in the middle for the first two minutes. So when the wall lowers, both teams' structures are revealed. 
This is one of the few LGM suggestions I've seen on here that I think is great.
