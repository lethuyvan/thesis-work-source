Why not? Doubt Milan will let him go but he's a good and versatile player with a proven record at least in Serie A. Could be a good signing if he comes for cheap and we end up losing Khedira.
Non so davvero più cosa pensare, quando i dati dicono che le cose sembrano migliorare basta guardare i dati in modo più approfondito per capire che invece non è esattamente così. Ma oltretutto cifre come queste per disoccupazione totale e giovanile sono comunque allarmanti, siamo davvero un paese malato.
It's a bit disappointing Zenit never really followed up on their European success, I expected them to become a regular in the CL knockout stages when they began spending big and won the EL.
Ero la per lavoro e non ho potuto approfondire più di tanto ma non mi stupirei assolutamente se fosse proprio così. In fondo si tratta di un paese piccolo con differenze tra le varie realtà ed esigenze tutto sommato esigue, vero è che per una qualità di vita del genere a qualche libertà si rinuncia più facilmente.
A saperlo! Cambiare cultura, attitudine ed economia sono processi che richiedono generazioni.
Would she really want to get sucked into the whole thing? What's the point of getting to see the shit flinging, it's much better to just ditch the guy and avoid further drama.
Confermo, c'è un sacco di varietà e scelta ed oltretutto costa relativamente poco.
Quanto detto da altri è vero ma la città è pulita da far spavento, tanto servizi eccellenti a costi contenuti (trasporti su tutti) e la gente è molto educata e aperta - non so cosa dicano dietro alla gente ma il razzismo strisciante io l'ho trovato praticamente ovunque e almeno qua non vedi persone esasperate come da noi. E lo dico da uno che la prima volta aveva avuto un'immagine di una città molto plastica e fasulla eh, a livello culturale non ho potuto approfondire ma è pur sempre una città rivolta agli affari, cmq di musei ce n'è tanti e lo sport è parecchio praticato e promosso.
Torno in patria dopo una settimana a Singapore, d'accordo che qua sono avanti davvero su tutto ma mi sono accorto che noi non ci rendiamo bene conto di quanto siamo messi male a qualità di vita e civiltà.
True, winning this year would be meaningful and not just the usual consolation prize for not winning the CL.

He needs to go. We can't keep having him around until he can't stand up anymore, I'm sorry his career is gonna end on a sour note but we need to turn the page, we can't give him more seasons until he can go out on the terms he wishes for.
Super Hans?
Real difference is that to build in Belgium you need apply for appropriate permits, in Sardinia you can build anywhere and then wait for the authorities to do absolute jack shit about it.

Thanks! Really puts the sheer longevity of her reign in perspective.
At the time everyobdy was screaming bloody murder for doing away with the Holo design language. Brighter colours, rounder angles and animations were seen as an attempt at eyecandy to the detriment of function. People are just reluctant to change in general, although I agree the Google app is the epitome of unnecessary and regressive design changes.
Hold on so technically one could be monarch of the UK/Canada/Australia etc. but not head of the Commonwealth? Could the member states name someone else, and if so who fits the requirements?
I love Thiem but it's great to see Nole as the underdog turning this around.
With the possibility of a Zverev bros square off next round I was wondering how much of their life on the road they share. Do they stay at the same hotels and hit together when they're in the same tournament?
I usually charge between 10PM and midnight and I had it kick in maybe once or twice. Then again I usually unplug it before it reaches 100%, I guess battery care just never detects the battery staying at 100% often and long enough to trigger.
I think she's great as a player and I definitely like her personality, but I don't really dig the "lavish lifestyle" persona. She seems to me more more like a "working hard on the court" type and that she's getting pushed into this other archetype, at least on IG.

Edit: to sum up, I believe she has enough of a personality to show without having to resort to the empty and tired Insta-model aesthetics.
I follow her on Instagram and it looks to me like her PR people are trying too hard. I don't think she has the social network charisma à la Bouchard or Cibulkova, her profile comes off as a bit contrived and disingenuous.
Sue I'm not saying the standards bewteen Morocco and "the west" are comaprable all across the board, I've been once and definitely share some of your sentiments (as a dude I never really felt uncomfortable but I see your point). However, these guys travel around a lot and I'm sure it takes a bit more than a roach in the room or long waits at immigration for someone with Seppi's mileage to comment so harshly. 
Borna are you kidding me? Definition of anti-climatic right there.
That is definitely not true in regards to Marrakech, it's a popular tourist destination with many good hotels and facilities. It's not a remote city in the middle of nothing, if the hotel and services were bad it's definitely the event organisers who should be blamed for their picks.

I initially went with "Gora Dolina" because it sounded like it could be a real place but it's a dumb name in English too so the translation was never gonna work anyway.
It reminded me of [the scene from Back to the Future](http://www.bollardsinmovies.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/doc-brown-clock-tower-back-future.jpg), the town where the film is set is called Hill Valley.

Nishikori is an established top player and one of the biggest sports stars in the country, I'm sure Naomi is yet to hit peak popularity so I don't find it that outrageous that he still gets preferential treatment.
Ho degli amici che contano i "mi piace" su Facebook come poco meno di una scopata, al grido di "ma se non me la vuole dare allora perchè mai si sarebbe presa la briga di mettermi il like"? Come se fosse una cambiale solo da incassare a loro discrezione e comodo.
If we don't drop points tonight we set up match point on Sunday. I'm sure that despite the Madrid drama the squad is as motivated and engaged as ever, tonight it's a must win.
Can Bedene at least try and make it a contest against Rafa? I remember at some point last year he had a great streak on clay.
They're both overpriced, Torreira is possibly even overrated. Lotito and Ferrero are masters at inflating the price of their players.
He was also incredibly smart tactically, a fair player, a leader on the pitch and speaks I don't know how many languages fluently and eloquently, all the while being rather down to earth. Despite being one of our worst enemies (he destroyed us even when he played for Sampdoria) I always liked the guy and the player a lot and I think he's seriously overlooked in the discussion for the best midfielders of the mid 90s-mid 00s discussion.
I was sure we had squeezed every last drop out of him but apparently he's a bottomless pit of mental and physical energy. I think he's earned the right to make the call: if he feels he's still motivated then I see no reason to get rid of him, otherwise if he needs a new challenge he'll go as a cult hero.
Yawn
This is great, thanks a lot! I'm really looking forward to my trip :)
Fantastic, we're probably gonna stay in Batumi for three nights and take day trips so these destinations sound perfect. Since you seem very helpful I have another question - after Batumi we're going to visit Vardzia but since it's a long drive anyway we'd like to drive down the შ1 through Zvare, Khulo, Adigeni etc. We plan on spending that day driving with a couple breaks along the road, are there any places worth stopping over? Thanks a lot.
I'm gonna spend a couple days in the area this summer, does anyone have suggestions for nice beaches? Batumi itself seems a bit chaotic and busy, I've read about Mtsvane Kontskhi but other tips are welcome!
I feel like he will be a key pawn in the Schalke-Juve negotiations for Pjaca. I know I'm pretty much the only one to believe this but I think Schalke will try and sign him permanently and Marko wouldn't mind. I can see Schalke's management throwing in a great deal for Benny to make our management more eager, and the fact that Allegri is trying to integrate him in the squad makes me think Marotta is at least thinking about the opportunity.
Are we really comparing the two incidents? Zidane freaking hedbutted a player right in the chest, ok Materazzi was a grade-A asshole but Zizou's gesture was really outrageous. Buffon just got a deserved red but he didn't assault anybody and even what he said afterwards was butthurt but not that offensive. Zidane got his slack cut because there was Materazzi to blame but what he did is far worse.
For those unfamiliar, outside of this neighbourhood Plovdiv is actually a very pretty city.
Their Twitter must be handled by the same people that send emails at Roma.
What I'm saying is that you get offered a job like that, you take it. More money, more prestige, a coveted club where he can leave his mark in football history. I can imagine it must hurt as a fan, but can't really blame him or expect him to do otherwise.
Well Bayern have the opening now and not next year. There is no way he could turn the opportunity down, it may never present itself again.
I feel really stupid now after thinking he was a fraud and we had got shafted by Bayern. Incredible player, he does what he wants with the ball at his feet.
Perfect week for Roma fans so far
good bot
Nevermind my flair, but an hour or so and a warm shower isn't exactly "time to compose himself" at the end of such an emotional rollercoaster ride of a match, given the penalty was the last nail in the coffin in realising that he'll never win the CL as a player. He was of course out of line both after the call and during the interview, but he's gonna be upset for far longer. Madrid fans who were in the stadium and could feel the tension in the game were able to cut him some slack, so should we IMO.
What is the point of these posts? Complaining to no end about this call makes us no better than the dozens of clubs who do the same against us week after week. I honestly think it was a clear penalty, even if you disagree on the "clear" bit we can't argue the ref had all the reasons to call it. It sucks and we ddi not deserve it, but how many times have we won a match because of a last minute episode? This time unfortunately we're on the losing side, that's football.
Non l'ho persa affatto, ma per quanto fuori luogo il suo comportamento mi sembra perdonabile alla luce del contesto. Si tratta pur sempre di uno dei giocatori più amati e più sportivi al termine di una partita pazzesca con epilogo incredibile, ho visto e sentito molto di peggio. 
Non si è comportato bene ma penso che gli si può concedere un episodio di debolezza. In quel momento gli si è palesata la dura verità ossia che non vincerà mai la Champions (dopo l'esclusione dai mondiali), l'emotività del momento ha avuto la meglio. Quante volte si è comportato in modo esemplare? Sto giro gli è saltato il fusibile, è umano anche lui e può capitare. Sono sicuro che nei prossimi giorni troverà modo di scusarsi e queste scenate gli verranno perdonate.
Il punto secondo me è che come noi non abbiamo ragione di lamentarci per ieri, nella stragrande maggioranza dei casi le decisioni prese nei confronti della Juve sono corrette. La squadra più forte e più "influente" viene vista come quella che ruba dai più deboli, che sia oggettivamente vero o meno. In Italia non siamo mai in questa situazione ma il fatto che lo siamo in Europa non rende il fallo di Benatia meno da rigore di quel che è.
Da gobbo girano le palle parecchio per ieri sera, ma mi spiace vedere così tanti altri tifosi avercela a morte con l'arbitro, Ronaldo, Vasquez e compagnia cantante. Rigore giustissimo, inutile che facciamo i piagnistei, certo meritavamo quantomeno i supplementari, ma purtroppo gli episodi capitano e stavolta è toccato a noi subirlo. Sono convinto che questa partita servirà molto a chi resterà per fare quel decisivo salto di qualità dal punto di vista della mentalità, è più chiaro che mai che siamo al livello delle grandissime e l'anno prossimo avremo sicuramente altre chance.
It's been one of the worst performances of his this year.
Losing to Liverpool on penalties in their home stadium no less.

I will be downvoted to hell but this (and other bits of social media I've seen posted from/about players) is really far from being good banter. These are regular guys after all, I don't find it all that astounding that they have a sense of humour.
Dipende dal disequilibrio gradimento/prospettive. Se il corso X ti piace 90 e ha prospettive 60, forse ti conviene scegliere quello invece del corso Y che ti piace 40 e ha prospettive 80. Ma se X sta a 80/30 e Y a 60/90 allora magari puoi rivalutare. Metti i due elementi sul piatto della bilancia e fai la tua scelta, del prestigio non vedo cosa te ne possa fare onestamente.
If Khedira wants to score one of his random hat-tricks, this is the right time! Jokes aside, the pressure's off so I just think we need to play to win and not worry too much about passing. Right now it's about sending a message, and maybe give Zizou a bit of a scare.
Che l'Università possa essere causa di troppo stress è fuor di dubbio, ma non me la sentirei di dare ad essa la colpa di questa situazione. Piuttosto mi pare che il problema grosso fosse di comunicazione e comprensione all'interno della famiglia della ragazza, in fondo l'Università è la stessa per tutti e di ragazzi che non riescono a star dietro al proprio corso è pieno il mondo. La riflessione da fare a mio avviso è quella rispetto a come viene intesa l'Università come tappa nella vita di un giovane da alcune famiglie e come il supporto "materiale" (pagamento retta, vitto e alloggio) da parte della famiglia non basti talvolta a colmare il vuoto lasciato dal mancato sostegno morale.
I remember singing it in kindergarten with all the other kids (I was 3 in 1990 and lived in Italy). It was a bittersweet tournament for Italy but the song was great.

He knows very well that if he serves it to Ivo's backhand he's not gonna be able to hit a return down the middle that can cause trouble. Worth taking the risk to get that extra angle on the slice out wide.
Totally stealing this for when I have grandchildren.
I'm a bit hot and cold about this, but I definitely think we're in need of a change in playstyle because many of the players that have made our current brand of football possible have either left (Vidal, Bonucci) or have been squeezed to the last drop (Chiellini, Barzagli, Mandzukic, Marchisio). I think Allegri can pull it off, we already had a succesful change at the helm when he came in for Conte and I'm worried a further transition wouldn't go as smoothly. In any case, Max will surely be under heavy scrutiny next season.
Riguardo all'ultimo punto, sono un utilizzatore abbastanza assiduo di Airbnb e di "extra" in nero non me ne sono mai stati proposti. Riguardo al resto hai sicuramente ragione, ma è anche vero che una struttura ricettiva vera e propria è in grado di dare servizi (pulizie, servizio bar, colazione, mezza/completa pensione) che l' Airbnb di natura non prevede e quindi è naturale che le regole siano più stringenti dal momento che sono anche maggiori le opportunità di guadagno sull'ospite.
Visto che sai il croato per fare pratica vai su siti (o qualsiasi cosa a cui tu abbia accesso) in serbo, magari per imparare da 0 il cirillico serve a poco ma di sicuro può aiutare l'avere a che fare con parole al 99% identiche. Una volta imparato il cirillico serbo, quello russo ha pochissime differenze.

Well isn't that great.
In pratica si sono tutti presentati in griglia con le gomme da bagnato, ad eccezione di Miller (che era in pole) che aveva "scommesso" sulle gomme da asciutto. Pochi minuti prima del via tutte le altre moto cambiano idea e vanno a cambiare le gomme mettendo anch'esse quelle da asciutto; secondo il regolamento questo comporta partenza dalla pit lane (di conseguenza più "lenta", Ciò avrebbe significato un vantaggio considerevole per Miller).  A questo punto la direzione gara decide invece che ci sono troppe moto per garantire una partenza sicura dalla pit lane e ordina che la partenza avvenga dalla griglia, e per garantire comunque un vantaggio a Miller - l'unico ad aver scelto le gomme giuste - si decide per una partenza a griglia "retrocessa" di alcune file. Soluzione molto fantasiosa, in pratica questo è stato il primo caso del genere, e - sebbene probabilmente giusta dal punto di vista del buon senso - sicuramente ingiusta nei confronti di Miller. 
At least this is a signal from Novak that he still cares. It's hard to say right now whether this is gonna work out but this certainly means he is humble enough to go back to proven ways instead of trying more "creative" solutions.
Io abito in città in zone piuttosto centrali da anni e non ho mai pagato più di 1€/litro nemmeno nei tipici negozietti sotto casa in cui tutto costa di più. Latte mi capita di prenderlo alla Conad, Coop, Lidl, MD e i prezzi sono quelli anche vicino a dove lavoro nella prima cintura.
Non so dove compri il latte ma l'UHT io lo prendo al supermercato a 0.80€ al litro al supermercato. In Polonia sono stato poco ma ricordo che tra tutti i beni, gli alimentari sono tra quelli su cui c'è meno differenza di costo con l'Italia.
Secondo me la cosa più ridicola è stata la farsa della griglia retrocessa. Bella ricompensa che han dato a Miller per aver fatto la pole e averci visto giusto nella scelta delle gomme, è stato davvero depredato di una vittoria certa.

What a total shitshow! Are they really just moving the grid a few rows back? Totally ridiculous and appallingly unfair to Miller.

L'unica è cambiare casa. Purtroppo prima o poi capita di trovarsi in situazioni di disagio abitando con altri. A me è capitato due volte, la prima se ne andò la persona con cui io (e non solo) avevo dei problemi, la seconda ho alzato i tacchi io.

I don't think this is even up for that much of a debate. For Western civilization, anglosphere white lives are the most important, followed by European and so on. Just look at the global reception of tragic events in Facebook or other western centric media, everyone is ready to change their profile pic to the French flag but no one bats an eye when the same tragedies hit anywhere that isn't north America, Europe (not even all of it) or Oceania.

La differenza è che la compagnia telefonica si propone come fornitrice di un servizio, per cui peraltro paghi, e se saltasse fuori che fanno una cosa del genere sarebbe uno scandalo visto che non è contemplato che ascoltino le chiamate per questi scopi. Facebook è invece risaputo che usa la tua attività per profilarti e lucrarci sopra tramite pubblicità mirate.
Italy works this way, the government proposed a switch to jus soli (you're a citizen if you're born here regardless) a few months back. Usually countries that have a history of outwards migration such as Italy retain the jus sanguinis model while countries whose population is largely made up of immigrants (like the Americas) are jus soli-based.
Now it's when it gets hard for Roma, too often I've seen Barça play it cool for a half hour, let the other team get comfortable and then suddenly raise the flame and cook them with 2 goals in the space of 5 minutes.

I mean this guy doesn't really make good points but I gotta say it doesn't look like Andre has been all that influential. Novak just hasn't played anything above lacklustre tennis for the past 15 months and has shown dubious judgement when it comes to managing his recovery time. Andre can't be totally exempt of blame as his coach.
I'd say drop them a messsage and tell them you did not expect a negative review and to please explain what went wrong that you seemingly couldn't detect. The reference itself doesn't sound negative and I'm sure it would puzzle potential future hosts more than anything. If your previous host did not enjoy having you over at the very least they owe you and the community an explanation.
Posso darti un consiglio da snob? La domenica è tradizione che sia in famiglia che al pub si mangi il cosiddetto ["Sunday Roast"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_roast), secondo me fai un'esperienza più genuina che non un hamburger che di buoni ormai se ne trovano ovunque. Qualsiasi zona a Londra è piena di pub che lo fanno (è Pasqua per di più!), magari fatti consigliare da /r/London in base alla zona su cui orbiterai. 

Per brunch/colazione consiglio Bill's, ce n'è vari disseminati in tutta la città. Un po' fighetto come posto ma carino e le uova Benedict sono un must.

Edit 28/3/2018 for future reference: I found tickets Malpensa-Kiev-Tbilisi for 217€/person round trip. Prices for direct flights to Kutaisi seem to hover around 280-300€ at best for now. Back in January they were as cheap as 150€.
Conosco bene il kurtoskalacs, è il dolce nazionale anche in Ungheria, in Romania l'ho solo visto a Bucarest perchè in Transilvania non sono mai stato e nel sud è meno comune.
In the eyes of many they earned a lifetime supply of cocksucking from the media with the 2006 WC. I can guarantee that hadn't we won it, De Rossi and Buffon wouldn't be anywhere near the national team or at least wouldn't still be this influent. This eternal gratitude fucked our football over for the past decade, same thing happened in 1982 - the "senators" become untouchable and they're left to run the show, doesn't matter if they crashed out of two World Cup at the hand of New Zealand and Costa Rica, they have infinite credit with the press and a majority of the fans. We Italians are like that, give us a man who looks succesful and strong and we'll let him do what he likes until it's too late.
Un po' meno che negli altri paesi balcanici e specialmente nelle città più piccole, ma abbastanza da non costituire un problema. Il tedesco è spesso la seconda lingua principale, l'italiano lo parlano molto meno di quanto mi aspettassi (anche se per questo credo la situazione cambi di regione in regione).
That Toro was great, not even Juve fans were happy when they lost that UEFA cup, especially the way they did. 
Sono stato due volte, la prima volta nella zona delle Porte di Ferro al confine con la Serbia, la seconda invece sul delta del Danubio. Se resti almeno una settimana oltre a Bucarest (bella ma in definitiva non così diversa da una qualsiasi capitale dell'Europa centrale/est) consiglio assolutamente la zona del delta, davvero bellissima, selvaggia e pittoresca. Si raggiunge Tulcea con 3-4 ore di macchina da Bucarest e poi altrettante di traghetto dentro alla riserva naturale per raggiungere i paesini sui vari rami. Sul tragitto troverai parecchi monasteri e villaggi caratteristici.

Se hai meno tempo e vuoi fare una gita meno impegnativa puoi visitare come hanno detto altri Brasov e/o Sibiu, non ci sono stato ma ne ho sentito parlare benissimo - da quel che ho capito si stratta di città più di stampo "Mitteleuropeo". [La parte centrale del paese ha un sacco di castelli e altre amenità.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_castles_in_Romania) In ogni caso è un paese molto ricco di cose interessanti. L'unico neo forse la cucina, le specialità sono buone ma mangiando "in giro" il livello non è eccelso.
Their serve is of course the foundation of their game but they both have game. Especially Karlovic's style can be difficult to figure out as it's quite unique. Isner's is more standard-big-guy but I also think his ground game is better than many people make it out to be.
Just one issue I found with the theme - I use an app to change my wallpaper daily and this morning, after the switch, the navbar on the home page (on Xperia Home at least) was black instead of transparent. Reapplying the theme fixed it.
Turin, Italy - crossing the road not depending on where you need to go but on which direction has the green light.
Well done, I'm also not a fan of the new buttons - they're not Xperia-like enough. Just out of curiosity, I saw that you're using the new dialer - did you install it from the .apk (as I did) or did you get an OTA update?
I think one of the main differences is the amount of exposure the players get nowadays. There is so much filler coverage that players need to resort to PR fodder if they want to stay sane, even the ones with a more feisty character or stronger personalities cannot be expected to always bring the entertainment value when they have to go through hours of Q&As, meet-and-greets and whatnot. Have sports rivalries become more sanitised? Certainly, but it definitely does not mean that we're lacking characters, even someone as polite and straight edge like Federer often gives interesting contributions and interesting commentary, same for dozens of other players. I'd much rather see sportsmanlike conduct and players showing their personality otherwise than acting like dicks just for the drama or being cocky just for the hell of it. For all other intents and purposes we have the Kyrgios', Safins, Gulbis' and Fogninis, it's not like we're strapped for exhuberant personalities.

> Fitness regimes have been around for a long time

Sure, but as in any other field big strides forward have been made in regards to nutrition, training, conditioning, even equipment and materials. Just 20 years ago it would have been unthinkable to have players over 30 play a full schedule, let alone dominate the tour.

> Performance enhancing drugs...not so long.

I don't think that is true, PEDs have been around for the best part of the last 50 years. I'm sure lots of progress has been made in that department too though.
Si, il mio collega si lamenta dell'odore di cibo. Il mio ufficio è molto piccolo e senza prese d'aria, non essendoci un'area pausa se piove sono costretto a mangiare li dentro perché nelle immediate vicinanze non c'è nulla di raggiungibile a piedi. faccio arieggiare la sera e durante le pause ma a quanto pare questo non è gradito. Sicuramente ha le sue ragioni ma esternare in certe maniere è sempre sbagliato, e comunque già in passato ho notato comportamenti ostili suoi nei miei confronti per cose anche ben più futili. La cosa che mi ha spiazzato è che ciò possa aver influito sull'opinione che gli altri hanno di me visto che è stato l'unico a comportarsi mai in tal modo
I think age is the last of Nole's problems right now, 30-31 is definitely not old anymore for athletes who have access to modern methods and technologies to stay fit. Between winning everything and what Nole has been facing for the past year there are loads of shades of gray.
He was also much stronger in the game than in real life! I kinda miss the Japanese riders, back then there were a bunch of them who challenged at least for the podium on a regular basis.

Non c'è una gran storia, sto sulle palle ad un collega e ieri me lo ha fatto presente in modo deciso, sottolineando come non fosse l'unico a pensarla così. L'ha fatto con modi e toni che non penso di meritare e che mi hanno fatto pensare che lo stronzo tra i due possa più essere lui, ma il bagno di merda intanto me lo sono preso e portato a casa.
I think Rusedski is being overly optimistic here, Djokovic's "best" is setting the bar way too high at the moment for the level he should be back at in such a short time. I think Djokovic should realistically aim at winning a few matches during the clay Masters, making second week at the French and slowly gain momentum and game time. If he becomes obsessed with coming back to his level or posting results he's gonna make things harder for himself. If he finds confidence I can see him hitting good form for the ~~US~~ North American summer hardcourt swing.

[Looking at this post from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Juve/comments/86ap3e/the_1415_team_the_first_year_allegri_with_allegri/) we can see how much the team has changed in three seasons, it's impossible to predict what the team is going to look like in another 5. There are new players breaking through every year and others moving even more often, this time next year we may be taking about players who aren't even on the radar yet.
That was underwhelming.

Do we really have to always make it a matter of who's better than who in the grand scheme of things? Whatever your opinion Stanimal was so much fun to watch and a nice diversion from the Big 4 domination, it's a pity he's not healthy right now because if we were to make a list of the best matches this decade I'm sure he'd be in a hell of a lot of them.
I think Oscar's case is an extreme, he went to China 100% for the money. In Griezmann's case, Barcelona is really just a better job, the only factor that could make him question the choice would be loyalty to Atletico but I think he's leaving on good terms anyway.
I think at this stage top players are after a "career" just like anyone else at the top of their field. Atletico is a big club where he fits right in and he can fight for trophies, but Barça offers better pay, more exposure, and higher chances of winning. Imagine you had a better offer from a competitor of the company you work for, for very little potential tradeoff (maybe more competition, slightly lower "status" within the company itself). Some people would be content with passing the opportunity and remaining comfortable but the more competitive of the bunch would certainly try and make the most of it.
My issue with this kind of diagrams is that they consider "straight line" only the ones that stem outwards from the center of the circle in which the country/island is inscribed. You can still travel in a straight line but in different directions from the same point, in fact I think you can travel from Iceland to Greenland on a straight line from most of the country excluding the southeastern coast (roughly the portion between "Morocco" and "Jan Mayen" in the post).

Sbaglio a pensare che Milano stia diventanto un centro di riciclaggio di denaro cinese? Tra la storia del Milan, il boom di popolazione e affari e il comportamento di certi clienti per l'azienda in cui lavoro mi sto facendo qualche idea.
Or maybe she was the one who didn't change the sheets and thought OP was onto her when he called to get the towels sorted so tried to make amends on the fly before she got found out.
I think ever since Inter's triplete, that has become the actual challenge. Winning CL would be massive and I for one would trade this year's scudetto for it, but we gotta get the treble if we want to settle once and for all that this one is the greatest Italian team of all time. I think we can achieve it, we already got so close, so I think it's the right call for the club not to compromise on any target for the season.
When I was a kid I wondered why he did not bring Vialli to the Euro 96, as he seemed to be one of the best and most charismatic players around. My grandfather told me it was sour grapes between them because, some time before the 94 WC, Vialli pranked Sacchi by putting grated parmesan in his napkin when having dinner, so that when Sacchi put it on his lap the cheese got all over him. It's only several years later that for some reason I thought about the incident again, so I googled it just to find out I was royally bamboozled.
Got the tickets for the Italy-France Davis Cup doubles in Genoa! Possibly the best occasion to introduce my gf to tennis.
Haha I try to stay true to the thread topic! I think the reason we should play him is not for his contribution going forward but rather to try and physically dominate in the middle since without Pjanic we've already lost if we try and outplay their midfield (at least in the first leg of course). Without Cuadrado and Berna our options on the wings are limited, I certainly wouldn't be opposed to a left flank consisting of Sandro up the field and Asamoah as LB but knowing Allegri I expect him to field a 2-man midfield (Khedira+Charo) with Mario acting as a false left winger in a 3-man line behind Higuain with Costa and Dybala. I know this formation got us nowhere but conservative approaches have often paid off for us vs. big opposition, I'd much rather see a 3-man mid with Marchisio filling in for Pjanic but we all know that's not gonna happen.
I had one for a couple years and I agree with you. Just perfection.
Fantastico, terrò sicuramente presente! Grazie molte.

"Bidone" is a bit different though, it's more like a player who was bought for a relatively high fee and came with great expectations just to turn out to be unqeustionably shit beyond any error of judgement (which is the case with overrated payers). I remember a poll like this one  was conducted in Serie A a few years ago and players overwhelmingly voted for Schelotto (at Inter at the time).
Several.
We can't bench Mandzukic, his physical presence is too important. Also, Bentancur does not bring enough to the table yet to play him in crucial matches (i.e. every match from now on) if not for the final 10 minutes when we're ahead.
Of course he will, he just pulled a sickie to skip the useless international friendly.
Remindme! 7 hours
IIRC Real paid a fee for Mourinho's buyout when he moved there from Inter. I don't think we're ever gonna see managers "fees" matching the players but I actually find it quite odd that this does not happen more often.
Thanks, will keep an eye out.
Unfortunately the days of crazy low fares seem gone for good. One would think 5 months qualifies as "well in advance" but I guess that only applies to the more touristy destinations.
So you looked in July/August for flights in the same period or did you do your research during those months for other periods? Sorry for being pedantic, I'm just looking for some hope!
One question - when you say they were going for dirt cheap, what period of the year are you referring to, and when did you look?
Flights tend to be cheap throughout the year but June-August they are ramped up like crazy, which I don't understand. I really want to come - I've wanted to for the past 2 years - and i'm just gonna pay up in the end, but people who are on the fence or are just looking for a place to vacation can go to so many places for like half the price. At these rates I can imagine they would have trouble filling the planes if not with Georgians living in Italy going back home for the holidays. I'm inclined to wait it out and see if there is a drop at some point but I'm just worried the prices will keep rising.
Thanks, I'm just flabbergasted that prices could moe than double in 2 months. Back in january there were round trip flights for 150€, I couldn't buy them back then and now they're going up and up and up.
Xiaomi Mi A1. Cheap and part of the Android One program, which means that it basically offers a stock OS experience with timely updates for the next couple years. 
Nel caso in cui non lo sapessi, Del Potro era già molto forte da ragazzo (a 20 anni vinse lo US Open battendo Federer che aveva vinto le precedenti 5 edizioni) e poi una serie infinita di infortuni lo hanno tenuto lontano dai campi per un totale di quasi 3 stagioni intere, impedendogli di realizzare il proprio potenziale. Questa vittoria arriva 2 anni dopo l'ennesimo ritorno, è stata una vittoria meritatissima anche dal punto di vista emotivo oltre che dal punto di vista tecnico.
I can't believe the character on this guy, 2 years ago he seemed like he would never be able to hit a backhand again. What makes his rise even more special is that he didn't just soar up the rankings thanks to a couple deep runs in big tournaments, he took his time and built his game and confidence back day after day, over the past two seasons. I can only imagine how bad he must have wanted it and how much mental strentgth it must have taken to not lose patience and determination.
Esatto, il discorso della coperta corta include anche questo aspetto. 
> preferiscono stare a casa dei genitori in attesa che un'offerta di lavoro cada dal cielo.

Questo era vero fino a qualche anno fa, adesso anche i più "ottimisti" dei miei amici si è rassegnato al fatto che per campare bisogna lavorare e quindi ecco laureati al DAMS che fanno i baristi, altri a cui mancano 3 esami per laurearsi in triennale in architettura che fanno i pizzaioli, laureati in lingue che fanno gli impiegati in piccole aziende, laureati in giurisprudenza che sono emigrati all'estero per lavorare nell'ufficio legale di una NGO che paga poco, laureati in economia che hanno tentato la strada del marketing senza per ora riuscire ad affermarsi e trovando solo impiego part-time, altri che non hanno finito l'università e fanno la stagione da gelatai in nord Europa guadagnando in 5 mesi quello che guadagnano altri rimasti qua in un anno facendo lavori più *"rispettabili"* (tutti esempi tratti dalla realtà). In quasi tutti i casi la coperta è corta, l'impegno di comprare casa (a chi interessa farlo) rimane molto oneroso anche con un indeterminato - a meno di avere un aiuto dalla famiglia, il che non vale per tutti i sopracitati - c'è chi pur di vivere in una zona della città gradita rinuncia alla macchina, altri restano a casa dei genitori nonostante i 34 anni suonati. Pensare di avere dei figli e avere una famiglia propria sembra diventato ormai un lusso, e ti garantisco che siamo tutti dei ragazzi normali che vogliono tranquillità, un po' di svago e un lavoro che non sia alienante. Sarà anche un po' colpa nostra che non abbiamo fatto gli ingegneri o gli informatici, ma che sia così difficile e per pochi "fare il passo successivo" dal tirare a campare all'essere in grado di poter fare dei progetti penso dica molto sul fatto che in generale le cose non vanno come dovrebbero. Possiamo addossarci la colpa fino ad un certo punto, ma se fino a 10 anni fa il messaggio era "follow your dreams", a 19 anni non tutti hanno lo spirito di guardare avanti in modo analitico o la fortuna di avere chi consiglia o addirittura insiste sulla strada da intraprendere, ovvio che uno segue le proprie inclinazioni. Facile anni dopo dire "avrei dovuto fare cosà invece che così".
> Ora si cerca la botte piena (aperitivo ogni sera, iPhone nuovo, vacanze in giro per il mondo da mettere su instagram) e la moglie ubriaca (lavoro dei sogni indeterminato, ottimo stipendio, casa di proprietà).

Non sono d'accordo, forse frequenti gente particolarmente abituata ad aspettarsi certe cose dalla vita ma la gran parte dei miei coetanei (30 o giù di li) semplicemente si aspetta di avere i soldi almeno per starsene per conto proprio, potersi permettere qualche sfizio e farsi una vacanza una volta all'anno senza troppi patemi. Della mia cerchia gli unici che hanno più di ciò sono quelli fortunati che hanno un'attività di famiglia ben avviata, noialtri ci accontentiamo e pure di brutto. C'è una bella differenza dal pretendere tutti i crismi e aspettarsi che la "promessa" di vita tranquilla e con un minimo di prospettive con cui siamo cresciuti non sia una chimera totale, ci sono un sacco di posti non lontani dove a quest'età si è già indipendenti e si sta molto meglio, non vedo perchè dovremmo sentirci in colpa per pensare che si possa stare meglio. 
I think the medical team compels Allegri to play Claudio as little as possible for the time being. I don't believe it's a technical decision, even a blind man could see that he's way more quality than Bentancur and current Khedira.
Saying there was skepticism among us Juve fans is a euphemism. After a few bad years and way too many questionable transfers, signing another veteran that had been seemingly finished for a couple seasons on a free looked like the low-effort move we just didn't want to see anymore. But then he started playing and holy shit he was so good, we were used to Felipe Melo and Poulsen in midfield and Pirlo was just amazing, it was clear he knew he had the chance to leave his mark once more and he gave it all.
Delpo deserves this, after all he's been through he's finally back where he belongs.
This feels like a shitty kind of great match.

First time in a while I see Roger definitely look like the second best player on court.
In 8.0 (or at least Xperia XC) changing the priority to low removes the icon from the status bar but the notification in the shade stays the same.
Damn they're just too smart for me dude.
He certainly hasn't been shining but I wouldn't call him terrible, plus his physical presence is always useful. I think he's due a good streak and no better time to produce one than now!
Yep, that's definitely the vibe I got when I visited. Totally reciprocated by the way! 
Since when Austrians hate us? It's for sure one of the countries where I felt our culture is most appreciated, heck even on the radio you can hear Italian music all the time. 
Maybe in the away leg if we are ahead and certainly not without Pjanic to be able to field someone who can actually kick a football. In that case Stu is gonna hold his own as he always does, he just freaking loves the CL for some reason.
I don't think he did. It was a second round, I'm sure the organisers would much rather have Roger play throughout the week than an albeit crowd favourite pull the upset straight away, and I can't see Roger get so complacent after being out for over 2 months.
No Pjanic at home means we'll try to outmuscle you in midfield, I think this means Mandzukic on the left flank to bring the beef and Costa opposite him for variety and depth. Playing Dybala and therefore an 4-2-3-1 with Matuidi and Khedira is risky but we definitely gotta score at home.
It's tough but we can always get the job done over two legs. We better lock that shit down at home though, we let them score 2 like we did with Spurs and we're done. 
We can't beat them in a single match but two legs are played with a different economy in mind. We have much better chances against anyone now than in the final, the longer the sample the better we perform.

Contrarissimo. Sono dell'idea che nel 2018 avere un capo dello stato che è lì per diritto di nascita e non per un processo democratico sia ridicolo, tornare alla monarchia dopo esser stati una repubblica poi è un insulto a mille battaglie durate secoli. Davvero ti sembra una buona idea essere retti da una famiglia i cui membri sono di diritto "meglio di te"? Il primo giro con il soggetto illuminato può anche andar bene, ma già dai suoi eredi in poi si rischia di brutto.
Get a room guys.
Sure, I wasn't comparing playing styles so much but their career arcs
The 2002 with the ice-like finish was amazing. Overall they were all very nice, blue on white with red trims is such a classic colour scheme.
Mai capiti quelli così - né i non-rassegnati né quelli che danno loro corda. Incapacità di andare avanti ai massimi livelli.
When was the last time he won 5 games in a row? He seems to pull out of tournaments most of the time, such an unlucky guy. Hope he can pull the upset against Raonic.
Chelsea! It would be a great homecoming for Conte, although it's gonna be very hard (yet not impossible) for them to pull the upset. I think we can beat anyone over two legs but not having to worry about Barça sure would be grand.
Even if this is not true right now, Schalke are definitely gonna go for him. He's playing well and he can use the extra game time to develop in a league and a club with less pressure. His injury woes with us were unfortunate but I still think he came too early in his career.
I think her career kind of went similar to Tsonga's - good enough to win big titles, a lot of flair on the court but could never take that extra step to consistently contend over time. Eventually age and more consistent players got to them and now they're not nearly as relevant as they used to be, which is sad but not totally unexpected. As for JWT, I think she also has some good tennis in her and altghough I don't expect her to be regularly back in the top 20 again she will post a few more good runs here and there.
It looks like an easy way to fix Nole's game but things and people change and what worked 2 years ago is not guaranteed to work again, especially if there were personal and professional reasons behind their split. Not saying they did not get along but if they chose to part ways it must have meant things were not working out for either or both. I think Nole should just focus on getting healthy again first, the rest comes after.
They have been for the past few decades but the sheer amount of coast makes it possible to have large beach hubs as well as hundreds of kms of unadulterated coast. I've visited many times and I can confidently say anywhere you are on the coast, you're never overhalf an hour away from a quiet, beautiful beach. It's never gonna be like certain parts of Spain or Italy with tourists for tens of kms swarming the waterfront.
In generale più umide e più a rischio di incappare in animali selvatici (niente di meglio di un cinghiale che ti carica la tenda), il che vuol dire anche che le guardie sono più inclini a farti sloggiare.
In montagna generalmente nessuno ti rompe i coglioni se non dai fastidio e sei discreto. Ci sono alcuni posti dove c'è sempre parecchia gente che si accampa (tipo Pian della Mussa o il Lago di Malciaussia), tieni però presente che fino a giugno per accamparsi a certe altitudini conviene essere ben equipaggiati. Sconsiglio zone boschive.
The truth is that during those years the Agnelli were absent and management were incompetent. I mean, Cobolli Gigli was a likeable guy but came from a completely different background, same for Blanc (who was not even likeable though), Secco was completely out of his depth in the DS role. Besides the bad signings it was obvious there was no direction and as soon as the core of players we had from the pre-Calciopoli days started to age, we got exposed big time. It's no coincidence that it only took a couple of seasons to right the ship after Andrea Agnelli became president and we brought in experienced football men like Marotta and Paratici - Conte just made it all click.
Alright, I'm willing to concede that the gun thing can be interpreted. But what about storming the pitch? That is completely unacceptable. Besides that, if the executives have decided to shut down the whole league, it says more about the state of Greek football in general than it does about Savvidis.
I mean if he did wave his gun at people we wouldn't even be talking about the suspension of the league and we'd be talking about the fact that he was not apprehended and jailed. Come on man, in the video I've seen it's pretty clear he makes sure the gun is damn well visible, invading the pitch alone would be serious enough to grant drastic measures against him and the club, let alone doing so with a gun in plain sight.
The owner of a club walked on the pitch with a gun to intimidate the ref! I mean let that sink in for a second. One could argue only PAOK deserve a ban but if the state of things in Greek football overall allow for this to happen then shutting the league down might be harsh but totally not out of left field.  
He usually skips it anyway, I don't think this changes anything regarding the question whether he's gonna play at RG or anywhere else on clay. 
According to my grandfather (born in the 20s), Hansen was the best striker ever. I'm sure some sort of bias at play but the guy lived through 7 decades of football and if Hansen impressed him so much it sure must have meant something.

Worked there a few years ago, 70-80 people will fit but 100 might be a bit of a stretch.
I was born, raised and still live in Turin and I find it hard to say that there is "pure hatred" going either way. Maybe the fact that the gap between the two has been quite big for over 20 years has taken the edge off, but currently the relationship between ours and Napoli supporters is much worse. 
Let's not forget that 3 of those were fresh World Cup winners too, another was a finalist, and another was Ballon d'Or just 3 years prior. It's a level of loyalty that I just can't see in today's football, even though it was a relatively short time ago.
Holy shit happy cake day to me! 8 years, damn...

Federer is a globally associated with excellence, style and charisma. Barilla places itself in the upper-end market segment for pasta, and choosing him and Davide Oldani (one of Italy's top chefs) is a clear and rather unquestionable choice. 
True but you are not as resentful towards us as they are. I feel like our rivalry is ironically more sound, Napoli and Fiorentina just hate our guts for the sake of it.

I know I wouldn't. He's way too much of a legend for us and we know how passionate he is. It would hurt like hell but we could never bring ourselves to hate the guy just for beating us and celebrating the victory (although I have a hunch he wouldn't go overboard).
My friends and I define him as "result-oriented".
He and Asamoah really changed the match, who would have thought. These guys, Chiellini and Sturaro really know when it's time to show up.
All these years pass and we still win thanks to him, Lichtsteiner and Asamoah. 
Haha well, we'll see ;)
I knew just the club but apparently he wasn't interested.
[In realtà è una citazione!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKJm3Hc16yg)

My point is that he put all of his chips on that referendum, meaning that people took it as a vote for or against him. Nobody liked that move, and as a consequence PD lost all credibility and the likes of M5S and Lega couldn't believe their luck - hell even Berlusconi smelled blood and attempted a comeback. So yes, I think he mistakenly underestimated his opponents and smugly challenged them just to make them stronger and leading to whatever we have in store in the upcoming months.
He will still be bagging a solid 25 a year even at that age. Conditioning for top athletes is incredible nowadays, bar injuries he won't have a considerable dip in form for another 3/4 years.

The crazy thing is that he was aiming exactly at what actually happened. Hold them off for 70 minutes and then wait around for the one chance to present itself. Maybe it did so a bit later than expected but it eventually did, it's almost like he has this down to a science. Props to Dybala for seizing it, this could be a huge goal.

The whole coalition is probably gonna swallow itself up. Many expect the next government to last a short time regardless, and some even predict new elections no later than sometime next year.
I forgot about Montero! I know a guy who used to work at Turin's famous "Dr. Sax" afterhours club - shady but iconic place in the arcades on the river - who said that Paolo was a semi-regular and apparently the guy did not hold back on the fun even on game weekends. 
Definitely, he was kind of a beta version of Pirlo. Uruguayan players at Juve do know how to party it seems (him, Olivera, Caceres...)
No, Lotito has a history of upselling (or trying to) his players and I'm not so adamant that SMS is worth that much. The one time we've massively splurged it's been for a long proven and established player and I think that is going to be the case should we ever do it again - Serie A is not the PL or Liga where these amounts are somewhat normal.
> Bakaye Traore

I love the old newsbit where an underage Niang was caught driving and he tried to convince the cops he was actually Traoré.

Not shit at all, actually he had a few crucial performances in the year of Capello's first Scudetto. I just think he had some issues with his professionalism being below par.

In my time nobody has ever been worse for us than Juan Esnaider. Every time he came on he looked like he had no freaking clue about what to make of a football. Close second was Athirson. Juve's transfers department around the turn of the century really had a few miscarragies (O'Neill, Oliseh, Pericard, Mirkovic and so on).


This looks somewhat like [baccalà alla vicentina](https://www.google.it/search?q=baccal%C3%A0+vicentina+wiki&client=firefox-b-ab&dcr=0&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZp6uyusvZAhUGIcAKHWykDSwQ_AUICigB&biw=1920&bih=966), a specialty from the Italian region of Veneto. If that is the case, it's hella tasty.
It could happen anywhere, and though...
Under a technical standpoint, no doubt. From an emotional/historic pov, probably not. Before last year's AO, after not winning a Slam for almost 5 years, after an injury that kept him out for 6 months and the question of his age, not many would have bet on him making the second week - let alone the final, let alone beat his nemesis.

I see Roger has been visiting /r/malefashionadvice in the past decade!
I agree with your point but after all a footballing career is only a fraction of a player's life. He's got already a great job that pays well in a great city/country, why uproot his life a few years before retiring? Maybe he already has plans for his after-football life and he thinks it's not worth it to go through the hassle or re-adapting to a new reality and potentially change the course of his life. We all make choices of this kind in our lives, certainly the money involved is not so crazy but we all need a degree of comfort.
Ah dammit, I thought you were talking about the actual country! In this case not only it borders itself, but it also seamlessly morphs into India!

After 2013 and last year I'm just gonna wait and see. Too many times we thought he was finished just for him to come back and boss it.
I don't think there are any real pushers anymore among the top pros nowadays. Even the players who could fit broadly in the category like Ferrer or Monfils do display a degree of aggression, the current game makes it impossible to just bunt the ball to the other side of the net as it was the case with some players until 20ish years ago. Fognini is a good example of a pure counterpuncher, as he mainly plays from a defensive position but takes the opportunity to close then point (even at the net) as soon as it comes up.
They may not be super model types but they look young and fit, that's not a bad start. And there's three of them!

I personally think you're being too harsh. Materazzi was a dirty player and in no way I condone his behavior in the WC final - can't even say I blame Zizou that much - but in my opinion it takes a bit more than that to be deemed "a fucking garbage human being". Just my 2¢ of course.
It was inevitable really, although I think this ranking is a bit unflattering even to his current ability. I was expecting the drop to happen last year but then he surprised me winning 4 titles, I'm pretty sure this is a momentary lapse and he still has a few good runs left in him.
I won't defend him one bit but then again if every insult on the ended up with a headbutt to the chest we wouldn't see much football played. Trash talking is a tactic as old as sin and Zizou just fell for it inexcusably, I'd really pick him over Materazzi any day yet I find it hard to feel sorry for him.
If he was so injured, how did he score one of the penalties in the shootout? 😏
All'epoca non so se lo fosse quanto in seguito, il programma glie lo crearono sull'onda della popolarità guadagnata grazie ai vari Mai dire... in cui faceva personaggi satirici ma non spiccatamente politicizzati. Come detto però avevo 12-13 anni e magari facevo meno caso a certe cose.

Mi ricordo Barracuda di Luttazzi qualche anno fa, ma ero troppo piccolo per farmi effettivamente un'idea della qualità. Di sicuro il pubblico italiano non era pronto - 20 anni fa non c'era l'abitudine a guardare TV straniera (serie a parte) - e mi pare fosse durato pochissime settimane.

Not implying anything, your comment simply reminded me of the skit!
No worries, this is not a touchy subject right now and federalism isn't really in the current political discussion. Stronger regional identities : yes definitely, many regions have basically no shared history between Roman times (even then it wasn't as homogeneous as one could think) and the Risorgimento, and many either had close ties to foreign powers for centuries or were nations in their own right for as long. These sentiments are now very diluted but it's still a very different landscape than the US, where national identity has somehow existed for longer than the regional one.

As for the government, we're definitely not a federal state. Although Regions have some degree ofautonomy on certain matters, it's nowhere near the federalism in the US. Moreover, it's possible (albeit not to be taken for granted) that going forward the dynamic within the European union will make this more similar to a federation to the detriment of proposal for internal federalisation.
Unfortunately I'm not so well versed in history to point out with certainty what were Mussolini's contributions and what was done later as active effort. From my experience of first hand accounts (grandparents and other family) I can say it was from the 50s, with TV and internal migration due the economic boom, that it became common to speak Italian even out of the city, before there was no need and probably limited knowledge. Then again, I suggest you visit /r/askhistorians or check out some specific literature for better insight.
Keep in mind that the XC is also a bit older which means support will be shorter lived than the XZ1C. Actually as a matter of fact, ever since the latter came out I've received updates on the XC noticeably later than before. It really boils down to what you're after, if you plan on changing phones every year or so then the XC works great and will carry you through 2018 without problems and then you could splash the cash for this next year's lineup, otherwise you could go with the XZ1C and be set for longer.
The fp scanner on the power button is perfection, but it was a matter of time they would move it. I'm gonna miss the "boxy" design but a makeover was due, and the new language doesn't stray too far just for the heck of it, I'm sure it will please those who didn't like recent Xperias while not driving away those who dig them.
I re-read your question and realised you may have been more concerned with the linguistic aspect. In that case, I'd say the turning point for Italian as the country's actual operative language was after WWII and the rise to prominence of mass media. Before that, dialects were definitely the norm and in many non-urban areas that was still the case until at least the 80s. Even before WWII however many were able to communicate in Italian, language was never in the way of getting things done even in the early days. 
Today I would say a politician speaking dialect or a heavily local variety of Italian would be seen as making a point of the diversity of those they're representing; Lega Nord (now just Lega) used to maintain a very Lombard/Venetian identity which was reflected in the demeanor and language of their politicians, but as years passed and they went mainstream their "northern" hue inevitably faded more and more. 
I don't want to get into tricky territory here, but I'd say Italy has always had a "granular" nature to it. Most of our national identity is based on ancient shared history up until to a point (Romans and all) and, from then on, cultural traits (many probably hate admitting it but religion and the Church have played a major role). I wouldn't go as far as calling each region a subnation, but there is certainly somewhat of a divide between what is considered national interest and local/regional interest, which in my opinion is why - despite glaring internal differences - various proposals to make the country more akin to a federation have never really gained traction. So yes, I'd say a leader has to appeal to *Italian* values rather than cater to each region's - the only exception being that the South is still lagging behind in many aspects and any political force is expected to bring about measures to promote its development.
Same in Bulgaria, everybody seems to drive as if caring for other people's lives and their own makes you a wuss. Also, so many dead animals roadside (in Romania as well to be fair).
> dialects are not as a mutually intelligible

It really depends - I'm from Piedmont and (although I only have passive competence) I can understand a great deal when someone speaks most lombard, emilian, and ligurian dialects. It gets harder with Veneto, Friuli and Romagna ones, the rest I mostly don't understand, at least in spoken form. For a politician - or anyone really - to speak other dialects than their own would be asking way too much without really giving an edge considering the vast majority of people just resort to Italian for nearly everything.
Flair checks out.
Good matchups. The EL is an underrated tournament.
> Because it's full of people from northern Italy, where there are many racist people

While I obviously acknowledge the problem with northern Italy I know for a fact we're not all racist.


Didn't that turn out to be staged though?

Edit: alright sorry I was just asking
I'm sorry that Tennys has become one of the most disliked players on tour, his personal views are backwards but he seems like a decent guy. 
> Murray, Novak, And Stan aren’t back or in good form

It's pretty much guaranteed this will be the case. Murray won't be there 99%, Stan is struggling a lot with his recovery and Novak is currently out again. That said let's not forget Roger has played 2 tournaments on clay in the past 3 years - I don't think it's worth it for him to risk it, he's too beatable there to bother with the preparation and conditioning at this stage.
It definitely looks like serving really was just putting the ball in play.
Aaaand it's over.

Infatti il lato positivo di queste esperienze è che ti apre gli occhi riguardo a queste piccolezze, che però una sull'altra fanno poi una differenza. Detto ciò non penso affatto che i Polacchi siano gente cattiva o più razzista di altri, semplicemente la notizia del link non mi stupisce più di tanto in virtù delle mie esperienze personali e delle ultime debacle diplomatiche.
Infatti sono sicuro che mi sia andata semplicemente male, è anche vero che in generale ho trovato un'accoglienza meno "calorosa" che in qualsiasi altro paese in cui sia stato. Poi chiaro che questo tipo di esperienze sono 100% soggettive.
Ho trovato un atteggiamento non apertamente ostile, ma qualche commento fuori luogo l'ho sentito. Quando andai (qualche anno fa per circa 3 settimane), una mia amica disse che non considererebbe mai di sposare un Italiano perché secondo lei sono "poco seri", e i suoi amici mi dissero che non sembravo Italiano e che dovevo considerare la cosa come un complimento. Si trattava di dottorandi in matematica, non di buzzurri di qualsiasi. Quando ci furono scontri tra la polizia e tifosi della Lazio in trasferta a Varsavia (sorvolando sull'episodio già nebuloso di suo), la mia stessa amica commentò "certo che comunque quando succede qualcosa del genere sono sempre gli Italiani".

In generale ho percepito antipatia nei confronti un po' di tutti, aperta ostilità verso Russi e Africani, e invece sudditanza totale nei confronti dei Tedeschi.
La mia esperienza con la Polonia e i Polacchi è che si tratti di un popolo molto nazionalista e con davvero poca, pochissima simpatia per l'Italia. Quali sarebbero questi episodi di antisemitismo? Facevano più bella figura a cambiare il nome senza sta mezza spiegazione invece di voler passare come i paladini della correttezza verso le vittime dell'Olocausto.
Fair point about Soderling, but then again since you've mentioned Berdych - shouldn't the latter be above him? Soderling has 1 more slam final over the Czech, but over 6 years in the top 10 has to "weigh" more than 2 Slam finals in consecutive years and pretty much only 2 and a half seasons in the top 15. Berdych has had more consistent results over a longer period while still clashing with peak Big4. Not saying Soderling wasn't great, but I just believe he was good for too short a span to truly be in the discussion.

As for Gaudio, he surely has his place in the history of tennis thanks to his RG win - but he was in the top20 for just over two years...I know a Slam win increases the relevance of a player tenfold, but then again Panatta (Italy bias alert) won a RG and is the only man to beat Borg there - he did it twice - while having a similar rankings history yet is nowhere near your list. This example works for other players too (Edmondson, Gerulaitis etc).

I'm just pointing out why I think it's not so close to being objective as it appears to have recency bias, aside from that I think this is a good effort.
Bevi il delizioso nettare e metti in cambusa qualche frase ad effetto estrapolata dai commenti per rivendertela come tua nelle discussioni, tanto nessuno scoprirà mai che l'hai pescata da qua!
I think Gaudio and Soderling really have no business being on this list, despite qualifying according to your requirements. I also think this system gives an unfair advantage to those who have played in recent years as the tour structure is now clearer and more consistent than it used to be, the absence of Laver, Newcombe, Rosewall and so on should have rung a bell.
Betting seems to attract questionable characters and then bring the absolute worst out of them. I know pros grow a thick skin but some of this bullshit will eventually get to your head.

It's common in non-major tournaments in countries that don't have a strong tennis tradition to have low attendance over the first few days, most matches feel like a warmup to the weekend ones. People will turn up eventually.
Io ero molto legato a mio nonno (morto 20 anni fa quando ne avevo 11), circa 5-6 anni fa feci un sogno iperrealistico in cui guardavamo il Tour de France a casa sua di pomeriggio come avevamo fatto decine di volte. Mi svegliai con la stessa sensazione di essere perso che avevo avuto alla sua morte. Altre volte ho sognato i nonni (anche se non saprei quando sia stata l'ultima volta) ma non l'ho mai accusata così.

Scusami, il tuo commento mi ha fatto tornare alla mente l'episodio e dovevo esternarlo :)

He's been picking up his form a lot over the past months and he's currently top 20, although he has a ton of points to defend in Miami. You never know with him during clay season, he's certainly among the best on his day and any tournament could be his tournament.

> That first goal was a beauty (even if marginally offside) fine technique

See, this is what I like about fans outside of Italy, you can acknowledge it was a great goal and accept that the linesman/ref made a mistake and get over it.. Round here evrybody would have lost their minds over the error, and 90% of football discussion revolves around that - even now that we have VAR and *nearly* all of the controversial episodes are cleared.

Anyway, you make good points and in general the Spurs fanbase seems to be level-headed and competent. Good luck with your match against Rochdale!
Honestly that's why they brought Neymar in - I'm sure the board were looking for an upgrade not only in the skill department but chose him for his supposed charisma and winning mentality. I definitely agree it takes a lot more than buying a huge star to make that step, but I also think that if he's not able to instill that belief into his teammates, then he's coming short of what is expected from him.
Also here in Piedmont (the green dotted bit in northwestern Italy) we say "portugal" (pron. "poortugal") for the fruit and "arancion" (pron. "aranchoon") for the colour. 

We use the same word for the fruit and the country. We also have "groson" (pron. "groozoon") for the colour, but it's not so common and I have no idea what it could come from.
Europe is too big and too diverse, it's great to have a common economic space and some common legislature but I think that should be it. 

Imagine living in a flat complex where the rules for the common areas work well and everyone gets along, and suddenly say "since we get on so well, let's delegate to the complex administrator the power to make the rules regarding private spaces too". All of a sudden you have to deal with tenants each with their own needs and idiosyncrasies, in different numbers and with different issues. I'm sure you can see what could go wrong. 

The examples you brought up do not compare IMO because their shared cultural identity has more common ground, inside the EU there are many countries that had 0 common history before joining the union. All in all, I'm inclined to think that perfecting the current structure is the best solution.

I would say the 90s-early 2000s era were the prime years of the BdO. Before then it was just too hard to watch football outside of your own country for European fans to identify with certain contenders, and since the rise of the Cristiano/Messi duopoly I feel the prize has lost a bit of meaning.
Well, I've learned my lesson. I still think we are the better team and that we can turn it around, but it will have to be a different Juve.
Well it is an America-centric website overall. I for one would like to see more diversity, but a subreddit's contents are only as good as the posts its users submit.
Non mi stupisce, qui a Torino ne ho viste di più nella Dora e nel Po che in giro con gente sopra.
Spurs played fantastic and I was wrong thinking they do not have what it takes to hurt us. Kane and most of all Dembélé deserve all the hype they generate. 

I believe Charo's absence was the most important of the three, the two-man midfield left a gaping hole in front of our defense almost the whole match. Really makes me wonder about Marchisio's conditions, there is no way Allegri is blind to Khedira's awful form this season.

About our fullbacks, I am afraid Sandro could be one of those players who have a great 2-3 seasons that they fail to replicate consistently. He's certainly suffering from having a player like Costa directly in front of him on the pitch, and having limited freedom going forward as a result. MDS is allright but not good enough for CL level. Alves was a bit of a douche, but the difference in stature is appalling.

Winning those 3 tournaments and doing nothing else would have him currently in the top 10 - with high chances of making the WTFs as a Slam winner, where he could pick up even more points.

I think the only thing that got to anyone's head was the other guy's punch to his own head.
I'd say his one of the best, if not the best, of his generation *in Italy*. His abilities pale in comparison with players like Nesta and Baresi, and he's in my opinion not in the same class as Maldini and Cannavaro either (granted the former played LB for large chunks of his career and the latter did have a few bad seasons).

What a dumb insult...Benzema has been a crucial player for RM in their countless titles and one of the best rounded forwards of the past decade! That said, I'd pick Gonzo over him any day.
Definitely not the best pubs in town but the Hunstman and the Six Nations on Corso Vittorio Emanuele are a shot away from each other and the main train station (Porta Nuova). Especially the former attracts a lot of expats and I'm fairly sure there will be a representation of Spurs fans too, so it should be quite atmospheric. Just make you sure you arrive early (it's always packed for CL matches) and remember that the only thing worse than their beer is their food; Six Nations has good beer and good food, although it's as packed if not more. 
Haha ok, didn't make much sense now that you pointed it out!

Anyone else feel that although Spurs are a great team they don't have the right weapons to hurt us? I have this feeling they're gonna walk straight onto our lap - I hope the players and Allegri don't feel the same way.

I don't have that long of a commute (about 70 minutes, which is highish by European standards) but after a few years I'm really starting to reconsider this. After a day of work, having little to no control over how you're gonna get home or anywhere else can be very frustrating, sometimes missing a certain bus might mean an extra 30 mins of unwanted transit in crowded places and vehicles. Yes, private transport is expensive and doesn't necessarily shorten the trip, but at least being in control of the situation is sometimes worth the extra money and hassle - or at least that's how I've been starting to feel.
I'd say they're used for different things, for example I fry my eggs in butter while my southern friends fry it in olive oil, but I use olive oil as a general condiment. Some traditional recipes reflect the divide more clearly, however I would say olive oil is much more present in northern cuisine than butter is in southern cusine.

Who knows who is going to break onto the scene in the next few years that will suddenly make the projected top 10s very crowded.

Guarda, tutto sommato mi è andata bene...ho visto solo 3/4 appartamenti, questo l'ho trovato quasi senza cercare e nella zona della città in cui volevo vivere da sempre. Tutto sommato ho ancora tribolato poco rispetto ad altri, ahimé nelle città trovare casa è spesso molto stressante - lasciando il mio coinquilinaggio precedente non ti dico quanti/e ragazzi/e mi hanno contattato disperati e frustrati da mesi di ricerche vane. 

Anche vero però che come in tutto basta fare un po' di attenzione, comportarsi in modo serio, e avere una piccola dose di fortuna. Ti direi quindi di non scoraggiarti preventivamente!
Lascia stare! Comunque ciò che mi ha dato veramente fastidio non è stato tanto l'aver lasciato la casa in condizioni del genere (in fondo lo sporco si pulisce), ma il fatto di aver provato tutti a fare finta di niente obbligandomi a passare per spaccacoglioni per ottenere delle cose se non dovute, comunque legittime e concordate ampiamente in anticipo. 
> la enclave di Dubrovnik

Per pignoleria Dubrovnik non è un'enclave, ma è la regione intera (Dubrovnik-Neretva) ad essere un'**exclave** in quanto rimane separata dal resto della Croazia contigua. 


Ah sull'imbiancare apriamo un'altra parentesi... La prima volta che vidi la casa mi era stato detto che sarebbe stata libera da novembre, ma che già ad ottobre sarebbe stata sfitta e che ne avrebbero approfittato per imbiancare (i muri erano di un orrendo celeste carichissimo e necessitavano cmq di una rinfrescata) e fare altri lavoretti.

Nel frattempo io ero in contatto con le inquiline, a cui avevo proposto di fare solamente la voltura della ADSL per evitare a entrambi seccature di chiusura e riapertura contratti. A inizio ottobre mi faccio quindi vivo per raccogliere tutti i dati, al che una delle due ragazze mi dicono che alla fine hanno cambiato idea e rimangono anche ad ottobre, come avevano fatto sapere ai proprietari circa una settimana prima. Ovviamente il fatto di venirlo a sapere da lei in modo fortuito mi fa girare le balle, e allora contatto i proprietari per sapere quando intendono imbiancare e fare i lavori. Loro mi rispondono che le ragazze "avevano bisogno" e che "non sapevano come dirmelo", e che quindi avrebbero potuto consegnare la casa attorno al 7 novembre anziché il primo. Peccato che ovviamente io mi fossi già attivato e avessi ovviamente già trovato un mio rimpiazzo nella mia casa precedente (un coinquilinaggio), il che avrebbe significato farmi una settimana senza una casa. Insomma giramento palle totale, al che io mi impunto - ovviamente anche il fatto che fossero previsti questi lavori era stato uno dei fattori che mi avevano indotto a prendere l'appartamento - e riesco almeno ad ottenere che i muri vengano pitturati prima di novembre e che io possa insediarmi l'1/11. Insomma ho dovuto fare il rompicoglioni, che non è mai bello, per poi arrivare e trovare il disgusto menzionato sopra. Purtroppo a volte bisogna farlo, altrimenti si rischia di farsi mettere i piedi in testa.

I went 10+times to the old Delle Alpi and had a season pass in the Scirea 2006-08 (it was dirt cheap those two seasons), but I've never been to the Stadium. Especially the first few years tickets would sell out in no time, it was frustrating so I kinda stopped looking. All I can say is that the Delle Alpi sucked really bad - it was cold, ugly, way too big and the track made for a disappointing experience overall. I liked the Comunale a lot but definitely did not seem fit for a top European club.
I miei attuali padroni di casa - a "stretta di mano" già avvenuta - avevano paventato di ritornare sui loro passi e affittare l'appartamento ad una ragazza in quanto secondo loro "tiene un po' meglio la casa".

I surprise myself when I realise how much I'd love to see that. I never really enjoyed watching him win, but damn I miss the untouchable, rage-fueled, shirt-ripping machine Nole was. He was just too good a villain.
I think it's not so outlandish - he's gonna go into Wimbledon as one of the favourites and has realtively few points to defend in the first part of the season (crashed out early both in IW and Miami last year). If Nadal and Federer fail to replicate their 2017 - which by all means was incredible for both - then he's got a chance, can't honestly see Djokovic hitting his stride for a few more tournaments after watching him in Melbourne.

In fondo se qualcuno crea palese disagio agli altri è giusto che il padrone di casa se ne interessi. Non c'è bisogno di arrivare alla "espulsione forzata", visto lo stile di vita del soggetto dubito sia il tipo da andare per avvocati a causa di una querelle coi coinquilini, ma in ogni caso l'unico che può farci qualcosa é il padrone di casa.
Avete provato a parlare con il padrone di casa? Se effettivamente avete già provato a parlare con il coinqulino senza risultati, potrebbe l'unica via percorribile. Purtroppo ho imparato anch'io a mie spese che "mischiare" in una casa gente che studia e gente che lavora, specialmente chi lavora in ristoranti/locali che chiudono tardi, si va incontro a problemi di comunicazione - anche se mi sembra che in questo caso la questione mi sembra più seria.
In questo caso al contratto precedente è subentrata un'altra persona (un'ex coinquilina rimasta nella casa). Mi troverò quindi il canone anche nella bolletta attuale? La dichiarazione di non possesso sembra fatta in riferimento soltanto ad eventuali utenze residenziali.
[AskItaly] Ho cambiato casa da poco e la pratica per il cambio di residenza non è ancora stata completata. Nella casa precedente avevo un contratto per la luce da residente, tramite il quale pagavo il canone Rai (contratto ora volturato ad altra persona): ora ho invece un contratto non da residente, nell'attesa che venga formalizzato il cambio di cui sopra. La domanda è: 

mi verrà addebitato il canone Rai su questa bolletta? Se così fosse, posso fare la dichiarazione all'Agenzia delle Entrate di non possesso visto che non sono al momento intestatario di un contratto residenziale?

Grazie di indirizzarmi da altre parti se più appropriato, buon lunedì a tutti.
This is what happens when you let the Swiss handle security.
I do, but she won't be around forever. My point is that Halep has what it takes to establish herself as the next player by the time Serena calls it quits.
I had that kind of experience in Hungary. I'm mother tongue Italian and I speak a bit of Croatian, both languages are close enough to Romanian and Bulgarian to somehow get by even in rural areas, but every basic communication in rural Hungary was very difficult, noone speaks English and Hungarian is completely foreign to anything else. Luckily Europe is small and crammed so it's never too long before you find yourself a short hitchhike/walk away from any place from where to get back on route.
I agree, if Simona wins I can see her unchain, win more majors and establish herself as the true post-Serena force. I get the feeling that Caro would not have this in her.
Honestly this looks like an alright lunch, one doesn't always have time to fix a gourmet meal. I see much much worse on /r/food everyday.
I'm on an XC but I'm not gonna hold my breath for Oreo at least ofr another month. I haven't even received yet the January patch (I'm in Italy), it's the first time it would come in this late.
I was just thinking he would have usually won this point 5 times already by the end of it.
> “I’ll meet President [Andrea] Agnelli soon and we’ll talk about it,”

Considering Andrea was the one who persuaded Nedved to hang up the boots and showed Del Piero the door I'd expect him to treat Gigi no differently.
I'm not sure Kyrgios has a higher ceiling. He's great and exciting but his style is very high-risk/high-reward, which means that when he's on he looks phenomenal and when he doesn't we blame his inconsitency. Ever since I first watched Chung (vs. Granollers a couple years ago) I could tell his consistency and focus would bring him further than his already considerable talent, and he appears to have significantly improved his mobility and footwork. 

For the moment it's obvious Kyrgios has the edge but all in all I'd say Chung has the most room for improvement, depsite already having a Slam SF under his belt. Shapo and Rublev I see having potential issues similar to Kyrgios' in regards to their development.
I admit I don't really follow the WTA that much but I also have to say this final has me quite hyped up. It's the most deserving players, the outcome is totally unpredicatble, and it's almost guaranteed to be at least a great grind of a match and a great story no matter who comes out the victor.
Whoa I know Australia is ahead of the UK but I didn't thnk it was a full 6 months ahead!
I get the impression Fed has sort of a man crush on Jim. He wants to look and sound chill and cool in front of him, that's why the pair make for a great show.
This is being a dad dicking if I ever saw one. Roger being completely ruthlessly and Chung predictably falling apart physically but at least he's learning lessons all around.
That's one whole Federer.
E poi vi ci ha spostato il governo! 
Conditioning makes a hell of a lot of a difference in the later stages of Slams. You can expect the top dogs to have a team that have perfected recovery to an art form, while the lower ranked guys must probably resort to more basic ways. There can only be so much gas left in the tank after a while.
> Todd Martin

Ironically the guy who messed up Novak's serve a few years ago...
> (2019)
Yeah I don't buy it that he doesn't care, I mean the guy was made for competing and accomplishing. I think he's weighed his options and found that he still has a chance if he plays it wisely, that is if he closes the gap with Rafa enough to be able to get a surprise entry to RG or maybe a clay Masters in order to strictly get the points he needs. He knew if he tried doing that last year he would fall short later on in the season.
Thiem is not really expected to go all the way at this tournament though.
Ok I admit I may have taken the hyperbole too far :D you make compelling points.
Tour de France and other bicycle stage races make a deep run at the AO look like a walk in the park on a breezy spring afternoon. Not to mention long distance running, Iron Man and the like which often take place in rather harsh conditions, without breaks.
Well they're looking in the right country at least.
This is not as much of a request as I was just curious, I don't remember switching off background data for Chrome specifically. I don't even use Chrome.
I could listen to Jim and Roger chat all day.
I think he's a good fit for Schalke, closer to what his level is at the moment. I wouldn't be surprised if he also prefers to have consistently more playing time over the next few seasons, I think we could all see that he's still a rough gem and right now it would be very hard for him to climb up the pecking order and get the minutes he needs to develop. If the loan spell is successful, I can see Schalke having a go and Marko support the move.

This has "Schalke is negotiating a permanent transfer for the summer" written all over.
Is this a joke?
It's somewhat comforting to watch two veterans like Berdych and Delpo play.
Man Sascha still has a lot of growing up to do.
I agree with the sentiment, this sub is the closest one can get to eavesdropping into people's minds.
Ever so slightly, about 34 cm over the road. I used to live in the block right opposite, the whole district (Vanchiglia) is built on very soft soil between the Po and the Dora Riparia rivers, don't quote me on this but I wouldn't be surprised if that was the cause of its lean.
In football you can get fined by the federation/association if you swear at the referee. If you swear at an opponent/teammate you will be fined only if it causes some sort of incident, it can also happen that clubs fine their own players for minor occurrences.
Cilic has been sailing smooth so far, if he beats PCB I can see him suddenly catch fire to at least put up a serious fight against Rafa. 
What this article describes is pretty much the opposite of hypocrisy. Now what, are the tournament directors gonna schedule him for a day match just to prove a point? 
I feel like this is becoming more and more common on centre courts. I will never understand what these morons think they'll get out of disrupting the players.
They just need basic expressions to call the scores, same in Davis Cup matches wherever they are played.
Yesss Andreas! Another great run in Melbourne, beating Edmund is not a pipe dream.
Did Nick just ask the ump to introduce himself 😂
[Interesting to note that Seppi actually wins more points than Ivo on both his first and second serve.](https://i.imgur.com/CJ2vl8P.png) I agree with those saying it's been just an issue of focus during these past 2 tiebreaks. I hope Andreas can pull through, he's quite the marathon man and losing a 3rd Italian after being 2-0 up would be very disappointing.
Never will in my opinion.
Dybala is not half the player Tevez was for us.
Ho riso.
Faccio l'impiegato commerciale estero per una piccola ditta produttrice. Sono entrato praticamente solo perchè parlo Inglese e Francese bene, ma il mercato Europa lo gestisce una commerciale esterna e sul resto del mondo manca un direttore commerciale che dia intento. Ci sono giorni che non ho niente da fare (tipo oggi), in passato ho cercato di ritagliarmi più spazi e indipendenza ma è una ditta dove vige la regola che non si muove una foglia se non lo dice il padrone e così navigo a vista. L'azienda va benissimo e parrebbe non esserci interesse ad aumentare l'export, quindi io resto qua a vegetare senza acquisire competenze e rompendomi le palle in modo imbarazzante. Visto che sono oltretutto a più di un'ora da casa, dopo un anno (sono qua da fine 2014) ho chiesto di passare da 40 a 30 ore perchè stavo impazzendo, così ho almeno orari decenti e la sera posso arrotondare tenendo lezioni di Inglese (ovviamente pagate molto meglio).

I think his point is that players are part of the business as much as every other aspect. Tennis hasn't become huge at the expense of the players but it has *along with* the players, and the top ones have benefited greatly of their ever more increased star power. I think he was just reflecting on the fact that a line has to be drawn somewhere in regards to the players' health and that today (as well as many other times at the AO) it was crossed.

Sorry for sounding like the fanboy that I'm not but holy crap can Roger dig himself out of curveball questions...instead of giving awkward politically correct half answers he just stays cool and replies honestly. Gotta respect him for how he handles these interviews in front of a crowd and right after playing a few hours of tennis.
I don't really get why Stan bothered to come to the AO just to pick up  a negligible amount of points and prize money (by his standards of course) and potentially jeopardise his recovery. 
Sneak preview from Will Ferrell's upcoming oncourt bit.
La vedrei anch'io così ma sono anni che vengo qua e spengo corpo e cervello...so di essere fortunato ma alla lunga sentirsi così non può fare che danni.
31 anni sono troppi per ripartire da 0 lavorativamente parlando? Il mio attuale lavoro è sicuro, crea pochissimo stress e paga le bollette (e poco più) ma è veramente un vicolo cieco completo, e noiosissimo. Non so se magari accontentarmi di un lavoro più rischioso dal punto di vista contrattuale, ma magari conn qualche possibilità di sviluppo e soprattutto che non contempli il passare la giornata di fronte ad un pc come uno zombie.
Stan's as good as gone, it's the final nail on the coffin of my bracket for that section. I had Stan losing to RBA in the 3rd round, with RBA beating freaking Vesely in the 4th (and eventually lose to Djokovic in the quarters)...RBA's demise was surprising but Stan's poor form was not hard to anticipate.
Ti consiglio Zagabria, molto bella, interessante e "attrezzata" per venire incontro a tutte le esigenze del turista medio. Volendo anche Lubiana è molto carina, pur essendo molto piccola. 
Ma che diamine reddit mi ha cambiato la pagina del profilo così all'improvviso? Sapevo che sarebbe avvenuto ma mi aspettavo almeno un'opt-out. Ci vorrà un po' ad abituarsi adesso, preferivo decisamente la vecchia versione.
Sonego was clearly gassed after the qualies and his 1st round match so no surprise there, I think this goes to show how much of a difference elite teams and equipment can make in recovering between matches (apart of course from experience in certain conditions). He had a great run though, he's from my same city (Turin, Italy) so it was awesome to see him in the main draw of a Slam beating a veteran like Haase.
I wasn't expecting Goffin to put in a serious challenge in this tournament after a busy end to 2017 but still he should have beaten Benneteau comfortably. It pains me to say it, but I think Julien is the favourite now against Fognini, he has the composure to prevail.
Well he's having a career that the vast majority of his colleagues can only dream about so I'd wager he's cool with it.
Seriously... When it came out I was 16 and my only worry was finding ways to have even more fun than I already was. Feels like a million years ago.
I have an X Compact and even though updates have been getting slower since the XZ lineup came out, they're always released within the month the patches are released. Many expected 2016 phones to receive Oreo with the January update cycle but I think it will take a month or two longer at this point.
In via S. Dalmazzo, proprio di fronte a Games Workshop, c'è un negozio che vende maialate USA d'importazione che secondo me potrebbero averli. I prezzi saranno da manicomio però potrebbero averli, in effetti anche a me piacevano ma di punto in bianco sparirono.
I think it's a lost cause, there are very few subs where this tidbit of reddiquette is actually honored.
Playing devil's advocate here but that's not proper use of the downvote button. Downvotes exist to eliminate posts which are not relevant not to express disagreement with whatever the commenter wrote.
No disrespect to the Dimitrov-McDonald match but I think AO Radio should switch to Kyrgios-Troicki, it sounds much more interesting. I don't get why AOR just sticks with whatever's on RLA no matter what's going on on other courts.
* On-court interview with Gavrilova packed with sexual innuendos
This match is really not primetime Rod Laver Arena material.
What a total cringefest. I hope they don't have more in store for the next rounds.
Forza Juve!
I'm always cautious with players who experience a sudden spike in results towards the end of one season going into the next...wouldn't be surprised to see Goffin come short of expectations too, although the Belgian has a way more proven record of consistency.
Oltre a Seppi che ha avuto la meglio sul giovane francese Moutet, entrambi gli altri italiani in campo oggi agli Australian Open [tennis] sono stati eliminati dopo essere stati in vantaggio per 2 set a 0. Pazienza per Lorenzi - che aveva nel bosniaco Dzumhur un avversario solido e in ascesa - ma peccato per Salvatore Caruso che contro il tunisino Jaziri probabilmente ha peccato di inesperienza. Domani Fognini affronta l'ostico argentino Zeballos, Berrettini e Sonego ci provano contro due avversari esperti come - rispettivamente - il francese Mannarino e l'olandese Haase, e Thomas Fabbiano sfida sul Centrale la testa di serie tedesca n.4 Alexander Zverev.
Dasha is like the anti-Kia Guy.
Caruso up 2-0 over Jaziri. Hope he doesn't pull a Lorenzi.

Edit: he pulled a Lorenzi
Well done, he certainly has what it takes to complete the comeback.
Pouille off to another disappointing Slam. Definitely looks like his development has stifled, was 100% sure by now he would consistently make 4R/QFs whereas he keeps squandering his generous seeding.
"Dasha" is the Russian term of endearment/short for Daria, so it's far from an anglicisation of her name. It's somewhat like Alexandra/Sascha, Mikhail/Mischa, Joanna/Asia (pron. Asha) and other common occurrences in many slavic languages.
Looking alright so far, although I knew picking Anderson and Sock to win their matches would not be without its risk. Looks like I trusted their experience a bit too much.
Shouldn't it be "breadstuck"?
Still the only man to beat Wawrinka in Stanimal mode.
Caxton Arms?
If that stick guy gave the boys a pep talk at half time during last year's CL final we'd be sitting on 3 more trophies.
Such a lovely place?
Highly doubt it. He may very well go back to winning ways but we've seen his peak and probably also his prime is behind him. At his very best he possessed a level of fitness, focus, intensity and technical ability that can perfectly align only for so long over a career, and he's achieved it for a total of almost three seasons over two different occasions (most of 2011 and 2015-16). I mean, for long stretches he was absolutely impossible to get past no matter what.

Edit: props to Nole for running the ball down, but that point at 2:28 has gott to be one of the most bullshit net plays I've ever seen from Ferru.
Io mi sono appena trasferito da una casa con camera su via Vanchiglia. Pazienza la movida, ma il 15 che mi sferragliava sotto il balcone (proprio sopra una fermata per di più) erano il mio peggior incubo - pure peggio dell'inquinamento.

I think /r/movies may be better suited for this kind of question. It surely is remarkable how much value American society puts on skin tone though.
Just Robin things.
I'm not sure there's any program in place but it's a commonly known issue and Piedmont tends to be diligent with its wildlife policies so I'm sure the authorities are aware at the very least.
I think it's because he's a very hard player to anticipate for, given his performance level tends to be quite unpredictable. Watching the other big players can be a good indicator of their form and chances for the next big event, whereas he could be coming off a hot streak just to crash out in the first round as much as going deep dominating other top players in the process. Not much use to analysing his chances beforehand I guess.
Interesting to see Tomislav used to be so popular, I've always perceived it as a quintessentially croatian name. Are there many Tomislavs nowadays (apart from Nikolić of course)?
Totally unreasonable grunting+relentless moonballing - you can just tell Serena was loving to wreck her.
In the Turin area the red ones have practically died out as the map shows. Even in the yellow area around the city they're getting harder and harder to spot.

600 - I missed Hausa twice and Xhosa once. I have 0 familiarity with those languages.
I had completely forgotten about Stan's Tequila Sunrise outfit. I actually think it was really cool and he definitely pulled it off.
All of a sudden I can't wait for my trip to Georgia next summer! I actually got the idea of visiting a couple years back when I read about Chiatura and its unique cableway system, how it was realised thanks to Stalin's bond with the city after having spent a while hiding in the city's mines during the revolution. I'm in no way a fan of Stalin's but I do find the stories behind his early days fascinating.
I don't even think this has anything to do with sexual preference. I don't know anything about Ginuwine and his views on LGBT matters, but from this incident it just looks to me like he didn't feel comfortable kissing a stranger.
I think it's amazing that this subs has been around long enough that we can start having proper "historical" moments in this form. It's a genuine record of how fans felt live.
Can't help but wonder why this wasn't discussed earlier. A whole year away from the game is going to make his comeback really hard. In any case all the best to him, this whole affair with his injury is awful and knowing it's gonna take so long before seeing him at his best makes it even worse.
If that's confirmed it's good business for us. He worked hard but did not really cut it, Torino is definitely his dimension. Earning a profit on him despite a hefty price tag was not obvious.
I think that Suarez has just been playing in an era when Messi would overshadow any teammate. He wasn't as dominant during Eto'o's tenure and Ronaldinho's peak was quite short, which allowed Eto'o to shine of his own a bit more.
Thanks, I've never rented an RV before so thanks for your input.
Sure, I'm just saying this to me looks more like a "randomly getting shit faced at 3pm" than coming home from a night out kind of thing. Just the vibe I'm getting.
Yeah not buying the "night out" hypothesis. I'm willing to bet this was a full daytime affair.

I wonder if this is a direct consequence of the insane bender he went on at the end of 2016 to get to #1. I used to think it was worth it for achieving such a landmark, but now I'm starting to think he may have traded in the rest of his career for it. Hopefully this is not the case.
That's very interesting, thanks!

Quite funny of you to point that out considering the amount of Veneti living in the city whose ancestors came here for pretty much the same reasons as most Calabrians did.

2 years ago I bet with a friend that Kokkinakis' career high rank would be higher than Kyrgios', I've long given up on the idea of winning the bet but I still maintain that his game is more technically and tactically sound than Nick's. It's a long way to full recovery though and I get the ominous feeling he will always be skipping big chunks of the season due to injury.
I see what you mean but - fundamentally being a tourist - I found the area to be very tourist-oriented as a whole, and I don't mean it in a derogatory way. It's just that it's hard to get a feel of what life is actually like in most mid-sized towns where there is anything to see. I also visited Kutna Hora, Kost, and Loket and they all fit the description - the only exception was Plzeň which however is larger and not as interesting as the other places. Talking with a few locals and other tourists, many agreed that Moravian cities are less tourist-oriented, and even though I did get the impression this may have just been a stereotype I left the country thinking maybe it would have been worth visiting. 
I'm sure there are, after ČK I went to Karlovy Vary just to feel pretty much the same way - beautiful but too curated. I spent a couple days in the Jičín area and found the town to be more enjoyable as it definitely felt more "provincial". I regret not visiting Moravia, from what I've gathered it has a more genuine feel than Bohemia, which is apparently one tourist town after the other.
Was there this summer and our guide mentioned this, as IIRC there are a few buildings which have not been renovated. Not to take away from the beauty of the place, but the way the town was made over is a bit too sugary, it looks way too fake and sanitised. I'm not saying I'd rather it be like the picture in this post, but it could use a more authentic look.
Noi non eccelliamo di certo, ma la Spagna è uno dei paesi più vicini a noi geograficamente e culturalmente, dubito che da noi esistano dei locali che banalizzino una delle loro più grandi piaghe sociali solo perché rese famose da cinema e letteratura (ammesso e concesso che da loro non esiste qualcosa di così riconoscibile come lo è Cosa Nostra nei vari media)
Non mi stupisce più di tanto, in Spagna non sono esattamente dei campioni di sensibilità verso le altre culture. Decisamente ignorante come cosa ma non mi offenderei.
I'm surprised he uses an Android phone, he definitely looks like an iPhone kind of guy.
Same for the "cheese". You need pecorino, not just any grated cheese.
Other than Vercelli as somebody else suggested, I'd say Novara is worth a visit - it has a pretty centre and it's right on the Milan-Turin rail so you can just hop off the train, spend a few hours and then get on with your trip easily. The local team also plays in Serie B and a Pro Vercelli-Novara derby is due in April - the two cities are about 20 minutes apart.

Other than these two I think Casale Monferrato could be a nice field trip, it has amazing food and wine, the town is pleasant and the surroundings are one of the most wildly overlooked areas of northern Italy. 
Yeah it was really a shame they had to cancel it and it never took place.
La mia opinione non qualificata è che lo scivolamento "in avanti" del sonno quando si è in ferie/vacanza è in gran parte dovuto al fatto che usiamo tanti apparecchi con schermi che ci bombardano di luce artificiale e ci iperstimolano. Eliminando quelli l'alternanza sonno/veglia sono sicuro sarebbero molto più regolati dalla luce naturale, sono un po' diffidente della definizione della migliore "finestra" data da questo professore. Però alla fine il professore è lui quindi avrà ragione.
No complaints if we do. We're always screaming bloody murder when he and Asamoah end up staying window after window but they keep proving serviceable at the very least. I'd rather put faith in Stephan and MDS than splashing the cash for a mediocre RB who'd have to integrate quickly - let's be honest there aren't many players in that position which are attainable at the moment - and I'm sure Max and Beppe feel the same way.

I doubt they'd bid that low and he doesn't really seem like a good fit for them. All in all I'm inclined to call bullshit.
I did exactly the same, settled on the XC after spending months searching for an impossible perfect replacement. The XC is great but it feels like dating a girl that kinda looks like your ex you're still thinking about.
Per non parlare di quelle ginocchia a punta.
We got Milan to rid us of Bonucci and we even made them pay for it.
I don't think it was aiming at being a thrilling movie. I enjoy Linklater's films for telling relatable stories in a natural and endearing way as well as for the dialogues - I think Boyhood is remarkable in its own right despite lacking a gripping plot and strong character development.
Watching Spurs for some pre-CL scouting and gotta say I feel like there isn't nearly enough hype around Kane as there should. His movement and positioning are so insane they make his (albeit excellent) finishing redundant. Credit to the manager and the rest of the team but I don't understand why he's not in the discussion for best striker more consistently.
It doesn't but I can definitely agree with OP saying it looks soulless.
This shouldn't be on this sub. I watched it while trying to eat and I was about to choke on my food while laughing at least 4 times.
Hello all, here are my resources:

* Wallpaper: Xperia stock collection

* Launcher: Nova Prime

* Icons: handmade using Adapticons, Whicons and custom backgrounds

* Widgets: Vizorg and Another Widget

I know it's simple and unremarkable but I thought I'd show off mainly because of the icons. Merry Christmas to all! :)
Here's what I did for this (I usually "wing" my dishes so I apologise for providing vague quantities):

* Clean and chop the leek - i like to slice it into quarters lengthwise and then chop from there so the chunks are not too small

* Sauté the leek for about 5 minutes in olive oil. After that, season with salt and marjoram, lower the fire and let cook for another 10 minutes, stirring often and covering with a lid (do not cover the pan fully)

* Meanwhile, crack 2 free range eggs and mix with 1/3 of cup of milk, as much grated Parmigiano Reggiano (any Parmesan-type chees will do) and ground black pepper. Beat the mix for a couple minutes. You can add more cheese to make it creamier but don't go overboard.

* When the leek is ready, add it to the egg mixture in the same bowl. Stir and let sit for a minute

* [If necessary, add some olive oil to the pan] Pour the mix in the pan on medium heat and after about 2-3 minutes, cover with a lid and lower the heat

* Check on the frittata: shake the pan - when you can see the frittata "jiggle" it means it has detached from the pan. Once this happens, flip the frittata helping yourself with the lid or a plate and raise the flame for a minute

* Lower the fire, cover fully with the lid and let cook through for another minute

All in all it's a very simple recipe which is kind of hard to truly master, but it's gonna be tasty and filling nonetheless. If you have any question, ask away!
It's always good to be reminded how high the cost of modern civilisation is to some countries and peoples. This is one of the tragedies that in the long term have the potential to wipe out lots of customs and change cultures forever.
I thought it's because the UK doesn't really have national ID, which we can use to enter also non-Schengen EU countries as well as a few non-EU ones (ex-Yu countries, Morocco, Tunisia, and Turkey).
Many countries do not even need a passport to go abroad. In Italy we can travel pretty much everywhere in Europe with just national ID, I only ever needed the passport the times I left the continent and many people never even have one.

Non c'entra l'affiliazione politica attuale, la liberazione fu tale per tutti a prescindere. Poi lo so che è stata sicuramente una festa molto politicizzata, ma la Forza Nuova odierna non ha nulla a che fare con il regime fascista di allora. Il fatto che qualcuno decida di non festeggiare il 25 aprile non vuole dire che non ne abbia il diritto, far parte di una repubblica non è qualcosa che si può scegliere negli stessi modi di un'affiliazione religiosa.
It so is. I briefly considered skipping s03 altogether - why bother without Pablo? - but I'm glad I didn't because it's easily the best of the 3.

Secondo me è già umiliante alimentare speranze basate su cavilli del genere, con una situazione che quasi di sicuro si risolverà con poco più di questi ammonimenti nei confronti delle federazioni e al massimo qualche sanzione. La Spagna è una nazionale troppo importante e piena di giocatori di primo piano, la FIFA farebbe una cagata allucinante ad escluderli se non per questioni veramente gravi e lapalissiane.
Basta con queste vaccate. Prima il Perù, poi la Spagna - ai mondiali non ci andiamo (giustamente) e basta.
> All the good teams have the best players

True but average players have gotten better. A team fighting relegation in today's top leagues is miles ahead of teams in the same predicament just 20 years ago. All the money funneled into the sport has shifted the level upwards all across the board.
> Juan Esnáider

He's the worst forward I've ever seen at Juve. We bought him to fill in for Del Piero when the latter got seriously injured but his performances were truly appalling. IIRC he went back to Zaragoza after half a season and saved them from relegation immediately going back to scoring like a machine.
That's just what I thought after s02. "They should stop here, Pablo is Pablo, no way I could ever be dragged into the story this much by the Cali people", and yet it was amazing. I understand your point of view as a Colombian though.

For certain sports (for example rugby, football and cricket), each British home nation has its federation and national team - that's why at least year's Euros Wales made the semis, England the RO16, Northern Ireland the group stages, and Scotland did not qualify. For other sports, including tennis, this does not happen and all British athletes compete under the Great Britain flag (not the UK because Northern Irish nationals can freely pledge either for Great Britain or the Republic of Ireland). This means in the Davis cup, the Murray Brothers - who are Scottish - play alongside Edmund and Evans who are English.

That was...strange.
Sorry for being fussy but Rusedski made the finals of the US Open (in 97, when he also reached his career-best result at Wimbledon losing to Pioline in the quarters), and pledged for Great Britain as the British home nations do not have a distinct tennis federation.
How about joining an Italian course? If you work for a private school they might have some going. I'd say it's the arguably the best way to find expats and it will eventually make it easier for you to try and socialise with the locals.
Io sono sempre stato un suo estimatore dai tempi del Cagliari, però ammetto che nonostante porti i risultati a casa troppo spesso fa giocare la squadra in modo troppo noioso, specialmente fino a dicembre/gennaio. Sono il primo ad apprezzarlo ma anche il primo ad augurarmi di tanto in tanto che prima o poi venga qualcuno che ci faccia fare un calcio più piacevole, ma è anche vero che la Juve è sempre stata un po' così.
La vedo come te, il Tottenham è una bella squadra ma è il tipico avversario a cui Allegri sa mettere la museruola per poir soffocarlo lentamente. Mi aspetto il più classico degli 1-0 massimo 2-0 in casa con tipo gol di Rugani e Cuadrado subentrato e poi pallosissimo 0-0 a Londra con 3 tiri in porta totali.
Tottenham are great but I feel this draw is gonna play right into Allegri's hands. He's great at shutting down this kind of team and make us look superior despite possibly not deserving. I agree with other posts here, convincing and comfortable win at home and dull but risk-free draw away.
Looks slower than Wimbledon at the time. This also shows that grass used to wear a lot even back in the day, nowadays it just looks worse because it wears mostly at the baseline while in the past it was more evenly spread out.
I actually like the way it's integrated in spite of customisability. I don't really care for the news feed but commute times and parking spot are a must for me.

You have a point but Mou got the job done in the one competition he could realistically win. He may not be in his prime anymore but he still commands respect in European comps - I'm not saying we wouldn't be favourites but it would be a hard tie.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. Mou is a master tactician - playing teams like us is his bread and knockout European competitions his butter. That tie would have "upset" written all over.

That is not only in incredibly bad taste but also unsafe as fuck. One of those things rips and crashes into a truck's windshield and we're looking at a tragedy.
I feel like this match could potentially put an end to our domestic domination. Fully expecting both teams to grind it out but I wouldn't expect fireworks. Mandzukic would have been our key player but he's out, it's gonna be hard as hell for us to score.
I play recreationally and I have a friend who's not particularly good at anything but is a great pusher. He feeds a lot of high balls and junk balls and it took me years to figure him out. 
I've found that giving him a taste of his own medicine is the strategy that works best. I started ostensibly pushing the ball back in play and using the slice even when not really advantageous and all of a sudden his inability - or at least uncomfortableness - to construct a proper point was exposed more often than not.

Del Piero got a standing ovation at the Bernabeu even despite just having scored a brace to win the game for Juve. That was one of our best moments during very difficult years.
What's your point? 2001 Wimbledon was played with 32 seeds and still won by a wildcard that hadn't done anything noteworthy for months. 
It's the same old conundrum: if he were "transported" from the 60s to today he wouldn't stand a chance of course, but what if he were born in the late 80s - would his talent and feel for the sport flourish the same way in light of technological advancements, new teaching and training methods, and different level of competition? It's just impossible to say.
I think it's insane to expect a 24 year-old to decide to commit to a single club without ever flinching. His priorities could very well change for a million different reasons, and given his career can last at least another ten years then thinking he would keep his word no matter what is delusional. Things hardly stay the same in football nowadays, for him to leave the club could be beneficial both for him and us sooner than we think.

Shitting on the guy has been national sport for the past few weeks but I can''t help but feel for the guy a bit. He was obviously out of his depth and I can only imagine how bad and isolated he must feel right now. There is only so much a golden handshake can do, his confidence and spirit must be totally shattered at the moment.
Wawrinka will come back very inconsistent and his ranking will drop considerably after Roland Garros. He will then have a sudden surge in form before the US Open (possibly at least a final in Cincy/Toronto) just to crash out early in New York and finish the season as inconsistently as he started it, on the fringes of the top 20. I'd be surprised if we ever saw him contend for a Slam again but hey, it's Stan after al.

Dimitrov will not translate his form in the new year but he will awkwardly be in the top 5 for a long time, making for some disappointing early exits early on in the year. I can see him going deep in Wimbledon, which is going to give us the surprise Slam winner of the year.

Save for RG (Rafa again) and Wimbledon (see above), Murray and Djokovic can split the other two Slams, and the IW/Miami combo. Roger will play RG and do alright, but his best moments will be during grass season and the final hardcourt swing. Yet no significant improvements overall from Zverev/Kyrgios, while the current next-gen players move into the top-30/high top-20.

True, now avoiding relegation for one year is a huge occasion as it's a given that the teams coming up from Serie B the following year will be even more trash. Crotone last year were awful until the last couple months, but with their incredible save (which was well deserved to be fair) they were sure so start with a definite advantage over the newcomers. This was not always true in the past and that's why I have finally accepted that reverting to an 18-team league system would be a good idea - less diluted talent and a stronger Serie B (which in our heyday was as good as many national top tier leagues).

I remember I watched this match after being an exchange student in the US for a year and thus being completely disconnected from football. Zlatan at the time for me was just the flashy bastard who had knocked us out of the Euros with a flying backheel but all my friends insisted he was great and had been playing well for us the previous season. This was the first friendly I watched that summer and withing 5 minutes - BANG! He cunts the ball in from like 35 meters. Didn't take me long to warm up to him!
Insigne is one of our best forwards, and Ventura not only benched him for last night's game but then did not even bring him on when it was obvious time was running out and we were desperate for a goal. There's not so much as a personal breed as Ventura has just proven himself to be incompetent.
You get downvoted but I agree. Especially De Rossi and Buffon's "eminence" in the locker room has been outweighing their performance for a while now. Conte's miracle work hid away our problems for a couple of years but the so called Old Guard should have hanged it after the disaster of the 2014 WC. 
Exactly.
I'd say "lucidità" is closer to "clarity" or even better "focus" in English speech. 
I agree with you. The form we've showed since the match at the Bernabeu has been embarassing and while making the playoffs itself is not that big of a tragedy, everyone knew we were in trouble against a team like Sweden the wat wew got there. Results just tell half the story, we've always been the team to beat the big guns while barely edging the likes of Malta, even when we were winning trophies.
It's quite the opposite. "In gamba" roughly means "capable, with broad shoulders".
Congrats Sweden, played this tie to perfection. This hurts but it's for the best, time to clean up and start over.
Was his season on hard courts supposed to be that much better? Apart from the disappointment in NY, he's just barely a top-10 player on this surfaces, if at all.

Ah si me lo ricordo quel thread, incredibile! Passo il suggerimento, non ci avevo pensato.
Ormai non frequento più un granché la casa quindi non saprei dirti con precisione. Chiaro che in molti casi potrebbe essersi trattato di suggestione.
La casa è quella dove abita tutt'ora, in affitto da un suo amico di cui la madre era la precedente "inquilina" fino alla sua morte (avvenuta nella casa stessa). Non ricordo bene i dettagli ma le storie che mi ha raccontato mio padre vanno dalla macchina in cortile che si accende da sola senza chiavi con la radio alzata a palla su un programma con dei contenuti significativi, a un rumore di motore elettrico proveniente da un muro in vetro cemento salvo cessare quando identificato, a molti oggetti che spariscono e riappaiono in posti diversi (quest'ultimo successo anche a me alcune volte). 
Un pauio di anni fa vado qualche giorno da mio padre fuori città. Dormivo su un letto gonfiabile con il motorino elettrico, in una stanza con bagno separati solo da una porta. L'ultima mattina prima della partenza mi alzo, tolgo le lenzuola, attacco la spina del materassino e faccio partire lo sgonfiamento; poi vado in bagno a lavarmi i denti e lasciando la porta aperta. Mi trovo quindi a circa un metro dal materasso, con il muro di mezzo e la porta circa mezzo metro più a destra. Da quella posizione vedo la porta d'ingresso alla stanza, che rimane chiusa durante l'episodio.

Quando ritorno nella stanza, dopo circa 2 minuti, il materasso è sgonfio per metà - ma l'interruttore del motorino è girato su "gonfia" e la spina staccata dal muro. Impossible che qualcuno sia entrato, lo avrei visto al 100% e sentito altrettanto certamente. Tutto innocuo per carità, ma questo si è verificato al termine di una sequela di altri episodi riportati da mio padre, e credetemi quando vi dico che non è certo il tipo da farsi suggestionare da certe cose.

I think that is kind of the point of this scoring system. Equally hard to get past an equivalent opponent but quick affair for lopsided matches. I understand it may not be to everyone's liking but I actually enjoy this scoring system as it makes every single game matter even more.

I don't think the ATP plans to introduce this system in tour matches any time soon, but this could solve the dilemma of 5-set matches for women at Slams. Everyone could play with this scoring system during the first week, then switch to the regular system from the 4th round onwards when the schedule is less cramped. 
Over the past few years I have to admit I found myself rooting against him pretty much all the time; I also have to admit that since he started being a "normal" player after 2016 Roland Garros the tour has been feeling a bit empty. For so many years he was the ultimate test and his drop was so dramatic it does not feel right. Now that he's been out I actually find myself lookign forward to his comeback, I think tennis needs his fire and competitiveness. I hope he drops the nice-guy act and just comes back in full villain mode because that is his best version, and few things are better to watch in sports than peak Djokovic.

Rafa's withdrawal also means that Krajinovic is propelled to a whopping personal best of #43 in the world - not to mention unprecedented money prize. It's incredible how much a good run of form and a bit of luck can do for the career of journeyman players, cheers to him!
Ho visto in effetti, potrei fare così. Spero solo di non fare casino nell'installarlo.
Quelle non ci sono, non sono sicuro ma credo che per le case con il riscaldamento autonomo non siano obbligatorie. Comunque grazie, ci penso!
[AskItaly] Mi sono appena trasferito in un'appartamento con riscaldamento autonomo ma con il termostato non programmabile (in pratica solo la rotellina). Qualcuno ha consigli su come gestire la cosa? Fondamentalmente mi interessa che ci siano sui 20°C quando mi alzo (verso le 7.30) e quando rientro (verso le 18.30) ma allo stato attuale delle cose mi alzo e arrivo col freddo. Ho pensato di lasciare il termostato tipo a 15°C tutto il giorno e alzarlo quando rientro, ma temo di dimenticarmi di abbassarlo prima di uscire e farmene per una barcata di €€€. Grazie dei consigli in anticipo :)
Haha thanks, she appreciated :) They were actually pretty tasty too.
Whoa people really went to town on that downvote button. 
You've just described most forwards/attacking midfielders from the Balkans.
Hold on, isn't "Listopad" actually "October" in Croatian? I guess up north leaves fall a month later!
It looks nice but honestly feels disconnected from local culture and nothing more than decorative. Same concept but with local art/personalities would have been far more interesting.
True but he is naturally right handed so his coordination from that side is better than most people have on their wrong side.
Could a 4.0 player go toe-to-toe with a top-100 pro playing with his wrong hand? I mean this FH here was out by a mile in pro terms but I know I'd be satisfied with the execution at least (I'm probably more of a 3.0-3.5 though).
Faccio sta discussione ogni anno con un mio amico. Lui e la sua ragazza lavorano per una ONG, a fine missione rimangono tecnicamente disoccupati in quanto gli scade il contratto e passano un paio di mesi qua - finiscono sempre in posti tipo Libia, Libano, Haiti, Sierra Leone, Congo etc quindi normale che si prendano un po' di vacanza. Tutte le volte chiedono e ottengono la disoccupazione, il che secondo me è parzialmente ingiusto perchè volendo potrebbero ripartire il giorno dopo, ma rifiutano spesso missioni per vari motivi (assolutamente legittimi per carità) per magari un mese prima di ripartire. Chiaro che si tratta di un caso diverso da quello descritto da te però mi da sempre da pensare.
I think it's a system in place to cement the group of top players for marketing reasons? Good ranking also possibly gives you byes into 2nd rounds thus earning free points potentially all season long.
I'd say it's a toss up, surely in Paris many top players often seem flushed out and with their minds already at the Finals. Someone like Nando could go to town on an undermotivated Thiem, especially on this surface, but Domi is still the better player.
I'm starting to think we'll keep seeing this kind of statements forever while he floats around or barely in the top 10. Put your money where your mouth is Nick!
Also, when I showed her this subreddit she was in awe at how amazing most dishes look. No irony detected whatsoever.
Wait Cuevas won a match on indoor hard? What the heck is going on here?
Jeez, poor guy. Hope he gets well sooner than that.
In what latin alphabet is "Q" a substitute for "KH"? Sounds like they just want a distinctive country code and plates.
Iker Muniain? I thought he was gonna be huge.
87 in the live rankings! I think he does not really care anymore.
I think you forgot the Ortisei Challenger.
Fair enough, Delpo is obviously a fan favourite. PCB is a great player, he's just not exactly the most exciting.
I don't see the problem, there is not a lot of stuff written about it in English and I thought this article was an ok overview. It just happens to be on Linkedin.
I was looking at the [live doubles ranking](http://live-tennis.eu/it/classifica-atp-doppio-live) and noticed how the lack of younger contenders is even more evident than in singles. Kontinen and Peers are the only under-30s in the top-10, 8 in the top-40. I understand in doubles the fitness factor plays a different role but still quite noteworthy that tennis today is dominated by older players. Seems like 32 is the new 25.
He was also one of our best clutch players. I loved it when he was subbed on in the Coppa final against Milan and scored the winner shortly after - he seemed to score few but crucial goals. At the time I thought it was better to have a Morata score 15 - of which a good half of them being winning goals - instead of a Higuain who scored 36 but was toothless in big games. It turns out having both would actually be the best scenario.
Let's be honest, we all want to see Delpo and nobody wants to have PCB in London.
[More info](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/corviale-isnt-architecture-failed-beliefs-built-marcel-krenz/)
I'd say he's the kind of player we fans always want to get rid of but end up being glad we did not.
Lol at Fucsovics stopping mid-jump+fistpump after winning the set on a net cord to apologize to Čilić.
I was there last time in 2013 and the city was a gigantic building site, I remember being very curious what the outcome would be as it was quite obvious a makeover was pretty much needed. The new look is cool but seems a bit too generic "new central/eastern Europe" honestly.

We're forever lost in Milan's shadow!
I'm pretty sure she could still realistically push for the top 10. 
I think it's different because in your case we're talking about two different islands with a separate perceived identity, by us in the continent at least. It's harder for common folk to make the distinction with peoples from contiguous lands, just think of how many people see central and eastern Europe as a conglomerate with the same culture and values. On top of that add the fact that the Irish cause is well known and Britain is seen by many as a country that oppressed its conquered.
That would have guaranteed about 5 different civil wars in the following 30 years.
I don't think I am making any bizarre assumptions and I don't really understand why you're being defensive about it. Anne Frank is a well known figure who is relevant way beyond school programs, her diary is one of the most read non - fiction works of last century. Her story might be one in 60 millions but her diary is not, just as other cases are better known than others. It made the experience of millions of people accessible for younger generations, it's unfair to bring up the fact that all others who died were equally important because whereas their lives mattered the same, her witness has become exemplary. By your logic then everyone should just know what they're taught in school and nothing else.
My point is that her story is quite well known for better or worse and even if you never set foot in class her name is bound to pop up at some point. Let's say schools in Yugoslavia did not teach about her (highly doubt it but), Sinisa's been living in Italy for over 20 years and over here she's popular enough to be identified with the jewish community strongly enough that even ultras would understand what the sticker with her in a Roma jersey meant. I just think he did not want to stick a foot in his mouth over a very delicate topic and instead just came across as a bit thick. 
Ok but come on you don't need to go to school to know who Anne Frank is. She's part of European culture.
It will be interesting to see where it goes from here for Stan. Norman was definitely the mastermind behind his success and between age and injuries Wawrinka is not in a great position going forward. Hope he proves me wrong of course.
And Wozniacki just bageled Halep in Singapore. Double hmm.
Well they are definitely aware that this golden age is about to end otherwise they would not push the Nextgen marketing the way they have been. I think Sascha and Shapovalov will be shoved down our throats quite a lot in the next couple years so to build their popularity in time for Roger's retirement - which let's face it it's gonna be a massive blow to global popularity of the sport. A field of Rafa, Murray and Nole is not enough to carry the circus with Federer out of the picture.
He will still be playing and succesful in 4-5 years. 
It's easy to forget how great past players were with all the exposure the current champions get. Whenever I watch Pete highlights I'm taken aback at how unbelievable he was.
Tacchinardi allegedly boned Lippi's daughter and according to Deschamps he got to play more because of it. Then again Paulo Sousa allegedly did too and he was shipped out to Borussia Dortmund.

Maybe I haven't explained the issue well - before resetting the phone neither fingerprint nor pattern worked, thus locking me out of the phone. The issue is not being able to use fingerprints to unlock or not, but I don't want to suddenly be locked out of the phone again because every unlock method stops working.
Check out the [Xperia XZ1 Compact](https://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_xz1_compact-8610.php).
Since resetting it we haven't registered new fingers. 
I should make it clear that after resetting the phone everything went back to working normally. 
It's quite obviously the first thing we did. Did not change anything and the phone would go straight to being locked for 4 minutes after a single wrong pattern (which was the correct one by the way).

Dude I ask myself that question every day and I'm not even hungarian.
Peak Novak. May not have been the *best player* ever but he sure was the toughest to beat.
We've seen Juve start slow 2 years ago when a "paradigm shift" occurred in the frontline and I think we're witnessing it again, with the dissolution of the BBC on top of that. Bringing in 2.5 wingers (Costa, Bernardeschi and Pjaca) means we're changing skin, and frankly it was never going to be easy rebuilding one of the best defences of the decade with one of its components leaving and the others aging. 

That said, I think our offense will come together but we have a chronic lack of creativity in our midfield - I think we've slept pretty hard on Borja Valero this summer - and the defense needs a lot of work. I'm seeing the glass half full but Napoli has really upped the ante and I believe it will be very hard to keep the Scudetto regardless of Juve's performance.

Sicuri che sia italiano? Il piccolo poster attaccato dietro ha una parola che sembra tedesca e la didascalia dal sito non conferma la sua nazionalità. 
Team performance has become extremely relevant only in the past few years, if you go back you will find many winners who did not necessarily lead their club/NT to continental trophies. Even Nedved won it in 2003 despite not even playing in the final we lost against Shevchenko's Milan. Other winners such as Weah or Rivaldo whose teams did not even make the final, or Baggio in 1993 playing for Juve who weren't even in the European Cup (and in a year without international football).
Actually I had to check but you're right, [it was against Piacenza!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6EEeOJ_kP4) I guess I got the red jerseys mixed up!
I was at the stadium for Juve-Triestina and Trezeguet scored a rare 25m screamer after a few minutes. It was a fun season!
I had a season ticket (just 190€!) for that Serie B camapaign and it was awesome throughout for us fans. Juve were obviously winning often and scoring lots of goals which made for very entertaining matches and a morale boost for everyone after the Calciopoli thing. The club also organised secondary events to keep the spirits up, such as a reunion of past legends on the pitch on matchday and special celebrations for Del Piero becoming all-time leading goalscorer. 

On top of that, Juve were certainly a cut above everyone else but the rest of the league was very competitive and coming up with Napoli and Genoa tells it all. It was one of the best seasons to be a fan, Serie B felt more like "sport" and less like business. 
Honestly he has a history of verbal abuse towards fans, umpires, and opponents. In Italy his shenanigans are a bit more in the public eye and I can guarantee you there's around 3-4 incidents of the sort every year, this latest one being the most serious one. I think tennis officials are just tired of his bullshit, and I can't blame them one bit.

This is a bit more than a feel good story about a tiny nation, they have one of the best-run national teams in all sports and considerable talent on the field. Making the QFs at the Euros is no joke and I'm sure they will contend a place in the knockout stages no matter the opposition. Gotta have huge amounts of respect for the players, technical staff and the federation alike for creating all this.
So big they also had to release a sequel up north feat. Volga.

We may be in a better financial position but still we're no PSG, Man City/Utd, Real nor Barça. They are the big spenders and everyone else eventually gives in to their money power. I don't think Juve plans on ever being that kind of club internationally and I believe the focus will always be on developing young stars and selling them for a profit while building a team that does not depend on them. Let's be real, Dybala is great but we wouldn't be much less of a team without him, and I think the board will act accordingly.
Well now that it's been said we can put that to rest! /s

He won't be playing here past 2019 in my opinion. If he develops as we all hope he does, the big guns will come knocking and we all know Elkann/Agnelli won't turn down 150-200 million. If his development stalls, he might become an expendable resource as we would still be able to sell him for a high price. 
I'm gonna go ahead and say it, if we fail in the Champions League - meaning failing to make the QFs or losing the QFs to a team which is inferior on paper - I would sack Allegri and pick Carletto up. I know things got sour when he first managed us but now it's a different club and I'm sure he'd be stoked to come back and fix basically the only unsuccesful stint of his managing career. 

We have a squad of stars which is his bread and butter and I think after 6 titles in a row there is less pressure for us to win the league (where Carlo has always been weaker) and I still think there are just a handful of more suited people to get the CL job done. It's not gonna happen but I'd be surprised if Marotta hadn't even thought about it for a second.

Yes it does sound a bit West Country, incredible to think you're from the other side of the world! Thanks a lot and congrats on an amazing AMA.
I'm gonna add:

* Different constitutional status and process for independence

* Completely different level of violence involved

* Different ethnical implications

* Last but not least, the EU was not as strong a voice back then as it is now, and this time around the quarrel directly involves one of its members.

I'm baffled to read that some people believe that it's hypocritical of the EU to make these declarations. Apart from independence claims, there is very little in common between the two situations.
I don't think he cares about the ranking anymore to be fair. Regaining World #1 was probably a goal of his but that ship has sailed with Rafa winning the US Open, if a season with 2 Slams and 2 Masters isn't enough to get there I think he will focus on doing well at the big events over ranking.
Don't know why you're getting downvoted, this is always hilarious and Roy Keane is possibly the fittest character for this.

Since you're in Porto make sure you don't miss Galicia, it's a beautiful region and relatively off the beaten path. Vigo is a couple hours from Porto and is in the middle of the Rias Baixas area, then you have A Coruña and Santiago which are both beautiful and packed with culture. If you do go there you have to try licor café, one of the best liquors I've ever had and impossible to find anywhere else.
I'm with you on this one. The guy would receive a lot of public support and in no time making fun of gay people would become lame. If a high profile player came out it would change public perception of the issue considerably.

We use the italian pronounciation. Often the american pronounciation is radically different from the italian one - for example I remember the Terri Schiavo case where the media would pronounce her name as "Shy-voe" whereas italian pronounciation would be "Skee-ah-voh", or Tedy Bruschi (Broo-shee vs. Broo-skee) - so it's a bit counterintuitive for us to use american rules. 
As a recent Sony convert, their timely security updates are just one of the aspects that make me really happy with my purchase. The phone (X Compact) is great and the software experience is amazing, I was afraid that coming from years of Cyanogenmod/Lineage roms I'd be annoyed at all the OEM tidbits but Sony's implementation is unobtrusive and there are a lot of useful features that I already find myself relying on. It's a shame that so many people are turned off by the unfashionability of the brand because if a year-old midranger has me this satisfied, I can only imagine how great the recent and flagship models must be.

It was scary as shit to have your team play against them. They always had some hard ass defender, a moustached striker who would bag 40 goals per season, and they played with hatred for the west in dim stadia before a home crowd of rough, spirit - fueled factory workers. /s

(Juventino here) il rigore di Petagna non c'era ma ero sicuro che l'arbitro difficilmente sarebbe tornato sui suoi passi visto che era a pochi metri. Secondo me la VAR è molto più efficace per tornare su non-decisioni, quando c'è da cambiare una decisione presa sarà comune vedere l'arbitro rimanere sulle proprie posizioni per non perdere la faccia. Sul fallo di Lichtsteiner invece il sistema ha funzionato bene.

Oops, my bad I actually meant to talk about his written Italian! Corrected now.
I remember a few years ago we faced Lech Poznan in the EL and he completely destroyed us with a hat-trick in Turin and a goal in Poland. We were shit at the time but he looked like a good forward and I've had a soft spot for him since, really sad to read he's in this kind of trouble.
His spoken Italian is good, he definitely is intelligent enough to be able to speak his mind quite eloquently but without sounding like a media-trained bot as most of his colleagues. Can't vouch for his written Italian ~~English~~ but I would expect it to be at least as good.
Il campionato Italiano in quanto tra i primi del ranking UEFA ha già il vantaggio di mandare in Europa più squadre della maggior parte degli altri campionati nazionali, il sistema è oggettivo ed equo sia per le squadre che per le leghe, tenendo conto delle stagioni più recenti. Il Milan negli ultimi anni ha avuto risultati deludenti e la trafila che ha dovuto fare per arrivare in Europa è figlia di ciò, premiarla per il blasone (ammettiamolo, un po' stinto) andrebbe contro qualsiasi logica di merito e di sviluppo delle leghe europee.

I feel like outside of England we're forgetting really fast how amazing Drogba was. He could win matches on his own if he decided to, I've seen very few players with his intensity and leadership.
Anch'io faccio 6h/giorno ma mi trovo davvero benissimo, mi avanza il tempo (anch'io ho lunghi tempi di percorrenza con i mezzi) per fare di sera qualche ora di un secondo lavoro pagato più del doppio di quello che prendo per il mio "day-job" quindi a meno che non mi propongano un bel giorno un aumento sostanzioso mi va benissimo tenermi flessibilità e giornate meno estenuanti. Hai provato a pensare a qualcosa del genere? Come sviluppatore software sono sicuro che trovi abbastanza facilmente da impegnarti qualche ora libera da impegnare da freelance.
Their partnership was great but I think if they teamed up often it would lose its magic. I'd like to see them trying to win a Slam in doubles in the futures and they can surely serve charity purposes very well though.
I think the role of "the villain" suits him in a narrative where Federer and Nadal are the unchallanged fan favourites. The guy was incredibly close to have everyone question Rafa and Roger's place as the greates ever, and he did that by dominating the two most popular players ever for years. He's not a villain because he's a dick, he's a villain because he disrupted the status quo.
It's one of my favourite cities but as much fun as it is for a visitor it's sad to hear that so many locals are so disheartened about the city's future. Everyone seems to be at the same time very proud to live in an amazing and unique city and oppressed by the apparent lack of opportunites and slow economy. It's really a shame because the city offers a lot and the people can be some of the warmest and most open (or the opposite, but it's part of the charm).
Fun fact: the Polish word for "road" (*droga*) means "drugs" in Italian.
I was never a fan of his and usually root for his opponents, but I feel he's being sorely missed. He's the perfect villain to go up against the two superheros.

A Torino abbiamo la pizza al padellino, più piccola e con impasto più spesso.
Mi è venuto il respiro pesante solo a leggere questo commento.
Sono d'accordo con te, ma almeno qua a Torino ci sono tanti ristoranti che fanno sia pizze buone che primi e secondi più che decenti. Ovvio che non parliamo di ristoranti stellati, ma la stragrande maggioranza dei locali è di fascia media in cui si spendono 30€ per una cena completa. La moda del mangiare bene e "sofisticato" anche per giovani del ceto medio è recente (da quando ci sono Masterchef e compagnia), un tempo esistevano solo la piola o il ristorante "come si deve" e la pizzeria+ristorante è una via di mezzo che accontenta molti gusti e molte tasche.
Mi stupisce vedere l'olio d'oliva negli ingredienti, le poche volte che è stata fatta in casa ho visto usare olio "bianco" come quello di girasole. Allora evidentemente l'avversione all'olio d'oliva è un fenomeno tipico delle mie famiglie.
Aka *sirnica* aka *burek sa sirom*! Basically a staple food in the Balkans, so tasty and nutritious, you can find it for about 1€ in most bakeries. Add a yogurt and you've got a perfect breakfast/mid morning snack. Unfortunately it's really hard to make properly at home.
Dipende, ce ne sono parecchie dove locali e servizio sono di ottimo livello e paragonabili ai ristoranti tradizionali.
Credo sia più dovuto al fatto che in Piemonte l'ulivo è quasi sconosciuto e probabilmente comprarlo dalla Liguria è costato molto per lungo tempo.
Mi baso su racconti e osservazioni di 20 anni fa, ma i miei nonni in casa usavano solo burro per cucinare e al massimo olio di semi per condire (è ancora così in molti paesi in fondo). A loro dire l'abitudine di usare l'olio d'oliva in tavola arrivò con l'immigrazione dal sud Italia, sia i miei nonni materni che paterni ne avevano una sempre una bottiglia ma che veniva usata solo all'occorrenza e non come condimento principale. Immagino una cosa come l'olio di arachidi o sesamo oggi, si trova e viene usato ma non come abitudine e comunque solo con certe ricette o piatti. Ci sta anche che l'esperienza di provincia torinese/cuneese non sia rappresentativa di altre realtà.
Viva la figa.
Da quello che ho sentito nei racconti di nonni/genitori (i miei nonni non usavano nemmeno olio d'oliva in quanto pressoché sconosciuto fino al dopoguerra in Piemonte) oltretutto le pizzerie per molti anni sono state prevalentemente da asporto o comunque posti molto informali, stile kebabbaro al giorno d'oggi. Le pizzerie con cucina, più simili ai ristoranti tradizionali, sembrerebbero arrivate dagli anni 80.
I have an X Compact. The XZ1C is a proper high end phone, but the XC is a very solid midrange. I usually make it by the end of the day with around 40% battery (3-4ish hours screen on) and it very seldom lags or stutters. The camera is alright and the overall feel is excellent. 

The only downside is that the speakers are very quiet, so if you often listen to music that's the only reason why I would not recommend it. For someone who uses the phone as I do (mostly Whatsapp and messaging, reddit, some music/radio and occasional browsing/shopping, basically no gaming) the XC is more than enough and I'd never pay twice as much for the XZC1. If you're not in a rush you could wait for deals on the XZC1, otherwise the XC is a great phone.

Per carità quella è una partita, ciò che non mi convince è che lo vedo un po' timido. Per farti un esempio senza scomodare i mostri sacri, un giocatore come Drogba (tecnicamente forse non al livello di Dybala) quando c'era da vincere una partita lo vedevi ovunque in campo con la bava alla bocca, ha vinto praticamente una Champions da solo facendo tutto dal libero al centravanti al vice-allenatore. Non dico che tutti debbano avere un'agonismo del genere ma temo che Dybala possa diventare uno Zlatan (bello ma non vincente fino in fondo).
La lezione è che bisogna cagare sempre sul luogo di lavoro.

Io sono gobbo ma rimango scettico su di lui. Tecnicamente non si discute ma oltre ad avere un piede solo (piuttosto comune fra i mancini) lo vedo poco "cattivo". In campionato è dominante ma sui grandi palcoscenici gli manca qualcosa - quella furia agonistica e temperamento da leader che contraddistingue i campioni dagli ottimi giocatori. Sicuramente è ancora in tempo a sviluppare queste qualità ma i grandissimi secondo me le hanno innate.

Honestly including Padania is a bit inappropriate considering the relevance of the other movements mentioned. Padania was little more than a provocation with no, historical, ethnic nor cultural background to it. In northern Italy there are other independentist movements, you'd have a hard time finding anyone supporting the idea of Padania nowadays.

Mi spiace che la cosa ti faccia restare male ma non credo sia così fuori dalla norma in realtà. Nelle compagnie di amici ci sono sempre alcune caratteristiche che accomunano un po' tutti e altre che accomunano solo alcuni dei membri del gruppo. Esempio, 5 amici che si conoscono dalla scuola e si vedono regolarmente; 1 di questi non guarda il calcio quindi non viene invitato quando si va al pub a vedere la partita il sabato; un altro non sopporta la discoteca e non viene chiamato quando si organizza una serata a ballare; un altro non si fa le canne e quando il piano per il pomeriggio è di svernare al parchetto, dopo un po' si evita di chiamarlo...i sottoinsiemi sono infiniti. 

Io mi ricordo che finchè si aveva 21-22 anni si tendeva a fare sempre tutto tutti assieme, col tempo gli interessi si sono differenziati sempre più e adesso ci sono amici che sono sempre tali anche se ci piace fare cose diverse e ci si vede poco, mentre altri li vedo molto più spesso pur sapendo che se organizzano una serata sushi difficilmente verrò invitato (non sono un fan). Poi magari mi sbaglio e c'è dell'altro ma io darei ai tuoi amici il beneficio del dubbio.
Everyone knows what that means, and even if he was oblivious there is no way in hell nobody said anything to him about it. That said, he was very young and I think he just wanted to be a smartass thinking showing off as fascist would make him look cool (it didn't).
This is just a Murray version of the (tired) Arsenal 4th place meme basically.
I think his reputation might have helped in the very early days, but it would all come crashing down if the players sensed he was not up to the task, no matter the credit he had with the club. He walked in as a club legend, and now is the legitimate leader because of what he has accomplished and the way he has.
I used to think he commanded respect because of his stature as a former player, but at this point I think he commands respect because he's just damn good at his job. There is plenty of examples of former legends who could never really cut it as managers, no matter the respect players had for them. People like Zidane and Cruijff are just born with it, on or off the pitch does not really make a difference.
I don't think DDR and BRD count because they were one country and nation that was artifically split and later reunited. Czechs and Slovaks have a lot of history and culture in common but they are definitely distinct.
Ieri sera ad una Feltrinelli a Torino ho sentito un piccolo concerto dei Selton che presentavano il nuovo album. Già mi piacevano prima ma dopo averli visti dal vivo, anche se solo per una 20ina di minuti, sono decisamente un fan. Li trovo freschi e originali pur non avendo inventato assolutamente nulla, un mix ben riuscito e un prodotto apprezzabile in generale. Chi vuole distruggermeli in un paio di paragrafi?
I think that was a different situation, Montenegro is a very small country that was kind of "let go" by Serbia and is still home to a lot of Serbians. The ethnic/economic divide between Czechia and Slovakia is certainly larger and this is why I think it was less predictable that the two would remain on such good terms.
To be fair you'd be hardly pressed to find two nations who stayed on more amicable terms after a split than you two guys.
I've seen videos about this, I can't help but think that Courier got a bit shafted during that match. I mean Pete didn't necessarily do anything wrong, but his state must have affected Courier and it definitely affected the crowd. It seemed to me like the match was played in unfair conditions after Pete's breakdown.
One of my favourites is about Lippi and Deschamps getting physical in Juve's locker room during the infamous 98-99 season which saw the manager end his first stint. After a tough loss (can't remember which), some of the senior players confronted Lippi's choices and Deschamps apparently remarked that he was consistently fielding Tacchinardi in midfield because the latter had been banging Lippi's daughter - who was also rumoured to be quite the promiscuous type. That led to a huge fight and eventually to Lippi's resignation.
A Torino in effetti circa 2007-2012 un sacco di gente si improvvisava DJ. Era il periodo d'oro della nightlife in città e pressochè chiunque fosse munito di attrezzatura trovava uno straccio di locale in cui mettere due dischi. Ora il fenomeno è un po' tramontato, ho alcuni amici che hanno piatti e altre amenità in casa a prendere polvere.

As a former owner of an original Moto X, I am all too familiar with that barren land of sorrow.
They've published the list of devices that will get updated to Android Oreo, and it made people very mad as many models that were using updgrades to O as a selling point (most notably the Moto G4) aren't actually included. Not nice on their part but yeah, reading that subreddit one would think smartphones are the biggest deal on this planet.
You must not hang out on /r/Android much then, they're roasting Motorola so hard because of their dodgy update policies.
Sure a global perspective is useless, but also Sweden is among the richest countries in the world. I live in Italy, a developed country where 2 grand a month is still considered a hell of a payday - let alone in most of southern, central and Eastern Europe. 
Before tax maybe, in a handful of countries at least. Even 2k/month after tax is still more than 95% of the world population would ever earn.
Yeah missing one of these is the equivalent of having a Panenka saved in football.
This is the kind of song that's just perfect when you're chilling with a couple of good friends at 8 am after one of those carefree, sound nights out. I miss those, it's been forever.
Boy that's how you piss off an opponent...ballsy to do at 5-5 one set down thoug.
Bizarro Larry!
Dude that's Giovanni Rana himself! He's like the anti-Larry, the kind guy who everyone wants to have over for sunday lunch.
Lo è! A parte quando si crepa per vedere una partita in piazza o si viene presi a manganellate durante l'aperitivo s'intende.
This gets a bit lost in conversion but the point still stands - the price he went for is ridiculous but would have been far more ridiculous had he not had a buyout clause "capping" his price at 200ish million pounds. Without a clause, it can be speculated that Barça could have rejected such an amount (they could not this time around) and if PSG were set on buying him then they could have made an even more outrageous offer.
I think it's just reddit's algorithm's fluctuation, the post is archived
He looked completely inadequate last night and most of the times he's played he's been bang average at best. Potentially awful business there for us.
/u/durablepants on the matter: 

> No, he would not move for 200, thats too low.

Sits at -3. He was right, he would have gone for even more than 222 if it weren't for the buyout clause.
Late bold prediction : this is going to 5 sets
Boh io la vedo come lui, devo preoccuparmi?
I agree, my comment was in response to all those saying it will definitely be a bloodbath.
I'm surprised everyone is predicting Anderson sito get massacred, if this were a 4th round I'm sure many would believe Kevin could pull off the upset. I think we're all discounting him too soon, he's been playing phenomenally and Nadal really hasn't been tested that much. Gonna give the edge to Rada of course but Anderson will play knowing this is his chance, it's not gonna be as lopsided as everyone expects.
We've done it /r/tennis. We feed our own discussion, we don't need the outside world anymore.
Trapattoni's English was ridiculous and he seemed to do alright with Ireland. His German is legendary but won with Bayern and RB Salzburg; I doubt his Portuguese is any good but he won the title even there. To be fair he sounds odd in Italian as well.

My point is that language is not always a barrier, you can speak crap (insert language) but still be great at communicating and your message will come through. Capello just didn't give a shit and the FA got shafted big time.
Who did Mike partner with during their time apart?
That's not really the case though, often the cameras show the judge after a wrong challenge as to give them credit for the correct call.
Usually the stat would refer to "break points" as in *converted*, ESPN shows a flipped stat for "break points saved" which looks a bit forced, as it would be to show "aces conceded". I don't watch ESPN streams very often and overall it's a very different experience from what I'm used to (Eurosport international, BBC and Sky have a much more mellow tone to their production) and this is one of the elements that make it such.
How counterintuitive is to show a "Break points saved" stat card? ESPN is weird.
Not by a lot but it definitely did. At this point it's worth challenging every close ball and hope for the error margin to come to the rescue.
Mid-range specs definitely do not mean the phone is shit. In fact I find it to be a very good phone especially considering the price range. 99% of users wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the XC and a flagship based on regular tasks.
I'm gonna call Diego in 3/4 sets, PBC is great but Schwartzman's aggression and form give him the edge in my opinion, he's also not gonna make as many UEs as Shapovalov. PBC needs to be more proactive if he wants to win because Diego at times has been looking like a man on a mission.

Not sure about Querrey-Anderson, KA was great but Lorenzi is not an impossible task and I haven't seen Querrey against Mischa which apparently was his best match.
> Fiore ha però chiesto "a rutti (sic) i responsabili delle sezioni" di invitare tre categorie di persone


Guarda io ho da un mese e qualcosa l' X Compact ed è davvero notevole. Cercavo qualcosa di piccolo venendo da un Moto X originale, per lavoro ho un Galaxy S7 e mi ha fatto rendere conto che il formato compatto è davvero imprescindibile se si è abituati. Così rimarresti nell'ecosistema Sony (che trovo eccellente) e avresti aggiornamenti di versione ancora per almeno la prossima versione main di Android (Oreo) - con Huawei questo scordatelo.

Visto che sta per uscire l' XZ1 Compact, l' XC potrebbe scendere di prezzo prossimamente, se va sotto i 300€ ti garantisco che è un ottimo affare. Se invece vuoi cambiare un po' genere, sul G6 ho letto effettivamente molte cose positive.
Meglio, attaccano il tartaro in modo più aggressivo. 
Usa il filo per darti un'ultima passata prima della visita.
Moto E4. Con un po' di culo trovi anche il Moto G5 (decisamente superiore) su per giù a quei prezzi.
Portati assolutamente una tenda, di notte in qualsiasi bosco a questo punto dell'anno la temperatura scende già parecchio e l'umidità ti infradicia pioggia o non pioggia. Visto che mi sembra di capire che non sia esattamente un veterano, il mio consiglio è di lasciar perdere il bivacco notturno se le previsioni danno brutto e, se proprio vuoi prenderti una fraccata d'acqua e fango, fare al massimo una gita in giornata.
I'm not surprised, being in charge of transfers is not really a taught skill for managers in Italy and he's definitely more of a locker-room/field kind of guy. Not at all to take away from his professional figure but he needs his Marottas and Orialis.
I fucking went to sleep after this point thinking it was over.
I totally agree with you, although it was not my DE of choice Unity was my gateway into Linux altogether. It's just that the community seemed very resistant to it for the longest time.
Whatever Delpo was given, I definitely want some.
> the beautiful desktop that is Unity

I haven't been using Linux for a couple years now but I started back when Unity was "the" new DE (10.10 I believe) and Canonical announced it was going to be default. Literally everyone was up in arms and talked about Unity as if it were the anti-Christ forever. It's strange to see that people actually have warmed up to it in the end.
Good seeing Thiem not giving Delpo any discounts. It must be painful for him too to see his opponent suffer but good sportsmanship comes before sympathy.
It does, thanks! Still ridicolous that one has to tinker so much to use such a basic feature of such a basic app.
Whatsapp saves all media in unencrypted folders in the phone memory, which is shit but it's the texting standard in my country so I don't have much of a choice anyway. 
He gets some hate because of his alleged involvement in a betting scandal a few years ago (which some say was covered up) and his neo-fascist sympathies when he was young. 

Also since saturday night's match against Spain, a lot of people on forums have been getting at him as he's past his prime (well, duh) and his presence stifles the development of younger goalkeepers. 

Mostly I believe this is down to the fact that he's the long-standing captain of the most hated club in Italy but he's certainly not an unconditionally loved figure.
Sure that works fine but it's kind of a hassle to do it when you have thousands of photos from Whatsapp ranging from silly selfies to NSFW. An option to hide full folders like in Pikture would have been welcome.

Edit: actually scratch that, it does not work fine at all
It's like having a Masters and a 250 happening on alternate days.
I used to stop over there (or Breuil-sur-Roya) whenever I travelled by Vespa from Turin to Sanremo for summer holidays, the road is very scenic and fun to ride even on an old crappy bike such as that. 

Once I had an issue with the spark plug and although it was a sunday and all shops and mechanics were closed, I explained the issue to the owner of the café I was having a break at and, it turns out he had an old Vespa too. He goes in the back and gets the spark plug, but warns me that it had not been running for years and it might be toast. 

I replaced it and, lo and behold, it worked flawlessly! Probably wouldn't have been able to get home if it weren't for that guy, thank you wherever you are now!

Reminds me of the [Belogradchik fortress](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zYTirGD0GE0/VrBmd-kDlwI/AAAAAAABLYE/ciNRbZle1-E/belogradchik-fortress-62.jpg?imgmax=800) in Bulgaria.
I found it to be the same as elsewhere. Spanish flour on the other hand seemed to me weirdly gritty and lumpy.
Cyril Théréau
Haha you did, pretty awesome also that you came out of 2 years of lurking to do so! Have a good day :)
You just solved my life.
I'm actually surprised he's not garnering more attention, him being an American at the *US* Open and a recent Wimbledon semifinalist. I'm sure he'd rather have it this way though.
Dai Paolo cazzooooo
Holy shit, Anderson looking really good out there, it's not easy to grind with Lorenzi but he's doing just that, he just breaks Paolo's game down and then finishes him point after point basically making no errors. I'm really impressed.
Sure, he's no tier Dimi/Feli but he can be worked into a teen idol quite easily if worked onto. If I were a sports marketing/publishing agent I'd be all over him (it's too late).
Impressive win for PBC, this was not an easy match. He looks like the type of player moving forward who maybe is not going to upset the big guns but will win every match he should, a bit à la Ferrer/Berdych of old. I think he will dispatch either between Diego and Pouille and has a considerably good chance of making the final.

As for Shapovalov, we're gonna see this kid everywhere soon. Has the game, the personality, the looks. A straight shooter with "tennis superstar" written all over.
He's playing really well but he's making errors in key moments, PBC is doing a great job at keeping his level constant and capitalising on the chances. I'd say the difference so far in the score is due to lack of experience on Shapo's part because his game has been excellent.
If I understand correctly what you mean then you can just use Nova Launcher: you make a different setup on each page, and then on the home page you add as many "Nova Actions > Jump to page" buttons as you need to navigate directly. 
Italian here, we're all sick of Fabio's bullshit. However I doubt any complaint was filed, I'd say the media frenzy had the USO officials look into it and take it seriously. His words were really harsh and his apology half baked (he even says "I was mostly right in complaining and this is just a tennis match lol") so the default is deserved. It would be great to see the Italian tennis federation take action too but there's just no way they'll dare touch him.
Excited about Delpo, RBA is so tough to beat but the matchup should make for an entertaining encounter. I feel like a win here for Delpo could be very important for the rest of his season.
That fly on the camera on match point Zhang stole her momentum!
Impressive comeback from Thiem, I was positive Mannarino had this set in the bag. Now Domi should get the job done.
Mannarino playing great! Just destroyed the ball with a wonderful dtl FH just above the net post.

Diciamo che l'impressione che ho avuto è che la questione del rispetto sia molto generazionale: quelli che sembrano averne meno mi sono sembrati quelli in età 20-50 che vivono all'estero e tornano solo d'estate, molti di quelli che ho conosciuto sembra siano un po' disillusi sullo stato delle cose e un po' se ne freghino, un po' si comportino in modo "spaccone" per posa. Spero che le nuove generazioni si sentiranno meno "tradite" da un paese che ha "obbligato" quella precedente ad emigrare per campare e cambino certe mentalità, perchè sicuramente il potenziale per stare bene c'è tutto. (Baso tutti sti ragionamenti su esperienze ed opinioni personali quindi ci sta che non abbia compreso tutto al meglio).
Io sono stato l'estate scorsa per una settimana e sono rimasto molto deluso. I posti sono bellissimi - come potrebbe essere altrimenti visto che sta tra due paradisi come Grecia e Croazia? - ma le strade sono un vero incubo e i centri abitati completamente in preda ad abusivismo edilizio e pessima gestione dei servizi. I locali hanno pochissimo rispetto di ciò che è pubblico, addirittura in una località protetta Unesco come Argirocastro ho visto un ragazzino svuotare un bidone della spazzatura giù per il pendio di fronte alla (magnifica) fortezza, e nelle città è comune vedere persone che gettano rifiuti direttamente per terra. 

Di buono c'è che gli Albanesi sono molto simpatici e ci tengono a far divertire gli stranieri, anche se non c'è moltissimo da fare. I prezzi sono sicuramente bassi ma a mio modo di vedere se l'Albania vuole prendere sul serio il turismo deve risolvere parecchi problemi. Prima che pensiate "ah ecco il solito fighetto che deve avere tutto come a casa o non si adatta", faccio da 10 anni le vacanze in Europa centrale/ Balcani, spesso con gente del luogo e con mezzi di fortuna, quindi sicuramente apprezzo l'ambiente un po' rustico ma in Albania mi sono sentito spesso poco a mio agio. 

Edit: chi volesse farsi una vacanza low-cost rimanendo in zona Bosnia, Montenegro e Serbia offrono molto di più sia a livello di attività (festival, attrazioni etc.) che di infrastrutture/servizi (ostelli, autobus), pur restando esperienze genuine (Montenegro meno perchè d'estate molte località si riempiono di tamarri belgradesi, russi e chi più ne ha più ne metta). 
I like Čorić too, it's a shame of all the youngsters he's the one yet to have a proper breakthrough tournament. I hope he can seize this chance, 4th round would be a great result anyway for either Italian.
Se avesse insegnato nella mia avrebbero dovuto raddoppiare il numero di forze dell'ordine in città per stare dietro a tutte le chiamate.
> Se le FFOO ti interrogassero su questi episodi, difenderesti la tua opinione oppure faresti come altri in passato dimettendoti e cambiando paese?

Capitato ad un docente del mio liceo, insegnava da me al "ritorno" dal paese d'esilio. Beh, all'epoca della mia maturità lui conviveva con una che faceva 4a. Non so le faccende giudiziarie del primo caso come andarono.
Second Italian derby of the tournament, can't believe one of Fabbiano and Lorenzi will have a 4th USO round under their belt. I hope Paolone goes through for the incredible hard work he's been putting in over his career, but somehow I feel Fabbiano would stand a better chance against both Coric and Anderson.
> Why not have a losers bracket so that losers can compete to reach the final even after losing to someone clearly redlining?

Because then you would have good players tanking just to get into the loser's brackets in the hope they get an easier opponent. It would be chaotic and it would decrease the level of competition, not to mention the scheduling is challenging enough as it is.
Se la federazione avesse un minimo di palle lo manderebbe 3 mesi a fare da hitting partner ai campi allenamento per le ragazzine. Adoro il Fogna talento tennistico, il Fogna uomo ha proprio rotto le palle.
Since everybody's in the mood for some vulgar Italian expressions lately, in our language it is a common saying "to do things the dog dick's way" ("a cazzo di cane"). It means to do something in a scrappy, half-ass way without caring much about the outcome.
Nah, the old ones are always the most effective.
Hate to make this comment as an Italian the day we're bashing Fognini for being sexist, but the ump in the Federer-Youzhny game is a total babe.
Rublev got game but his on court demeanor is questionable at best.
The ump goes with whatever word pops up. I guess the reason is that the system can correctly call the ball but the software rendering that gets shown onscreen - which is there solely for entertaining purposes anyway - messes up once in a while.
He would not. In Italian we insult men and women differently. We have an inherently and weirdly sexist culture.
The X Compact has a 2700 mAh battery and comfortably lasts over 24 hours with almost 5 SOT (I sometimes charge mine before bedtime on day 1 and then again in the morning on day 3). Considering the gap in specs, I'm not actually sure the XZ1c will fare this well and I'd definitely be concerned about the regular XZ1 making it through a whole day of heavy usage.
No problem! We're all friends here and foreign languages are tough to fully understand.
He wouldn't. To insult men in Italian you use "frocio" (faggot) or "figlio di puttana" (son of a whore). "Testa di cazzo" (dickhead) or "coglione" (moron) are not perceived as that offensive, and certainly not as much as calling a woman "troia" to her face. 

So basically in Italian you can either insult a woman by being sexist towards women (troia) or insult a man by being sexist against women by proxy (figlio di puttana). That tells you a couple things about our mentality and the motives behind Fabio's words.
Kinda, "Troia" can only be female. It's like the ultimate super-insult to deeply offend a woman, it's not just about saying they're promiscuous.
I see what you mean about "slut", but trust me when I say that in Italian "troia" is an infinitely more sexist. It is a much deeper offense to a woman than slut is in English (I'm fluent and have lived a few years in English-speaking countries so I'm totally familiar with these insults). "Troia" doesn't refer to just being promiscuous, it means worthless, mean and disgusting *due to the fact* that they're a woman. Any Italian speaker (who isn't sexist themselves, and trust me when I say unfortunately we do know a couple of things about it) wouldn't have to do a double take to recognise Fognini's slurs as sexist.
In Italian it's much different. Most words have a male and a female version, however there are some words that only work for either. "Troia" only means "female slut", just like "frocio" means "male homosexual" (similar to "faggot" in those regards). His words are 100% sexist.
Italian speaker here, his words are definitely sexist. His words definitely come off as something very degrading for a woman, "cocksucking whore" could be directed at either gender while "troia pompinara" is specifically directed at women (there is no male equivalent of "troia" and even the male equivalent of "pompinara" sounds odd in Italian). This is something you typically say when you want to express your disdain with someone for being a woman, on the assumption that all women denying you what you want are in fact worthy of being degraded.

I doubt he'll get a ban a but a fine should definitely be issued; if the Italian Tennis Federation had any balls whatsoever they would keep him out of the next Davis Cup tie but they won't do jack shit. Let's not forget he did all this while playing against a fellow Italian who could perfectly understand, disrespecting him (and everyone else) too.
I remember when we sacked Ranieri he went on a bit of a tirade against Secco (can't believe he was ever our director), sustaining that it was him who cockblocked Alonso from joining and then threw Claudio to the dogs by having him tell the press they did not get Alonso because "he's too slow" and friggin' Poulsen fit our system better.
I have an X Compact and the quiet speakers are really the only disappointing feature of the phone. If tey fixed that, these new phones are gonna be ace.
