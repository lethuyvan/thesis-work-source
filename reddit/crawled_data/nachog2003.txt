I remembered today you can change your characters walking style.
Good luck hacking money in Xbox.
If you're on PC I can let you test it along with any other vehicle you want.
Wouldn't recommend the G430s. Really uncomfortable plus even EarPods sound better.
Splice the cable or if you want an upgrade, cheap headphones with clip on mic or better yet good headphones and a ModMic.
Was this taken from /r/fortnitebr? Saw a comment that said this yesterday.
I prefer AMD due to future proofing, but if you have money for a new motherboard when upgrading you might want to go Intel as it's usually better for gaming.
That doesn't mean shit. Same as warranty stickers.

~~Please don't.~~

EDIT: I actually like mine, especially it's camera, but honestly battery life sucks and sometimes it lags to the point where it is unusable. Might be better off with a Pixel or something.
Can I get a PM too if you don't mind?
Just format the old computer if you don't have important data on there, but don't stick the boot drive onto the PC if it's booted into Windows.
Worked on my mom, laughed my ass off.
Do they also use the $ sign? Argentinian pesos amount to 19 US dollars.
if it has three fans they'll just push up on the GPU preventing it from sagging ^^^obv ^^^/s
395 Mexican pesos amounts to 21 US dollars, doesn't seem to likely.
He was selling abandonware (piracy but imo ethical as you can't buy it otherwise) and Wii emulator installing for 100 bucks.
Different video cable right?
Happy envelope day!
Yet you can see your Avenger/MOC or PV disappear if you hit send back on the Avenger/MOC or store in the MC menu
I think Pariah seconded by 811.
TKL or 60% + USB numpad (if you want to be fancy a Ducky Pocket is perfect, it's also a calculator so you can annoy your classmates in maths class with MX Blue switches)
Body properties would be awesome to have, just like in SA.
I'd love to have pets, and it would be really cool if you could create your own pet's a appearance, albeit unrealistic.
Maybe putting an extra leg in the middle would work?
For SA try out San Andreas Downgrader and install WidescreenFix, SilentPatch and GInput
LCS is already on mobile, and I guess you could use PPSSPP for VCS
It changed to YouTube Vanced, and casting works great both to YouTube.com/tv and a custom app on my Fire TV stick.
They changed the name of atleast three things in 2018. Android Wear > Wear OS, Android Pay > Google Pay and now YouTube Red > YouTube Premium.
679 ~~Kerbal Space Program or Crazy Machines 3 if possible~~. Thank you!

EDIT: Ended up buying Humble Monthly so I have no need for those games anymore. Thanks!
679, Crazy Machines 3 if possible. Thank you!.
Oh fuck, my dad showed it to me on Facebook, guess they copied it from /r/showerthoughts. Sorry
I agree on it being laggy, but honestly I love the camera.
Go as fast as you can, and on the first left turn, go up the ramp and onto the small building. Then get on top of the train when it comes.

If it's good customer service they might repair it if it's only a month over. Don't have any experience with Samsung support, but I've seen other brands do it.
45€ is insanely tempting. Kinda want to get one for my second mechanical keyboard.
I mean I forgot my TV uses lighter passive glasses, I think other ones use active glasses that use batteries.

Vat19 might just be a database of videos to post here lmao
Isn't there a clip that clips over your glasses? We have an LG 2012 3DTV and it came with one along with the Dual Play and 3D glasses.
I have glasses that have some magnets and a sunglasses clip that goes over it. Mine don't have replacements if you lose it but there's another brand that does give you replacements and 2 clips of your choice, Downside is the covering on the clip magnets scratches off after the first couple of days and starts to leave some white marks on the glasses, but imo it's worth it.
I think it's Sniper 3D. My dad plays it and it seems like fun.

Just download NewPipe. Copying and pasting every video you want to watch would be a bit of a pain.
I think I might beat GTA IV again but on PC, howewer my CPU cooler is broken and my CPU heats up to like 60-70 degrees playing GTA V, so I think it might actually shutoff if I play GTA IV due to the shit PC port. Honestly I tend to prefer going on murder sprees on GTA O,  it has absurd vehicles to kill people on like the Oppressor and the Deluxo and the map is bigger.
I beat GTA SA for the first time yesterday, loved the game and its storyline. Surprisingly little effort to make it work with Windows 10 and ultrawide monitors using San Andreas Downgrader.
Just drive the Raptor backwards.
I wonder if we'll get a version of GTA IV on mobile next year or so. Honestly I don't know if mobile can handle the ragdoll mechanics in the RAGE engine, but it'd be really cool if it was possible.
On my S7 edge I could feel it after about a minute and a half to two minutes. Did drain my battery from 23% to 21% in that time span though.
I'm about to beat GTA SA for the first time (99th mission, also first GTA beaten without cheats) and I'm pretty excited.

You could solder in new switches for the broken keys, which will probably cost about 11$ or less in switches.

I've always heard it's because 9/11 happened when the game was about to be released, and they changed a whole bunch of stuff.
Minecraft Battle Royale.

You can sue anyone for breathing. You're definitely not gonna win (unless the judge hates you I guess) but you still can sue them.

Luckily the format option opens a window where you can choose file system, label, or fast format.
Do you care about gaming on the go? Build a nice desktop and stream games to your laptop using Steam IHS (If you're on the go you can also use Parsec, and it also gives the nice bonus of being able to access the desktop.)

For me it's key shortcuts for my Ducky keyboard that I have to look up often, Logitech G for my G203 mouse (BTW this mouse is great for the 30€ it costs) and a button for the case lights because budget.
Well first off, BIOS is pretty much locked down or something else, since even if you try to boot into a LIVEUSB it just says fuck you and boots back into Windows. Secondly, it's locked to 32 bit even though it's a 64 bit processor, which I don't understand. I haven't tried installing Ubuntu, but the guides say a lot if things don't work like multi-touch on both the touchscreen and trackpad, hardware buttons, suspend or brightness. Even reinstalling Windows 10 was a PITA, stock Asus audio drivers didn't work so I had to use some Atom Thinkpad tablet one.
I used to think 9/11 was faked and was done by the US government.   
Honestly I was a pretty fucking big idiot.

Thanks.
Just pull the HDD from your PC and connect it to your phone, duh.
I use Windows on my gaming PC because of compatibility, but on my 2 in 1 I can't install Linux without having half of the things not working, and I can't even install it without getting a custom .iso file.
ThinkPad T4/540p or T4/550p. Try to get one with the beefier CPU (not the U). Around 400 or 500 bucks on eBay.
It literally says press Del or F2
I mean, not to burst your bubble, but unless you really need all that CPU power I'd have gone with a Ryzen 7 and a 1080ti instead of Ryzen TR with a 1080.
There's the Raiden which is a Model S and the Voltic which is the 2008 Roadster, but I'm not sure if it's that exact one.
I just finished reading Matilda by Roald Dahl and I loved it, are there any similar books to it?
That'd be an operation picture lol
I stripped the screw holes when I took out the fan so. I. could clean the heatsink.
Oh my god that would feel so wrong to type. I've been accustomed to type something like "championship game LeBron scores all points" typing out that entire thing would feel insanely wrong.
Did that already, no luck.
Lol it's not an aftermarket one. It's a Zalman CNPS 10X with its fan held on by zip ties in the screw holes and the fan bearing probably fucked up. Replacing with a Cryorig H7 soon™.
Do you have a desktop PC? Try to get a cheap HDD and add it to your PC, then stream the porn to your phone with Plex (as I assume you watch porn only at home). A new 1TB HDD costs about 40 dollars, but you might be able to get a ~300 GB laptop drive for about 10 bucks if you're willing to risk a drive death and losing the files.
It's an M5A78L-M LE/USB3. Can/should I still overclock that? If I can overclock it it would be pretty sweet. Upgrading would be pricy as not only can I not carry over the motherboard I can't carry the RAM over either, which is at least 80 bucks with current pricing.
https://i.imgur.com/CEkbCJn.png
My birthday is on June 15, so I might get a 2400. In the meantime I'm replacing my current cooler with a Cryorig H7 as my current one is dying (look at my last post). I've got a shit motherboard with my 8320 so I can't overclock unfortunately.
Holy fuck it's a time traveler
On a side note, does anyone know a decent high pressure fan I could attach to my heatsink? I suppose it's the problem as it makes a fast rattling like sound sometimes.
It bottlenecks it a bit. I've been looking at upgrading to a Ryzen 5 1400 or a 2nd gen one, but for now this suits me fine.
Lmao what the fuck is wrong with people
Soldered CPU.
Well I guess this would be a nude on AMD chips as they're soldered?
Boot up in safe mode and uninstall AMD Boost. Overclock only through BIOS.
Happy cake day!
>Accidentally
Completely agree. Thing is absolutely wonderful. Also I used to hate using batteries but it has a smart standby mode so they last months on a charge. It's also incredibly versatile, so it also works amazingly as an HTPC controller.
You can set the mouse to do it and it shows a little cursor on the radar. Otherwise I just rebind it to IJKL as I've got a TKL board.

Maybe you can use it for Nvidia GameStream while running games on the 56.
Good luck! Spanish is my native language so if you don't understand something you're free to PM me.
Longstrike uses a reverse plunger system, which absolutely sucks ass and has now been completely replaced with the much better direct plunger system (which your Nite Finder uses). BTW, if you want a great sniper rifle look into the Longshot or the TriStrike if you don't want to mod. Also your Nite Finder can be modded to hell and back to make it great. I have a Sonic (green translucent) one that I bought in like 2015 and with a spring swap it shoots farther than my Elite ones.
Nerf and Buzz Bee for blasters and Chinese darts like Little Valentine or Koosh.

It literally takes a screenshot of the viewfinder on your phone's display when you take a photo instead of using the camera API that was literally designed to do that. Basically they tried to fix a problem that wasn't even there in the first place.
Option too.
ITT: People loving the watermark
Love the watermark but I feel like this can be easily removed. You didn't watermark the island on the big map. He could take the map from the big one and paste a non watermarked original map on top of the watermarked one.
Agreed. Mine seemed like a good idea 2 years ago. It wasn't. Hopefully replacing with a ThinkPad.
Asus T100? I absolutely hate mine. Laggy as fuck, same charger problem and can't even install Linux without half of the things working. Gonna replace it with a ThinkPad hopefully soon.
I wonder if you can do that to a PS4. Mine is loud as fuck even after I spent a day disassembling it to replace the thermal paste and clean out all the dust inside.
I do that sometimes and I don't understand it either.
Next time try using the prongs of a binder clip. Just squeeze it to take them off the binder clip to put it where the original one went.

Is it possible to mod a Nvidia card to allow FreeSync?
If the rest of the phone works good send it back to Samsung. It's like 60 bucks for a battery replacement IIRC.
You don't have a motherboard. Anyway the RAM isn't compatible and those parts are pretty bad anyway, you could get a much better PC for the price especially with the new Ryzen APUs.
Post the link to the original with timestamps and make a post saying it's you. I'm not believing you otherwise.
What's your budget? Some people here will be able to give you a pretty good part list.
Honestly that looks amazing but I'd hate to play it.
Mostly GTA San Andreas and GTA V streamed from my gaming PC so I guess it's fine, but I'd like to play Fortnite too in the future. I guess I could use my PS4 controller for Fortnite and the IPEGA controller for everything else. Thanks for the help.
Violating TOS.
Post it on /r/insanepeoplefacebook, they'll probably like it.
Thoughts on IPEGA controllers? I've been thinking of getting a 9023 or a 9025 since my PS4 controller clip broke.
It got shut down by Discord.
If you want a cheaper Android TV replacement there's also the Xiaomi Mi Box, FYI
I think the only post I can upvote there is the pinned doggo.
Well it must've hated it's own taste since it's the default one.
Phone suicide. My watch threw itself off the table once when the alarm sounded while it was charging.
Idk 180 doesn't seem to expensive for a metal mechanical keyboard. Mine was 130 and while it does have RGB and Cherry switches it's still made entirely of ABS including the keycaps.
Install Nova Launcher. First thing I do when I get a new phone.
Idk if it's an extremely shitty mic and voice recognition software I guess it could happen. But you'd probably have to have the camera open for that.
I want to get a trampoline but then I'll have to focus on not intentionally killing myself by jumpimg over the 2 meter wall that leads to a big fall.
Pretty sure you could mod it with a cheap Raspberry Pi and screen, you could have digital games, a cheaper screen and you could put a battery inside for portable play. Maybe could even fit a mini controller holder in the cartridge slot, but I'm not sure how big an NES is.
If my monitor was a bottleneck I'd underclock my card to make it quieter and cooler. You could also tell them to go fuck themselves, you can underclock a card if you wanted to and you shouldn't need to explain why.

Hey OP, not interested for a code as I got one in the launch giveaway but I want to say your game is insanely fun.

By the way, are there any plans for an Android version? I'd totally pay full price if I could play it on the go.
Off topic but your game seems really fun, I'm a big fan of Marble Skies and your game looks like a pretty cool similar game. Congrats on getting that asshole's review removed.
Then why fucking break it and actually waste the money? He could've returned it, which is still dumb, and get the 16 dollars back. Does he have anger issues?
Use a pen or buy a slightly better pencil maybe? Or maybe you could try something to be able to get the Rotring again. Do you have some cash to get a prepaid card and somewhere to get it delivered to that's not your house like an Amazon locker or a friend's house? Get a prepaid card and have it secretly delivered to that place, and hide it somewhere your parents can't find it or keep it at that friends house. Next time you're at class, hide the pencil somewhere (in a locker if you have one or have your best friend give it to you every day) and use it only in class, making sure your dad doesn't know.

Good luck, hope your dad doesn't find out if you actually do that.
Keep getting those 50c pencils and keep breaking them intentionally after a few days, maybe bend the lead sleeve ever so slightly or snap the spring, after enough pencils he might let you buy a more expensive one. Or just buy the absolute worst pencil you can find that has things like extreme lead wobble or loose lead.

Not being able to spend your own money is infuriating, I got bad grades in school this trimester and my parent's won't let me get a ThinkPad with my own money until I do better.
You're on the wrong subreddit then, go to /r/pcmasterrace. I'd rather play on PC too but I don't want to spend 30 bucks on it, plus I prefer Fortnite anyway.
Sure, because everyone has a >600$ PC available to play PUBG on and it's also possible to bring it in your pocket.

Nope, didn't work. No worries though, warranty request got approved and I'm in the process of packing it up.

I think these are the oldest games in my library, but most recent games support ultrawide monitors.
That's why you buy RGB, then you get all three. 
Most games I've played support ultrawide, even going as far back to Portal or GTA IV, most support 2560x1080.

They're not paralyzed, they have to sit in their chair unless they want to pay >500 bucks for a PC with current GPU prices, unless you want one with an AMD APU, which I'm not sure how well will run, plus 30 bucks for PUBG. PUBG mobile is free as long as you have a decent smartphone.
My router is quite warm when you touch it, and it was charging right there, but when I took it off it worked fine, and the router doesn't really warm up the surrounding surface.

Holy fucking shit (pun not intended) he's gonna be needing a poop machete.
I've also had display issues on my OG Pebble (tearing), happened two times so they upgraded me to a Pebble Time for free, which was nice. Not lucky with watch displays it seems. I overslept in the morning and saw my watch on the floor due to it commiting suicide with the alarm, thought it was a broken screen but it actually looks more like burn in, doubt the fall had anything to do.

UPDATE: Warranty request approved. Says original accessories have to be intact, but my watchband is ripped. Not sure if it'll. Be a problem.
Thanks!
Yeah. My S7 uses an OLED screen, I had one before where like 60% of the screen was brighter due to watching YouTube a lot (I assume, since the line was right where the video/comments line is in portrait).
I don't have a pussy but [here's a sleeping naked bitch.](https://imgur.com/k1X96VC)
I highly doubt that's going to fix it, if I actually run it and it fixes it I'll eat the watchband.
How much time did it take to arrive to your country? I have a spare Pebble Time I can use for the time being luckily.
Something pretty similar happened to me today, was it covered by warranty?

User:[3/24/18 12:32:25 PM] https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/86q5lj/032318_gta_online_ban_wave_what_we_know_so_far/ Myself and numerous other players were banned last night for what seems like a problem on Rockstar's end. The support team on twitter have been deliberately ignoring the issue and my ticket concerning this was closed. When will we get a response from the company about what has happened?

Agent:[3/24/18 12:32:25 PM]One moment while we connect you.

Agent:[3/24/18 12:33:41 PM]Hello, thank you for contacting Rockstar Support. My name is XXXXX, I see that you got banned in GTA Online and you are concerned regarding this. Is that correct?

User:[3/24/18 12:34:33 PM]Hi! I'm concerned since I believe there must be a problem within the game causing these bans and I wanted to make sure the company were aware.

User:[3/24/18 12:35:25 PM]Twitter, Reddit and the Rockstar forums are flooding with what seem to be honest individuals (mostly PC players) who have recieved bans after the latest updates.

Agent:[3/24/18 12:35:28 PM]Thank you for confirming, I'll be glad to clarify your concern regarding this. I would like to inform you that, the GTA Online banned decisions are final and cannot be appealed.

User:[3/24/18 12:36:52 PM]Can you confirm to me that like other other false ban situations Rockstar will be able to restore characters and unban accounts once the problem is resolved?

User:[3/24/18 12:37:13 PM]https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/200063373-Grand-Theft-Auto-Online

User:[3/24/18 12:38:45 PM]And do you have any information as to why there are this many complainants on the forum this morning, compared to usual. I understand the policy behind unappealable bans, but at the end of the day I'm just a concerned fan with a lot of time and effort on the line, who's been trying to work out why so many players have been banned.

Agent:[3/24/18 12:38:48 PM]To keep the gameplay environment as fair as possible for legitimate players, the system routinely do sweeps to separate out cheaters and modders, and to reverse any illegitimate transactions.

User:[3/24/18 12:40:03 PM]There are players who have been banned whilst still on the tutorial missiont, who have owned the game for less than a few hours. I do not believe the majority of these people have cheated, and I know for certain that I have not.

Agent:[3/24/18 12:42:09 PM]Well, that will be taken care by the system itself. These bans are triggered by the system, designed in such a way that we don't get any option to make any changes from our end.

User:[3/24/18 12:43:19 PM]Is there a threshold for which Rockstar will investigate this latest ban wave to check whether a mistake has been made?

Agent:[3/24/18 12:46:18 PM]Well, I cannot assure you that. If there's any mistake in sweeps, it should fix it by itself otherwise these bans decisions are final. For more information, please see here: https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/articles/229514247

User:[3/24/18 12:48:09 PM]Thanks for your help, one last question. Is it policy to make a statement in the case of a false ban situation, and if the bans are overturned by the system itself, will the deleted character data be restored?

Agent:[3/24/18 12:54:46 PM]Sure! I would like to inform you that, the system does not gives a false ban to any account.

Agent:[3/24/18 12:56:02 PM]If it does, it restores the account the very next time when it bans the account. It only happened for once which was fixed by our developers.

User:[3/24/18 12:56:51 PM]Judging by whats happening online, I imagine that it will be happening again soon. Thanks a lot

Agent:[3/24/18 12:59:09 PM]You're welcome! I really appreciate you for understanding my situation, Thanks!

What laptop is it? What processor does it have? What are your use cases? You could put an SSD on that laptop and make it a lot faster. You can get a 256GB one and install it, it can be easy to install depending on your laptop, but you could take it to a store and get it installed for about 20 or 30 bucks.
You all know that the iPhone doesn't take SD cards.
Luckily it has an SD card slot, unlike the iPhone, and on launch I think they gave out 256GB microSDs.

Oh for fucks sake. I have a paper which I have to give to the teacher so they can sign it and write how I did in class. My maths teacher told us to do an exercise, which was replace X and Y in an equation to make it correct, so I put two random numbers in there that were correct. I show the paper to the teacher and she has the fucking audacity to say I copied it from my classmate and to say how I solved it. I said I just put random numbers that were correct and she still writes I did badly. What the fuck?

Shine are the full-size keyboards, One are the TKL keyboards and Mini is a 60% but bigger. I don't think this is a Ducky unless they came out with a new board. Not the point of this but I would recommend their keyboards. I have a One RGB and it's great.

I've started booting into a LiveUSB and using Rainway or Parsec to stream games from my gaming PC. Works pretty good. Once got scolded for booting into a LiveUSB and turning off the PC using the power button.
At my school if they see it in class with a teacher they'll just take it and give it at the end of the class and maybe you get sent to the principal's office, and in hallways they'll say to put it in your pocket, but you can just take it out afterwards and nothing happens, and in breaks it's allowed.

When I got it it was pretty bad, but it's just really versatile and quite a bit more precise so I can't go back to a PS4 one. It connects via the Steam Controller dongle, which makes input lag really small and makes it support 16 controllers per dongle. Steam Machines and the Steam Link both have the dongle built in, so that's a plus since you can leave the dongle plugged in to your PC and switch back and forth.. Main use for it is as a remote for my PC, where it works great due to Steam desktop support and keyboard, but I also use it for games more than my PS4 controller.
Steam Controller for me imo.

When you need to fasten something in a PC either use zipties or duct tape. I stripped the screw holes on my CPU cooler and I just attached the fan on with zipties. Should probably try tightening it more since it's getting hot.

Yeah! Enjoy it and welcome to the PCMR! You might want to upgrade that GPU though when prices come down, I have a 1060 3gb and while it's pretty good it's getting a little bit outdated.
Yeah, Alienware is trash for desktops. That PC isn't worth over 600$ in parts. Either way the CPU and GPU are imbalance, but it won't matter much, and you won't do any better with current GPU prices.
How much are both? Just for shits and giggles, the one in the OP is better.

Damn I didn't know LEGO sets were that expensive. I'd love to get one since I love space but it's pricy. Would love if a Falcon Heavy one existed.
Uhh, minimize BP, open up Netflix on Edge for that sweet 1080p and view it? You can control the desktop with a controller, and it works especially well with the Steam Controller's touchpads. You could also add Kodi as a non steam game and use that to view whatever you want, it has great controller support.

I agree console gives the best couch experience overall, but I'd gladly take PC over console even if it's a slight inconvenience (it's not that bad)
I'd gladly take a notch over a bezel, but that home button implementation looks annoying. With a normal phone like the S8/S9 you can't get an almost full screen view on apps without hiding your notification bar (and you still have the chin). With the iPhone X, you get a full screen view except for the top bar with the notch and notification bar, so you get the most content to body ratio.
It took me ahout 5 hours to change a PSU and do cable management and like 30 minutes to change out RAM because I thought I was going to break the mobo because of the force it took. Now that I know how I could probably do the PSU in like 1 or 2 hours and the RAM in 10 minutes.
Good luck to your dog. I hope she's ok.
Just set up Big Picture on startup and hook up your controller of choice. Is it really that hard? If your PC is in a different room hook up a Steam Link, they're pretty cheap on sale. I do it a lot with my Steam Controller.
Tried out Circles. Game seemed pretty cool but I don't think it's my style. Thanks for the giveaway OP.
I'm still impressed by my S7's camera. Took a lot of photos of my cousin with my dog with Google Camera's portrait mode and it looks great (and even better if I tap the auto adjust button on Google Photos).
They had Nest products before (and still have them on my country's Amazon). They released their own cameras now and banned all Nest products from their store.
If I had one I would just go ahead and root it and flash Google Apps on it including YouTube. Fuck them.
Me three thanks
Spotify Dogfood is down and if you use it your account is apparently in danger of being terminated. Lucky Patcher has a patch that does the same so I'd replace it with that.
Wasn't AMD lending out some cheapo AM4 APU in order to upgrade the BIOS? Might be a bit of a hassle, but I think you might be able to check with the retailer to see if they're updated.
I used to do that before I discovered Dogfood and other modded apks. Too tedious and you don't get your playlists or daily mixes
Here's what I've done for now, change the case or something else, if you want to, if.you want I'll help find one.

It'd be cool to replace your leg below the knee with bionic replacements if they had feeling and didn't have phantom pain. You could adjust your height and even walk on the stumps, you wouldn't need to clip your nails, you could change to these spring loaded feet things to run fast like a kangaroo, you could go everywhere barefoot. Not to mention it'd look pretty fucking cool.
I don't know why but I'm curious on what dog meat tastes like, but I love my pup (and all dogs) too much to eat an animal like her, especially when they torture and beat the dogs because they think it makes the meat taste better.
Honestly I actually like the notch. I'd rather have the two screen gaps on the side as a status bar rather than a full bezel, like the LG V10/20 second screens.

Ffs I'm browsing Reddit in the car and couldn't tell if this had 9 or -9 points. This is why I hate hyphens at the end of usernames.
Why Razer though? They're pretty bad for the price. You can get a pretty good white mechanical keyboard, a white mouse (my G203 is great, pretty much equal sensor to a G502 and all those high end mice, and you can get it for 30€ and I think in white, if not G Pro is a great choice) and some white headphones and mic.
I lost my 64GB one a few days ago and I'm still mad at myself for it. It didn't even have data since I used it to reinstall Windows.
It also heats up your house.
Is the PC upside down?
Oh, TIL. ShareX is pretty much that plus you can remap it to PrintScreen and you can blur, draw arrows, lines or edit it right before cropping and upload to Imgur, Google Drive, Dropbox and another sites which I can't remember.
I think he meant MS Paint to draw some arrows and shit. Anyway I like ShareX way better than snipping tool, just recommending it if anyone cares.
[Imgur mirror](https://imgur.com/Lz5iSwo) because fuck sites that require you to go to another site to view it.
Idk if it is the same version, but it doesn't work on Windows 10 edition or whatever it's called now.
Lol this happened to me after my cousin threw an impact grenade at me and threw me off a huge ramp, thought I got banned for something related to that.
Lol servers are just down, got that too on PlayStation.
Unfortunately yeah. I think I'm gonna adopt a 2 month old Border Collie instead.

If I were you I'd put a cheap IKEA leg on the middle of the desk to reduce desk sag.

Now mod the mouse internals to have a really nice sensor. G203 or G403 seem like good choices as they're not expensive.
That looks like the opposite of a problem.

Adhell for Samsung users and AdAway for rooted. No VPN needed.
I haven't tried 144fps on a 144hz display (my 1060 couldn't handle it anyway), but my main monitor is 75hz and I can say I notice a difference. It's not huge, but it's noticeable. You start to see no difference at above 240 hz.
"better online" I had many problems with my PS4's internet both in games and parties, plus I get way better speeds on my PC than on my PS4 for some reason.

"more players" PSN Plus has 26 million subscribers, Steam has 18.5 million active users. Still more, but you probably won't notice it unless you're playing an extremely uncommon game.

"free games" Can you really call them free if you're paying 8€ a month? PC also has free games, which can be proved if you go to /r/GameDeals and search for free or going to the free games channel on the PCMR Discord.

"brand new games at almost half off" That's a good point since physical discs can be cheap, but Steam has some pretty good sales on Summer, Winter, Thanksgiving, Halloween and Autumn.

"good service all around" I haven't had experience with support on either PSN or Steam, so I won't try to counter this argument.
Lol you don't need to keep upgrading and edit registries to make games work (plus you don't even use notepad to edit registry)

I'm pretty sure the PS3 didn't run games perfectly in 2015/16. PS4 doesn't even run games perfectly now. 

If a game has a problem most of the time you just Google the problem and you get a fix. I'd gladly have to occasionally play around to fix a problem than pay 8 bucks a month for PS+

I broke the threads on my CPU heatsink recently and held the fan on using zipties through the screw holes. Works perfectly.
It didn't before, they updated it to look better and get 60fps.
I don't know why, but it runs better on my PS4 than on my PC. Stutters a lot with my 1060 and FX8320, which should be better than the PS4.

I use Spotify mainly for convenience, but I like foobar2000 as a player.
I'm still running some G430s. I've noticed EarPods sound better than them, but they don't work with a PS4 due to the different jack pinout.

Headsets come with mic, what you're looking for is headphones. /r/headphones can help you with that, they have a headphone recommendation guide on the sidebar. Some good ones for 40 bucks is the Superlux HD681 EVOs.
Taken with a Galaxy S7 edge with Google Camera's portrait mode. It's been almost 2 years since this phone was released and I'm still impressed by its camera sometimes.

Dog's name is Pistacho, he's a 5 year old APBT (according to the shelter, but he looks more like a Staffy). If it weren't for the potentially dangerous dogs license I'd adopt him in a heartbeat.
If it worked perfectly before just solder the cable. It might not look pretty, but it'll work, and if you want you can make a Paracord braid or something.
Eh, they're probably not really strong for it to do anything.
Instead of a gaming headset get some good headphones and a separate mic.
I was playing with a hot wheels car once when I was little and I checked of I could run the car on the stove plates by touching them since I didn't want to ruin the car. 

Also checked if a car lighter worked by touching it. Got some pretty good circles on my finger.

They're 100 and 170, of course they aren't going to be a 1050ti killer. The 100 dollar one is worse than the 1030 and the 170 dollar one about matches it from benchmarks I've seen.
My dad has been running an Xperia Z2 since 2014 until he upgraded to an XZ Premium late 2017. Apart from battery life and a soldered and irreplaceable microUSB port it still runs great and lives on a PS4 controller clamp for playing games and streaming games from my PC or PS4 (as my S7 doesn't support PS4 controllers).

My mom had an HTC One M8 since September 2014 and upgraded in September 2016 to a Huawei Mate 9 due to poor battery life. Loaded LineageOS 14.1 on it and it runs really good apart from the battery life which seems a bit difficult to replace.

Might replace the battery on one (or both) of those to revive them.
> LineageOS 14.1

TFW a phone from 2011 has a higher version of Android than your 2016 flagship.

I had an S2 I got from my dad when he upgraded to an S4 when I was smaller. Unfortunately killed it once trying to position the tab inside the microUSB connector with a metal needle to fix loose connectors.

Pretty good, as Steam has native support, but unlike the Steam Controller you need to repair every time you change device.
Nice, can it display 120fps with the 120Hz display?
Aliexpress one.
Search PS4 Smart Clip on Aliexpress.
Aliexpress or Amazon
Doesn't work with my main phone, an S7 edge which is why I use the Z2
I can try with my iPod Touch if you want.
Both PC and PS4 with ethernet but unfortunately connected to a network switch limited to 100Mbps so I don't get the full 500 Mbps

Not having to open a window or turn on a fan in your room because your PC heats it.
I just realized the Planck mechanical keyboard is called that because it's really small compared to a normal one.
PS4 controllers work with a lot of Android devices. Except my S7, where I think Samsung disabled connection to it to sell their own shit GearVR controller, so only the new DS4 works.
Sometimes. I get about 150Mbps on WiFi near the router so it works pretty damn good.
It's pretty occasional, and if your PC is connected via Ethernet and your phone to a 5Ghz Network it'll work really good.
I got [this one](http://s.aliexpress.com/UjmqEjyi), but just look up Nyko Smart Clip or PS4 Smart Clip on AliExpress/Amazon and you'll get many.
For PS4 yes, and it also works pretty good, but for PC you need Moonlight.
Really good. Better than Steam IHS on my laptop, but overall I'd rather use my Steam Link if the TV is free.
I can't really notice it, but sometimes it loses connection and stutters or gets graphical errors.
I got a 29 inch one on Prime Day last year. I absolutely love it.
Go to data usage and click the cog at the upper right. Should let you change it.
M8 is great. Loaded my moms one with LineageOS after she upgraded and it runs great. Apart from battery life and low storage it's still pretty good.
I like to do a really simple one with a Pilot G2 and a Bic Cristal when I'm bored. 

What you do is disassemble the G2, take out the button assembly and spring with the cartridge and put the spring between both parts of the button assembly.  
You open up the tip on the G2 to be able to fit a Bic Cristal cartridge but make the button assembly and spring stay inside, load the cartridge, push and click the button.
Unrelated but my carrier's insurance once sent me an S7 instead of an S7 edge for a replacement. They wouldn't give a fuck about it and blamed us until I tweeted at them. I'd give it a try, might solve it.

Well PSN shouldn't allow that many invites to go through, but the game allows you to spam the shit out of the invite button. Used to happen in Black Ops III, Treyarch ended up fixing it by adding a cooldown.
Oranjuice sounds like a juice brand name.
Already fixed it by changing to borderless window. Thanks anyway.
The notifications are from Fortnite. You're able to spam the shit out of the invite button.
I did that, but notifications kept coming through and had to disable them.

EDIT: Also, my cousin does that sometimes, where it's not much of a solution to block them since they're your friend.
Thanks! That fixed it! Thought my GPU was dying.
I'm gonna try, unfortunately the screen goes black every second or so and cursor is invisible
Rocket League, GTA V, CS GO, Black Ops 2, Geometry Dash.
It's not worth 50 dollars, but I picked it up for 50 on the Steam sale along with a Steam Controller and they're absolutely great. Steam Controller works fantastically as an HTPC remote too.
Agreed. My S7 edge runs absolutely great apart from the battery life. Only gripe is the fragile edge screen, they should've released a 5.5 inch flat S7.
Chicken dinner gaming mouse? As for PUBG?
Except the Note 8 and iPhone 8 are the same price, sitting at $1000.
The S7's screen isn't 4k, it's 1440p, and the iPhone X goes a bit higher than 1080p. It's still more resolution, but nowhere near as high as you said.
They make really good flash memory. Look at their SSDs, they're great. Also makes great displays.
Yeah, but LineageOS is a really good fork of it, and I think Resurrection Remix is a LineageOS fork with themes and other stuff.
RMA and they didn't have stock maybe?
LineageOS is a pretty good replacement.

I kind of disagree. I bought a PS4 USB hub from there and it works pretty good for connecting a headset, mouse and keyboard for Fortnite. Bought a 2€ wireless Magic Mouse clone and while it's shit (expected for the price) it works fine.
Well there are 10tb SSDs with a 2.5in enclosure or a 3.5in HDD with a 10TB enclosure.
Nah, even a G4560 can handle a 1060 with no or slight bottleneck.
Proprietary for the case or the motherboard? I'm not OP but I'd gladly put the 1060 in and leave the PSU outside the case or power it with a second low power one.

Oh nvm, misread and thought it was 25$. That's really cheap. Here in Spain we have the Yoigo Sinfín (literally means "without end") which has 25GB and unlimited calls for 32€ a month which is probably the best price/GB available.
Is that expensive compared to the US? If it is I think I'd rather have that over data caps on home internet.
And miniUSB.
The Razer Phone also had it on the side right? It's a great choice to put it on the side, you barely need to adjust from a device without a reader and IMO it's more natural than on the front and back.

Yeah, disable the touchscreen. My laptop digitizer broke only 6 months after a repair, it was pretty hard to disable the touchscreen.
/r/PictureGame maybe?
I think I haven't seen a banana opened that way in years.
Probably a flair or indicating they're a moderator. What subreddit is that?
I smashed a TV and an iPod touch (which still perfectly works other than the chunk of glass missing by the home button) using a DS4 as a hammer playing GTA V. I should probably not buy it either.
Idk, it was just an estimation since I haven't checked US (or 1080ti since I can't afford them) prices in a while. Would make for an even better secondary rig or laptop though.
Someone should make an add-on that automatically replaces the Reddit search URL with the relevant Google search term plus site:reddit.com.
Was going to do the same then realized no one of my friends speaks English. And also that no one would probably talk to me if they're sad, except maybe my cousin.
Honestly I think I'd build a cheap MiniITX build or a cheap gaming laptop rather than spending $700/$800 on another 1080ti.
What desk is that?

I think I might get one since I've been wanting a second monitor for music controls or Discord, but I'll try to see if there's a cheaper non touchscreen one somewhere.
I like how it's intended for RPi but on the product page it shows a Windows 10 screenshot.
Lmfao that shitpost was great.
Those new Coffee Lake/Vega APUs could alsobe pretty cool if we see some gaming tablets or portable consoles similar to the Switch or GPD Win.
I wonder if InkBall or whatever it was called works. Spent a lot of time playing that on my neighbor's Vista laptop.

You're not wrong...
Had a similar thing happen, gave my account details to a friend to test a weapon in Black Ops 3 (dumb, I know). My cousin got on my PS4 and deleted his BO3 account progress as I had his account too, so his brother went and deleted my character in GTA. Rockstar did nothing unfortunately. I got a modded account with my previous level and bought my way back up.
It should be 4 years or more. Got a hold of my dad's Xperia Z2 after he upgraded, still a great phone but didn't even get Nougat, which is ridiculous.
FX 8320 + Ducky One, honestly a Magicforce would've been good without spending 130€

My dad got an XZ Premium today, and I gotta say I kind of want to upgrade from my S7, even though it's a perfectly capable phone.

Only the disk drive and maybe the casing should be fucked up. Get those parts new, some Torx Security drivers (normal Torx will work in a pinch), look up an iFixit guide and replace it yourself instead of buying a new Xbox. 

I don't know how hard an Xbox is, but I gutted my PS4 a few days ago to clean it and replace the thermal paste as it was making a ton of noise and it was fairly easy.

Oh for fucks sake I thought I dodged a bullet by having an AMD processor. So this affects everything from consoles to Raspberry Pies and phones or just PCs?

Shit I remember when you could just go to a website and slide a button like if you were unlocking the phone. Jailbroke my iPod when the iOS 10 JB came out and while it was simple you still needed a PC and download some programs.

Android root was also pretty simple. I rooted my Galaxy Mini in the shitter when I was younger.
I got it years ago, it's supposed to be a PSP but I'm not sure if it is a 3000. Would be cool with a clear casing.

EDIT: Apparently it's a 2000, [here's the source.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJWU8Wj7GY4)

It was so I could swap the yellow one's front on the black one and not have to buy a new one.
Unfortunately I fucked up the casing on the yellow (Simpsons limited edition) one while trying to pull it apart, is there anywhere I could get a similar bezel and a faceplate?

EDIT: Also, is there any way I could swap only the front glass on the 3000? Has a small crack from where I tried to use a NDS stylus on it when I was a kid.

Honestly PC makes GTA V much better. You can mess around with mods in single player, or join drop lobbies to get money in online and not have to grind, plus you're able to play at 60fps.

I've got a 1060 3GB, and it struggles to get 60fps at low 1080p ultrawide.
Ohhh, forgot about the V line.
It's also 6$ on Steam, but the optimization is a bit trash.
Does it have an uncommon resolution? Either you have a really wide 1080p display, a 1440p with a half pixel or an almost square 4k display. It isn't an iPhone X.
Probably a 7+ or 8+.

You can do whatever you want on singleplayer, doubt anyone will give a shit.
So, you pay $300/$400 for the console, $60 for each game, another $60 a year for online gaming and you get fucking ads on the system?

I just tried it out. Was delicious, even more when mixed with a spoonful of Nutella, although I'd say it's more like cold yogurt instead of ice cream. I did put it in the microwave for about 1p seconds since it was as hard as a rock at first.

It was so I can wipe my phone due to random restarts and not lose the widget I made, so yes, it will provide me enjoyment, or at least remove my infuriation.
For $600 you might want to consider an X240 (or X250) instead, there's not much difference in performance from X230 to X240 (X230 is better due to the ULV CPU in the X240, X250 will be better), but the battery life and I think the display will be better, so I think it'll fit better for your use case. Could also go for the T*40 or T*50 if you want a larger screen.
Why palmrest? Is the keyboard not compatible with the X230 palmrest? Only difference I know of is the contoured trackpoint buttons.
