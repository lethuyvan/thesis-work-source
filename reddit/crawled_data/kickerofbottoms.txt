I would recommend a WD Blue SATA drive and a Startech SATA to IDE converter.

You'll also need an 80 wire IDE cable, don't try to use the stock one.
That's cool, I didn't know you could take these apart or crimp your own. Is there any actual difference in the wiring that makes this superior to installing in reverse, though?

I don't believe so. I was interested it trying it but from what I read it causes issues when used with 14.1. 15.1 might be another story due to the changes in AOSP but I can't say for sure.

wat.

Lineage OS 14.1 is great if you want something stable and up to date. Customizable enough for me, although it lacks theming support
Lots of routers have a bridge mode, get one with DD-WRT and plug that into your Xbox
I wonder if you could rig up some kind of SATA selector to toggle between a connection to the IDE adapter and a SATA to USB converter 🤔
Interesting, never knew about this
Wow, that was stupidly easy.  I'm back up and rolling with a nulled key, did the upgrade on both HDDs for good measure.  Thanks for maintaining these slick tools!
You're the best. Now I just need to find my torx...
Oh that's a great idea, I'll try that route. One more question, then: can I run your softmod installer off of the HDD, or does it need to run off of a disc? I don't have a burner handy
I also tell myself that the data Google collects is often used to make their products better and more useful. Like tracking location to provide traffic estimates
Interesting, I didn't realize that was a thing.

Yeah, it's a SATA with adapter. Rocky suggested Xbox HDM so I'm gonna look into that
Thanks, could chimp relock it with the backed up eeprom if I reinstalled the original HDD as the master?
Cheers, thanks for the tips. I'll look into those

HDR is broken in newer versions of Google camera that were previously not installable on marshmallow. You have to downgrade to 2.7 for working HDR, otherwise it just snaps a regular pic

There was one or two other problematic ones but I can't remember which.

Looking at the default.acl it looks like it would have written over the existing _orig backup with the already-patched .xbe  when I tried processing a second time (which is kind of a dumb way for it to work IMO).  So maybe I should try recopying at least the default.xbe from the disc.
Thanks for the tips!

There was an *_orig, and I tried processing the ACL for it again. Also tried restoring the original before processing. But it still gives an instant dirty disc error on launch 🤔

Everyone on here recommends that adapter but I read about a few quality control issues, prompting me to go with the startech. All of that white crap on yours is kinda concerning.

Also make sure you're using an 80-wire IDE cable, it's required for SATA adapters if I understand correctly. I tried using the stock one and it caused some subtle issues
Andrei M., my hero 😍
Well the biggest point of failure is the disc drive, and the best way to mitigate that is by putting in a larger HDD and playing games directly off of that.

It's also easier to swap the hard drive if the original still functions, since it needs to be locked to the mobo with a unique code and it's tough to retrieve that if the Xbox doesn't boot.

Also I'll give you the obligatory "remove the clock cap". 

Check out the wiki in the sidebar for some good info on all of that.

So basically yeah, I'd recommend it.

Honestly I don't really have a good answer to that.

Personally I don't take any special precautions beyond what I'd do anyway (no password reuse, 2FA where available, etc.).  My perception is that the probability of having a chipset-level vulnerability used against you is lower than one of the "standard" attack vectors like phishing and Russians using your Equifax info. But I don't really know ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
This is the best option, but it should also be noted that there are vulnerabilities that can't be patched by anyone other than the chipset manufacturers. So the Nexus 5 will never again be as secure as a currently supported phone

> It is possible that having a ton of ROMs will increase load times due to the emu having to find and pull all of the ROM files.

Ah yeah, totally. I also noticed EvoX taking longer to load after backing up more games. However this shouldn't affect load times *within* games and that kind of thing. So really it's a software performance issue and not a hard drive performance issue.

Good points about the fragmentation. It seems like the cache partitions might be more susceptible to it since they handle random read/writes more often, but obviously that wouldn't be a big issue since they get cleared out.
Or, ya know, get a pH test strip :p
Why is that? Just because there's no way to defrag? Normally (in the non-Xbox world) you should be able fill a hard drive to something like 80 or 90% before performance takes a hit

But what's the real advantage to TSOP flashing? Seems like a softmod does everything you could need
Perfect. I'll try using XBMC and if I lose the IGR I'll give this a shot. Thanks!
Ahhh, awesome!

I thought you were saying it requires a custom BIOS *and* softmod.  Thanks for the clarification.
Alright, no custom BIOS, good to know.  So if I want this I'll have to TSOP flash to go with the softmod.  Thanks for the help
Forgive my noobishness.  The softmod is more than tricking the Xbox to boot a custom dash?  I figured that was the extent of it.  If I could get this to work without TSOP that would be rad.

If that's the case, can I boot Rocky5's tool from the HD and update my current softmod?  Not real keen on reinstalling my burner and trying to find media that will read on my finnicky Thompson.
Hmm, in EvoX IGR was actually disabled for me even though it always worked...  I wonder if I have a modded BIOS?  That would require TSOP flashing I assume?

A friend originally modded my Xbox a good 8-10 years ago so I don't remember the entire process very clearly, but I believe he used Slayer's tools.  Also certain we didn't TSOP flash, though.
I do, but it was less than ideal because I bought a round one and had to remove most of the rubberized casing to get it to flex enough. Worked fine after that but not exactly plug and play.

I'd search around for the flat one that's been linked on this sub.

But if you're like me and really want prime shipping [here's what I used](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B073T3VNC3/ref=oh_aui_i_d_old_o0_img?ie=UTF8&psc=1). Looks like it's $4 cheaper now -_-
Ooh, interesting. I was wondering what the point of TSOP flashing was. I'll have to look into that, a little bit scared of bricking my box though
Yeah most likely.  I used a 320GB hard drive, but after Chimp I had a 137GB F and no G.
Things I ran into when I did this a week or two ago:

* An 80-wire IDE cable definitely is required when using a SATA adapter.  Even though the stock 40-wire seems to work at first it can cause some more subtle issues
* Chimp may only work if using the basic composite/RCA/yellow-red-white AV cables.  My official component HD pack caused the Xbox to shutdown when loading Chimp
* You'll need to use [XBPartitioner](http://www.theisozone.com/downloads/xbox/homebrew-apps/xbpartioner-13/) to format the G drive after the swap, assuming your hard drive is large enough to require one
The S is way more comfortable unless maybe you have Andre the Giant hands

Get in on that custom ROM game, no sense sticking around in marshmallow now that Google has abandoned our phones
It depends on whether or not it's genuine, or so I've heard.

Keep in mind that Amazon is not likely selling any N5 batteries themselves so they'll all be coming from random 3rd parties
lol, I thought that was obvious
It doesn't specifically say that, they probably got rid of some unnecessary colors to achieve that refresh rate
Blegh, sorry mate. Not sure about that one
I'm guessing the radio/baseband is outdated and you'll need to update that first to what the ROM is expecting.

https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/57747/what-is-the-baseband-and-do-i-need-to-update-mine

Not super familiar with it all, tbh, so sorry I'm not more help. I had the latest stock OTA update (and therefore the latest baseband version) on my phone before I went the custom ROM route, so I never had to deal with it. Pretty sure you can update it on its own, though

You nailed it. The Sonys intrigue me, I like the idea of the compact form factor with flagship specs. But I dunno if I trust Sony to keep it up to date and I haven't looked into the custom ROM support yet. I really don't care about being bezel-less though, contrary to popular opinion on here.

The OnePlus 3T might be a contender for me, seems like it has most everything hardware-wise and good Lineage support.

But alas, my MO is to run what I've got until the performance is no longer tolerable, so I'll have to reevaluate in another year or two when the N5 craps out :p
You'd need more than a lottery jackpot to lobby against the ISPs and fight them in court

As the plane flies over the sensor is pulsing a laser and measuring the amount of time it takes to reflect back, which is converted to a distance. The location and roll/pitch/yaw of the plane is being recorded so each pulse's position can be located in relation to the earth. Bounce each pulse off a mirror that's flipping back and forth and you get a scanning system instead of just measuring straight down. Do this hundreds (thousands?) of times a second.

Each laser pulse (well, most of them) returns to the sensor multiple times since the beam spreads and bounces off multiple things as it goes (top of tree, branches further down, fence post, ground...) resulting in a 3D cloud of points that penetrates the tree canopy. The last return is most likely to be the ground, so couple that info with some math and manual cleanup and you can filter down to just ground points.

Connect all of the ground points together into a mesh of the smallest possible triangles and you get a continuous ground model instead of a sparse cloud of points.

Add some simulated solar effects to cast shadows on this model and render that into a hillshade image like this post, and voila, WWII trenches.

I used to use that ROM before I switched to Lineage.

It was very smooth and stable, I was running it with Open GApps and SuperSU. No OTA updates, but you can dirty flash. I did that successfully twice but had to clean flash another time due to force closes I couldn't fix.

Overall it was a good ROM. I prefer Lineage now but would be perfectly happy if I had to go back.

Love this one.  I always go for 0.5x.  You can also set custom scales through ADB if you wanna get real specific:

    adb shell settings put system window_animation_scale 0.66
    adb shell settings put system transition_animation_scale 0.66
    adb shell settings put system animator_duration_scale 0.66

Nice write-up! Wish I had one when I first flashed something. 

Here's what you could do for systemless root:

8 . Install [Magisk](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445) via ADB sideload

9 . Boot

10 . Install Magisk Manager via XDA Labs, enable Magisk Hide

11 . Do whatever you couldn't with normal root, like installing Netflix from Google Play and downloading content for offline viewing


Other comments:

* Check your radio and bootloader versions, you might be able to skip that step. I already had the latest from OTA marshmallow

* I never use sideload, but seems like that's be handy

If it's lossless then a 1920x1080 image is as good as it gets. But video compression is lossy, so it tries to discard information to save space and not every pixel is represented exactly. Which it's why representing a greater number of pixels than your monitor it's technically capable of displaying looks better in that case
Same reason, it's rendering/streaming more data than necessary then scaling it down, rather than sending "just enough"

Well in very simple terms... You know where the satellite is in relation to the earth at any given point in time, you know when the shot was taken, and you know which way the sensor was oriented at the time of the shot. You also know the geometry of the sensor, the shape of the earth, etc. It's "just" a matter of relating all of those data points in order to map every pixel to a ground location. Kinda like a puzzle, more like a bunch of geometry
