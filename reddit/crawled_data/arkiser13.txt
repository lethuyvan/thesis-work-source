If you can't afford a monitor right now I would recommend going to your local thrift shop and picking up one for $15-30 sure it won't be 1080p or 4k but it will work until you can get a new monitor

Just hold a lighter to it next time it fucks the data up pretty bad
Sounds like it is dead I'm not sure about other manufacturers but if it is a Seagate you can send it to them and they will recover the data 
My bad I thought you meant that you tried to boot your working laptop from the drive but if you tried it as an external device already and the bios does not see it the drive might be broken. Listen to the drive carefully if you hear a click click click noise you have a stuck platter
What I would try is booting your working laptop off its good hard drive and plugging in the hard drive from the broken laptop in with a usb to sata adapter (they are pretty cheap at Canada computers)

EDIT: it is not in stock at Canada computers but this one from best buy will work https://m.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/product/insignia-insignia-2-5-sata-to-usb-3-0-hard-drive-enclosure-ns-pchd235-c-ns-pchd235-c/10292173. 

If you wait for Canada computers to get it back in stock it will be ALOT cheaper

Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

In West Philadelphia, born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said "I might as well kick it"
First class, yo, this is bad
Drinkin' orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air livin' like?
Hmmm, this might be all right
But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that
Is this the type of place that they just sent this cool cat?
I don't think so, I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the Prince of Bel-Air

Sisters reason behind this
This situation is more likely now that I think of it more ram does not just die like that know some people with vintage commador systems from the mid 70's that have never had a part replaced and it works fine.
Another thing that could be the problem is that the cpu cooler is clogged up with dust  and not letting heat escape if this is the case you should clean it with a vaccume cleaner on the LOW setting or use a can of compressed air (usually  found at the dollar store)
Oh.i thought you meant your cpu is always under 100% load 
This is an unrelated issue you may have a virus running in the backround and you should probably run a scan with Malwarebytes
Good for you
Is the motherboard original if not give me the model number of the board 
There should be some indication on the rear front bottom or sides of the computer looking for a model number for example HP pavilion 310n or Dell XPS 410
Probably it looks like it's high quality
It has a built in 90 mAh li-ion battery
Is my cheap 3$ mp3 player safe 
Can you find the model number of your PC so I can find the right type of ram for it 
No problem keep my updated
Lithium ion batteries are the kind of thing that could be working one day and be as dead as a doornail the other 
Hmm maybe you ram is bad if you have another pc create a bootable Linux usb with another pc (http://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-install-linux-mint-on-your-windows-pc) boot from it and see if the problem persists judging by the age of your PC you will need at least 2gb ddr2 ram ( http://www.newegg.ca/Product/Product.aspx?Item=20-231-207) hope this helps
