You are now a moderator of r/relationships
Too close to call
You definitely should not. The audio is extremely disturbing.
Fate has saved you. Yes it is a sign
Their screams will haunt you for a while. It's the audio that is truly unnerving and chilling. WAY worse than just a gory video of death.
I've been and still think it's a social media fest
I hate them for the reasons you described. But I really appreciate you being able to at least see why someone like myself wouldn't like them and to each his own.
That's the point of this post imo. But for some reason most of the people in this thread are completely missing this point and thinking op meant how dare anyone take pics at a festival.
Damn I'm sorry. Not that intellij is terrible or something but I've just really been loving vsc.
Wait what forced you to change?
I want to find a girl who looks at me like an Asian girl in her early 20s looks at boba.
Price. Or to be more specific, value.
The same thing happens to me when using a white background. It literally feels like my eyes are getting sunburnt and they sting lol
Cod mw1 without a doubt had the defined territories you are describing. That was my favorite part about it.
I'm a dude and not married. But I've never spoken to someone in a way that even resembles that...
Now I understand why so many people on this sub complain about vibration motor intensity...

I know this is subjective and says nothing against her tech credibility... But oh my god do her and her husband have one of the strangest relationships I've ever seen. Have you ever the way they talk to each other?
It's just so unlike u/gallowboob to be a piece of shit..
The boundaries of how long you are willing to wait for an update
I had a similar experience at Coachella maybe 5 years ago. I can't enjoy festivals since making that connection. It's hard to explain but once I saw it through that "lens" it disturbed me to my core in a weird way.
Jannut
Hey it's me ur 3rd party
Possibly the best way to describe the admin/user relationship ever 😂
It's frustrating because it feels like you have to spend twice as much as back in the day, but I'm not making twice what I made back then so....
Holy fuck why is that so on point..
Can't believe I haven't heard it called until your comment. Annnnnnd now that's how I will refer to it from now on, thank you.
What aspect disturbed you? Just how selfish he was and how he acted to his friends and gf?
They're arguing about how the revenue is for a non-chronological feed. There's no reason they can't do it increase the amount users scroll (to show more ads) AND have people pay to be near the top, which is much less obvious when the feed is non-chronological.
You both can be right...
You could be the vp some company somewhere with that thinking.
I have no performance problems on mine whatsoever. Extremely fast and smooth multitasking. Sd 821 with 4gigs of ram and stock latest Android holds up no problem.
Curious if you're one of the "young" conservatives in the area that people talk about yet I never seem to meet. Not sure how asking your age is automatic discrimination?
Mind enlightening us on the ballpark of your age?
As the other commenter stated, I am constantly using silent mode.
I agree with you on the fact that it should just be contextual. But I'm still trying to understand the use case of adjusting alarm *volume* regularly. I've never really seen someone adjust it with any frequency after setting up the alarm..
I couldn't tell you the last time I adjusted alarm volume. More than 6 months ago
Whoa for real? That's gotta be super rare. But I guess it does happen
But why shoot randos? Yeah I get it, you're pissed at your bf, but once you do the deed Wtf are you shooting random people for?
Don't they always discontinue their previous devices? I could have sworn that's what they typically did.
I'm waiting for it to be gwg then I'll gladly try it out. I'm not giving them any of my money directly though
Dude for real? Uhh...... God's speed to you
Isn't that the record? Or has someone done it even younger in the last 15 years?
This gets posted every couple months here
I saw them a couple years ago also lol. He came on stage with a giant backpack and set it down next to the mic. Never took anything out of it, when they were done he just picked up, put it on and left the stage. I really wanted to know what was in there. Also, I remember him throwing a water bottle into the crowd and there weren't many people there so it just hit the ground awkwardly in one of the large spaces between people.
Are you spherical?
I first started visiting reddit in 2008. The search function hasn't really improved in any noticeable way since then..
This is the mindset of an insane number of Asians in Southern California, please don't trigger me like that.
I understand your point and that logic. But porting to each phone should be considered a unique project. They have had oreo a month or two before it was released. There's obviously a bottle neck in their process somewhere and I would imagine it's manpower. If not manpower what explanation could there be for that long of delay?
Wait how are they not parallelizable? If you have a team of 10 working on all aspects of a single software project, why can't you hire another 10 to fully complete another project? There's of course a huge overlap but there's a shared code base though..
It's really frustrating and I still have and pixel 1 xl. Because I know that I will be forced to not have it in the future. For software update and camera reasons I'll only buy pixel from now on but it's just sad knowing that if something happens to my phone I'm forced into a no headphone jack phone. Eh guess I should just enjoy it will it lasts..
No one in this thread thinks that this is a joke.
Holy shit living the dream. Working from home AND with a job that allows you to afford this. Maybe one day..
Then you don't have enough "desire"
What's it like to be in 6th grade?
Most of the IT guys at my work have CS degrees. I've got cis and keep up with them just fine.
I got the digital for $20 months ago. Best gaming decision I've ever made.
Generating a queue list shouldn't have that much overhead though. You don't need to literally queue all the pictures themselves and all the data until runtime. Even if there's 50 posts you haven't seen, that could just be a list of 50 strings that can be sorted effortlessly by any cpu before the actual data is pulled in. It just comes down to how you structure the app I guess.
If one side of the switch makes them more money, why would they let you toggle at all? As long as making a significant portion of their users so mad they uninstall the app, they could give a shit.
That assumes the algorithm is built for what you want and not what the company wants. Do you know how easy it would be to sort in chronological order? It doesn't take a very complex algorithm to sort all posts by a time stamp, the most junior of developers could write that.
That was only one of their phones they released though.. I really don't like OP but the problem you're talking about is not really an established pattern or something..
I got a black xl also. My original 6p was silver, my rma 6p was black. So when they gave me the pixel they gave me black because that was my latest device. Lol
Yeah that's definitely one of the things it seems all mid range always lack
Ehh gave him an hour
If he doesn't get the reference this comment is that much funnier.
Oh wow interesting. Thanks, I've been lucky every time someone hits me they've had insurance
Curious as to what happened? The person that hit you is just in the clear?
How is my comment any more condescending than the comment I was responding to or even the comment you made that I'm responding to right now? Not sure what you think my motivation is? Because I own a pixel I think that one day samsung will eventually cave and remove the headphone jack and add a notch? Because that's literally what we're talking about.
Years down the road, if literally every single other manufacturer is doing it there's no way they would try to be different. You say "destroy" like they wouldn't play it off as an "evolution". Lol did it "destroy" their design when they removed physical buttons?
I hope you're right. But a big part of me feels like it's almost inevitable, they can only hold out so long. So frustrating.
His stack overfloweth
Please don't trigger me I've got ptsd bro.
He's saying he wears a lot of Victoria Secret
She's probably be fully this pack if she had the means then. If you had money or her dad had money..
I don't have that so I'm definitely going to have to move away in a few years. I'm just glad people like you can admit it.
There's got to be a reason this is upvoted though right?
Not sure he ever implied he wasn't...
Same thing with me. It's funny how divided it is though. The people who got the pixels are customers for life and the people who were denied have tons of hate. If only Google owned up and provided that for everyone no matter what. Sometimes when you make a mistake it costs you money, sorry Google.
Idk I think 8.1 is pretty clean. Probably my favorite notification drawer so far
Zero tolerance!
I'm not suggesting that anyone should bully anyone. It's just not that black and white though
What are the odds that the older person "has money"? I'm not saying you're wrong and sometimes they just fall in love. But the majority has to do with money. It always has and always will. This is not some new concept, older rich dudes have been with young hot girls for literally thousands of years.
"asshole" is a sliding scale. Sure it's probably on there to make fun of sugar babies but it's much different than making fun of someone for being blind or has cerebral palsy or something. Making fun of someone for something they CHOOSE will always be on the low end of the asshole scale.
He was going to pop her cherry that night.
That was a good year for memes
Wtf kind of organizational hierarchy puts the financial director managing IT?
What sucks is it's a problem that takes 2-3 years to fix once you admit you have the problem. And I'm pretty sure they just admitted to it like last year lol. I'm not even an Xbox fan boy I just think good competition will bring everyone better games.
What is it now?
I thought someone shit in their lettuce or something?
So we're just assuming he's being serious? That's pretty bold no?
It's almost like the laws do a laughable job of stopping the violence..
Appreciate it, thanks dude!
But I wasn't talking to you. Or even about you...
What's worse is he THINKS he does.
What block lists are you running? Mind dumping them to a pastebin?
I've been to the bacara and I'm pretty sure that was only the price of a single drink.
Just because I'm currently discussing the media coverage means that I'm more upset about it than the shooting? Wow, please tell me how else I feel about it.
Re-worded my comment to mean what point I was trying to make. Thanks for responding in such a nice way. You seem like a cool person.
That's.... Not healthy my dude. You should get help with that.
You realize they prop them up for money right? Like they literally have financial incentive to make things last longer.
I know this is begging for downvotes.... But fuck. That. Shit. There's no fucking way the barrier to see a play should be that high. I saw wicked on fucking Broadway for 80 a pop.
Now I'm hungry God dammit
That's what I said until I bought a pm2. Feel in hand, quality and performance have outweighed any design issues I had originally.
I'll gladly swap the stress I have now for that stress.
Honest question, how do you handle the small shit that happens almost daily?
Thanks dude
How do you do that?
If her boyfriend/husband doesn't have at least a half sleeve of tattoos and a beard I'll eat my own dick.
DESIGNATED standing aisle.
I'm not crying, you're crying..
Oh my God that just destroys me to think about
People typically come into high school at 14..
You should teach a class
That's the meta!
I don't disagree at all. But what do we do? There's no way even gun control could prevent this type of thing? Not being snark or sarcastic I just don't even understand what our options could be. Required yearly mental health checks? Armed guards at every entrance of every school. You're right about how doing nothing doesn't help because right now we're all just waiting for the next one.
Local pd might be a start
Still need "evidence" of a "plot"
It's assholes all the way down..
That's a pretty important distinction imo. One is extremely rare, expensive and mostly illegal. The other is completely common and legal.
Exactly, look up what virtue signaling is and there you go.
Wow this shooter is turning out to be a big movie buff.
Or if you have c4 you could just breach the door..
I had the exact same experience moving from the 6p to the pixel 1 xl.
I don't disagree was merely stating that they're out there and not all that uncommon
What does that mean? Are you talking about adapters?
Some places are small enough to not have that separation..
But I'm specifically talking about phones without one..
Headphone jack is still way more offensive to me. You literally just took away a feature that millions of people use daily and replaced it with NOTHING. I already had Bluetooth for wireless headphones and USB C. Fucking insane.
Dude, that's gay..
I had to rma my phone after reading this comment.
**Jamba juice**
Are you saying nougat and Oreo aren't as polished? I would definitely beg to differ. I've had less and less stability problems since the days of jellybean. I've been using android since version 1.1 and it has only been getting more polished and stable with every release.
This is true. Despite the Motorola Droids success compared to the Android phones prior. It still wasn't as mainstream as the s3 was. As a G1 owner, I remember these days and devices quite well.
Avoiding releasing phones with Oreo. Because of project treble.
Every left handed person in the world collectively sighed at this comment. Doesn't make your point less valid though
Is it not implied?
Well played m8
Thanks for the suggestions! Yeah I'd say $400 would be my ultimate high end of budget and I would have to fall in love with it to order it. Definitely eyeing the seiko now though..
Every time I see a watch that I like on here I stupidly look up the price :| fml
It took me 3 weeks last month and I literally got it the first day (today) this month. I don't know what to think :|
Got a sys engineer job at a SaaS company 3 months ago. Yup, gonna be here for a while. A lot of work since they are slightly understaffed but they've hired two people since I've joined so at least they're making an effort.
Because everyone is using a computer to view reddit?
H.E. Pennypacker? The wealthy industrialist and philanthropist?
Oddly enough Asians drive the shit out of them where I live but I'm sure that's just a regional thing.
This knife and the dividend are like the best fucking deal in knives right now. My dividend in m390 gets so much pocket time it's unbelievable.
They will keep raising prices until it affects their sales numbers.
It's definitely regional then, because a nitro for this guy seemed oddly perfect as soon as I saw it.
Uh there's something definitely wrong if that's the case
Cool fam, see you at the top!
Is it possible to make it from the parking lot to the top with a hover board with only street tires? I'd rather not walk it.
Do they make any tapped for southpaws like me?
I'm crl w-ing as hard as I can on my phones screen but it just doesn't seem to want to close..
Am I being detained?!
How do you close a single tab though?
Huh, very cool!
Whoa why so many?
Are you afraid of the dark?
Hmm that's fair.
What's the difference between him and a low level sysadmin?
Wait what's not clever about "I'm so weak" and a bunch of laughing emojis? It's almost as funny as "who did this?"

There's no fucking reason to screenshot the lame ass retweets, why can't we all just agree to screenshot the actual joke tweet?
I've gotten this edgy with recruiters after they've asked multiple times. I can't fucking stand tech recruiters.
Guaranteed the person that made that add-on was a higher paid and better dev than the government contractor employee that made the ui for this alert system.
The speakers are the only thing I miss when I moved to the og xl. But I will gladly give them up for a much smoother and faster phone and of course a phone that actually lasts me through the day.
Yeah I'm way too scared to buy a 2xl. I literally have no complaints with my og xls screen and performance and I don't want to even risk downgrading the screen quality.
I really hope they use the 845. Feels like the 835 has been out forever at this point.
Even though it all worked out for me, I also will never buy a Huawei again either.
I think he just means the whole sub hates the phone for the most part. Back at the height of the craziness a few months ago, that sub was nothing but hundreds of complaints about the phone and its battery problems. So happy I exchanged it with a pixel xl for free during the very small window they were doing it.
Your comment is without a doubt my greatest fear written out.
Oh God, please don't give him the idea to split dms out of the instagram app. This dude would actually do that shit.
Yes. Yes I do.
It's a myth
How do we know he had no monitors? I can't see the ground around him and am not close enough to see his ears..
Yeah he was hitting it too fast to be a metronome imo..
I'm so glad you said this. I thought I was going crazy.
How many times did you press it, just once? I just tried it a couple times and it didn't work. Tmobile pixel 1
Orange County?
Who said anything about that? You could still bidet or at the very least use wet wipes.. I just think a full blown shower every shit seems excessive
I shit in the shower. And *waffle stomp*
Wait she showers after every shit?
Depending on the temperature of the phone and environment it was in. I got it to throttle HARD browsing reddit on a summer day. I've never had a phone throttle even close to that on a warm day.
Worst case is you get bent over and raped in whiteboarding time after time until you have no more confidence in programming whatsoever.
Getting serious Breckenridge vibes. Am I right op?
Awesome!! Thanks u/darkciti
I would really like to see that write up. How are you getting the pihole data into influx?
Ended up just doing a repair and I'm good now. I have no idea were the update script went though..
Weird it can't find my update.sh...
I'm saying they've all been shitty this year..
People without money will tell you it's mostly luck. People with money will tell you it's ALL hard work. Hint: it's a lot of both. Don't ever believe a rich dude that says it's all hard work and don't believe a broke person when they try to tell you the opposite.
I fucking love simple pi projects thanks OP. Not everything has to be a fucking machine learning drone capable of bitcoin mining and home automation..
Everyone is Newport and Laguna better be getting fucking coal this year.
Don't people in the know say it's super ignorant to to claim any software is bug free?
Damn do you just have a big savings?
Snooty people in SB? No, I don't believe it...
Assuming the s9 will have this?
What routers out there actually respect the primary and secondary dns 100%? Are there any consumer routers that do this? I have a Netgear nighthawk and I haven't fully tested if it sometimes randomly uses the second dns but now I'm paranoid lol.
Is this why I remember people saying that when you set up your dns in your router ONLY use the pihole server and don't put Google or whatever as the second server because sometimes the second one will get used randomly? Do I understand this correctly?

The only small changes you'll need to make is to get the the pihole to work while you're using the vpn.
What sot are you typically getting?
He just felt it necessary to come out and let everyone know how he would never lie to a service rep.
Thankfully a large amount of reddit users pay Verizon money every single month. Thanks guys! Inb4 something about coverage.
My God. A giant platter of homemade authentic Mexican tamales? That sounds so much better than any sort of payment.
Dat feel when pihole and ublock origin..
Link broken for me. Could be just me though. On reddit sync
>Mr. Soleri was NOT a hippie in any way, shape or form

Ok

>He wanted sustainability not consumerism.

LOL ok
If they weren't so fucking loud I'd rock one at my desk at work.
all that just needs to be elsewhere, like a watch or something. They would just need to perfect power transfer wirelessly between the devices. It's definitely possible it's just far out, but I'd say less than 100 years though.
I fucking love this meme and I choose to laugh every time.
I understand it and accept that it's a thing. But I'll never be 'ok' with that.
The "so he does" rusltes me every time.
Yeah I'm thinking of the apps that use web views
I just wish more apps used it.
Wow kinda surprised how much I ended picking the 5t, I figured I'd be choosing the 2xl every time.
There was some magical pairing of hardware and software in the nexus 5. Like some sort of lightning in a bottle type shit. You really felt like you were getting at least what you paid for despite it's flaws.
I think it's difficult to say exactly the cause. The battery and whatever controls it are probably the main problems but it is hard to say the 810 didn't contribute in some meaningful way.
I just don't understand why. Why is anyone of any nationality hard coding ANY language subs?
Came here to say this. This is almost an integral part of this starter pack in my mind.
Sorry misread. I forgot to mention I was sshing from inside the network. Using the local ip.
Thanks man this sounds exactly like what was happening
Yeah I was thinking about that the other day. There's literally no chance in hell to get a skate 4 that doesn't have insane amounts of micro transactions. But I still kind of want to play a new skate game. I know this is naive but I'd hope it would only be payed board graphics and clothing.
Ah I see! Makes sense
I actually do have two pis but the other is dedicated retropie lol
I've done all the above on a single pi for a while now lol.
You're 203? Are you really tall? You look like 165 lol
I had set a static ip on the pi, but that's definitely something I'll check better next time. I didn't even think to see if the pi was back on the network under a different ip
It's a sticking point for some people. But if they could just ignore it or embrace it it's a really funny show which became legendary for good reasons.
I wouldn't go that far but it's pretty good.
That was a rare occurrence for me. Most hr people just assumed that it was basically cs. Most hiring managers only gave a shit about my testable skills didn't care that it was cis.
I've been to several state schools and they all had a real police force, have guns and can arrest. Cpp has real police with real guns
I like this feature it shows me the device is actually charging
That depends how you are connecting to it?
Use snek phone
Yup this is exactly where my mind went as well. The only time I've ever been let go that ambiguous shit started happening a month or two prior.
Let's get social!
God damn that's sneaky and good. Gonna lock that one away.
Yeah my comment is a bit extreme. I'm just assuming he's eating WAY too many carbs currently and to cut back.
If you're serious, switch to nothing but water as a hard rule. No more fast food. ~~Have barely any carbs~~. Don't eat more than 2k calories. Get a fit bit and track your steps, hit at least 10k per day no matter what. Get a gym membership (4 DAYS PER WEEK MINIMUM) and walk uphill on the treadmill, start low and eventually work your way to doing it over an hour. Stop drinking alcohol.

Is it weird to say that you're lucky that your problem is obesity? I say that because it's a problem with known solutions. Problems without known solutions suck dick. Millions of people have lost weight by doing what I said above, it's all proven. All it takes is you wanting it bad enough. You can begin to solve your problem whenever you want. Most of this you probably already knew. Either way, good luck bro.


*edit: didn't think this would blow up. Yes, I agree that diet is more important than exercise. Yes I agree that everything I said isn't possible right off the bat. Yes I agree that I'm not a dietitian and don't know this dudes health history.

I'll try to respond to comments later I'm currently shitting at work and don't have much time.

*edit2: carbs aren't as bad as I'm making them out to be. I personally work out less and and generally feel like shit on a carb heavy diet so I had to cut way back on them to be able to go to the gym 4+ days a week. I couldn't eat a bowl if pasta and go to the gym. But a plate of chicken and broccoli and then the gym is no problem.
How is being in custody automatically guilty and charged?
For which he is HIGHLY paid.
I find it mildly offensive that Hella is associated with the entire state and not just nor Cal.
I truly hope that's not all the fixes lol.
They'll point all that out on non private tours too..
Why/how are you failing every single class?
I'm assuming that 5100 was your out of pocket max?
True. It should definitely scale depending on what you could potentially be on the hook for. 
Smart financial advisors say to do both. Your don't want to just invest literally every penny not in your checking. But having at least a few months living expenses sitting in a savings account is what's typically a good idea. 
You should Google the definition of buzzword. 
Why? 
Why hasn't anyone sourced these claims? People above you keep mentioning this and people are asking for sources. Asking for sources isn't implying your lying people just want to read more about it. 
Why is asking for a source downvoted? 
I have that combo on a raspberry pi sitting on my network 
Whoa how did that happen? 
What's weird is I could use the Sendmail command or whatever to send a single email and it worked perfect. But as soon as I tried to do unattended upgrades it wouldn't send the email but apparently tried every minute for 24 hours. I removed unattended upgrades and ssmtp so the spam stopped. I just want a way to be notified when it does an update once a day. Maybe I'll look into sms? Idk. 
Wow TIL thanks 
Oh I believe you. I used to live in Fullerton and commute every day to Newport! 
Agreed lol. I live near where the 55 meets the 405 and it's insanely bad. 
I'm not going to give the current home owners the satisfaction of buying their house for an inflated price lol
Is wifi over a mile physically possible for any device? I didn't think wifi in general was designed for that distance..
I'm waiting around for a couples years for a crash if it doesn't come I'll move.
Hence why he said "pre"
Op5 battery is gay?
Try it on Google maps DURING navigation. just press home during nav and it should work. You have to have YouTube redirect for it to work on YouTube.
Agreed. 8.1 is a really nice version of android. So far my only problems have been a few apps that crash more but I don't think they've been updated yet. Somehow it's even smoother than 8.0 with the same or slightly better battery.
If the use case is stupid I'm open to alternative solutions. How gray area file type attachments are handled in an enterprise environment is something I'd like more knowledge of. I know to just straight up filter out the obvious bad file types (exe) but I don't know standard practice for file types that can only sometimes be malicious. Is standard practice to just be extremely heavy handed with what is completely filtered out? I'm not being factitious, I actually don't know.
That's exactly why, I think they just want a "speed bump" on certain file types. I'm open to alternative solutions though. I'm not sure what is standard practice for gray area file types.
We have a quarantine address users can forward emails to that get opened on an isolated vm to make sure they're safe. I guess it's just a speed bump to make a user really think about just opening certain file types. We obviously filter out exes but for gray area extensions I think they want users to have to think about it and send it to quarantine if they arent 100%. I'm open to ideas though of how you or others deal with this as I'm not very experienced and just started 2 weeks ago so I'm not sure how much the IT director or CTO will take my suggestions to heart.
It would be cool to at least solve it like they want but also come up with a better solution. I appreciate any help!
The US Bank app feels like the biggest piece of shit ever. The speed of the ui will make any phone feel like it's 5 years old.
We're on 2013, sorry I realize this should have been in my post.

I'm reading through the article now, but will it let me change the extension and not just filter the attachment out? Maybe it's right in front of me and I'm just missing it. Thanks for your help!


Yeah this will be my first one. What commands are you using most?
Hopefully we can get that deal online. I'd like to avoid going into my local Walmart.. Lol
It has gotten better in the last couple years. Definitely far from being gone though. Throwing hardware at the problem has seemed to help a little.
Can you cite an example of that happening? I've never seen someone say that has happened to them
Is that only for in store or can I get that deal from Walmarts website?
I accidentally chose the wrong user during PiVPN setup. Can I go back and change that use once setup completes? If so, how?
About 6 hours out of that day no wifi. Because I worked a half day at work and don't use wifi there. When I'm at work for 9 hours no wifi I can still hit around 530ish sot. With this sot and the speed of the phone there's absolutely no reason to upgrade. Hoping next year's pixels have nicer hardware and I'll get one.
It seems almost absurd to launch a phone with nougat at this point. It seems purposefully avoiding project treble.
I'm actually pleasantly surprised with 8.1 beta on an og pixel xl. I've had it since beta was released and I'm currently at 48% battery with 3:45 sot which is totally adequate. But I got decent battery on 8.0 also though. Not quite this good if I'm remembering right.
> Just feels like I would be paying to have people advertising to me.

I love cable TV.
I can only hope.
I got tboned at a light in September and never told her that I had a dashcam. Police came and took witness statements of the people that saw it but I never told anyone that I had the cam. She told her insurance that she had the green and I had the red and it was my fault. You can't imagine the justice boner I had sending them the dash cam footage and police report that included witness statements. They called me back next day to tell me that she was at fault. She has the at fault on her record but literally no repercussions for flat out lying in her recorded statement to her insurance.
Which is the whole reason I'm in favor of keeping the headphone jack. If you love Bluetooth headphones that's totally fine, you can use them while still having the jack. Just give us an option.
There's a lot of people who live in Laguna and work at the spectrum? What jobs are the spectrum are paying enough to afford Laguna Beach?
Idk exactly where you're from but your numbers are dead on for LA/OC. I didn't realize people are out there making double that...
That's crazy. Has anyone figured why exactly that's happening. No phone built in the last 2 years should scroll like that.
It's without a doubt a minority sentiment even at a hard core place like r/apple to think flagship androids have bad picture quality. It isn't widely believed anymore. The absolute peak was when instagram first launched on Android, and they weren't wrong lol.
This was a common joke like 3 or 4 years ago. Even iPhone people currently admit that present day flagship Androids have as good or better cameras.
The og xl still flies on the 8.1 beta and the screen still looks great. Not to mention easily 5 hours sot every single day and also throw in a head phone jack. I just wish it had smaller bezels, water proofing, and front facing speakers. I literally no reason to upgrade currently.
Any game requiring quick precise movement is a bad suggestion for a non gamer. Unless you want them getting REALLY frustrated and turned off to the game. Great game if your gf is a gamer though. I honestly don't think it's a very good suggestion. inb4 "my gf isn't a gamer and really likes it and is good at it".
What a way to start your day lol
His comment implies that 500k only covers a portion or nursing school lol
How much do you think nursing school costs? Let's assume she has a bachelors.
That's a good point
Jesus time flies. I remember that being posted like it was yesterday.
I imagine that's probably one of the main reasons that they are having to redesign the whole phone for a 5t release. Instead of keeping the design the same like from 3 to 3t. But I'm glad they are though. It was the only thing keeping me from a 5.
I don't think you are lying or anything I'm just saying every op5 refreshes the wrong direction. If you can't see it then it's no big deal.
Every single op5 has it it's just a matter of if you notice it or not. If you don't notice it that's awesome. But every single screen refreshes the wrong way.
I see that on my og xl. But I don't use my device at 45 degree angle like ever though. So I've literally never been bothered by this..
That doesn't mean they shouldn't just fix it in their next phone. It's an issue that didn't need to exist in the first place.
Jelly scrolling and not very good camera are what is typically brought up
That's what's funny, this is just too much money for this bs. At least at Nexus 5 prices you could just say that Google had to cut corners and you're getting a cheaper phone. You can't say that at $900 lol
Yeah that's a huge bummer. I'm most likely getting the 3xl next year and I'll have to bite the bullet on no headphone jack then unfortunately.
If I still had the 6p I would be upgrading to the 2xl if I hadn't got the free upgrade to the og xl.
On what phone?
Basically the perfect storm of shitty phones lol
I believe that's literally "the joke".
I thought the storage controller or something went bad, I can't remember but there were wide spread issues.
I tagged you "king of the world" to remind me of your expert titanic knowledge in the future.
>being on the news for a massive breach?

"We refuse to believe something like can/will happen to us and will take no preventative measures"
Can you share how you configured it to do that? Your setup sounds like exactly how I want it. Thanks!
I wouldn't risk it. It's out of spec in some regard.
But this just happened recently on Facebook, OP said so.
How often do you use the fast charger that came with the phone?
My girlfriend surfs a lot and is obsessed with eating saltines while in bed. Both of these things are my life...
You are now a moderator of /r/relationships 
Oops you're right. That's what I get for redditing with a severe head cold on a bunch of nyquil lol
Damn that's a bold move with all the problems people have been having with the 6p.
I'm probably exaggerating a bit but I would imagine it's a pretty large majority.
Or any car in any country made in the last 10 years..
She did say it's more than 50% in the video..
After seeing the choices they made with the Pixel 2 I honestly have lost most of my faith and would not be surprised at a move like that. Never in a million years would I have thought google would remove something like a headphone jack after blindly following apple.
That was honestly one of the most frustrating parts for me. Lemme guess, the Pixel 3 has wireless charging and they're going to tout it like it's some new magical feature? Jesus this whole thing is frustrating.
Feel free to post them and put me in my place, I don't mind. I'm assuming they're all upvoted a decent amount since it's such a popular opinion among fanboys? 
>Pixel fanboys are defending the Pixel 2/Pixel 2 XL by saying it's impossible to fit the headphone jack and speakers down there

This is the biggest lie/strawman that I've heard on this sub.
I've yet to literally see anyone defending googles choices for these reasons. Every. Single. Time someone defends the remove of the jack it is because they don't use it and don't give a fuck that it's being removed. 

I personally do not hold those views and do not want it removed. But not a single person is saying it for the reasons that you are saying. Your argument is like textbook strawman and very disingenuous. 
It's just frustrating they took it that way. They easily could have doubled down and had ad campaigns making fun of dongles.
I remember how absurd 8gbs seemed even at the time..
Man that makes me almost sad :(

That is the exact configuration of Pixel 2 I was thinking of getting though lol. I think panda is overrated because this phone will always be in a case for me.
It was amazing. You bought a Fucking phone and it didn't feel like you were getting ripped off.
It's about money. If you can't explain it then it's about money.
Very true and also disappointing.
Strange the blade steel isn't listed..
I'm also assuming a pretty big step up in battery just due to the 835 being more efficient. But I guess we need to wait and see for that.
I believe the store is currently sold out of several of the models lol
OIS is just hardware though? I don't believe you can turn it off, it just IS.
Maybe that girl on stage had Parkinson's?
Welcome to ordering a Google product on launch day.
upgrade leaked a couple weeks ago, yes there's a trade in. IP67 resistant and no headphone jack
No jack on either phone.
So the home and the pixel book have one but the devices we put in our fucking pocket don't? I love that logic.
I think that happens every year lol
but jesus fucking christ that pricetag for it..
Google put AUX on The Google home Max! lol But I thought the headphone jack is dead?
I agree that it was back then too. But there's an obvious resurgence if the latest galaxy/notes and the latest Iphones have it. I want the option for both. There's no need to omit wireless charging just because you have usb C fast charging. 
With scores hidden and only 10 minutes after he posted that comment, how the fuck could you know or not know the amount of people getting the reference? 
It's a flagship feature when compared to other phones in it's price range (note/iphone). So yes, it is compromising relative to its direct competition. Watch google lag behind a year and Pixel 3 has glass back.
I understand having compromises, but you can't charge top dollar for it with big compromises imo
Hopefully that's yours :O
I can't remember who won it but I remember that has been the same dude both of the two last years lol. I actually hope it's him again.
I'd tell them my birthday before I told them my current salary.
I wasn't even going off until this great line from him lol:

>So quit alluding to people lying about their problems because you have no idea.

What you said is definitely true. My only point is that if shutting off at 15-30% was bearable 5 months ago then I guess it still should be. I couldn't live with that shut off back then, so I started seeking resolutions and that's when I started to follow this sub more closely, and start doing multiple 6p for 6p RMAs. I think Google started to filter out the "free pixel upgrade bandwagoners" by starting to only take care of people who had RMA'd in the past or had multiple RMAs. This isn't proven but I've yet to see someone mention past RMAs who wasn't helped out by google.
Yup last year's thread was so fucking hyped.
I just know the xl will get better battery life. That's just way too important of a metric to me now. Everyone cares about different things though I guess.
What? No way. Doing a live listen in the main thread along with everyone just like last year and the year before. Last year's thread was so much fun.
I mean, they have machines that allow you to enter another person's dream..
My heart was racing the first time I watched it and the car wouldn't start when they are trying to escape and have to push it down the hill. I love how quiet that scene is too. Such an intense moment and there's very little sound in that scene.

But headphones in bed? And showing someone a funny video real quick? These scenarios do pop up for me a few times per week.
Very good points. I guess I don't see how a suicide would reflect poorly on them? Not giving him help or support or something? I'm just spitballing not trying to refute your points. No matter the cause, I feel terribly for his family. I only mentioned it because just the fact of *not* revealing it kind of makes a inquisitive person like myself raise an eyebrow.
So pretty shitty all around then I guess..
I still have never used it because the scenario you described happen like twice already to me. I need to go to a store that is like completely empty and attempt again just to get my confidence in AP up lol.
I never alluded to people lying about their problems. Only if they hadn't waited so long to seek a resolution they might be in a different spot right now. Like myself, or many others who have literally be discussing this problem for months on this sub. I'd shut that shit down too if I was google as soon as an extreme influx of people 'all of a sudden' call in now that they are doing upgrades. Do you see what I'm saying? Like *now* that they are doing upgrades the problems are bad enough to call in. I'm not saying you or anyone else never experienced problems. Just that somehow they are bearable until google starts doing upgrades? c'mon man
How does that happen? I'm assuming it was out of the blue freak accident kind of thing? He seemed normal on all his recent videos and communications..
Oh damn well that's terrible timing, sorry man. A lot of us have been having these issues for 6+ months, hence all the people who went through 4+ refurbished 6ps.
All I'm saying is as soon as the problems got almost unbearable (several months ago) I went to this sub looking for answers. That's where I of course found out that google had been replacing 6p's with refurb 6ps. Then it became known that they had basically run out of 6p refurbs and started doing pixel upgrades.
You made me just realize that I've been an android enthusiast since 2008. Damn where does the time go?
Yeah me too, Idk why that thought just destroys me
I was asking why you hadn't tried to replace your phone before a week or two ago. Did it just start happening or had it been happening?
There's no need for anyone anywhere to experience this kind of shit. Boils my blood that someone would do this
Can I ask why? I think one of the main reasons google stopped doing it was BECAUSE people started to bandwagon when they found out about the Pixel replacements without ever having a problem somehow until the Pixel replacements. I haven't heard any stories from people who had multiple 6p replacements and THEN couldn't still get a Pixel.
The s6 on marshmellow in a low signal area is one of the most insane standby drains I've ever seen in my life. Got much better on Nougat but yeah, overall the s7 was a much needed jump up.
What's the latest version of Play Services?
Yup. I'm assuming some sort of native theming
How many RMAs had you done prior to this one?
All I want the next pixel to be is the same as current gen but with an 835 and waterproofing. That's apparently way too much to ask for.
I had heard rumors about them still giving it to people with warranties but wasn't sure how substantiated they were. I got my XL very early on when it hadn't blown up yet on even r/android let alone blogs/media. Thank god I was following the 6p sub so closely or I would have missed the boat.
yeah you know me
But not an advantage to buying the warranty. So to sum this all up: Buy from the Google store but don't buy the warranty.
Especially when the top comment is credit to the artist with links. Seriously fuck the photographer in this scenario.
For me it's the feel of the handle material compared to g10. The actual material is way more important to me than the color
Is there a way to make the HDR+ setting stick so that it's just "on" when you open the camera? It defaults to auto and it annoys the shit out of me.
Yeah the "rumor" for both of the new Pixels is no headphone jack
Wow that looks really nice
Abstract Cable Management 
There's absolutely no possibility of this phone being an "affordable" option. They are not going to hesitate to price it like the Iphone X and the Note 8.
No one ever talks about that when they talk about the 6p to Pixel XL upgrades. But that was honestly one of the first things I noticed. The 6p's sensor and/or algorithm was fucking awful. Like it had some huge delay sometimes for no reason.
This would be the only scenario to make me want to switch to monthly payments from paying outright for the whole phone. A fully insured phone with automatic yearly upgrades would be my dream come true. God I hope Google is reading this.
They left a rug for you? All my places have been empty when I moved in...
I'm still bitter about them closing down irvine amphitheater. Probably will be for a while.
We got lucky by buying it from Google. Tons of people got screwed by going through a 3rd party. I'm stoked I got my free upgrade buy I definitely feel for the people left out.
I also had a 6p and have to agree. After how they handled the situation there's literally no way I would ever purchase another product from them.
I am still FIRMLY in the camp that thinks "squeezable sides" is extremely gimmicky.
That's exactly why I would never finance any phone..
This would be my best guess as well.
I completely understand your perspective. But you can't imagine any scenarios where having the jack could come in handy? My point would be, what does it take away from your experience to just have the jack on your phone? There's literally no trade off for someone like you. There's no reason to not have both bluetooth AND the jack. 
I agree but I still can't understand why in 2017 we have to have compromised flagships. Stereo speakers, headphone jack, water proof, should all just be default on every expensive flagship now.
Those two might be the problem with mine. I guess I'll have to do some testing
I've actually never thought about it from that perspective. That very well may be part of it.
So no Bluetooth, and did you have good signal the whole day?
That's exactly my point. If the person in front of me is a dick I have no problem torpedoing the entire transaction for both of us.
Damn I don't know what I'm doing wrong but at least I went from 2.5 hours sot to 4 hours sot. Still a really nice improvement. I work in a bad signal area I wonder if that would account for only getting 4 hours sot.
There's no "fuck you" if you're driving in the proper lane. 
But how hard is a card to figure out? This isn't setting up wifi on a fucking iphone, this is sliding a piece of plastic through a plastic slot..
I combat that by putting all of my groceries up against the person in front of me so now the cashier has no idea whose groceries belongs to who. If you're gonna fuck with me I'll take you down too lol.
Oh really? Wow that would be awesome. Maybe they'll add a native .NET library for it too. 
I work for one of the 10 most populated counties in the United states and we still have several Windows 2000 servers, and even more 2003. LOL
Luckily most of my circle of friends dropped SC like the watery shit that it is as soon as IG stories became competitive. 
You park on the grass in your front yard?
Their policy HAS changed and they are definitely tightening down on the amount of pixel xl replacements they are now doing. It used to be very easy like 2 weeks ago. Now, being on Fi and having the replacement coverage seem to help.
Even though the 5x and 6p are 64bit devices, I'd imagine that they will get relatively much less support than the 820/821 generation. Both qualcomm and google are aware of how shitty the 810 generation was, and would like to see it die off asap.
I buy so much shit on amazon I just saved a box in anticipation. Either that or spend $5 at the ups store.
THAT'S JUST TIT DIRT
Isn't the ability to update when an issue is found like Software Security 101?
A nexus 5 with good battery and good camera. That's what dreams are made of.
It was all a timing thing also. The 6p could have been much better had Qualcom not had such a shit year. My god the 810 and 808 were disasters. 
There was no system wide on screen keyboard before 1.5. The only onscreen keyboards were built into apps.
Oh you mean [Iroc Z](https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iMj.iS8aRTzY/v2/800x-1.jpg)? Yeah my dad had one when I was growing up.
Best of luck to you bro. Sorry that you didn't get in under the wire in terms of when they were still replacing phones. As soon as they started doing it I jumped on it because I knew it wouldn't last. I've had mine for ~2 weeks
Yup I just used another random Amazon box from something had been shipped to me recently.
It doesn't hurt to try. I would assume it increases your chances if you've had issues in the past. Also having the nexus protect seems to increase chances as well. I'm not sure if they are still currently doing any Pixel upgrades
Definitely. Yeah, that's the problem with the battery swap. It basically just buys the phone more time it seems. Tons of stories of battery swapped phones and RMA'd replacement phones still having the issues. Every 6p is like a ticking time bomb lol
Thanks for the advice, will do!
I didn't feel the need to respond to the rest of your comment when I made mine, wasn't purposefully trying to ignore it or something. But  I do understand what you are saying about the flooding and helping friends could definitely tie up some money. Luckily this is just an authorization and not a full charge so my point is it just doesn't matter if you have the money or not. The only point I want to make is that I think they're good for a bad situation (or multiple bad situations happening at once). All they do is buy you a small bit of time until you can secure whatever funds you need. I also think the auth charge was there for maybe 3 or 4 days at most? It went away as soon as USPS scanned my 6p in return mail.
For real. I can't complain after walking away completely unscathed
She must have braked, and it was a hair less than that because it was perfectly t-boned. She was trying to make it through the light and it's a 45mph street, so there's no way she was going under 30-35. Here's the zoomed out pic and it shows front of her car. https://imgur.com/v5zvj2V
Got t-boned by a girl running a red light this morning. Felt like maybe she was going 40ish? Her steering wheel airbag deployed. I'm fine, just a little headache, but just thought that would have been enough to deploy the side airbags?
Damn, you almost made the free XL cutoff but not quite. Glad you had the square trade though. You would have been shit out of luck without that.
I got used to the little stutters on the 6p. Once you use an 821 and 4 gigs a ram you'll instantly notice the difference. I know it's a thing everyone says, but the pixel is just really smooth.
Seems like this is a good example of when it's nice to have one. Even if it only floats you till your next payday or until you can get money moved. I never pay interest on any of my credit cards because they never hold a balance for any amount of time. Still get all the cash back bonus points for every single purchase I make though ;-)
Are you not aware of exchange rates? You think usd is 1:1 to canadian dollar? I see this argument all the time when people from australia and canada comment on their prices. Yes, sometimes they are inflated even above the normal exchange inflation but sometimes they are exactly the same. 
I'm in the same boat. OVER-advertising *is* a thing. I'm not sure that they understand this.
How is it possible your s7e doesn't have 7.0 right now? I was pretty sure every single variant across all carriers had 7.0 months ago? My girlfriend's VZW s7 got it forever ago..
Thanks mkbhd!
No headphone jack and only an 835 isn't worth over $900 to me personally. You pretty much have to give me a no compromises phone to get me to spend that kind of money. I realize this is subjective.
The prices for the pixel never really came down all that much. I'm afraid the pixel 2 will be no different
That is correct and what I'm currently seeing as I use my Pixel XL replacement.
Wait until the phone is released and it can be thoroughly tested. Until then, worrying about it is pointless.
Bugs life was big but died, I feel like wall e was never even big at the time.
Me too. It's basically warning for my gf to stop looking at her phone and hold on because I'm about to pull some shit
So it's just retarded logic all around then?
The floodgates weren't opened until it blew up on r/android and in media/blogs.
Where were you two weeks ago when it hit this sub that Google was doing this? You waited until it blew up here, blew up in r/android, then blew up in media/blog/websites. It got so big that everybody and their mother was trying to get a free Pixel including scummy fuckers on swappa trying to use this problem to literally make a profit. Of course Google closed it down now. You gotta get in while the getting is good.
It blew up on this sub, then r/android, then media/blogs. I had no problems getting a Pixel while it was still blown up on this sub only. I'm just glad I was following this sub closely and caught on to what was happening and jumped on fast.
As soon as I saw that happening I knew google would shut it down quick. Scummy motherfuckers trying to literally profit off of this problem will always ruin it for the rest of everyone. 
How important was storage size in any of the things you mentioned?
That was 3 days ago, and two of those aren't even "business days". Why would you be worried about that?
Oreo has been a decent update for sure. For me it feels more like an "alley-oop" of an update though. Like it's really setting up 8.1 to be even that much better. We've seen this a few times with Android updates over the years. 4.0 and 5.0 come to mind. I'm actually really excited about what 8.1 could have. (themeing)
I live in OC. I ran out of tissues and tears a long time ago.
"It hurts my penis when I urinate"
Really? If so, then I guess whoosh on my part. I actually thought that he was being genuine when he said he doesn't get subtle humor lol.
This isn't subtle humor.
lollipop in general wasn't a very good or stable version of android. 
Don't you need nfc for payment apps?
Yeah, I credit card. Which you should hopefully have, and hopefully it's not maxed out to the point where you don't have an extra grand headroom...
That's not how an Auth hold works...
I sent mine USPS and the Auth lifted as soon as they scanned it the next day (I dropped it off after hours).
You don't notice a big difference in smoothness going from 6p to Pixel XL? That was honestly one of the things I noticed immediately. The 6p has always been decently "fast". But I would never have described it has "smooth". Even before the Pixel even launched.
Yeah I think I'm going to ride out the next year of software updates and get the XL 3. The current XL is still just really good. 
Of course they don't. It was a profit driven decision. Plain and simple. You own a large share of the cell phone market, and a share of the BT headphone market. You just force people from one of your markets to buy from the other market. You double dip on your customers lol.
I don't know what that second image is but it looks good
If 8.1 is just theming and backup I'll be stoked
This is exactly correct. They are bullshitting 
When I did mine 2 weeks ago I had to specifically ask for it. 
Yup, I miss the speakers. But my god is it nice to not have battery problems and have a phone that's smooth and fast and lasts all day.
You're not answering my question and I couldn't find the answer in the link at first glance. Why would adding OIS not improve on top of EIS's ability? You are saying it can't, and I want to know why.
At the same time,

Including a headphone jack for people that only that use BT 99% doesn't make their phone any worse and they won't even notice it or really mind it. It makes more sense to keep it, than to take it away.
I don't see how you are proving that it can't get even better with OIS added. You're only proving that EIS on it's own is suitable. Why wouldn't adding OIS make it THAT much better?
I don't know if 8 hours is good or bad without at least one point of reference. 
That was before there was this post fully blew up. I'm so glad I got mine taken care of last week. They are starting to deny XL upgrades because of the influx of calls.
I'm so glad I got my XL upgrade before this hit the front page of r/android. 
Yup. Once this hit the front page and thousands of people are calling for a free upgrade, it seems that may have caused them to stop doing it. Weird, lol.
Oh I agree 100%. They just said that to deter people from doing a free 6p upgrade. They don't have the ability to test to see if the phone is broken.
I can't help but be blunt in my response to your comment.


Do you know how insane it sounds to discount the phone and camera app of the pixel all because of an *extreme* and very *specific* use case, that 99% of the general population does not need or want? 

A very large majority of people have no need for long exposure photography. That's a fact. If you need it, that's great, but you'll need to get phones that focus on that kind of thing because most mainstream phones could give a shit.
Yeah I don't know how that works if you bought it from someone who has purchased it through the play store. But I'm not scummy enough to leave comments on every single 6p for sale on swappa asking if it was purchased from the play store. People can't just be happy google is doing this, they have to literally try to profit from the situation. Fucking sucks.
What's funny is I tried to get a refund for mine a couple months back and they said no. But I called again 1.5 weeks ago and they had no problems doing the Pixel XL upgrade lol. I did have to deal with the battery bug on my 6p for an extra couple months, which did suck.
Yup returning a 1.5 year old used phone and getting a brand new upgraded phone is an incredible deal.
This kind of "taking advantage" is the exact thing that will get this whole thing closed down for everyone. If you look at the 6p Swappa page, this is currently happening. It is the literal perfect example of "a few people will ruin something nice for everyone".
It's almost like a bunch of people want to buy up 6p's bought from the google play store and then upgrade them to pixel xl's for free....
From my experience that's not how the hold works. It clears once USPS scans your returned 6P. So unless they are changing that, then I don't know what they'll do..
Sounds like a bluff to me. If they could test for the draining people currently wouldn't be holding devices that they received as RMA's that had the bug. I understand you are only telling what you heard, but it just reeks of BS imo just to stop people from doing the free upgrade.
You need to mention it specifically shuts off early say something like 30 to 50 percent.
That friend told me that his battery was the stock one. But he said he would still try it anyway
No you'd need to literally mention the early shutdown
Damn that's kind of lame since it is a brand new device and not a refurb... But I can't be too mad being upgraded to it for free.
Meaning the XL has a total of 3 months of warranty when you get it? Or like 1 year + 3 months? or something else?
That's what I would do if I had a nice phone to use in the meantime like you do (S8+ is a damn nice phone). I had to use the XL when it came because I have no other option.
I kinda lucked out in that regard. I tried to get a refund 2 months ago and they wouldn't do it lol. But they had no problem upgrading me to a brand new XL two weeks ago.
What was the downfall of the Nexus 9, was it the K1? I can't really remember much about it but I thought the specs were ok on paper.
This is the message it showed on screen: https://imgur.com/9l47RJW

That's not the restart message. If you are saying that it has changed for IOS 11 then link to proof. If what you are saying is correct, they completely removed the "passcode required after restart" message on IOS 11?
But why didn't it give the error message saying that you need to put in the passcode because your phone was rebooted? It's a completely different error message.
Jesus that's scary. 
Not in my opinion or this subs opinion, but that doesn't mean they wouldn't try it. The only other reason they could use would be thinness which seems crazy also because the last few phones from Google haven't had an issue with thinness. So in my mind, they have no excuse to not put one in, so we'll have to wait and see what they say.
Idk about anyone else but whenever I see one I uncontrollably yell, "BICYCLE TIRES!". Annoys the shit out of my gf.
But I specifically asked to never be told that.
It's definitely going to have ip certification. They're going to drop the headphone jack and blame it on the ip certification. Which is obviously bs
Came from a 6p so I can really relate to this joke lol.
Oh wow really? I actually hope Android copies that
I've thought about the reboot for cops before. I'll have to remember to do that in the future for airport security. Thanks for the tip
I think middle of the back is superior to the s8 design. Only downside is when it's on a desk or table.
Cheap, unreliable, short lifespan before breaking. Idk read the reviews of some of them but that's what I saw at first glance. I don't have multiple QI devices so I've never considered getting one.
I was saying TIL on the actual definition. Not the fucking misspelling.
If you are under arrest, quickly reboot your phone lol
With a warrant I believe but yes. They can pretty much do anything to you with the right warrant. A cop can't just force you to unlock your phone at a traffic stop.
The reader on the back of my 6p and pixel xl is way WAY above 85%. It looks to me like it failed during the demo based on the error message that it gave.
Yes they exist, you can get them on amazon. I don't think they are very good though. Surely not on the quality level the airpower mat will be. I believe the watch is but the airpods aren't. You have to put them in the little charging case for them to wirelessly charge, you can't just put them on the mat by themselves.
There's no "restart" specific message anymore? Just the generic one shown after it failed on stage? It doesn't make sense why they would get rid of the restart error message
That would be amazing lol because the dude has an 11 year old account.
Hack your friends face!
Wouldn't it mean that if OP is correct, that for some reason unknown, Apple merged the error messages for touchid failure and for passcode after restart? That doesn't seem likely to me because having separate specific messages to the user is extremely helpful in both cases.
I guess that's true, I wonder why they wouldn't just incorporate it into the apple logo on the back. That would actually be kind of cool.
Really? I thought I heard they were doing it for some other countries also, but probably not all. I know Canada and the UK were getting Pixels.
Do what exactly? Be big enough to charge multiple devices?
Yup and all my metal backed phones have been in a case for their entirety so it ends up not even mattering..
Fingerprint scanners have gotten so fast and convenient that it seems like such a dumb move to get rid of it now. I know I wouldn't want to go back to a phone that didn't have a good one (or at all) now.
I guess they could have put it on the back but they would have taken so much heat for a blatant copy of a bunch of android phones that I'm sure they decided not to.
My girlfriend is absolutely brutal with the usb port on her phone after getting off of a 12 hour shift. She basically goes full cave woman and tries to just jam the usb into it. Getting her a wireless charging pad has been a godsend for her lol.
Wow til
Yup Google handled the battery issues on the 6p amazingly well now. You could have a year and a half old 6p and you can send it in for a free brand new xl as long as you bought from the play store. Google saved me from buying a phone this year.
Which is what Google did to the 5x back in the day IMO.
You are still smarter than me. I put my nexus 5 on the roof of my car and drove away. Granted I was on about 2.5 hours of sleep and had just finished working out at the gym so I was a little delirious at the time.
Say your phone shuts down between 30-50% sometimes for no reason. Tell them you have already tried factory resetting the device. They can't prove that you have or haven't ever experienced the problem.
Yeah RMA'd twice before I got the Pixel XL on the 3rd rma
I'm assuming just on that card that they originally authorized on. It was way too quick for them to check the phone in my case. 
Is financing a phone really that common (in the US)? I don't know a single person irl that has financed a phone out of all my family and friends. Everyone has bought outright..
No my phone was physically fine, I was talking about battery problems specifically sorry.
Yeah I remember feeling the same way. But luckily as soon as usps scanned my 6p I got an email saying that Google "Received" it and the authorization went away.
umm let's just say I can confirm that they don't check...
Each.
There's a point during the initial setup that says if you want to set up the pixel new or from a backed up account. It prompts you to plug another phone directly into the pixel if you want to do a cable transfer. You just use the included cable to connect both phones then and it walks you through the process on both phone screens. Super easy and seems to be the best way. I've used the download account over the air in the past but I don't remember it getting everything like sms.
Yup 5.0 was notoriously bad. 5.1 fixed a lot of it but 6 is when I really felt it was fixed.
I tried the cable transfer for the first time and it was insanely easy (even moved sms). Just a heads up.
Not trying to start a war lol, but is there any particular reason you like Sacramento? 
I had to literally ask for a pixel xl as replacement. I'm in the US though, but they tried to give me a 6p at first.
Wow that was even easier than what I went through. The guy initially tried to replace my 6p with another one. Which I refused and he asked me what I'd like to do. That's when I told him I wanted a Pixel XL as replacement. He was basically making me come out and say it myself. But whatever though because I'm now using my new Pixel so it's all good I guess. It's just weird how the conversations seem to vary so much.
My brother graduated this year from Sac State and I visited multiple times over the last couple years. Did I mention how much I hated Sacramento too? lol I'd probably go with OC>LA>Sacramento and I don't really like living in OC
This has always been a meme. It's the same as the "You da real MVP" meme from Kevin Durant. 
>Was it due to poor security practices and shit that anyone should've caught?

I don't think anything has been 100% verified but I think this is *very* safe to assume..
Wasn't the first pixel available on all carriers? What's to say the second one will not be like that?
Agreed, I live in OC (and hate it) but I of course hate LA even more.
This sounds like a job for the current CISO. But don't say anything bad about her because if you do, you hate women in tech.
>implying OP isn't mac and cheese
At least it's in the ballpark of being near the ocean. Makes sense if we ever see cheap desalination in our lifetime. A place like phoenix makes infinitely less sense than LA.
I don't know their exact polices either, but I figure the buck stops with the CISO either way.
Wouldn't she be in charge of policy preventing this from happening? Assuming it was an outdated framework that was the issue
Wasn't the effect "proven" more or less slow motion video? At least that's what I remember. If you can't see it in daily life then that's great, but I do think some people are sensitive to it and can see it in daily use. Either way the screen *does* refresh the opposite way of most other phone displays. 
True, but you should have some sort of card on file, which is what I'm referring to. If you can't match the 40 cents difference on either a credit card or debit card, you are in serious financial trouble lol.
Why do you want to upgrade if you love your phone so much? The obvious choice would be wait for the Pixel 2 imo
I think he's talking about brand new, which they hopefully will drop a bit on 3rd party sites. Yeah I'm not sure if Google will have price drop the original Pixel.
Well, they'll have stock of them that they'll want to clear out. Plus all the people getting rid of their lightly used ones to get a Pixel 2. Either way I would wait to see what the Pixel 2 brings. 
Yup in the same boat. What an upgrade. It really puts the speed and battery life of the 6p into perspective when you are using an XL. The SD810 is every bit as bad as people say it is.
Yeah Pixel XL is the obvious choice in this scenario. Both for camera and for the "Need it to last two years".
If you do not have the 40 cents in your checking account, or 40 cents headway on a credit card, you have other financial issues you should be worried about instead of theming your phone lol.
>IT for 19 years

> I'd run circles around almost any recent college graduate within most IT disciplines

Jesus Christ dude I'd hope so. I don't care what degree or field you're in, if you have 19 years experience in that field you sure as fuck better be more knowledgeable than any recent grad. 

>If she could perform the role they needed, then she was a good candidate

..Sooo she wasn't a good candidate?
You could do \s?[hH][lL]3\W 

But then again I'm bad at regex
Yeah it's true that feature wise, stock has been slow to catch up. All the little things are finally being added it seems. Large battery percentage in status bar, reboot in power menu, split screen apps, and I believe 8.1 will bring native theming. These are things I've always rom'd for or I guess you could have bought a Samsung device a couple generations ago.
I've always wondered if all the battery problems might be related to the 6p's fast charger that came with the phone? It might be a combo of the battery quickly degrading when using that charger, and then when the battery gets to a certain point of degradation, it starts doing the early shutoff. That's my theory anyways. Meaning anytime I received a 6p as an RMA it was only delaying the inevitable. 

 I'm just glad to be off of the 6p and on a brand new XL. 
Plague relative to them. It removes some of their control. Which can be seen as a bad thing (to them).
Shaking hands.

 Really? The best way to greet someone is to touch their hand with cum, shit, and piss all over it? Fuck shaking hands. What's the matter with just friendly verbally greeting someone?
There's just something good about the hardware and software (at the time) combo on the N5. They just hit some magical mark with speed and device smoothness. Especially for the release price.
Reddit has been mainstream since Obama's AMA (you could make arguments it was mainstream even before that). That was five years ago lol.
Thanks for the hard work. Gonna be so great to have once it's finished
Probably won't drop till pixel 2 comes out officially. I just got a pixel xl as a free upgrade to my 6p and I've been loving it so far. I see zero reason this phone won't last at minimum another year.
Divorce her immediately. ^^^I'm ^^^kidding ^^^lmao
I'm legit curious as to who told you all this? I hope you don't consider this person to be friend or family because they bold-faced lied right to you.
I got a 4 pack of red bull because of some bs redbull lawsuit years ago.
...roll credits
Can I just say how much I fucking hate the subscription model for most apps?
http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/21/android-o-feature-spotlight-battery-percentage-indicator-cant-placed-icon-anymore/

There's an AP article about it. I know it's about O beta but that's how it is in Android O final too.
That's what I'm saying is good in Oreo. It's no longer so small and inside the battery icon. I can't believe it took stock android this long for it to happen.
My fucking university turned off our emails less than 6 months after graduating. 
Anytime a family or friend want a new android phone, I basically just always recommend the latest Galaxy S device. Even though I wouldn't get one for myself. It's just easier that way and the last two years of galaxy phones have been perfect for the average user.
Even brand new I wasn't ever really impressed with the 6p's performance. So glad to get off the 810 also. 821 should work great for another year at least.
Agreed, I think just on the merit that it does not have the SD810 it will have much more longevity as a device. 
oh I agree the device without a doubt has issue(s). I think that's the only reason we're seeing this kind of treatment. It's pretty cool to use a device for 1.5 years then be upgraded to a brand new phone that is next year's model. I am going to use it until the Pixel 3 next year then definitely make the purchase through the playstore after this experience. I think the Pixel Xl should be good enough to last me the next year.
It's just awesome buying a new phone, using it for a year and a half, then sending it in for a brand new phone that is the next year's model for free. Google is saving me from needing to spend $700+ this year. I see no reason whatsoever that a Pixel XL won't last me until the Pixel 3 next year since it is guaranteed updates for at least another year and the hardware is still decent.
Yup that's the thing that a lot of people are really struggling to understand. This is more of a store issue than a device issue that google is handling. 
Thanks!
What icon pack? Looks nice
But what is he named?
I used to root just to have battery percentage and a restart option. Thank god those are finally stock.
Luckily I have a very strong feeling that a full theme engine is going to be a headline feature of 8.1 stock android. It seems that 8.0 really laid the groundwork for it. I guess we'll wait and see though.
Don't worry, there's a bunch of angry people in /r/Nexus6P that have also learned that lesson. I admit that it was pure luck that I bought it from Google. I could have just as easily bought it from somewhere else for the same price.
Yeah I'm dead serious lol. Unfortunately you have to have bought it from the play store for google to help you. Otherwise replacing your battery is the only other option which I'm told takes like 45 minutes and isn't too terribly hard.
The s6 standby battery drain is such a huge glaring flaw that I just can't look past it. 
If you own a 6p that you bought directly from the google play store, and you are getting early battery shutdowns, you can call them and request an upgrade to a brand new pixel xl. So I was able to turn in my black 32 gig 6p that is  1.5 years old for a brand new black 32gig pixel XL free of charge. There's just a hold on your credit card for the amount of the pixel xl until they receive your 6p.

They told me at first that they were going to replace it with another 6p, which they've done twice already. I told them that was unacceptable and that I didn't want another 6p.

visit /r/Nexus6P for more info
shout out to the 6p to pixel xl free upgrade crew! :)
(!logic)
gotcha. Well that is good news about performance. Luckily I have a black xl on its way, not really a fan of the white or the non-xl size so I totally feel you on that.
I think the only thing I disagree on is the (rear mounted) finger print reader. After using it every day, it becomes a huge convenience to unlocking your phone quickly. Like I'm not even talking about the whole security aspect, just literally unlocking your phone very fast.

I bought a 6p (which I hated). Terrible performance and battery life. Luckily google upgraded me for free to a new pixel xl so I'm hoping that at least solves some of the performance and battery problems I was having. 6p was already the top of my budget, so there's no way I was going to buy a pixel outright. The price of a 128gig xl is literally absurd.
Of course! anytime
How did that not break any sort of company policy to become a fire-able offense?
My guy last night tried to give me another 6p and I said I don't want it. I told him I wanted an XL. He took a couple minutes to get approved and then sent me the link.
I'm assuming his whole family has 6ps or something and he rma'd all at once? Idk though

*edit: forgot word
How's the battery life and SOT? I've got a brand new XL on it's way to my house right now. As long as it's still smooth and can get decent SOT I'm gonna be stoked for at least until the Pixel 3.
annnnd now I'm feeling even better about having a brand new Pixel XL on it's way to my house right now.
I still do not understand why we can't have both? Having EIS isn't an excuse for not having OIS. Just apply the EIS to the output after it has already been stabilized by OIS. I will keep ranting this until someone in the know tells me that it isn't technically possible. Until then, this makes perfect logical sense to me.
I must be *REALLY* new.
Also make sure they have better benefits. That insurance seems high..
Depends on how you feel about ethics imo. You can call them and say your new 6p has early battery shutdown at ~40%. Which will start another case to open, which then you can say that you can't trust a 6p any longer and if they ask you what you want, say the only device you're willing to exchange your phone for is the Pixel XL. I personally have no ethical problem with that, because your new phone WILL eventually start to act up, and you are just taking measures to insure you have a phone that will not have problems in the future. That is how I choose to look at it, if that is scummy, then I couldn't care less.
Is your 6p replacement already being processed? If it is you'll need to wait. If not, then yeah you should call back and say you don't want another 6p because you can't trust it.

They tried to do that to me and I said that I do not want another 6p. He asked what I wanted and I said pixel XL. He put me on hold to get it approved I'm assuming and then said that I was good to go. Sent me a link to finalize the order for a brand new pixel XL.
How many rmas on your 32gig 6p did it take to get the pixel XL?
I police the fappers, I don't empower them! 😁
I just accidentally downloaded a picture of your kid. Now I feel like a creep. Damn my fat fingers.
Not me lol. If that's the case I'll just pick a used one up for 500 in like a month and a half.
Yeah apparently it's been that way for years. I've had people correct me and now I am actively refusing to call them "Rams" now. That's a fucking Dodge.
Ok, will try this asap. I will not give up! lol
Short term MSFT would be like 69 or 70 I think? But yeah I wouldn't try to time the market on a long play. Just try to jump in the next time it's red.
hmm good to know, I'm going to keep trying!
Yeah I'm eyeballing that as a replacement also. But other than that maybe the v30 or the Pixel 2 (if it has a headphone jack). I severely regret getting a 32 gig now. From what I've seen on this sub it is much easier to get a refund with a 64 or 128 gig. I just want the same options as everyone else since my problems are the exact same problems as everyone else. Really frustrating.
3 rmas? or your 3rd nexus phone? I'm on my 3rd phone (2nd rma) and desperately want out.
How many RMAs did you go through before refund?
Damn well I guess we can rule the number of replacements out as why you got lucky. I guess it just has to do with number of stock or something? I think I might be fucked with a 32 gig.
How many replacements did you go through before getting the pixel?
>I got on the phone, complained for 30 minutes to 3 different people and was authorized a refund.

You got your refund authorized while still on the phone with them? I'm on my 3rd 6p and anytime I push for a refund it gets sent to a supervisor for like 48 hours before being denied. Am I just not pushing hard enough or being rude enough?
You got a call from a guy at google AFTER already receiving your replacement? holy shit.
Holy shit for real? I always assumed he he studied cs but has no idea he had a PhD.
I don't man, sorry. But search around this thread and this sub and you'll find something.
Damn I'll take either option at this point. I just don't want a fucking 6p anymore.

LEAVE BRITNEY ALONE.
If there weren't so many desperate people looking for work, this "truthful" strategy would work every time. 
Preach this shit dude. Fuck companies and recruiters asking for salary history info. Oh this info can ONLY be used to against me, to try and take advantage of me and pay me less? Sure, let me get you my *accurate* current salary real quick...
My most recent background check that I received from a company (can't remember which background checking company, but a large one) only had CC debt, bank account balance, criminal history if any, and any loans (car, student). I couldn't find anywhere on it that had my current/previous w2 salary info listed. I know this was only one background checking company but at least it's one point of data.
unless you have truly exceptional skills, they will most likely leave it. They'll go with a more desperate shmuck. 
Hell if we are going that far just tell them your current salary but include 10 or 15k on top of it. Sure it's a risk but you can get away with it probably 90% of the time
Salary info like that can't help you to tell them in any way. I have no issue lying to them about salary related topics.
I literally have no issue lying when any salary info they get they will actively use against me to pay me less. They can fuck right off asking for that shit.
ples open cloth
32gig?
What size and color of device? How many RMAs did it take to get the refund? Sounds like /u/timthefunnyman would also like to know.
Well he does sound like a nice dude from the context you and others provided. I didn't mean to imply that *he* had mental illness but that it's so chaotic and random it just has that "crazy" feel. I'm stoked to know the guy does it just to make people happy and turn heads though.
> he'd rather be the smartest guy in a game of programming bar trivia than actually feel out candidates well.

I've had this happen to me a few times and it's almost a tangible feeling when it starts to occur. Like I can feel the vibe switch and I think "Ohhh, this guy is now just trying to make a point, it has nothing to do with my experience or even this job." Again it's not the norm from my experience but when it happens you fucking know when it's happening. 
DUDE STOP!


*F5 F5 F5 F5 F5 F5 F5 F5 F5 F5 F5 F5*
It's what mental illness looks like in car-form IMO.

*edit: I didn't mean this to come off as negative as it seems, the owner sounds like a legit nice dude.
oh shit you just reminded me of how fucking good that soup is lol. Now I know where I'm going for dinner..
But you aren't biased right?
It's honestly 50/50 for me with the things from this pack. 
That's so insane to me. Like, you've done nothing for me at all and expect something? Here's a fucking hint, I have ALL of those exact same costs as well.
Thank you!
It's almost funny how far from the truth calling Buzz a coward is. Like he's literally the fucking opposite, making it almost humorous. 
That's disappointing that the pixel 2 won't have the band 71. Oh well I guess. 
>Some kind of solidarity I guess.

Some might say that's the whole point of this sub. It is for me at least :)
Either way that's pretty badass. I would GLADLY go from my 32gb 6p to a 32gb xl if they offered. 
Seeing almost any movie at home with a decent tv and decent sound setup will almost always be something I enjoy more than the theater. I can pause, take a shit, eat amazing food, get drunk, and also just be completely nude the whole time. Not to mention it's cheaper.
Gimmie Gimmie more.
was it a refurb xl or a new one?
Is this possible to flash on a completely stock non-rooted locked 6p with 7.1.2? If so, how?
Insurance companies, medical groups/unions, and retailers all band together to make sure they continue making absurd amounts of money off of us. I would fucking LOVE healthcare more like UK and return policies like the UK, but they would see that change as a *direct* threat to their profits. They have hundreds of millions of dollars to throw around at ease and can make sure shit like that can't be passed as law. I love the US but shit like that is such a glaring flaw in our entire system that it's almost painful to think about.
What phones currently have those new bands or phones on the horizon that will have them?
What phones currently have those new bands or phones on the horizon that will have them?
Jesus, that's about as good of a deal as you could hope for. 
Yes you can. Little scuffs and stuff shouldn't effect it. They only care about large damage, like cracks to screen and such.
I feel like they've been getting stingier and stingier with refunds in the last week or two. Like 3 weeks ago there were a bunch of people able to secure refunds. Now they deliberate after escalation for days on end only to deny you. 
If this shitty nexus 6p experience is anything it's taught me that google only gives a shit if you actually buy from them. I got lucky and just happened to buy mine from them by chance; I could have just of easily bought from any other retailer. I'm on my 2nd RMA at this point but it's only a matter of time before it starts to die also. I feel for you guys who didn't though.
It's still not binary like you made it out to be. It is a spectrum, one that typically correlates to speed of updates and compatibility.
How is "near stock android" not clear?
He's obviously talking about a *very* lightly modified version of android.

>That's not how it works.

uhh, care to explain? Not everything in conversation is completely fucking binary. There's plenty of gray areas to language, where points are still able to be made.
This whole sub would breathe a collective sigh of relief if that was the case. 
I'd jump on a 5t so hard with an 836 and screen that was flipped the right way. That would be an *easy* buy to save a few hundred from the new Pixels. 
Your attitude is way better than the angry posts we will get over the next few months on this sub. It happens every year with Samsung owners.
Maybe 8.1 will be exciting? I guess we'll wait and see. I usually enjoy the .1 changes more than the full major releases. 
I don't believe it is possible to rma through google if you did not buy. Your only option is Huawei which is notoriously bad. I would try to replace battery on my own if I was in your shoes.
Security updates are infinitely easier for them to deploy. It's going to be at least a few months for S8's to get it.
Did you mash the check update button? Even doing that I can't seem to get it. I've never been enrolled on any Betas though
Jesus fuck, mark your comment NSFW
Which is infinitely more easy to add to a release than re-skinning the whole system...
See my response to nexusnerd, but yeah you're right. Rma and battery replacement only buys you some time.
Replacing the battery or rma are both a temporary fix. All 6p batteries seem to degrade faster than other phones. When they degrade past a certain point, the problems seem to start happening. I'm convinced that fast charging speeds this process up. You're only buying yourself time.
I'd be cool with it in the "flags" sections, which is already fully bloated lol.
Wait what does this mean? It's cheaply made?
Doesn't this happen every pixel/nexus release. I'm fairly confident this is probably extremely close looking to what the pixel xl2 looks like.
I wouldn't argue against that. But there's no reason not to add a setting to swap it for left hand use.
I hope they allow it to be swapped to the left side for us southpaws. It's really awkward for left-handers right now.
That may be one of the few legit reasons to own that many, that makes sense lol.
That seems excessive lol. 
I guess I'm not really sure what a "arcade machine core" is. But I know a working arcade cabinet can cost in the $2000-$8000 range according to what I see on google shopping. 3 or 4 of those would be incredibly less expensive than hiring even a single experienced dev. Let alone a couple of them.
>employer thought arcade cabinets would make the engineers more happy. Really, we just needed to actually hire more engineer

One of those things might cost more than the other lol.
Brb, buying all that shit for my one bedroom apartment.
My boss does this on conference calls with people he really doesn't like. If every time he speaks to you, he starts the sentence with your name, he fucking hates you.
One of the only things I miss from pure nexus now that I'm stock.
yeahhh ^^I'm ^^doing ^^the ^^same ^^thing ^^lol


oh ok, gotcha. Just goes to show how little I know
I still don't think I know what it is 3 years after school. Is it basically a Linux task scheduler built into the shell?
>$700, no headphone jack or water resistance, 3040ma battery, Sprint exclusive.

Wtf are they thinking? 
Interesting, I'm just trying to gauge how hard it will be for me to get a refund. I'm only on 1 rma so far, but it sounds like I'll need at least a couple more before my odds are decent. 
I think it's technically possible (I asked, and escalated twice before just giving in and doing an RMA). I think the magic number is 3+ RMAs before your chances go up.
Is this the first time you're asking for a refund?
That was like the pinnacle of the custom ROM Era in my mind. The ROM actually ran really nice too on top of the insanely cool custom options.
Yeah unfortunately a lot of the big changes in O seem to be long-term investment changes. I mean, that's great that Android will be in a much better place in 1.5-2 years, but hopefully we can start seeing some improvement in certain areas immediately after updating. 
Can you clarify that? Every nexus and pixel phone thus far have run a stock version of android.
Your car battery should be able to handle dash cam and phone charging simultaneously. 
Huh? Curl is by far the best professor for 234 (at least back in my day). This stuff you do and follow along in class, is *directly* relevant to the next project. I remember doing basically like 30% of the project in class just by following along and coding with him. If you're struggling you need to do a bit of self study. Watch some youtube videos and maybe mess around with some short online courses.
Yup, can't wait for 8.1! lol
I believe the Pixel's last big update will probably by Android P, or whatever is after O. Seems like nexus and pixels get two major versions then an additional year of just security updates.


Why would we not be getting prototype leaks 3 months out? 
I actually agree, what I said may be be slightly overstated. 
Didn't imply that it was. I wasn't comparing teenage asian girls to douche bags I was correcingt him on who was taking the selfies of their food there.
This is some low effort bullshit of a comment.
How come? I think my gf's lags every once in awhile but my 6p lags at least twice as much so maybe it just seems fast relative to what I use.
I offline a lot of my podcasts and spotify playlists for flights and places I don't get service. Storage is so cheap there's no reason not to.
The s7 and s7edge from last year seemed like the least amount of compromises a phone could have, even now. My gf has one and it's actually aged pretty well.
Yeah I've been trying not to think about that. It just seems so absurd. The "value" is really hard to justify.
Yup. I'm literally in the exact same boat. I'm way too used to the latest updates and stock Android to go anything non pixel at this point.
I feel you man. I've been over my 6p for months. The battery and the lags just wear on me. I'm trying to hold out until we at least know the facts about pixel 2.
What makes me mad is that they are NOT doing it for the consumers benefit. It is only to make their job easier and to make more money. It does not benefit anyone to remove it and no one was asking for it to go away. Like even the people who never used it weren't bothered by it.
If the next pixel even offers 32 gig minimum it will be a joke. It's almost 2018 for fuck sakes. 64gig should be the bare minimum for all phones.
Yeah it seems like most of the 6p sub either will get the next pixel or the current gen at a discount. This phone definitely has not aged too well. We can mostly thank the quickly degrading batteries and terrible SOC for that.
No problem, it's no guarantee but it won't hurt to try! Good luck
Yeah people have gotten refunds with your number of rmas. Just tell them you are sick of this problem and want a refund.
If by douche bags you mean teenage Asian girls, then you are correct.
Not going to try for a refund?
Very true. It's just a pipe dream to think that could be the case
Who isn't catching on that he's gay? It's obvious but isn't relevant so no one mentioned it. Your comment is fucking absurd.
Yup you gotta factor in price to it for sure. If this ends up being a budget version then there is some leniency, but for a premium price there's no forgiveness lol.
Good to know, thanks
Honest question, what stores have it because I really would need to see for myself and I don't have friends who own the device.
It will definitely have water resistance. They are fully copying Iphone at this point. Big and small models, no headphone jack, premium price. It makes perfect sense that this will have water proofing.
Off of Swappa? That seems like a pretty good deal, I'd gladly jump ship from my 6p for that deal
If there wasn't the jelly screen issue on the OP5 I would have pulled the trigger on one so hard. I just know myself and it will bug me because I won't be able to unsee it :(
>As if it's slightly greater than the sum of its parts

The only phone I've ever felt was this way was the Nexus 5. 
Yeah I think I'm done with the 6P. I'm ready to have good battery life again. If it ditches the headphone jack I might just have to deal with it. I'll probably end up buying an adapter for every pair of headphones I have and just keep the adapter attached to the headphones. It's such a lame solution but oh well I guess.
I typically keep my phones until they die but I think I'm going to try to pick up a new one before this one goes (hopefully Pixel 2). I've never had a back up phone and that has burned me twice before in the last couple years. I think the 6p would be an ok backup phone to a Pixel 2. As long as the Pixel 2 has the features I want and really good SOT, I'm probably going to get it.
I just wanted the pixel 2 to be a water proof version of the pixel 1 with an sd836. Apparently this is too much to ask for.
Lol that might just be the reason
Of course not. But for most girls it typically helps just because a lot of girls store fat there. 
I have no backup currently. Not a comforting feeling lol.
Did you not think that's why this was posted?
Yeah I'm really hoping they pull a 3/3T thing with the 5. My savior from the Pixel 2 lacking a headphone jack would be a 5t with a fixed screen. The screen issue is the ONLY reason I'm not jumping to the OP5. I know myself too well and that would just bother me every time. The odds are not good though..
It is extremely common for these girls to have an absurdly amazing rack. Maybe it's being slightly overweight? Idk

*edit: spelling
True, very good points
It just makes their job "easier". Easier to fit other components, easier because it's one less thing to test, easier waterproofing. I don't give a fuck about making their job easier. Samsung did a perfectly fine job with the s7 and s8 hardware. They proved you don't have to sacrifice any features or components. 
It made way more sense for apple to do than for Google. Apple can profit way more from the decision than Google can. It seems incredibly stupid for google to make such a move. 
I think you're missing the point that there is a *delay* in them getting off AND also "hiding". I stand no where near the doors opening when I'm waiting but there are some people who are hidden from view near the panel AND they are waiting several seconds to move once the doors open. I'm assuming they aren't paying attention or texting or something. If the doors open, it looks empty, and no one immediately leaves, then I'm not at fault for trying to come into the elevator when some moron not paying attention is still in there hiding in the corner.
I *really* hope you're right. I do also remember when the S8 was confirmed with no headphone jack.
>get really close for about 5 seconds, then I back off. If it's night time I flash my high beams once. 

This works maybe 5-10% of the time in southern california. The rest of the time the person doubles down and refuses to move over. I can't even tell you how many times I've tried to get someone to move over and they see me and then don't move over on principal.
Wow nice shot dude. Any editing?
Right? Like someone on this level of consumption would just not drink any at home is just absurd. 
Interesting I guess I never realized those were considered a "loop", thanks.
I guess I just assumed a "loop" typically refers to more than one iteration. But I guess it's semantics lol.
if loop? like a "while"?
Park?
Yeah, their actions might align but their motivations and demeanor don't seem to fully.
Yeah just finished my 3rd time binge watching the show 2 weeks ago and that analysis is extremely spot on. You could even throw in Tuco. Who is as close to a "rabid dog" as a character comes. Violent, erratic, unpredictable, but is extremely loyal to his family.
Good read, thanks!

Wow it's that bad? That's about how good it is on my S6 (work phone). I'd say it unlocks with a finger probably 40-50% of the time. Seems like Samsung is really lagging in that department. Meanwhile, Pixels and OnePlus 5s are lightning fast.
It's worse than the 6P's? I don't know why it is but I usually have no problem unlocking the phone, but when certain apps use the scanner to unlock the app (Robinhood) it is INSANELY picky about letting me in, like the tolerance is turned way up for app finger print reads. It's really weird/frustrating
My hope would be that there would be some sort of leaks of a OP5T (with a fixed screen and an 836). I know that isn't likely but that would be my only hope if the new Pixels don't have a headphone jack.
Yeah I will be very curious to see if the g6 develops a bootloop problem. Only time will tell lol
I feel like this happens to all Android phones. But for some reason Samsung phones have a sharper decline from my experience.
Seriously though, I just need confirmation of a headphone jack to commit to it
I've talked to them maybe 3 times about the issue. I'm only on my first RMA and it's having problems. So I've basically been burned twice. My endgame is definitely a refund so I can change phones, which I have no shame in admitting and see no ethical problem with. There have been many people who have gotten refunds, so I see no issue in asking for one since it does seem that they are willing. Though It might take 3-4 RMAs before they give in. I don't mean to be petty but I'm just telling you how it is (for me).
That's actually what I had a rep admit to me in a kind of "off-the-record" sort of way. He said it's typically around 3 RMAs before a refund but as people will tell you, that's not always the case.
Did you try for a refund yet though?
No I don't even have the warranty. But I've read stories of people getting an replacement without using their warranties since the problem is big enough. If you try for an RMA don't even mention your $99 warranty. They should replace it with or without it. All you have to do is tell them the battery shuts down at 30-40% and you have already tried factory resetting the device. If you tell them that (even if that's not *exactly* what's happening) there's a very good chance you will get a free RMA.
Yeah I'm looking for a refund in preparation for pixel 2, because I'm sure it will be the same price or more than the first one.
Gotcha, thanks man
How did you ask for it in writing? Just get them to admit over email or chat that if this one fails that you can have a refund? This sounds like something I might need to do for my next RMA. and Yeah I'm also trying to time my next one close to the Pixel lol.
A replacement or a refund? I want a refund, but so far have only gotten one replacement. I'm hoping after this one inevitably fails, I can get an actual refund.
Dang ok that makes me a little more hopeful. I haven't only done one RMA thus far so hopefully 1 or 2 more before I can get the refund. 
My problem is that android can never *truly* follow apple into the removal of the headphone jack. If we both remove it they'll start making usb C headphones and lightning headphones for those that want a wired and better sounding solution. We'd be going from a single standard to 2. I'd be much more onboard if Iphones were Usb C, then the entire market could shift more easily. 

But Apple (purposefully) fucked that idea up so they could make a little money licensing their proprietary port. Bluetooth isn't quite where it needs to be to be that alternative to both sides IMO.
I'm so paranoid of DBrand over-advertising that I'll just assume you got a monetary kick back just for making this comment. 
The G6 reminds me of like a Note 3 or something, seems slightly dated design IMHO.
There's people on here claiming they now have their shit figured out. Which is why the G6 seems to be ok? I'm not sure what to believe and am taking it with a grain of salt.
Adblockers are illegal in europe?
They can start blocking/punishing ad companies that don't bend to their demands lol
Oh wow even better! nice
Yeah that's what Google is basically doing with these refurbs. They just put a new battery in and send them out. The batteries degrade at an insanely high rate so it's only a matter of time before it starts happening again. So you either rma or change it yourself, the end result seems to be the same for most people, hence the repeated rmas. I think that up the chain at google they know how bad it is, but they just don't want to come out and admit it fully. When you have users doing 4 or 5 rmas with a certain product, that product is fucked up.
I don't think it matters either way because I think they'll just deduct it from the charge they refund you. I would call and verify with them just to make sure, I don't think "hoping for the best" is the best way to do it in this circumstance.
F
Exactly. I have NEVER met a non-technical person that has complained that they wanted their phone thinner. Especially at the cost of a headphone jack and battery life. It's so insane to me that people out there somewhere would even think that.
Does it really? You could have fooled me. This device does not seem smooth (even on day 1) and also has fairly poor battery life over all.
Oh wow I thought the bump would be to SOT but it sounds like a bump to smoothness instead. That's awesome, I'll take it either way. Hopefully it's fully implemented on the next Pixel? Maybe that's part of the reason people claim current gen Pixels feel so smooth?
Yeah the 6p camera still kinda holds its own, using hdr+ as a crutch of course
Big sot bump?
Yeah that's how I see it too. It doesn't hurt anyone to leave it since people can still use Bluetooth on current phones all they want.
When you say cyber you mean like from an online only school?
Wow that makes me super hopeful for the next Pixels. I might have to get one despite wanting a phone that has a headphone jack.
I use stereo speakers for laying in bed at night watching youtube or netflix. Headphones in bed are uncomfortable.  I assume I'm not alone, but that doesn't mean I don't use the headphone 4 days a week at the gym. They are both important (to me) and they both should be in the phone.
Oh really? Wow TIL, thanks.
What other devices are currently implementing EAS?
sooo we still have no clue what the criteria for this is
Honest question, did you doubt the pixel 2 coming?
Yup I'm that same way with netflix. I knew for a fact 146 was a good dip price but I just ignored it. Been kicking myself ever since.
It could be any two small animals if you wanted. It is without a doubt not monkeys though.
I am pretty sure it's supposed to be mice or rats as the animal. How big is this fucking wool sock that can fit two full sized monkeys fucking in it?
Oh ok, good to know thanks. I just remember reading a lot of negativity about the 4th one so I didn't know how much better 3 was.
Roughly only 30% of people work during the day, normal working hours. It's pretty insane how many old people, students, children, and people who work weird hours there is. It was always incredible to me how much traffic there was while I would would assume most people should be working if I took a day off.

*edit: His comment was at -10 when I made this comment. I STILL have no idea why
Nice dude. Thanks for sharing your story
add in g10 handles and that would be an instant buy for myself and surely many others..
Yes, this happens many places.
Exactly. Their logic is so fucking infuriating. Like "due to software and SOC optimization we were able to make the battery 20% smaller!" Like, keep the fucking battery the same size and still do all of those optimizations so we can grow in battery life year to year. I don't want to have the same SOT as flagships did 2 years ago.......

it's the same logic as removing OIS for EIS. Like just keep that shit in there and continue to perfect EIS. Both would surely be better. You don't have to remove it.

/endrant
But wasn't the main bootloop problem caused by essentially part of the manufacturing process? 
If google actually does remove them, it makes them look *really* bad imo. They were literally talking shit on them last year about it and now they do it? Thanks for really sticking to your guns Google.
Damn, now I just need to meet someone that can get me my day in court.
How much could g10 bump the price of this? I fucking hate the feeling of "grivory". g10 is infinitely better imo.
Yeah they are always super positive and friendly. At worst they're annoying but not on purpose.
That would have been WAY better lol.
define "tanked" in amd's case.
Why use the mobile site over something like Sync Pro or Relay?
What was the leaked one? I never saw the post
I've said this several times on this sub but if it has an sd836, waterproofing, and headphone jack, I'll pay whatever Google wants to charge as soon as you can pre-order. 
Yeah I just don't think I could leave nexus/pixel stock android and immediate updates are just too important to me. I do love the s8 hardware though. I'm holding out hoping the pixel 2 hardware closes the gap at least a little.
His point was pretty clear
got em
Exactly. Google has the resources to hire highly paid, experienced and seasoned logistics professions to sort it all out. But it's like they choose not to lol.
16gigs or bust
Yeah I'm a hardcore shoes 99% of the time guy, so I think the break in took a bit longer for me. Still great, fairly robust sandals though.
Maybe it's just me but the break-in is really brutal in them for me. Like multiple blisters on each foot bleeding type of bad. But after a couple weeks if you just push through it, they are so incredibly comfortable.
Yeah it's an uphill battle to get a refund for a 32. Not impossible but it's pretty hard.
That's the problem I'm referring to
What size is your 6p? I heard they have only been willing to do that for 128s and 64s because of stock problems. To get a refund with a 32 typically takes at least 3 rmas from what I've read.
I've heard stories of people getting refunded who bought through amazon, you need to give amazon a call. The issue is widespread enough that they know about it.
How many RMAs before you got a refund and what was the size of your device?
I had a rep sort of make an off-handed comment about the magic number before refunds are typically considered being 3 RMAs. There's scnenarios where people have been getting them early but other people on /r/Nexus6P have admitted that your chances go way up after 3 RMAs. I've just kind of admitted defeat and decided I'm willing to play the 3 rma game if it means getting a refund.
5.0 was really shitty, 5.1 was a large improvement and 6.0 even more. 
I remember seeing people skateboard and bike so I'd assume it would be ok.
I don't think anything has been confirmed, but the best guess I've heard is that something is causing the batteries to deteriorate at an insanely high rate compared to most phones. Once it deteriorates to a certain point, that's when early shut down happens. 
Hopefully this movie is more than that, but from the trailer, it looks EXACTLY like that. I've never read the book so all I saw in the trailer was character after character and reference after reference for literally no reason. No conflict to drive any plot or anything, just references and characters I know. 
My biggest fear is seeing a website I've worked on in a screenshot on this sub.
You are not allowed to go ANYWHERE until you populate my model correctly.
That feeling you way more nostalgic than the actual visual of the store. That "buzz" on a friday night at a blockbuster was literally almost tangible. 
Yeah man that was a rough start to the 64-bit cpu era. Glad the 820/21 turned it around and even more so it seems with the 835.
Yup I'm on my first RMA and it said 104% after about 5 sessions or cycles or whatever
I'm on my first RMA so just two more to go. Something tells me my 3rd RMA will be around the time that the Pixel 2 comes out..
The majority seem to be driven by middle-aged women. I drive a wrx so I 100% understand the backwards hat, vaping bro stereotype. But that's not the majority of Subaru drivers and neither is the portland/hipster stereotype. Just a bad analogy all around I'd say.
If you bought from Google play store I would just RMA, it seems the RMA phones come with a new battery installed.
I have also heard that 3 is the magic number from a rep. He said it more off-the-cuff as opposed to some hard rule that they have though.
Yeah, that's like worst case scenario SOL..
If it has waterproofing, an 836, and a headphone jack the Pixel 2 is like an instant buy. As soon as you start taking some of those things away I'll start questioning the purchase. But those 3 things are what it will take for me to pay the top dollar price tag I know it will be.
I think "smart" in this circumstance means a lot of experience, highly paid, highly educated, etc.

I would assume all those things about them, but obviously there's a disconnect somewhere if we are getting the phones that we want. We aren't asking for impossible configurations of phone specs or something so I'm not exactly sure what the disconnect is.
.....if only..
Yup the only people who have been screwed with 5x/6p problems are the people who did not buy direct from google store. Those people have to deal with the device manufacturers who I've heard countless horror stories about. 
>People here dislike social interaction

TIL I am Swedish and should probably move to Sweden.
I have heard they have gotten better or at least the issues aren't as widespread as when they had the g4 bootlooping problems. My next phone will be an LG (pixel xl 2) so I really hope they have their shit together now. I'm definitely buying from Google because they have a decent track record of if a widespread problem happens to a phone you buy direct from them, they are decent about RMAs and refunds.
I've actually felt that way about my 6p as well. Even the non-throttled performance of the 810 sucks.
I thought the consensus was that something changed with LG directly following the N4/N5 era. Like some sort of manufacturing process, or where they sourced their components from or something.
Wait, is your example that Subaru is a fashion symbol? Sorry I'm a bit confused by the "Subaru vs X effect".
Yup that type of person is basically the antithesis of everyone on this sub lol.
This should be in the fucking sidebar of this sub lol
Known as an "aquadump" to the local lifeguards.
Damn I'm a bit scared because I'm approaching the edge of the U. Holy shit do I remember the sharp drop at around 18-20 though. 
Really? I thought you could still browse servers in some way? wtf, that's lame if that's true. I would always stick to like 2-3 servers 
I thought they fucked it up bad like 2-3 years ago. But I haven't played in a year. What did they do last year?
Jesus Christ that really paints a fucked up picture.

Seriously though. I have never in my whole fucking life had something even remotely lucky happen to me.
This theory makes the most sense
Oh weird I guess I'm just remembering it wrong
That's also good for americans (or anyone else) that's traveling there and only knows 911.
No, you are not imagining it wrong. I guess it changed for Pixels because I could have sworn that brand new phones were always the first to get the new version, then all other nexus got it right after. Not sure why they made that switch for the new Pixels
What I'm saying is haven't the brand new phones that launch always gotten the new version of android first? Then all the other phones get the new version almost right after. Has there ever been an instance where the current generation phones get the update a month in advance of a new phone release?
But don't new Pixels/Nexus always launch with new software? Does that mean that Pixel 2 will launch with 8.1 or something? I'm confused.
Six days in a row on an intense floor is not remotely fun and takes like 2 days to recover from so it's not something you want to do every month. But yeah doing it every few months can be cool to take a vacation without using any PTO
So she works one shift of OT per week? That doesn't make sense unless her hospital is *extremely* understaffed. All the nurses I know work 3 days per week, 12 hour shifts.
All these stories of 128s getting refunds makes me severely regret getting a 32gig.
This is true, but just be sure to Squawk 7500.

Thank the good lord. My 6p is terrible in doors with tmobile
Lol'd hard, thanks.
Do you have any certs? Or did you only have a dev background and just try for a sys admin role?
The 835 will be 5-10% faster according to Qualcom but the big strides (according to them) is the up to 40% lower power consumption. So it should be a pretty battery friendly chip. I think people just mean that it's a big enough difference to probably want to wait or get a phone with an 835 if you can. The 821 is a GIANT step up from the generation that came before it though (the infamous 810 generation of chips).
I almost bought when it dipped to 146 a couple weeks ago. I know it was coming back up too. I just didn't have the proper funds lined up so I just forgot about it. Kicking myself hard right now.
So all phones that come with O will basically get quick security updates just like Pixel phones? But I guess major updates will still be slower? Am I understanding this correctly?
I know it's speculative, but what are the chances you think that Google will remove the headphone jack on the Pixel 2? like pretty high? or low? 
I'm the exact same way. If it weren't for the whole jelly thing with the OP5 I would have totally jumped ship from my 6p. I can deal with a mediocre camera, but I know that the jelly thing would bother the shit out of me on a daily basis. oh well, guess I'm going to wait to see if the pixel 2 has a headphone jack; if it does, I'll buy it even at the crazy high price that it will probably be lol.
>Everyone talks about the former like it's some kind of leper


Who is saying that? I've never read negative comments about the 821 and I follow this subreddit very closely. Sure the 835 is much better but that doesn't make the 821 a bad chip.
That's exactly my situation as well.
I've met plenty of people who don't like seinfeld. They are all under the age of like 22 though. They just couldn't get into it because of two reasons: The laugh track, and them not being able to put themselves into the time period lacking technology.

Not recognizing an object would prevent braking? The braking system has priority over all other systems (obviously). How could that prevent braking?
That's what I don't get, is the guy saying the car ignored his braking too? Because hard breaking should/will always override anything else the car is doing..
Why would that cause acceleration?

wow, I had no idea. Has there been a soc released since then that did the same thing? Or was that like a one-time thing for qualcom and they just stopped doing it? I haven't heard of low battery throttling for any other soc
Literally. He was taken for a ride between Texas and Vegas!
He paid 2/9ths the price of a new battery? So around a 22% discount?
What about SMS, RCS, or a desktop client? 


NOPE. You will be getting more stickers.
I understand the heat throttling, but why would the phone automatically throttle on low battery? Is it just some kernel profile to reduce battery usage?
I bought my phone in april 2016 and just RMA'd last week. My refurb phone came with 104% battery health according to Accu. They've extended the warranties on all 6p's because of all the battery problems. 
I thought that was the current state of leaks/rumors. People keep telling me the note will have the 836 and then Google will release the new pixel with an 835. I mean, yeah, I guess none of this is completely confirmed lol.
If you bought from google store, all you have to do is tell them your phone shuts off at 40-60% and they will rma.
Is it confirmed as 835? That's pretty lame if it comes out after the note 8 and the note has an 836. I know it's a marginal difference but still.
Wow baba was doing fine today then all of a sudden it shit the bed? wtf, anyone know why? Also had a really good day yesterday.
You can and should definitely call in. All you need to do is is tell them your first sentence and that you've already tried to factory reset. If you tell them that, you will get an rma.
Glad I'm not the only one. I just had to step outside and take a break because I was laughing too hard at my desk.
Oh wow, I never knew that. That would be awesome if they did that again.
32gig?
I actually had a rep admit to 3+ being the "magic number" before refunds typically happen.
How many RMAs have you done and is your phone 32gig?
Was his phone 32 gig like yours? Everyone estimates how big a factor that is. It's incredibly easier to get refunded on 128gig, and slightly easier if the phone is 64.
Guessing 128gig? What you are describing is basically impossible with a 32 gig. Trust me, I tried.
Yup if there's anything we learned from the 6p is that it is almost always best to buy Pixels and Nexus direct from Google. After reading other peoples horror stories of dealing with manufacturers and I'm going to continue to buy direct. 
Wow. That's really, really good. Even if it was 5-6 out of the box I would be more than happy. I'm currently in the 2-2.5 range and it's not fun to live with day to day.
I don't know why but this makes me think if oj Simpson
All I want is an 836, 6 gigs of ram, and waterproofing. If they can deliver those things I will pay whatever price they want for it.
How long have you had one and what is your average SOT? Thinking about switching to an XL from my 6p. Battery is the most important factor to me at this point.
I'm feeling the same way. I don't mind high pricing if the device reflects it, I've argued many times that the Pixels didn't necessarily reflect their pricing. It's completely absurd that there hasn't been a price drop on last year's pixels already. 
What was the deal?
I'm mostly surprised they had new ones to send you 18 months after purchase. Like they just had a bunch of new ones warehoused and ready to go? That's really strange.
I've heard amazon has been chill about refunding though
I wish I was that lucky. Judging from the 6p subreddit, problems are fairly wide-spread. 
You think so? Even though the note is coming out first?
I'm hoping for the rumored 836 and 6 gigs of ram, with waterproofing. If it can hit those specs, I'll bite even at "pixel" pricing. 
As someone with a 6p, I feel you on that one. But it does seem like Pixels are holding up better after some time than the 6p did. I'm sure the 810 didn't help at all
Exactly. That is obviously a lie/bullshit excuse if they try to pull that. Other companies seem to have no problem with it.
Seriously. Just give us an extra button like the Bixby button, but let us do whatever we want with it.
As long as it also has waterproofing. If I have to choose between waterproofing and squeezable frame, it's like a no-brainer.
>The 810 really is an awful chip.

It truly is. It throttles so hard and sucks so much battery. I'm assuming the Pixel 2 is getting the 836?
Those were simpler, better times.
Definitely a good way to look at it. I'm a fairly pessimistic person and have typical looked at life as winning and failing. I'm slowly trying to change that to hopefully something more along the "winning or learning" lines. I can get caught up in the "failures" and then sort of spiral.
Uh so is ftr still processing for a while?
I'm going to do my best to look at it this way lol. 
I may have slipped into depression just by reading your comment, and I haven't ever seen the movie..

Your comment is what an upvote is.
Join Clubs. Like, I'm not kidding, join at least one CIS-ish club (FAST, SWIFT, MISSA). Try your best to be nice, or befriend people in your CIS classes. These are people you will be having repeated classes with the next 2-3 years. Having friends that know what they are doing that you can ask for help is such an insane advantage over being a loaner/anti-social and doing it yourself (some of these smart people might be from the clubs that you join, another reason to be in a club). I'm assuming you've done some sort of programming before? If not, watching some youtube videos and mess around with java just so you aren't dumbfounded when you have to take a couple classes (take Professor Curl, don't take Professor Ma). The only reason I say that is because that seems to be a common class that people struggle with if they've never touched code or seen code before. Other than that you should be completely fine. It's definitely a little harder than known easy majors (libral arts or something), but it's significantly easier than CS or an engineering. Don't sweat it dude.
I know /u/h4ckrabbit and I are obviously minorities, but I'm also really just sick of them. I've seen a couple ok ones over the last few years but other than that they just seem like they are just WAY too frequently released. Like I just wish the industry would chill the fuck out on them for like 4-5 years and then come back with some really good ones to really get everyone excited. I tried so hard to watch wonder woman and just couldn't. Probably ended up watching maybe 1/3 of it? It's not like I have some "superior taste" in movies or something. But when I see a 92 on RT though I feel like I'm going fucking crazy.

If a phone is not popular, not many people will be mentioning it in this thread, or in ANY thread.
I got a free zippo lighter recently from them, and I think before that it was a free pair of work gloves.
Because I don't think you or anyone else thinking something "looks cool" is in no way incorporated into the definition of Outsider Art?
>Wondering why this is the only comment mentioning the Active

Maybe because it wasn't a super popular device? Incredibly shadowed by the s7 and s7 edge.
S7 was the one that people said was going to be different though! Starting with that phone Samsung was supposed to get their act together! /s
I never knew he was considered an Outsider. Loved that doc on him. I do actually think he could have been quite big if it weren't for his mental illness. 
Haven't heard any update on the Class Action, but I doubt a win there would give any dollar amount near the phones value. I would honestly expect some bullshit like every 6p gets like $25 credit to google play. It sounds like your only option at this point would be to replace the battery yourself which it seems like people have been having success with. Sorry man, good luck. I never realized how much of a life saver buying direct from Google was going to be.
Define all of a sudden? Where have you been for the last several years at least?
Yeah this is almost the "generic douche who is way too into a certain sports team" starter pack. Just swap out the jersey for whatever other one you want lol.
You were literally robbed while inside a Walmart? Twice?
The nostalgia is so strong it hurts.
Yeah I'll just assume his condo isn't in Fullerton or SA
You think he's self aware enough to devise a scheme like that? Watching some of his other videos, he actually does seem like a dumb ass. I personally don't think he's feigning being retarded just to piss people off on purpose.
wow that's pretty erotic..
u *jelly* bro?
I only hope google doesn't "get wise" to this game as pixel 2 gets closer. Because that's a similar game that I'm going to be playing also. I'm most likely going to go though several rma's between now and the pixel 2 launch so hopefully that only increases my refund chances. 
Do you use the fast charger nightly/daily? A part of me is convinced that the included charger speeds up the degradation of the battery.
You might be the first to make this comparison. Possibly the first in this very thread in fact.
Exactly, who in their right mind would suggest that the US would do nothing if someone fucked with Costa Rica?
There's 50 fucking links to this posted all over this thread. There were mirrors posted before the tweet was even deleted......
When I turn my 6p upside down and use it, it's very jarring. I don't think I could be a op5. It's weird, it like almost hurts my eyes.
It's a screen refresh problem. If you can't see it then that's great. I don't believe the refresh direction can be fixed with a software update. 
I was hating my 6p enough to jump to the op5 until all this jelly stuff happened. I know myself and I will never not be able to see it. This is what happens when a company goes the cheap route and instead of sourcing a new panel with the correct orientation, they just use their old one and flip it 180 degrees. *THIS* is like the fucking definition of cutting corners. I was so ready to ignore all the other bs.
It's just engineers lacking experience or expertise. I'm sure engineers at samsung would immediately veto a design of a phone where the screen refreshed from bottom to top because they know that it would cause weird visual issues. The engineers at Oneplus? Nope, they just went ahead and did it.
The problem is that it is without a doubt related to how the user "perceives" the screen. There are some people who just don't see it. But it is there, because ever single one of the displays refreshes in the same direction. If you can't see it, then that's great though. I personally find it really jarring and it really bothers my eyes. I would buy one tomorrow if they somehow issued a miraculous update to fix it.
That's exactly how I look at it. If they own it, a lot of the shitstorm dies down. As soon as you don't own something it fuels the shitstorm. I know it even took samsung a little while before completely admitting there was a severe problem. I guess we'll see if oneplus ever does.
Why are there so many people struggling to find a mirror in this thread? It's been posted so many times at this point.
dbrand talks :(
Guaranteed that the 5t will refresh in the correct direction. 
Pretty sure /u/iamiNSOmaniac realized that when he made his comment..
I would consider that very bad battery life, and yes, that is very normal for what I get on mine.
Last night I actually got a rep to admit that the magic number seems to be 3 for replacements before you get refunds (he also admitted to 64 and 128s having a much easier time securing refunds). Yeah unfortunately I am on my original advice and was hoping to avoid all the headache of multiple replacements and just get a refund. I do realize how disadvantaged that makes me though. If my third escalation fails I'll probably just have to go the replacement route until I can finally secure a refund. If that's the way it goes then oh well I guess, but I will without a doubt jump through their "hoops" for $500 off my next device.
Do you notice the Jelly? I was so ready to buy the op5 but then this whole jelly thing happened and I got worried it would bother me. Is it something you just get used to and then stop seeing it?
I know this all too well as someone currently fighting for a refund for a 32gb. Let's just say it's been an uphill battle. Have you had any luck with yours? Assuming that you have tried, of course. 
Thank you, I'll mention this when they respond to me. I can tell when I talk to them that I am at a disadvantage only because I have a 32. I have called and escalated multiple times but they lady I spoke to last night seemed the most reasonable and said she was on the "escalation team" and needed to discuss with her the other people on the team and they like vote or something? Either way I'm not going to give up lol. 
Probably just judge you for not going to a school that they know of.
If you own a demolition company and make good money you can easily have a GF like that. 
ehh I'll get on next time it goes to 11-12. Which it will.
Seriously though. At the height of Vine, if you couldn't watch a pro-viners video and not realize how fucking cancerous they were as people and as content creators, you need to reevaluate your life.
Damn, that's not bad. If I get bored I will give it a shot.
Is it smooth and what is your SOT? Been thinking of trying it but I got scared after all the negative posts on dp1.
On my next call with Google, I'm going to tell them that I don't want to be treated differently than 64s and 128s. I think the only thing holding me back from a refund is the fact that I have a 32 which is really frustrating. 
I was just wondering if you can issue a firmware update to reverse the screen refresh? I don't know enough about displays to know if that is physically possible.
Can anyone in the technical know comment on how possible it is to issue a fix to the OP5 fixing the jelly effect? I know they've said they're working on it, but that's just a canned response.
Damn I like that backyard
I'm totally willing to pay whatever they want if it has duel front facing speakers and water proofing. Whatever it does end up having it will surely be pixel pricing.
Thank you very much. I'm definitely at a disadvantage because 32gb are so prevalent that they have a limitless number of 32s to rma. But that won't deter me I will continue to fight for it. Thanks
> You don't see this kind of jelly scrolling behaviour on other devices when you turn it upside down.

You made this comment without researching or reading a single other comment in this thread or others right?
I have two questions, what size and color was your device? and also, did they decide for you to have a refund right there in the chat? Or did they do the whole 24-48 hour escalation thing? I just tried the manager thing, but they just put in for a "refund escalation" where they get back to me. Is it possible for them to just authorize it right on the phone or in the chat?
Your post is like my own personal beacon of hope. thank you
I don't want to go through a bunch of RMAs just to get to the refund part of the process. 
His dick was the water jet..
You are aware that it's ok to curse on the internet right?
Just turn it upside down lol
If you get sick 4 times in one semester you need to consult a doctor asap bro. 
Yeah some places have dangerous streets/freeways, but fuck driving or walking in parking lots in or near irvine. I cannot tell you how many times I've almost been hit driving slowly or casually walking through a parking lot here. It's pretty fucking insane how some of these people drive here.
I'm usually not a fan of all the #gate things. But JellyGate is pretty freaking hilarious. 
They all have the same display orientation from the factory. It's just whether or not you notice the jelly or not. It will be there though.
[According to this article, it will eventually not be an exclusive.](https://9to5google.com/2017/06/29/moto-z2-play-now-available-verizon/) 
it's extremely unfortunate that "carrier exclusive" phones are still a thing. So fucking frustrating. 
Squawk 7500

*edit: just kidding. Original Mayday call is at 4:02 for those wondering
Sorry meant I've been out of College for 3 years, doing dev stuff. Unless your advice was meant for that scenario..
haha i understand that for sure.
Hmm I will definitely consider it as a replacement to my 6p temporarily
does the moto z2 play have full US lte bands?
I would guess the next pixel will definitely NOT be competitively priced. It was be it's full current price, again. All of their marketing, hype and current prices point to it being a extremely premium line. Why would flip after one generation and release a cheaper phone? Trust me, this is coming from someone that would love the next pixel to be cheaper.
I'm trying to convince google for a refund currently. If they flat out deny me I might have to resort to changing it myself. Yeah my battery life has degraded down to less than half of what it was when my phone was new.
I can't get it do it on my 6p either. And trust me, I really hate this phone right now, but I can't seem to make it do the jelly effect.
Business 101 though right? Lower your costs (shitty components) and then raise your price. Ignore customer service/retention, just focus on profit. Nothing can go wrong if you do that.
That's a hilariously true way to put it lol
I've definitely noticed SIGNIFICANTLY more lag than when I first had the phone over a year ago. Blame it on the 810 or anything else you want but it is very noticeable. Like the entire UI hangs for a solid 1-2 seconds when I tap an app on the home screen sometimes. It's very apparent and provable shit like that where I know I'm not just going crazy, it is actually much slower.
Full US LTE bands?
Dang hopefully I can pick mine up as soon as I convince google to refund me. 7 hrs sot sounds amazing. I think my record for the 6p was when it was still on MM and it was only like 5:15 sot. I remember the days when I got 4.5 consistently. Now that I'm down to 2 I'm trying to abandon ship.
*Roofie
I've been out for 3 years so I'm trying to figure it out without being able to do an internship at this point unfortunately
wow that's awesome!
I just can't imagine the pixel is *still* worth that full price?
ohh. That's unfortunate. I guess you could try your luck with Huawei but that might be fruitless. 
Why not deal with google at that point? They've said they'll rma devices with early shutdown.
