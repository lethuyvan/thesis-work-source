Connected vehicles are going to be the thing before autonomous vehicles - I just don't understand why people think everything is going to be automated right from the start.

Maybe if Niantic communicated something better at release instead of hid behind using SafetyNet as a bandaid (also thank you Niantic for creating a security hole with SafetyNet and any banking app due to implementing this as a passive way to fight bots) for any programming they do. For fuck sake they could have hired these people who made the scripts of the nests and Pokémon locations for white-hat hacking. Instead, innovation is shut down along with barely any communication. This is like anything with Ingress and The Brokers Guild is just a farce on the actual impact that's out there. Pokémon Go is just making it easier to see the playing environment that Niantic thinks is ok.
You can't blame Pokémon Go when Niantic lacks communication. They suspended the portal queue for 2 years and barely did anything with any reported portals until recently. Niantic had enough time to address or even look at this regardless of whatever people say about Nintendo wanting to speed up the release. The beta testing of Go was hilarious because there was nothing communicated with the group with any feedback. None.

This is all Niantic. If you blame Go, you're not seeing the source of the problem.
You mean Google Play
> "Due to music licensing restrictions, we are required to remove certain songs from the in-game soundtrack of Grand Theft Auto IV and its Episodes, in particular a large portion of the Russian pop station, Vladivostok FM," a Rockstar rep said. "However we are replacing some of those songs with a new set of songs on that station. We will update our customer support website with new information as soon as it is available." 

From a Kotaku article about the licensing.

There's a difference between the operating speed and the speed limit - any DOT will tell you the 85 percentile is usually 10 mph above.

Age appropriate based on what? Criteria for portals don't state that.

If it's an issue, Niantic will need to manually look at their database for anything. It's at their own discretion anyways for approving portals.
That has changed in the past few months.
But definitely without any catchy pop songs
Because the map presents no actual key on it and the OP didn't mention how they made the chart? It makes sense to question what the chart means.
Niantic Project was a fun AR. The story should have stopped progressing after they cut ties with Google. You can see the difference in story writing and production value going down. The only good thing was the Investigate website for a progression of everything Obsidian onwards, which they learned from Endgame.

They're unifying their design on the current Google apps. That's why it's like that. This is looking like the tab history with the Google app.

Implying they will actually release Fuchsia.

I want to keep on loving Google but I know they are going to fuck it up somehow.
No that sounds like typical Google. You can submit feedback but they rarely acknowledge or communicate anything.
I hate to say it but the AMAs don't provide anything more official when you're going to poke into technical details. Niantic hate when people try to poke at their code and they're going to not be communicative about it.

Why doesn't the theory work with your area? The S2 grid is how the scoring cell locations (zoom layer Z6) and MU counts are generated.
I'll believe it when I see it.
It doesn't need to be verified by Niantic. No offense to Andrew but the S2 grid has been tested and more exact than this guideline presented. I can confirm from personal experience that I've had some portals rejected for being too close and when I resubmitted them to adjust them so they're not in the same z19 layer square, they get approved.

There's even a thread on here with the documentation and Andrew being unaware of this method. (I do not blame him for that as he's a community manager - no disrespect to his job)
I just have been focusing on luck and basing my submission with the S2 layer so it's not within the same squares on the Z19 layer. I can from personal experience that it works.

On that same note, I have been using Wikipedia as a means for any potential candidates. You can check what articles are nearby or even use maps that show locations of articles that have been added with coordinates.

See that's the interesting part. I have recently got back into editing Wikipedia just because I can add sources to where things are and just share knowledge.

Academia just sometimes stick to one strict procedure where additional ways of thinking just leaves them outdated in some aspects.
That would be more poking at trivia. Yes, you don't need a primary source for something minor but if verification is needed than you provide one. It's critical thinking.

Because the portal submission process was originally done remotely. You could share the image through the gallery to "NIA Ops" to make it bring up the submission screen with the pinpoint located to where the image was geotagged with the adjustment feature as a ways of fixing any potential GPS drift from taking pics. Honestly, they shouldn't have removed this functionality. 

People see this as spoofing or falsifying your location when this process of submitting portals was the original intention of the submission screen (Read: the code in it has not changed since it launched in 2013). You can easily make it so Ingress has to focus on its own camera API to prevent this and from my understanding it's very simple. Regardless, the coding in the submission screen just pushes the title, GPS points selected, and description as a query to Niantic in the form of an email. When that email says "receiving this email means we got your submission" they really do mean it.

I've never seen this behavior with Amazon.

I mean it's hard to say "people are a lot more antisocial nowadays" when a lot in general changed from 1987 to 2014 with one gas station near Disney World. (near Disney World doesn't automatically mean there's Disney magic with the people)

The technology changing from recording freely with those huge cam corders to a device in your pocket changed how to perceive anything that records your life. We have social media where anything recorded out of the norm does make us defensive by default. I'm agreeing with your stance but it would nice to see sociology explained with it (and obviously input more than 9/11).
Tom is nothing like Zuck.

Tom at least looks at future social platforms and tests them out for some input. I enjoyed his posts during the launch of G+. The dude doesn't gloat about his riches and seems down to earth. Last thing I remember is that he does photography.

Specops - I would say that the idea of murals changed the outlook on missions. I loved making single missions at launch of Missions but I can see the fun of doing murals in any city. I just wished the scanner was able to bundle murals for easy use. It hasn't been changed since 2015 and hoping Prime pokes at revamping this.

Trekker - Drifting depends as the cut off with trekker is much lower than being speed locked. You still need to do legit work to reach 2500 km and you can watch around with the scanner open with no portals to still make it count. I use it as a rough estimate of my exercise distance.

Seer - If they didn't have 5k as the onyx tier, I would believe there wouldn't be a lot of junk portals.

Recon - It's a way to push portal guidelines as they evolve but execution is half empty with the lack of communication about specifics.
The examples you present are terrible as electricity for *wireless* charging still requires a form of contact for inductive charging. Wifi and infrared technology are truly wireless.

Also, inductive charging requires a noticeable amount of heat. Basic science. If I can fast charge to mid range percentage within less than an hour, why would I need wireless charging?
Isn't USB Type C faster than wireless charging regardless?

You're in a situation where you're nitpicking about less than 100 square footage.

Just note pavement is never permanent.

It's hilarious because you used to be able to submit portals from your gallery or camera. I can see why people see it as spoofing or falsifying location but if I'm submitting a place I have been, with more sufficient information, and a better pinpoint of the actual location - is this adding harm to the portal submission? The Ingress app right now doesn't see a difference because when your submissions aren't instantly submitted to the server, the requests are queued until it sees a sufficient connection (usually WiFi connection does the trick).

In summary, I miss there was a similar idea to Google's Local Guide program for Ingress. It could be a means of having a trusted agent with the content they provide. (Provided verification from officials or Vanguards are added to that)
Well Niantic needs to update the submission fields because they have been unchanged since its launch in 2013. The code to import from the gallery was only removed in 2015 with no change to the actual submission process in the scanner. (The submission still just pushes everything as an email.)
He's talking about instead of one separate light for the turn lane, you can merge the lights for the turn lane and traveling lane - I believe it's called a 5 faced light signal. I imagine the scenario with the light pole caused the difference. I know traffic signals also are subject to MUTCD.

A badge for First Saturday honestly sounds dumb regardless if it can be done without abuse. Maybe a one time badge but a tier badge will just kill the idea of First Saturday (which is honestly already dead)
*That's bad*
Nah, they need to implement something new for a monthly local community event
All 5 of them?
> As long as Fuchsia runs all of Google's apps, services and has full Android app compatibility

So.... no.
Google won't post the charges until the next business day, even regardless it provides data
Oh great, this won't be abused in any way possible
*Quietly*
I know but they also stated the app as a means of ["internal competition"](https://telegram.org/blog/telegram-x) to itself to further improve the app. 

I don't see it as a comparison to nightly builds as it's much more stable as an app.
Sounds like an anniversary release?

Great example of the birthday paradox.
Or even Paint Shop Pro
And reddit limits it to -100
Are you aware of The Lottery?
I didn't vote for the guy!
That's because of Telegram X

The idea of self competition makes sense

I mean it's still a rogue app /s
Because they are still butthurt about Alexa and Chromecast
Sounds like they are trying to get rid of XL units
Well yes. It depends on what your frame of reference is for the balance, right?

Then again you're explaining motion and I'm in civil engineering which... yeah
I mean it is. There's a force counteracting the force of gravity which is the basis of Newton's Second Law.

Waze is still a separate database and entity from Google.

[More about how traffic data is gathered.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Traffic). Google Maps integrates data from Waze with some of its data.

Yes it is purposely confidential
I mean, sure. [But they probably won't.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexus_Q)
I mean I understand the fraud as they verified businesses through physical cards. They even did a blog entry about it. I'm just saying Map Maker was so feature which on what you could provide to Google Maps - legit was a powerful OSM version of Maps. I see road incorrect and I have to constantly report them as invalid even as a Local Guide 7. I have no idea who reviews it but it looks like it might be community based through "Check the facts"

I'll still check out the podcast, thanks!
They are still separate entities because they have different databases except for the bigger items such as constriction and road closures.

You have better chance with Waze through their [Connected Citizens program](https://www.waze.com/ccp). A lot of cities already use it and I know Atlanta used it extensively during the 85 bridge collapse.
You only have to bring things up to ADA code provided you're doing significant changes to the original project.
Which begs to ask - why did they terminate Map Maker?
!isbot LA-native
Wait until you watch Hard Candy
It's not so much the 3D but the call to any data field of the Maps API. I forget how many times Ingress used it in the app AND for intel.
Oh man the bitterness.

Just state what answers you can realistically get answers to before even making a monthly AMA? We know there's now different departments and would love to here that except non answers. I know you're doing this out of your own time and I really appreciate it. It really is a plus to things before with Niantic. Any chance we can get insight of your job and duties from a weekly or long-term perspective?
So just like Google Keep, adding a reminder in Calendar, or even Google Assistant on the phone?
Or restrict it to using their app
Someone is going to reply saying Chrome OS is more than a web browser and state Linux (which requires developer mode and switching back and worth constantly) but honestly - Chrome OS is just so barebones that I shouldn't be messing with the OS to get more functionality.

Pixelbook is not worth it regardless of the specs because the OS is never going to take advantage of them unless you pry hard into the OS.
I don't know about you but I have been groaning about Android's last few updates
Yet they updated the app last year out of nowhere
I think I would be happier with Google still running Ingress but at the same time they would have abandoned it by now.
I imagine because of how many calls to the Maps API.
So was Android
Nah they go through a separate entity. You get a pop up with any emergency broadcast with an [archive in the same menu you described](https://i.imgur.com/N7Oq4XS.png).
I'm kind of perplexed by the number of comments about the outrage with the misspelling. I want to blame autocorrect but it looks like even the correct spelling pops up there

If it's a return with Amazon, it's automatically generated with the prepaid shipping label. It's not a sticker per se
Every 3 hours
Go to your local fire department station.
Anything Anker has an 18 month warranty...

Even a Powercore cable? I go out of my way to buy the better cables with Anker and I have yet to see one break after 3+ years now
18 month warranty and they honor special sale prices if you ordered them right before a sale
Considering returns are either UPS or USPS and a sticker has to be displayed with a battery warning... this is nothing different than what any service ships
Amazon makes power banks?
It's going to look like iOS lol
I have a feeling this is more of Google progressing their Night Mode on YouTube desktop. I want to be optimistic about it but I feel this isn't related to Android P. I don't see the app using Product Sans yet

You're in luck - Android P's design is going to help this
Typical Niantic non answer.
Why Jellybean?
My Charge HR 2 lasts roughly 4 to 5 days with a full charge. A full charge barely takes an hour.

Again - do they listen to feedback? They tend to do things without any input regardless and I'm not even saying as "they should listen to what we the small majority of this subreddit says!"
I guess Switch changes that mindset
That's pretty consistent for Google
!redditcoal
Oh I think it's fun and torture at this point
So we can't complain about Google Play services
Google: Hold my pixels
You act like Google isn't going to release a phone with a notch.
Google listens to concerns?
Fuck you 275!

That is all.
Please tell me that's not Tampa
Also the design is consistent with recent updates to the design of Google's apps
What the fuck did I step into?!
Pixel ≠ Nexus
The account verification didn't stop anything - any Google account can generate a new Google Voice number.
You haven't noticed the UI changing on the Google apps in the past few months? I would say 8.1 has been a little preview to the UI especially the battery menu
Oh yeah, definitely. It's just I wish it had more RAM so it made HDR worth it.
That should be Google's motto
Same for Huawei and 6P
Except didn't have the RAM for anything in Google Photos

They purposely kept the RAM at 2 GB for the device which was the same as the original 5 back in 2013.
Nexus was more for developers to test the new entities but I'm not sure what Google is doing with the Pixel line
5X didn't have much of a strong suit. Just a purposely gimped phone for the sake of having a finger print scanner. Nexus 6 was designed for it initially but it never was supposed to be part of the Nexus line.
Nexus 5X is easily forgettable
The "it's a developer preview" argument is a pathetic excuse as well. We all know the white theme is going to be there especially after Google has been transitioning to it with their apps for the past year. We provide feedback, Google doesn't change it with the next previews, Android P is released, we're still beta testing the new version because the OS won't have solid fixes until 9.1 launches with the next Pixel, rinse and repeat typical Google for the past few years
Why show the driving path when it's done by air?
Pocket Camp did adjust for Daylight Savings - it says 2am instead of 1am
Government agencies also don't want to get sued because eventually the taxpayer has to foot some of the bill. Also, it just leads to creating more roadblocks as what you said. You still have to do reports on license plates and if there is an active incident on one, it's going to be redacted especially if the incident is part of an active lawsuit in itself.
Also don't forget the powder is updated to the latest daily recommended values.
They got rid of that for Android Pay I mean Google Pay
This also applies to the term recyclable materials as well. There's always a cost to recycling and recycling something already recycled does not benefit in the long run. You can only do so much with single use items.
There's county or city codes when it comes comes to the minimum amount of parking spaces and aisle widths - you have to go out of your way with an alternative parking plan (which costs money because you're deviating from the zoning codes).
Legit publications, reports, etc
Also it's in respect to portal density. If they have names, go for it. If it's generic but the only one there or a somewhat key one, go for it.
They still get their submissions back after 2 weeks?

Adding a new sidewalk is going to require a new bridge
Maybe if they listened to the concerns from when their apps started showing the white sparkle on everything

[Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?selection.family=Open+Sans) font is amazing. The white space... not so much.
At least it will work system wide?

It's just we're hearing the same run around with every letter release after Lollipop. Maybe it's ever since the restructuring to Alphabet but it shows that there's different teams with every release.
I just have Google Maps notify me of how traffic to work is when it's within my window of leaving for work.
I mean we're stating how stock does it especially with this article explaining a change to the app.

Just stating the comment when most likely something 3rd party can fix it (IFTTT is probably more than 3rd party at this point)
Because it's an adaptive version of split screen
Lol, nothing is really "final" until 9.1 comes out for Google's devices. We can assume it's gone for now.
A waste of time for the person but beneficial for the government entity.
You're implying mods make jokes
That's going to happen regardless
Their only problem is their constant ADHD
It's also on Google for enforcing it.
Cool starry, bra

If you thought it was good before the election...
Android X confirmed
Is it sad that the stable release will still feel like a beta? Nothing isn't going to be dramatically fixed until 9.1 when it's for Pixel 3 or whatever Google releases this fall
They are definitely doing something by making some updates only specific to the Pixel phones. 7.1 and 8.1 especially
The Issue Tracker is the most ass backwards system I've seen for reporting issues.
I highly recommend trying Ingress.
Oof, the sidewalk is never going to happen but they do have sidewalk on the one side crossing the bridge!

What you explained is like school to an extent.

I have an African Grey and I don't have to reward her to say the "right thing" as that is her behavior. Every single parrot have their own unique personality and way of communicating just like having a constant three year old child. You really are simplifying three decades of research as saying there's nothing retainable from how they learn.
That sounds like the normal Gulf air weather when I lived in that area...

The title comes from when it asked what color he was when doing an activity about matching colors. It's not a complete self thought as the question could be interpreted different ways from the context.

I don't know about parrots just mimicking things - African greys definitely have a comprehension of when to say things and even sometimes in context. I just don't think writing it off as simply mimicking is productive and yes the title submitted is a loaded one. Probably the many things I hate about clickbait is that it doesn't allow for questioning the article but more so questioning the title for the sake of even progressing to the content even when the content isn't related to the title.

Any solid white lines. Some states permit crossing solid yellow lines.

Gif doesn't show the shoulder before the approach so it's hard to gather the pavement markings
You also pointed out my concern - that shoulder is *wide* and can be misinterpreted as another lane. Do the shoulders there have rumble strips or anything similar to indicate it's not a traveling lane? Even the road geometry looks like they're either planning to add another lane or the opportunity changed leaving the merge lane ahead.

I was going to also mention if it was an approach for yielding, you would have white triangle pavement markings but each state can have their own version of MUTCD which sets those guidelines.
I wonder....

However, there's been several times where a reliable publication will grab from a false claim that was on Wikipedia - the false claim can now be sourced in Wikipedia. It's hilarious because I've seen this happen a lot as a Wikipedia editor before xkcd made a great comic about it - citogenesis

Considering Google made fun of Apple for removing the headphone in a Pixel ad, I am confident Pixel 3 will have a notch or something similar for the screen.
Ok you're right. However, it is a fact that Google is removing functionality from the app and they no longer support the API as of April 25, 2017.

From Google's track record of poor communication, it's something I'm personally not waiting to happen.
I thought I was in r/socialanxiety for a second here
That has been the plan since Allo was announced.

Functionality to Hangouts has been getting less and less as Google is transitioning it. Hangouts is on its death bed according to Google and the strings are being pulled soon.
It's only for enterprise though - general public is nevertheless going to see this
I'm not surprised at the confusion in the App Store

It doesn't even bother to clearly indicate it's only for G Suites users. Website does mention that Hangouts Chat can look at previous Hangouts conversations which is salt in the wound but it makes sense for G Suites.

Is this where Hangouts is finally getting the plug pulled?
Google will first.
Amazon has their own shipping service which is like Uber. I live close to an Amazon warehouse and I know Amazon will ship a product in the cheapest way possible. This means no extra amount of space in boxes and flat rate shipping that is usually a UPS to USPS flex package. There have been times I do 2 day shipping before the weekend and they purposely wait until Sunday to deliver my package through their own shipping service or USPS because it's the cheapest option for them.
I can't wait for Pixel 3 to incorporate the notch in some fashion. /s

(I wouldn't be surprised with Google, sadly.)
Because they want people to adapt to it regardless of selling at a loss

They did this with Chromecast as well
Probably a coupon and a pat on the back
How did you get the stats of the catch and spawn rate from the datamine?
I highly doubt Nintendo would progress with anything further in VR.
The matter with Android Market was selling items outside of phones and/or movies and books within the ecosystem. Google Play made sense but then they rebranded all of the apps with just didn't work at all.

Then they moved everything to the Google Store
That's what it was initially at launch so probably not.
YouTube Music does exactly that... plays music from YouTube with just the audio.

Speaking of which, why does GPM still have the music video option. I don't want to ever see the music video of the song I'm listening to on my playlist.

I think you misunderstood my comment - I was saying it was matching its owners voice when saying the command for the lights followed by matching the tone of Alexa saying ok. It seemed like the African Grey comprehended the sentence with a difference in tone in one go. Then again I wouldn't be surprised if the Grey blurts out *okay* from time to time. 

My African Grey amazes me everytime on the little situational things she picks up. She copied whenever I would say *What?* to my parents but she says it only when she overhears a conversation where an infection is made that asks a question.
I wonder why
African Grey even said the Alexa part in her voice while still maintaining the human part with the command. Parrots are weird.

> Waze has shown to adapt to this MUCH better than Google Maps. There haven't been any major configuration changes lately, so when I travel from work to my home, Waze recognizes I'm on 35W the whole time.

You can thank the map editors for that
The agreement with the Waze purchase was that it still operates as a separate entity. That's a plus as they are always beta testing and listing what they are trying to go for with every release.
Judging with Google naming things...

Probably Pixel OS or maybe Pixels
Blame developers my ass. Blame Google for ignoring their set guidelines for material design.
You're implying Google is consistent with anything
They're listening by adding white navbar to every Google related app for that extra salt in the wound
Dude. Lay off the weed and Animorphs.
They can adapt to change but it takes a while. As long as you're there while the parrot bonds with your mom, you most likely will be ok.

Currently have an African grey that's old enough to drink and I wonder the same things
Parrots are social creatures. African Greys react intense to changes in daily life and can easily become feather pluckers out of boredom. I wouldn't be surprised with finding out they can have depression. Every single parrot I've met has an unique personality.

Ugh
They said Allo and Duo would be merged if it didn't seem like the separate apps would benefit back at launch in 2016
It doesn't help they are unique and honestly behind with technology. I understand the argument of a game console versus a multimedia device but it just would benefit Nintendo. The problem is they adopt to the new technology so late in the game that it's aggravating. I loved Nintendo 64 growing up but I lost interest with the company with the GameCube and every console I just sigh at it. Wii was great with getting people involved and using physical activity but they did nothing more with the technology after the Wii Plus. I liked how Kinect allowed connectivity to Windows and you had people interested in coding with it - I wouldn't be surprised if some of them were wishing for it since Wii.

Nintendo might do ok but it's just people aren't tolerating with their excuses anymore. Switch was a great decision for them to combine the handheld and home console together. I just hope they add onto the internet services because it shouldn't be children as a limitation especially in the day and age of parental controls (which I know they have).
By not using it, duh
But we thought they were merging the Wallet back to the Android Pay app

Remember Google changed the update numbering with major and minor fixes. If anything, Marshmallow should have been 5.2.x. Nougat probably 5.3.x and then Oreo at 6.0.x.

I can't think of anything current with Android Wear and I have a Moto 360 1st generation. After the lackluster upgrade to Wear 2.0, Google has been done with it sadly.
Uh they can definitely apply a set of rules to flashlight apps or anything that Google seems unnecessary. Why the fuck is a developer making a flashlight app in 2018 when it's been built in Android since Lollipop (October 2014)?

If it's customization of the light, it should be very basic and lightweight. They should be no need for anything crazy in the app.

The tapeworms eggs mutated to become cancerous. Cancer is not just one entity it's a branch of many things. Tumors are just one element and I imagine the tapeworm eggs also replicated too much which starved itself to continue its life cycle.

Just it's so unusual for this situation because the host having an immune deficiency also caused the tapeworm to have cancer.

That's a lot with what was originally supposed to be just the wall. They probably should have stopped after the first code enforcement and asked if they could "match" the wall with their house. 

I feel like something is missing with the details about the city's ok from the Planning and Zoning department. A fee for violating code enforcement doesn't happen automatically - you usually have opportunities to explain your case or bring the property up to code instead of being charged for code violation. I mean I've seen worse with code enforcement than an interpretation of the city code for a wall - like not having permits to do construction or operate something outside of what the property is zoned.

Please note I'm merely stating the finding of facts. I imagine it's miscommunication coming from both sides with this.
I'm glad Waze removed that (you can still do it by voice) in place of flood
Dude should know it's hands free to make reports. Works just like Siri or Google Assistant
You can also send out SOS to them which is nice.

Florida DOT uses it to help get Road Rangers or police to the incident if it can't be immediately verified.
Notify your local Public Works department oh man.

Either that or they have See Click Fix
It's Florida law to not have hazards on and I'm not going to argue state troopers or the court about having them on in hazardous situations.

Also, the interstates and state roads (SIS as it's called in FDOT) has it where shoulders must be provided. One reason being what we saw during Irma for their usage as emergency lanes. (The reversible traffic flow is no longer used.)
Also you can't signal changing lanes when having hazards on
If you take multiple photos within Google Camera especially with HDR, prepare for the available RAM to tank. I know it would tank for the Nexus 5X
Better managed roads. You wouldn't need to speed.

In fact, they could probably tweak certain segments of the road to be a certain speed for a x amount of distance. Vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is used a lot to compute the transportation grid and level of congestion.
I don't see this as being a bad thing at all. Average work commute in the US is 30 miles last time I checked. That's an hour of productive time I would love to tap into instead of driving especially when my mind is thinking more about work.

What? I'm surprised at how much Nintendo is listening to the community about improvements within Pocket Camp (Niantic take notes)

You're not forced to use the leaf notes. The only event so far that was insane was Rover's quests (and probably Lottie's by association right now). Sure, the leveling up isn't the spirit of the game but after level 30 it repeats with level up prizes. You can play every 3 hours when animals rotate. The day starts at 1am EST. Just a reminder of Animal Crossing on the DS
You just explained Nintendo's innovation

That's not how class action lawsuits work, holy shit.

The one suing, the law firm, would be responsible in obtaining information for the affected people. Why the fuck would the defendant notify people about a lawsuit?
I would say definitely. Frackers with ITOs can get you a very, very loaded inventory.
Nectar was my favorite and then they discontinued it. Cocao is alright but still needs a bit more flavor.
Would suggest Soylent.
Mental checklist? Write it down so it can at least be planned out. I've been going back to a weekly planner and I at least write when I've been doing in my work so I can at least go back and say "Oh hey, I remember that."

I used to do the same thing when I had to juggle projects and found it so much easier when it's written down. ***Concrete.*** Something physical that can still be adjusted.

Hmmm I'm trying to find it and I really hope I'm not having a memory lapse to the old G+ Photos app
You do know the Photos are saved through Google Drive, right? I know this adds confusion but it makes sense with terms of separating storage availability for your Google account.
But you can mass download by searching for the specific date within the app
There's a Find Duplicates option within not just the app but also the website.

Also, it should be automatically detecting the duplicate when you upload to Google Photos

Here's the more confusing thing: the app and website can be different at times with those tags. I have seen the photo tags simply disappear and came back with the name not tagged anymore.
That's the reintroduction

You have to be careful. Sometimes the disc is just a redirect to the digital service with no actual physical media on the disc.
Which is odd because EA is responsible for the distribution of Valve's console games. Go ahead and check your copies. You'll see the EA logo.
An agent that deleted their account and other agents have deployed on the portal. When an agent deletes their account, all existence of their account gets deleted instantly after they confirm the deletion. This includes missions they created.

For bans and suspensions, it's really never clear as I've seen many different displays. Softbans just prevent seeing the agents account while their resonators still exist.
Actually, the TOS does state that your account can be purged for inactivity for over a year but the way it's stated and seeing how accounts are in the game, they never enforce this. Actually, the key word is *may*.
The issue is Niantic never provides a solid answer. If this was the reason and they said that for postponing events, fine I can understand that completely. They were able to at least provide that type of answer last year with anomalies coming later in the year.

This is not going to be for just data starved environments. I'm laughing at your example because why would a farmer be using this technology even on a sat internet basis?

The purpose of Go is most likely not going to be explicitly defined by Google leading to it being used as a means to have low quality phones with "Oreo" compatibility but limited by the OEM because Google isn't going to think long term about it.

It's time like this where I'm relying on the bot that posts the links of imgur albums of one photo directly.

This isn't an issue with the app. Imgur changed something in their coding for single image albums.
You don't really know when a new feature in beta or developer is going to come out to stable. Other companies are pretty solid on giving that information when beta testing. Google.... it's a guessing game if you want to switch back to stable. It requires a power wash anyways but still.
Or the Hooters crowd
Records are usually retained for seven years so... it's not much of a difference.
You mean developer mode?
Oh sandhill cranes.
Chrome OS updates aren't pretty if you want to be in beta or developer mode
It seemed intentional with portals submitted before OPR existed but with my recent reviews it really isn't people trying to make couch portals as much. Streetview is going to grab what is first available and I've noticed having to do the following: 

*  Zoom out of the Streetview or press <- at the top left to show the 3D aerial.
* 3D aerial is usually a bit outdated, have to press the 4 boxes button to flatten the aerial
* The 2D aerial is the most up to date and you can see the pin was placed close to the parking lot of the item in particular. It just happens there's homes nearby but the Streetview shows a different intention than what was actually done.
There was an API for Camp Navarro and building the portals at the camp. Also, there has to be an API for those vending machines in Japan that are portals and show portal stats for the machine.

I'm hoping Prime is a start to making portals more interactive with the game. It would be nice to make a portal light up by what faction controls it.
Looks like I need to load up OSM again. Only thing I've noticed is my Google Maps aerial updated around me along with segments. If Ingress still used... sigh
*What kind of ops?*

I would laugh that the government has radio comm chatter about an op over the Pacific and finding out it's an Ingress operation. We probably won't know until years (*decades*) after the fact but it would be one of those things that hearing about would make you smile inside.
Spaces
Instagram hasn't been chronological way before Facebook decided to make it similar to Snapchat. The chronological ordering went away in 2014 but I will say it has been more aggressive in the past month. Seeing updates asking about the weekend ahead and seeing them 5 days after the fact makes no sense.
Sounds more like they needed to do something with the Spaces code

No offense but this isn't like updating to a new OS version.

This update actually has been acknowledged in the developer forums to possibly be a bug. A *monthly* update shouldn't be doing it when I haven't changed app usage or been observant of any possible battery drains from background apps running. I'm seeing an increase in battery usage with Bluetooth on the device since the app update. My guess is a possible bug with Android adding battery capacity display to linked Bluetooth devices.
Screen on time (SOT) has tanked along with charging times. It all points to the security update I received this past weekend which was the January update. I can even see from the data collected from Accubattery since having my Pixel XL for a few months that the SOT has reduced and charging times increased since installing the update.
[Yeah, call it when you see it.](https://i.imgur.com/FeANWE7.gif)
The January security update is definitely causing something to drain battery
But the 8.1 January security update definitely is fucking something up in the OS
You can't disable the notification by long pressing it?
I got the OTA last weekend and the battery issues are definitely still there.

It looks like it could be with Bluetooth as it's eating up 10 percent of the battery.

Except if you got Nexus 5X and 6P because of the Fi deal (this is most likely the majority as the price cut was almost 200 bucks depending on which phone), you had to request the RMA through Fi even after deactivating their service. 

Fi was much quicker with getting a hold of than regular Google. Hell, I even had customer service agents knowing I was signing up for Project Fi for the phone deal more than the Fi service when I reactivated Fi on my Google account.
Ah I thought you were OP.
So is this really you, Galda?
Did it clean up afterwards?
They have since the start. I loved how they would put spam recipes for email you marked as spam.
I had to relook at the title because I thought Chrome for 64 bit processors and then remembered what year we're in
Please note that rejection emails don't mean they are a rejection. Yeah, I know. Classic Niantic. Check to see if the portal still exists after this email because I've had portals removals or moved regardless of the email. The email sent is just a template message while the action they do is separate.
Did you actually provide solid evidence?
You need to find out what is permitted and required to add public art with the county or city authority first before acquiring any money. The possibilities are always endless but I see so many people get shut out because they don't do research first.
Didn't have to remove your link and I guess it did come off as dickish. You provided information for anyone wondering and the submission would have stayed with a mod tag saying it was removed 😕
I want to say it's a dpi or tablet mode setting that Google tries to find to match the screen. I've always noticed that they are unsure how to display the store with the Play Store so you get what OP is describing with either a small screen or it being filled up.

I still think Google shouldn't have removed beta from the Play Store integration.
That's a problem in Android as well. I understand if the update has new required permissions but auto update is set up...

No, you find a non profit organization connected with the city or county and as soon as you mention a revitalization project for pedestrian pathways then you will get the ears of city or county commissioners.

You mean pavilions that can be reserved for *gasp* public gathering events?
If you think the old criteria was any better...

Let's see: water fountains, church crosses, church lake, church cross across lake to make it look different but it's the same item, church sign, anything with park approved, generic information signs used as waypoints before the actual portal, pavement markings of random items, murals within fast food restaurants, gateways with no actual substance of meaning, house development entrance signs, and so on...

I still submit about portals with exploring and that's what I have seen with OPR now more than ever compared to the backlog. I've been playing since beta but come on, you know the bullshit that is present.
It's better than water fountains. At least they stated that water fountains have to be unique and have pedestrian access. If it's a stormwater fountain, it's not going to get approved.
Gazebo within parks and churches I see no problem with but after that, it just really goes by how it was established and something for the general public.

What you stated is an employee hangout like you said. The design is probably Walmart standards with the same metal used.
Public art in the park is usually a donation to the city or county. It's nothing cheap either.
What?
Yes.

The Lawson beacons were for the Lawson stores as an event. You couldn't buy them.

Circle K promotion started in Arizona originally because that's where its headquarters is located. The Circle K Rewards program is a separate entity in Arizona most likely due to the company having to claim taxes with prizes separately or some form of legal terms. It took a year before they moved it to to Circle K national along with the Circle K cubes.

The problem was the 5k approvals for onyx. I wouldn't be surprised if they made a new version of the Seer badge seeing as they pushed Seer to Seer Points and everything else to Portals Discovered. Make the badge not count for leveling and made the criteria low for the tiers.
*looks at capsule of Lawsons and living in the USA*
They made them unhackable way before even announcing the partnership was going to end. I still think they stopped MUFGs becoming obtainable in the network (only redeemable with loadout passcodes) to look at the duplication of illegal items issue because it was the same time they finally found ways to hide the COMM spam and send out emails to agents with illegally duplicated items.
And? Your photo will still get uploaded to the portal if it's marked as a duplicate.

I can see the concern if Seer was still present but... fuck it, Niantic is probably going to add something for OPR approved portals as a badge but 2 years after the fact. I can see the concern.

Anyone notice that Google apps no longer have "What's New" with updates?
If there's no gated entry to the community, I would say they can pound sand. Private streets have to be marked at the entrance and explicitly state no thru traffic. Anyone can put signage up saying the parking lot is for residents only but the only time this *could* be enforceable is it's a MUTCD sign. A great hint is if the parking lot is up to ADA (not the refactor) guidelines. Handicap parking spots MUST be paved.

The updates aren't instant, if there's any issue with a security update they will postpone the update. I'm still on the December 2017 security patch no matter requesting for an update. If you're going to mention the flash images, that's circumvent of the "instant" nature you're trying to describe.

I don't care about other Android OEMs when Google should be showing an example since it's their own OS. It didn't take until extreme backlash on the Pixel 2 XL for Google to up the support to 3 years. It's still pathetic because Google has abandoned their previous devices once the warranty is over or the device is no longer on their store. I say this for all previous Nexus and Pixel devices from Google.
And OG Pixel are fucked with 2 years of support, a device launched a year prior, and oh hey Android P is going to be their last official OS upgrade.

I'll believe it when I see Google providing life to their own phones after the official support ends. That's pretty much the true test of Treble.
Google is also going to avoid doing that as well with their phones.
I would have to see. I remember when I poked in the last apk it had mod_detailed-EXTRA_SHIELD as the description for the Aegis Shield. I imagine the coding now reflects the new naming.

Isn't the government pretty much becoming like that?
There's a website for LFLs, see if the information matches especially if the charter number is presented. Just because there's no streetview doesn't mean I can't verify it through other methods. I shouldn't have to make a photosphere for every portal submission when Niantic hasn't updated the submission screen since 2013. Also, Google Streetview spheres have been getting deleted with no indication to the user - please note that a portal submission isn't always some malicious attempt for the game if you see it over a house. Zoom out, change view to 2D, and look around.
Wouldn't it be simpler to see if it's within the ROW of the road? An easement can be public or private and I know the means to search for them with subdivision plats and permits if you want to *really* get technical with surveys. Keeping it simple, general rule of thumb is that for any parcel you have a 20 ft easement that either goes to the adjacent parcel or onto the road network (usually driveway for residences). The area between a sidewalk and street really depends on the respective zoning codes for that city or county.

I hate to say it but you must be blind. Check submission history past the Canada picture lol

EDIT: Well, he deleted his comment...
Hmmm, looking at OPs history, it's definitely not OP. That's an odd submission history too.
*Board the platforms!*
So... pretty much go [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/7qssr6)
But not too high because of the microphone
That's forever in a dumpster fire
They're still obtainable through loadout passcodes
You can use Messenger when you have your Facebook deactivated. That's probably why you don't hear anyone talk about it in that fashion.
It's going to eventually happen if they integrate it more
And Google Voice took its place when it launched in 2009
The bird isn't doing a nudge with its beak or anything so it looks like it trusts the owner.
What's hilarious is Google is making everything white, even the nav bar. I want to say they are using Pixel 2 XL as an excuse for this
Well I know what I'm expecting later this week
From the other video I posted, I doubt it. Looks like this birb is bonded with the owner. If anything, a friendly nibble at the worst.
Not my video even though I do have an African Grey.

You can condition them over time to do these things. I'm surprised with the owner on this one as the chest area is usually where they are defensive about.
Probably he got the cat
*squeak*
That's cause Go is Niantic... enough said
[Here's another video of her ](https://youtu.be/0ywEmGpvpNo)

It's amazing what you can do with them.
Ding ding ding. The notaries are the ones who record the license you provide them at the time of signing the document. I see this will all incoming county documents for any land development application.
Contracts for anything as you are stating I am agreeing to to their terms and conditions as written. The signature is added with initials throughout the document to specifically state further intents of the contract.
Were you going for a haiku? I can see the line spacing when I reply, one syllable too much on first and third line unless you want to push for free verse haiku lol

Also, you said male. Enough said.
African Greys are insane with sounds and even comprehending when to make them
A music festival where I know an amnesty box is set up to drop drugs before entering, no questions asked. The EDM themed festivals where a lot of designer drugs are getting sold.
Not a touchy subject for them!
Followed by the dead stare of "why did you do that?" I'm guessing
Actually the 4k upvote one is the repost. Note the difference in title
I have an annual pass but I haven't been going ever since Irma.
But that's EPCOT! lol, I don't doubt you
What a terrible article.

[Direct link to Chromium](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/862199). It's still a work in progress.
This doesn't sounds like Disney World...

That would just make FTC matters much worse.
Ingress is in the process of becoming a boardgame so sheets could work lol
Which isn't logical.

She could make light of the situation on her social media to just get input from her fans.
I didn't even see the auto pilot comment but everything else in his reply are things that should be standards for today. Autonomous vehicles are definitely the future but the infrastructure for those vehicles will be the first step. I'm also unsure about the private sector being involved as it's going to eventually deal with public roads.
Ah so perfect texture for Florida weather. It all makes sense now.
IRL
That's stuff that should be *standard* for *today*.
The cell size is based on Google's S2 which is how we also have our region cells (z6 lines up with the region cells). I don't know what you mean by changing cell size when that hasn't happened.
The article is terrible. Who the hell wrote that?
Oh that's pretty cool! I imagine it's something used for geocaching by proxy.
Yep, the portals within OPR 😉
That's like three opinions!
Portals Discovered is a combination of portal submissions you got approved with Seer (portals submitted before September 2015) and portals submissions approved within OPR (portals submitted since late September 2017)
The thing is HMDB entries aren't constantly grabbed. I want to say it was was like the initial grab of data points with post offices and fire stations. One import and nothing more because I don't even think Field Trip reflects any new data. They could probably do the same thing they did with Panorama and remove the pictures imported that say "HMDB.org" while still retraining the content. All of the content is user submitted anyways.
What does one try to obtain from a hiking app? Would it be like a download set of available trails with a compass displayed?
Wait, really? If so then I really don't remember the 360 launch.

EDIT: Wikipedia confirms it was 360 exclusive for a month before the PC launch. I stand corrected. I didn't get the game until the Humble bundle so I never knew.
Wasn't it originally a PC game? This news is such non news
You're not an all star
You know it will be FMT - Florida Man Time
