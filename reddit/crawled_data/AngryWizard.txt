I'm too dumb for tabletop simulator! Seriously I think there might be something wrong with me that I feel so stupid when I try to figure tts out. I did, however, go ahead and buy smash-up from the play store despite the bad reviews; I've played two games so far and I think I'll really get my $1.49 worth so I'm glad I tried it out. 
I was stoked to see smash-up, then I read the Android reviews. They are pretty brutal. 
That's pretty strange, I wonder if that's how online co-op works on pc as well. 
I may never have caught this one. I just rewatched this two weeks ago and I thought it was a napkin because she was eating. 
Turns out this one is one of the photoshopped submissions from  r/photoshopbattles.

Ah I see. I grew up in NY and England (if either has bearing) and I say both lawn and lon very short like la la la. 
I say lon and lawn exactly the same way. Hmmm. I'm not sure how to say them differently, unless you're from the south and draw lawn out like laaown. 
lawn - jer - ay

(j like zh in Zsa Zsa Gabor) 
(ay like hay) 
Thank you for this. 
Vanquish is not my type of game AT ALL. The story is completely forgettable; I have no idea 6 years later what it was about. The game is fast, it's loud, it's bullet hell, it's big, flashy and goes a mile a minute. I'm old and slow and prefer slow, thoughtful games. 

But I *loved* Vanquish! Loved it so much that when I beat it I immediately tried (and totally failed because I really do suck at shooting things) to beat it again on hard. I still can't explain, other than powersliding being wicked cool, why it resonated with me, but holy shit what a wild, fun ride. 
>Game time is 2 p.m. 

>TV: The game will be shown on SEC Network.



Had to go looking for this so I'm pasting it for others. Specific  channels and radio stations in article.

Reddit loves to do this to "Nazi's". Why on earth would you think the word Nazis needs to be possessive. Buncha Nazis. 
It's impressive to me that I've never changed mine's batteries and he still talks and lights up. 
Right? So kind, clumsy, curious and unimposing. Not like those terrorist Gremlins from the same era. 
Ha, for bedroom hotdogs!! 🌭 

Seriously, I went to the kitchen to grab something familiar for scale, like a can of soda, but I only drink those mini half-cans of soda because a whole can is too much, so that would have confused things further. I stared into the fridge until I decided upon mustard; anyone from the US, at least, is super familiar with that size. 
I just really love ET. One of my favorite bits of pop culture from my childhood. And as it turns out, I have no idea what 3 feet looks like, he's not nearly that tall. [Here he is, mustard for scale.](https://imgur.com/a/KtvZI) He talks if you squeeze his hand. 
So I guess you wouldn't like the 3 foot ET that I have in my bedroom! 
I got my BS in Zoology and have never called myself a zoologist. After college I ended up working in insurance then accounting. If I had gone to work in a zoology field I guess I could have called myself a zoologist, but I don't think my degree alone granted me that title.

Hey there. For help remembering how to spell definitely, just remember that there are a **finite** number of ways to spell de**finite**ly.

It isn't grammatically correct (I read it twice before correcting it to "just been standing" in my head) but it looks like it's becoming more popular and accepted in the UK.

I'm not trying to pick on you OP, I too just thought the phrasing was interesting and unusual. Thanks for sharing the picture; it looks so peaceful. 
Uh-NEM-uh-knee
You take that back, Buffybot was amazing. She made fantastic peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and complimented Anya on her money. 
I don't know why I find it soooo hilarious. People *hate* it though, which just makes it funnier! I'm not having kids so maybe I'll name a dog Qbert and get it out of my system. 
Oh boy, I'm laughing and enjoying the praise as much as I usually laugh and enjoy the scorn when I tell people I'm naming my first born son Qbert. 
Same! I don't want to know, because I don't want any redditor's personal info, but at the same time I'm curious if it's something magical like Gladiola Delacroix or Beatrix Antimony.

Yeah it was top story on my Google News even though I live in TN and rarely watch hockey. 
Oh wow, I hadn't so I just Googled it. Consider me sexually awakened. I'm into the one that looks like a goldfish. 😁 
Yeah I had to scroll back up and reread the question when no one seemed to be choosing characters played by real people, just lots of cartoon and video game characters. 

I'm a pretty 'live and let live' person, as long as it's not hurting anyone, so it's fine, it's just something I've never considered. I've never been attracted to, or like in the question, had any type of "sexual awakening" to a cartoon character. 

Lara Croft played by Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider movie? Ya, 100% (times a billion) get that. Lara Croft played by pixels in Tomb Raider on ps1? Nooope. 
It's actually *not* about cartoon characters, just "fictional character", which is why I find it surprising that most of the answers are cartoon characters. I expected a lot of characters from books and characters in TV and movies played by actors rather than Bubbles from The Powerpuff Girls. 
> being all crybabies about it.

Such an apt description of the anti-gay busybodies! I don't think anyone can escape a full Buffy the Vampire Slayer watch through without learning at least one valuable lesson. 
Mine does too actually - usually a tangerine and some gold foil wrapped chocolate coins for tradition's sake. 
Ugh, what a pain in the ass! I check my Now by swiping at least 2 or 3 times a day, so swiping towards nothing now feels really weird. Thanks for posting this so at least I know I'm not crazy. 
I see this post is a week old but I came looking for answers. My left swipe to Google now is gone also as of today. Restart doesn't bring it back. Did you find out anything new about it? 
10¢ in 1876 actually seemed like a lot so I looked it up in an inflation calculator:

>What cost $0.10 in 1876 would cost $2.34 in 2017.

Probably paying for the novelty at the time, but that's an expensive banana by today's 'easily accessible produce' prices. My mom told me when she was a little girl in England she would get an orange in her Christmas stocking because oranges were more of a rare treat.

Thanks for the info banana bot! 
The documentary premiered on Netflix a couple of weeks ago and lots of people are watching and talking about it. Netflix has a ton of subscribers. Half of my friends are watching Wild Wild Country and I don't think any of them would have any clue about rooster teeth (I do know it's gaming related and on youtube but I don't know specifically who or what rooster teeth is or does). I think this documentary's popularity has little to do with any YouTube channel. 
It's been driving me mad on mobile for weeks; I felt like I'd suddenly gone crazy, no longer being able to link to images without going to a web page and searching for the image then opening the image in new tab then *finally* grabbing a link to share. 

I think I'm going to try Bing out; I'm a dummy for not thinking of it earlier. 
I think not impossible but comparatively improbable. 
Yeah, as soon as Nick spoke to me I was "We met again, Balethor". 
I think this is why it seems Skyrim only has 10 voice actors, because the other 50 are Belethor.

Edit: so I thought I was being a little hyperbolic with the 'every character sounds like Belethor', but then I actually looked up the characters he voiced in Skyrim...

Feel free to share your rainy pics with us on r/raining if you like. Nice photo. 
Oh damn, that's real. 
Check out r/animalsbeingconfused too. 
You'll see these big discounts on big games every so often and I'll either catch them on here or on r/GreatXboxDeals. I too bought ttf2 on sale last week, and the previous one I can think of that I bought was when Lord of the Rings Shadow of Mordor went on sale for $5. 
I don't, sorry; I didn't know it had to be done at all until this morning. My water heater is 12 years old so I'm sure it has sediment a foot deep.
I own my first house and I had no idea that I'm supposed to flush the water heater. I know I can't change the temperature on mine because of how is installed I can't access it, but I guess I can check to see if I can reach the drainage valve and the cold water cutoffs (I just watched a video on how to flush it). Mine is in a bedroom closet, not a great location but my house is super small. 
Thanks! ☺ 
Not paying close enough attention I guess. Beatles is the spelling my phone's dictionary tries to use if I don't fix it. I had a rough day. 
Alright you've got to explain the Beetles part. No way is that strictly 'boy music'. It was before my time but I remember concert footage of seas of swooning and screaming girls anytime The Beatles did anything. I didn't miss your point though, I get what you're saying about her liking things that aren't strictly girly and you are totally cool with it, but The Beatles thing threw me. The Beetles are for everyone! 🐞 
So many thumbs-down on that video! 
I rarely submit, but even when I find something I think people might like I rarely post it because I can't think of a title. I'm probably the type "seems legit" is made for. 
Agreed, I joined Twitter the first year but never even considered reserving my real name. And, unless I'm just projecting, our email addresses were mostly silly and unprofessional years ago. After having a nicknamey hotmail then yahoo, I finally saw the benefit of making a normal Gmail with my real name. 
Madonna has been political as long as she's been performing. There's nothing 'suddenly political' about her. 
Yep, I obviously know how to delete a rogue gif, but if I *didn't* I'd have to use speech to text to beg for help as my hands would be shaking too much from being thoroughly mortified.

Well shit.

Found 'em, thanks. 👍🏼 👖 And congrats on all the hard work. 
Did you buy those pants recently; wondering if you have a link/brand that I can search? I really like them on you and I'd like to give em a try on me! 
I just found this sub today so I am crossposting something I posted a few weeks ago on /r/Contagiousslaughter as I think it fits here too.

Wooo, green! 
Here's mine from 3 days ago with some discussion. My takeaway, keep restarting my phone, keep an eye on a background app monopolizing the camera (in my case I'm going to be watching instagram to see if there's a correlation).

https://www.reddit.com/r/MotoG/comments/86vdhu/moto_g5_plus_camera_error_making_me_hate_this
I really appreciate you putting these up week after week. 👊🏼
Yeah! I think after I add Bethesda that'll be enough tables for me on xbox though. I have about 20 tables, lots of Marvel and Star Wars, on Steam and I really don't want to rebuy any on principle. 
I got the Fox animation pack (Bob's Burgers etc) during the last sale and I'm thinking about getting the Bethesda pack this time.
Sleeping Dogs: loved the combat, the setting, and the storyline...and for under $5, great buy. 


You're not kidding. That link popped up a half-page ad mostly covering the druid pic, then when I hit the back arrow on my phone instead of bringing me back here it popped up some full page 'you may have won an iPhone' bullshit that I couldn't back out of. Yuck. 
That looks intimidating but I saved the instructions. 
Interesting, thanks for explaining. 
[Ah shit. ](https://giphy.com/gifs/budlight-confused-magic-d3OG0TQUstHYHJBe)
I think you'll find that I'm mostly kind and accommodating. I'm a failure at reddit! Have a great rest of the weekend. 
Well I can't argue with that. :) 
But there are 4 or 5 font sizes to choose from. I have mine set on 'kinda big but not so big that I have to turn the page every 3 seconds'. 
Maxinquaye is one of the best albums ever made, holy shit. Easily in my top 5. I like False Idols quite a bit. 
I'll try it out. 
I'm going to be keeping an eye on instagram to see if that's the culprit, even though instagram never shut down my ability to open my camera on my last phone, an LG. 
Ooh thanks, I'm going to keep an eye on this now. 
Oh, that's something to think about. I don't have Snapchat but I often have instagram open in the background. 
Darn, I have neither of those. I just power cycled my phone and now the camera is opening. It seems like a bug that really should have been patched at some point - frustrating. 
I looked up Google camera in the Play Store and all I can find is cardboard camera by Google LLC which allows you to view photos in virtual reality. Does it have a weird name or do you have a different phone? I know the search function on the Play store isn't the greatest.
You are right, it is way too quiet. Unfortunately I've not found a workaround. 
Moto g5 plus, Amazon version, USA, AT&T, stock.

I knew before I bought the phone that the camera was not going to compete with a flagship, but I thought that I could rely on the camera opening at least. I'm getting really discouraged when I have to try four or five times to open the camera, especially when whatever I wanted to take a picture of has moved on by the time the camera is usable.

I tried going to Settings, apps, camera, clear cache but unfortunately that did not help.

Has anyone solved this problem for good on their g5? 
80% of what I listen to on Pandora is Portishead, Massive Attack, Tricky, Mazzy Star, Air, Morcheeba type stuff. I still love it and never tire of it like I have with some other genres I once loved. 
Thanks! I'll likely just play a few games to see what it's all about then stop. I'm very VERY bad at shooters. I'm old and slow, and even if I were to improve through practice, I have severe anxiety that makes me feel sick and have panic attacks whenever I try competitive multiplayer. I'm a mess but I hate always feeling left out so I at least want to try. I prefer when games have a 'vs AI' mode like Rocket League and Overwatch do; bots don't make me feel nearly as stressed as humans. 😱 
I really doubt they can get to your Xbox payment stuff, I don't have an epic account that has any payment info on it since I don't play on PC. I just did the two-factor because it was easy but it probably wasn't truly necessary. And you're welcome. Actually that subreddit might have some info on the breach as well I didn't think to check.

I plan on trying my first game of fortnite sometime today so I hope this all has been worth it! 
I don't even know tbh. They definitely already have your email though that they pulled from Xbox to make the headless account, so maybe to take better control over the account? I just went ahead and enabled the 2fa even though I haven't even played a single game yet! 

I just went and found that post I was referring to just so other can see what a clusterfuck epic account creation can be. Even crazier is that pc/psn accounts can be linked/shared but xbox/pc cannot, at all. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/80zvvw/information_about_psnxbl_accounts_and_epic_games
Yes, if you skipped making an account on xbox it creates what they call "a headless account" with epic. I know this because I downloaded fortnite yesterday and found a post by epic explaining. It's honestly a big clusterfuck.

In order to claim this headless account, you have to sign in on the website using your Xbox login info to upgrade the headless account. It's honestly weird and so clunky. 
I loved her on SNL for years and I also friggin loved her in Reefer Madness the Musical with Kristen Bell. 
But what if Google finds out I'm shopping for a yurt, won't they know to come out into the woods to find me?
You tried. I carry wet wipes in my bag at all times; get yourself a travel pack of them and you could have had a wet wipe bath in a corner next time! 
Happy birthday. :) 
I can't watch! 🙈
I joined the r/cfb challenge group instead of r/ockytop because I didn't want to drag you all down with my wild guesses. Since I had picks like Arizona going to the sweet 16, you're welcome. 
I think he always does! He did put this disclaimer in his bracket tweet:

>Just because I have more time to watch games doesn’t mean my picks will be better, but here are my brackets this year
I can't ever remember these so I have it stuck beside my monitor on a Post-it note. 
I have Loyola beating Miami as well, but I already fucked up the Oklahoma pick. 
I have Michigan State losing to Kansas because almost every game I picked them to win in college football Pick'em last year they lost, so I'm carrying the disappointment through to basketball. I don't trust em anymore. Michigan State and Texas A&M let me down almost as much as the Vols did last year. 
Obama has Tennessee making it to the sweet 16 then losing to Cincinnatti. [Thanks Obama.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DYRl-5MX4AAY5II.jpg)
I didn't downvote but blackface never crossed my mind. I thought of it as tribal, like warpaint, [like the first slayer had on her face.](https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11114/111146088/5829810-7752618240-07bd0.jpg) I wouldn't call the first slayer's mud blackface either.
I did expect him to pop up at the end didn't you guys? So yeah that definitely stood out, his absence.
I wish I could stop myself from being optimistic about Tennessee football. No matter how hard I try the optimism creeps up on me.
From @Vol_Football Twitter:  https://twitter.com/Vol_Football/status/973330245095952385?s=20

Oops, should have put football in the title. 
Yeah I suppose they're all guesses no matter how much anyone knows about basketball. I made a few weird picks though, like New Mexico State upsetting Clemson. I also picked Tennessee to win out and I'm having second thoughts now about the wisdom of that shit actually happening!
Cool, thanks for checking!
Bracket name is my username, AngryWizard. (And I'm really hoping it doesn't show my real name because it's showing it when I click on myself). And I did use your link, yeah.
I made an account and I filled out a bracket and I *think* I joined this group, but I was never asked for the group password so I'm a little concerned I missed something.
Well I'm just wildly guessing to fill out my bracket, so I didn't want to bring down the rockytop average if I joined in on the cbb group. 
First "happy cake day" I've ever gotten, thanks! 
I see that sick-face and it's a sprint to the door and out into the yard.
So glad people enjoyed it; I watched it through 4 times this morning, laughing with her every time.

I don't know how to direct link Twitter videos so I ran it through streamable.
Tennessee athletics have me so agitated in general that I can't even feel smug with a 19 point lead.
Thanks for confirming I'm not the only one who doesn't have the days/times/opponents memorized! And I mean that unsarcastically too. On the one hand I knew I couldn't be alone in having to google it, but on the other I was wondering as I was typing it if I was posting something super obvious.  
Damn, just about!  
From Wikipedia:

>Rodney Mullen won his first world skateboard championship at the age of 14

So he may very well have been the best even at 13. 
Yeah he would only have been 13 when the 70s ended. 
And details so no one else has to search, it's Arkansas vs Tennessee at 3:25 p.m. on ESPN. 
That was really hard to watch. 
I'm feeling a little silly now; I've avoided filling up at any BP station since 2010 because of the way they handled Deepwater Horizon. I knew I couldn't make a difference alone anyway but now it's even more pointless than I thought. 
Who goes there?! 
I feel shitty for not knowing this, but I'm glad I know now. Thanks for posting.
Alright I'll give yellow a try. 
I always get the white, do the yellow and white really taste different? I just get the white because they look nice. 
I'm pretty sure I'll still be using reddit is fun when I'm 80. I'm not good with change. 
It's much easier than I expected; I had the Play Store on my kindle fire in about 10 minutes by following along with a YouTube video. 
I think the fact that things are so much more fluid and can change on a dime actually helps a little; things take more time and maneuvering in football which is more stressful for me. But more importantly, I'm just so flippin' invested in Volunteer football, whereas I've only watched 3 men's bball games this year. I've certainly made myself sick over some of the Lady Vols championship runs back in the 90's and 00's though so I do know it's not a cakewalk!
I'm watching this shit thinking hey, well at least it won't make me feel like I'm going to pass out, throw up and die from stress like watching Tennessee football. 

Then with 2 minutes left to go my stomach's in knots; nowhere near football level stress, but still wound up as fuck. Whew! 😌 
😨😬😰
Nah, browns and tans. 
Niiiiice. Go Vols.

Two Echo Dots here, both stopped working/responding sometime between 11 a.m. and 12:30 eastern. They just glow blue if I try to use them and eventually tell me they are having trouble or they are not connected. 
While I remember loving it, I must admit, it might be a terrible movie and I would never know because I was just so transfixed by seeing, for the first time, two women in bed together. I've been a fan of Uma Thurman's work ever since.

And my Guess ad was an actual huge marketing poster that I snagged from a department store. 
I have almost the same experience as your first paragraph except for me it was Henry and June *then* Poison Ivy. After I finally figured out girls could kiss each other and that I was super into doing that, I had Drew on my wall for years in poster form [from her Guess ad.](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/enhanced/webdr01/2013/8/8/14/enhanced-buzz-8052-1375988174-12.jpg?downsize=800:*&output-format=auto&output-quality=auto)

Can you explain the face to me? I suppose the O's are eyes but is the w 2 noses or 2 angry joined up eyebrows or fangs or what?
And I learned *another* new thing from a lot these comments, that Bradford pear trees smell like semen; being a gay lady I'm at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to identifying semen trees! And you're fine, I just thought it might help temper expectations if I pointed out he's not a writer by trade, just a Bradford pear hater. 
We've got a lot of beautiful dogwoods down here so hopefully I don't read anything horrible about those. :) 
I swear this was just a coincidence; I didn't see the Bradford pear at the top of the sub when I came here to post the anti pear story this morning! It's amusing though that they are currently side-by-side. I do think Bradford pears are really pretty and wish they weren't shitty trees. 
Not discounting your take, but hopefully people can cut him a *little* slack since he's a landscaper/arborist, not a journalist. His anti-pear tree rant got through to me and taught me something new (so mission accomplished I suppose). 
Yeah I'm definitely going to warn my dad not to plant any more. Kudzu is a well-known menace down here in the southeast but I don't think the weak yet invasive pear is nearly as common knowledge. 
I don't know if "tree news" articles are allowed on here, but I found this fascinating. When I think about all of the times I've paused to admire a beautiful white bradford pear I feel guilty for my misplaced admiration! My parents had to have their bradford pear removed a few years ago because it started breaking off and now I understand why. Paired with what an invasive menace it is, ruining other pears, I'll never look at this tree the same way again.

Oh, I see. Well maybe my comment helped someone else not follow Trump. :) 
There are also Twitter accounts that just retweet him that you can follow instead of him, such as @UnfollowTrump: https://twitter.com/UnfollowTrump

This is fucking shit. Shit idea, shit results. What a pile of shit. 
Oh oh, better learn to spell college before you apply. 
Are you familiar with that gif of the dog with the 100 yard stare in front of the plate of cupcakes? I think that's the look I just got on my face as, for a minute, I pictured Kristen Bell in the Buffy role. Wow, she definitely would have been a fantastic slayer. I don't picture Sarah as easily in the Veronica role because Sarah doesn't have that playfulness that Kristen does. Sarah has (imo) a 'weight of the world on her shoulders' feeling to her acting which fit perfectly for Buffy. 
It makes me giddy just thinking about a new Whedon universe! One where he has the freedom to really be himself, sink or swim, without network meddling, catering to advertisers, prime time prudishness, etc. 
You can on certain apps, reddit is fun app being one that shows the edit asterisk. 
Thanks for the advice and link, this is perfect. 
Is it important to start with season 1 on Halt and Catch Fire? I'm so glad I didn't try to start Buffy the Vampire Slayer with season 1 or it wouldn't be my favorite show and that would be a damn shame. (I love season 1 now for its cheap, campy innocence but that was a really hard sell for me to start out). 
As I started paragraph one I was thinking "Awww".

By the time I got to this paragraph...

>Whedon will face no shortage of suitors, as Netflix, Apple and others will likely vie for the next creation from the writer-director behind cult TV series such as Firefly and Dollhouse.

...I was already daydreaming about potential Joss Whedon Netflix series. 
Not even a week or two back in my comment history I named Theme Hospital as the game I'd most like to see remade. I'm going to be super excited if this new game is anything like the old one! 
And the record for highest points ever for a Fulmer Cup win. 
I just watched it. I admit it was kinda weird but nowhere near the train wreck the internet set me up to witness. Then I read her apology where she said something like 'I love this country and I tried my best' and I went ☹️
Oh okay, thanks I'll look around.

Unfortunately I was not as big a fan of the flashbacks of the play they were putting on, the romance, or the politics. It just fell flat for me, making me a very angry wizard indeed! Jk, more like a disappointed wizard. 
>Both are great books. I like the next gentlemen Bastards books, but not all agree. 

I also really liked book 2, but the third one, ugh, not my cup of tea. 


I read Promise of Blood and the Lies of Locke Lamora both in the same year and I was (and still am) positively giddy about both.

Congrats Brian! 
No kidding. I'm very introverted and I live alone, but the thought of being completely cut off from society, access to a hospital, mail delivery, wifi, from grabbing a loaf of bread or some cough medicine from the dollar store, etc, feels frightening and impossible to truly imagine. I prefer living my quiet, isolated life among civilization and conveniences. 
Same with step 2, if you could ever get to step 2. Why have the arrows in infinite loops like that? What an awful design. 
Maybe I'll give season 2 a shot sometime. Buffy the Vampire Slayer didn't win me over until it leaned less on monster of the week format and more on big sweeping arcs starting at the end of season 2. 
I've tried twice to watch Supernatural (I made it to the end of season 1 on the 2nd try) and I've given up twice. On paper I should love it, so I'm not sure why I hate it so damn much. I wish I liked it because there's so much of it. 
I do this as well. I know there are lots of modern shows I should be watching, and I do watch some, but mostly I'll find myself watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer for the millionth time. I did branch out (but not forward) recently and start Smallville. 
Thanks! And it was a good lesson to learn about stupidly storing coins in unsafe places. 
This is my 2nd favorite dogecoin gif. [This one still in 1st.](https://i.imgur.com/kna7H9Y.gif)
This gif makes me so dang happy. I lost the last of my dogecoin in the great dogetipbot disappearance of 2016 (I think it was '16) but could never bring myself to unsub from r/dogecoin. 
Bad bot. 
I was going to guess Irish Setter and miniature pinscher. ☺ She's so unique, dainty and gorgeous. 
Eww, just the thought of a jaffa cake with cream in it, like a twinkie, is off-putting. 
Oh I believe this 100%. I heard a rumor about Weinke the same day I heard Gillespie was leaving, I just didn't I think it was worth connecting the dots since he's an ex quarterback. 
I was about to ask about this myself but got distracted. I was wondering how common a qb coaching rb's or any Heisman winner coaching a position they never played is. 
I loved it too, I played the heck out of ET.

I have two that I'd be so stoked to pre-order:

**Theme Hospital** by Bullfrog and **NCAA Football [Current Year]** by EA.

Theme Hospital is honestly one of my favorite games I've ever played and a current version with updated graphics and a little more customization (in addition to the old plants, benches, soda machines and heaters to keep people happy) would have me on cloud nine.

NCAA Football, because I took it for granted since the late 90s that it would always be around, and now there's a void in my life that I used to fill by taking the University of Tennessee Vols or the underdog University of New Mexico Lobos to repeat National Championships. 
I don't *feel* like a Kevin. That Kevin though, what a citag. 
This is the one. I have a couple of friends that still to this day we call each other citags because of t9. 
I'll buy a bag of succulent mix when I try again. My aloe died too so maybe they both hated the soil. 
Could be, it came with that strange soil with little white bits of Styrofoam looking stuff in it. 
Jade plants hate me so much. I think they are beautiful and I've tried twice, but I can't keep them alive. My most recent attempt: I purchased a jade, a peace lily and a zz plant. ZZ is doing great and never complains, peace lily and I have a tumultuous relationship because it pretends like it's dying every time I forget to water it for a day or two, but the Jade plant just gave up and fell to pieces after 2 months. I'm afraid to try again. 
Ordered, thank you! 
I really wanted him to stop and let that running person hop in for the getaway. 
That's funny because I almost added "but I bet she's trying her best" to my comment, but second guessed my wild assumption. Dang it! Keep being cool Ashley, even though you hide your folders like a champ. 
Now I'm frustrated with Ashley too. 
Ah yeah, I just double checked and it only shows one image for me on mobile app. I wasn't sure whether I should even say anything, but whenever I buy any type of art books off Amazon I always check out some images of the interior pages before purchasing, whether supplied in the listing or customer uploaded.  Good luck with your books! 
You should consider adding a 2nd picture to the Amazon listing (if you are able). From the front cover alone I'm not completely sure what the interior pages will look like and I swiped left hoping to see. 
Good video, thanks for sharing. When he brought up World of Warcraft I was surprised, but now I'm surprised that I was surprised. I've spent a ridiculous amount of time in that game in peaceful, warm, friendly, happy environments, alone or with friends, with such a sense of contentment surrounding us. We even create our own hygge by placing campfires, carrying around toys like pillows, love seats, picnic baskets, and using toys and items to make our environment prettier and welcoming so we can sit, rest and take it all in. We place down sandbox tigers to ride with friends and strangers, we put down a fish to kick back and forth. There's just very often such warmth and fellowship in "hanging out" in Azeroth. I just hadn't really thought of it all before in terms of hygge. 
I just hope the single player is solid and robust, then any additional game mode is just gravy. I highly doubt I'll touch the battle royale or team vs team mp myself. 
Oh what was the other one, I missed it. 
And live in a mansion? 
I enviously watched a few shed building videos on YouTube. I'm not built for construction unfortunately. 
I didn't think of that. Then again I don't have a truck, trailer or strength to move one anyway. I'm going to look though, thanks for the suggestion. 
Is that a garage or a basement? I'm so dang jealous of people with a garage or basement, I have absolutely no storage in my little house. I tried to price some storage buildings from Lowes this summer and they are like $1500+. Anyway that looks like a really good, dry place to work on your big slab of wood. Good luck!

What do you do about the ones that won't release your pd? I've tried two chains who said no; I think by law they have to give you your prescription, but not the pupilary distance, which is needed for online orders. 
It was a little funny at first, a spinning pitbull is a weird sight, but yeah it became pretty sad when she was hurting herself, and you could hear/see the frustration she felt not being able to stop. Crazy doggie. It's okay, I have anxiety issues too so we didn't judge each other.
It's super sad to watch when an animal is obviously miserable and still can't stop. I've seen other dogs lick raw spots like that before and it looks so painful. We eventually had to resort to surgery over the tail chasing; chopping that tail off fixed the problem, but it sucks that it came to that.
Pitbull (American Staffordshire Terrier) that I adopted at 6 weeks old from the pound. She definitely had some anxieties, poor thing. Kindest and smartest dog I've ever met though. I had her for 14 years. 
There is actually; my dog was on Prozac because she was obsessed with her tail to the point where it was significantly hurting her quality of life but she couldn't stop chasing it. 
I just started a kids book that you lot talk about reading in your youth but I totally missed out on: Redwall. 
Oh, I thought when you said that the wish list will be remembered in Libby that you meant that the wish list was available in Libby. 
I keep checking Libby for wishlist integration but so far haven't found it. I keep the OverDrive app on my phone just add things to the wish list. Are you saying that Libby has pulled the wish list over to their app on your version?
Turkish delight doesn't even look all that delicious to me. If I was going to fuck over my family for dessert, it would have to be for something like Amaretto cheesecake or that pistachio Indian ice cream, kulfi. 
Maybe you could pull up your pharmacy app to show that you have a prescription; not sure how far that'd get you but it might prevent things going south. I'd never heard that you can't carry pills in the weekly pill planner snap cases though so idk. 
I've never seen a piggy this color before. Really pretty! 
My first thoughts were the [WoW corrupted blood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrupted_Blood_incident)  pandemic studies, and the movie Pontypool with its very unique infection method (I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't watched). 
Google thinks this story is important too; I got it as a push notification and I don't get many of those for breaking news. 
You're so blind. 🎶 
Damn that's pretty awesome, especially considering they don't have to follow the roads. 
They seem so slow, but i've never seen one 'floor it'. 
I'd never thought about this before. Do they fly to different events or do they get deflated packed and shipped to different events, I wonder. 
Gadzooks in 1996.
I'm sure mine would have transferred too if I'd actually had any! I guess I was mistaken and mine were all on steam. 
I grabbed them and I'll try them out tomorrow; I think $6 is a good price for 4 tables. I hope I do like Bob's Burgers because it's my favorite of the 4 shows, but I like them all. 🍔 
Yeah I tried, game says nope. I really think I got mixed up by playing the tables I own on Steam on the living room TV, where I play Xbox, instead of on my computer. But it's okay because now I own 4 tables (and Sorcerer's Lair) on Xbox for when I'm not in the mood to mess with Steamlink. 
I really thought I had some to import but fx3 says I don't. 
I thought I had a handful of pinball fx2 tables to import but fx3 says nope. Maybe I'm confused since I sometimes play fx2 tables on the living room TV via Steam big picture, but I really thought I had some on xbox too.

Regardless, any Pinball FX aficionados have an opinion on the Balls of glory pack (Bob's Burgers, American Dad, etc)? I really enjoy the source material so unless the tables are garbage to play I think I'll grab those four.

He's *too* special! Yes there are special football players, but I wouldn't want to see Coleman risk a talent like this getting tackled and rolled up on by a bunch of bruisers. In fact he should probably be kept in bubble wrap. 
You might already know this and just didn't have any reason to look, but flip your phone to landscape mode if you ever *do* want to check out a long/secondary flair on RiF. 
That's 43.74 yards for those who, like me, can only visualize distances in relation to a football field. Just imagine being able to cover almost half a football field in under 4 seconds. 
Ha, right there with you. I'm pretty sure my future will one day involve one of those special chairs that has a motor in it to tip me up onto my feet. 
I think 5 or 6 years. It's people who have usernames like Bob that are the real reddit pioneers. 
Yeah I don't know any (though I'm sure there are some) ladies who advertise it. I have a gender neutral gt and I never use voice on xbox except in private party chat. I rarely even correct people on reddit who call me 'man' unless it's relevant. You're right, it's so much less trouble to lie low. 


OP may not be from an English speaking country (because of the odd "on summer" phrasing) so may not be familiar with Ellis. Of course that's just a guess that I pulled out of my arse. 
A private employer, maybe, but the government? I don't think our government should have such expectation of privacy that a photo of a meeting with the Secretary of Energy is treated as illegal. (But I too may be wrong). 
Could you pm me a link to the sturdy ones you like? I've never worn a pair of leggings, but pockets might change that. 
I think you're taking my comment a little too seriously; I'm not a conspiracy theorist who sees coded messages leading to pizza shop basements or something. I merely confirmed what the guy said, observed that was super weird (*of course* knowing what we know now is what makes it weird), and opined that the video is like something you'd see on a sketch show (the outfits, the Elvis wedding officiant, that dude's hair, to elaborate) if it wasn't such a horrendously dark topic. Don't *you* be damn silly. 
You are not going crazy, he absolutely gestured to all the kids and sang 'never let them go'. I really don't know what to make of this, it's like a horrendously dark comedy sketch. 
I'm not super passionate about NFL like I am cfb, so my loyalties are a bit wishy-washy. 

As a little kid, my godparents loved the Dolphins; I thought their uniforms were pretty, Dan Marino was handsome, and dolphins are cool animals, so I liked the Dolphins. 🐬 

My high school mascot was a Viking so I felt (and still feel) benevolent towards the Minnesota Vikings. 

I sometimes root for the Buffalo Bills because it's the closest team geographically to where I grew up and buffalo are cool animals. 🐃 

When the Oilers moved to Tennessee then changed their name to the Titans I wasn't sold, but I found myself warming up to them over the years. Marcus Mariota convinced me to go all in on the Titans. 
Mine cost ~$36.
Look at that lil egghead! 
I'm mostly looking for a new low-mid complexity solo game (I have Friday boxed and Onirim digital); Gloomhaven sounds amazing but a bit intimidating, so I put Arkham Horror card game in my Amazon cart. There were lots of different results listed under Arkham Horror card game, looks like lots of expansions. I suppose the plain base game is where to start unless there's a base + dlc bundle  that I should know about. 
Thanks! Still pretty pricey but way better than $240.
Gloomhaven is showing on Amazon as $260 pre-order; is that valid or is that just some third party vendor being weird and it will that come down once it releases do you think?
Ah, my bad then. So groundsmen is rope guy and cleanup guy? 
I had a feeling they probably made more. I'm sure you don't start climbing until you've been roping and watching for a while. 
I won't say for sure you're wrong, but I doubt the $10/hr rate. The last tree crew that cut across the street from me was 3 men, 8 hours, $1200. So that what, $50/hour for each guy if they split it equally. I don't know how they split it though, maybe the tree climber guy gets paid more than the rope pulling guy, and maybe the rope guy gets paid more than the clean up guy. Anyway, that shit's expensive. 
I couldn't do it, but then again my life isn't very good and I hate the thought of bringing more bad upon myself through dishonesty. I did return a book one time, within 15 minutes of purchase, after instantly regretting that I didn't spend my credit on a different book. I'm hoping they won't hold that against me since there was obviously no time for me to listen to it. 
Guardians of the Galaxy 2 snuck up on me the same way. 
That's not what I was expecting, it's much more porta potty like than I'd imagined. Thanks for the photo. 
What are the bathroom pods like inside? Is there room to stand, move, just sit? 
No, if it was in the mudroom she'd have been able to change the channel. 
Reddit loves Val Kilmer and his great AMA's (official ones and spontaneous ones). And with good reason; he gives detailed, thoughtful answers, like he actually gives a shit, which is pretty cool. 
Thanks for the link, watching now.

Edit: I like listening to him talk about football. He wears big shirts. 
Oops I hadn't refreshed the comments for a bit so I didn't see another reply. Still, SEC markets are very heavily represented here even with VA and OH. 
And Ohio. 
Seconded! 
Why does watchespn freeze every time Alabama gets in scoring range, it's like a sick joke designed to induce madness. 
I'm half watching with the game muted in protest of either of these teams winning. 🤢

Go Bama D. 
I'd just assumed he let me win, but now I'm not so sure. 🤔 
I'm surprised it hasn't dawned on him yet that the professional knight he "beat" was just playing along letting a young kid have some fun. I might need to start telling people about how I "beat" my dad in arm wrestling when I was 7.
I stupidly put a lot of my dogecoin in dogetipbot wallet, possibly all of it, I can't remember now. I took the loss pretty well at the time when the bot ran off with our doge, but if the price goes to the moon then I'll have another regret to add to the regret pile. I miss doge tipping, it was my favorite thing about being here.

And yeah, I don't know how to sell it either. I bought mine from moolah.io before that whole clusterfuck, at which point I lost faith in shady exchanges (only to trust a tipbot!). I might be too dumb for crypto. 
Found his Twitter, thanks. 
It could definitely be my bias showing, but Charisma looks like she's had enough.
Casual Titans fan here that found this in my /rising (I'm a cfb fan trying to learn to love the NFL); that was super interesting to watch. Does that guy do videos like this a lot? 
I had to look that up because I hadn't heard that before.

>In movies, he is probably best remembered for playing the high school principal who judges the "academic decathlon" in Billy Madison. His brief role in that film included a famous monologue in which he insults the title character, played by Adam Sandler. The monologue was based on a response Downey often gave to SNL cast member (and fellow Billy Madison cast member) Chris Farley in the SNL writers' room when Farley presented certain ideas.
I got into the shallow end of modern boardgames with the help of this sub, but I would still play Clue with anyone at the drop of a hat. I have Simpsons Clue in the tin box with the miniatures and I still think it's great. Hell, I'd probably play mousetrap, candyland, whatever; I just love boardgames. 

I don't think I'd play Monopoly anymore though after discovering the Monopoly Deal card game. If you're serious about still enjoying Monopoly and don't know about the card game, [check it out.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NQQTZCO) It's cheap, fast to play, super easy to learn, and comes with that nice helping of nostalgia. 
And the neck got beefy! 
There are several movie/TV show channels that are free with commercials; Crackle, Tubi and RokuTV are the three I have installed. There's also a channel that kinda simulates cable TV with channels and a guide called Pluto TV that I can almost always find something on. I'm sure there are way more but those are the four things I have installed that I use occasionally in addition to Netflix. 
I've never had a problem with thrift store clothes, I too put them straight in the washing machine as soon as I get home, but I am more wary in the last few years since learning about the horrors of bedbugs.

I can't figure out what Wolff means by this :

>“The media doesn’t need defending by the media,” Wolff said in a February appearance on CNN. “The New York Times front page looks like it’s 1938 in Germany every day.”
Yeah those aren't too bad (except for the word 'jumping' being in there). 
I see, thanks. 
I appreciate your perspective, thanks. I haven't written it off 100%, but I'm not in a hurry to try it either. We shall see! 
You're exactly right, but I'd really love to forget that book if I could. While undoubtedly impressive that a book has forced me to carry the revulsion around with me for 20 years, I create anxiety nightmares for myself on a daily basis and would much prefer to be free of the feelings and images of that book. I want to Eternal Sunshine it right outta my brain! 
I almost bought this last week but I had second thoughts when I realized I didn't want to read any physical descriptions of the spiders. I don't want to hear about their clicky, grabby actions or their shiny, hairy, crunchy, whatever bodies. 

I decided that my aversion would probably negatively impact my enjoyment of the book, as it did two decades ago when I read Naked Lunch. I will never ever forget the sickening revulsion I experienced reading Naked Lunch. It's a shame really because this spider book sounds fantastic otherwise and I'm annoyed at myself for being weak. 
Oh man, she may as well have called it a banana if she's just gonna call shit whatever she feels like. 😉 
Freeze, loading, HD for 3 seconds,  fuzzy SD for 5 seconds, freezes, back to loading, loading, repeat forever.

Completely unwatchable. My internet speed is 60Mbps and I can stream every channel in uninterrupted hdx except watchespn. 
Reddit vampires beware. 
So if Eli refused to take the field for a year and the trade didn't happen, the Chargers wouldn't have had to pay him right? But the Chargers would have wasted a pick. Thank you for the explanation, I really just started trying to pay attention to NFL this year so I wouldn't feel quite so lost when cfb season ends. 
I didn't know this, I didn't know they could refuse at all. Are you able to give a summary of how the Eli thing went down? Why don't all players refuse #1 picks then if they're from the worst teams in the league? 
Roku is pretty locked down ecosystem. Channels have to be added through your Roku account on the the Roku website. There are definitely private channels but even those have to go through the Roku website to be added. I don't understand the nuts and bolts of it but there's a reason why the fire stick is the Kodi device of choice and not a Roku. That said, Roku just works, I like the clean ui, and I like having a remote that's not my phone. 
I meant laundry room as a room in the house for the washer, dryer, ironing board, boxes of detergent, maybe mops and brooms, etc. I grew up calling it a utility room but I think some people call it the laundry room. 
I appreciate your perspective on this as I'm not into NFL like I am cfb, so I only occasionally watch the Titans and all of my Kamara NFL exposure has been highlight clips. 
Of all the questions we could ask regarding Butch's methods and motivations, this is my #1; I'm so damn curious. I love Kamara and I feel like we especially shit the bed when it comes to him chilling on the sideline ways too long. 
I guess not. Washer and dryer are usually in the basement, the garage, the utility/laundry room, or a specially designed hidden laundry closet alongside a hallway. I've not ever seen one in a kitchen in USA. 

I guess I can see it would make it easier to set up the plumbing if it's right near the dishwasher and the sink but I think it's probably uncommon over here except maybe in a studio apartment. 
Yes, I've never seen a washing machine in a kitchen before. 
I love my Rokus and they easily win out over chromecast and firetv for me, but fair warning, Amazon just pulled Twitch off the Roku boxes about a month ago. I already had the app installed so I can still watch, but it is no longer being supported and cannot be installed on new accounts. 
That link is blocked from display by the NFL for me (on mobile in the US), but between both sources hopefully everyone who wants to watch can. 
Mobile site was being a pain for me and not playing the video so here's their source. 

@uSTADIUM’s Tweet: https://twitter.com/uSTADIUM/status/947583331721535488?s=09

Every time I watch Kamara being a rookie superstar I can't help but wonder what could have been had he been our #1 back sooner. 
Yep, my butthole tried to hide way up inside me at that one. 
Even though I'm late to the party, I just *have* to know! Dangling the juicy gossip like a 🥕 
This isn't the other side imo. Poster is a misogynistic troll and probably thinks most women really think like that. Kinda sad. 
It's a misogynistic troll, check the post history. 
That's a big decision that I'll have to save for tomorrow!
Thanks. I grabbed Hyperion kindle book for free (it was $4.99) then added audible for $3.99. 
I wish there was a sort of match-up by subreddits tool. Like maybe I could find my soul mate who also has anxiety and ibs and is super into Buffy, Fallout, and college football. 


No one ever shares their "Went to the gyno, nothing of note happened" stories. 
I gave up trying to stay on the appropriate side of the road in Forza Horizon 3 and Sleeping Dogs. I just can't stick with it for more than 30 seconds then I'm back on the American side again. 
Very glad you guys are finding out about the Forza dlc being on sale (it's the only thing I bought during the sale), so let me recommend r/greatxboxdeals. The holiday sale  has been stickied at the top of the sub all week. It's a great companion to r/xboxone and you won't miss out on weekly, spotlight and holiday sales anymore. 
I bought FH3 Blizzard mountain and Hot Wheels in the xmas sale. Super worth the $12 so far if you don't already own the xpacs.
I didn't know this, but now I do! Liking Forza Horizon was so unexpected, but it sounds like I might not enjoy Forza. 
I think Forza might be the racing game for people who don't like racing games. I don't care for them either and haven't given a crap since Gran Turismo, but Forza Horizon 3 is just fun as fuck. I even bought myself the expansion packs. 
I bought it for $5 and easily got $20 worth of fun out of it. 
Just bought it too. Mostly for Hot Wheels but I've heard blizzard mountain is pretty great itself so I look forward to playing after Christmas. I don't even like racing games but Forza Horizon 3 won me over. 
It's already there!

Low down.
Oh no, you are absolutely welcome to post how you feel in my post. Attention makes me a little uncomfortable, so I love when I post something and people start sharing their own thoughts or talking with each other. I even turned off post notifications so responses don't make me too anxious. I had a feeling that others would be able to relate to this lurking monstrosity and it definitely seems I have company.

I hope you feel less shitty tomorrow, and if not tomorrow, the next day. 
That looks very uncomfortable, I'm sorry. :(
For real though, do you ever tear up when people do things really well that they are incredibly passionate about? I can totally see myself tearing up when they 'bring it'. I get emotional when people are great at something that's physically or artistically impressive, and the truth is I count those competitions routines as a bit of both. My life has no passion, just fear and struggle, so when I see passion and talent I am sometimes filled to overflowing with emotion. 
I. Friggin. Love. Bring it On! Maybe you were crying because there may never again be such a life-changing teenage masterpiece as Bring it On...well, other than Mean Girls. 
Sometimes I forge ahead. Sometimes I get in bed and turn on Buffy and cry and try, try, try not to give up on everything. 
That is amazing! Last year when the mobile game Pokémon Go released I found it a fantastic motivator to explore my world on my own terms. I started making progress and staying away from my house for up to 45 minutes at a time. But then one day my three steps forward became five steps back and I'm too scared to go out for even 15 minutes again. That little taste of the freedom that comes with progress was amazing and it really hurts to have it vanish like Lucy pulling away the football. 
You're welcome. I noticed his stuff is a lot of big things looming over the top of small things. And nightmare fuel. Luck to you too.

I have panic disorder with agoraphobia and I've had to leave the house a good bit lately because of health problems. I saw this gif this morning and it instantly reminded me of how I feel shuffling into yet another doctors office, hospital, clinic, etc, with a constant sense of impending doom hanging over my head that no one else sees, leaving me feeling like a hopeless shell of a person. 
I watched the playoffs last year, it was pretty fun. I wish they'd won, I got pretty into it. Hockey is intense and just non-stop action. College football will always be my #1, but there's definitely a ton of downtime compared to hockey. 
The whole damn state is cursed. 
You did such a great job with him.  😊 
No worries, I actually opened the thread to see who would be kind enough to buy (rather than adopt) a dog covered in demodex! My bestest pitbull also was adopted (she cost $55) and had demodex, but just patches, not the naked mole rat look! So happy op fixed this pup up. 
Person may have asked because it says in the post title "the day I **brought** him vs two years later". So either it's a typo for bought instead of brought or op missed a word (the day I brought him *home*). I read bought twice myself before opening the comments. 
Yeah but no apostrophe needed, it's plural not possessive. 
Yeah, like in a card to grandma!
X's represent kisses. I would feel strange sending kisses to my friends but for some reason British people are super affectionate in texts. I could maybe get behind sending hugs if that became a thing in America (the O's from XOXO represent hugs). 
It's a hugely popular mistake on reddit, one that I'd never seen before joining. I'm super curious as to how the mistaken spelling got more popular here than the real one, but I'll probably never know. Anyway, thanks for being a sport. 
It's shudder (like tremble)! 
I feel like this is a bamboozle. Merk like as in Mercury or merss like Mercedes? And if it's hard C like Mercury, because Merc like merss like Mercedes sounds super awkward, then what do you call Mercuries? Benz really simplifies things. 
If you can slog through the  campiness of a short season 1, about halfway through season 2 the show really starts to find its footing and, relying less on monster-of-the-week format, becomes a friggin masterpiece. Go ahead and start with season 2 if you want; by the time you get to the end you'll happily watch cheesy season 1 just to get more Buffy in your life. 

You won't be the same after you've watched 7 seasons of Buffy. 
I had to let it go for my sanity because I'm having health problems that I'm trying my best to deal with; unfortunately, there are  a multitudes of people in my same position though, and I trust that some are a better place to pursue justice over this abhorrent bullshit. 
Agreed, it's disgusting. 
I did the Search all public filings at this link: 

https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/

I searched first name, last name, state. 
Honestly I felt absolutely sick at the time, I was shaking when I initially called in about it. The lady at the FCC referred me to my state Attorney Generals office, but the AG office people were rude and brushed me off. I had to make the decision to let it go, as I'm dealing with chronic illness and couldn't take on the baggage right now. 
I called the FCC and directed them to the fake (anti net neutrality, Obama overreach, blah blah blah) comment with my name and address, but they told me they could not remove it and there was nothing that I could do now that 'my comment' was on record other than add a new comment in support of net neutrality, but the fraudulent one is still there.  

I felt so used. 
She's not gay, not sure why that person is posting that she is. 
Ok that's a cool coincidence!
Is this just a coincidence or did you set that up? 
Pretty sure that 'woman with guns' was a photoshopped Mariah Carey. 
Oh glad to see this reminder posted, just turned on the game. Tennessee currently up 36 to 29.
Well, pulley for him! 
Yeah I think so too. 
Had there been any news of Butch landing a new job? 
Schiano fallout day was r/cfb all coming over here to point and laugh I'd wager. The unique pageviews the day after schiaNO was almost 78k, whereas the 2nd highest unique pageviews was way down around 17k for the firing of Currie/hiring of Fulmer. The difference there is so massive it has to be down to a huge surge of rubberneckers from cfb. 
Awww that sucks. He should ask for a key though, I moved out at 18 but I've always had a spare key to my parents house. I did try to surprise my dad once for Father's day only to find out he'd gone golfing for the day. But I had a key and mom was there anyway so I didn't need it. 
Oh I did know about the bielema one from seeing it on CFB, but I didn't know if that was more the exception than the rule. I don't follow any sports stuff on Twitter except for the official UT football account. 
Is it traditional nowadays for fired coaches to congratulate their replacement on Twitter? 
I knew someone would be trying to sell a'ight merch before the day was over, but an Alabama supporter trying to sell us Pruitt shirts? Git on outta here before I release the attack asparagus. 
I'm feeling a'ight. 
This is great. And I'm glad she's wearing sensible shoes. 
Ah, well that explains it. I'm not usually quick to jump to hailcorporate but that bottle just looked weird. 
I wanted to hear what Jeremy Pruitt sounds like speaking about things that aren't asparagus (spoilers, still really country) so I pulled up an Alabama press conference from this summer. Throwing the link in here in case anybody else wants to check it out.

P.S. That Coke looks like product placement. 
I read that 'wow' like Owen Wilson.  
He's gonna lose it when he finds out about bok choy.

We might even get Winds of Winter first. 
I constantly forget they exists until I happen across them at some dusty little quickstop. I wonder if they even do any marketing. 
I think Dr Enuf is the Tennessee-ist soda. I remember when I moved down here from upstate New York and discovered Dr Enuf and Cheerwine for the first time. 
I don't like cola, but I do very much enjoy Sprite and Sprite is manufactured by Coca-Cola. 
I'm dreading the fan reaction more than I'm dreading the coach announcement.
Hoping for the best for Shazier, my 2nd favorite Steeler. I don't follow the Steelers but I became aware of him when UT's Dobbs got drafted and I learned that Shazier also has alopecia like Josh and has done a lot for awareness, especially for kids with the disease. He seems awesome and I was so happy for Josh having such a good guy as an alopecia buddy! 
Thanks for responding, I think I'll watch a little let's play from someone playing on xbox to get an idea of the inventory, etc. I definitely want the game, I just need to decide which platform. 
I was curious how divinity plays on xbox, you think it worked well with a controller? Everyone I know has it on pc and used kb+m. 
It's bad guys, I'm even dreaming about the coaching decision now; I woke up this morning having dreamt that Justin Fuente was announced as our new head football coach. I barely know anything about the guy but I had read an article yesterday evening about how he's not interested whatsoever in any offers and my brain ignored context and ran with it. 
That is kinda what it refers to, but rather than a traditional mirror, it's the mirror-like reflection in the black screen of a device, like a phone/tablet with the screen off...humans reflected in technology and all that. 
Trey has a YouTube stream link on the front page if you didn't find it already. 
And the women were undefeated last I looked.
Looking forward to this, thanks; I haven't watched a Vol (or Lady Vol) game yet this season. 
I just seriously can't wait for the coach to be announced and this all to be over. Is there anyone masochistic enough to be enjoying this anymore? 

Signed, Grumpy Old-timer

(I don't want them to rush it and just grab a warm body, but I really am looking forward to having a coach and stability again). 
Oh yeah, I was totally trying to be lighthearted as so many others are being really mean and abrasive in this post. 
Maybe so, I was just making a joke. 😉
Or my front yard in Tennessee. (Get off my lawn OP).

Well I certainly chose the wrong team in cfb pick'ems to win this game. 
There should be a subreddit for crazy ideas like this. 
Is this guy someone special, an athlete? What a dickhole. 
I'm imagining you pronouncing ruin like rrrrrrrrn. 
🐳 💩, if there was a hail emoji you could do whale hail too. 
Yeah, I'm not having fun. I'm really, really tired of it all. So tired, in fact, that I just pondered what my reaction would be if they announced Kiffin 🤢, and I might just roll over and accept my fate at this stage of my coach search fatigue. 
Is it that friggin thunder and lightning song, cuz I hate that song too. 
It's just **SO UGLY**! Congratulations. 😁 
Ah, Farmers and Farm Bureau are two different companies, I guess I'd morphed them into one. 
Is that the Farmers insurance dude? 
I love it

Saved you a click: it's Will Mcbride. 
Interesting read, thanks for sharing. I felt worried reading the statements from a few players against him, but then I read the contradictory statements from players that support him so I'm back to neutral. Impossible to know for sure one way or another from that article. 
TIL his name was spelled Paul Bearer! That's so silly and I love it. 
I don't know if this link will work, I'm listening on TuneIn radio:

Listen to The Drive with Russell Smith on @SportsRadioKnox with @TuneIn http://tun.in/seqWQ
When dude said Petrino's name on air I blurted out "Ewww". Fuck that shit. I've been using the nausea emoji for Kiffin 🤢 all week but fits Bobby too. 
At this point I feel like I'm losing my mind. If we can't get Brohm I say grab Fulmer for next season. It would at least be fun for some of us oldies. 
I'd stake all my miniscule amount of money that she's never smoked. I think she's a great actress, and you know from r/buffy that most of us think she's Crying Champion of the World, but for the love of Hecate, her 'smoking acting' pulls me out of the scene every time. She looked alright smoking a sandwich at the reunion though. 😁 
I don't have the bottom row either, I wonder why. I'm on stock 7.0.
Lily's smoking scenes were SO bad! Marshall and Robin looked natural, Barney and Ted looked kinda awkward, but Lily looked a little kid pretending to smoke with a chopstick or something. 😁 
I actually did buy Promise of Blood twice, once for myself then a gift copy to a friend almost immediately upon finishing it. 😏
Think of the sign potential if he actually coached at UT Martin. 
I pestered two friends into watching and told them both to start with White Bear. I think it perfectly encapsulates themes of the show: technology used in interesting ways, humans being horrible, things not being as they seem.
Which is the most unrealistic part in my opinion. I'm not special, so I guarantee there would be many people like me that would refuse to partake in the spectacle; others who have never seen a single minute of Jersey Shore or Honey Booboo or have never even been tempted to look up Two Girls One Cup. I understand it was necessary to get the point across, but again, completely unrealistic. I have more faith in a portion of humanity than that episode did. A number of us would have been purposely going about our business and one of us would have found her.

Or to purposely make them feel *uncomfortable* (e.g. Emo Phillips). 


This game has sucked for months. 
I have multiple boxes of my dad's slides from the 70's that I need to deal with too. Could you tell me how you are scanning them? 
Or to soften the blow of Kiffin? 🤢 
I liked season 6, hours of gratuitous nudity after they moved to UPN. 
My apologies, you are right; at 17 seconds there is a yellow arrow.
Are you talking about the bark sound effect lines? That kinda made me smile as it was unexpected, like they're illustrating a gif like a comic book.
Thanks, glad to know that can work as a last resort. 
Whoa, that's a ton of incense. I only have 3 so maybe that's a bad plan. I'm hoping I'll get to try going out again tomorrow morning. Good luck to you. 
Has anyone tested if they can be spawned via incense? I've been sick since Wednesday but I dragged myself out of bed, scraped ice off my car, and drove to 3 Pokestops and 2 gyms...no farfetchd.  Very disappointed with my bad timing and luck. 
None around me either, but piles of duskull, seriously some places they were stacked 3 deep on top of each other. 
So his dick has never reached in as far as the bottom of a tampon? 
That was great! And good on Crab Man for winning it all, he looks like a happy dude. 
I'm with you, I don't see it; I find them immediately and easily distinguishable. I'm not trying to be contrary either, I hate when people are contrary just for the sake of it. Maybe you and I are super recognizers and didn't even know it. 
Yep I'm on CBS right now. The difference between these two games is striking. 
Oh good so they didn't just send him packing. I was worried that he'd been released or something (I'm not really sure how NFL works).
My only emotion during this game is saying "Watch OUT" over and over at Guarantano.

I miss Dobbs. Is he still with the Steelers? I guess he's not actually playing since I haven't seen anything posted here since pre-season. 
Lane Kiffin 🤢 
What's going on in the Iron bowl? 
Yeah I agree with Mason, not a first down. 
They are so disingenuous. What's the difference between calling Hitler a socialist just because the word was in the Nazi party name and if liberals were to start calling Xi Jinping a republican because that's in the People's Republic of China name?

I just grabbed my xbox one controller off the coffee table so I could test for you. I grabbed it without looking so it'd be more muscle memory and as the controller slid comfortably into resting position in my palms, immediately my thumbs went to: Right thumb covering A and X and Left thumb on left thumbstick. 
Ah that's unfortunate, it's super tiny on my phone. 
I feel the same way, no way are we in any position to point any fingers right now. I'd rather both of us land good coaches than both of us land duds just to see Florida suffer. Don't give me that bad karma!

Belated thanks for answering. 
Is there a version of this gif that isn't thumbnail size or am I having technical difficulties? 
Simple and easy are way different. To run a marathon, start at the start and keep running to the finish line. It's simple but it's not even slightly easy (and near impossible for loads of us). I think this checklist isn't a list of easy, just a list of simple reminders that are all too easy to forget.

I'm not preaching from up on my high horse by the way, I have severe panic attacks, avoid confrontation and complicate everything, so I'm just describing how it felt for me to read the list. 
My vet said never to feed dogs turkey as it's somehow quite bad for their pancreas. That said, I know grapes are on the bad list (along with stuff like onions, garlic, chocolate that I knew to avoid), but my dog was 14 before I knew any better so I guess an occasional grape didn't hurt.

He looks so happy and healthy op! 
First sentence was a bit abrasive but mystery solved regardless, so thanks. 
Well I didn't blame the iPhone out loud, I'm not *that* kind of fangirl. I just internalized my suspicions. 😊 
>He was also in GPH.

Grand poo-dapest Hotel? 
Maybe it's because he/she used an apostrophe indicating a contraction "mom is" or possessive "mom's" and left everyone hanging. MOM'S WHAT??! 
Shit, I've been blaming Apple this whole time! 
I have a neighbor who can't send/receive pictures while talking on the phone either; is it an iPhone thing or carrier dependent? I have AT&T/android and have no issues multi-tasking but she has to hang up like your gf.  

Order MMS. 
Wow, you were so rude and unreasonable to the customer service rep. Your threats just sound silly tbh. 
Apparently, to non-whites, white people smell like milk and/or wet dog. I learned this on reddit so it *must* be true! 
Exactly what I'm most curious about. And they have cutouts in the spines for frequent access. 
The beach leads to Goldblum, I hope you picked the beach. 
Location and also age plays into it. I came out in the 90's. Now people take same sex dates to their high school prom, blows my mind! 
I doubt anyone was offended, but as I was reading I kinda shook my head thinking it sounded like the advice of someone who's never experienced first hand the fear and consequences of coming out. It can be terrify and heartbreaking. 

My mom told me that all gays should be shipped to an island or shot and that if anyone in their hometown ever found out that I'm a lesbian they'd have to move away. One of my best friends from high school didn't speak to me, after I told her, for over a decade. 

You eventually learn that while principles and being yourself is all great and noble in theory, in practice you'd sometimes just rather not give coworkers, family, neighbors, etc a reason to turn on you. So some of us still censor, because we can't trust people to just be fucking cool. Things have definitely gotten better, but some of us are still irreparably scarred by past experiences. 
I need to know whether they are hurt so I know whether I can laugh or not. 
JG never sees the sacks coming. 
I feel so caught up now. 
Perfect timing, WatchESPN just started buffering and lagging for no damn reason (as per usual). 
Forgot about the game! What have I missed, anything exciting/interesting? 
I'm a gay lady that posted in an r/Androidgaming thread within the last couple of hours. So gay of me. 
Downloaded Underhand to try later, I love card games and have been obsessively playing Onirim for months. Thanks for posting. 
Yeah my password game used to be pretty weak, honestly, but now almost all of my passwords are just a garbled bunch of nonsense. 
Set it to autofill on pc using the LastPass browser extension. I don't let it autofill stuff that has my payment method on file and I make it do master password check first, but it's still easier than visiting my vault. And on mobile I have the LastPass app set to fill credentials using my fingerprint instead of having to type the master password. The future is cool and scary.

I remember learning a lot about the Erie Canal but that may have been from visiting Erie Canal Village rather than studying NY history in school. I'm too damn old to remember now. 
I had a feeling that I was missing something obvious, thanks major! That makes way more sense than me imagining your marketing department making it as hard as possible to find big sales while evilly twirling their mustaches. 

So in summary, if we want to get in on sales early it will often require some hunting around on console. However, if we'd just hold our damn horses and be patient, the helpful marketing (obvious banners etc) will arrive shortly. 
You're welcome, I was grumpy this morning when I couldn't find it myself so I wanted to help (and complain a bit). 😁 
They make it really hard to find; it took me ten minutes to find the sale on the Xbox console this morning and I only knew to even *look* for it because of these posts on reddit. Frustrating marketing tactic to hide big sales so well. Anyway...

It's not on the Deals with Gold page so don't look there. From Home tab over to Store, but DON'T go into Browse Games like I did. Look under the top row of tiles on the main Store page for the very tiny words Deals, Search, etc. Select Deals then you should see a green banner for this sale. 

Sorry I went on a bit of a rant, but I have no idea how people that use the console only for sale announcements find them or know when to start looking. Am I missing something more obvious /u/majornelson?

**Update**: I found reference to the sale on Home. On my home page there are 4 small tiles at the top, Microsoft Edge, a Mad Max achievement, gamerscore leaderboard, and the 4th one is labeled "Featured", and says "Gold Early Access get incredible savings". When highlighted it shows the green Black Friday wallpaper. If I select it though it takes me to a black screen that says "Content isn't available" and lists error code (0x876c0001). So it looks like they attempted to get the sale on the homepage in one of the small tiles up top that you have to scroll over, but it's not working on my console. 
That sounds reasonable. I never think about Ohio being that close; Cincinnati's only about 4 hours from Knoxville, which is the same distance as Atlanta, but I used to go to Atlanta constantly and I only went to Cincinnati once. I just never really thought about what people from Ohio sound like. 
Google says Brady Hoke was born and grew up in Ohio so why does he have a Southern drawl?
I tried to resist, I really did, but I finally succumbed to the intoxicating lure of GRUMORS.

Ugh I bet that was amazing; I was super in love with John Taylor. 
Shit, you've just given away your location to every redditor with a thumbtack and a piece of string!
Agreed. Considering what's going on right now, this sub is remaining organized and informative instead of falling into chaos and disarray. 
Sonofabiscuit I thought that was real. I was on my way over to discuss Duran Duran, styling mousse and payphones. 
A lot of these "for the children" type appeals to morality rub me the wrong way because when you dig down, the person pushing the agenda very rarely cares as much about "the children" as they profess, and are instead merely using that as a tool to enact change for a less noble reasons. Like the "for the children" trans person bathroom bills, or the "for the children" censoring of music like NWA or 2 Live Crew in the early 90's or the "for the children" satanic panic of the 80's around things like Black Sabbath and Dungeons & Dragons.

Let me be clear, fuck loot boxes (and 2 Live Crew sucked), but fuck the appealing to moral panic shit too. 
This bestof is *from* r/blackmirror. 
I dislike watermelon at all times of day but yeah I certainly don't think of it as a wake-up flavor. I'd try the strawberry I guess but I'm skeptical. 
I get my Close-up at the dollar store. But Walmart or the like has this stuff. I'm on mobile so incoming ugly links...

Preparation H should come out with one for you. Or the company that makes Icy Hot. 
I didn't even know Crest did a cinnamon, I thought the red Close-up gel was my only option. In searching for the cinnamon Crest I just found Colgate comes in both strawberry and watermelon. I think I'll pass but good to know! 
I like mint at night, but mint makes me feel queasy in the mornings (no idea why). My solution, Close-up cinnamon toothpaste in the A.M. and Colgate in the P.M. I could just do cinnamon all the time but I like to mix it up a bit, r/madlads style.

Worst toothpaste I've ever tasted though was British and it tasted like root beer. I hate root beer.
For your shrine?
Please eliminate that 3rd down song Brady! I'd rather hear 3rd Down for What played on **every** defensive down for the entire game than hear the new pump-up jam once per set.
You missed assigning the "dry heaves" stage. I think that would be between anger and confusion.
Seriously, fuck that shit. 
My mom asked me this a few minutes ago, whether we could hire Saban away from Alabama. I said I don't think we'd want to, it would be almost like hiring Spurrier to coach the Vols. But I think with my heart rather than my brain a lot, so I don't know honestly how the rest of the fanbase would react to hiring a legendary enemy coach (even as a hypothetical). 
I feel like Alabama might be a better team than most of the rest of us. 🤔 
What is it with consoles going astray; the only package I've had misdelivered since I've been in this house was my xbox one. When I got that delivery notification but my porch was bare I was in such a panic, but FedEx had delivered it two houses down. I recorded myself creeping up into their porch and taking my xbox in case I needed to prove what I was doing over there!
Thank you, love the look. 
Nice pic. Can you tell me what sneakers those are please? 
Cirque du Soleil? 
There's probably always going to be *someone* thinking that, even if they keep it to themselves, but don't let that deter you from supporting your daughter. Both of my male softball coaches in high school and summer rec leagues were fantastic and honorable dudes who just wanted us to succeed and have fun. I totally get why that makes you sad though, sucks that there are monsters out there. 
Poor bastard. If it is an imperceptible to humans sound, I wonder if it's coming from the echo or from the smart device. I suppose you can try to turn the smart devices on and off with the app on your phone instead of using Alexa as a middleman and see if doggy reacts.

If it all ends up that you have to stop using smart home devices to save pups sanity, you might be able to make the transition easier by changing Alexa wake word to 'computer' or something the dog has yet to memorize and associate with bad high pitched sounds.

Good luck narrowing it down though, hopefully you'll find a solution. 
Is the freakout more pronounced when alexa talks to a smart home gadget vs her just answering a question or telling you the weather? I'm wondering if smart plugs etc emit a super high frequency when activated.
I'd love to see your before and after pics, I find all sorts of before/after pics super interesting, but not on r/pics. I love r/progresspics because I find it fascinating and inspiring, even though I've been underweight for the majority of years I've been subscribed there, yet when a weight loss comparison hits pics instead of progresspics, I'd love to have the power to manually move it to where it belongs.

And congratulations. I'm a year and a half free just of cigarettes and still complaining about it, so you've done really well! 
Really enjoying r/nocontextpics, thanks for linking. (I was already subbed to itap). 
FYI: This was solved 8 hours before you posted your guess. 
Seriously, Argentina and Venezuela both hate us in the 3rd link. That Russia reversal made me laugh though. Of COURSE Russia thinks way more highly of Trump than Obama. 
Yeah just like Black Mirror it's pretty damn dark. You have to think that if the little boy didn't get shot next, he has to live with having watched his mom be murdered in front of him while she gets to "live" happy. Gloomy as fuck! 
Maybe not the kid, we can't know that, but when he turned the gun on her he definitely shot her, and the last few frames were the beginning of her "perfect happy life" after death. 
Seconding the Golem and the Jinni. It had a thoughtful quietness to it but with purpose. 
You just need a couple of framed pictures on the big wall and a cheery house plant in there to keep you company. Nice room. 
I can't remember where he actually posted the fake question...r/askmen or r/asklegaladvice maybe? I just remember seeing the aftermath recently on one of the meta subs, srd or quityourbullshit, so I forget where the drama originated. 
You know what, I did gloss over that and I apologize. I think your "honestly I don't blame Trump" annoyed me and I didn't credit you for admitting he's a hypocrite at the end. 
I'm almost the opposite. I feel that beef and pork reheat well but both chicken and turkey I will eat cold with warm side dishes, as reheating changes the flavor in a way that is inedible to me. Actually now that I think about it for a second, reheated steak can be kinda awful. Still, reheated chicken and turkey are the true abominations. 
The question was posed as a lady asking how rapist get caught so she can better protect herself, when in reality the poster's history showed him to be a male incel likely looking for tips on how to not get caught for rape. 
Not the person who pushed the button but panic doesn't work that way; I have panic disorder, and unless there's a valid threat (live tiger with you in the mri tube) panic is illogical. I do wish I could reason myself out of panic by doing a quick cost benefit analysis though, panic attacks suck. 
The article did not mention whether or not he has a spouse. 
Yeah, looks like he hasn't completely figured out how back legs work in tandem with front legs yet. 
You missed the point. He's not being blamed for hiring non-Americans, he's being blamed for tweeting "BUY AMERICAN and HIRE AMERICAN!" then hiring 70 non-Americans. 
That was wonderful. Crazy dog!

Holy shit what a beautiful writer and a beautiful person she is. I've had an awful day and I'm crying my damn eyes out having read this. 
I don't miss killing rats in the deeprun tram to level new weapons. 
That's okay, I get it actually; I have an incredibly hard time listening to audiobooks because I forget I'm supposed to be paying attention and have to keep rewinding so I don't miss anything. Podcasts I'm not as much of a stickler if my thoughts drift for a moment, but with books, it's so much easier for me to read it myself than to listen. I've been trying to find ways in which I can do more audio though, and the 'busy hands' method is the best I've found to keep myself on track, so I thought I'd suggest it just in case it helped you too. 
I just clicked on that linked podcast, not meaning to listen all the way through - I just wanted to see what the gist of it was - and I ended up listening til the end. It gave me a perfect opportunity to get off the couch and go wash the dishes, clean out the fridge, and water my plants. I'm going to try to remind myself to listen to podcasts as I do chores from now on. Maybe busy hands would be a way for you to enjoy podcasts too.

By the way, that episode above was about a woman and her dad discovering after her mom passed away that her mom was definitely not who they thought she was. 
Your comment cemented my decision to NOT click that link. 
Yeah I love those sneakers and don't even have a guess as to what they are. Hoping someone comes through.
It gets a few minutes in season 6 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer too. Willow is perturbed by the misrepresentation of witches on Halloween with pointy hats and warts, but when she sees a little girl in a witch costume in the Magic Shop she melts and says she's adorable even though it's inaccurate. 
It sounded crazy for a second but then it started making sense. I think it's a nice idea. 
I just came here looking for that headline myself. Nothing. 
The disdain is palpable. 
Ignorance of the law is no excuse and they should know that, being cops. 

Do you think it would be preferable for police to carry consent forms and maybe all parties sign the forms witnessed by a notary and possibly a victims advocate or counselor to make sure no one is under duress before fucking people under arrest? 

Or do you think it's not too much to ask that police keep their genitals to themselves when making arrests?

This is insane troll logic. 
Sheesh, I feel like I've been blackout drunk since September 4th. And I don't even drink. Thanks. 
Who is this cimaglia person, what have I missed? 
It's different on different subs, but people almost always use the /s here so there can be no misunderstandings over intentions. Keep an eye out and you'll see it's very /s happy, likely because of the content and tight moderation to keep things supportive.
It's an older ethnic slur for Africans (not native Americans as the other person said) but the person calling you out was probably joking about you being slightly racist. It's such an old timey sounding insult, but possibly because of my age and location (Southern US) it was the first thing I thought of when I read the words spear chucker.
Mine started playing Slide by Calvin Harris. 
Maybe you should work your way up, like start with that tingly gold bond powder, next try mint mouthwash, *then* vaporub. 
I don't have rogue legacy (it looks hard), but FTL is perfect for one-handed operation since all it needs is touch pad and space bar. It's what made me start the category a couple of winters ago when it was so cold in my house I just wanted to play games under a blanket with one glove on! I looked to see what others I had in there but I can't see categories from the app on my phone; point and click games are probably the bulk of that category though. 
One of my Steam categories is "TouchPad", games like FTL or This War of Mine that I can comfortably play without a mouse when I'm having a crappy day on the couch with a laptop. 
Lebanon VA and Damascus VA are only about 30 miles apart. 
Pumpkin guts don't get eaten. You can separate the seeds from the slime and salt and bake the seeds in the oven, but I don't know of any recipes for the slime. These jack-o-lantern pumpkins aren't the ones that are used for food anyway, but even with smaller food pumpkins no one eats the slime. 
I'm on mobile too but I grabbed the comment link for you. (I'm using reddit is fun app). https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/77lmz1/what_newer_age_baby_names_can_you_absolutely_not/dooduas
You need another point in comma placement. 
I agree, that's a good time for a bathroom break. If the Tarantino scenes could be spliced out it would be a perfect movie.
Misery loves company. 
Do we really have to do this? I said I wasn't going to turn it on but here I sit. 
I have to be honest, I did not *want* to read it all. It's Saturday morning, I've finished the yard work, I just finished mopping the floors, but I still need to vacuum and get the chicken in the oven before I settle in for football...I've got shit to do! But I could NOT stop reading. You are a great writer and thank you for sharing. 
That's the one I have in my cart right now, thank you. I just need to decide on the color. Glad I saw your post this morning.    
Thank you for another option, I also found [a Walmart one] (https://www.walmart.com/ip/Better-Homes-and-Gardens-8-Cube-Organizer-Multiple-Colors/51233709) so I'll have to decide. Ikea wanted $349 to ship!
Old thread, I know, but I'm shopping for record storage today and wanted to ask if both of your cabinets in this pic are kallax? I'm hoping not because there's no Ikea anywhere near me. 
Could you link your shelving whenever you get a moment? I looked on the Walmart website and I think I found something similar that came in lots of different colors but I want to be sure it's the right one if you don't mind. And is it stackable? 
How bizarre. 
Wait which sub is it, are we not allowed to say out loud? 
That made me smile. ☺ 

>"I will refer you to both the Constitution, as well as to Michelle Obama, to explain why that will not happen," Obama said as he rallied in Newark for Phil Murphy, the Democratic nominee for governor of New Jersey.
Love the sub, subscribed. 
You stole my answer. 
The fact that cons continue to book him and fans continue to pay to meet him is very surprising to me. How many times must he be arrested and just how badly must he hurt someone before he's eventually shunned from making money off Buffy fans? 
I may still grab it later since it's a 5 day sale but it certainly looks intimidating. I tend to gravitate towards chill/simplistic mobile games; I play Onirim constantly while I barely touch Galaxy Trucker. 
I'd love to give this a try if I'm not too late. 
Thanks for the heads-up. I already have Pandemic from the Play Store, Splendor from the Amazon app store and Small World 2 from Humble Bundle.  
I just added Jaipur, Potion Explosion and Mysterium. I'm hesitant on Twilight Struggle, it looks really complex! 
Um, that's how I say arr-ange! GO BIG ARRINJ! Originally from upstate NY; I've lived primarily in TN for more than 2 decades now but I guess that stuck. 
That's good to hear. You'd think being a Tennessee fan I would hate the new imperialism maps but, well, I do *kinda* hate it, but at the same time I love it and I'm looking forward to a future season where we actually get some land. It's fantastic, so thanks for your effort.  
Do you sometimes dread game days because of all the work it means for you rather than just enjoying the games, or do you look forward to making the updates?  
You look beautiful OP. I did just zoom in though to see if you were sitting halfway on an onion pizza. You're gonna stain your dress! 
>It's ~~weeks~~ seasons like these where I have to seriously remind myself that college football is just a game and I can't let it ruin my entire ~~week~~ life. 

 
Yeah I couldn't figure out anything your lead singer was saying, but I'm not the best at deciphering lyrics...I get stumped by Pearl Jam. Thanks for answering. 
I have a couple of questions! When fans sing along to this type of music, do they sing like normal or do they scream along (not being cheeky, genuinely curious)? And related, can people who want to sing along to this type of music figure out the words that are being screamed without help, or do they have to check the internet or album liner notes for lyrics? 
Don't you try to sweet talk us, you monsters!! 
Ain't that the Tennessee-ist shit? I left the room and stood in the kitchen, shaking, heart racing, hoping beyond hope to hear Rocky Top play and put me out of my misery. 
Seriously, I wasn't even sure if I should turn it on but I'm glad I did. Even if we lose it's nice to see a little life in Neyland. 
That is fantastic! I would love to see the inside of a grocery store. 
This might just be the spark that Tennessee's offense needs.

According to this is was looked into very recently.
http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/white-house-announces-support-women-military-draft/

>Earlier this week, House and Senate negotiators agreed to strip a provision from the annual defense policy bill that would have required young women to register.

>The measure had roiled social conservatives, who decried it as another step toward the blurring of gender lines akin to allowing transgender people to use public lavatories and locker rooms. Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, spoke for a number of Republicans when he described the provision as "coercing America's daughters" into draft registration.

>But proponents of including women in the draft pool viewed the requirement as a sensible step toward gender equality. They pointed to the Pentagon's decision last year to open all front-line combat jobs to women as removing any justification for gender restrictions on registration. 
His debut album, maxinquaye, is one of the best albums ever made imo.
Thanks for the info, I'll check it when I'm not on my phone. 
How does it give you the game, as a download or a key to use somewhere? 
This gives me such a 90's boner. I still consider massive attack, mazzy star, Portishead and Tricky to be among my favorite bands of all time.  
Maybe you'd fit right in on r/pointlessstories? 
You took the words right out of my brain. Often I will write out a response - my thoughts, opinion, maybe put someone in their place that is being unkind - but 80% of the time I'll hit cancel before submitting. I often feel better having just written it out, but I'm not in a place in my life where I have the fortitude for arguments.  
Well glad you found it! 
Oh interesting, I forget the name now but I watched the movie of that on Netflix not too long ago. 
Clever! 👏🏻 
I ♥️ her. I just finished watching 1950's lesbian movie Carol last night with Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara; it's on Netflix US. 
I don't say we for any pro teams but I definitely say we for my alma mater, University of Tennessee. Example: "We are a huge disappointment this season", repeated every season.

But now that I think about it, I do say, "Oh cool, we won gold in hockey" (or whatever) when referring to the USA in the Olympics, even though I wasn't on the team. 
Oh I see; I know some libraries use alternatives to overdrive but I haven't any experience with them. I assumed they'd all be quick and sensible. 
I can get a library book right now, from opening my library's Overdrive app/website to downloaded and ready to read on my Kindle Paperwhite in about 3 minutes. It may not be one tap but it's way faster than driving to the library used to be.  
The most popular Kindle eReader, the Kindle Paperwhite, doesn't have audio; they removed it when they redesigned the Kindle Touch. So anyway, I check out audiobooks from my library directly from the Overdrive app on my android phone and ebooks I send to my kindle. Overdrive actually has a new app called Libby that's way smoother and snazzier than the old Overdrive app, which was slow and clunky (I believe it was just a web wrapper for the mobile site).

Is saying stir-up instead of stirrup pants another blunder or are you just punning on your ability to stir shit up with your super fly styles? 
I've got a decade on you and I'm both confused and angered by Snapchat; I have no patience for the ui or the content. 
Congratulations Brian! Love this sub for introducing me to your work back when there was only Promise of Blood, and getting to tell you how much I enjoyed it afterwards was the cherry on top.
This reminds me so much of the river slide part of [Tomb Raider 2013](https://youtu.be/TsP69Tilq58) (starts ~ 20s); I got speared in the chest a couple of times getting past that.  
Looks like a lady to me. She's awesome. 
How did you move desk/chair/computer/etc up that ladder? 
I'm probably just not classy enough! 
I haven't seen 'please respect tables bot' in years. I'll put this table back in his stead.

I just learned a new phrase. For anyone else unfamiliar, an "en suite bathroom" is what Americans call "master bathroom". 
The Chinese do seem to spend a lot of effort and money on unethical ways to make their penises work. 
I've had a feeling for months that Mad Max will be a free GwG, but for $5 I think I might risk buying anyway.
Valiant Hearts is one of the best games I've played on Xbox One and I still think about it whenever I'm reminded of WWI. It doesn't haunt me in the same way as This War of Mine, but it has definitely stayed with me. In my opinion, it was a perfect and unique way to tell a story inspired by real letters written during the war and I highly recommend this to anyone who has a speck of interest in history, WWI, puzzle/adventure games. Also, unlike TWoM, it can be really fun between sad bits. This game has a lot of heart.
I hate to cook, so I prefer to cook just twice/week and eat leftovers in between. It sounds like the 3qt will still be big enough to cook 2-3 meals though so that's what I need. I saw that the 6qt was on sale yesterday for $70, the same price as the mini, but even at the same price I'm still gravitating toward the mini due to counter space. Thanks for the update. 
But I don't like spam! 
How did it turn out? I'm thinking of getting the mini to cook just for myself and I'll be using it often for chicken. I don't think I have the need nor the counter space for the 6qt. 
I get it, I already said above I'm not trying to change your opinion, you're obviously super invested in it and have thought it through. I only wanted to add to the conversation that some of us just grow things because it's fun/gratifying, and that in itself makes it worth it no matter what a spreadsheet would tell us about our loss of time/money/resources. I grew tons of marigolds this year that required significant time investment in watering, pest control and weeding; I don't eat marigolds but it was so worth it because they are awesome! 
 
>But i wont grow something i wont eat. That is a waste of resources.  

I'm not the person you replied to, but just wanted to chime in and say sometimes it's just fun to grow things. I grew 3 beautiful tomato plants but I don't eat tomatoes (they hurt my stomach). I enjoyed watering them and watching them go from tiny seedlings to big strong plants, as tall as me; it was honestly super gratifying. 

Next year I'm going to try pumpkins, just for the fun of it. Not trying to change your opinion, but others of us might see the "waste of resources" totally worth the experience. 
   
I like to time my season one rewatches for when I'm not in the mood to heavily invest in what's going on; I wasn't feeling well yesterday so I watch the first 3 episodes of season 1. It's like a different show all together when compared to late seasons and I kind of like having the option to watch silly, cheap, campy Buffy or heavy, dramatic, meaningful Buffy whenever I so choose. 
Is he in a giant laundry basket? 
Call the Midwife deals with it, unsurprisingly, but I don't think they *show* it. 
31-10 Georgia  
(I'm not sure I've ever picked against the Vols on here, maybe this will help us)    
You've motivated me to look into other options before kickoff this Saturday. I'm sick of putting up with the totally shit espn app. Having to constantly wait 3-10 seconds to find out the results of every damn play when it unfreezes, I'd be better off listening to play by play on tune-in.    
I'm thinking of giving up on WatchESPN because of constant pausing, buffering, stuttering (except the commercials play perfectly). But I want to watch on my living room TV without hooking up a computer. On what device do *you* use cfbstreams? (I have xbox, a Roku, a gen1 chromecast, and an Amazon firestick with kodi.)  
It's the first episode of Buffy I ever watched. It made me want to watch more so I followed along to the series finale in season 7, then looped back around again starting with the pilot. 

It will be different for everyone, but if I had started with season 1 I wouldn't have made it to the season 1 finale, so I'm ever thankful that I started with a serious episode in a less campy season. I might have missed out on my favorite show in all of TV if I hadn't.    
Doot doot doo-doo-dooot! 🎶 
I'm including shows produced by 20th century Fox, not just aired on Fox. Fox pulled Better off Ted from Netflix in August. But yes, it was SO good and I was heartbroken when I watched it and it was too late, already canceled. 

Also I forgot about Bob's Burgers, that was a real blow when I found out they removed it.  
I feel like you and the commenter below you might be feigning ignorance. There were lots of entertaining Fox shows on Netflix. Ones I watched over the years:  

Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, American Dad, Futurama, Firefly, House MD, Better off Ted, Dollhouse, Raising Hope, My Name is Earl, Malcolm in the Middle, Bones, X-Files.      
Got it, didn't take into account the players grabbing at it on the ground. 
Makes sense now. 
Oh I see, if it had rolled out on its own they would have lost possession just like in college. Thanks for the explanation. 
Oh interesting; in college, fumbling through the back of the end zone is a turnover and touchback. I wonder why the rule is so different between ncaa/nfl there. 
There is no country named Nambia. He combined Namibia with Zambia.  
This is such a low effort comment, but that was fucking depressing. I have nothing insightful to say but I just need to comment my disappointment. Fuck. 
No it is not portrayed in the comics as beautiful; their relationship is manipulative, abusive and all-around psychotic. 
Of the 5 games she listed, one is my highest hours played on steam (Terraria) and another is my highest hours played on xbox 360 (New Vegas). Those games aren't small! 
Ha, works for me. 
No paywall for me:

>Former University of Tennessee football star Albert Haynesworth is opening up about his tumultuous relationship with former Lady Vols basketball player Brittany Jackson, alleging she repeatedly used racial slurs and physically abused him.

>In a series of Twitter posts on Wednesday, the former NFL star detailed what he called "The Ugly Truth About Brittany," with whom he has a son.

>The football player-turned failed Knoxville burger store owner wrote that Jackson called him the n-word "on numerous occasions" because "she wanted me to feel hurt bc I didn't show her affection."

>Haynesworth alleged Jackson became "extremely violent where more than 10 times in Tennessee and Florida I ... called the police to restrain her."

>One of those calls occurred on Jan. 10 in Southeast Knox County.

>Sheriff's deputies responded about 1:30 a.m. to a home on Kimberlin Heights Road, where Haynesworth said Jackson — who had been drinking wine — kicked the former 320-pound defensive tackle twice in the groin during an argument, according to a report from the Knox County Sheriff's Office.

>Haynesworth refused medical attention, and Jackson had left the home before deputies arrived, the report reads. Haynesworth didn't file charges in that case, KCSO spokeswoman Martha Dooley said.

>"Yes I have witnesses and bruises but me (sic) for some reason still tried to protect her by not sending her to jail bc I didn't want to ruin her so called career and name," Haynesworth wrote in one tweet.

>Haynesworth also alleged on Twitter that "MOST" of the money given to Jackson's Alzheimer's event "goes right in her pocket. That's why she wants the checks written to her foundation and not the Chattanooga Alzheimer's foundation."

>Jackson has organized several celebrity basketball games in Bradley County, where she grew up. The events aim to raise money to help find a cure for Alzheimer's, which plagued famed Lady Vols basketball coach Pat Summitt until she died in June 2016.

>TMZ reported Jackson has accused Haynesworth of skipping child support payments.

>Jackson and Haynesworth did not immediately return requests for comment Wednesday.

>The 6-foot-tall Jackson started on Summitt's team from 2001-04. The Lady Vols reached the Final Four of the NCAA tournament every year during that period, and played in the national championship game in 2003 and 2004.

>After playing for the Vols under coach Phillip Fulmer, Haynesworth was drafted in the first round of the 2002 NFL draft and played seven seasons with the Tennessee Titans.

>When the Titans hosted the Dallas Cowboys in 2006, Haynesworth kicked off the helmet of Andre Gurode, then stomped on his face, causing the Cowboys' offensive lineman to get 30 stitches under his right eye. Haynesworth was ejected and suspended for an unprecedented five games. He apologized to Gurode, and the two later became friends.

>The former Vol went on to play brief stints for the Washington Redskins, the New England Patriots and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before being released in 2012.

>In 2013, Haynesworth brought BurgerFi, a Florida-based burger chain, to Knoxville's Cumberland Avenue. His franchise is now closed.

>Both Jackson and Haynesworth have had run-ins with the law.

>In 2010, Jackson pleaded guilty to simple assault after she and her sister Lindsey got in a fight with another woman on the campus of Tennessee Wesleyan College in Athens. Jackson was charged with DUI weeks later when she reportedly crashed into another vehicle at a traffic stop and left the scene.

>Haynesworth in 2015 pleaded guilty in a Knox County court to a reckless boating charge. In 2011, he was charged with assault after he allegedly punched a man during a traffic altercation. That charge was dropped following a settlement. Later that year, he pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor assault charge after a waitress in Washington, D.C., accused him of groping her.

Shit! Why didn't I think of that.  
Hey at least you remembered *something* that happened in April. 
Mods, is there a flair for Vols gossip/drama? I can't access flairs anymore from mobile. I debated whether to post this at all, so if it's out of line I'll understand if it gets removed. 

I honestly don't know what to make of all this. Haynesworth has been very vocal lately in critiquing the Vols, to the point where his every tweet gets turned into UT sports news. Some people are loving it, surely some (like me) are tiring of it. Now we've got this. 

Reading through their rap sheets (Jackson: alleged [by Haynesworth] domestic abuse, alleged [by Haynesworth] charity theft, hit and run DUI, assault; Haynesworth: NFL suspension for stomping on an opponent's face, assault during a traffic incident, alleged [by a waitress] groping assault, alleged [by Jackson] failure to pay child support) shows a bounty of bad decisions between them. Seems sad all around, but he definitely needed to get out of there if she's hitting him. 

Edited to clarify some "alleged's" 
I like this. 😁 
What caused that jump in page views in April? It's probably something obvious but I can't think of a damn thing that stands out. 
It is *very* gory, but still watchable for me, someone who refuses to watch Hostel or the Saw sequels (after regretting watching the original). I watched it because I trusted Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon to tell a story that would make it worth leaving my comfort zone (I have big anxiety problems so I completely quit watching scary movies several years ago) and to me they absolutely succeeded. I've watched it three times now but haven't watched another horror movie since.  
I missed out on corners. White mom, wooden spoon or hair brushes. White dad, leather belt.  
Oh I am, trust me, just not as totally hopeless as I'd feel without having John Kelly to watch.
I'm American with a British mom and I love a boiled egg and soldier. I own 3 egg cups for this purpose. Soft boiled eggs with toast are lovely. 
Yeah I've actually noticed that before and gotten confused. Bad acronym. 😁    
I'm absolutely convinced, going to download it and give it a shot. LoL has such a bad reputation I assumed this was the same (mean-spirited) and purely a competitive (human) team game. I will never be skilled enough for team games, but I enjoy playing bots in Rocket League and Overwatch where I can't ruin shit for everyone by being bad. 
This sounds great, that's a ton of stuff to do!
Is fuckin terrible on Roku too, Definitely not xbox specific. So frustrating. 
You, [subject name here], must be the pride of [subject hometown here]! - GLaDOS
I don't generally like them either. I think being able to hit space bar and think about my next series of actions pushes it far enough toward the strategy/management side rather than the hectic rogue-lite side to make it fun for me.  
That's not equivalent at all! Find a racist firefighter saying they "wish all white people would die" so we can better compare the public responses. If you were to point out a black firefighter wishing death upon white people I would stand with you to condemn his public service employment too. I'm not sure why you're trying to compare someone in the life-saving business to the racist yapping of a bunch of randos on Twitter. If you can trace their real identities though you should definitely call them out too. 
No Juan, no Dobbs, no Kamara. I'd be feeling super dejected this season if not for John Kelly. He is so exciting to watch, but can be carry an entire program? I hope so! 
This is the first thing I've heard that might get me to download and try HotS. Are you saying I could have a satisfying experience and learn what the game is about without getting yelled at or being terrified of making a mistake? 
Other people are somehow seeing a link while you and I are only seeing text I guess. 
I just buy frozen ones. And to be honest, I don't even buy those anymore since discovering how much I prefer sweet potato pie over pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving. 
No the goo gets thrown away no matter which type of pumpkin you use. The flesh is what's used (the walls) to make pumpkin foods. 

Regarding pumpkin types, I decided to stop being lazy and look it up. I'm on my phone so just grabbed a top link. 
http://www.homefamily.net/2014/10/31/pumpkins-and-jack-o-lanterns-edible-or-not/

>Yes! You can eat the seeds and the flesh of big pumpkins as long as they haven’t been carved and sitting around. Those big pumpkins may not be as sweet as the smaller **“sugar pumpkins”** or **“pie pumpkins”**, but you can still use them for everything from roasted veggies to oatmeal, to soups, loaves and pies.

So it looks like you *can* cook with the carving pumpkin if you want, but you can grow specialized pie pumpkins instead.      
Aren't cooking pumpkins and carving pumpkins two different beasts? I do save the seeds from my carved pumpkin to salt and bake but I toss the slimy goo. 🎃  
I hear what you're saying, but that was actually a pretty great strip. I can't believe he ran him down. 
Every time the announcers bring up Josh Dobbs I get sad. 😟
I wish we could have that first-and-goal on the 1-yard line back and put me in as coach and I promise I'll call a run play. 
Every time Dormady throws I have a mini heart attack. 
Yeah these coaches obviously know something I don't, I understand that, but at the same time I would have run it on the first play. 
These commercials are FUN!! 
Yeah kinda, they still make you switch channels though, to like ESPNU​ or something (which I don't have access to).  
Holy shit, that's like something photoshopped as a joke for Facebook likes; I can't believe that's real. I used to smoke but I would have hated to have a camel light cake. Thanks for sharing!  
And the Great Smoky Mountains! 
That throw scared the shit out of me. 
That felt good. 
Yeah a quick score off the turnover would have been really demoralizing right there. 
😮
Man that's such an easy call for me, don't even have to think about it. I'll always pull for Georgia over Florida. 
I saw another team with a trash can this afternoon. Was it Texas A&M maybe, I was only half paying attention?  
I started out watching Pitt Oklahoma State but wow was that boring. Switched over to Memphis UCLA about 15 minutes ago and that was a great decision.
I'm going all in on Tennessee teams today for Pick'em; I chose UT, Memphis and Vandy to win their games. I could easily lose all three, but I'm watching the Memphis game right now and Memphis is up 20-17.
UT 35-13

>Mom:  "I remember when I had nice things.  Of course, that's all gone now...."

I just played the Debbie Downer sad trombone riff in my head after reading that line. 
Is that an uppercase i or a lowercase L? 
It's named in the picture OP posted. Not sure if i should repeat it but you can look at the submission to see it.
I think I might get that too! I spent so many quarters on Dig Dug at the arcade when I was a kid. Definitely more than the asking price on xbox. 
George W Bush? 
Overreaching FDA, always trying to protect me from accidentally killing myself.  
Nazis isn't possessive, no apostrophe required. But I agree that the kindness negates the misspelling in the OP. 
One point win? C'mon Georgia, that's our thing. 
Oh shit, I'm a little hesitant to accept the trashcan tbh, but maybe I can learn to embrace it with my own team 121 koozie. 
Rooting for you guys today too, go dog bros. 
I missed the start of the game because of the watchESPN app buffering, stuttering, then straight up error message. Streaming can be such a nightmare. 
https://www.buzzfeed.com/lyapalater/a-brief-guide-to-the-skarsgard-family

We're obviously not the first to need a Skarsgård family tree to reference. Loved Alexander on True Blood.  

Edit: okay, it's kinda gross how this ranks them on hotness; I think we could have all done without that part. 
UT 45 - 13
I started with a 1tb Touro that was great for a couple of years but filled up, then last month I swapped to a 2tb WD Easystore. So far so good. I can't give price advice because I'm the US, but the new WD from best buy was $65 and included the hdd and a $25 gift card.  
I was actually just coming back here to add an edit onto my comment because I realized I hadn't been very empathetic. It doesn't make the temp ban any less sucky and I'm sorry that you had to deal with a shitty ufc stream then a suspension on top of that. The chargeback/permanent ban thing is very well known by Steam users and I'm sorry you had to learn the hard way on xbox. I would be DEVASTATED if I lost access to my xbox account, truly. I'm glad they gave you a temp ban instead of permanent though.    
Oh shit, yeah you can't do a *chargeback*. You have got to give Microsoft a chance take a look at and resolve the issue. If you do a chargeback on Steam rather than going through steam customer service, that's it, your account is permanently closed according to to their terms of service. Sounds like ms is the same. I'm not sure why you jumped to chargeback the first day, maybe you were just too upset to think straight. 
Agreed. At 10 p.m. I texted a friend 'this game is so awful and depressing I want to cry and eat cake'. At 11:40 p.m. I texted him back about how now I'm just trying my best not to have a heart attack. I can't say that my night ended "happy", but I was relieved. It took me an hour and a half to calm down enough to go to sleep.     
Can y'all believe that shit? 
I feel sick to my stomach from September to January. Why do I even love football? 
Wtf kinda question is that?! 
So fucking relatable. That top panel was me all day yesterday, basking in the joy of watching college football again without the anxiety of a Tennessee game. I'm worrying today though. 
Yeah I'm leaning that way. I was determined that this year would be the year that I succeed in getting into NFL football at least a little. I was trying to decide between the Dolphins (growing up my godfather supported the Dolphins and I just thought dolphins, and Dan Marino, were super cute), the Titans (because Nashville, and I like their name and colors), and the Bills (they were pretty much the hometown team where I grew up in NY, and I like buffalos). But then Dobbs had to go to Pittsburgh that wasn't on even in my list, and I don't care for the colors or the logo.

Put some newspaper down for him in case he poops. 
That series of events was quite displeasing. 
I don't know if it's good for gardens but it's miserable for gardeners. The frustration of sticking your hand in yet another pile of stinking cat shit when you don't even own a cat can be super disheartening.  
Who did he leave his sword and pistol to? 
Check out my favorite Hank Azaria movie, Mystery Men, sometime if you're up for it. He is fantastic as [Blue Raja.](http://www.writeups.org/wp-content/uploads/Blue-Raja-Mystery-Men-Hank-Azaria.jpg) He was also great in showtime's Huff, but it sadly got canceled after 2 seasons. I'd guess most people who don't know his face from Mystery Men probably remember him as Agador Spartacus from The Birdcage with Robin Williams.
UT 24 - 20
I was taught to always sit with my knees together, constantly corrected by adults (mostly mom) when I wasn't sitting 'very ladylike', and I was lectured by my father about it at around 12 or 13 years old that boys would always be trying to look. It's quite an anxious subject for me because of the constant pressure to mold me into a lady who sits appropriately, so I don't honestly feel a ton of sympathy for a guy that had to occasionally put his legs a little closer together for a bus ride. I don't think he should be in pain, but discomfort is just part of social etiquette training (or it was mine). I don't sit knees together because of the way my hips function, it's because of years of conditioning. 
This is an incredible write-up; I read every word and wanted to thank you for taking the time to lay this out so well. 
You were wrong. 
Jaegon is a fine and noble name. 
Definitely maybe. 
Yeah maybe it'll eventually sort itself out, but at least I can access it from mobile now. 
It seems to be my Chrome. I waited an hour, cleared Chrome history, cleared the Chrome app cache, cleared the reddit is fun cache, and this time I got a new green page asking me if I wanted to do temporary or for it to remember; I chose remember, and again login takes me to a blank white page with an address that starts like this: https://auth.redditcfb.com/?rememberme&state=blah blah blah. 

Oh well! I was able to sign back up by downloading a new browser, Firefox. So I'll just keep Firefox for cfb. Thanks again for trying to help.    
Okay, I'll set a reminder for an hour from now to try again. So sorry for the trouble. 
I was hoping after the original 1 hour was up, it would ask me again whether to remember it permanently or for one hour, but it won't even ask me now; after inputting my reddit info and hitting the login button it takes me straight to:

Okay it's 3 days later because I forgot to update you, but I just tried again on Chrome from my phone and it's doing the same - asks for reddit login, says something about 1 hour allow or decline, hit allow, takes me to a blank white page that starts with the address https://auth.redditcfb.com/?...

I don't want to put the entire address string in case all those numbers are personal details of some sort. 

Anyway it did let me register from desktop a couple of days ago, so there's a workaround, but I doubt I'll continue pick'ems if I can't access it via mobile; not out of protest, but because I'm forgetful.  I'll keep my eye out for any new ideas to help mobile users. 
She could be I suppose but I'm just so used to her operating via calculated deceit; I just don't believe her. 
That was pretty huge. She seemed like a loyal robot, unable/unwilling to violate her prime directive, up until that moment. 
Yeah I don't think Cersei is pregnant at all either, but it seems most everyone else here has accepted it as truth. It seems so obvious that the fake pregnancy was her tool to manipulate Jaime and used again to manipulate Tyrion. She didn't put her hand dramatically on her belly for nothing, and I'm shocked Tyrion didn't see right through that. What's happened to him?! 

Then again I'm usually not on the cutting-edge of figuring out things about the show/books that others haven't yet realized, so the more likely answer is I'm just wrong. I mean it's not like it's a stretch, maybe that's the problem, it's *too* obvious for everyone else. 
We may still get more of him next season if Arya wears his face. I wanted Petyr gone, but I feel like his takedown was not a grand enough scheme for what he had earned; I'm hoping if there's ever a book version it will be a much bigger deal.   
I'm astounded that you actually believe that shit. 
I think I'm going to buy The Once and Future King for $4. I've always wanted to read it, but that narrator's voice sounds so nice I might just let him read it to me instead.  

Sale ends 08/27/2017 at midnight PST.
The NERVE! 
Dog Park? Yeah I went back to that one 3 times looking to see if she sells prints. 
Oh me too. I can't imagine what it would have been like to talk about the episodes that end on a cliffhanger for a week with other fans when it was airing live. Or the season finales when you'd have all summer to wonder how the next season will unfold. I'm super jealous that I never got to experience that!
About a month ago I had to Google Lakshmi Singh just so I could finally put a face to the name that I couldn't stop repeating to myself for no reason. This is weird. 
I saw a response to somebody else regarding the one-hour authorization causing issues and I had used the one hour myself, so I'm going to wait out the hour to let that token expire and retry because it's no longer giving me the authorization length choice.    
I'm unable to use it. I'm trying via Chrome on a moto g5 plus with Android 7.0. First I got a green page that directed me to a log in page with my reddit account, did that, hit allow, then I got redirected back to this: https://imgur.com/wxr67KN

I can't read what's in the margins or scroll up or down on that page, so I hit the cfb pickem link, which took me to the page to authenticate my account again. I put in my reddit info a 2nd time and hit allow, which now redirects me repeatedly to a completely blank page. 

I figured that maybe this doesn't work on mobile but I see above people complimenting the mobile functionality and they don't sound sarcastic. Possibly a hiccup this morning?         

Update: Now getting "an error occurred (status: 503)" when trying to login to authenticate, which is a reddit server error I think, so I'll try again in a bit. 
It's mostly bluegill, walleye, crappie, but I can't really touch any kind. Fish just freak me out for some reason.  
We are a small and fearful bunch. In all honesty I do feel vulnerable a lot like I never did when I had a good sized dog, but I have panic attacks when under pressure so no gun for me; any attacker or intruder would just take it right away from me.  
Your definition of squeamish might be a bit off. When I think of squeamish I think of fishing with my dad and how if I catch one I can't take it off the hook because I'm so squeamish. It just makes me shudder almost with revulsion like I'm going to cry, scream or just involuntarily throw the fish across the boat. Super squeamish about slimy scaly fish. 
>I'm sure they would. AFAIK I am not under police investigation nor am I wanted for questioning. I'll happily turn myself in if that's the case.
I'm really protective of my battlenet realID for this reason. I often need that 'me time'. 
I'm playing Mass Effect 3 on xbox right now. I think I'm about half way through and I heart Liara. Btw I'm impressed with all the responses you got on this post, so cool; I wonder if there's a lesbian gamers sub? Anyway, I play Xbox one and pc. Mostly chill stuff like Mass effect, Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Cities Skylines, Sims, etc. 
I'm reading fellside by Mike Carey. He also wrote the Girl with all the Gifts which was a very easy and enjoyable read. I'm struggling a bit to get into Fellside so far; I'm especially having trouble keeping up with the names of characters in the prison. I think I need to put in some extra effort and hopefully get over this hump. I've been losing interest in things I'm supposed to like, like reading, and I don't want this to become a habit. 
This is [an interesting article if you are interested in the rise of Gamergate and Breitbart.](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/01/gamergate-alt-right-hate-trump) Not sure if you were asking honestly or if you're gonna yell FAKE NEWS at me, but I'm going to assume good intentions.

>There are few things more ironic than the GOP using fictional characters to promote their supposed support by diverse groups of non-white individuals, and few things more telling.
I'm about 5 hours in, so yeah I think it's only a 10 hour game. I'm doing Mass Effect 3 right now then I'll go back to Ori because I definitely want to see it through. 
I'm about 90% sure I have an extra super meat boy key if you think you'd enjoy it or want the challenge. 
I think Ori is actually a good example of a nearly ideal balancing act. I found myself thinking it was occasionally too easy and too difficult, but as it got more consistently difficult I did get stuck and frustrated more often. However, I had it on normal so my hope is that I can bump it down to easy and finish the game. I still find it difficult to give myself permission to set games on easy even though I have nothing to prove. 
I haven't finished ori but it is barely leaning toward too difficult at times but not unmanageable. I think I might still switch it to easy to finish though. I need to start thinking of it like: I'd rather finish it on easy than leave it sitting unfinished on normal.   
I just bought the new Buffy game two months ago and now another one? Well I guess I have to get it. 

Looks like October 4th or October 10th is the closest I could find to a confirmed release date on https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/210290/legendary-buffy-vampire-slayer.    
Got it, thanks. I'd never paid attention to that drop down that was defaulted to "beginning of time". 
Is delete last hour a chrome option? I've never seen it. 
I haven't totally given up on buying it, especially if there's a manageable difficulty level for people like me, but I'm not going to pre-purchase like I'd planned; I'll reevaluate after it comes out. 
Deal. 🤝🏼 
Well that's fucking bleak isn't it? Sometimes I wish I didn't love Tennessee so much so I could enjoy college football season without the stress. And yeah, Jones would be way gone.  
Mildly successful has a nice ring to it.

I checked Target and they do have the physical copy for $25 but I think I'll go with digital this time. Games like fallout or elder scrolls that I know I'll never resell I'm going to start buying digital. Thanks for pointing that out anyway though.

That's great to hear, I'm so taken with the art style. I have a vastly lower tolerance for repeating frustrating levels and fights than I did back 20 years ago. The drive to overcome an impossible challenge through practice and improvement no longer factors into my enjoyment whatsoever; I just want to chill and have fun now, maybe explore a cool world, solve an interesting puzzle or take part in a good story.      
It's never been lower than $30 yet, according to storeparser, but you may be right that it'll go cheaper on black Friday. I guess I have 6 days to decide. 
I was really looking forward to it but I think I may hold off. I'm older and slower, my hands and my reaction times are older and slower. I'm afraid it'll be another thoroughly discouraging experience like I had with Super Meat Boy. I'll watch some of you guys play it on twitch first then reevaluate. 
It always seems to be Dishonored *2* that's on sale. Either they never mark down the older Dishonored definitive edition or I always miss it. (I have the 360 version so I don't want to pay full price again). 

That said, I think I may rebuy Skyrim for $30 since, like Dishonored, it got a new version instead of going BC.

That sounds about right. I used the free version for two years before I finally bought the golden platinum version; I don't know what the fuck I was waiting for. 
Wow, I started watching Buffy late so I missed the days of The Bronze message board, but I joined whedonesque as soon as I found it, around 2005. 
Puppies*, no apostrophe for plural form. 
From soft to solid, great work. 
I'll feel silly if I'm wrong but I *think* it's Gaga.

I remember a Chinese restaurant that used to be in there, either late 80's or early 90's, and I ate there with my mom. I also remember the Third Rail, lots of red/maroon, lots of metal, and palm trees (which I always found bizarre). 
I read that the same way when I first read through the article and had to go back and reread to clarify who said what. 
A few quotes from the article:

>A Brooklyn-based preacher became the first member of the Christian council to resign his post Friday. “There was a deepening conflict of values between myself and the administration,” A.R. Bernard said in a statement, adding that he had “quietly stepped away” from involvement with the group several months ago and submitted his formal resignation on Tuesday.

>“No one spoke about disbanding. We’re called by God, not by political ambition,” said Pastor Mark Burns, an evangelical preacher from South Carolina, who sits on the board.  
>>Nonetheless, he said that the majority of members had resolved to stay the course. “I believe God placed the president there, and I also know that he is still walking into his assignment,” Burns added.


>Trump’s evangelical advisory board — whose members include former Congresswoman Michelle Bachmann — have bi-monthly teleconference calls, often with a White House representative on the line. Burns said that Trump’s son-in-law and advisor Jared Kushner had been on more than one of the calls.
I too can confirm that Pokémon Go plays fantastically on the g5 plus. I ultimately went with the 4gb version to ensure it had plenty of ram to work with, and it's snappy and smooth with little to no lag and none of the GPS problems I was having on my LG. 
Yeah I had to double check myself because I didn't want my biases influencing what I "heard", but there was no denying they said both things upon rewatch. 
Listen at 15 seconds in, they're chanting "You will not replace us". Then listen at 24 seconds in, now chanting "Jews will not replace us".

If you hang around sports subs enough you'll get many chances to use the term and [related gifs](https://media.giphy.com/media/26FPy3QZQqGtDcrja/giphy.gif) on gameday, especially college football.  
I was thinking along the same lines but substitute an old white lady like Tweety Bird's owner, granny. It's [Granny](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d9/Granny.png) with a riot shield shaped like a strawberry. 
I completely agree, I really hope they don't try to remove him from the university. He did not break the law. Let him stay, let his classmates decide how they will navigate his presence on campus. He will likely make some brand-new like-minded friends, but hopefully many more foes.
Yeah I groaned; I too thought it was really bad, absolutely unneeded and stuck out like a sore thumb.  
According to the link you're commenting on that's not what happened. Hanna and Tobi just laughed about it in the grocery store together.

>“I started drawing on the wall in Sharpie markers, I wrote ‘Kurt smells like Teen Spirit’, because it was in my head from earlier in the grocery store.”

>Hanna was keen to dispel a few rumours about the title that have cropped up over the years.

>“People started saying it was in reference to Tobi, that Tobi wore Teen Spirit – but that was totally not true,” she said. “She was just a part of it because we’d been in the store earlier that day.   
Don't forget to open the app occasionally if you stop getting surveys. I find keeping location turned on to be the best way to consistently keep surveys coming (they love asking me about Walgreens), but just opening the app can occasionally trigger surveys to start popping up again if the app has been unusually quiet for a while.
And /u/b49 is great at explaining stuff. 👍🏻 
Oh I forgot to report back, I set it up for just Slack for now to test and it was super easy. Way less intimidating than I thought it would be. 
I read your message and went straight to the living room to check, and yes I just reversed my Mass Effect 3 cover. Thanks for telling me! 
She's very attractive and has a unique style but I don't think she's learned how acting works yet. Her scenes in oitnb are all quite jarring in that they pull me out of the fantasy and remind me that I'm watching a TV show. That was kinda mean for me to voice out loud though, I usually try not to be mean. 
Yeah someone else mentioned her so I googled her. I recognize that name but couldn't pick her out of a line-up. 
I just learned who Cara is a week or two ago because of a reddit thread with everyone bonding over how much they hate her and her acting. Reddit being reddit. Kate Upton, I've heard the name but couldn't pick her out of a line-up. 
"Acting". But yes, I didn't know who she was before oitnb so she didn't really count. 
Yeah he's on the covers of the first three at least (I don't have Andromeda yet, I'm actually playing through ME3 right now). But femshep is awesome and voice actor Jennifer Hale is awesome. I feel so powerful strutting around The Normandy as Commander Shepherd.  
I just looked him up, he is *very* pretty with his head shaved. As an aside, I always play femshep and I forget that she's not the default main character. 
Dammit! We need more Cindy Crawford.
In good will hunting Robin's beard was close cropped. While that beard doesn't look as *wild* as I'd expect for Jumanji, it seems too full for gwh. And there's that wild smile. What do you think? http://assets.huluim.com/blog/GWH.jpg     
Hey you're right; I can think of Cindy Crawford, Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford, Giselle, Heidi Klum. I have zero interest in fashion but I still know those models, but there's not a new name in the bunch. Oh wait, I know one new model name: Ruby Rose (because of Orange is the New Black). 
Oh that's really cool; is it Doubtfire, Flubber, Aladdin, Jumanji? I've never seen Flubber so I'd forgotten about that. 
Okay I'll try it. :) 
Yes. I built my first gaming pc 2 years ago and I also have second-hand xbox one and ps4. I'm very grateful to be in a situation where I can have all three. This week I've been playing Mass Effect 3 on xbox one and this rpg/board game called Armello on pc. 
In my world it's Clarence's internal monologue, but I can't claim to know the author's intention. 
So how did this work out for you? I wish I could turn off the pop up preview for Slack that covers shit up at the top of my phone but still have the tiny notification icon up top. Is that what this did for you? 
Ah, well maybe someone will post some highlights for the rest of us. I really hope he has a good first outing. 
So this is a pre-season game, so it's like practice? Will it be on TV? 
I love the [patriotic horse photo.] (https://upload-assets.vice.com/files/2015/07/31/143836305805A___Thanks_The_Follow.jpg) 

I feel compelled to save it and use it myself. 
I might be! That Touro was a trooper. 
Just got it. I paused my game to go take a look at Store > Apps and now instead of a big thumbnail side by side with HBO, there's a huge Spotify banner at the top and I was able to click that and download it just now.  
I just paused my game to go take a look at Store > Apps and now (for me) instead of a big thumbnail side by side with HBO, there's a huge Spotify banner at the top, the full width of the screen. I was just able to click "Get" and download it now.    
Two weeks ago for me; I transferred 1.5TB from my trusty but full Touro hdd to a new, bigger WD. Took me two days to get all my games moved over and I couldn't fucking believe there wasn't a mass transfer option. 

I'm glad it's going to be a thing now even though I didn't get to partake.  
I'll definitely be checking back. This is really exciting tbh. 
Just checked Store > Apps on my xbox and it's got a giant thumbnail right up top next to HBO Go (for me at least). 

Can't download it yet though.

I love it when people who love Buffy write new shows for people who love Buffy. 

I have been sick quite a bit lately, and when feeling sick, anxious and depressed I look for a TV show to help me get through. Buffy was the show that got me through one of the very worst points in my life, but my latest discovery was Wynonna Earp. I really enjoyed it and look forward to more character development and Netflix getting season 2. I really hope it can avoid the bury your gays trope.

Outside the US I've only been in Heathrow, Gatwick and Toronto airports as an adult (never paid attention as a kid) but I've also never been to a third world country to compare. 
Hi bot, I'm here with a small grammar tip for your text above. The plural of instinct, *instincts*, shouldn't have an apostrophe; that's usually reserved for possessives and contractions.  
SPOILERS!! 😉 
For anyone else out of the loop, I looked these two ladies up and they are actresses who are both in Arrow. 
Did a little research; I've not visited any of the airports he was specifically targeting with that, but I guess he's just being ultra hyperbolic as usual. Sounds like Laguardia isn't great but not third world. 

>"our airports are like from a Third World country,” specifically calling out New York’s LaGuardia, JFK, Los Angeles and Newark.
 
Do we really have airports that are third world airports? I've not been in tons but I've been in ATL, Charlotte, Nashville, SFO, Cleveland, Seattle, Phoenix, Denver, Houston airports. All of those were okay, Cleveland was a bit depressing.    
Thanks, and I'm going to look for a new plant (or a leaf) to try again. 
I found my old post. There's one pic linked up top and an additional pic in the comments with a description of my poor jade that maybe got sunburned? The other jade I definitely watered to death though so I need to stop that. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/IndoorGarden/comments/4bs8pn/can_you_tell_me_anything_about_my_jade_plant_from/       
Thanks! 
What did you put over the top of that plastic on the paths? I can't figure out squinting at my phone what you have around those flat stones. 
The aloe and the first jade I definitely think I over watered. The second (actually i think it may be the 3rd) jade I recently killed by setting it outside for 4 hours to get some sun and fresh air. It was doing so well until that day, then it promptly fell apart and died over the next week. Over on r/indoorgarden they told me I killed it with sunburn. Oops, I didn't know that was a thing. I thought my houseplants would like to go for a walk on a nice spring afternoon. Thanks for the advice, I'm motivated to try again. 
Maybe next time I'll buy two and water them differently and observe their reactions, figure out for sure what I'm doing wrong. I feel bad that they have to suffer but I'm not ready to give up. 
And he's very pretty. ☺ 
It's beautiful! Jade and aloe are two of my favorite indoor plants. I have tried twice to grow them and twice have killed both within 6 months. People say they are very easy to grow but I can't seem to get it right. 
The original Lil Jon video is no less confusing, but it's fascinating. NSFW.

No mobile ones in that post. I haven't seen a schedule one for mobile yet; I wish I remembered who made the one I used for my android lockscreen all last season, but it definitely came from here or r/cfb.  
If you go to this pre-season guide post from today and Ctrl-F "southeastern" in the info up top, that link contains 3 new UT schedule desktop wallpapers he made. I'm on mobile so sorry for not getting the links within the link for you.

Yeah I'm going to be paranoid now, trying to fight as fast as possible in case a raid pops up. 
Muks on a rampage today. 
Yes, just started this week. I've gotten 3 so far. 
I've yet to try a legendary. Did you get it? 
Nope southeastern US. 
Hmm, I've never fought a poliwrath in a gym before, and the gym was red before Muk showed up. 
Yeah that would be like a big middle finger! To add insult to injury, I tried to fight Muk and ran out of time; I just left and went home with my tail between my legs. 

I need to take a good look at my roster and see if I can get some Pokémon ready for 2-difficulty raids. I've only just started messing with gyms occasionally since the revamp, and raids I've only done 3 or 4. I need more stardust!  
Needless to say I was disappointed and frustrated that I missed putting a Pokémon in by a minute. I wish there was a way for the person who took down the gym to still get a chance to put in a defender if a raid pops up. I don't know that there's a way to avoid it happening without egg timers. 
Free still for me, USA, 8am east coast. 
Very true, but Bayonetta just looked cool/interesting. I played it for an hour so I got the gist and then traded it in. 
It's on my steam wishlist, one day I'll get to it! 
I still feel guilty about setting the game to easy difficulty, even though that makes no damn sense; the more I value story over skill you'd think that would be the easy answer. I'm currently struggling a little with Ori and the Blind Forest so maybe I'll bump it down to easy and see how that feels. 
The older I get, the less patience and skill I have when it comes to video games. I can no longer play fast button mashy games or fighting games, and learned this lesson after buying **Bayonetta** and **Tekken Tag 2**. I'm too slow and no longer have the fortitude to beat a fast, tough, repetitive game like **Super Meat Boy**. And I'm much more interested now in the story than testing my skill, so when I die repeatedly to a Big Daddy in **Bioshock 1**, I just feel sorry that I no longer have that drive to beat my head against the wall until I succeed, and thus I don't get to experience the story of Bioshock. So yeah that's kind of a bummer.

Luckily I love several genres that don't punish a more laid-back thoughtful approach or slower response time: rpg's, simulation, strategy, puzzle, tycoon, third person action/adventure. 

My days of playing Soul Calibur and Tekken may be over, but I can still play stuff like Xcom, Cities Skylines, Assassin's Creed, FTL, Terraria, Skyrim (and a ton more) til the cows come home!        
I'd like one Ryzen please.
I got it during a Play Store half off sale, otherwise I'm not sure if I would have been as tempted to own it twice at regular price. My thoughts so far are that although it controls well on touch-screen, I feel it's too small on my phone. I just went down to a 5.2" phone bc my 5.5" that died was always a little too big for my delicate lady hands. 😉 I'll probably try it on my Fire tablet; if the Fire's wimpy processor and weak ram can run it, I think it'll be way better on a tablet (or a bigger phone).  
I tried out several habit tracker apps in June and decided on habitbull as the one I'd stick with (it's not beautiful but it's easy to add habits, easy to edit, and easy to track). I'm currently tracking push-ups, meditation and practicing ukulele, in fact I have the little bull head silhouette in my notification bar right now because I haven't done *any* of that yet today. Going to do push-ups right after I hit send.

I suppose I'm a glutton for punishment, as I recently bought TWoM on android even though I already own and have played it several times on steam. Now I can feel shitty and hopeless on the go.

I'm thinking of trying either one of these next but idk yet. I wish I could feel them! That spigen may even be too thick.

I actually don't like my case that I got, sadly. I bought the poetic affinity g5+ case because it was my favorite case for my LG G Flex 2, but the LG version had a pleasant subtly textured matte finish that both felt great and looked clean, and a fantastic smokey grey color that I loved. The affinity case for g5+ though is clear, which I find ugly, and worst of all the plastic of the back of the case is too smooth, glossy, untextured, making it a magnet for every spec of oil/dirt coming off my hands. I'm constantly having to wash the back of the case. I'm going to order one from another brand and hope I have better luck. 
My magnetic car mount (I got mine from Newegg for $4) came with a metal plate and a sticky metal disc. I didn't bother peeling the backing off the disc or even putting it inside the phone back; instead I just trapped it in between the back of my phone (previously LG G Flex 2 and now Moto g5+) and the slim phone case. The magnet had zero issue gripping my phone tightly even with a hard case in between it and the disc.  
Thank you for explaining! That sounds fun; I'm going to look for a video later. 
Can you tell those of us who don't know what the stream that you watched for 3 hours was about? 
It is pretty interesting how the numbers panned out. When I started day one I immediately discounted Valor because red is such an aggressive color; I then considered bold yellow or soothing blue and ultimately chose blue because the name mystic sounded magical. I wonder how many day one players would choose differently now knowing the actual team membership numbers.    
Not much, you? 
This is bizarre and fascinating.

My dentist told me to avoid sugar gum and my gastroenterologist told me to avoid sorbitol. It's difficult to find gum without sorbitol. 
Your review easily just sold me. I love light games like Splendor, Tsuro, Guillotine and Batman Love Letter; especially games that are easy to teach when friends visit.

That seems so simple yet I never thought of it. I'm not sure how to use those points to pay the card balance but it'll definitely check it out next month. I think I have around $80 in points credit right now.

My hero! I have Google assistant set up now, thank you so much. It took me a minute but I got it sorted out using the Assist and voice input > Assist app like you recommended.  
I too got the Amazon version. After playing with the normal g5 plus I could activate Google assistant by long pressing the home button, but the Amazon version pulls up some kind of quick menu to set reminders, appointments, find restaurants, etc but no Google assistant. Disappointing, I kinda liked assistant. I cleared the cache and power cycled too but nothing.      
No, the spawns are on timers. They will despawn at a set time regardless of whether no one or 50 people have caught them.    
Same. It was like a big Buffy self-quiz as I thought back to each original scene and who said each line. I would have gotten a 100% except I don't remember "shpadoinkle". It sounds like something Xander would say but I can't place it at all. 
I remember that being the first time I actually considered that my cord cutting smugness could one day come to an end at the whim of isp's. That and when isps started rolling out data caps.  
And this one: https://consumerist.com/2014/02/23/netflix-agrees-to-pay-comcast-to-end-slowdown/ 

I don't know if it's the same because Comcast didn't seem to be actively blocking Netflix data, they just weren't doing anything to facilitate the large demand for data between Netflix and consumers until Netflix paid extra.   
For whatever reason, staffordshire terriers are amazing climbers. They can even climb vertical inclines, like trees and walls, for a pretty impressive height. 
This motivated me to attempt a more thorough investigation and I ended up reading for over two hours last night about Mensch, Claude Taylor, and an nsa guy that tweeted his flaccid penis to a Twitter follower. What a weird world we live in. 
I've been trying to figure Mensch out for a couple of months, her expertise (if any) and her origin story. At first she was kinda fun to follow on Twitter but now I'm having second thoughts about her level of zealotry. 
Look at you with your gravity defying ac vents! I guess my house is kinda older with the ducts run under the floors from the heat pump to floor vents. 
Where do young homeowners keep their AC vents? All of mine are in the floor. 
It's all screwy. App says I bought it May 22nd 2017. I knew I didn't but it but I checked Gmail just in case and the only instances of "mordor" are wishlist reminders from steam. 
>Mommy’s Little Bundle Of Health Code Violations

😁 
No one cares about your penis. 
I have slugs and earwigs that hurt my feelings every year by chewing holes in some things and eating my marigolds down to jagged stems. Why are they so inconsiderate! 
I'm 3 series behind but I still went ahead and bought this. 
I used to use memrise when it had cards with little user submitted learning mnemonics on it to really help you memorize vocabulary, like ms paint pictures. Now it's almost unrecognizable and the mems are all gone. I still remember some of the silly ones. 
Oh god, those animated menus; especially the one that screams at you again and again at the end of every loop until you press play. 😨
And now I need another rewatch. I'm cursing fox right now for dropping it off Netflix but I really need some Buffy in my life right now so I'll have to get my DVD's out like a damn caveman. 
Great point. At the time I first watched season 6 I was in sweatpants, never left my bedroom, feeling like I'm drowning, disappointed to wake up each morning; I had completely given up. But watching Buffy keep slogging through each day, still making a difference while feeling nothing, going through the motions, was something I desperately needed to see. I started the show in season 5, with The Body as my first episode, so it kinda found me right when I needed to see people survive darkness and sorrow. And ask for help. It took me months still to get out of bed, but it gave me hope and it gave me a reason to want to wake up in the mornings to see what's next (they were airing 2 episodes per night on fx).  Buffy is a superhero to me just for getting out there everyday, for trying.    
Oh yeah, the commentaries absolutely are what introduced me to the writers in a way that I feel like I know them. And after a zillion watch throughs you can pick out their personalities in their episodes. 
Yeah Buffy the Vampire Slayer ran from 1997 to 2003. Spike and Angel were melting hearts well before Twilight was written. 
I'm sitting here right now with store open on my xbox and Steam store open on my phone. I can get Tropico penultimate edition with 4 dlc from Xbox for $12.50 or I can get the complete collection with all 12 dlc from Steam for $12.62. It's super obvious which the better deal is but I'd love to have a nice sim on xbox. I hate making decisions!  
You're so welcome. I know this sub is full of Buffy nerds but I wasn't sure how many Buffy-writer nerds might be here. I'm always interested when I hear *anything* about Espenson, Deknight, Fury, Goddard, Greenwalt, but I've always been extra fascinated by Noxon because of the darkness of season 6. The darkness of season 6 saved me from my own darkness once upon a time. 
I intended to read just the Buffy bits but I got sucked in, so I thought I'd post the article in case anyone else finds Noxon's journey interesting. 

>The reason I fell in love with Buffy was because of the ambiguity, because she was a superhero and a hot mess. I hadn’t seen anything like her on TV — ever,” says Noxon.  

P.S I like that she's going to work with Cousin Beth again (Amy Adams is starring in Noxon's HBO series Sharp Objects)!       
Dammit op, just pre-ordered this one and Willow from Amazon because of you. (Thanks) 
Black Flag is what I'm playing through right now actually. I want to sail and buy things for my ship and I don't want to be inconvenienced by assassin-ing. 
That is really weird. It's almost as if they don't know the show very well if the marketers don't realize that it transcended gender lines and isn't a "chick show". Once you get past the title and the low budget teeny-bopper-ness of season 1, it's an EVERYONE show.
I sang Abba's [Dancing Queen](https://youtu.be/xFrGuyw1V8s?t=20s) but good point with the water.
That looks super cute, love the creature noises. Is there an android version, looks well suited for touch-screen?
Black mold helps keep the immune system in fighting shape. 
My comment is, did you see that steamlink on sale today in Amazon for $15? That's a heckuva good price. 
I had no idea about lit/lighted. I say "I lit the match". I looked it up and both are correct, but I was unaware of lighted so TIL. http://grammarist.com/usage/lighted-lit/
I think you just convinced me not to get the only game I was considering. I'm TERRIBLE at both spelunky and Binding of Isaac; too much happenings too fast for me in my old age.   
I've heard it from less educated people around Southern Appalachia, but it's still incorrect grammar. They also say "I seen it" instead of "I saw it" and have other problems with verbs. 
It still sounds weird to me but I'll accept it; my obsession is college football, not basketball. 
May I ask what country *you* come from? I know there's goaltending and field goals, but I've not heard anyone refer to the actual hoop/basket as a goal. 
I too am suffering serious pokeball shortage. I had to come home this morning and leave a charmander behind because all I have left are a few red and white balls, and even though I did attempt to catch him in one with a raspberry, he was still red difficulty and I gave up after 3 tries of him busting out immediately. I didn't want to be *completely* ball-less!  
Then you see something like goats chowing down on poison ivy, they love the stuff, and realize it's not foolproof, so there was still some bravery involved. I think poison I've on the inside would be way worse than poison ivy on the outside. 
>Alex Jones's film Endgame: Blueprint for Global Enslavement proposes that the Guidestones are a harbinger of self-appointed elites who intend on exterminating most of the world's population.

Of course it does.    
I might have just made up my own language for them over time. I call the single issues 'comic books', bound collected singles I call 'trade paperback', and a story that initially releases as a full product, never as single issues, I usually call 'graphic novel'. I'm sure there are other people like me who have made up or picked up on their own definitions that has nothing to do with shame or embarrassment.    
Ha, I loved it; I honestly didn't know any better and I was pretty obsessed with ET. 
Her teeth are so clean! 
I never saw an article! That makes sense though, thank you. I love the pictures.  
I actually rewatched it this year to look back on it as the Trump predictor episode; still didn't much care for the presentation of what it had to say, even though there was a lot of truth in it.  
Yes I was trying to decide between San Junipero and white Christmas for my vote and I ultimately decided on San Junipero. I was not then surprised to see both at the top but I was surprised to see Shut Up and Dance in 3rd; that episode leaves me feeling wrung out and I've not yet been tempted to rewatch it, even though I've rewatched the others at least twice.   
>The story is sometimes considered an early example of detective fiction with protagonist Walter Hartright employing many of the sleuthing techniques of later private detectives. The use of multiple narrators (including nearly all the principal characters) draws on Collins's legal training, and as he points out in his Preamble: "the story here presented will be told by more than one pen, as the story of an offence against the laws is told in Court by more than one witness".

That book seems like quite the undertaking for such a young child. I wonder what about it makes it her favorite book, or if that bit was just made up.        
The changes between the EW Buffy reunion photo shoot and the photos of her this past week made me do a double take. The change seemed to have happened very quickly.  
My eyes just got big imagining theme hospital with modern graphics on X1 (or pc, don't care, just want updated graphics/compatibility). 
It's probably not something I'll do regularly, but it's pretty cool to be able to participate in a gym. I stopped even checking them months ago, as all of the defenders had over a thousand cp on my highest, and they all seem to have snorlax, arcanine, rhydon and gyrados in there. I've never even seen a snorlax in the wild, rhydon are rare here and my highest is 400, and having only caught 5 magikarp since launch day, gyrados is a pipe dream. I'm working on catching growlithe this week though so hopefully I can make an arcanine too.    
Oh no, I grabbed 10 immediately as soon as I stuck him in the gym. I'm just super surprised he lasted the night so I could get another 10 coins. 
Oh oops, yes! I left him named so I'd remember that I used the naming trick once. And he's still in there this morning! Other players built up the gym from level 4 to 8 and my sub-2000 Pokémon is still at the bottom. I got 20 coins, I'm pretty happy. 
I'm still debating on the dlc, but the base game itself had tons of content that I'm nowhere near completing. I'm going to play more this weekend to make up my mind about hot wheels and blizzard mountain. Honestly, just driving around in FH3 is fantastic. 
I will have you know that I currently have a Pokémon in a gym for just the 3rd time ever. I have excellent timing! I've been playing since launch but I'm always too far behind to fight at gyms; today I stopped by a gym that only had 3 of my team's Pokémon in there so I decided to give it a go and I stuck in a Sakura. 
I love my Rubbermaid coated wire full closet organizer things. I felt so butch when I installed those by myself. 
I could look at samples of paint, tile or carpet for hours. And the organization stuff, heaven! 
You might not be from USA but here we often use university and college interchangeably. Or at least we did back in my day when I went to college, at the University of Tennessee. 
Anyone know is there a sub just for Android hardware deals like there are for other interests (like r/greatxboxdeals, r/gamedeals, r/buildapcsales, r/boardgamedeals)?    
I finally got it overnight last night. Hopefully you will too. 
Yeah I have a pair of all white reeboks that I've been favoring for too long and I need a replacement. I have navy and white Stan Smiths that are really comfortable and your link shows them in all white so I might get some of those. Those Air Force 1 look so good too but maybe a little heavy; I recently have been wearing some super lightweight [Reebok Furylite chukkas](https://1256852360.rsc.cdn77.org/en/36467-full_product/reebok-furylite-chukka-shark-coal-white.jpg) and now my other sneakers feel heavy in comparison. 
I did. I just double checked and the only option under account is UNlink Microsoft account, so I'm definitely signed in. I'll keep trying.  
Thanks, hopefully it'll somehow trigger before Friday.  
I've really been trying. I tuned in on mixer mobile during the big xbox event Sunday, signed in with my Microsoft account, got nothing. So I tuned in at 6 eastern Monday for the Xbox daily show on mixer, watched it all, got nothing. So I tuned in today for the Xbox daily show, watching right now, still nothing though. 

I really want rare replay but I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.   

Update Wednesday morning: I finally got my stuff overnight last night. 
...and the highest levels of our government. 
Shit, not Risch again.
Then for decades all new scandals will end in -flower. 
Thanks, I'm looking at some on Amazon now. I do have one pair of navy/orange superstars but I really want some solid white sneaks.  
Oh jeez, those are many hundreds of dollars a pair. Wow. Good thing I really like Reebok and Adidas and don't have Saint Laurent taste. 
I really like the sneakers (in the op image not the ones in the store there). I wonder if those are puma as well. 
Hey thanks for responding. This game really took me by surprise; I'm not big into cars or racing and hadn't bought a car game since Need for Speed Underground on ps2, but I played a little Burnout Paradise I got in a humble bundle last year, then tried FH3 on a whim and I love it. I thought I might be a weirdo playing it solo though. :) 
I'm debating the exact same thing, Hot Wheels expansion and Stardew on console. Does anyone know if the Hot Wheels dlc would still be fun for someone who's never done any multiplayer in Forza Horizon 3? I just figure there's no way I'd be competitive against other players and I don't want to worry about being terrible so I only play solo just to drive and have fun. 
Oh that is really cool, thanks. 
I got so anxious that I was going too slow, exploring too much or not in the right way, that I had an anxiety attack and turned off my internet connection so no one could enter my game and get impatient with me. Not being able to tell them that it's my first time through, I felt silently judged! I haven't finished my playthrough (I only just bought it a couple of weeks ago) but I haven't decided if I'll keep the network connection turned off or not when I continue. I really wish I could just chill and enjoy shit. /sigh  
That Ori looked gorgeous. I guess I need the first game. 
It's just way too co-op focused for me now that I've seen this much of it; I almost exclusively prefer solo play in my old age, and if I do get the urge to remind myself why I mostly avoid mp, I've always got Rocket League and Overwatch. If I could run my own ship with an ai crew, like Assassin's Creed black flag, I'd be interested still. Oh well. 
Song is called Numbers, by Daughter, of anyone else liked it. 
I was interested in Sea of Thieves at least year's e3 but I think I'm over it now. In fact the only two I was interested in were that and Cuphead. 
That's fucking awful. How could anyone be so heartless, so oblivious to suffering? I wish I hadn't seen this post. :(
Thank you for posting these, I decided to go ahead and grab dragon age inquisition. I was around 20th hours in when my EA access expired and I want to continue playing it on and off as slowly as I like with no pressure. 
I really need a new external hdd, my 1tb is bursting at the seams right now.  
But does yours offer an alien repeatedly falling into tar pits, because mine does. 
I still have my original ET! And Yars Revenge, Asteroids, missile command, kaboom, breakout, Pac-Man, barnstorming. Those are the ones I remember without digging out the old box.  
I've almost unsubscribed from r/dogecoin due to my own inactivity a couple of times while tidying and pruning my sub lists, but each time I've clicked on the sub before removing and seeing the community posts immediately change my mind and I don't want to leave. 
Oops, I missed that then. Thanks for the link I'll check it all out when I'm not on mobile. 
That's Google in a nutshell really, convenient and invasive. 
I'll have to check this out. Is dogetipbot still operating? I had a balance in there and I don't know where to buy dogecoin since moolah.io (I think that's what it was called where I bought my coin) shut down in a big bout of shadiness. 
That is super cool and so wholesome. Imagine having that much confidence in yourself, I'd just walk around beaming all the time to have such talent. 
I almost exclusively read books with straight characters (the top fantasy/sci-fi titles that interest me almost never include gay characters, I would love it if they did) but my TV has become much gayer in the 2010's with The 100, Lost Girl, Orphan Black, Orange is the new Black, Wynona Earp, etc. It's still less than half, but it's night and day from the options available to me 20 years ago.  
If she has android and uses Gmail then that's an advertised feature. It's kinda cool actually, it does it for stuff like flights and Amazon packages too. 
It makes me feel crazy and tinfoil-y too. I've spoken to a friend about something on our phones (both android), like the size of squirrels, and then I type in Google search 'how big' and it autofills 'are squirrels' and I'm simultaneously impressed and creeped the fuck out. 
Have you watched Lost Girl? I started watching because it sounded Buffy-ish (and I'm always looking for anything that'll even come close to Buffy the Vampire Slayer) but the gay/bi characters certainly don't hurt and have gotten me through a few otherwise low points in the show. I started season 4 this week. 
Duuuuuude! I had no idea it got gay (and I'm not going to read the rest of this thread bc I don't want to know who, even though I def have a guess) and now I'm stoked because I loved season 1. I kept telling my friends "Supergirl is terrible and I love it!". 
It is blowing up my mind that he can't understand that the investigation that was closed was a totally different investigation about an email server. 
Oh you have got to be kidding Risch. That's not the way strong arm tactics work. What a twat. 
You have no idea how far Chicago is from the rest of the country do you? I at least live in the same general region as Chicago and it's still 9h 45m drive. It'd be a 31h drive from somewhere like Oregon. How is that so much more fair to USA? 
This is so helpful, thank you! The googled pics of both the plant and the scale matches perfectly. All I could find was fungus and white flies so I'm really glad I asked here for a second opinion. I will try my best to get rid of it now I know what I'm fighting; it has really done a number on the poor shrub. 
This is in Southeastern US zone 7. The white eggs/fungus (?) has overtaken this unknown species of bush and turned not just the leaves, but the wood itself (as seen in gallery photos) white while the leaves are turning sickly pale yellow and dying. Can anyone ID the bush and/or the pest/disease? And is it too far gone to save?

Thank you for looking.
No problem; I haven't seen WW yet myself, but I'm all about Robin Wright as a warrior in every movie please. 
Top two are Robin Wright from Princess Bride and Wonder Woman, and the bottom two are Carrie as Princess Leia and General Leia Organa. Both actors went from playing princesses to generals.   
Princess Buttercup was played by Robin Wright (unless you were being sarcastic and I'm too gullible).  
I am baffled by this photo. I had an entire conversation with myself, out loud, about this picture, along the lines of "No way, no fucking way, this can't be real. Was it Halloween? Why are their pants so high? That had to be stuffing for a costume, no kids store fat right in the middle like that. Why are they wearing that stuff? Suspenders? Wow." 

So yeah, I'm SUPER impressed by this photo, and still not sure these aren't costumes and stuffing.  
I am also a classless, uncultured Philistine in that I enjoyed the widescreen version even with all of the  zooming and weird color palettes! I know I should be shunned from the sub for my uncouth tastes, but I do have the box set so I've watched it at least 5 times through as originally intended. That said, the one thing that really bothers me about the redo is the brightness in certain scenes that needed to be dark to feel right, like Buffy and Angel's first kiss for example. It was way too bright in Buffy's bedroom!   
You can tell it's not poor understanding on the writers part because the next panel she responds that it doesn't stay in, and the writers wrote that line too. 
Or just take two minutes to cancel the membership you buncha weirdos. 
I don't (as a woman myself) always feel a need to identify with my characters, but occasionally it can be fun. In Fallout, Elder Scrolls and Mass Effect games I tend to make my character represent me, whereas in Overwatch my top two played are Reaper and Roadhog. I also have a thing for playing old man wizards!   
On android lollipop I use an app called Longshot that captures and stitches them together into one long pic. 
Good to know, thank you. I've read the descriptions and narrowed it down to these two options, and both seem to be built for carrying quick charge current. Thanks for responding.

I remember when ps4 came out there were lots of warnings from people who made the mistake of plugging in their dualshock ps4 controllers into their Samsung phone's fast charger and learned the hard way never to do that after burning their controllers up and even causing the batteries to swell. But you are pretty confident that a Kindle or a Fire tablet can handle a fast charger better? And thanks for responding. 
I think I might be broken then. I've been underweight for years and on levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. May 2016 my thyroid levels were fine, but I started gaining weight. By the time I'd gained 15lbs my doctor weighed in that he needed to retest my thyroid; results showed a drastic increase in TSH. He doubled my dosage 3 times before my numbers fell into normal range, but in the process I'd gained 26lbs. I'm still completely stunned and I have to learn to lose weight now, after years of learning how to gain weight. So maybe the 5lbs thing is not set in stone for everyone. (And no I'm not obese, but I *definitely* had to buy new pants).

That's almost the opposite of its common meaning: excited, amped, stoked. It's a really happy, energetic word where I come from (NY and TN). 
I caught my first swinub last week, but i've never seen a sneasel, a magmar or a cloyster. Also I've been playing since launch and only seen/caught one ponyta, so I'll be looking to grab a few for candy hopefully. 
That really sucks to hear. It's very much my type of game and I had it on my wishlist. 
Yep, I read the comic and burst into tears. I'm sitting on my bathroom floor crying, wishing I had someone to just bring me a cold wash cloth or ask if I'm okay. :( 
I think that what I did. Deleted everything, switched downloads settings to SD card, wrote down the two internal/SD storage available numbers, then downloaded a book and an audiobook to test. :)

Just opened mine; go into settings then storage and it shows I have 20 GB free on my SD card, and underneath that is where you flip the 'switches' to download apps, movies, music, books, Etc to SD card. Happy downloading.   
Yes actually. I got the super cheap 7" one and at first I couldn't fit much on it, but then they added SD card support for Kindle and Audible so it's much better now. You just have to switch your download preferences to SD card in settings. It won't move old downloads but future ones will go to SD. My Fire is now a dedicated comic books reader.  
I had to stop buying physical comics 3 years ago; I have no more room and it was making me anxious and depressed trying to figure out where to put my new comics every month. So I've switched over to all digital (except for Buffy which I'm way behind on). My Kindle Fire just got a huge workout downloading all of these. 
I just kept telling myself that I may never see another sale like this again so it's okay. I only really feel guilty about rebuying some that I already own as physical single issues, but want access to them anytime without having to fight through boxes and mylar bags and old invisible tape. I sold my laziness for a couple of dollars per volume and I feel a little sheepish for that. But still, what a bargain! 
Can it shoot back and front or does that require a special double shooter? 
I am generally so careful with money, but I just went kinda nuts. I ended up getting:

* Runaways 1-8
* Vision 1-2
* Ms Marvel 1-4
* Civil War
* Civil War II
* Jessica Jones Alias 1-4
* Marvels
* Wolverine Origin
* Old Man Logan
* Astonishing X-Men 1-4
* Exiles 1-6 (I'm trying to decide whether to also buy Exiles 7-16)

The guilt is beginning to set in.
The cheapest I ever bought a year for was $27 so I can't stop comparing to that, even though $42 really isn't bad when compared to $60. And I easily get my $42 worth just from GwG.  
She looks mid 20's to me.  
The days of $30 seem to be long gone. I held out for a few months watching sales, but I finally paid $42 to renew this month.

I turned AR on and off, moved around, but the world was always upside down when I went back into AR. Likely just an odd occurrence and not actually related to Gilgar. 
It must be sarcasm, because I still say it like English-mun.  
I don't regret paying for reddit is fun app one bit. I don't even know what the paid version added but I did it as a way to thank the developer.

Saw this on the front page this morning, including some tricities natives coming out of the woodwork to find their people.

There's a r/tricities sub but it's not very lively. 
I'm not sure if hail can happen in winter; if it can, it's likely rare, I've not seen or heard of it it before. Hail usually falls when its warm outside, thus you'll find people grabbing a hail ball and sticking it in the freezer to preserve the size before it starts melting.      
The 4th one I tried piqued my curiosity: 
>Ann Pratchett, State of Wonder: A Novel. 

I've not heard of it or her, but I added it to goodreads to consider later as a palate cleanser between my preferred fantasy/sci-fi books.    
Love this one! When I was a kid I had a Pac-Man poster on my wall that I won at the carnival. I decided from that poster that Clyde is my favorite ghost, but inky's blue looks really good here.

I paid the dollar at release. I don't regret it a bit, but I find it very curious why they no longer want to be compensated for their work after just a couple of months. 
Genuinely made me laugh out loud. 😂 
Yeah I got two in a row opening these through reddit is fun app on Android, pop-up (I didn't read it, I just remember asterisks) with vibration set on max. 
Also when they try to pant while laying down, lips on the ground, they draw their lips back like this.

I bought the starter device that helped me quit smoking from you guys, Joyetech Ego AIO. Thanks! 
Congrats to whoever wrote the description for the Apple waffle, that sounds amazing. 
I think everything is so skewed that recalibration is going to take a long while. I have found myself thinking over the past few months "I miss Mitt Romney", whereas in 2012 I felt so betrayed that a friend voted for Romney that I told her we needed to stop talking politics for a bit. The bar is so low right now that we do need reminders; I'm guilty of it myself. 
Ohhhh okay, audio track never crossed my mind. Thanks for all the info and I'll look to see what's available this evening. Twilight used to be on Netflix so I'll see if it's still there and I'll check out the RiffTrax prices. 
Alright, I now want to watch twilight as well! I'm unfamiliar with rifftrax, is it something you watch on YouTube or is it real movies you buy from Amazon or rent from google play store, etc? 
Looks like more of a near collapse or dry heave to me. I bet her legs were like jello at that point.

I feel so left out, being on lollipop. 🍭 😢 
I use Google text to speech maybe 25% of the time. The comment I was replying to though was about using text speak, like how some people abbreviate every word (thx/wut/l8r, etc), when in reality that's much harder work and slower than swipe typing and autocorrect, so why do old people do it? Who knows!  
I can totally imagine dogs enjoying easy listening country, like Kenny Rogers and John Denver. I bet they would also enjoy Enya.  
Mine writes out 'kama' half the time. Maybe my accent is weird or I don't know how to say comma. 
Plus I'd have to stop, backspace, reselect the not-a-word to let autocorrect know you were dead serious about whatever abbreviation you just typed, teach your keyboard the word, then move on. SwiftKey acts like a real butt sometimes if I'm trying to type a made-up word; I'd spend at least twice as long fighting autocorrect.   
It's it just noise cancel mouse ears or is it the ones with a radio tuner? I'm wondering what station I'd pick to sooth a dog. 
I upgraded from a CRT to a 40" HDTV specifically because of Mass Effect 2! I just couldn't read any of the dialogue choices and that was the last straw. 
I don't believe dmv was knocking the font, rather the bad grammar. 
I never had any problem getting into it and experienced no slump either. It's my favorite fantasy book and I'm really glad I didn't have to wait until 40% for it to get good because I've been trying to turn over a new leaf - learning to put a book down and not force my way through it if it's not working for me. Life is too short and books too plentiful. So yeah, super thankful I was captivated from the the start.   
Same, I would love to replay it with the dlc. It was one of my favorite 360 games. 
Oh shit, yes. That was driving me crazy because it was so familiar but couldn't put the memory together.

Can you share what movie it was? There's a noface in Spirited Away, but is there a Madonna connection?  
I got spooked from OKcupid too, I don't know why I thought I could handle Tinder.

I had to share this after I literally tried Tinder for the first time last week, for 3 days. Deleted my account, done. Back to boredom and loneliness for me.

I really love that name even though I think of Pokémon and The Evil Dead.  
I'm pondering what craziness I might have named myself as a young teen. I was obsessed with Madonna and Michael Jackson so probably something to do with one of their albums or something equally eye-rolly in retrospect.  
You're actually supposed to to keep smoking while reading the book as he wants your full attention and doesn't want you distracted or struggling as you read. So you could just read super slow! 
Not who you were asking but it's a common phrasing, "adjective as fuck", in English. Ex. Tidy as fuck, hot as fuck, tired as fuck. 
Glad to help, but I didn't tell you the possible downside. You may never spell it incorrectly again but you may catch yourself reading it forever more as dee-fy-night. I never even needed help spelling it, but I taught someone de**finite**ly one time and now I can't stop saying it weirdly in my head.  
I've never seen anyone thank a stranger for not being fat, but it seems like it really means a lot to you! Anyway, since I'm here, remember that there's a **finite** number of ways to spell de**finite**ly. I hope that might be helpful to you (if you want). 
My library uses Overdrive to handle their distribution of digital media, books and audiobooks. Your library might use a different software.
I understand that it's annoying, I've had to block so many porn subs targeted towards men from my r/all, and there are still new and surprising ones that pop up regularly. But I think it's worth the effort of a few one-time clicks to clean up /all to my liking. That said, I'll be happier once things settle down.   
I'll *think* about it! 
You're welcome. I use it sparingly because I mostly make use of my public library + overdrive to listen free. But occasionally this comes in handy and I have a nice little cheap audible library.
