Wonder what they’ll do with Alfie’s organs. Stem cell research? Maybe something like a cure can come out of his disease if they research his stem cells...
That’s because the people that want to reveal their face are beautiful :(
But they offered to keep him alive where the UK said “lol he dead”

Then he stayed alive 4 days after having the plug pulled and literally starved to death. 
If they know you’re an organ donor they do less to keep you alive so they can harvest your organs. 

May seem like a conspiracy but it actually makes a lot of sense.

There are a lot of things to set someone off. Doesn’t mean he is mentally unstable. People need to stop making fun of mentally ill people, it isn’t a joke and shouldn’t be used lightly to describe someone that is slightly different. He might have been holding it back for this log and seeing his friends in the music industry and Hollywood constantly talk bad about a president. A president, mind you, that Kanye never said he agreed with on a policy scale. He might just like the guy and what he’s for, not the policy he puts forth.

They aren’t censoring this sub though. You’re talking about a couple subscriber numbers.

So yes, a waste of time and money for spez to go “yeah, I fake everyone’s subscribe count”
Why is this threat of going to congress going around. It’s honestly idiotic..

Am I missing anyone? Oh, probably just everyone who wasn’t a Jew and happened to adamantly support hitler to the fullest effect.

It’s like I said it loads at the beginning like every game ever. And sometimes inbetween. Like every game ever

But it puts you right in the game the moment you hit continue. Just like god of war does. 
They have. For me (I play on pc.. I forgot this is on the PlayStation sub aha) it takes me a couple minutes all around 
Still doesn’t take that long to load.. 
Doesn’t take that long..

Plus the game loads the entire map and all its assets. The only time you load after that initial load is about 1 minute or less between the intermittent cutscenes. 
Just cause 3 does this. It’s spawned you around the same area you were in, you hit continue and it just starts.

Most bills have things shoved in them last second so law makers can get laws they want passed passed. 

For instance. Last year let’s say they wanted to pass a new higher milk tax. It doesn’t pass but another bill comes along saying we should tax the farmer more instead. So, they add in “also herein the products made from the dairy cattle receive x% tax increase”

No one reads it and boom. Dairy prices go up

It’s legal in most cases, federal especially.

I can’t really.. it’s been a while just search “over internet server setup” requires a third party app I believe. (The server is at my friends house. He has better internet)
It was a joint project with a friend. It’s technically his server but I use it over the internet. It has an i5 6600 in it with a Gtx 970. It’s mainly a media server with a combination of all of our movies for his family and mine over Plex. Really good machine and it can encode over 5 movies at once (that excludes streaming) 

Other than that it has a NAS drive in it for instant cloud access over the server network we created. 

Edit: Well.. a day or so later I realize my typo. I put i5 6700 and that doesn’t exist. Corrected to the actual chip 6600 because I’m dumb apparently 
Agreed. That’s why I use it lol

Actually no he didn’t. He boosted the FTC’s budget and allowed the FCC to end their pull on Net Neutrality so that the FTC could take over. The internet is now more of a trade of information than a communication according to some places. 

The FTC isn’t the big bad place that people think it is. And the fact that they are saying that people should be able to repair their own shit when people have been asking to do that for years is amazing. Really great move.

So pretty much the only way the X wins out on the plus models is by being the same sized phone but taking out the bezels. Honestly I’d rather have a bigger phone. 
But they made it better and look cool! /s

Honestly, I say we clone Rand Paul and he be the senate, the house, and congress. Hell. Make him speaker Vice President and president 
He’s not trying to fight for one side or the other. If you haven’t noticed he’s very bipartisan. Wants both sides to achieve a common goal instead of pushing for one thing or the other

Come September when the next spending bill comes up I expect to see him pushing for a better bill. One that funds the things he said this bill should have funded. No more shoulda coulda woulda 
Really the only case he could have made is that 16 hours isn’t enough time to read a 3k page omnibus bill. 
The omnibus has 2/3 majority. Congress could over rule
They don’t make a profit? They aren’t a business? But they need money to preform missions

14 hours later and I finally notice. Haha..
I’m not bought into anything, I’m using my own economic knowledge, albeit not that of an expert. 

In the 80’s under Reagan and with reaganomics (a very similar system to how president Trump wants to create) it lead to a crash in the market in the early 80’s and the early 90’s. As a result the US deficit sky rocketed because we needed to up our spending to keep the country flowing. 

I’m not saying this is the case (our economy is much stronger now) but looking at the charts and the GDP, something has to slip. Economies can’t go up the graph without coming down it somewhere. Might me tomorrow or it might be 10 years from now. Either way, it’s going to happen and Deere tax cuts are intact going to be to blame. Regardless of how great they are in the short run. 
If you’re pressing down super hard maybe. But you’d feel the resistance before you put enough pressure. Screens aren’t that fragile
The problem I have here, and tax cuts are great and all. 

But we’ve had an increase in spending, that increase followed by lower taxes means a big boost in the national debt. The money has to come from somewhere if it’s not coming from taxes. 
Because liberals don’t think black people can ever be qualified for jobs. Duh /s

And the worst grammar 
I did see the dean. He didn’t care. 

Pretty sure it is legal, just file it under disruptive conversation and you can be sent out of class
I have an AMD phenom II x6 1100T and a 1050ti. 

The game runs fine on medium settings. Frames only really drop to about 50 when there’s a big city with lots of people or when there’s a Ping Pirate (when someone with a really high ping comes in to lag the server, normally from a different region, and kicks most of the players out of the game)
I meant to say “faster than a bomber getting shot by flak over Britain” 

WWII reference 
Yes, there was a strict no debate rule set up by faculty. When the dean was told he said “there is no such rule” but he still didn’t do anything to stop it. 
No lie, I told the dean and he said it was unacceptable

Still didn’t do anything
Debate in class is not allowed. Not in my highschool or even college. The one time I brought up a simple talking point the teacher shot me down faster than a flak cannon over Britain. And anyone who tried to start the conversation back up again got 10 points deducted from their grade.

Cocaine is leaps and bounds more harmful than most drugs. 

Coca leaves in their pure state are no different from marijuana, and I have no issues with marijuana 
Family mobile doesn’t have contracts 

Source: work at Walmart 
Why not? They still committed a crime. Decriminalizing it will just mean they don’t go to jail in one state for commuting a crime seen in the eyes of the federal government. 
This is the point I’m going for. You can eat coca leaves, that should be legal. But cocaine the substance is incredibly poisonous 
It is only legal medically in a select few states. 

Don’t try to spread fake news about it being legal. You have to be supervised and you’re given less than a gram. 

If you carry it and recreationally use it, it is very illegal
We do help people, that’s why rehab is a thing. You go to prison for doing something illegal, if you are found guilty. You go to rehab while in prison if you were found to be charged with use of said illegal substance. 
You’re good, the phone cards work as well as contract (whether that be from straight talk or something) my grandmother uses it and pays $30 a month for unlimited talk and text and 6 gigs of 4g data. All to herself (she brought her own phone from Verizon)

Pretty decent deal. You don’t always need a contract, just easier to sell phones with a contract 
Does that also mean cocaine should be legal? It’s made from a plant too
You mean that Clinton had to rape someone with a cigar to get a blowjob? 
It was at Walmart. It wasn’t a contract phone. You buy the phone and you buy the cards to actually use the phone. Not a bad deal when you think about it instead of assuming everything is on a contract
Walmart. 
From using the product, androids are always loaded down with crap which slows the phone. 

The camera is slightly better than Apple, sure, but it’s negligible. 

You can argue “but muh 4K screen” but honestly I don’t want a 4K screen on such a tiny screen. It’s a phone,  not a television. 
Oh, I’d didn’t mean to come across that way, I knew you were agreeing with me but it would seem many people keep assuming what country I live in. 
Yes it does. That phone is fairly cheap and a really good phone for the price (wow, just looked up the price and it is $160 most places) so I don’t understand the comments saying Apple doesn’t have a starter device when they do. 

Samsung just pumps out overpriced stuff that is underpowered compared to say an iPhone 8 at a similar price. I’ve always found android phones to be laggy and not as smooth, that may be product of the OS’s or not. But I think I’ll stick with my 6s plus for as long as I can before upgrading.

Generally speaking yeah. Depends on the gun. If it’s a rifle it’s iffy, compensators and suppressors make it more difficult but sniper shots are normally easier. E and W are easier than N and S but it’s all pretty easy to spot out
Either way it looks like a pretty standard movie. I’ll wait for the redbox release

Home Front: The Revolution

It seems I am one of the few that loved the first home front. It had its quirks and its dialogue was bad in some places.. but the action never seemed to let me down. It was easy in some places and unforgivably hard in others (mainly the sections where you had to sneak or there was a base of operations you had to take over)

This is absurd. I would take the advice of some others commenters and go to a women’s shelter.

Nuclear is probably the most cost effective energy per capita we have. Solar and wind combined can barely keep up. 

I say we get rid of coal and boost nuclear power plants, make them even more safe than they are now, push the substations out further to reach more people and cost of energy would go down in the long run

The same way any bubble bursts. It was getting too big and people started selling en masse, the price of a btc dropped dramatically in only a day. 

The craze started because the price of a bitcoin was still relatively low, so people invested and mined for coins. The more people get rid of a currency the worse it does. 

Say for instance you get a large sum of USD, (1 million and the economy is small for argument sake) then you exchange it all for euros, euro market rises and USD market falters a bit. 
Yes and no, the mining craze is dying down now that the bitcoin bubble is shrinking and about to burst

I would honestly like to know who he is. Like some others say, there’s supposed to be a balance. Where there is someone as powerful as Snoke (a guy who can literally alter the brainwaves of a person in the most remote part of the galaxy and basically become omnipotent) you start asking questions. Questions like “if he was so powerful and all seeing why was Kyle so easily able to fool him”
“Why can Rey put up a decent fight against his force mind read thing?”
“Who the fuck is he????”
It was also supposed to be the main operation center, and much more cheaper in the long run than a gigantic fleet of star destroyers. Iirc

They can’t. That’s against the law outside of nn anyway. 

Did they ever do that pre 2015? (Before net neutrality)
It’s safe to say that We’ve all had the Internet with and without net neutrality (added in 2015. Implemented 2016) and before that the Internet was fine. I don’t remember having to pay $400 for 2mbps internet and paying $20 per comment I made online. 

The only real difference that taking away nn would do is to pave the way for a better internet law to be made by congress, the fcc, or the FTC. Which, IMO, is a lot better than what the nn laws had. 

Not only that but we have communication and internet laws outside of net neutrality that protect us.

Turns out, most law makers are pretty smart and forward thinking.

This is the point I was getting at 

The cop probably got spooked cause the guy reached for waist band he would still be alive and in holding pending trial.  I’ve asked a few of my cop buddies what they thought and they said it was a shitty situation but the cop that shot the culprit acted by the books, and they did mention that asking him to crawl did confuse. But as you said, my cop buddies said that they would find the cop not guilty too.

The guy was told to get on the ground and put his hands in the air. 

He put his hands in the air for literally 10 seconds then put them down and started crawling towards the officer and reaching into his waistband.

Eh I was more saying that it was a new idea. Was good because it was something that at least I haven’t seen before. If another company can come along and do it over better in a sequel-esque manner then it would be a pretty neat game. 
Mat Pat did a pretty good theory on this recently. 

Saying that if more people demanded better games then, like an artistic revolution, better games will come. 

Think of it like modernism is the games of the 80’s/90’s. The ones everyone loved: Mario, Zelda, etc. they didn’t really have a story but they were fun to play. 

Now enter postmodernism, the 2000’s. Games had a story at the beginning but then they slowly start to divulge into games for the hell of making a game. Think: indie games that comment on how stupid and repetitive Mario can be sometimes. Rock simulator. Soda drinking simulator. Etc. there are still a few gems that crop up (horizon zero dawn, mario odyssey, persona 5, etc.) But then there’s the games that were made because why not and because money (battlefront 2, destiny 2 the list can go on forever). 

Post-postmodernism would be the revelation that making crappy games may look good on a business model but it doesn’t make fans happy. This may take a couple years of outrage or it may take decades. It depends on the market and how we react to new games and crap AAA titles. 

Just a theory though
