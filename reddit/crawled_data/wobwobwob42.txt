10nyears ago, those were the analog audio channels for some the TV stations around here. In Boston there were no free channels. Also there were a ton of pirate stations around bleeding over into each other...along with hundreds of low powered college stations.... basically Boston's fm spectrum was a mess before digital TV.
Probably! Thank god I don't need one anymore :)
LIES! Your answer goes against my perceived narrative!

Anyways, I've never gotten one to work in Boston. But I also haven't tried one in 10 years...

I've been a head since 1984 and I think I've turned exactly 0 people on.  All my Deadhead friends were heads when I met them and is probably the reason we are friends. 

Ive brought friends to shows, put Dead songs in mixes during great parties, Used to make tapes now I make playlists and unless they were already a fan, no one I know has converted.

I think you are born a Head or you are not :)
I'll bet you don't live in a city.

Drove with friends from Providence. I really wasn't in to the Dead anymore at that point but the show was really really good. I remember having fun, but the good times didn't last long...

Got back to Providence that night and my car was gone. A drunk driver totalled it and they towed it away before I got back. There were just small pieces of my car spread down the road to prove that it had been there. That whole experience turned into a nightmare I never want to relive. Ugh...
Man he looks so much better now. 

I saw the Varano Group billboard in the North End and thought to myself "Why didnt they put Nick on that"...turns out they did! I totally thought it was the old Strega manager.

They did this last Saturday in front of my house. It's amazing to watch them work. They just picked up all the wires on the top "rack" and moved it in one amazingly scary motion from one pole to the other.They spent way more time setting up than actually moving anything.
Its been gone for a while. If you subscribed to a playlist while they were still available you will still see it, but none of my subscribed playlist have been updated in over a year.

I never saw him arrive, and I never saw him leave, but if you got up about 4am, you would see him standing there silently, looking out over Boston Harbor.

Actually I dont think this is from even this year. The sand is pushed up against the sea wall at the moment because of all the storms and in this picture the sea wall is exposed. I know I was there all day yesterday.

Also the house on the bend on Shirley street already has his brightly colored beach chairs out but they are not in the picture.

So odd how we all have different reactions. I loved it. I think it smeed slow because its a big room so they let the jokes hang a little longer as it rolls through the audience. I dont think the audience mics pick it all up as well as the smaller places.
Ha! I just subscribed right after listening. No idea why I had not listened before.

I've got a Garmin group called "Running Deadheads" come join!
Keep it up! I ran my first half marathon three years ago while listening to the dead.

 I lost 100 pounds and took up running. For awhile The Dead was all I listened to.  But once I started working on my pace I had to change playlists because I could see my pace slowing down during heavy improv parts. 
I remember that!!!!!  I take that ramp every morning...ugh

I cant say I don't agree with you.....

sigh I wish I could discuss more but gotta run. 

BTW we are conversing in a deleted thread...feels odd. 
I just want to address some of your other points too:

> only because they dredge and truck in huge amounts of sand each year at great expense

Not every year. The last time Yirrell Beach got new new sand was 2013. I have not walked the beach after these past storms, so I dont know if more is needed but I havent heard anyone complaining. Might just take some bulldozers to push it back in place. From looking at that picture it looks like Yirrell always does

> Then the homes get rebuilt periodically with flood insurance, at great expense. 

Which the home owners pay a shit load of money for insurance that doesnt cover half of what the house is worth so they pay the rest out of pocket or with more expensive supplemental insurance. If someone can afford a tiny patch of land near a beach, who are you to tell them they cant?

> People who cannot afford beachfront homes help to pay for these expenses through their tax dollars, then show up to enjoy the beach and are charged a small fortune for parking and sometimes are outright denied access.

You are being very general here. Lets talk about the beach in the picture. That is a public beach. Parking is free. ANyone can show up. People pay taxes for many things they don't use but make the area they live in a better place aka schools.

Mitch's hot take!
> Coastlines are places for all to visit, not for the privileged few to settle.

Im pretty liberal but that made me audibly laugh.

FYI everything in front of those houses is public land. 

You should probably take it down a couple notches comrad.


Do you live there? I do.
Now I need a nickname...
And we are part of Suffolk County but not part of the city. 
Nope, just a sea wall. And the waves easily breached it in two of the three storms.

https://goo.gl/maps/4DuzEYrA9Ys
Shirley St is the main road. Brewster Ave is a sand road, between the houses and Nerious St is not a street at all. Its a sand path between the seawall and the houses they call a street so the houses have an address.
No its not. Its been the same distance for years. I know because I live there. 

Now are waves coming over the sea wall more often? You are darn tootin it is!
I think I know or am related to almost everyone in that picture

It happens! I saw my last show in 91. I was 21 and I was a Head since I was 13. I was sick of the scene. Assholes everywhere. Punk and "grunge" were huge, no one I hung with listened to the Dead anymore, so I stopped listening...for a long time. I ended up believing the hype that the Dead were boring etc. I went to tons of shows all the time, but avoided Dead related acts for years. But you know what, it was all just ok. Loved going to shows, saw some amazing bands, but I wasn't having fun anymore.

Well fast forward to 2009. I bought tickets to see the Dead in Worcester on a whim and dragged a friend to the show. Holy shit! It all clicked! This was what I was missing! This was the music! This was the scene! This was it! Since that show Im 100% back and I go to every show in the Boston area. I love it. I listen to the Dead just about every day now. 

Thats my story.

:)
20 years ago when I bartended for a living I didn't mind it. lol

Now that Im old the fact that most bands hit the stage at 8pm doesn't annoy me as much either

No way. Its not going to be that bad.

[Funny, I just ran across this old pic of mine from Thayers Street, Providence RI around the same time. Big Lebowski was the midnight show.](https://i.imgur.com/Okhferf.jpg)

5 years ago I was 300+ pounds. Im not saying the bombing had anything to do with it, but it was about the same time I decided to stop being a fat piece of shit...and just be a regular piece of shit.

I've run the BAA's 5k, 10k and Half Marathon since. All amazing races. The 5k you get to cross the marathon finish line, so I do have a picture of myself that looks a whole lot like me finishing the marathon...

Wish I could swing going to these shows. I hate having them so close and not being able to dig up the cake...

**EDIT: For clarity, I live 10 mins from the airport**

Me too! I literally pulled it out of my pocket, looked at it, said out loud to myself "Don't lose this!", put back in my pocket, got into a Lyft and it was gone when I got to the airport. 10 mins later. I mean I noticed it the MOMENT I stepped out of the car, before I even closed the door. Wasn't in the car. Its not at my house. Its fuckng gone.

Seriously, if I read this I would be thinking the OP is not telling me something. But it happened exactly like that. I've never lost my wallet ever in my life. All I carrying was a backpack with snacks, a couple chargers, my Surface and my jacket. I was going for a two hour meeting so I brought nothing to make it easy. I am totally confused how this happened
https://streamable.com/8hrv5
Nope. Not flying to DC has cost me a new license and bank card. Everything has been canceled.  
Got to the airport at 4am. Wallet missing. Holy shit! Cant find it anywhere, give up go home to look for it. It's totally missing now...fuck.

Turned out to be a very good thing! I was flying to DC for a two hour meeting at 10am. My 6am flight got delayed until 9am. I would have been stuck on the plane for over three hours and missed my meeting if I didnt lose my wallet.

now I had my meeting at home and Im done for the day :)

No opening act. They will be on stage by no later than 7:45. They could com on earlier but you should be safe getting there by 7:45. 

My advice. Ditch work and check out the parking lot scene before the show. It's a major part of going to a Dead show. Enjoy your self!
Ohhhh thanks for posting! That's an Instagram account worth following!

There is a reason why there are planted/scripped Kiss Cams. The general public SUCKS when a Live TV camera is pointed at them.

In 1982 or so, my best bud came over with American Beauty. We spent the afternoon listening and I loved it! Didn't get to my first Dead show until 86 but I was a fan from day one.
Off road tacticool flip flops.
All I want is a good running shirt that has something dead related front and back.

Its impossible to find a shirt like a basic Under Armour Tech Short Sleeve T-Shirt with a SYF! Make one and Ill buy it :)
The rink guys have unusually tolerant wives. This would not fly in my house lol!


Totally. Mud pit central. But that doesn't deter the Cult that is Hockey players/fans around here :)
Cool thanks! YOu made my lunchtime interesting :)
Good to know!

Also good to know my house has a official name. lol!

Any easy way to find out more about the former occupants other than google? Im not finding anything.

I just bought it in Nov...anything I should know? It was never mentioned....
TIL My house is on National Register of Historic Places...
Its a crapshoot. This year, no problem. Its been cold as hell since Christmas. Other years, not so much! 

The guys I know who do this, they do it every year. It takes them an afternoon to put all the parts back in the yard. Fill it with water, and wait. If it doesn't freeze, oh well! Its not like they are installing full size boards & glass...but Im sure those guys exist :)

Common in the Boston area. We dont have big yards but for those who do, its not uncommon for them to turn the whole yard into a mini rink
Yes. I dated one. Turns out she was a fucking psycho...shocking I know. 
Come to the North Shore some time
Funny to see Bristol on here. How was the 4th parade? Sucky? Lol
What fixed mine was plugging the watch into my PC and updating the watch's firmware via Garmin Express. 
Thanks man! I've been wanting to read that book since it came out, so I'm excited to listen to it Ive read all of Neil's stuff, love it!
> Looking forward to the celebrations!

Why? It kinda sucks.
lol No, sorry! Not what I meant. I mean release Reckoning, then release For The Faithful... The same exact album a couple years later, then re-release it again as Reckoning a year later.
You mean For the Faithful... dont you :)

Love Ari! I've never seen him live, I only know him because he is buds with Joe List & Mark Normand. I love his podcast, great couple hours of audio. I never seen a second of his standup, so I'd be lying if I posted a video.

Default watch face... default everything in fact. I don't modify setting normally. Lost 50% of battery last night while sleeping. That has NEVER happened before.

I uninstalled the app and reinstalled, seems I've got steps back but no sleep for two days. All I care about is steps and runs. As long as those still work I can not worry about it too much. Also battery life. I would hate to go back to the Fitbit "charge every day" way of living.

Oh I'm going! I just won't enjoy it lol
Yeah it broke news yesterday. Looks like a patch today? https://www.cnet.com/news/google-fixing-wi-fi-slaying-chromecast-bug-on-thursday/

One way in & one way out of the parking lot. Its always a shitshow leaving there. Look into VIP parking.

Security are assholes. I haven't been in years, but security used to drive around in golf carts taking "banned items" from people tailgating. 

There is NOTHING around it for after the show. NOTHING.

Personal gripe: Its annoyingly far from Boston, but everyone calls it Boston.
Fucking Mansfield....

Also why should the router patch? This seems like a Chromecast issue?!

Ahhhh I hope they didn't have any FastPasses they missed because of that stunt. Do you know how expensive Disney World is? 
That describes my relationship with Joe. I 100% respect and love his gear talk. He is very very knowledgeable. I can watch him talk about & demo gear for hours. And man he can play BUT I hate watching him live. He just doesn't do it for me on stage. His songs feel so generic and boring to me.

Anyways, if you are at all a gear head, don't miss "Welcome To Nerdville: Inside Joe Bonamassa's Museum and Vintage Guitar Collection" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctx86V-GI8A

I'm lying in bed in our pool view, corner, second floor, princess room in Riverside as I type this. I got everything we requested... other than warm weather.

I was surprised we got such a great room location by just checking some boxes on the check in form and not physically checking in. 

Last day today. Hope MK is magically warm!
I totally avoided that area all day. Going to ride those today. Problem solved lol!
I was there yesterday. I have to say it wasn't terrible. People were generally nice, with our FPs we rode everything we wanted to. I probably won't don't again soon but I don't regret going. I'll be back to the MK tomorrow too :)

Dug up the stub from my first Smithereens show in1990. It was at Springfield College, where my brother went for a while. After the show the whole band came back to the house and we had a good old time :) Somewhere there is a picture of Pat and I at the house while Pat is holding a gigantic inflatable giraffe head we had stolen out of someone's yard and brought to the show. He was very confused why we wanted to take the picture but was cool about it lol. It was one of those amazing nights...

I love Josh Wolf! So glad Doug invited him on the first time, I've become a huge fan
I've heard will be about an ounce lighter...
Video production guy

I got a simpler answer. The flicker is caused by the football flying between the camera and the score keeping thing.

A cameraman is shooting from left of the QB to right at the score to the right of the target and the balls are passing in front of the lense causing the flicker. It looks red in the wide shot but its washed out in the PIP and looks white.  Watch the balls thrown and watch the flickers, they match.

The 32 gig generic card I had sitting in a drawer. I might replace it as the write speed seems a bit slow.

The exit on 93N was backed up a quarter mile at 6:40. I can't imagine how bad it was 93S. 
Posting from my X4. So glad I made the jump.

Thanks /r/nexus5x Im out.
Yup me too.

Restored from the 5x via cloud backup and I'm having no issues. I almost didnt do this because I had many issues restoring when the 5x was new.
I have that one on my phone right now. Feels great. Its very basic protection, It gives the screen a bit of space and the camera "bump" is now recessed.  But anything better than trying to hold the buttered hotdog that is the X4 without a case.
I love you.
I owned Light Flow Pro from my 5x. I installed it on the X4 and the app confirms that there is no light. I am sad.
Good to know! I'll edit
Its totally done post. You can modify it afterwards too.
Lol no problem! Settings - Scroll down to the very bottom Storage Location
As soon as I held it in my hand I ordered a case. It's slick feeling phone. But that being said, after a full day of use, fingerprints don't show up anymore and the phone is less slippery. Either way I'm going to use the case, can't risk it. As for a screen protector, I didn't use one for the 5xand I don't plan on using one on the X4.
No doubt you will feel it's an upgrade from the N6. The UI is like butter comparatively. 

Now if I could just figure out how to turn on this notification light I've noticed on the top...
Ohhh noooo...noooo
Thanks! Just trying to give the non-power user viewpoint.
Im 5 hours in and I dig it.
Almost identical to the 5x,...so not great compared to some phones, but if you were used to the 5x, you will be fine.

The 5x definitely does low light better but the camera on the X4 is just fine.
Im 5 hours into owning the X4 and Im very happy. I had a bootlooping 5x too...
Me too. In red.
Holy shit yes Im keeping the X4!  Fuck this thing is great! I have no issues so far. 
lol! Because we all know growing the stash is the fun part lol
Shit...I literally just shaved off a huge mustache this morning...
I live 5 miles from Downtown Boston. Im lucky if people acknowledge my existence never mind a high five lol

Ugh...
But what is available and not being used by System?
I've seen two unboxing videos and one showed 13 gigs being used by System and one with 15 gigs being used. Fucking blows if true.
So really only 15 gigs of onboard storage? Have you installed an SD card? Does it help?
That sucks.
Thanks!

Yup, mine will be here tomorrow they say.

Its got a better battery life than the 5x, doesn't have much shitty Moto bloatware and its water resistant.

Not happy about the camera review, but im not too upset.
Thanks! I went the first two years the Sox had a Dead night, but missed this past year. Always a great night!
Thats a much nicer review than this one lol http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/10/19/moto-x4-android-one-edition-review-not-moto-x-youre-looking/

Thanks!
Thank you for that. I'm not too bummed out by that review. The shit he hates is crap I don't care about. Its getting a case, so who cares about fingerprints. Its faster than the 5x. Its going to be an improvement no matter what.

> As mediocre as the performance has been, the battery life has been the exact opposite. It's substantially above average, at least for me.

Fuck the missing bluetooth and and other Moto software bloatware too. I dont want it anyways. My #1 thing is battery life and from what Im reading, I might finally have a phone I wont have to charge half way through the day.
Oh I know!

https://i.imgur.com/da4cUif.jpg
I think its just software...but we wont know until tomorrow I guess.

From what I have read, the differences are in the Android One version: 

No multi speaker bluetooth

No Amazon Alex

No FM Radio

Ive got your fix! Turn on "On-body detection" and the screen will now unlock when you say Ok Google.  Just stumbled on this the other day. Works great, but it is a security issue. But I also have my Garmin set up as a Smart Unlock device, so it should lock if its not near my watch.
3 more days until the BAA Half! Been training for 8 months for this! 

The last race in the BAA Triple Medley. The BAA is most known for The Boston Marathon, but they also run smaller distance races. I ran in the 5k, 10k and the Half finishes it off for the year. I cant wait!

I had a day one 5x that bootlooped yesterday.
Right here https://i.imgur.com/Lqw2h1W.jpg
I took the plunge yesterday and bought the X4. My Day One 5x turned off during my morning walk and stayed off for most of the day, then suddenly turned on. Im not waiting around for it to totally die and bought the x4.

Looks like a decent phone, its not a huge hardware change from the 5x it seems.  Its been awhile since Ive owned a Motorola...since the Razr 3 lol
**Jazz Hands**
My day is half over by the time morning shows come on.
Just ordered my x4. Im on Fi and had the 5x at launch. It started randomly rebooting today...Im not playing that game. So I ordered the x4.

I am four years tobacco free after smoking for 25+ years. 

I was 43, 320 pounds in full denial mode. I had weaned myself down to two to three smokes a day because I had new baby and told my wife I had quit. Id smoke one when I got to work, lunch and just before I left for home. I wouldn't smoke on the weekends because I was around my wife and I "didn't want her to know"...guess what? smoke stinks, she knew. But every fucking weekend was the same. By Sunday night I was a pissed off wreck because I would go through 48 hours of withdrawal just so I could light one up first thing Monday morning. I fucking did this for three fucking years. I am a moron.

It all came to a head when we booked a family Disney trip. I found myself trying to figure out how many disposable vape pens I would need for the trip, then I realized that people can average 8-10 miles a day walking around the park. I was fat and about to ruin a very expensive trip with my family because I **wouldnt** control my addiction.

Long ass story short, three months before the trip I finally quit smoking and started walking every day. Since then I lost 75+ pounds and I still regularly run 25+ miles a week.

Fuck smoking. Im still pissed at all the time I wasted on that shit.
Contrary to popular belief not EVERYONE in the entertainment industry is a narcissist 
Fuck that guy who fell. No sense of humor. 
I can tell you from experience what happened. That is a piece of shit treadmill and the belt slipped while he was running. 

What happens is when you are running on the treadmill, you foot hits the belt with a force opposite of the direction the belt is traveling in.  On a good treadmill, the belt will resist this force and continue to rotate, but a POS treadmill like that one, when your foot comes down on the belt, the force is not counteracted and it sometimes slips forward. It feels EXACTLY like slipping on ice...except a moment later the belt catches up and starts spinning the original direction again basically throwing you off the treadmill. It doesn't happen every time so its really hard to guess when its going to happen.
Everyday is shorts day if you want it...
Congrats! I ran my first half three years ago at 44. I wept like a child at the finish because I was so relieved that I even finished. It was an amazing feeling.

Good luck, you CAN do it.
Ran my fastest mile during a 5k this weekend! I have a half marathon (my third) I'm training for in a couple weeks and decided to run in a 5k as fast as I could just to see how the training is working if I pushed myself. Loved seeing all the new records pop up at the finish! what a great feeling. And to think, three years ago I was way over 300 pounds and had not run since high school. 

I love running!!!!!

I worked in radio for many years. What I found even worse were the guys who never turned it off. I definitely had my own "radio voice" that I automatically switch into as soon as a mic is near, but as soon as Im off air I speak normally. these guys talk in that DJ-y voice all the time. Drove me crazy. Hated driving to remotes with them.

Well there isn't parking lot to party in, so the area outside the Garden will be busy, but not too crazy because the Garden is above South Station, a working train station. The cops will keep people moving.

Not sure what it will be like...
There are TONS of tix available for Boston, no floor, but everything else
Babe the pig? No idea
Nice! See you there!!!
Relax :) Pre sale is a very limited number of tix. Keep checking, tickets may pop up if you keep checking. If not you probably will be able to score via the regular sale
It depends on the bar. Some are 2am, & some are earlier! Boston has all sorts of fucked up licensing rules. Best to check when you walk in the door.
Sec 329, row 1 checking in!
Riding the rail!!!! ...from the balcony
Sec 329, row 1 checking in!

Riding the rail!!!! ...from the balcony :)
Yeah since there isn't a lot to gather in it leaves the bars, and those bars are packed a normal weekend night.  As we get closer there should be more info.

Remember /u/djbillyfraziereven if even if a bar says they are open until 1am, that sometimes means the door is closed about midnight and everyone needs to GTFO before 1am. 
Try again. I just tried and I see lots of seats available
Thats some bullshit.

Id STILL be driving that fucking monster if it didn't get rear ended.
Im lucky that the BAA is my local race organizer. Ive raced in their 5k & 10k too, cant wait for the half! They have the 5k two days before The Marathon so you get to cross the real finish line, it was quite amazing. Found a picture of me crossing the finish line. Im the guy in red to the far right and that's a stealie headband too! https://i.imgur.com/oOtJxeU.jpg

The Marathon is a little out of my reach, Ill never qualify...also Ive never run the distance...someday...Im 47 and I only started running three years ago. Its been quite the life change :) 
Buffalo Tom!!!
Oh I keep forgetting to ask where you got yours made and how much?
BAA Half in Boston!  http://www.baa.org/races/half-marathon.aspx

Sunday, October 8, 8:00 a.m.

It will be my third half, but first time running this particular race.
I seem to have found a niche in the market! ....who am I kidding...I'm to lazy to print my own...
Sweeeeet! I guess I'll just have to suck it up and make mine own for my half in October!
TM doesn't sell the VIP packages. CID does. Yes you can buy two packages at a time I think.

Oh and I dont see the Floor in the Garden being set up as GA, but who knows, this will be my first time seeing Dead & CO indoors :)
Help On The Way :)

You will get this "joke" in a few months if all goes well


Whoohoo! My third dead show ever! Loved it! Hell of a weekend.
I think the first night of Fenway was close to sold out two years ago, but tix were available for all 4 nights from the box office day of show. The Garden will sell out, but Ill bet you will be able to get tix within a day...I hope :)

The issue I see is size and number of nights.  The Garden capacity is 17,565 and Fenway on a concert night holds 37,731. So the Garden is half the size (sorta) and there is only one night...

Good luck!!!
Please don't be related to me... please don't be related....whew
Its really good!  Here are some reasons why:

1) Geoff Tate's does a set

2) Its like a long DLMinis but clearly recorded

3) He does a Last Man Stanton with the crowd and Geoff's brother plays

4) Feeding Ducks!

5) Hidden Bonus track 
Love that! But I just want a good Dead running shirt. No cotton. Is that so hard?
We need a badge, like the Boy Scouts! 
Isnt it snowing already?
I can only find VIP prices so far. 

VIP is $229 to $699 per ticket
I know, when I saw Boston was a Friday I was so psyched. 
Yup, Ive did Fenway all four nights over the last two years. no way im missing a Garden show! Its less than five miles from my house! I can't wait!

Ran my first half marathon cranking this
Bullshit.
First run with my new Garmin 230 and the HR strap. Loved it! Ended up being a slow run for me, but thats ok, now all my PR are easily broken lol.

Man, dont know why I stuck with the Fitbit Surge for so long.
And I have a guy who live near me that has Chemtrail posters all over his truck. WTF?
Im about a quarter through and I can tell its going to be a good one.

Does it sound like Chinese Folk music? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5o6z91n5VeI

It maybe someone performing/practicing Tai Chi. I used to hear it really early in the morning, like 4am until 6am for a long time. I finally got up and looked for it and found three old women doing Tai Chi with flute music CRANKING out of a small PA system in a small park near my place. I cant believe any of the neighbors didnt complain, it was VERY loud.
Ahhh, the good old "GTFO"

Ill be running towards the flash thank you very much.
Up until the google search I just did on Donavon Frankenreiter, I had no idea he was a surfer first. Totally only knew him as a musician lol.

Ooooooh shit!  At my wedding my friends freshly ArmorAll-ed 69 GTO Red Convertible was driving us away and I said the same words "Punch it" and he did. Somehow I grabbed my wife as she started flying off the back of the car and I jammed my leg into the back seat. It was one of those moments you realize how close you came to shit going south real quick.

If you have ever been to a live concert, you have heard the Wall of Sound's children, that's for sure. The WoS was a major breakthrough in loudspeaker technology and many of the modern ideas and concepts for live sound came from it. The Dead may not have perfected live sound but they certainly got the ball rolling.


Ok, done. What now?

Cheapest beer around too.
And I also will be there in Dec! Sprung for the Royal Guest Room too :) 

Most of the Dining is booked. Looking forward to Oct for FastPass reservations!
What's Dean' track record in predicting this stuff? I remember people giving him shit about the 50th predictions. Did anything come to fruition? 
Sorry my man. Saw The Grateful Dead 8 times. JGB 5. And let me tell you the current configuration is smoking. 

You can think whatever you want but if you have any interest in the Dead at all, you are currently missing out on the Dead's renaissance. Get back on the bus.

Open the doors at 420pm, live band before the show, you get a parking lot party the whole night. Its a good time! Plus its my birthday!!!
I can't afford it! lol!

I always heard that but fuck as soon as I turned 40, losing weight wasnt just having a salad a couple meals any more. I cant imagine the shape I would have been in if I exercised as much as I do now in the 90's
Death is also the leading cause of death.
DSO!!!!  Whoohoo!

I started going back to Dead shows about 8 years ago. After discovering the Dead in the 80's, I shunned then in the 90's to 2000. I just didn't dig the scene and the Alt rock/Punk scene was so much more fun at the time. But as I got older, I wasn't having fun at punk shows any more. I caught the Dead playing locally 8 years ago just for fun and I was blown away how cool the scene was again and how fun the shows were. SInce then I go to all the Dead related shows in the area. Saw Dead & Co 4 times at Fenway, DSO many times, Ratdog, Phil & Friends down in NYC..... Its been great! Funny how things change but stay the same.
My guitar(s) and bass are hanging neatly on my wall.....mocking me every time I walk past...
New Runner here! Well not so new anymore, but I picked up running three years ago at 43 after losing 70+ pounds. Talk about a life changing thing! Ran my first half marathon last year in May and ran two more since then. I have to say I've fallen in love with running!

But you are more adventurous than me, I will never do trail running or anything like that. I ran on the beach for the first time and f-ed up my ankle. Id know Id kill myself if I trail ran.
Yes?

I visited MD once 7 years ago and Old Bay cans keep showing up magically in my cabinets. WTF guys?

I was there. Hot as fuck both nights. Almost as hot as the Dylan & Dead shows in 87'

These days, most of the time I stream the Dead Fantasy podcast. They make fantasy set lists from SB & aud tapes, and edit them together into 2 & 3 set shows. Some have themes but some are just damn good shows. Ep 11 is the hands down best one IMO


Corporate AV!!!!!!! 

\m/ 

I know it.

Did live sound in the 90's. Picked up HTML, started a web design company, went bankrupt when the bubble burst in 2000ish and swore Id never put myself in a position like that again. found the safest job I could find doing AV in a huge corporation and dug myself out.

I run the show now. Other than tweaking my ClearOne(s), I don't do much audio engineering these days, but still tinker. 
Took a week off from running because I sprained my ankle beach running over vacation. Ran my normal 10k this morning and it feels like I haven't run for a month. Wow, feel totally out of shape....looking forward to Saturday's run :)
You owe me $6,000

I used to mock headband wearers...until I wore one last summer. I'm a year round headband convert now. It doesn't feel like running if I dont have a headband on now. I own 20 at least and they are all obnoxious looking.
Im 46 and I've never eaten Taco Bell.

**EDIT: Why am I getting downvoted for the lack of Taco Bells in the area? It not a health choice, assholes. There are none around**
Im like 5 miles away from there...yes it is.

I had to check we were still on reddit.....
Its a funny story...
Good! I was on vacation, heard the mini about pulling it and immediately DLed it. 

When I listened to it, I was surprised how listenable it is. I mean I listen to DLMinis religiously and his shitty phone audio recording from stand up shows and movie interruptions and enjoy that.  That should be your line in the sand. If it sounds like a DLMinis phone recording or worse, cut it.

So basically Im saying Doug made me work on my vacation.

Yeah I bartended for 8 years in providence in the 90's. We most definitely had happy hour specials.
I get the same alert that bot gets for any earthquake above 6.0 in the United States. 

I think maybe a lot of people noticed there wasn't an earthquake in Santa Barbara since it was still standing.

Trust me, I googled the shit out of that alert when it first showed up.
Really early 
And The Dead were playing Fenway Saturday and Sunday. That's another 40,000+ people in the city. Was wasn't that bad to be honest. Traffic on any day in February is is way worse than it was this weekend.
I've only seen them at shows!
They were selling them in most of the official merch tables at the Fenway shows. No idea if they sell them anywhere else.
Yeah I was hoping there would be a video link to Saturdays fenway show....Any help?

Yes, that is an official Dead & Co product. No sticker, but a Pop Socket...Still confused...


Went solo both nights and never felt alone for a moment. Somehow worked my way up from the worst seats in the house to dead center private suites both nights. I'm still in shock I was able to walk past security two nights in a row. Hands down the best weekend I've had in years. Thank you everyone!!!
Holy cow! What an amazing two nights! Everyone way so great! I was solo both nights and I never felt alone. God it was good! 
What a fucking night. I cant even begin to say how fucking good tonight was.

I felt that place levitate.

Talk of the Town is gone, I haven't been to the new place yet.
FYI They just postponed the Parade until 10am


The just postponed the Parade until 10am!!!
lol Its like walking through a cloud in Winthrop. Good luck out there

That is just Rhode Island in general :)
Boston local here! This is very good info. Good luck everyone!
I was there! Hot as fuck and a weed shortage!
Man I can't say! But I would hope they sent them already. I do know the envelope they come in is very plain and could be misconstrued as junk mail. I would just talk your ticket vendor ASAP, they may be able to reissue you tickets and you could pick them up at will call. Good luck

Amen.
Thats awesome! Sorry its raining. Find a bar and hunker down!

When you get to Fenway ask where Yawkey Way is. You can enter the park from there btw. It is a city street that Fenway takes over for games and concerts. Its the outdoor part of the park. You can see all the banners and there is food and drink that they only serve on Yawkey Way and not in the park. And that is where most of the madness during the show will be happening lol.

Once inside, you cannot walk totally around the park. Its a big U shape under the stands. It goes from the Third base line/Green Monster side to to the Bleachers. Each area has its own foods and beers. Personally I like the selection under the bleachers best. Most options.  https://www.reddit.com/r/gratefuldead/comments/6h0ewi/fenway_thread/

And the Yankees Suck  :)

Enjoy the show and the city! Give me a shout if you have any questions.
I might actually be able to make it now.
LOL! You are very kind I would have told me to fuck off lol.

Man, the mods are just Heads like you or I. I have no special connection to the band other that they may actually be in the same city as me right now...kinda odd to think about actually... anyways, wanna be a mod?
That's more of a statement than a question....

**Bar suggestions:**

Within a block of Fenway there are TONS of places to go. It depends on what you want. It Ranges from super high end to bars that will stink of puke!

http://thelowerdepths.com/ Dive - Tons of beer, no food CASH ONLY

https://www.easternstandardboston.com/ High end, but you can walk in wearing anything. they don't care as long as you can pay lol. Great food and REALLY amazing mixed drinks. Also outdoor seating

http://casknflagon.com/ THE Red Sox bar

http://www.bleacherbarboston.com/home Cool bar inside the walls of the park. When the Sox are playing you can actually watch the game without a ticket. But the Dead's stage is in front of the bar so I dont know what the view will be lol

http://thorntonsfenwaygrille.com/ Local bar, solid food and beer. Nothing too crazy, just a good bar.

http://baseballtavern.com/ Bud Lights and fights :) If thats your thing...

**Also in other boston bullshit that is important to know:**
Last Call for Alcohol. Most places close at 1am and when I mean close, you are out the door and they are locked up by 1am. Some are open until 2am but very few. Typically around midnight you will start to see signs of closing. And some places wont say shit, gladly sell you a drink and then tell you to get the fuck out. So if its getting late, you might want to ask when they stop serving.
Last train is at midnight. Its total bullshit. Maybe even earlier. You could get put on a bus without warning at night. Should not be an issue. Its an express to whatever T stop you were planning on getting off at, but it still sucks.
No Booze on Sundays until noon! So plan accordingly :) Some brunch places will serve before noon on Sunday, but some wont...just a warning.
did you turn it off and back on again?
Both nights!

Up to the top!
Correct! You are still almost two miles away from the viewing area.
I would not dilly nor dally this evening :)

Hey, actual video production guy here. that is 100% just plain old video feedback.

Its "reverse" due totally to John standing in front of the screen and the angle of the camera to the screen. It is not a digital effect per say, its not a button anyone pressed to get that effect, its an artifact. Im not saying they didnt do it intentionally, but the only reason John has it behind him is angle between the camera and the screen. No one else on stange has that exact angle, so it doesn't happen.

As an example you can actually see the video feedback in being drawn on the screen in real time in this clip https://youtu.be/6M-zevfzXBU?t=10m23s See how John is only on the screen once and more of him show up after when the camera switches to him? You are seeing the actual latency in the signal flow. Each version of John showing up is exactly how long the camera's image takes to get processed and shown on the screen. If it was a digital effect, the "rainbow" of john would show up instantly and not be drawn on the screen since the processing would be done by the DSP and not by naturally feeding back.

Hope that makes sense. If you have any questions let me know, I can go into a lot more detail :)
You are a good person :)
Or he thought the cop has snacks
I don't think yo will have any issue finding tickets. There are tons around
Yeah they need to burry him in the mix... ouch!
Sweeeeeet news on this hot night

I dont remember having too much of hassle last year...not more than normal Fenway clusterfuck-ness lol. I got in as the first song started night one and night two I got there at like 4pm and just relaxed.

Yes you should be able to email them without issue.

NOT HEADPHONES!!!! Those are kids ear protectors. Its like small versions of the things construction works use. Way better than trying to jam earplugs in their ears.

Lol asking the questions that matter! My fav is a dive called  [Thornton’s Fenway Grille](http://thorntonsfenwaygrille.com/). Its my go to brunch and its about a block away in a nice neighborhood.
Nice! I cant believe its already here! 

**Im a local going to both shows, if anyone has any questions please let me know!!!**

If you are in Boston on Saturday looking for something to do, [the Tall Ships will be on parade](http://www.sailboston.com/)! It will be hard to see from the city but its worth checking out. Also it will be totally over way before showtime.

If I was going to try to see the boats and I was from out of town, Id use these guys https://ticketing.bostonharborcruises.com/webstore/shop/viewItems.aspx?cg=EXCR&c=GIGIJPMU17SB $75 round trip to one of the Harbor Islands where there are bathrooms and shelter and lunch is provided. But there are tons of ways to see them that is free, you just gotta poke around :)

I removed this thread because of the tickets barcode showing. If you have any issues, contact me or any other mod. Thanks!
Sure, shouldn't be an issue. Inside the show is totally safe if you do the normal parental due diligence...BUT if you don't protect your kids ears I'm going to be pissed

Buy these. My kid loves seeing me pull them out because she knows we are going to a show, she is 7 btw and been going to shows with me for years :) https://www.amazon.com/Snug-Sound-Earmuffs-Hearing-Protectors/dp/B00CBDJ84S/

Lansdowne will officially be closed to traffic! That will be nice not to dodge cars...
My house 2000 feet from the runway. My house shakes all day every day....but that is also why I can afford it.
If you are planning on viewing from Winthrop/Deer Island, the are MAJOR changes to Winthrop's public Transportation for the day. You cannot "just drive there" like normal.

All buses are canceled. All traffic is blocked from entering Shirley st, the only way to get to Deer Island, so you have to walk or take a shuttle.

And once you get to Deer Island, there will be a security check before you get to the Island and you will still have a mile+ walk out to the viewing areas. They are banning LOTS of things, so check the list first https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kukbjGEx_ivllCBgsbVnVl0BNNaJQcdD-B8GH1VR1dg

Deer Island is a bad idea.

Traffic is stopped at Shirley St, about three miles from the viewing area, so you cant drive. Normal Busses have all been canceled, so Winthrop is running shuttles to Deer Island from Winthrop Center, but I heard its only school busses, not MBTA. That means handicapped access might be an issue. If you are really interested, I can call a guy I know and get 100% correct info. 

ANd even if you get a shuttle out to Deer Island, get through all the security, it's a mile and a half out to the viewing area.

Yeah baby!
The islands are the best place to see the ships, but you need to buy special packages to get to the islands. No idea If they are sold out or not.

Whoohoo! Rhode Island!

And as someone from Rhode Island, this is a non story. Clamshells are commonly used as a cheap replacement for stone driveways. 
Rhode island. Lots of clams for chowder processed there and the by product is shells. Lots of houses have clamshell driveways. It's very common because it's cheap.
