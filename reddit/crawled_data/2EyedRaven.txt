Dirty Unicorns is a Custom ROM.

Google Camera apk I'm using is 5.1.018 by Arnova. Includes HDR+ and Portrait Mode on both front and rear camera.

The Redmi Note 4 is the best purchase I've ever made. 

MIUI is hot garbage for me, but this hardware + Custom ROM is perfect for my needs. Dirty Unicorns + Product Sans + modded Google Camera apk = Poor man's Pixel.

I don't understand the advantage of treble for a Custom ROM though. I mean, we got Oreo ROMs 2-3 days after Google released it. So 🤷‍♂️
Umm, you kidding, right? I distinctly remember expanding notifications with a single finger swipe as far back as ICS!

You're probably thinking of notification bundling, which isn't what people are talking about here. They're talking about expanding notifications - like Gmail notification showing a preview to expanding it to show the whole email.

There is another dirty workaround. If you want, you can follow this:

I assume you want to drag the tiles that are at the bottom to the QS. What you should do is, drag the tiles that are at the top few rows first and add them, until the one you want to add is no longer at the bottom and is reasonably close to the Quick Settings. Now you can add it without any issue. Afterwards, just remove all the ones you added that you don't need.

What irks me about Action Launcher is the Pro upgrade is an IAP as opposed to a separate unlocker app through Play Store.

So once you buy it, you can't refund it if you didn't like it. And as far as I know, there is no "Trial" mode in Action Launcher, so you can't even try out the pro features first.

The funny part is, there's a glitch where even some male wrestlers say this.

I was watching a Career video by Chris Denker. He had career invasion thing enabled, so CAW of other people show up in his career. 

His CAW is roaming backstage doing some deep philosophical thinking when he sees this buff looking CAW with the name "****4BRAINS" (The game censored it). So Chris goes and presses X for talking.

****4BRAINS first says the usual intro line "I'm going to take down the WWE. You're either with me or you're against me" and then he drops this Steph line. Chris starts laughing like that Chocolate Drop video.

Well said. There's a bit in one of Jericho's books. In one of his feuds, he insults his opponent in a promo, calling him old or something. So the other guy calls him aside and explains to Jericho how it's not useful to make your opponent look like a nobody. 

He says, by calling him old, Jericho has written himself into a corner. If Jericho beats him, it's no big deal, because he just beat up an old man. If Jericho loses, well, he just got beat up by an old man. It's a lose-lose situation.

> import tax credit which form has to be filled? i will read more about it then 

It is "Input Tax Credit". Basically, you can get credit for taxes you paid on your purchases. ITC is basically "Tax on Sales - Tax on Purchases."

You do not need to fill up a separate form to get ITC. It is all automatic. You just have to make sure you file GSTR 1, 2 and 3. Also make sure the person you purchase the goods from mentions your GSTIN in his GSTR 1 under B2B. Govt will compare his GSTR1 (his sales) and your GSTR 2 (your purchases) to figure out that you have purchased goods from him and already paid tax to him. So that amount will be automatically available to you as credit at the time of your GST Payment. 

You can check this for more info: https://cleartax.in/s/gst-input-tax-credit

ClearTax is a life saver!!
2. Yes B2C Small. 

4. It is easy, but the difficulty is due to the amount of work. You have to mention each and every invoice in case of BTB! So if you have the time, you can do it yourself. If you don't, you can contact a CA. He'll get it done easily. 

If you want to and can do it yourself, just go to gst.gov.in. Then select "Downloads" and then "Offline Tool" and then "Returns Offline Tool". It will download an excel file. You can fill that excel file and upload it to submit your GSTR1 return. Just download it once and see. 
Sorry for the late reply. I have only been an article trainee for 1 month now, so I don't have much knowledge. No doubt you can get better answers from more qualified persons. I'll answer to the best extent I can. 

1. I'm not sure about that. 

2. BTB invoices and BTC (Large) i.e. B2C invoices over 2,50,000 value and BTC (Small), B2C invoices below ₹2,50,000/-. What is your question here? I didn't get you. 

3. It is ₹100 per day per act i.e. CGST Act and SGST Act. So ₹200 per day till the date you file the return.

4. Yes, you can get credit of IGST (but not Basic Customs Duty)

Also, keep in mind, as you're selling through E-commerce, you also have to mention GSTIN of E commerce seller in GSTR 1. 
No, it pins it to the top. So choose any app even if it's down below and it will pin it to the top.

Well, if you want to get credit you have to make sure your supplier has your GSTIN and he mentions your GSTIN in his GSTR1. 
Yeah, my bad. I spoke assuming a case where there is only one Place of Supply and rate of tax, but you're right. 
A1 will be perfect. Cheap in price because that's Xiaomi and it has stock android and is supposed to have faster updates. Camera is also good according to reviewers. 

But, it is above your price range, but if you can go above, then do it! 

But at that point, you can get the Redmi Note 4 (3/32 or 4/64 version) itself, which is cheaper. Just weaker camera and MIUI instead of stock android.
I would personally suggest Redmi 4 over Redmi 4A. 

Redmi 4 is a smaller (5 inch) and cheaper version of the Redmi Note 4 (5.5 inch). 

Redmi 4A is an entry level model, no fingerprint, less powerful processor. 
Sorry, I just joined a month ago and GST was already in full force by then. So don't know if business increased and by how much. But they're probably making good ₹₹$$₹₹ what with 3 returns per business per month. 
Then you don't have to mention their GST number, simply because end consumers aren't registered. 

Basically, the GSTR 1 has separate sections. 

One is BTB - Business to Business, here you have to provide invoice wise details and GST number of the dealer you sold it to.

Another section is BTC - Business to Consumer. The situation you mentioned comes into play here. In the BTC section, you do not have to give invoice wise details. You can just club the total turnover and mention it in a single line! This is because it doesn't ask for invoice number. Just Place of Supply, Rate of Tax, assesable value and tax. 

Whereas in BTB, the return asks for GST number, invoice number, place of Supply, date, invoice value, assesable value, rate of tax and tax amount (and soon they'll probably start asking your date of birth, place of birth, your mother's maiden name, how many times you took a shit on a Thursday afternoon)

TL; DR If you sell stuff to end consumer, you have to club the total sales made to end consumer and show it in one line. You don't have to provide GST number (because it doesn't exist) or even the invoice numbers. 
> Actually it's been extended to October 10. 

No, it was extended to September 10. The original due date was September 5. Then it got extended to September 10 and now again got extended to October 10.
Not a business owner, I'm an article trainee in a CA Firm, and I have been filing GST Returns of few companies.

Basically, you have to file 3 returns every month. GSTR-1,2,3.

In GSTR 1 you have to give details of your outward supplies aka Sales. And the details have to be invoice wise.

So you have to mention each and every invoice number, the invoice value, the assessable value (net of tax amount), the CGST and SGST contained in that invoice. You also have to mention the GST number of the dealer you sold it to. 

3 returns per month and so many details to fill, will a business do business or just file these returns? On top of that, the GST website is like the IRCTC Website. You enter these details and most of the time, the website doesn't even reflect it. No wonder the due dates keep getting extended.

We argued that if the film is for adults, then why have so many cuts. They didn't bother much and continued to explain each cut and their logic behind it. In the middle of that, a lady officer turned to me and said, '**Aap aurat hokar aisi filmein kaise bana sakti hain'. And before I could speak up, a man in the committee said, 'But she is not a woman.

The problem is not that people don't understand the passage of time, the problem is how certain characters can travel at different speed through time. 

The Ironborn and the Dornish left at the same time as the Unsullied. Euron intercepted Yara's fleet, captured her, took her to Kings Landing and stayed there for an hour or so and still had time to intercept the Unsullied at Casterly Rock?
> We'll find out in the next episode if Euron shows up in Casterly Rock

They showed The Silence being there at Casterly Rock.
Except that Euron was at both the places (Ironborn-Dorne and Casterly Rock) with his ship?
Calm the fuck down and maybe you can explain how Euron was able to intercept Ironborn and the Dornish, capture them, take them to Kings Landing, stay there for a while and then return to surround the Unsullied at Casterly Rock, when the Unsullied and the Ironborn HAD BEGUN THEIR JOURNEY AT THE SAME TIME?
Which is ironic, considering the Unsullied can't impregnate anyone.

His comment was valid. He said MIUI takes ages to implement stock android features and so MIUI updates are just UI updates. You were the one who said Stock Android takes ages to implement OEM features, which is a downright retarded thing to say because

1) Stock Android updates actually update the Android version AND APIs. You know, the thing that matters. 

2) MIUI takes even longer to get stock android features. 
Yes, they accidentally wrote several lines of code and they accidentally pushed out the update. Oops. 
It was you who said Stock Android took ages to implement OEM Features. And I said MIUI took even longer. So stop fucking moving the goalposts. 
Except the fact that the so-called features that Stock Android took so long to implement is still not implemented in MIUI.

Your stupidity is annoying dude. 
The problem is it's either Xiaomi fanboys downvoting and/or the people who have never used MIUI. Those people think MIUI is some sacred shit because of the tons of MIUI fanboy comments.

Having a man killed vs having hundreds of people killed at a wedding,  and flooding a mine so that an entire House, with men, women and children hiding in the mine will drown and die. (Reynes of Castamere) , etc.

Both are cruel, but Tyrion's cruelty is nothing compared to Twyin. 
That's the beauty of ASOIAF/GoT!

Tywin despised Tyrion, couldn't believe Tyrion was his son, but in reality Tyrion was the one most like Tywin (well, minus the cruel stuff).

Cersei thought she was being held back because she is a woman, and considered herself to be the true daughter of Tywin. She thinks she is clever just like her father, but that couldn't be farther from the truth. 

Jaime didn't want to be like Tywin, didn't want to rule or shit. All he wanted to do was what he was pretty damn good at - fighting. But he loses his hand, Tywin is kill, Tyrion is somewhere in Meereen, so now he has to get into Tywin's role and he is pretty damn good at it.

So you're coming from OxygenOS? I've used MIUI, so let me tell you it's shortcomings compared to Stock Android (but whenever I do this, I get downvoted by the fanboys here.)

You can't even expand notifications with a single finger swipe. You HAVE to use two finger swipe to do it. 

If there's notifications on the Lockscreen, and you unlock the phone and lock again, the notifications are gone. 

Despite being on Nougat, it doesn't have DPI changing, Split Screen, double tap to go to last app, etc

Talking of bloat, it has an app called "Security". It's basically CleanMaster clone. 

Enabling permissions for apps from Settings>Apps isn't enough. You have to enable it in the Security app, too. 

Oh, and if you use an app that needs accessibility permission, then you have to keep re-enabling the permission regularly because MIUI quietly disables it. 

And many more small quirks that you will probably notice. 

---

I am not trying to stop you from flashing MIUI obviously, I just gave you my experience. 
That optimisation shit is the worst. MIUI is very aggressive in killing apps to save battery - even on a 4100 mAh battery.

No, you're completely wrong.

It's inverted IF you use it the correct way. Basically, if you record a video in landscape the correct way i.e. top of the phone goes to left and bottom of the phone goes to right, the resultant audio is inverted. Top microphone audio outputs to right and botttom to left. 

>Everything looks and sounds okay when the bottom of the phone is oriented to the left side for landscape mode, but not on the right side. The device’s microphones, which are oriented on the top and bottom of the phone, seem to retain their channel assignments and while the resulting recording does output in stereo, what’s left is right and right is left.

Or an easier explanation from the OP (Not the company, the OP of the thread)

> The phone has a microphone on the top and bottom. When filming sideways, stereo sound can be obtained, but it's inverted.
> and this was never an issue until today.

Do you mean you're experiencing this issue from today?
Everyone is hating on OnePlus, but I think this is revolutionary.

They put the screen and audio upside down so that it would be unsettling to the user. 

Unsettling = Never Settle. GENIUS! Checkmate, Apple!
Yeah, but just 2600 mAh battery. I hope this is false and it actually has at least 3000+

>I really hope that that annoying tiles bug now has been fixed that caused the inability to drag certain tiles up into the quick tiles area

That's a bug on all Nougat Custom ROMs.

Workaround is to either decrease your Display Size. Or you can increase the QS Tiles rows and columns. I use 5x5 because it's better than the default 3x3. 

But I think LOS doesn't allow changing QS Tiles rows and columns. :/
Exactly! He's just taking a M vs N complaint and using it to say Stock Android notification sucks and so MIUI is better. Such a gross misunderstanding of the actual situation. Which makes me doubt the conclusion he made from the ["surveys from hundreds of thousands of users".](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/6ktg55/xiaomi_miui_9_closed_beta_release_details/djr988p/) 
If I recall correctly, a toast notification appears asking to enable Documents app. But why on Earth it is disabled by default, that is the important question.
>My opinion is based on feedback from hundreds of thousands of people via surveys, NPS, message boards etc. I have personally met with thousands of MIUI users.

I highly doubt all of those "hundreds of thousands" of people said "Gee, matterwitu, you know what would be fun? If you remove single finger expand notifications gesture!" But you know what I see? Hundreds of threads on MIUI Forums complaining about the removal of this single finger gesture. Why fix what isn't broken?

> I don't really agree with this. If you're using it as an inbox **then expanding every notification as you scroll** by default is not the ideal behavior.

This is what you're not understanding (the part in bold). While scrolling with a single finger if you have a ton of notifications, does NOT expand the notifications. You have to specifically pull down with one finger on a particular notification to expand it. You can easily scroll with one finger through the tons of notifications without expanding it. 
You must probably be an enthusiast bro!!!1!1!!
Right?! This is the 76th time he has said this! 
It's probably because most here have never used MIUI. 
It's anecdotal stuff. Being tech savvy, I always get requests from elders for help. Probably the same happens to you too. 

First thing I notice is their notification drawer is full. It's either CleanMaster asking them to clear RAM, or some news app that has 10 articles in 10 separate notifications, because fuck Notification Bundling, apparently. 

> just because they're casuals, doesn't mean they're idiots

I completely agree. I've seen this sub always say "meh, non-enthusiasts will never notice this" and get frustrated at this argument. 

In this case, why would the casuals not prefer single finger swipe?!
Nope. 
Dude, they have a Clean Master clone app called "Security". You think they'd fix it?
System UI Tuner allows Status bar customization. Basically enable/disable icons from the Status Bar. You don't need Alarm icon? Remove it!
And we're called enthusiasts. 
Redmi 4 has Custom ROMs? Wouldn't surprise me. 

Even though Xiaomi are lazy as fuck at releasing kernel sources, the Custom ROMs are available because devs buy the phones as they're cheap.

> The notification icons are some coloured ones when they are supposed to be monochrome as on every other Android skin.

This. 

They for some stupid reason use app icons instead of activity icons. So downloading from Play Store shows the Play Store icon instead of the download icon. 
> It leads to feature bloat

BLOAT? In MIUI? Say it isn't so!
Well thought out and you've included everything that's wrong with MIUI. The parent commentor should read this. 

And I highly doubt you'll get a reply from matterwitu for this. 
Well fucking said. I can't believe the parent comment is the top comment. A lot of the complaints towards MIUI is valid and because of quirks like these. 

But like the parent comment, most of this sub classifies people that MIUI hate as "Hurr durr stock android fanboys"
> People who use their notification drawer as inboxes (generally not enthusiasts like us) prefer the current two finger swipe to expand.

I don't understand where you keep getting this from. The non-enthusiasts don't even know about notification drawer. They just let it be full with all the ads from games and CleanMaster crap. 

It's the "enthusiasts" as you call it who know and use the notification drawer. And they know the difference between single swipe and double finger swipe.

Moreover, Stock Android perfectly handles both ways. You can use it as an inbox in Stock Android as well. 

> Also worth noting that there have been a lot of changes in the stock Android behavior over the last 3 versions, so it's not like notifications are a "solved" problem.

Which means they're improving it constantly. Unlike MIUI, where it's been stagnant despite thousands of threads complaining about it in the MIUI Forums. 
That's the joke.
> made certain Pro features free.

Which features?!
186 upvotes, 0 comments.

Edit: Well, 1 comment now. 
Yeah, have you tried Plus?

Stock Telegram doesn't have few features that I like about Plus:

1. Swipe to reply. On Telegram, you have to tap on a message and then select "Reply". On Plus, you can just swipe left over the desired message and it automatically quotes it.

2. Tabs in the main screen. Telegram shows all the chats, groups, channels, bots, etc in one screen. Plus allows to have separate tabs so that groups have their own tab, channels have their own tab, etc. 

3. Check all the messages of a specific user in a group. On Plus, you can tap an user's avatar and hit "Show user messages" to see all the messages the user has ever posted in the group.

4. "Go to Message". On Telegram, if you find any specific link from Shared Media option, clicking on it directly opens the link. On Plus, there is "Go to Message" option so you can see who sent it and can see the context.

Well said. The RAM management, absolutely horrible notification system, the "Security" app. It's all shit. 
Text posts do give karma now. ;)
Which light theme do you use?
Most of the people in this sub don't like Custom ROMs/rooting, etc. 

So this "security patches aren't applied" thing caught on. 

But the thing is, even if Custom ROMs may not be applying security patches, at least I get to be on the latest Android version. If I was on the OEM ROM, I wouldn't get security patches either *AND* will be on an old Android version.
They want to rip you off *and* steal your data.

All the apps by this dev is expensive as fuck. 🤔
That ought to explain why Google apps on iOS are better than the Android ones. 
> P2 has bigger battery, fast charging, Amoled Screen

P2 has all of those going for it and also has better camera than the Redmi Note 4. It also has some dev support.

https://forum.xda-developers.com/lenovo-p2/development

Despite this, I went for the Redmi Note 4 because:

1. The Redmi Note 4 is cheaper than the P2.

2. In my country, there is no 64gb variant available. So even if I went for the 4GB variant, there was only 32GB Internal Storage. Redmi Note 4 had 4/64GB at a cheaper price. 

3. Warranty. Unlocking Bootloader and rooting doesn't void warranty of the Redmi Note 4!
Do you have the Snapdragon version? Because it's for the Snapdragon version, not Mediatek. 

LineageOS is pretty stable. Better than MIUI in performance, because apps stay in memory more as compared to MIUI. 

Camera is the weak point though, MIUI has better camera quality compared to Custom ROMs. Battery is more or less same in LineageOS as compared to MIUI.
G5 Plus camera sucks? G4 Plus had the best camera in that price segment. 

Also everyone here praised G5 Plus for having same camera sensor as the S7. 🤔
Actually, he said "Nuget", not "Nougat".

Checkmate, OnePlus haters!
I feel LineageOS 14.1 still doesn't have much customization. At least compared to CM13.

I'm talking about stuff like adding network speed indicator on the status bar, or at least changing number of rows/columns in the Quick Settings. I don't even need much customization. And with no theme engine (and no support for substratum) it seems even more barebones. 

That's why I'm using AICP now. AICP is basically LineageOS based but with some customization on top. (less than RR, which I feel is bloat-y) So I get the battery life and smoothness of LineageOS but also don't lose out on customization. 

 I think switching to Nougat and also with the whole controversy, the development speed (as far as porting CM13 features are concerned) obviously took a hit. 
Nope
What is this OP2 you speak of? OnePlus' first ever phone was OnePlus 3, man. 
If you buy the Pro Version then you can set it up to send it to cloud. 
You probably wiped Internal Storage too before flashing LineageOS. 
I know the dev. He's made AICP official too for this device.

Hey didn't you know Lenovorola is literally hitler???!!?
It's meh. You cannot even expand notifications with a single finger. You have to use two fingers for that. 

But battery and camera is better on that than Custom ROMs, so if you can live with the notifications thing, then you might stay on MIUI.

It doesn't lag or anything like Touchwiz. It's beautiful, only issue is the notification implementation. 
Thanks for talking to him. :)

> No that is not what I said. I didn't say they must not be pissed off at the writers. I said if that is genuinely how they feel they should stop watching. Difference. 

To which, I said being pissed off at the writers for one storyline doesn't mean people will stop watching the whole thing altogether. I can hate the Carmella stuff but love the AJ Styles-KO, Nakamura, Corbin storylines, etc. And if none of the storylines interest you, there's always half naked oiled men fighting each other to look forward to. 

>Let me ask you this. Do you think a majority of the people who hated the Ellsworth thing were still interested to see what Daniel Bryan would say about it on Tuesday? Enough to watch? If the answer is yes then WWE accomplished their goal by creating a story that got people emotionally invested. That's all there is to it.

But it's Daniel Bryan. If he came back and read instructions off the back of milk carton, people would be watching. 
Umm, that's the point of this sub. You watch wrestling, you discuss about it here. Simple as that. You don't want people to criticize it, then might as well shut the sub down. 
Remember GoT fans being mad at the writers for the Dorne plot? That's the equivalent of this.

Joffrey situation would be people being mad at Creative because of the Miz. Do you see people here being pissed off at writers for Miz attacking Dean Ambrose? Nope. Exactly why you don't see GoT fans being mad at writers because Joffrey is a cunt.
🤥👈
Exactly! People here seem not to understand the difference between being pissed at creative and being pissed at the heels. 

If you're pissed at the heels, only then you're getting "worked". Not when you're pissed at creative for making some weird as fuck decision.
People are not gonna stop watching just because they're angry at the writers for one or more storylines. This is not a normal TV show. This is wrestling. If they hate the writers for Roman, Bayley, Carmella storylines, then they love them for the Usos, New Day, AJ Styles, Miz, Nakamura, etc storylines. Even if not that, then people will at least watch for the actual wrestling. 

You're just focusing on the two extremes. You're saying "if they hated the writers, they'd stop watching, but they didn't, so they must not be pissed off at the writers" which is simply not true.
Here's where I think you're wrong with the "you're getting worked". 

It would be getting worked if he did exactly what the WWE wanted. But did WWE want people to be angry at the writers or Ellsworth & Carmella? Of course Ellsworth and Carmella.

But people aren't pissed off at them. They aren't like "REE FUCK YOU ELLSWORTH!" They're pissed off at the writers ("Of course WWE on one hand blabbers about women's revolution and on the other hand a man wins the first ever woman's MITB"). That's not being worked. 
Cena shit on AJ Styles too. 

"You're not on my level, punk. You're not even on the level below me".

He shits on his opponents, has a good match and *then* praises them the next week.
You got worked bro xDdddDdDDD

> just like a random pairing of any two main event singles stars are at a disadvantage against an experienced, well-oiled tag team

Remember that time when Reigns won a handicap match against The Club of all teams?
And then Bryan with the fake "Ohhhhh". Awesome! 
That's why I like him better than Shane on TS. Shane would have been just like "I understand why you did that. What was your gameplan for doing that?"
Ain't nobody breaking this redneck!
I felt the same at first but he's slowly won me over. 

On Talking Smack, he's had a lot of good lines. In the build-up to the Rumble, Taker had said he dug 29 holes for 29 souls. Corbin on Talking Smack? "Good, the world needs ditch diggers".

Jinder goes on and on about how nobody is out working him, etc. Corbin on Talking Smack? "Hard work is a crutch for people without talent. I don't need abs to punch him in the face". 

And his wrestling isn't bad either. That slide out thing he does when someone whips him towards the corner instead of the usual "Gee, let me go headbutt the ring post", his Deep Six and End of Days are superb.
How does this sub make a wrestler a promo? She isn't a "good promo", she "cuts good promos".

That's basically "Hatters gonna hat"

Are we gonna pretend as if he was some incredible wrestler who was being held back till now? He won the title only because WWE wants to expand into the Indian market. 
I love watching this sub bend over backwards trying to justify the Jinder reign. Like "wow he's so happy!!!1!!" or "He was fired and came back and now he's champion", pretending as if Jinder was being held back all this time and now finally won the title, while the reality is he's been handed the title even if he is utterly shit just because of the expansion.

Hi there, Vince!

CASH IN? CASH IN????

Umm, have you not been watching WWE these days?

That thing hasn't been scrapped. You can see the ref sweep his arm under the shoulders to see if the guy's shoulder is on the mat. 

Most of the time, he starts a count and immediately the wrestler gets his shoulder up while still being in the submission.
Holy shit would you look at that foreshadowing!

I just don't understand how they can fuck her up so bad. WWE loves doing the underdog thing, and Bayley could have been a perfect fit for the Bryan type story. Instead of winning the title at Fastlane, Charlotte could have retained by cheating and Bayley could have won the title at Wrestlemania. Not so hard, is it?

The problem is Dorne is one of those "What could have been great" storylines. One of the biggest reasons it's hated is because the book Dorne part is pretty good and the show part seems awful in comparison.

So Dorne hate is just "circlejerk" now? They murdered the Dorne plot and it deserves all the hate it gets.

Bezels aren't bad, guys (as long as they're not too big). Normal sized bezels do look good on a phone. 

Plus, bezels allow for front facing speakers and/or a fingerprint scanner on the front.

But nooooo, we like him because he's different (different/=good), because he's worked so hard (rest of the wrestlers sleep through the whole week) and he's so happy (the rest of them are like "Ugh man, I won a title. I am depressed). 
When is he supposed to be back?

I am sorry but I must go against this recommendation. 

The Alexa Bliss stock seems to be on an upward trend because "she's the best talker in WWE along with the Based Miz currently". A feud with Botcher Nia Jax will only further increase the stock's worth. 

My suggestion: BUY BUY BUY and do NOT sell until a "Am I the only one who hates Alexa Bliss" thread makes it to the front page.
Same here. I even switched ROMs because the ROM I was on (AEX) had problems with Magisk. 

Seriously, Magisk is AWESOME! Not only does it root the phone, but it also *hides* root and passes SafetyNet. Also has a bunch of modules that you can install systemless-ly.

Not only do you have to use "Full Unroot" option from SuperSU, you also have to flash the boot.img of your current ROM as well. This is because SuperSU also messes with your boot.img. 

You reflashed the ROM itself, thereby reflashing the boot.img and hence it worked.

95%? Try 105% 
Is that iYTBP or something?
Low Memory Killer.

> You fuckers all wanted an awesome stock android phone that has an unlockable bootloader and when a company finally gives it to you

Moto G/Moto Z/ Moto X

This Essential phone is doing nothing new by giving Stock Android and unlockable bootloader. But with Moto and Pixel, you get an headphone jack too.
Viper4Android does support 7.1 (hell, even 7.1.2). I've installed it through Magisk though. 
Yeah but installing it is a headache. 
I think he saw it coming. 
AdAway, Nova Launcher, Titanium Backup and Viper4Android for me. 

Viper4Android is siiiiick!
Expanding status bar gesture. Marshmallow onwards you need root to expand status bar properly. Without root, it does so in a slow motion.

>This is what I get from Google this morning:

>>Magisk Manager, com.topjohnwu.magisk, has been suspended and removed from Google Play as a policy strike because it violates the malicious behavior policy.

>What is the so-called "malicious behavior"? From what I've suspect, viewing the definition of malicious behavior, most likely I violated the two following policies:

>>* Apps that introduce or exploit security vulnerabilities.

>> * Apps or SDKs that download executable code, such as dex files or native code, from a source other than Google Play.

>For the first policy: Magisk bypasses Google's strict compatibility check - the CTS check on tampered devices (SafetyNet checks CTS status). CTS is what Google judge whether a manufacturer can ship a device with its Google services, so Google is definitely really serious about this issue. Also, Magisk roots your device, patches tons of SELinux policies (all rooting method do) etc, which is also an obvious security breach.

>However, I doubt this was the main reason, since many superuser management apps are also on the Play Store. The main reason should be the other one.

>The second rule I listed can be translated to: you cannot have anything "market-like" to let users download and run code on your device. **Apparently, Magisk's Online Repo is a complete violation against this rule.**

>Now I have two choices: Remove the online repo from Magisk Manager, and re-release a NEW APP on the store (yes, once your app is pulled down, the package name and app name is permanently banned).

>The other way is to simply just distribute the app through places like XDA and third-party markets (just like Xposed Installer).
I prefer the second decision, because I can still use the same package name, also I wouldn't need to remove the online repo feature, which is one of the most precious thing for a development community like XDA. What I really lost is the $25 dollars for Play Store registration lol.

>Development is definitely NOT suspended in any way, in fact, I had significant progress lately.

>There are still some bugs not sorted out, and I need some feedback from the users, so I decide to start a new thread for public beta testing!

>Expect the new thread to be live very soon, but I still need to do some small adjustments to deal with the unfortunate Play Store situation....

How do Reddit clients which are pulled down at least once when they hit puberty, don't have to change their app name?
The problem is not that it has been removed from the Play Store, the problem is that this might be the first step in Google screwing with Magisk. 

Google could maybe even stop Magisk from working by fixing whatever Magisk uses to bypass SafetyNet. 
Seriously, even unlocked bootloaders tripping SafetyNet is the worst part of this. 

Sure, root is harmful, but an unlocked bootloader is like an insurance policy. If an update went wrong and bricked your device, good luck fixing it if your bootloader is locked. 
Magisk Manager is and always has been available for download outside the Play Store as well.

http://tiny.cc/latestmanager (Link is from the Magisk XDA Thread OP)
I think the biggest advantage of using Magisk over SuperSU is, Magisk is open source. 
Because this is a sign of things to come. This means Magisk is in Google's radar now. Who's to say they won't figure out and "fix" it?
Scary thing would be if Google has the power to automatically uninstall the removed apps from the users' device as well. 
Fucking Google, if this is intentional then this is taking it too far.

There's a review here http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/31/aospa-review-back-dead-thrilled/
Get the dick out
Okay, that's actually awesome. That halo feature seems handy, hopefully it comes soon in the Nougat builds soon!

The per app DPI seems interesting. I use "Smallest" display size and that makes the Play Store believe it's a tablet. So, the reviews open as a pop up and only take like 40% of the screen. I'll love to set the Play Store to a normal DPI. 

Considering how these days all the ROMs are more or less the same and just differentiate themselves by sticking the settings under different heads, PA seems very exciting. 
Can anyone tell me why people love this ROM? Not trying to shit on it. I've never tried it and legitimately asking why it's supposedly so good. 
[AP posted a review](http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/31/aospa-review-back-dead-thrilled/)

Color Engine allows you to seamlessly change the colors of your device to be in Light, Dark (Pixel) and Black modes with a variety of accent colors to choose from.

Any fellow Indians even heard of this Dsports channel? I haven't.
For some reason I think this will be just notifications for random apps, not specifically apps we like. 
Then give credit. 
WAIT A MINUTE DEAN AND BECKY WERE IN A SEGMENT TOGETHER?
He used to. Now he *just* calls it the Fireman's Carry Neckbreaker. 
2) No need for root. Substratum no longer requires root, as long as you're on an OMS ROM (if you followed Point 1, you already are on it)
And that camera placement is weird too. 

Just look at [this image](http://i.imgur.com/m25826Z.jpg). I mean, the status bar has to be huge to cover the camera. Apps are going to letterbox to avoid the camera as well. 

At this point, they might as well have included a bezel at the top.

They had Under-fucking-Taker say this. Goddamn.
Ahh the awful "This Sunday" promo. Ugh. 
Yeah. Tracie (her friend) said she started hating Bayley after that one thing. 

Alexa asked what the one thing. 

Apparently, Bayley would always watch Raw and Smackdown and hence she couldn't get time to hang out with her friends. 
There isn't a delay anymore. Raw and SmackDown is aired live. Big PPVs are aired live. Small PPVs air 12 hours later. 
The TEN channel costs $0.38. WWE Network costs $9.99
I have the same variant. It's soooo good. But MIUI is not for everyone (me neither) so I flashed a Custom ROM. Battery is very good, lasts over 2 days if you aren't a power user.

I managed to get a standby of 2 days and 6 hours with a screen on time of 9.5 hours. 

Only weak point is camera. It's kinda sucks. 
Apps go free randomly for a limited amount of time. They get posted regularly on /r/googleplaydeals when they go on sale. 
They wouldn't have to spy. Catelyn hates Jon is a well known fact. For example, Catelyn not allowing Jon to attend the feast (the one with Bobby B & Co.)

Now, that's just one example (and if she allowed Jon to attend, I don't think it would have changed anything, but still). I also think Catelyn is more kind than people give her credit for. She'd have cared for Jon a lot more if she knew the truth. And it would show. 
Pretty sure the bra might be hindering it. It's only fair to do it without the bra. 
...

Why not? Come on, give him some credit, lol. He is not dumb. 
Fave 5? More like Fave 50.
The reason IMO he didn't tell Cat is, because then she would stop treating him as a bastard and start treating kindly. And that would raise some doubts in the people and especially the Lannisters. The honorable Ned Stark fucked a whore and got a bastard... But somehow Catleyn is okay with that? 
I remember this because the good folks over at r/asoiaf did an ear analysis to figure out it was Bronn, lol. 
KWGT Pro key is free for today, so grab it soon!
I don't use those apps either! They're just some famous examples, so I gave them. 

My point is, even something as simple as Netflix has started to enforce SafetyNet. It sucks, just thinking​ about how many apps may start to do this in the future as well. Fuck SafetyNet. 
A button combo is also available to boot into EDL.
That not only hides root, but helps you pass SafetyNet. SafetyNet fails if you even unlocked the bootloader. But Magisk helps to pass it even with Unlocked Bootloader + Root. 

Apps like Android Pay, Pokemon Go and even Netflix need your device to pass SafetyNet. 
And the most important of it all, Magisk can hide root!
EDL mode is when your phone is hard bricked i.e. neither fastboot nor Recovery works. 

So, you just connect your phone to the PC, do adb reboot edl and you can flash MIUI through it. Think about it as flashing fastboot ROMs even when not being able to boot into fastboot mode.

This used to work on locked bootloader too. But the vendors used this to tamper with the ROM hence xiaomi disabled it. BUT, they ended up disabling it on unlocked bootloaders too! 

So now, if your phone is hard bricked then RIP. If you allow us to use EDL on unlocked bootloader (like you used to with the RN3 phones), then getting the phone back to life is easy. 
Cool. 🤘🤘🤘

If you have any means of conversation with Xiaomi/MIUI Team, can you ask them to consider enabling EDL mode for unlocked bootloaders at least?

Locked bootloaders, sure, I can understand blocking it, because you don't want vendors to screw with it. But on unlocked bootloaders EDL mode will be very useful. 
You're Jai Mani?
All that extra stuff but still don't have "Expand notification with a single finger". 
What?! You don't think anything new is always good? 

He looks so happy! He works hard (no other wrestler does this)
The Miz gets "Yes Yes Yes" chants for his kicks. He gets booed during his promos, but does get cheered during his matches. Same for Owens. 
What was the point of using Kinvara? She just appeared in like 1 episode, we were left to believe it would lead to something more, and then by the end of season the Meereen arc is done and Kinvara is in a limbo. 
> Kevin Owens got "you deserve it" chants when he won the universal championship, if he was a good heel, he would have been booed to hell

What is this, 1754?

People now know wrestling is scripted and can appreciate the hard work put in by all wrestlers, regardless of their alignment. When that hard work gets recognized i.e. the said heel wins a title, people are happy for that guy and hence cheer. 

Blaming heels for getting cheers in situations where they  deserve it is such a stupid and old way to look at it. Also good job ignoring the fact that he was booed by almost the whole damn arena when he beat up Jericho. 
What a shit argument. Everyone here is passionate about the thing they love - wrestling and complain if the thing they love sucks. 

"Mate it's just wrestling" shouldn't be used by any side of the argument. 
Finally some sanity in this thread. 

People are acting as if:

1. It's bad to be cheered as a heel (What is this, 1872?)

2. If some heel gets booed the fuck out of the arena, it's somehow only heel heat and you're being worked!!!1!1 (nope, it can't be that the said heel actually sucks and that's why he's being booed. Nope, can't happen. Nuh uh)
Bray would cut promos every week about how he will slay the beast, etc etc while Lesnar appears on the Go-Home show and beat up Bray. 

We will think "Hey, Lesnar stood tall heading into the PPV, so Bray has a chance right?"

And then come PPV, Lesnar will squash Bray in 20 seconds. Next night, Bray will be back to his promos towards his next opponent. Lesnar will go back to his cave.

But noooo he worked hard! Yay!
Or the very thought out and totally valid "You're being worked!!!!1!!1!"
Eh, this deserves to be reposted. This is very important and the previous threads haven't gained much traction because of their title (the no editorialising rule) while we have a fucking emoji blob thread on the front page for the millionth time in 1 week.

Paragraphs man, paragraphs. 

And there's no way this will top the P2's battery life. 

This thing has a huge 6.44 in screen with 5300 mAh battery, while the P2 has a 5.5in AMOLED with 5100 mAh.

That extra 200 mAh won't make any difference considering a huge increase in screen size.

Although, MIUI's strict battery saver mode may beat it, but it cripples the fuck out of your apps.

Which is even funny because Orton, Cena and Reigns are absolutely huge here in India. They didn't even have to put the belt on Jinder. Vince probably couldn't resist having an orgasm looking at Jinder's body.

Oh shit, I could've just said "OMS=substratum" without writing that essay, lol. 
Overlay Manager Service. It's CM Theme Engine replacement (as of now) and actually pretty good. It's a little complex than CMTE at first, but if you start using it, the possibilities are endless.

There's per app themeing. So you can use 1 theme for some apps, another for other apps. 

And in-built variant support. So OMS themes usually have more than 1 variant. Basically, different colours for background, different colours for accent colours, etc.

It's much more robust than CMTE. You can combine two themes. Let's say, Theme 1 puts a background on the titles in Settings (the one that says "Wireless and Networks" "Device", etc) and Theme 2 makes them centered. Well, you can use BOTH the themes to make them centered _and_ have a background! 

And unlike CMTE, substratum app is available on the Play Store and hence gets updated regularly.

I don't think Deep Flash Cables are blocked. 

EDL mode is blocked, sure. You can't enter through the good old fastboot/adb command and neither through the button combo. But deep flash cable (shorting your cables, etc) still works on a locked bootloader. 

Edit: Wait, but apparently even deep flash cables don't work since 8.1.11 or 8.1.15
Yup, I am aware of this. It's the kedacom USB problem. I don't have this issue because mine doesn't show up as "kedacom". Also, I managed to unlock the bootloader (it did take like a month!) by... well, waiting. 
It is a subreddit. Every post you make on your profile isn't private. It shows up on that sub and if it gets enough upvotes, it shows up on r/all
Just remember, it shows up in r/profileposts, lol.
And now I like this profile posts thingy.
Seriously, the comments I got in the post I linked is very surprising. Everyone is brushing it away just because they didn't get the error. Some are saying shit like "Find my phone. It 100% works!" or "Switch to Global Beta! 100% works". Nothing wrong in saying that, but they're saying it in a snarky tone as if I haven't tried all of that. 
The area to add your account in the dev options, that doesn't give you an error in Chinese? 
Thanks for being snarky and judgemental. Of course I switched to Global Dev before trying. Jesus fuck, this sub gets fucking triggered. 

Just because y'all seem to think I don't know what I am doing, here's what I did before unlock:

1. Got permission.
2. Switched to Dev ROM. 
3. "Find my phone" and then tried. 50% error. 
4. Let it be for 5 days. Still didn't work.
5. Factory wipe. Find my phone. Didn't work.
6. Said fuck it, let it be for 10 days. Didn't work.
7. Said fuck it, let it be for 10 more days when I was out of station, voila it worked when I returned. 


Relay has subreddits on the hamburger menu?
He probably keeps his phone upside down in his pocket.
Do you keep your phone upside down in your pocket?

Any download can get corrupted, sure. But MiUnlock download, if corrupted, would just prevent the MiUnlock from being installed. That won't lead to the 50% error. 

Sure, you've not had the error and good for you. But you're trying to brush it away just because you haven't had it. Just because you haven't had the error, you're saying people who do have the error, are doing something wrong. 
Of course it's Sasha's fault. If she hung out with Neville, she'd have known how to defeat Gravity. 
You're right. I shouldn't have said "simply not true". I mean it sucks to see people who've never run into that error simply wash it away. Just see this comment: https://np.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/6bovrh/kernel_sources_for_the_redmi_note_44x_are_out/dhpmh3k?context=3

Wait I've found is, you're immediately able to unlock if you get 86012 error when you try to bind mi account in developer options. You can then use a VPN and set your location to Shanghai and it will instantly allow you to unlock. The 10008 error has no fix, other than waiting. 

I used the v1 unlock tool in February. 
Holy shit, there's no point in arguing with you. You seem to be so close minded you think just because you don't have errors, no one else does. 

Bootloader unlocking is a real problem. How on Earth can a MiUnlock tool download be corrupted? 

I am in a Whatsapp group and telegram group for this phone. You know what's the thing most people on the group complain about? Bootloader Unlock. You're telling me all of those people and the ones in the thousands of threads all over have forgot to tick USB Debugging​?

Oh, since you seem to be all for anecdotal, take my example. The download wasn't corrupt, USB Debugging AND Allow OEM Unlock was enabled. Still it didn't get unlocked. It took me a month. 
Yup. I've tried a lot of "workarounds". You know what works? Waiting. I had to wait for almost a month for it to work! What grinds my gears in people on r/Android saying it gets unlocked in 5 minutes which is simply not true (unless you're in China. Those guys are apparently able to unlock immediately). 


I did use the V1 unlock tool. It gave the 50% error. The newest unlock tool gives a 99% error instead of 50%
Yup, that's one of the biggest reasons people use Magisk!
Exactly! I can't believe people here seem to be denying that the bootloader unlock is a problem. And look at the downvotes! If I were to guess, it's probably by people who either don't have a Xiaomi or never unlocked it. 

The bootloader unlock 50% error is a real problem and deserves much more attention in this sub. 
If it's anecdotal, then don't say shit like "Not true". You get Xiaomi fanboys and r/Android who has no idea about Xiaomi but thinks they're some rainbow downvotes the other guy.
No it doesn't. Stop bringing your anecdotal bullshit here. 

I have used a valid Mi account and even did the find my phone stuff before trying to unlock. It doesn't work. And this is the first solution given to anyone who makes a thread about 50% error, and guess what? It doesn't work for them either.

What works is, waiting. Waiting for 1 week or so.
He probably thinks he's smart for coming up with that. 
He is asking whether KKR will get 10 wickets.
Yeah, I must be lying then. Have you _seen_ the thousands of threads complaining about the 50% issue on the MIUI Forums, on XDA and on YouTube?
Getting your application approved is not even a big deal. They fuck you in actually being able to unlock. The unlock tool always gives you a 50%/99% error.
That boot.img trick is not available for the Redmi Note 4.
Censored as fuck.
They're late. They're supposed to release it *with* the phone. Oh well. At least they released it.

Dafuq Jinder? The writers don't know Hindi, but you do!
So what seems to have happened is...

They wanted to push Rusev (and Jinder too, just not in the main event). Rusev got injured(?), and when they were looking for a replacement, Jinder got picked because he has the India expansion thing on his side. And when they decided he's gonna be in the main event, Vince got his hands on his storyline and ended up changing his gimmick.

I think RCB should be allowed to qualify for the playoffs for being the only team to win the last group stage match this year. 
Lol RCB is not going to lose _this_, are they?
Actually, it's an old laptop so it hasn't been updated for a while now. Still getting that error and the 4012213 update doesn't show up in Windows Update list. 
I'm not using Windows Defender. I am using Kaspersky. Am I safe from WannaCry? Windows 8.1 x64.

I tried to download 4012213 as suggested by the microsoft blog post, but trying to install it gives "This update is not applicable for your computer". 
Running Windows 8.1 x64

I downloaded this update (4012213) and it says "This update is not applicable for your computer"?
If the G4 Plus has Nougat, you can see the number of apps by just going to Settings and scrolling down to "Apps". The Nougat settings summary shows "xx apps installed"
Guys don't forget that RCB can still qualify. If they make 1500/1 today with Gayle, Kohli and ABD scoring well, they'll get like 30 points bonus. 

Checkmate, Mumbai. 
I haven't enabled systemless hosts and still AdAway works AND SafetyNet passes! How's it possible?
Also planned obsolescence. Even though it may be easier for the OEMs to ship updates, will they still do? 
If SRH loses then RPS qualifies.
Yeah, there's a point Pokemon Go using SafetyNet, because people were using root stuff to game it. Snapchat, sure, because people were using root to save the snaps. 

But Netflix?!

Four sharks are out. Kevin O'Leary is the last chance for The Deadman to get a deal. 
I watched this live. 

The host talked about how he's a long time fan of the WWE and how he liked the LoD, etc. 

Then Big E had an arm wrestling contest with the host and then Hayden (who himself looks like a fucking tank) and beat both of them. 

They then talked about how they train, etc. The gave the three of them Booty O T-shirts and left.

Basically "It's not you, it's me" as in that he can't keep up with Styles at this age. 

Also that he had a perfect retirement and if he comes back it would lose its meaning.

> Just don't criticize them or their actions, you will live for eternity on that subreddit,

I haven't​ been banned, (yet). I'm like 90% sure they'll probably use auto mod to automatically delete my comments. 
Yup. I have seen lots of meta posts before, though can't recall any one specifically. 

What's surprising is they removed it within 35 minutes without any explanation. I go to it through my history and find it locked and removed. It wasn't flaired by them either.

Other sub mods post a comment telling about the removal or put up a flair. Mine was nothing. I had to PM them and then only the gave "Meta" as the reason. 

And the mod/(s) seems insanely defensive in the PM!
Thanks for that sub. Was looking for alternative subs. :D
Yeah exactly! "Not original title."

That's like the worst rule they could come up with. I made a post asking about that and that too got silently removed.

[This guy got banned](https://reddit.com/r/indiadiscussion/comments/69qrsr/banned_for_posting_news_links_from_republic_tv/)
Yeah, I messaged them and this is what I got:

>Meta is not allowed. 

>Pro-tip: If you want to participate in this subreddit, play by the rules. If that's too much then find a different subreddit. Also, we don't appreciate whiny users accusing us of being sell-outs. 
Wasn't that a self post? What's this new rule about?!
How to know that? Didn't get any message about it yet. 

Probably silent banned through automod?
Yup

I PMd them asking again and they said:

>Meta is not allowed. 

>Pro-tip: If you want to participate in this subreddit, play by the rules. If that's too much then find a different subreddit. Also, we don't appreciate whiny users accusing us of being sell-outs. 

They conveniently never mentioned the two Republic posts removed.

And see, "whiny users accusing us..."

Did I even whine in my OP?
This thread was silently locked and removed like the other 2 threads. 
Everyone would probably find it weird. 
It's baffling he compared both and got so much upvotes. Makes me wonder what kind of people we have here at r/india.

You have to open Muzei, choose "Pics from Reddit" and select the subs you want (in this case r/AmoledBackgrounds). You can also set the interval i.e. automatically have the wallpaper change every 60 minutes, etc
I think [Nougat Quick Settings](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.simonesestito.ntiles) can do that.
