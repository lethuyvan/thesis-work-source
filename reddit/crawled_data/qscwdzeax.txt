Nothing wrong with rereading the series. Done it multiple times myself.

But if you, seven years after a book is released, are still going on about that next book that the author owes you, then it's time to pick up some new books.
It's been seven years since Wise Man's Fear. Are people just rereading the series and waiting for Doors of Stone?

At the slow pace of six books a year, that's forty books you've missed cause you're hung up on a different book.

> 7 + (-½ + 5) * 20  

I'm still claiming the comic is correct.

97 => "seven and halfway to five twenties" => seven + ( -"halfway to" + "five) * "twenties" => 7 + (-½ + 5) * 20


You claimed that the picture was wrong.

That it wasn't 5 - 0.5, but instead 4.5 directly. 

My point was that "halfway to five" starts out as 5 - 0.5. So the picture isn't wrong.
Is it though?

90 => Halvfems => Halfway to five twenties => (5 - 0,5) * 20
Fässberg isn't in division 2 anymore. Clubs been in freefall a couple of years and are now in division 6.

I know that IF Mölndal has a couple of English speaking players. (as in, doesn't speak Swedish at all) 

Both Fässberg and Mölndal play at Åby. 

Solängen BK are a division 6 team as well. They play at Eklandavallen. 

Dalen are division 4, same as Mölndal. They play at Krokslättsvallen. 

Closest division 5 team I could find was Balltorp. 
And closest division 3 is most likely Virgo, playing at Mossens IP.

I was never that invested in the series anyway. Was already mad because of the shifting main characters from the different books. Book 4 beginning was just the last drop, not the main problem.

You're never alone in thinking something. 
Yeah, people have told me so other times as well. "He's a really cool character later in the series." 

I didn't really care anymore, so I couldn't be bothered to continue. 
But then the third frickin book just jumps away from the characters that you became invested in, in book 2, to be about some other characters in book 1 that you had almost forgotten all about already. 
Early book 4 was when I gave up. Was the history of some strange character for a few hundred pages, only for it then to be revealed that he was I bystander in some scene in book 2. I just gave up then. It's not for me.

Oh yes, that is very much true. They're not forced into those suburbs but that's where the cheapest housing is and where most people speaking their language are located. 

Most of these communities are very low income communities leading to quite a lot of crime. It's also almost always in these communities we hear  of youth gangs throwing rocks at police cars, fire trucks and busses. 
*I've tried to keep my explanation unbiased, but it's somewhat impossible.*

**My biased explanation:** 

The political climate in Sweden has for a long time been one of "If you wan't cut down on immigration, you're a racist". Well not quite that harsh, but somewhat in that direction. This led all major parties to advocating very lenient immigration laws. And since some people wanted to cut down on immigration they felt their views where not represented.

This led to a surge of voters for Sweden Democrats (SD), a party started some twenty years ago who had anti-immigration as their main agenda. Some prominent members in the beginning had connections to Nazi parties. They were still considered quite extreme until early in the first decade of 2000 when they started to change their image. In 2010 they were voted into parliament and in 2014 they were the third largest party.

The other parties still viewed SD as an extreme party and were afraid of agreeing with SD on any topics. When the refugee crisis started we still had our lenient laws which led to great influx of refugees. The leading parties was slow to react, but when they felt the public support slipping they did a 180 and tightened the immigration laws a lot. The great influx has stopped, but we still have a lot of refugees.

They have been housed in temporary lodgings but we are running out of locations. Not for lack of space, but lack of empty suitable buildings. I know for a fact that some people are being relocated into dormitories. (as a friend who works with this issue put it: "No way that the dude that's been living here for six months is moving into a dormitory. In two weeks he'll be living with his cousin out in the suburbs").

Do we have roving gangs of refugees? No.

Do we have more refugees than we can handle? Yes, I believe so. *Edit: Of course we will survive. But we can't offer good help for everybody coming.*

**Other problems:**

Our major cities have a housing shortage, which leads to people being angry at the government providing refugees with apartments in central locations. We have a lot of a space out in the countryside, but most refugees don't want to live there as there are no one speaking their language there. Most other immigrants are living in suburbs to the major cities.

Some people are angry at the major media outlets for what they feel is unnecessary political correctness. Such as reporting on a crime but not mentioning any description of the assailants (i.e. race or complexion). This has lead to more people using alternative news sites, where they feel they get a better view of the truth. Most of these sites then acts as echo chambers on anti-immigration views.

Yesterday a guy in 12th place got the third most money. And a couple days ago my buddy got 70k for winning a race, while second place got 12k.
This isn't new for stunt racing. Has been happening in normal races as well. Same thing with the bug when the first checkpoint doesn't work. And I have a 100/100 connection so it's not a problem on my end.
Never heard of the guy until your post.

It's not a dancing ban on places that serve alcohol. It's that you need a separate dancing permit for places with dancing.

I'm guessing the reasoning is that places where dancing happens generally are more noisy. And therefore a nightclub need an extra permit when compared to a pub.

True. But a Champions league game between Barcelona and Roma is vastly more interesting than a Scottish league game between Aberdeen and Ross county.

The titles:

* Luis Suárez Goal vs Roma (1-0)
* Messi Goal vs Roma (2-0)
* Luis Suárez 2nd Goal vs Roma (3-0)
* Gerard Piqué Goal vs Roma (4-0)
* Lionel Messi second goal vs Roma (5-0)
* Adriano Goal vs Roma (6-0)

Nothing about them being "tremendous", "awesome" or "super".

Don't use superlatives for stuff that's not super.
Because there's nothing tremendous about it. It's good.

Du kan öppna PDFer, men det är inget jag rekommenderar. Inga av de små (5-7 tums) läsplattorna är speciellt bra på att läsa pdf'er. PDF'er har ju fasta sidstorlekar och plattorna har inte upplösning nog för att visa en hel A4-sida på ett bra sätt. E-ink är ju långsamt på att uppdatera så att arbeta med att zooma in och ut samt scrolla känns väldigt långsamt.

De flesta läsplattor använder sig av epub-formatet, en öppen standard för eböcker. Amazon kör med ett eget fromat, azw, för att låsa folk till deras egen plattform. Det finns gratisprogram för att konvertera filerna och således ta bort kopieringsskyddet, men det är ju olagligt.

Om jag minns rätt var det en norska som hade köpt en Kindle för några år sedan och använde den i Norge, innan Amazon fanns där. Hon kunde använda plattan för hon hade registrerat ett kontokort i SKottland, om jag inte minns fel. När Amazon märkte det rensade de hennes Kindle på alla hennes köpta böcker, eftersom hon inte hade rätt att köpa dem. De fick massa skit för detta, och jag har inte hört att det skulle ha hänt igen, men bara att de ens har möjligheten att göra det tycker jag är fel. Köper jag en bok vill jag äga den, inte ska säljaren kunna komma och plocka ur den ur mitt bibliotek.

Har en Irver Story HD som jag bytte upp mig ifrån. Helt okej platta, men ville gärna ha en ny med inbyggd belysning. 

Undvek Kindle för att jag inte gillar deras affärsstrategi. Låsta format och böcker som du inte äger. Går ju lätt att komma runt det, men då skulle jag ju ändå stödja dem.

The cabin closest to the river has a sauna so we wen't there before breakfast. Me and my coworkers are from an architectural firm, and we where the only guests there, so during the breakfast we got a presentation of the very interesting construction work.

Short answer: It just is.

Long answer: His last name comes from *källa* which means spring (water) (could also mean source) and *ström* which means stream (could also mean current. Both the water and electric kind). And *källa* is pronounced like sh. Why? Don't know. There are no special language rules to follow. You just have to know. There's even a common argument in Sweden if *kex*, biscuits, should be pronounced with a k or a sh-sound.

Om vi skulle folkomrösta för varje beslut skulle budgeten enbart bli utgifter. Politik handlar ju om att kompromissa och vi har ju folkvalda politiker vars jobb det är att göra just det.
Perfect for when I go out running. Weighs next to nothing. Smartphones are "heavy".
Wait, why is that guy using a payphone in 2013?

Wait, why is there a little girl in community college?

Wait, why is that lady drinking from a regular cup and not a paper cup? Is it a teacher?
Go for Sumatra PDF.
Lopez had 38 shots against him in 12 games. Saved 28. 3,17 shots against him per game.

Casillas had 33 shots against him in 19 games. Saved 21. 1,73 shots against him per game.

Quite the difference. But the sample size is too low to draw any conclusion.
Their marriage wasn't annulled, their matrimony in the eyes of the church was. Their divorce ended the marriage, it didn't render it void. My guess is that it's that situation that you're pissed about.
Don't you need an annulment to get remarried in the catholic church?
Little harsh to call his dad an asshole just for getting remarried.

And the church isn't being an asshole for granting someone annulment when the're asking for it.
RES says I've got SMUT_ADDICT at [-156]. He's a serial reposter and has apparently pissed me off.
I read ebooks almost exclusively, and I'm always willing to pay for them, but since I'm not living in the US it can be really hard to find a store that allow me to purchase it.

Mostly it's only self-published authors that can be found that way, and I don't read that many of those.

Occasionally I buy a hardcover when it's released.
European needing some context here. Is it about that football player with the fake girlfriend?
Another one: Dad lets kid tunnel him with the football.
I read that as "**It** put on..." and struggled so hard to get the joke.
Swedish comedian Lasse Lindroth also did this joke, and he's been dead since 1999.
If science could measure them, wouldn't they just be natural?
Who's taking the picture?
I removed all the images from the Epub just to check the size. Book was 0,98 MB afterwards.

File-size can be an indication on the length of the book, but most times it's just the images.
Nice, but still shouldn't be in /r/atheism ...
> They just happened to be good at raiding and looting, as well.

You make it sound as if they accidentally acquired those skills.
I knew it was fake when someone apparently decided to film two kids just sitting on a sofa.
Woohoo, WOT.
Bought and read this last year. Highly recommended.
And broken arms.
In Swedish Peter is Petrus, John is Johannes, Matthew is Matteus, Andrew is Andreas, Philip is Filippos and Thomas is Tomas (Simon is still Simon) so I'm guessing their names got translated along with the story.

Edit: Heck even Jesus is a translataion from Joshua/Jeshua/Yeshua.
I've heard it told by Swedish comedian Lasse Lindroth. And he died eight years prior to that German movie.
Care to give any examples that you consider garbage?

I feel that a lot of the submissions to /r/atheism are unessecarily flammatory, but I still agree with the base opinion.
Mine is ordinary solitaire. It's perfect for when you're multitasking and watching a movie/tv-series, as it's requires almost no concentration. Only mindless clicking.
Tried it, but the quality was to low.
Last week I printed a 11 MB pdf for a coworker. Fifteen pages of architectual drawings that became 1,7 GB when sent to the printer.

After blocking the printer for half an hour, I finally give them to him: "Oh, I need two copies"

Edit: I experimented with that file later in the week, and the solution for me was to switch the printer driver from PS to PCL. 1,7 GB became 80 MB instead.


You should really turn off the embedded date on your camera.
/r/aww is leaking and it's fricking adorable
Quirky awkward is good. Snarky awkward can be fun.

But awkward awkward (I'm looking at you Manny) is just awkward...
I'm with you OP.

And often you can see it coming a mile away. And in my mind I'm begging the writers, "Noooo, don't go there", but they almost always do.
Vet att man hos Arkitektkopia kan få sina 3d-modeller av hus utskrivna. Har dock noll koll på priser.
Antar att roor2k är generellt missnöjd med deras arbete.

Då ska han vara glad att han inte har [Västtrafik](http://www.gp.se/nyheter/goteborg/1.232143-vasttrafik-dyrt-och-daligt).
European here: I thought you weren't allowed to keep running after you went down? Could someone please explain?
It feels like there's someone missing...
It's not text, it's sext. (cringe)

Still not socially awkward though, only awkward.
And in a scene with Anna Faris, wife of Chris Pratt, no less.
I play football in a team in the sixth highest division in Sweden. Even we have fines. Although on a slightly smaller scale.
What the heck is she selling?
>De är bara sura över att det gick så dåligt med att ta Skåne ifrån oss

Har jag missat något? Vi tog väl Skåne från Danmark 1658. Snackar vi om Skånska kriget från 1675, när danskarna försökte ta tillbaka landområden som varit danska i flera hundra år och svenska i ynka 17 år?
This shouldn't even be a jpeg.

Gif or png makes a lot more sense for pictures of text.
dd/mm/yy vs mm/dd/yy

Personally I prefer yy/mm/dd
Looked down on my swedish keyboard and thought: "Why would you press shift+comma to get that semicolon after all those letters in the same row?"

I am not a smart man...
Are you sure? I also noted the date, but thought that a clock with the format hh:mm:dd would be very odd. Hh:mm:ss makes more sense to me.

If #5 & #6 were the date, the fifth column would only be 2 dots as the first number in a date can never be greater than 3.
Wonderful background and perfectly placed info.

Not so sure about the binary clock. Might look better if you removed it. Especially so if you can't even read it. Plus having two Rainmeter clocks seems superfluous.
> Not sure what the last two colums of the binary clock are.

I'm guessing it's seconds. So it currently reads as 2 1 2 8 0 6.
Yeah, I gave up on the third page as well. "Build your ideal woman" got creepy.
In picture #8 you still have both HD-bays ~~still~~ inside. Most likely you don't use both, so you could remove one of them to increase the airflow from the front fan.
I just resize my wallpaper to the correct size and then choose "Position: ~~Side by side~~ Tile".

Edit: I have Windows in swedish so just guessed "Side by side". Most likely it's, like joazito stated, "Tile".
Except that picture isn't taken in Sweden. Not enough snow/rain and crippling despair.
You want someone to cheat on your little sister? Why?

Edit: Spelling
I use the Epub editor [Sigil](http://code.google.com/p/sigil/). It's perfect.
I struggled through the first three books, but gave up 150 pages into the fourth one. I really wanted to like them, but they were not for me either.
Of course you can. It's just a matter of priorities.
**Three** screwdrivers? I believe that officially makes you a carpenter.
Hmmm, I quite like both Notting Hill and Definitely Maybe.
How about a link?

All I know at the moment is that there's a poll somewhere on the internet...
*raises hand*
For some reason they're sorted by date. 16th is #1, and therefore darkest, followed by 23rd and 9th (hmm... 1 week apart...).
Ask him about all the fossils. I'd really like to know his thought on them.
Funny how the 13th of each month is brighter.

A lot of superstitious mothers holding it in, waiting for the 14th?
My bad. Meant to say he wasn't mentioned by the name *Hoid*, which I'm pretty sure the character was called even before *Way of Kings*.
Google translate is correct.

Maybe I'm missing something, but to me it's just drivel.

Edit: Just watched the video. Stephen is speaking swedish and did this nonsense sentence. He also added 'Lawnmower'.
>I have read all of these books and did not make that connection at all.

Neither did I. Way of Kings was the first book where he was mentioned by name.

I think I had already read about him online, prior to it coming out though.
[Hoid] (/spoiler)
[Link 1](http://brandonsanderson.wikia.com/wiki/Hoid)
[Link 2](http://coppermind.net/wiki/Hoid)

In those books he's only a nameless minor character in passing, but in Way of Kings he has a more prominent role.
Storm Front, Jim Butcher

But only if you're ready to read quite a long series, as book 14 is released later this year. 

Storm front is 'just' a good book, but some later books are great.
I really didn't know that it was still legal to spank your children in so many countries.

And I **really** didn't know that it was an unpopular opinion to say that corporal punishment shouldn't be legal.

Wouldn't have thought that countries like Venezuela, Kenya, Congo and Albania would make it illegal before "*more civilized*" countries like the UK and US.
As stated by *clamsclamsclams*, it's "skita i det blå skåpet" for the first one.

And the second one is "trampa i klaveret"
Yeah you're right, accordion fits better.

I took the easy route and just blindly trusted [The people's dictionary](http://folkets-lexikon.csc.kth.se/folkets/folkets.en.html#lookup&klaveret&0).
Yes it does.

Att fråga *Kan vi det här?* för att se om alla är klara. Kanske inte vanligaste uttrycket, men har hört det från flertalet personer. Göteborgare här om det kanske spelar in.
*Now you've shat in the blue cabinet* - You've done a mistake and there'll be consequences

*Put your foot in the piano* - Did something wrong

*Kan vi det här?* (Antar jag)
Enbart näckat på fyllan.
I'm 27. Studied nature-science in school as well. None of my friends smoke (that I know of). None of my friends really care if it's illegal or not.

So I'm guessing it varies greatly from group to group.

I've only been to one party where anyone (publicly) lit up. He was asked by the host to stop since he was on the balcony of a rather large apartment building.
You're not 'obligated' to tip as in some other countries, but it's not wrong to tip. I personally just round up to an even number.
Ski field =  ski resort?

'All' ski resorts are in the northern half (or maybe 2/3rds) of Sweden, but most people live in the southern half (or maybe third).

Since for most Swedes it's a +5 hour drive to get to a ski resort, we usually don't do daily ski trips during winter. But it's very common to spend a week in winter at a ski resort in the swedish mountains (or *fjällen*).

Average temperature depends on the season. In the summertime t-shirt and shorts/skirt is enough most days. Winter I usually go for 3 layers on the upperbody and just pants for my legs (extra long underwear on the cold days). Gloves/mittens for the hands, but most winter days you can do without a cap/beanie. I live in the southern third so my winter experience differs greatly from someone from northern Sweden.
I would most likely end up accidently stabbing myself.
Our summer is slightly colder than yours, but the difference is bigger in winter.

Did a [Gothenburg](http://www.yr.no/place/Sweden/V%C3%A4stra_G%C3%B6taland/Gothenburg/statistics.html) vs [London](http://www.yr.no/place/United_Kingdom/England/London/statistics.html) comparison. Two degrees in summer and six in winter. And approx. 4/5ths of Sweden is north of Gothenburg...
Your winter sounds better than our Swedish summer...
Same thing happened to my sister a while back. Tagged in the picture was '*Boyfriend* jr'.

She was not pleased...

Shutter Island...

Saw the trailer and guessed the ending. When a friend later confirmed it, I never bothered to see it.
I'm not afraid myself, but I heard that Craig Ferguson cured his fear of flying by taking a pilot license. Basically it was the uncertainty that scared him.

I'm guessing spending all that money on a license isn't a viable option for most people, but maybe studying the mechanics of flight would help you overcome your fear.
My mom dropped my older sister when she was young. Her head hit the floor, and my mom says she still cringes when she remembers the sound.

She, rightfully, had to answer a series of questions when she brought her to the hospital...
Miniscule a better word? 0.2mm error on the original metre is fricking fantastic for 1889.

The distance between the equator and any of the poles is only a quarter of the circumference.
Why so much white space?
Based on the 10000km guess, [a metre bar was constructed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Prototype_Meter).
Same here. Finally decided to do surgery, only to find out that my cornea is to thin for laser and my pupil to large to put in an extra lens behind the cornea.
Heard it from and a teacher some 15 years ago. [And wikipedia confirmed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metre).
Am I the only one who uses the 'hide' button?
Yeah, but 3 in "base 3" is also 10.
And 4 in "base 4" is 10.
And so on and so forth...
The metric system was designed so that there would be 10000km between the equator and any of the poles.

Due to a slight miscalculation the north-to-south circumference is 40008 km.
Nice. But doesn't that also mean that base 10 could mean anything?
I must be blind. Still can't see it.

Edit: Moved browser window from my secondary to my primary monitor, and now it's obvious...
Yeah, and that thing about not being able to vote isn't so good either...

Swedish...

Monarki = Swedish for *Monarchy* (and I'm guessing some other languages)

All ÄRA ÅT KUNG CARL DEN SEXTONDE GUSTAF = *All honor to King Carl XVI Gustaf*
Because it's fake. The ball is CGI...

Edit: Since some few individuals decided to downvote me, leading me to think they didn't believe me, I'll just post this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IirwbDZbG1Y).
As anyone can see, it's cgi...

The gender thing I absolutely agree on, but having separate forms of you for singural and plural can be convenient.

Don't know how it is in French, but in Swedish we messed that up by using the plural form, *ni*, when we're being courteous, even if we're only adressing a single person.
Why did you search for placenta?
