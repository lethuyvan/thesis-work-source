You likely have a USB hub or some other USB device that is short circuiting and the motherboard isn't catching it with it's USB fuses since it's 5 volts or lower. It's probably sending 5v through the board and lowering the fans. Happened to me when my powered USB hub went homicidal and killed my monitors and USB devices. Board was fine, but all my USB devices were toast.
The protruding parts of my bumper have white stress marks from being pushed in. It's nothing major but the whole "I didn't touch ya" thing was annoying.
Police didn't bother. They just called Walmart and said they trust them. I dropped it at that point but I was annoyed.
I'm the one in the Jeep.
Who the fuck are you? My bumper was damaged and Walmart wanted a police report to get footage, so i tried to get a police report. There's nothing wrong with that.

Just went down.
Could they turn right then back up?
What drives me batty was Walmart's response. I asked for footage, but they said I need to file a police report to get footage. One call to the non-emergency number later, I had an officer show up who called Walmart's asset protection, who said my car didn't move and there's no liability.

I ended up with no tapes and no police report, but a damaged bumper.
~~It won't run on yours. You have the Power Mac G4 FW800, which is the same one I have. The MDD was the last one that will run Mac OS 9.2.2. This one will not run it, unfortunately. I read on the internet that there's a custom firmware you can flash that will get it to boot, but I don't want to risk bricking my Mac. I'll be sure to post here if I find more information on it though.~~

Edit: I'm wrong, this is a FireWire 400 model haha, you can run Mac OS 9 but I think you need discs specific to this Mac.
My hinges on my JKU are fucked because of this. I bought it with 100k miles and the hinges are already gone. It's to the point that I'm going to have to sand down the area around the hinges and replace the hinges entirely, along with a new paint job on the doors. :(

Use Android Auto and DailyRoads Voyager for dashcam at the same time. If you play music in Android Auto, one of the three things *will* crash. I assume 3GB of RAM was not enough for me.
I noticed this
I just got an Essential Phone yesterday because I wanted something that ran well. My KeyONE never ran quite right, even though it has 3GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. For the record, my Nexus 5X, which was fairly lower end, worked just fine aside from reception issues which made me get my KeyONE.

I already replaced the phone. I'm out of ideas.

Double tap to wake and sleep is already off. It happens less often when I disabled Hub+ Services and the hub. It used to happen once every 15 minutes when I'm using it, now it's down to a few times a day.
No. I did replace my launcher, but it happens when the phone is completely stock. It is happening less now that I disabled the Hub, but it's still hapening.
I've argued with Google Assistant more than I'd like to admit. They've really gimped it. I miss when it was Google Now, it wasn't as dumb and understood my requests more consistently. I often find it getting stuck in a loop, like

Sure, who would you like to send it to?

> Joe

What's the message?

> I'll be a few minutes late

Yeah, it's so annoying. It says "Additional security required" every time it happens so it forces me to enter my pin.
Nope, it's not that. It can happen if I'm just staring at my phone.
The phone will cut straight to the lock screen, then ask for my pin for "security" even though it was just unlocked

That's fair, but I feel like some credit is due to Google for making Chromium in the first place, rather than the overall stigma of "Chrome is bad because closed source"
I misspoke. What I meant to get at is that Chrome is based on open source software, and the code that actually drives the browser is free to look at
Chrome is based on open source software, ~~like Firefox is~~. The proprietary components are pre-compiled blobs. See [The Chromium Projects](https://www.chromium.org/) for more info, ~~but Chrome being closed source is incorrect.~~

Alright, awesome. It takes my '07 JKU about 15 to 30 minutes to warm up from 0 degrees and by the time I'm home the passenger side feels like it is blowing around 80 degrees but the driver side feels like it is around 50.

Ah, I thought they carried the black special edition.
Savage!
I cannot recommend any more to stay away from Sprint. They will treat you poorly because you have a BlackBerry. I was having a hardware issue where it would randomly lock up and reboot, so I went in to exchange or repair it under my insurance. They told me it's "not our fault you bought a bad phone and didn't return it in the 2 week return period", even though I was paying for the Assurian insurance through them. They ended up replacing it because I cried and an employee laughed at me, at which point the general manager of Assurian stepped in.

Save your money up for the 4GB Black variant ~~through AT&T~~; maybe even put SquareTrade. Much less bloat, faster, and you won't have to be harassed by Sprint employees if you have a problem.

The bloatware seems to reinstall itself frequently, which is annoying but not too big of a deal. The reception and speed otherwise are good.

edit: AT&T does not carry the 4GB RAM special edition

Have you seen the iPad Pro? The screen is insanely fluid and the entire OS feels better and more responsive for exactly that. I'm all for 120Hz in mobile devices, personally.
If the S8+ has a screen that is too small, have you considered using a tablet?
It recommends that I try to erase my phone because it's been compromised. I think it's just the Sprint bloatware getting in the way. I tried talking to the customer support but the lower level technicians often don't even know that Sprint still sells a BlackBerry, let alone an Android powered one.
1) File Manager
 
- I personally use Amaze File Manager. I like it. Also, not everything has to be stored on Google Drive -- that is totally optional. You can even disable Google Drive.

2) Google Account

- To use the Play Store, you need a Google account. You *can* disable most Google apps and use the Amazon App Store a la BB10 if you'd like.

3) Browser

- I like Firefox, it's been my favorite. You can install an advertisement blocker. I use uBlock Origin for Firefox to block ads, which helps me be private online. Back on my Classic with BB10, I used Firefox. It's so much more responsive on the KeyONE.

4) Gestures and navigation

- I recommend getting used to using the navigation buttons. Make use of your Convenience key -- that's a great way to launch the Google Assistant or BlackBerry Hub. Press and hold the home button to fire up your preferred assistant -- that can be Google Assistant or Cortana. Tap the window switcher (square) twice to quickly switch between the app you are in and the one you were in. Swipe from the top for notifications, and again for quick toggles. Try out the shortcut keys on the launcher. You can set up hotkeys to launch any app or action you'd like from your home screen just by holding a button.

There's a lot to learn about Android, but I think once you have things down how you like it, it's a very pleasant experience. One thing I personally like is how much you can customize it. If you don't like one feature, you can generally swap it out for another one.

Good luck!


I've loved my KeyONE so far! It's been my favorite phone I've had ever. My SINGLE complaint is the Sprint bloatware that's forced down my throat, and that's my fault for buying through Sprint and not unlocked., Oh well!
No, but is that even possible?
I think that's the point

Check to make sure it's not the SD card itself. I've had this issue before on different devices only to find my practically new SanDisk SD cards died. I now buy Samsung SD cards.
Install [Firefox 52 ESR](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/52.0.2esr/win32/en-US/Firefox%20Setup%2052.0.2esr.exe) and use Reddit Enhancement Suite from there. You will receive Firefox updates until 2018 with that version. Consider upgrading to Windows 10, if possible. If you don't want to lose data, you can upgrade to a trial version of Windows 7, then pay for Windows 10 retail.
I haven't experienced any of these issues. To be fair, I've only had it for a few days, and I upgraded from the Classic which was horribly slow in its own regard.

Mine hasn't bootlooped yet. Probably because I've had to replace it twice already for different issues, and now there's no reception on any network and Google's giving me the runaround.

Then if they replace this one it will probably bootloop.

Okay, so this is honestly the exact keyboard I want. I've been lurking this subreddit because I love the keyboards, but this is the first one I've REALLY wanted to build. That being said, I have near zero experience with soldering and such, so where should I start to build one of these guys? What tools would I need, and what kit should I buy?

That's not what they do though? Also, I don't push overpriced HDMI cables and unnecessary software subscriptions. Never would I even think of doing that.
I discuss it with customers and they request it to be installed once I discuss it. Our DCI has been okay with it, as we are talking to the customers about what they do, and the customers are then asking if we can put it on. I've not been told that we cannot install something a customer requests. Furthermore, they are not on our unapproved list.
That's very sad, but thank you for helping it. :(

Because I have customers who don't know about ad blockers. I work at Geek Squad.

Humidity and temperature, among other things, can cause the PCB itself to deteriorate, which can cause the system to stop working even though all of the components attached may still be good.
Yes, but I do not want to put myself at risk of being tracked or deal with popups because of them.
To block advertising. They use a list of networks that gets updated regularly to keep track of what needs blocking. They can also block other content, such as pages that are reported to have malware.
Nobody. The site loses money.
Who pays to refund the people who get scammed? It goes both ways.
I do not see how it's silly; we're never going to agree on this, and I am personally not a socialist of a similar mindset to you, so I will choose to end this here.
Be present to make sure the EMS can do their job safely.
Yep. At least not yet -- how long until an advertiser comes out that does that do you think? I would much rather run ads on my website that have been vetted by a person than one that makes my users get popups and scams
Regulations made by the ~~companies~~ advertisers, not the government. That's a win-win for both sides of the spectrum. I would advertise my product on an advertiser that is devoted to clean, pleasant advertisements that don't impact the user while still presenting my ads.
They will assist me though. A 911 dispatcher will handle the call, dispatch a paramedic and a police officer.
Yes, they paid, but it was a debit and not a credit card. The scam happened about a month ago, but they didn't know until I had informed them it was a scam. They just said the fix they ran didn't work.
I'm not arguing those points, valid as they may be. I am stating the police are there to help you and keep you safe, both in property and person. If I've been shot and I call the police, they are **not** going to ask if I am a person of color or poor. All they know is I have been shot and require immediate assistance.
These are many of the people who go to Geek Squad. I don't know what they'd do without someone to help them. I like my job because I can help them.
So the police won't help if I've been shot or stabbed? Are you mad?

They fight crime, against person AND property. I don't want my shit stolen, and I don't want to be stabbed or shot. They are paid to protect the public against those things by my tax dollars, and I am thankful for that.
I'm not kidding myself; the police is just another job in the world. I can go to school and become a police officer or detective if I wanted to. It's not some elite club.
Yes. I try my best.
Can't you support some policies without liking a person as a whole?
Have you considered the actual Trump supporters who care about their opinion are afraid to talk because the vocal idiots that they are judged for? Literally anyone trying to have a sane discussion about Trump ends up getting judged because that person is a Trump supporter. People even GO THROUGH COMMENT HISTORY to see if you have posted on ANY affiliated subreddit! I voted Gary Johnson, but I would have personally preferred Trump over Hillary. I can't talk about anything because I'm afraid of being judged. The very vocal left and the very vocal right are all name calling each other and judging people who are not even the problem...

I'm afraid to have a political opinion nowadays, and that scares me. That's why you only see those posts on reddit from Trump supporters -- because they drown the others out.

Edit: Just because in the end I preferred Trump or support some of his policies doesn't mean that I think the moon landing never happened. These kinds of memes are turning all of the right against all of the left, and it's ridiculous
I'm sorry you're being downvoted for having a valid opinion. /r/the_donald and Facebook is being used to represent lots of people right now. Great.
You're generalizing a whole population with a very vocal minority. Not all Trump supporters think that, and not only that, Trump **himself** doesn't think that. The man might not be very smart with politics, but not once did he agree that NASA ran a pedophile ring from Mars
I've also had customers be scammed by the topmost link on Google, because they were looking for HP Support and got people saying their PC had viruses (it had none) and they needed a new firewall (bogus) for only $499.99.

This happened yesterday. So even Google's ads aren't good.
I'll use a perfect example of advertising. You know how on Reddit, sometimes say the Washington Post runs an ad for their subreddit? It's non-intrusive, explains what it is, and is clearly separated from the content

And that's okay! There should be stricter regulation on ads.
Okay, so time to rant about advertising. Advertising is honestly ruining the internet as a whole. I work at Geek Squad, and most of our customers aren't savvy enough to install an advertisement blocker; those who have tried often get malware in the process. I've been told many times that using an advertisement blocker is hurting revenue, but how on earth can I allow myself to be subject to advertising when every time it slows down pages, applications, and makes things hard to navigate?

Go to [Yahoo.com](https://www.yahoo.com/) now. What do you see? "Sponsored" content, animated ads, and a slow experience. Imagine you live in rural Wisconsin and the only internet you have is a 2Mbps downlink over satellite and half of the bandwidth is wasted on advertising?

Every single day, I have at least 5 customers come in complaining of popups saying that their PC has a virus, and to call a number. These popups are coming from rogue advertising. The "solution" is we have been installing uBlock Origin and educating them about support scams, but a question all of my customers ask is "Why are they allowed to do that?". I believe that if even ONE VISITOR of a website has a malicious popup, then the experience is ruined because that would not have happened if the advertisement wasn't there.

Advertising is hurting the average user of the computer. The average user isn't on Reddit, and many won't even think to install an advertisement blocker. The fact that I've met customers who have **been scammed out of thousands of dollars** because of malicious advertisements is absurd! I truly and honestly think any advertising that isn't vetted by a human being simply shouldn't be allowed. Period!
I don't like the thing covering half of the windshield, and the mismatched coloring. Cool Jeep though!

It would impact American jobs such as coal mining jobs, which many towns in Kentucky and other states that depend on such jobs are doing really poorly right now. Ever since the restrictions on coal mining have been reduced, they have been hiring more people and those towns are starting to see improvement in their local economy.

Ah, the iBook G3. I used to "work" in a school with about 4,000 iBook G4s, but for some reason there was a snow iBook G3 floating around amongst them. I knew this because we had some replacement parts for it but it was mixed in with all of the G4s. We had a hard time finding it, but eventually found it because one of my peers complained that the keyboard wasn't working on their computer, which is the part we had to replace in the first place. It looks so much like the iBook G4 that I wonder how much they share in design.

No, he's not, he's just hiding and not eating or drinking... We picked him up and he just went back under the bed when we put him down. He's normally so friendly and playful, so I'm worried
I called my friend that volunteers at a shelter for some advice. She asked when my brother left (he's out of state for vacation), and it was right around when he started getting this way. Could he be depressed because my brother isn't home?
He's throwing a tantrum because the colors on the flag should not be altered in any way. I get where he's coming from, but spamming "bullshit" on a few different comment threads won't get him anywhere

But wait! [To the Moon](http://store.steampowered.com/app/206440/To_the_Moon/) is one of the best games I've played (mainly for story), and it's made with RPG Maker.

This kills the Jeep.
The empty argument they're making is that they used their successful Search product to promote their Shopping product, by putting their shop items up top. I don't really get how that's a bad thing.
Right! I personally have a "business" listed on Google (one man stand and no actual facility though), and I'm thinking about advertising with Google AdSense. If I ever grow and actually get more than one person, I can easily use Google Apps for Business for very low cost. They provide so many services for businesses; I feel like this action would only hurt their spending ability to help businesses... no?
Plus, everyone on that thread is bashing Google like they are forcing their competitors out of business, and the holy EU is the only one that can save us. Last I saw, Best Buy, Amazon, AT&T, and eBay are doing just fine? Sure, Joe's Sweater Shack might not be doing too hot, but that's by no fault of Google promoting their results.
I'm not dismissing it, some of those are indeed serious concerns, but I'll try to address these myself:

1. The false flag as phishing and accidentally quarantining system files, that was live for only 13 minutes. If I'm not mistaken, can't just about any antivirus have false positives? 

2. See #1

3. That ticket is closed and marked as resolved. They fixed it. Bugs happen in any software, I don't think it'd be fair to single out just Webroot when any other antivirus can have problems. Just recently, Google exploited Windows Defender simply by feeding it an infected file as a proof of concept.

4. That sounds bad, can't really say anything about that one

5. My Steam and Nvidia GPU work fine with it. Your mileage may vary. If you're that worried, don't use a premium antivirus; stick with Windows Defender and an ad blocker.

6. I personally wouldn't put any antivirus on my Mac. Just an ad blocker. Again, your mileage may vary.

7. See the two responses to that post.
>AV Tests are in no way related to what our customers actually see. You wouldnt test an electric car using the same tests that you would put an traditonal gasoline powered car. Its the same with Webroot, we are so vastly different that the tests dont show this. 
>_______________
>First I would like to agree with @Rakanisheu on her comment about the comparisons. Here is a very well stated article on the differences between a conventional (Pure computer based) Antivirus and a Web Based (Cloud) Antivirus. It actually brings several great points on why they differ and why each has it's benefits and pitfalls. http://anti-virus-software-review.toptenreviews.com/cloud-antivirus-vs.-pc-antivirus.html With that said I also must add relying solely on several comparatives is not logical in that each has their own criteria which may or may not be applicable to what you are looking for. It is kinda like comparing Road & Track with Car & Driver for comparatives on a new Hyundai Accent. Both will give thorough reviews but with the criteria clearly different for the purpose they review. I would also like to mention that Antivirus comparatives are very similar to computer benchmarks and sites that compare different hardware. Of course these will be different because again they use different criteria. And it also falls in to a personal experience index which can't be gauged with a benchmark. Personally I think that Webroot does a great job (however this is again completely subjective opinion) much like some prefer Windows 7 over Windows 8. Nether are bad per se but it all depends on the person using it. I think the greatest selling feature of Webroot is the small package, never having to deal with definition updates and the pure speed of both bootup and of scanning. To wrap up my comment, it is purely a personal choice on protection and the best way to prevent any problems is to be diligent on your use and to follow normal security measures. No Antivirus is 100% and none will ever be. As long as people want to cause hate and discontent they will create bugs and the antivirus world will be always playing catchup. But again in my opinion Webroot leads the way on the future of Malware protection.

8. According to their test, MalwareBytes is the worst antivirus/antimalware program, which is absolutely not true, which brings me back to benchmarks aren't giving you the true accuracy of how good the antivirus *really* is.

9. See this comment on that same thread:
>Hi MrParham The main reason that Webroot do not submit WSA to the AV testing sites becuase of the way that thry test and the way that WSA works. The two are mutually exclusive in that the tests 'penalise' WSA and generate poor results which do not reflex the very good protection that WSA does in fact provide. The core issue is that WSA looks for active threats rather than all threats, on the basis that a non active or dormant threat is in fact no threat (until it becomes active and then WSA will pounce on it) and therefore it will not detect all of the samples in the test and therefore scores low marks in that aspect. Having said that this has been recognised by some of the testing organisations and they are working with Webroot to devise a more representative and fairer test...so I suspect that in the future we will see WSA being included. Interestingly, WSA has been included in some tests in the area of banking transaction protection & identity protection and has in fact been found to be amongst the very best for protection...please see this previous post on the subject. If you have further questions on this topic please post back and I will try to answer them. Hope that helps? Regards, Baldrick 

10. 4.7 out of 5 stars (on Amazon). No antivirus product is perfect. 

Don't get me wrong, Webroot is probably not the best out there, but by no means is it any worse than any other antivirus, at least in my opinion. I feel like your post is a very opinionated attempt at showing how "bad" it is, when there's no real substance to it. I can do the same thing -- find 10 articles about why X antivirus is bad, but that's not really what's important.

By that logic, Windows Defender is the worst antivirus and nobody should use it; however, with simple logic and blocking ads, it's sufficient enough. I don't think Webroot is the cancer you're trying to make it out to be, is all.
I think this was supposed to be a joke.
Most anything else leaves stuff in AppData. Firefox leaves stuff there. Thunderbird too. That's a standard folder for application data, which isn't necessarily cleaned out by an uninstaller.

Also, I still don't see how it's bad? You've told me it's bad because people say so, and because "izi pisi scripts".
Why is it bad? 

Edit: I just uninstalled it to test; I was able to remove it just fine. Why do you insist it's that persistent?
I'm on my third so far, but this one gets just about zero reception anywhere. Thank god for WiFi. I'm hoping I get a refund or something... but on the bright side, replacing my phone every few months with the warranty means no boot loops!

This is probably the best keyboard I've seen on here IMO. I love it!
Sounds like you've got a game plan then. Hope you like the laptop!
Actually the salesman did have a good point, but I haven't seen any issues crop up because of that. Plus, the watch band hinge looks sleek in my opinion. There's a year-long warranty if you have any issues, and Best Buy also sells extended warranties in the form of Geek Squad Protection if you think that's worth it.
Nope, that's a great laptop. Avoid Lenovo's cheaper units though, those are horribad.
I work at Geek Squad and like once every 4 times one of these comes in, either the touch screen or track pad is bad, even if we didn't sell it. 
I work at Best Buy and I don't think we get any exclusive models, aside from store brands like Insignia or Dynex. You might just be having some bad luck, but if I bought a laptop and had to replace it thrice in a week, I'd just get a different model entirely.
Maddy used to do this when it was snowy outside and we had to take her in. She eventually would get too cold and come in, but the flop is definitely something Golden Retrievers do!
I can ride my bike with no handlebars
A quick temporary unfuck. That thing is so rusted that I need to get it replaced. I'm not going to use the parking brake for now.
Minimal rust is a luxury I do not have. This is a 2007 JKU which has seen nine salty winters now and almost 138,000 miles.
I'm 20 so I can't have one unless the parents say I can (Wisconsin laws), and this happened at my friends house. Hand was indeed cut on the side, because I had to hammer the living hell out of the wrench on those bolts to get them loose. PB Buster is great, by the way.
I love the Jeep I have but it has a plethora of issues. Rusted parking brake, ball joints need replacing, shocks need replacing, thermostat in the engine is leaking apparently, muffler is loose, electric locks went out, door hinges are corroded and stiff, and the power locks went out. Front passenger interior handle doesn't work either, so that's cool!

But it's a Jeep, and it's mine!

Today, my parking brake seized up, and I had to repair it myself since all the shops closed up for the night by the time I tried to head out. I plan on letting a mechanic repair most of the other issues, aside from the hinges.

Oh shoot. Well, it fixed it for me at least. I have a 2011 Malibu.
Use the clutch! It's the top left shoulder button. Alternatively, turn on clutch assist in your settings for a less realistic, but easier driving experience.
This happened to me, I almost replaced my phone! Update to Android 7.1.2, that will DEFINITELY fix it!
So much going wrong, poor girl.

1) How can someone be so oblivious to what is going on in front of their car? How long do you need to ignore the road??? He didn't even  try to stop!

2) Didn't the cammer see something was wrong and honk or something? You best believe if I see something like this, I'm honking. Plenty of time for everyone involved to react.

3) Yes, she didn't look both ways. But it's a crosswalk.

Why should Intel be forced to license their proprietary tech? AMD does not license their technology from Intel; however, their prices are very competitive with Intel processors, especially regarding the price to performance. Why should Intel, who has enjoyed a very good success with their processors, be forced to license their technology to other companies?     
That is not capitalism. That is borderline socialism.

I bought a scanner. Codes P0014, P0016, and P0017 are displayed. Reader seems to say cam shaft problems? https://imgur.com/gallery/zdpty
Here are the codes, I took photos. P0014, P0016, and P0017. https://imgur.com/gallery/zdpty
Not as far as I can tell, no. I'm going to take it to a mechanic tomorrow to get the code read
 
I don't see why you have to be rude about it. I just learned about code scanners today. I'm going to get it checked tomorrow; this happened at around midnight so nowhere was open. 
Not trying to be negative, but I don't think that'll work because it depends on a Bluetooth tester to be installed.
I do indeed have Android
Yes, I do have Bluetooth
The odometer is digital, so yes. If you can find something, that'd be great. I've only found information regarding Chrysler vehicles.
Alright, I don't really want to drive it because I don't want to damage it any further if anything's amiss. How much does one cost if I need to buy/rent one?
I did that, but the error code never came. Does this work on 2011 Malibus?
No clue, I don't have any testing tools. I'm not a mechanic and I just want to have an idea of what I might be looking at. I plan on calling the dealer on Monday when they open.
So my 2011 Chevrolet Malibu very suddenly started running rough, so I shut it off thinking "Oh, shit". Went to turn it over, and now it doesn't turn over sometimes; it seems to really struggle. Once it's on, it sounds like it's sputtering and the check engine light is on. Roughly 52k miles, just got it from a dealer in February. Can anyone tell what's up?

Edit: This started happening very suddenly, it was running very smooth and nice before. Happened in a parking lot at low speeds.
Basically, no. Once you opt in, it's permanent.
who?
Yeah, camera shake is off of course!
Sounds like me. I'm at about 850 hours, and my friends with 300 to 500 can kill me in a 1v1. They watch how pros play and streams and stuff, but I don't. They changed their camera settings. I didn't. I'm playing pretty stock

For me, I just play to enjoy the game. My ball chasing habits got me to Rising Star last season and that's enough for me! Do whatever is fun for you :)

I've noticed my screen sometimes doesn't respond to touch at all. I just lock and unlock it and it's all good again. Not sure why, but I'm also on 7.1.2.

On the bright side, 7.1.2 fixed Bluetooth with my car...

I've been using the Gavril D-series pickup for offroading, and noticed after a recent update that any sort of bump breaks my steering (which you can see hanging down) when I'm using the solid-axle front suspension with 100% ride height. Is there a plan to fix this, or maybe add aftermarket parts that support a lift better, like in real life?

Thanks!
Uh?
Mighty impressive, should've taken photos of the uprooted trees! Glad to hear it got out pretty okay
That's pretty impressive. Any damage?

Yeah, the hopper is a tank. I guess they didn't mess around with the radiator support.
the person plugged an ethernet adapter, which needs to be plugged into a computer to be useful, into a power adapter, which does absolutely nothing. basically, no internet can be accomplished this way
I'm looking for the 80's Bronco II. One of my favorite small SUVs of all time. The hopper is so good and is close enough for me though!
If the right height is higher, adjust your steering center more positive until it goes straight. Some sway is normal if you are accelerating vs decelerating. It's just how solid axles work.
This would be Wisconsin, but the snow had been gone for a month now. Seems it goes off-road, so I guess it's used well

I hope you don't get downvoted because it's not a Wrangler. Beautiful Jeep, and congrats!
Whelp, time to drop this sub. I'll just follow Porter on Twitter.
You okay bud?
I have it, and my friend has it. We both have the 5X and 7.1.2 Beta, if that helps.
I've been using it, and here are my issues so far:

* SwiftKey Neural Alpha can't complete installation; it never detects itself being enabled as the default keyboard. This makes it fairly useless
* Battery life seems to be slightly worse
* Snapchat runs even worse, but other than that, the system seems fine
* New notification system looks pretty
* New settings page looks ugly, but is probably easier for the average Joe. It hides advanced options under "Advanced" for each category
Oooh... your fender! Might want to get ones with more clearance!
I don't get it?
I'm having the exact same issue. I worked around it by setting the deadzone for the trigger to 50%, but that's ridiculous. I bought it from Best Buy with the Geek Squad plan on it, so I'm planning on exchanging it when I can
I'll get there some day!
You've got a pretty loud horn you're tooting there
What a good boy
Yeah, I don't know if they still do tbough
It also has a whitelisting system where they allow "acceptable ads" through. Sure you can disable that, but why have to in the first place, when there's an ad blocker that's faster, lighter, and gets the job done just by installing it?
All is well here as well.

I don't think that at this point we have anything concrete to really point us in that direction, but we'll keep investigating and we'll let the facts guide us on how this concludes," Supt.

Don't buy the white one unless you either get a case or you don't mind having a yellow phone. Otherwise it's been great!
Thanks for the suggestions!
When you report someone, does it ONLY send the snippet it shows, or the whole log?
Fuck that shit I'm out
Righteous.
It's been saying that for years! Right now playlist sync seems to be broken, but overall it works great.
I've seen some ridiculous stuff, but a fucking rocket!? This is making me laugh harder than it should!
When I heard trebuchet, the first thing I always thought of was Cyanogenmod, not launching a 90 kilo projectile over 300 meters.
10.
I'd probably be downvoted to hell "Fuck off what is a cyanogen mod man get out of here lame xDDD"
My objections to this are that it'll still be yellow.
Mismatched IMEI number sticker? Peeling label?

Maybe I could just reattach the sticker very cleanly...
Right, but I am definitely not a smoker and while I do live in a smoker's house, I refuse to let them smoke anywhere near my things.
It doesn't get hot. The only time I've had issues is when I accidentally put a pillow over it overnight while charging (which every phone will overheat from!)
But the phone will still be yellow...
Ah, The 8-bit Guy! I didn't think of that! I watch his channel all the time, but I didn't think my three month old phone was yellowing for the same reasons that those 20-year old computers he toys with are. I'll try that!
I'm new to the 5x, but this is every /r/nexus subreddit in a nutshell. There are still people touting the Nexus 5 saying each new Nexus doesn't hold a candle to it.
The only limiting factor I see is that it will stop getting Android updates some day. Then again, there's always XDA.
No joke, I'm considering it. It looks like a REALLY solid phone. I think investing in the 128GB model might be worth it if I keep it for four years (with insurance)
Called Google about it, obviously it's not covered under warranty (not broken)

However, replacing it will void my warranty. Oh well.
But why is it happening so quickly?
Whelp. Why's it sponsored then? That's interesting.
...on VHS and DVD.
Legal obligation. If someone paid to get a Pokestop, they probably have to say it's sponsored.

Edit: I may be wrong
I know, but it's been reposted so many times and reuploaded. This is one of at least four hundred uploads.

Took this on my Nexus 5X, with HDR+ enabled. Stock camera app and Android 7.0.

Holy...

Great find!
Try a return if it's eligible. If not, I recommend looking at the antennae (black & white cables) to make sure they are connected properly. This happened with my old Nexus 5 when I had it.

Good luck!
I don't need a phone the size of my face. The 5X is already borderline too big for me, so I'll stick with the smaller one.

Plus, I like the 5x for the pricing (answering OP's question), so no. 
= 4 + 0
No.
Normally I don't comment, but this is just very cute!
Works beautifully for me, I've had no problems whatsoever. If anything, Nougat reduced the camera lag I had, and improved my battery life while it was at it.

Good points , I was just a little heated to be honest. I feel like lots of animes try to throw in random boob grabs and panty shots for no reason, or awkward scenarios that don't happen (like "tripping" and falling into suggestive positions). It just gets annoying to me sometimes

This. I really *really* **REALLY** dislike fanservice, because I'm not watching what is essentially an eastern cartoon for that. Any time I'm watching anime, I pause it when anyone walks by just for this reason, because if I don't, there'll be a random bath scene or sexual harassment.

Edit: To sound less pissy, I'll just say I strongly dislike it when it serves no purpose, other than to get a random panty shot or boob grab. It's usually out of place and interruptive.
Fuck. Literally, fuck.
What a ride it was, I gave up on it until just now and finished and I'm really glad I did.
There's two kinds of Mac Pro, pre-2013 and post-2013. The post-2013 one looks like a futuristic trash can, hence why I called it one.
Specs of the Power Mac G4? Looking to upgrade mine. PS I'm about an hour south which is fine by me!
Thanks for the response! I actually have those orb speakers, but I found out that there are two kinds! There's the model for the Power Mac G4 with the black theme on the rubber, and there's the iMac G4 speakers, which are the ones that both you and I have. The problem with the iMac speakers is that while they sound great (mine have not rotted), the cable is designed to connect to the back of an iMac, which is usually on top of a desk. As such, my speakers are tethered to the top of my Mac, which is why I'm looking for the originals. I really do appreciate the response though! Do you mind sharing what other "Mac bits" you have laying around?

None, except make sure the modem doesn't have an active DHCP server.
If it's compliant, it should prevent that from happening them. If not, it might just blow the fuse in the USB port 
No clue, but I don't think USB 2.0 can draw more than 1.8 amps.
But that's no fun!
No spare tire, no bumpers, regular suspension, 5.5L engine w/Stage 3 Supercharger, big offroad tires (35s not 33s), and open diffs on the front and rear. Rear diff is the 3.0 open diff. Tires at 50 PSI.

It can probably go faster if it was modified further, such as no fenders or fascia.

Wow, what a story. Thank you for sharing, and I'm glad you're doing well nowadays!
They're not getting smaller, so I'd get the 5X. It's a bit too big for me, but it's as small as they're going to get. It works AMAZING though!
If you're comfortable with it, could you share your story?
I know what you're talking about, it's like black layering put on top of the road to make it smooth again (?)

Anyways, it's sticky and rough on my bike, since I have mountain bike tires. The tires pick it up and spray it on me, and the stickiness makes it hard to bike on. It usually is better after a few weeks, but it sucks.

It could be worse, we could have Illinois roads!

I just switched from the Nexus 5 to 5X. I love it, but it's just too big. I'm getting used to it, but I really wish I could have this exact phone, just slightly smaller. it's an amazing phone though!

I'll try the N preview, as soon as I get a USB 3.0 type A to type C cable. Thanks!

Yes...
My device doesn't show on Android Device Manager. I've tried clearing Play Services data, resetting my Google account, and reinstalling Device Manager. What can I do to get it to work?

Yes. Google+ signin does not work, but Pokemon Trainer Club sign in does, when their servers are working.
...which is why it's patched, to remove the 4.4 requirement. The app runs on 4.3 without the artificial version requirement.
I am using a Classic and I haven't been able to log in either, even though it seems to work. I tried logging in with Pokemon Trainer Club on my Nexus 5 as well, and it does not work. I was told Pokemon Trainer Club is offline for now

Was it the white or black one? Either way, it was an antenna cable for *something*. You'll probably have worse WiFi or signal strength, but the phone should keep working. You can order a replacement on eBay for cheap.

Let me know if you sell it, I'm looking for a 32GB motherboard!
Now imagine using a Nexus 4 with 8GB storage for three years ;)
Yes, I used Nexus Root Toolkit and Google's flash-all.bat file, so it should have updated everything
I had to flash 4.2 since it was the only version that works now.
I've tried and that didn't fix it. It's a very very strange problem.
I have the 32GB model and honestly it's wonderful. I haven't filled it up (or even come close), and I've had no need for an external SD.
A 16 GB motherboard. The one I have doesn't take anything above Android 4.2.2 for some reason; anything higher refuses to boot past the boot animation.
No offense, but that was *very* hard to read. I think you were trying to say your power button doesn't work and your phone is slow? You can open the phone up and swap the power switch board (see iFixit for more info).

Regarding it being sluggish, it's just an old phone and will be sluggish compared to other phones.

I miss the entire OS. If I could have BB10 with the same quality of apps from Android (i.e. Cascades & native Facebook, Messenger, Snapchat, etc.), I would never go to Android again.

However, I needed apps, so I'm currently on a Nexus 5. I miss my Classic, but it doesn't do what I want it to do.
I've seen a few things here on certain subreddits that showed some people really just don't care about killing others. It makes me sick even thinking about killing someone, but it comes naturally to some. Why is this?

Theoretically, yes, but it would require quite a bit of work, and it would be Chromium OS.

Here's what would be needed:

- ChromeOS-specific Coreboot for Remix Mini
- ChromeOS Coreboot recovery
- ChromiumOS recovery image for the Remix Mini

If someone can make these things, it can probably happen; however, I do not think the Remix Mini supports boot ROM flashing.

Being loud is actually one of my issues! My brother constantly reminds me "Jon, we're inside" because I'm always getting loud when I'm excited, especially regarding technology. My family understands and knows I care, but I tend to put people off sometimes, because they think I don't care sometimes. 
To be honest, I'm mainly referencing family. They tell me when something I do is "off", so I know it as an odd behavior and try to avoid doing it again.
OP here, just wanted to give my experience as a starter. When I was younger, I would do things such as hide under tables and yell when I didn't "like" things, or run around screaming about how funny pudding was. I've since learned to control these behaviors, but some things like constantly fidgeting and having an outward lack of empathy (which just isn't true) still carry on.

What are things you guys have had trouble with? Things people have told you about that you wish to "fix" or hide?
Reading this made me cry for some reason. Parents are powerful.
I own a department store bike and I can say this is a serious concern. I hit a curb with no problems, only to have my rear tire come off the ground when I turned because my stand had come down.
So... tie on the head?
Awesome! Thanks
Our store got these, and I kind of don't like them. It's such a contrast to the blue and it's just not pleasing to the eyes.
Can you explain then? I've always been taught that salt water is good to prevent infections or make them go away faster.
Salt water is antiseptic in nature and can help prevent infections. You can also gargle a mix of hydrogen peroxide and water and get similar results.
Not bad!

I'm interested in the Kindle Fire HD. Verification?
How much for the SB6121?
What CPU are you using? It might be held back by the CPU as well
Would you take a GTX 550 Ti? It's not the greatest, and it's not new, but it games well.
How did this get through? There's no confirmation.
I thought this was pretty good
What RPG is this?
lad
What years should I be looking at vs avoiding?
This is straight fucked up

Honestly, this video is funny, but it's best if Pyro stays away from stuff like this for now.
What?
This is the one. This is the next video.

No updates, and the amount of development happening on BB10 is sadly low.
I'd love this so much.
I have the Classic and it's a great phone; however, I think you've bought into dead tech. BB10 seems to be on its way out.
I hope so.
Thanks for the response. I found a bunch of aftermarket CPUs, one even was 2.0 GHz with 2MB of L3 cache; however, it retailed for $599.99 when it was new in 2006, and the company doesn't exist anymore. Based on my research, it's just going to have to stay as it is for now.
BUILD A FIREWALL!
This... will do.
/r/WTF if I'm not mistaken. I unfortunately saw this tragedy and I pretty much jumped when it "popped". I wish I could unsee it.
Same... I frequent /r/WTF, I think this was there.
I believe you commented on the wrong post
Fair enough. Maybe I'm just too passive and willing to let this kind of stuff happen.
Maybe I just feel differently about this, but I don't see much wrong here. Sure, it was wrong, but nothing about this should move towards legal action or reprimanding. If I was shoved by some guy, I'd just think "wow, what a prick" and move on with my day. regarding the phone confiscation, they thought they were witnessing something wrong happening, so they took action. Obviously they were misinformed and it was just Android Pay, but is it not a case of "better safe than sorry"?
Wasn't their embarrassment enough training?
Confirmed
Bought a Nexus 5 32GB from /u/22jk
So, what doesn't work on it?
NSFW username I guess?
I have an AM3+ micro ATX mobo with USB 3, SATA II, and IDE support. PM if interested.

Edit: Also has stock cooler
Good luck dude. The Phenoms, while great, aren't really selling for good prices nowadays.
I have an MSI GTX 550 Ti for $40 + whatever shipping is. PM if interested.
I'm interested in the computer part box of crap, both of them. Can you PM with any sorts of details (like all wires, what?)

I like a mystery.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH
Should be official👌
What the actual fuck
Look for something that works with Picasa, as Picasa is Google Photos' backend.
Oui.
I'm amazed to find people from Lake Geneva on Reddit. I live here!

Swapping the motherboards would be a good idea; it's not too difficult provided you have the right tools.
If you don't mind the size, go for the 6, but the 5X is a good deal and will be receiving Android updates longer than the 6. It also has a very good camera!
Holding a drone?
Yep!
I suggest updating it to 6.0.1 through the built-in software update. Afterwards, you can reset it through the software. I don't suggest you even root unless you need it; Android has gotten a lot of features since 4.4.

The three-line menu button (hamburger menu, top right) is shaped like an actual hamburger in the McDonalds app.
This post was mildly infuriating, also because it's a screenshot... of a post... in progress? Just post it?
What subreddit is this?
They forgot comic sans.
Try a BlackBerry Z30. The BlackBerry Facebook app isn't a shit.

Yes.
I made this in about 5 minutes in Gimp; I didn't intend on actually making it well.
Well yes, but I don't believe sand acts this way in real life.

You don't; the game is already a beta.
Why does this happen?
Put an SSD in it, and you're golden. Most laptops come with shitty 5400 RPM crapdrives.

Edit: If you get an SSD, disable the free fall sensor; it'll try to disable your SSD if it detects movement
You know, you have a point. Still, the advice here was helpful
I used to live in south Florida, and I thought it'd be a good gag. It's definitely not accurate/politically correct.

People ask where I'm from, I just say "Fort Lauderdale".
I have a 32GB one.
The logic I'm thinking is that fixing it is cheaper than a new phone... I'll use that to trick myself for now, I guess.
I got it for $110, and I have a phone & computer repair side job, so I have all the proper equipment and the like. My only issue is money; I don't want to waste too much.
I go to GTC, not UW Madison
Nah, Lake Geneva. Close enough I guess.
I'm in a similar situation. I got a cheap Walmart mountain bike (everyone here will hate those, with good reason). Threw on some cheap fenders, a cheap bike computer, bell, lights, and a saddle bag. It does me well in the winter, and on snow so long as it's not too deep. Then again, I haven't ridden on it much (only about 30 miles so far), so I don't know how well it will continue to work.
I believe it was "Taskbar Tidbits".

I doubt it to be honest, your immune system is pretty good. In fact, consider it a little protein boost in your diet
Alright, good deal for you
[The X2-01 was very similar](http://cdn2.gsmarena.com/vv/pics/nokia/nokia-x2-01-ofic1.jpg)
May I ask if the Nokia clone was the Nokia X2-01? This is pretty much exactly what I did.

I have a Power Mac G4 from 2002 with a Radeon 9000, 2GB DDR RAM, and dual 1.42GHz PowerPC G4 chips. It has a SATA II card with a 500GB SATA II drive, another 500GB IDE Time Machine backup drive, as well as a USB 2.0 card. Gigabit ethernet, as well as 802.11g WiFi. Also has matching speakers (Harmon-Kardon).

How much is it worth?

> Eh, vs a good chunk of what people normally come across that's true enough.
I mean, yeah, you do stupid shit you're going to get shit broken, but it's not like we're in the "2 hours connected to the internet leads it to being irreparably corrupted by viruses" territory Windows XP was in.
No.
Indeed that would, but it would only be as good as the external battery; your internal one might not even hold the charge. I suggest getting a high amperage (2.1A) external charger, just to ensure it can charge successfully.
For real.
Alright, no worries, and they sure do.
I'd still fix it, but that's just me. New screen is *almost* always cheaper than a new phone
Yep, new battery. These batteries are getting ancient!
I understand. I just bought a Dell laptop and I've been strongly debating returning it, and this would be a great alternative... but it's just really expensive right now. $800 is a very fair price, it's just too steep for me at the moment.
I'm interested, but.... $800 is steep. Good laptop though.
Just to update, I also have a 1TB HDD I'd sell for $30.
Thanks, but I don't think it will sell too easily!
To be quite honest, I'm just trying to get rid of it without losing anything, and I'd rather not throw it away.
Ah.... I was going based on the eBay prices for the 1GB card. Thanks for the info!
It's more cost efficient to upgrade the SSD and install Windows onto her Mac.
Selling a Samsung first-gen ARM XE303C12-H01US for $35 (not including shipping). The thing is beat up and old, but it works. I'll send photos if you're interested.
I have a Q8200, but I don't know if it's better. Asking $30 shipped.
Won't work in your PC if you're on DDR2. Make sure your motherboard works with AM3+ CPUs
I have an AM3 Phenom II x4 945 (95W, rev. C3). Asking $55, shipped. Let me know if you're interested. Works great!
Yeah, here it is

Also selling an old Power Mac G4, but that's probably not what you're looking for.
I've got an [iPhone 4](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/comments/41yqqh/usawi_h_att_iphone_4_w_paypal_or_offer_something/) for sale, it works pretty well, and I use Snapchat daily. $65, plus shipping, but I'm willing to negotiate! It comes with a case and a charger.
I have a Gateway-branded Intel motherboard with a Core 2 Quad Q8200. A little old, but it still works very well. I can sell you the motherboard and CPU. The motherboard doesn't come with a I/O shield though... I kind of made myself a home-made one. $50, plus whatever shipping comes out to be.
Nope, I also left "positive" feedback, as it's a calculator; however, I did comment on "Why must I provide feedback on a built-in calculator?"
Making posts like this is how they get rid of it
But it's not worse, right?
Got it. I always unlock beforehand, but thanks for the good advice

(And it honestly may get the next update; the Nexus 4 got Lollipop even though it was out of schedule.)
Seller also included a tempered glass screen protector. I was already in for $40 every time I cracked my Nexus 4's screen.

Edit: In the 2 years I had it, I cracked it once by me being stupid (fumble, tried to catch, slapped it into the wall)
The seller replaced the battery already! :)
I think it could go back on, if you line up the pins (?)
This happens to me far too often
This disappoints me gravely. Time to return my stylus. They told me it would work!
Oh my god
