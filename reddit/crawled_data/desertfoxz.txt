The problem with that is autonomy. Independent countries most likely want to continue to be independent as to be able to tailor their laws as the country likes not a federation.

Google and the EU aren't on good terms
Because the laws are different and copyright issues. Also some European countries treat Google as an infestation so Google doesn't view European markets as favorable. 
Femur broke
He closed the Russians consulate so he is reacting. Otherwise, he wouldn't have done that.
I'm that is too much of a stretch because the show has orgin stories way before Finn or his parents were alive. The elements story, PB origin, ice king origin and the list goes on. Even Finn's origin is explained 100% without any holes. Nothing in the show suggests that Finn is dreaming all this.
The problem with this theory is events happen without Finn and Finn the character doesn't remember them. Any show could just end with "it was all a dream" but there isn't anything in the show to suggest it.
Its over, I have the high ground
Android the brand is dead
They can and will. Android is dead honestly and seeing a Chrome OS tablet just shows Fuchsia is going to be the new unified OS for Google. 
My reception has never cut out, ever for years. I have speeds of 60 mbps with Project Fi.
The phone looks like its from 2013. Modern phones have no problem with reception.
Why would you upload this when you are crying like a bitch
Android the brand is dying being replaced with Google branding. Android Pay was re branded to Google Pay and then Android Wear is now Wear OS.  
I think this is further proof of a unified OS in the near future, Fuschia.

Usually in card sets like this the most important or "strongest" are the face cards. That would mean the top Disney characters would make up jacks to aces.
Bitcoin transactions rely on mining for transactions so there is no escaping it.
I just have been doing homework, nobody needs to pay for that opinion
Honestly, I think bitcoin will go out like the beanie baby craze. It was interesting when it began but bitcoin isn't being used for everyday transactions and instead is being used for trades of currency just like gold. Gold though is physical and actually has some worth being used for manufacturing so that is the only thing it has in common with gold. 

Also the amount of energy used for 100 million transactions of BitCoins used 30.1 TWh vs Visa having 111.2 billion transactions that used .19 TWh of electricity. I would sell everything I had if I put any money in it.
I wonder if they got time to say good bye because maybe we missed some context from this video. If they did that I think this is more preferable since they would have a last chance to say what they wanted in person.
How many licks does it take though you fucking smart ass owl?
If a country nuked America they would nuke that country. Also you would have a Pearl Harbor effect where nationalism would rise and millions of Americans would sign up to fight with the rush of patriotism.
With the way Russia has been behaving we should be helping Ukraine. This is one military that needs soldiers for sure. 
That doesn't mean Christopher Li would stop Android from using Google in the name. Google Pay replacing Android Pay made it crystal clear that Android as a brand is out the door. The Android messages brand was killed, Android Pay killed for Google Pay and now Android Wear. Android is dead and Christopher Li isn't going to stop it.
It really isn't and Fuchsia is enough proof of that Android and its name is the past. Google is rebranding everything as Google and saying Chrome OS guys wouldn't allow it is to use Google in the name literally made me laugh out loud. I didn't know they were calling shots for Google...

Also the plan is to have a unified OS for phones, tablets and desktops/laptops.

They are killing off the Android brand so keeping half the name makes sense. 
This is great and further shows that what was branded as Android isn't limited to Android. By ditching the Android name it makes it clear Google branded products are compatible both with iPhone and Android. I wouldn't be shocked if the Android name disappears all together especially with fuschia os waiting to replace it.

He chose the route that was not advised by doctors. He had a excellent chance of survival with the cancer he had but he thought eating healthy would cure it which is dumb. No real doctor would tell you to avoid a great chance of surviving. 

He admitted he was stupid and wrong.

It is like how how smelling bad isn't illegal as well as being next to people so they have to smell your shit. Again all you are doing is annoying people for no reason other than getting reactions from people.

It is just not okay to allow yourself to lose your cool and assault someone. I get it, he is kicking the divider but a part of me thinks the kid is telling the truth that he was treated like an animal before hand. Even if not true there is no excuse for punching someone in the face. Use more restraints and the description says he was punished.
He deserved to get his ass kicked.
This a video of a private residence, how is this public? 
Lol, why did someone down vote the mirror?

Such a good boy!
Smart but also dumb. He decided that eating just fruit would make the cancer go away and the kind of cancer he had had a high success rate when operated on early. Jobs made the stupid choice and it lead to his early death.

You can't delete your account fully immediately is what the website says. That takes 30 days.
You can't start a trip without a proper payment method and obviously the trip was started. They have to have a record of it.
Is that a sewage water treatment plant?
That is incorrect. Uber has the copy of the waybill(receipt) which has the full name and information of the rider. The website also says it keeps the information and your account isn't fully deleted until 30 days.

Big stars now are doing tv shows so it wouldn't be beneath Will Smith to be featured.  
You really do though. What does it mean to be a bright beyond being able to use a magic wand, what roles do elves exactly play world wide and do they control the US or the world, who is the dark lord and how was he killed since they will need magic again to kill him when he comes back? There are a lot of things unexplained and the back stories give it structure to build upon the foundation.
I think they planed to make a series on this from the beginning. The biggest thing missing is the explanation of the past and back stories to get a better understanding of this world where magic exists. This movie built a foundation and I cant wait for sequel.

T-Mobile already does this as well as AT&T with sponsored data when supposedly net neutrality was law.
Duh, I give Google my information completely willingly since Google can customize things just for me. Their AI will also be more relevant to me.

Google is all about data, that has never been a secret. To have an AI that is smart and useful information is needed to fit each person uniquely so I am fine with the trade I have to make.

I just said that because the Pixel 2 doesn't offer much over the first. I quite pleased with  my Pixel XL
Doesn't the pixel 1 have always listening? It always listens to my voice so I figured what difference would it be for it to listen to music since it already listens.
Since you have the Pixel 2 how useful is Google Lens? I loved google on tap when my phone could scan my screen and do actions like make a calendar event just by scanning. The assistant now can't do it.

The always listening for music feature is one thing

I mean features like telling me what song is playing always or is that hardware dependent?
They didn't say it specifically but focusing on the Android experience with apps working on a laptop(pixel book) demonstrates their direction. Maybe they will copy Microsoft and have the keyboard be removable. My biggest hope is we start seeing desktop level apps like Photoshop showing up on the playstore because you have a beast of a machine that is the Pixel book.

Is 50 hrs enough lol
They can easily go over 24 hours
In other words it's a waste of space, it would be like buying a DVD/vhs player. Sure you could always keep old tech alive but this is step forward in just focusing USB C and Bluetooth.
Several reasons like you can get better quality sound since most phones have their own power amplifiers built into them which boosts the sound loud enough to hear. Going without means headphone manufacturers could build better quality headphone amplifiers that are built  into the headphones. If you don't believe me look it up as to the drawbacks of headphone jacks on Google.

The headphone jack is dead, it takes up space that the phone could use for something else.. Maybe they will one day they will put two USB C cord slots but right now even one has the potential for better sound and more space for something more important.   
You know what isn't hard, making vhs tape players forever because I already have them... Said my grandma
Why would I need a dongle?
Bluetooth head phones can last 24 hrs plus, just have that charged and charge your phone on a plane. It isn't hard to charge a Bluetooth headset, the cable is light so it shouldn't be too hard to move a cable and plug into charge.   

You can find cheap Bluetooth headphones that don't sound shitty. I got a 20 dollar wireless earphone that sounded better than my Bose plug in earphone.
You could have said the same for any old tech being replaced like not getting DVDs because you have vhs. Phone makers as a whole are doing this so you will have to suck it up one day. Lol, having to charge another device isn't hard, is the cable to heavy and wears you out moving it a couple inches to charge?
Then buy a Bluetooth and plug your phone into the wall. Like I said, Bluetooth is the new standard and you can charge your phone while using Bluetooth. I know people get upset with changes but most people are fine with this otherwise phone sales would be down which is not the case.
Are you sitting near an electric outlet while listening? Listening to audio books eats a very small amount of battery life. Also the Bluetooth headphones can last over 24 hrs of continuous use. How are you you loosing that much battery power, you might have something wrong with the phone
Who charges their phone and listens to music at the same time using the headphone jack? I've never done that since I would have to sit down near the plug in. That just makes no sense, I've never seen anyone do that.
Because Bluetooth and USB c should be the new standard. I don't know why people can't just accept the new technology. Bluetooth headphones now have long lasting battery lives. 
Duh, but a tiny amount from all of Europe. It's sad Europe can not do tech and are beaten by 2/3 world countries.

All you can do is beg us Americans or our companies to pay attention to you. We don't need you lol. Go buy an Opo that runs Google services :)
The EU controls most of Europe as of the moment, which non EU country are you thinking of that is being ignored. Also those rules are insane and they have a huge pending case with the EU. I wouldn't want to do business with the EU. The UK is smart leaving such a draconian union. To fit the laws Google has do a different business model so it isn't worth it really. I know Europe is mad that silicon valley is succeeding but their own tech businesses are shit and can't compete without these laws to protect them.  
The problem Google has with Europe is they want Google to bend the knee and kiss the EU's ass. They want to tax them extremely high and force them to not be like Google in America. I don't blame Google, I wouldn't want to do business with Europe. Just look at court cases against them. 
Like I said it has been done, example being Amazon. Look at how well that went for them for their phone/tablet...

I would say that about the whole regional airline business. It doesn't take much mistakes for a plane to crash because of simple mistakes that can occur from paying employees who don't give a damn for about 12 dollars an hour. I get to take to all the different kind of people from other airlines they don't give a fuck either. Regional airlines I would say is not the safest way to fly especially with the planes I work with which are Q400's. They actually have different regulations for the regional side meaning they get to slack off from the regulations they don't have to abide by for continental flights.
Are you at SeaTac?
Every rampers I talked which was a lot they say they were not making 15 at least not until recently within the last several months. They did funny math by saying the benefits they give count towards your "pay" including health benefits.
I know for all the times I have talked to rampers  for Menzies they do not make over 15 and do not get flight benefits while at Horizon we do. Also I get to have rampers load while verify being the last one to touch the plane and even push the plane out when I feel like it.
Yes, I'm talking about the rampers and for the longest time they said they couldn't push planes out to the run way and didn't have flight benefits. I don't work for Menzies but the several times I have we have it much nicer since I can push a flight and just have a loader. We get flight benefits which may have very recently changed for rampers at Menzies but I have not heard that. I'm speaking for us on the tarmac actually facing the elements and being the last people to touch the plane before flight

Also look at the legal fight Alaska has been about the $15 dollar an hour law. Where do you work? I work as a flight operator for Horizon so I am on at setac if you want me to show ya personally.
I work for Alaska out on the tarmac and the corners they cut with the regional jets scare me. Baggage claimers are subcontracted out to Menzies for their non regional flights which also scares me. These people do not give a f*** and still get paid less than McDonalds workers at the food court because the $15 dollars an hour law doesn't apply to aerospace workers.

Youtube makes money based on people’s engagement with the ad.  Engagement means clicking or watching an ad for more than 30 seconds. YouTube Advertising is managed in their Adwords platform. Advertisers choose ads on a Cost Per Click (CPC) or Cost Per View (CPV) model. There is also Google's black box algorithm. Advertisers also choose the demographics and care for PR reasons what the content is.
Also content quality matters when it comes to price of an ad. That is why the super bowl costs so much.
Of course, I said demographics count which I said and you also said you don't care but you do.
First you are forgetting PR and in your first couples sentences matches what I said. First you said you don't care and then go on to say  you do care about audience quality and proper demographics... Wtf, you are just arguing semantics lol 
YouTube isn't deciding what to show, advertisers are. Advertisers want their ads to be placed on videos they approve of just like tv, not what is dictated by Google. It's all about advertising, the tv, newspaper, the internet it's all relative.
Views are not equal. Quality videos get shared and have longer screen time watched than videos of some dude shaving his hair. Many videos are labeled incorrectly so finding the right video to advertise means a lot. Finding shit content is easy but finding content worth advertising dollars is hard. That is why SuperBowl ads cost more than say a rerun of power rangers or even why TV shows go off the air.
You might not fit their demographic which is something advertisers care about a lot. Not all views are equal.
Advertisers do care which video is watched more because videos that get liked and shared have a better chance for a customer than someone who clicked on a video and didn't like it or immediately went to another video. That is why shows on TV like the superbowl make advertisers pay big time vs paying for advertising on a rerun of Adventure Times. Cookies also play part. It really shouldn't be that hard to understand. Better content on tv or the internet means more revenue while crappy content with low viewership and lower watched screen time get no revenue or very little.   
Ever watch the movie 300? Battling in a tiny space makes your numbers meaningless.
Advertisers will pay for what gets them the most customers so no one gives a shit about  a unique channel. People are free to try to get advertising money from else where but YouTube is only going to pay those who the advertisers says so.
No, it's a waste advertising on low rated material. It's just like TV show ratings, advertisers want to spend their money on content they think will bring in more customers. The more popular the content the more expensive it is to advertise. So that is why no advertiser would pay money to be apart of stupid video no cares about much especially if that is not the demographic they are looking for.
Most channels are boring. Advertisers don't want to put their ads on smalls channels or channels they don't like for specific reasons. You can't blame YouTube for what advertisers want. 
I downloaded the apk and it works perfectly with messaging in the US on my Pixel
As Sagen said in the video he did this all by using the human mind which is the incredible part. Your scenario won't work since day and night would not match what happened in real life if the sun was in the position you said it was. Same with having seasons.
We know the sun is not closer by measuring gravity. The moon would not exist and our GPS system would never work. Also the earth could not hold an atmosphere if it were so close. The earth would be like mercury or venus if what closer.
You still have to pay for the food that gives you life and the energy enough to push the car along with the taxes to pay for the street to push the car on
You have to pay someone for the gas...
Yes just like how can't get a free car wash since you are paying for the gas to get there :)
We are not talking about the burger but the fris.

They are free, you paid for the burger and you choose the free option for fris. Free is free.
Nope, you are just idiot who doesn't know free add-ons is a thing. Like when you purchase a big Mac and the deal gives you free fries. It's deal right now which might not be the case later. 
You pay for the YouTube red app or subscription. You can redeem free Google Music streaming or you could not. It's a free add on that must sign up for. You could just pay for Google Music for 10 dollars. You are just arguing semantics so I'm done troll.
Project Ara was not going to work in a world where advances come so quickly. Modular products are not immune to tech advances, it is a terrible way of trying to keep old tech running like a Frankenstein monster.
YouTube red gives you free Google music. YouTube red costs 10 dollars, is that hard to understand?
Too much of anything will kill you, that isn't news. The video says 80% of our food has added sugar but I would bet the numbers have changed one way or the other. This video is just pointless and has nothing new, just old information.
No ad's and free Google Music streaming is a hell of a deal for 10 bucks
I am saying the research for this video is dated, new studies have come out so this video is completely based off what we knew before 2012. 5 years is a long time.
This is from 2012 so the science is a bit dated
Google should just buy it out, take the good and throw away the bad. Like Motorola.

They have even gone further by putting small tv screens on the pump that plays ads lol
Yep, you also get a discount if you choose cash over credit

You park in the space for the pump then pay and pump after you pay.

All messaging through those apps will be unified with Google Assistant to allow Google assisant access to apps and controls. I assume one day you will be able to say an app name and also perform a function. Like telling youtube to lower the volume or go to the next video.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_compensation

Motion compensation exploits the fact that, often, for many frames of a movie, the only difference between one frame and another is the result of either the camera moving or an object in the frame moving. In reference to a video file, this means much of the information that represents one frame will be the same as the information used in the next frame.

What are you accomplishing here? These girls are ugly and you still couldn't get them with your ugly mug? People have the right to discriminate about looks, no one should be forced to be with someone ugly like yourself.
Then god created free will which includes babies getting cancer or starving to death. If god could do anything he made it a possibility for horrible things to happen including be raped. If god is all knowing and has endless powers suffering is something he created. This would mean god is evil and is the same as the devil, cruel and wicked. Also god supposedly intervenes and makes miracles happen so why stop there and save everyone with miracles. God just doesn't give a shit and just wants people to worship him and for you to be gods slave.
You must be a Deo user :)
Of course Deo users are not going to be happy, they want Deo to be unbalanced because that is the deck they are using lol
Everyone died including the phone so that is why there is no footage after this
Also if you do any research you would find what I am saying to be true but I can find nothing besides your opinion that you are saying what is true. Just look at featured duels right now. The Deo deck is there in multiple games day after day. The developers know the usage rates and having been nerfing pokemon from the start. Look how they listened about Riunucleus. Setting a 3 Deo limit would help.
Too far? You are the first person I've ever heard who says devolpers went too far lol. I don't run a Deo deck but I use attack Deo to stop other attack Deo. A lot of people now have there decks made specifically just to counter just one kind of deck build. No other deck build achieved this status or even close.
No, but he did have others in his administration that helped Hoover become one of the worst presidents ever. Also Hoover did nothing to help the problem besides setting up a blue ribbon committee.
It's not appealing to the hive mind, it is simply recognizing the fact that Deo Decks are common with 3k players. Even the team that works on Pokemon Duel recognizes it by giving buffs or not too long ago they needed attack Deo with a wait time. I'm curious what source of information is telling you that you are right. 

So far it just seems like your only opinion but others are wrong because you just know? You just have no idea what you are talking about which is obvious since you have nothing to back up your claim. I can back mine up by the feedback posted and also the nerfs and buffs that are focused on the Deo deck.
You are thinking of Hoover 
It's not just me, this whole subreddit sees the same but for some odd reason you believe otherwise. Yeah so I'm going to believe that because you see it in this subreddit daily. Also the benching is not all a negative, I use attack deo and it is nice to shake off special conditions.

Also just looking at the featured duels, you see the top ranked people often run the deo deck.
Roosevelt and Coolidge we're pretty good Republicans
How is it out of meta? When you play 3k games you see a lot of Deo decks which is also reflected when you look at the top players deck or watch featured duels. The buff to Ray doesn't destroy deo decks especially when they carry 2 Cosmo plates now. They should take away respin and that would solve the problem entirely. 
He didn't see it as his divine right to rule, if he had he would have never abdicated the throne. He wanted what was best but he never knew what  the best was. He was so ignorant of the problems he was facing that he put himself and family in harm's way by accepting exile in the same country that wanted him out of power. By remaining he created a possibility of coming back to power which Lenin would not allow to happen. He should have tried to stay king or left the country. 
Deo D getting burned helps

It's bad when the initial audio source is not copied but instead a playback is recorded. Also there is a difference between the quality of audio when you listen from the audio source straight on your ear vs the quality of hearing the same audio on speaker mode. Basically two factors can come into play but the further you go from the original audio you can hear the worse the audio will be. You can see the copy effect with YouTube videos when you make a copy of copy the degradation gets worse and worse.

Despite this, in the years before the war, Italy had enhanced its diplomatic relationships with the United Kingdom and France. This was because the Italian government had grown convinced that support of Austria (the traditional enemy of Italy during the 19th century Risorgimento) would not gain Italy the territories it wanted: Trieste, Istria, Zara and Dalmatia, all Austrian possessions. In fact, a secret agreement signed with France in 1902 sharply conflicted with Italy's membership in the Triple Alliance.
Italy was against Germany in WW1, on the allies side

Lol I don't work for metro PC's, just showed their prices compared to Google as an example
I am not trolling, it is ridiculous what Google is charging.
I said cheap not the cheapest. It's price point is just as expensive as most MVNO's.
How much data do you use?
How much do you pay after taxes and fees?
https://www.metropcs.com/shop/plans
$30 including fees and taxes with 2 gb
Plus the tax which is not included which might make it more expensive than the 30 dollar plan which includes all fees and taxes 
Metro PCS: $30 a month, 1GB 4G LTE, including fees.
Boost Mobile: $30 a month with auto-pay, 2GB 4G LTE.
Cricket Wireless: $30 a month with 1GB 4G LTE, $60 a month for unlimited high speed data

These are MNVO's which Fi is aswell so they plan is not cheap
How much they charge for each GB versus what other companies charge per GB
No one is complaining about the voice part, just the data offering.
Says who? I doubt Google would say this is the customers they are looking for. Do you know how little people travel internationally?
Google would make the same money Metro PCS makes
The data mined from Fi service should be incentive enough. Google would make the same money Metro PCS makes.
Exactly
The big phone companies have their own MNVO's like Metro PCS and Cricket

How can this generate more power going out than in?
No it doesn't. Just do the math on EX drop rate vs the pool you can get and that number is still very very tiny.
Lol, you are talking about increasing the pool by just a handful of Pokemon. Your chances probably increase by less than a half of a percent or even less
There is always going to be a loophole for any method of rooting out cheaters. No perfect system can be drawn up but at least discouraging this method will reduce cheaters numbers as a whole

I only call when I get to the stop and don't see the person. Calling while driving is a distraction and something I try to avoid. 
I actually kind of like this trippy design. I'm sure in person the stairs wouldn't pose a problem going up or down.
Drivers need to be able to call to determine where a person is. When you are picking up someone from an apartment for example the driver will need to call the rider since more often than not the rider doesn't come out to see if the car is there or the address they gave doesn't give the drive the exact apartment number. Drivers need the ability to call since there is no other way to communicate.

When you use Uber as a customer you never get that person's actual phone number, you get a temporary number. The driver also does not have the customers phone number because it too is a temporary number so both parties never can obtain each others real number.

How is Uber allowed to have their app work if what they are doing is illegal? If they got approval to do business than nothing is illegal here and you get a receipt on your phone after the ride. 
I had a Nexus 6 for almost 2 years before switching to the Pixel XL and I don't care as much about dual front speakers than I did. I thought I would regret my choice but that never happened because of how many things you miss out on by having a slow phone. The sound from the phone is crisp and loud  while being instantly fast. Some people will say "oh, just use this rom and it will be like having a new phone", it is a lie. I have had multiple Nexus 6's along with several of my friends and the lag can never be gotten rid of. If you say the is no lag just try this phone and see for yourself which one is more responsive. The Nexus 6 was good but it's like having bike vs a car to me. 
I started about 6 months ago.
Not during the first several months when I started. Several months went by including gyms with no update.
Honestly at the time no Pokemon was getting stat balanced so it made sense to me at the time to get rid of it because I would never use it.
I just simply used it for xp for another Pokemon :(
I have learned for a while to hold on to every Pokemon you get with these stat changes. I got rid of two Empoleon's back when its attack was garbage even with buffs.
No, I just think you believe that but don't know what you are talking about.
Alphabet was a massive restructuring which I am guessing you did not know. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc. Also this is the first set of products coming out made by Google like the Pixel inside and out. It takes time for growth.
They care, why do you think all of sudden they are going retail making their own phones and home IOT? Alphabet owns Google meaning that their focus is beyond just what Google search money comes in. Look at what happened with YouTube with the advertising controversy, Alphabet knows it can't just be a one trick pony since so much is at risk.
I'm sorry, no company Google sized is lacking manpower. If it was just as simple to need more people to put out a good product Google would pay for that easily.
The two are not mutually exclusive. They have teams working on all sorts of projects so it isn't like these experiments stop Google at all from bettering Android's messaging services.

I love pushing these planes to the runway.
Depending on the match up I use long throw to block out. If I get pushed I have goal block and heatran can surround if the opponent forgets that I can surround.  
Well this team has gotten me to within the top 1500 for the month

> Can you take video of the Nexus 6 running, opening apps along with trying to take a HDR photo. Every Nexus 6 I have seen stutters.


That is boring as hell. Why would someone watch a lizard lightly lick a corner of a box

My thinking exactly
Your maps show most states you can only a few you can't...
Guess I am just unlucky. I did everything even trying customs roms and factory resetting the phone. Still lagged and it took a bit of time to process just taking a simple picture with HDR on.
Well if technology keeps getting faster of course I would say that. I could have gotten the 6p but it wasn't all that different besides a fingerprint sensor and in my opinion would have been a downgrade. This phone just blaze's especially the camera. I like to run heavy apps like games and it's like day and night.
You know the difference when talking pictures. The Nexus 6 is the Stone age in the camera department.
So your phone never hiccups? It never happened all the time but time to time the phone would stutter. I couldn't take it any longer and the Pixel is way quicker than even day one Nexus 6. 
What about waiting for the Pixel 2? I couldn't wait but I am all in on Google so the iPhone is not even an option for me.
Max revive, long throw, full heal and attack +30
Metagross is slow but he stops Deoxys spins and Reuniclus spins. He is worth his weight in gold with that alone. I use him a defender near my goal normally with a Magikarp who can evolve on my goal so it takes multiple attacks to take the goal. Also storm can be very helpful for goal defending. I attack with Zapdos and Yveltal but also rely on winning matchups my opponents choose so I can move where I want on my turn after knocking stuff out of my way.
Latios and long throw. I try to bring out all my Pokemon and win the match ups and surround what I can. I normally let the enemy attack me so I can move after I win when I win which I do a lot since I upgraded a few of my pokemon like Zapdos thunder attack to 101
Just posted the team, forgot to include the second shot sorry

Here are the minimum jail times for an OWI/DUI in Michigan, broken out by whether this is your first, second, or third offense:

1st offense: No minimum jail term required
2nd offense: 5 days jail or 30 days community service
3rd offense: 30 days jail

> contempt of court

The offense of being disobedient to or disrespectful of a court of law and its officers. So just acting up or pissing of the judge is enough.


http://www.rotlaw.com/legal-library/what-does-it-mean-to-be-held-in-contempt-of-court/

Failing to obey an order of the court (as long as that order was lawful), showing disrespect for the judge or others in the courtroom, including violent behavior, disrupting the court’s proceedings with noise or other “acting up”, or publishing material likely to prevent one of the parties from receiving a fair trial.
Jesus christ, I am talking about the person who laughed and got jail. Meaning people who get a DUI can go to prison for a shorter time than a laughing woman. Goldfish?
Watch the video again, before she says words directly to the judge the judge already said she was going to be held in contempt. Are you a gold fish? Even the judge says if anyone wants to smile or laugh can get the same punishment...
http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/washington-dui-dwi-33633.html
First Offense
Second Offense
Third Offense
One day jail, 15 days electronic home monitoring (EHM), or 30 days in a “24/7 Sobriety Program”  (if BAC is less than .15%); two days jail, 30 days EHM, or 120 days in a 24/7 program (if BAC is .15% or greater or driver refused to submit to a breath or blood test)
30 days jail (if BAC is less than .15%); 45 days jail (if BAC is .15% or greater or driver refused to submit to a breath or blood test)
90 days jail (if BAC is less than .15%); 120 days jail (if BAC is .15% or greater or driver refused to submit to a breath or blood test)
She laughed and the judge deemed that it was contempt, so she got jail for laughing... How hard is that to understand lol.
You are getting down votes and I may as well but you are right. A week in jail at max for a stupid interruption. People are in jail for a shorter time than a DUI. Jesus you down others are insane. 
This will be buried but I would like to see the after picture put back for real. For all we know the first picture is the one to be wowed by.

It's not, I have the same condition.

Hydrogen fuel can come from green energy sources and then stays clean without a carbon footprint. If you produced a lot of green energy it seems like clean hydrogen would be better than a dirty batteries. 
Using a "natural battery" sounds like the way to go.
Couldn't we use the electricity to create hydrogen fuel and use power that way? No dirty batteries needed.

Google is going to put Allo on every Android phone they can and eventually as people trade or get rid of their phones Allo numbers will rise. iMessage I think got its greatness not by effort but just simply being included as one of the main apps you have bundled when you get the phone.
My first thought exactly

Google just chooses the quickest way from point a to b. I wasn't there obviously but Google had some reason to think this was the fastest way at the time. How old is your map app? It tells you that you are in the fastest route.
The line breaks are great, there is structure to it.
i did

Taking the features from Google Goggles I think would be an easy translation.
Seems like taking a cue from google goggles app it seems like it would be easy but I am not a programer.
Yeah that is like one work day
It's just $10 
Or get YouTube Red from your google music subscription and you never have to worry about not being able to play a video in the background again.
I loved pushing this plane out to the runway on a daily basis
It rolls out stupid. America first. Jesus you're an idiot
Yes the release is to a small number not the whole world but advertising and updates comes first to Americans.

Notice the release dates as America is first or close.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_7 at least here some countries got to recieve the first day. 

Apple is US centric just like any company that has their main headquarters in any country. Now that China is the biggest market they are getting the same treatment almost as America.
We have the best companies and militarily would beat anyone so stop me when I am wrong :)
A bad name? American companies cater to Americans like Chinese cater to the Chinese. You have to be an idiot to think otherwise and you should just complain your country lag behind enough to not have a company give you what you want.
That was only one carrier out of many and we always get updates first, our media is sometimes not available to you because you don't live in the best country(USA) and most of the time you will have to wait for services like. Every company focuses on its biggest market especially by revenue not just people since poor people don't help revenue much. So poor countries are not on the top since you can't bring in the same revenue. How about you make your country stop sucking?
https://www.statista.com/statistics/382288/geographical-region-share-of-revenue-of-apple/ You can see how stupid you are lol
https://www.statista.com/statistics/382288/geographical-region-share-of-revenue-of-apple/
Seeing Americas show you still still Europe, Asia and every other continent gets things and priority last. Canada being in the America's is what you are also seeing but their market is small.
Europe is second class along with China. The US will always get exclusives and new features first. We are the US what do you expect, we are number one!

Jesus just do a google search
Same with Apple. Every company where it is located is where they focus first. Features and all. Apple's main concern is the US and they are their biggest market and will tailor their brand for American consumers. Everyone else can have what's left after America gets done eating first. What company doesn't focus on its biggest most important market?

We are though. We are first for practically anything, we are their biggest consumer and we never miss out on anything google while other countries have to wait if they are lucky. You are crazy to think Google's most important market is not in its own country.
They can but the US is top priority 
Google is a US company...

Rank choice voting forces you to vote for people who you don't want to win so it isn't a fix of any kind. Where I live we had ranked choice voting and after a couple years people saw it didn't help and just created situations no one wanted so we got rid of it thankfully.

There is 2 year age difference so they are both grown ups
The problem is police should check your history and you should be classified as paedophile because of what you admit. You have a problem and that makes you blind to the fact you are wrong and need to monitored at all times. 
Come on, this is just fair, legal strategy. Trump reaches out to people who he thinks can help him and Clinton does the same.
I was lucky to be in squad that won those exclusive awards at the end of the nuermos war. I remember also being one of the first to get all the parts with the lotto system. Playing the Japanese was great fun since their builds and techniques were way different sometimes.
Actually it is warning if you have baby because if the child can get near it could put its fingers in the shredder.
Perfect!
There are so many rampers hired by airlines they are never a reason a flight is delayed. ATC holds, weather, flight crew delays, maintenance delays and traffic are the reasons why.

They only attack the writer and ignore the content. So they can't disprove the research?
Its working
Yeah and I think he brought up some good points when it comes to medical business in general where hospitals get away with exorbitant costs as well but they don't get dragged through the mud.
My thoughts exactly. Good thing I know I guess.
It works for me for the most part. Snags are infrequent and I would say a lot better than when it was  almost unusable for me like a year and half ago.

The thing is though I don't think it is a great thing to throw out as evidence since 97% of scientists(natural philosophy) or probably higher thought the world was flat at one time.
At first I thought it was a mascot from the thumbnail

Friedman advocated policies such as a volunteer military, freely floating exchange rates, abolition of medical licenses, a negative income tax, and school vouchers. So you like the idea of giving money to people who earn under a certain wage?
Why should it be that way? Because Friedman says so?
Vote with your money? With no regulation you would have monopolies so you couldn't.
So you want private corporations you can't vote for or against to take over the military, making laws and deciding where to pave roads or have tolls on the roads? No regulation means food manufacturers have to follow nothing, no law. If someone gets mad cow it's okay because next time they will just try harder not to make it happen since there is no penalty.

Yes, because government can never do anything right but let's give power to those who can kill us by having no regulation...
A way to beat the retaker is to have a lot of revives and if they take the gym back don't use potions but only revives. If you have a strong enough Pokémon you can keep killing the Pokémon they put in the gym which needs to be at full life. Let them take it and just keep using those revives since they are so easy to get.
Reading books cure cancer, cure hunger and any other problem that exists. There is no way that the lifestyle that leads to reading books is why. I saw someone who couldn't walk before pick up a book and started walking. Amazing /s
R/conservative Is a joke. Concerned with abortions, pants suits and making Obama out to be a Muslim. This is why you conservatives are called ignorant red necks because this subreddit is playing up to the caricature. How about attacking liberal policy because caring about controlling a woman's body to that degree reminds me of Muslims who also force women to cover up and behave like the good women they think they should be...
Abortions? Why does r/conservative care about abortions?
http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/08/04/obama_wsj_manufacturing_outrage_iran_cash_only_a_story_because_it_sounds_like_a_crime_novel.html

It was, people are just know figuring it out since they didn't pay attention to it before. That isn't Obama's fault if people can't keep up with the events.
Why would they not help him? Do they not know how to swim either?
This is BS and you are lying. Let me get this straight. Amazon says they can't help them you can't get ahold of them by being transferred and the order number can't be found and the police aren't responding either. Lie, lie and another lie lol.
They can figure it out by get figuring out who was scheduled to be at the stop for the delivery and match the person to the truck or vehicle used.
They can figure at who by who was scheduled to be at that stop. Companies have records and that package or whatever he dropped of has a number attached to it.
I must have a glitch then cause I don't see it
It has its own sensor so it definitely makes it worth it.
Quaker something
Yeah, they are starting now to go outside of America. Did you miss that part?
It is an American company so that makes sense unless you live in the US.
I think it is worth bombing Britain depending on your game. They had air superiority on both the English Channel and southern England. I used my u boats to stop any convoy going in or out which had a good effect weakening them. I also use my strategic bombers to keep bombing them to make them weaker messing up their infrastructure. I then did a combination of naval invasion and paratroopers to secure southern England and London so I can get the improve national spirit focus. I'm still battling this battle but the strategic bombers really helped slowing down the UK trying to reinforce areas I was attacking since their infrastructure was completely gone.
If the ground is flat like some parts of Russia you can steam roll right through the Russian lines but if the ground is not clear and it is hilly tanks are not completely useless but they are but a shell of what they used to be worth
I do something similar but I also create police/guards to hold land and if needed to oppress up risings.
Lol, so every group that forms around person somehow represents every supporter?
But you don't get all the states by just taking a couple states on main land Europe.
I can imagine someone warning the person in charge and just responding by saying"I just enough dynamite to not make that happen".
Well Newton believed he was a new scientific messiah that god was revealing to the truth to and no one else. He just pretty much saw himself as god. Also he believed the bible was to trick people from knowing the truth he knew.
About 200 hours and yes, this game is worth it

This guy needs to be in jail.
What is bad about the TPP? It seems like a great deal for America.
The think is leftists especially young one support gun rights too. Just look at how many people who supported Sanders even though the NRA praised him. Another group is to blame.
Well what if due process happens at the same time?
Words mean nothing when actions mean everything. If you believe in an idea all men should be free you wouldn't deny that and you wouldn't be controlled by it. It is really that simple and shows how much he cared by not taking action especially when he was president.
He was talking about the German AI
Like a Kroger's or a Fred Meyer store
That does not matter, still a slave holder and did not try to abolish it like Lincoln. The allowed it to exist, grow and spread across the country.
He was a president so why didn't he try to do what Lincoln did? He could have fought against slavery but he did not as the president or even after.
In his will he let some slaves go and so he kept slaves on. That is not debunked. He was a slaveholder who had an affair with a slave and let that family go....
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson_and_slavery

He let one slave family go but kept the others as slaves so you were wrong\
How was he and what law? Black people could become freemen if he wanted that to happen because that was his choice, to be able to let them go...
if there was some sort of record of him being involved at any level with ISIS or some other radical group before the attack I would agree with you but I haven't seen any. 
How do you have 1000 army experience alongside other experiences?
The Orlando shooter was just an American who was nuts. He grew up here, had a rough time in school and he beat women he went out with. Yes he did swear allegiance to ISIS but that wasn't until he was shooting people. The guy was nuts and had zero connection to the middle east. 
Well that too is written so we're the forefathers wrong on trusting judges?
Yet he kept slaves while others did not...
Do you know how hard it is to pass an amendment? Also guess who wrote the rules on how hard it is to pass an amendment. It is great way to silence a minority over a minority.

He doesn't have a plan for it though. All he says is he makes the 'best' deals. Best this, best that but nothing of substance. Has he demonstrated once how he would make the best deals? 
I got my pizza easy. I just clicked on the deal and the domino coupon was automatically entered.
There were people back then who didn't keep slaves and that notion wasn't super rare. These founding fathers didn't know slavery was going to end and it didn't end for almost 100 years after the document was signed so no, they didn't. The founding fathers thought of themselves as special and they kept slaves instead of being like others and being a good example. Our found fathers were racist and misogynist no doubt about it. Thinking has changed and now we are much better but not thanks to our founding fathers. If it was so important to them they would have lead the anti slavery cause but they didn't, failed leadership. They also didn't the common man was able and thankfully that is not the case anymore when a rich person can't just call the shots as much like own a slave or treating women like property .
https://youtu.be/TJWL9YaZ3C0 this is what happens at night, beware.
As the forefathers were not perfect in wisdom(having and being okay with slavery and not letting women vote) is there a chance they were wrong about a well armed militia which technically could mean any sort of device as self defense device? The forefathers did see wisdom that they may be wrong by allowing the Constitution to be changed in future. If you add up almost all the Western countries who had guns then banned have a much lower homicide rate with a much higher population, you have to wonder how guns are making everything safer? Gun aren't like alcohol, most people like a drink every once in awhile but most people don't own guns and people can't get addicted to using a gun. Confiscation of guns makes sense if your goal is safety. The process could be very systematic and even if you miss some guns attaching long prison terms to gun owners breaking the law guns over time would evaporate like what happened in other countries even counting for population size. Yes it make take longer for confiscation since there are a lot of guns but over time the threat would match the same level as other countries that have less gun murder rates. It's hard to ignore facts and that our forefathers were imperfect but also allowed us the ability to change the Constitution which is just as patriotic as anything from the Constitution. Why do you think the forefathers were wrong with ability to change the Constitution?
Enjoy your youtube unemployment soon
It is also possible that the layout change was a coincidence and you are wrongly thinking the change caused your channel death. There is no point arguing, your viewership is gone because people are not looking for your videos anymore. Other channel have survived long stretches but the audience changes and you lost. Bye 
Do you see that drop that happened 2/23/13? What caused that bigger drop? This graph shows the ups and downs and eventually the down won out. 
Because people stopped watching you while other people continue to views. You are trying to make up some excuse that YouTube is the cause of your problem but the simple truth is people stopped watching you on purpose. Why is that so hard to accept? 
They have but many don't watch anymore. A lot of people just didn't go through the effort of unsubscribing and just stopped watching.
When you subscribe to so many channels the amount of notifications you would get on your phone would be insane so you tend to shut of youtube notifications and youtube emails filling your inbox.
Obviously people don't think you are that great or you wouldn't be in the position you are now...
When my and friends want to watch some youtube videos on microwaving something we only cared about seeing the microwave not some dude talking about other shit that is not the microwave doing shit. Also if he is so great it should have been easy to move on and advertise for the new channel but it shows that I guess people were only there for the microwave not the "witty banter''.
You get notifications too when new videos come out but you can turn those off so that is also what people probably did with you. I am also subscribed to a lot of channels and I would hate it if I go to youtube and just get spammed by channels that I could click on my own if I wanted too. You got use to free marketing which is now gone, tough luck and evolve. Might have to open your wallet to advertise if it matters. 
YouTube doesn't have to do your marketing for you lol
You give the impression you receiving some great injustice and YouTube doesn't have to abide your idea of trying to make it easy for you to launch a new idea or concept. You can create a new channel if you think new channels get better exposure or whatever you think is the best strategy but if your content is good and people want to watch it people will find it and keep watching. When they get watch a channel or channels all they have the option to stop watching or if they are inclined continue. The viewership drop off is simply due to people who don't enjoy your content, simple as that otherwise they would keep watching. Just look at those channel who had to use a second and third channel because they got false copyright claims and they were able to keep their viewership(h3h3) because people sought their content out. 
You talked about how long you have been there as if the age of your channel matters

Lots of people microwave shit, it was nothing special or unique. 
The more we do the more they will keep having fuel for suicide bombers for the US. If not they bomb each other for religion and other shit. Let's just leave the hell hole and drone down who ever we like with out putting a person in harm.
Exactly, this guy seems so entitled. YouTube has grown and people prefer new content and you act like it is not your fault. It's why TV shows don't last forever even if characters or writers change. Just because you were on YouTube early doesn't mean you should be treated differently as if seniority matters in entertainment...
Lol, yup! Guess r/conservative is for Hillary... wtf
How is this Conservative? News flash there are many employees out there who don't like their bosses managerial skills...
My Nexus 6 has the perfect bezel to screen ratio, front facing speakers and is still fast with a really decent camera. I will be able to keep this phone easily for another year.
They are using the laws given and the interpretation is clear that it is legal. You have to change the law because it is insane to all of sudden start ignoring laws laws because of an individual moral code.
The title should include that these Christians are Middle Eastern converts who are being persecuted by their own people and that is the full extent. This is happening all the time to many religions so why is this news? It's not like it is news that a lot of Middle Eastern countries are fucked up along with some of it's people.
If you watch the video posted in another comment there is metal fencing trapping him inside which you really can't see with this gif

Owe for what? The trip, the DNA test? Yes, they pay for the whole trip, whatever that owes.
They don't get paid to be on. Expenses are paid for the travel and hotel but that is it.
Just need some radaway to fix that up
because he is a communist!!!!??!? lol, are you stuck in the cold war era because what specifically do you dislike of Bernie Sanders? I doubt you would be taxed more than you are right now unless I am talking to a millionaire right now?
Lol, slavery... come on. Slavery is the hospital charging 100 dollars for a stupid band aid. The health insurance business and hospital board members love the system we have because they can basically charge anything and you have to accept it. Everyone will need medical care in their life and we already force hospitals to not let you die because you have the money for it right there. Is that slavery too?

At least with the government you could vote people in to shape the kind of healthcare system you want but now you cant fuck with anyone about what they are charging you.
There is huge difference between Democratic socialist and communism... Also Regan supporters protested for several hours on the convention floor when Ford got the nomination. Hillary is much worse than Sanders honestly.
This is going to happen in America unless something stops the PC bullshit train.
Well if we stop going to war in the middle east(trillions) it would have paid for healthcare for all and college. There is a skill gap in the US and we are loosing to other countries but yes, let's cut funding for education or just spend that money on war or tax breaks as long as the middle class doesn't benefit.
It doesn't have to do with politics at all so it makes sense. She isn't a politician, doesn't hold office and the story has nothing to do with Bernie so I am missing how is this political?
I work for an Airline and I can tell you planes, passengers and baggage get swapped around a ton. One delay at one airport causes a domino effect on other planes. It is planned out but that plan changes especially closer to take off.
Than why do people call Sanders a socialist or at the same time other politicians in the same vein. No one is calling for that kind of system even in the Democratic party or their voters.
Why are "socialist" countries doing well like Germany? No high unemployment there. It shows democratic socialism works...
But they are "socialists"... shouldn't there be bread lines and high unemployment there?

So why are people in Germany still working harder than Americans?
Mine starts on mute...
All states have different procedures but here in Washington State they don't map your face on the DMV picture and the picture isn't good enough often to make facial reference points.
For them to use facial recognition they would first have to already have a reference image. The guy who made the video is a moron.
The point is having the option to do so if one has the preference for it
Because some people want Android to stay where it is.
Again you are missing the point. Photoshop even the older versions would meet near almost most people's needs and they wouldn't be processing anything extreme. There will always need to be a high end commercial capable device no doubt but those who need that is a very tiny percent. Photoshop 6 would satisfy students and other non professional graphic design users.
Couldn't android handle the same games though technically?
Aren't even close? Our devices have the power to run it and of course most are still touchscreen because Android is really only on touch devices. Android can do so much more and Adobe already sees a market there and what downside would it be to Adobe to develop for Android if fits in their creative cloud?

Android has gaming and what other professional desktops apps are you talking about? Android could eventually run apps just as powerful if they wanted, it isn't technically impossible or a far stretch
.
Why not a desktop? It is all about apps and there are only are very select few apps Windows 10 has vs many apps people already love on their smart phones. Let's be honest, only small fraction of people ever use Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator. It also isn't that far of a stretch to take advantage of computational power and having full Photoshop run on Android.
There won't be one because of the numbers
Cause no one really likes them...
What's your day job?
how do you do it?
I will test the latency out on a hotspot

So the low ping I gets should help the most
What about low ping?
Because some people have Android apps not available on Windows 10 and they don't use Photoshop or heavy graphic gaming apps. You are not missing much for some people who want a Facebook/Netflix machine.

I love it!
Great job! Seriously, I don't think you can get better evidence than this.
There are already many successful organizations that feed the hungry. You won't be more efficient with that money than most charities who already have much much more leverage than you. You are nothing new or special and most people want to help those who need it so why would people choose you? You also have zero reputation and trustworthiness compared to a group like the Red Cross.
It would be better to have people donate to a charity then people spending money on gear to feed those who need food. Seriously, you are asking for charity with a small(or big) cut for yourself essentially.
Wow! This would be amazing and would save me time.
People are not mad about no confirmation (holding a vote) it is not having Congress vote at all. Vote no and get along with it.

The way I see it is the worst thing that can happen is I will see an ad for something I want to buy.
I give all my data to Google purposely and what it learns gives me a better experience like suggestions based off such a history of information. There are some things I want to keep private like my social security number or bank statements but I get advertised to better which I enjoy especially if I have been hunting for an item but can't make up my mind. Not everyone wants that and that is fine but I'm not loosing a thing honestly from my perspective.

Yes
It been happening for months so I have restarted and factory reset it multiple times.
Turning back on makes it wonky again. I put where I live as a trusted place but it seems the protection is stopping it from working properly.
I got it to work after I turned off pin based security and gave the Google app full access to everything like photos which was turned off for some reason. It finally worked but I now can't use Android Pay.
These people let themselves get beat up since if they fought to win the rival gang leader would have just killed them or hurt them in another way.
Crazy!
Well OEMs like Samsung are trying to work against Android by moving people away into their own services. Google is being shut out and it has a big financial interest in keeping Android afloat even if they have to do it themselves which is the case really.
The official YouTube app allows you to play videos in background if you get Play Music All Access/YouTube Red. 
That is the agreement and it shouldn't be expected for them to go back on what normal terms were.
You are paying for the Australian distribution rights not the US. Content from America is distributed out to each country. Netflix Australia has different rights to content then in America so how ever that media is being distributed is the lawful way. An example would be a company paying for the rights to distribute Simpsons in Australia. This company will choose a way to distribute the Simpsons which might not include being on Netflix but some other websites. How the person makes money is tied to that and you don't want to accept that. It is similar to franchising.

They don't have a pay per view option but you are denying the rightful owners of that content in Australia compensation by cheating. Does your wanting of watching America content justify cheating the system, I don't think so. Just admit you are doing wrong and just don't care. You don't have some human right to watch anything because you want to. Pirating should be fine as long as there isn't a pay per view stipulation is that what you are saying? Lol wow!




Content creators created a deal that does not involve you watching their material through Netflix since they would not be compensated. Stop pirating.
Women have until 35 till giving birth becomes riskier meaning they have pressure on them to get married compared to guys who can wait since they can have a child almost anytime and women are fine with big age gaps. This is not the case the other way around.
Being male means you can wait till your mid 30's for a child because of the age gap between men and women.
You can make the alarm only turn off my taking a picture and you can also shout at it to stop the alarm.

Exactly and some people think they have they right to do so because they don't have normal access.
They are making difficult and there will always be holes but it is fair. You shouldn't be watching the material because of how the rules are set up. You might not like it but tough cookies.
Yeah report it so they have the information on hand in case more of this continues. Maybe next time he steps it up and hurts someone. You never know.
Yup, he was allowing the guy to make the first move if he wanted to by keeping his hands down and backing away.

They have a nice clean app to display all their offerings which I think is great. The play store really limits developers reach. Every company is stuck with how the play store displays their apps.
What do you mean get its request? Are you asking how else could the car come to someone without a driver? Just treat the self driving car like a normal car and walk up to your self driving car. In time this will change as the self driving car is more widely adopted.
What point am I suppose to be getting from the link. Yes, California has been doing this for a little while but the cars are not perfect. There is also a lot of things that need to be worked out like who is responsible for accidents. California right now will put humans at fault if their self driving car hits something. The technology is young, give some time to be widely adopted across the country. 
The technology is early in its life so having a human on board makes sense. A transition has to take place and if the car makes a mistake a licensed driver will be at the wheel to assist. Why are you against having some extra protection as the technology matures.
You type globalisation as if that is a complete answer. If Google wants to venture outside of their home market they will do it if it 100% clear they will make money. If Google thought they could make more money in a certain market the would. Why would a company be that dumb.... You cant charge the same ad rates in America as let's say Germany.  Advertising dollars change country to country and if you are a poor country will a billion people you won't be able to make money from advertising much sense the people are too poor to buy the items being advertised.
Ever heard that means nothing.
Yes, if you are a US customer of a US company and I am talking all about this on a US website.
Or just get YouTube red
One more scene would have been a cherry on top with the guy in jail.
Like it was said before Pushbullet was a side project but it has grown into something more than a side project. 
It may but it didn't, he was an official.
The difference occurs when you have two speakers pointed at you vs having a speaker on the back pointing away from you. Most phones have a weak single speaker. On my Nexus 6 I have speakers pointing at me giving me a much better media viewing experience.
It does make a difference vs mono sound. Having both the right and left audio changes the audio experience completely as the sound is more natural sounding than one mono speaker trying to match the volume. The placement also matters if you like watching any content so placing the speakers in front makes the most sense. Can't beat the two speaker model with one.
That must have been satisfying
You are wrong
I have a problem because at work I drive equipment around that is limited to 15 mph so Google thinks I'm biking that.
I don't think there is an app developed for this purpose yet which boggles my mind. I had a bus pass that used NFC and there was an app developed by a student at UW which allows me to view the balance on my bus pass and see the trips I took. I thought if my phone could do that it should be able to mimic the card so I wouldn't have to carry the pass anymore.
:( Can you back it up on Google Drive? Your notification widget is exactly what I have been looking for a long time, thank you.
I wish I could back this up in keep or drive
How the fuck are you going to explain this one!
Google is a US company do not forget. Like Samsung in Korea and Sony/Nintendo the home country will inevitably be the first and have the most available features. It makes most of its money in the US off content that is US. Google may eventually roll things out to others but America is Google's number concern by a lot. 

Google also isn't just concerned about number of users but the number of value per customer. Google will make no money if everyone in North Korea watched a YouTube ad for BMW.  

When going to other countries there are legal hoops to jump through as they already jumped through US hoops.

You are now on a list
That may be true but my point is Ohio doesn't decide the election, it just happens to be more swingy that other states at this moment.
That doesn't mean Ohio has some crazy magic in the air that decides our elections. Factors change constantly and Ohio just has a nice streak of chance going for itself. My local highschool team won every away game for awhile but that didn't mean that always was going to be true in the future. Why did Ohio not decide elections before but now they do? Lol things like this happen all the time but they don't predict the future.

Just being from Ohio doesn't mean you get Ohio. Al Gore didn't get his home state when he ran for president.
Well you could also use old Android phones to be the alarm. I got two that are just collecting dust.
Yup, you are crazy because Kasich is not conservative enough for Republicans. Coming from Ohio doesn't mean a thing.
I love the feature of auto saving but what about having some short cut to rename it instead of having to go through several screens to get there.
Yup
Why didn't Pushbullet just make a $5 pro version. You would be seeing cash instead of down votes. 
They had SMS for awhile and universal copy/paste
The features that are now paid are the only ones I used and I didn't even use it that much so Pushbullet is worthless to me.
I'm uninstalling
The US has stronger ties to France than those other countries. It would be similar to your best friend getting hurt or that acquaintance you had from middle school.
Isn't called chumming?
I wonder then how much Samsung users change around there theme with the S6. Also I would think the popularity of launcher Apps demonstrates people like to customize their phone they look at every day.
Yup, I totally agree and I am not mad about being able to use both.
You can loop playlists even a one song playlist, it makes no sense.

Briggs is known for trying to pathetically draw up hype. He just wants attention. Here is another time of him acting. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2714211/The-moment-Wladimir-Klitschko-humiliates-former-boxing-champion-Shannon-Briggs-Miami-restaurant-American-fighter-steals-food-plate.html

They can name it whatever they want but having a singular platform that plays nicely with each other I think is the goal. Android on a tablet doesn't have to look the same as Android on a phone and same could be said for a Android laptop w/touch screen abilities. What I really want is to be able to have a full Photoshop experience on any Android/Chrome on a device. I could break free away from needing Microsoft or Apple.
What is so wrong with changing direction when ChromeOS will still function? What do you use ChromeOS for that couldn't be done if ChromeOS is folded into Android? You can still go online and do everything you did before. It seems you more worried about the name of the OS and being a mod of Reddit that may disappear because Google is evolving.
Google is a US company that is primarily focused on the US like many companies that are based in a country. Japan has exclusive material like certain games that Americans don't get or if you lived in South Korea where Samsung is based.
What about putting in your pocket and you kneel down? You are going to put stress on the phone and the way this bends you wouldn't be too far off from a bent phone and broken glass.

The guy is a jerk and just simply like messing with people. The cops didn't restrain the man and yet after the police were going on their way moving away from the guy he just couldn't shut up. He kept on trying to inject himself into the situation trying to steer up something up. This guy has some mental issues as well.

Have you ever tried it yourself, just curious? Many things we do is harmful to ourselves like our own diet or even staying outside in the sun with no sun protection. Weed gives you a certain feeling which is unique and I don't think alcohol can be compared to it as the effects are completely different. Yes I know a drug is a drug but that doesn't mean all drugs do have the same effects.

Weed can also help those who suffer medically for some conditions but I have never heard anyone say it is a cure all for everything. I view people who smoke weed regularly the same as someone who eats oreo's consistently. Both aren't great for your health but both also really don't cause much harm unless you only eat Oreo's and nothing else.
Thank you
It is not, you can not use  Android Auto one your phone by itself.
Thank you
Can you mirror your phones screen to it? I would get this in a heart beat.
This was really well done
I choose to get the Nexus 6 now since I wanted front facing speaker, always listening and a 6 inch screen.
Always listening without the phone being plugged in.
Thank you!

They are being asked to take a loan with different terms. The different terms have conditions of spending cuts and higher taxes which if followed would go in the direction of paying things off. Greece said no to the new conditions which means they will continue to be in a position of not being able to pay their debts off.

There are features inbox has that outlook doesn't. I prefer inbox and frequently used google apps other apps than just outlook and many other apps.
Have you used outlook before? The available options of what you can do is different than inbox. Using outlook you can see your calendar inside the outlook app, make notes and also your contacts are easily reached. I wish inbox had similar options within the app.
This is for project Fi users not just people who buy Nexus 6's.
They are forwarding along the message given to Google, this just like every other isp. Now news here.
This is post is an ad for a product not just a random video. 
I do know them personally and many of them I knew before they became politicians. Most of them were already involved in the community organizations that help the community in various ways like cleaning graffiti, cleaning parks, helping those who went through financial trouble and etc. I live in the US if you didn't know that already. I personally saw my congressman go from community activist to his present level all because the community loved him. A president or a few congressman that F up shouldn't define every other politician. 
Do you know your local elected officials? Mine where I live in my city work hard to address all citizens concerns. Even my congressman is great and he makes sure to come back to hear from his constitutes. I also know they are not sociopaths and why they run is because they love the area they represent and want it to proper.
Politics like any other job takes skills and desire to accomplish something. Why is it any different than wanting to be an astronaut? It takes experience to be good at anything and I hate the trope that all politicians are evil and people who don't involve themselves  in politics would be great.
Flipped off! Flick off is not how you say that.
How about a Nexus 5.5?
I know Google currently is the king of search but I think Google can not hold on that forever because how can they? What tool can they use to make sure they are number one? Facebook advertising revenue is growing at a fast rate and personally if I wanted to advertise I would advertise will Facebook not Google. I have done some work for advertising for small businesses and political candidates and the best tool is Facebook by far.
What incentive do they have to light fires? There isn't a direct correlation of more internet users and big profits going straight to Google. If everyone could get online right now with unlimited data and fast speed doesn't mean Google wins and everyone else loses. Other companies would soak up profit more than Google all on Google's hard work. Google is stupid if they don't becoming serious about making profit outside of Google search and youtube.
Then why do this at all. Is this just an experiment for shits and giggles? It makes no sense to do something like this unless you working up towards something that can be profitable.
What features comes with the pro version? 
Wow! Mobile webpages that have the feel of an app. I love this!
It was an accident should someone go to jail over it? That wouldn't stop another person making a mistake later in the future since people don't instinctively know what a rare crocodile looks like. Helping financially is the only thing that can help this animal.
2nd class at best. If you look at the general life style of the average citizen you would know that China and Russia come in way behind the US. China just has a lot of people and Russia hahaha no way in any shape or form. They do have a lot of land.
Yes, the US doesn't lead I every category but when everything is combined we are the best. We are the lone super power, we are the apple of every eye and America for its population size has the strongest economy. Britain is mere cog the wheel but Germany, Japan and China at least are not a tiny cog.
America should be Germany's buddy not England's.

Seattle and mushrooms are okay but not my favorite.
Yes, the kind that doesn't exist. I tried a whole variety of them on a food tour as was told imitation would pale in comparison which turned out both taste similar and both taste awful. There are people out there who like the taste of actual shit and everything else and truffle oil belongs near the taste of shit. I would rather drink a pint of ole English than try that again.
It isn't. The taste of both is hell.
I am not delusional you are though thinking setting a limit will actually help anything. You can look at cities, counties and state level politics where term limits were added and you find no statistical change whatsoever. Find me a place with statistical proof and here is some info for you to chew on about California making such a change http://www.ppic.org/content/pubs/rb/RB_1104BCRB.pdf
Term limits does nothing in terms of quality. You just pointed out your delusion when you said term limits work for other public offices. Presidents and governors aren't better than congressmen. Has the US done so much better since the term limit changed with FDR? Presidents haven't been is what anyone could tell you. You can't see past your own ignorance.
Is there any other job in human history where experience is bad? Why do people think experience is so bad. If they do criminal activity these politicians are canned and cannot survive an election. So many other jobs are done on public dime like policemen. Should we do this to all our public jobs? Lobbyist would be in even more control because they would have a fresh class of inexperienced politicians to devour. 

Seriously, if you are caught with criminal activity or even close to it most politicians can not just get away from it. Congress having low approval ratings mean nothing and for that proof just look at how people rate their own congressman. Most people know nothing about politics and you sound like one yourself. Politics is not something you can pick up from watching cnn or foxnews. We have a divided country where people love their own congressmen but disagree with other people in another district or state.
If you do that than the rich useing their own money and public funds or even without would win. Are you going to ban a person from spending their own money too?
Are term limits a solution? You don't get better quality people by limiting how long someone should work. Let's have term limits with teachers, policemen, firefighters and fast food workers... That will solve everything!

You already have an option to imposing term limits and that is called voting.
How do you run a campaign without any money? Should only people who are rich should run?
Why are term limits a fix in anyway? In most jobs including politics having years under your belt helps your ability. It still is a democracy and if the will of the people is to vote you out it can happen by people voting.

Also without an alternative why is collecting campaign contribution as bad. Campaigns cost money so the money has to come from somewhere especially when people run and they don't come from money. 
Press on the volume rocker and you will see an option for no sound, important interruptions and all
That makes sense because I was reading this and was like my nexus 5 can do that already.
I love it because before inbox I always felt overwhelmed by emails. I would unread some emails just so I wouldn't forget about them but now I can snooze or pin emails so they never get forgotten about any longer. I feel so much less anxiety have a inbox with only a couple emails or sometimes none. 
You can compare acting to real life because it is closer to real life than a printed letter. Most people in real life act already, trying to portray themselves as their ideal image.
That is your opinion but I felt way more emersed in the movie especially because of the sound. The film is closer to real life the printed letters.
You have to have an imagination for for film. You have to allow yourself to be emersed in films like the The Lord of Rings since you are accepting a world that doesn't exist. Words on a paper are unnatural and you try to create sound and sight which will never be as good as real sight and sound. 

Why don't people write more as their main form of communication if writing is so great. Us humans have more senses than sight and film engages the imagination, sight and hearing. People are choose video because it is more natural and easier since it is closer to real life that the imagination could never accomplish. 
Why is that? Reading characters on a piece of paper isn't how we humans best communicate with eachother. If that was true then we wouldn't hang out physically with eachother and would instead write letters back and forth which obviously doesn't happen. We humans like to hear each others voice and that feeling could never be accurately described by characters printed on a piece of paper.
Doesn't come close if you do the math. Also as I said, reading engages less senses. Imagination is not a human sense.
Video engages more senses than books which is why I enjoy video more. Hearing sound, facial expressions, body language can not be fully described at a constant rate in a book. Like the saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words so imagine how many words would be needed for 10 hours of video.
Yes, I totally agree
This app won't work in game. A voice chat baked into Google games just makes so much sense.

What do you gain by not resisting?
What difference does it make. A cop isn't going to change his or her way of policing because you resist. What do you gain by resisting?
They could have all the quotas in the world but if you did nothing you will be fine. At worst you will have to fight a ticket but if there is zero proof in court you will be fine. You are hyping a problem that doesn't exist everywhere at all. Every job from baker to cop will have bad apples but again a low percentage of any occupation is corrupt. Car salesmen's and experts at bestbuy financially rip off more money than cops with a smile.
If you are given an order by cops you should follow the instruction as cops are trying to secure the scene. If handcuffs are put on you you aren't necessarily going to jail. Cops put their lives on the line and when suspects refuse any order cops know they could be in danger of being shot or attached. There are plenty of videos online where you see cops being shot at and had they been able to secure the scene no on would have died. 

Just because you don't know why handcuffs are being put on you gives you the right to ignore the cop. The cops most like are given information and are following procedure by enforcing the law. It might just be a misunderstanding that they have the wrong guy in which case the cops will let you go and apologize. Cops aren't just going around arresting people for absolutely no reason. Cops are not perfect by a wide margin but if you can stand a couple minutes of having some handcuffs you will be able to go on your way with cops saying we are sorry for putting you in that position.

I would love this. Inbox has been my savior and it is my most important app I have.
you can set the amount of time before it re locks which means when it stops feeling the movement it will lock. How else would a phone tell it is not in your hands?
No one should ever be proud of a sucker punch. This is not a fight at all, just a guy who is a coward who didn't want a fight.
I see your point but this option is not forced and it is for those who are willing to let their phone be unlocked in various ways. Why make a comment at all if this isn't for you?
Security from people you know or the imagined shadow group waiting for you to lower your guard? I know people get upset hearing how the NSA is tracking people but a simple password or thumbprint wouldn't stop the NSA if they wanted your specific information. Do you use social media at all or give up your information to any website? If you say yes than you are already giving up your information willing. I don't post anything online like my social security card or birth date but any information beyond that I figure is fair game living in the 21st century. I hate the idea of a government or group trying to do this but the government is made up of so many parts that there will be some people pulling information that is not lawful so no law will stop them and if fired more people will take their place. It is sort of like how no law or infinite budget will stop people from killing each other. /rant
From what I had read earlier this person would ask for money while opening the door. He wasn't trying to be nice he was trying to earn money by opening the door for people. He was loitering and making customers uncomfortable because of how forceful he was asking for money.

I already updated :(

How do I do that?

I am happy to give those companies my data because then the apps that use the data can tailor things to my liking. You have a choice being getting a non smart phone if you would like. I understand someone might use the information to commit fraud but I am willing to take the chance since I monitor my credit constantly. To me I am fine with having targeted ads because then I get to know more options when it comes to buying things. 
Are you serious? The guy that is being interviewed is as two faced as you can get. When he can't be called on his bullshit at protests he displays his true colors which are of Islamic extremism. He tries to act as civilized as he can to people outside of his community but here you can plainly see he dodges and weaves all he can. As you can see though the interviewer saw right through him and his bullshit.

Inbox has changed the way I use email which is a good thing. I would always stress out that I was missing an unread email because my inbox was always full. Being able to snooze emails for latter fixed that completely. Also I love being able to pin an email instead of marking unread over and over because I would go back and forth from my email. It is so nice to have a inbox that can be empty.

Anyone can easily find high quality wallpapers so why would I pay for it?
Suing this guy will help future attack not happen because you add financial disincentives to it. Also this bloke is going to be put out of work for awhile and who knows how this incident will effect future employment opportunities.

Yup, pretty sure Google did that. It might suck but I think it is fair for Google to stop these apps because they are rightfully trying to make a new revenue stream. If Google had allowed this before it started charging I would have been really pissed but that is not the case.

If you read the article it talks about unnecessary pieces coming off to lighten the load for the chute.
Also walking is free, pushups are free and so are other physical activities.
You are absolutely wrong and I have done my research. I can help you out a bit by letting you know you should look at the poverty level in America and then look at how many people are obese. Obesity exists across all classes. I get fresh fruit like bananas(.59 per pound) strawberries($1.50 per pound), spinach(1.60 per pound), skim milk(2.50 per gallon) black beans(.50 per pound), oatmeal(.86 per pound), rice(.70 per pound), frozen chicken breasts(2.79 a pound) and bran flakes(1.20 per pound). This is very cheap and if I instead buy snacks my $200 food budget grows. I know from actual experience that you are wrong. Also walking is free, pushups are free and so are other physical activities. 
Are you serious... Fruits and Vegetables aren't expensive. Also most people who are overweight are not poor by any means. Personally I save a ton of money when I only buy spinach, potatoes, carrots, celery and all those are super cheap! Sloth is the sin of those who are overweight and continue to abuse their own body.
That is better than what I have seen before for the form factor. 
If money isn't a problem why would I want this over getting a new phone every two years? I see no upside to a modular phone. A modular phone will always look ugly to me because of the form factor needed.
