Not OP however I prefer android messages because of the way it looks. I love the auto assigned colors for my contacts based on contact photos and how it also let's me choose a special color for each convo. It's more personal and I like the color changes. Its superficial... Can you share why you like stock?

Sending a text to a thread that's over a year old won't save it from being deleted. It only protects the thread from being deleted but every message that's in the thread that's over a year old will still get deleted. The is thing you can do is turn off automatically deleting messages or try archiving the whole thread. I've never archived a thread before with intent to safe something indefinitely so I would Google it first. Turning off automatically delete is guaranteed to work.

I would just like to say that my quick Googling (literally all I did) of the subject found me no sources that did other than speculate about the scandal. Only thing I found is China had to give back one metal from the 2000 games in Sydney but that's it. I'm curious though if you had a specific story/example in mind to tell me about so I can look it up more.

As a result of the policies put in place by the  previous Congress. And we all know that the Congress after Republicans were put back in the House was of the most unproductive Congresses this country has ever had.
Yeah those ones caused by Bush! Those same ones that Obama's administration and Democrat's policies cut in half that resulted in a booming economy
Fair enough. I would just caution against being complacent about hallucinations. If he has a doctor I think he should report these symptoms. Sometimes the symptoms can get worse, and the hallucinations can become unfriendly, hopefully they do not! Good luck.
It's possible that your husband could have developed schizophrenia. It's a common symptom of a schizophrenic to see figures or shadow people in rooms when they are with people they care about. What clues me into this is that the figure is one only your husband can see and the figure is completely centered around you. I would certainly suggest to your husband that he goes to a doctor or a psychiatrist and discuss his symptoms and drug use history. 
No it really wasn't. It was designed to fix the Medicaid gap and get everyone insured, which would reduce premiums. The main reason why premiums were getting high in some markets was because Republican state governments didn't accept free money from the Fed (and sued to win that right to refuse money from the Fed) which was their only way of handicapping it at the time. With that they could turn around and point out how it wasn't working and was flawed, leaving out that it was acting that way because they wrecked it on purpose. We'll never know how it should have worked.
Thank you!

no problem! I believe Iris is generally better option as it can be used in any level of light since it used an IR camera. I don't think Face unlock uses the IR camera
Android has had full face recognition since 5.0. I also have an S8, and it's a feature you can enable in settings. You need to choose between having Iris or Face unlock enabled; you cannot have both active at the same time but both can be set up at the same time. To total it all up, you can use a password, pin code or pattern lock simultaneously with the fingerprint scanner and iris scanner or face unlock enabled at the same time. Feel free to DM me if you need help!

Have you ever tried having this sort of discussion with a ignorant racist grandparent before?

It's incredibly hard to reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into. They are thinking irrationally, and unfortunately reason and rational thinking will not get them out of their entrenched beliefs (easily). Of course I am generalizing, but a lot of the people that are holding these beliefs do fit it seems the  aforementioned criteria
Oh I didn't know you could write custom commands like that, I didn't think it would work since even when I speak it bixby claims it can't be done. I'll try it, thanks for your advice so far
Perhaps I'm missing something, because I can't find a command that says open current APP and split screen view on my Galaxy. The only command that I can find is open my most recent app in split view or however it says it

Edit - I appreciate the help anyway, do you have anything else I can try? Maybe I'm missing that update that everyone has gotten already except AT&T hasn't released it yet
Can you help me please, I was trying to set up your YouTube command in mulri-window/split screen view and I can't figure out how to do it.

Not the original commenter, however I believe I understand the reasoning: Because when you're dying you may start to care less and less about what people think of you and may feel you're more free to just do whatever. If you care a lot about what others think you're generally less inclined to do what would make others angry. I think you're implying that because he's dying he's started to care more about what people think about him with respect to the legacy he'll leave behind, however I don't think a lot of people think that way ( though I may be just projecting).

*Damn*, those're issues I've never had to deal with. When I switched this year from a 5S to the S8+ I only had issues for a few days (partially due to me not knowing how notifications work). A possible reason could be that your friends do not have SMS or MMS turned on in their settings, therefore will only send iMessages. It's also possible something with your or their phone is fucked, as I remember having a problem with my iPhone not being able to text this one particular phone number.

Did you restore your old phone before giving it to your friend?
Are you in a group chat with iPhone users?
(I have no idea what to do about the pic download problem, I've had it before, but it just kinda went away)

In my experience, everything gets better soon. Try talkinng to Apple and/or your cell company's reps at a store?
Legit this is a really good rum
It should and should easily be differentiable from a phone not having internet service. And you also may be right. 
Yeah I think the iPhones also try to remember which phone numbers use iMessage, so getting friends phones to realize the switch takes time and also at least one attempt to send an iMessage before it gets a notification that it needs to change delivery methods
Don't bring it back, it takes around 1-3 days for the server side adjustments at Apple to take hold, don't worry it'll be fixed soon!

Hey fuck that sounds like some lawyer level shit. Kiddos to you for covering​ all your bases, and honestly I was probably going to do the same thing. This is all so ridiculous. 
This is exactly what I'm dealing with too, I am about to call samsung and talk about it. What did they tell you? Any luck?
I'm the same as you. I don't prefer PDA because I don't want people to notice me differently, make assumptions, etc. It just feels so weird.

My take - if you've made it clear it isn't personal when you dismiss PDA because it's just not your vibe, and he still takes it that way, that is his fault. In a perfect world he should be respecting your feelings and not get so butt hurt about it.
However in relationships nobody ever gets it 100% their way, and unfortunately that includes people like you and I.

If I were you in this situation, I'd try and talk deeply about why he and I feel the way we do, and if there was an agreement we could come to about how we will behave in public. You mentioned somewhere else that when you give him an inch (hand holding) he goes a mile (lays on you). That shit wouldn't fly with me either. It's important for you both to establish boundaries and mutual respect. In the end, if he can't respect your boundaries, and neither you to his, then the relationship will have problems. I hope that helps!
Plus I'm pretty sure you were right all along too... haha

Do you have more pictures? or at least take pictures of the other eye too? I'd be cool to see the variation in pigments between your eyes. My claim to fame is one black eye and one brown eye. Super cool and super jealous as someone with mostly brown eyes!! Thanks!!
Pics??
I have two differently colored irises. It's hard to tell outside of bright light, since one eye is black and my other eye is brown. Also on the sclera of my black eye there are black pigment spots that aren't present on my brown eye. I have no vision abnormalities in either eye (no glasses, no colorblind was, etc).

I think it's super cool, especially when I step into bright light and it surprises people when they notice it! I like to joke that I have an evil eye  :)
Yes I know about the first 2 layers, but it goes beyond that and extends to cabinet members as well. I don't know that order. 
If it leads to impeachment, the successor would be whoever is next in line.  I'm uncertain of the hierarchy, but you can google it yourself. I've never heard of a provision in place that calls for emergency secondary elections in the U.S, but you can google that too. 
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to prance around on my high horse like I don't have any personal demons myself, I'm just calling a spade a spade for what it is. And like someone else already said, if you can't see how these examples are racist I agree that you're either purposefully looking the other way, or you're ignorant to the issues. Racism is prejudice because of someone's race.

"He doesn't have a birth certificate, or if he does, there's something on that certificate that is very bad for him.

And if you're a Muslim, you don't change your religion, by the way," - on Obama not being an American and for being Muslim

“He’s a Mexican. We’re building a wall between here and Mexico. The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings – rulings that people can’t even believe,” - on a Mexican-American judge who ruled against him, calling out the judge specifically for his race

“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending people that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us.

Oh I'm sorry, I completely misunderstood your post, that's how it read to me. That said, agreed. 
The only thing that Obama actually did that you listed was what you call an evisceration of the 4th amendment. I don't completely disagree with you on that at all. What he has done to our privacy is terrible.


But no, Obama did not order the IRS to target conservative/republican leaning groups. In fact, if you actually read your link you would know that the agency acted independently and was found to NOT have targeted anyone.

And no, Obama did not order the DNC to plant protesters at Trump rallies. Apparently there were protester plants by the DNC (or their affiliates, don't recall) which is horrendous, no arguments there, but you cannot pin Obama for that at all. He was not involved. 

You're right, it wasn't unifying. Usually there's a lot more joy and a lot less campaign rhetoric by this point to bring the conversation together and onward. There was a lot of disrespect for the all the political leaders sharing the stage with him as well.

Well color me pleasantly surprised!
OTA supposedly functions by doing a series of find and replace functions on the system files to update the phone. There is always a chance for some corruption (in basically any computer system) using this method. I haven't the slightest clue what changed from 10.x to 10.1.1; maybe a lot, maybe a little. But since we're here, you might as well just backup, restore, downgrade and restore your backup because a restore prints all of those files as new. There's nothing to lose; in my view, why risk it? 

I'm still on 8.4 and jailbroken on my 5S. Because of this release I may actually buy a phone on Sunday just so I can do this haha
The furniture inside the house and the home decorating. We're inside, it's all wired up, we just have to move in so a user can live there.
The thing is the exploit will not work on a 32 bit device. You need to have a iPhone 6 or up. I'm in the same boat. Honestly, I was procrastinating buying a new phone (even with my cracked screen) and this news is making me want to buy a phone now.
In addition to what Matthew says, a full restore and update will allow you to reclaim the maximum amount of space on your phone. When you update OTA you're leaving a bunch of unnecessary junk on your phone that clogs your HD. It's better to start fresh, every time. 
Or, get on 10.1.1 now and jailbreak when/if it's released. That's the only sure way to get it IF a full jailbreak comes out because you'll already be on 10.1.1. It will probably stop being signed sometime next week. The gamble you're taking is completely loosing your jailbreak for an unforeseen amount of time.

Yes, that's why after restoring you have to downgrade to iOS 10.1.1 while it's still being signed using iTunes right after you restore. Then you would jailbreak, and restore from your backup after it's finished. However restoring from your backup will only work if you have a backup from an older version of iOS - I don't think you can't load a backup from a higher operating system.
Yeah it's not, it's a mischievous smile. You should've used 😄 haha
That's a creepy emoji to use with that comment.

Sorry, you're not right. Clinton absolutely won the popular vote. She has nearly 3 million more votes than for Trump.
Same! All of it. Expect I've installed NoBanPlz to stop anything from hooking into the snapchat app and everything is fine. I wish I could keep phantom... but at least I hopefully won't be banned for having a jailbreak!
Thanks, I see where j misunderstood what you said before. I'm sorry - uninstalling helped me, thanks!
Thanks Vaporhead, this helps. I actually had found the libphantom install earlier and removed it. My account is still locked but at least now the app isn't locking me out from attempting to log in. I'm no longer experiencing the "unable to connect check connection blah blah blah" error anymore after removing libphantom. I had xcon before solving it, and after I had removed libphantom and rebooted snapchat crashed when j tried to open the app. removing xcon fixed that issue. Again, thank you for both of your comments!
Thanks friend! I have xcon and it still doesn't work :(
Yes I know that's what you were saying. That's why I was asking for specific details because *I* am still jailbroken and have tweaks installed (but not phantom anymore) and trying to get snapchat to work. So again, what did you mean by removing the phantom library files? What is the iFile path that you used?
what is the repo for nosub?
what is xv? thanks 
that's what uninstalling is and that's not what you said you did to make it work. unless you meant that you simply uninstalled phantom?
where are the lib libraries?
Tree sap isn't flammable, sap is mostly water. It might cause a tree to explode in fires because the water has been boiled and water expands rapidly and exponentially when it's a gas. Tree resins are flammable though.
I completely agree. I just learned about this today as well. Interesting, makes sense, but still dumb. 
There are no actual dinosaur bones around, only fossils. And fossils are a mass of minerals and other solids that filled the cavity created by a dinosaur body that was rotting away underground.
It's explained elsewhere by somebody else in this thread but in case you haven't seen it, it's not that the research isn't valid, it's more to do with the availability of the fossil when it's in a private collection. The beauty of science and research in journals is that the final paper is published as well as the methodology on how they collected the data and the raw data itself. For fossils kept in museums, the benefit is that they're public; anyone can request to work on a fossil and do follow up work, further work, or check already researched work. Private collections may not have the fossils available to everyone or may have periods where they're not available to study at all, or may even be sold to another collector.
I really want to high five you for this bro, you're a real white knight but in literally the best way possible. Thank you so much for standing up to racism and for standard human decency. We need more people with courage to say something! I, like you, try to do the same things for the same reasons you've outlined. Thank you.
Usually, yes they do. The people in the corners of game and reality shows like these are usually celebrities of some kind; whether they be comedians, actors, idols, singers, or news anchors.

Shows like to show someone's live reactions to the audience because it adds to the entertainment. Also, when a bit is finished the host can go to their live celebrity audience and to get their commentary on what they just saw. Often you will see the people in the corner are contestants on the same types of shows that they're invited to commentate on.
Ahh gotcha, I see your point. 
> In both the 2012 and 2008 elections Obama got vastly more electoral votes compared to the popular vote.

What are you talking about? Obama won the popular vote too by nearly 5 million votes in 2012 and by 9.5 million in 2008. He got the lion's share of electoral votes because he got the lion's share of individual votes.

> The electoral college system is bad for everybody.

I agree... :(
> As far as the President/Prime Minister. It isn't just about splitting responsibility. It is about appointment vs election. The Prime Minister isn't elected, he is appointed. The President is elected. This way you get someone running the country who the people love and someone running the country who can actually work with politicians.

Ah, that's right. President is elected by the people and is President of the parliament (right?) and then the dominate parlimentary party appoints the PM. Or is it that the elected President chooses the PM from whomever s/he chooses? I suppose you'd eventually have a parliamentary majority of whatever party the President elect is in (at least more often than the not).
I don't really know how a President/Prime Minister model works but from what I understand I'd have to agree that splitting the load of responsibilities is not a bad idea.

I tell people that we can't have third parties if the only time people are voting for them is during the presidential election. That's just beyond stupid. If we want viable third parties, they need to win local city and state government level elections before they can have any representation.

The way I see it, is if a Libertarian or Green party candidate were to be elected as President (somehow) and assuming we basically have the same kind of political environment we have now, they'd still essentially be treated as a Democrat or a Republican because that's where the rest of the governmental support system is coming from. A Libertarian would get primarily GOP support, where a Green would get primarily Democrat support. I don't think anything substantial would change.
Hell a multiparty parliamentary system might not even be a bad idea 
Oh yeah I had forgotten about the representative disparity between the northern and southern states. But I thought it was the opposite way, where the south had a majority? Because didn't the shear number of slaves as 3/5 people tilt the scale in the south's favor? 

I don't know I could be super wrong. Thanks for the reminder, I have to look it up again! Time for a reminder.
Actually it's the top 3 people chosen that the House has to choose if no candidate gets the majority of EV. You're incorrect.

And yes, they did think they were too dumb, because honestly they probably were back then. Education wasn't something a lot of people could attain. Furthermore, it was limited to land owning white men. They were uppity and elitist to a point. 

But that aside, if you read Federalist paper #68 you can see Hamilton make the argument for the EC being allowed to vote against a candidate that would be a threat to the function of the government. And again, they didn't trust that average voter to be educated enough to make a rational decision. Sad part? They're right, because we just elected Trump. I mean, even Churchill once said, "The best argument against democracy is a 5 minute conversation with the average voter." If they were capable, they'd elect people based on policy and experience instead of raw emotion. 

Forgive me for my bitter pessimism, you caught me at a bad time 😅
> http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/130452-the-bureaucracy-is-expanding-to-meet-the-needs-of-the

Got it, agreed.

> Large companies love complex code and regulations. Small companies cannot afford compliance officers and consultants so they regularly skirt the rules without knowing it and are fined. The larger competition and the government wins. My hunch is that Trump understands this and tackles it - I hope I am right.

I'd love for you to be right as well. Actually.

> People change over time - we all do.

This is especially true with myself. I hope he does change outwardly. He's not doing a good job now at all - it comes across as if he has a complete utter lack of self awareness. Yikes. While that may take training, he should *at the minimum* apologize for the terrible things he has said and the terrible things people are doing in his name. Without that, he will have a tough time earning anyone's respect without showing an ounce of humility and shame. A good place he can start would be apologizing to Obama for starting the birther movement. That would be **YUGE**.
Well that's not okay! Lol
> You should be angry and withhold your respect until/if he earns it (if only to counter the current of people who will support him no matter what he does), but just don't put up a wall where everything he does is automatically wrong, and all the people who voted for him are 'The Enemy' (while completely understanding there are a lot of bad people which really bad ideas, that should totally be opposed). That sort of thinking, like this is some sort of war you can't afford to lose, is what got us Trump in the first place.

This is exactly how I feel. Hard to be optimistic, but I will be very pleased should he do things to earn my respect. Can't say the same for some of the voters though, because he courted some of them by how he was acting.
> To be fair, he still has yet to do those things, since he hasn't taken office. You're angry at his image, not what he's actually done or not done. All he's done so far is appoint some people, and maybe save a few hundred jobs for a few years in a state that supported him. I agree he's a terrible person, tho. He appealed to the lowest common denominator. He could never have won if he had any real competition.

In addition to saying some terrible things, and screwing a lot of people over (though legal, still immoral). But buy and large, you're right. I already said some stuff to reply to your other comment, so I won't repeat myself here. Last point stands though, I wish I could be optimistic too, but it's just too hard for me right now considering what I do know now.
> Progress doesn't not necessarily mean expanding the bureaucracy to accommodate the bureaucracy. 

Sorry to be a stickler but the double negative here is confusing me :P so I'm going to assume that was a mistake.

> we have had enough lawyers

I *super* agree with this. We need fresh meat. I've always been saying and thinking, why in the world do we not have economists and mathematicians deciding how much to tax groups of people so we can actually pay for everything?? Why aren't the accountants/auditors/CPAs the ones writing a flawless and hole-less tax code??? Why can't the scientists and engineers be the directors of the EPA, direct our energy policy, our environmental laws??? Where are the biologists, botanists, and farmers in the Dept of Agriculture?? Where are the physicians when they're writing health care laws??

Even if they're included, they're not at the top calling the shots. Lawyers who don't know anything of expertise about the field they're told to make decisions on are in charge. It's just crazy to me! I want to pull out my hair!!

> I think Trump is probably the best person suited to do this.
Or I could be incorrect and he is a total disaster - that said I am remaining optimistic.

Honestly, I really did used to believe that he was. The outsider that was just using hyperbole and psychology to rile up the emotions of lowest common denominator so he could ride a wave of ignorant people into office. Then he would govern from the center left like Hilary would since apparently he's been a Dem for most of his life. But you know, I lost faith when he got crazier and crazier, and seemed more and more unstable. He has so many scandals (didn't even denounce David Duke, I mean, what??) and interest conflicts and has so far considering to appoint so many scummy people to cabinet positions. His potential pick for interior secretary, Forrest Lucas, is against the Humane Society, and has lobbied against animal abuse and cruelty laws! Who does that?? Why support someone like that?? Even if terrible views shouldn't disqualify one from holding an unrelated position in government... I mean, come on.

If Trump was even close to the person he claimed to be when he started campaigning, that person is long dead. I really wish I could be optimistic like you, but it's really hard for me right now. :/
Yeah, I only used peasant because that's the kind of class a farmer and soap maker would have been at that time. Basically, I agree and I have no arguments here about what you said about Trump, his eligibility, or peasant eligibility to run *except* for the meaning of the qualifications like I already explained. I know you read and understood my point from your other comment.
> Just because more people live in California and voted for Hilary, doesn't mean the election results get overturned over the other 37 states.

I completely agree with that based on the election system we have now, but it just stinks that the majority of voters (regardless of where they live) did not support the winner. The same thing happened in 2000, but I would say it's different this time. We're talking a few thousand voters versus a couple million voters. Millions!!

> I do get it man, why would anyone ever support a President they didn't vote for?

As for this part, if the President didn't try to systemically fuck over large swaths of people (voter suppression, elimination of social services, disproportionate tax programs) we'd still have people who respect the President they didn't vote in. Even though I didn't want Bush I still respected him as a person, but I disagreed with a lot of positions. Same with Romney if he had won. However, trump has run a campaign that fueled white supremacy and discrimination. He is a terrible person with terrible views. The Republicans went with it and with him, and for that reason I will never respect him nor (at least at this time) the people who voted for him. It really sucks for me to say and feel that, trust me. :(
> Once again - system of peers vs superiors and inferiors

I'm sorry, I forgot to address this part in your first comment.

But first, I disagree with you about the founding fathers because they were not low class people like you say. They were military generals, scientists, doctors, businessmen, the majority had training in law (some weren't lawyers, some were, some were judges), and only 2 were small farmers. I would say you're incorrect.

My theory on what makes a person qualified can be simplified like this - I wouldn't trust nor would I ever want a mechanic to give me open heart surgery. They can meet all the requirements, but not be qualified for the job.

But don't get me wrong, I wouldn't exclude a mechanic for POTUS if they can prove and demonstrate that they have the competence for the job. Was the mechanic a respected leader? What are their conflict of interests, if any exist? Do they have good character references/evidence for it? Have they shown ability to make rational decisions? Do they beyond a reasonable doubt not hold negative views about the people they would represent? Are they a good person? Trump has demonstrated none of that. More politicians, organizations, Americans, and world leaders agree with me.

It's true that corrupt lifelong politicians have been a plague on America, and I would absolutely welcome an outsider or a field expert to help push out the shit. But Trump is not even close to a solution to our problem and he has already proved that by starting to fill his cabinet with those same establishment swampy type politicians we've always had. It could change and I could be completely wrong, but look at who he's cozying up to! Even if he were the messiah, there are too many devils in the house and senate to change anything. The President can only do so much. I'd love to be wrong, but I feel we are so fucked.
It's my view that you can't use the "people's will" argument when the majority of people didn't vote the winner. If the winner did get a majority of the popular vote, I would agree.
I would counter to say that what you listed were requirements, not qualifications. They're not the same. You can fulfill the requirements to apply to a job but still be grossly unqualified. And Trump is grossly unqualified.
No, that's not right. https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/faq.html#no270

Also the VP is chosen in a similar fashion, but is done by the senate. 
No. If no candidate gets at least 270 EVs, the decision will move to the house. At that point the representatives are only able to choose from the top 3 winners of the EVs (Clinton, Trump, and whoever else) and then if I remember correctly, the vote is a simple majority vote with each **state** getting 1 vote. 
That's literally not even relevant to the point. The point is that the electoral college was originally conceived as a check against the people, should a candidate that was unqualified for the position somehow gain popularity to win an election. By any metric Trump is wholly unqualified for POTUS based on experience, conflicts of interest, his personal beliefs about some groups of Americans, and dangerous opinions of the law and constitutional amendments.

Well if the folks from r/the_donald would stop banning people who have dissenting opinions maybe there would be discourse. But they keep banning people. They need their safe space. 
woosh
Lol
Though it shouldn't be the main goal or responsibility of the sub, but since r/s4p is one of the only subs that has anywhere near the level of engagement the r/the_donald has, I feel it is in part our responsibility to fight back against the constant misinformation and shitposting that r/t_d contributes to. It's not that we need to have a liberal voice that is as loud as theirs, but we need a voice on Reddit that calls out the shit for what is, shit.
I want to see r/s4p reopened full time devoted to campaigning for progressives and other democrats that are running in the 2018 mid-term elections, as well as anything relating to setting up the framework for a Sanders 2020 presidential campaign should he choose to run.

I don't have many or strong opinions about how to address your second question.

But as for your third, if Sanders doesn't run in 2020, I think r/s4p should STILL remain open and active to support the progressive nominee, should there be one. Sander's impact and legacy needs to stay alive regardless of the name of the sub. What matters is the people are already there and engaged. It makes no sense to me to abandon the user-base and start over.
I understand now. Thank you!
What does that have to do with fracking? Please help me understand!
What you said about the state of our government is true. He rode a wave of people asking and wanting something different in how the government works. Trump represented that change as an outsider, unfortunately. Hillary represented the status quo. I would also say that he duped people who voted for him, because he has begun to surround himself with establishment politicians.

But he still won. Establishment politics does have an embodiment, this year it was Hillary and her campaign, and clearly it doesn't work, because if it did she would have won (and I wish she did). Hopefully people see that now. 

To me, establishment politics describes politicians that do not push back against monied interests or do not campaign for change for the common man and woman. There aren't many who are doing that today and that's what's sad.

I think we will begin to see that change. I think we will see a movement sparked by outrage in Trump's rise to power to push back against him (who is the embodiment of big business), his cronies, and the money that is seriously corrupting our politicians ambitions and their credibility in the eyes of the public.

I apologize if I am not making myself clear, I'm a bit hungover. 😅
You're so wrong. 
I did actually, it just felt empty. It's hard for me to see when he's actually being sincere and to know what he really believes because he has been using theatrics so much. I wait patiently for him to prove himself worthy. I hope he is successful.

I love how even without being fluent in Chinese, I know exactly what this says. Me too thanks. 
Because a local rural economy is much smaller, and their costs of living would also be much smaller than areas of the country like large cities.

When the local economy is large and the cost of living is high, you need more money to live. Successful businesses would also have the capital to pay their workers larger wages because of their large customer base. Rural areas won't have the people power to fund a high minimum wage. 
it's not anime at all. it's an American made cartoon (with some Chinese influences). I'm seriously not splitting hairs here, the cultural influences are not at all the same. and honestly, it's way better than any Japanese show that I've seen. it's just a completely different genre.
to me, calling Avatar anime is like calling the justice league anime. it just isn't at all the same.

lol yeah I liked watching porn only when it was a hot girl with nice boobs and the guy wasn't ugly and had a six pack and was thin and had a big dick, and I quickly realized I was selecting porn more on the guy in it because 1) usually that means the girl is hotter 2) he's not gonna be ugly. I also almost exclusively searched for anal. what happens mostly in gay porn? oh that all makes sense.... hehh
Nail on the head with straight-egrity imo.  I don't see very many posts on here that deal with this part of straight culture especially as a guy discovering his bi self. Maybe just because it's important to me that I notice it most. Nice comment. 
I can definitely relate to gay porn thing... except not since I was 14, though I've been fantasizing then! Lol
When I first found out gay porn was a thing ohhhhh boy...
I swear you've described me exactly one year ago. This actually helps make me feel better! See my other comment, feel free to PM me too!
Dude I [M23] have been/am still going through that same thing! I've always had "gay" thoughts/feelings that i had justified and sort of ignored and your opinion about gay porn vs hetero porn is the same for me too. I've also been at the stage where I tried out tinder and started talking to people and it felt exactly like you've described. Without giving too much detail, it wasn't until just this last summer that I felt comfortable enough to actually pursue another guy sexually (I was abroad, ha) and it felt like a huge weight being lifted off my chest to actually follow through with and sort of validate what I had been feeling for years. I definitely (at least for now) have a much stronger preference for men than women, and am just starting to get comfortable with actually dating someone in my city (USA'. I struggle with the fact that I've been "straight" for basically my whole life and kind of being sort of repulsed by the "gay scene" that it's hard to not feel anxious about meeting people, as my biggest gripe with gay men in my area is that they're "too gay"... Basically, I wanna say that YES, it's happened to me, and it does pass/get better. You're not alone. 

PS- After you realize other guys think you're hot and they tell you so it's a big confidence boost and it certainly makes you feel more happy and secure in what you're doing. At least that's how it has been for me so far. 
nonsense your natural color is great. it matches your chosen colors very well, doesn't seem like a blonde at all to me I I, seems more auburn at least in that video. very nice.

> Again, that's lovely, eloquent, worthy of attention, and has almost nothing to do with this case.

This is where we have a fundamental disagreement. Why you come to the conclusion that none of what I said was related I don't fully understand. Because, it is perfectly legal to use LEGAL force against someone up until the fact the person no longer is a threat, and police are required to assist citizens regardless of what happened before hand, no matter the crime. You're right there. But that's not what happened. The cops failed to respond and act according to the law and their directive.

While I agree that everything leading up to the event was lawful (detaining, responding, etc.), the fact that it happened because of police incompetence and then avoided trial is a huge problem and directly related to this thread, for the reasons that I gave.

Final note, I believe that if this was brought to trial we would have heard the end of it and he wouldn't have become the 'poster child' as you say, if the officer was found not guilty. But, it's incredibly common for police not to be brought to trial for the killings of citizens. That's shady. 

But we both came here and expressed ourselves, and I personally didn't think I was yelling through text and I don't really think you were either, and if we continue to disagree, so be it. I can go to bed alright with what's happened here. Night.
> Nope. Not illegal, and not a chokehold. The move was in fact one taught at the police academy and still in use nationwide, because the contributing factors to his death were heart disease, asthma, and being morbidly obese. The hold played a small part in that.

See my post below. I will give you that it may not be literally against the law, but it has been banned.

> If someone's repeatedly yelling that they can't breathe, it's reasonable to assume they are getting air. People say all sorts of shit to get out of being detained, especially when they've raised hands to the cops right before being taken down. He died of a heart attack, not strangulation.

This is so damn stupid, it's like saying that a person screaming that they're drowning is enough to assume that they actually have enough air and their lungs aren't currently filling up with water. So if you were grabbing somebody by the neck and they were able to yell "I can't breathe" you wouldn't stop because you believe they're getting enough air? And his death wasn't due to his heart problems. See my source.

> Also department policy if you don't have the right gear and medico's are minutes away. For professionals that may face CPR situations far more often, the risk of exposure to blood borne diseases is high. That could be revisted. Assuming you're correct, as you've been wrong about everything else so far.

There were 4 EMTs called to the scene too late because the police on scene were incompentent and called too late. Then even THEY waited before giving CPR. A grown ass man falls to the ground and is unresponsive. You don't stand there, you ACT. See my source.

> Which means that actions contributed to his death, not that anyone "meant" for it to happen, or that it was "unavoidable".

...?? What?? Do you even know what this word means? [Homicide:](https://www.google.com/search?q=homicide&oq=homiciu&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.3019j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) the deliberate and unlawful killing of one person by another; murder. From the North American dictionary.

> Is the kind of bullshit bleeding hearts invent whenever the actual facts of a case don't fit the narrative they so desperately desire. The grand jury is a process. The correct process had the correct result, in this case.
This is what I mean by it being despicable that people are trying to bend the facts of the case to suit an agenda, no matter how "worthy" it is. This particular case? The guys not a hero, and the police were not wholly responsible for what happened. It was a tragedy that could have easily been avoided by not slinging illegal products, then fighting the police when caught.

See my post. The grand jury for Eric Garner was, in my opinion, abused and coerced into not seeking an indictment.

> Edit : For a country decrying racism against blacks, it sure seems like any and all black victims get a disproportionately "free pass" here on Reddit. I'm fairly sure he could have pulled a gun and you'd still be decrying this as "symptomatic of black oppression by the police state".

Oh fuck the hell off with this bullshit. Seriously. Also, see my 3 replies. I'm citing all my sources so you can form your own opinion and will mark a sentence with an @ to signify where fact becomes opinion. Otherwise, I have attempted to summarize only factual information and cite my source for all of it, let me know if something here isn't true and I'll fix it.
[edited formatting]  @ 

I don't believe the racial components and the systemic suppression of Brown people in America [14] shouldn't be addressed or talked about because it definitely should, as it directly affects me.

And it directly affects my family and many of my good friends. A lot of people are already talking about these effects now online and I think that's tremendously wonderful!

However these abuses and manipulations of the law affect everybody regardless of race.

Too often when this stuff happens people forget to discuss or ignore the universal legal dangers that affects everyone regardless of what you look like and it's incredibly important to talk about this too.
Being multi racial myself I think it's easier for me to take that stance and see it because I've experienced both sides of the coin, and have benefitted greatly by being a member of White and minority America in different situations. Sounds weird, but I've been mistaken for every race I can think of in this country (White, Latino, Asian, Hmong, Native American and even mulatto [but only once]). I am Euro/Polynesian/Native American for the record. So to a dirty cop I could be any of those things depending on whom I'm standing near.
And further still regardless of racial barriers everyone is bound by the law.
**You don't have to be Brown to be screwed by a cop. Or the system. But it undeniably helps it happen.....**

**Implications and Similarities/Dissimilarities** 

This is dissimilar to the Michael Brown case in many ways. 

* In Brown’s we had no reliable witness account from either point of view resulting in a massive conflagration of misinformation being spread, a suspect who had moments before death committed robbery where police were called, who allegedly initially provoked and assaulted an officer and was noncompliant, an officer allegedly acting in self-defense, and nationwide turned worldwide media coverage of the event as well as the violent and nonviolent reactions from civilians as a result of this case. 


@following 8 paragraphs are my opinion 
–
As different as these two cases are the similarities between Brown’s and Garner’s cases is striking and should not be overlooked.

In both Grand Jury presentations from the prosecution, the officers who would be charged were brought on as witnesses and were allowed to speak on their own behalf in defense of their actions before the Grand Jury, without first being subject to adversarial cross examination. [10]

It’s strange that in both cases the prosecutor would bring the potential defendant as their own witness before a Grand Jury, and let them essentially appeal directly to the group making the decision whether or not a charge is admissible and a trial is necessary.

To me, the prosecutor acted as if they were a defense attorney like in a court trial by a jury of peers, instead of acting as a prosecutor to aim for nothing except for indictment, which is their job, but not duty. It's literally so easy for a lawyer to convince a grand jury there is enough stuff to warrant a court case.

**“it’s really shocking that we have a police officer with this videotape, when all you really have to do is to show the tape, hand out the popcorn and say to the grand jury, "Well, how do you vote?" That’s how you secure an indictment on this case. You don’t have a big broad conversation about what the police officer was feeling at the time.” – Vincent Warren, a lawyer. [11]**

This is, in my armchair civilian opinion, is a great example of shenanigans and **I feel like we're witnessing an abuse of the grand jury.** They aren't the deciders of guilt, because that's what the full trial is for. Lately, it appears that grand juries have been led to believe that they should be trying to do all of it. ***That's just plain wrong.***

It doesn’t matter how you currently feel about the incidents in Ferguson, truthfully I am still on the fence about it. **With this case we all should be seriously worried.** Apparently some judicial systems and police organizations are deeply corrupted. How do you know your local precinct isn’t like this one? What would stop you from being victim to a similar fate?

Even though the US buy and large does use capital punishment as a legal sentence in court, but because of the 8th Amendment we do not include execution as a possible outcome unless a person is guilty of aggravated murder and is mentally competent. Typically, criminals go to court and have a trial.
Police are not knights in shining armor, nor are they judges of morality, nor are they a military force that fights the enemy. They are law enforcement, and we need law enforcement. We depend on them.
However, lack of accountability for excessive harm and in some cases even causing death to the citizens they are meant to protect is starting to disturb me greatly. Officers should be more scrutinized and regulated as enforcers of the law instead of being so easily forgiven. We must all understand they are putting their lives on the line every day for us. But we must also understand that they chose this line of work; they need to step up in professionalism, start whistleblowing against corruption, and show self and peer restraint to prove that they are worthy of wearing a badge. They should be people to admire, not people that we fear.

"I shot that guy because he might have hurt me, I didn't know what else to do, I felt threatened like the Hulk was attacking me." or "I didn't mean to kill him, I was panicked in the heat of the moment and felt like a chokehold was the only way I could ensure safety for everyone at the time." are things we should be expecting from ordinary untrained and scared civilians, not trained and armed officers. (I made these up by the way they aren’t actual quotes)

Instead, we should be able to say things like, "Wow. Did you see that cop? She risked her life to make sure she subdued the perp without harm. Wow. That’s why she's a police officer. I admire her. I respect her".

And you know what, I am probably more prone to say things as a part of the second scenario even now, because I am SURE that there are way more good people on the force than bad people. But rancid meat makes everyone sick, and I think we've got an epidemic on our hands.

* With Garner we have unbiased HD video of the entire incident from start to finish, no crime proved to have been committed, police instigated confrontation and police acting illegally and not in self-defense, and no initial nationwide media coverage, present worldwide coverage and very few if any violent reactions and many nonviolent civilian reactions.

[edited formatting] 
TL;DR At the beginning for you guys– Someone filmed an entire incident in broad daylight from start to finish. In that incident a man died because a cop used a chokehold on that man. The autopsy report concluded the death was a homicide. Grand Jury did not indict the officer. A different Grand Jury did indict the person who filmed the whole thing on a weapons charge. [12] 
-= @ SYMBOL MEANS THIS IS MY OPINION =-
@This is important. What we've seen here is that an officer can break the law and even kill someone without having to go to court for it. What’s stopping the exact same thing from happening to you? Not your skin color, since no matter what you are not immune to police confrontation and apparently they are immune to the judicial system.
@ We need police, and we also need police to be held to the highest legal standard of accountability available to prevent and combat corruption but until then, citizens are not safe given the degree to which our justice system now appears to be corrupted.
(Judge has released only 4 pages of official documents of grand jury details [13]
NOW for the nitty gritty details.
> **Eric Garner has had a history of multiple arrests including sale of untaxed cigarettes. [1]**

In July of this year, after an altercation with police instigated by police, allegedly because of Garner’s past record and suspicion that illegal selling of cigarettes was happening, Eric Garner was killed by “compression of the neck” by an officer. The NYC Medical Examiner of Garner has stated that preexisting asthma, high blood pressure and obesity were contributors of additional complications leading to his death. [2] [3]
> **The Medical Examiner in conclusion of the autopsy report has considered Garner’s death a homicide. [3]**

Basically, as New York law is written today, you can't use deadly force if the crime you're arresting someone for is not a felony. [4] [6]

1.  In NY selling non-taxed cigarettes is a tax code violation. It can become felonious if it is extensive (sale of 10k cigarettes or more) or if a person has previous convictions. [5]
2.  In NY according to § 205.30, resisting arrest is a class A misdemeanor. [7]
3. In NY chokeholds have been banned for use by police for 21 years (since 1993) [8]
4. TIME interview with the person who shot the video (also indicted on a weapons charge [9]), and you can watch it in link [9] and others listed below.

Here is NY law in a simplified breakdown, complete text is available via my sources.

* § 125.15 Manslaughter in the Second Degree [4]
A person is guilty of manslaughter in the second degree when: 1. He recklessly causes the death of another person; or 2. He commits upon a female an abortional act which causes her death, unless such abortional act is justifiable pursuant to subdivision three of section 125.05; or 3. He intentionally causes or aids another person to commit suicide. Manslaughter in the second degree is a class C felony.
It has been held that even if a defendant is justified in using deadly physical force at the beginning of a single, ongoing encounter with an assailant, his right to use that force terminates at the point where he can no longer reasonably believe that the assailant still poses a threat to him (see, People v. Reeder, 209 A.D.2d 551, 618 N.Y.S.2d 839; People v. Cox, 203 A.D.2d 7, 610 N.Y.S.2d 15, lv. denied 83 N.Y.2d 1003, 616 N.Y.S.2d 484, 640 N.E.2d 152).

* § 35.30 Justification; use of physical force in making an arrest or in preventing an escape [6]
A police officer or a peace officer, in the course of effecting or attempting to effect an arrest, or of preventing or attempting to prevent the escape from custody, of a person whom he or she reasonably believes to have committed an offense, may use physical force when and to the extent he or she reasonably believes such to be necessary to effect the arrest, or to prevent the escape from custody, or in self-defense or to defend a third person from what he or she reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of physical force; except that deadly physical force may be used for such purposes only when he or she reasonably believes that:
(a) The offense committed by such person was:
(i) a felony or an attempt to commit a felony involving the use or attempted use or threatened imminent use of physical force against a person; or
(ii) kidnapping, arson, escape in the first degree, burglary in the first degree or any attempt to commit such a crime; or
(b) The offense committed or attempted by such person was a felony and that, in the course of resisting arrest therefor or attempting to escape from custody, such person is armed with a firearm or deadly weapon; or
(c) Regardless of the particular offense which is the subject of the arrest or attempted escape, the use of deadly physical force is necessary to defend the police officer or peace officer or another person from what the officer reasonably believes to be the use or imminent use of deadly physical force.

Dude, the hold that they put Eric in was illegal. The police shouldn't have been holding for that long, and ***absolutely*** they should've let go when he said he couldn't breath, not keep holding him. **AND NOBODY EVEN TRIED TO USE CPR.** Like, ***seriously??*** a grown as man collapsed and nobody did anything. A medical examiner determined it was homicide. A grand jury decided through possible coercion that there wasn't enough probable cause to indict the officer. We have a video of his death via banned chokehold and that's not enough for it to be brought to trial?

This is the most inspired I've ever been seeing your transformation! Good work! Question though, for your work outs both in home and at the gym what were your time constraints (e.g. rest between sets, total length of workout)? Also were those exercises listed in the order you did them?
Well that's pretty neat!
yeah wtf does this mean?
I just recently got my bachelors in chemistry and am looking forward to going to grad school. How can I work toward getting involved with CANN and possibly help contribute to the subdivision of the ACS in the future? Really glad to here that this is being legitimized by the ACS!

I've always heard it called "resting asshole" but it also sounds a bit funny.
I'm saying that I found the website for Ranch 99 but when you search their website for baijiu you get nothing, which is sad unless I'm doing it wrong...? I'm from MN btw
I think I found it after a google search and the store search field came up without results :(
Revenge is best served with a side of baijiu.
Thanks!
Is that a website or a liquor company? Annything else to help me find it would be nice. Either way I'll google it.
Haha I'll keep that in mind. I hadn't really thought about extra import prices.
Thank you, when i get back home I'll have to check my local stores!
I think it's a typo though, a pretty big typo, of glass over the middle east for the same nuclear attack reasons.

Ok. You bring up a lot of logical points why an extended weekend would be weird/bad. my only solution to your point of pressure voting after results are shown is simply to not show results unless all voting places are closed. 


Your other points are harder to deal with I think. I like your post. Thank you!
I seriously don't understand why everyone is hellbent on "voting day" and having it all be finished in 24 hours. Just make it a weekend with wide hours.
Why not 3-day voting weekend? Why does it all have to be done in one day?
No matter why it appears to be happening it's still a cool effect that makes me super jealous of hazel eyes. You're lucky!
haha got it
May I ask were you born without it or did you have it surgically removed? Do you have medical issues from its absence? Interesting stuff!
I have one clearly black eye and one brown eye. On the sclera of my black eye I have several black "freckles" (pigment spots) which are harmless but very interesting. 
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
This is just having hazel eyes. If you have hazel eyes you have varying amounts of no pigment (blue), brown, and green pigments in your iris. The pattern and color arrangement in your eye can change how you and others perceive your own eye color based on what you're wearing or what's around you, accenting certain colors in your eye. Eye color does naturally change slightly as you age but only during significant events in life (e.g. first 6 years after birth, puberty) but what you're describing is a common phenomenon of hazel eyes. They don't actually change. It's still cool though and I wish I had hazel eyes...


If your eyes actually do dramatically change color frequently you should see a doctor as that is not normal and could be a problem. 
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
That sounds like genital herpes. I'd go to a doctor.

Can you link it? I went comment diving and didn't see it. Thanks.
I realize my questions are slightly political in nature, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on these questions as someone in the field because I feel these are very important questions for the advancement of green energy and they have bugged me for a long time! Thank you so much for doing the AMA, your comments and work is very interesting!

* Humans are unfortunately very selfish. A country I imagine is somewhat the same, in that the concerns or needs of one country may be completely ignored by another (e.g. Russia's recent relationship with Ukraine).

* I'd imagine a developing nation might be concerned with housing and feeding their people, and then may be especially concerned with educating them.


* Developed nations may not share the concerns a devoping nation might have as strongly because they've already (speaking generally though, no country is perfect) solved those problems and are allowed to think about bigger issues. As well, developed countries (like the US) produce a tremendous amount of CO2 and polution, which is usually disproportionate in their waste production compared to developing countries (except maybe China).

* I believe this lands us in a funny situation. As you said in your introduction, advancements in clean energy has been stymied by lack of awareness, and also probably a lack of understanding of clean energy and its impacts. In another comment, you say it's better to build clean energy along with infrastructure, because integrating a clean energy grid later can be very expensive (e.g. solar panels on an apartment building). A developing nation seems to be in a 'sweet spot' for building clean energy because they can skip a step in very dirty advancements like other countries have had to go through if they would turn the lights on greenly as it advances. Unfortunately though it seems incredibly attractive for a developing nation to use lots of coal to do the same thing, while the developed nation might have more money to try and tackle a big problem like fixing the planet.


Do you think clean energy is a first world problem, because of a developing nation might not be able to justify the cost?

How do you convince a developing nation to help fix a global problem which could be said to be caused more so by the western world?

How do you convince China, one of the top polluters and a developing country, to use greener energy and enforce it when most of the Chinese are still impoverished?

Are politics the only hope, in the form of world government subsidies, political pressure,and a heavy worldwide carbon tax?

Do you think fearmongering death by global climate change could actually kick our rear in gear, since science, logic, and reason has failed to breach the wall of money in fossil fuels and human selfishness?

Again, thank you for taking your time to be here today.
Nice!
There are absolutely no antidepressants in cigarettes. Addiction to cigarettes is strictly from nicotine and any antidepressant qualities are from the mental and physical addiction to nicotine.
You did! Thank you. Last question, is your iPhone at the default resolution or is it upscaled to say, iPhone 6?
Is the widget just in a default repo? I having some trouble.
Also, how did you get the If Found to sit nicely undneath Cataracs?
Finally, the shortcuts used by Grabby, are those default, or are they custom made? Thanks man ahead of time. Looks cool!
Right, because yelling at your kid excessively will *never* have negative consequences on their emotional and cognitive development. 
So lets say I have a 5S that is upscaled to a 6 resolution. Should I use the 5S download link or the 6 download link?

How does one find that thread?
Preloading rats with tryptophan and 5-HTP before they were tripping on Molly reduced the possibility/severity of brain damage post trip, evidenced by the concentrations of certain brain chemicals in certain brain regions. The data suggests that low serotonin levels post trip leads to brain damage, and the finding is discussed in detail in the paper. The paragraph suggests Tryptophan and 5-HTP is good because it turns into new serotonin, and that's good because Molly reduces concentration of serotonin which can give users (rats, humans) brain damage and may give users serotonin disorder which is basically super-depression and is lethal.
Been inside that one multiple times. Beautiful view and art from inside. Love that place. It is super dangerous however inside as there's lots of pit falls and missing stairs. Of course that hasn't stopped us from going in totally blind in the dark, the thrill is what keeps us going. 
Wonderful! I always tread lightly despite being asked for advice especially when giving advice on how to raise a child. Never know how things may be misinterpreted. 


As someone already mentioned about appetite, that may be a side effect that is completely unavoidable. Snaking all day and drinking plenty of water will help maintain relatively normal amounts of hunger pangs.


The growth suppression isn't really due to the medication itself if I recall correctly but mainly due to the effect on appetite. Still something to consider and discuss with the pediatrician. 


medication for a lot of patients is the best option so still keep it in mind. But if they aren't "ready" for it then it may not be the best option for them at that time. 


As for personality, contrary to what others have said in my case it did change mine. But again, I was young. It made me very quiet when I am normally out going. I would describe it as "I'm not fun when I take my pill. Its not me." I stopped in middle school and kept it off and on but was majorly off it through high school and even in college. I am stubborn and believed I could out grow it or beat my adhd. Want until I swallowed my pride after a break down that I went back on out last year. Now that I'm.older it has worked much better than it ever has before. I wish I was on it freshman year of college but the difference I experience now is enough. I wasn't ready then, but I am ready now. 


Finally keep up with the structure! That's very important. Also if you both choose to use medication consider Saturday and maybe even Friday as off days. Saves pills for during the week and also gives tone to relax.


Speaking of relaxation, video games are probably the most addicting thing. Is stimulating and fun like crack. Moderation is key.


Are you from the US? If so please pm me because I have stuff to share about the politics of these medications. 
You're beautiful. :)
Some background of me first- I was diagnosed at 10, started medication soon after, lived through it, and I'm now about to graduate from college. The road will be tough but not impossible to travel on. I have also been a camp counselor for several years and had some ADHD children in my groups.


If I were to give a single tip, it would be to encourage him to go out for or try out for sports. Aerobic exercise is incredibly helpful for most people with ADHD management, as well as it is healthy for those without ADHD. Having an extra surge of dopamine from exercise and being able to expend built up hyperactive energy could help him be more relaxed throughout the day, in addition be more manageable for you. I don't mean that in harshness, but as someone who was once an ADHD child I remember when I was calmer my parents were less stressed and didn't yell as much. In addition to alleviating stress, it also gives an outlet for him to make friends.


Please don't take this next part the wrong way. In my experience at camp with ADHD childern, getting attention to listen to tasks and instructions is sometimes difficult. What I have found that works well for me is physical contact. I have found touch is harder to ignore and makes it easier to get attention. I would also recommend making eye contact since this helps keep attention. You may consider asking your child to repeat back to you what he heard; this way you can correct a misunderstanding right away. 


In practice this could be you dictating a task first verbally, if that fails do it again but this time hold onto him or touch him in some way while you dictate and are making eye contact, then have him repeat back to you or ask him if he has any questions. Often despite seeming like he isn't paying attention or listening, they are. If he tells you he didn't hear you at all, believe him and repeat.


Based on what I've observed in others and my own personal experience, he may have a difficult time making friends. ADHD children do tend to be emotionally immature, and therefore can be socially immature for their age. Sports can help in this area as more interaction with children his age may help fill a deficit.


Have him take advantage of using extra time for tests/quizzes, distraction free area, and other accommodations in school. "Boring" subjects may become the bane of his existence. Try and help him find a way to make them more interesting. In subjects like math, understanding may come slow as learning WHY it's important may not be clear at all. I found tangible real world examples or applications to subjects like math and others help children and me understand and learn something new. You may want to disclose ADHD to his elementary and later on to his middle and high school teachers so they are aware as well as well as making sure they understand the kind of behavior to expect etc. Since they are with him 90% of the day during the week, they may be able to focus on him or reinforce those habits. His school may have a policy about having medication in school- you should consider how that might affect how medication is taken/administered (Eg by the school nurse outside of class or by self).


Of course, everyone procrastinates, but ADHD people are pros. Leaving things to the last moment and staying up late to get it done may be common. Try and teach good study habits when you believe he is ready so that middle and high school aren't so difficult. ADHD people function well with consistency. Consistency can help them remember important tasks.


Getting a good night sleep is important for everyone, but may be hard to achieve. Stimulant medication may make it difficult to fall asleep, and therefore may make it difficult to wake. Personally I wouldn't try and "fix" this with supplements or sleep aids unless it becomes a huge problem, and of course you should consult this with his pediatrician.


Meds- There are many options out there, and depending on your insurance situation they can be expensive. Many pharmaceutical companies have coupons that are downloadable directly from their websites and there are also certain ADHD foundations that help families reduce how much they pay. Also know that at a pharmacy the generic version of the drug is exactly the same and is usually much cheaper than name brand (eg Focalin XR 30mg 100% mark up cost VS dexmethylphenidate 30mg 50% mark up cost - (for me in the past the difference was near $300 vs $150). I'd prefer to have the generic version as much as possible if I were you because it will always be cheaper. There are stimulants and nonstimulants, the right one for your child will only be found after considering your family's medical history and possibly through trial and error, and titration of dosage. Finding the "right one" may take time.


Regarding medication- Listen to your child if he doesn't like it. Certain meds carry with them a laundry list of side effects (notably appetite loss, which isn't fun at all). If your child doesn't fully understand the use and/or doesn't like how they make him feel (physically/mentally/emotionally), he may voluntarily stop taking them (as far as throwing them away or flushing them) and lead you to believe that all is well. This can be an expensive waste of money. Thankfully there are many different options in medications and dosage amounts and frequency dosing; so if one method isn't working you can try something else.


More about medication effects- Of course his pediatrician will go into more details with you, but I'd still like to share what I know. Since we are dealing with the brain, everything from nutrition to exercise to sleep deficits can affect how the medication is metabolized and how obvious the effects are and how well it works. Sometimes he might say "it didn't work today" or that he "can't feel it". When this happens many things can be at play. Inadequate dosage, took it at the wrong time, didn't sleep well, didn't exercise, etc. It may be helpful to keep a log of what you or child does on the days the pill works well and incorporate them into his daily routine. Everybody is different, so the prerequisites needed for your child to have a "good day" with the medication working well with minimal bad side effects will be different from others, and may have to change as he gets older. It'll take time but eventually you and your child will be able to figure it out.


When I was 10, being told I needed to take medication because I had some kind of invisible problem didn't make me fell good at all and frankly scared me a lot. It was a huge challenge to my sense of self and perception of reality. I thought something was wrong with me, that I was different from my friends in a bad way. Back then, I thought that you only take medication if you're sick, and I didn't believe that I was "sick". I was fine as far as I could tell, and I didn't think anything needed to change. My mind and body were not down for "fixing me", and I resisted a lot.


Based off my own personal experience, I would have preferred to wait on medicating before high school; at the earliest I would have liked to start medicating in middle school. I say this only because I wasn't emotionally mature enough to understand why I had to take it (which led to resistance and strife). I have also seen in camp that some medicated young children don't socialize much or very well at all, which was also true for me. 


When struggling through adversity, as much as physical effort is important, mental effort and optimism is also important. The frame of mind a person is in can directly affect how successful they are. In this case, if a patient doesn't believe in the treatment (medication) they will be more likely to discount it or outright refuse it.


That being said, I would encourage you to try and let it be your child's choice whether they want to take medication, or at least convince them thoroughly why they should take medication. That being said, for as many times that I have seen people poorly affected by their meds, I have also seen people who are only positively affected by their meds. Prime examples are my cousins of 12 (girl) and 9 (boy), both ADHD who are also taking medication, have reported 0 bad side effects with generic focalin xr and they have friends and are maturing well. I hope your son experiences the same!


Certain medications can stunt the growth of height in children. In addition the high amount of internal chemical and hormonal changes occurring in growth may make finding an effective dose difficult since the child's chemical environment is changing constantly.
Concerns about physical growth effects due to medication may be something you should consult with his pediatrician and will likely be something your pediatrician is already monitoring.


In summary/TL;DR, having a child with ADHD and having to manage ADHD can be difficult, but it can also be totally pain free. Work together to minimize bad side effects, practice good study habits early, participate in sports or exercise, eat well and communicate with each other. PM me if you want me to expound more or want to talk.

I would really love it if you posted links though, if not through email but on here.
Haha thanks! I got the email about being on the waiting list. I appreciate the post! If you wouldn't mind setting up an automatic forward of the links to email I would greatly appreciate it!

Well now its passed, so now what?
I'm so sorry. Your story just made me bawl out because my cockatiel Phoebe died the exact same way. And how the news was broke to me and how I reacted was nearly identical to your story it's unreal. Seriously, to dad getting the news first, mom as you walked in, the cage, the couch, ... Wow. Only difference was that I knew in my gut something was wrong and I wanted to take her to the vet but my parents thought she'd be alright. I could feel something bad was going to happen... And I was right. I was too sad to be angry with my parents for not listening to me. I like to think that if we brought her in she might have been saved, but idk... 

From one egg tragedy sufferer to another, *hugs* 
I actually think this idea sounds really good. I could see myself using a device like this as I too have tried to use similar multi tasking tools before with my phone but with very little consistency.
I would love to talk with you more about this or even partner or something to get this done. PM me please I have a lot of ideas I think you'll like!
how did you make this
Aww, sorry.
Gotcha. I also agree that iFile is way better paid than free because you can use the search function. What you're saying now makes more sense, thanks. Also don't read what I've said with any harshness. I wasn't in that kind of mood, just confusion I guess. peace
No, it's from Phantom. Look for it in Phantom settings within snapchat.
> iFile if you can pay and be a registered user, otherwise get Filza.

Implies (to me anyway) that you shouldn't get iFile unless you pay for it to be registered because it is unusable which isn't true. But it's still possible to do everything you need to or ever want to do with it if you don't want to get a license. I've noticed lately people shoo away from iFile based on the premise that you have to pay in order to use it, which isn't true. That's all.
What are you talking about? Ifile is free. You *can* pay but you don't have to unless you want to unlock search functions. 
It doesn't have to be an exact port. You can revise it to fit ios, just like every other lock/unlock tweak. I don't think android lock xt uses android code to fit ios 8 for example. 
It's *PROTEAN* not protein.

Also have you tried multitasking a video/streaming app along with another app and noticed anything?
How in the hell do you have over 100% capacity on your battery?
That's what thinking. Since this is a beta release I am not really surprised, but this is also available for the 4S and I've seen people are using ReachApp. I wonder what they're experience is with it.
Edited. Do you have ReachApp?
much obliged
how did you get your flair to list the ios version? thanks
Lockhtml 3! I'd like to beta test pretty please!
yeah and even on the 6 resolution it was still lopsided just as much as it is now. On'y had the 6+ resolution for 2 days now though.
I very much agree. I've upscaled mine to 6+, and yeah the beta version for me said that my iOS version isn't supported so... That must be why. It works alright in the actual music app, but the cover art is skewed waaaay to the left side of the screen (not centered). meh
Ok so I couldn't buy the beta version on my 5S w/8.1 so I got it from another source but it's the same version number. I don't know. Somthing else might be interfering with it...

Are you upscaled at all to a higher resolution?
I have lockhtml 3!
Lol

There was a post a few days ago about how to convert any html to any kind of widget format. I have yet to try it myself. 

And I agree about all of those points you make no need for a :),  no problem. ;) haha

Anyway, my 5S is on a 6+ resolution and I alsi want something bigger... I'm still waiting for ios blocks to come out and I think that'll be the best widget to ever come out honestly. 
Community here seems to hate widgets or something because they're do hard to find!
Thank you! what ios are you running?
Not really. It could work exactly like instalauncher does, except there would be no alphabet bar and everything would be in one or several pages (like the recents page and favorites page of instalauncher) and to launch the app drawer you would push an icon instead.
check out my comment to OP
Stripe, Cataracs, Zooropalg widgets, stuff from the reddit community repo, and you could even check out convergance 2 (that spelling is accurate to the name btw)
How did you get custom cover to work? I can't get it to display on my lockscreen at all :/
Want. Can I be a beta tester? Or something? This is great.
How did you get the reachability view to be an even split? when I enable it I have only 1/4 screen for the reachability view and the rest for the other app..... Do you have your phone upscaled to a higher resolution?
yeah I agree with that part about it being cumbersome.
When I did it my messages app was two columns in portrait mode. Imagine the 6+ rotated left or right in the messages app but instead of a landscape scale it's in portrait mode. In this way I had a bunch of funny issues like not being able to invoke the keyboard and other weirdness.

Saw you're using ReachApp, did you find a way to get the reachability view to even out or just be larger? Ease of use yadda yadda

Also about your scaling of the resolutions from before- was there a specific goal in mind in, like a target aspect ratio?
That's cool. I liked the way it looked when I did it but the phone stated behaving in the stock apps funny, as of I was always using some rotation function. How did you mitigate those effects?
Now mine is like an ipad haha

How did you figure out these resolution values?
How'd it work?
So then what should we naming it then? Anything specific, or could i name it tomato or something?
you need reachall
Please tell me this fixes the problem upscale has with constantly killing mobile mail
I feel sad you were downvoted, probably because you mention god. People suck. I'm glad you find happiness in other's happiness!

Yeah so Odin comes with like 9 sbhtmls. Which one do you have enabled?
True. If it's a matter of math I could help out if you want. I know my way around I file and style/config files alright. Let me know
Hi, thanks for these detailed instructions! By any chance is your 5S upscaled? I'm on a 5S running the 6 resolution, did you make a modification to fit the 6's resolution?

oh then i think i already have it! Where was it located at? or was it like a winterboard extension thing?
I can't find the tweak you used for your lckscreen music display. What repo did you get it from?
Gotham has pretty much been thrown around all over the place since it was released. I don't think it was ever paid originally either. You're fine.
Sounds sweet. Thanks for the extra detail
No we've all heard these before. And I'm also surprised that he was the thing to start it all. Actually it's quite ironic. However not to say this progress isn't good.
It's buggy but I like it! It's nice to have a messages customizing tweak again. Keep at it and don't get discouraged!

I like the random mode!
Alright thanks, I'll check it out then.
How did you flip cataracs on it's side like that? Mind telling me how?
I must apologize but I am having trouble following your second paragraph. I'm getting confused because I'm unsure of which comments you're referring to, you're, mine or the OP. 

Like I already said before, the Op was a bit snarky but I definitely think you could've responded without being condescending. I didn't read your response as angry or as yelling, but certainly condescending, even a little immature. Maybe that wasn't your mindset when composing but that is how I interpret it. If I'm doing it there are bound to be others with my same view; being condescending is not professional. I'm not asking you to be pandering but instead to have more grace. And you know OP wasn't acting poorly to you as a person.

Keep in mind that this post wouldn't have the magnitude of popularity as it has if it weren't for its users believing that there is more work to be done. This isn't telling you that the improvements cydia has gotten are wasted it is saying that there is room for more. Consider the fact that some of op's requests are already present in cydia. Clearly the ui isn't intuitive enough for the features to be obvious, otherwise it wouldn't be asked. 
I know you sink a lot of personal time into cydia, but don't take OP's criticisms personally since these are not attacks on your character. 

Products receive criticism constantly and how the organization handles criticism speaks volumes, and as the inventor and manager of the product it speaks more regardless of whether or not you were responding as a moderator, you're still a moderator here and the inventor-we all know.

Again without a doubt your service has changed my life based on the modifications I am abletop carry out on my phone. It's a wonderful work of art really, and oh am I thankful for the ability to do so. Peace.
Right I saw that comment but that was about the theme not about your sbhtml theme. 
Are you asking for donations for both right now?
Your other post doesn't even have your info. So what is it?
Dude. I don't know if I'm just grossly off base, but come on. Can you really not respond calmly to criticism? It's incredibly unprofessional sounding to chastise a user of your service especially on a public forum. You could at least say something along the lines of:

Come on man. The post was maybe a little snarky but it's just some constructive criticism.

And yes I am going to sprinkle my comment with praise, because I do love Cydia. And I'd love Cydia to have some improvements too because it has so much potential to be even better and user friendly. 

Edit: Crucify my comment if you must. I don't care, my opinion still stands firm. Saurik should exhibit more grace toward his users on a public forum of which he is a moderator. Professionalism people.
Good for you. I'm glad you and him are being open with each other and talking through this. :)
Honestly I thought this us what it looked like until I rewatched the trailer
It works!
Alright I'll report back
Maybe people have already made you aware of this part as well, but Jim's character is from the movie dumb and dumber, where he plays a very stupid person. So it's supposed to be read one way only, and that way is your second scenario.
I really think you should aplogize if you haven't already and share this revelation you've had with him. I really think it'll help you and him reconcile a come to an even deeper understanding with each other. It might feel like loosing face, which it probably is, but it'll be important to talk about. 
Let's say the indictment happened, and the case went to court. What kind of verdict do you think would have been found by the jury? I'd like to hear your opinion. 


Remember that all evidence was presented and is now public. 


I believe Wilson would have been found innocent by the jury. Likewise, I believe the public reaction To the case given a not guilty verdict would have been far worse. Therefore I think it may have been better that this never went to trial at all. Thats just my theory. But what do you think?
Agreed.
Toxicology report states he tested positive for marijuana, so nothing that has been shown to cause aggressive behavior, and while that was in his system it doens't necessarily show that at the time of the incident he was actually high.
You are not it drives me up a wall.
5S iOS 8.1 and I can do all that you ask.  Me and I'll give it a go for you
> Disable vibrations when phone gets unlocked and re enable when I lock it.

Heads up about this one, for whatever reason this set up in activator made it so that sound preferences get reset to defaults and any changes to a custom setting won't save. Anyway that's just my experience.
Curious. Did the Apex 2 - mikoto conflict also cause bootloops? I didn't have alwaysfirstswipe nor did I have the notification setting enabled in mikoto. Then again I do have boover which you know changes badge settings. 
Lol sorry! She hasn't gotten back my message but I recommended instalauncher!
Hey I do have that set up, thank you!
I'll disable it and see. 

Did you have to reboot or reboot after disabling that feature?
Definitely do.
Ha.

No it doesn't and I'm actually super fucking pissed that it hasn't been updated yet. It would be so damn useful... especially tonight when Hideme8 was sending me to safemode non stop. I installed it tonight though because I was curious to see if it still had the ability to create crash reports even though the interface won't work.

And to my delight, it does! I was able to find them when I SSH'd and I could read them. Although it still wan't useful, still told me it crashed at thread 0 with literally no useful information :/
Here is my list of stuff installed on my 5S on 8.1 who also experienced a boot loop from the last update.

I'd like to point out as well that HideMe8 was the source of several safemode crashes as well as random safemode crashes.

If it's all the same to you I'm gonna move this to pm so we don't clog up this "crisis" thread haha
You and I have nearly identical installations.
Thanks for clarifying this for us.
**DANGER DANGER WILL ROBINSON** 

I'm with you girl! iPhone 5S iOS 8.1 here and we've got boot loops galore! 
Hideme8 was the culpreit for me. Constant safe mode crashes when I locked my phone, and when I tried to move icons about.
You're booting into safe mode because iWidget is not fully iOS8 compatible. I had the same problem about booting into safe mode after installations along with a whole bunch of other problems all caused by iwidget.
Yeah, I think it would be easier on your eyes you know, cool wallpaper too. Could I get that link? What Alkaline theme is that?
Thanks man! Is the battery icon an alkaline theme?
Are you using the condensed version or non condensed?
You might be gone, but could you upload or pm me what you did to the style file? It looks real neat.
Change the clock to black. It's nearly impossible to read right now on that background, but that's just my opinion.
I'm also waiting for status bar theming and also applying themes that affect the lockscreen grabbers (like the camera grabber) 
Oh I see now. In their eyes they're protecting the original owner in case the device was stolen. From
Their end there's only one way to do it. Hope you get in touch with the original owner!
Oh, well if you were asking for a return/refund that would be the reason; once it's exchanged to the customer they can't touch it unless the purpose is for disposal of the pills depending on if the pharmacy is equipped to.

I've had to exchange pills after going from a weak dose to a stronger one. Because my doc didn't want me to have nearly 60 high dose pills to protect her ass and mine, by my doc's requirement, I needed to turn them in to the pharmacist for disposal before being allowed to fill my stronger script. Of course, laws may vary by region.
True but if they're ruined in theory all I would need to do is turn them into my clinic or pharmacy before being reissued another bottle. The inconvenience is the time and the commute to and from. finger crossed
Thanks, gives me some hope. It'd be a large inconvenience if I needed to go get a new script so I'm hoping they're relatively unaffected.
That actually makes 0 sense. It's on them not the other guy at this point. Call one of their customer service lines don't go to a store to get it done, because the store representatives don't have a lot of power.
I bet you could work that out with T-Mobile though. You're not the first nor the last to ever be in that situation anyway.
Pretty sure there is no unlocking charge though. They do have clauses in their policy regarding unlocking phones that sometimes includes a fee depending on the circumstances, but it's not really a fee for unlocking the phone from the network. They charge if they're dealing with someone who is still under contract, if the phone isn't paid off or if they're dealing with someone who doesn't have a mobile account with them already, or if their account has already unlocked the maximum number of devices already. I guess you could say that it isn't free because charges can follow though but as I understand the information the "price" depends on the situation.
Sometimes to unlock a phone from the primary provider requires a new or a hacked SIM card.
Also, the device serial numbers are registered with the carrier network so the numbers need to be removed from their systems too. Carriers already take devices off their networks so users can switch if they want to for free, all you need to do is ask them. This is how it works in the US anyway.
Maybe a dumb question, but since there's no animate fix for iOS 8 yet, that would mean the fix for 7 wouldn't work either right?
huh. alright, thank! I have hsdesigner and that's probably whats happening... 
no problemo. 
Using upscale to change your red modify a icon size slightly. Only use i6 red for an iPhone 5/s tho cuz 6+ res breaks it
What do you have installed?
Only worked for me after I updated to 8.1
I also can't get my bar to move, even though my settings are adjusted to yours exactly. Can you remember anything else you did to make the page bar move while scrolling?
When you get it, before it opens you can see what is it was shipped with by checking the serial number online. I bet you could go to an Apple Store and ask them to give you instead a phone that comes stock with 8.1 instead if yours comes with 8.0
That's what I think. Unfortunately I need/want both to work. But also op is having the problems but may not have bio whatever installed too. Oh woe is us…
Wish crash reporter worked again so we can see what's actually up
Yes I am. Same stuff, I also have bio protect installed too though. 
Thanks man that all makes sense. Cydia's giving me a weird error message when I try and download iconbundles from big boss now though, so when I figure that out it should work I hope. 
Keeps telling me it can't find the files for the package. Maybe it's my internet not getting through 
Thank you!
I haven't searched myself yet, but did you manage to find a method to theme the clock that works well? Just wondering. 
No you're being down voted because people here are idiots. iFile is free, you can pay for extra features. You can mod all you want without paying for it like I did, only you can't do some functions which are very useful. 
Easiest way though I think is to ssh into your phone with a PC/Mac program
Were you able to figure it out? I also can only get the bar to show up but unfortunately the bar doesn't move.
thanks
**SOLVED**

Problem was a flex 2 tweak to eliminate wallpaper zoom ins with folders. Wallpaper returned, rotate+ is a little fucked up though still. 
iPhone 5s. Was working fine until I tried fixing things... Reboot didn't help either
I hope so, it's too bad.
Well then what good is this if I can't have more than one home screen? That's stupid. Also it's broken on the last page too.

The animation runs to show as a vertical column on the right side but then it immediately torques up to be like the picture. 
I'm have Rotate+ installed on my 5S on 8.1 along with Betterfivecolumnhomescreen and Five icon dock. Anyone else have the problem/have a fix or work around?
Haha it's all good
it already does this. Try using a nonregistered finger and you can see the effect while it's exaggerated. But it does happen.
Y'all are great  
Alright. Returning to regular res is a temporary solution though. So at least there's that 
Yes... :/ any way around it?
Lame! I am. Any way around it?
Hahaha oh my god yes that's hilarious I didn't know that was visible
"Dope animals"
Ma nigga
Yeah and I can eat while they're on. When I'm off I forget and talk too much 
wow. I just reread what I wrote, and damn I screwed that up haha! I'll have to fix that right now...
It's supposed to be funny, man.
she's Pocahontas from the Disney movie Pohcahontas. Chill. 
cool
> We can now see whether you can run kittens in your apps

wut
Ok, cool. I'm gonna try and get on this And look up my state's laws. Thanks! 
Alright if you remember I'm interested. I've also been going in every ~30 so days to get my script for focalin xr, only a few days early though while at school. While in my hometown I was able to have a set up where a nurse just wrote my script and had it available for pickup without an appointment which was nice.
The differences between this and what I read on the DOJ's website is interesting. What I read said that they can't post-date scripts, meaning to me that they can't be marked as a date in the future to be filled. But maybe it means they can't write a script on monday and date it so that it says friday. But your law seems to be able to be interpreted as you state below.

Huh. So does the doctor give you three slips per visit every 90 days, assuming he doesn't require a followup mid session?
I get your confusion now. I apologize for being rude as well. Your post appeared to me as very ignorant which is why I responded in the way I did. I have very strong opinions about medicine/drugs and medicine/drug related laws especially regarding medications I take. I am a college student myself, and I hear very often from others ignorant things about drugs and the rampant misuse of the medications you and I need. Likewise I tend to go off a little on these subjects. After reading your comments above I see now that you do intend to ask the consulate and for that I applaud you.

Now I'm not gonna even pretend I know anything about European law, because I don't know squat. The following is only going to be conjecture based on other experiences. Brandishing a script for an internationally considered controlled substance from an American doctor in a non American country after which the drugs in question were brought into the country without prior permission from the government and found by border patrol while you're being checked by customs might not be as useful as you think. They could assume it's a forgery, or that you're a drug trafficker, or a number of other things, and choose to rifle through all of your things to find all of the other drugs you might be carrying. And believing that they won't lock you up because you would be in the above situation a wide eyed 20 something American girl is *very* ignorant, because really they probably don't give a shit about you at all. Which is why you should get documentation if you actually need it, which it seemed you're already planning to do.

But I don't know! I'm sorry I can't give you any first hand experience in this subject. I'm not surprised that your home school and abroad program were nonchalant about the subject as they were with a friend of mine who needed to bring barbiturates into Japan; she was able but it took quite a bit of time to get approval. At the time I don't think the person in charge actually understood anything about the legalities of barbiturates in the US let alone Japan, until later... I'd put money on that they have no idea what schedule II means. Again as I already recommended, I would ask the consulate and if you can't do that efficiently hound ass at the abroad office until you get a satisfactory answer. The best part about abroad programs in my experience that if there's a fuck up getting there it's likely the program's fault (unless you accidentally your entire passport/passport application). They should handle everything for you.

As for the 90 supply I have more specific questions now. First off, cool, I want this. But I've looked at the law and it seems to me as it's written that the scripts still need to be written by the doc and filled sequentially eventually equaling a 90 day supply. To me it means this: assume doc A gave me a script for 30 pills once daily. I fill it, use it and there is already another one waiting. I fill it, use it and fill another one waiting. The waiting scripts are created on the estimated day that i will have finished the bottles. 3 fills x 30 pills = 90 supply even though i was never in possession of 90 pills at once. Is that kind of how that works for you?
Further, I'd be impressed if your doctor allowed you to possess 3 months worth of adderall as I personally have to live script to script to get more. If you don't have to do that, you're lucky, and what did you tell your doctor?
Also take this issue up with your doctor and school administrators that handle study abroad programs. You are not the first with this issue I'm sure.

Please don't just sneak in a controlled substance, it really is not worth the risk.
Well if you're not going to ask the Czech Consulate out of laziness then why not just risk all the felonies and international crimes and hide them in a shampoo bottle before you board the plane?

This is by far the stupidest question I've ever seen. 

Get permission from the Czech government if you want to avoid getting thrown in jail later if you're discovered. Seriously. This is the kind of behavior that makes life so hard for us. There are already enough rules, laws and hoops in place as it is for us to get our medications in a timely manner and pulling a stunt like this is more justification to why we need all those regulations. Newsflash, all of our medications are illegal in the US (My country. It's a felony to possess!) too but people can still get them with prescriptions. I highly doubt that the Czech government would withhold permission to travel with necessary medication.
I thought so too. But the coincidence is uncanny, as I haven't installed anything recently besides substrate. I'll give it a go though! 
CNS stimulants come with a laundry list of possible side effects that stretches from here to Timbuktu. There is a common list of side effects associated with each respective drug, but everyone's body chemistry is different so nobody will react the same way. I find it weird that you're asking us what the medication feels like given the unlikelihood of any two experiences to be identical *and* the fact that you've obviously taken the pill for yourself and know what it feels like ***for you***. 

I empathize with your fear about how the pill will effect you. However I believe fearing that it will "change" your brain is very irrational. There are no adverse changes to brain function or some kind of brain damage as a result from ADHD drugs being used as directed, daily or not, by someone who was clinically diagnosed with ADHD. Of course there are ***extremely rare*** cases of serious side effects, usually only present due to a predisposition to other conditions (e.g. heart problems), but you should remember that people have been taking CNS stimulant drugs a for a **very** long time and there have been many many many improvements in treatment and drug design since they have been introduced. Besides, your psychiatrist wouldn't have prescribed amphetamine if you personally were at risk by taking this pill. You should have no need to worry. 

Taking the drug very sporadically will likely make life worse for you. Your body will have a difficult time adapting to life on and off meds when it is taken sporadically. These drugs only work if your body has been given the proper time to adjust to life on the drug. This time varies from person to person, but can take weeks or even several months (took me about a month). During the adjustment period your body learns how to effectively metabolize the drug and will eventually learn how to mitigate bad side effects, as well as you consciously learning new ways to manage their condition. During the adjustment period is also when most people weigh the pros and cons of their med to decide whether they feel it works well for them or not; in the event it doesn't work they switch to some other medication.


Routine is very very important when a person is given a drug regimen, because if the routine as directed is not maintained the drug will not work. Ever. Many people don't realize this, and the examples of drugs not working when the routine is broken is people not taking their antibiotics, antivirals, or routine vaccinations, or birth control, or hormones when they are supposed to. To build off my example, if antibiotics aren't taken to completion a patient can relapse into infection and/or the infection gets worse **in addition to** their infection becoming resistant to the drug. Stupid people not taking their medication properly are why some antibiotics don't work to treat some common bacteria anymore because the break of routine gave the bacteria ***just enough time*** to develop active immunity. When this runs amok you get virulent strains of e coli that are resistant to fucking everything (remember the out break of super e coli in India last year?).
**As for amphetamine, it is so important that you maintain some kind (whatever you and your doctor decide is best) of routine because if you don't maintain a relatively constant period of ingestion, dosage strength and frequency of dosing you will likely never truly consider that you and any side effects are "getting better". If you are not consistent, eventually your body *will* adjust but it will take *much longer* than if you were to take it consistently. After a change in dosage strength or a change in frequency your body needs to be given time to adjust *every single time there is a change*.**

Me: Like I said before, it took me about a month of dosing everyday for my bad side effects to go away. I had a lot of trouble eating and feeling hungry, weird mood swings, sleep etc. 90% of bad side effects went away after a month and the ones that stuck around were ***significantly*** better after a month compared to when I restarted treatment. After my body adjusted its baseline I mixed in my off days because my body finally began functioning well on meds. **I DIDN'T SOLELY *KNOW* BASED ON INTUITION AND EXPERIENCE THAT I HAD ADJUSTED FULLY, EVERYTHING WAS  OVERSOUGHT WITH MY DOCTOR.** I now consistently take it 6 days a week with one day off on Saturday. I suppose that would be considered "taking it when I need it" as I typically don't do advanced mental effort and planning on Saturdays. Sometimes but not often I don't take it on Sunday as well. I have noticed that if I take more than 2 days off and I come back on some bad side effects come back and others worsen. After a few more days on my body bounces back to a stable state.

**All that said**, 

It seems to me that you don't like the idea of taking medication anyway. That's fine. Maybe you should consider and talk with your doctor about any sort of med-free ways of ADHD treatment and management such as very regular aerobic exercise.

I hope this goes well for you!

After updating my substrate I've had several random resprings and now one safemode crash within two hours of installing it :(

would re-installing it help?

if your college clinic doesn't even have psychs there is literally nothing meaningful that they can do. Unless you've confused psychiatry with psychology, I do find it hard to believe that your university doesn't have psychologists. I mean it could be it's just surprising. Assuming you're in the US, you will very likely NEED to be diagnosed by a clinical psychologist (and you take their eval. to an MD or a psychiatrist) or diagnosed by a psychiatrist before you can even dream of getting a script.

But you're still right; going to the campus clinic is free and there is nothing to loose from it. Glad you're prepared to also look elsewhere. When you do, specifically ask for an appt. for ADHD evals from a clinical psych or psychiatrist and make appointments everywhere! The lines are usually out the door for new patients so take what you can get. After you get them all make sure you cancel the ones you're not going to use.
Do exactly as your psych says and see your doctor. Before seeing your doctor, have the psych contact your doctor in some way. If that isn't possible get a refferal from your psych to a doctor they have a good relationship with and also go with a letter.




However; in my country (USA) doctors are required (as I've been led to believe) to have a current clinical diagnosis on file before they can give a script for CNS stimulants because of the high rate of abuse, and because pharmacies and doctors are "audited" by the feds since these drugs are US schedule II. I have been diagnosed from 8 y.o but I elected to stop treatment for about 5 years. Despite my medical records, I couldn't restart treatment without a current psych eval on record.





Advice: try anyway. Worst thing they can say is no. If they say no, call around and make appointments. Doesn't matter how far down the line they are, just make them with every clinic around because the lines are long. After you've exhausted your search keep the soonest appointment and cancel everything else because you don't need them. Yeah it's long, but there really is no other way.
I just got my calc 2 test back this morning. knowing the tests were coming back the anxiety that I would no longer have a high enough grade to be credited for my major was so high, that when I got my test back and my course grade was still a C I started sobbing. I'm actually tearing up as I write this... I don't know about the rest of you but for me math is certainly the most challenging subject around and I feel like I'm barely floating above the water. I got a D on the test, but man the relief is unbelievable. I'm so thankful and motivated right now because I need to keep myself within a credited grade. I thought I was done but I'm not! That's my win! 
I honestly haven't even seen it myself. I only saw it for less than a second before I covered my computer screen. I don't want to. You're braver than I. 
The most twisted and fucked up part about it is that they WANT it and crave it. It's absolutely disgusting and a terribly horrible thing. 
Last year I discovered the phenomenon called "Bug chasing".

A bug chaser is usually a gay man who wants to be infected with HIV by having unprotected sex with HIV+ "Gift-givers". These people will actively search for partners so they can gain a positive status. When they are positive, they will actively search for people they can spread it to. 

Just the thought of this practice makes me absolutely sick to my stomach and confounds me that people, knowledgeable about the scope and impact of HIV/AIDS as a deadly disease, would want to contract it and give it to others. There's erotica and information about this if you dare to look. This [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1xahc2/a_bug_chaser_having_his_rectum_scraped_with_a/) featured this wonderful image of someone scraping their rectum with a wire brush so they could increase the chance of receiving the gift.

I'm going to go throw up now.
Because you kept looking at me when you were muttering to that person next to you.
Music. Specifically the soft kind that you can't hear when you're running around trying to find the source but is audible when you are sitting still. Definitely unnerving.
Masturbate.
1) joke? 
2) be a faggot

You're right. I only mean to give you another tool to use in the future. I also wanted you to see that engaging can eg people on. 
Except it won't ever be. If you really didn't want me to ask you should have said something or never responded. Both would've worked. Not responding certainly would have worked because it's the Internet and people would have forgotten or left it. 

By engaging me and others you're enabling the behavior you don't want. I'm only saying all this to giving you unwarranted advice. Hopefully something like this doesn't happen to you again. 
yeah sorry, i would have stopped if you said something. I didn't know
Ok now I've seen that like a million others have been quizzing you about where you're from and you're now busy defending yourself. I didn't see that you wanted to keep your location private. Sorry bout that. I'm sure this has all been annoying. But my final answer is El Salvador. ;)

Well I just guessed every country in central america. So like you said you lived in central america, it would have to be one of those seven. So what's up? Unless I did guess it and you just don't want to say, which is fine with me. I too like my privacy.
Only one left! It's Panama!
Costa Rica
Nicaragua?
Belize 
El Salvador?
Honduras.
Needs, more, ,
I've been traveling. No worries, haven't forgotten!
5 icon dock (ios7). It's in the album. 
Yup I'll do it when I'm back at my computer. 
Pretty sure it came with alkaline. Says in settings I have selected LBI Circular c:num
I don't really understand what you want me to say. Could you be more specific? The icons I'm using are images I have downloaded and set. 
Cataracs
I put the tweak list in the album. 
As you all know, jailbreaking and creating new setups is an *addiction*. I have finally created a set up I love, and I've actually kept it for almost a month now! (that's **huge** for me.. Lol) So to celebrate, I have decided to share.

Comments questions criticisms and suggestions are welcome.

Also if anybody knows of a Flex patch or other method to remove dock and in-folder app icon labels but keep labels on folders in folders that'd be awesome to know.

Tweak list is in the album!
From another post:

"Icon themes get applied through Winterboard via the specific application's icon bundle ID. A very helpful tool for this is AppInfo by rpetrich. It goes something like this:

The Maps app has a bundle ID called com.apple.maps. The icon bundle ID is called icon@2x~iphone.png. So, in my theme folder called TestTheme.theme, I'll create a parent directory called Bundles, and inside that directory, I'll have a folder called com.apple.maps. Lastly, in the folder, I'll have my icon png file called icon@2x~iphone.png, which specifies retina iPhone devices." - /u/WinneonSword

If you didn't already know you need to have iFile or a similar program for your computer to modify and change the name of the bundle id in the theme folder and to change the names of the png files to exactly mirror the png file names the app uses. Sometimes appinfo doesn't tell you the correct name of the png files that apps use. You'll know that happened if you make changes according to what appinfo is telling you and nothing works. In that case, have appinfo open up the system files for the app in iFile and go into the (app name here).app folder. In here are all the image files it uses and you can get the right icon name from there. 
Thanks!

No way. Where?
Do you mean you stick your index finger in your urethra?
So is there a repo we can use? How do we download that?
deleting the preference plist with icleaner didn't solve my issue unfortunately.
No I don't.
Yes please share!
All that's there is a picture of a palm leaf.
Huh. I've never seen that from simppassbuttons. Well thanks then!
Download crash reporter as I see you don't have it. Next time they crash the app may be able to tell you what tweak is causing your issues. 
If not just uninstall and reinstall everything. 
I'm up voting this because this would be hilarious. Anyone know how?
How did you get the partial transparency for your pass code screen?
Fuck yeah! It's there. Thanks for your effort!
Ok I really hate to be needy but there's still only 3 files and they're the same as in the first link you graciously gave me... 
Haha thanks! I'm gonna use these as folder icons. Helps a lot!
Shoot! There's only 3 icons in that download; I'm suspecting that the square is missing like before... Any chance of a redo?
You're doing god's work. 
Sorry but would you please re-upload the icons? I'd really appreciate it. 
Well I guess I'll give that a go. Remember anything about where they were located, names for instance?
Are you sure? I have Gotham and I don't have them. I thought they were separate. 
Could you share the source for the play station custom icons please?
Well that explains a lot and why it came with mandolino
Also funny thing I just uninstalled that tweak, thinking I should reinstall it, and my issue has been fixed. Weird. I wonder why?
If you're talking about the tweak hosted by bigboss, I already have it.
I remember at one time the clock displayed correctly with black minute and hour hands from Gotham. However it randomly changed. I've seen this issue with other people's set ups too so I've dealt with it (I mean it really isn't a big deal), but I'd rather have it work. 


If you have experienced this and fixed it, how did you do it?
I was thinking that or the red background on the image. I'm sure in real life it's easy to use otherwise you wouldn't pick it. Oh well, I can't see it well but I'm glad it suits you!
Sorry but that is so hard to see what your icons look like. Is it just the image?
While I acknowledge the origin of the poem, have you really never told your friends that you love them? Love isn't cut and dry; therefore it doesn't have to be romantic at all. I love my friends, and I tell them that too.

Basically the only truth here.
I mean it doesn't have to be gay though, friends can be close like this.
Agreed, like a million times.
I bet that's a Compact Amur Maple shrub.
repo.fortysixandtwo.com
FuckThatBounce is your answer
no link to the original?
You're so so right. Sorry OP.
I did it all. What is in your link is only the image files; what I think must be missing which is plaguing me so is some instructive file or plist that tells winter board how to change it. I'll find it somehow
Thanks!
Is it supposed to be a winterboard enabled theme? Because I don't get that option when I put it in that location.
Also, my root var/stash/themes is called /Themes.ABUAN8
:(
Mind giving another tip too? I unzipped to this location and nothing changed even after a respring. Is there something I'm missing?
How did you get the password screen to be transparent? I need it!
Sorry to report but I've been having these issues for ages and I'm using the latest update of Phantom. Anything I can do? I'm on 7.1.1
I know this post it 4+ months old, but where in iFile are Iconoclasm theme's stored? Do you know/remember?
I'll look into UnlockSound7, thanks! And when I said fly in I was more referring to the stock animation iOS has for icons appearing.

I mean I know it's probably possible to add a sound.... but I also have no idea if a tweak exists...
Thanks
Name for the LS slider?
what repo is that on?
What are the lock screen widgets?
Now I'm sad. ಠ╭╮ಠ
Shit. Can I not Apex 2 my folders? That's really what I want to do. 
You're doing gods work. 
Gotcha. Sweet thanks
And that gets rid of all the banners/borders/whatever?
What's that music player app?
It's not circlet. It's circular connection indicator. 
It's all fucked up and I don't know why. I'm on 7.1.1 with an iPhone 4, using cydget and chronos. Don't know what's up. Ideas?
I apologize for being needy, but could you make or tell me how I can make this fit for an iPhone 4? I saw in the extractor that this was fitted for a 5/5s correct? I'm still gonna try and make it work as is...yolo
But this is really cool and thanks for the effort even if I can't use it!
During my spring break, I was staying with my friends at Iowa State freshman year. So after a night of drinking, I for some reason decided it was a great time to take a shower. I got in the shower about midnight on a Friday night and figured I'd only be in there for like 20 minutes. While I was in the shower, I sit down on the floor like I normally do and think. I was tired, and was drinking water while I was in there. When I thought about 20 minutes had gone by, I got out of the shower and headed into the dorm I was sleeping in that night.

When I entered the room, the sun was out and the clock said it was 7 am! I was in the shower for 7 whole hours and the water was still the same warm comfortable temperature when I woke up! Thankfully this was in the dorms and I didn't have to worry about their water bill! Best sleep ever.
Sorry this comment is 2 months old now, but do you remember how you downloaded the file? I am attempting with Safari and Chrome on my phone and neither browser is giving me the familiar "open with iFile" option. What did you do?
It's Kiki, and it's on bigboss.
No. He had the rinnegan when he read the final parts of the tablet. And he did mention that fact when he was explaining the origins of chakra and the story of kaguya.
Thanks rebooting worked! 
Haha well I installed the Cydia version first since I assumed it was a tweak. I've uninstalled it now and tried to get the App Store version but it keeps saying it cannot be downloaded at this time. Weird. 
Thanks! I'm cleaning house right now in cydia and am trying to find a solution to iPhone 4 being super slow. I installed the battery saver tonight.
how is the memory realocator different from SBsettings' free up memory button? If you don't know it's fine.  
I'm sorry I know this comment is about a month old now, but as for other switcher apps like sicarious and lastapp, in your experience did those tweaks ever slow you down?
I'll try that if I can consistently repeat the scenario that causes it in the first place. So far I can't do that though... :p 

I didn't know iCleaner could disable apps! Thanks.
Yes I said it works in safe mode. Well, so far it is.
You're so right, it hurts. :(
While there may not be hundreds of different brands and *flagship* phones, unlike Android nearly everything on iOS is guaranteed to work across nearly all device models. The user base of the Android OS is fractured among all of the different OS versions, most of them (91%) not using the current OS language because their hardware will not allow it.
On top of that, not all Android phones are created equal. All Android phones are unique brands to individual companies all running their own handpicked version of all of the Android builds, sometimes even being released with their own special Android version unique to specific devices. Therefore, each new phone is not held to a standard so companies can include any new native feature or function they want as well with releasing any level of processing power they want.

With iOS none of those variables exist for a user and the experience is basically the same. Simple, just like the author explained. Apps are designed for the current OS release, and OS is designed to cater nearly all "current" iDevices.
Around 90% of iPhone users have iOS 7 across iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5S and 5C. 90% of users can access 100% of the content. As for Android, users are split like this:

2.2	Froyo	8	(1.0%)
2.3.3 - 2.3.7	Gingerbread	10	(16.2%)
3.2	Honeycomb	13	(0.1%)
4.0.3 - 4.0.4	Ice Cream Sandwich	15	(13.4%)
4.1.x	Jelly Bean	16	(33.5%)
4.2.x	17 	(18.8%)
4.3	18	(8.5%)
4.4	KitKat	19	(8.5%)

Not all devices can run all versions of Android because (for example) not all HTC phones have the same strenghth, and not all apps are designed for all versions of the OS, regardless of its age. just because I have the newest phone by HTC doesn't mean I can run all the new apps I want because I am *still* limited by my hardware.
Thank you! By the way, did the Facebook icon for you change from the Kiki icon back to the stock icon?
After updating Facebook the Kiki icon doesn't override Facebook anymore. Know how I could possibly fix that? Just thought I'd ask.
I also have Kiki and I also want to use the icons you made, but I don't know how :/

Can you tell me how do I use them? :)
So like they lay the groundwork (e.g. give the idea and instructions right before they get demolished) then Team 7 cleans up. Cool.
And yeah, screw the gourd, it's too complicated. Using the jar is safest, although a little OP if you ask me. But what other options are left?
Dude, it is foreshadowing by definition. And I stick to what I said that Kishi is not subtle about foreshadowing events at all, and that he does it all the time.

And no, we weren't discussing opinions because it was an argument from the start of your comment. Perhaps you wanted it come off differently, but you have been confrontational from the start. I'm sure you're in general just frustrated by how this series has developed thus far which I respect. But I do not respect you barreling in here and trying to start stuff. Unnecessary. 
What ever dude believe what you want.  
I see where you're going. 
How would Ten Ten or Darui/why would Madara let anyone get close enough to a) lasso him and b) slice his word cloud?
My only hang up is the fact that contact needs to be made with the rope for anything to work, and it would be so easy for Madara to either do a shadow split or even gravity push people away from him. 
But let's be real we've seen more outlandish things being done in the past...
Exactly why I fucking said, he's a foreshadow king. Nearly everything that has happened until now had been easily predictable because he basically lays it out for all of us to see. Would you have been happier if I said foreshadow spammer? 
Not going to the party if you're offended is fair, I agree. And yeah, it was over 20 years ago. I respect your convictions. RIP
This party took place in the same exact town where [Jacob Wetterling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Wetterling) was abducted. The party really is in serious bad taste to the unfortunate history of the town and the Wetterling family.
The town this school is in though is where [Jacob Wetterling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Wetterling) was abducted.
The town this school is in though is where [Jacob Wetterling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Wetterling) was abducted. It's kind of a big deal.

op pls, story!
> Naruto uses his strongest technique with an assist from Sasuke: Talk no Jutsu

Lol But yeah, possible!
Tokens pls
Yeah those were madaras eyes 
No. Transplant. How could you forget that? That's been a pretty important thing of information for a while now.
So? That doesn't mean anything at all, since reincarnation means you have been born anew as someone else 
I see what you're saying. 
Remember that there was only a fruit when it was a tree. Remember that the fruit held the Shinju's energy. Remember when the fruit was taken so was a (seemingly) large chunk of it's power. It's not even complete. Doesn't have all it's power back, therefore I don't expect we will see a fruit because literally so many people are still around using chakra. A complete shinju means nobody with chakra.
No, there is no fruit because there is no tree because it is not complete. Chakra has not been returned to the Shinju. And right now all that was growing was a giant flower. No tree = no fruit.
Correct. Minato was alive when Naruto was born.
Yeah. I'd say Yahiko! But who knows.
Impossible. Minato was alive when naruto was born. You need to find someone who died before naruto was born. 
Because that isn't how reincarnation works in Buddhism. A person's energy or being doesn't split into two new sources. 
what is guruguru
Yup. But Minato died after Naruto was born. So by the timeline of events, Minato could not have been a reincarnation of Ashura because Naruto IS Ashura's reincarnation.
So one correct me if I'm wrong. 

It was warmer. Cold blooded creatures like reptiles and insects absorb their body heat from the environment. With a hotter environment, larger creatures could survive because their bodies could be reach temperatures that sustain larger bodies. 

Today you will always find big ass bugs in warmer climates because the temperature allows their biology to work at a larger scale. 

Oxygen levels does not necessarily lead to larger creatures because the actual oxygen intake for creatures relative to the atmospheric oxygen is very low. Example: your lungs take in more air than can be used in one breath. That's why you can hold your breath and still be alive. There's oxygen still in the blood and there's also (some oxygen still unused in you lungs)
What theme are you using?
What is the "fucking weather" widget called?
download ifile.
When you go to the download page on SAFARI, click download, and then a prompt will give you the option to open it in ifile. Then select unarchiver.
Ok I just rebooted with all start up programs unchecked. Start up was faster, however I'm having the same problems. 
Ok I'll give it a go and let you know what happens. Thank you!
First off thanks for everything. What exactly do you mean when you say remove what I can from startup?
I understand the point, not the method. 
No the comp is still messed up. I haven't had the computer become non responsive in safe mode again. In regular boot mode it's still crazy slow and becomes unresponsive doing basically anything. Sometimes it has fleeting moments of functionality but then goes right back to crashing. 
I'm sorry, I thought I had. I haven't had those problems re occur again. 
Sorry, but do you have any ideas?
Turns out my disk wasn't fragmented at all. Nothing is working. Weeeee
Actually, I'm going to try and de frag my HDD. Otherwise I don't know where to attack this thing. 

It's acting like I have very little RAM to work with. Flash plugin on chrome keeps crashing too along with slow network connectivity despite my wifi working for my phone and my roommates computers just fine. 
Before the system was unresponsive this morning I was able to adjust the brightness.

And I am rebooting into safe mode now. 
No sorry, when I was in safe mode I had avast installed. 
When I woke up this morning i saw both recuva and malware bytes were not finished so I took the laptop with me to ideally monitor the progress. Sometime between closing the lid and the 3 min walk to the campus bus stop it became unresponsive. I waited on the 10min bus ride and decided to give up and try again after class. That's when I rebooted normally and saw what I did to the mouse pad. But like I said earlier the brightness settings would not respond. 
I have booted into safe mode. I did so last night to run another malware bytes scan, and recuva to try and get back a file I deleted by mistake.
The computer was unresponsive after 5hr20min according to the scan. Mouse wouldn't move and I couldn't adjust the brightness. 
When I turned it off and back on into regular boot mode mouse still didn't work, which is when I realized I accidentally turned off the mousepad. (Facepalm) but since the brightness settings were unresponsive, I am pretty sure it froze again. 

… yay
Well uninstalling MSE worked for a little while. Then it started to be stupid again. Also, since I'm a university student my campus Internet requires some form of a/v in order to use the network so I installed avast.

This problem is very strange to me since it started so suddenly. I haven't been doing anything out of the ordinary with it either. 

One thing I did notice when I had the resource manager up was that when the computer had programs freeze, memory and CPU usage levels would increase incredibly to the max possible reading on the scale. 
How did you get Hiddensettings 7 to change the  highlight of the command center? I have an iPhone 4, and I changed the setting to make the color orange, but it is only changing the slider of the brightness orange and not the buttons. I'm not sure what's going on or if I'm missing something.

Sounds like hating. But whatever, life goes on I suppose!
Yes please when you find time post a tutorial or something! Thanks!
Wow there are lots of haters on here huh?
Is this only in Kyoto? I've spent the last 4 months in Tokyo with this not being a problem. 
This is so different than Tokyo. Why I dancing outlawed?
Why is dancing illegal?
Really? Why do you mean?
Thanks
Which one?
I bet he can still "see", just not with his eyes. He has an 'organ' in him that is probably in a long-term sage mode, so he now has an enhanced sensing ability. He should be able to move around just fine.
No, this is Madara implying that he will succeed with capturing the beasts again and blooming the flower for the Inf. Tsukiyomi.
Thanks! Sounds good!
Sorry if the answer is already said, on mobile and can't see. The text says "An unexpected visitor!" Or "surprise visitor". 

Source: Speaks Japanese
True, and they also had a chakra cloak which is likely maintaining the rasengan.
It would also be incredibly lazy and a huge fuck you.
I'm sorry but, could you fill me in please?
That's cold.
Lol you're right
That is actually what was being implied. Of course Sasuke didn't forget.
Along with SO6P's staff it's also Jubito's staff after he becomes the 10 tails jinchuriki. Not an exact match, but it was the closest of the ones the museum had on display.
How'd you like it?
You're in a spoiler tagged post and you're complaining about spoilers being revealed? Come on. Dick. 
Didn't want to be flamed. Better safe than sorry I guess. 
Yes this. But not only that, Obito gets one too after he becomes the jinchuriki of the 10 tails. But I'm sure you knew that though. 
Haha thanks buddy.
Excuse me while I *whoosh* myself.

Haha yeah I have I was thinking of the roots actually! I wasn't sure if /u/CaseyWaffles was referring to the chapters or the actual trees outside of the museum. The trees themselves outside of the museum were fenced off too!
May I ask why you say that?
I know it's not exactly like the one shown in the manga, but this was the most similar of the several on display. Really cool of the museum to allow visitors to take pictures!
I'm from Minneapolis. Ever hear of the movie Fargo? According to everyone else that's what all Minnesotans sound like. We don't.
I'm with you! This looks amazingly fun!

Oh that's interesting! Mind if I pm you?
Thanks bro.
> yolo

Thank you for using yolo as a verb.
Your page had it! The nods work and so far have no consequences that I don't want! Thank you!
Holy crap!
I don't know how I missed this page! I've searched google and your forums with dozens of keywords. I even tried nodding it myself following your guide but I messed it up. I think I see the mod I want. If these work I will love you forever!
I've tried there too :(
Ahh there we go. I was reading every chapter back except that one! Thanks.
Just reread the whole chapter. Nothing in the dialogue talks about the Juubi sensing the 1 tails inside Naruto. Help me out? 
When did this happen?
That's what I kept finding as well. It was called sporemods.com or something but it is a dead end website now. Maybe someone has the package files on their computer to share! 
Thanks!
NSFW! Tag that shit!
I, like the thousands who upvoted understood this immediately. Hilarious, good work OP. 
ITT ~~Idiots~~ People who are taking what OP wrote too literally. Good lord people...
Not only does college give you a place to learn and improve your resume, but there is also the social aspect of college. I'm not talking about the party aspect (although that is real and is fun) but I am talking about the opportunity to be able to interact with and work with people who have (hopefully) already seen a lot of success. In college you are surrounded by professionals whose job is to help you find what you want you want to do in life. And if you end up making a good personal connection with some of them they can point the way to other people so you can further your career. Aside from the professional, you will be doing all of this with people your age that will hopefully become friends for life. With college you can expand your resume, expand your pool of "people you know", and gain friends for life. It can be expensive for some, but the price is different for every family based on everyone's personal financial background.

I recommend you begin the application process and send some applications out to see if you will be accepted and receive the financial aid packages. You don't have to go to any of the schools you apply to  but you can at least get a sense for what would be in store for you. If you're wondering I am in college and was skeptical of going myself, but I realized I wanted to work in science which requires a degree or two. 
Olga Álava or Kim Yu-mi.
Me too. The pain....
If I were to be speaking to my freshman year of high school self I would say "Don't be afraid to branch out from your middle school friend group and for the love of god hit the gym!"
"What are you?" What they're asking is what ethnicity I am. I get asked this all the time because I am racially ambiguous. I really like getting asked this question though because I am prideful of my heritage and I get to talk about it!
/r/cringe
Oh god that was painful.
It was Madara. 
Maybe izanagi to take back Obito's Juubi takeover? hmmm
Kabuto has been out for a while. Unless you mean someone else?
Yes,also it appears that Hashi was a wood clone at the ending scene. But since they are revived by edo tensei they will just regenerate. Unless Juubito has some crazy method to turn it off somehow.
That's awesome!
I'd say obsessing over what they do day in and day out would be. I'd say you're a super fan.
That's an interesting idea! Maybe I'll give it a shot!
Thanks! And for you!
Stay strong!
That's what I thought it was, vanity. 
You're the best!
Exactly why I don't do that. It turns into a need for validation from the Internet. Just like karma!
I'm with you. I made one when it was new, didn't understand, deleted.
I'd swap my computer skills for gymnastics skills any day.
Instagram is flooded with this and I have no idea why it is so popular to do.
I don't get why people follow the daily lives of celebrities. Live your own life!
Tanning is one my favorite things to do in the summer. I don't burn at all since I have a dark skin tone. I really like the dark color my skin turns during the summer so I can stay tan in the winter.
Twitter. I really don't understand why people tweet, and what makes people want to tweet. I personally don't feel the need to update everyone on my life.
Read a book.
You have to at least rinse the sweat and dirt off you and use some sort of deodorant.
I felt very warm and I happy. I also found myself closing my eyes often and loosing myself in the wonders of my imagination. I was also really horny.
We didn't have a football to play football with. A nine year old said this:
"Man we from the hood we don't need no football! We use a shoe!"
Because he smells like sour milk and makes the whole room smell like it.
Because he snores.
Because he has a fan blowing on him all night, moving the stench all around the room because he doesn't shower every day.
Because he doesn't brush his teeth.
Because he is overweight and complains about how people won't go for him yet doesn't do anything for himself.
Because he picks his nose and eats it, in front of me.
I would jump out of several tall buildings. I love the rush I get from the feeling of falling similar to the top drop on a rollercoaster so I'd definitely do that. 
Not sure why he spells it that way, but yes. Raikage is not (as far as I know) named anything except Raikage and A; his "brother" is B. A and B. Get it?
What causes the YLOD?
Agreed. God of War? Hell yeah.
That's what I thought as well. It's nice to hear positive reports on the functionality of the system despite some cheap repairs. Most of the material is about it's many failures. I appreciate your response.

Thanks! Looking forward to it
Thanks to you too
Thanks for the info.
Ahh my second guess
Final Fantasy?
Yes our relationship is pretty good so I could definitely do that. 
That's also a good idea. I suppose I can't really say anything without starting an embarrassing conversation but this would be a good way to manage the breath.

Thanks. I've tried to buy your shirts many times before, and most sites I have been to say sold out. Thanks for the link!
Why are your shirts always sold out?
Thanks I'll read it later
Source?
Thank you
Thank you! Someone had to say it!

Not petty. Sinister.

Fun Fact! Hydrogen gas does not burn in the visible spectrum. It only burns in [ultraviolet light](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen#Combustion) so you breath invisible fire!
Our chemistry test will be on Wednesday. And it will cover everything we did last year and this semester.
Our *final* which is next week will be standardized and easier than the test we have Wednesday. We just had class today, and she dropped this bomb on us.
Haha you can't have tooth cancer. Teeth aren't made of living cells.
Next time link to the [non-mobile](http://www.npr.org/2012/12/09/166665795/forget-extinct-the-brontosaurus-never-even-existed) version please.

Teeth? I don't really know what you mean...
Cancer is deadly because the cells can multiply uncontrollably. There are two types of cancer. Malignant and benign. Malignant cancer tumors are deadly because the cells multiply and invade other parts of the body. For example, you could have skin cells growing inside your heart. Benign tumors are cancer that is not invasive. Does that make sense?

This woman needs a lesson in hygiene. Gross.  
Facebook meme's are like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.
The site says it's valid Oct 30 - Nov 10. Try again.
Same here!

Wahoo!!
Every damn time, and I remember it's WOW.
If reincarnation fascinates you, you should look up the Buddhist religion and their thoughts on reincarnation. You might like it!
That's really cool.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
I feel like this one is a bit too fast ya know?
Greatest city in MN
What?
The "touch me not" plant is the same plant shown in that video. All the ones in the video are young plants. The mimosa pudica has many nick names.
I'm going to say that's bullshit. Amazon charges .99/song for most songs  that iTunes charges 1.29/song for. I'm thinking that Apple is in it for profit.
So maybe opening up isn't a Good idea. But you shouldn't take that shit from him. If he's homophobic like you say, and (tastes) teases you like you say, you shouldn't be friends with him. That's not nice at all the way he treats you.

Unless this is a PoST meant to get back at him,i say don't deal with him anymore. 

Edit: tastes is supposed to be teases
I agree. You should strongly consider opening up to your friend. Maybe not about the kissing, but about your feelings. Who knows, if your friend is as accepting as you claim he is, nothing negative will happen. If he rejects you, you might get over him. Like ubercred says, don't drive yourself crazy with this. Don't live your life wondering "What if..." You'll never be happy with yourself that way.
Don't be. I was nervous too when I admitted myself to counseling, but it really isn't scary at all. The scariest thing may be admitting to yourself that you're struggling with an issue and that you need outside help in order to fix it. 

Now I understand that you're nervous, and that is okay. This may help you over come nervousness or anxiety whenever you come across it: Understand that emotions come in waves. Kinda like the ocean. They come in, and they go out. When the nervousness comes to you, embrace it. Feel yourself being nervous about, try to understand why you're feeling nervous, and let the emotion pass. Like a wave.

Does that make sense? PM me if it doesn't and we can talk more. :)
A lot of schools these days have free counseling programs. You should inquire about those. 
Consider going to counseling. Most schools have a free counseling services on campus these days. Whether it be public, private, high school, middle school, or college. And don't think of counseling as weakness. Is actually a sign of strength and bravery if you refer yourself to a counselor. My counselor had helped me a lot, with a lot of problems. They also can give you good advice and things to practice to make a happier you. :-) 
I'm not saying it was aliens, but it was aliens.
So glad someone was thinking of Ratchet&Clank!
Thanks I understand what you mean. Although the "drama" that follows karma is a little ridiculous in my opinion.
I understand the upvote-downvote, but why do people make a big deal about karma whoring if there is nothing to 'gain'?
Ah! I get it now, thank you so much!
Thanks!
Yeah I understood that, I'm just floored that someone would do that.
What?
Upvote for proficiency in Japanese!
True. :/
[VERY RELEVANT](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q-IurIHUC8&feature=player_embedded) Please watch.
Gave me chills.
My name is Ian too!
Oh alright that's fair.
The title is one HELL of an idea. Since the rays of light are coming from the sky, the redditor is implying the idea comes from HEAVEN. So it's actually one HEAVEN of an idea, because it's coming from HEAVEN not HELL. Do you see?
Yes! Thank you! Problem solved, you're the best. My mind can now rest.
Ah. I've never heard that one before!
I actually can't stop laughing! Upvote.
FYI, it's "FYI".
Bad memories of that story just resurfaced...
English major, what can you do.
Quite possibly the best spelling mistake I have ever seen.
MPLS StarTribune! MN owned.
Great story.
Wow. That's rough dude, sorry.

I believe enjo13 is an American, and speaking for the mass transit systems in the US. I have never been, but I am sure that the subway systems in our larger cities on the east coast are the best in all of the US. 
However, to my knowledge most US cities don't have mass transit systems at all. Population density is the main factor.

Holy shit. Why didn't we do this??
How much is fuel in the UK? From the US, here.
TIL all about truffles. Huh.
LOL
Indubitably. *Puts on top hat.*
I so hope so.
I don't mind snow. I love it. What I hate is when it snows, and everyone collectively forgets how to drive. It's so annoying.
Me neither. Good one!
Upvote, for the accuracy of the name Hipsterville for the Seward neighborhood.
Ha. Good one!
Ha, wow. Just wow.
Props.
Your tale gave me chills. Thank you :')
