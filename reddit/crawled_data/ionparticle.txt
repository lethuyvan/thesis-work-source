Maybe high humidity?
> I'm starting to think custom (a la backblaze) is the only way forward if i need to expand in the future.

Yeah, that's my plan. Nothing professional like a storage pod, but just 3D printing additional drive mounts for whatever case I end up with.
That's what I'm running now! Love the new drive mount system, there's a ton of slots for expansion. It's really too bad they're not selling additional drive trays separately, so you're just stuck with the 6 that it comes with. I'm planning on seeing if I can design and 3D print a strong enough substitute tray in the future.
I actually ran the smaller Thermaltake Suppressor F31 for 2 years with a 3D printed drive cage add-on, haha. Was nice and quiet but the front dust filter was poorly thought out. With the door closed, air bypasses the front filter and comes in from the unfiltered side vents instead.
> Not everybody needs six 3.5" drives in their case.

As somebody who needs that, I'm pretty sure the market isn't serving us anymore. Your "untapped niche" is going to be the new mainstream. New cases tend toward no 5.25" bays and only 2 or so 3.5" internal bays.
What do you know, it actually looks good lighted up instead of just being a barely discernible moving dark smudge.
Maybe check with your doctor to make sure you've had the required two doses of the vaccine?
To add on to this, the defects were accumulated over time in space. On Earth, the atmosphere protects us from a constant bombardment of cosmic rays. The ISS is much less protected, so occasionally, a high energy particle finds its way to a pixel on the camera sensor and kills it.
Sorry, that's up to each faculty/department, I don't have any insight there. My point is that by calling the evaluations useless and thus not doing them, you're helping to make them statistically invalid and *easier to dismiss*, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

Anecdotally, if you talk to your profs candidly about what they do with the evaluations, you'll quickly see that it's more difficult than it seems to know what to change. There's usually a few common impressions when it comes to them. E.g. The number scores are useless, the comments are far more helpful. If you change something due to feedback, next term, there's going to be a group of students who complain that the original way was better. You really can't please everyone, there's a group of students who think the course is too fast and another who thinks it's too slow. There's too many/too few assignments/quizzes/midterms. Even worse, common complaints sometimes have non-obvious root causes.

IMO, and keep in mind that I've got no teaching experience, so I'm speaking from my student experience here, a lot of problems would go away if we could dramatically shrink class sizes. Instructors would actually be able to adjust for different learning styles and progress rates if there's only like, say, 5-10 students.
I can't speak to faculty policy on reviews. But the vast majority of profs do try their best at teaching. You know how CoursEval ask you to evaluate your profs with a scale from 1-5? 70% are evaluated at a 4 or above. Only about 4% of professors were evaluated at a 3 or below. [P66](https://senate.ubc.ca/sites/senate.ubc.ca/files/downloads/20150121_Senate%20Materials.pdf) [P95](https://senate.ubc.ca/sites/senate.ubc.ca/files/downloads/20160120%20Vancouver%20Senate%20Materials_0.pdf) [P134](https://senate.ubc.ca/sites/senate.ubc.ca/files/downloads/20170118%20Senate%20Materials_0.pdf) That's not taking into account other factors such as response rates or student agreement.

To solve problems, we first need to know that the problem exists. This is difficult in an organization as large as UBC. Hard data and analysis helps a lot. The CoursEval team takes great care in providing clean data and detailed analysis, they wouldn't have to if it was all just a sham.
I see this sentiment a lot. But the truth is, it'd work a lot better if people actually did their course evaluations. There's a minimum response rate courses have to meet for statistical validity. Both "good" and "bad" courses have a lot of trouble meeting this.
Man, I had the same thought, just give them the day off.

But I'm told that parents would complain that you're short changing their kids' education by cutting school hours. Apparently, school hours isn't enough as it is, you have to send your kids to cram school just to keep up with all the other kids. And if you want your kids to get ahead, gotta sign them up to a second, late night, cram school.

I hope we'll see some societal pullback from the excessive "education" attitude. The ones that've gone through this misery seem reluctant to put their own kids through it, at least.
All the complaints were cause the previous version, WebCT CE 6 was actually better than Vista. The company who made Connect, Blackboard, bought WebCT out and proceeded to completely destroy it. Judging by how "well written" Connect was, it might not even be malicious, just utter incompetence.
We're going to have to disagree here, I guess I'm cutting the translator more slack. To me, it felt more like an attempt to add cultural context for an English audience.
Your objections are exactly what the author wants to draw out. This is a classroom conversation, the author is skillfully employing the Socratic method to get students (and you) to think critically. The translation wasn't that bad.
Haha, I saw, just didn't want to downgrade.
I was just struggling with this. Prime doesn't seem to work with current amdgpu drivers. There seems to be a regression where the latest kernel 4.15 will seg fault if you try to unbind it. Example:  https://www.reddit.com/r/VFIO/comments/7xc0d0/unable_to_unbind_rx580_from_amdgpu_driver/

Hopefully someone has a fix or workaround.
I designed a 3 bay drive cage for my previous PC. Printed it in petg and used it for 2 years.

For vibration, petg's "springiness" seems to help absorb a lot of it. I also had printed drive trays, that plus the printed cage resulted in no noticable noise increase due to vibrations.

For heat, I designed it to have large cutouts and spacing to allow air flow above and below each drive. The drive temperatures were as good as the built in drive cage.

You're probably going to be a bit cramped for space and cooling if you want to fit 5 drives in your 5.25" bays with hotswappable back planes. I'd suggest maybe a large fan in front of the drives to make sure they don't suffer from heat issues. This does make the hot swapping less convenient though, maybe put the fan on a hinged door or something.
Wtf, previous versions of 416 weren't anywhere near that hard, lol. They must think you guys don't need sleep or something.
Same place, just need to switch to the mk3 branch: https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/tree/MK3?files=1
It's all open source. But it's a heavily modified version of Marlin that you'd have to adapt for your printer. The axis calibration also requires their special heated bed with 9 calibration points built in. 
The root cause isn't ice damage, but they are putting in a stronger liner. They somehow didn't expect that people would actually get in the fountain and play. The original liner they put in wasn't durable enough for the extra wear and tear this caused.
> Ultimately the debate is a little vain though, as it doesn’t take away the need to act on climate change, bears or not.

Aye. Polar bears could very possibly be getting alone fine right now, but in the long run, they will eventually find it difficult to live as the environment they've been adapted to disappears.
Your source is misleading and misinterpreting her source. [Polite explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/7igo0f/heartwrenching_video_shows_starving_polar_bear_on/dr3di44/):

There's actually quite a long section that talks about how the old populations data from the 1990s aren't very comparable to the new 2010s data. e.g.: In the 90s, they only sampled the coast line, they didn't have the resources to go inland or count the ones on floating ice. And they noted that pregnant bears tended to move inland, so there was an undersampling of adult females. Temporary bear migration was also a larger issue in the 90s, as they had much more ice to move on.

But as the ice cover continues to melt, they'll eventually find it very difficult to survive. According to the study, the Baffin Bay/Kane Basin polar bear population seems to have already started moving northward in response to the retreating ice sheets.

[Unpolite explanation.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7v6qc5/polar_bears_really_are_starving_because_of_global/dtqght9/)
ARRRG, seriously, every time polar bears come up, this claim appears too. I'm sick of saying this politely, these fucking bears live in the god fucking middle of nowhere, so it's fucking difficult to count them. We're counting more bears now because WE'RE SPENDING A SHITLOAD MORE MONEY ON COUNTING THEM. People don't want to go deep into the fucking Arctic to count these goddamn bears if you don't pay them for some reason. This was somehow twisted into "polar bear population exploding, scientists lie!".
It's mostly due to cost. They have to cover large areas that are both uninhabited and inhospitable. There's also better techniques used in more recent studies. Sorry, no nice articles that I'm aware of that dives into the scientific details. But there's a good summary for one of the polar bear population surveys, it's still dense, but not too bad of a read: [here (pdf warning)](https://www.gov.nu.ca/sites/default/files/baffin_bay_kane_basin_polar_bear_cgjcpb_report_summary_eng.pdf). if you scroll down to Chapter 3, they talk a lot about the differences between the 90s and 2010s data. Some relevant quotes:


> A comprehensive reassessment of the 1990s BB data was conducted because, compared to the 2010s data, the 1990s data had smaller sample sizes, reduced geographic coverage, and different environmental conditions, which in combination introduced uncertainties and potential limitations into analyses of the data.

> The 1990s MR sample size was small (average 229 total captures per sampling year), relative to the 2010s (average 470 total biopsies per sampling year), and the number of recaptures in the 1990s was low.

> The spatial distribution of polar bear physical captures and biopsy samples for the MR studies in the 1990s and 2010s was significantly different.  In the 2010s, a larger fraction of bears were sampled inland from the coastline and inside fjords along Baffin Island ... the differences in capture distribution were a function of different sampling effort , with less effort expended away from coastlines and inside fjords in the 1990s . 

> The spatially-defined sampling area in Nunavut in the 1990s was less than ½ of the sampling area in the 2010s. The 2010s sampling area encompassed most fjords along the coast and more inland habitat.

> In the 1990s, approximately <30% of radio -collared female bears were inside the sampling area during the MR fall sampling periods. This suggests that a potentially large proportion of bears were not available for capture in some years during the 1990s.  In contrast in the 2010s , between 70-80% of radio-collared adult females were in the sampling area.

> Adult females in reproductive classes that were likely pregnant in fall moved farther inland on Baffin Island ( i.e., to find suitable denning habitat), compared to non-pregnant females, which likely contributed to the under-sampling of adult females in some years in the 1990s because of the lack of inland sampling.
No, your sources asserted a population growth for polar bears. I'm saying that assertion is not supported due to A.
Factcheck.org does not support your assertion. They say the numbers are unclear. And they're right to be cautious about it.

*Recorded* polar bear population is higher. If you look at the actual study, they'll note that the new numbers should not be directly compared against past records for multiple reasons. One of which is simply that newer efforts to count polar bears are much more complete. E.g.: in the 90s, they might have only been able to survey part of the coast, but newer studies are able to check inland as well.

Stripping crucial context from actual science for misinformation is all too easy, we should all be on guard for it.
In that case, yeah, not much chance of that. I doubt delaying a few weeks would help, seems like their testing process takes a few months.
Not sure what you mean about breaking the tradition. Since 16.04 they've moved to a rolling update model for kernels if you're on the HWE stack (e.g. all desktop users, opt-in for servers). 16.04 released with kernel 4.4 and we're on 4.10 now, 4.13 next month. It's still a bit slow, but the process is in place and they'll improve it over time.
Rather the opposite here. Really, I started data hoarding cause I was never able to keep much of anything physically.
I wish they were keeping it alive, they've dropped removable batteries this generation, with the V30 and the G6.
The key here is "without El Nino". The Pacific Ocean cycles between warmer periods (called El Nino) and cooler periods (called La Nina). 2016, assisted by El Nino, broke temperature records. 2017 is the start of La Nina, which means we should be seeing lower temperatures. And we are. But it's not as low as it should be. Which means the warming trend has continued.
>  Anyway the second quote is reasonably well sources, although a direct source from AMD or some evidence would be great.

I'm not sure you understood the source. That *is* from AMD. You are looking at a patch to the Linux kernel submitted by an AMD developer. Said patch excludes AMD processors from the performance killing security changes coming up. The patch has already been merged into mainline and will be released with Linux 4.15: [news article](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-Tip-Git-Disable-x86-PTI)
I don't know if they can do that. In any case, some on the publishers' side argued that it was a matter more fitting for Congress to decide, and that was one reason they didn't get to settle it in the lawsuit. Congress, of course, ended up doing nothing, so the database remains in limbo.
This is addressed in the article, they can't do that because this was originally a class action lawsuit where only Google was named as defendant. The settlement was stretching beyond the scope of a class action lawsuit:

> In some ways, the parties to the settlement didn’t have a good way out: no matter how “non-exclusive” they tried to make the deal, it was in effect a deal that only Google could get—because Google was the only defendant in the case. For a settlement in a class action titled Authors Guild v. Google to include not just Google but, say, every company that wanted to become a digital bookseller, would be to stretch the class action mechanism past its breaking point.
>
> This was a point that the DOJ kept coming back to. The settlement was already a stretch, they argued: the original case had been about whether Google could show snippets of books it had scanned, and here you had a settlement agreement that went way beyond that question to create an elaborate online marketplace, one that depended on the indefinite release of copyrights by authors and publishers who might be difficult to find, particularly for books long out of print. “It is an attempt,” they wrote, “to use the class-action mechanism to implement forward-looking business arrangements that go far beyond the dispute before the Court in this litigation.”
But now that they know Apple is doing it, they'll want to start doing the same thing. Gotta follow that "courageous" lead, right?
IMO, you're demanding an unnecessary amount of precision for what we're using it for, but if that's what you want, then yes, the solution isn't perfect.
> I assume by z isolator you mean the spring couplers and whatnot

No, a z-isolator transfers only the up and down motion to the gantry, removing the side to side wobbling. Good explanation of what a z-isolator is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsrV0gubg-U
It should be noted most kits aren't going to be that precise. An easier solution is to use a z-isolator to fix the z-wobble.
Leadscrews vs threaded rods. Learn the difference between them.

The current best setup for i3s is bottom mounted motors with leadscrews.

> I am aware that a similar question has been asked before but the comments weren't very conclusive

There's interesting historical reasons and tradeoffs for the debate. But the short of it is, threaded rods are cheaper and work better top mounted. But the top mounted motor introduces vibrations that'll affect prints unless you have a strong frame. Just spend the money for bottom mounted leadscrews, it'll give you less trouble all around.
You probably needed [one of these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSL_filter) on your phones.
No reason not to have both wind and hydro in your scenario. The type of infrastructure that's needed to send power to California or Alberta would also allow excess power from Site C to be sent there. It'd still be replacing far more polluting fossil fuel power plants.

Polar Bear Science is written by Susan Crockford, a climate change denier who has neither conducted any original research nor published any articles in the peer-reviewed literature on polar bears. [1](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/climate-denier-blogs-ignore-science-1.4424956) [2](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/bix133/4644513)
From your article:
> Prof. Derocher also said some details in the survey pointed to a bear population in trouble. For example, the survey identified 50 cubs, which are usually less than 10 months old, and 22 yearlings, roughly 22 months old. That's nearly one-third the number required for a healthy population, he said. "This is a clear indication that this population is not sustaining itself in any way, shape, or form."

So signs point to the next generation being in trouble, even if the current generation might look healthy.

Also from the article:
> But many Inuit communities said the researchers were wrong. They said the bear population was increasing and they cited reports from hunters who kept seeing more bears.

From the NatGeo video, it mentioned that starving bears are increasingly wandering near human settlements in search for food. So while you might be *seeing* more of them, it doesn't mean there are more of them.

It should be noted that saying polar bears aren't in trouble is a [favourite tactic of climate change deniers](https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/bix133/4644513). Even though some bear populations are still doing well right now, it's well documented that polar bears depend on sea ice for hunting. And the ice is melting. Eventually, they'll all be affected.
> A more feasible plan for gogoro would be expanding in Asia first then expand to Europe.

That's pretty much what they're working on currently. They have an [expansion to Japan](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/27/16334500/gogoro-scooter-japan-expansion-ceo-interview) in the works and a rental service in Berlin and Paris so far.

I was thinking they could have a try at cracking the North American market in the future. And they'd need a partnership to do that, like they did in Europe (with Bosch) and Japan (with Sumitomo).
Yeah, I was only thinking of urban areas in California, since Gogoro already limits itself to those areas anyway. I think there might be a hidden market for urban scooters based on the increase in bike ridership. You're right though, there's a heavily ingrained car culture, and I don't think it'd work anywhere else in North America. But if a foothold market can be established, maybe general attitudes toward scooters might change.
> I’m not sure how the company will expand outside of Taiwan

Team up with Tesla, sell their bikes in Tesla stores, maybe just in California at first. And use the same charging standard as Tesla cars.

Really though, they should do this anyways even if it's just in Taiwan, since the Tesla is expanding here too.

It was a big issue in the earlier days. Older printers like the [Prusa i2](http://3dprintingdatabase.org/sites/default/files/products/admin/prusa_mendel_2_NWreprarp.jpg) which used cheap threaded rods instead of lead screws on their z axis can reduce their z artifacts by hanging their z from the top (why? [read this](https://www.protoparadigm.com/news-updates/accuracy-vs-precision-and-threaded-rod-vs-leadscrews-in-3d-printers/)). But these older printers also suffered from less rigid frames and they found that the top mounted motors introduced vibration issues.

Newer designs have incorporated those lessons. E.g., the Prusa i3 switched to lead screws, switched to bottom mounting and also stiffened the frame.
This is especially ironic.

You are not alone. Though I personally place the cutoff more around the 2000s. Especially in regard to #2, the overabundance of galactic crises was a huge turn off. They were either running dry on creativity or just getting lazy. Similar thing happened to the Star Wars EU, imo.

Also, I wish more authors attempt #4, I'm always disappointed when a Trek story turns more toward fantasy than science fiction.

Well, let's just say that part of EPIC's purpose is studying climate change. Note that DSCOVR's other mission of solar weather monitoring remains funded.


Could be issues associated with the particularly heavy solar activity we've been having this week. But you could be right about the funding part too, turns out EPIC funding was cancelled in the proposed 2018 budget.

They haven't even started making this type of late model Sherman in August 1944.  
May I emphasis part of the plaque in question:

> in Sherman tanks **similar** to this one

I'm sure the original "Boss" Sherman participated in that battle, but that would've been an earlier model Sherman which was left behind in Europe.
Thanks, looks like this particular Sherman never saw action in WWII. It was built early-mid 1945 and the war ended before it ever got to the front. The Canadian army decided to leave all their armor back in Europe, as it was too expensive to ship back. So when they came back, they just bought some newly built (but now surplus) ones from the Americans for cheap. "Boss" was part of this batch and was only ever used for training. [Source](http://www.tanks-encyclopedia.com/coldwar/canada/m4a276w-hvss-sherman-easy-8/).

Nah, there were others, I can think of one other [example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtYHGqFS18E&t=2m20s) that's almost a mirror of this one. And there's also one where it's [explicitly stated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8O_C7T5H_s&t=12s).
I'd suggest trying lower temps than 220. PETG likes to be a stringing oozy mess when the temps are too high. It looks like material might have leaked away during travel moves for your prints, so the nozzle ended up being empty when it came to your smaller areas. PETG doesn't like too low temps either, as it'll start warping. Takes a bit of experimentation to find the balance.
Burying spent highly radioactive fuel is actually extremely wasteful. The high radioactivity tells you there's still a ton of energy left to be extracted. There are at least 2 alternative solutions to nuclear waste with already existing technology.

There are reactors that can burn even raw uranium (see CANDU), they can take spent fuel from other reactors and burn it more completely, removing the long lived radioactivity that's the most problematic part of radioactive waste. This fell to the wayside as it became uneconomical due to decreased fuel costs driven by advancements in refining and discoveries of large uranium deposits.

There are also reactors that are designed from the start with high fuel economy (breeder reactors), that can burn burn their fuel more completely, vastly reducing the amount and radioactivity of their waste. Unfortunately, this reactor type started off as a way of creating weapons grade plutonium, so its use is... frowned upon. But this shouldn't be an issue for the US given that they've got quite enough nukes already.

Really, if the US wanted to, it can switch to 100% nuclear starting right now, without worrying about increased nuclear waste.
Most of the time, you can just dd the image to your USB drive. Distros moved to 'hybrid' ISOs years ago, which just means they've put in an MBR so that it'll boot from USB drives too. More info: http://www.tuxgarage.com/2011/06/ubuntu-switched-to-hybrid-disc-images.html?m=1#whatis
We love TOS despite the dated look. We can look past aesthetic **if** the story is good enough.

It isn't the 'modern look' itself that bothers us, it's what the dark look itself implies: A serious lack of thought and understanding about Roddenberry's original vision of a *bright and gleaming* future. As such, there's not much chance that they can reproduce the quality of the best prime trek stories.
Agreed. SG1 and SGA both had a wonderful ability to blend serious and humorous moments. In stark contrast, SGU completely abandons this ability to not take itself too seriously. If you enjoy the recent trend in 'dark and gritty' series, you'll very likely be able to enjoy SGU. 
I think they've mentioned that the gate has its own computer system, that's what the SGC's homegrown DHD talks to. The gate's computer contains the safeties. Manual dialing bypasses the gate's computer and hence the safeties.
The explosive laden LES actually become a high risk factor if safety requirements were relaxed in order to meet launch schedule. When you ignore engineering reality, *nothing* is safe.
[Male and female and anatomical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque). Don't know about the last part, up to you?
I'd say the most useful contribution the Shuttle made was as a construction platform. That's something no other vehicle has yet done. Being able to put together complex structures in space should be useful eventually... hopefully.

> But even once it was done, the cost estimates for each flight were hilariously underestimated, and it pretty much never accomplished any of its re-usability goals.

Viewing the Shuttle as "done" was actually one of the management failures cited in the accident reports. They really should've treated it as a prototype still undergoing development, with all the associated costs and risks that implied.
Yes, but this is in hindsight, we wouldn't know this if we hadn't tried it first. I would argue that saying it was either the Shuttle or some other rocket system isn't the right way to look at it. Congress, back in the 70s, should've funded the exploration of a number of designs (with the Shuttle being just one of the concepts) instead of just one. There would've been competition and we'd get a far better idea of what works and what doesn't. Apollo was successful because they had the resources to throw everything at the wall and see what sticks. Cheap space travel required the same investment, but didn't get it.
No, the vehicle design doesn't matter in this case. Swap the Shuttle with a different vehicle, and we'd still have the same kind of accidents, just with different failure modes. The root cause was human: management didn't pay attention to what the engineers tell them. Doesn't matter if it's the Soyuz or the Shuttle, that kind of attitude will get people killed eventually.
Yes, additional methods to space should've been developed. But to criticize the Shuttle for being expensive is a bit unfair. It was the first attempt at a space plane and the first attempt at reuseability, everything about it was automatically going to be suboptimal when viewed in hindsight. 
Honestly, 2 failures in 135 launches fits with what the Shuttle engineers themselves estimated would be the failure rate. The two failures that did occur were mostly attributed to management failures, so engineering wise, it's far from the disaster people think it is.
Oh, I would accept that as an in universe explanation, no problem. I'm more referring to the logical consequences of them simply superimposing the *Enterprise-D* on top of the refit *Enterprise*, if we go by the CG alone:

* The *Enterprise* flies through the spacedock door with a certain amount of clearance. The *Enterprise* also rests inside the noticeably spacious interior.
* The *Enterprise-D* also flies inside the spacedock with what appears to be all the same clearance and spaciousness available to the *Enterprise*.
* But the *Enterprise-D* is a much larger ship than the *Enterprise*.

Therefore, it necessarily follows, that the spacedock must have been upsized.
Not just the door. Given that the Enterprise-D is significantly larger than the original Enterprise, they'd have to enlarge the interior too. Which, honestly, isn't that implausible given the resources and engineering expertise available to the Federation.
You're not wrong, they literally took the same shot from STIII and superimposed the 1701D over the 1701(no bloody A, B, C, or D).

Caption isn't quite right. They found a Borg temporal transmitter, which they used to send a message back in time to a Borg interplexing beacon. Can't believe I still remember that, it's been years since I saw that episode.
Two parts:

1. Curiosity was already the heaviest thing ever to be landed on Mars. They tried saving mass where-ever they could to make a soft landing possible. There were 6 large wheels, even small changes can add a lot of mass.

2. They designed Curiosity to handle everything that Spirit and Opportunity had experienced: sand traps, flat bedrock, rocks on top of sand. Then Curiosity landed and they found out that Gale Crater had a ton of jagged sharp rocks sticking out of the ground, which none of the previous missions have seen before.
Oh no, I'm not saying that innovation doesn't happen. I'm saying that if you're going to depend on private funding for innovation, you're going to wait for a long time. Innovation does happen, *when governments fund them*. Look at your list, all of them got their start from government funding. Blue Origin and Bigelow are notable exceptions, since the vast majority of their funding is private. But even they started off by basing their research on previous DOD/NASA projects. Innovations in space are just too risky and too expensive still to reliably depend on private funding.
> The thing is that there are much more profitable projects for private companies to work on.

Or, you know, *not* work on. Let progress stagnate while reaping the profits with minimal investments. People seem to forgot that SpaceX, and Elon Musk himself, is an outlier and not the norm for industry.
[Network Manager](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkManager) is what the system's GUI uses for connecting to networks. You can use it on the command line as well, just look up how to use nmcli.

If you were looking for a challenge and wanted to do it all with lower level tools, then stop/disable the Network Manager service before using iwconfig, etc.
> Given these points, UBC, and the other post secondary institutions of British Columbia have been raising tuition enough to make up for inflation, but it really comes down to how much growth these institutions choose to undertake that will decide who will subsidize who.

To be more accurate, they have been able to keep up with inflation *for tuition only*. To give an example, tuition is responsible for about 30% of UBC's operating budget. There's an additional ~70% of the operating budget that isn't keeping up with inflation.

We haven't even mentioned the straight small budget cuts. Such as the more recent ones in [2014](http://www.vancouversun.com/news/money%2Beducation%2Bbudget/9521826/story.html) or [2012](http://old.ubyssey.ca/news/bc-government-cuts-70-million786/). 2008 was particularly bad, not only was there a [straight cut](http://www.macleans.ca/education/uniandcollege/campbell-govs-cuts-to-unis-colleges-much-more-than-reported/), [some colleges were converted to universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education_in_British_Columbia#Creation_of_teaching_universities_.282008_-_present.29), which meant more universities had to share the same amount of funding.
> Domestic students/residents/taxpayers have been contributing to the system for a good portion of their lives. 

This is true, the problem is that the government they elected has decided not to invest those contributions to the educational system.

> to say they subsidize domestic students, is a bit of a stretch, and, frankly, is a little bit ignorant within itself

University funding has not kept up with inflation for more than a decade and a half now. This results in a de facto *defunding* every year. The move towards international students is a move of desperation, as tuition increases for international students aren't capped. The increased international tuition income helps make up for the shortfall in provincial funding, thus, international students are helping to subsidize domestic students.
Wind tunnel? Is that what they're calling the [tornado](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/tornado-recovery-underway-at-nasa-s-michoud-assembly-facility)?
It's a game of tradeoffs, you'll have to find the right balance for your setup. E.g.: At a lower temperature, you won't be able to extrude as quickly, so might need to lower the printing speed. Temperature also depends on your hotend. E.g.: A hotend with a brass heater block and nozzle can print at lower temperatures than a hotend with an aluminum heater block due to better heat conduction. Not all PLA filament are the same either, as different manufacturers can have different additives.
Besides playing around with your retraction distance and speed, you can also print at a lower temperature. This makes the molten filament more viscous and less eager to leave the nozzle.
What's your bed temperature? PETG likes high bed temps, a bit lower than ABS, but still pretty high. ∼90 C works for me, but I've seen recommendations from 80 C to 100 C. If that doesn't work, just add a layer of gluestick on top.
Haha, the FTDI is probably a clone too. It might be behaving in way that the driver doesn't expect. I wonder if it'll work with a PC running a newer kernel.

For reference, an official Arduino Mega identifies itself as such in dmesg:

    [  683.012074] usb 3-1: new full-speed USB device number 2 using uhci_hcd
    [  683.211046] usb 3-1: New USB device found, idVendor=2341, idProduct=0010
    [  683.211061] usb 3-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=220
    [  683.211072] usb 3-1: Product: Arduino Mega 2560
    [  683.211081] usb 3-1: Manufacturer: Arduino (www.arduino.cc)

If you cut D1 out, then yes, the Arduino will only be powered by your power adapter. The Arduino takes so little power compared to other components though, I find it difficult to believe that it could be the problem.

Next time it happens, note down the entire serialexception message and then run "sudo dmesg" on the Pi. The last few lines should be USB related errors that might help you narrow down a cause.
I doubt it would make a difference. The Arduino usually gets its power from your printer's power supply, if there's a problem there, you should see it in the short prints too. What do you have connected to your Raspberry Pi? It might be the Pi's power supply that's not keeping up.
Haha, wow, 4 months is slow even for China. I still have to caution you that the bed may be too heavy, causing the initially straight leadscrew to slowly bend over time. Might be worth taking a look at supporting the bed on both sides or upgrading to thicker linear rods.
There are other possibilities, but I don't have personal experience with them. Here's an excellent documentation of z-artifacts and their causes that you can consult: https://www.evernote.com/shard/s211/sh/701c36c4-ddd5-4669-a482-953d8924c71d/1ef992988295487c98c268dcdd2d687e
Uh-oh, that really does look like a bent rod. Better take it out and check it. Is your printer [this one](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1752766)? IMO, the z-axis bed is too heavy for the 8mm screw and rods. Wouldn't be surprised if they've started buckling (note: if the screw and rods aren't bent, then the bearings might have worn out from supporting that much mass and aren't tight anymore). I have 12mm on my own printer and would have issues if I put that much mass on it.
Is it a consistent pattern like [this](https://www.simplify3d.com/support/print-quality-troubleshooting/#lines-on-the-side-of-print)? If so, then yeah, that sounds like a bent threaded rod. Might want to check that it hasn't bowed in the middle.

The main difference between a bent rod and inertia artifacts is that a bent rod will present horizontal lines on your print while inertia gives you vertical lines. You can see an example of both artifacts combined together in [this print](http://imgur.com/MwhD6XN).
If your bed is just a little too heavy for the threaded rod, it'll slowly deform over time. So yes, it's possible.

But since you're sure the threaded rod is straight, you might be seeing inertia artifacts instead of z wobbling. It sounds like you've modified your x and y, so maybe the belts have loosened a bit and just needs some tightening up. It could also be that the added mass from the modifications introduced these artifacts.
There's also the cost to hire and keep people that can properly process and maintain the data. The file sizes are probably much larger than you're thinking. You saw the video OP posted. All of those ships except the Galor were rendered from the original models built for DS9. The models were [deliberately overbuilt with detail](http://trekcore.com/blog/2013/05/deep-space-nine-in-high-definition-one-step-closer/) that we never even saw in the original SD resolution.

Add to that a recurring cost for data transfer, it'd probably all have to be physically delivered.

Equipment cost is interesting though. I was thinking of tape backups, as that's the usual system back in those days, which isn't cheap. You're right, it would've been cheaper in the late 90s to use CDs and hard drives. But this probably isn't true in the earlier days. In 1992 when they did the CGI for DS9's intro, a CD burner costs $10,000, 3.5" hard drives were only 2 years old and $2000 was the norm for them.
> Secondary question is how could the studio simply "lose" the original files? The same studio that has random props and such from the TOS era still kicking around just somehow lost the project files for DS9's CGI clips?

Storing data costs money. They switched over to CGI because it was cheaper. Paramount could've asked for a copy of the files from the VFX houses for archiving, but they didn't want to pay the cost associated with storing them.

We're quite lucky that there are VFX artists keeping the files around unofficially.
You might be underestimating the chances. Remember that Kepler also found a lot more close in hot Jupiters than we expected. Some are so close that they're practically skimming the surface of their stars and already suffering massive tidal effects. It seems reasonable that we'd also finally find the aftermath of one that's been ripped apart.
Sorry, didn't mean to imply that 20 minutes is required to pass. Was more thinking that it's one of the easier ways to get points so might as well aim for full points. A decent grade can make your life a bit more convenient. E.g.: I'm with the Ministry of Education, and when it came time to pick school postings, the order in which you pick is dependent on your grade. Also as a side comment, if you get into Education, you'll have to run the 3 km again, but this time, you'll need to do <12 minutes to get full marks.
In practice, everyone just takes the running test, so you don't even have to worry about sit ups, push ups, pull ups. If you can do 3 km in 20 minutes while wearing uncomfortable shoes, you'll be fine. Uncomfortable shoes cause the shoes they're going to issue you is crap.
E3D heat breaks are stainless steel, not aluminium. What /u/F0xdude means by the heatbreak being too thick refers to the "neck" part that separates the heater block zone from the heatsink zone. This part performs the actual "heat break" function in the name and it has extremely thin walls. The cloners can't CNC to that tolerance, so they usually have thicker walls, which means more heat travels up to the heatsink. If your clone heat break has thicker walls *and* is made out of aluminium, then no wonder it's dumping too much heat into the heatsink.
Reproduction in space isn't a neglected area of research by any means.

It should be noted that there were several non-mammalian species that were successfully fertilized and born in space (e.g.: frogs and fishes). AFAIK, fruit flies have actually been successfully bred for several generations, so I'm a bit skeptical of the claim that fruit flies are born deformed in space. 

One quite interesting experiment found that chicken eggs fertilized 8 days before flight all hatched normally while most of those fertilized 2 days before flight [didn't develop normally](http://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/31/us/egg-experiment-in-space-prompts-questions.html).

For mammals, they started with rats instead of mouse. Surprisingly, it was a collaborative effort between the US and the Soviets. [Kosmos 1129](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1129) tried to see if rats would get pregnant in space, they didn't. It's possible that the stress endured during launch made them not want to mate. But some research also show that [weightlessness has adverse effects on testes and ovaries](http://phys.org/news/2011-01-sex-space-houston-problem.html) that may have rendered the rodents infertile. [Kosmos 1514](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosmos_1514) took already pregnant rats to space for 5 days, they had normal litters back on the ground. No live births has happened in space yet. Two Shuttle experiments also took already pregnant mice to space and [studied the resulting litter](http://www.indiana.edu/~rcapub/v27n1/rats.shtml). The infant rats completely couldn't "get" gravity initially but was able to adapt pretty quickly. They were also really sensitive to angular accelerations (rolling motions).

We should see more rodent studies from the ISS in the next few years now that they've got the mice facilities set up. It's actually surprisingly difficult to develop a good mouse study facility in space. The previous experiments, including the ones on the shuttle, were all completely self contained and comparatively short term. The ones done on the ISS will be longer termed and require astronauts to be able to interact with the mice. ESA, JAXA, and NASA all have their own mice hotels. The JAXA one even has a centrifuge that can provide artificial gravity to some of the population. The NASA one will, for the first time, let astronauts be able to extract, dissect, and preserve mice in space.
Doesn't have to be in the States. UBC will be very happy to take that cash too and name a building after you.
I've seen this happen on a Linux host, it's possible that it might not happen on a Windows host. There's actually not much of a protocol for talking to the printers(at least the Marlin firmware ones), no handshake as such to go through. As long as the baudrate is correct, you can just start spitting gcode at it and it'll do what you want.
I've got an emergency stop button wired to the reset pins. Slam it and everything comes to a stop immediately. You'll still have to click stop on the computer, otherwise it might start moving again, but at least the motors aren't trying to move the hotend out of bounds anymore.
I've worked on a few cwl protected UBC sites, definitely didn't have access to plain text cwl passwords even as a developer. Though, sometimes, when students mail us for support, they tell us their cwl password too when we only ask for their username.
Yes, I had to do this when I encountered visa issues. Just mailed them and asked nicely. But this was years ago.
In CS, we learn some very basic x86 to get an idea of how CPUs work under the hood. Nothing deeper unless you take something like compilers.
I should specify that I'm only talking about UBC's version of CE and CS. Not familiar with other uni's.
To add to that, one of the main differences between CE and CS is that CS covers a lot more on the mathematical side of computers (e.g.: [the foundation of computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation)). So unless OP considers math not a science, this is why CS is on the science side.
Wrong type of sport, go talk to the "esport" people. It's just as much of a timesink and I hear they do pretty well in tournaments too.

Alternative service does have several English specialty positions, but competition is surprisingly stiff, you have to have a pretty high score on one of the official English exams (e.g. TOEIC) or have at least a bachelor's degree from a foreign university.

It should be noted though that if you choose alternative service, you'll be serving for 6 months. Regular military service is only 4 months. The difference being that all 4 of those months in the regular military is going to be restrictive military style living vs only about 1 month in alternative service.

In either case, you should start learning to at least read some basic Chinese, it'll help a ton.
"Symbiote rips away from eggs sack (spine tears free)", small text in the lower left corner. So looks like it's just regular sized.
PD works pre-patch, but the range it works at is bugged. Instead of firing when the missile is within PD range, it only fires if the enemy ship is within PD range. Since PD range is a measly 8, this means a fleet will get pummelled unless it closes the distance to mix it up with the Prethoryns. AFAIK, this was fixed when they buffed fighters and nerfed PD accuracy.
Maybe you should try for a minor/combined major in CPSC then? Go talk to a department advisor. Problem is the courses you need are overcrowded, so getting a spot is might be problematic.

For jobs, assuming you do well in the courses and actually retain the material (interviewers love to ask data structure/algorithm questions). Your major issue is the lack of experience. You can increase your chances by showing that you can code. Not the short <1000 lines stuff you usually do for course work, but larger programs. Bonus points if you can *read* other people's code, too. So start a github, do a personal project, maybe join someone else's project, or join a hackathon (nice quick way to get experience working with other people and end up with a project you can point to on your resume).
I agree that over-enrolment isn't an issue for UBC in general, enrolment numbers haven't changed that much.

I disagree that hiring faculty takes time though. Research positions and tenure takes time, yes. But if you just need people to hold classes, you can hire sessional lecturers pretty quickly. This is what happens for a lot of summer session classes, since a lot of the regular faculty goes off on vacation. This is why I'm attributing the lack of instructors more to the funding issue than anything else.
> UBC does not have a hiring freeze (CPSC might have, but that is between them and their Dean). That's patently untrue. It is not awash in money for new hires, but new hires are made every year.

There is a hiring freeze. It started back when the BC government [froze hiring and wages](http://www.vancouversun.com/business/government+freezes+hiring+management+salaries+natural+revenue+falls/7237291/story.html) across the entire province. There are hiring exceptions though that, afaik (former staff here), were made on a case by case basis (e.g: replacements for attrition, new programs deemed critical to the university). Some people are [really unhappy](http://blogs.ubc.ca/workplace/2016/03/ubc-vague-on-budget-opaque-on-process-ubcnews-ubc100-bced-bcpoli/), especially about the [exceptions](http://blogs.ubc.ca/workplace/2015/08/hiring-freeze-on-ubc-middle-managers-requested-rejected-highered-caut-bced/comment-page-1/).
> UBC doesn't have a problem. 

No, UBC definitely has a problem. A chronic funding shortfall problem. I thought the issue is much more well known than this, but apparently not. [This article](http://old.ubyssey.ca/opinion/why-your-tuition-rises-every-year432/) is old, but it's a great summary of the underlying issue UBC is facing. The problem has only gotten worse since the article was written. UBC isn't alone in this, if you check the news, you'll see lots of BC school boards facing the exact same issue.

Note that CPSC's hiring problem is compounded by the fact that there's also a hiring freeze on (to save money). So even if they have people to hire, they can't (at least, not without great difficulty). I should also note that Dr. Gupta originally promised a significant amount of funding increases for the academic side of campus. I'm guessing that CPSC counted on that for hiring additional staff for the new influx of students but the resignation rendered it into the mess it is in today.

I rather suspect Dr. Gupta's resignation is more due to budgetary conflicts with the BoG than anything else.
Haha, neither do I. Don't worry, it's a joke they did for the 200th episode.

Funnily enough, the designer of the Mendel90, nophead, [asked the same question as you did](http://forums.reprap.org/read.php?2,95828,97482#msg-97482) in the vertical x-axis standardization thread. Suffice it to say that, in real world use, the vertical x-carriage wasn't noticeably structurally inferior to horizontal. The vertical x-carriage also makes head changes easier and requires less plastic. So it ended up being pretty popular.
Some of the answers are in the books. The SGA Legacy novel series was pretty mediocre in general, but one of the things it did well was delve much deeper into Wraith culture and history, with Todd at the center of one of the storylines. The names the Wraith gave humans were hilarious.

Oh, and I liked this one little twist they put on Sheppard:

> Teyla put her head to the side. “You are very much like John,” she said. “If he can only save everyone, then he will be worthy.”

Make a maintenance ticket for housing, maybe they'll fix the squeaky bed.

If not, buy some lube and tell your roommate that you guys are going to spend some quality time together with his bed. Try to find and fix the squeak: tighten nuts and bolts, lube the joints and springs. 

Or just google and print out some instructions on fixing squeaky beds.

To be fair, the survival rate may be a side issue, it sounds like they're more interested in how the various hospitals were able to coordinate and handle the sheer number of patients.

No, there's no site for the LT hub (yet?). The notice is meant more for faculty, if they're looking for support on using Connect and other sites.
Looks like the elearning.ubc.ca site is being decommissioned, not Connect. IIRC, there's still a few years left in the Blackboard contract. There's some work on switching a few courses to MIT's edX though, so they might switch to that after.
Ehh, it's probably just poor wording there, sounds like he wrote code for Kepler, not for this paper.

As a space enthusiast, I should note that it's definitely possible for amateurs to find planets in Kepler data. Automated analysis still misses things and there's just too much data to go through for professional astronomers alone. They've been asking the public to help process the data through [Planet Hunters](https://www.planethunters.org/#/about) since 2010.
The BC PNP process is newly overhauled and only just took effect Feb of this year, it's extremely unlikely you're going to to find anyone familiar with the process.

Some of them, yes. Opportunity and Spirit are covered in solar panels, check out their [self portrait](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Spirit_Rover_Cleaned.jpg). Curiosity is too large to be solar powered, so it uses a nuclear battery instead, which is basically just a large chunk of radioactive plutonium that generates a huge amount of heat as it decays. This heat is used to generate electricity.
The point is, because the writers aren't scientists, the longer the explanation, the more likely it'll be that the dialogue [starts sounding terribly like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5EaoSA02LM&t=25s) and your brain explodes from [how nonsensical it sounds](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1mXzYc606i0/hqdefault.jpg). Now, if they were going for *The Martian* level of scientific accuracy, I'd be annoyed by the interruptions too, but they aren't.

Fictional science strives to be just plausible enough that it doesn't ruin the suspension of disbelief. Brevity aids in this illusion.
Honestly, as a Trek fan also, that never bothered me. Cutting off long technobabble is for the best. It's too easy for it to devolve into non-sense (see Star Trek: Voyager).

Really, what matters to me more is that the writers show they're scientifically literate. They don't have to get everything 100% accurate, but they do need to have a good understanding of how a scientific mindset operates. And in this regard, SG1/SGA has never disappointed me. In fact, in a media where immoral scientists are a popular trope, the opening scene of The Ark of Truth impressed the hell out of me. It was a wonderful and succinct depiction of *moral* scientific outlook.

As a side note, I'm not saying all nonsensical technobabble is bad. *Deliberately* nonsensical technobabble can be used to humorous effect (see Doctor Who). 
Spirit got stuck and died cause it couldn't get enough sunlight where it got stuck. Opportunity is being driven backwards and dragging one of its wheels behind it, but it's still going!
The server doesn't have to be on the UBC network, since it doesn't do any file transfers by itself. What the server does do though, is whitelist UBC IPs, so only people in UBC can connect.

I suspect it died to low traffic, not enough people knew about it. I took a peek back in after I graduated, and it seems that the big sharers left and didn't really get replaced.
> CPSC 322 is about AI, but I heard it is not as useful as 340 - correct me if I am wrong please.

322 teaches you relatively more primitive AI techniques, but that doesn't mean it's no longer useful. There are plenty of problems that can be solved without entering the 'big data' realm.

Don't worry about useful, just take 340 since you find it interesting. You can always try the other classes out in the first week anyways, see if any one of them appeals to you more.
I don't know, that sounds about average.
Haha, decoupler launches you say, [it used to be possible](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1k3iw4/how_to_decoupler_launch/)! But there's been a lot of changes since then, so who knows now.
I did [just that](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1n88hk/challenge_out_of_control_decoupler_based_rcs/) when the challenge first came around! I think the SRB version is harder and more impressive though.
[Done](https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1n88hk/challenge_out_of_control_decoupler_based_rcs/)! I did this back when the challenge first appeared.
That's why I said sorta. There's no reason why power from the naquadah wasn't being used to tap a little pocket of subspace similar to ZPMs though. The little naquadah vial might not have sufficient energy density to power an intergalactic gate by itself.
We sorta did, you just need a staff weapon power cell, a toaster, a microwave, and be speaking Latin. Only one time use though.
It was a linguistic shift, instead of inventing a new word for 0, they decided to shift their existing counting words, so their word for 1 now means 0, 2 became 1, etc.
I actually had a roommate no one ever saw in Fairview. We knew he exists cause of the light under his door, the pot smoke coming from his room every night, and his stuff in the bathroom, that's it. It was the summer session, so he just disappeared one day after a few weeks, but no one in the unit ever saw his face. And yes, I did try knocking on his door to introduce myself, no response.
Haha, I guess nobody uses FTP now anyways. But the important part is that you're are still exposed to some fun C time.
Do they still have you write a FTP client in C? That was my first introduction to the pitfalls of manual memory management & pointers. Terrible at the time, but on reflection, it taught me a lot.

If you want web dev work, then yes, add to those skills. Node is backend (server side) only though, so you might want to look at a frontend (browser side) framework too, e.g. something like jQuery or AngularJS. It'll also be good to learn how to use a database, MySQL/MariaDB is pretty standard. Modern day web dev has become unforgivably complicated, you'll have an advantage if you can show that you've got basic full stack experience already.
International students pay full tuition, none of it is subsidized by the university or the provincial government. None of your tax dollars have gone to them. The real problem is that provincial funding hasn't kept up with inflation, so UBC has been scrambling for alternate sources of funding to plug the gap. Seeing as how domestic tuition fees are capped, it's more likely that international student fees are being raised partially to help pay UBC's increasing share of domestic student subsidies.
At some point, you'll realize that most languages are basically the same, and that picking a new one up is trivial. So don't worry about picking up new languages, just write more code. Pick a language you like, do projects. Learning how to structure your code properly and efficiently is something that you only pick up by experience. There is a difference in organization and thinking as a codebase grows more complex, e.g.: going from a small 100 line program to a 1000 line program.

As an analogy: Right now, you know vocabulary and grammar, which lets you put together sentences. You still need to learn how to combine sentences into effective paragraphs, and then paragraphs into well-constructed essays.

Many rescue organizations oppose charging as it causes people to not call for rescue when they need it ([a BC example](http://www.northshorerescue.com/services/charging-for-rescues/)). Honestly, as very much an indoors person, I don't have much interest in this issue. Mainly just wanted to point out that charging people for SAR is still an active and valid point of debate.
Not a strawman when cash-strapped public agencies already charge people (e.g.: [Canada](http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1892621,00.html), [US 1](http://www.wmur.com/news/hiker-saved-from-white-mountains-appeals-rescue-fee/32656678), [US 2](http://www.outsideonline.com/1986496/search-and-rescue-public-service-not-exactly)) for negligence. A for-profit would be even more... *motivated* to recover costs.
Honestly, I wonder if the imagination and creativity required to improve Star Trek exists today. What new technology can you envision for the new Trek that would blow our minds as much as seeing hyposprays, communicators, tricorders, voice activated computers, holodecks, etc for the first time? It's much much harder to make us all go "the future is *awesome*" again.
If you haven't seen them, these two are widely regarded as some of the best Trek episodes and fits your criteria well:

TOS: "The City on the Edge of Forever" , season 1, episode 28  
TNG: "Inner Light", season 5, episode 25
The most complicated part for me was the section on labelling the extrusions and your diagrams for where the T-nuts go. Maybe you can put labels directly on the rendered image of the frame? Would save some text to read and should be more intuitive to grasp. Also maybe color code the labels and use that color consistently throughout the rest of the doc?

Spelling error, deigned should be 'designed':

I'm impressed, there's precious few hobbyist printers with manuals as detailed as this.
Waving at the door solves another quirk with the sensors though. The sensor detects *changes* in motion, so if your arm is already in the sensor's view when the green light turns on, it might not detect enough change in motion to trigger. This is what happens to the people who put their hand on the door before the green light turns on and then proceeds to try to ram their arm through the door. Doing a wave helps to 'reset' the sensor by moving your hand out of view.
Yeah, I'm way too lazy a user to use Arch, Manjaro sounds like an awesome blend though.
Convention says that the downside to rolling releases like Arch is the higher chance that updates may break things. Would you say this is still a valid concern? Do you find that you have to expend more effort on system maintenance than when you were on Debian based systems?
We don't know, and that's why we do it. Did anyone predict that launching the Hubble Space Telescope would improve breast cancer detection? Did anyone predict that launching the Voyagers would help us detect humans trapped under 20ft of rubble? Or maybe someone predicted that the Shuttle's SRBs would let us more easily rescue people from car wreckages? Let's go even older, and look at pre-Apollo days, were they predicting Apollo would help us get cordless drills, athletic shoe soles, lighter fire fighter breathing equipment, computers that don't take up whole buildings?
The glove system actually is two parts, an inner pressurized glove and an outer thermal glove. The outer glove just goes over the inner one like a second glove and can be removed while on EVA. I'm guessing that since the extra glove looks smaller than the outer thermal glove, it might be a way for astronauts to temporarily gain more dexterity in their fingers by switching out for a smaller glove.
Oh no, I definitely agree that achieving the required alignment is a pain.

I didn't do a good job of expressing the actual point, so let me try again:

I'm pointing out that there are good reasons why OP sees many designs out there that seems to overconstrain the z-axis. If you can achieve the required build precision, the overconstraints are an advantage: They allow you to put heavier loads onto the screw and also let you drive it faster. You can calculate the max load and speed that a given lead screw can be safely subjected to with different support structures, and the results show that leaving one end unsupported reduces the max load and speed. This is very much relevant for printers that have a heavy z bed and/or longer z travels.
In general, when using lead screws, the issue with what you call "overconstrained" z-axises is assembly, not the constraints. The problem in assembly is making sure that the smooth rods and the lead screw are all exactly parallel to each other. Misalignment is usually the core cause of binding with "overconstrained" z-axises, the constraints shouldn't be blamed.

The practice of leaving one end of the screw free floating is from designs that use *threaded rods*, not lead screws. Here's an excellent article about the differences between them: http://www.protoparadigm.com/news-updates/accuracy-vs-precision-and-threaded-rod-vs-leadscrews-in-3d-printers/

Lead screws *should* be supported on both ends, it's better in pretty much every respect (strength, precision, operational lifetime, etc) than leaving one end free. If you want to dive deeper, look up "critical speed" and "column strength" for lead screws.

Edit: Should note that I'm assuming the lead screws/smooth rods aren't defective and are appropriately sized for the load. E.g.: If the lead screws or smooth rods are damaged, not straight, that'll cause the z-axis to bind. If they're under sized, then they'll be slowly bent by the load and eventually bind.
Nothing happens when what? When you issue G29? Did you issue G28 before that? Give us some more details to work with.
Seems like it's more that the stuff they're welding doesn't respond well to arc welding. They started off trying to use this special lightweight aluminum-lithium alloy to try to build lighter Shuttle external tanks, and found out that friction stir welding delivered far better results: https://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/12-056.html
Yes, you can apply now. Conditional Letters of Acceptance are accepted for study permit applications, [according to the CIC](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/tools/temp/students/letter.asp).

In case it's not clear, this is a two step process. You need both a "study **visa**" and a "study **permit**". The visa lets you *enter* Canada. The permit lets you *stay* in Canada. You only get a study visa and a "Letter of Introduction" when you apply outside of Canada. You take the Letter of Introduction with you when you fly to Canada and hand it over to Immigration in the airport. This is where they'll actually issue you a study permit, and probably where they actually check your acceptance.

This might also be helpful, [UBC's instructions on applying for a study permit outside of Canada](http://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/courses-registration/course-registration/required-immigration-documents/study-permit/how).
In the book, the packaged shit was sterile, having been exposed to the very much below zero Martian atmosphere. Only Watney's own shit was biologically active, which the book later mentioned as being a good thing, cause the chances of getting intestinal problems such as e coli poisoning is pretty much nil when you're only using your own shit.
If it survives 1 month of normal use as a temp storage for downloads, I stick it into the array. This was originally based on information from the old Google hard drive study where they noted that new drives, if they're gonna fail early, mostly fail in the first month. Backblaze's hard drive studies also noted a bathtub shaped failure curve, but I don't know if their data also supports the 1 month testing period.
Standard 60/40 rosin core. Lead free might have stayed solid, didn't have any at the time.
I remember making the mistake of soldering instead of crimping the wires on to the resistor. Realized that might be a problem when the connection points kept liquefying when printing.
Pretty sure those temps should be in Celsius. Dropping the bed temp decreases the sticking strength, give that a try.
Fear of exactly that caused the Soviets to heavily obscure and hide Korolev's achievements. It wasn't until his death that the West learned how crucial a role he played. Ironically, his failing health was more due to the harsh years he spent imprisoned in the gulags than anything else. The Soviet rocket program might have had a far greater lead than it did if they hadn't killed so many of their own scientists and engineers during the Great Purge.
The Soviets landed and even brought back samples from the Moon, several times. There was a Soviet mission orbiting the Moon when Apollo 11 entered orbit. Difference was, the Soviet missions were not manned, and so was completely overshadowed by Apollo. They were quite impressive technological achievements in their own rights, though.
Which is itself based on NASA's HL10 according to your source. This is hilarious, the Soviets took the HL10, improved it and built a prototype, which the Americans then picked up and refined into the HL20, which is now the basis for the Dream Chaser.
Alright, hope this solves the problem for you then.
The one you're looking at seems to be a Printrbot extruder clone and should work fine if it's a decent clone. If you still have issues, you can try to replace the extruder drive gear, [there's stronger options](http://airtripper.com/1676/3d-printer-extruder-filament-drive-gear-review-benchmark/).

What tests did you do to eliminate the hotend as a factor?

Which reminds me, there was a toilet paper roll dispenser on here some days ago, it would pair well with this thing.
You might have hotspots on your bed, uneven heat distribution puts extra stress on the glass. Might try putting your piece of aluminum on the bed, then put glass on top. The aluminum acts as a heatsink to even out the heat distribution.
Did you get to use any of the larger Goo units? I too, enjoyed the game... until I got near the end of the campaign and unlocked all the large Goo units. The larger units makes the collision detection all derpy, causing unit groups to path stupidly. Almost felt like I was playing Brood War again with the babysitting required.

They *are* using friction stir welding.

> Fewer welds but the cost of manufacturing the center section out of one solid block of aluminum has to be enormous not the mention the cost of the one of a kind machine capable of machining something that large with the tight tolerances nasa requires.

They've already tried using several smaller pieces. For the first Orion capsule test flight, EFT-1, the capsule was made from 18 smaller pieces requiring 33 welds. The new 7 weld process detailed here is actually an improvement from that previous process.

With something as specialized as building rockets, you kinda need "one of a kind" machines. Case in point: [the new friction stir welding machine for the SLS](http://spacenews.com/boeing-still-tinkering-with-giant-welder-for-sls-stages/), which had its own problems.

Parts are machined from aluminum plate, not a block. [Check out the huge CNC machine that does this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qj4GehMizmc). Incidentally, the machining is done by outside expert machining companies, so NASA did not buy a new "one of a kind" machine for this.

> It just seems wasteful especially when friction stir welding doesn't really add weight and it's just as strong. 

They saved 700 pounds from reducing the number of welds. The welds actually do add quite a bit of weight, this is to ensure that the seams have the strength needed.

Honestly, it's a sign of the renown and impact of the Apollo missions that people forget the Soviets sent an army of probes to the Moon at the same time. They even had 3 lunar sample return missions. You don't need to speculate whether robotic missions would've been better. We *know* it wasn't.
Sorry, I don't think it'd be a good idea to tell students how to break into the clock tower. Though, that guy in your other thread really did give you good hints.

Funding wise, Cassini only had the lander cause it was a cooperative mission with ESA. Huygens, the lander, was built by ESA.

You mean *almost* everyone. We nerds yo, we ain't normal people. There's been countless arguments and rebuttals posted on the subject of Star Wars vs Star Trek. Even people analyzing individual frames of CG to "calculate" weapon yield and such. Eventually, you start see the same arguments repeating over and over. Nowadays, I just go, "I like Trek better, so Trek wins", end of discussion.
I'm partial to the view that a copy isn't created: the transporter takes advantage of the wave-particle duality of matter, it enhances the wave aspect of the matter in your body, letting matter travel as a wave to a new location, then reversing the effect. So it's still your original matter, just behaving differently while in the transporter.
What, [enough power to destroy a solar system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGd8oEzT5Lo&t=1m12s) isn't enough to take on a Star Destroyer?
Given that the Enterprise was classed as a heavy cruiser on screen, I'd say your comparison is more apt.
> But the Falcon has hyperdrive which is clearly way faster than warp drive.

The standard response to this is the problematic line where Han states that the Falcon can [only make point five past lightspeed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mrx24jofi0w). So, either they live in a small galaxy or they live in a universe where the speed of light is much faster than ours.

Of course, the standard response to that is to point out that the problematic line has since then been retconned in the EU to make more sense. Though now that the EU is itself retconned out of existence... The rabbit hole just keeps going deeper.
They'll definitely have a local system, because it's useful. Mark out the seasons, separate out daylight hours from night time hours, etc.

We do already have several lunar calendar variations from various cultures though, and some are actually still in use, so the hard part might be getting people to standardize on one.

They'd probably have to invent one for Mars. But it's interesting to note that [NASA has actually found that it's surprisingly difficult to adjust to a Martian day](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/02/jet-lag-is-worse-on-mars/386033/). Makes me wonder if future Martians would have "planet-lag" coming to Earth.
Completely true so far. And I've outlined why I think there's a good chance it'll be true in the future too.
> Eh... BioWare is made up of like three studios now. BioWare Austin, who work on SWTOR. BioWare Montreal, who are working on Mass Effect 4. 

They did the same with other studios, most noticeably, Maxis. New studios with just the name, dedicated to producing sequels to The Sims. Until eventually, the original studio was shut down and all that's left is the name.

> And BioWare Edmonton, who are apparently working on a "couple of new pieces of IP".
>
> Also: DICE created Mirror's Edge, a brand new IP, four years after they were acquired by EA. Plus they just released Battlefront, which is a new IP for them.
> Visceral is reportedly making a new Star Wars game as well.

Only Mirror's Edge is a new IP. I'm not saying EA doesn't produce new original titles, but it's an extremely rare event. They just prefer to run existing franchises into the ground, then buy out new ones and repeat.
Being bought out by EA is a slow death. You get stuck producing endless sequels to existing franchises. Eventually, all the originality and innovation gets beaten out of the team, and we end up with the same formulaic game every year (e.g.: The Sims, Battlfield). Notice how [BioWare hasn't produce any original properties since EA bought them out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioWare#Games). EA is *extremely* [risk-averse when it comes to new titles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Realms). Mass Effect was started pre-EA, and it'll be the last original thing BioWare ever do.
The stock hotend has a ptfe tube that goes partially into the nozzle. You're basically limited by the temperature which ptfe starts to deteriorate, this is usually quoted as 260°C. I wouldn't go much higher than 240, to leave some margin for safety.
Check out [Penny4NASA](http://www.penny4nasa.org/mission/), which was born from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbIZU8cQWXc). The idea is to double NASA funding so that it's 1% of the national budget.

Looks like I'm mistaken. I thought they had conquered the exotic matter problem, but looks like they only reduced it.

Looks like I'm mistaken. I thought they had conquered the exotic matter problem, but looks like they only reduced it.
> What he's not doing, is working on how to negatively warp space. He's not working on how to generate exotic matter. That's the critical (and impossible) part of an Alcubierre drive.

You're using severely outdated information to judge the current Alcubierre drive experiments. Exotic matter is no longer required. To, as you put it, "negatively warp space", they think they can get baryonic matter to simulate dark energy. Advancements in Alcubierre's original model were made to bring down energy requirements to a level that can be observed in a lab, and this is what they're trying to do now, see if their purely mathematical framework has any bearing on reality.

Edit: My mistake, looks like they only reduced the exotic matter problem, didn't remove it.
AFAIK, there are 8 controllers on the Voyager team. With one person retiring, there's still 7 controllers who can train the new guy. And that's exactly what they're looking to do, find someone they can train.
Raise the hotend temperature to a point where the filament inside softens, but not hot enough to melt, then pull the filament out of the hotend. Lets you clear jams without having to disassemble the hotend. [More detailed instructions](https://ultimaker.com/nl/support/view/149-atomic-method). Also called a 'cold pull', and can be used to [clean your nozzle](http://bukobot.com/nozzle-cleaning).
No worries, didn't mean to make it sound like I disagreed with your point. I meant it as a general rant against the sentiment that basic research is a waste of money.
> Where do they get this money from? A research that cannot be applied today, is unfortunately a money pit. The more money is lost without a return, the less money is able to go back to sustain that research. You need to refill the tank somehow.

Lost, without return, if you only take the quarterly profit view. Just because the return from investments into pure science takes time to materialise doesn't mean it's non-existent. It can take decades and even centuries, but the return is potentially continuous and staggering. 

When James Maxwell proposed a unified view of electricity and magnetism in 1861, he didn't think that his work would become a foundation of the modern world. From generators to motors to transistors to MRIs, we are inundated everyday with the results of a purely theoretical exercise that, at the time, *had no practical applications*. Feel free to put the profits from this one theory to "refill the tank". It would be only fair. Hell, just 1/1000000th of it would do, is that too much to ask?
Should note that it's not required to use a Raspberry Pi. If you can throw a linux distro on it, you can probably run Octoprint on it. I'm using a free old laptop from my boss, a 2004 IBM Thinkpad R51.

Found it from the Monogatari x Madoka [collaboration preview](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2015/09/20/more-monogatari-x-madoka-magica-collaboration-goods-previewed), seems to be official artwork.
Assuming the flat ends are the top and bottom, split the model into top and bottom hemispheres. People can print them separately, without needing to use supports, and then glue it together. Should note though that the latch detail might not come out well, would only know more with an actual print.
Do you have something above the PCB? Glass or metal plate? The only reason that printing on the side without the heating element is safer is that it prevents the copper traces from being damaged if the hotend runs into the bed. If you've got something over the bed, then you can flip it over without worries.

You should also add insulation on the underside to get it to heat up faster.
It's not NFC, but there actually is a chip in there too, to prevent people from easily cloning/tempering with the cards. What you've described is the antenna. When I checked during the beta, they were using a MIFARE DESFire EV1.

Yeah, I went from having infrequent, but random, jammings and underextrusions to perfect reliable operation.

I like the anti-seize idea, especially given its 800+ C temperature tolerance. You can even use it on the nozzle threads, to improve thermal contact there too if need be.
Putting thermal paste on the upper heat-break threads is the [recommended solution](http://wiki.e3d-online.com/wiki/E3D-v6_Troubleshooting#Inadequate_cooling_and_Filament_Jamming).

>Like the heatsink and fan cooling your CPU, proper thermal conduction is necessary for the heatsink to work. In the case of your E3D hot end, the threaded heat-break tube should be snugly tightened into the heatsink otherwise the threads will not make sufficient surface contact to conduct heat. If you are printing in hot climates or continue to have issues, a liberal coating of thermal paste on the upper heat-break threads will ensure much better thermal contact with the heatsink. 

They also recommend that retraction can't be more than 5mm or it'll drag hot filament into the heatbreak, jamming it. This is with a normal e3d heater block though, so don't know how that applies to your setup.
Musk did say to nuke the hell out of the poles, so nuke the water ice too. Water vapor is a stronger greenhouse gas than CO2, would that be enough? Just need to wait a few decades for the radiation to die down.

> Senate appropriators suggested that NASA’s plans announced earlier this year to procure Soyuz seats for missions in 2018 indicated that the agency was not confident at even this early stage that the two companies with commercial crew contracts, Boeing and SpaceX, could remain on schedule to begin flights in 2017.

NASA buys more Soyuz seats due to previous cuts in commercial space flight pushing back schedule. Senate now cites that as reason for current budget cut. Wat.
For the most part, researchers were honest and happy to help the experimenters try to reproduce their results. I think the high failure rate is more indicative of how we don't have a good grip on the complexities of psychology yet. So even if Data was well versed in it, it might still not be enough to help him understand humans.
Yes, the article mentions that reproducibility in other fields such as cancer studies has worse reproducibility issues. I brought the reproducibility problem up more as a symptom that the field of study is complex, we still don't have a good grip on it, so even if Data is up to date with the social sciences, it might still not help him understand humans.
On the other hand, social sciences is pretty hard to get right. There was an attempt at reproducing the results of 100 papers from leading psychology journals recently. [Over half of them failed, only 39 were reproduced](http://www.nature.com/news/first-results-from-psychology-s-largest-reproducibility-test-1.17433). So that really is no guarantee. Though who knows, maybe they've made huge advances in the 24th century.
A self destruct would actually create more debris, increasing the chance of collisions. Current end of life procedures are to either deorbit the satellite or boost it into a higher graveyard orbit (high enough that the chances of it hitting anything are very small).
That's true for *threaded rods*. OP is probably using leadscrews instead of threaded rods. Unlike threaded rods, leadscrews are meant for linear motion. They're (supposed to be) built to stricter tolerances, and thus cost more, but won't differ in straightness like with threaded rods.
Basically, a love potion gone wrong.
Strangely enough, he was not a test pilot and NASA actually rejected his first application to be an astronaut because of it!
Yes, it could have an effect. [But this solar cycle's maximum has been the tamest one we've seen on record since 1906.](http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/predict.shtml) Also, solar maximum was reached in April 2014 and has been trending downward ever since. So it's very unlikely that the stronger El Nino was caused by solar activity.
El Nino has a summer effect too, just usually not in North America. The summer effect is much stronger in South America, [here's a nice chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:El_Nino_regional_impacts.png). 

This year's El Nino is stronger than usual, so we are actually feeling some of the effects too, this summer has been drier than usual here in Vancouver, [we're on water restrictions and the water reservoir level is lower than average](http://www.metrovancouver.org/services/water/conservation-reservoir-levels/reservoir-levels/Pages/default.aspx).
Haha, I preferred letting the enemy shoot first on my reinforced shields, then unloading on them when their shield power gets diverted to recharging weapons. I missed the game so much, bought the original on GOG right when it got released. The gameplay still holds up all these years later, even if the graphics doesn't.
> I think there were maybe two spots where you had a choice to make. I honestly felt that the crew was ordering me around.

Yeah, one of the most common complaints about BC back then was that the First Officer did all the talking for you. Interestingly, the developers had planned a more interactive dialogue system, but it was cut due to time constraints.
Starfleet Command. The best tactical starship combat I've ever played. Trek space combat is more in the style of 18th century naval combat, and this game follows that spirit faithfully.

There were several other excellent Trek games from that era before the Activision take over, but since no one's mentioned SFC yet, thought I'd throw it in.

You say that like humans never rejected androids. The Omicron Theta colonists wanted Lore shut down. With the failure of Lore, I think Dr. Soong took extra effort to make Data as acceptable to the colonists as possible. Data was accepted easily because he was designed that way from the start, with obvious flaws, weaknesses, shortcomings. Androids like Data complement humanity, without threatening to replace them.
Assuming you're talking about the fancy blown powder ones where they inject powder only where it's needed, the build platform is 5-axis so they just rotate the part until it's no longer a bridging operation.
Not all frequencies of light can pass through our atmosphere, [different air molecules absorb different frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_window#/media/File:Atmosfaerisk_spredning.png). Plus, the Earth is just too warm for certain measurements. Some space telescopes can be cooled to only a few degrees above absolute zero to see the lowest energy photons from the universe.
Yes, it's not practical to produce whisky in space. But that's not their goal anyways. They have a hypothesis about the aging process being enhanced by the suppression of liquid convection. Ground tests weren't powerful enough to be conclusive. Since convection is really limited in orbit, moving their test into space should give them a conclusive result. If their hypothesis proves true, it'll be used to improve whisky made on the ground.
Wooden barrels aren't exactly spaceflight certified. Shipping a piece of wood separately and adding it on orbit would make more sense.
There's only one science study on the fumes produced by 3d printers, and it's a bit limited since they only measured amount emitted but not what was emitted. I'll just quote from it directly:

"For comparison, our estimate of the total UFP emission rate for a single PLA-based 3D printer (1.9–2.0 × 10^-10 ) was similar to that reported during cooking with an electric frying pan (1.1–2.7 × 10^-10 ). The same 3D printer utilizing a higher temperature ABS feedstock had an emission rate estimate (1.8–2.0 × 10^-11 ) similar to that reported during grilling food on gas or electric stoves at low power (1.2–2.9 × 10^-11 ), but approximately an order of magnitude lower than gas or electric stoves operating at high power (1.2–3.4 × 10^-12 )."

"One important limitation to this study is that we have no information about the chemical constituents of the UFPs emitted from either type of 3D printer, although condensation of synthetic organic vapors from the thermoplastic feedstocks are likely a large contributor (Morawska et al., 2009). In addition to large differences in emission rates observed between PLA- and ABS-based 3D printers, there may also be differences in toxicity because of differences in chemical composition. As mentioned, thermal decomposition products from ABS have been shown to have toxic effects (Zitting and Savolainen, 1980 andSchaper et al., 1994); however, PLA is known for its biocompatibility and PLA nanoparticles are widely used in drug delivery (Anderson and Shive, 1997 andHans and Lowman, 2002)."

Note the last bit, they speculate that pla should be safe, abs not so much.
Both scenarios happened in The Enemy. Geordi had to reach a beacon visible to his visor to be rescued but the planet's EM field scrambled the visor's neural link, leaving him blind.
Ahh, [Cape Canaveral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station#/media/File:Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station.jpg) back in its heyday in the 60s.
From the expected lifetime of the thrusters, they calculated that they needed two, and packed a third one as a spare.

Interesting, never seen that board before.

In my experience, stepper drivers actually run pretty cool when they're adjusted correctly. [This guide](http://bootsindustries.com/portfolio-item/pots-adjustments/) is for ramps, but the mechanism and principles are the same. The heatsinks are more of a 'just in case' thing for long prints.
The board looks like a derivative of the [Sanguinololu](http://www.reprap.org/wiki/Sanguinololu). Does the kit come with a fan to cool the stepper drivers?
This is actually a concern for moving metal parts on spacecrafts. The protective oxide coating gets slowly removed during operation, exposing clean metal surfaces, eventually sticking the moving parts together. It doesn't have to be perfect cold welds resulting from clean flat surfaces, since even an incomplete weak weld is enough to cause failure. [Here's a nice rundown of different techniques used to prevent cold welding in space](http://space.stackexchange.com/a/4175).
You're pissed at their expanded scope, I get that. But to accuse them of lying about their intentions is misleading. It's not like they did it quietly hoping no one would notice. They flat out told us that they're going to aim for something more ambitious now that they know there's solid support out there for them. I'm actually quite happy that they were able to expand their scope into a professional production. It's that much less chance that it'll turn into your usual cringey fan film productions.
As a donor to both Kickstarter projects, I don't see what you're on about. In the Axanar campaign, they stated, quite clearly and upfront, that they expect the budget to climb and that this was only the first round of funding. They've also stated, in updates, that due to the success of the first campaign, they're adding in new costs that they previously didn't think they would've been able to do, such as paying the crew. You can argue that their new projected spending is unrealistic, but you can't say they haven't been open about it.
A heated bed will improve your print quality (esp for larger prints) and expand the types of materials you can print. Octoprint can be run on an old computer, no need to buy a RPi.
Unlike more expensive models, cheap calipers eat batteries like candy, e.g.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8oopG2GpF0

This upgrade would let you use rechargables and would last significantly longer. I personally just remove the battery from mine after use, since I don't use it that much. But if I did have to use it more often, this solution looks great.
There's a few posts by someone who actually autoclaved some 3d printed parts using various filaments, maybe you can get in touch with them:

You're probably thinking of [this novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kobayashi_Maru_%28Star_Trek_novel%29). None of their solutions was to blow up the Kobayashi Maru though, but it was an excellent read, I loved Scotty's solution.
That makes it a bit clearer. Sorry for the hasseling.

You don't? Fine, let's "de-lawyer" your answer.

Translation: All stuff that previously work on Linux still works on Linux. The new stuff? It doesn't work on Linux. And we don't see a need for it to run on Linux right now.



["Shall we die together?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOXT22Ghouw&t=1m05s)
You've got a point there, hard to beat that.
>Apollo hardware was more capable in a very important sense - payload to LEO and TLI. ISS is 5.5-6x the size of Skylab, but it took dozens of shuttle launches. Skylab went up in ONE LAUNCH of 1960s hardware.

Note that I said most capable vehicle *in space*. And I've already conceded that it isn't the most efficient vehicle with current technology.

> We wanted an airliner to space. We discovered that capsules probably do the same job for less effort and risk.

Not an airliner to space, a construction truck in space. From servicing Hubble to rescuing failed satellites to building the ISS, the Shuttle pioneered complex space construction. All necessary lessons if we truly want to establish a presence in space. Lessons we would never have learned if we only had a capsule system like the Russians did.
Spaceplanes are awesome. It might not be the most efficient with current technology, but that doesn't mean we rule it out as a concept forever. 

Despite all the undeserved Shuttle hate, it is still the largest and most capable manned space vehicle we've ever put in space. No vehicle now or currently in planning can match it (unless you want to count space stations, that is).
Looks like the the print doesn't have enough time to cool off before it starts the next layer. You can try printing a larger object to eliminate cooling as a factor and see if the dimensions are still off, e.g. 20mm calibration cubes. For fixing the cooling problem, you should first check if the print cooling fan is turning on while printing or try a lower temp, 215 is high for pla.
This is called combing in Cura, you can disable it in retraction settings. More info: http://support.3dverkstan.se/article/30-getting-better-prints#retraction-and-combing
Indeed. And it should be noted that both Shuttle accident reports found that the root cause was organizational, not technical. NASA management failed to follow sound engineering practices, weakening safety standards due to flawed reasoning, and did not want to hear dissenting opinions. Reading Richard Feynman's [special appendix to the Challenger report](http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/51-l/docs/rogers-commission/Appendix-F.txt) was depressing enough by itself. It just gets worse when you read the [Columbia report summary (pdf)](http://history.nasa.gov/columbia/Troxell/Columbia%20Web%20Site/Documents/Congress/CRS%20Summary%20of%20CAIB%20Report.pdf) and realize that NASA completely failed to fix itself after Challenger.
Not an expert, but the general answer is that moist air only travels so far before the moisture condenses out and falls back to the ground. It could be geographical. Are you high up? The higher the altitude, the less moisture the air can hold. Are you on the wrong side of a mountain perhaps? Moist air can get trapped on one side of a mountain, leaving the other side dry. This can be seen in the Pacific Northwest, where the Rockies makes Vancouver and Seattle famously rainy. Are you just far from open water? The moisture in the air probably condensed out before it reached you.

But then, there are cases where yes, as you've indicated, there are deserts right next to oceans. Take for example, Africa. If you look at it from space, you can see a green belt around the equator but a dry desert belt both below and above the equator. This is due to a tropical atmosphere circulation feature called the Hadley Cell, where hot moist air rises from the equator, travels northward, and falls back down as warm dry air. The original moisture in the air condenses out rapidly as it rises, hence the resulting jungle belt sandwiched by deserts.
> How are you managing to only damage radiators?

Climb up and shoot them? Weakening them is a safety measure to make sure that any of my units can finish it off. This was before I realized that you were being penalized for not making A-rank runs, so I always went for the safe strategy and never bothered retrying a mission.
I found out that you can avoid summoning Selvaria until the very last turn, made the mission substantially easier. She only shows up when you kill 2 radiators. So you can kill the first radiator and then weaken the other 2 so that they'll die in 1 hit. Wait until very last wall to take both of those radiators out in one turn. If you wait until the very last wall, the radiator won't immediately snap back in when you kill one of them.

Hydrogen burn-off igniters. Basically a small rocket engine filled with zirconium pellets. The sparks you see are the hot pellets being blown out by the rocket motor, which ignites potentially destructive excess hydrogen that might collect under the rocket.
> That would be a valid argument if the game wasn't already out and developed for the PC.

Usually, once a game is out, you don't expect major changes to happen to it. This isn't the case with KSP. Everyone *knows* that major changes can and will be happening (e.g.: Unity 5). The potential for the game heading towards an undesirable direction is still here.

Personally, while I agree with you that Squad has been great to the community and should have earned a bit of slack, I can understand why people panicked at the console port.
The anger is due to history. PC gamers, over the past decade, have continually seen their favorite titles being... simplified gameplay wise and hamstrung in technical aspects all due to being moved to consoles.
Hey, gotta remind people that Canada actually does stuff in space too, lol.
As a space enthusiast, love the background. IRL counterpart: http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/287299main_dextre_iss017_big_full.jpg

The large robotic arm is the [Canadarm2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_Servicing_System) and is attached to the [Harmony module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_%28ISS_module%29), which is the electrical & electronics hub for the ISS. Connected to the Harmony module's sides are [Kibo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibo_%28ISS_module%29) and [Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_%28ISS_module%29), the Japanese and European labs respectively. The other robotic arm thingy is [Dextre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dextre), a multipurpose attachment for the Canadarm2, it's attached to the [Destiny module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_%28ISS_module%29), which is the US lab. The partially visible black module at the edge of the pic is a [Shuttle docking port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressurized_Mating_Adapter) which is itself attached to the [Unity module](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_%28ISS_module%29), a connector module.


212C might not be hot enough. According to the [Taulman3D site](http://taulman3d.com/t-glase-features.html), the optimum temperature for T-Glase is about 235c to 240C. This is probably near the top end of safe temperatures for your hotend. So you might want to try a lower temperature at a slower printing speed.
It actually integrates quite well into the episode. I like to think that if it had been a 2 parter, this story would be second part.

I haven't seen any convincing debunking of the Backblaze articles. The problem with all of the debunkings that I've seen is that they're all anecdotal, with no equivalent data set to back them up. Case in point: 

> heat played a large factor.

The data disagrees with that statement. Google's [hard drive study](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub32774.html) noted:

> The figure shows that failures do not increase when the average temperature increases. In fact, there is a clear trend showing that lower temperatures  are  associated  with  higher  failure  rates. Only at very high temperatures is there a slight reversal of this trend.
Backblaze themselves noted that it was a massive outlier involving only one specific Seagate model from a specific time period, all their other Seagate models are working as expected: https://www.backblaze.com/blog/3tb-hard-drive-failure/
That's what I'm assuming from these lines in the specs on the [store page](http://store.steampowered.com/app/353370/):

Though, I suppose that doesn't really outright state USB power.
It does have a micro-usb port for those of us who prefer going wired.

Pretty much this, at least, universal translator implants are what was implied in DS9 ["Little Green Men"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7B3Ypqpxh0&t=30s).
Yes, ship models were saved, but there's more than just ships that goes into a scene: shield effects, weapon fires, ship movement, camera placement/tracking, lighting, etc. AFAIK, Digital Muse underwent a hostile takeover and the new owners were quite...unfriendly. Paramount was able to use legal pressure to retrieve the ship models, but no other work was handed over.
> This, along with other articles from the VFX folks that worked on DS9, made it clear that they created all the digital art assets for DS9 with a level of detail that they knew wasn't going to be seen on screen.

Could you link the other articles? I've been under the impression that the VFX work done by Digital Muse, the other effects house for DS9, is pretty much all lost except for the ship models. The one you linked only confirms that the work done by Foundation on DS9 is still available.
> any thread on a Trek subreddit that enumerates the flaws of ENT (or any of the series) isn't going to fare well

We must disagree again. Posts that criticize JJverse fare quite well. Conversely, posts that try to defend the new movies aren't popular. A lot of Ent fans accuse early Ent watchers of not giving it a chance. It'll be quite interesting to see if, in another decade, we'll see sentiment toward the JJverse movies reverse and similar accusations raised against the current community.
I disagree. Enterprise lovers are by far the majority here. Posts outlining why people think Enterprise sucked doesn't get much love.
This is exactly the criticism at the time Ent was on air. Much of the creativity seems to have left the franchise.

As a quick fix, create a file named `.xprofile` in your home directory and put your xrandr calls in it:

    xrandr --newmode "1920x1080_60.00" 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync 
    xrandr --addmode VGA-0 "1920x1080_60.00"

And then you'll have to set `.xprofile` to be executable, run this in your home directory:

    chmod +x .xprofile

This should automatically fix your resolution when you log in. Note that this'll only work for you, if there are other users on the computer, they'll need to apply this fix too.

If this still doesn't work or you would like a system-wide fix, you'll have to look into adding your monitor configuration to `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/`.
Maybe he went to the Starfleet Academy on Vulcan. Had no problems. In fact, he accidentally forced 8 instructors to re-do their Kolinahr training and ended up being invited to lecture at Mount Seleya for the Kolinahr masters.
Both times was due to problems with the launch vehicle though. I guess that's why they're hitching a ride with an Air Force payload this time.
> But why, if they're part of the same vaccine, is rubella gone, while measles still gives us trouble? The World Health Organization recently announce that efforts to eradicate measles have stalled. The answer lies in the diseases themselves. Paul Offit, an infectious disease specialist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, tells US News and World Report’s Kimberly Leonard that measles is more contagious than rubella or mumps—and that while measles requires 94 percent of people to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, rubella only requires an 85 percent vaccination rate.

FTA
10 years is a bit much. Mainly because the SLS has, unfortunately, been mandated by Congress to reuse Shuttle technology instead of letting NASA build some new stuff. The Shuttle's main engines, external tank, and SRBs are all being reused in the SLS, albeit with some modifications. So it's not like the parts/machinery/tooling have disappeared.

Also, the Smithsonian asked NASA to deliver Discovery as it was last flown. NASA pretty much did just that. Besides an initial inspection, the Smithsonian hasn't touched it since. Discovery probably just need the usual Shuttle servicing to fly again.

The only really time consuming obstacle I see is vehicle assembly and the launch pads. The launch pads were converted to service the Falcon Heavy and the SLS. The vehicle assembly building is undergoing a massive refit and modernization for the SLS. It'll probably take quite a bit of work to make them Shuttle compatible again.
Maybe your power supply can't handle the load. Try printing without the heated bed?

Since no one has mentioned this, do you make sure to leave the cooling fan on for a bit after the print is finished? If you don't, too much heat can creep back up the heat break, expanding/softening the filament in the heat break, jamming it. To be safe, I only shut off the cooling fan after the hotend is below 100 C.

The Asgard can just beam the symbiote out. They did this for Colonel Caldwell.
Because if public agencies like NASA doesn't go first, no one will. Going into the unknown entails exorbitantly high costs and risks, with a return on investment that takes decades. Private industry won't do it. The inner solar systems are only now looking economically relevant because of half a century's worth of  past investments in "expensive" and "entirely scientific" missions. NASA has been and *should be* the trailblazer, absorbing the exorbitantly high cost and risk of going into the unknown, passing on the lessons they learn for free to make new frontiers accessible.
Wish I could have that problem. My printer spends far more time being broken than printing.
Wow, didn't know that, it looks much more feasible.
That's still a huge spacecraft or perhaps multiple smaller ships. There's other hurdles, such as what if the asteroid is rotating in such a way that you can't heat up one spot? The point is that once you start considering the actual implementation, a gravity tractor or ion beam shepherd doesn't seem so "inefficient".
Carry the thought further. How large of a mirror would you need to gather enough energy to melt rock? Remember to factor in the fact that solar power is pretty weak beyond Mars, where most asteroids live. Is it practical or even possible to launch a mirror that size into space? As an example, the James Webb space telescope has the largest mirror we've ever built for space at 6.5 meters.
Asteroids aren't so easily vaporized. Unlike comets, which are mostly ice/dust, asteroids are mostly rocky/metallic.
The article splits them into long range and short range options. The gravity tractor is for when the asteroid is still far away and small changes in its trajectory deflects it significantly. Nuclear weapons is the short range option, when the asteroid is too close for it to be deflected so easily.
Yep, Patience thought the young ladies needed to know which men would make the best catch, so she gave out longer staffs to those she thinks would be a better catch. Fitz's staff was... exaggeratedly gifted.
My impression was that he's a Catalyst, possibly Bee's Catalyst. The bright fog is Bee seeing all the myriad possible futures he can bring about. I believe it matches the Fool's description of what Fitz's Catalyst-ness looked like in one of the earlier books, but can't remember which one.
Same here, humid environment, never had a problem. Hell, there was one spool I spilled a cup of water on and it printed fine after I let it air dry. I'm inclined to believe it depends on the composition of the plastic.

Different franchises are handled differently, e.g.: Star Trek and Star Wars is handled like that, but not Stargate. All of the Stargate games and mods I remember being taken down were not out for money, just fans trying to have some fun.
I really hope they get to release something, but MGM has a long history of issuing copyright takedowns on any and all fan made Stargate games and mods they hear about.

I'm not sure how trustworthy it is though. The figures for the amount of energy released when that millennia-long time loop broke is just ludicrous, it should've permanently deranged the fabric of local space-time, but no changes were detected.
Pilot Coleto, got it slotted with pen, pencil, and eraser. Cause I'm too lazy to carry them separately. Honestly, the eraser is too small to be of much use, would jump ship instantly if there's a multi-pen system with a better eraser.
Remember, the story is narrated by Fitz, if the ending doesn't seem as... involved... blame Fitz. And read the sequels. I think they tied up the loose ends quite nicely.
That article is a bit old. I was basing my thinking on this chart, which includes flights after the Shuttle resumed flight: http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/03/27/science/space/launch28timeline/launch28timeline-tmagArticle.png

The point is that even after the Shuttles were grounded/retired, there were no resource issues with regular reboosts.
It did. The pilot filled me with hope. First contact with the Klingons were never addressed in any of the other series. Neither were how hostilities started. It was a great opportunity for them to write new stories without contradicting the previous series!

So, of course, we never saw any of that.
Now, that is a nice [picture](https://figures.boundless.com/11778/full/sts062-42-026.jpe). Apparently, one of the experiments they were doing accidentally amplified the effect.
> When the shuttle was flying, we were able to boost it into a higher orbit regularly and cheaply, but since the end of that era it has been harder for them to find the extra resources to do that.

I don't think this is right. Even during the Shuttle era, reboosts were mostly done by a visiting supply vehicle, usually Progress. The Shuttles didn't launch often enough to perform the regular reboosts. And since the supply vehicles have to go up there anyways, it's not that expensive to put a bit of extra fuel on them.

> Reboosting can cause severe shaking of the ISS and has been speculated to have damaged parts of the station in the past. 

Did not know this. I guess this is why they prefer the smaller, less powerful thrusters on the supply vehicles. [It looks like reboosts now are pretty gentle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_mAna3-b-I).
Wow, this is new to me. Found a NASA research paper on it, apparently, atomic oxygen is the biggest issue. Some metals form a layer of oxide which protects them afterwards, but other metals need to be plated with something non-reactive (gold was one they tested) to protect them.
That makes sense. And /u/tyzbit's [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/30pk0m/why_will_the_iss_expire/cpuo1m4) confirms it.
> Without particles temperature doesn't have meaning. 

An object in space definitely has a temperature, since the object itself is composed of particles. 

> Isn't the vacuum of space such a good insulator that excess heat is the only real issue?

It is a good insulator, but that doesn't mean things don't get cold. Spacecrafts lose and gain heat by radiation. Photons from the Sun hitting it heats it up. Photons emitted by the craft (in the infrared, mostly), cools it down. So if the spacecraft is in shadow long enough or if it's far away from the Sun, it'll radiate all its heat away and get cold enough for metal to contract, become brittle, electronics to stop working, etc.
Good question, you'll have to ask an actual astronaut. The debris impacts might not make much of a noise, since they're usually tiny <1cm particles.
They do, but the modules are [shielded](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whipple_shield).
For that picture of the Mir solar panel specifically, it was cause a Progress supply ship [collided with the station](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_M-34). Mir was one beat up station, this wasn't the first collision it had.
Because space is a very harsh environment to operate in:

Every orbit (90 minutes), the station undergoes extreme cold and then extreme heat as it cycles between the near absolute zero of the dark side of the Earth and then bake in direct sunlight on the day side.

Micrometeorites/small debris continuously hit the station at a high speed (faster than bullets). Each modules' "armor" degrades with each impact, eventually, they're going to fail and holes are going to start appearing.

There's also the radiation, since they're above a lot of the atmosphere that blocks it out for us on Earth. The magnetosphere also provides less protection.

Keeping humans alive in space requires a large safety margin. The expiration date is when engineers estimate the station might not be durable enough to keep people safe. At some point, you just need to put new equipment in orbit.
Ohh, yeah. Perhaps Will was the one who was selling the Skill scrolls or maybe even teaching Skill to the OutIslanders.
1. Probably someone who fulfilled the same role as Henja in the Tawny Man trilogy. Serving as the eyes of the Pale Woman and relaying instructions from her through the Skill.
2. The crew is probably partially forged, either deliberately by the Pale Woman or maybe due to the prolonged exposure to their cargo of memory stones.
3. The crew going mad with fear is probably due to the Skill being used on them. The Skill was being relayed by the same person in #1, hence why it stopped when Fitz repelled. Now, Will was using the Skill to confound and spy on Fitz, which is basically the same thing that happened with the White Ship, hence the comparison. I thought Verity never saw it because their link broke?
4. When I read it, I assume they were laughing at the pitiable few boats the Six Duchies fielded for defense.
5. Maybe some of the repel was fed back along the Skill fogging the crew, before it was broken.

Probably cause everyone just uses drones. They were kinda op, unless you were in a DN/BB, you just don't have enough phasers to take on the drone ships.
They were actually buying it from Russia for a while, but Russia is in the same situation as the US: not producing plutonium-238 and stockpile running low. Hence the DOE/NASA program to restart production.
It's been ages since I played, but yes, SFCIII was lackluster. One popular complaint at the time was that they dumbed down the game too much. Seriously, what's so hard about shield facings that they decided to reduce it from 6 to 4?!
That release is far past its end of life. The original repositories don't even work. You're just making it harder for yourself. What's wrong with 14.04?
There's quite a bit of little details they got wrong, but to be fair, it probably only bothers spaceflight enthusiasts like me. E.g.: When Dr. Ryan was in the Soyuz, she was wearing the Russian [Sokol space suit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokol_space_suit), which was not designed and not capable of EVAs. Yet, she used that suit in 2 EVAs: cutting the Soyuz parachutes and when transferring to Tiangong. 

Just have to throw this in here: [How to put on the Sokol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gaFXZWhp4k)

Somebody actually got close enough to find out?
There's a distinctive look to models printed using the powder + glue + color ink process. The actual printer itself is made by the same company, which currently has a monopoly on this particular 3D printing method due to patents.
The process you're referring to works for plastic prints. But as other people have noted in this thread, this looks like it was printed by a powder based printer. The print is basically made from a very fine talc-like powder held together by glue. It might not be advisable to apply solvents to it.
You mean a far larger country like [Russia](http://www.netindex.com/download/2,14/Russia/) having cheaper and faster internet? See [Canada](http://www.netindex.com/download/2,7/Canada/) for comparison. Yes, land area can be a factor, but it by itself alone is *not* a sufficient factor to explain why our ISPs are so crap.
Are you going to be printing on a professional printer then? You usually expect hole sizes to be correct on the pro printers. For hobbyist printers, this post pretty much documents all the factors: http://hydraraptor.blogspot.ca/2011/02/polyholes.html

Racket (first year) and Java (second year) are the two major languages for those years. But really, it doesn't matter what language you learn, the basics are shared in all languages. You're more learning a different way of *thinking*, and the more practice you have at it, the better you become at programming.

Calculus is a Faculty of Science requirement, so yes, advanced preparation there help too. Math in CS is more about mathematical reasoning, writing proofs. You can look up introductions to mathematical proofs. And, of course, there's tons of logic, so you can look at first-order logic too.
Google was never interested in the hardware side of Motorola. They wanted Motorola's patent portfolio. At the time, Android manufacturers were getting sued left and right for patent infringement. There's a reason you don't hear much of that anymore and it's why [Google is keeping most of Motorola's patents to itself](http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/29/google-keeps-vast-majority-of-motorola-mobility-patents-in-sale-to-lenovo/).
That sounds like the [Great Observatories Program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Observatories_program), maybe that's what you were thinking of?
This is why they're careful to call the JWST the *successor* to Hubble and not the replacement. A visible light capable replacement for Hubble is still in the proposal stage: [Advanced Technology Large Aperture Space Telescope](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Technology_Large-Aperture_Space_Telescope).
Also doesn't help that the mission flip flopped between canceled/postponed/reinstated for a few years. We're pretty lucky that it actually got launched in the end.
Dawn was built before even the iPhone 1 came out. The iPhone 1 only had a 2 megapixel camera. Dawn's 1 megapixel camera isn't that far behind.
Debris and micrometeorids are constantly hitting the station, degrading the shielding around the modules. This puts a time limit on how long the ISS modules can be safely inhabited before holes start appearing. If they want to continue operating the ISS much beyond 2024, they'll need to start replacing some of the older modules that've been up there for more than 2 decades. 

Which takes us back to budget, cause someone has to fund the replacement modules.
That talk has been discredited by the researchers themselves: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1wac0p/howdy_unidan_here_with_five_much_better/cf047yz
NCC-1701, no bloody A, B, C, *or* D also got the refit, so this is fine.
I see. Then the closest example I can think of is flexible filaments. For ninjaflex, they recommend that you add additional supports for tall thin parts to prevent the model from flexing as the print head moves.
I think the shaking isn't a problem if you've got good hardware, e.g.: a nice linear rail, maybe vibration dampers on the motors. 

I do wonder if the moving print can cool it down too fast though, causing lifting/warping problems.

Yes, we haven't directly observe the Oort Cloud, but the cloud does occasionally kick stuff inward into the solar system, where they become comets. Everything we know about the Oort cloud has been inferred from those comets. You've probably heard of at least one of them: Haley's comet.
> 2: Phlox was the one who told the captain not to help. He threatened to leave if he didnt get his way. 

Yeah, this behaviour is very much at odds with all the other doctors, they would've insisted on deploying the treatment.
Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, will be orbiting out beyond the Moon's orbit in the L2 point. It'll actually be using the bulk of the Earth to help block sunlight.
The other captains would probably avoid contact with pre-warp ships, but never mind the captains, this episode was about the doctors. I think all the other doctors would be firmly on the side of helping the Valakians.

According to the background information, the original ending was changed by the studio so that Phlox doesn't disobey an order from Archer. I'm guessing that the original ending does indeed have Phlox ignoring non-interference and distributing the cure, which would've been much more consistent with the other doctors and made far more sense than the actual ending we ended up with. That 'genetic dead end' excuse was flimsy as hell.

Pretty sure the joke was more that being on an alien planet based on an ancient human culture is pretty much all Stargate episodes.

But if we must name an episode, then I suggest "[The Sentinel](http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/The_Sentinel_%28episode%29)", since the planet's name, Latona, is the Roman equivalent of the Greek god Leto. There's a lot of overlap and confusion between Greeks and Romans, so it would be an acceptable mistake to make. Plus, there's a good retreating firefight in that ep too.
I think it's because the scientific advancement argument is the most difficult one to make, even though it's the most convincing one. The core problem is that it's counter-intuitive, how does spending money in space help us out here on the ground? To answer that question convincingly, you pretty much have to take them through a quick lesson on the history of science and how science works. Conversely, arguments based on the lure of exploration and the desire for survival are intuitive emotionally, you understand them pretty much instantly.
Part of it is for the spacecraft's own safety. They're not sure what the environment around Pluto is like. Remember, we've only recently found out that Pluto has multiple moons. Who knows what other small dark objects might be in the area.
The title is a bit confusing. Most of that image is the surface of Mars. The only rover dust build up you can see in that photo is on the nameplate. Here's an image that has more of the nameplate and rover in it: http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=6213

Here's a better image that shows dust on Curiosity: http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=6352
Ok, gonna be a dissenting opinion here. I read the first few and walked away seriously disappointed. To be fair, it's not like there's anything majorly wrong with the stories, it was a decent story. It's just that every once in a while, you come across a little detail that just feels off. Stuff like the Daedalus-class ships no longer having Asgard beam weaponry and can't take on Wraith Hiveships. And they were never able to get the tone right, missing out on the moments of levity and not-taking-itself-seriously that made Stargate so enjoyable. 

Overall, it felt like the authors watched the first season of Atlantis, read synopsis for the rest, and then wrote the novels. 
Our particle accelerator was like *whoom whhoom whhoom* and then it went *BANG* and radiation went EVERYWHERE. Some squirrel nearby got hit with a big dose. Thus was born Carter the Coyote.
I've always read that the comet's surface was very soft and dusty. The landing dampener registered a soft landing and Rosetta photographed a [dust cloud rising from Philae's first landing](http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2014/11/16/philae_spotted_after_first_landing/).
According to the article, it's a GE engine. Thought Boeing decided to get into the engine business for a moment.
Yes, there was supposed to be a thruster pushing the lander against the comet. Unfortunately, the thruster failed when they tried to turn it on. On stream, before the landing, they mentioned that they were now completely relying on the harpoons due to the thruster failure.
There are also screws on the landing feet. There's a thruster that'll push the probe against the comet while its feet screws into the surface.
Don't know what they use, but in principle, 2mm pitch is better than 2.3mm. Assuming your standard 1.8 degree stepper motor, which means 200 steps per rotation, 2mm / 200 steps = 0.01mm per step. If you use standard 0.1mm increments for layer heights, this works out very nicely (10 steps gets you exactly 0.1mm of travel). Not so for 2.3mm pitch.

Note though that this does make z travel a bit slow. Some designs use 4mm or 8mm pitch for faster z travel since they also work out nicely in the same way if you use micro-stepping. Downside is, you have to take into account that a micro-step is weaker than a full step.
> Dr. Laura Mersini-Houghton, a theoretical physicist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill states, "that it is mathematically impossible for black holes to exist".

AFAIK, the paper only theorizes that stellar collapse can't form black holes. Since there are other ways for black holes to form, it doesn't rule out the existence of black holes entirely. Much more detail here from an actual astrophysicist: https://briankoberlein.com/2014/09/25/yes-virginia-black-holes/
Sort of, I guess it's the forward swept pylons, flaring at the attachment to the engineering hull. No other Fed designs really uses those 2 factors together.
Undomesticated equines could not remove me.
> are they in all rockets?

Launches from Baikonur usually don't have one, as you can see in the [Proton-M crash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl12dXYcUTo) last year. They rely on the fact that the area is very remote and uninhabited for range safety.
During the press conference, they mentioned that the range safety officer did send the self-destruct signal. One reporter asked how much of the explosion we saw was the malfunction and how much was the self-destruct, they replied that they don't know yet.
The software solution at the time still didn't deliver as good a result as the hardware fix though. Interestingly, the software ended up being adapted for medical imaging. Turns out determining whether an unfocused blotch is a star or a galaxy is a similar problem to spotting tumors.
It's definitely part of it, there was a lot of audience fatigue after VOY. I remember how much hate there was toward the writers for the overuse/nerfing of the Borg, time travel stories, and repeated inconsistencies in the canon. 
That reimagined Saber is absolutely amazing.

Only two designs comes to mind for me:

The [original design](http://www.modelermagic.com/?p=28446) of the *USS Enterprise-C*. They ended up with the version we actually saw due to several reasons, one of which was that the original design would've been more expensive to build: [full story](http://ottens.co.uk/forgottentrek/designing-the-enterprise-c/).

Riker's ship, the Luna-class *USS Titan*, one of the best fan designs I've seen. Check out some renders: [1](http://startrektitantvseries.blogspot.ca/2013/08/unveiling-uss-titan.html) [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OewRUeH5ha0) [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vRPJ38i8sA)
Alternate universe Uhura hasn't had her mind wiped by Nomad yet, so we might still have a repeat.
Well, if you want an in-universe explanation: When the Stargate exploded, the hyperspace window hasn't completely collapsed yet, so part of the explosion energy passed through the window, briefly traveling faster than light, hence why they were able to see the explosion faster than they were supposed to.
It looks like it might be a purge area too. Maybe it's a single nozzle design that takes in 2 filament, but only one is being fed into the nozzle at a time. So to change colors, they'd need to purge the old color from the nozzle.
In orbit, it'll bake in sunlight and then freeze when it moves into Earth's shadow. For the ISS, this is about [250 F (121 C) to -250 F (-157 C)]( http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1/).
Wonder what the tower next to the printer is for. Nozzle wiping? Another test?
Mind posting a review too? Haven't seen many instances of the bulldog working in a bowden setup.
See [/u/cshimmin's comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/2j5iup/a_team_has_designed_an_app_to_turn_the_global/cl90ogv). They're also looking for activity over a large area, not just from a single device. 

What's happening is that when high energy cosmic rays hit the atmosphere, they smash into other atoms and generate a shower of lower energy particles. These lower energy particles are the signatures they're looking for. 
Background radiation is going to be constant. The sort of high energy cosmic rays they're looking for is going to come in bursts.
Hell, rent out time on it, there's no end to the stuff that requires a supercomputer to run.
Nothing wrong with it, just that you have to be really knowledgeable about Linux. You compile everything from the grounds up, so the level of customization and optimization is pretty much unmatched compared to other distros.

According to the researchers, this is the most precise measurement ever made of the time dilation effect. The previous record holder was done by the same group and the new result is almost 5 time better. The group is also disbanding after this, as they've run out of particle accelerators powerful enough to improve on the tests.
The Kickstarter is already far above goals. They've mentioned in an update the various things that the extra funding allows them to do, such as paying the crew. It's still far below what they'd make in a professional production, but at least it's something.

Wasn't officially explained, but I like to think they finally enabled the Stargate's translation matrix in their custom DHD after realizing the aliens had no trouble talking to each other.
All of CS profs I've met were on the lenient side and, of course, knew their stuff well. When it comes to teaching ability though, it... varies. Most lectures are a bit dry, but only one or two of them were able to consistently put me to sleep (likewise, only one or two that make you just want to hear them talk).

> I'm sure this question has been asked before but it's good to get up to date information.

The old posts are still up-to-date, the general structure of the comp sci program doesn't change much. 

They teach you programming in first and second year. After that, you're presumed to be capable enough to pick up new languages by yourself (with one notable exception, the functional and logic programming course, which are 2 entirely different programming paradigms). Mind you, there's an *art* to programming that the classes can't teach you (we haven't figured out how), it's something you can only gain by experience. If you want to be good at programming, you'll have to practice outside of class too.

In first year, you are also introduced to discrete math and mathematical proofs, this is the language of the "science" part of computer science. In second year, you get an overview of computer hardware, algorithms, and data structures. In 3rd year, you get the same thing but more advanced, along with some statistics math and software development processes. 3rd and 4th years is where you get to choose electives with content that looks interesting.

I knew people in my class who've been hired by big companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, etc, it's not as rare as you'd think, but you do have to be decent. Join the co-op program if you really want to know what it's like.

I've been programming since middle school. But I still felt like an idiot during first year, that's how much I learned. Even though most of the actual computer science you learn (algorithms, data structures) constitutes a very small part of a developer's job in the real world, they're an absolutely indispensable part of your toolbox.
I think we've moved beyond questions of whether the viewers are there. Now it's a question of whether it's sustainable. I still find it baffling how teams keep themselves funded when they have a primarily tech savvy audience who hate ads and are used to free content.

The effect is significant, check out [tables 4, 5, 6](http://maison-orion.com/media/1837156-NASA-Indoor-Plants.pdf). What's more, it seems to get more efficient as time goes on (table 8). Also interesting is that they think the majority of the work is done by the root and associated micro-organisms in the soil.
The Trek licensors (prime universe, JJverse is a different group) are really lax about fan works as long as you're not profiting off of it. This is why even big projects like Star Trek: Axanar can exist.
> Most of us had already given up on the Rick Berman universe. 

And those of us who hadn't, were solidly convinced otherwise by Enterprise. If you had the luxury of marathoning the show, you didn't have to spend much time dwelling on the bad episodes. Those of us who watched it when it aired? We had *years* of only mediocre and terrible episodes.
"The New Voyages" and "The New Voyages 2" are collections of fan stories just like the current "Strange New Worlds" series. Some of them are crappy, but there were a few outstanding ones ("The Enchanted Pool" and "Snakepit" being the most memorable).

"The Galactic Whirlpool" was enjoyable, "Perry's Planet" was fine too, both felt like a good TOS ep. Hmm, and maybe "World Without End", but it's depiction of Klingons is off (e.g.: Klingon ships having something like a [political officer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_commissar) and religious adviser).

I have to agree with not reading the Phoenix books. And yes, there were a few others that I'd rather forget, but for the most part, the stories weren't that bad, just not really notable.

Not sure why so many people seems to think the target market is the average user. Project Ara has obvious parallels with the build-your-own PC movement, which despite all the hype about the death of desktops due to laptops/tablets/whatever, is still a healthy and growing market. That's the audience Project Ara is for, and they usually find Apple's approach... unappealing.
> I suspect that you include laptops in desktops here. Because it's quite obvious that you're wrong otherwise. Desktops sales fell behind laptops in 2008 and kept steadily dropping, source, if looking around you is not enough.

No, he's counting the DIY market. While pre-builts has declined in popularity, the build-your-own market has kept growing: [1](http://jonpeddie.com/press-releases/details/pc-gaming-hardware-market-to-hit-23.6-billion-in-2012/) [2](http://jonpeddie.com/press-releases/details/global-pc-gaming-hardware-sales-shrug-off-pc-market-decline/). Note that while the numbers in the sources linked includes laptops, I'm more referring to their statements that discrete gaming component (cpus, gpus, ram, etc, which are almost all desktops) are up.

> In short, the Moore's law application to desktop processing power hit an unexpected barrier: we simply don't need any more processing power at our fingertips.
 
I don't think your source says this. The barrier to Moore's Law has always been the laws of physics. All the limits to the exploits he outlined are driven by physics, not by use case. This is stated more explicitly in his [earlier article](http://www.gotw.ca/publications/concurrency-ddj.htm).

It's not that we don't need more processing power, it's that getting more processing power is *a lot harder* now, so they've been forced to focused on gains in other areas.

> A driverless car can't magically predict that a kid is going to run out from behind a parked car

Why not? The parked car has sensors, it tells all the car around it that there's a kid moving out into traffic. Or the car in front of you which has a better view tells your car. Or the road itself has sensors (smart cars, why not smart roads). And why does a parked car or other similar objects necessarily have to be a blind zone anyways? We've got [radar that can detect movement behind walls](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-15376184).

>  or that that tractor trailer is going to blow a tire

Tire sensors also exist.

> send the minivan next to you into your back
> making you spin into oncoming traffic

With perfect *safe* spacing between vehicles automatically maintained, this won't be a threat, as the other vehicles have enough space to maneuver. No reason why the other cars can't react instantly to avoid the projected path of out of control vehicles while simultaneously alerting emergency services at the same time.

No system is going to be absolutely flawless. But I can easily see a future where driverless cars are many orders of magnitude safer than human drivers, given time and some imaginative problem solving.

Ah, ok, it looks like the difference is in the theoretical basis:

> Shawyer claims the thrust would be caused by radiation pressure imbalance due to group velocities of electromagnetic waves within the framework of special relativity. 

This is the EmDrive. I have no idea how plausible that is.

> Dr. Harold G. "Sonny" White, who investigates field propulsion at Eagleworks, NASA's Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory, notes that such resonant cavities may operate by creating a virtual plasma toroid that would realize net thrust using magnetohydrodynamics upon quantum vacuum fluctuations.

This is the NASA version that I outlined above.

I think you've got it right with:

> Or is it simply Shawyer's solution that is controversial?

Shawyer's paper wasn't submitted for peer review and the only claimed independent replication result also wasn't submitted for peer review. Skepticism is only natural.
> Why is this concept so controversial? Or is it simply Shawyer's solution that is controversial?

Sorry, I haven't heard of any controversies over it? There's just a lot of unknowns to be cleared up by experiments like what NASA is doing.
Regular [plasma thrusters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_propulsion_engine) expels plasma out of the engine using radio waves.

This experiment builds on that with one difference. Whereas a spacecraft with a regular plasma thruster needs to carry propellant for generating the plasma, the engine that NASA is testing requires no propellant to be carried.

In any given point of space, there are short-lived sub-atomic particles popping into existence all the time (the particles always come in pairs, a particle and an anti-particle, so they annihilate each other very quickly). This is called [quantum vacuum fluctuation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_fluctuation). What the experiment does, is use these exceedingly short-lived, but continuously appearing particles, as propellant. They pop into existence, gets ionized, and then moved along by the radio waves (a very short distance before they die), exactly the same as propellants in a regular plasma thruster.

This is a [quantum vacuum plasma thruster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_vacuum_plasma_thruster).

Now, it should be emphasized that in the NASA experiment, their control also generated thrust when it wasn't supposed to, so there's still a long way to go before we know for sure whether this'll work.
[By law](http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/info_sht/t14.htm), you can ask your carrier to unlock a subsidized phone 90 days after purchase. If you’ve paid the full cost for your phone upfront, you can unlock it immediately.

Note though, neither Wind nor Mobilicity carries the iPhone currently, so they might not offer the next iPhone when it comes out.

Mobilicity is currently in bankruptcy, probably better to go with Wind (full disclosure, I'm with Wind). Wind and Mobilicity both uses the same frequencies as T-Mobile in the US. Their frequency set isn't very good at penetrating walls, so the signal will be weaker or non-existent underground/deeper indoors compared to their larger competitors. They're also new entrants to the market, so their network isn't as widespread (Vancouver is pretty well covered, but you can still find dead zones here and there). That said, they have the best price/feature ratio out of all the options, so you should at least try them out to see if you can live with the less reliable service for the cheaper price.

There's the UBC wiki: http://wiki.ubc.ca/Main_Page

Which has things such as past exams for some courses. Particularly, a lot of effort by students have been put into the the Math exams section: http://wiki.ubc.ca/Science:Math_Exam_Resources

There's also UBC Blogs: http://blogs.ubc.ca/

Which some instructors use as part of their course, but any student can create a blog too for free.

Not homelessness, poverty in general. This is as direct of a solution as any other I can think of. It's a focus on prevention instead of treatment after the fact.
> What exactly does Adam Savage do to help make soup kitchens unnecessary?

By fostering a life long love of learning, of problem solving, of science, in today's kids. Can you imagine a country being poor if it boasts a large pool of smart, knowledgeable citizens who love to solve problems for the fun of it?
Adam Savage, as an educator who has inspired kids for years, works on making soup kitchens unnecessary. I'm not going to begrudge him his cave.
Unfortunately, if you read the list of supported OSes, IE10 was not made available for Vista. It's IE6 all over again, but with IE9 and Vista this time... Actually, IE8 and XP would be a better comparison. One can only hope that Vista won't take anywhere near as long as XP to die.
Going to guess that it might be too bulky. Most DSLRs have an analogous system that uses mirrors/prisms to redirect light from the lens to the optical viewfinder. This adds a lot to their bulk when compared to their mirror-less cousins.
> As a web dev, I love that IE does that, it finally gets the web standards moving.

Moving nowhere, you mean. We're stuck with IE9 compatibility as long as Vista is still around.

The novels started running out of steam in a similar time line to the series. Stopped reading once they resorted to frequent galactic devastation in the books. It reminded me of how the Star Wars Extended Universe went downhill with the introduction of the Yuuzhan Vong.
The title is in Latin. A friend told me that there is no soft g in Classical Latin, so mah-gee-ka is indeed the correct form.

But if you really want to be pedantic, you can bring up the point that from Late Latin onwards (to the current Ecclesiastical Latin), the soft g of mah-ji-ka is the norm.

That's actually in the plan, they want to provide housing for 50% of the student population: [Section 2.1, pdf warning](http://hap.ubc.ca/files/2012/12/HAP-Plan-Adopted-Final-Sept-20121.pdf). I think the 50% goal comes from a student housing survey where about that percentage of students said they want to live on campus.

Given that Madoka's wish gave her knowledge of all magical girls past, present, *and future*, I'm going to argue that the events in Rebellion are all happening according to Madoka's plan. She's just letting Homura give her a little vacation to finish up all that little stuff left to do on Earth. Eventually, the part of her plan to return her to godhood will kick in and everything goes back to Madoverse and we'll all be happy again.

Since the big packs are already well covered, here's some smaller packs:

**[Taurus HCV - 3.75 Meter Stockalike Crew Capsule](http://www.curse.com/parts/kerbal/220213-taurus-hcv-3-75-meter-stockalike-crew-capsule)**

A 3.75 meter capsule holding 7 that fits right in with the stock kerbal parts. Comes with config files for a version with a built in launch escape system and one without.

**[Spherical and Torodial Fuel Tanks](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/30673-0-23-5-Spherical-and-Toroidal-Tank-Pack-%28Updated-05-02-14%29-%28New-download-link%29)**

The torodial fuel tanks look nice, and the extra large spherical ones are great for when you absolutely need to carry a large amount of fuel while worrying about part counts.

**[Aviation Lights](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/16925-0-23-X-Aviation-Lights-v3-6-%2803MAY14%29)**

It might be a case of correlation rather than causation. Thicker bezel phones have a higher chance of thicker frames, which is what actually gives them more drop protection.

A different perspective from someone who actually enjoyed Into Darkness:

In Into Darkness, Kirk did his growing up before the scene in Engineering. The movie started out with an example of an untempered "immature" Kirk. As a result, he lost the Enterprise. He then lost his mentor, Pike (this was the consequential death of the movie). He only regained the Enterprise because Marcus counted on Kirk's past immature behaviour to trigger war with the Klingons. When his crew unanimously told him how wrong his orders were and when Marcus' deception was unveiled, this was when his character had to grow up. Kirk's humble admittance to Spock that Spock would've been the better captain was the culimination. All this was accentuated by Kirk comparing his darker sides with Khan. In STID, Kirk had already grown when he walked into Engineering (the very act of self-sacrifice is the result of the growth). Whereas in TWoK, it was when he walked out of Engineering.

STID wanted to evoke TWoK without copying it and I actually found it quite well done in general.
You are the proud captain of a patrol ship in a sparsely populated sector of Federation space. You suddenly detects a Borg transwarp conduit opening on your long range sensors. You send out a distress call, unfortunately, interference from a nearby stellar nursery means that you have to go through a Ferengi subspace relay to alert the Federation.

In the universe where the Ferengi are forced uphold net neutrality, they pass on your message to the rest of the Federation, the Enterprise arrives and saves the day.

In the universe where the Ferengi did not have to obey net neutrality, they tell you that your message will go out next week, but if you pay 500 strips of gold pressed latinum, they'll lend you a Ferengi superweapon to fight off the Borg (terms and conditions may apply, see your local nagus representative for details, purchase is final, no refunds, side effects from prolonged proximity may include dizziness, nausea, infertility, radiation shielding option available for an additional 200 strips of latinum).

TL;DR - As a form of protest, NeoCities has configured their webservers so that if anyone from the FCC offices tries to access their site, the FCC would find the site to load very very slowly. They're willing to remove this speed limit, but only if the FCC pays them $1000. This is meant to demonstrate a behaviour that is currently prohibited by a principle called net neutrality, which the FCC might be looking to repeal next week.
Same experience here. Full price on the invoice, but discount was applied when they charged my credit card. Took about a month from order date,

I did email them back when I received the parts, they confirmed that their credit card processing was overwhelmed by the amount of orders and told me to just wait.
Yeah, you can do rounded corners in CSS2, but they were all hacks, most often done with images. CSS3 makes it much easier with the border-radius property. And yes, alpha channel on colors can be set in exactly the way you described now.
Yeah, there's no selectors that let you alter parent elements. You can flip the entire author/flair/date/points line though, if a more limited effect is fine?
Depends on what browsers you want to target. I've only used the parts of CSS3 that gracefully degrades in older browsers. For subreddit themes, besides the stuff already mentioned, maybe rounded corners, gradients, shadows, multiple background images, border images, transitions.
Haha, would be awesome, but the hover-only part isn't possible with css alone.
The [Progess](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_%28spacecraft%29) supply craft is now the normal vehicle used for reboosts. The [ATV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_Transfer_Vehicle) can also be used for this, but it doesn't visit the station as often. In a pinch, the ISS itself has thrusters in the [Zvezda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvezda_%28ISS_module%29) module.
Now that you mention it, yes, that could be. Would make the character more evil, lol. [spoiler](/s But if you go with the emotionless premise, it makes the last scene of Rebellion with the ragged Kyuubey quite... enjoyable... if you think that Homura might have beaten fear and despair into Kyuubey's race)
Ahh, sorry, totally forgot about the CSS validator. I've only just been experimenting in the element inspector to see if it worked with the theme. Judging from the lack of activity on the css filter related pull requests in github, it doesn't look good.
Yep. Try it with rotateX for the regular transform though, that's probably what most people meant by flipping things upside down. The IE filters can be modified with the mirror option to achieve the same effect.
It's a pain, but rotate has workarounds for universal IE support:

This line was meant for IE6/7:

>  filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(rotation=2)


Add this for IE8:

    -ms-filter: "progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(rotation=2)";

And this for IE9:

    -ms-transform: rotate(-180deg);

Regular transform works for IE10+.
**Favorite:** 

The moment when *everything* came together after learning about Homura's past. You flash back to all the previous episodes and reinterpret all the scenes in a new light. And a rewatch rewards you with nuances and subtle touches that you didn't notice before. Just awe-struck at how well the story is constructed.

**Least Favorite:** 

Kyuubey's explanation of their motivations. The idea that magical girls are perpetual motion machines was brilliant (and strangely amusing). But I have a lot of minor nitpicks for the rest. E.g.: He expresses befuddlement at how humans feels tricked and deflects the fault back to the humans for making their wishes in the first place. It didn't seem fitting for an emotionless race presumably driven by logic. A decision made under conditions of ignorance is logically suboptimal, to say the least. And without the Incubators, the Wish wouldn't have been possible, so the deflection of guilt doesn't seem in character either.
It's there in the article's source, just not in the article itself: http://historicspacecraft.com/Rockets_New_Space.html#SpaceX

Just curious, how does it compare to the proprietary resin? Do you get the same quality prints?
Jose Delgado has one fully functioning hand and one missing fingers. Both of the artificial hands basically only has two motions: open and close hand. The expensive hand has inflexible fingers in a curved shape (drop your hand to the side and relax, that's what it looks like) and only the thumb, index, and middle finger actually exerts any gripping force. The other two fingers, while they move, are mostly cosmetic. The 3D printed hand fixes these shortcomings: it opens wider, the fingers straighten more, and all of its fingers exert force for gripping. He estimates that with the stronger 3D printed hand, he can hold objects up to around 20 lb (9 kg).

The 3D printed hand is controlled fully mechanically, it looks like he bends his wrist to open and close it. This turned out to be more reliable than the expensive hand (it monitors muscles in his forearm, I think), which can get confused by sudden shocks, e.g.: when he's driving and hit a bump.
There's two parts to it, afaik:

1. Some PSUs have separate 12v rails, each rail only providing a certain amount of current. Older PSUs can't provide enough current for the printer on only one 12v rail, so you bundle them together to get the required current.
2. Safety precaution so that no individual wire is carrying too much current.

With your CX430, it looks like it's got a unified 12v rail that can provide 28A of current, so you don't have to worry about #1. For #2, just check that the wires on the 24-pin connector are thick enough that it won't burst into flames if asked to carry however much current a Mendel90 needs.

To add onto /u/FredH5, a dummy module (1x1, I think) they had only has 40% of the PCB space left after the UniPro hardware. They're also working on shrinking the electropermanent magnets to gain more space.
Actually responding to the fixed positions claim. But for the processor-memory link, we know that the current prototype core module is in a 2x2 block and contains the CPU, RAM, storage, and an SD card slot. They at least envision that the default storage will be expandable with a storage block.

That said, there's no technical reasons why they can't separate out the CPU and RAM in later revisions if they want (though there might be economical reasons), given that computers have had RAM and CPU separate for ages.
Yeah, don't know how the fixed chip positions idea came about. The chip interconnects were explained in some of the initial PR material, iirc.

Not really a problem. Read up on [UniPro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UniPro), which is what Ara is using to connect the chips. The idea is to apply how we connect computers into networks into a inter-chip network.
They are. You don't need to watch them.
Historical precedence. The situation and strategy was very similar to how Microsoft took over the PC space from Apple.
Thanks! My post was completely wrong then. Any ideas on why it happened?
I picked that up from the article itself:

> Ultimately, she transmitted the measles to four other people, according to a recent report in Clinical Infectious Diseases that tracked symptoms in the 88 people with whom “Measles Mary” interacted while she was sick. Surprisingly, two of the secondary patients had been fully vaccinated. And although the other two had no record of receiving the vaccine, they both showed signs of previous measles exposure that should have conferred immunity.

It looks like the actual paper is here though: http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/58/9/1205

From the abstract:

> of 88 contacts, 4 secondary patients were confirmed who had either 2 doses of measles-containing vaccine or a past positive measles IgG antibody.
The article is terrible. This case isn't surprising and is actually a good illustration of what happens when herd immunity is destroyed. The focus should be on the fact that 86 of the 88 secondary patients were NOT vaccinated. If the anti-vaxxer claim that vaccines don't work were true, the number of patients who are fully vaccinated should be much larger than the mere 3 in this story.

Edit: I'm wrong, see [response from study author](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/22t4mt/measles_outbreak_traced_to_fully_vaccinated/cgqxzct).

Slippery slope fallacy. Limitations on individual freedom in order to preserve the safety of the group are not new. From prosecutions of murder to drunk driving to shouting fire in a crowded theatre, all these fall under reasonable restrictions on individual freedom for the public good.

Just want to add that being able to read the man pages is pretty much a requirement for command line fluency, check out the one for [curlftpfs](http://linux.die.net/man/1/curlftpfs).

I notice several options that can help diagnose issues by outputting more information, i.e. (-v, -d, ftpfs_debug)

Other interesting options for a speed up might be tcp_nodelay, or maybe you need to disable some features that your server might not support using disable_eprt or disable_epsv.

[curlftpfs](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mount_FTP#Using_curlftpfs_to_mount_a_FTP_folder), lets you mount ftp shares and interact with them like a regular directory on your computer. Link is from Arch, but the package name is the same in Ubuntu. sshfs does the same thing, but for sftp.
Maybe it's just me, but I thought of it as echoing McCoy's love/hate relationship with technology, especially with Pulaski's comments about the transporters when she first showed up.
> Would the kernel module for the restricted extras stuff rely as heavily on kernel versions as the driver does at the moment?

Kernel version incompatibility going forward should disappear. The userland-to-kernel interfaces have guarantees of being [stable across versions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Linux_kernel_interfaces.svg), so a user-space Catalyst won't need to be updated when a new kernel shows up. The open source kernel module will never be outdated, since other kernel developers can keep it up to date even if AMD can't.
[Dominion Google Glass](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Virtual_display_device), lol. The two different versions were explained by Memory-Alpha by the shoulder mounts being used on the larger Dominion cruisers while the small ones were used aboard the small attack ships. Personally, I prefer the idea that they're the same, just the shoulder mounted one is an old "Gamma Quadrant" model and the other is a newer model they developed while trapped in the Alpha Quadrant.
Patented by Stratasys. That's why it isn't common place.

> There are legitimate safety concerns associated with corporatized pharmaceuticals that are tested dishonestly to protect corporate investments (...) the companies that produce the vaccines have been known to manipulate test results to get them approved even when there are serious adverse effects found

An evil profit driven corporation such as described would *not* invest in any vaccination research in the first place. Vaccines protect you from being sick, how're they going to make any money if you don't get sick?

There is truth in that there is very little financial incentives for vaccination research. In reality, the primary movers for vaccination research has always been from governments, universities, and non-profits. Corporations usually only gets involved after the heavy lifting basic research has already been done.

Note, even if a bad vaccine makes it through the approval process, it's very unlikely that they'd stay on the market for long. Vaccines have to be and are continuously monitored while in actual use (e.g.:  programs like the [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System](http://vaers.hhs.gov/index)).

I've seen some of the "adverse effects" examples from anti-vaxxers. None of them made any sense as they were based on misunderstandings or omissions of information (e.g.: insufficient testing or adverse effects in populations that the vaccine isn't even targeted at).
There's a TOS episode, where warping out while inside a planet's atmosphere was considered a dangerous maneuver: http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/The_Naked_Time_%28episode%29

Other than that, breaking orbit seems to be sufficient for safety.

> Why worry about space when we have enough problems here on Earth?

The key here is that science is all connected. Discoveries in one field can have vast influences in another field. Before we went into space, no one thought that it'd vastly improve our meteorological knowledge. Once we were in space, the application became obvious. Nowadays, we take it for granted that we have satellites which can track hurricanes in the middle of the Atlantic. Pushing the frontiers of human knowledge, like NASA does daily, is a risky endeavour. You don't and *can't* know what you might find. Maybe you find something that currently isn't useful but later turns out to be very beneficial (and this can take decades). Maybe you find something with immediate applications. But maybe you find nothing, that's just a risk we as a species have to take, if we want to improve our knowledge.

One non-obvious example of how investing in space helps us on Earth, using algorithms for communicating with distant spacecraft to search for survivors trapped in rubble: http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-290
When you say this:

> One point I disagree on though. I doubt that you understand Haskell better because you know how a function prologue looks like in assembler code.

You are doing this: 

> stay in rejecting ignorance when you encouter them because "it's too low level".

In functional programming languages like Haskell, recursion replaces loops. This causes space issues when you have deep recursive calls due to the way that functions calls are stored in stack space. This is solved by something call tail call optimization (abbreviated TCO by /u/phoshi).

No abstraction is 100% leak proof, low level details can and *will* leak into higher levels. No one is saying that you have be a complete expert on all levels of abstraction that exists in a computer. That is, indeed, an impossible goal. But the more levels of abstraction that you understand, the better you will be at programming.

Um... yes, yes it is. An *informed* person makes much better decisions than an ignorant one. In a democracy, where power rests in the hands of the people, every citizen should be as informed as possible, for the good of the nation. There might be other be other factors in teaching kids scientific literacy, but the most important one is to better their decision making.

> Using electromagnetic fields to attract satellites and/or move the vehicle

Not attract satellites, but can be used to move them. Some explanations of how an electrodynamic tether can be used for propulsion:

> The use of a net to capture satellites
> The notion that you can flow current through the net to accomplish something

Yeah, looks like it's not a net, I've edited my previous post about it.

> The notion that defunct satellites are a significant part of orbital debris.

From the [paper](http://debrixgroup.com/cdn/uploads/2012/09/space-debris-removal-system.pdf):

"Explosions of residual propellants and collisions between satellite remnants or
rocket upper stages can generate large quantities of
smaller debris, which greatly increases the probability
of collisions by a cascade effect. Due to such cascade
collisions, it is estimated that the amount of space debris will increase an ever-greater rate from now on,
and will eventually jeopardize near-Earth space activities."
This isn't meant for small debris but large ones like defunct satellites. Otherwise, I'm not sure what else you meant by nonsense.
Author mangled the explanation. The conductive net gets acted on by the Earth's magnetic field, slowly dragging the debris down, i.e.: a [electrodynamic tether]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrodynamic_tether) in net form. In addition to building the actual nets, JAXA hope to have a satellite that can attach these nets to debris with a robotic arm. Last time I saw this project, they've already been working on it for quite a few years.

Edit: Ok, after looking it up, I see that the use of the word "net" was wrong. It's not a net in space like we'd usually imagine, it's a tether that attaches one small satellite to a big satellite. The tether itself is made of an aluminum *mesh* reinforced with other fibers, I imagine that's where the "net" came from. Source from the research paper: http://debrixgroup.com/cdn/uploads/2012/09/space-debris-removal-system.pdf
The [Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_measurement_unit) tells the astronauts where the spacecraft is pointing and how fast it's going. The IMU can get stuck if the spacecraft moves too suddenly. When it gets stuck, the astronauts have to reset it and tell it what it should be reading before they can use it again.

non-ELI5 version: Check out section 4. Emergency and Abort Situations in the IMU documentation: http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/e-1344.htm They're doing a coarse alignment of the IMU by comparing the spacecraft's position to the Moon or Earth.

Should note that there's several IMU alignments during a normal flight, so the pic could be just normal procedure. If somebody can make out what the note says, it probably tells us.

I'm not sure what situation would prevent the rock tip from exiting the hole it just made?

The Apollo LRV's mesh design is to increase grip on the dusty lunar surface (very light rover and low gravity, a lot less friction to work with already). There's nothing inside the mesh except the hub housing, pic: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lunar_Roving_Vehicle_wheel_close-up.JPG
[Obligatory](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18PbWyH6nqI).
Economics exists because of the scarcity problem. What Roddenberry envisioned was the amelioration of scarcity through the advancement of technology and human nature. E.g.: In the Trek universe, technology solves the production problem, allowing pretty much universal access to food, medicine, shelter, and other human material needs (in the Federation anyways). A more enlightened human nature solves the greed problem, reducing human wants.

With the scarcity problem vastly reduced, economy becomes much less important. Hence why we see so little of it.

At least, this is the explanation I like best.
> What was the advantage besides re-usability?

It regularly carried a crew of 7 to space, compare to now when we're limited to 3 per Soyuz launch and 6 total on the ISS. It's the crew capacity plus the massive cargo carrying capacity of the Shuttle that made it unique.

For example, as an orbital construction platform, the Shuttle's capabilities is unmatched, nothing we've got now or in development can replace it. The ISS couldn't have been built without it (module assembly, truss construction, solar panel deployment, etc). Hubble wouldn't have lasted this long (would've been a complete failure, in fact). You probably have seen that [picture of an astronaut holding a "For Sale"](http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_50.html) sign. On that mission, the Shuttle retrieved 2 failed satellites from orbit back to Earth. We gave up a lot of space faring capability when the Shuttle was retired.

Yep, those suits are only meant to protect the shuttle astronauts during ascent and descent in case the cabin depressurizes. The orange is meant for easy visual detection on Earth, e.g.: in case the crew had to bail over the ocean. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Crew_Escape_Suit
Great, now we need a picture of it dunked in a cup of water, for... err... science
Ok, you're right, it looks like they added a system that will try to upgrade incompatible saves. My information is outdated.
The 0.21 supernova, yeah. The only thing he could've kept from 0.20 is the .craft files, all persistence is wiped out. 
You know, that could've been a factor too. I'm aware of at least one other reason, which I [outlined in another reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/1sh7bs/why_do_starships_always_fly_sideways_around/cdyp07a).
Next time you see a rocket launch into space, make note of its flight path. You'll see that the rocket will go straight up for a bit and then slowly turn parallel to the ground. This is called a [gravity turn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_turn) and you can see it in the rocket trail: [non-shuttle example](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap120902.html). Space craft enter orbit in this ground parallel orientation and will also perform orbital maneuvers in the same orientation (for common orbits). If you want to develop a better intuition for orbits, I'd suggest playing some [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/), there's a nice community over at /r/KerbalSpaceProgram 

Also, there's a reason that the space shuttle flies with its cargo bay towards the Earth. Heat buildup is actually a major problem in space since vacuum is a very good insulator. The shuttle has radiators designed to dissipate heat built into its cargo bay doors. The radiators are exposed when the bay doors open. Once in orbit, the shuttle flips over to let the thermal tiles on its belly block off heat from the Sun and then open the bay doors to vent excess heat into it's own shadow.

Another interesting thing is that the shuttle flies tail first. They used to fly in the traditional nose first orientation but found that small debris particles were hitting with enough force to crack or chip the windows. So for safety reasons, they fly tail first, the main shuttle engines are useless once in orbit and can be spared to absorb the hits.
Actually, it's how real space ships fly too. Efficient orbital maneuvers don't involve thrusting "up" against the force of gravity but "sideways" as you put it. One of the most common (and simplest) maneuvers is called a [Hohmann transfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit) and it involves two "sideways" burns. A Hohmann transfer is basically what the Apollo missions used to get to the Moon. Yes, it's counter intuitive, but it's literally rocket science, what do you expect.
With drones--- oh wait.
Yep, and HN for forward/backwards. The advantage with the RCS translation keys is that you don't have to toggle to docking mode to use them, so you still have the regular WASD pitch/yaw controls, which makes it much less clumsy, imo.
> The delivery system is likely the biggest part of the cost

The article says that the $1.5 million includes the cost of research. The research project is actually the biggest part of the cost. 

It's not just a one time drop, this is the 4th time they've done this. Some of the mice are also implanted with a radio tag, which lets researchers go into the jungle later and collect the (hopefully) dead snakes for analysis. 

All this helps scientists determine the effectiveness of the drop, with an eye toward making sure that it's actually controlling the tree snake population, it isn't harming other wildlife, and to find the most effective way to deploy this over a large area. They're also working on replacing the mice baits (which will eventually decompose, attract insects) with a non-biological alternative that should be longer lasting.
Double/triple docks can be an easy way to make sure that the modules are rotated correctly with respect to each other. Solar panels don't look as nice if each module sticks theirs out at a different angle.
You know, this kinda looks like if Kairosoft made a game based on Comiket. I want to play something like that now.
> Also driver support from a lot of hardware companies is nonexistent.

Official support, yes. But the open source community has spent tremendous effort reverse engineering all types of hardware over the years. The result is a huge suite of open source drivers. Personally, I haven't encountered any completely unsupported pc hardware for a few years. I've done many hardware migrations simply by swapping hard drives and it all worked out of the box.
Poor *open source* driver support, it should be specified. The closed source nVidia drivers has good support, much better than AMD's for years.
Winter in the header. Summer in the footer (with images inverted).
Agreed. In practice, "good code doesn't need comments" rarely works because there's a faulty assumption that the skill level of the reader is on par with the writer. What an expert considers to be clear is probably going to be opaque to a less advanced reader. And vice versa. You inevitably forget the finer points of a platform or language over time when they aren't being used, especially in a multiplatform/multilanguage environment. So I try to write comments for an amnesiac future me.
Since you're just starting off, I'd also suggest looking at other people's replays on YouTube for examples of what you're supposed to be doing, here is a very nice one for EoSD: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtmU6aucro8

You can see how you're supposed to make stages easier by killing off fairies in a certain order before they fire. You can see how to exploit patterns in the spell cards, if any exists. The only thing it doesn't teach is when to bomb and how to dodge random patterns. Those you can only learn by experience.
I'm a science enthusiast myself, but I'm disappointed by the supposed pro-science posts here. Being insulting is hardly the most effective way to convince people of your viewpoints. Phil Plait has a great talk about it: [don't be a dick](http://vimeo.com/13704095).
Really sorry for the late reply!

>  I believe it's true that there is often a significant lag time in temperature as CO2 goes up?

Temperature starts rising before CO2, yes. We know that variations in Earth's orbit changes the amount of energy received from the Sun. These variations are relatively small in the scale of things, but they kick off a complex chain reaction that we don't fully understand yet. It goes like this: Say we're in an ice age and Earth's orbit changes. We get a bit more sunlight and the Earth warms up a bit. This warming is enough to set off natural processes that releases a bit of CO2. This extra bit of CO2 traps a bit more heat on Earth, raising the temperature a little bit too. This then causes more CO2 to be released and repeats, establishing a positive feedback cycle. CO2 didn't initiate the warming process, it just amplifies it. Most of the temperature increase we see in the climate records occurs *after* CO2 starts rising.

This is a simplified view, there are other processes at play too, such as ice cover and vegetation. In the past, these other processes eventually reins back the CO2 increase and reaches a sort of equilibrium. Until the Earth's orbit changes again, initiating a reverse process into an ice age.

> And there are also other factors such as ENSO and PDO cycles that can complicate the CO2/temperature relationship.

These complicate the picture for more recent records, but not really for the pre-historic ice/sediment/fossil/etc records. The resolution on them unfortunately isn't high enough for effects on small time scales to be effectively picked out.
No worries, the technique you outlined is actually used to tell us about what the climate is like hundreds of millions of years ago. Sedimentary deposits, ice cores, etc. only goes so far back in time and the further back we go, the less reliable and more fragmented these records become. Climate modeling, involving all the variables we've identified so far (CO2 being one of them), gives us a a more continuous picture further into the past.

The tautology arises only if you don't know for sure yet whether CO2 is a major contributor to temperature changes. This relationship must be independently verified as a long term trend before you can use it as a basis to reconstruct ancient temperature records. Hence why the early climate scientists went looking for other temperature proxies.

Edit: Actually, I misunderstood your post a bit. Tell me if I'm still getting it wrong: you're looking for why we're sure of the temperature and isotopic ratios relationship even though it's also a 'recent' discovery? 

The key here is that they used *stable* isotopes. Their standard ratio on Earth, or even in the solar system, is guaranteed short of a very close by star going nova. We'd have to rewrite our understanding of chemistry and physics significantly if stable isotopes change their expected properties/behaviour over time.
You're right, it is a bit tautological. Fortunately, CO2 concentration isn't what the scientists used to reconstruct temperature records from ice cores. Please see the [posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1qovsz/how_do_climate_scientists_make_measurements_of/cdf1fhg) by /u/7LeagueBoots and /u/LeCurtois on how the ratio of stable oxygen isotopes change according to temperature. The ratio of oxygen isotopes in the ice itself is one way that we reconstruct ancient climate.

Carbon isotopes from fossils in the ocean sediment can also be [used in the same way](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_carbon#Paleoclimate). 

Isotope based proxies isn't limited to only temperature, they can tell us about other conditions such as the amount of solar radiation. Note that there are other things trapped in the ice as well, e.g.: dust carried by the wind from other areas or ashes from a volcanic eruption.
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) publishes specifications that determines how browsers handle web pages (how it looks, how users can interact with it, etc). IE, especially IE6, has a long and notorious history of breaking and ignoring these standards. Working around these IE bugs was a rage inducing experience shared by all web developers at one time. Luckily, things have improved a lot now. But I still hold a grudge.
There's also a W3C Exam Tips book on the desk, which she obviously hasn't used much.

If would definitely not be something that the space agencies would risk. The ejected debris might not pose a threat to the ISS itself, but it could still hit other satellites or vehicles in similar/lower orbits, potentially creating even more debris. Regular trips to the ISS would be in jeopardy as you'd have to risk going through a debris cloud first to reach it.

> "They wanted to fly years ago and faced a lot of obstacles, but he's a brave entrepreneur and I hope he succeeds. The more people who can see the world this way, the better off we are."

Far better Hadfield quote from the article. Can't really blame the guy for saying it's not much of a space flight. I mean, you probably wouldn't be satisfied with suborbital flights either if you've already spent months in space.
> As the article stated, much of the alumni donations that UBC receives are from past athletes, not Rec Quidditch players. 

And the question to be asked here is *why* do they do that? Is it perhaps because they feel a deeper sense of obligation and connection to the university because the university supported them in their endeavours? Then it stands to reason that expanding the athletic support of the university to more students would increase donations, not decrease it.

> Having the varsity sports that are currently threatened help give the university its identity, and attract students from all over the world.

As a former international student, I have to argue that the university attracts students (and advertises) on the basis of its strength in academics and research. Sports really isn't a factor.

> It also provides the infrastructure that allows UBC to rent out facilities to other groups, events and outside interests (hello, Olympics). It also brings in sponsorship money and is also big for the community aspect. Not to mention the employment opportunities it provides for many students and people in Vancouver as well.

And these other sports don't need facilities? Are they anti-social and don't give a sense of community? Why are these other sports somehow exempt from all the requirements and benefits that comes from organizing and bringing people together for sports?

Restricting root access is one of the last layer of security in a Linux system, it's more about limiting the amount of damage done after an account has been compromised. I must stress that if an attacker has gotten this far, you are already in serious trouble. Damage is pretty much guaranteed, you're just hoping that it's contained and not widespread.

To give a simple example, let's say you visit a hacked site that used a vulnerability in your browser to run malicious code. This piece of code can be totally destructive to your account because it's got all your permissions. But it won't be able to, say, access another user's home folder or hide itself as a rootkit or write itself into your motherboard's bios (so it can come back even after you reformat your computer). Or disable your firewall (if you're running one), so it can start sending out viagra spam. Or silently eavesdrop on other computers in your local network. 

Root access safeguards more than just the package manager. I'd suggest learning some basic command line and just create a command or script that installs all your programs for you (see /u/MadPhatFishKiller's comment for an example).



I'd say there's a couple of factors, not least of which is that Chris had tech savvy sons [who introduced him to social media](http://www.citynews.ca/2013/05/15/astronaut-chris-hadfields-sons-pushed-him-to-social-media-stardom/) and helped him keep up with the huge amount of responses he got. How many of you had to teach your parents how to internet? I'd guess that most astronauts are in the same pre-internet generation.

Plus, the ISS only got internet [3 years ago](http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/jan/HQ_M10-011_Hawaii221169.html), so it wasn't possible before then.

There could be a political reason too, I've heard that NASA keeps a tighter rein on their astronaut's public communication for PR reasons, Chris was CSA, so wasn't affected.

His personality and ability to communicate sold the rest of it.
I'm thinking human transmutation.

But seriously, we're looking at the result of intensive treatment by the doctors, which doesn't necessarily reflect the nature of the original injury.
Yeah, cheers for Teksavvy. I couldn't switch fast enough after the UBB mess.
Yeah, and letting Verizon in would be unfair competition! We already have cheaper prices than the US anyway! ...oh, Verizon's not coming? *raise prices again*
A while back, they tried to force a 25 GB / month cap ($2/GB if you went over) on everyone through something they called [Usage Based Billing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_in_Canada#Usage-based_billing_.28UBB.29). Public outrage stopped lowering the cap that outrageously, but didn't stop the big 3 from "refreshing" their offerings with half of the cap they offered before. Internet service here *deteriorates* over time.
As a Canadian, I apologize in advance for our terrible ISPs and their lack of internet infrastructure investments.
> I am not ignoring NASA's contributions to robotics.
> I was saying give NASA's SLS money to DARPA.

This begs the question of why money has to be moved out of NASA if NASA already has the same expertise (i.e.: if we cancel the SLS in favor of robotics, why isn't NASA the one to work on the new project?). You need to defend why you think NASA isn't up to it but DARPA is.

> If you're moving about slowly to gather data, Curiosity's 14 minute latency is fine. But if you're building infrastructure, it's not. 

I can't see what makes these two problems so different? Both requires the same high degree of autonomous operation. And Curiosity's stately pace can be contrasted with high speed missions such as Deep Impact's mission to smash open a comet, the entire operation had to be computer controlled at the scene cause the comet was too small for ground controllers to prepare instructions at the precision required.
Sorry, my post was about the blog post that /u/AlanUsingReddit linked, which was about the diverting money from NASA to DARPA to develop better robots in space. So the part about radiation protection was for machines rather than humans.
Not only the money, but significant amounts of know-how. Commercial development in space is great, but let's not forget that it was NASA that blazed the trail for them. Without NASA taming the unknown, vastly reducing the risk of going to space, there'd be no private space industry right now.
I think the author is being extremely ironic in ignoring the fact that the space program invented telerobotics and would in fact be the best at developing the robots required to harvest non-terrestrial fuel sources. Now, DARPA makes some cool stuff, but it's not like NASA doesn't have the same expertise in robotics.

E.g.:

> To mine these would take working in extreme temperatures, vacuum and radiation.

* NASA's business is operating in a vacuum so perfect that it can't be recreated on Earth. 
* Temperature extremes? They've sent probes next to the Sun. There's probes out far past Pluto. Yeah, they know temperature extremes.
* They know radiation, having to operate outside of the protective envelope of Earth's magnetic field or inside of Jupiter's harsh radiation belt.

> Workers operating lunar telerobots from earth's surface would suffer a 3-second light lag latency. A 3 second reaction time is a big disadvantage in a mining work environment. Some things that might mitigate a slow reaction time are collision avoidance and balance. And DARPA has helped with both of these.

3 seconds is a big deal? That's real-time for NASA. The Curiosity rover has a *14 minute* round trip delay when operated from Earth. Multi-hour delays is a normal daily operation for NASA!
I've met a few laptops with similar symptoms back when nvidia used [bad solder on a whole series of chips]( http://m.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1004378/why-nvidia-chips-defective). The chips basically desolder themselves through thermal cycling. Applying heat reflows the solder and fixes it temporarily.
I'd argue that learning syntax is indeed easy (for experts), but you are also correct in that syntax and programming needs to be taught hand in hand (for beginners). It takes experience to develop a syntax independent mental model of programming. After a while, you gain the ability to just pick up a language on the fly, even the quirks and oddities get generalized. Unless it's something really exotic like Prolog. I'd guess that using Racket in first year and then Java in second year is meant to speed up this process, helped along by the sharp syntax differences between the two languages.

Programming languages are actually very simple compared to natural languages like French and English. By definition, a programming language has to be amenable to computer parsing, this places a lot of restrictions on grammar. These restrictions are formally defined as something called [context-free grammar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar). Practically all programming languages follow CFG or stricter. Natural language, on the other hand, has thus far escaped all attempts at formalization.
Nano desu!

Hey, Asians are interchangeable in Hollywood apparently. Garrett Wang tells a funny story at cons of how he found out that Voyager's writers wrote Harry Kim as a Chinese character when he'd always assumed that the name Kim means Harry was Korean. And in the JJverse John Cho, a Korean, plays the Japanese Sulu.
I am a kickstarter backer who actually got one of the kits. There's a lot of problems with the parts that came with the kits, half of the frame assembly parts didn't have proper fit, the hotend is an ancient J-Head Mk 1, and the extruder motor has heat issues. The assembly instruction videos were also poorly organized, full of backtracking that requires you to watch the entire thing through before assembly. And you keep having to splice wires. Ah, and the hotbed has trouble reaching the temperature required for ABS (100+ C) without serious insulation and lots of waiting.

On the design side, there's a serious flaw in the z-axis. The entire weight of the print bed gets loaded onto the z-axis threaded rod, which is sitting on the bottom z-axis motor. This compression will slowly bend the threaded rod until it's not true anymore and cause the bed to get stuck on z movements.
Nah, Curiosity's moving because it's a JPL project. JPL didn't get furloughed because even though it's federally funded, it's managed and operated by Caltech, a private university. When they realized that a government shutdown might be coming, they delayed projects and scrimped where they could to stockpile some funds just in case. They're tapping that fund now to keep normal operations going.
Computer science is pretty much entirely software and theory focused (I joke that we just assume the hardware works). You won't learn how to put electronic components together. Computer Engineering with the software option is sort of half/half and is probably what you want. On the software side, they learn roughly the same things as CPSC year 2, and get to choose a few year 3-4 CPSC electives if they want. Don't know what the hardware side is like.

Note that due to the engineering standard time tables, there's much less freedom in choosing electives, so satisfying pre-reqs for electives can be a problem.

Should also note that while EECE students can take most CPSC courses as electives (if they meet the prereqs), CPSC students can't take most EECE courses as they're restricted to EECE students only.
Haha, I'll remember that next time:

Good news everyone! We learned we were wrong!
It's ok, science still benefits from the results. They predicted that they'd be able to achieve ignition but didn't, this can actually be very exciting! In science, barring experimental error, you learn far more when predictions fail to match reality. Something new and unexpected is happening, just waiting for us to figure out why.
Is there a concentrated pile of dead bodies in the scene? I've noticed that a clump of living troop doesn't lag, but the non-living ones causes lag spikes.
Well... The population growth of Earth is stuck on one planet while the off-Earth humans have to fill an entire galaxy. The Goa'uld doesn't exactly treat their slaves well and primitive technology isn't going to do wonders for the population growth rate. For comparison, it took all of the 19th century and more to add 1 billion to Earth's population while technological developments in the 20th century allowed us to add 5 billion in less than a decade. ([source](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-15459643)) 

For the races that are more advanced than Earth, I'm gonna go with the trend that high standards of living causes the birth rates to drop ([TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_on_global_population_growth.html)).
If you talk to the scientists, they will use the less ambiguous term "heliosphere" instead of solar system ([example from the Voyager team's AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1m9wke/were_scientists_and_engineers_on_nasas_voyager/cc765i7)). The heliosphere is defined as the region of space where particles from the Sun dominates. So Voyager 1 is currently surrounded by interstellar gas, instead of particles from the Sun.

And there were so many articles about Voyager 1 leaving the solar system cause that's just how every milestone gets reported. Passing Pluto? *Left the solar system.* Passing the Kuiper belt? *Left the solar system.* Entering the heliopause? *Left the solar system.* Might have left the heliopause but we're not really sure yet? *Left the solar system!*

The definitive proof that Voyager 1 has left the heliosphere only came recently, after a solar flare stirred up the interstellar soup a bit giving Voyager's instruments a better look at the composition.
Didn't see anyone else try it this way, so decided to try it myself. It works well, just as convenient as regular RCS in terms of the translation ability, too lazy to build a station with it though.
It is, there's just a slight wobbling to it called [libration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libration), so you see slightly different halves of the Moon at different times. Nice [gif animation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lunar_libration_with_phase_Oct_2007_450px.gif) to show this.

In any case, monstereddit was talking about a Moon to space elevator which Mecha-Dave seems to have mistaken as a Moon to Earth elevator. A Moon to space elevator wouldn't care which side of the Earth it faces.
Same thing happened to me as Rome. The AI might be judging the balance of forces by adding up every single one of your enemies vs you and your allies (if any). By that factor, there's no way your forces alone can match theirs, hence their stubbornness.

So I restarted with a more heavy military focus. To reduce the impact on the economy, I parked my armies and navies next to the neighbour's cities in raiding mode to avoid paying 50% of the upkeep. If they were going to declare war on me anyways, making them pissed off won't matter, right? Well, now they're all REALLY pissed at me but won't declare war, go figure.
Yes, this is why the Mars rovers hang around craters so much. Curiosity's landing site is thought to be a 3.5-3.8 billion year old crater that was slowly filled by sediment over time and then eroded by wind, exposing the layered sediment. There's a 5 km tall mountain in the center of the crater that the rover will slowly try to climb, studying each layer as it goes. Scientists estimate that the layers expose about 2 billion years of history.

Time, Quality, Cost. Pick two.

Publishers mandate the time and the cost. Developers try to do the best they can for quality. TW games are pretty much two games (TBS + RTS) in one too, doubling the scope and difficulty.
> I don't expect them to have a bad product at release!

Experience enough TW games at release and you will. It's been a trend that there's always a ton of bugs at release which takes at least a couple of months to fully iron out. Compared to the release of Rome/Empire/Shogun 2, at least Rome 2 hasn't crashed to desktop on me. The weekly patches are great compared to how long we had to wait previously. I fully expect Rome 2 will grow into a much better game than the original eventually
The thing is, the big 3 *don't need* the 700 MHz spectrum being sold. They've got the 800 MHz band all to themselves whereas newcomers (not only Verizon, including Wind, etc) desperately needs lower frequency bands. It's actually not fair for the big 3 to get any bidding rights at all.
This is CA we're talking about, I don't think we'll get a stable game without another few months of patches.

> How much does not having experience with extracurricular projects hurt one's chance of getting admitted into comp sci coop?

It won't really hurt. Most people don't have any experience either. But you *should* get some extracurricular projects, it'll vastly increase your chance of actually getting a job once you're in the program.

> Also, what is the optimal academic average( in terms of percentage)?

The minimum to apply to co-op is something like 65-70%. Keep in mind though, when you apply to jobs, you send your transcript along, so employers can make judgements based on them.

Just be open and friendly. The interview is more for your coordinator to get to know you. It gives them an idea of your employability weaknesses so they can advise you on how to make yourself more appealing to employers.

To add to what everyone else has already said, what you were taught is incomplete. Yes, a mechanical wave like sound requires a medium for energy propagation. But an electromagnetic wave, such as light, does not require a medium for propagation. What a medium can do though for electromagnetic waves is slow them down.
No, that's not what I meant. Of course things might be different if he *knew* for sure that the destruction of the Federation would be the result. But there is no way he could've known how the future would play out. So he would've made his decision to uphold principles with the conviction that it would bring out the best results in the long run. And he would've been right.
I object to that because none of those actions would've caused a peaceful end to the war. Remember, even if the Dominion had been defeated in the Alpha Quadrant, there's still a soup of genocidal Founders in the Beta Quadrant who would've ordered the destruction of the Alpha Quadrant with their last dying breath. It might take decades, but eventually, the Dominion would be back and the second Dominion War would be even more bloody than the first.
That isn't the only reason he decloaked in front of the Romulans. It was important and necessary to demonstrate to the Romulans that not everyone in the Federation is untrustworthy. Working under the assumption that the Romulans would've eventually discovered the cloak through other means, it was the best diplomatic gesture he could've made under the circumstances.
Of course. And Picard would be *right* to do so. In the end, it wasn't the manipulations of Section 31 that ended the war, but the ideals of the Federation. If the Founders hadn't been convinced that peaceful existence with the Federation was possible, the war would've been fought to the last Jem'hadar.
The problem is that they can somehow tell whether 2 passwords are similar to each other. One of the properties of cryptographic hashes is that even a 1-bit difference should produce widely different outputs. There is no way to know whether 2 passwords are similar from their secure hashes.

Canada has a [90-day visa waiver](http://www.roc-taiwan.org/CA/ct.asp?xItem=188573&ctNode=150&mp=77) program with Taiwan, so technically yes, you can enter (and leave) with your Canadian passport.

Because you are quoting tired old long debunked anti-vaccine arguments. Arguments that are particularly insidious because they rely on a kernel of truth to sound plausible while being fundamentally flawed.

> The reason vaccinated diseases aren't killing millions isn't solely because of vaccines -- most of these diseases were in significant declines for decades (or centuries) before the vaccines were introduced. But the simplistic agenda is to say "before vaccines" and "after vaccines"... what they don't show is "way before vaccines" these diseases had massive drops. Of course few would argue that vaccines have not been valuable. But they are not preventing us from massive disease.

The data that says the death rate declined before the introduction of vaccines is real. But you cannot assume that it means diseases have less ability to 'take hold in modern times' from that. The number of people killed by a disease is not the same as the *number of people infected*. Yes, the death rate went down due to modern advancements in medicine and standards of living that lets us keep people alive even when they're sick. But the rate of *infection* remained the same. It's only after the introduction of vaccines that infection cases went down and we were able to wipe out diseases such as smallpox, measles, etc.

The CDC has a good section on this, with examples of diseases resurfacing when vaccination rates drop: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/6mishome.htm#Diseaseshadalready

Vaccinable diseases are still as virulent and contagious in modern times as a century ago. And it's only vaccines that are holding them back.
You could get into orbit from the first public alpha, I think? At least, I remember seeing some. Problem was, no one knew how high the atmosphere was and there was no map view with path projection so getting into orbit took a lot of guesswork. There was also no time warp so the only way to verify that you've achieved a stable orbit was to leave ksp running for a few hours and come back to check if you've crashed.
He meant the other way around, more likely. In an emergency, they can resort to using sea water as a coolant.
To be fair, if we're talking about the time of the Maxis acquisition, EA wasn't completely irredeemable in the 90s like they are now. They were actually great publishers for a while back in those days. But I wouldn't say Maxis hasn't been affected by EA's fall to evil, most obvious of them being the terminal case of sequel-itis.
"(He) always explode with laughter". Been years since I did latin though.

Not consistently, but I've seen channels push a few million concurrent during live news coverages. E.g.: NASA TV had a ton of people during that whole Russian meteor explosion and close pass of asteroid DA14.
Crysis 3 tech demo shows off the eye candy pretty well: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HW_gyF69Xto
There's a few in development. NASA is building a [spacecraft](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/tdm/green/gpim_overview.html) to test one out in 2015. The ESA has [another alternative](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Technology/Green_satellite_fuel_designed_to_make_space_safer) that they've already test flown and are working on [higher powered](http://www.sscspace.com/capabilities-3) versions. 
You mean unplanned rapid disassemblies aren't normal? That's strange...

Nah, I did notice that, but the idea of "controlled explosions" is a common way of describing rockets anyways. It's really pretty accurate considering that the difference between what goes on in a rocket engine and a detonation is just a slightly slower reaction rate.

Edit: You deleted your reply to this post when I typing up mine, so I'm putting this here.

A [detonation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detonate) involves the release of a supersonic exothermic front which creates a supersonic shockwave.

A [deflagration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflagration) is its subsonic counterpart.

Both terms describe an energy release, but does not specify where the energy comes from. The energy can be provided from various sources, whether it be mechanical, chemical, or nuclear.

[Combustion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combustion) is a type of chemical reaction that releases energy.

Thus, a combustion reaction can result in a detonation or a deflagration.

Note the difference between detonations (supersonic) and deflagrations (subsonic). Subsonic spans a long range, from a match being slowly consumed to just barely below the speed of sound. Rocket engines combustion chambers might maintain a deflagration reaction, but it's at the upper range and the product is soon accelerated to supersonic speeds by the nozzle. There are even engine designs that delibrately produce [detonations in the combustion chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_detonation_engine).
Explosive, in this case. The ATV uses [monomethylhydrazine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomethylhydrazine) fuel and [dinitrogen tetroxide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinitrogen_tetroxide) oxidzer. These paired together are what's called a [hypergolic propellant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergolic_propellant), which is basically just two liquids that spontaneously ignites when mixed.

Spec sheet on the ATV thrusters: http://cs.astrium.eads.net/sp/spacecraft-propulsion/bipropellant-thrusters/220n-atv-thrusters.html

Most small maneuvering thrusters like these are similar in that they're powered by some form of extremely exothermic [hydrazine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrazine) reaction to produce very hot gases. Hydrazine happens to be extremely toxic, making it quite costly to handle, so people have been trying to find cheaper & safer alternatives to it. The problem is that hydrazine has good performance otherwise, you get a lot of thrust for very little fuel and storage once in space is easy.
Yep, it's true. Some of them just use various hacks (e.g. custom driver you have to install) though, which can have compatibility issues. Haven't seen very many models that does it properly by using a high speed USB chip.

Just to clear up any confusion... :x

One of the major concerns before the Ares I's first test flight was that its first stage solid rocket booster could produce vibrations so severe that astronauts won't be able to safely ride it. After the test flight, the data seems to indicate that the actual vibrations were comparable to what a shuttle launch experiences, not that it matters now. 
Haha, my old laptop didn't let me bomb. It kinda turned out to be pretty good training, in retrospect.
That's one possible effect, the other is blocking:

Ghosting is when you press multiple keys and some other key show up instead.

Blocking is when you press multiple keys and they don't register.
Keyboard manufacturers try to save cost by removing components that let you press multiple keys at the same time. It sounds like you have a particularly bad example of such practices. The number of keys you can press at the same time is called [rollover](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollover_%28key%29). The best keyboards feature n-key rollover (abbrv: NKRO), which means that all keypresses are detected correctly. Practically though, it's limited to 6 key rollover if connected by USB.
When you see some... odd color choices, just know that the director for TAS was color blind and no one told him
Just to clear up any confusion, the [Ares V](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares_V) model used by STID was *technically* cancelled. But NASA ended up just recyling the same design for the [Space Launch System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System) pictured. The difference being that while the Ares V was originally only meant to be an unmanned heavy cargo launcher, the SLS will be rated for human spaceflight. 

Ares V had a smaller counterpart (also cancelled), the [Ares I](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares_I), which was dedicated to human spaceflight. The SLS basically ended up being the combination of the capabilities of Ares I and Ares V into one vehicle.

This doesn't fit the publication years you gave, but I think it matches your description of the story better: http://memory-beta.wikia.com/wiki/Triptych

It's a short story in one of the Strange New Worlds collections. Kirk & Spock fails their mission the first time, prompting the rest of his crew stranded back with the Guardian to step through themselves and try again.
Err, that tooltip comes by default when you set the flair text, no need to play around with the CSS. Setting the flair text inserts a title attribute to the flair span and the title attribute is interpreted by browsers as a hover tooltip. The CSS you were playing with was for showing text next to the flair.
I fixed it. But had to replace the spritesheet to add horizontal spacing between the characters. It was showing the next character over instead of the text otherwise. Looks like everyone's flair changed, oops.

Seems a bit jumpy to me since the expanded flair displaces so much text. Might want to just stick with the tool tip hover or move the flair position again.
> I'm not talking about post-launch DLCs.
> I'm saying that in order to get maximum launch-day purchases, pre-order bonuses help.

I'm saying that pre-order bonuses don't mean anything partially *because of* post-launch DLCs. You're going to get the exact same content as the pre-orders *plus* all the post-launch DLCs if you buy later and at a fraction of the cost.

The actual effective way to increase pre-orders, and just plain orders in general, is to establish a relationship of trust and integrity with your community. A pre-order is a promise that you can deliver an awesome experience. We trust and want to support those companies who live up to their promises. That trust is why I preordered. Because they've delivered in the past and so I want to support CA. *Not* because of the bonuses. Hell, I didn't even know what the bonuses are.

> Also, why would someone who wants to play Rome 2 Total War wait a year to get it for 75% off?

That person hasn't even touched half of their Steam library. There are literally dozens of other games he wants to play too. Rome 2 can wait. Digital distribution has overwhelmed us with so much choice that it pretty much *requires* that you postpone purchases or your consumption will never keep up.

And, speaking as someone who has followed CA for a long time, TW games has had a long history of being very buggy at launch. I always wait for at least a few months worth of patches before settling down to play anyways.
> Companies need to offer incentive to pre-order the game

Yes, but only back in the dark ages of brick and mortar stores. That statement is completely void now in the age of digital distribution. The argument actually overwhelmingly favours waiting to pre-ordering on Steam: Wait a year, and you can get the game + all the DLCs for 75% off in a Steam sale. Paid DLCs are in fact a serious disincentive to pre-ordering digitally. Why would you want to pay more to get less?

> Soviet orbiters weren't part of the story. 

You've got time line a bit muddled, as The_Alaskan mentioned in another reply, Luna 15, the failed mission you mentioned, was in orbit when the Apollo 11 crew arrived and was still there during 11's landing. The Russians actually moved Luna 15's orbit to be closer to the Apollo landing site before commanding it to land (Armstrong and Aldrin had already walked on the Moon by then): http://lunarscience.nasa.gov/articles/previously-unheard-recording-of-luna-15-landing-released/

Yes, the best explanation I've encountered is that Cirno is a little play on words based on the English word "chilly". So, "Chilly-no", or "the chilly one"/"chilly girl".
> I agree completely, which is why I get pissed of at Al Gore who fails to do so, when he's trying to be a representative for climate science. It's the same as shitty news reporters that read the last sentence of a scientific journal and extrapolate whatever they want from it without considering uncertainty.

I have to agree that science reporting is in a sorry state. I just don't want people to think that there's no scientific validity to predictions/observations of rising sea levels.

> And ice takes up more volume than water does. And melting of the top of glaciers reduces their weight, which allows them to float a little higher. From what I remember of watching Inconvenient Truth, he was basically just ignoring variables that countered his conclusions and running with the ones that supported them. 

Sorry, I should've specified glaciers on land like in Greenland and Antarctica. Ice does take up more volume than water, but they float, so the actual amount of water they displace is equivalent to the weight of the water locked in the ice. This means that when floating ice melts, the sea level doesn't rise because the water is already accounted for. Only land bound glaciers (e.g.: Greenland) add more water to the ocean when they melt.

> Since you actually seem educated on the topic, how many reports actually extrapolate the extreme sea level rises that Al Gore presents? I'm not denying that sea levels change and that they can be predicted, but I think he was way off the mark on his predictions, especially in how quickly he was estimating them.

I don't know what sea level rises he was presenting, but you can compare it to this [image](http://books.nap.edu/books/12782/xhtml/images/p2001c3c5g251001.jpg) from a study in 2010 about the effects of rising sea levels on the US: [PDF warning](ftp://dossier.ogp.noaa.gov/NCASLR/Publications/WeissOverpeckStraussCCL2011SeaLevel.pdf). A 1 meter rise is the current prediction for 2100 (from a range of 0.5m to 2m). The 6 meter rise looks forward a few more centuries down the road that assumes continued melting of the Greenland & Antarctic ice sheets.

Disclaimer, not an expert, just took a course about climate science.
Climate scientists would be first ones to say that their climate models aren't perfect. There simply isn't enough computing power or data to model Earth's climate in detail. But this doesn't mean that climate models are useless, as they can still give accurate *generalizations* of long term trends.

Sea level prediction isn't as complicated as it seems. There's only 2 factors here, the amount of water and the temperature of the water (warmer water takes up more room due to thermal expansion).  Warmer temperatures cause higher sea levels by both adding more water from melting glaciers and raising the water temperature. You can take a good guess at future sea levels just by extrapolation from temperature.

The predictions are further improved by incorporating past sea level records. Satellites have provided almost global coverage of the oceans for the past 2 decades. Before that, human kept records go back for more than a century. And before that, various sources such as geological records can tell us about ancient sea levels.

Sea level predictions can and are made scientifically. The IPCC report has a [dedicated section on it](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch10s10-6.html).
> I do have one request. If you don't believe if the efficacy of vaccines, how do you explain the disappearance of polio and smallpox?

One argument I've seen is that they attribute it to modern advances in sanitation or improved nutrition. They even have graphs showing a decline in deaths from various diseases before the introduction of vaccines. This argument is particularly insidious because it sounds plausible and they used real data to back it up. 

The only problem is that it presents an incomplete picture. Note that the graphs they use chart the *death rate* specifically. This is misleading as the number of people who died from a disease is not the same as the *number of people who got sick* from a disease. The death rate went down due to modern advancements in medicine that lets us keep people alive even when they're sick. Improved sanitation and nutrition helps, but people were still getting sick. It's only after the introduction of vaccines that we were able to wipe out diseases such as smallpox, measles, etc.

The CDC has a good section on this, with examples of diseases resurfacing when vaccination rates drop: http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/6mishome.htm#Diseaseshadalready
I wrote a [rebuttal](http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/1dp6v8/antivaccination_fraud_health_officials_get_tough/c9sqe33) on the other post.
The article linked is an excellent example of why non-sense like anti-vaccination is so hard to stamp out. It gains authenticity by incorporating grains of truth and relies on the ignorance of the reader to gain traction. If you didn't know, in principle, how vaccination protection works, then it's very hard to gainsay the need to have studies of the effects on, e.g.: pregnant women.

From the article:

> Clinical trials with at-risk individuals, including infants, small children, pregnant mothers and people over 65 of age are not mandatory for regulatory approval. 

I don't know how accurate this is, but let's take it for true for now.

>So how do the vaccine makers determine whether or not a vaccine is safe for these at-risk groups? 

Easy. By not giving them the vaccine.

> Well, they don’t except by predicting past incidences of vaccine effectiveness and safety using mathematical models. 

Well, it's actually safe for them because they *didn't* get those vaccines, so there's no way to suffer ill effects from it. 

This is not to say they aren't protected from the disease. The disease protection conferred onto the non-vaccinated population comes from the fact that the people around them *did* get the vaccines. This is a key cornerstone of how vaccines work. It's impossible to vaccinate everyone, vaccines aren't 100% effective, some people may have medical reasons that make it unsafe, etc. But as long as everyone around them are vaccinated, **they're still protected**. There's no way for disease to be transmitted to a vulnerable person if everyone around them effectively 'kills' that disease on contact. And yes, this can be mathematically modeled. To suggest doubt in these mathematical models is to ignore the fact that these models have proven true since the start of vaccination campaigns.

This is called [herd immunity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity). As long as ~90% of the population are effectively vaccinated, those who aren't vaccinated are also protected.

Herd immunity is also what the anti-vaccination movement is destroying. To maintain the safety margin that protects the vulnerable who, for one reason or another, can't be vaccinated, we have to vaccinate *everyone* that can safely receive the shots. Those who refuse to vaccinate are hurting far more people than themselves.

> The vaccine industrial complex is under no federal obligation to give sound scientific evidence that their vaccines are safe in anyone except health adults.

This is just misleading. Since the H1N1 vaccine was meant only for healthy adults, of course that's where evidence is required. Just like if it was a vaccine meant for children, they're not going to study the effects of the vaccine on adults, they're going to study its effect on children. This is why there's vaccination time tables for kids, so that they're given vaccines when they've reached a safe age.
Err, well, guess what, that's where most of the flairs came from, lol.
Either your drivers or your monitor settings has it set so that it doesn't scale up lower resolutions to native resolution. If it's drivers and you have an nVidia card, use the ['Use NVIDIA scaling with fixed aspect ratio'](http://cowgod.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/nvidia_flat_panel_scaling.png) option. With an AMD card, [use enable 'Image Scaling' and set 'Maintain aspect ratio'](http://support.amd.com/PublishingImages/Support/GPU-68/gpuscaling3.jpg). Newer Intel integrated graphics have a similar option, but older ones don't.

If those options aren't available, then hopefully your monitor has those options, you'll have to fiddle around your monitor menus, looking for where they hid the damn things. On my Samsung monitor, it's Menu > Size & Position > Image Size > Image Size > Auto. 

If none of these options work, then you're out of luck, afaik.
Yeah, I thought you were talking about mod flairs. Give a yell if there's anything I can do to help with the coding.
To stop the downvotes, he means one of them isn't British.
Just stuff that doesn't happen often, (e.g. official news only happens a few times a year). But it could also be just stuff that mods feel is worth drawing attention to.
It means less work for the mods if the users just self-tag. Mods will have to commit time to tagging otherwise.

On the other hand, there's really no need to have a lot of tags yet. It's not like there's an overwhelming amount of content and people started demanding ways of filtering them (ala /r/starcraft style, which now has a really nice color coded link flair system as a result). I think just an official news/events flairs should be all that's needed right now. Instead of using the link flairs as an organizational tool like the large subreddits, it can be used to highlight rare content instead.
Any width is ok as long as it tiles nicely or blends off into a suitable background color.
Saw Ornithine's comment, it looks like RES adds a border and a bit of padding to the comment boxes, which means the flair's absolute position pixel values are off. 

I attempted 2 fixes, neither worked satisfactorily.

Attempt 1: Change the relative parent of the flairs to .noncollapsed, but it didn't work cause RES extended .noncollapsed to cover the voting arrows. 

Attempt 2: Put more white space between the arrows. It just looks a bit more spacious in standard reddit. In RES though, it doesn't fix the left offset and leaves a large white space below the flair but at least the flair isn't partially hiding the upvote arrow anymore. 

I also noticed that the flairs on some child posts don't get properly indented in standard reddit, no idea what causes that. I can't think of anything else to try right now, so putting aside the aesthetics, this idea is a no go at least for technical reasons.
It's best to look for stuff that's small to start with. Not much looks good at 32x32 pixels, lol. I converted some of them for an example: http://i.imgur.com/gImZ709.png

> http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1228491?tags=mononobe_no_futo+

These actually worked surprisingly well, probably cause the original size was around 128x128 pixels.

> http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/1003013?tags=mononobe_no_futo+

I knew these were too large, but did one as an example of how much detail is lost with large pics.

Might work with the proper crop.
I actually like the Sovereign nacelles. The Galaxy and Intrepid warp nacelles always made them feel lopsided, saucer heavy to me. 

Perhaps the large nacelles were necessary for sustained high warp travel. Neither the Galaxy nor the Intrepid classes can do a sustained cruise anywhere near their top speed. While the Enterprise-E was able to race at maximum warp from the Romulan border all the way to Earth to save it from the Borg.
I'm too lazy to look up the man pages nowadays, lol.
Just offering suggestions. I'm not that concerned either way.

Conventions offer consistency in UIs and most of reddit has inline flairs.

The flairs are only about 3em tall or so. The username line it's on already takes up about 1.2em. With the flairs center aligned vertically, it's just around 1em above and below, easily covered with a bit of tweaking the line-heights and padding. Increasing the white space like this can also make things look nicer by giving the impression of less clutter.
Try out [Phatch](http://photobatch.stani.be/) for simple batch photo processing such as flipping an image.
Ahh, +1, might as well follow convention anyways. We can add some padding around divs so the spacing issue doesn't stand out.

lol, full css makeover, gogogo?
lol, you're fast, I deleted my comment when I saw Imosa1 already replied. But yeah, if you take the both the CSS and spritesheet, it should work.
No worries, the actual CSS can be auto-generated and Imosa1 just has to set it up once. I meant the configuration step to get reddit aware of each flair, you have to enter each individually (and there's 109 of them) in 'edit flair' > 'user flair templates' tab, you can look at /r/touhoutest's configuration for an example.
Looks good! Get the other mods to enter the other 104 CSS classes. :P
yay, at least some people found it amusing!
Yeah, Patchcon was made before TD. Maybe we can find someone skilled enough to round out the rest.
Positive, 1 C or so.
If we allow 32x32 flairs, I think the [PatchCon](http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/PatchCon) sprites work out best: [spritesheet](http://c.thumbs.redditmedia.com/ntt-qSe3JffKvAYb.png). I've set up an example [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/touhoutest/).

I also tried out the Touhoumon sprites, but they seem to lose too much detail at 32x32: [spritesheet](http://i.imgur.com/h1Ezzdk.png).

It's not mentioned on film but it was written down in the script that the building where Spock reintegrated with his body was the "Hall of Ancient Thought". It's where the Vulcans keep their katras and consult with them when needed: http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Hall_of_Ancient_Thought

In some of the novel, they elaborated on the katra storage to say that eventually, the katras fade away.
Hard decisions? If sticking to your principles makes a task more difficult, isn't that a harder decision?

Sisko was a young commander and a complete unknown in the sector to all the major powers involved when he took command of DS9. Picard, on the other hand, has been on the fringes of Federation space throughout his entire captaincy. He has a *reputation* with the Romulans, the Klingons, and the Cardassians. As an honourable enemy, if nothing else. He and his crew has met and faced off many peoples of power on the other sides.

Take the Romulans for example. Picard's crew foiled many of the best plans laid by influential officers such as Tomalak and Sela. Yet, this same crew has, many times, rendered assistance to Romulan ships and crew, no questions asked. And remember when Picard refused to hide a breach of the Treaty of Algernon by revealing the existence of a Federation cloaking device? His actions has *earned him respect* from the Romulans. 

Picard has a proven right for his words to be taken at face value. He would be far more convincing in situations such as convincing the Romulans of the need for an alliance against the Dominions. Or, perhaps in convincing the Cardassians that an alliance with the Dominion will be to their detriment.

But it might not go that far. Remember when the Tal Shiar and the Obsidian Order tried to strike at the Founders? Picard's connections might have made him aware of it. And he'd be able to put a stop to it in such a way that it would open a serious dialogue with the Dominion. And by connections, I was thinking that involving Ambassador Spock and his dissident network on Romulus would make it an awesome episode.
I love this piece. It took my brain quite a while to pick up [Provincial Makai City Esoteria](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckETJHE6RPA) in the midst of all that [Sis puella magica](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTNQNkQCoXA).
Do you remember why the Dominion surrendered on Cardassia? It wasn't because a military victory by the Federation-led alliance was all but certain. The Jem'hadar were prepared to fight down to the last ship and to the last man. The Founder on the planet refused to call them off.

Until Odo linked with her. To convince her that the Federation is sincere in its pursuit for peace.

> Odo: Believe me, I'm well aware that the Federation has its flaws. But a desire for conquest isn't one of them.

> ...

> Founder: The Dominion has spent the last 2 years trying to destroy the Federation. And now you're asking me to put our fate in their hand?

> Odo: Yes.

> Founder: I can't do that Odo. I don't have your faith in the solids.

> Odo: Then perhaps I can change your mind. Link with me.

This is the true victory condition to aim for, fixing the unreasonable fear and hate that changelings have against the solids. Without this step, a state of war would've still existed with the Dominion even after a military victory. The Founder even agreed to stand trial for war crimes. Sisko and crew did it one way. I'm saying that Picard and crew would've arrived at the same conclusion but by a very different route.
The Romulans were crucial for a military victory. That isn't the only form of victory possible.
lol, I was going to say, either the Federation wins with Borg enhanced technology or advice from the future.
Honestly, I think Picard would've refused to sacrifice his conscience... but still make it all work out somehow. 

Kirk would've bluffed his way through Dominion space, all the way to the Founder's world, then get Spock to mind meld with them to prove the Federation's sincerity.
I'm gonna guess [glue](http://www.jbox.com/product/NET055).
I had to rewatch the episode, I think you've got a few details mixed up. It was Riker, Troi, and Crusher on the planet who conducted the initial negotiation and refused to trade the children. Picard was still on the ship. Dr. Crusher did offer to help and Riker was just starting to offer other forms of help when the Aldeans rudely cut them off by beaming them them back to the Enterprise. The Aldeans has probably already prejudged the Federation as too primitive to help them except by donating children.

Honestly, the Aldeans gave Picard enough reasons to be distrustful of them. They beamed 3 members of the bridge crew to their planet, without consulting, then proceeded to perform an invasive scan of the Enterprise, casually disabling the Enterprise's shields. Then kidnapped the children, with no word to him until it was all done. 

>Riker: "You're certain they'll negotiate?"

>Picard: "Oh, they'll negotiate. Or they'll call it that. They've taken what they want! Now they'll rationalize it by throwing us some sort of a bone."

>Riker: "And when we don't accept their offer?"

>Picard: "The minute that they believe that we won't accept their compensation for the children, they'll break off the discussion, they'll disappear behind their shield... locking us out and the children in. Forever."

Given that the Aldeans have already proven that they'll just do whatever they want, I agree with Picard's reasoning.

> Why is there no discussion of perhaps funneling orphanages and foster homes of children

This is a society where we have perfect birth control (presumably), effective treatments for psychological illnesses, guaranteed food and shelter. Birthrates are also low due to the high living standards. I wouldn't be surprised if orphans and fosters are extremely rare (and when they do happen, instantly placed into a good home).
With regards to your theory, this would conflict with "recorded future", as the Organians told Kirk and Kor that their races would become fast friends and work together in the future.
Goddammit, MGM. I'm thoroughly disappointed that we didn't get any PC games before this... but still going to buy it, once it's out for Android.
I agree in general with your objections... but I still enjoyed the new Trek movie. It's a process that started when they labeled the new movies a reboot. Clearly, they wanted to say that the type of 'old style' Trek we've come to love probably won't be back. They wanted to establish a new continuity, and I decided to go into the movie with that mindset ("It's a new universe, forget everything you used to know" continuously repeated mentally). It turned out to be much more enjoyable that way. Every time they made a nod back at the original series, it was a surprise reference, and made me laugh while most of the rest of the theatre sat clueless.

It's hard to let go, but then again "All good things..."

No. Your point is nonsensical and shows a fundamental misunderstanding of electricity generation. To begin with, it's not like every single power plants are all on at once, you think power plants don't have to be shut down for maintenance once in a while? A properly designed electric grid *always* has excess capacity. Power has to be generated at the moment it's used. This means that if, at any moment, power generation falls behind demand, somebody will lose power. To be safe, power companies always aim to generate above the actual demand.
Better co-op? Sure, that'd be nice. Time sink mechanics similar to WoW grinding? No. I would guess that a significant portion of the audience you're trying to capture (and recapture) most likely have limited gaming time. The last thing they want is to have to waste time grinding to get to end game content.

Honestly, Blizzard's inability to address the major deficiencies of the arcade (and Battle.net2 in general) *in a timely manner* is probably what cost them most of their non-ladder audiences. There's no incentive to stay if the system itself makes it hard to find fun, just move on to another game.
> in the case of Star Trek, and maybe sci-fi as a whole, the so-called reading grade level score is driven by the amount of technobabble in a script

DS9 was raised as a supporting example, but a possible counterpoint exists in the data too. Star Trek: The Animated Series (TAS) was aimed at kids and still has a very high reading level, it probably has the least amount of technobabble out of all the series.
You guys seem to be misunderstanding something. The rover is still going to be operated and monitored 24/7. That infrastructure has been there for ages, have you seen the JPL/NASA operations centers? This specific news is from the science team which is planning/prioritizing what they want the rover to do each Martian day. On Saturday, they plan an extra day's worth of operations to give themselves Sunday off.

So no, the rover isn't parked idle on Sunday, it's still going to be doing science.
We're also far from running out of Pluto-sized objects to name in our solar system, there's a giant [list of possible dwarf planets](http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/dps.html). And once more powerful telescopes are built that can verify those candidates, we'll probably find a lot more other candidates.
Nah, let's save that for an arid but habitable planet, they're bound to find one eventually.
Well, technically, the Kerbal engineers were trying to design a cryogenics chamber for those long voyages, but they, er, found a better use for the design... during testing.

Yes, but you'll probably have to do it yourself and it requires some advanced computer skills. What you want to do is modify the sprites used by the game.

It's a good idea in general, but the QuickFire TK's execution is lacking in that the placement of the Ins/Del, Home/End, PgUp/PgDn keys needs to be one row higher to be in their default positions. I personally use those keys far more often than the numpad, so having them in the right place outweighs the benefit of a numpad.

It really depends on the type of shows you're in to, it's very different from SG1 and SGA, so even if you like them, you might not like SGU. In SGU, instead of a tight knit crew exploring the galaxy, you have a disparate and fractious group of people forced to work together for survival. SGU's mood is more somber, there's much less joking and light hearted moments.

Honestly, I followed SGU for 2 seasons and then just didn't bother picking it back up. I really missed SG1/SGA's sense of humour, the thrill of adventure and the feel of camaraderie. In the end, that was what made Stargate worth watching for me, and SGU didn't have it.

Nothing. His point is that pure exploration is very risky, often with no profits to be made. Which is why why major explorations such as Columbus, Magellan, Lewis & Clark, Apollo, etc. were all government sponsored, as governments are the only ones capable of taking these losses if things don't work out.
> Well we do have a much better understanding of our capabilities than they did back then.

Is our understanding so perfect that there is no possible room for improvement?

> Finding fertile land on earth that is beneficial to humanity is a lot easier than any benefit we can get within our current reach in space. 

What's the easiest way to survey massive areas of land on Earth right now? May I suggest *space observations*?


Soo, what projects have they done that's taken several decades to complete and made them no money?
It's ridiculous that this objection comes up every time people talk about investments in basic exploration. The thing is, we do basic exploration precisely because we *don't know what we might find*. The first dude that built a raft doesn't know that he's starting a chain of events that'll lead to giant fleets of cargo ships transporting goods across the oceans of the Earth. Decades of space exploration gives us the ability to put satellites into space that lets us track and predict the path of Hurricane Sandy from the moment of its birth, giving us plenty of warning for preparations to save lives and reduce losses.

We don't know what results we'll get when we explore, the payout might be nothing, or it might be decades in coming, or it might be huge and immediate, that's what makes it risky, but it's also why it must be done.
> We would need to see a massive cost reduction in aerospace operations

That's the point.

> There is plenty of potential profit, just nothing that will make the investors stinking rich(er) **in five years**.

Private companies aren't going to commit to the kind of investment required in time and money to make space accessible. Only an agency like NASA would and have done it. If you look at the US space startups, they all build heavily on NASA research and/or are being funded by NASA.
> That's not an example of doctors using the placebo effect... The antibiotics have a direct physical impact, not just an indirect physical impact through psychology. They take out the bacteria which the immune system would have had to deal with, probably to a much greater extent than normal due to the opportunistic nature of those beasties, and allow more resources to be devoted to fighting the main problem. 

Antibiotics do not help fight off viral infections. Using antibiotics when it's not needed is harmful to others and to yourself.

Overuse of antibiotics has resulted in the proliferation of increasingly drug resistant bacteria, decreasing antibiotic effectiveness when it's actually needed. The vast majority of the bacteria in your body are actually beneficial and they are are kept in check not by the immune system as you asserted, but by each other. Antibiotics are indiscriminate, it kills both harmful and beneficial bacteria. A previously beneficial bacteria can multiply to harmful levels when the competitors that kept it in check gets killed off, increasing the strain on the immune system.

There have been increasingly urgent efforts all over the world to stop people from using antibiotics when they don't need it, see campaigns by organizations such as the [CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/features/getsmart/) and the [WHO](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2011/whd_20110407/en/index.html).

> Like lots of other folks, you don't know what the placebo effect is. The effects are physical. The placebo effect is the result of the fact that one's psychological state impacts one's physical state. A lot.

I'm not saying that psychological state can't have physical effects. I'm saying that when talking about medicine, it's reasonable for us to disregard such types of physical effects, as they act on the subjective *symptoms* not the *disease*. E.g.: Cancer patients who get sugar pills might feel better, but that doesn't mean their cancer has disappeared. Yes, we get interesting knowledge from studying placebos, but placebos *do not work* as medicine.

> it's completely fucking wrong. And it leads to folks like you being ignorant about what the placebo effect is and is not

From a blog written and edited by [scientists and doctors](http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/index.php/the-placebo-effect/):

>A common belief is that the placebo effect is largely a “mind-over-matter effect,” but this is a misconception. There is no compelling evidence that the mind can create healing simply through will or belief.

>...the more concrete and physiological the outcome, the smaller the placebo effect. Survival from serious forms of cancer, for example, has no demonstrable placebo effect.

>Any real benefits that contribute to the placebo effect can be gained by more straightforward methods – like healthy habits, compliance with treatment, and good health care. The placebo effect is not evidence for any mysterious mind-over-matter effect, but since the mind is matter (the brain) and is connected to the rest of the body, there are some known physiological effects that do play a role (although often greatly exaggerated).
You might be missing the point on why people say the placebo effect doesn't work even though it is a quantifiable effect. Remember, the effects are psychological, not physical. Most of medicine is focused on healing physical damage to the body, hence why scientists have to discount the placebo effect in studies. Even if a patient subjectively feels better, they're not actually physically better.

Doctors do actually sometimes use placebos, even though there is controversy surrounding its use. One common example that has caused a lot of problems would be giving people anti-biotics even though they have a viral infection (sometimes because patients demand them).

You're right to say that "the placebo effect doesn't work" is an oversimplification, but it's probably a necessary simplification dictated by the need to quickly communicate science to a layperson. 
That's quite an impressive rendition of the [Soyuz rocket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Soyuz_rocket_engines.jpg) in background too.
The point I was trying to make was that Samsung and nVidia's interest in open source is a very recent development. Note the two links I gave are only 1-2 months old. It started way *after* the Galaxy Nexus was released. Yes, we *now* have more choices, but OMAP was the only choice *back then*.
No, OMAP was clearly the better open platform at the time of the Galaxy Nexus' release. It's been around for far longer than any of the other three alternatives (Exynos, Tegra, Snapdragon), with far more mature and open documentation as a result.

Both Exynos and Tegra has had a rocky relationship with the open source community. Many devs have specifically criticized Samsung for failing to [adequately document the Exynos platform](http://www.xda-developers.com/android/samsung-aware-of-exynos-documentation-issue/).

And nVidia has always had terrible open source support, it was only two months ago that they decided to [release *some* documentation](http://www.engadget.com/2012/09/23/nvidia-to-offer-up-documentation-for-tegra-graphics-core/) after getting cussed out by Linus in public.

Finally, Snapdragon. Look at the OP. Enough said.
Specifically on doujin work, I seriously doubt it'll have any effect. Remember, the copyright holder has to make an accusation first, which then goes to court.

I've thought that your average humans might be mentally and physically incapable of following the teachings of Surak. Vulcans, with their highly developed brain, are trained from birth for emotional and intellectual mastery. With the Vulcans' longer lifespans, they presumably have a longer period in which they physically mature and train for adulthood. E.g.: Whereas the human brain is pretty much done maturing after a short 20 years, Vulcans might take 50 or more years. A normal human probably has no hope of mastering Vulcan mental control.

Again, only true if you run Metro apps. Desktop mode is not available on Windows RT.

This is a better article than the Yahoo one, though the explanation of the abc conjecture should go one step further and say something like:

* sqp(abc) > c is very common, there are in fact infinitely many abc triples for which this is true
* sqp(abc) < c is rare, and the abc conjecture states that there are only a finite number of abc triplets for which this is true

> It states that for integers a+b=c, the ratio of sqp(abc)^r/c always has some minimum value greater than zero for any value of r greater than 1.

I was really confused when they stopped the explanation with this statement.

The problem wasn't with capped plans, but that the data cap they set was ridiculously low.

It was an anti-competitive and cash grabbing move by the giant ISPs: Gain indirect control over your competitor's pricing, increase prices, leave the customers no choice, profit!
The comparison is actually pretty interesting. While Los Angeles has the larger population, Vancouver is more densely populated (5,249/km^2) than Los Angeles (3,124.45/km^2). Vancouver was [deliberately designed without highways](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouverism) to inhibit urban sprawl in favour of high population density, exactly the opposite direction that Los Angeles went.
Energy efficiency per passenger-mile is only one part of the story. The better metric to look at is energy consumption per capita, which would include additional factors such as distance traveled.

Transit systems are space efficient, they serve more people in less space than cars. E.g.: If the city gets rid of the Skytrain, there is just not enough space downtown to fit all the former Skytrain riders who would have to drive instead. Transit enables and promotes high population densities. It is this high population density that makes transit efficient, as it results in shorter travel distances, which reduces energy consumption per capita to a level that can't be achieved with cars alone.

What you're looking for are sissor-switches, they're usually marketed as 'low-profile' or 'ultra-slim' keys. I'm aware of none that are gaming oriented.

You might want to give mechanicals another chance and try a keyboard with Cherry Red switches. They're the lightest Cherry switch, needing only ~45g of force to activation. That's lighter than typical sissor switches, which needs around 55-60g of force. Also, while mechanical keys bottom out at 4mm, they activate at 2mm, same as sissor-switches.

It's good enough. Wind operates on a relatively high frequency spectrum (1700/2100 mHz), which doesn't penetrate very well, so expect to lose signal once you're deep enough inside a building.

Not sure if you read the article. Density was a variable they tried to control by only comparing cities. The study author even provided a few counterpoints to a similar criticism from Verizon:

> "We only looked at cities," he told us in a phone interview. The problem, he said, was that incumbents in the United States don't offer ultra-fast speeds even in urban areas **whose high density ought to make them cost-effective**.

And he mentioned counterexamples where city governments built their own infrastructure and was able to provide much higher speeds at similar costs: 

> The study included three small cities—Chatanooga, TN; Lafayette, LA; and Bristol, VA—that have built city-owned fiber networks. Although those networks are not offering dramatically lower prices than the incumbents, they are providing some of the nation's fastest broadband speeds. And Lennett suggested that they would be able to cut their prices once they've paid off the costs of initial construction.

Note that earlier in the article, they stated that Chatanooga, TN, can get gigabit speeds.

> Residents of Chattanooga, TN, can get gigabit Internet access.

Gigabit Internet for everyone is a goal that South Korea is still [working on right now](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/technology/22iht-broadband22.html). There's no reason why North American urban centers can't keep up with the current broadband leaders, *if they want to*.

Probably easier just to change the window decorations to one you like.
[He did](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2009/03/18/tech-090318-gary-goodyear-evolution-scientists.html). But it's still not exactly reassuring that he gave a scientifically illiterate description of evolution. Linking evolution to religion and thereby judging questions about evolution to be 'irrelevant' also doesn't help.
A bit late. But I liked the series. There's just some inconsistency from book to book due to the changing authors.
Great book indeed. Though I bet Spock just made up those regulations.
To call the scientific reasoning against wifi (or cellphone) RF 'sound' is quite a stretch. "Class 2B agent" sounds more scary than it actually is. Pickled vegetables and coffee are also Class 2B agents. And so is talc, one of the main ingredients in baby powder.
One of the effects of a warmer atmosphere is that wet areas tend to get wetter and dry areas tend to get drier. There are two factors at play:

* The warmer air increases the capacity of the atmosphere to hold water vapor.
* The warmer atmosphere increases the amount of moisture being transported from the subtropics to the higher latitudes.

So Northern Europe is getting more rain while Northern Africa gets drier.
For UBC's VPN, I use OpenConnect, the open source alternative to the Cisco AnyConnect client they want you to download. There's a nice integration package called network-manager-openconnect on Ubuntu, which seems to have a [Fedora counterpart](https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/NetworkManager-openconnect).
> Many of the other services they use suck as well, such as iPeer, though part of this is staff not being trained properly.

I do some coding for iPeer. If you're willing, tell me everything you remember of what's wrong, I'll make sure we fix it for September (if it's fixable on the development side).
Sorry, my mistake for not being more clear. 

Nope, they can't. Cool photo that demonstrates this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cage_de_Faraday.jpg
If you build a Faraday cage, radio waves can't make it outside the booth, why would you still do a strip search? 
Sure, until some guy with a pacemaker walks near the booths. EM interference affects more equipment than just cellphones.
> But emergency calls could still be made out side of the booth

Unfortunately, radio emissions can't be localized like that unless you go back to the original idea of a Faraday cage. This is one factor in why cellphone jammers are banned.

Honestly, a Faraday cage is easy to build, there's no need for EM jammers.
And it's not like we have to worry about other people knowing how to use our systems, anyway. :x
To add to everyone else, SpaceX do plan to make the Dragon capsule human spaceflight capable, so it might not be manned now, but it eventually will be.

> Are the protesters ready for this level of dialogue?

The protesters? It's not the protesters' job to discuss policy alternatives. They don't have the power to set policy and the very nature of a protest isn't exactly structured to allow rational debates. The job of the protestors, the only job they *can* do well, is express dissatisfaction. 

It is the job of the of the legislators to come up with solutions. Of coming up with compromises, alternatives. Of opening up dialogue. That's what we pay them for, and that's why we set up this whole structure of government, to facilitate rational decision making, to consider all the options in the light of sober thought. I would love to see discussion start in the right place. But all I see is this idiotic hardlining that just makes the situation worse. 

Most of the protestors would probably desist when provided with a more palatable alternative. Maybe you can have a free education, but then is obligated to stay and work in the province for an economically beneficial amount of time. Maybe it can be need based, the more well off you are, the more you pay. Maybe you pay less tuition if you study in an area where we're lacking people, as you suggested.

There's the TNG: Starfleet Academy series, a few of them were Picard focused, but they're short young adult novels. I can't remember any other ones where he was that young. 

The Stargazer series is about Picard's command aboard the Stargazer, if that'll do. I seem to remember a few other instances of Picard before/during command of the Stargazer, but he was a minor character in those.
> Isn't it a tad silly they couldn't incorporate that into their formula?

Well, yes, they could've probably put something in that'll work for most people. 

But if they wanted to be 100% accurate, DST is complicated to deal with due to having to remember to keep it up to date and all the special cases. E.g.: States that straddle 2 timezones, places that don't observe DST, etc. 

The Navajo Reservation is probably the most interesting example: The Navajo Reservation observes DST, but it's mostly in Arizona, which doesn't observe DST. There's a small area inside the Navajo Reservation, the Hopi Reservation, which also does not observe DST.

Edit: Actually, never mind, you're right. They could've just added a checkbox for DST or something.
> All times are displayed in local time using the value from the Time Zone field in Section 1 (add 1 hour for Daylight Saving Time).

RTFM?

I imagine DST was too much of a pain to program in.
What happens when you're not allowed to eject a USB drive is that there's still data waiting to be written to the drive. The sync command forces all buffered data to be written to the USB drive and returns when all data have been written out. It's just another way of checking to see if it's safe to remove your drive yet.
Type sync into the command line. Wait until it finishes. Unmount.
Hear, hear.
Your post really highlights some of Microsoft's more inexplicable business decisions, imo: Leaving Windows Mobile to basically languish after Palm ceased to be competitive and running Danger into the ground. They could've competed with iOS and Android right from the start, instead of the catch up they're having to do now.
Haha, yeah. 

You know what I miss? Infrared ports. Never had to bother with universal remotes.
The moment I saw the iPhone, I said, "oh cool, they're finally bringing PDAs back." If you had been a gadget geek years before the iPhone, you'd have seen that the [iPhone](http://photos.appleinsider.com/ios-111205.png) is obviously a descendant of [devices like this](http://images.pcworld.com/reviews/graphics/123574-2401p051-1b.jpg).
Ahh, cool.
> the Enterprise was originally slated to be a true Space Shuttle and flown into Space however it was found to be cheaper to make a new one from scratch and that is what the ~~Challenger~~ Endeavor was.

Haha, you were right originally. Enterprise was supposed to be the second space worthy shuttle, but it turned out to be cheaper to build Challenger than it was to refit Enterprise. The Endeavour was built after the Challenger disaster, where they again rejected refitting Enterprise as a replacement for Challenger. But the Endeavour wasn't built from scratch, it was put together from spare parts.
There are 2 differences that I've noticed:

Aptitude shows the status of the package, e.g.: p means not found on the system, i means that the package is installed.

    p   virtualbox                      - x86 virtualization solution - base binarie
    p   virtualbox:i386                 - x86 virtualization solution - base binarie
    i   virtualbox-4.1                  - Oracle VM VirtualBox  

Aptitude searches package names only, apt-cache searches package name + descriptions. I get additional results like these when using apt-cache cause they all have the keyword virtualbox in the descriptions.

    libvirt-bin - programs for the libvirt library
    libvirt-dev - development files for the libvirt library
    libvirt-doc - documentation for the libvirt library

Note that they both search the same database though. I personally prefer aptitude since it's easier to have 1 command than to have to remember to distinguish between apt-cache and apt-get.
Other people are telling you to go to the Ubuntu Software Center, but if you want to use the command line all the way, you can use:

    apt-cache search virtualbox

To see if VirtualBox is already in the repository (which it is). You can get more information about the package with:

    apt-cache show virtualbox

Once you're satisfied that it's what you want, you can install it with:

    sudo apt-get install virtualbox

Unless you want USB support in the guest OS, there's no reason not to use the version already in the repository.
Note that this is assuming you plan to work after graduation and not grad study.

Electives that will help you with jobs now:

CS 304 : Introduction to Databases - They only cover relational databases, and there's a movement away from relational databases, but it's still widely used and is a topic you should have some basic knowledge in.

CS 317 : Computer Networking - Looks like people have bad experiences with it, I didn't (different prof, probably), but you should still take it for the material. The Internet is such a large part of computing infrastructure that you're pretty much guaranteed to need knowledge of it later on.

Electives that will help you with jobs in the future:

CS 312 : Functional and Logic Programming - Definitely take this course if Kurt Eiselt is teaching, he somehow made us laugh every lecture. Teaches you different ways to do programming.

CS 448b (AKA CS 418) : Parallel Computation - Mark Greenstreet is also a pretty fun prof, and the content should be required for all CS majors. Basically talks about how different it is to program for multi-core cpus & graphics cards.

CS  416 : Distributed Systems - Similar to Parallel Computation, the difference being that 448b covers material a lot closer to the 'bare metal', while 416 pulls back to look at computers talking to computers. E.g.: Google's server farms, cloud computing, etc. Alan Wagner is a pretty laid back prof too.

It also depends on what you enjoy, I really like doing systems programming, so had a blast with:

CS 311 : Definition of Programming Languages - You build an interpreter.

CS 411 : Introduction to Compiler Construction - You build a compiler.

CS 415 : Advanced Operating Systems - You build a kernel.

Pretty impressive things to put on a resume too.

I presume you wanted to link to the actual video. Since the link is missing, I'm guessing that you wrote a description without realizing that it becomes a self post if you do that. I made this mistake too, in my first post.

I prefer Nvidia for only one reason: more mature Linux drivers. But if AMD gets fully working drivers, I would definitely consider buying them instead. And no, I don't game in Linux. I dual boot to Windows for games, but do everything else in Linux and having hardware acceleration is nice for video playback.
For the EOSC courses, if you don't want to do distance learning, the first year EOSC lecture courses have similar content and are light in terms of work load. They mainly cover concepts and definitions. I remember my EOSC 112 final was multiple choice and the profs reused a lot of questions from the midterms.

> No one in their right mind would deny the practical technological benefits of the man-made objects currently in orbit around our little planet, and those did not produce any new scientific knowledge mind you

I find it difficult to believe that we now have to defend the scientific benefits of space exploration. The scientific benefit for space exploration should be *blindingly obvious*.

Why do we put space telescopes in orbit? To gain scientific knowledge about distant objects.
Why do we send probes to Mars? To Mercury? Pluto? Jupiter? Saturn? To gain knowledge.
Why do we do experiments in micro-gravity? To gain knowledge.

Space exploration is one of the best examples of pure science, where we seek knowledge for the gratification of the knowledge itself. Astronautics, astronomy, astrophysics, planetary science, cosmology, etc. are all fields that wouldn't be where it is today without space exploration.

> Hubble Telescope of course is fairly nice, but still, quite expensive and one could generate a lot more from that money.

You probably have a digital camera on your phone. Or maybe on your computer. Or maybe in a stand alone camera. The CCD imaging sensor at the heart of those cameras owed a lot of their technology to Hubble. 

Digital mammography? Micro-endoscopes? Microlithography? All technology improved by research done for the Hubble.

Not to mention minor spin offs like tracking endangered animals or optimizing hospital schedules.

I don't know how much more you want to get out of that money.

> Computer is the result from the very thing that Sagan considers to be a waste of money

False. He would never consider the pure science exploration that you outlined to be a waste of money.

In fact, computers are the result of the things that you consider to be a waste of money.  Computers now are so portable that you can have one in your pocket. That  whole trend of miniaturizing computers? The Apollo program was a huge driver. They were heavily constrained by weight limits and needed the smallest possible computer they could.
Well, I didn't know about ctrl-u either, but I use ctrl-c instead.
I don't think *outdated* science qualifies as bad science. Provided you suspend your disbelief on the 'de-evolution' premise, it's actually quite impressive how much of the other things that Data said about genes in that ep was accurate according to what we know back when the episode was written. That makes it an example of science done right in TV shows, imo.
No. Just no. I don't think you realize just how much more difficult it was to implement as an add-on than from source.

It was better when Blizzard was honest, calling the lack of LAN and other features as what they are: **business decisions**. The 'technically difficult' defense never held any water. And I'm tired of people defending it. Do you truly believe that a company of Blizzard's size and experience lacks the ability to surmount a technical problem that plenty of other people have solved?!

> No one in here knows what the source code looks like so we can't say how easy it is to implement.

The add-on calls Blizzard functions. Which means the author knew what those functions does. He could've only gotten that knowledge by reverse engineering. If having to read and understand a program from its disassembly doesn't count as knowing the source code, I don't know what does.

> As a developer I can tell you that it's not just programming. There are tons of logic choices that need to be ironed out.

The examples you gave are all design decisions and they're all quite easy to resolve comparatively. E.g.: 

> Does the current system even have a disconnect record? If not, they would have to implement that which means potential database changes. How would disconnects be handled now? Would the system record the disconnect? Would the system not count it at all if the game is resumed? How do you differentiate between honest replay injections and hacked ones?

Not applicable, make resume only available for custom games. Tournaments don't take place on ladder.

> What if both computers have slight differences in the replay near the end? Which one is correct?

Why is this even a problem when *existing behaviour* solves it perfectly fine. i.e.: only valid up to the point where both replays agree.
Last number is probably a check digit instead of being random.

I think some stage of the exploit still involves JavaScript. If you disable JavaScript, you can reach the real food services site. There seems to be a fat blob of obfuscated JavaScript in tabs_slides_comp.js too.

Interesting find on the CSS requests. Looks like the server returns a 302 "the document has moved" message with a redirect to the Russian server which the browser then automatically followed. So at some point, the attackers seem to have gained some amount of server access, enough to redirect the CSS files.
They make money from it. I dearly hope that the housing payment database isn't compromised, I don't think it has, since the attack would look different.

This looks more like a simpler attack where they just want to redirect users to destinations of their choice. E.g.: My first visit got redirected to one of those scareware sites where they fake an antivirus scan, detect a whole bunch of 'threats', and try to get you to buy their software.
Same bastards who don't flush, I'm guessing.
Another work around, if you have a cpu that can handle it, is to just disable Flash hardware acceleration altogether.
Uhh, well, he might look lovable, and I know he's offering you a pretty sweet deal on a contract, but trust me, you don't want to get locked in.
Controversy manufactured by non-experts. No matter the PR damage, the science is still sound.
E.g.: Things such as fossilized tree rings and sediment layers provide data that goes back thousands of years. Even better, ice cores can provide data that goes back hundreds of thousands of years.

Everything works for me too on Linux (Arch, Ubuntu, Android 2.1-4.0). Most issues are just PEBKAC, heh.
I love TOS, but you have to admit, it is an acquired taste for those of us who didn't grow up with it. I wasn't able to appreciate the show until the fact that this was made in the 60s, and was one of the first scifi tv shows, sunk in. It was then that the outdated sets and sfx didn't matter and I started admiring the sheer creativity and imagination that went into the story telling.
Haha, close enough!

> There's a lot of talk about how absolutely necessary it is to keep post-secondary education affordable. I'd dispute that in itself

I'm curious how you would dispute this. To me, the prosperity of a modern nation requires a highly educated citizenry, which makes higher education a necessary national investment.
WoW players use simple commands like these all the time in the chat box. It's not *that* complicated.

It ignores the obvious technical solution to the problem. Google should make phones a more general and open platform like PCs. Not an easy problem to solve, but it surely isn't beyond the massive amount of talent accessible to Google.

You don't pay for Windows Update, do you? Sure, you might need to upgrade Windows if there's a major architectural change like XP -> 7, but that only happens every few years. And even if you don't upgrade, you continue to get security updates, bugfixes, and even new software like browsers for years down the line. This is what Android should move toward, even if just for security reasons alone.

UBC used to place restrictions on the placement of the pictures so that they were less visible. It was much more subdued in my first few years here. The restrictions were lifted when the project started lawyering up, basically. I don't think UBC can afford to get into a protracted legal fight.

As rightmeowplz mentioned, the display as a whole is called the Genocide Awareness Project, made by a pro-life group from the states called the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform. They were invited to UBC by Lifeline, a pro-life AMS club.

All true. But I am not arguing that a regular site is superior in all respects. The point of my preference for regular sites was that it's open and easy for standard web tools to access. 
Honestly, the Vista discussion boards were more clunky and unwieldy than the predecessor equivalent in WebCT CE.

I do love courses that had their own sites. At the end of the term, I can just make a local copy of the site with wget. Unfortunately, not all profs are technologically literate enough to make one.
It looks like it has something to do with the camera. If you look at this vid: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpNUZzVC8NM when she switched a setting on the camera around 0:37, the dots became a lot more noticeable. They look like damaged pixels on the sensor to me. I imagine they just use regular consumer level cameras to take these vids, instead of some special camera with radiation hardening.
Well, I want a vortex manipulator then, built out of wood this time, thanks.
Just to add to the tips, if it isn't obvious already: These bike thieves come from off campus, and they usually hit when they know there isn't going to be very many people around. E.g.: Reading Week, Christmas Break, long weekends. So if you're going away for a break, and you know there won't be many people on campus, lock your bike in your room.

There are a few things you can do to make your bike a less appealing target than the bike next to you: Don't use any cable locks, they are too easily cut. Get a heavy duty solid metal lock, I use a thick chain lock. At the very least, your lock should be large enough to secure the frame AND one wheel, and you should always lock your bike this way. If you have quick release on your wheels and seats, change them out for at least a nuts and bolt system. Even better would be those bolts that needs special key to loosen.

Do talk to the Exchange/Transfer Students Advisor for ChemEng, Dr. Anthony Lau: http://www.chbe.ubc.ca/prospective_students/undergraduate/advisors.php
It's never too late to transfer. I've known people who switched majors in their 4th year. As long as you meet the academic requirements for transfer into the program, they'll let you change majors as many times as you want. You'll just need to stay for a few more years to get your degree.

Edit: Just noticed that you wanted to get into second year:

> A student will be admitted into second-year engineering if that student had successfully completed or had transfer credits for at least 27 credits of our first-year program. Students not meeting this criterion would be admitted into our first-year program.

At least AMD is still doing quite well with their graphics chips, so it's not as bleak as the article might suggest. 
There's hope that since the mobile platforms are all ARM based, we might finally see x86 fade away in the future.
Yep, but it was more around the turn of the century. Intel was a victim of its own success. No one wanted to migrate all the software needed to switch from x86, even though everyone knew x86 was old and clunky.
He's probably referring to x86-64, which was originally created by AMD.
As someone who has used Linux with ubcsecure for years with several different laptops, I've rarely had a problem with the network itself. If I have trouble connecting, it's usually a software problem, either a misconfiguration or driver issue. 
Oh, I wouldn't complain about this, it makes googling for help on it easier... Though, it might make finding the software in the first place harder.
Fear not, there's always the stage fairies.
It's actually pretty normal to have 1 or 2. Note that UBC doesn't count a W against you academically, but if you plan to apply to other schools, they might have different policies.
Two things happen when you drop a course this late:

* You get a W on your transcript, which is just a notation that indicates you attempted the course but decided to withdraw.

* You don't get a full refund. You'll be paying for at least part of the course.

Also, make sure you still meet any minimum credit requirements you might have. I remember that UBC Housing requires you to take at least 12 credits per term. Though, kicking people out of housing in the middle of the term seems a bit cruel, so they might not bother.
The hubbub in this case is justified since the physical access part can be made optional. We've already seen that with USB exploits. E.g.: Drop a suitably modified USB drive in a parking lot, an employee picks it up and plugs it in, you're in without ever being near the computer.

One skill I haven't seen people mention is information management. As a beginner, you're basically bombarded with bullets on screen in a massive information overload.

Don't downvote this guy. Honestly, the first time I heard this, I was rather skeptical, but there's some rather good arguments for this. The strongest argument being the move in computer architecture from fast single processors to multicore. 

At the top-tier consumer level, we're at, what, 8 cores now? Can you honestly say that a normal user will always keep those 8 cores busy? What happens, say, in a decade, when we have processors with 64 cores or 128 cores? At some point, massive parallelism will probably make it far more efficient to go back to the terminal servers.

The LEDs are too weak. If you calculate the exact amount of energy input required to melt ice to water for a closed system at thermal equilibrium, e.g.: Ice at exactly 0 C requires 333.55 Joules/gram of energy to melt. Assuming we use 500 milliwatt IR LEDs to melt them. 500 milliwatt equals 0.5 Joules/second of energy. 

We can see that even for very light requirements, 1 gram of snow in a closed system at exactly 0 C, and even assuming perfect transfer of energy from the LED to the snow, it takes quite a bit of an effort for a LED to melt just 1 gram of ice.

Your sidewalk isn't a closed system and probably isn't at equilibrium, some of the energy you put into the snow will be lost to the air and ground. And there is much more snow than just 1 gram. And the snow is probably colder than 0 C. All these factors makes the energy you need to put in much greater than what several hundred LEDs can deliver.
He's obviously compensating for a lackluster, or should I say practically non-existent, manned space program.

Late 1990's, there's a bunch of Trek gaming publishers, most of them don't exist anymore. E.g.: Starfleet Command with Interplay, Birth of the Federation with Microprose, Dominion Wars with Simon & Schuster

Early 2000's, Activision was granted an exclusive license for all Trek games.

Armada and Elite Force are both Activision titles. Unfortunately, there's a legal tangle you'd have to go through if you want to see those games on sale again. While Activision might own the games, they probably don't have permission to distribute Trek intellectual property. There isn't exactly good blood betweent Activision and the Trek intellectual property owners, seeing as how Activision basically sued them and said they were to blame for the Trek games not selling well.
It became mainstream in Korea because everyone has played StarCraft through the PC cafes. Hence everyone has at least an understanding of, and can follow, pro-StarCraft. That, imo, is the problem we have in the West, and it isn't likely to be solved anytime soon.
That, I don't know. The only point I want to make is that a properly conducted survey from a reputable source can't be dismissed so easily.
I don't mean that players shouldn't take care of themselves. I mean that we shouldn't have to use sex to trick people into following StarCraft.
> Are you claiming that following a training regime and living a healthier life is stupid? 

Of course not. Because living a healthy life and sex appeal are not the same thing. Hell, they are sometimes mutually exclusive, looking at current standards of female beauty.

> Why would adding sex appeal be dumbing down?

Because trying to use sex appeal to elicit interest is one of the lowest forms of trickery. Why do car shows have booth babes around the cars? Because they've found that putting buyers in the presence of attractive members of the opposite sex causes more rash decision making. Sex appeal targets some of our most primitive instincts. Its effects are very difficult to mitigate, even when you are consciously aware of it.
We really shouldn't dumb down the scene to attract people. And yes, adding 'sex appeal' *is* dumbing down. Besides, you have much more stereotypes than just 'nerd' to work against if you want to attract female fans in the West. Gaming and sports are both interests that Western culture has classified as traditionally male.
Yeah, only after being 'inspired' by the Russians going to space first.
> All these stupid surveys and shit claiming Japanese people have sex the least in developed countries is bullshit. In their culture, they fear shame a lot... so when given questionnaires on their sex life, they lie about it a lot.

Actually, statisticians are well aware that people may lie on sensitive or embarrassing questions and do have countermeasures against it. One common technique is to ask the participants to lie. 

For example, you give the participant a coin and ask them to flip the coin before answering. If the coin comes up heads, they lie, if tails, they tell the truth. The result of the coin flip is kept completely secret, only the participant knows whether they are telling the truth or lying.

The statisticians, when they later analyze the data, can extract the real overall data using a beautiful mathematical result called [Bayes' Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem).
Honestly, the most probable explanation is just that the classes are much more difficult than high school ones.

What's the source? I think imgur put too high a compression on the pic, there's obvious artifacts everywhere. 
Haha, I like Homura's hat.
Snape specifically requested that Dumbledore not tell Harry though, Dumbledore would've respected that wish and passed it on to Aberforth.
Haha, true. Then let's say Aberforth told Snape, since Harry was playing around with the mirror shard earlier.
In this case, we can probably just take Harry's initial explanation (in the book) for it? The sword shows up whenever a Gryffindor is in need, requiring a test of courage before you are allowed to use it.

I've found the igniters to be pretty reliable if you're careful (don't let it short, attach securely, provide enough current), but I've only played with commercial model rockets. Maybe you can find a fireworks expert on reddit for proper advice.

You can probably reduce the dependence on igniters a bit though. For instance, the launching process can actually be controlled by a clamp or something, while the fire is just visual special effects.
Electric matches are pretty cheap, I'm not sure why you think it would be expensive. Fireworks/model rocketry, all uses electric matches as engine igniters. There's plenty of DIY guides out there on how to build igniters, if you don't want to buy them, like [this one](http://makeprojects.com/Project/Model-Rocket-Igniters/386/1) and [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFFfx8mFQm8).

It was also the apocalyptic and grim tilt that's put me off. Apocalyptic scenarios has been overused in the newer Trek novels. What's even worse is that, in most of those works, if you take away the apocalyptic scenario itself, there's almost no storytelling value left. It's usually an sign of poor writing and lack of creativity when they have to base their entire story telling effort on ever increasing scales of destruction. 
Cross post to r/startrek, you'll probably get more responses there. 

Personally, I find the newer books to be usually less enjoyable than the older books. There's a noticeable change in tone and atmosphere.
How bright were they and in what directions were they moving in? If you remember the exact time frame, [these are the brightest satellites overhead around Vancouver last night](http://www.heavens-above.com/allsats.asp?lat=49.16734&lng=-123.11279&alt=0&loc=Unspecified&TZ=PST&Date=40868.1041666667&Mag=3.5).
Player fatigue from playing a few easy games is pretty much a non-issue. Jet lag is a far more significant factor.

Er, I think you've mistaken the rear photon torpedo launchers for the impulse engines. The impulse engines are located at the midpoint of each of the nacelle struts.
Well, considering what happened the last time (in that other universe) when they met something that popped out of a black hole... Can you blame them? 
They did a poll on people's favourite starship classes on startrek.com, the Akira-class won. A bit later, we ended up with the Akiraprise, heh.
Haha, it's the instruction pointer register. I've never made the RIP connection though, weirdly enough.

A work-study job will usually pay better hourly than a part time job. However, you can only work for a maximum of 10 hours a week. It's not really that time consuming, so if you can fit it in your schedule, you can get an additional part-time job if necessary.
Umm... do I need to repeat the lots of planets, ships, stations part. And have you forgotten how big a planet is?
Space is huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge. There are tons of stars, most of them have planets, and habitable worlds aren't uncommon. Not to mention they practice planet-wide terraforming as a matter of fact. And then there are the space stations and ships all over the place. Can you even imagine the population density of the Federation as a whole? It'd be like 1 person every light year or something. It's a miracle they can gather 1000 people together on a ship, or even 4000 people to a colony.
If you bring people's standard of living up, [they start having fewer kids](http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_on_global_population_growth.html). Birth rates in modernized nations are actually very low, at below replacement levels.
The brown one is probably supposed to be a [Bajoran military ship](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Bajoran_assault_vessel). Kinda looks like they bought it from the [Pakleds](http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Pakled_trade_ship) though.
[This one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-1kkB_qF28#t=17s) is my favourite. I really like the leaving behind a blur of color effect. And the less colorful, more randomized, elongated star streaks is an excellent improvement over the radial regularly spaced streaks of the older effect. 

Generations sfx was great, love how they remembered to use the blur of color effect for the Enterprise-B in warp. In contrast, was a bit disappointed that the Phoenix had the 'modern' TNG warp effect.

Not that the TNG warp effect isn't awesome too. It's very clean and neat compared to the TOS movies, so gave that TNG appropriate more futuristic feel.
Well, that lieutenant studying the rarest spatial anomalies known to science happens to have 6 lives worth of experience to draw on. Granted, not all of them were experienced in technical fields, but how many other scientists in the Federation do you think can claim to be more qualified by virtue of being more experienced?

The difference is that you're viewing the Sony PSN hack retrospectively. The Sony ridicule, at least in terms of their security competence, really wasn't there until we got a lot more detail on what happened. Before that, people were just mad they couldn't play their games online. After that, people were mad that they couldn't play their games online AND that Sony did such a poor job of protecting their data.

The Steam hack just happened, we don't have enough details yet. But if those details prove that Valve made silly security missteps like Sony, I'm sure we'll see the same kind of ridicule. Not to mention that, had Steam gone down, the furor would make the PSN outrage look like a genteel debate.
Eh, from my view, it was way more depressing if you kept up with the information. The amount of data leaked just kept getting worse. Sony's other infrastructures also started getting compromised, repeatedly. Not only that, they were falling to attacks that weren't particularly sophisticated. It wasn't exactly a flattering image of security competence.
Easy. You forgot to count uploads. At least, that's what I, err, I mean, other people mostly did.
zram pretends to be a swap disk, so swappiness will determine how often you write to zram. Even though zram is faster than disk, it's still slower than regular ram, it has a compression/decompression overhead that you want to avoid if possible. 
Ah, didn't think about the rope length. Maybe it can just be part of the motor that lowers people down? Something like a rope drum. Coil a section of the rope loop around a cylinder. Rotate the cylinder to move people up and down. If you need a longer line, just uncoil a few lengths, a shorter line, add more coils. 
Hmm, they can probably design the mechanism so that, if it malfunctions, it just fail-safe into a regular descent system.
Make the rope into a loop, no need to reel it back up each trip then.
Oh, wait, does this have to be a mechanical system? I was actually thinking of a electronic system controlling the descent, it uses sensors to judge the distance to ground, and can compute and execute the fastest possible safe descent better than humans.
Attach people securely to ropes. Lower them out of the heli at desired speeds.
Sorry, I'm not up to date on current models, so can't recommend one.

As a general guideline though, picture quality increases as your budget increases. There's two major LCD panel technologies:

* TN panel - Cheapest, all the monitors you see <$300 are probably this type. There's a wide variation in quality with these monitors.
* IPS panel - Most expensive, >$500. Best picture quality. Mostly used by professional artists, photographers, etc.

There are also a few panel technologies that tries to compromise between TN and IPS such as PVA.

Gamers usually go for TN panels, as they're generally faster, not just in terms of response time, but display lag (aka input lag) also.
In general, no. LCD technology is pretty well developed at this point, they've actually hit a barrier in response time. I personally haven't encountered any new monitors with a really noticeable difference in response time for years now. I'm usually more worried about color reproduction than response time.

Note that manufacturer's stated response time between different monitors is actually pretty hard to compare. They don't tell you that response time varies depending on what color the pixel is transitioning to and from. Usually, they'll advertise the average response time (but I've seen a few that advertised their fastest response time, instead of the average). This means that even a monitor with an advertised 2ms response time has some colors that can have >10ms response time. 

If you really want to compare response time, your best bet is 3rd party review sites that uses photosensors to measure the actual response times. [Xbit labs](http://www.xbitlabs.com/articles/monitors/display/lcd-testmethods.html) has a very nice section explaining LCD monitor specs and how they test them.

The person who does not enjoy his subject, will end up being far less competent in it than one who does. Mastery is achieved by practice over a long period of time. Who do you think is more willing to spend that time, one who loves what they're doing, or one who doesn't?
See, I had two responses, and I wasn't sure which response is more appropriate.

One is that, inevitably, someone with a greater knowledge of the field has to tell you what to learn. It's not exactly beneficial to self direct if you don't know even know where to start. 

Another is that education is very impersonal. But people are very different, learning at different paces and in different ways. So yes, a personalized education would be far more effective than the impersonal schedule we have now.
What do you mean by someone else's schedule? I was actually thinking mostly of the 'free' K-12 public education system when I wrote the post.

> I think a lot of the problem is that people think university is a job farm. Its an education that may lead to a better job, but first and foremost it is an education.

It's depressing to see that I have to scroll down so far to see a sentiment like this. The real failure of our education system is that we've completely and utterly failed to teach an appreciation for the act of learning itself.

There are plenty of other similarly specialized jobs which require the same amount of, if not more, skill and knowledge to perform. Most of them are paid far less than CEOs. These requirements alone do not seem to warrant the far higher paychecks. 

There is no reason to assume that someone who is willing to do the job for less money is any less competent. In fact, you want to hire people who are not solely motivated by profit for the job since [if-then style financial motivators are detrimental to creative thinking](http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_pink_on_motivation.html). The question has to be asked whether bonus pay is actually harming the performance of companies.
Which is why I felt conflicted when given the choice to kill him.
