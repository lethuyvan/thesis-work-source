But then again, even if I could get more, even on normal prices, I wouldn't want to go around fucked up all day.

I guess we live in different Polands then. Or you just don't leave your city.

The main roads are in good shape, because they have to be. Also those financed by the EU. Everything else is made by cutting the costs everywhere (like the OP).

>Type 1 is "partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or the prepuce". Type Ia (circumcision)[39] involves removal of the clitoral hood only. This is rarely performed alone.[d] The more common procedure is Type Ib (clitoridectomy), the complete or partial removal of the clitoral glans (the visible tip of the clitoris) and clitoral hood.[1][41] The circumciser pulls the clitoral glans with her thumb and index finger and cuts it off.[e]

>Type II (excision) is the complete or partial removal of the inner labia, with or without removal of the clitoral glans and outer labia. Type IIa is removal of the inner labia; Type IIb, removal of the clitoral glans and inner labia; and Type IIc, removal of the clitoral glans, inner and outer labia. Excision in French can refer to any form of FGM.[1]

From the Israel's Penal code:

> Denial of Holocaust (Prohibition) Law, 5746-1986

> Definitions 1. In this Law, "crime against the Jewish people" and "crime against humanity" have the same respective meanings as in the "Nazis and Nazi Collaborators Law, 5710-1950.

> Prohibition of Denial of Holocaust 2. A person who, in writing or by word of mouth, publishes any statement denying or diminishing the proportions of acts committed in the period of the Nazi regime, which are crimes against the Jewish people or crimes against humanity, with intent to defend the perpetrators of those acts or to express sympathy or identification with them, shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of five years.

Do you expect me to read these books? Just show me the number of victims.

Even the english Wikipedia I linked says that Gross' sources are bullshit.

Obviously there were pogroms, but Gross is not a good source.
Sonderkommando. I guess the Jews were behind the Holocaust all this time.

^ this is your argument against Poland here.
Aww, shit! Have you guys heard of France? The country of Nazi and Holocaust enablers?

How does it feel?

Btw. you clearly have no clue what the issue is about, so read the god damn Wikipedia at least.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Polish_death_camp%22_controversy
That article is using Jan Gross as a source, the man who can find thousands of victims in a village of 300.

To quote Chief Rabbi of Poland, Michael Schudrich: "Gross writes in a way to provoke, not to educate, and Poles don't react well to it. Because of the style, too many people reject what he has to say."

Blaming Poland for complicity in the Holocaust, probably.
Antisemite. Nice arguments, bro. 

You are an Antipolish, so I guess we have to declare a war on Israel now.
Polish people were the victims, not the complicit. 

Unless you think that Sonderkommando was the Jewish complicity in the Holocaust, too?
You disgust me. Either you don't know anything about WWII history, or you are just a liar. 

6 millions of Polish citizens were exterminated during the Holocaust. Only half of that were the Jews. My great grandmother was also an Auschwitz survivor. 

So, tell me more about Polish complicity here.

You are worse than straight up Holocaust deniers.

But rewriting the history is disgusting.

But I think that living under a totalitarian goverment for 44 years, from the day you were born, leaves a lot of impact on your personality and makes your mindset similar to the one of a slave - you have a hard time living without an iron fist above you.

The full game is subscription based (5€/months), but the only handicap in the free version is the map (it's pretty small there, but you can get a decent level without the sub).

There's also Dofus Touch (completely free) for smartphones and tablets, but I don't like it because it's basically the same game on a phone, and it makes it feel clunky.

Also, you can buy subscription with in-game currency, but it will take a while for a new player.
I don't know. Do you like tactical, turn based games? Like Final Fantasy Tactics? Heroes?
Yeah, the characters :D Sadida, Xelor (controls time), Osamodas (has a whip), Eniripsa (heals)... just read their names backwards.
In Poland we have/had a little bigger community so it wasn't that bad I guess. And my whole town was playing it, too, somehow :D

I was so addicted to this game, it was insane. Dofus all day and night long.

Couldn't repeat that experience with any other game, unfortunately.
Maybe not regularly, but sometimes - Dofus, a French tactical MMO that came out in 2005. Fun, hilarious and available in many languages, with shitloads of popculture references. Still has active hundreds of thousands of players. Shame it isn't that well known outside of France.

It has a spin-off game - Wakfu.

"We are enlightened". Yeah...
You are wasting your time with people here. They are thought-proof.

People on official forums seem to understand how this will work, but here, here's the ignorant shitshow.

People here seem to think that Blizzard will redesign the whole game, like they did with Cataclysm. And these people are not worth discussing with, so let them live in their dreamland.

Let me paste a post from official forums:

They won't do it. They've said that most of their work will be modernizing the server infrastructure.

I guess the other stuff will be modernizing the client for the modern hardware and implementing the game into the Battle.net system.

Modernizing the graphics would be pretty much like making a completely new game, they would have to redesign everything from scratch. It's like they would have to design the Cataclysm all over again, but without the actual cataclysm.

It's simply not doable with a team like that.

PS. That includes the new character models, too. It would just take a second of your time to imagine how stupid and out of place it would look.
They won't. They said that most of their work will be modernizing the server infrastructure.

I guess the other stuff will be modernizing the client for the modern hardware and implementing the game into the Battle.net system.


Modernizing the graphics would be pretty much like making a completely new game, they would have to redesign everything from scratch.
This guy is full of shit. There has to be at least 4 realms, for every gameplay option, and with 1 realm and that many people, the game would be unplayable, because you wouldn't be able to do the quests.
What did I say?
Hopefully you are okay with realm transfers, since they were available since Vanilla.
1000 people hunting for 1 mob doesn't sound so good!
The dude on the painting is working for this PR agency, so if he's friends with him, or have a mutual friend, then yes - he is shilling.
He's working at the PR agency that made this ad, so yeah...
Are you guys fighting even between two PC players now? Jesus fuck.
Me too. I have dozens of playlist waiting to be put on, starting December 6th till 31st.

Also the Christmas category is already up on Spotify.
I think they know that they can't listen to the current playerbase! That's why they are hiring new people who "share the passion for Vanilla" and they are talking with the guys from Nostalrius (possibly they will be hired, too).
It will be connected to BattleTag system, 100%. So Battle.net app.

Fuck the new graphics, it's an unoptimized mess. 

I can't get 60fps in fucking Goldshire with GTX1070 and i5-6600k.

Meanwhile Vanilla runs with 99999fps everywhere.

But that's one thing. The second is that Vanilla graphics make 90% of the game's charm for me.

But it did happen. All the time. Can't you open the fucking link?
Drastic class changes were made in [EVERY god damn patch](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Category:World_of_Warcraft_patches). Why on earth should we settle on 1.12.1? Because it was the last one? Because private servers were running it? WHICH PATCH IS VANILLA?

Blizzard won't do it like that and that's pretty fucking obvious.

Why do people act like there was only one version of Vanilla? Too much private servers?

I don't care if you are Austrian, German, or a god damn nazi. You are probably the latter, though, since according to you over 5 million murdered citizens is not enough to be a victim.

Do you also laugh at black people talking about being a victim of slavery?
Example from this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/75wsxc/european_countries_invaded_by_poland/do9jx4h/
Where did I write about THIS comment? Just CTRL+F "death camp". 

And yeah, "Polish death camps" is not just normalizing, it's straight up Holocaust denial.

But if you don't see a difference between regular war, that every nation since the beginning of the civilization has fought, and war crimes that decimated 5,5 million of Polish citizens, then there's no discussion here. 

I guess you are right, we are not victims.
I'm kinda tired of Austrians and Germans in this sub, laughing at "Polish death camps" and washing their countries' doings. It's becoming normalized around here.

Netflix pushing their original content and testing it in a smaller country first? Maybe.

The Indian movies probably cost like $5 each in licensing, and the Netflix will still be able to say that they have a giant library.

That guy is obviously autistic or something, I've been handshaking with women my whole life. 
I've been Polish in Poland, with Polish everything for 24 years now. This is fucking horse shit.
But he visited Poland, not Jewland. 

He visited a monument, that was made for the fighters of all religions.

Do the Jews really need the exlusivity? My great grandmother was in Auschwitz too, she wasn't Jewish.
As a Polish person, I'm more instulted by comments like yours.
Pieriestrojka. Isn't that a Russian word, though?
Zaskakujące.
Well, the ruling party consists of literally insane people, so there's that.
Man, Polish internet is flooded with Russian paid trolls, even more so than the American internet. They are active even here :/

Ukrainians in Poland bumped the housing prices by 300%.

To be honest, they don't care much about anything, because they are kinda... stupid.
Awful.

No.

I'd be wearing that together with flip-flops, shades and a golden watch 😅

The rest will be similar and the t-shirt will be regular length.

What do you guys think?

Disney buying Star Wars? HAHA! That's INSANE!

The rest will be pretty similar, the t-shirt will be normal length and the shorts will be dark blue jeans.

How is this an argument? What does it even mean in your mind?
So many corporate apologists here! Damn, shilling sure must be hard these days.
And that's why Reddit shouldn't suck corporate cock so hard.

I have a movie that I like, but apparently that's banned on this subreddit.

It's called "La La Land", dunno if you guys heard about it.
I have a retch when I hear that name. Activison-Blizzard, ugh.
The Young Girls of Rochefort so low...

But it's got Catherine Denevue and her sister, Gene Kelly, the guys from West Side Story and is one of the most colorful movies I've seen.

I guess Americans really hate subtitles :P 

And thanks for a nice list, OP.

Obviously. IQ in this thread is so low, I'm suffocating.
These is probably the worst comments thread I've ever seen on /r/Games. Holy shit.
They said they will release OG Polaroid squared format camera in 2017. That will probably affect the wide cameras.
They can be offended. So can be every other human being.
No, he just wanted upvotes for burning them Christians.

I agree though, there should be more songs, they can afford it.

For corporations. And there are shitloads of corporate, anti-consumer shills on Reddit. 

Why do they care so much about corporate pockets instead of their own is beyond me.
Fallout 4 is most definitely the easiest one to get into. It helps that it's also the prettiest.
No.

So is smoking marijuana. Laws can be fucking stupid. Especially when forced by corporations.
How fucked up is that Reddit is so pro corporate and anti-consumer...

I don't give a fuck about your average citizen. Why are you even talking to me?
First of all, nobody wants you here. Second, I don't think you would be able to pinpoint Poland on a map, to be honest. You sound like a retarded redneck.
What are we discussing here? Customer protection laws, no? 

So yeah, you can bet your ass, that customer protection in Poland is top fucking notch. Like it is in the whole EU.
Okay then. You have obviously no idea what are you talking about. And what are you even replying to.
Me no englasso sorray
Sucks to be in the US then. 

I live in Poland, and when I'm getting a product like that, the seller is obligated to give me a new one or give me a refund. And I have 2 years to file that complaint. 
Of course not. They should bend over and take that corporate cock without any lubricant.

https://www.lurkmore.com/view/GNU/Linux_interjection
I'd just like to interject for moment. What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.


Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.


There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!

It's a gimmick. It's fun for 5 minutes. And I don't think disabled people are the market here.
