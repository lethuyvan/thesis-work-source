>	They arent on reddit, heralding you as their martyr.


Yeah you're taking this way too personally.
Made up by the fact that the game costs $10 more on Switch than it ever had.


You're not seriously trying to argue it cost less to make the game from scratch than to port it with an easy mode.
>	Chief among them would be that it costs money to update and improve the game


Not once have I suggested they give the Switch port away for free. Their improvements to the Switch port have nothing to do with the existing Wii U game. 
>	I get that you’re pissed it’s a port but guess what, you didnt build the game the first time and you didnt put the work in to port it over yourself, so you dont get to choose the price.


I'm not pissed that is a port at all, I like that more people get to play it, I don't like that the game will now be available to fewer people. 
As stated, the physical copy is either out of print or will be shortly, as it was before it became a Nintendo select. If I didn't already own it I would have purchased the Wii U version as it's pretty much the same game. I'm upset because this is very clearly a scummy move and I expect much more from Nintendo.


There are many games that I love that I didn't play within the first 5 years of release, there's no reason to pull such a blatantly anti consumer move.
I already purchased the game, that was already stated. 
Nintendo Defense Force out in numbers today.


Yeah I can tell you read none of what I said, keep fighting the good fight though.
I'm a Wii U owner and I'm upset about this. The physical version isn't going to be in print much longer (if it even is). If I didn't own it already I would have gone with the Wii U version given how few upgrades there are and the lower price. Even being on the Wii U the game didn't sell all that well and with this boost in popularity there are people there who would also be interested in purchasing it. This is an absolutely scummy move that makes me less confident in purchasing products from Nintendo given how they're treating their customers. PR actually does matter. 
USB C compliance had been fleshed out for a long time, they chose not to be compliant.
Every company tells people to use first party accessories because they make money on them, that doesn't mean anything. If it uses the USB - C input then it should be compliant with anything that plugs in to it. They could have easily done what Microsoft did on the first Xbox and simply changed the shape of the input if they wanted the benefits of USB without the responsibility.
It was also removed from Amazon, GameStop, and Best Buy.

The Digital version has also just been pulled from Amazon even though it was available all day earlier. I'm assuming that too is some sort of glitch on the same product and on the same day even though it's a completely different company, right?
It's now been pulled from Amazon too after being up earlier today.


But hey, even though they're a completely separate company maybe they're having the exact same database change on the exact same game due to an error by the same person working at both companies at the same time.
>	Or just a weird technical bug.


Using logic your next step would be finding if this has happened to any other games today.


As far as we know it hasn't. So why this specific game? Is there a reason this game would be delisted, or have anything changed at this time on the Wii U when it's been up for years and hasn't needed to be updated?


>	Or human error.


There are quite a few humans this would have to go through, logically a lot of humans would have had to make and approve of this error. Again, logically, why only this game on this day?
Except using logic would lead to the belief that this was intentional.
It's not a jump to a conclusion, it was pulled from the eShop. Not in your region which is managed by a completely different branch, but it was actually pulled from the NA eShop.

No it didn't, it launched years later on the PS4 and Xbox One for the first time specifically as a preorder bonus for this game. It was originally made for PC/360/PS3.
Ideally after hours of doing nothing it should be cool.

Before everyone jumps down my throat, it likely won't damage the console immediately, however heat is never good for the longevity of parts.

If it doesn't work 100% of the time, every time, for every situation, throughout the history of mankind, it's not worth doing. Gotcha. 
The point is that it's a 20% discount, jacking the price up to negate a discount doesn't make it a reasonable price.

Throw a crumpled piece of paper into a garbage can

Now give those people guns and throw that piece of paper into the garbage can from at least 15 feet away

Run away from this game.
So keep breaking the law because I don't ask my friends about their taxes and the government may not penalize me? Gotcha.
It's a used product, there is none.


New or Nintendo refurbish Switch's have a one year warranty
You have to pay sales tax on online orders anyway.


[Don’t think the government won’t come looking for it](https://www.pcgamer.com/some-newegg-customers-are-getting-hit-with-tax-bills-for-past-purchases/)
That works for you, and that's fine if you don't mind it.


But the user I replied to was talking about a stable 30fps. If they couldn't show stable footage in their promotional material, the material that's supposed to be your most polished to entice people to buy your product, that indicates it will not be running at a stable framerate.
There are instances like Skyrim and BioShock where existing owners got the remasters for free.


And they did announce that existing owners would get a discount, before pulling it because it was announced too early.
There is no warranty, only their standard return policy 
The framerate wasn't even stable in the [promotional trailer](https://youtu.be/cri2WsDgBmI?t=5m25s), and it's from the same people who managed to make LA Noire run worse in some spots than the PS3 version.


My hopes are not high.
They made it obvious though
Who the hell is rating house show matches?
I mean it's not really impromptu, they've heavily built up to it
Of course Shane Douglas is on this card
They got Roman over, look at that.
Which sucks for all the build up Sasha and Bayley have been doing

Magic beeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaans
It looked like it was starting as a back suplex then became a uranage, and finished it with a post chokeslam pose
HHH is awesome at making people look like a million bucks before the bell rings.


I loved how he always made Foley look like Cthulhu. 
But Cena is bumping the Cruiserweight championship off the main card


And he beat Balor, so he would fit right into the IC title picture which means he wouldn't bump any matches.


I'm getting too worked up...
Missed opportunity to see El Vagabraundo
I like how the knee was completely buried as a finisher

My router is like 6 feet from my switch and Splatoon will occasionally hit me with a "connection unstable" at full bars on 5GHZ. 
There are people here who sunk 80 hours into WWE 2K18, that's not necessarily a determinant of quality or amount of content
... That's not what mansplaining is
Then again the 5XLs over here criticize guys like Cody's skill constantly and everyone's cool with it.
Nah, it's because he said something negative about a Nintendo Switch game. There are plenty of questions that belong in that thread upvoted because "yay Nintendo Switch yay!"
Steamworld Dig 2 is free to keep on PC right now through Amazon Prime/Twitch. I would claim it before the promo runs out so you'll have it to play whenever you want.
I didn't say he wasn't great at standup, I said he isn't known for it.


He's primarily known for News Radio, Fear Factor, UFC, and his podcast. 
Joe Rogan isn't known for his standup


Edit: people, I know Rogan is a great comic, the point I'm making is that he became famous off of his other projects.
No, you can tell by the 10 other topics on the subject filled with people who feel the same way while every one who doesn't like it is sitting in the negatives. 
That's not on him. They tease making him heel, he hits it out of the park, and then when people start digging it they try to pull a fast one and turn him white meat again.

You must not remember that Dreamer run because they were extremely careful with him, he barely took any bumps

This post is about ports of games available on both platforms

>	How do define worse? 


The same exact game running at lower framerate and graphical fidelity.


>	What might be worse for u is better for others because of portability or the ability to play it while others are using the TV. It’s all about the market.

Portability is a feature of the console, not of the ports that are being discussed. That has nothing to do with the quality aspect you brought up when discussing  these ports and their pricing.

>	If they couldn’t sell the game at the price, they wouldn’t.

You're going off on a tangent and not exactly answering the question, or at least not a question anyone asked. You made a statement about quality, not the market.
You're the one who said "quality over quantity" what extra quality is there for a worse version of the same game?
You don't need a heel to lie or be a hypocrite, you just need them to make the other guy likable.

You purchased a license, you don't actually own anything. They can do whatever they want.


Rockstar updated GTASA and removed a few songs as well for everyone.
7 hours in XC2 would only get him through about the first 36 tutorials.
I own LA Noire, it's a serviceable port and nothing about it makes me confident that the Dark Souls port will be great. The framerate tanks frequently outdoors or wherever lighting and shadows are a big deal and in some areas runs worse than the PS3 Version.


Even the trailer for Dark Souls remastered wasn't running at a stable framerate. If the footage they're using to tell people to buy their game doesn't run well then I have little hope for the final product. I really hope they pull it off though.

You have any examples that have positive scores?
They have killed themselves for years to make Roman Reigns their biggest star, made incredible sacrifices to make him the good guy, and he was suspended for failing a drug test.  


They may not be comprehensive (Jinder Mahal, Neville, Bobby Roode) but if you fuck up you will do the time.
Hang on a ~~minute~~ Bowflex playa
The WWE isn't going to make it obvious that they're only having a women's only show as an afterthought because they were paid off to exclude them in the first place.
That just highlights the reason why there's a women only show.
>	but the question asked probably wanted to know about the USB-C side.

The question is very literally asking about the A port.
At the time they posted that it was at a score of 0 (lowest score a topic can get) after being up for about an hour , so it was being heavily down voted at the time. 
You could tell from the question that this isn't a person who makes wise financial decisions
Yeah the big rectangular one that takes 3 tries to plug in correctly.
Neither is this sale price at GameStop
If it's a C to C connection I wouldn't trust it since they are essentially chargers, and now I'm worried since I have used it. Unfortunately I suppose I'm now stuck using the A port. 
Now hopefully we get Bayley/Sasha added on as well
They also used to own the home console market. Until two companies tried to compete in the past.


They ended up letting those two competitors who never made a gaming console surpass them. [In fact they *directly* contributed to their biggest competitor, Sony, surpassing them.](https://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/the-nintendo-playstation-is-the-coolest-console-never-released-1327988)
You missed the non GCU part of the statement it seems.


Or you really just have an axe to grind
No, they stopped doing that as a matter of policy. You need to play the CSR lotto for that to happen now.
It's $24 at Best Buy with GCU and the same price without it
You're forgetting the most important question


Who killed Biggie and Tupac?
I'm guessing it'll be Becky so she can still get pinned before the night is over
Was that a botch? Becky wasn't the one pinned.

They will let you. Red Dead Redemption is legally available any time you want. Hell it's even on sale right now.


The problem is it's not at the price you want, but to say they won't allow you to pay for it is taking some serious mental gymnastics.


Edit: I'm guessing the everyone's tone would be different if I said I was justified in pirating a game like Hollow Knight, A Hat in Time, or Divinity2 because I prefer to play it on my Switch but they're unavailable and cried "BUT THEY WON'T LET ME GIVE THEM MONEY!"

I forget which WWE Music album it was but on one of them towards the end of the song you hear "The Rock Says he's gonna take your little CD, shine it up real nice, turn it sideways and stick it straight up your candy ass!"
He is a writer on "Whatever"


Besides which the point is that longer songs with varied sections have a place in wrestling.
Then Nintendo should probably subsidize larger carts.
A lot of studios do that, the top three games right now, Overwatch, PUBG, and Fortnite are examples of that along with games like Monster Hunter World, Celeste, the SoulsBorne games, Rainbow Six Siege, Rocket League, Fighter Z.


You should really step outside of the bubble thinking Nintendo is the only company that makes games with an emphasis on tight fundamentals and fun gameplay.


In fact you should watch [the making of Overwatch](https://youtu.be/JcsLQFXzpr4)

>	What happened to creating a great game right out of the box, and then expanding on it too?


The more you can expand, the more you can get people to pay long term.


Their goal is to keep people subscribed to game Pass, they aren't going to give you all the content they can at launch, have people finish it within the month and cancel the subscription. You release something barbones, make promises to fix them in the coming months, drip feed that content, and give people just enough of a reason to say "it's only $10" every month.


That's the thing with Games as a service, you have to constantly give people something new so they can keep spending money.
>	for a fair price,


That has absolutely nothing to do with Games as a Service. 
Again, people don't care enough to. It's not that it's hard, it's not that they're too stupid, they don't want to expend the effort.
Do people really have that hard of a time not scrolling down?

This reads like a bad parody
WWE is generally hands off with the 2K series, that decision likely came from 2K themselves.
I've been playing videogames for about 22 years, Lego Marvel 2 on Switch was the first one to ever give me a headache and slight nausea. It's possibly the low framerate mixed with the motion blur did it but it's awful. Traded it in immediately (for more than I bought it for so it worked out well)

turning Wifi off really doesn't change things much at all, certainly nothing perceptable (on the old firmware, haven't tested the new one)
> They haven't even implemented video capture for that game. 

As someone with over 100 hours in the game, I don't really see the point of video capture in it given how structured everything there is. Everything in the game likely already has a video on youtube.
>	That would be very scummy and hurt their public image, banning innocent users because they wanted to customize their phone

If they give them a clear and direct warning before hand I don't see the problem. If they don't want you around giving them business, don't give them business.
So I've noticed this for the past two days and looked up anyone else who has had this problem. One of the threads had an issue with non-functioning ethernet adaptors in which the fix was to unplug the dock itself for 30 seconds and plug it back in again. I figured it was worth a shot, I just left the Switch in the dock for 3 hours ethernet adapter in place as well, picked it up, and it's cool to the touch.


Obviously will need some more testing, but try that out.

This is promotional footage, you don't put anything out that isn't polished and running and at it's very best.


If they're comfortable using that footage without a large *NOT FINAL* disclaimer then that is reason to be concerned.
If the performance in the promotional footage isn't stable (as they showed it wasn't here) then there's little hope that the released game will be.


Keep in mind the people doing this port also did the LA Noire port which doesn't have a stable framerate (performing worse than the PS3 Version in some areas) and has received no patches.
So when do I get to look at ticket prices and cry?

I can't think of too many examples where they took a game that was already being made and purchased exclusivity. The biggest one I can think of is super hot but in that case the devs actually went *to* Oculus and it was a timed exclusivity agreement.

No, you just happen to be sitting in an echo chamber nowadays.
I know we like to act like this is definitely what happens and shareholders are loldumb, but point blank if it wasn't making money they wouldn't be spending the money to implement it. If shareholders at every company (since all the biggest companies are doing it) were as stupid as they're painted to be EA, Activision-Blizzard, Warner Brothers Interactive, and Square-Enix would have died long ago instead of making record profits.



Just look at their 5 year stock charts.
Pretty good port although framerate can semi-frequently drop into the 20s during sections with heavy lighting and shadows.
Looks like they're only playing one date anyway so I'm guessing it's a really bad scheduling conflict.

Except internal storage is faster than any SD card you can buy, so it's not the same.
As opposed to sporadically crashing, it crashes pretty much during the same introduction sequence before you can get to a save point.


So for all intents and purposes it's an automatic crash since it's guaranteed to occur if you were to care about actually progressing in the game.
The fans are doing that for them
FYI: Nier has received no performance patches [a year after they said they would work on it](http://steamcommunity.com/games/524220/announcements/detail/500303861686743473), still automatically crashes on certain Nvidia GPUs, and a fan patch is still very heavily recommended.

Exactly, which is why this post calling for Nintendo to take action before anyone else gets banned is justified.
Bans on steam don't prevent you from accessing your existing library.
We know, and that's a problem.
>	We dont know, that’s my entire point


That might be your point, but mine is that one should not have access to their all of the games they paid for revoked for any reason because there is always the possibility for an error.
More than two over the past week, however for the ones on the front page today


https://reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/80gz9c/nintendo_account_now_banned_due_to_bayonetta_1/


This is not resolved
It's a complete PR move
The ESRB is run by the publishers, this gets them PR by looking like they care and are doing something without actually doing anything.
And if the ban was due to Nintendo's error? Without a big Twitter and Reddit movement those users banned for no reason would never get the games they paid for back.
You don't need to know the reason to know that beeing banned from one game shouldn't ban you from every digital game you've already purchased. 

Point blank that should not be possible.
Because you can get banned from accessing all of your games due to no fault of your own. Even if you believe this is a misunderstanding, a ban should not ban you from accessing all of your digital purchases.
It wasn't one CSrep, there are multiple people this has happened to. Unless they're giving their lowest level CSReps the power to perma ban accounts then some higher order training is going very wrong and needs to be fixed.


Also the fact that you shouldn't lose access to all of the games you have already paid for should be unacceptable.
Yeah you're missing the point that Nintendo can revoke access to all of your digital games at the click of a button for their error. Something that would not occur with physical games as they are not tied to an account.
Except for everyone in the Manhattan Center, fuck those people in particular. 
>	a physical game. 


Bayonetta 1 is not a physical game, the user was banned for Bayonetta 1. In being banned for that digital game, Bayonetta 1, they were also banned from accessing ***all of their digital games*** that they had paid for.


Thats the point that you missed, is that Nintendo can revoke your access to ***all of your digital games*** because they feel like it, for an error that is completely their fault.
It shouldn't need to take a public shaming on Twitter and Reddit, and luck, for them to fix an error that takes away the games you paid for.
Sure it has some advantages, that's not the point I was making though. It's the idea that "I don't know why anyone would want physical games"


If you scratch your games or you lose them at least you have yourself to blame, in cases like this Nintendo just out right bans you from accessing ***all*** of your games you paid for at the click of a button due to their error.
Because I can purchase both games at Best Buy for less money than purchasing Bayonetta 2 alone on the eshop

As opposed to playing above 30 with a controller, I'm not sure why you're so adamant about this idea of playing a computer at a desk with a "tiny screen" when none of those are accurate.
It's asking how anyone can play at 30 FPS with a controller
I'm not sure what that has to do with anything since the PC natively supports more controllers than the Switch.

He never makes it actually look painful though.
From what I can remember the third and fourth techs were, possibly the second one since she was higher than the first tech but she really didn't know much.
Have my first representative take down relevant case notes and diagnostic stats so that after an hour on the phone my second rep isn't still trying to fix Siri when the problem is that I can't make calls, making me spend another hour doing diagnostics and running through every trouble shooting method again so that notes will actually be taken.

Have that second technician I talked to know what a respring is, or watch the video I took of the actual problem I was having.


Have the third technician I talked to actually call me back when he said he would instead of having my phone ring, listen to a recording say "please hold while we connect you" and then hearing "sorry we're closed" when, again, they were the ones calling me and putting me on hold.


The next day when the fourth technician calls me to tell me the third technician wasn't available, offer something more substantive than "do another restore"


I know y'all want to think I was on there asking for an iPhone X to replace my 6S Plus but that wasn't the case at all. Only one technician I spoke to was actually competent and helpful before he curved me on an issue I would deem as serious. Their main trouble shooting strategy was "wait and see if you have another severe emergency and see if you can call for help again" which is not something you want to hear a day after having your main emergency device fail on you.
Cena is the ultimate babyface and wouldn't face someone unless they were at their best.
Rollins and Cena have great chemistry, this should be awesome
Right, the solution was to wait and hope I didn't have another emergency so my phone could fail me again. Nothing they could have done.


Thanks for the insight. Apparently PR is only valid if it's good for Apple.
What happened happened because a representative for Nintendo decided to play judge and deem the user a cheater. Buying a physical game has nothing to do with it.

The Nintendo Defense Force here is ridiculous.
Also because of cart price
Meanwhile my phone had an iOS 11 bug that prevented outgoing calls related to a Siri/springboard crash the last time I had to call 911 about 3 months ago, luckily I had a landline near by.


Unfortunately Apple couldn't have given less of a shit when I called. Spoke to about 4 people over the course of 5 days and the only solution was to clean restore twice (because it continued happening after the first one) and as a result I don't trust my phone at all if I'm ever in an emergency situation again.
Nothing about 205 live made sense, except for Neville and they fucked that up by breaking his title reign the day of.

>	Had JJ said the N word with a hard R, would you people on this sub had been so quick to forgive him and brush it off? 

Probably not, because that would have been far less likely to be him accidentally tripping on his words. He Said "NBA **chin**e... Fans in **Chin**a" He wouldn't have gotten the same leeway if he said "NBA nig... African American fans" since phonetically it's not even close.


Also weird that you would talk about a hard R when you couldn't even hear him drop a hard K in the original clip.


>Like I said i wont call him a racist but objectively it was an egregious error.


It was an unfortunate error, not an egregious one, though it might have looked like it with the red subtitled text making it seem egregious. Focusing this energy on a guy who tripped on his words instead of actual hardcore racists out there is only causing the opposite of what you wanted in the beginning of your post: diluting the message.

Which is irrelevant when talking about whether or not a game performs well. Yeah it's great they got a very intense game running on a tablet, but if it can't keep a consistent baseline framerate, then it doesn't perform well.
There are people here who say DOOM and LA Noire run great, hell there are even a few people here who say WWE 2K18 runs fine.


 It's hard for me to take "excellent" as "stable framerate"
Your statement falls apart when you realize humans don't fail perfectly every time.


[For example I don’t think Hulk Hogan pronounces “right” and “wrong” the same way, and while "Guy" and "Gay" don't share the same vowel it's doubtful he was intending to calling himself gay](https://youtu.be/o7yP-T3ZCsg?t=84)


It's really weird to see people WANTING to make him a racist here, in the most absurd of scenarios.
He already said he messed up, so what would he be apologizing for when he did nothing malicious? This is actually a case where "I'm sorry if anyone was offended" would actually be the most appropriate statement, but that phrase has been so polluted that in many people eyes it's worse than saying nothing at all.
Because his story is actually plausible and the one that makes the most sense.

"NBA chink fans in China" as a sentence doesn't even make sense, it's reasonable to think he brain farted on the order of his words leading to "NBA **Chin**e[se fans]... Fans in **Chin**a"

If he had said "NBA ni... African American fans" you might have a case since that is much harder to mess up on given how phonetically dissimilar the slur is to the words that follow it.

I wouldn't say that; you can discuss most topics on non-political subreddits without the first comments you see being racist or inflammatory.


On Twitter you're almost guaranteed to see those things with any large community regardless of relevance to the topic at hand.
The thinking it's that because it's a game that on its surface appears would not have a drastic drop in performance, and doesn't have online multiplayer, that it retains all the abilities of the existing versions in addition to being portable.


Whether that actually would have been the case is another matter (source: someone who owns [WWE 2K18](https://youtu.be/vNhleY_RDQI)), but for games where performance, graphics, and online functionality are locked across the board the Switch console has an inherent advantage.
That's Twitter being Twitter. Almost every large Twitter community shows the absolute worst side of people.


They're right down there with YouTube and local news website comments.
I think you're lumping me in with all the people saying they're screwing Nintendo fans over and such and the "two lines of code" contingent.


I'm saying I think it'll come to the Switch once they have fully completed the game and once they have the capital from this release to hire a team like Panic Button or the Chinese studio behind the LA Noire/Dark Souls ports. It's not happening any time soon, they don't have the resources at this very moment, they aren't even thinking about a Switch port at the moment (clearly) and the game runs on an engine that is incompatible, we know all this. If the game had mediocre sales I wouldn't have made the point, but it's selling really well and you don't make more money by having it sit around.


But I'm a business owner so maybe my view is jaded.
I honestly think it'll come to the Switch, but not for at least a year or more after they've finished and released the DLC for every other platform, they certainly aren't paying any mind to anything else right now. Eventually they're going to need more money, they've had a smashing success with the game, the Switch is taking off like crazy, and they can outsource the port while they work on whatever they want to do next. That's just leaving easy money on the table, especially for a digital title.


I'd say this has more to do with the raving Switch fan base on Twitter constantly hounding them when at the moment they have no intention of doing anything with the platform.
