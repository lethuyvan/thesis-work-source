Since you're looking at HDCRTs I'd honestly suggest finding something that isn't an aperture grille. The AG is great for low resolution stuff but gets beat out by a shadow mask when trying to display anything that needs fine detail. If you can find an LG Flatron I would go for that.

But if you're only looking at those two then the KD34XS955 is the superior of the two.

I'm not sure about just any random monitor, but if you can find a decent one that has a pitch of .25mm or less, and a high enough horizontal rate to display at least 1600x1200 with acceptable vertical frequency then it would be better than a 1080p lcd in my opinion. As for finding an FW900 I can't really help you with that, it was an incredibly expensive monitor when it was released so anyone who had one knew very well the value of it, thus it's not something you'll find in a thrift shop.
Shell out for an FW900 I guess. But just so you know, a 4:3 tube can display any aspect ratio with letter/pillarboxing. So even a large 4:3 monitor would be good.
So if I'm reading this right then you're saying this could potentially trigger WW3?

Normally issues that crop up after a cold start and vanish after the heat up phase are capacitor issues. I'm not sure what part of the circuitry you need to work on but this is most likely a capacitor issue.

If that fix is right then it's a relatively simple fix, just replacing a capacitor on the mainboard. If you're handy with a soldering iron and can source a replacement for the part then it's not a big job, but for someone without any electrical experience it's a lot less hassle to just find another TV. If you feel like taking a stab at it here's the service manual which details where the capacitor is.

I don't know. You should probably ask the guy who made it.
That Sony set has a matching stand made just for it. I've got the one for my FS13 and it's great. The FS100 is a relatively common model, so if you keep an eye open for one I bet you could find a stand for it. SU-32FS1 is the one you'd want.
Those aren't PVMs though. The tubes are even detailed enough to see that they aren't vertically flat.

For all intents and purposes it is pretty much the same TV. The only two features I know are different is the FS16 has volume normalization and PIP. Even an FV set would get you minimal upgrades over an FS set. I would just opt with not having to move two 220lb behemoths and stick with your current set.
quite possibly the only good thing in that game!
you appear to have a tiny bit of static.
I have the same set! Aside from Wega specific geometry issues it is an awesome television. Playing games and watching old shows on such a large screen really is worth the effort of having to move it. Eventually I plan on trying my hand at RGB modding it but I want to get a smaller Wega to experiment on first since the FS13 is my baby.
You say that but I'm playing with about 220 dwarves and it's not all that great finding shit for them to do. FPS is about 30-60 as well so playable but not amazing.

It definitely does have component.
It's just leaded glass. I've got a decanter made of the stuff and nobody in hazmat gear has come to take it away from me. So long as you aren't cutting yourself with the broken tubes or eating it you'll be fine.

That particular model does have component and composite. It's a KV-13FS100, probably the best 13" consumer set you'll find.
Make sure you don't mix up dot pitch and horizontal pitch. Sometimes those are used interchangeably.
bad bot
You could at least crosspost, or mention the model, give me a shoutout?
You're either European or not thinking of 4:3 screens. Standard sizes in North America were 13", 20", 27", 32", 36", and in a few cases there were actually 40" direct view sets but I can only think of a couple Sony XBR sets that were this big.
> or get help from someone else to make it happen.

That's a good joke!
My KV-36FS13 without the stand is 220lbs, according to the manual. I'd believe it too, as I was the one who picked it up and put it there. The stand does weigh 74lbs as well, but only a complete nutjob would move this TV with the stand attached. It most definitely is a 36" TV though. The actual tube is 38" but 2" is covered by the bezel to allow for acceptable convergence at the corners.
He could but it would require rewriting large portions of the games code and it's not gonna happen any time soon.
It's one of the latest releases, 44.03 or something.
CNET is not a reliable source of information. It lists pixel pitch as 0.22mm on this monitor when it's actually 0.25mm. What they're looking at is horizontal pitch I guess, but it says pixel pitch.
pfft, I also have a 36" Sony WEGA TV. It weighs about 220lbs.
This monitor can reliably go up to 2048x1536, actually. I don't know where you're getting native resolution from, CRT monitors don't have those. Maybe a resolution it's best suited to considering tube size, dot pitch, and horizontal scan rate. But not a native resolution like an LCD.

[Here's this monitor running at 2048x1536, with the curses_square_16x16 tileset.](https://i.lensdump.com/i/8THvBA.jpg) and [also a close up.](https://i.lensdump.com/i/8THn0q.jpg)
I had temporary walls put up to enclose it then removed them once the room was made.
Well good thing the monitor is the only thing from 1999! This is running on my modern computer. Just requires a passive DVI-VGA adapter, unless you have a GPU from the latest series by Nvidia or AMD. Those no longer have a DAC and can't output analog video.
Glad you like it! I'm a fan of your channel so it's awesome to see you comment here.
The monitor is a 21" Viewsonic P810. A very intimidating beast and quite an appropriate display for Dwarf Fortress considering the grahpics.
I was talking about RGB, like the color model or the video type.
http://dwarffortresswiki.org/Tileset_repository#8.C3.9716
8x16 might be "proper" but it wont look good, even on a 4:3 640x480 display.
No, it should be red, green, blue. RGB, you know?
I always play Dwarf Fortress on a CRT monitor with ASCII and true CGA colours for the authentic look. Just not at 640x480...I've tried, it's possible but not nice to play with. The amount of stuff you can see is incredibly limited compared to 1920x1440.
this is a fucking train wreck of an image...
I don't have any experience outside SD sets that aren't a Sony WEGA so I'd pick either a JVC D-Series or Panasonic GAOO as I hear either of those are high end sets comparable to a Sony.
They say that, but then they just post Spiderman.
They were the people stopping for breathers.
Yeah, that's the one. I loved that shit cause I would always run the furthest. Other people would stop for breathers or something and I'd just be running the entire time. Being part of the running club in elementary and participating in a few marathons really payed off to be honest.
Reddit has a lot of salty nerds that have a bone to pick with everybody they see.
I've had good experience in using just a dualshock for everything. Sometimes I bust out the duke and use that since it's a six face button controller.
I remember your setup from the front page. Really sweet stuff you've got going on.
I think the game just freezes physics objects until they have enough external force pushed onto them, then physics is enabled for it again. Happens in Spengies too.
Nah this game is literally worthless without the online. I just put my disc through the paper shredder and I'm gutting my PS3 to put a raspberry pi into the shell as well.
Get over yourself.
Nice! I was playing it recently on my monitor in 1920x1440 but the interface hardly works in anything other than 16:9.
What you have right now is going to be better than any CRT for CS:GO and I say that as a CRT enthusiast. If you really wanted to try a CRT for this then try to find one with the highest horizontal refresh rate possible and if you can one that has a vertical limit higher than the usual 160hz.

I have the Lacie EBIV 19" and it is a rebranded 930SB. They aren't essentially the same monitor, they are. This is the same case for the 2070SB and the Lacie EBIV 22". Any of those three monitors you have available are excellent options but if I were you I'd be on the 2070SB like a hound. Don't let that thing go if you can!
What about a pool cover?
bring a laptop with [this](http://www.benchmarkhq.ru/fclick/fclick.php?fid=170) installed. geometry and convergence are generally very easy to fix so don't worry about that much, especially with the menu a 2070sb has. I would mostly look out for burn in, the white balance screen is good for that and you can also take a bright flashlight to the tube when it's off and see burn in. I hope it all works out for you, that's essentially one of if not the best VGA monitors ever made.

if possible I would stay for at least ten minutes with the display on. it takes about 30 minutes for a tube to be fully heated up but that's a while to stay in some strangers home so 10 should do. bring the guy some coffee and chat him up about it. ask about the history of the monitor such as when he bought it, what he bought it for, how often he used it, etc.
That's called mis-convergence. Basically, each gun needs to hit the same spot but when it's not converged properly they hit slightly different areas, creating this effect you see. It will always be best in the center of the screen and worst at the corners and edges but should never be as bad as what you're seeing. I don't use PVMs so I don't know if you can adjust their convergence like a VGA monitor or if you need to use the neckrings.
It wont go over 160hz vertical. That's the limit. Some monitors can do 200hz vertical but it's not common and you can only do that at a very low res.
Fake and gay. I can't believe you idiots upvote this shit.
From what I hear they're fantastic Monitors, usually a Sony tube. Try to find a cheap macintosh laptop of the era to do adjustments. There's no OSD so you'll need one.
Do you think it's possible that you might branch into RGB modded consumer sets in the future? Not necessarily as a service, but selling pre-modded sets.
I can understand why one might want this on an LCD in high resolution but on an SD CRT wouldn't you want to keep dithering since it actually serves a purpose?
If you properly vaporize it you'll get a minor effect. Can't recommend it though, might as well vape mint instead.
That looks really cool. I like the chunky look of it.
All of humanity started in the same place and diverged from there. It's not like the Native Americans popped into existence well after the Europeans did.

The idea gets brought up in the CRT community every so often. It's possible that at 8k you could emulate the phosphor look of a CRT, complete with scanlines, but even with OLED I'm not sure you could get an authentic look in terms of fluidity.
That was MSRP obviously. It's a rebranded FW900 from Sony and they go for around $500 now. From what I've been told by people who own them you can't really go back to using an LCD after having one.
I've played around 3000+ hours of ARMA 2/3 and this is bullshit. The effect doesn't change your ability to hit things any more reliably than you normally can. You just need to get good.
60hz isn't actually all that bad it's just LCDs fucking suck at normal refresh rates and have to make up for it with high refresh rate and other things like strobing backlights

source: owning a 60hz 0ms monitor
if we're talking the jump from 120 to 144 or 144 to 200 then you'd be right, but 60 to 144 is a huge difference that any gamer should notice and be blown away by if they haven't experienced it.

Actually you're right. It's been a while since I played on the 915FT+ but the limit was indeed 200hz vertical.
>Also, what's the best crt monitor I can find that has a resolution of at least 1280x1024 (preferably at least 1600x1200)?

Just so you know, any half decent VGA monitor is going to go far beyond that. I run 1920x1440 and they made monitors which could resolve higher resolutions like the already mentioned FW900.

I'm not going to name specific monitors because there's a lot of amazing VGA monitors but I'll tell you what to look for. There's dot/grille pitch and horizontal scan rate. The pitch is essentially how close the phosphors are to each other, from one red line or dot to the next red one. .24mm or under seems ideal with some dot pitches going as low as .20mm but I don't think aperture grilles ever got that low. Horizontal scan rate is the other factor to take into consideration as this is what's going to limit you in terms of resolutions you can use as well as vertical refresh rate. Personally I think 110khz is the lowest you should go unless you really can't find anything. A monitor like that gives you access to a wide range of resolutions ranging from 640x480@225hz to 1920x1440@75hz. But of course if you can find one that goes higher then jump on it, they seem to be pretty rare.

For a GPU just get the best you can that's not from the GTX 10x0 series or Radeon RX line. Ideally a GTX 980 ti or Titan X 2015, but keep in mind that the only performance increase a Titan X will realistically give you is in scenarios where a 980 ti would have its VRAM fully loaded, which doesn't happen often with 6GB. I personally wouldn't get anything from AMD. The software support is not as good as Nvidia and neither is the performance.

When you find one it's worth looking at disabling EDID or bypassing it as the profiles most monitors were loaded with don't give you full access to their capabilities. This can be done easily by using a DVI adapter and removing the pin responsible for it. Some have said this didn't work for them but I've never had an issue with it.

🤔
> If all I wanted was the best color quality with the sharpest pixels then I could get a similar result with an emulator since that's already outputting RGB. 

I do exactly this with my Lacie monitor. It's probably sharper than most PVMs and has obnoxiously thick scanlines in 240p.
Very nice. Sometimes it's nicer to have a big tube than some fancy reference grade viewfinder.

Super Mario World is meant to be stretched as the devs didn't accommodate the fact that the image will be scaled to 4:3. Not all games are like this though, some are designed properly.
Adding onto this, it really helps to keep in mind that CRTs don't have pixels. Each "pixel" on the mask doesn't even need to line up with the pixels the game is displaying.
This must be an elaborate attempt at trolling or you've seriously just stepped foot into internet culture.

There was also a bunch of offshoots like NS-10M, a studio version of that one, the NS-10MM, and NS-10MMT which I have. All are basically smaller with variations in specs but mostly aimed at the domestic hifi market and not studios.
Great setup, very cozy looking. Great speakers too, super jealous of them!

No, seeing as my wobbling is related to unclean electrical I get no wobble at 60hz, regardless of resolution. The wobble only happens in regards to refresh rate and since I'm in NA my house is 60hz power, hence why I get wobble in other refresh rates and not in divisible ones like 120hz. At a certain point it becomes such a fast wobble you can't notice it, which is around 130hz. This is my understanding of the situation at least, and it has been a thing through FOUR different monitors and happens in any outlet.

Glad to hear you got your image looking good though. You should make a post with some pics and share the beauty these monitors produce. :)
60hz as anything else gives me wobble in the corners, something relating to my houses electrical. I need a power conditioner...
Yeah, you could even order them with a hood and calibration puck.
It is my camera, yeah. It would be great to have a DSLR to snap some pics of my CRTs but I only have my cellphone to use. The colour on this monitor is actually fantastic in person, it's no wonder graphic designers used these.
Sure, was there anything in specific you wanted to see? I don't mind doing requests if you want to see a certain game or something but you'll have to wait a bit as the Lacie is sitting on my desk right now.
Didn't come with a stand but for such a beautiful monitor I'm easily able to overlook such a minor detail. When I said that P810 was sharp I don't think I knew what sharp meant because holy crap this thing is crisp and colourful! 
I can't imagine why a blue iv 22" would be blurry at 1600x1200. I just got the 19" version today and it's the sharpest image I've ever seen at 1920x1440.
This is the best way, funny enough I just got a lacie iv 19" today from one of my wanted ads. I'll make a post about that one soon.
In regard to that second picture, I've noticed in my research of this monitor that the manual and pretty much all sources will list the P810 as having a horizontal frequency of 95khz, except for Cnet which lists it as 110khz. I was a bit confused about this before I picked mine up and found that this one is most definitely 110khz.

But after a bit more research I found out that there's around six revisions of this monitor and one of them, the P810-4, is the 110khz model. I noticed that in all the pictures I've seen online of this monitor the power button is right against the status led and the menu buttons are shifted more to the right as opposed to being centered like mine.

So in short, if anyone finds a P810 and is thinking about getting it but isn't sure if it's the good model or not just look to see if the power button is shy and off on its own.

But yeah the monitor itself is amazing, really sharp even at higher resolutions like 1920x1440 and 2048x1536. The size is incredible as well, it's like a small TV. Gaming on it is quite a treat, especially when you play a twitch shooter like CSS at 1024x768 120hz. The size really makes spotting targets easier than on my previous 19". Unfortunately though mine has some noticeable burn in of what looks like a Windows 98 desktop, but it's only noticeable on very light backgrounds.
eh, I guess other people didn't appreciate my attempt at humour...

you're condensing the image into a smaller area with smaller tubes which essentially gives a sharper image. nothing at all wrong with the larger sets though. both a 13" and a 36" are still just displaying 480i/240p after all, only a higher tvl count would counteract this.
the game is paused so the fps jumps to the maximum until you unpause and calculations resume.

It was a shitty situation which was poorly handled on both ends but people are seriously upset over the outcome of the trial which is where the outrage comes from. I don't blame them either, but at the same time a lot of people are crossing a line.

Even in the 90's I don't think anyone had cool cases, [Alienware](http://i.imgur.com/SU2TG.jpg) certainly didn't. You paid for guaranteed hardware compatibility, drivers setup, game installation, etc. You must have been pretty smart if PC building was easy in the 90's cause I don't know anyone who holds that opinion. Windows 98SE was a bitch to work with most of the time.

Also, it's weird how you replied to that right as I checked Reddit for the morning.
Alienware was founded in 1996...
This isn't an LCD, a near null response time is definitely possible.
Back when building a PC wasn't "lego for adults".
Heh, I have a flyer from Alienware that's from 1999.

It's already a classic even though tons of people are still using theirs. The PS3 may have had a graphical edge in some cases but the 360 cemented itself as king with impressive library it had. Don't get me wrong, I own both and love them both, but the 360 really had an edge even without free online.

If only it was as easy as looking it up on ebay and ordering one, like it is with a pvm. High end vga monitors seem to be stupidly rare. Where did you find yours?
Dot pitch and horizontal refresh rate are the two biggest things to keep in mind. Maximum vertical refresh rate is also good to look at but rarely goes below 160hz on decent ones. I personally wouldn't buy anything from before 2000 unless it's a higher end model of at least 100khz+ horizontal refresh rate. Ideal dot pitch really depends on the resolution I guess, but anything below .27 is good.
Just a PAL version of the SNES. They could have made the whole wall out of them and it'd be no loss.
'til is not correct anyways, till would be the correct way to write it. till predates the word until and is a word of its own.
which is why special effects were so great back in the day. 480i can only give you so much detail so you can easily hide things like this.
What they're really saying is "Don't forget we're still a thing, 2077 is totally gonna come out...in like five years..."

I grew up in a rough neighborhood, attended a shitty high school I dropped out of, I made mistakes I regret now. If you truly believe people can't regret things they did over a decade ago then you're probably a worse person than them.
I doubt I can explain it to you.
Only if you care about having a plastic box and disc, which is idiotic.
Game stores that specialize in older games like NES, SNES, Genesis, N64, ETC, are a fucking scam. I can just download this game to a HDD on my Xbox, the developers wouldn't get my money even if I bought this copy anyways.

I'd never heard of it being in Xanax up until now but I've had people outside the drug scene try to imply it was in ridiculous things like cigarettes and marijuana so whenever I hear people say something was laced with it I'm skeptical due to how sensational it has been made out to be.
I can't even tell if this is sarcasm or not when everyone seems to think everything is laced with fentanyl nowadays.
It's evidently the gamers who missed the point since people are still talking about buying and playing the game.

You can go as low as 640x480 using conventional refresh rates and as low as 240p when you double up the refresh rate. [Here's](https://imgur.com/a/0agWz) an album I made demonstrating it on my monitor. If you're interested in doing this yourself it's as simple as making a custom resolution that's 320x240@120hz, which brings it to a 31khz signal. A more detailed [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/crtgaming/comments/675u6g/guide_how_to_run_retroarch_in_240p_on_your_vga/) was posted on here, check it out!
> because that is the first time that they determined that CRTs emit ionizing radiation.

the first line of this page already contradicts you and you should look into the "Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968" because it's been well known for a very long time that CRT emits radiation other than light.
It's more likely we would have seen SED technology take over if it weren't for patent bullshit. CRT was at end of life, LCD or no LCD.
no. parts are replaceable but nothing is upgradeable in the way you're thinking.
that's a pretty bold claim considering how long CRTs were used compared to LCDs. even at 50hz you wont see "Irreversible damage", otherwise most of europe would be nearly blind. got a source to back up these claims?
there would be no scanlines here. that's strictly a 240p thing in all technicality.

> It also might help with your depression

> I'm not saying that you'll be cured of it by eating vegetables

It really wasn't hard to find links between diet and depression.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2738337/#CIT42

Did you ever speak to a dietitian in your therapy and counseling? Because they would be the one to talk to you about this, not a therapist or general practitioner.

But let me say it again before you keep insisting there's no link. I am not saying vegetables or a balanced diet will cure you of anything, but it's the first step in leading a healthy lifestyle alongside exercise.
Are you trying to tell me a healthy diet wont do something for depression as opposed to eating a constant supply of fast food and junk food? I'm not saying that you'll be cured of it by eating vegetables, but a proper human diet will certainly contribute to good mental health.
lol this is a mini-itx board
ARPANET was funded by the US Department of Defense and essentially run by the US Military but used by researchers. A lot of things you simply couldn't use it for as it was highly illegal, things like personal profiteering and anything politically motivated. It's obvious they wanted it for military purposes aside from letting universities test it for them.

As with any Wega it's going to likely have worse geometry than a same size black trinitron. Wega's are known to have at least one poor corner that is mostly hidden in overscan but they can also have other common problems like a dip in the top or bottom, pin corner problems at top or bottom, and sometimes a weird wave on one side. I've uploaded an [album](https://imgur.com/a/zg6DI) of all the pics I have of mine, but I no longer have that set.

Nice enough set I guess, but like any CRT they're not without problems and for a lot of these FS120s the problems can be quite annoying.

The only way this would be worth posting here is if it were like that one european youtuber who hacked an aio cooler on a rx 480 the day it came out without a purpose made bracket like in your pic.

It's not really on the level of a lot of posts here but I was in a bar on St. Paddy's day and struck up a conversation with two older gentlemen, one of them being Irish. We were having a good time shooting shit back and forth such as how the bartender couldn't poor a Guinness if his life depended on it (he seriously couldn't) and after a few drinks the Irish guy reaches over and starts caressing the inside of my leg. I had no idea up until then that this guy was gay and totally looking to bring me home but I didn't end up going home with him cause I'm not into older men. Kind of creeped me out because I'd never actually had a man hit on me like that before, especially in such a physically aggressive manner. He did buy me a bunch of pints though so it was overall a good time except having my dick caressed through my pants by an older man.
He's right though, there's zero connection between this act and being Canadian. For all we knew he just thought the script was garbage and wanted to pass the role onto someone else. But no, let's prop ourselves up and pretend we're superior people!
What exactly makes this a "totally Canadian move"? Do you people never get tired of patting yourselves on the back so much because you were born in a certain country?

had a white friend who wanted what he called "natural dreads" and when he had them it was most certainly matted clumps of gross hair. kinda suited him though because he was a huge fuckin hippy nature freak. afaik matted dreads are a white person thing which makes the whole "cultural appropriation" thing a huge joke.

Payday is another game like this believe it not. It's not zombies but you have four people and wave after wave of cannon fodder with unique enemies who have their own abilities thrown in. Same dealio as Killing Floor though, sequel ain't so great until recently I hear.

yep, that's why I made sure to put the insane part in there. what's even more insane is that some people think that the idiotic sjw's out there actually represent the left. I also like to call them the alt-left because it seriously triggers them to be put in the same bracket as the alt-right.
give me the rundown
Either or both. Knowing Reddit though, this guys whole family will be dead but they'll leave him alive and give him a new car or something.
So, I've always wondered, as a ginger am I considered white by the insane left or am I a minority?

for a second I thought your post said red light district near the jedi temple
You should read up on all the past witch hunts and how horrifically they've ended.
Not really, but keep thinking we're some fantasy land cause it makes us look good.
yeah and her chin too apparently
To be fair though, you shouldn't be taking selfies while driving. But yeah, people do suck and not just on the internet.
If anyone were to do that it would be Unilad.
I don't remember Russians in Halo:CE...
yes also this. it's amazing how much DF relies on RAM tbh
don't you have a blm rally to go to?
so anything with the latest i5 or i7
technically yes, but the stages never separate. 
nope, you only get the \ next to z and an altgr on european keyboards, in north america we don't have that unless you're like me and bought a gaelic keyboard used cause you didn't check the layout very well before buying it
I had to do something similar once except instead of tape we cut a length of cat5 and used sheet metal screws to secure the cable to the screen and base, just like this guy has with the tape.
I can't even play this game anymore because of the tickrate, it's just too bad to consider playable. It's like playing at 15fps but everything is actually smooth yet the lag is there still. It drives me fucking nuts. 

Oh, and btw back in my day [this](http://www.dayzoverlay.com/img/scopes/mildot-dmr-guide.png) is what we did to rangefind with our scopes.
This isn't Arma, you just point and shoot then watch the bullet land behind them due to the 7 tickrate servers.
This is beyond dumb. I knew they were wonky to begin with but holy shit this is bad.
Only having to tighten your job over a multi million dollar error doesn't sound bad.

Hold my meme, I'm going in!
Who cares? These dudes play a game where this shit happens and they know it. If they're gonna get paid as much as they do they'd better take some entertaining fucking hits.

If you're holding personal data of possibly billions of people then what he described is the only sane and responsible route to take. In the described situation though nobody is getting your privacy. I can't pay Google to have them tell me your favourite music, but I can pay them to target you through their in house ad service IF they deem me as being interested in what I want to promote. I don't get your information, Google got my product information and uses their gathered information to target you for the ad.

As per your example you've obviously misunderstood how this works. You already signed your privacy away to Google but in that agreement you agreed that only Google gets to fuck your privacy. If you want to avoid this then start falsifying your information online, disable scripts in your browser, use alternative search engines such as duck duck go, install a secure operating system such as Qubes OS, etc...
Sorry, what? You came in asking me off topic shit when I wanted to know how Google is irresponsible with people's data and privacy. I'm not upset and I have no idea why you think I am.
I'll let you work that one out on your own. I still haven't had my original question answered.
So because users fuck around with their own privacy by giving all their information to Google hand over fist Google is fucking around with the user's privacy?
How exactly does any of that imply that Google isn't responsible with peoples privacy?
It's indian food and you hate that shit cause it destroys your bowels.
To be fair I was using it both ways.
okay so it's like the restaurant only serves blooming onion in a four course meal and that's all you want so you pay for the four course meal cause they didn't offer blooming onion alone and you might be able to get it on its own in another year or maybe never but you want it now.
can you make that a food analogy for me? I have no idea what van buren is aside from being the codename for a potential fallout 3
someone who wants to watch that band? if you put opeth in a show with literally any assortment of idiots given instruments I'd be there just cause you said opeth is there. it's not like I can pay to just see that one band any time I want.
> I hate those losers, don't even know what a good deed is. They aren't even aware how pathetic they are a for tiny bit of cash.

some people just really don't give a shit my dude. good deeds make some people feel funny inside but cash is a real thing that can get you a lot more.
yeah it's weird how some people have different taste, like me personally I'd have left as soon as metallica started playing. fuck that overrated shit.
I like how your word of choice for that was soju. You sound like my kind of guy.
It normally only takes one...
nice
I was half expecting some asian dudes tiny hand
you do sound pretty autistic when you put it like that tbh
Something is very off about the font used for the time and battery percent.
I'm confused too, that didn't look like a street to me.
Even for a curved screen shadow mask you're 20lbs shy of average weight for a 32". I would be skeptical about 90lbs but 80lbs sounds unreal.
That's cool but you should install Gentoo.
Not happening without a spark. You can find many recorded attempts of people trying to ignite gasoline fumes with a cigarette, even some doing exactly what you say. Stats say it should ignite but it doesn't.
100hz gets hate for the same reason HDCRT does, it takes the analog signal and converts it into a digital signal then back into an analog signal before displaying it. This introduces a lot of lag. They also don't do 240p/480i natively. If you play 480p games they're great though.
Not saying you're wrong at all, just saying that a cigarette wont ignite gasoline under real world conditions.
Not gonna lie, I fell for that too.
The trick is also to have something hot enough to ignite the fumes. Something that is not a cigarette ember.
Ah shit, I totally forgot about that. Thanks for reminding me lol
It's very likely that the whole kerman thing is a reference to him.

They probably make up more than 15% of South Korea's government too.

That requires butchering some poor super-fx cart, so let's hope not and people can play it on a flashcart or something.
I do, but that's what the guy was referencing and thus that was his source. I'm not saying clenching your asshole gives you colon cancer or something, I'm just saying the guy literally fucking said "I read in this book once..."
Did you read the first sentence?
you butcher the ones with undesirable traits because they are unfit for breeding or war.
pfft, you're joking, right? dwarves bring their babies into battle!
Really makes you wonder what ancient people thought when their power grid was knocked out by a solar flare.

Cut the wire and attach a coaxial port is what I'm saying, or open the case up and cut the leads going to the 2.5mm port and jury rig a coaxial into its spot.
Quit driving high you dope heads! This is coming from someone who likes to burn trees once and a while. This shit is not okay!

quit browsing facebook if you don't want to see literal human garbage try to communicate with the rest of the world
Is it a 2.5mm jack with two poles? Also, IIRC VHF/UHF has one signal and ground, so if you cut this wire and attach a coaxial port on it then it will probably work fine.
If you're gonna quote ebay prices here's my advice, put it on ebay! I'd give you your $35 back for it though.
It's VHS/UHF as it says. They can use any connector they want but that doesn't change what it is.
Do I need to go through nearly three decades of experiences in Canada or should I just leave it at one anecdote? I guess people should never talk about their experiences with a place unless they did a full profile and background check of every person there.
Not up here. Call them that and you get some very confused looks and someone will ask if you meant timbits.
When did I compare it to any other country? I said the people are generally good. Go take your casual racism somewhere else.
Thanks dude, I work out and I'm glad to see it's starting to pay off!
Well I've spent my entire life in this country, that's one simple anecdotal story. I think I can judge my own country, thank you!
Had my wallet fall out on the bus as I was leaving one time, a guy grabbed me by the shoulder and I was ready to knock somebody out cause he did it quite suddenly but he was just giving me my wallet back before I got off. Canada has issues but the people generally are good people.
That looks pretty good, I'm sure most of us can live with the sun being the same since modding it is apparently impossible or a huge pita.

Also, I'd just like to say that you're doing a great job at communicating with your users as well as taking in feedback!
All light completely gone. Total darkness except for what you make. DX11 or the skybox changes broke it from what I remember. That's not what I would want though, just something really dark like you're incredibly far away from any star.
I enjoyed smoking while I did, which was for five or six years. Cost is what made me quit, not my health.
So take five year breaks is what you're saying. Got it.
When you're comparing two things that are bad for your health neither is "better" for you.
I myself would be very interested in a darker version of the mod. My favourite mod in the past was this one that completely removed all light from the game except from lights you built and the suit flashlight. It was hard to play but extremely atmospheric and satisfying. Having something that does a similar thing would be nice and you seem to be capable of doing a good job at something like that. I'm not really in the know on modding SE but from what I've read modding the sun is something that's either tricky or just not possible right now, but I do remember having a skybox that placed the sun quite far away, compared to normal at least.
Thank you for posting this, I've wanted something that does exactly this but haven't found anything until just now. Is there any chance you'll be making other versions, such as a significantly darker one?
In my area they don't even have their own employees to do this shit, they contract it out.

RPTV are rarely if ever worth it. It's more hassle than it's worth.

This is actually fucking funny though. Ya'll got no chill.
Everyone is bitching about gender reveal parties and I'm just here wondering how the fuck they think they're going to clean all that confetti and glitter up or IF they will even attempt it.
But an RX 460 does not have a DAC, so what displayport can or can't do doesn't matter.

PC monitors seem to be a lot harder to find. I put up a wanted ad and got a few leads, I suggest you do the same.
Not a video but the nexus page for dark souls item randomizer tells you how to install it. If you want I can make a video where those instructions play out onscreen and there's about 5 minutes of filler before it gets to the point. Oh, and some shitty rock music will play in the background too.
I too like shards of shell in my nut dust.
Regardless if it works or not you need to contact Ebay right away, along with the seller, assuming you get this off Ebay.

As others have said you've probably got a cap replacement job on your hands but I just wanted to say that you should look into your vertical linearity cause it seems the top is a bit bigger than the bottom.

That's a really desirable set you got. Component on a 13" consumer set is pretty rare!
tbh I don't think I'll be dating any girls ;)
Blurring near the edges is normal, this is what the sharpness setting is for. It was previously known as velocity modulation and I would advise you keep it on low at most. Sadly the WEGA sets all seem to suffer from flatscreen geometry issues which is no surprise. My KV-27FS120 had some kind of wonky geometry as you can see [here](http://imgur.com/a/gkb6w).

I'm not sure what you mean by the lines thing or tail, but it could be the picture tube picking up background radiation and stuff since it has no incoming electrons.

There's nothing wrong with the concept itself and if OP just linked [this](http://3d-bear.tumblr.com/post/164031451385/nintendo-consoles-through-the-generations-had-the) it would be fine. The problem is how OP made this post and all the random misinformation in the comments. A more appropriate title would have been "models of the Nintendo consoles as if they were rendered on themselves."
looks like bad caps, no comment on the menu problem though
I don't think he's saying iced coffee is the problem. It's portion sizes in America and this leading to people having a skewed perspective on what a normal size is. If you tell people this is a small iced coffee they'll think it's okay to drink one of these a day because "it's just a small iced coffee once a day!." This carries over into more than just coffee.
Let's not pretend Canada doesn't have its share of fatasses.

I remember when I was younger I came up with this idea that eventually black holes sucked everything up and each other until everything was condensed into one black hole which collapsed upon itself and this just keeps happening with big bangs here and there.
that looks more like an interlaced image than 240p
it's probably just getting old, you're going to need to adjust the g2 voltage it sounds like. to do this you'll likely need inside the thing as it's generally a pot on the flyback iirc
It's going to work for old stuff like Windows 98 and before then but will be practically useless for anything other than emulating on a modern system. Plug it in and take pictures. If it doesn't work then it doesn't work.

You know you can use the word "they" and it wont make you sound like a visitor from tumblr.
The real gore here is using piriform software...
I'm curious, what is a PMS?
It's a neat little set due to the control knobs on the front but it only does composite and VHF so you wont get the most amazing picture out of it. Like I said, standard consumer set but this one is old.
Not as good as the OG Xbox unfortunately, but it handles 480i and 480p fine. Anything above and it tends to lag out, at least with WiiMC.
Looks like a standard consumer set. If you haven't got one then it's a free trinitron, right? BTW a model no. would be nice to know.
At this point the only thing I could think of would be localized phenomena.
I think you should try it at another location, like not in your house at all. If you've got a detached garage or could try at a friends house do that. To be clear this happens on all games you've tried?
So it happens on multiple displays, cables, consoles, and it happens when using a UPS? Unless I'm forgetting something you've changed every variable except location.
It's worth noting that Diamondtron tubes literally are aperture grilles, so not only do they come close to a Trinitron they pretty much are one.
Those BNC connectors are misleading. It's still just VGA but using BNC connectors. My 915FT+ has the same connections but you can't use them for consoles as it's still 15khz signal on a 31khz tube. I don't know much about the Retron 5 but I know it uses HDMI so it's going to be a hassle to get working. You'd be better off just emulating stuff at 240p on the monitor.
That's a good one. The geometry on it looks pretty good too!
A 27" isn't that bad. It's only 100lbs. I just got the same model but 36" and that's something you bring a friend or maybe two for.
Mine feels just like all the other buttons. Dunno if there's multiple revisions but mine is from launch.

I have the 27FS120. It's an alright TV but mine has some really bad geometry  and corner convergence isn't great either. I hardly notice while gaming however.
Something tells me they didn't just take them outside to take those pictures...
Refer your father to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiation_Control_for_Health_and_Safety_Act_of_1968) article. A PVM especially would be putting incredibly negligible amounts of harmful radiation as they're entirely encased in metal. If your father smokes then you might do well to remind him of the radioactivity of cigarettes.
It's generally called light.
That's what happens in SE when you do large scale explosions. Try it yourself, the game just can't handle it.
wat
> im hoping rubber gloves will save me from any shock

and OP was never heard from again
I do believe I said otherwise. But if you wanted the best CPU for emulating PS3 I'd go for a CELL CPU.
> hope to see some of your ships on the workshop!

Don't hold your breath!
I never really implied they hold thrusters explicitly but I feel as though putting any functional components that aren't redundant in a nacelle is just asking to lose it. Decoy nacelles are a very good idea though.

When I said thruster cluster I was referring to the spots on the ship that are grids of thrusters.
Thruster clusters are a liability, you should try to avoid nacelles as well. It looks like you've got a nice concept going otherwise, just get to adding greebles.
It's mostly down to IPC and the 4790k was a flagship of two generations back. It would be an ideal CPU for emulating. Basically as long as it's not a pre-Ryzen AMD CPU or a pre-iX Intel CPU you're good.
Undead are simply amazing for target practice. They're like the new danger rooms but only for marksdwarves.
is it running 240p or 480i?

haha chrome XD
It is?
No, I use it to make sure dwarves are dying of old age and not something more FUN when it happens. You just need to retire your fort for things to show up.

Yes, but it's part of the appeal of his channel. You'd be blind to say he isn't.
Recently? Ahem, when has Intel not been doing shady shit?
That and they're huge compared to LGA. It's a lot harder to even bend a CPU pin in the first place.
why even buy the air 240 if you plan on doing that? the main appeal for me was that it looks good like this.
Virtual machines.
It's also a good idea to run a CPU benchmark beforehand to heat up the thermal paste, something like Prime95. If it's still not 
coming off easily you should soak floss in isopropyl alcohol and pull that between the heatsink and CPU.
That is a lot of dogs.
You ever try to fix a bent pin on a CPU? It's easy as hell and can be done with something you have in arms reach of you right now I bet.
It doesn't and I'd be surprised if OP gets a replacement. This falls under user fault even when it's not because it's so rare.
should have gotten them a ps2 with sims 2
We're talking about Tarantino here, not Kubrick.
Not the Hammerheads though, and for good reason. Even Razer knows that was a shitty product.

This is OCZ RAM.

I don't use uLaunch, but basically what I'd like to be able to do is install games onto the HDD from USB just as winhiip would. I've got HDLoader but I'd rather not use it to preserve my laser.

hell yes, I do it all the time. it was a lot easier before, in fact I barely used heat shields in days of old.

Yeah, the motorcycle hit her, but she stopped in the lane of a highway which is an extremely dumb thing to do. It wasn't for a good reason either, it was because she wanted to bring these ducks home. It's not like she pulled off onto the shoulder, she stopped in a lane.

So would the rest of us over at /r/crtgaming.
It's still around. Arkham Asylum or w/e it was called used it and so do some other games. It's just not really worth adding to a game since only Nvidia cards support it. You can even have two Nvidia GPUs and have one run as a dedicated PhysX card.
Still better than the dumb spiritual successor to that series.

Edit: AC fans salty
It's what was on the supposedly not working HDD that the idiot wiped. Those HDDs are formatted in a file system not capable of being read by Windows, believe it or not. So when he plugged it in to see what was on it Windows just told him that it couldn't be read because it couldn't.

We have no idea what was on that HDD and now we never will. It could have been very helpful to the future of Xbox emulation. If you want an example of a better outcome to a scenario like this then look at the Xbox dev kit that has an unfinished and cancelled South Park game.
My Microsoft Sidewinder controller still works with the appropriate gameport to USB adapter. How fucking hard can it be?

I smoked for five years before quitting and only once in that entire time did I smoke where my computer was and it felt very wrong.
It's Heineken, no beer was wasted.
Molex adapaters? Those cost a lot. I just snip the molex connector off and solder the wires directly to the HDD power leads.
Naw, let's just keep using the PSU that burnt out the HDD.

If your set isn't a no-intro set then I suggest you [look into it](http://www.no-intro.org/). It's pretty handy to have.
There was a lot of unofficial releases then, cause my no-intro set is 1,961 files total. That's just the .zip files too. If you go inside each one the total increase to 3,497. But that includes the bios files and other various things like regional releases for each game.
haha, correct on a technicality. this is the best way to be right about something.
glad i'm not the only one triggered af by the title
or, y'know, any game other than the 21 the snes classic has. (not including star fox 2 right now ofc, but we'll get a rom dump)
ps3 looked at the "no gaems" meme and said hold my beer. buying it just for demons souls would be the gateway drug to an amazing library

I worked at a beer vendor once. 10 a day is fuck all compared to what some of my regulars could do, and I know for a fact it was just them drinking them. Some guys came in and bought 30 packs a day, and they'd come in early in the morning each day.

Resolution has nothing to do with it. If you export a JPG image you can choose the quality it gets exported at, go and try it. Now export two JPGs from a high quality image and do one at 70 then one at 40. You will see what's called compression artifacts, such as in this image around the text in the green bubbles.

Dead graphics card and a motherboard with bent pins makes for a fun troll image. Some of you are questioning how someone could be stupid enough to do this, I'm questioning how anyone is stupid enough to think this isn't a joke.

Like I said, top right two pins. Check all your motherboards, if it isn't there then that manufacturer fucked up and needs to quit that shit.
In my experience it's always power led then power switch on top row, then hdd led then reset switch on bottom row. I've tripped a lot of headers with a flathead screwdriver and it always works for me. This is the same on my current motherboard all the way back to my socket A motherboard. I only ever need to know where the power switch is anyways, all that other stuff is just extras.
America is so fucked.

Most of the shit you see SJWs spew about this subject is retarded nonsense but the kernel of it all makes sense. Basically your sex and gender are not the same and your "mental gender" is going to sit somewhere on a spectrum and it is fluid in most cases. This is very much like sexuality where it's not black and white, it's not just hetero, homo, and bi. Your sexuality is somewhere on a spectrum between hetero and homo. You can be born a male but your personality might not be explicitly masculine even though you are a male.

This is fine, but what's not fine in my opinion is when people feel the need to cement their mental gender to their physical sex. If you're born a male and you have a feminine personality that's fine and dandy, I wont think less of you, but that doesn't mean your dick needs to be lopped off and a gash needs to be cut in between your legs. That's not to say gender dysphoria isn't a real thing, but it's not nearly as common as people make it out to be.
Ya'll need to step up your game and memorize the order they go in.

acronyms definitely are more fun than keeping track of all the operating systems that were around in the 80s to 90s
They do, look into it and you'll realize that DOS stands for disc operating system and that what you think of as DOS is actually Microsoft DOS, or MS-DOS.

The load command is used in DOS 3.3 to load something from the disc into memory.
It's not like AC is a new series. If you buy that edition then you've probably played each AC game in and out and have past collectors editions, so it's really no different than the autistic amount of money people spend on lightsabers and other nerd memorabilia.
I had a temporary teacher in the fifth grade who would talk about her migraines and depression very often. She was also very short tempered and would yell at her classes a lot because she simply could not handle children.

Not any strenous load, there's a line. Like I've got a retro PC that has an Athlon 4200+ and a GTX 280 which will run damn near anything you throw at it. But if I load Crisis then I can get about two seconds into the game and the computer will shut down because the PSU is a 500W and it needs more than that under full CPU and GPU load.

I suggest you put your specs into [this](https://outervision.com/power-supply-calculator) and see what your power draw is. Bear in mind that a PSU can degrade over time and lose some output, so a 550 might not be putting out 550 after some years.
How does Stardew Valley run on that?
Are you sure that's not power draw related?
Do this and disregard CCleaner. Never trust a program to delete files for you, that's your own job.

Last Sony console I bought was a PS3 when the slim came out. I mean from an outside perspective I've heard nothing about it.

Edit: I guess it's true about sonyponies being a salty breed.
and yet I've heard nothing about it other than the buzz around launch.
People keep saying this, but I have a 6100 and I think that it's bad advice to give unless the person knows they don't need a decent CPU.
Now I'd like to see Mr. Torvalds' opinion on this. That would probably be entertaining.

Shit happens. You can go buy a new top of the line Sony 8k VR Surround vision television and the speakers might not work. Everything ever made has defects and faulty units.

My Corsair water cooler worked perfectly for the year I had it and it's still running strong in my sister's PC. So I think that this guy either got a faulty unit, which happens, and overreacted or he's an idiot and fucked himself but wont admit it.

It's due to trinitron tubes being pretty much exclusive to Sony sets. All Sony models use it AFAIK so it's not so much a model that they buy as it is a certain brand. It's not just them that do this either, pretty much anyone who is an avid retro gamer wants a good trinny.

The reason they're desirable is because a trinitron tube uses an [aperture grille](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/30/Shadow_mask_vs_aperture_grille.jpg) to guide the electrons onto the phosphor coated tube, as opposed to the shadow mask method of other tubes. This method produces a sharper image. At least this is why they're used over other CRT sets. CRT in general is used because it doesn't upscale the image from the native resolution, which would cause a great deal of input delay.
Thank god a deguass function exists. I put my bluetooth speaker under my CRT monitor while it was off and forget about why you don't do this. So a few days later I pick it up and suddenly a quarter of my screen is inverted in colour, which is funny cause it's usually the other way around but I guess since it was there before the monitor turned on the yoke adjusted for it? idk, but deguassing fixed it immediately which was a relief cause I'm not interested in strapping magnets to a drill.

Not at all what I'm saying. What I'm saying is you shouldn't try the "he was only accused of it!" shit when it's plain as day the man was guilty.

That's a pretty fucking broad generalization there, bud.

Not really related to anything at hand but for the first 500 or so hours I didn't know quicksave existed. All my missions were done in one run and if something messed up, even if it was something like a botched landing at the end, I would restart and do it again.

Now that I know about quicksave I still do that for most things, but I've gotten very good at doing sanity checks before leaving the VAB as well as doing most maneuvers with as little delta v as possible.

If you're going to say this you might as well mention living beers.

nobody is allergic to "beer", it's something in beer. he could have been a celiac for example, and in that case there's delicious beers like bard's made just for them.

I was a supervisor in a telemarketing agency before. Don't be naive and think that there's a soulless sack of shit on the other end of the line. It's a person doing a shitty job that they know is shitty and they're just doing whatever they think will sound good if "quality control" ever listens in. Personally I was just upfront with people and said "Obviously you're not interested in the product we're offering so I thank you for your time and I'm sorry to waste it. Please do have a good day." or some bullshit along those lines.

But it's still a person doing the call. I had a few calls where in the middle of building a rapport I would get sidetracked by the fact that the customer and I actually shared interests and we would get lost in conversation about something dumb like hobby models.

Yes, they make commission based on leads that become sales. But quit acting like it's some greedy fuck who doesn't care about anybody. It's just another person who works a soul crushing job so they can make ends meet until they find that "real job" that pays the rent a little better but doesn't make them consider suicide.
I've worked at a beer store and you people act like this is a big deal. Weddings happen all the time and I wish we sold beer by the pallet.

I've met many immigrants who come to Canada for work because it's a great country with good work opportunity, and the money they make here they send most of it back home to their family in another country.

It's a good and noble thing they do, but it hurts our country in ways you don't realize. As far as I'm concerned they are funneling resources out of country into theirs.
