hence  T = B - 6 

B + E + T = 27

so: B+ (B - 3) + (B - 6)  =27

so 3B - 9 = 27

Depends on what apps he'll be using and how important reliability is. The 2GB of ram on the s5 neo should be fine for basic apps and maybe some light gaming/multitasking, but it might struggle to keep apps open in the background.

1. Depending on which model of the h815 you have.

4. Rooting isn't the same as flashing a rom, go on XDA to find out more but for that you need an unlockable bootloader. Camera quality on custom ROMs is worse though
5. Should be fine, iirc the S3 has a tonne of custom ROMs so just get a performance one (slimkat if it exists)
Sony isn't much better in that regard.

I really enjoyed this game, but I think that it could have been 2 or 3 hours longer than it was. It was really well optimised and ran on medium at 1080p on my ancient PC (the sequel is unplayable for me 🙁) I really enjoyed the combat the plot.

I don't care much for the movies nor the multiplayer, they're not really my cup of tea.

The only complaint I have is the dissonance between Lara's actions and her monologue, as many reviewers have pointed out.

It was definitely worth the $3.24 that I paid for it a year after release. I would recommend it anyone who hasn't picked it up yet.

Yeah one of my Nexuses 2012 had the same issue and I think it needs a new mobile. I tried nvflash and all that stuff but to no avail, the actual storage chip is dead.
If it gets recognised in fastboot you could set TWRP as recovery or try "fastboot format cache". 
That could be an indication of a fried storage chip.

No, because the coupon is only usable in the Humble Store.

It doesn't fit the overall "theme" of the game, it doesn't tell you the names of dead players, there's weird colour correction going on, hard to see hp damage, the top white scoreboard looks like shit and the end of round team logo is completely unnecessary. You can barely even tell which team is T and which is CT.

The normal HUD works fine, so why replace it with something inferior.

There's a free 2 hour podcast/collection of stories on the gay marriage postal vote. It's called "Listen to live"

There's also a free book called The Homefront: America During World War 2 narrated by Martin Sheen. Link [here](https://mobile.audible.com.au/something_different/apc.htm)


Other books that I got for free in the just 2 to 3 weeks, but I'm not sure whether they're still free are:

- Unheard: the story of Anna Winslow

- The butterfly effect with Jon Ronson

- The Oedipus plays: an audible original drama

- Upstanders season 1 and 2


Usually the deals are posted to this sub (with a link to Audible.com), just search the title on audible.com.au and most of the time it's also free.

Otherwise some specials show up on the store page, scroll around and you'll find it.
sorting by controversial never disappoints :D
Which apps did you delete?
I mean if they'd let us unlock the bootloader then that would ease the frustration. Still, no security update since August 2016 on a April 2015 flagship is pathetic.
They said before Q4. Considering Nougat is over a year old now it's quite frankly ridiculous.
My international h815 TWN supports it
Not sales per se, but there are a few freebies on the Australian site, I can link some:

- http://www.audible.com.au/mt/something_different
- Untold: The Story of Anna Winslow (about 3 hrs long, good narration but the ending falls a bit short)
- Listen to love (2 hr series on the gay marriage postal vote, haven't finished it yet but the quality is excellent)
On audible you pay the monthly fee and get a credit which you use to purchase a book. You essentially only pay once for a book ($14.95). 

Librivox has public domain books that are read by volunteers. The quality is hit or miss, but it's free and there's a couple of radio dramas which are well produced. There's an app for Android which lets you download them for offline listening.

Otherwise you could go to your local library and borrow audiobooks or get the Overdrive app if your library supports it.

btw go on audible, click onto the cancel your membership menu, set price as the reason and it should give a 50% off offer for 3 months.

Looks good, hopefully they manage to give players varied yet realistic building opportunities.

Is there an estimate for when the game will be released?

P.S. lots of people are shadowbanned in this thread.

"most people don't use headphones on phones"

Thanks for making me laugh 😀
Isn't that something that takes less than a minute to change? I suppose another advantage of the Pixel 2XL is the squeeze-for-GoogleAssistant feature.
It's weird; the LG G4 and the LG G6 have similar outputs (around 0.79), but the LG G5 has less than half (0.39)
[Correct link.](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16486108/google-pixel-2-xl-review-android-phone-camera)
[Other phones that have a similar headphone output as the Pixel 2 XL](https://imgur.com/a/MUubl)

If you want to do your own comparison, go [here](https://www.phonearena.com/phones/benchmarks), select Audio Output and type "Pixel 2 XL" into the "Search Phone" field.

Well known phones that scored lower than the Pixel 2 XL include:

- Huawei Mate 8
- Nexus 5
- Sony Xperia XZ Premium
- Nexus 6P
- LG G5
Dongles are $9 now. An option to pay $50 more and get the Pixel buds included would've been nice.
- Better camera (both selfie and normal)
- Updates (both faster and supported for a longer time)
- Unlimited original quality photo uploads 

That's about it, Note 8 is better in every other way (display, headphone jack, S Pen, higher IP rating, etc)

Between 1.10x and 1.50x. Depends on the narrators, for example Stephen Weber's narration of IT is quite fast, so I slow it down to 1.10x
Another advantage of USB type C is that it supports headphones, which would be good to have, given that they removed the headphone jack and the only alternative is to use Bluetooth. 
Got it via an OTA update?
Not that there were many to begin with lol
Glad I could help!
Did you have Google photos installed and set it to back up your photos?
You can't install GApps because it needs to be installed on the system partition, which iirc is about 400MB. The 13 GB you see is the data partition where all your apps, photos and stuff are installed.

If you're deadset on running Nougat, try the smallest (pico) GApps package from [here](http://opengapps.org/), if you're not deadset on Nougat I'd recommend installing [this](https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-7/orig-development/rom-unofficial-slimkat-9-0-grouper-t3214142). It made my Nexus 7 as good as new.
Not sure, but in case you haven't read the article, there's a couple of examples of the voices pre and post update.
Pixel 2 XL? It's not out yet but has all the features you listed and should be easily rootable if Google's track record is anything to go by.
That's odd, for me it is an option, alongside the ones you listed. Have you got the latest version of the app? 

EDIT: **seems to be an option for shared albums only**
You can hide albums - open the album and hit the 3 dots and select "Hide from albums"

On Audible you can adjust the playback speed from between 0.5 to 3. That being said, audiobooks aren't for everyone.
Was it narrated by Roy Dotrice?
IT narrated by Steven Weber is even better!
Cost plays a role as well, and some people prefer to have the option of upgrading their CPU in 3-4 years' time and not having to buy a new motherboard.
Maybe a stupid question, but are you able to board a plane with your phone without any problems?

LG: "3 years of updates guaranteed" ==> 1 security update every 4-5 months, new android version updates a year after the new OS is announced.

Google: "3 years of updates guaranteed" ==> 1 security update every month for 4 years, a new android version within 1 month of it being announced.

Honestly LG is absolutely pathetic with software updates, a Pixel is a much better choice if you're concerned about updates.
Snapchat + some kind of screen recorder?
Same setup, happens to me too. Seems to come and go on a random basis.
So you're saying that  200+ people pulling out their guns in a nightclub with the music on full blast and flashing lights everywhere would result in less casualties? 


No offense but that just seems dumb - you could have finished the game by now, wouldn't have to re-buy it, start over again and play on an inferior system. 
That drops frames like crazy and requires your phone to stay on.
Listening to IT by Stephen King on Audible. Incredible narration by Steven Weber, a bit of a slow start with a tonne of character background information which drags on for a bit too long in my option. Currently just over 8 hours in and the story has finally started to pick up.
Not appearing for me :/ But it's definitely something I'm excited to try, I don't always manage to get though the whole discover weekly playlist.
If you got windows 10 (or  8.1) you should get the Audible app from the windows store. It's much better than the manager.
His Last Bow was published on October 22, 1917. 
First day of fall (autumn) is closer to summer than the first day of spring.
Not too common, but given that the books you're after are relatively new (and thus likely to still be under copyright everywhere) I doubt it's the case.

Maybe message Audible support and ask what parts are missing. Maybe one of them is abridged?
Could be that the a part of the work is still under copyright in your country. For example, the Sherlock Holmes Collection (with Stephen Fry) is 72 hours in most countries and only 66 hours in the US because one of the stories is still under copyright.
Yeah :(
Try cancelling your membership and then set the cost as the reason and you should get an offer for 3 months at $7.45. That's a decent deal.

1. Check that you have the newest version (0.10.0)
2. Open the app, search for a channel and subscribe
3. On the homescreen you should have a subscriptions button

You most likely don't have the newest version. Uninstall what you've got and open the link in this post.(GitHub), download the APK and install it.

The "top games by region", is that measured by sales, playtime or something else?

Other OEMs are equally as bad - my LGG4 hadn't yet received Nougat when Oreo is already out, and security patches are virtually nonexistent. 😕
Yesterday there was a post here accusing LG of false advertising  their  device's camera (the LG V30). The EXIF data showed that it had a f/1.69 aperture, when it was advertised as f/1.6.

This email is LG saying that the exif data was wrong on purpose, to safeguard proprietary information.

Can you name some phones that have removed it and replaced it with "all sorts of things, including a larger battery"?

The HTC U11 had a lot of wasted space, and a relatively small battery for its size, and the iPhone 7 had a lot of empty space in the lower right corner (check out the iFixit teardown [here](https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/N4D3ZrEPhKuEhRei.medium))

And bluetooth headphones need to be recharged every 5 or so hours, which is something I'd rather not worry about.
$$$
Perhaps your usage is different from most, but for me personally the headphone jack is an integral part of a smartphone. I use it daily (2 to 4 hrs) to listen to Spotify/Podcasts. 

The thing is there's no good reason to remove it; it's possible to have a headphone jack and waterproofing (as the galaxies proved), it's cheap and it slows down the wear and tear on the charging port. Furthermore, most phones that have dropped the headphone jack haven't replaced it with anything (maybe excluding the iPhone 7 with its vibration motor) useful - the htc u11, for example, has a tonne of wasted of space.

Some other disadvantages of dropping the headphone jack:
- annoying to carry around an adaptor

- wear and tear on the charging port

- USB C doesn't 'spin' around, while a round headphone connector can

- can't charge and use headphones at the same time (eg. Walking around playing Pokemon Go and using a powerbank to charge your phone)

Perhaps for you the headphone jack may not be necessary, but I think  95% of /r/android would consider it an essential part of a smartphone.
I think it's a one parter, neither the title nor the description have a "part 1" in them.  I'll update once I finish it 😀

I tried GPM once for 3 months (a free trial) and it was so bad compared to Spotify - laggy, unintuitive and the final straw was when it deleted most of my downloaded music while on holidays. 

That day I vowed to never use GPM again.
Some G3s had overheating issues and bad screen burn in. Contact the seller and ask if the phone is doing any of the aforementioned things. eBay buyers protection is pretty good if things go wrong.

Because they are the only chance North America has in making it out of the quarter finals of a major.
Indeed I am.
I don't think prison and not being able to compete in csgo tournaments are comparable punishments. 
Username checks out.
Like I said; I didn't bet on that match. And overall I made like 1$ profit so don't feel too bad for me m8. 😀
$0. I've only ever bet like 5 times on csgl and each time I placed a bunch of 3 cent skins. 
It can't even identify songs, while Google now, which is literally made by the same company, can. The only good use of Google assistant that I've found are the weird and quirky games. 
Punishments also serve as a means to deter potential perpetrators. 

They were all adults when they decided to match fix; do you really think they didn't know that what they were doing was wrong? 
I'd argue that match fixing is worse for fans than cheating.
As of right now they're not, but in 10 years' time they might be. Just look at the total prize money across csgo, Dota 2 and LoL - it's been growing at a crazy rate.
Really? For knowingly and purposefully scamming their fans, destroying the game's integrity in the process and not admitting to it until the evidence became undeniable. 

They should remain banned forever.
I honestly don't understand why people want them unbanned. In any other sport they would be banned for life and criminally prosecuted, and if Esports are to be taken seriously then ValvE and tournament organisers should protect the game's integrity and strongly punish matchfixers.

Yeah he also seems to be carrying a shopping bag and his hair in the video seems both darker and shorter than on the CCTV footage.

I do think that he went to London for some kind of meet-up - either with someone he met online or just a large scale one.
I don't think it's him; the strap of his bag is grey whereas on the CCTV of him at King's Cross it's black.

He seems to be part of the group of 4 boys (about 37 or 38 seconds in, as the camera pans to the right)

Sorry my IQ isn't above 200 so feel free not to reply if I'm not qualified to talk to you.
You thread the laces though the top holes on your runners, forming a loop on each side, then thread each shoelace through a loop on the other side which basically 'locks' your heel in place (which prevents blisters)
You can change the fps in the settings. Default value is definitely more than 2 fps though.
Ingame casters' commentary sounds like shit compared to the stream.
Omg my cpu 😀 the game ran decently until last week's update. Now I barely hit 60 fps 
TLDR: OP goes through the different playstyles with the AK47 (spraying, bursting and tapping) and just concludes that a hybrid burst is the best, as it is the most consistent & benefits your team the most if you don't end up getting the kill.
What errors are you getting? /r/techsupport might be able to help.
Looking back, did you ever get a steam guard code notification when you weren't trying to log in? That would indicate that the scammer knew your password.
You don't need to make a playlist for each album; just search for the album you want to listen to, click on it and select the first track (or hit the big green shuffle button) 


Source on Valve acknowledging the problem?
You don't have to root your phone to get the app running. If the app isn't available in your country (North Korea? 😀) then grab the steam app apk off apkmirror and install it.

Does your friend have a tablet? It doesn't necessarily have to be a phone for the app to work.

Remove one episode from your viewing activity, then it should give you an option to remove the whole series.
Yeah with the HTC U 11 you can squeeze the sides and it takes a photo if you're in the camera app or triggers Google assistant if you're in any other app. Obviously there are more use case scenarios, but they all seem gimmicky.
My LGG4 consistently gets between 4 to 4.5 hrs of SOT per day. Not bad for an 808 and a 16 month old battery.

I thought that the bootloader on the h815 sea was unlockable too. 
Depends on the game tbh, if it's something open world like GTA V or WatchDogs 2 then you're gonna notice the lack of RAM. If it's something like CSGO, Dota 2 or League of Legends then there won't be much difference. 

Install MSI Afterburner and check what your CPU/ram/gpu usage is when your frames drop.
What gpu do you have? 75 to 85 C is probably considered a 'healthy' temperature under full load. 
Does the Ryzen 5 1600 (non-X) support 3200 MHz ram? 
Haha should've posted into the tech support sticky 😀 just make sure you don't 'run' anything, just paste the file into your save game directory and launch the game. 
Use Google & common sense when downloading save files (ie. don't go on dodgy websites and don't download  .exe files) Then paste the save file into <Uplay-folder>\savegames\<user-id>\54 (this is off pcgw, your directory may differ)

Edit: the save file shouldn't be more than a couple of megabytes at most.
I don't think you meant to post your questions as a child comment. 
Open Broadcaster Software.  It's got quite a steep learning curve, but there's lots of tutorials on YouTube and online. 
That seems really complicated. You can  record audio  with obs or any other recording software, or record your hangouts conversation with video, open vlc and convert it to MP3.

Has there been an update for GTA V in the last week? Have you updated windows 10 to the creators update?
Might be a stupid question, but are you sure you're ​running the game off the NVIDIA gpu, not the integrated graphics on the i5?

Also, is it only gta that runs significantly worse?
Try downgrading your drivers. What's your CPU/GPU/ram usage while in game?

Both GOG and steam have it for free at the moment, the GOG version has an exclusive patch which apparently runs better than the steam version.
Is it in the same spot in every shot? If so, check for dust/dirt on top of, and on the inside, of the lens.
Not OP, and while I actually do like this model & prefer it to the standard 1 episode per week, OP might dislike it as it can increase the chance of reading spoilers if you don't have time to binge it within the first day or so.
When all episodes are released at once (the Netflix model)
It is way better than the stock launcher, not the entire UI. It is way more customisable, icons aren't insanely big by default and for me, it is much smoother than stock.
Are you sure you've not booted up in safe mode? 
Nope.
Long-press on it and it should take you to 'Android System' and block all notifications. That does get rid off it but also of other important notifications so i can't really recommend it. :/

Maybe different ROM or root & gravitybox? 
Most of them do, I'd personally recommend Podcast Addict, but AntennaPod and stitcher are decent alternatives too.
>status ***in*** Steam

The wording seems a bit off. It's an old and quite active Twitter account though, so maybe that gives it a bit more credibility. 
Podcast addict is quite good, very feature rich, though the learning curve can be a bit steep (but once you figure out out it is by far the most customisable podcast app) it's my current go to podcast app and premium gets rid off ads.

AntennaPod is an open source alternative with a nice design, although personally it lacks quite a few important features. Nevertheless it's a good looking app and is recommend it for someone starting out. No ads in the free version which is good.

Pocket casts is apparently quite good, and offers web player sync iirc which the other two do not. I have never used it so I shouldn't comment.
You don't need to be rooted to disable the log services. 
What worked for me (with systemless root) was to remove root in supersu, then log into Snapchat, then reflash root. Hasn't logged me out in a week 😀
Yes, I had the same problem. Install Spotify and all downloaded songs (if you have premium) onto internal storage, not the SD card.
Episode #178 'The Great Restoration'? It isn't about the Statue of Liberty in particular, but raises some thought-provoking questions about renovations, such as "when you choose to restore something, which moment in time are you restoring it to?"



It's in the post. It's the Viglen Connect 8" (Intel 1.33GHz quad core (Intel® Atom™ Processor Z3735G - 2M Cache, up to 1.83 GHz)
1GB LPDDR3 Memory + 32GB Storage
8" IPS 1280 x 800Wifi + Bluetooth
Windows 10)
Assuming you're rooted, use a storage TRIM app and trim the cache and data partitions(do this like 2X a week with heavy usage that writes a lot (eg installing apps)), install kernel auditor, set the maximum CPU frequency to 1300 MHz and set the CPU governor to performance (it will reduce battery life, but it's worth it imo) and tick the apply on boot slider.

Galaxy S what?
You're better off posting in Thursday's"What Should I Buy" thread. These days the majority of phones has a screen larger than 5" so it might be challenging to find a phone that fulfills all of your criteria.
Data usage (unless you're unlimited), Google having more of your information and the possibility of a hacker stealing sensitive photos. But honestly these downsides are massively outweighed by the advantages 😀
You can get an app called Greenify and turn on aggressive doze
Haha did you drop it out did it bootloop? 😀

Yeah honestly the jump from a nexus 4 (guessing that's your current phone due to your flair) to anything in the list above would be huge. Shame the pixels aren't in stock :/

Gallery thumbnails or as part of your app cache? App cache is safe to delete. 4GB sounds excessive though
There are 3rd party keyboards available (search up SwiftKey or Chrooma on Google Play) SwiftKey is very customisable and I would definitely recommend it, especially for people who write in more than one language

APKs are file extensions for apps on Android (like .exe on windows). When people say APK they mean the file for an app. These can be downloaded from third party websites such as apkmirror.

You don't have to know about bootloaders unless you're planning on rooting your phone (sort of like Jailbreak on iOS), but it needs to be unlocked in order to get root access on the latest Android operating systems (Marshmallow and onwards, you're on Nougat)

If you do root then be advised that you will lose the ability to use AndroidPay. 

I can't answer the Pixel unlocking question as I don't have one 😀

If you're unhappy with the Pixel launcher (your home screen and all drawer) and are looking for something more customisable is recommend Nova launcher or Action Launcher.
This post is a lie.
What's the general consensus on the Punic Nightmares series on this subreddit? I found it to be one of the best ones to this day. Definitely would recommend.
What format are the movies? Perhaps they're in a format that the gallery cannot recognize.  
Did you use the same password & email combination for another service? If so, then most likely it got hacked and your email and password combination leaked. Search up "have I been pownd and it should tell you from what type account info got leaked.

Ofc change your password and enable 2 step verification for your email & important services.
You can probably trade for it for on /r/SteamGameSwap or other places (eg. Outpost or csgl)

Google photos in my option, although I use it alongside the stock app.
Unlike the other suggestions this doesn't constantly play a sound in the background.
With regards to the OP3's display, there were quite a few people complaining about it due to its PenTile AMOLED layout (which makes the 1080p screen feel more like 720p).

I personally haven't seen/used the OP3 but it's something you should keep in mind.
Shouldn't slow your phone down noticeably unless you have very little space left (for app cache) if I were you I would put movies on the SD card.
Windows 7. Am I correct in assuming that the computer would have to be running for the wifi network to work? Thanks for your help
Set up a wifi network (wifi hotspot) through a wired connection from either a PC or directly from an Ethernet cable. Sorry if the question is confusing, I don't think this is a common scenario 😀 

Probably not even possible to do it, but worth a shot.

(PC connected to internet, can I set up a wifi network through my phone)

A wifi adapter never crossed my mind. I might give that a shot 😀
Check the bootloop thread. Where are you located? If you're in the EU or Australia you should be under warranty no matter what.
It's called "Blueprint for Armageddon" and it's a six part series I wholeheartedly recommend.
It's a replacement, not something that goes on top. If you have any other questions feel free to pm me.
Think about it as any other app, you install it and then set it to be your default launcher (really simple to do, literally 2 taps).  Then your homescreen looks like when you first got your phone and it's up to you to customise it (add widgets, apps, etc)

To get the Nova launcher to look the same as the new Pixel launcher you need to be on the beta of the app & have Nova launcher premium (one time purchase of about 4$, tied to your Google account, regularly goes on sale) and then just follow instructions that you can find online. 

Nova launcher does not remove anything and does not interfere with software updates. It lets you import your current setup if I remember correctly. 

Try out the free version, it's really good on its own :) You can always go back to your current launcher if you end up not liking Nova.
That's a lot of music :P I think it only counts playable formats (ie. encrypted spotify songs stored for offline playback won't be counted, but im not sure)

I feel like starting with such a broad range of topics is not the best idea. Podcasts either have a general topic/theme (eg. Talking about history, music or murders) or hosts that remain the same (same sense of humour, same chemistry) so that the listeners know what they're getting into prior to actually listening to it. Not having a consistent theme nor hosts (assuming you're going to be interviewing a different person every episode) is going to make that difficult.

Maybe alternate topics after 3-4 episodes and see what works and what doesn't & make sure you somehow differentiate yourself from other podcasts. 


What do you mean? If you mean rooted then I think the new update is causing some issues.. 😕

Mine had been charging rather slowly in the last 2 or so weeks. I've also tried different cables and chargers. 
Most of the Telltale games, specifically The Wolf Among Us and both seasons of The Walking Dead (though S1 is much better than S2)
Yea currently it takes about 2.5-3 hrs (screen off) to go from ~10% to full. Before (also screen off) it was easily below an hour and a half, with the same exact wall charger and cable. I might have to do a factory reset or something :/


My phone recently began charging at an astonishingly slow pace, regardless of charger / usb cable used. Anyone experiencing similar issues or know any fixes? (It's been the case for the last 3 days only)

Have you tried using your computer or another phone to test whether or not it's corrupted?

As /u/Dante897 said, there are different hardware models of the LGG4, which all use slightly different software. You can flash a kdz file in order to downgrade or upgrade by following [this](http://forum.xda-developers.com/g4/general/guide-lg-g4-stock-firmware-to-stock-kdz-t3107848%5C) xda thread, but make sure that you get  the right kdz file for your HARDWARE model. (v10x are security patches under LP, while v20x are under MM - where x is a letter.).
Android 6.0 has a built-in battery saving feature called Doze, which activates when your phone is stationary and gradually decreases the number of app-specific calls in the background. It is quite effective in my opinion, only 1 or 2 % are used during the night.
If all else fails then take the Twitter route. You'd be surprised how quickly they'll get back to you. Link the bootloop thread to show that it is a relatively common problem.
Contact then again and if they refuse shittalk them on Twitter (in a mature way) and they will get back to you.
Did the friend ever experience the same issue? If I were you contact LG support.
Are you under warranty? Have you tried talking to your carrier? 
Have you tried a factory reset?
Is it just for the stock camera app or does it happen in other apps too?
Data yes, location only when I med GPS or tracking a run
Hmm that's really weird. Maybe try a factory reset? There's no reason your phone should eat through batteries like that.
Are you on MM or LP? Also, was your phone stationary during that time of was it your pocket?
Seems to be discharging quite slowly (good news for you) but that might be because the battery isn't properly calibrated. Give it two or three days to calibrate.
Can you post the usage percentage table?
Mine is running fantastically, the only time that it got noticeably hot was when I was Snapchatting while charging. Usual SOT is around 4.5 to 5.5 hours.
Works for me in manual mode
You can use voice detection fyi
Are you in an area with limited reception?
Smart settings maybe?
Tap on the hamburger-dot menu (the 3 dots) , hit 'Hide/Show Apps' and then hide the one you want gone.
Mine is running at about the same temperature, but then again I don't recall it getting noticeably got during normal use (it did heat up quite a bit while updating though)
After about 1 day, battery life seems about the same (4.5 to 5.5 hrs), however it seems to discharge faster from 100% and then it sort of plateaus out.
TWN has it too [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/dMbpxz2.jpg)
It's episode 7 of a podcast called "Casefile". The episode is called 'Case 07: Julian Buchwald and Carolynne Watson.

Should be fine (assuming that the subreddit's consensus that post 509s are safe is correct). Nevertheless, I recommend that you use Google photos to backup your pics & videos.

You can check the stickied bootloop thread and CTRL+F 511.
Also let's you download the videos.
You can check for software updates in the phone's options or find a kdz file online and flash it using LGUp. 
Mine does that too. I think it's because the photos are encrypted when locked and the reason why they aren't full res is because it would take quite a while for the phone to decrypt them (especially if you like to flick through then quickly)
Most likely it's the glass pressing down on the digitiser. You can get replacement screens off Amazon or eBay, butn it might be a bit risky if you haven't replaced a screen before. If it isn't overly annoying then keep it the way it is. 
Episode 15. I recommend you get an app called Podcast Addict.
You could probably do it with something like Tasker
Carrier 
Wrong thread maybe?  But I agree, blueprint for Armageddon is very good. 
At least it isn't on my end :/
Was hoping I could listen to the first episode today but I guess I can wait. I've tried different browsers & clearing cache and cookies, but that hasn't changed anything.
Definitely worth a go and if that doesn't work then contact LG or your carrier. 
Yeah 6%for 75 minutes is pretty good ☺️
Have you done a full factory reset? 
Did you stream the movie order was it locally downloaded? 
I still think that SwiftKey's implementation of multiple languages is far better than Google's.

Maybe wait for the new Nexuses to be announced & released and then you can get a 6p quite cheap.

OK try to follow these instructions,

1. Open the camera app, makes sure it is in "Auto", then hit the "Mode" box and select Slo-mo
2. Record video
3. Go to gallery, the speed up/slowdown controls should appear on the right hand side once you begin to playback the video
4. profit :D
Gallery works for me. On the right side there are arrows going up and down which alter the playback speed

If you still have the photo on your phone, you can hit view details and it should tell you. Great photo by the way!
Is there a dialer app that works on the LGG4? I'm looking for something that can replace the sort of ugly stock app. Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks :P
Generally you can't flash a custom rom on a phone with a locked bootloader. There are some exceptions for specific phones but afaik the G4 is not one of them. 
Probably update and then download all your apps. In case your phone's battery life goes to shit after updating just do a factory reset. 
Check the megathread. Some of the 600 series  bootlooped but nowhere near as many as the pre 509 SNs
Ok get back to us once you reset ☺️
Yes. Started 2 days ago & coincided with me setting up "OK Google" voice detection, however given that other people have the problem too I don't think that that's the cause. No system updates or anything like that, using Nova Launcher Prime & on MM.
Nova Launcher Prime (the free version is good enough on its own, but the pro version has some neat features.) Regularly on sale too.
I'd say that The Wallflowers' cover was better. [link here](https://youtu.be/O18bslNM9mE) 
Probably better off not printing your username on it and maybe having one card with the password and one with the recovery code. There is literally no reason to have your account name on it.
Same thing here,  haven't updated in about a month but the issue first appeared 2 days ago.  Thinking it has something to do with ok google but not sure...  On MM btw
cheers.
Is there a way of adding an episode of a different podcast to play after the current episode? 
Open up your take out battery and it should be there. 
Don't think it has been proven that MM is more likely to boot loop than LP.  Your serial number is near the imei number,  the first three digits tell you the date y/m/m of your phone's manufacturing date.  Should start with 5 or 6 and be more than 505.
Correct - cooldown is 30 days from the moment you put in the card's code.
Did both of them not stick to that area of the phone or was it just one of them?
It works now 
If you like some of the more unsolved mysteries-esque episodes of criminal then I would recommend the Casefile podcast.  It is by an Australian guy who focuses on unsolved mysteries in Australia and around the world (though the last few episodes were all set in Australia) 

Can you elaborate on app settings? 
Have you got Twilight, flux or any other all that is already drawing over running? If so,  try disabling them and trying to find permission again. 
Can confirm that you can capture at 60 fps 1080p. I've had the app installed for about 45 days and no suspicious behaviour or anything like that. 
Could you post a picture of the bubbles with numbers? I've never had any on my G4 


Just be wary of the bootloop issue that a (vocal) minority of users has with phones that have a SN of less than 510. (Manufactured in Oct. 2015). Yours will most likely come with MM already installed (at least mine did, bought in March) but if not then play around on LP for a bit and then upgrade. 
I'll check it out! Thanks
Well written praise (and some criticism) of the G4. I agree that the camera is outstanding, that removable storage/battery are often underappreciated and that the UX is focused more on functionality than it is on visual appeal, however I find that the default music app is fantastic and better than any of the alternatives that I've tried (MediaMonkey, VLC and Google Play Music).

Are the locked images on your SD card? If so, then it may be corrupted. Unlocking is working as normal on my device.
Some people say that their battery life is lower on Marshmallow than it was on Lollipop (I'm on M and get ~4hrs of SOT (+-30 mins, depends on the day)). 

Advantages of LP

* Can root
* Better battery life
* Runs smoother (according to some)  



Advantages of MM

* Doze (better battery life management when phone is locked and stationary for a long time)
* Permissions system (if you care about privacy)
* Better UI


If I were you then I would probably upgrade. Make sure you do a factory reset after updating as that apparently helps in avoiding issues with MM. (therefore back your stuff up :P)

PS. 601 should be safe from bootloops (I have a 601 too) but you never know 
What are the first three digits of your serial number? If its <509, your device can  be prone to "bootlooping"  so make sure you back up your photos often.

Highly unlikely that it will go above 66% off, I can't see it being over 75 % off during the Summer Sale so if I were you I would buy it now, unless you don't mind waiting or have other games to play.

Tried again I guess the animations lagging were a one off thing.  It's running great on my G4 
Coming in expecting a lacklustre copy of candy crush, I was very pleasantly surprised with your game. I love the button designs, the fact that there are options for different themes and even colour-blind support. I played through the first two levels of each difficulty.  Two things I would like to point out: 1. The animations can seem a little bit laggy
2. The levels seemed a bit too easy but having said that I only played the first two levels of each difficulty so have to play more to find out whether or not it gets harder.  


Also tapping on the tiles was a bit confusing at first but I could be because I skipped the tutorial. Once the level is finished there should be a prompt on the screen to go back to the menu rather than the small icon on the bottom left corner

Have you tried completely running down the battery and then charging it for ~1hr after it says that it's full? That seems to work for some people who had similar issues as you.
From what I've read, yes. But even so, make sure you have a backup 
AFAIK anything after 509 should be fine.
Maybe the fact that some media reported that Salah Abdeslam was cooperating with Belgian authorities led the others to prematurely attack Brussels to avoid any chance of getting caught.

OK, thanks for your in-depth answers. 
It's really interesting seeing some people who have ~5 hours of SOT, while others have ~2.5 hours, in some cases maybe less. Would you say that your SOT is on the lower side or is it what I should expect. I'd want something that can get me through the day.
I want something that I can listen to music on whilst on the go, take good photos and browse reddit/watch netflix on. I think the size of the phone is fine for me, although I would also be alright with a 5" one. Also for 400$ it is quite a good deal, at least when compared to other phones. I'm a fan of the removable battery and SD card expansion, which is why I'm not interested in any of the nexuses or the S6.
It's a decent game, however the UI on PC is atrocious and the default key bindings for EZdrive are even worse.
WinAuth has the option to do so. Although I agree, the mobile app should definitely have a button to confirm all.
WinAuth can do mass confirmations FYI.

>Because of the way that steam does things it's not able to have multiple auto sign in configurations per installation. You'll have to resort to trickery:

Create a shortcut for Steam on each windows account, edit the properties and give it these launch options -login %u %p. This logs into Steam with the specified Username and Password combination. Replace %u with the username, and %p with the password you want to login with (Steam must be off for this to work).

If you bothered reading his post, he said he defragged his HDD, not his SSD. Have you got fast start up enabled? Did you upgrade from W7/8/8.1 or did you do a clean install?
The wait period after purchase is there to prevent charge backs. It's a stupid fucking system along with the forced smartphone confirmation, but I guess that's just how it is.
No, don't worry. Did you get a key from a giveaway or from reddit in the comments? The message is sent when someone gets the same code as you and chooses to retrieve the account.
Honestly, the way it is at the moment is better. If you're trying to list your items for a lower price than the current lowest listing, then you're going to list it depending on what the buyer pays, not what you receive.
Probably at least 75% of the price you bought it for if you still have the warranty for each part.

Message support, clearly explain the situation that you're in and make sure you show proof that you weren't involved in any fraudulent activity. I'm guessing you sold H1Z1 items on the market at around the 400$ mark, someone bought them and you were flagged by the system, or they were purchased with stolen CC's.

Unfortunately, most of the time when people post here with the same issue as you, they only tell half the story. The fact that you're on a secondary account which is 1 day old doesn't help your case. Can you post some kind of proof (maybe screenshots) of what could've gotten you flagged?

Merry Xmas :)
Probably on the lowest settings at that resolution at ~20-25 fps. Maybe just wait until you upgrade your PC - you'll save some $ because the game will be cheaper by then.
Too hard to tell honestly. You can buy it and refund it. What resolution are you planning on running it at?
Most likely not, sorry. You can buy it on steam, and refund it if it doesn't run or if it runs like shit, which it probably will. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0Y6dZHeF4) video may help you to increase performance.

540 Upvoted and thanks for the giveaway.
I love cases I have like 1500 of them. TY for giveaway.
Flash drive should work, but keep in mind it will take some time to write on it. If the computers are on the same network just transfer the files through that.
It may be trying to get your savefiles for FNV if they're stored on the Steam Cloud, but 7GB worth of files seems like a huge amount.
It gives me the one 'if nothing further occurs to restrict your access, you will be able to use the market on [date]', and the date is 30 days from now. Should I just buy like a 14c game?
it says i have made a valid purchase but only game ive got on my account is a copy of csgo that i got gifted.
1747 CSGO Thanks :)
