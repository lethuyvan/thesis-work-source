Use the Memory Graph debugger. I‚Äôve been quite successful in nailing down some retain cycle issues by looking at the relationship of objects as presented by the graph. 
That doesn‚Äôt qualify as a line. 
You‚Äôll get to meet a lot of dumb fucks too. 
I requested to delete my account. That wasn‚Äôt news. But this is Woz. The Woz!
You‚Äôre not alone. 
Now he Woznt anymore. 
Some programmers, when confronted with a problem think: git blame
And now they have no problems.
He got the company to buy him a work phone. Many companies practice locking down the phone with device management software. This allows them to ensure that the said device is only used for work purposes, or that it can be wiped if lost or stolen. 

He asked me about defeating the device management software. Being a friend, I did some research and tried answering as much as I can and concluded that: no, you can‚Äôt do that. 

Nevertheless, he took the phone (still in its box) from the device admin before they were able to install the device management software on it. It‚Äôs beyond me that the admin would have allowed that in the first place and never followed thru to install the device management software. 

Fast forward a few days later, he posted pics of the phone, still in its box, on his Fakebook timeline, right next to a rose. I realized that he was gonna ‚Äúgift‚Äù the phone to his wife for her birthday. 

Well, that‚Äôs not the end of it. A few days later, I met the wife on the train while on my way to work. The wife flashed her new phone, compared it with mine (I was using an iPhone 6s at the time, and the phone she got was an iPhone 7 Plus) and concluded that her phone was bigger and thus, better than what I had. 
Why stop at 50 million when you can get 87 million. Heck, let‚Äôs just download everything! 
This. 
By pointing a droid to his head.
That CommBank ad though...
Looks like I‚Äôll need to delete the beta profile then check for updates. 
I like how businesses can customize the title bar with their logo and color scheme.
My iPad is currently running the last pre-GM beta, says I'm up-to-date when checking for Software Update. I assuming this one won't expire. 
In the past, I‚Äôve seen more detailed release notes for software that weren‚Äôt released thru the App Store. 
Where do I sign up?
It‚Äôs hard to swallow that people still don‚Äôt get the fact that ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not paying for it, you‚Äôre the product.‚Äù
Money is the last reason. Imagine all the Apple-deprived users getting nothing but Droids. 
If you don‚Äôt have the money to pay for the drawing, end of story. 
There‚Äôs a very well written guide here for those taking the next step: https://deletefacebook.com
Hope you like going to PayPal‚Äôs site, fill up your username and password (skippable, yes), pick the delivery address, confirm payment, then wait while they redirect you back to the merchant site. 
That‚Äôs not the Kind of tip that you want to give Godzilla sir. 
No idea why, but I secretly hope this is the case. 
No idea why they can‚Äôt fix this easily. Just use the time stamp!
Chief Dumb Fuck
And I‚Äôm not even sorry, hehehe!
Casual stormtrooper, Force projection alright. 
Starts with being clueless, then glueless 
Someone that‚Äôs clueless obviously. 
4 tattoos now, maybe 5. 
Wait, upon careful inspection, that‚Äôs Red Three aka Biggs! 
That‚Äôs Luke‚Äôs X-wing üòã
Just occurred to me that Ashoka came back to Lothal escorted by Rebel X-wings?!?
Sorry, we got caught. Removing it now. 
That‚Äôs where the Jedi holy texts are stored. 
Then why label it Others instead of System. Sorry, but I don‚Äôt think that is correct. 
This is Telegram. Note the difference in the ‚ÄúSend‚Äù arrow.

Cameraman shot first. 
Signing out of your own personal Apple ID also signs you out from Apple Music, which means you have to re-download the tracks you previously downloaded. Mildly annoying. 
I had this issue when I was testing auto-renewing subscriptions for my app, and yeah, it keeps popping up. I ended up just signing out of that account (since it‚Äôs a throwaway) and use a new one every time it starts to misbehave. 
Don‚Äôt use your personal Apple ID to test IAPs. Create new, throwaway ones. 
^ There‚Äôs one. 
Did you accidentally tapped on a video? Happened to me once as the video continues playing in the background even after exiting the app. 
Guilty as charged. 
Here, have an upvote. üòÄ
Not until after he eats his member!
Occurred to me a couple of times. Still trying to figure out which app is causing that. 
My launch day 6s did that and when I brought it in to the store, the graph that was shown to me tells the story that the battery‚Äôs defective. Got it replaced with a refurbished. 
First thought that came in mind was that you haven‚Äôt flossed in 50 days. 
TIE Fighter
How long before Apple realizes it and removes the update?
You need to charge your X
It would be ‚Äú10 code‚Äù if it‚Äôs written as ‚ÄúX code‚Äù.
Can‚Äôt recall where I got it from, most likely Reddit. Please let me know if it‚Äôs yours and I‚Äôll put the credit.

I will make it legal!
I love you.
I know. 
Nope, sorry. 
Hello everyone.

16 to collect!
Speaking of TIE bombers, I don't recall seeing any escort other than 2 TIE fighters throughout the OT. 
It's there as an excuse for the Special Editions. 
Not long. Elevator ride not long.
They're TIE bombers. 
You are unwise... to lower your defenses! 
I'll let you guys in on a secret: all LEGO sets are designed in the toilet :P
Now the question is, will it transform?

Dak? Dak?!? Wedge, I just lost my gunner. 
R2-D2, it is you, it is you!!!
Wrong line?
There's Emmet in the third pic. 
There's
At least you get to buy both of 'em before she kills you ;-)
+1 for anyone mentioning the UCS B-wing
There's the 9493 X-wing which is not UCS, and 10240 Red 5 (aka Luke)'s X-wing which is UCS. 
I see what you did with the horse there. :-)
First time seeing a bar being used as a stand. I've been looking to build some for mine and have always steered towards support beams. Thanks, I now know of an alternative ;-)
QC must be sleeping on the job. 
What happened to your original cockpit windscreen that you replaced it with the one from Benny's SSS?
Love the reference to 1138!
Aye!
It's normal. They usually get aligned in my sets. 
Ghostbusters to the rescue!
SPACESHIP!!!
That one odd set in there is for yourself?
Id love to see the A-wing and Snowspeeder if someone cared to share the links. Thanks!
The two Star Wars sets itself are worth far more than $50! Congrats!
Mind showing photos of the stand itself as I'm looking to build some for mine. 
At least these buggers made it look horrible so we know which ones are real and which ones are not. 
Yes, spaceship, spaceship, SPACESHIP!!!
Yes, they need to remake those games. I got into Star Wars thanks to TIE Fighter for DOS. I am that young!
URL schemes look like this - xyz://parameter
If you have the official Twitter for iPhone, try typing this into mobile Safari - twitter:
it gets moved into a "suspended" state where it doesn't use any CPU cycles. however, it continues to hold on to resources like memory where it needs to release if ever told by the operating system. 
it does its detection using low level UNIX APIs (Mac OS X/iOS runs a flavor of UNIX)..

there are no private APIs in use throughout the app ;)
* I have some screens posted over at my [website](http://xcoolapps.com/AppSwitch.html) and more over at [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2089605&id=1135230044&l=6e29111335)
* if you run AppSwitch on the iPad now (e.g. iOS3.2.x) it will work, but it won't show any backgrounded apps other than Apple's.. when iOS4.2 is out, it will work just like when it is run on a multitask-capable iOS device 

note that the app is not Universal yet.. :)
