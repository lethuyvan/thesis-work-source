Reddit
Have u guys read "blame!"? Reminds me of that
I love the display on this, the performance (I have the 3gb/32gb variant) is really good too. I love the battery the most I get a 10-11 hour SOT with constant reddit/Instagram browsing and a few videos occasionally.

 Miui has a few different ROM versions going for it, the phones sold in China have a seperate ROM called the "Chinese ROM" and the rest of the world gets a "global ROM" I'm on the global ROM and ive noticed a few bugs, none of which that can't be fixed with a software update and Xiaomi has started working on the bugs too (I'm part of a few groups based on this phone and a Xiaomi developer messaged me today regarding some feedback I gave on their official app) the only bug that might effect your day to day life is the audio output from the headphone jack is low. You could say it's at 65-70% right now. Pretty sure a software update will fix this though and I don't even know if the Chinese ROM has this issue. The multi tasking also sucks ass right now. (On the global rom)

Also if you're into custom roms there's already a pretty stable ROM available that you can flash.

I've also heard the Dev team is going to work on miui 9 (or 10? I'm not sure) based on Oreo rather than continuing to work on nougat. Pretty sure this will help with Oreo based roms sooner than later.

Yeah I don't know a lot about this, but won't everyone with a nexus 6p be able to claim this 30$?(doesn't this amount depend on how many people apply for the money) and if a lot of them do won't it be a significant amount for Google and Huawei?
What's the point of doing anything?

What do you mean sex?
Here's the thing though, you'd probably do it. I'd probably do it but not everyone would. Many people probably did it for the 50M and many people are probably riding the hype train of accusations and accusing even after taking part in the sexual favour thing. But this shouldn't really take anything away from people who were forced to give "sexual favours" or made feel uncomfortable despite declining to take part.

But also the broader point is someone should not be let in a movie just because they sucked a dick or two but rather be given the role based on their talent like it's actually supposed to happen. Someone talented and someone who deserves a role could lose out to someone who is willing to suck a dick I personally think it should not be that way.

Imagine trying to get rid of one of your fetishes or something. I'm no expert nor do I have a better solution let alone a solution to the problem. But I do think to acknowledge the problem and trying to solve it some way is a step in the right direction. Rather than just trying to kill anyone who has pedo thoughts.

I use Android and am learning to make Android apps, so this is an Android perspective of this. 

An app developer has the choice to make their app "internal storage only' so going by that, it could be the first reason why. A developer simply didn't want people to have it on the SD card because by definition something installed on a SD card has higher chances of not being available to the user, (because the user removed the SD card to transfer photos or whatever) which no business, especially one that depends on people constantly using their platform (reddit) would want.

Here's an interesting thing I noticed too if you force install an app on the SD card and if it has widgets available. Your launcher won't let you put the widget on your home screen. Because it would just not be available if the SD card is removed and re inserted. So Android just doesn't show u widgets of apps installed on sd cards

A few years ago, there was an old couple living in the opposite house with a German shepherd. They had to go to USA to meet their daughter so asked their son to take care of the dog. Fucker had a dog at his house or some shit don't really know why but he never took the said German shepherd to his own house (which is not nearby) 

He used to just come three times a day and give her food and leave slowly it started becoming two times a day. Idk me and my friends just thought she was getting sad by the day so we started going into the house to play with her and give biscuits. 

Point being she died soon after the old couple came back. Makes me wonder if loneliness was a factor.

Unpopular opinion, people might hate me for this but I think Nintendo sucks really bad for doing shit like this. The way they ban stuff on YouTube or fan made games (that aren't even making any money off it ofc), how they released only limited number of the old consoles recently. Sure their games are the best around, But they don't seem to care about their fans at all.

What does "all alone" sound like?
Fill me in too
I think rather than "I guess that's just what happens with such a large amount of subs. 50% of the people are always unhappy with you." It's more about people with a lot of different opinions gather around. 

Some want ethan to pound on jon so hard that it escalates into a huge drama. Some want ethan to stop going so hard on him. Then these scenarios kind of have a ripple effect too. Like him not going as hard will get some people to think ethans a racist or being biased (im not saying this i dont even know what happened with jontron apart from the small bits and pieces I read online) while others think ethans trying really hard to justify everything he does and says (he said "I dont agree with your ideologies" atleast three times) and the list goes on and on.

 At the end of the day I dont think any of us know what ethan is really like, but I think this is a part of the huge dilemma he is facing rather than just being himself he's trying to please everyone so that he doesn't have to face the consequences of either side. And this just displeases everyone. 

But hey whatever I'm just a guy on the internet too. Hope he solves whatever he's going through, for the better or the worse. Papa bless.
