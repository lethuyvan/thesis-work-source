Completely agree. He has the closing speed to compete with *some* of the top U.S. guys, but on the World stage? Completely different animal. That will come in time, when he's running in the circuit and gets more experience, especially in tactical races. Salazar will eventually have him prepared, like he did with Centro, but give Craig a year or 2 more of training/racing and maybe we'll see some glimpses of high potential.
So, I feel like I've read this exact story here before or in /r/Paranormal - I mean everything to a T is exactly the same.

You picked a good bourbon if you're really just getting into it. On the same "level" as Woodford I'd suggest trying some: 

Buffalo Trace, Elijah Craig, Four Roses Small Batch or Eagle Rare

Great bourbons that help you get a sense for the different flavors, aromas, mouth feels, etc. Eventually you can work your way up to the High Proof-ers --- then you're in an amazing new world and you won't look back. 

Take it from me, a Bourbon man through and through.

Also, come on over to /r/bourbon for some more insight! 
Got it, thanks for clarifying. The Dateline episode definitely intrigued me on this case.
The way you formatted this comment made it read like a poem. 
Is this the same guy who had a previous wife/girlfriend who died in a similar fashion (or some sort of freak accident)? I can't exactly remember, but I believe Dateline did an episode on this case, if it's the same one.

It's also a possibility that he could stay in GB. No guarantee he gets a GM job this off-season. 
How do you know that?
That’s perverse! 
Completely disagree. The talent is there on the defense, it's the scheme Capers was running that was out-dated -- the game passed him by. It was time.

Fantastic. High proof-er, so you'll get some burn (and a nice buzz). But I get a lot of peanut butter notes on this, and the mouth-feel is incredible. I wish it had a *slightly* longer finish like some other Barrel Proof bourbons I love:  Bookers, Elijah Craig BP -- but all in a all, a great bourbon. 
I remember vividly as an 8 year old Sox fan at the time, when the strike finally happened/play stopped, the Sox had a 7 game lead in the division. I was absolutely gutted.

But the fact still stands: It *wasn't* a blessing in disguise. 
I mean, were you just waiting for this to throw it back in our face? He definitely shut him down in the second half, for sure. When Capers let him play man on man. 

But cool, you played the "GOTCHA" game! Good for you Rubio. 
When the Browns won the coin toss for OT and had the ball, my heart was pounding so fast, I made a note to check my heart rate. Conclusion? 185 bpm.

He just had his *best* game of the season last week though in shutting down Evans. This is not a blessing in disguise at all. 
He also has more sacks/TFL's than Khalil Mack. That's saying a LOT about the year Clay is having.

Did you ever confront the "good" version of your friend and ask him about it? To see if he remembered (or if it actually happened)?
"I love yuh Penny. I've always loved yuh."
Yep, [I was the one who pointed that out](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/7gec3m/dr_downvote_youtubes_secret_codes_revealed/dqiuxz0/) in the /r/videos post. But now someone caught that it isn't marked with 102 anymore.. hmm. 

Immediately after watching this video though, I thought of ReviewBrah and how insane these new "algorithms" are -- good, wholesome channels getting demonetized for asinine reasons. Unbelievable.
Well I guess that's good news then, must have gotten updated since I checked yesterday. 
I know that /u/TheReportOfTheWeek (or ReviewBrah as many viewers know him) has had *major* issues with demonetization. If anyone *doesn't* deserve it, it's him. It's a wholesome channel, with zero language/sexuality/social issues on all his videos. He literally... reviews food from fast food restaurants.

After watching this, I went to his most recent upload: [Reviewing a pizza slice from Sbarro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnWza5DCYw8&t=0s), and it is marked with a **102** -- which according to the video, is "Profanity and rough language."

Not ONCE in the video does ReviewBrah use curse language or anything remotely "profane." If they are right about what they think the marked numbers mean.. YouTube is doing a complete injustice to these type of content creators. It's absolutely ridiculous.
As a resident of Chicago, it made it even better. People here LOVE that shit.

And it might not even matter. We got no help today from other teams. 
Blame it on the inept offensive drive by the Packers right before that. Mind boggling.
It will in my house, that's for sure.
Unfortunately, Dom's defenses always gets feasted on by elite QB's. 
*When he starts a game. 

Lost at Minnesota. As we know.
Technically we haven’t see Callahan play, so we have no idea if he’s better or not. 
Didn't the fans boo multiple times on Sunday as well?
We don't know what's going on behind closed doors in the QB room, but I tend to think they aren't necessarily overlooking his hesitancy. This type of play right here makes it easy for Hundley and he just won't throw it. A coach can only do so much -- it's up to the player to ultimately make that decision/play. 
These are the types of plays where McCarthy is **trying** to make it easy for Hundley and he still isn't pulling the trigger. Is he scared? Overthinking? I'm not sure, but it's frustrating to watch.
Yeah, that's what I thought. I was going to say, there's no way in any state they will let you drive after that. 
I'm just guessing here, but because they deemed him "impaired" after doing the sobriety test, I would assume that's why they put him in cuffs, no?
Against a better Pittsburgh defense.

Yep, he said he never watches games on his own.
*Aaron

Apologies for the typo in the title. 
It's not even just the turnovers, either. His pocket awareness is awful, and when he has a clean pocket for a few seconds, he can't get it to an open receiver. He sees them, but doesn't throw to them. I do not get it - it's like he's afraid. 
Welp, not today. He's inactive. Ugh.
Yep.
First.
They are also activating FB Joe Kerridge from the PS to the active squad.

I miss these three together.
Luckily, we *finally* got home with the pass rush yesterday when we needed to. Bears were without Long and the Packers D was finally able to take advantage and get some sacks. That was a plus.

3rd down defense improved. However, there were a few 3rd and longs the Bears converted thanks to Capers' soft-zone coverage. But starting the 2nd half with two consecutive 3-and-outs was a big plus. 

I think overall, we played well, and gained confidence for Hundley which had to be the most important factor. 
Yep, but unfortunately we could be missing Ty and Jones for a few games now. Although, Williams can obviously be a workhorse as evident by today's performance.
Cheeky bastard.
This it the most likely scenario, and exactly what the article states. 
Fire Capers
He'll never be the best CB in the league. (I know you're being hyperbolic, but it had to be said)
Okay, I'm 31, am I old now because I'm about to ask this... why do people at the end of posts sometimes sign-off with "XD" -- what does that mean?!
Remember, Questionable can now also mean Probable. I’m guessing he plays as he was at least able to practice in a limited fashion all week. 
One thing Bears and Packers fans can unite on! 
Yeah, he’s a lying piece of shit. 
The Packers followed the protocol - and if any team would follow it any more closely, it would be the Packers. 
And now this from Ahmad Brooks on MB's retirement announcement: [#Packers OLB Ahmad Brooks said he asked Marty Bennett about the retirement announcement when players returned from the bye. "He said he was just talking crap," Brooks said. Brooks told me he does not believe Bennett was sincere about retirement.](https://twitter.com/ByRyanWood/status/928742937038589952)
Yes they do. But Father Time is undefeated. 
7 years ago, a million injuries since. Unfortunately, I doubt we'll see anything close to this type of dominance again from CM3.
Yeah, and let's see if he actually will "retire" after the season.
TT and McCarthy are under contract through 2018. There's no way in hell Mark Murphy is firing him after this season.

The only wholesale change I see happening after this season is Dom's job. 
But this is also going to get ugly. Packers are going to go after that contract/signing bonus money due to the fact he hid the injury.

Unfortunately (or however to look at it), if Aaron hadn't gotten hurt? This wouldn't have happened. The injury to Aaron, the retirement post, now the hidden injury...this isn't all just a coincidence. But, I firmly believe if Aaron was still playing this never would have happened. And that's just sad to me.
Bingo.

Hoyer would have been Hundley's back-up to replace Callahan, no way he would come in and take Hundley's spot from Day 1.
Fuck that mentality. You're talking as if the Packers are sitting at 2-5. They're 4-3 and are in a WIDE open NFC right now. 
Love that detail, first thing I noticed too. Also, I believe John Carpenter is doing the score again for this movie.
Because it's the NFL, and when have you known the NFL to be reasonable?
I know he's a very good OC, doesn't mean he has his off-games, and that game plan vs NO was shit. But when he does adjust and comes out with a great game plan (as he's done in the past), he doesn't get the praise he deserves. With 2 weeks prep, I expect something good out of him.
Lets hope McCarthy has a better game plan than last game.
I usually don't like these type of videos, but I love ReviewBrah. Shout out to /r/TheReportOfTheWeek 
BONG!

I absolutely LOVE this one-off line from Angela. It's delivered perfectly!
And hasn't he come out and publicly said that he hates that album too? From what I remember hearing, he said he's ashamed of it. Again, just going by recollection.
And all of a sudden he hits TWO in the post-season! Unbelievable.
Then you didn't watch the Vikings game last week. He threw it great outside the numbers. This is all on McCarthy today.
Against a 9 man box. What could go wrong?
The defense did it's job. 26 points against Brees with 2 interceptions is huge. With Aaron in there, the Packers win this game.

This is on McCarthy. His game plan for running the ball seemed to work, but when you need to get your QB in rhythm (which he did for 1 drive *only*) he decides to be stubborn and continue to run the ball when we're backed up in our own end. Head scratching type of calls today from Mike. Get your new QB some rhythm and confidence -- Brett had no chance with that today.
Absolutely agree.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mIMo9jrdmcw
"He said what now?"
Yep, Taylor not playing was expected though. 
I actually have a hunch he will play this week. He's been practicing all week (in a limited fashion). But I feel if they wanted to rest him this week and then the bye, he wouldn't be practicing. 
There's nothing there that indicates anything is sitting cross-legged. How/where are you even picking up on that?

Can you elaborate on "picked fights?" I'd like to see what you mean by that. 

It was (and still is) his job to cover the Packers, be *critical* of the Packers or PRAISE the Packers. McGinn obviously rubs people the wrong way with his critical articles on the team, but if anyone has the pedigree to do it, it's Bob. He doesn't "pick fights" just because, he points something out and gives the information to people who are probably wondering the same exact thing. 

To not recognize Bob and his new gig this year, is really disappointing from the Packers.

Rinse and repeat for Nick, every year. Unfortunate, because him and Clay have been great thru 2 games. 
Still need to make a corresponding move. 
Every team has injuries. It's the NFL, not one player is 100% healthy throughout a given season. 

Also, this team went to the NFC Championship game last year. But hey, if you want to root for a team that sucks and has "no injuries" - go ahead. 
Ahmad Brooks was a Full Participant in practice yesterday. He should play on Sunday

Also, according to the injury report, Daniels was listed with a Hip injury (which was why he was on the report last week) - so it seems the hamstring isn't the issue, it's the hip.
Know wha I mean?
Guarantee it's due to Daniels' injury. So, this isn't necessarily *encouraging.*

It was a quad injury.

Same with Bakh's hamstring. If our starting Tackles aren't playing on Sunday....gonna be trouble.
What does the first B stand for?!

Probably because it's something you can conceivably see R. Kelly singing about. It's amazing.
Okay, now THAT move is a bit surprising. I know he had fallen down the depth chart, and actually some were surprised he made the 53, but having him active last weekend was telling. 
Another one I had as well, but I think considering the "thinness" of the o-line, they wanted to keep him just in case. 
Actually, Adams is not out several more weeks, that's never been reported, he practiced in limited fashion all last week. I just think they must like Dial then. Also, Ricky only played 6 snaps vs SEA. But I do agree it's surprising, I thought Pipkins would be the guy they would move to make room for Geronimo. 
I just mentioned this in the other hype video thread and lo and behold Basaraski to the rescue!!

EDIT: Holy cow, this song is really good, love the rhymes!
Great video.

How was that interior?
Will forever be indebted to James, especially in 2015 after Jordy went down with the ACL.

Long Live the Hoodie!
That was my guess.
Because he had aids. 
And the fact that they haven't retired his number is insane. Long overdue. 
I don't know who Gus is, but I'm a fan now.
The only "significant" one I saw was Jim McMahon, but I didn't want to post him, even though he looked stylish backing up Brett during the Super Bowl. We also had Jon Ryan the Punter, before he went to the Seahawks and broke our hearts in 2014, so, yeah..
We won't carry 3 QB's this year. Most likely he's on the PS. But as others are pointing out, I feel like his ceiling is low. 
Does this picture make you randy baby?!

Title is in jest, obviously. But he absolutely helped salvage our 2013 season after Rodgers went down. That Cowboys game will never be forgotten, [for obvious reasons](http://imgur.com/YYlXqEs).

It's all about that $$ for Ted and Russ Ball. 

Though Brooks isn't the same player he used to be, this was one of those signings that I thought would work and made sense for the team. Biegel is definitely going on PUP to start the season, and we have 2 banged up injuries to our starting OLBs. Not to mention nagging back injury to Jayrone. That leaves Fackrell, who is.. well, you know how he is. Sad to say it, but I'm disappointed here. 

EDIT: They just signed him. Haha, funny how that works. Thanks Ted!

Nope. Will almost certainly at this point (barring a miracle) put him on the PUP to start the season. Which means he'll miss a minimum of 6 games.

Makes sense. Roster was at 89 after the Guion cut.
Definitely does in the short term. But with more practice reps, and 2 preseason games to go, I think he'll do enough to solidify his spot on the roster. 
We'll find out more most likely, today at McCarthy's presser.
My prediction: Davis is going to win the return job, he's 100% making the roster. Book it.

Yeah, that's not Eddie laughing. Eddie is the one reading the promo, Pat Foley is the one laughing in the background.

If they proceed like they have in years past, Rodgers will only play a couple drives in the 3rd preseason game.
He's not.
I mean..it's not 30 days, it's 31 days until they kick-off right? Unless you're counting *up to* September 9th and stopping. But, technically isn't it 31 days if we're going til they ACTUALLY kick-off?

Hmmmm, you could be right on that too. When watching the live-stream of the trailer from Celebration, it instantly resonated with me that it was Obi-Wan. But now, going back and listening, I could also get how it could be the Emperor.

EDIT: Looking at the comments on the YouTube site, pretty sure it's Obi-Wan.
Fairly certain it is "..was seduced by the Dark Side." taken from when Obi-Wan was talking to Luke about his father becoming Darth Vader.
Fair enough, I see your point. But I guess we'll agree to disagree that it looks boring. The cinematography, just in this teaser, looks incredible and the shots give us a sense of the story arc, but doesn't reveal *too* much. 
What's the point of comparing? Why does one have to be "better" than the other?
If there's "not much here" then it's done it's job as a *teaser.*

We don't have to replace Lacy. We have to replace the "Stark-esque" RB: http://www.acmepackingcompany.com/by-the-numbers/2017/3/15/14935322/packers-hole-at-running-back-ty-montgomery-eddie-lacy-james-starks-rb-production-carries 
Amen, brotha. 
Me too. A heavy zone running oriented offense (which the Packers do) relies on having RBs be patient, and we have obviously seen how patient Ty can be during his limited time at RB this past year. Excited to see him take on that role more and more this year. 
We're in the Darkest Timeline.
Especially against a team who coming into the game was 6-0-2 in their last 8 games. Very encouraging.
You bet!
Agreed, again, I don't think stats can tell the full story. But in no way are we a run first team. If you get a chance, check out that article I linked too - it's *really* interesting and I love how he backs up his points with the data. 
I have, and that in no means implies we were a run first team. 

**1st and 2nd Quarter Stats**:

JAX - 7 rush attemps

MIN - 6 rush attempts

DET - 7 rush attempts

NYG - 9 rush attempts

DAL - 7 rush attempts

Now, let's compare that to how many pass attemps the Packers had during that period.

**1st and 2nd Quarter Passing Stats**:


JAX - 20 pass attempts

MIN - 18 pass attempts

DET - 20 pass attempts

NYG - 32 pass attempts

DAL - 23 pass attempts

That comes out to an average of 3.16 : 1 ratio. For every **one rush** attempted, in the 1st and 2nd Quarter of the first 5 games, **they pass atempted 3.16 times**.

Now, I will admit, stats don't tell the full story. We know that McCarthy's offense likes to establish the run to open the pass. But even so, you can see that they elect to pass more. 

[This article](http://www.acmepackingcompany.com/by-the-numbers/2017/3/15/14935322/packers-hole-at-running-back-ty-montgomery-eddie-lacy-james-starks-rb-production-carries?utm_campaign=acmepackingcompany&utm_content=chorus&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter) goes into even greater detail into the stats of the Packers' run vs. passes and how we are clearly a pass oriented team. 
Even with Lacy we were never a run first team. Not sure what you're talking about. 
That was incredible, Bravo /u/FRDyNO 
Is that the William Shatner episode?
Absolutely love this song. Discovered it initially after watching this Carl Sagan video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi3-0saiQs0 
*Hold my beer
**IT WORKED**
I have a terrible feeling about Anisimov's injury. 
I feel like your point about what they did 70% of the time with Lacy was running east-west probably has something to do with the way they play the run game. They use a zone-stretch run scheme most often so they've never been considered a "downhill running team." 

But it's hard to look past what he did for the Packers in 2013-14. I think he fit the mold perfectly, actually. It just sucks that it was derailed by injuries and the weight problem.
All of the players that we've lost in FA (besides 1, Micah Hyde) have gone to teams who we play against this upcoming season. Oh joy.
Kind of how I feel too. And of course we play them again in the regular season too - luckily it's at Lambeau.
As much as a LOT of people gave him shit for his weight/injuries, it feels like I was in the minority to bring him back. He was averaging 5ypc before his injury this year and I was really excited to see him and Ty together in the backfield. Really sad to see him go. 
Was hoping that we'd potentially get House back - but according to @PackerReport - he's not signing with the Packers either. 
I like your style.
I guarantee the Packers aren't considering that, and they shouldn't. Tackle is a position where having insurance is smart, and if injuries occur, he can step in. Like I said, he had his best year at the position last year, why change that? 
Why would they do that? Bulaga is one of the best Right Tackles in the league and just had his best year last year. I've seen this proposed a lot and it makes zero sense when you have your guy already. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. 
He's from Detroit, it makes sense. And I guarantee the money was better. This still sucks though, as I don't think there's a current guy on the roster that can fill his role right away (and don't tell me it's Spriggs or Barclay, it isn't).
I can't get myself to vote for 80, being that will always be Driver's number to me. I know Perillo was wearing it, but 80 should be Donald's forever.
Don't you dare leave out Bill Schroeder. 
I have a feeling he's gone. I don't know why.
House definitely counts as a Veteran CB.
Losing Cook put us in the position. I would assume Cook was asking more than what they are going to be paying Bennett. Russ Ball will have this one under control, like usual.
Now I know this is asking too much from Ted. But how about now a vet CB? 

Really interested to see what happens too, with Lacy and Lang these next couple days. 
Jared Cook missed a ton of time last year due to injury too. 
I'll take it considering it was his 3rd best season based on yards, and had 7 TD's, the most he's ever had in a season before. 
And he's been extremely vocal about bringing back 2 key players:

T.J. Lang and Jared Cook.

Cook is officially done, and Lang is right behind him. Look, we know that he's not the personnel guy, and doesn't make those decisions. But investing in the *right* pieces of your offense is critical. McCarthy's offense is the most successful with a big TE. Now look at where they're at? It's a HUGE need in the Draft. And I just don't understand the aversion now. Either Jared was asking for Top 5 TE money, or Ted was being stubborn as hell with his $$. I've never criticized Ted in the past, but when you lose: Micah Hyde (key DB), Jared Cook (#1 TE), Most likely Lang and possibly Lacy? There's a hell of a valid reason to question Ted's philosophy.

He was bred under Wolf, who, unlike Ted, wasn't averse to FA. Andre Rison, Keith Jackson, REGGIE WHITE. At some point, Ted has to realize that he will keep failing in the present by trying to secure the future. 
Look at the most successful franchise over the last 20 years: Patriots. They just won their 5th SB, and look how active they've been in the last couple days in FA. Including today, giving up a 2nd Round Pick.
I'm still trying to find Homer.

[Here's a great compilation of him laughing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwvCI6NOFls) at Karl Pilkington's comments during An Idiot Abroad.
Make it so.
True. The offense was at fault today a bit too. They didn't score for the first 35 min of the game. They needed to score whenever Atlanta did, and that doomed them. 
Seriously? That's your argument? 

So he wasn't part of the 8 game winning streak, right?
And those people who are calling for MM's head? Fucking idiots. 

Look at what this team did at 4-6. With ALL THESE INJURIES. They made the fucking NFC Championship Game. Played on the road against the top Offensive team in the NFL, and when injuries upon injuries keep pilling up, there's nothing else you can do, it will eventually catch up to you..and it finally did today. It was one hell of a memorable season, and we still have the greatest QB to walk the planet under center. 

Go Pack Go. We'll see you next season.
It's a full practice, not just a walk through. Just a FYI. 

My absolute favorite quote from the article when he's talking about Aaron:

*You also have to be thinking deeper than everyone else to make those plays. You have to be able to see what’s on the field … but then you also have to be able to see what’s going to be on the field, a second from now. And two seconds from now. And at every second until the exact moment the ball hits your receiver in the hands. To play the quarterback position as well as Aaron has played it, you basically have to see the field, not as it is — but as it will be.*

*You have to see the future.*

Let it be known, Aaron Rodgers is a psychic. 
At this point, don't they have to at least look at moving this Saturday practice to a walk-through next year? This has seemed to happened a bunch this year where injuries are popping up on Saturday at practice right before the game. I know McCarthy has a system, but there's a risk and reward factor in play here. I dunno, I'm not an NFL coach, but it just seems silly to me. 
I'm not either. I think all will play except Jordy. 
Geronimo didn't practice either today due to a hamstring injury.
He's not. He practiced all last week too as a Limited Participant and was still in the protocol. According to MM today, he's still in the protocol still.
I was yelling too, noticing they were still huddled up with 15 on the play clock. I love this man so much.
And that's all on the Defense/Capers? This constant hate for Capers with a depleted defense is such bull shit. 

What about C-Mike's bonehead kickoff miscue? Pinned the offense back and did nothing. Is that on Capers?

Lose your arguably 2nd best defenseman (Burnett), put in an UD Rookie and still win, but... Fire Capers? Are you kidding? 

The offense stalled, and Dallas' o-line  styimed the pass rush all night long. But Fire Capers. Oh, I guess you missed the game saving play on Dallas' last drive by Matthews to force them to kick a FG. Get the fuck out of here.

Show me another Defensive Coordinator do what he has done over the past 8 FUCKING WEEKS with the injuries and players we have and I'll give it to you. But there isn't one. 
Sam Shields. 
Except he didn't say that. He said we should have more faith that our players will step up. In no way did he say they aren't good.

However, his statement that we will "blow them out" is really far-fetched.
Herb Waters.
These Saturday practices man..
Pretty sure Marcus Lemonis has backed him too, but is apparently trying to get out now. 
They technically still kind of do. In their Game Recap videos. Here's the Giants one:

http://www.packers.com/media-center/videos/Game-Recap-Packers-38-Giants-13/f1ba5d3b-cec2-416b-8f0f-1c5dce05a517 
Fairly certain is was against Detroit in week 3 too.

EDIT: [Here it is!](http://www.prideofdetroit.com/2016/9/29/13109770/nfl-admits-pass-interference-66-yards-wrong-nevin-lawson-green-bay-packers-detroit-lions) 
I know which one you're talking about. The throw to Trevor Davis. 
Are the mods gonna update the Standings in the side-bar? Hasn't been updated in 2 games. 
Yeah I don't expect him to play, but I also can see that side of it. McCarthy actually didn't rule him out yesterday - said he will try and practice Saturday. I think a lot of that is gamesmanship on the coach's part, which I love. Keep Dallas guessing all week.
Oh I'm well aware. Trent Richardson and Bernard Pollard come to mind. But knowing the medical staff of Green Bay, I don't see it happening. Especially if he had to stay in the hospital overnight (even if it was just for observation).
I mean, it's two broken fucking ribs, that *already* is a substantial injury. There's no way he's playing this week. 
[She was only 16  years old.. she was only 16.. you're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!!](https://youtu.be/HFIQIpC5_wY?t=80)
McCarthy said "they have concern" for his injury.

It looks/sounds like to me a broken rib or two. It was a brutal hit on an unprotected area. If that's the case, I don't see him playing next week.
McCarthy said in his post-game presser that "they have concern" on Jordy's injury. It has to be a broken rib or two - there's just no way he'll be able to play in time next week, unfortunately.
Seriously though? Yes our offense has been incredible the past 7 games, but with a depleted defense look at what we've done. That is an ENORMOUS testament to Capers. He gets shit on way too regularly, but to be honest doesn't deserve it at this moment. What more do you need from him to convince you? 2 takeaways and 13 points isn't good enough? I don't get the recent Capers hate.. especailly with the personnel he's had to deal with. 
Came at a perfect time too. Perfect execution.
You da man.
CANNOT WAIT!
The MVP is only for the regular season. It gets handed out on Super Bowl weekend, but playoffs have nothing to do with consideration. 
Based on all the polls that MMQB and ESPN have done it really looks like it will be Matt Ryan for league MVP, who's definitely deserving of it. 
Ain't nobody got time for work this morning.

That doesn't sound like a voice at all to me. Just some reverb. 
I don't think it is. 

EDIT: You're right actually, it is Cook. My bad!
Might be the fans favorite for best referee, but I don't think he's the best in the league, now. With him doing this game, his squad will not be officiating the Super Bowl, as per league rules. 
No, thank [Evan Siegle](https://twitter.com/evansiegle) for this! 
Now it's time to make a legacy.
He doesn't care at this point and isn't going to risk injury with scrambling around. Time for do or die tonight boys!
I think *finally* he and Kenny have now let Hahn do his thing. Look at the moves and prospects they've hauled in over the past month. It's a re-build with some really talented young guys - our farm system will finally be worth something.
The Bulls are the most profitable team in the NBA at the moment. That's all Jerry cares about. It's a business and nothing will change.

You're the man. 
So, for an easier breakdown. In order for GB to clinch a spot in the playoffs **before** Week 17:

**Week 15**: WSH loses tonight

**Week 16**: GB wins vs. MN + ATL wins + TB loses + WSH loses 

Correct?


Take my body.
Last 9 games, Darling has been 6-2-1 in Crow's absence. Phenomenal. 
I mean, basically if they had lost they were out. Not 100%, but damn near close to it. 
It's essentially been the Playoffs since the Eagles game. 
I need to hear Wayne's call on that bomb to Jordy. **I NEED IT.** 

EDIT: Found it: http://www.espn.com/video/clip?id=18305216
How do people not remember 2010? Capers was the DC then. 
Yeah, we know. 
Awesome - would have been my second suggstion!
USB cord? 
That's actually good to know. First time I visited it, I got a weird sense of "entitlement" about it.
That's actually good to know. First time I visited it, I got a weird sense of "entitlement" about it.
Andy is not smart.
I think their defense overall has improved. Last time we faced them they had a lot of injured/suspended guys. Started getting those guys back and have played much better. 
And Feed Ty.
While Greene has a point, this article is shit. Ted Thompson has not done a "shoddy job" as GM. This article mentions the weak spots of this year and last year, but for some reason leaves out 2014? Was that Ted Thompson's fault that Brandon Bostick fumbled the ball? Ridiculous..

While I think Ted should sometimes dip his feet more into Free Agency, the fact remains that it doesn't fix everything all the time. 
**FUCK the Seahawks**
Since 2010 he has won it **14 times**. The most in the NFL during that period. 
But he didn't write the article. 
Same. You can tell that Wilde still tries to ask the types of questions he used to ask him in the radio show. Hard to carry over in a press conference or when he's at his locker, but that's what definitely makes me miss the show the most. 
Yes, it was. 
Peter King didn't write the article. Emily Kaplan did.

She also said Rodgers made the infamous R-E-L-A-X comment during a press conference. It wasn't, it was during Tuesday's With Aaron. 
But /r/nosleep isn't real. 
Amazing. And this was the play Rodgers hurt his calf on too. I think when he pushes off to escape the pocket, could have been when he did it. 
Finally some good news on the injury front.
How is Jeff Triplette fucking employed by the NFL? Unbelievable. His crew is the worst in the league. 
Haha. I was the one who created this gif last year. https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/2wfyir/guy_falling_for_9_seconds_while_trying_to_shovel/ 

I then realized how fake it was. For shame.
He's in the Hall of Fame for best elbow pads in NFL history.
Yep. I posted in the wrong comment section, haha. Here you go: https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/5hdw43/war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes_official_trailer/
Man, that scene of the gun to Caesar's head was chilling. Really excited for this movie.
You should read the book. Black Mirror vibes the whole time.
Unfortunately, for his own health, it's the smart decision. Unbelievable player for us and will be missed, if this comes to fruition - but you can't fault the guy for taking care of himself. 
Evan Siegle, who took this picture, is a phenomenal photographer. 
Definitely agree on that front. It's time to move on from James Starks. If [this](https://twitter.com/AaronNagler/status/805544998808780801) doesn't give them more reason to, then I don't know what will. 
But Janis is not one of our playmakers. Ty is. And still McCarthy always says in his press conferences "frankly, he needs to get more touches" - and then he goes out and refuses to give him the ball. When he has a game like he did tonight - he should be in there all the damn time. 
Thanks for the clarification. Seeing as they practice on Saturday's, I'm guessing he aggravated it today during that. Which is so fucking frustrating at this point. 
He won't play a single down in the secondary tomorrow - it'll be all Special Teams. 

EDIT: Not sure why I'm being downvoted? Every beat reporter has said he'll play primarily Special Teams tomorrow
He wasn't on the report at all this week. Not until today.
Wow. Now I'm gonna go out on a limb and say he won't play tomorrow. These doc's are gonna be cautious. 
Stop giving him press. 
I'm fairly certain that he will shave it before the game on Sunday. If I remember correctly he does it for the month of November, has the stache for a couple days and shaves before the next game.
That would just be funny.
By *forever* you obviously mean Bears career, because he will most certainly be going to another team after this season. 
Although I hope the game is decided in the Hawks favor before OT on Thursday, I'll be at the game and would absolutely love to see 3x3 hockey in person! 
Everyone becomes an "expert" when things aren't working.
How the hell did he have bad judgment? He called a great game today - which game were you watching?
Was this the play with Davante's 2nd TD? 
Yep. And I believe that's essentially why Gruden is staying in the booth as well. While I know he works hard at that (Gruden QB camp, watching tape), he knows the grind and stress of a HC job can take its' toll.
They release the inactives for the game, hour and a half beforehand. 
What did he say? He removed the text. 
Do or die tonight boys. See you on the other side!
I love Andy's pointing gestures during the scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hry1SZTFjts 
Brb, getting hammered. 
No need to apologize - I can say we all appreciate the 1080 version! 
Maybe a part of it. But Damarious was torched by receivers early on. 
It didn't necessarily thrive when he was in there earlier this season, though, unfortunately.
Take a look at our defense. More holes in there than swiss cheese.
I'd like him or Dalvin Cook.
End of thread.
'Member Nick Collins?


Can't wait to hear the excuses again in the post-game press conference.
7 years in a row was a good run. It's time for some changes. But knowing this front office, nothing will change. 
Does a bear shit in the woods?
Even with Clay back, we're an inept defense. 
Well, the first part of that is right.
Can't grind out a win with this shit defense on the field.
No excuses anymore. 
I think we are really going to see what this Packers team is about. There's zero excuse not to come out with a ton of energy in the first 5 minutes or so of this game. 2 teams above you in the division win? Time for some fucking urgency. Let's go.
And then tell us how he wants to stay balanced on offense. 
Yep, he has had some sticky hands over the past couple seasons. I think it's basically saying Ryan will be out for a few weeks at least. 
Haha I like that.
I am completely on your side about that, 100%. Unfortunately, professional athletes (especially the ones who are as high profile as Aaron is) aren't like normal people. Every aspect of their lives are scrutinized. I hate that, I really do - but it's the unfortunate reality that we have in this world. 
I never said that Rodgers was the reason for the team's play. And Ty's article doesn't really say that either. He *does* say that the team needs him to be the leader to bring them out of this hole, though.
Agreed that there's always 2 sides to a story. I think it was still a good piece - the only thing that rubbed me the wrong way is Jermichael's quotes. He seems to be injecting himself a lot lately into past drama with the Pack.
It's a really good piece. Tyler did his research and interviews, and honestly, is a startling look at Aaron. Everyone likes to think that family issues/outside issues don't affect the play on the field - but something as deep as the family issues with Aaron, I could understand that affecting someone's play. 
By this guy, do you mean me or the guy I responded to? Haha - I mean it is impressive for one season. Seattle is definitely the exception not the rule in this case. 
Yeah there's a reason for that - been the best defense in the NFL for a few seasons. 

EDIT: I should say one of the best defenses. Denver was clearly the best last year.
Yep, and we are -4 on the year. Needs to turn around in a hurry.
He's referring to yesterday's Injury Report, which is here:  https://twitter.com/Michael_Cohen13/status/799002279294681088/photo/1

They will probably release the one for today in the next half hour or so.
Matthews practice again today - so looks like we'll be getting him back, which would be great to stimulate some sort of pass rush.
The most impressive stat about that 2010 team was that they **never** trailed by more than 7 points in a game the entire season. That's unbelievable. 
As I was typing it I had a feeling that I was wrong, but wasn't 100% sure. Thanks for clarifying!
Thanks for clarifying! 
Wouldn't a duplicate post be pointing to the same URL? I'm just wondering, as I link directly to Packersnews and his is to the Sentinel. 
He is on IR, (same with Lacy). We can only activate 1 player from that list, and I believe the earliest Sam could return is Week 15. 
Packers Echo Chamber.
And no Leroy Butler - absolutely ridiculous.
Yeah, if they signed him today, that means he'll have Thursday and Saturday to practice. No way he plays Sunday night.
Ted did something!!
Yer a Wizard, Aaron.
Fuck. I can't even imagine what went through their minds.
I do love the rapport that Al and Chris have together - but Tirico is awesome as well. It's a win-win in my book!
I'm sorry, there's just no way this is ever happening. 
Agree to disagree.
But he is a professional receiver in the NFL. He has to catch it. 

/s 
This argument of yours that "he's a professional NFL receiver and it hit him in the hands" is just weak. This happens to the best receivers every week in the NFL. Just becuase you're a professional NFL player, doesn't mean you have to catch *everything.*
Are you talking about 2014 Randall Cobb?
It's a terrible throw low and behind Randall, who has to stop his momentum to even have a chance. It hits him in the hands but at that point it's moot, that would have been a great catch given how bad the throw was. That's all on Aaron.
Here's the throw: https://twitter.com/AaronNagler/status/798579690130771968 

That's all on Rodgers - no excuse to throw it low and behind him on an easy pass. 
This whole album is fucking incredible. 
In only the way Lewis Black can. 
That's true. But I think the overarching issue here is that he was looking for "balanced" play - when right now this team is *anything but* balanced. When they went to the air on Sunday, which was a lot due to the deficit, they had production and have had production even when the team hasn't been in a deficit (Bears game as an example).
Absolutely agree with you on the missed throw to Cobb, no excuse on that from Aaron. 
I think you almost answered your own question.

1. Depleted secondary could mean the opposing offense scores at will
2. Best pass rusher not playing could mean the opposing offense moves the ball at will

Only way to keep up would be to get into "shootout" mode on offense. 
Completely. I've been a defender of MM for awhile - but the last 2 weeks have pushed me over the edge. 

His unwillingness to adjust his game plan, stay "balanced" on offense when it's CLEARLY not working and the personnel he puts on the field (Richard Rodgers playing over 50 snaps is ludicrous) just scream for a change at this point.
This is a great read and really highlights *why* it should be his last season. This quote just sums it up perfectly:


*I would fire him because in a game that was likely to become a shootout, he came out of the gate (with the gift of excellent field position) and ran the ball to James Starks for 3 yards, and ran the ball James Starks for 3 yards, and threw incomplete on 3rd down. It was boring, telegraphed, and most importantly, it did not work.* 

It shows the stagnation of his offensive philosophy and his almost refusal to adjust. 
RAAWR! 
Davante Adams is 4th in the NFL in TDs. One of 14 players with 10 or more catches of 20 yards. Catching 68% of his targets.

Right now he's playing at a WR1 level.
Have seen that a lot on this sub too, which is mind boggling. Also, people spelling Lacy, Lacey. Come on.
Yep, another bug I've noticed with Quick Reply on my 6. 
I mean, it's never easy to predict an injury. Rodgers had two in the same season in 2010 - and he hasn't had one since. Granted I know he plays a protected position, but you can never "easily predict" an injury.
This is spot. on. All this conjecture in hindsight is ridiculous. Injuries happen. It's part of the game.
But at the time it was the right move. There's no point to look back and say "what if" at this juncture. 
I got you bby. 
Football old != Real life old
Absolutely. That first throw to Cobb on 3rd down was such a bad throw. Cobb was WIDE open - and Aaron misses him low and left, and our field position comes out to mean nothing and we punt. If he completes that easy pass, you never know, we could have seen a different team today. 
I understand that Peppers has "disappeared." But we also have to take a look at a couple things here: 

1. The role they anticipated for him this year (which was less snaps, be in for passing downs) & 

2. Injuries (specifically Matthews).

It's extremely obvious how Matthews absence has affected the defense; and in his place you put Peppers who's probably playing double the amount of snaps they anticipated he'd play this year. He's what, 37? It's going to get to him. When he's been at the best for us in the past couple seasons it's been at the end of the year, when he's feeling fresh. That's not the case this year, and has absolutely affected his play. We need Clay back, and right away. 
And the Packers have lost 3 in a row. 4 of their last 5. 

We're not much better.
No one is getting fired in-season. 
Ted won't do anything mid-season. If anything he'll do it after the season. But I'm sure nothing will change.
Yep, and in 2009 they were 4-4, and finished 11-5. And I believe in 2010, started 3-3 and finished 10-6.

That ain't happening this year. 
Not sure why you're getting downvoted - this is 100% accurate. 
The Lions are going to win this division. Unreal.
I've been a defender of his, but not anymore. He has to go.
Yep. He has gone away from what has consistently worked in the Bears game. Why? Who the fuck knows at this point. 
McCarthy is.
And we get the same old tired excuse: "We need to win our 1 on 1's." 

Fucking ridiculous. 
At this point, why not.
2008
Yep. I can see us going 6-10 at this point.
Yep. -2 today. Really missing our secondary and Clay. Still - a pitiful performance.
I was one of the defenders. After the last 3 weeks - it's time for a change. Ted won't make the change until after the season, but it's 100% time for a change.

Parcells has always said the max shelf life for a head coach is 10 years with a team. 11th year for MM and look at what we've produced. Belicheck is the exception, not the rule. It's time to move on. 
MM: "Energy wasn't the problem. Execution was the problem. I thought our guys fought really well today."

Same old bull shit.
That's the end of the game right there. No way we get enough time to stage a comeback at this point.

What a pitiful performance. 
21-0 in the First Quarter. I'm not gonna lie, I'm gonna turn this game off in a little bit. No energy, no one seems to give a fuck out there. Man the fuck up and play football. What a disgrace.
Leave.
 No one looks like they even want to be out there.
What comments?
This team looks fucking pathetic. What a joke. 
In Special Teams? Of course on Defense, but not on Special Teams.
But the 2011 squad had a terrible overall defense. Favre would mop the floor on that D.
Well, that's sad. 
In 5 of his first 7 seasons he played in at least 15 games. This is really only the 2nd time in his career he's been out extended time for his hamstring. 
Nope, not in my eyes. When he's in there with Perry on the other side, they are a huge part of the success of this defense. He isn't going anywhere. 
Also, Matthews had played in at least 15 games in five of first seven seasons. Just second extended absence due to hamstring.
"They call it the Death Star"

*faints*

The cinematography in this looks amazing - I cannot wait.

You got a source on this poll?
It came at the perfect time. The "momentum" was shifting towards Cleveland after that 8th inning tying homer. Cubs had a chance in the 9th but couldn't score. Then the rain delay happened.

It came at the perfect time because it calmed down the team, the atmosphere and the players after the game said they all huddled together in the clubhouse and Jason Heyward gave them a mini speech. One they wouldn't repeat to the media because of how much it meant to them. They then come out and score 2 runs and win the World Series.

IMO, the rain delay changed everything. 
He did not practice today.
Could be. But luckily the Colts' front 7 is not that strong. 
This could actually be an error on my part, since I copied it from the tweet as "Football outsiders." Should have been: "Football Outsiders," otherwise it reads like there were some outside football consultants who uncovered the stat. 

So we can *really* blame BadgerNoonan for tweeting something grammatically incorrect :)
Will's is your #1 choice, but beware you'll need to get there pretty early to get a table. #2 choice would be Ranalli's in Old Town.
Tretter has easily had his best year as a pro though this year. He absolutely hasn't underperformed at all. I think Linsley is definitely more athletic than Linsley and is great when he gets to the second level, but Tretter is not far behind. With the way he's played this year people have been talking about JC keeping the C spot and moving Linsley to Guard. But, I think they are both very comparable and is a toss-up. Can't go wrong with either if both are healthy.
Well I've been a serious runner my entire life (Ran in college on scholarship), so I've seen Without Limits about 100 times as well! So I'm very biased to him playing Pre - and would put that at the top of my list. But of course Almost Famous is a *very* close second.
Reporters talked to him last week and he said he was. Been practicing fine and in pads, with apparently no issues.
Though his agent said there's a chance he could miss "no time at all," I think the Packers air on the side of caution this week and sit him out. Possibly activating Linsley, which would be great in my book.
Art, though feeling it now, Mr. Krabs?!
Billy Crudup is ageless.

Ken Bone giving some next level, /r/malefashionadvice right here. 
Nope! Good break for the Packers too, he has the most receiving yards in the NFL by a RB.
Still a legit stat line. As were the others - so next time when he asks in that manner, I will spout off that stat line. 
I guess that just shows the support of Packers fans. As this award is voted on by fans. 
The Packers offense doesn't play against the Bears offense. 
That's tough when the defenses are playing back and have that covered. Been a major theme so far this year - they've tried shot plays a bunch, but they have it covered most of the time. 
Everyone keeps saying "we need to play better on offense." What more do you need? To put up 50 points? Who cares that it was a 1-5 Bears team. It's still the NFL, it's a week-to-week league and they were *extremely* efficient on offense. 
All about match-ups. It was successful against the Bears, and that's all that matters. 
39/56 326 yds 3 TDs. That's why.
From one of the beat writers for Packersnews. I think it was on one of the Live Facebook chats. 
I'm more worried about Cobb and Matthews now on the Injury Report for hamstring injuries. 
Apparently the Packers medical staff had reservations about his knee. Probably the reason we didn't sign him. 
What episode is this again?
I obviously didn't see it, as I stated in the text. But still would like to. It's okay to remember Bart in the "good days" but I'd like to remember Bart now too. 
My apologies.
It literally says Sterling Sharpe in the tweet. 
The only other Green Bay WR to win the award was Greg Jennings in 2011. So awesome for Davante!
What? 5-11 is pretty standard for a CB in the NFL. 
He had x-rays and we heard they came back negative. The Packers practice today, and McCarthy speaks at 12:30 CST, so we'll find out more then. 
Well.. "technicaly" you're not 100% wrong, as they could possibly designate Ty as a RB now. (He did get recognition as a RB in ESPN Fantasy as of yesterday).
Apparently in camp/preseason he played a good amount in the slot and corner.
Your wish is granted: https://twitter.com/FieldYates/status/790636937837211648 
Could be. Or possibly a FA - you never know. 
I actually think it's going to be a CB - not Linsley yet. 
Actually surprised by this. But I guess if Ty is considered a RB now, then that's "technically" only 6 WRs on the roster now.
Yeah he came back for 1 practice, then was out the next, if I remember correctly.
Such is football, unfortunately. 
Anyway you could re-host this on Imgur?
Played through an injury the entire year. An ankle injury nonetheless. 
Reminded me of the Lacy run to start the 2nd half vs the Cowboys in 2013. Big runs like that spark something and that started that huge comeback.
[My reaction to OP's post.](http://i.imgur.com/xTfywfI.gif)
If that happens, there's no way MM gets sacked during the season. Ted will absolutely let the season play out. 
I live in Chicago. Anytime we get to play the Bears I'm jacked up. Fuck the noise with everything going on. LET'S TROUNCE THE BEARS.

I still have a feeling they are going to promote Jackson today. 
The guys mentioned in the story did an [AMA earlier today.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/58aaa6/back_in_june_two_guys_from_boston_found_a_missing/) Fascinating stories.
It's: /u/corterleather. He looks to be pretty active still, so maybe /u/Pancake_nips can contact him to get an answer. 

Yep, that's my gut feeling too. Rappaport also tweeted out yesterday that the Packers would be promoting Jackson from the PS before Thursday too. I still think that's what will happen.
He's not more established than Hyde. I'd say they are very comparable. 
Haha, this place is going to be a shitshow if he doesn't play on Thursday. 
I doubt he'll be used as a return man, since we have a premium on that spot. 
Think TT would give up a draft pick for him?

EDIT: Turns out Packers gave up a conditional late-round pick for Davis. 
Yeah it's not from today. OP didn't state it was from today.
**Fuck McGinn.**
Looks like they're clearing some room per Ryan Wood: https://twitter.com/ByRyanWood/status/787365281534468100 
I wouldn't be surprised to see them make a roster move later today and possibly bring Jackson up from the PS. 
This must have happened at practice today, too. Definitely concerning.
I think he'll be back (he's been back in meetings), but I'm sure he's had those conversations and thoughts, for his long term health. 
Don Jackson. They would have to activate him from the practice squad. 
Not in this last game. Coverage was atrocious, along with the punting game. Kickoffs were fine, but coverage overall was terrible.
Their offense has actually put up big numbers. Execution in crunch time has been the problem. You can't overlook anyone in this league, ever. 
I'm gonna go with: Eddie plays, Starks and Damarious don't.
Yeah he's playing. He said so here: https://twitter.com/drewdavison/status/786998883209453568 
Agree to disagree.
Right, I know that. I was responding to DesiredFX letting him know that he was on the injury report, but doesn't mean he's out - since he was questioning that he hasn't sealed his starting spot at Center (which I believe his play has solidified that).
Right, but he still contributes and gets the ball. When Eddie is Eddie, he can really tilt the field in the way defenses play -- I can almost guarantee MM knows and values that, which is why I believe he'll be back after this season.
Agreed - I still think we'll see him play on Sunay afternoon. Rodgers hinted at that in his locker room media session and Lacy thinks he'll be ready for Sunday too.
I would disagree on that point. Why keep Starks for 7 years then? If he just valued the running game and *not* the running back, he would constantly be churning over RB's. I just find that very hard to believe.  
But McCarthy values running backs. He may go away from it during the game a lot, but he strongly believes in being able to establish the running game, which hopefully opens up the passing game. It's core to how his offense runs. Hence why I just can't see them letting him go.
Linemen's dream!
Very much so. Doesn't hurt that Tretter can play any position on the line too - extremely versatile. 
Yeah he definitely seems to be feeling better, but I honestly don't think we'll see him for a few weeks. He *just* started participating in meetings this week. Still hasn't practiced and it being his 5th concussion, no way this staff is bringing him back until he's 100%. The secondary stepped up big time vs the Giants, so the coaches have confidence in them, so they probably don't want to rush anything with Sam.

I think we're reading too much into this IG post too about him being able to play, I think he's mostly about his new cleats, which he mentions.
They don't practice on Fridays. When they release the Injury Reports, Friday has an * by it stating they didn't practice, and is an estimation on if they practiced, what capacity would the players have participated.
Are you watching the same player this year as everyone else? He's been fantastic this year so far. 
He showed up on the Injury Report yesterday for the first time - doesn't mean he's hurt and out for the game. 
And look how quick Tretter is too. He gets up field fast and all of a sudden is running next to Adams and Jordy. Really athletic.
Completely agree. Just don't see them letting him get away. 
Why?
Definitely one of the more puzzling trends that MM has been doing. Eddie gets in a rhythm, is having success in running the ball, and then decides to stop handing him the ball. 
I don't think he actually looks slow here at all. When he gets through the hole to the 2nd level he takes off. Looks *much* better than last year.
This is  the injury report/practice report from yesterday. 

Today in practice, Shields, Cook, Banjo, Starks were all out. 
Honestly? I wouldn't be surprised if they carried 6 WRs instead of the 7 now. And it wouldn't shock me if it was Abby.

But I'm just guessing. Who knows, MM could just throw Montgomery back there. All that being said, I think Lacy is still going to play.
Defense bailed him out big time on Sunday. Their average starting field position was close to the 40 after his punts. Just dreadful - and it's worrisome thinking what he might be like in the cold of December..
They 100% will activate him if that's the case.
Cunt.
And you know that is John Krasinski just holding back laughter as much as possible. Haha, it's so evident in this picture too.
I'm pretty sure the ones they're wearing on Sunday aren't yellow pants - they're the color in that picture you included.
More like 20/20 smile.
Too soon.
True! Dude is a hell of a player. 
Actually from what I remember, there were some "separation issues" even before the Denver game (Receivers not getting open) - which still seems to be a common theme this year. 
Amen, brother!
Agreed, to a degree. But if there's one person who I'm least worried about on the offense, it's Rodgers. 
This stat is not necessarily specific to Rodgers, just the offense as a whole. However, Ryan did post a follow-up tweet for Rodgers' comparison: https://twitter.com/ByRyanWood/status/785918086012628993 
Good point. But the first thing that comes to mind about possible INTs for Hyde.. 2013 playoffs vs. 49ers. That dropped INT would have been a complete game changer. 
Absolutely love your videos! Will the operating costs of Point-to-Point aviation be brought down, if that's the future of aviation?
Wasn't that fumbled by Adams though?
Such a brain fart on my part, my bad! 
As some of you know, Justin and the band grew up in Eau Claire and released their new album last week. Thought this tid-bit about the Packers was fantastic. 
[This](http://i.imgur.com/F0gfjhT.jpg) was posted in /r/boniver about the song. 
I honestly think he was drafted for depth on the OL, specifically the Tackle position. We all saw what happened when we threw a couple different players at LT (I'd like to forget the Sitton experiment..) last year with injuries to Bakh. Tretter stepped in admirably in the playoffs, but it's always nice to draft/have a "pure" Tackle if and when injuries occur. 
Highly doubt that. It would be what we saw against the Lions - putting Hawkins at corner in replacement of Randall. 
And Michael Cohen just reported Damarious Randall dropped out of practice with an apparent finger injury: https://twitter.com/Michael_Cohen13/status/783010238689636352

I anticipate a well-balanced and fair response on this. 
There ya go. Fairly sure Loyola's team disbanded in the early 40's as well. 
Absolutely agreed! Wanted to share to see the community's thoughts. 
Since 1941.. did you happen to go to Loyola University Chicago? If so, great to see other Ramblers here!

Ay, brotha. 
http://i.imgur.com/2txXuZK.jpg
Yep, absolutely. Fargo got absolutely snubbed though. 
Definitely. Just doesn't bode well for a unit that is already thin on guys. 
He doesn't step into throws anymore, it's really concerning. However..

I know everyone in here is saying that something needs to change. And I would agree.. on play-calling. MM emphasized winning the 1-on-1 matchups this year, but through 2 games, it's not there. I know it's early. But scheme and set plays are nuances the staff needs to bring back. Our defense was the reason we had a chance today, and if Aaron could get in *some* rhythm, we might have seen a different result.

But I'm not going to be throwing hyperbole's all over after two games. It was a tough division opponent, on the road, after starting on the road in the first game. We're 1-1 with **FOURTEEN** games to play. Let's not act like the sky is falling. With the talent this team has on *both* sides of the ball, I can't simply jump to that realm yet. Let the season play out. 
Fun fact: He was the guy that Tolzien put the spin move on for his touchdown vs the Vikes at Lambeau in 2013.
http://i.imgur.com/MnVLN.gif
This is the Modern Era nominees. He would have to be selected through the Senior Committee (and unfortunately they didn't pick him *again* this year). A travesty.
Need those sick fadez, tho.
Had no idea you could do this. Was in the process of updating on my iPhone 6, and seeing all the failures in this thread, went in and deleted the update file. 

I, like a lot of other people in this thread, are at work with on access to iTunes and would be phoneless for the rest of the day if it failed. Thank you for pointing this out! 
Completely agree. And with Shields getting treated for a concussion, there's a high chance Rollins starts opposite of Randall next week vs the Vikes. Showtime baby.
Had a concussion last season that sidelined him for a few games. I believe this one is only his 2nd. 
And for Rollins to step up late in the game with Shields out. That contested play vs Robinson in the end zone was phenomenal. Yeah he was beat early and got benched, but when they needed him, he stepped up. Absolutely love that!
Signed a 1 year deal with the Packers. They must be set with Jayrone. 
Congratulations! My wife and I celebrated our 1 year anniversary yesterday as well! 
[Called it](https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBayPackers/comments/4zlnvq/packers_punting_battle_tightens_as_peter_mortell/d6xm1o4). Was rooting for him, but no way they were going to let Tim go that easy.
So random to see Brookfield posted on here. I grew up in La Grange! 
Yes, this is exactly what happened. He adjusted the route and is why he put his hand up so early, once Conte sat at the marker.
Nelson is definitely not playing tonight. He hasn't even been involved in 11-v-11 in training camp. I bet we won't see him at all in preseason. 
I'm rooting for Mortell too, it's a great story and would be an amazing chance for him.

However, knowing GB and the coaching staff, I almost guarantee Masthay will win the job back. Mark my words.

Seriously, save this comment. 
Noticed that as well - seems like Brandt just picked from a few quotes Aaron said over the past couple weeks in interviews and molded a story into it.  
I'm guessing you referring to his flair? Looks like The Devil's Rejects to me.

Have watched these bloopers a thousand times. Krasinski's laugh/giggle is so amazing.
[Sure.](https://www.google.com/search?hl=fr&site=&q=the+office+dinner+party+episode)
I don't expect them to miss an entire season. I just think right now would be an opportune time for the NFLPA to take a stand and push back on Goodell. Who knows though, maybe something will come of this.
Read that article this morning as well, he does a great job. Good to see him writing for MMQB now, too.
Really surprised that the NFLPA is not fighting the NFL more on this. This is setting a dangerous precedent for future precedings and the overall wielding of power Goodell seems to have now. 

I know as Packers fans we are selfish in not wanting our players to be suspended, but this is interesting on the side of the NFLPA.  

Edit: Looks like Harrison is meeting *after* the proposed date set by the NFL. Peppers and Clay don't have date sets yet, and Mike Neal (current FA) hasn't agreed to interview. This is gonna drag on..
