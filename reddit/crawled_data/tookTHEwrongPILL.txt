Hard to believe the American government wouldn't want us to work even more than we do. I legitimately consider a 40 hour workweek part time
But it's not accurate to say Denmark is more technologically advanced than the US, because it provides its citizens with things most people want their taxes to provide. It's an entirely separate thing. 
While I support it, I don't think universal healthcare and better transportation represent technological advancement. They represent values
What about a Honda which is built in Britain?
Oh I did the right thing and moved to the West coast. The tough thing here is that they pronounce every town how it looks... And I'm so used to butchering town names 
May I join in on the pointing and laughing? 
Naahhh we have Worcester in Massachusetts (pronounced Wooster) I'm guessing yours is pronounced woostershr?
So they offer a symmetrical plan...
They're likely throttling your service so that they have a 'better' service available to people who want to pay more for it. Just the way the market works. Wouldn't cost them any more to give you a better speed.
Yeah I think it's your ISP. With fiber it's inherently the same speed. 
Fiber... Up is the same as down
The fact that what's Aleppo is the worst thing anyone has to say about him, tells me he was the best candidate in 2016. 
I'm probably not supposed to say this, but I really don't enjoy seeing Carrie Fischer. Just not an interesting actor to watch. Nostalgia is wonderful though
You're talking about another thing now. Earnings over lifetime. People with a degree are more likely to be better candidates for a job, just in general even if a degree is not required. So obviously college graduates on average over the whole pool are going to earn more money. It's not a very telltale statistic, IMO. 
Not trying to get into an argument, but it sure seems like nearly everyone I know has a degree, and the majority of them don't make a lot, and certainly their first jobs were usually shitty paying. Interestingly, the two highest earners I know personally don't have a degree. I'm going to guess I live (d) in a skewed state though. 
I know many college graduates earning less than 40k. Sure that's partially because they don't want to relocate, but it's still a fact
I didn't realize that it's been tried
You make valid points but you ignored my question for the most part. I'll word it differently. How do you make a parallel system in which Mark Zuckerberg creates Facebook and earns a lot of money, but instead of billions he earns millions, and the rest of the money he would've earned goes to the employees. So instead of one billionaire and a bunch of lower middle class people, you have a bunch of millionaires boosting the economy with their extra money. How do we let capitalism continue existing while not funneling billions to individual people?
Or maybe with votes?
Seems like that'd be tough to make work with a population of 350 million, what are your thoughts?
Social responsibility is inherently omitted from capitalism; how do you suggest greed gets eliminated from capitalism? 
Not a fan of capitalism, eh?
You are all my children
It's not a story the Cardinals would tell you
Hold me closer Tony danza- by Elton John
Sounds like your thirteen year old swapped bottles
Alex Jones is a capitalist.
There doesn't seem to be much evidence of this in states and cities which have increased minimum wage. Increased wages mean more people can buy more products, thus boosting the economy. 
Hey, Zerg was always my fave to play
So is a government forced high minimum wage the only solution?
There is no source, just my speculation. American made goods cost more. 
Replaced by who? I'm saying that it's the responsibility of unskilled labor (hate that term because if you get rid of unskilled labor everything in society stops working) to agree to a higher wage and better working conditions
You don't think it comes down to the employees? If they were literally not willing to work for that money and conditions, Amazon would have to raise the pay and better the conditions, right?
They pay that little and work people too hard because enough people are willing to do it. If most people wouldn't take the pay for that much work, Amazon would have to pay them more and/or lower their standards. Pretty sure it's that simple
But if things actually cost what they should (all workers involved make a good salary) then nobody would actually be able to afford anything. So what gives?
Leaves room for at least one movie. What happened once the republic fell and became an empire? How did that actually happen? What did palp and Vader do for a couple decades (more?) Before the events of rogue one happened? All this is more interesting to me than a han solo movie
Yeah, I hadn't thought of that, but I agree with you there should have been more Vader suit time. It's almost as if episode one was a waste of fucking time and they should've basically started with Anakin at episode 2 age.
Do you think ignorant people should vote? 
I understand why it didn't win best picture, but RoTS is the most epic in the series to me. Definitely some corny aspects to it, but every episode has them. 
Maybe we should all pay a dollar per month. 
Hmm so I should pick up smoking cigarettes, by that logic

Life without flannel just isn't worth living
But for months it's too hot to go outside. Plus the cost of living is too high for being so far from the ocean. Wicked fun city though
Good stuff!
Become a regular somewhere? Only place I can think of is a bar, which I'm cool with. Just wondering if you were thinking of another kind of place
Yup. My tibia snapped in half, knee was point of impact. Tibia totally healed, 95% there. Knee causes pain and problems regularly after four surgeries.
Vote for fucking who?! Hillary god damn Clinton wasn't gonna fix this. And neither is the Challenger to Ted Cruz' Senate seat. We vote for Representatives who then don't give a shit what their poor constituents want. 
He didn't say William shatner
OP already said they work two jobs, seems insensitive at best to suggest they work even more. 
I'm sure your intention is good here, but telling someone to just go earn more money isn't very constructive, IMO.

You're describing a sandwich with one key ingredient missing
I will agree that it's an entree when things are added to it. Pulled pork is a good example. Also, tuna and peas (yum!). 
But, no dishes
There's water in beer, so I have that part covered
That basketball score helps take me away from my anger. No use in being pissed off about my government all the time. It's just gonna keep me unhealthy, which is no good because my government won't pay for me to get healthy again
Or maybe it's because they work for shareholders. Maybe the stock market is what's largely to blame.
But their money trickles down! We need them!

Don't forget northern New England. Technically fewer firearm restrictions (read: none) than most southern States. It's about one human per square mile though so nothing bad happens really. 
Why is your comment allowed to exist then?
This is what millennials need to do: stop paying anything more than like 300k for a house, ever. Million dollar houses are supposed to be mansions and architectural masterpieces for rich folks, not middle class earners.
No nothing special just the original Pokemon from when there weren't any other Pokemon. I think I'd rather just hold on to them than make a couple hundred bucks.

Big if true
So many people think I'm a clown for respecting someone like Gary Johnson, who acknowledges that he isn't the most proficient person alive at all aspects of governing. 'but he isn't team red, or team blue!' I felt so good about voting for a candidate who was able to say: honestly I'm not knowledgeable enough about that to make critical decisions, I would surround myself with people who ARE.
I agree with you. But, even Democrats haven't agreed to education for all. Everyone here on Reddit wants to pretend like if we get a blue Congress in 2018 and a blue president in 2020, everything will get better. Thing is, Democrats have controlled government before and we still have a ridiculously low minimum wage, no universal education or healthcare, nevermind other things we need. 
So how do we convince 137 million voters that there's a better way?
Unless I'm mistaken, you just described why capitalist democracy will always fail the masses.
Your comment wasn't helpful at all. What problem am I part of and what can I do to resolve the problem?
I completely agree with you that's why I'm confused... I was describing the situation in my locality, that's all. 
Can you elaborate on what you're trying to get at? 
It certainly doesn't make up for it but it's still a positive step I think.
Right after I have a good salary and don't have to work 50 hours a week. Maybe when I'm 70? IDK, what do you think? I don't understand why people running for office need so much money with the internet; YouTube and social media. 
We don't need to worry about saving the Earth, just the humans. 
What are you getting at? You're confusing me, and I'm wondering if i'm miscommunicating
You aren't getting laid for weeks
Fucking others extra hard? Where did you get that from? 
While I'm aware that you are correct, I live in a very white state. Because of this, the rare black folks who do live here actually have a very long leash because law enforcement does not want to be seen as racist. Basically, minorites have to really try to get in trouble with police here.

An over correction I suppose, but one I'm cool with. 
It's also a good thing. Marijuana is technically illegal but society has decided it's fine so we use it. 
Netflix is a fair value but also so limited. You also need Amazon video, Hulu, HBO now, and will still have to purchase most movies separately through Vudu or something. And then you still don't have access to sports. 
I agree with you on all counts. What are you missing? Possibly, that because far too many people were told to or felt pressured to not speak out about being sexually assaulted in the past, society has started doing the right thing and encouraging that behavior (which is the right thing to do IMO). But, 'we' have overcorrected I'd say, by doing things like calling an unwanted touch on the arm and rape the same thing: sexual assault. So anyway, SOME victims of sexual assault/harassment are feeling like that arm touch or someone looking at them in a way they don't like should just as reprehensible, and therefore as punishable, as actual rape. So myself and others have started to become a bit paranoid because an accuser only has to say the words (he/she sexually assaulted me) to ruin someone's reputation. Because we have overcorrected, too many people are afraid to even question an accusation.
Reads like sarcasm; if it is, what could I be more (actually) modest about? There wasn't meant to be any self promotion in what I said fwiw
You mean Einstein wasn't born in America?!
Women initiate sex with me much more often than I with them. When women aren't teenagers anymore and become confident and secure with their body, things get much more fun.

Also, I've absolutely been 'taken advantage of' when I was drunk, even as a 6'3 215lb guy who's currently in my 30s. There's a double standard involved here and I'm ok with it. I don't have sex with women who are clearly wasted, unless I have a sexual history with her. I can overpower nearly any woman, most women cannot overpower me. 
Yes it is, though I'm not sure why you're mentioning that here
Democrats vote blindly too. I've been outcast and insulted, in life and on Reddit, for not voting for Hillary Clinton. I wanted to vote for a Democrat, but not that one. I chose who I thought was the best option.

While we're shunning and insulting republican voters, we need to keep in mind that Democratic voters are similar in many ways.
Seems like a Reddit design flaw. And an easy fix. Is there a good reason why we need to see responses to (automoderator) bots? Seems to me they should just go as a DM to an actual moderator if anything

Not quite the same, but in Iceland there's an app for people to check how closely related they are to prospective sexual partners. 
Every news outlet I saw reported that Hillary was winning in the primaries handily from the get go, because the super delegates were already being reported. It was at the very least, in bad taste. So many people didn't even know and maybe still don't understand what superdelegates are.
Portland JR is where I'll be living
I'm moving from Maine to Oregon, I know there are courses out there in hoping they're as good as here. Maine has the best disc courses in the Northeast by far. I've been spoiled here
It's such a cheap hobby/activity and it's just really great getting out there and having something to do while walking through the woods. I still can't backhand for shit, can only flick, but I'm good enough to not hold up better players, and even though I can only flick, I often am floating around par on courses I'm familiar with.
But it's going to instill confidence in the wife if the stripper isn't more attractive than her. It's the way to go if the wife is involved, I think. If wife is an 8 get a stripper who's a 6 or 7

Moving from New England to Portland Oregon very soon, what kind of temps are we talking? I'd much rather hike in 40s/50s than summer weather... Summer is for beaches and disc golf and motorcycle riding
Just spent three weeks in rural Ohio, that's exactly how I felt. People were nice, but I just knew better than to suggest I didn't hate everyone who hadn't lost their teeth by 40 
I certainly hope so. 
Dems aren't as blatantly detrimental as Republicans, but they've been in control before, and minimum wage is still half what it should be, 16 year olds can buy firearms, healthcare is too expensive for decent coverage, and we still have people in prison for smoking weed. 

What's going to actually change the next time Dems control everything? 
And then when Dems still don't pass bills to help us all, who do we vote for then? 
I doubt it. 
Too late now
I'd say so. Had androids up until the iPhone x release. That's about 13 years of phone use. Android does some things better, for sure. But iOS is significantly more intuitive, and much smoother overall. I mostly owned flagship android phones, and the iPhone x has made me realize how slow they all were, how much they lagged and how often aps crashed.
I have the iPhone x and will continue to call it the eks. They've never used Roman numerals and I don't like inconsistency. It's a great phone though. Would've stayed with Android if the pixel 2 didn't have larger bezels than the Samsung I had five years ago. 
Humor is how we deal with things which instill emotions we don't want to feel. Humor keeps the thing alive and in our thoughts while letting us continue on. 
With Hillary it was a guarantee, with Trump I think people saw it as a likelihood but not a guarantee
I think people are very upset that she was the one we were 'supposed'to vote for. She was certainly a better option than Trump, but she was an awful candidate. A vote for Clinton was an assurance that government continues to be absurdly corrupt. 
His daughter will do the soundtrack

Oregon seems like the better version of California, spent some time in Portland recently
In greater LA at least, that state is a barren wasteland. No water, barely any natural vegetation... The hills are cool to look at and drive around, but I certainly want to see more green stuff. Maybe northern California is prettier? 
Understandable
Wannabe Southerners, that's a great way to put it lol. Much better work ethic here though, at least in my limited exposure, than in the South.
I'm actually in Ohio right now for work. Surprising to me that in a town with a population of nearly twenty thousand and not far from two large cities, how behind it is here. Now, I'm only aware of this town so I won't make judgement on the whole state, but so far seems like a regressive community overall.
Yikes, Southeast? I don't think anyone is paying that little up here in New England
Sorry if I miscommunicated, but all I was saying is that they don't have a better opportunity or they wouldn't be there. No insults were implied. Whereas people working at the white House likely do have other opportunities that are highly rewarding, meaning it's an entirely different situation. That's all. 

I work retail earning 13$ an hour, buddy. I'm right there with you at the bottom of the barrel.
The people who voted for him deserve blame. You seem to be as hateful as Trump and his voters. I'm sorry that you think I'm naive, but I don't think I am at least not on this front. By voting for Hillary, you told the Democratic party that you like their nomination for the the position. What does that say? Putting the ball in your court instead of insulting you. 
I don't agree that I lack decency. I was, and am, an informed voter. As an informed voter, I decided that Hillary Clinton was not a good candidate for POTUS. It's silly, at minimum, for you to suggest that Gary Johnson or Jill Stein had a smidge of racism in either of their characters or their platform. They were both strongly for (actual) social justice and liberty. Can't say the same for Hillary, who was strongly against equal freedoms for people who wanted to have sex with others of the same sex. She pandered, and only at the last second. 
I'm unable to connect that with what I said
I make an effort to be objective and consider each issue on its own. Maybe I responded to the wrong person but I thought you said you were conservative. To which I asked if you think everything is great and we don't need to change anything in society. 
As a conservative, you're saying you think the way things are now are great? You don't want any changes? That's what it means to be conservative. If you think changes need to be made, you are a progressive or a regressive. 
I hope you or your loved ones don't need an abortion over there
This is a little different though; people are likely working at Burger King because they can't find a more rewarding job. People who leave the white House will probably be getting a better paying job.
Reminds me of a saying we have for Nantucket: 'where millionaires mow the lawns of billionaires'
Russian meddling is real. And it's bad, and it needs to be stopped. But Russia did not vote for president Trump. Americans did. Democracy depends on informed citizens to work, and much of America has no interest in being informed. Most people don't want a democracy, they want a dictatorship which aligns with their views.
But still over 50 million people. And I still regularly find people supporting him. I don't know how to change that either because they are mostly uninformed, and they aren't interested in changing that. 

Unfortunately for many people here, when I became informed I not only figured out Trump was an awful candidate, but Hillary was too. Fortunately there were two others on the ballot I had a lot more respect for. I'll be happy to vote blue when they put an actual progressive on the ballot.
It's not fair to say libertarian is a form of republican. Libertarians believe in liberty, so abortion and drugs would be legal, as well as prostitution. But, libertarians believe in responsible spending as well, which the Republicans only claim to believe in when they aren't in power
It's just because they want your body heat. Cold blooded and such
What about all the people who don't visit Reddit every day all day, and don't see all the reposts you mention?
No, Trump won because more than fifty million people voted for him. It's my, and your, responsibility as a voter to choose the best option. That's why we vote. We don't vote to choose the lesser evil. 
We wanted to elect Bernie. The private organization called the DNC made sure Americans didn't get what they wanted. The baby boomers time to fuck us over will come to an end.

Which supplements?
So does it really boil down to just a traffic issue? Don't get me wrong I agree it's a huge problem, I've done plenty of work in Boston. But what if Amazon set up shop like a half hour outside the city? A location just on the other side of 95? They wouldn't be able to find enough land in Boston proper anyway I suspect.
No, that's not what you do. It's not plain and simple. You're sounding like bill Maher, who I generally like and listen to, but you and he are wrong in this instance. If I vote for Hillary, I'm telling the party and everyone else that she's good enough. She wasn't, and isn't. I, as an informed voter, will vote for who I think the best candidate on the ballot is. Gary Johnson and Jill Stein mostly aligned with my views. That probably doesn't make sense but they actually shared a lot of views, just had a different way of implementing them. Regardless, my job as a voter is not to vote for the lesser evil, it's to vote for the candidate who I think is best. I hope you also decide to do that in the future.
The bottom line is the GOP doesn't have to 'win' when the Democrats are so readily willing to 'lose'
I really wish you would stop with insulting people without higher education. I decided not to go into debt for higher education. I'm not an ignorant fuckface. You're just alienating 'uneducated' but not ignorant people who don't support Trump.
Hillary was an awful candidate. I'm sorry you feel the way you do, but I'm not going to vote for her. Ever. I voted for Gary Johnson, and Jill Stein was my second option. You aren't recognizing reality and you aren't recognizing that Hillary was obviously the worst Democratic candidate in a long while. Trump wouldn't have defeated a decent one. 
But, obviously that's not what he meant 
Amazon is almost certainly aiming for the DC area. Bezos just bought a home there. 
Boston housing costs are already maxed out. If you massholes (I kid, as a Mainer, but seriously) would agree to the half percent income tax increase to completely overhaul and expand the T, Amazon would be great for greater Boston. A few thousand more people earning six figures couldn't possibly raise the housing cost, which is already too high for barely six figure earners
Exactly my point
I came back at you a bit harshly, sorry for that. I suppose what it comes down to is I'd like to be part of the change, but it's just not plausible unfortunately. And this is part of the problem: it's mostly just people who have money already, something to fall back on, who can legislate. And at that point they are disconnected from reality.
Find me a job in which I have time for that, and I would certainly consider it. I'm currently on a 18 day project across the country from a place in which I don't even live in, just kinda staying there. 

I'm moving to a major metro very soon, maybe I'll be able to find a 40 hour (part time, essentially) 9 to 5 that actually pays a decent wage, but I doubt it. In the meantime, I'm still permitted to have opinions on things as long as I'm not ignorant about them.
Can you elaborate on that? 
In that case, before any accusations get thrown at any of your friends, maybe you should decide right now if you think there's any chance greater than zero that any of them could do anything you find objectionable. And then, don't wait for an accusation. Just tell them you don't trust them. You can never be 100% certain. Your judgement (and mine) is not reliable. I certainly wouldn't want you as a friend.
I agree with you about roy he's a dirt bag in all the worst ways, but I wouldn't distance myself from a friend because of one accusation. An accusation is just that. Imagine being falsely accused and losing your entire support system... Could you go back to being friends with those people?
Puts me in a pickle. I'm a progressive, and a liberal (the real kind, not a SJW), but I'm 'uneducated'. I have chosen not to go into debt for an education which may or may not help me in life. Interestingly, 'liberals' like to confuse uneducated with ignorant. 

Bottom line is I'm alienated from both major parties and won't vote for either until one of them puts forth an actual progressive. 
You would stop associating with someone because of an accusation? Or are you saying Roy specifically, because of many accusations?
Even if it's been tested? Are you just 'morally' against it or is there actual substance behind even occasional use being super unhealthy? Or are you saying it's always unhealthy in the same sense sour patch kids are always unhealthy?
Either of these are better than my five 12s 😞
Same in New England. Traffic/weather can change everything so miles is usually irrelevant. 
The rsx was literally a Civic. The type S was the Civic SI
We'll never know because it's never been tried
Holy shit she was gorgeous
You CAN. Huge distinction. If you work retail or food industry you still can't afford housing in those cities. 
So you're talking about personal preference. Those cities are not the only major metros by any means. Minneapolis, Portland, Austin, Atlanta, Charlotte, just to give you multiple climate options. So, the locations which you personally like (that's a very short list) are expensive. Housing prices are still much higher than what my parents and grandparents paid, but they aren't the major problem you and many others make them out to be. If you can't afford your city, move. 
Take away California, Seattle, DC, NYC, Boston, annnd idk am I missing anything? In the VAST majority of this country you can get a house for under 300k. In fact there are lots of places where you can get a decent house for 100-150k. California is an anomaly. Hawaii too obviously. 
Saw LA for the first rice recently; that place is a barren wasteland. Honestly curious: what are you going to do about water when your 'neighbors' don't want to share anymore? 
In the majority of America, yes. That gets you a very nice home. 
Pretty sure there's an app for that. We can all do this. We can make governments and companies who are sitting on billions collapse of we're all on the same page. Too many people are ok with ridiculously low wages and insignificant raises.
Communism is rule by the working class, right? It takes an assumption that the working class will always be the majority, but if it's majority rule then it's not authoritarian is it?
Which Nations are actually socialist? Socialism doesn't allow for the privatization of any industry does it? 
Exactly. By definition, I'm a liberal. But most of these Democrats are not liberals. 
Well, has communism actually ever happened? Most people I talk to confuse authoritarian government with communism, which confuses me greatly because communism is supposed to be far from authoritarianism
My point is I didn't find the area around the falls interesting. Beautiful waterfalls as part of a trip to a national park or something is worth it, but I would've been let down (to say the least) if I made a special trip to Niagara just to see the falls. Luckily I was in the area for work. 

Edit: plus, the hard Rock being there made it seem more corny.
Definitely not worth a special trip. If someone is already in the area, within a couple hours or so, definitely check out Niagara. But, it's just a bunch of water and a hard rock overrun by tourists.
I have lived in them, and we generally consider them one area anyway. I spend a lot of time in all three. 
Nah we generally consider northern New England it's own region. 
I murdered some gin last night actually. Left no traces
I live in them
I mean, my state doesn't have an income tax or a sales tax, I feel like that's the opposite of commie. Whatever though
Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont... 
Which team are you on? /S

But really, too many people just find a tribe and stick to a doctrine. That's so incredibly harmful. 
Not like everywhere else. There are plenty of states where the entire state is safe. If you like where you live, that's cool, but you can live in a safe place if you want to. 
This is not murica this is a good human being. They exist elsewhere too.
The court made the right decision on citizens United. The government went in there and told the judges that they (the government) would be willing to ban a book under the right circumstances. The case was decided right then. The government should have hired a better lawyer. I damn well hope the supreme Court rules against banning books. 

Blame Congress, not the court.
You clearly don't understand what freedom is /s
But how can grams be both mass and weight? I was taught that your grams don't change from one planet to another... But obviously weight does.
Can you explain to me how grams per liter works? Google is not helping me... For an application, think how Europe and probably everywhere not called the US figures out BAC.
Is there a sub for the opposite? I saw a woman today pushing what I think I think were just b cups up to her neck. I wanna see women reveal those.
Dammit racist fucks are everywhere. Where do I go?
Good. I don't want to be a customer, because that means I'm participating in crony capitalism.
No, I don't see ads when I watch porn
Do you pay for porn? 
I'll be joining you in Oregon soon (from Maine). Hoping to get away from all the ignorant racist fuck faces. Cheers!
Why the fuck are you fucking censoring your fucking self? 
Maybe guns should be free, too
I thought so. I'm guessing people think I support Ajit. I don't at all, but he's just playing the game our government created for him to play. Disregard all others in order to succeed yourself. 
He's a capitalist. He represents that flag well.
Two separate things. IPAs and Belgian ales. 
Fair enough. Must have gone to the wrong places
Limerick, Cork and Galway. All City centre. Must have gone to the wrong places. I really enjoyed my stay and can't wait to go  back.
I couldn't find one good IPA or Belgian either. 
Guinness is fine, certainly better than Budweiser and the like. 
Fair enough. And... Maybe I'm just spoiled by the beer selection in America? I visited Limerick Cork and Galway and I pretty much gave up on finding tasty beer. I really appreciate all the whiskey everywhere though. Does the rest of Europe have as poor a beer selection?
Food in Ireland is so much better than food in America, at least on average. Only had one bad meal there, and honestly it just made me think of an average meal in the states. Fwiw, I do like kinda basic things. Stews and seafood and such is perfect for me. Really wish you guys had better beer though.
I went to Ireland about a year ago, their beer selection is quite awful. At least compared to US. Good thing I'm quite happy with whiskey 
Probably started as a big block of wood
But how sorry are you, really?
So the long wooden cooking spoons my gram used to chase us with when we were being little assholes?
5/7 would make moves on '72 oprah
Well hey, fair enough. I'm no supporter of the tax bill, though we definitely needed to lower the corporate rate. What they also should have done is eliminate all loopholes
I'm no fan of Paul Ryan (if he wants any credibility he should be shitting all over Trump) but is there any substance for this claim of a small group including the kochs writing the tax bill?
The kochs wrote the tax bill?
I've listened to a couple of podcasts about the kochs and it seemed to me that they want good things for this country. There were a couple things I wasn't on board with but overall it seemed positive; can you explain the hate? I know it's hard to tell here on Reddit but I'm genuinely curious
What's an assault weapon?
Don't fooking say it!
Just don't hit on any woman under 30. 
It's pronounced schedule, like gif 
You're not doing the proper drugs
The US government went into the supreme Court and told Justice Kennedy it would be willing to ban books. What did you expect to happen? Kennedy always upholds the first amendment. Rule on the side of the US government which is willing to blatantly suppress free speech? I don't think so. Congress is to blame here; the court, seemingly to me, did their job and made the right decision.
Ugh! More lembas bread?!
Ugh! More lembras bread?!
We could start by letting the southeast secede like I think they still want to
I'm an older millennial (31). My parents are at the tail end of boomers. Literally the last two years of it. Everyone in their 20s is a millennial, and likely have younger parents than I do. So, gen xers for parents for nearly everyone in their 18-28 or so
Sounds like an interesting journey
I gave up after ten or twenty ... Seemed interesting but I just couldn't figure out some things. Maybe I should read a physics book
Yeah I'd much rather drown than be burned to death
Aahh i gotcha. 
Can you elaborate on that?
It's simple: they want to be a parent. What they don't think about is: does a human want to be raised by them, with no money, no worldly experiences, and a lesser chance of success in life? No, they don't think about that.
Nice?
Incorrect. Only have to pay us taxes over a certain (quite high) income level.
No, only above a certain amount which is quite high. 
Totally agree with you. If I had kids I would certainly not hold them back.
Totally agree with you. People let their family guilt trip them into not moving to a place they may be happier. If your family is against you pursuing happiness then they aren't good people to be around. They can come visit you a couple times a year and you can go back 'home' a couple times. 

You=anyone
It's a Bill Maher bit
Gotcha. Keep at it, and you'll get to where you want to be :)
I look sick at my recommend BMI. BMI is a joke. Just saying...
Yeah, I genuinely don't understand how life without sandwiches and burgers even works
No haggling? Just like buying a bag of crisps from the market?
I'm really starting to think eating nothing but meat and veggies is where it's at...
How tall are you? Just curious, I'm quite thin at 205 and I'm 6'3
I don't think there are any millennials in high school at this point by my understanding... I know the generation thing isn't black and white though. 20s to mid 30s is my understanding of millennial. Do I have it all wrong?
So Seattle went from being very expensive to still very expensive you're saying
https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/fortune/2015/04/13/who-makes-15-per-hour

42.4 % earn less than 15/hr
But the cost of living in those cities didn't go up after they raised minimum wage... The cost of living was already very high and raising minimum wage is a response to that to help low income people. I think you already know this though...
I think the only 4x4 (truck) stick shift you can buy right now is a Tacoma. At least in the states. Bummer. 
Doesn't seem to be true. I remember when I first got my license, getting a ~three year old car was the way to go. Now, unless it's a really mass produced, uninteresting car like a Ford focus, that three year old car is like 18k when the new one is maybe 24k. I'll just get the new one with the full warranty at that point.
I've been doing 'real work' for fifteen years, my body is already destroyed. I'd like to be able to stand upright when I'm 50. 
This report did not please me. It's just another reminder that employers, for the most part, don't want to pay good wages to their employees. I don't want the government to act when and where it doesn't need to, but it clearly does here. If raising the minimum wage to something reasonable (15/16) puts anyone out of business, then that business is a failure anyway.
That's just an application to metro vs rural. Major metro living costs more. It doesn't have anything to do with minimum wage.
Bottom thirty percent earn very near minimum. And no I was born in the 80s but I know Carter didn't fuck things to like Reagan did
Why wouldn't it be
Just gonna stick with your Trump ways and downvote without communicating? Take a look at Seattle: minimum wage of 15, even Subway isn't moving out of the city. These companies are just stashing their profits, they aren't struggling to pay their employees a decent wage
Product costs going up ten percent isn't worth the bottom 30% earners getting a 50% raise? I feel like you're hanging onto something without really believing in it at this point
That's a fallicy. Employee costs are a fraction of total business expense. If wages go up 50%, product costs may go up 10% (probably not even that much) and this will only happen at Walmart and McDonald's and such because they pay so many of their employees so little. There will not be tons of inflation.
Who's we? I don't appreciate it because as I said, if you add 2.9 to a shitty wage, it's still shitty. If minimum wage held to inflation it would be more than 20$/hr right now. You're praising a bandaid when organ replacement is needed.
I hope that's true
It's a number that isn't really telling a useful story, quite like unemployment. It's a factor, and it's positive, but 2.9% on 12$ isn't helpful unless it's year after year after year after year. And there are still lots of people earning less than 12.
I'm not sure what you're referencing
Airplanes. Flying. I've read how it works. I understand it. But I just don't fucking get it! 
How many of these new jobs pay a decent wage? Higher than 15, higher than 20?
Right, I've had medical bills on my credit report my entire adult life and my score is well into the green
Why his credit score?
Username checks out
Yup. Honestly if the pixel 2 was all screen I would've considered it, from what I read the pixels are really good. But Google didn't do anything interesting with it, and I've been interested in checking out iOS anyway. I think Android does some things better (notifications for one) but I'm doing fine with iOS
My last 3 phones were flagship androids. Switched to the X when it was released and other than some clear disadvantages in iOS design, it's a much better phone. Never lags, which my androids always did.
You say they would vote for Satan over a Democrat, yet there wasn't a decent Democrat to vote for instead of Donald. If it was ranked choice voting I would have put Donald 3, and Hillary 4, just because the DNC is awful and at least the GOP didn't actually push Donald. 

Wanna win? Provide a great candidate
Getting rid of jobs is WHY we're automating. Humans aren't meant to work at a damn insurance company. Automation leads to UBI
If you know about any STDs why are you at all concerned with number of partners?
But you have to live in Florida
That's certainly awful and inexcusable
And I hope I'd be able to exercise that same restraint. I'm just saying that America and it's soldiers did not experience the pain that Russia did, so it's impossible to empathize with them and difficult to understand what happened to their minds.
No, I'm not trying to convince anyone it was ok. You don't have to agree with it to understand it though.
I want to agree with you. I want to imagine I'd take the high ground all the way. But I also understand that all humans are capable of awful things. The Russians were just that, human. 

Just try to imagine a foreign invader coming into our country, unprovoked, relentlessly killing millions (possibly over ten million) people including innocent civilians and also totally destroying a bunch of our cities and small towns alike. How likely are you to 'stay cool' and take the moral high ground?
I mean, the Russians were hurt badly by Germany, it seems reasonable to be as hateful as they were when beating the Germans back after losing literally millions of people. Imagine if what happened to Russia happened to your (our?) Country and then try to think about how pissed off our grandfathers would have been. 
I've had a handful of 10-30 minute tonic clonic seizures over the last ten years. Just recently after my fifth, I've started having the other kinds... Pretty scary
He can't run again can he?
To be fair, he received more votes than any other governor has in Maine history. I'd certainly like a progressive in there, as long as he or she doesn't start talking about firearm restrictions. We don't have a problem, there's nothing to solve.
And here I am, a progressive who loves guns 
Your state may differ, but in mine and the two next to it, all that happens is a background check. Any firearm which I purchase does not get 'registered' to me. It's not even recorded that I bought the firearm. For example I could get the background check done when I go into the shop because I'm pretty sure I'm buying something, it comes back good, and I leave without buying anything. All the fed knows either way is that a licensed firearm dealer requested a background check on me.
Maine and NH are now constitutional carry
The percentage of GDP one I don't find useful for any individual. The other chart just shows federal income tax and SS. Not state, not FICA, not Medicare. Regardless we're right in the thick of things, some countries lower some higher, and literally all of those countries provide more to their tax payers
Other countries have a social safety net too, it's not about a bunch of lazy people dragging us down. It's mostly that such a high percentage of available jobs pay so little, so people need welfare even on top of their income. Employers who don't pay their employees enough so that they don't need government help should be penalized.
I'd rather get taxed at an effective 25% rather than 20%, and get healthcare and education
No, you can Google it easily. Irish tax rates, UK tax rates, Spanish tax rates, etc. 
The problem is we in America are taxed nearly as much as many European countries or even more in some cases, yet we get much less in return for our taxes. 
I earn less than 40k and my effective tax rate is just over 20%... You're forget FICA and Medicare and SS. Everyone pays those on top of Federal income and state income tax. 
Exactly. 
There's another kind of guy too. There's even another kind of woman. Non monogamy has been my solution, along with full transparency of course. 
This a VW thing in general or can they just not get rid of GTIs specifically?
New GTI for under 20k?? MSRP is like 7k more than that isn't it?
So you're the reason he isn't writing any more books...
You're out of your mind if you think Americans would have been any less ruthless if Germany or whoever else invaded us. 
Tell those same people the paint is wet and they have to touch it to be sure
So, sort of a conservative SJW...? Hmm that's a new one. I think the idea that it bothers you so much is exactly the point and why it's so effective for a friend to say that about your wife. A presidential candidate and eventually winner said that about everyone's wife, everyone's daughter, everyone's sister. So you'd physically assault a friend for passionately expressing to you how unacceptable sexual assault is. You should direct your anger toward people who would actually behave in such a way, not someone who is passionately against such behavior.
You'd slug a guy for making a snide point? That's a high level of insecurity, or you have a misconception of what a gentleman and a decent person is. If you're so put off by your buddy saying those words in a smartass tone, how could you possibly fully support a POTUS candidate who speaks the same way?
'news' channels
When there isn't a beer list
I think people want actual communism, which hasn't existed anywhere before. Also, there are probably many people like myself who don't want communism but feel strongly that our version of capitalism is not as good for the masses as it should be. My mind goes like this: Marx is totally right about the problems with 'capitalism' but how does he bridge to communism? 
Your sister doesn't like the artwork?
Excellent compliment.
The strongest? Compared to Anakin, obiwan, palpatine, etc? Or do you mean strongest in current time? 
Yes. It will. This planet doesn't need us. It doesn't fucking matter if we stop existing. Until we can exist in a responsible way, we should absolutely reduce (drastically) our reproduction
It goes back to freedom and liberty. I don't have to bake you a cake, but you can tell everyone why I said I won't, and my business might suffer. It's the market. It's real life. Nobody got hurt.
I already work 50 hours, you'd have to make it worth my time
I switched from GPM to apple music, mostly because GPM would never hold my spot on podcasts. They're both awful at creating stations based on a song I start with though. If I start with a top hit, why do you keep playing songs I've never heard?
I didn't know it was champagne, I thought it was tequila
I don't want to make anyone cake
I feel like kylo is a very strong force user, but the art of saber fighting is just not really around anymore? IDK, that seems to be  his weakness.
I'm definitely confused as to how powerful in the force kylo (and Rey) are, relative to other force users we know.
You pollute by breathing
Things that don't hurt you, like if someone doesn't want to make you a cake. 
So, stop creating more humans? Because that's the best thing you can do. 
The best thing you can do for climate change is to not have children
Funny... It was considered so awful for the Nazis to be awful to Jews, but blacks? Obviously scumbags that didn't deserve any respect. Wtf America 
The masses just don't care though... They don't understand that us as consumers have so much power in this economy. 
I will always do the silly sobriety test, because it means they see that I'm ok, and don't give me a breath test. I'm positive I've gotten away with being slightly over the limit, because I think police aren't looking for someone just barely over the limit. That's my experience anyway.
In my state I can refuse the test, but then I immediately lose my license because driving is a privilege not a right.
It depends what state you're in. Traffic violations aren't federal. 
My experience is much different. I've been asked to get out of my car more times than I can count. Never been arrested. How do they do sobriety tests if you're sitting in the car?
Fair enough. We've lived different lives.
If you get it at 20? And that's what you get for the rest of your life? Definitely not fuck you money. It's living well money, but that's it. 
You get a lawyer for a traffic violation?
I think we're on the same page
Fwiw I'm not hearing these things from the bosses. Anyway, I would genuinely like to work in a union someday so I can better understand it. I'm sure you're making valid points.
The only unions in my state that I'm aware of are teachers, police, and the shipyard. There are probably more but regardless most workers are not part of a union. You're probably correct about the things you mentioned, I'm mainly referring to the communication between the bosses and the workers. The union makes it so that they can't even have an open door and actually communicate properly. Simple things need to be done and the white hats aren't allowed to bring everyone together to solve an issue because well this guy can only do this one thing and that lady doesn't have anything to do with that thing... 
I personally just don't like the official Reddit app. Came from redditisfun on Android (no native Reddit app) then got an iPhone and didn't like official Reddit so I tried Apollo and liked it well enough.
Either you're misconstruing what I'm saying or I'm not communicating my point well. I'll look back at this later
It's not bizarre to want more than accusations. Based on how many accusers, and the general ideology of that Alabama guy, I lean heavily toward believing the accusers. But that's not the point... I'm not going to call someone a child rapist because of accusations only, that's just not the world I want to live in. 
Well, unions seem to create an awful work environment. The ridiculous relationship between the bosses and the grunts is annoying AF. 

I'm not in a union, but I know people who work in one at a shipyard. Yeah I want their paychecks but their work environment is ridiculous and counter productive often times. 
I think that's all Democrats would have to do in some states: make sure voters know they won't lose their guns. 
I certainly don't support that guy who lost in Alabama, but has he actually been prosecuted? How would you react if a good friend of yours was accused of child rape but never convicted of it? Are you ok with accusations being enough to ruin someone's life?
Unfortunately people think that because something is not extreme right, it's by default good stuff. Fox news is definitely a joke, a propaganda channel. I wouldn't put CNN in that category, but it's very clear where their bias is.
Nobody is forcing your hand at the voting booth. Do your research, choose the best candidate. There were 3 better options than Trump in 2016, I didn't need bill Maher to tell me that.
A comedian and...
An onion Knight would like to agree with you
Look we have different ideologies and that's ok, but a wall is not something I want my taxes paying for. Take some of that 600 billion a year military and guard the border. 
It's for rich people and foolish poor people
The wall should be on the northern border then. We have more illegal Canadians in this country than we have illegal Mexicans.
Seems like you could be getting high while doing that job and be ok...
Seems to matter which state you're in, too.
Interesting, thanks for the response
I really like that thought process.
It's already borderline feudalism here. I wonder what's next. I for one refuse to create any humans while every child isn't given the same chance at success.
My thoughts exactly
Do you know which jobs?
I would hope those employers are also testing for alcohol and an assortment of prescription drugs.
Different strokes for different states, apparently. 
I think different states have different laws. My state (Maine) isn't known for drug tests. I'm pretty sure the healthcare industry does upon hiring but then never again. Our unemployment rate would surge.
Thanks for being reasonable
That's correct
I work for a large corporation, never been tested
Yeah I think my state would have at least 25% unemployment if we all got tested for marijuana.
Pretty sure it's my state (Maine). I have coworkers who got tested, but only if they live in NH/MA. I work in 'retail' fwiw it's a unique job though with a lot of traveling.
But trade jobs often have raging alcoholics working in them. Looking at you, floor guys and painters. 
Feels good knowing our government prioritizes keeping marijuana illegal over our national security. And just when I thought he had given up, Trump literally just demanded the wall again. I'm so proud of this country I live in.
I'm definitely starting to think they don't test for weed
So, can swedes and Norwegians communicate at least somewhat using their native languages? And Danes are forced to use a third language? 
If employers want employees, they should probably just not test for marijuana, if they test at all. I'm in my 30s, always had a job and I've never been tested for anything...
Does all Danish sound like a drunk, no, hammered, English speaker?
No worries, isn't the first one that went over my head and won't be the last
Do they have easier jobs than others in the industry?
I'm not sure what you're referencing, care to educate me?
How high do they want to go? There's a certain company which essentially owns the internet which is happy to pay six figures to people with no degree.
A back road is a road with next to nothing on it, usually consisting of no shoulders and probably not maintained well. You described something else. Back roads don't have lots of traffic lights and businesses and such.
Have not seen it, and it does not look interesting. I'll keep on waiting for the next season of Rick and Morty
But we aren't a meritocracy. It would be great if we were, but we aren't.
Maine. Vermont is 2 and NH is 3. Hooray northern New England! /s
Seems to me those racist folks would just move to a place with small numbers of the people they don't like. *Waves from the least diverse state in the country

Also, racist fuck faces are not welcome here, we already have too many.
For real. I can't believe our taxes pay for the fire department and schools and snow plows! Let the market decide if we need a fire department! Lol
I'm guessing you have crippling student debt? I fortunately have none, but also don't have a degree. I work retail and make ~40k a year. I decided I don't want to do that anymore so I'm selling my house and going to live cheap for awhile and retrain in programming/web design for a year or whatever it takes. Luckily I can live with a buddy for less than what it would cost me to get an apartment. Everyone's situation is different, and maybe you don't have the same 'opportunities' I have going forward. 

I'm certainly not trying to criticize you, but it seems like you've gotta try to find a cheap place to live even if it's not your preferred option. Then find a way to save a few grand (again, maybe there just literally isn't a way for you to do this) and move to a place where your degree can serve you. Fwiw, I just think people are out of their minds if they think it's unreasonable to have to relocate for work. It's just the way it is.

My bank account will continue to be grim until I'm free of my mortgage and all that comes with it, but that's my solution; I hope you find yours internet friend.
But, moving for employment opportunities is just the way it is. It's nothing bad. Moving costs money but you just have to make it work
You're taking it to an extreme, but yes. Specific positions or industries don't just magically exist wherever you exist. 
It won't be a problem. Apple is going to use the money they save from the tax cut to buy Disney
And here I can't find a damn plow guy
You can be (nearly) sure that no animals or insects in this kind of climate are trying to kill humans though. 
But, some people recover, so in that sense we should all hope for cancer so that maybe we can end up with a good life after all!
You're saying that to someone who isn't in favor of outright socialism. Just a couple more socialized programs than we currently have that's all
Has it been tried in a non authoritarian country? In a republic at least, where the citizens have some say?
You ought to read into it more. I'm not arguing for socialism, but it was literally just poor government oversight and relying on one export (oil). Socialism, or communism for that matter has never really been tried responsibly though. I don't want to get rid of capitalism, but we're not doing it right.
Venezuela seems to going through a rough patch, maybe you're out of the loop? There's plenty of info available if you just Google Venezuela collapse or something like that. 
Well, I'm not sure I'm on the left, but that's probably irrelevant. We owe lots of money to other countries right? How do we repay that if growth stops? If we default, our currency will be devalued. Bad things would happen.
When you put it that way, makes me wanna hightail it out of here
That's how I feel about it, generally
No. Our economic system requires measurable economic growth every year. If that doesn't happen, bad things happen.
That right there: our economy requires neverending growth just to continue working. That's enough to tell me that it's the wrong system
Yeah my personality is lacking, for sure
I'm pretty sure most charities have at least a 70% overhead cost. And, if there was a way to profit, wouldn't private Enterprise already have done it? There's Amtrak but they are very limited
Meh, to each their own. 
Hell no. Unless it's another gorgeous person I'm helping
I'm just sick of having to drive everywhere. When I traveled to Europe once, I could just take a train anywhere I wanted. Renting a car would've cost me hundreds or more for the trip, all my train rides were less than 100 all said. Don't have to worry about parking, can sleep if I'm tired, can be intoxicated. Can maybe talk to strangers. 
I'm gorgeous, I still have to work 50 hours a week 
Just take another percent of my pay and put rapid transit everywhere. I'd love to not need a car. Wait, that's probably why we don't have transit. 
There is no public transport in the vast majority of America. I hear Europe has trains everywhere though. *Jealous*
Essentially, yep. It would be a huge accomplishment for our species of women didn't have to go through childbirth
So, would you say the chocolate is... Baked?
Hmm tell me more...
It would probably cost a week's pay for someone in murica 
How much will that cost though? 
We should find a way to grow humans outside of another body, so that they can grow another few months before being 'born'
Corporate protects the higher ups, and is just there to make sure the little guys get fired legally if they complain too much. 
But it's good for the shareholders!
Hey come on, we weren't involved in any wars before the 18th century... Right?
Animated or live action?
We don't know what they could incorporate into the han movie. Maybe there will be other more interesting characters with substance which really adds to the series
Apparently the only listener without a  degree. I listen in the car or at work while wearing headphones so I can ignore my coworkers.
It's actually midichlorians
My happiest place is drinking whisky in front of a peat fire in a pub in Ireland on a chilly night. I'm an envious American, wondering how you folks figured out life, and baffled as to why so many of you move here.
Much of the world still can't handle gay people or pot smokers, so yeah, we definitely can't handle aliens
Fair enough 😊
I think it's just a trade-off. With osx/iOS you get fewer choices for customization but more stability and quicker run times with most things. 
Is that not possible on iOS? I stream and don't really care t that sounds silly
Wait till you find out double Ds aren't twice the size of Ds
I will say I don't like how I can't put all the icons in the bottom/right with my iPhone. I suppose I could accomplish this but putting apps I just don't use as space fillers though
Lifelong Android user (10 years), last three androids were flagships. Went with the iPhone ecks this time, and while Android does a few things considerably better: notifications, ability to actually ignore phone calls, and notifications, this phone is so smooth. There is hardly ever any lag, updates come immediately, and IDK I should start writing things down. 

Also, the battery on this phone is 1000 mAh less than my last phone and is at least as good. 
This is what I try telling people. By voting for Hillary, they said we accept your candidate and she's good enough. You have to show them with your vote that they need to put forth a better candidate
We should have internships instead of college, at least for many jobs. It could work really well
Is bullying usually effective for you? Can you explain to me how Gary and Jill are more off their rocker than Donald and Hillary? 

Gary was on every ballot, Jill was on most of them. They weren't write ins. When you vote for someone, you're telling the party they represent that you approve of that candidate. We have a two party system because that's how most Americans vote. That's the only reason. YOU'RE not changing anything by voting for awful candidates who barely represent you and me better than the current clown in the white House. 
Then you seem to be missing my point. I'm not going to let you make me feel guilty for not voting for Democrats because 'they try' 

I'll either vote third party, or I'll vote for the Challenger and not the incumbent until Democrats stop trying to be conservative. 
Reddit doesn't seem happy that I don't fit into either of our two parties...
I'm always going to vote for the candidate who I think wants the best for the most. Not the candidate who wants to meet the most halfway. 

If a candidate says they want to expand ACA but doesn't support single payer, that candidate is certainly losing all conservative voters, and is probably losing some progressive voters. The Dems need to commit, instead of trying to appeal to Trump supporters. 
Assuming I am, would you tell me what the point is? 
Remarkably high quality for 1989, it seems
Pull your socks up!
I travel too often for work, I literally am unable to participate in local happenings. There's nothing unreasonable about expecting this kind of thing to be on the internet. 
To each their own. I thought there was a better candidate on the ballot and I voted for him. If Jill was on all 50 ballots, I might've voted for her. 

To me, Hillary was just another example of the Democrats putting up another candidate who would be considered conservative in most other countries. I don't want the ACA to be expanded, I want single payer. I don't want slightly more affordable education, I want taxpayer funded education. I'm libertarian until Democrats actually become progressive.
My city (population less than 20000) had a mayoral election a couple months ago. I literally could not find a website with the candidates. What the hell am I supposed to do show up at the booth and vote for who has the coolest name?
Still have to remember things like: Obama couldn't get single payer through because of Democrats, not because of Republicans
I hate Trump and didn't vote for him, but it sounds like you think Hillary was NOT a shitty option. In the way that you can't stand people saying their vote doesn't matter, I can't stand being told to vote for the lesser evil/the one I hate a little less. 

On the other hand maybe I'm misunderstanding you. This comment is not an attack on your comment.
Hmm just like Hillary...
Hey, I'd vote no on it. They should've just lowered the corporate tax rate and call it good
I heard on a podcast or npr that the graduate student deduction is staying in. As are some of the others which people are up in arms about. 

Regardless, it seems like only a small portion of tax payers will be adversely affected by this bill. If it is beneficial to most, then it's good. Nothing Congress passes is beneficial to literally everyone. I'm staying as informed as i can about this, but I'm just not hearing what's so bad about it... It's doubling my deduction and lowering my rate, and I'm in a very similar situation to many other taxpayers in that I don't make 6 figures and I don't itemize. How is this hurting most Americans? The debt obviously doesn't even matter anymore
NOW we know why Glorious leader Kim doesn’t poop!
And all that is why I would like to just see the deductions removed. Make our taxes simple and transparent. Itemizing shouldn’t even be an option. 
There’s nothing for me to get over, I’m not trying to win anything. Thanks for keeping things mostly civil lol.

I’m mostly bummed about this bill because i thought the original point was to simplify taxes, and they didn’t do that. The list of deductions and credits should be minimal. Have a progressive income tax and figure out what you need and stop making tax time such a burden. The government already knows what I need to pay in or what refund I’ll be getting. 
5 meter? Rey isn’t even 2 meters tall lol
As far as Rey considering joining kylo, I think she was if he would step away from the dark side. Meet her halfway even. But when he made it clear he’s not going toward the light, she wasn’t interested in teaming up. Just my interpretation 
Anyone I know who has gone to Atlanta, only had bad things to say. What are your thoughts?
I deal with the same shit. I’m definitely not a conservative, but I own and enjoy firearms. I’m certainly supportive of mandatory background checks though. 
My point is, just get out of major metros (LA, SF, BOS, NY, etc). Find a smaller city with plenty of people and plenty to do and you can find a decent house for under 250k in most places. If you desire to have millions of people around you, then yeah you’re probably gonna pay for it.
NPR has mentioned plenty of times that the majority of Americans just file a 1040 and use the standard deduction. Also, the majority of Americans are absolutely not going to know all the ins and outs of the bill. Not now and not later. 

So my point stands, and applies to many people. We want to know what our percentage is for which bracket we are in and what the standard deduction is. It seems you’re interested in ignoring the concerns of the masses, but you are certainly more knowledgeable on the subject and I may be just misunderstanding you. In the future though, instead of assuming what I’m trying to do, maybe ask me?
Small cities which aren’t commutable to a major city are usually a good balance. Think population under 100k, a couple colleges, a decent enough bar/restaurant scene. You don’t have to live in a metro of a million or more to have the same things to do. 
A technical majority of the population, yes. But most of the land is rural. 
I’m pretty sure most low income earners like myself are not itemizing. All that matters to many Americans is what the standard deduction is, and what the tax brackets are.
I’m not an extremist about it as you suggest. But I do research and advocate for myself and suggest you do the same. I got tired of spending hundreds of dollars and getting no results. You have to go prepared. 

So no, I’m not one of those people. But I’m not a person who has blind trust in someone because they have a higher education level than I do. 
Many argue that government subsidized education is a main contributor to the massive increase in its cost.
Probably not incapable of comprehending, but plenty of people get misdiagnosed or not diagnosed in those 8 minutes. So there’s that.
You’re making valid points, but I’m not going to rely on a person with 8 minutes to figure out an issue. 
Doctors only see patients for 8 minutes... you bet your ass I’m going to be my own advocate and research my symptoms if I’m going to pay hundreds of dollars for 8 minutes of service 
This doesn’t affect low income earners does it? If you deduct state income tax you can’t take the standard deduction can you? I make almost 40k and I’m better off with the standard deduction...
Self diagnosis is bullshit? Well, medical professionals are awful at it, who should diagnose?
Are those radiators the most common form of heating in Europe? 
Raise taxes on who? I don’t support this bill but I’ve looked at the brackets, it doesn’t raise taxes for anyone...
Interesting. Every, and I mean every, current or former service member I’ve met has plenty of stories about how much they wasted. 
Get out of major metros. In most places in the states you can find a one bedroom for less than a grand.
Most of America, as far as I’m aware. Major metros only make up a small portion of our land.
If they dragged on the luke training rey part, it would’ve gotten corny and cliche too easily. The movie left it up to the audience to make assumptions with that. 

Just my thought on it
Those minivans must be really sweet. Honda’s oddysey costs more than its ridgeline! 
No, not even close to the same thing. I support net neutrality, but it’s definitely heavy handed regulation by government. 1st amendment is basically the opposite: government hands completely off.
I didn’t suggest burning anything down, but The ACA screws over people like me who make less than 15/hr but can’t get subsidized insurance. Our government needs to stop incentivizing shitty paying employers to continue keeping pay low because, well hey the government will help you
Totally agree. Don’t subsidize anything until it’s effective and cost efficient 
All a democrat has to do is support firearm liberties. In some states all they care about is abortion, here I’m pretty sure it’s our guns. 
Here in Maine, if we voted for a democrat, our governor would just yell at us and tell us we got it all wrong and send the losing candidate to DC anyway. 
The ACA is a bandaid and isn’t helping anyone who has an employer who offers health insurance that’s so shitty it isn’t worth having. 

Here you go: pay every month for this thing which won’t do anything for you until you pay another 2k$, so you’re incredibly disincentivized to seek medical care.

Our healthcare system itself is broken. The only thing it does well is trauma, and it does that at an astronomically high cost. I don’t want one more dollar of my taxes going to this broken system. 
Our actual president blatantly lies regularly. There are no rules here, except that the richest and most corrupt win at life. 
It’s apparently unconstitutional. There were several citizens initiatives on the 2016 ballot in my state (ME) and the governor disagreed with how the citizens voted on all of them, so he has done his best to block all of them. 

Citizens initiatives are literally the only democratic aspect left. Everything else is just electing someone else to make decisions on donors behalf. Our governor made it very clear that democracy does not exist. Fuck this state and fuck this country.
You say that but in my voting years, there is usually just one challenger, if that. 
I’d prefer ranked voting, but what makes so many people think: well if they don’t have a D or R by their name, they are worthless...?
Irish swans are chill AF. Parents let their toddlers hang with them.
Yes, but what if everyone just voted for the candidate they like most? Country before party? 
Hello there fellow Tim. That explanation is logical but also flawed imo. They aren’t viable because people don’t think they are? So, because of ignorance then. Statistically, Gary Johnson had the same chance of winning as trump or Clinton. You just check a box like the others. How is it not viable?
What needs to change about the voting method? Gary Johnson was on literally every ballot, Jill stein was on something like 44 state ballots. 
It’s not getting the DEMS out so much, I don’t think. I think there is a significant number of people who are like me in that: I line up better with dems than I do GOP, but I still don’t line up with them all that well. 

So it’s usually like this: I really don’t like that republican candidate, but I’m not too excited about this democrat either. We need two more parties IMO. Having a libertarian and a green made me quite happy this last general election. I just want to see those 4 options for Congress candidates as well.
I’ll keep those locations in mind if I visit Alabama 😊
He’s a republican trying to get democrats to show up late to the polls. 
Look at it this way: any margin of victory for a democrat in Alabama IS a huge margin. 

Top headline in Alabama news: bleeding heart liberal sinners elect baby killer to US senate. 

-probably 
I don’t think that’s sad at all. Or maybe I’m a sad person. I’ll never vote for someone who’s policies I think are bad for the country. Even if trump was a decent human being, I wouldn’t have voted for him. 
Well, ‘they’ booted Franken from Congress for some grabass accusations. And ‘they’ like his policies. So I think it holds true that an accused pedophile would be booted by ‘them’ too. 
How’s St. Petersburg this time of year?

Well, as long as government is logically consistent, I guess 😒
So it cancels out, yeah?
I’m also ok with that, I’m not gonna do the leg work but I remember recently New Hampshire making it law that minors can’t have sex, period. Maybe it was proposed and not passed, idk
I don’t like the guy or his policies, but think of the people who do like his policies. The only other candidate is a guy who doesn’t line up with their views (politically). Even if trump was a great guy, with no skeletons in his closet, I wouldn’t vote for him because his policies don’t line up with mine.
Insane how some states (most states?) make it illegal for two underage people to have sex. I mean, wtf is the crime??
Misunderstood. My point is Democrats don’t seem to ‘fire back’
A democrat with balls?! I... I... I don’t understand 

Edit: I must have chosen the wrong words. I’m referring to the trend that democrats never seem to fight fire with fire, and I’m happy this guy is doing so. So here’s this thing I forgot /s
Gotcha. Thanks
How have you seen it already? Family member/friend in the business?
Who would have seen it already?
It’s as if the accusers don’t realize republicans control Congress...
Shitty team, shitty weather, nyc cancels out all your votes... what’s the appeal? 
I would show you, but I’m running for president 
There are probably many voters who don’t know anything about him. Like they don’t browse reddit, don’t have cable tv, and don’t listen to npr. So they’re just going to vote for the (R)
I read it in joe Pesci’s (from goodfellas) voice
I’m not saying that’s what minimum wage is(however it will be 10/hr Jan 1st and then 11 the next year and 12 the next year) but I mean a fast food supervisor or retail supervisor makes 12/hr or so. Minimum is 9 right now. Fast food joints are still popping up everywhere, contrary to Republicans saying a modest increase in minimum wage will destroy businesses. 
Silly things happen when most people can’t find a job paying more than 12/hr
Well here in America we’re just as fucked because nobody can afford that and our government is also not covering the bill. Just because we have ‘access’ to something doesn’t mean we actually get it.
53 million votes means 53 million volunteers for war, right?
Yup. I was quite attracted to a woman I occasionally work with, until I saw her out at a pub with the 80s jeans (70s jeans?). Obviously I still think she’s pretty but that style just doesn’t work for me.

Come on get a little deeper, ‘how is it that dooku easily bested obi wan, and anakin easily bested dooku, but obi wan bested anakin?
So just stop giving that money to the government? Seems like the solution to me
Our taxes mostly pay for retired people. There are many retired folks who aren’t exactly sitting pretty. What’s your solution?
I’ll try that, thanks!

And I’m glad you challenged my thoughts on the subject with actual substance. Thanks.

It seems to me that the solution here is simple: for a person to be a person there must be a name behind it. A name with a SSN. A citizen. Congress should make this so. Your thoughts?
My point is Kennedy, as is often the case, was the deciding vote (decision?). Kennedy is extreme when it comes to free speech and censorship. He understands the rabbit hole you start digging when you start to suppress anything at all. The US government stood in front of him and said ‘we would ban a book under the proper circumstances’. That was the end of the case right there. Kennedy refused to allow censorship by the government. That’s the case in a nutshell and so many people make it more complicated than that. The Supreme Court made the right decision, to uphold the constitution. If we need to rewrite that constitution then we should, but I’m the meantime the court is literally there to uphold the one that is in place.
I don’t think corporations are people. But, the government (plaintiff) literally went before the Supreme Court and said that the government would be willing to ban a book under the right circumstances. You wanna lose your case in the Supreme Court? You tell Justice Kennedy you want to suppress free speech. 
Agreed
Just put in some effort, and you and all the rest of us can be senators too! 
You should research it more I think. The justices simply followed the constitution and freedom of speech. I agree that the result is no good, but the court, IMO, made the correct ruling on the case presented to them. There is a fantastic podcast called ‘more perfect’ with an episode on this.
Well if everyone would just put the effort in we could all be senators! 
This aspect specifically, the corporate tax breaks... why is it bad? Ireland has incredibly low corporate rates, and benefits because of it. Why wouldn’t the US?

There are too many people here who think that their ignorance is worth the same as someone else’s knowledge. That’s what it all boils down to

Is there another republican running? People aren’t just going to vote for someone with an entirely different ideology because of a character issue. I would just not vote at all, instead of voting for someone I don’t line up with politically. 
Yup. RoTS is probably my favorite. It’s the film that makes you understand anakins dilemma. 
Which is why it doesn’t make sense that obi wan beat him. Obi wan couldn’t hold a candle to dooku, and a anakin beat dooku easily. And what about windu? Was he more powerful than all of them?
May as well have actual soldiers I suppose... lol 
Idk looks like you are about to get invaded by Russia 
So In your idea of capitalism , who has social responsibility? 
Fair enough 
So index funds don’t need people losing on other stocks for the index fund to be successful?
Yeah if anyone actually cares enough. They do get fired occasionally, but most of us prefer the sleeping guards because then they don’t bother us.

Basically, nobody actually wants them to do their job, but corporate puts them there anyway 
If everyone only invests in index funds, do they still work?
Why don’t you folks just clean your own offices? I mean a quarterly deep clean from a contractor seems reasonable but...
My job requires a 3rd party security guard most of the time; 8 out of 10 do not do a damn thing. At least 2 out of 10 literally sleep. 
Care to elaborate?
Vader an ‘average’ force user?
Seems like questions for a separate thread
This contradicts sidious telling yoda that Vader will become more powerful than either of them. Maybe when sidious saw Vader defeated after fighting obi wan, he gave up that hope?
Can’t put tone, but so you know I’m not being a dick.

I don’t think you can just change what liberalism actually is. A rose by any other name is still a rose, ya know? 
Sounds like liberal ideology to me. Actual liberal, not what current Democrats have twisted the word into. Individual freedoms and small government and owning firearms... all falls under liberalism 
Lend me some sugar
Well someone isn’t paying attention 
I mean, we all had three choices and most of us had 4 choices. 3 of them were better options than Donald 
Isn’t it better if the workers own production as a collective? Or is that what you mean?
Hmm, I don’t expect most landlords are paying a mortgage on the units they are renting out.
Fair enough 
True enough, but (and I know this is RADICAL thinking) you could share an apartment for 5 or 6 years and save up nearly that amount if you have a decent paying job, and then buy a house outright in a place where a nice house costs less than 200k. The job there might pay 40 instead of 75k, but it’s wonderful when you don’t pay rent/mortgage
But you live in a bubble. An incredibly unique market. 
So many of our jobs don’t require any education and therefore pay absolute shit. Interestingly enough, there are plenty of jobs requiring a degree which still pay shit. 
Keep in mind that in the vast majority of this country (US) 190000 will definitely buy you a move in ready house. 
You get engine breaking (not technically like with a rig). With an automatic the car always wants to go forward, with a manual you can stay in a lower gear so you get deceleration without using the brakes. It’s just an extra element of control. 
In snow, throttle is usually the best advice. If you happen to have 4wd, that only works when you’re accelerating. Of course, stick shifts are the cherry on top. 
They all running summer rubber or what?
I for one am looking forward to the iPhone X-4. Over.
Well I mean the battery can’t be more than 20 or 30 dollars, so that leaves 50 to 60 for what can’t take more than 20 minutes 
Yikes, definitely pricy for a battery but I’m guessing it’s mostly labor
I’m two weeks in and I’m not bothered by the notch at all.
I’m with you there. Although I did really like my galaxy s5 for the first year or so. I’m hoping the X is something I can use (and be happy with) for more than 2 years. 

Any idea how much it costs to have apple replace the battery? That certainly wouldn’t be still good after 2 years 
I came from a flagship Motorola, am very impressed with the X. 
I’m able to do that, yes. It’s not literally instant but I wouldn’t call it lag
I’d be more interested in that than a Han Solo movie... 
Great, we’re the whitest state and also the greenest. Any other color titles we can have? 😒
So, just as relevant?
Meh, there goes the dems potus candidate for 2020
No worries I miss much of it too. I just start seeing a certain thing mentioned across many subreddits and sometimes look into it 
The bit about Finland was just reddit meta. There was a big to do for a few weeks about Finland not being a real country. Thanks for the tip on the Baltics though!
😂😂😂
American here: the only country I can just never seem to recognize is Finland... can’t for the life of me remember why
Gotcha. Thanks for the reply
I feel really good about myself now
Just curious: what is middle America? 
Soooo where is it?
Right, but I’ve always had flagship androids and they always lagged. A flagship phone should still be working fine after a couple years regardless. 
So the current iPhone X will be the smallest option? Seems like they should update the SE
Went from a droid turbo 2 to iPhone X. Unbelievable how much faster the iPhone is. No lag. 
Men don't have vaginas so two men cannot engage in sex the same way as a man and a woman. So according to the Bible it's cool until men have vaginas 
Hmm I hate to be that guy, but do you have any sources on that?
Okay I just don't have that level of hate in me, honestly 
You're asking a bit much there, pal
I'll vote for who I like best. I don't give a damn what party they are. 
I live in this state we call Maine... There are plenty of hateful bigots here who are still happy with the orange man. Peace and love exists, but the hate is very present as well. 
As an American, I find this awesome. How can I become British? 
They interviewed each and every person he has ever crossed paths with in his life; turns out he's the only director left who hasn't sexually harassed or assaulted anyone.

Too soon?
The final movie in the saga will start with 'just a few minutes ago, on a city block not far away'
Hmm that's counter to what I personally observe and experience as an Android user. I see people with older iPhones every day, which still seem to work well. Every Android I have is operating so slowly by the time I get to the two year mark, I feel like I don't even have a choice but to upgrade. 
From someone who just ordered my first iPhone, this still makes me so happy. Three years after Android 8 is released, 52% of Androids will still be behind.
Aramco will have their IPO just in time to beat Apple to a trillion lol
Where in Canada is this?
As long as you don't mind sitting next to a wall or in a car... 
Don't forget there are charging cases available
Seems like it comes down to this: nations are so desperate to keep these companies within their borders that they really won't punish them enough to leave when they do things like this.
This is what I wish would happen... Literally no exemptions. None. Reduce the tax rates, but make everyone pay them. 
But then they'd have to charge TWO thousand dollars for an iPhone, just to stay afloat. 
You don't understand, when they get to keep all their money, they share it with the rest of us. Haven't you been paying attention?
Interesting thought process there...
There's no collateral involved. It's super high risk. You can default and the bank doesn't get paid and can't repo anything. 
So you don't go to college. Easy. The government is not forcing you to do so. 
Russia: America done right
I know plenty of Americans with that same life policy
Don't forget the entire history of Russia can be summed up with: 'and then things got worse'

Their citizens can handle literally anything, at least I figure. Russians are probably as worried about their economy as Canadians are worried about their geese being jerks.
No, the cold war is still ongoing
I'm a straight white male, I have nothing to be worried about. 
I don't think there's that much diversity in my entire state

What year? I also owned one and did my own oil changes no problem
Droid turbo 2. My Galaxy S5 before this wasn't quite as bad, but I wanted the 'stock' Android experience. I've always had Androids but just ordered the iPhone x. I've always been jealous about how quickly and smoothly iPhones run. Guess I'll finally get to see if the grass is greener.
Hey, just like my Android
There are so few Apple stores anywhere though. Very inconvenient. 
Aahh pensions... Something us millennials will likely never see
Wait, I thought they weren't actually government employees??? If they are, why does the USPS talk about profits issues?
Rude!
Thanks for the input and response. I've visited Montreal a few times and always loved it. I live about a 5 hour drive away. 
I make about 35k fwiw
I lose about 30% of my pay. You? Also, what's a decent apartment cost and what's it cost to buy something like a townhouse?
Right, so you keep the charger turned on until it's dead. Then you end up with (just throwing out a number) 10 hours with your phone at 100%, then you just have your regular phone battery
What does a full time, non 'skilled' worker earn? And what is a typical rent for a 2 bedroom apt that's not too far from a city?
I want to live in your city 
#youtoo
So, that tax rate isn't any worse than here (US). I see this too often, Europeans saying they pay high taxes, but it doesn't seem like you actually do compared to here. I make roughly double that gross amount you mention, but I lose about 30%of my pay to taxes. Federal income tax, plus state income tax, plus social security tax (which is just another federal tax), plus Medicare tax (which is just another federal tax). 

You don't pay any more in taxes than Americans do (possibly less, actually) and you get much more for it.
No, that's the shitty part. You don't pass out because your body knows it's not life threatening. That's my guess anyway. My tibia snapped in half, It was the most pain I've ever experienced. I did not pass out.
The only rules that are seemingly enforced here are: don't drive too fast, and don't drive drunk. People can drive as shitty and careless as they want, unfortunately. 
Have you never had a Reuben?
Well said
Well, nobody knows how an economy works. If they did, well, wouldn't it work?
Index funds won't work though if EVERYONE invests in them... There have to be losers too

Just downloaded civ 5, on a brand new notebook. Haven't played PC games in years. Nothing has changed though, program still closes randomly. This is why I prefer console lol
What do they do with the rest of it?
Most of America. Leave the West coast/major cities. 
Um. Yeah. For sure. 
I still encounter other Americans regularly that are unabashedly Trump lovers. Outright chauvinist racists who don't accept reality. They think America is the only country worth anything, even with our awful, hateful, embarrassing history. Nationalism is dangerously high among tens of millions of people here. I honestly don't know how to fix it. You'll say vote for someone else, and I do. But often there isn't a reasonable candidate to vote for. It'll be the incumbent, and then some radical, stupid extremist on either end of the spectrum. As soon as I can make myself acceptable for legal status in a European country, I'm moving.
Why are all the responses to top comments gone?
Maine (my home) doesn't get much attention politically, but our senators aren't whores to their parties. We're a very divided state, which probably dictates that our reps better straddle the line. 
Is that a moto issue in general? My Droid turbo 2 has been super slow for months.

Yeah, I'm sure there are legit reasons. I travel regularly for work and I don't need more than my 32 gigs 🙂
What do you use all that space for? Do you just not like cloud storage? Not shitting on you, just curious.
A phone is so much more useful. 1000$ for something I use all day, every day doesn't seem strange to me at all. 
Why is qhd needed on something so small? I don't even want qhd on my laptop, it just Burns more battery and my eyes don't even see the difference.
Not a matter of how long it'll take just a matter of how many batteries you would need. I get a solid 45 minutes out of mine which is plenty for my small lawn. Going battery might not be cost effective for 3 acres, but holy hell I love not worrying about gas and oil.
Get a battery operated mower. I love mine. 
What good is a programmer who doesn't understand HTML? And CSS of course... 
Looks like a minimum wage biweekly paycheck
It's not very bright. You literally can't see anything but the sun. 
And look at Android lagging behind by two generations... Get yer act together googs!
It's worth mentioning the other 300,000 years, considering humans haven't been a thing for that long. 
That is a fantastic non answer, that I do not have the insult to.
You are totally wrong. More goes to social services like Medicare and SS than go to defense. Entitlements (social services) cost more than anything else. Defense is definitely very high though.
In some places, not all or even most.  

Edit: in America, anyway
Someone embracing capitalism
Fewer
What? I'll Google it after I say this, but I'm nearly positive a wolf is significantly smaller than the largest dog breeds. 

Edit: I am correct, the largest wolf CAN get to 170lbs (this would be the weight of a fairly small male Irish wolfhound). But even the larger grey wolf is likely to be significantly less than that.
When a restaurant asks: pink or no pink when I order a burger... Well, I won't be coming back. My answer is red. Fucking red.

That's called renewable energy, amirite?
I agree with all of what you said.
Fair enough

I wish the term liberal wasn't applied the way it is, doesn't seem accurate. The people labeled as liberals tend to be far from what a liberal ideology is supposed to be.

Anywho, I don't know that I feel as strongly as you do about her, but I'm leaning in that direction and agree with you about all you said. 

I'm not sure who's going to rule, but the council should consider of davos, Tyrion, missandei, Sansa, and varys.
Well I mean, cersei's children weren't legitimate either. But I see your point.
Now that I think of it, American psycho is a great comparison for that look he had on his face. 
How does gendry have claim? Doesn't someone need to legitimize him? 
Either little finger has been playing the long game, or he's out of his league with all the Starks working together. This episode made it clear that the vale is serving Sansa now, at least by my understanding. What play does little finger even have at this point?
I honestly thought it was Christian Bale at first. Was slightly confused.
I didn't catch anything about that either
Why didn't dany offer to free the lanisters? She seems to be becoming a mad queen, herself. This bend the knee or die thing doesn't seem like a great thing to do. What makes her a good candidate for the throne, at actually ruling I mean?

Maine would like to have a chat with you, if you wouldn't be too bothered of course.
Mainiac here: thanks for the recognition. And yes, I've been wondering for years why Maine isn't part of Canada. We're literally surrounded by our friends to the North (and East, and Southeast). 
Ok, why aren't things getting better for me then?
I did, and likely will unless someone comes along who offers to fix our shitty capitalist system. Basically libertarian or socialist for me. 
Enough with telling me that voting for the candidate which most aligns with my views and was on every voters ballot is a protest vote. 
I said a wicked deep thing tho

Fair enough. Fwiw, famous philosophers and others as well tend to consider capitalism sort of a transition phase: it just can't work for long because it inherently creates extreme economic inequality. 

It doesn't have to transition into socialism, deregulation is certainly an option. But whether we're ruled by Democrats or Republicans, more regulation is universal these days. 
I travel regularly, and sometimes just don't realize that the line 2 miles away from the offramp is actually the line for the offramp I want. So, since I just don't know, sometimes I'm that guy but it's unintentional I swear. If I know, I get in line.
She has some valid points (but so doesn't Paul Ryan, I'm guessing) but she is an extremist. I personally don't care which end of the spectrum you are on, extremism is bad news.
Genuinely curious: what did late stage capitalism make you think of?
What happens to my mortgage I have through them?
Sign me up, how do I start?

It's like you folks don't know France is nearly socialist... And it works pretty well. 
Thanks
Awesome, thanks
Makes sense
I got them at best but two years ago for the same price. Definitely worth it. Battery life is fantastic
There is no federal sales tax. Each state decides. A select few don't have sales tax.
I would equate it to toilet paper... Why do we have to pay for toilet paper?
Ten rounds for 38$ online... 
.50 Cal? Last I knew it was about 2.50 per round for civilians. 
Ook! 
I'm positive any other primate could outrun me
Why would we use a 2$ bullet when we can use a 10k$ drone or bomb? You clearly don't understand murica
You overestimate the intelligence of Americans. If we had proper brains, we wouldn't have voted for Hillary or Donald
Life pro tip: get boneless thighs. So much better than breast meat. More pricey, but the best chicken.
I mean, I'm pretty sure it is. Don't bet your paycheck on it though. 

Yup: PR, Guam, us Virgin islands, northern Mariana islands, American Samoa
Agreed. I had not ever thought that there may be Americans who don't know it's 50. But, I'm constantly surprised at people's ignorance.
I thought this same thing immediately. 
It's in the same boat as Guam right?
We have this unique system though, it's capitalism for the poor people, and socialism for everyone else.
Fair enough, but that isn't always the exchange
Well, the winters are severe, which is a deal breaker for a lot of people. I've never been to the West coast so I can't compare. What I like is I can live in one of our cities yet only have to drive a few minutes to get to anything I want. Ocean, lakes, Rivers, mountains, whatever. We have a population of 1.3 million but are visited by over 35 million each year which is why we're called vacation land. 
10.85 is more than many people make in the states...
That doesn't make sense to me, isn't your minimum wage over 10$?
I love Montreal, visited several times. I seriously considered moving there, but I don't want to go through the hassle (I'm American unfortunately) of changing countries. I'm amazed at how affordable real estate is in such a big, and nice, city. 
Bangor, Maine. About a grand for a nice multi bedroom place. Less than a grand for a not so fancy place. Fantastic small city. 
But, your weather is much nicer eh? 
Hey, someone has to protect you from the Canadians! Also, it's a stunningly gorgeous state with more coastline than California, affordable housing, and no crime. 
Every time I work in Mass, I am reminded why I stay in Maine. 
The government is literally ignoring democracy. There should be a special election to replace all members of Maine legislature, and certainly the governor.
Mainer here. A citizens initiative should never be challenged. If it passes, IDC if the initiative is: murder is now legal on Tuesdays. If it is democratically chosen, that should be the end of it. 
Aaahh I gotcha. It's all a wash though. Thirty years ago interest may have been 15% for a mortgage, but houses cost 30k in many places. 
There are programs. I used a rural development loan which is federally backed. No money down, and 3.625%. there are income stipulations I'm sure.
Same here. It was barely worth itemizing the year I bought my house. Gotta figure that it's only going to really help people paying very high interest (even if the rate is low). Just another example of people who can afford 800k$ houses getting more help than someone who can only afford a 100k$ house.  
How do you figure it's 'free' money? Are you assuming my home value is going to be 2.5 times what it was when I purchased it? I don't remember exactly, but assuming I only make minimum payments (I'm not) I will have paid more than double what the original purchase price was. And that's at 3.625% 
I'll be driving 21 hours (no stops)
I certainly wouldn't fit in then 😞
TIL I belong in Germany. I would love it if everyone was just honest. I've heard from many people though that Germans don't have much of a sense of humor though.. That wouldn't fly with me. 
Is the night King a Stark?
You're splitting hairs here; it's a thirty minute drive from center City Nashville to the most prime viewing location. I don't leave anywhere near totality, so I'm making a trip out of this, my summer vacation. 
It would seem to and I have looked at different maps for the eclipse. According to NASA Nashville is in the totality path.
I'm really not sure what you're referring to. I don't live in Nashville I'm just going there for a trip.
The peak of the event is also very close to Nashville
Funny, I'm going to Nashville for the event, and had no problem at all booking a hotel room. Tons of hotels there though, so who knows. 
Yeah, she's a shitty person. But it's just as fair to say someone let another person's​ words end their life. I'm NOT defending her, but I AM saying I don't consider her a criminal.
I choose to acknowledge reality. Prison doesn't help the majority. If it's not helping, and only hurting, why do we do it?
That's one take on it. I'm certainly struggling with how to think about this situation. As of right now, I see her as a super cunt. Someone who makes you go: wow you're a crazy fucking bitch, and then you move on with life and never talk to her again. There are people in prison for actual murder who probably wouldn't bother me as much, who knows. I personally don't want to put people in prison for being a super cunt.
That's just revenge. She doesn't seem like a threat to yours or my safety, she shouldn't be locked up. 
I feel the same way. I won an iPad air from my credit union just for being a member. It's great, I have no complaints at all. I'm an Android phone user fwiw. But, my phone does everything the iPad does at least as far as my usage goes. I wouldn't buy a tablet; a laptop seems like a better option if you already own a capable phone.
Have I been spelling check wrong my whole life?
What about teeth?
I can't think of how I'd get a hard on with a woman who doesn't want to have sex with me. I mean, if my girlfriend said: I don't want to have sex right now but if you want to, we still can, I still would definitely not have sex with her. 
Well, in the states, you decide to be one or not when you get your license. So, yes?
I mean, I think there are certain people who could potentially pay for an 'accident' to happen to someone. It'd be incredibly rare, but I'm sure it's happened.
I'm a donor myself, but that is the one I think about sometimes. People who fucked up their lungs from smoking or their liver from drinking shouldn't get another chance. 
Hey, don't bring Pete into this!

Lol, sorry. I'm an awful Evangelical nationalist.

I can say my issue with using taxes for things like education and healthcare, is that I don't have faith that it is efficient use of money. Here in the states, healthcare related costs are incredibly high, and need to be reduced. At that point, I will be heavily in favor of a universal system. Same goes for education. My taxes pay for 13 years of it, but a person who completes those years is not qualified to do anything. 
I get 60/5 for the same price. Maine

The Republicans want a few things to pass first: lower taxes and such. Then they will likely grow spines and try to save their re elections. They probably assume that the next president will be a Democrat and then they won't get any of the stuff they want. 
So how do people prepare for better jobs?

Apple computers are known to last longer (at high performance) though. Only Apple product I have is the iPad air, but it's still running like new. Pay more upfront to know that you won't have to replace soon. 
Installed VLC for Android, seems to work
Ok, I did that. Found one of the episodes in my download folder. Selected it, now how do I play it?
I installed it, but I don't see any way to play my downloads
I'll check it out. Thanks
Healthcare is a human right, as long as costs go down. Some basic blood work and a half hour visit to the P.A. Cost me almost 500$. I don't want my taxes paying for that anymore than I want to pay for that out of my own pocket.

The whole series is fantastic, i wish he did the same thing for WW2
Mud dobbers? Are those the massive bastards who live in the South US? Probably other places too, but that's where I saw them. I don't see them in New England. I remember being able to see their stinger from a couple yards away. 
There's a podcast called hardcore history by Dan Carlin, he has a multi episode series about WW1. Probably twenty hours of WW1 history, and this guy is far from boring. Blew my mind because WW2 overshadows it so much, but WW1 was probably worse for the soldiers.
I feel like the coolest thing to do in a part of the country where this happens is to have the smallest rims possible on the largest tires possible. It's called bucking the trend, good sir.

But idk, where I live people go for more rubber, not more steel.
I visited Ireland (from US) a few months ago; started in Limerick and loved it there I never felt unsafe everyone was nice or at least didn't bother me at all. Wasn't till I went to Cork where I learned about limerick's reputation. I had to laugh, I know I'm not a local, but I didn't get any dangerous vibes at all as I explored the city. 
I was there a few months ago. Very nice place. I'm American FWIW, but the locals said I look Danish. 
No, the article is fake news. What a dummy! 
Have you forgotten ww1? They put up a pretty good fight that time. 
This was very helpful, thank you. Do you think that capitalism, through automation and a UBI, can reach the same result as socialism/communism? Or are there still inherent issues in capitalism even if (hypothetically) everyone has what they need to be able to be free to create because they don't need to worry about profit? Is the end game actually the same?
Thanks
I listen to a lot of podcasts and books, it's hard to prioritize which one to listen to next. A summary seems fair to begin with.
So I haven't read any of Marx's books and I'm not sure I want to, but I've read up on and listened to his main points from a few podcasts. He seems spot on with the issues with capitalism, but I'm lost on how he transitions to communism. Can someone make a quick bridge for me?
You say that, but I went in to see the doc to deal with a small problem and check my overall health; all he did was read me surveys from his computer and tell me to pay attention to my sleep. You dumb mother fucker, I just discussed with you that I don't get enough sleep, I have trouble sleeping more than 4 or 5 hours. It's not for lack of trying. 500 dollars and all I get is: pay attention to your sleep. This is why I will not be going to see the doc unless it's life threatening. 

Do better at actually helping people, and I'll be very happy to maintain regular visits to the doc.
Different culture for sure, even though we're so close. It's just a: don't cause problems kinda situation. I mean, the police chief in my city publicly said that residents should arm themselves because police cannot possibly respond quickly enough to protect you should that incredibly rare circumstance arise. The police don't seem at all concerned with marijuana use.
Same situation here in Maine. Nobody really has a problem though. I can grow it on my property legally, possess it, and use it on private property legally. Cops don't seem to give a damn about it honestly. Is it any different in mass?
Where is this democracy you speak of? Only oligarchys exist 
I'm convinced that many employers, when they test, exclude marijuana from it. I'm nearly 30, worked for a handful of companies and never been tested at all though. I really feel like there would be a very high level of unemployment if employers here (Maine) tested.
I thought that movie was very flamboyant as is
Yup. All the proof I need, the Earth is definitely flat

You work retail, too?
No stem degree here. 
I've been playing (casually) for about three years. The first couple times I went out I was backhanding like everyone else I saw, and it just wasn't working for me. Third or forth time, I went with a guy who flicks and he showed me the basics and before I knew it I was getting single digits over par on most courses. Kinda weird, everyone I play with finds it interesting how I can be decent with forehand but total beginner with backhand.
I'm still wondering why I shouldn't move to Ireland... I'm not religious, but that's ok right?
Kid's gonna need Tommy John survey before he hits 12
Flicking is all I can really do :( backhanding (for any kind of distance) feels so strange to me. 
But then the bidet is only at home, and I'll be really bummed when I poop anywhere else
It's simple really: there's no social responsibility in capitalism. 
Way to ruin my hopes and dreams
Where is this? I know it's a rite aid, but where?
You always make sure your emotions are honest... To me, the people who are uncomfortable with this notion are the people with a 'disorder'. As an adult, I'm still learning the 'appropriate' emotional responses to have to any given situation. Seems like wasted effort so far.
Is it more honorable to use chemical warfare on people who can't fight back? 
I mean, Reddit would still be thriving.

So if Uncle Sam says ok all medical providers this is what we're going to pay you for each service you provide and that's all there is to it. Everyone in the insurance industry loses their job. I mean how does this really work? I want it to be the way it is, but even if I don't have to 'pay' for it, I've still had such negative experiences with the industry in general. Making it free won't make the quality of service any better will it?
I also support it, but only after we fix the healthcare industry. I don't want to pay such high prices for such piss poor care, and I also don't want my taxes paying for such high prices. 

Fix it, then make it universal. 
Have you met medical 'professionals'? I cannot find good care. I live in America. In a small City. I don't want any of the doctors I've seen deciding anything.
We don't ask questions about the South. We should have let them secede... We should have opened our arms to fleeing slaves, and let those backwards fucking people secede.

Neverending Urban sprawl? No farm land or anything to break it up? Like, I could drive from LA to San Diego and be in a city the whole time?
A square must be a rectangle, a rectangle is not necessarily a square
When I lived down south, I regularly encountered people who thought Maine was surrounded by ocean (other than its border with NH)... Or that it was literally part of Canada. 

If it's not in the Bible, they don't learn it apparently
Yeah they don't seem to understand that a generally attractive non fat woman is going to match every guy she swipes right on. Gotta weed them out somehow
We're on the same page
As many? Who knows... Probably not. But, to hate a president for giving us false hopes on the campaign trail? Sure, but it's a universal thing.
Until the voters start focusing on actual economic policy, political candidates will keep yelling about things they can't or won't change. When we have a candidate who actually focuses on policy, such as Gary Johnson, nobody is interested in hearing actual substance just rhetoric.
Could easily say the same about Obama. I don't support Trump but I'm not going to give him shit for doing the same thing every other president does
My state just legalized recreational, but where in the country do cops even care? I even live in a state where the only crime is domestic assault, and cops don't fucking care about people smoking a little pot. You just don't set up a pot selling stand on the side of the street.

Maybe it's because I live in the whitest state, idk. But the only time I'm in danger of being bothered by cops is if I'm driving.
The world's first trillion dollar company will be aramco, eh?
Just move to a state that's free. We have great knives.
A vasectomy does not remove organs.

When people in our capitalist system acquire enough money, they essentially are living in a socialist system. The difference is, the banks and​ Wall Street are giving them their money, not the government. It's all a blur though, really. 

Socialism for the rich, capitalism for everyone else
But once the people vote, the winner has no obligation to the voters. The voters can't vote the winner out. Only the established, bought and paid for Congress can do that. 
You'd probably feel really good about yourself if you got 60 million votes and, ya know, became president. Just saying
Just like the first 'black' president had to be flawless as a person, the first woman will likely need to be as well. Hillary would probably have been better than Trump, sure.

I voted for Johnson, because I like most of his social and economic stances. 
A better question would be: because I'm not a Muslim. Putting in Christian or anything else is moot. Valid question though
It doesn't matter, he chose to take the lives of free people who weren't causing him harm. He didn't like that they aren't like him.

With social networking, why don't consumers have an easy upper hand then? Gas, we all need, sure. Can't really boycott that. But what about cars? Hey everyone, let's agree we only want to pay 20k for a new Sierra Denali.

Well, the federal DOE is not succeeding. Seems to me we would just adopt a successful system like Germany or Finland (I'm sure there are other good systems), but if we aren't going to change the system then I'd rather not fund it at all

To be fair, our social safety nets help only certain people and are only a bandaid. That is, they don't actually solve problems. Also, these safety nets are incredibly expensive. 

My thought: I'd like to see changes, but before eliminating the current setup, there needs to be another setup in place.

Right, so I'm confused about the privatizing infrastructure comment. Of course private companies would do the work, subsidized by government.
Yeah... Unfortunately that's correct
Well, it's not considered privatized if it's subsidized is it? 
If that infrastructure deal goes through, that'd be good. If I don't have to pay a penalty for opting out of our shitty healthcare industry, that'd be good. 

Obama was a class act. Seems like a great guy, didn't make me feel embarrassed to be American. But, the bailout, the ACA, crying about guns when guns aren't the fucking problem. I didn't vote for Trump, and I don't think I could bring myself to do it. But Obama wasn't good for this country. Neither was W. 
Gronk did this topless... Just saying
Because the Democrats embracing Bernie isn't the point. The point is two parties can't represent 350 million (?) People. I think 4 would do a pretty good job. If we're going from left to right: Green, Democrat, libertarian, Republican
Would a prostate exam from someone with a liberal arts degree make you more comfortable?
Nice. I like that idea. In New Hampshire for example, there is no sales tax, but there is a 9% restaurant tax. 
Apparently not if there are apps for it lol
In the states, it's the norm. We're strange though so I wouldn't be surprised if we're the only country that does it. 
I travel throughout New England regularly. Drivers in RI and Mass are equally aggressive, but Mass drivers are much more accommodating. RI drivers are happy to get into an accident if it means not letting you switch lanes. 
I actually struggle big time with this. For example, a good friend of mine just lost a friend and a relative within months of each other (as in they died).  I've never experienced that kind of loss, so I just don't feel anything. I feel for my friend, but I can't actually empathize with her feelings. 
Yeah, just gotta know what the restaurant tax rate is for your state

I think the bottom line is this: the government never talks about putting restrictions on what a man can do with his body, but is always doing so when it comes to women's bodies. 

In the meantime, government loves that people care about this because that means government doesn't have to spend time on the things that matter much more like: education, healthcare, and living wage as a right for all. And also infrastructure. 
But not this time! 
Obligatory: how many potatoes does it take to kill an Irishman?

Fair enough, thanks for the insight and I will spend some time trying to better understand the differences. 

Regardless, the government is paying for Viagra.
Any program fully funded by taxes is a socialist program. It seems I may have used the term subsidize incorrectly though. That would actually be a private company being given taxes to operate, right? 

The DoD, and department of Justice are absolutely socialist programs.
Huh? Plane tickets are dirt cheap right now... I can get round trip to Europe for less than 500$... That's insane. 
Department of defense is a government subsidized department. A100% socialist program. So if the DoD subsidizes something, then the government is subsidizing something. Am I misunderstanding what you're saying?
Well, when all the DNC focuses on is illegal immigration and insulting people who don't support their cause, it's easy to find someone else to support.

Just realized I could say the same thing about the GOP. To hell with both parties.

Indeed, and not a radical liberal who won't listen to others. I don't know his legislative record, I just know I generally like the guy and I do not know him from his comedy days. 

I'm sure I'm not the only one thinking this, but the Dems need to pony up with an incredibly likeable candidate.
I agree. He's a good balance too. Experienced enough with the political system, but not an establishment, career politician
Franken 2020?
My prediction is Rey goes dark, and Kylo dies in episode 8. I've been thinking this since I first saw TFA. I just don't think Kylo is going to be THE villain, and every time I watch TFA, I see Rey operate on pure emotion throughout the movie. 'best' case scenario, her angry is in check like when mace windu. 
Wouldn't quite work that way buddy.

Radical Canadian Christian terrorism. Just say it! When is Trump going to ban Canadians? The only way we're going to make America safe again is to ban Americans from being in America. It's the only way. /S 

Also, WTF Canada. You're supposed to be the cool, chill, peaceful folks. Stop trying to be pointlessly violent like the rest of us.

Player gets a huge payday but only one year on the contract. Team has to dish out lots of money/take a big cap hit but only has to commit to one year.
You may not be referring to this circumstance, but what about if I'm on an unfamiliar route (highway) and I legitimately don't realize that the line for the exit is backed up a mile and a half? So I go by them, and then realize oh shit that's the line for my exit. I mean, at that point I know I'm the asshole, but I really didn't know it was backed up that far. 
I feel the same way, until a Democrat challenger comes along and just doesn't align with too many of my views. I don't care which party the candidate is from, I will vote for who most aligns with my economic (most important to me) and social views. I'd like to see more 'Gary Johnson style' libertarians myself.
