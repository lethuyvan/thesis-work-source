I don't know anyone who uses linkedIn to get money. 

The rest are pretty apt to how the services are used, and what behavious are encouraged on the platform. 

Yelps not as good either, but at least I understand it. 
Iirc it's when the service first rolled back, I don't recall the year. But it's been a while. 
Only if you consider those people who died in Australian Outback from a terrible Apple Maps that caused them to recall map service. 
No idea what this is. I'm assuiming it's a line drawing .png image which utilizes the alpha layer

Didn't see you post in time. Frankly i think that was the first peice of shit I've ever seen on the internet. 
Spent a few summers working in Petosky. Wonderful place. 
Probably arguing that each room in which a screen is located is in itself a theater. 
Okay. And your opinion on company retirement plans? IRAs? 401ks? 

Do you simply not like it because you're forced to pay?

You're forced to pay taxes too, are these stolen out of your paycheck?

Or do you not like the lack of freedom to save in a way you want? A smart way?

There's a lot of problems with SS, and it's an old program but if you're not saving even with paying for SS are you still dumb?

What if you can't afford to put away any savings? Are you dumb?

And you're argument of consistency *is* *dumb* because SS is not objectively a dumb idea. Sticking a fork in an electrical outlet is. Which is why we have warnings, because *real* dumb people *do* exist. Just not the ones you perceive. 
Well if you're insisting you're on topic you aren't clear enough by what you mean. Because I've read this far down and have no idea the point you're making. 
>Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s choice to serve as his spokeswoman met with President Trump to assure him of her loyalty to his agenda so that she would be hired, according to a report from the Washington Post.

Who the fuck wrote this. Jesus this grammar is hard to parse. 

Session's choice...as his...with Trump...him or her to his so that she

Edit; to me originally I read it as Sessions was serving as his own spokeswoman
You're not wrong.

But I don't understand this advice given constantly in this sub as a solution to any problem. The point of MPs subscription is any movie* anywhere anytime. 


I'm saying that because your post doesn't make any sense if you understand me. 
>Experience the digital difference that is BigD. This premium, large-screen format, 

Not allowed. 
Thus headline is a loaded one. 

Literally for a one time access to the developers company which made the other app and no private information was shared. Just public during a short timeframe. Twitter ceased any dealings with CA. 

>“In 2015, GSR did have one-time API access to a random sample of public tweets from a five-month period from December 2014 to April 2015,” 
>I’m someone who enjoys good standup comedy, which is probably why I had never heard of Ms. Wolf before this morning.

Because that's obviously the only logical conclusion. 
Streaming games is obviously a different use case than simply saying gaming tho. 

I do agree however. 

As for your lag there are other contributing factors after ping and before bandwidth like CPU , graphics card, graphics settings, RAM, practically any spec of a computer that's different than yours
What you call out in the bottom picture as wasted space is because it's designed to fit nicely, and easily onto smaller monitors where that negative space will be scalled down. 

What's the resolution of your monitor? Because that matters greatly for your complaint. 
Go ahead. Now the downvotes are coming in. 
Probably because he's already been banned 43 times. 
>able to browse web on smartphone... No real need

And argument goes flying out the window. 

Just simply on the fact you brought of want versus need. If your phone is your only internet abled device then you cannot go without the internet on your phone. 

Can a human survive without it? Yes. Can you function in a modern society without being able to pay your bills, get your vehicle registered, your IDs renewed not to mention free education, free access to services, to help, to therapy.

Before you argue you can do all that in person or by mail I will ask, do you? 

Your argument is very close to why have technology at all? Why improve the quality of society when all we need is a cave, some animal hide and a fire?


-.- I'm referring to you. Not the comment above. Most users here weren't around for that and you know it. 
>And before that, ~~we~~ you could only see the same movie once. And you paid more for it. 




For multiplayer gaming you need latency not bandwidth
Sure enough mine looks like yours now. Fixed. 
Well seeing how you cropped the screen nobody is going to be able to discuss your usage.
Only makes it seem like a robot if you don't take it literally. 
Indo see other people online with your issue. Some are fixed with update apparently. Others use an app workaround as suggested earlier. 

One fix would be to sinoky disable ipv6 for the time being but I know that isn't desirable. 

Setting another router up in bridge may fix it but have no clue wether once it hits the modem if its just going to go back again. 
Do you have a VPN running in that screenshot?
If you set new DNS in adroid settings I don't understand why it's still forcing you to use a DNS from another device. 

Because it doesn't force it on your PC right? Just Android?
rn is shorthand for right now. 
You should also mention on #3 his refusal to implement Russian sanctions after veto-proof majority passed it and he himself signed it. 
You can always install a second router in-line with your home network if your router was provided by your ISP or if they gave you a modem/router combo-in-one. 

You may not be able to set the DHCP in the router still if your ISP rebinds the IP. Bit you will be able to configure each device individually to look to the pihole for DNS. 
No. Method 1. Why can't you just change in your WiFi settings?
And why won't the non-root methods on XDA work for you?
I'm not evaluating whether the current topic is worth discussion.

I'll agree that it could be dystopian. But that's the world everyone's created between bots, trolls and fake news. And that philosophy exists separate from what actually happened here. 

As I said, I didn't go sniffing in his history before posting to see if he was real. Another user called it out and I checked for myself - something I believe you should do before making remarks like I have, and what I saw concerned me, so I decided to speak out. 



I'm talking about his website. Not CYA. 

Website https://imgur.com/gallery/i99H0MX
Somebody get this man a website designer. 
I think this is the first time I've ever seen a world leader campaign on the talking points of "if you don't vote GOP" they'll kick me out"...
Does it have a rigid frame? 

Like will it be a cylinder even when not completely full? Could it stand on it's end?
Not sure if you're still looking but have you looked at mission workshop? It checks of a lot of stuff besides organisational pockets. They're more off a onearge compartment type of place. 

You can still buy organizational packing cubes though. 
I'm also looking for a small duffel, this looks promising. 
You're right to point out that wasn't the point of the video but it a as hardly a good video for showing the space. 

Square footage wasn't shown. None of the angles really showed you the size of the rooms etc. New York gave a lot more personal info and how he likes to decorate and the Houston clips especially at the beginning were really short. 

Of anything it's a fair example of what might be "basic" for $1500 in terms of amenities. Dishwasher, laundry, gym etc. But the comparison still isn't that good because New York was clearly an exception. 


Eh, not for me, price isn't that bad anyways. Thanks again!
Thanks. I might have to try them out. I've never bought carhart before, are you aware of any regular sales etc?
In the U.S. 6'0", 170lb

T-shirt - Mossimo from Target. V-Neck

Polo - used to be Kohls slim polo bit they got rid of slim and reg for a single "modern fit" after a year or two the material would wear thing from tucking it in behind the button ofy jeans. 

Open to suggestions on Polos, under $30 would be great

Pants - Levi's 511 in black for shows and a muted green/brown/khaki for shop work.

Shorts - 511 brand, but I don't wear them too often anymore. I used them alot more when I was running changeovers. Along with a rothco vest for hardware. 

Boots - Walmart interceptor work boot. 

And a regular fleece lined black hoodie. 

At $40 those pants seem like a great deal. Have anything more to say about them? How long do they last?
How do the pants breath? My pants that are more carpenter-esque are a bit thick and don't breath to well, I think they're old Dickies. 
Fucking yes! Mossimo black v-neck t-shirt from Target is my go-to for Ts
I'm running a show right now where we're costumed in grey Dickies trousers and their flex shirt. 

It's okay stuff but the pants are natural waist which translates to just above my belly button and there's just way too much material. Might be better if your more of a buff build but I'm not too much of a fan. 
Subbed. Curious where this may go. 
Does a sticky thread for Genre or Mood playlists under an official Social DJ ID sound like a good idea?

Something that can rotate monthly and hopefully have everyone in the sub contribute?
Not sure if this is right. But predestination?

I haven't said anything of these things. 
I'm not trying to silence him. I'm trying to provide advice that posting animal abuse to peoplefuckingdying, using the N word, calling cops names and making fun of autistic people won't fly when he gets older. And it's signs of a pattern that something might be wrong. 

And if he's telling the truth about being in the hospital after trying to take his own life and only having six months to live, that this behavior and those communities might be contributing to his isolatation and unhappiness. 

He and you don't have to listen. But I'm going to try to help, to inform, to advise. To a 13 year old that it seems the world around in him life is failing him. 
It's not stalking, another user called it out earlier in the thread. I took maybe a minute to check it out myself. 

In this day and age post history is the only way to even know if you're going to have a discussion with someone worthwhile or if their just a troll. 

P.S. I love Exile and Divinity
Ummm.. your entire account history is filled with counter-racism and litterally "it's just a joke" comments...
I never said a particular meme was superior. 

And its only a meme if it's shared enough by a particular culture or imitated. 

Just like if no one laughs at a joke maybe it's not a joke...
So when they say

>They also are seeking unredacted versions of filings and transcripts from court actions in the case against Manafort, who continues to fight his charges. 

They actually mean give me a *version* without redactions even though the mere existence of this alternative edition means that information was removed or redacted in it's creation?
Got it. I don't think anyone is making that argument though. 

More of the act of releasing "sensitive info" added with new public discussion of an ongoing criminal case / president now gets involved. Mistrial etc. 

With as little interference as possible. Including from the news orgs. 
Woops sorry. Didn't realize the distinction. 
Edit: the comment below refers to Humble not Houston

The only think I know of was the 20 million rennovation of Turner Stadium at humble high school, sometime around 2010-2012 I think 
It's a pattern of his entire post history. Not just a single joke. Plus there's ways to be funny and share memes that's not crossing a line. 
I see. In reference to the defense in the article. Not in the comment he's replying to. 

I don't see how it's CNNs constitutional right then for info on another court case though. Or what info is being used against CNN as the comment suggests. 

I'm not sure that is what he meant. But okay. 
So what about the animal abuse videos on peoplefuckingdying?

What about the autism joke that was removed from midly interesting. 

It's a Pattern. And I'm telling you to stop and listen. 
~~CNN isn't the defendant~~ got it. 
And I'm telling you. Listen. It ain't funny, it's disrespectful, it's rude, and it's racist. 

I'm not saying you don't think it's funny, I'm suggesting you take a moment and listen to the people around you and reflect. Right now you're probably in 8th Grade, if you keep this up and say something to the wrong person you'll likely be beat up. 

And if you ask why you would ever say something like that out loud to someone I would ask why the hell you'd post it online then. 
And somehow "Donut Cop Arresting N---S" is a joke too?

Because it's not. You're 13 and it seems you don't know better. 

Please take a moment and reflect. 
Oh man. That sidebar. 
Uh. I guess we're asking, how?
There's apks on XDA that YMMV depending on varient. It's what I did back on Nougat. Upgraded to Oreo and I noinher have the option to pick it in settings but it's still applied. 
There's a splash about the TOS change when ioenjng the app and concurrent movie titles are blacked out saying "you've already seen this movie"
>Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said he made "a judgment call'' to inform the White House and reporters about the existence of dozens of intelligence reports in which the communications of an undisclosed number of transition members — and possibly Trump himself — were swept up by intelligence officials following the November election.

Iirc this is around the time when he made the "midnight run to the white house"

Other than that there's just rumors of him passing info directly to Trump. He is still suspected as the source for many leaks. 

>Sources on the Senate Intelligence Committee suspect that House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes and his staff were behind the leak of Sen. Mark Warner's text messages with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch.
But Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr denied The New York Times report Thursday that the committee had concluded that the House Intelligence Committee Republicans were involved in the leak of the text messages to Fox News.

And still Nunes released the (R)Memo which was made in secret. While legal, it's methodology was super shaded. 

Really it'll be Sessions now to be imoroperly informing Trump as the investigations continue. 

Nunes is still a price of work. He was even on Trump's Transition Team. 

SiNEMiA has a plan that 2 movie nights of 2 tickets each. So there's less freedom in when, and it's only 2 for you. 

It's also $18 right bow with the promotion, so twice as much. 

Only one night can be a premium showing and month be 30 days apart, not reset with each calendar month. 

You can buy online for advance but only one holding at a time. 

So there's still a lot restrictions, MP used to have basically none. So for all the rules they're getting closer. 

And both only seem to do annual subscriptions now. 

But for money saved MP still has SiNEMiA beat beat. And that's probably why MP is struggling to keep spending down and no one is reporting on SiNEMiA. 
That's fun. My dog is a similar mix, although a bit more beige in color and the same ridge markings on his back etc. and his name is Rio.  

Spanish for River. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/Qo6VfXU

He's 17. 
I don't know how the app makes that distinction. And the TOS you have to agree with when you open it. 
I just signed up for SiNEMiA last week. Mostly because I want to see some IMAX again and to take my girlfriend. Who doesn't have MP. 

MP has a technical patent. Won't stop others from offering similar things. It's abvuius there's a massive market of interest for movie theatre subscriptions. It's just a matter of time if MP steps back up or someone takes over their market share. 
The each movie only once update today effects everyone and is coded into the app. 

There is no grandfathering. 

And that's where the comaint is. 

No one with one movie a day is complaining they only currently offer 4 movies a month unless they we're just coming off a gift subscription
Made this only for new users? That's be okay. 

Give notice that next bulling cycle this will take effect? Not great for users but okay. 

Granted. If they allow you to easily get a refund that would be the bare minimum they should do at this point. Which applies to annual subscribers too. 

Does anyone know of that's the case?
None of these are in context of when and only half mention pricing to accompany it. 

1. Definitely before the 9.99 drop. Which I'm pretty sure is safe to leave out of this conversation. We're talking about what was advertised to users in context of the recent TOS change. Plus very few users we're members back then. 

2. Don't know when this was but was at least before the app redesign (which I will admit is somewhat recent

3. This looks like the standard agreement mostly everyone signed up for. It also doesn't mention unlimited like. At all. 

4. Same as 2. I have no idea when this is or worth what plan. Could be as old as #1, could be more recent. Who knows. This also looks like it's been cropped out of a newsletter. 

5. Same as #3. Does say unlimited, but has an asterisk which is clearly qualified right below. 

And any of these could still have fine print - possible even readily available explaining the actual terms. 

So I'd like to correct my statement that they may have technically advertised "unlimited" but no one ever actually thought that was true in any case. And despite using the word they're actually alot clearer with their disclaimers then let's say a telephone company. 

It's not screwing you over if it's clear that when they say unlimited*, they don't actually mean unlimited. 

With that said. Today's change of TOS which widely effects how their product is consumed to users who have already reached an agreement and paid for services without forenotice *is an issue.*

Nobody has a right to yell at MP because this makes it no longer unlimited - because that was never the schtick. It was 1 movie a day every day. 

Does that mean you can yell about running out of movies in a month? Sure - but you aren't. You're saying this effectively stops the program from being unlimited and fasley advertising when they've never actually said they were. 
It's not just about the value of the subscription. It's also supporting a company who without notice changes their TOS and App to something other than what you agreed to when you gave them your money. 


I'm 6' and weigh just under you...
I don't think it was ever advertised as unlimited...

But I agree it was advertised one a day, and something tells me theres less than 30 movies playing ea month at your local theatre.
I don't think the comparison is fair. Even by your own admission:

>policy wonk (plural policy wonks) (politics, government) A person who studies or develops strategies andpolicies, especially one who has a keen interest in and aptitude for technical details

>policy wonks are the ones with all the information about a particular subject or areaof policy.

>chiefs of staff have agendas; policy wonks have information


Yes and all the others. AP is just passing along info from a chineese source, using language like "suggesting" they "say". Etc

A cavity did collapse. The mountain did not. The site is still usable.

...

Shills are not a problem of the redesign, they are a result of the site itself. 

And even still,

Paid bots etc have a lower number of engagement than corporations who create organic looking content that are actually disguised ads. (and that's on all the social networks). Therefore the latter should be of more concern. .
I've only subscribed here for a month maybe but you guys have made it clear what voices you like to hear and what you dont. 
FC3 was my first. Played it around when 4 came out. 

Now Im just playing Primal (picked it over 4 since they apparently have the same map and felt primal was a cool concept with possibly a more unique gameplay) and I'm wishing I just bought 5 instead. Not having as much fun with Primal as o did in Far Cry 3.

That's a fair point. But who is even comfortable biking in denim? And what college is that where people aren't equally likely to go to class in shorts and a hoodie?
Completely agree. I annually buy Levi's (black ones too) and after a year and a half was the fading considerable and the knees worn out visually more than the rest. 

I do know alot of people that have the wear from their phones but I keep mine in my back pocket so I have no idea how quickly that wears into the jeans. 
Same. I thought this arcticle was really interesting to me because I also annually purchase Levi's, and they're also for work, the same goes for a pair of steel toed boots I buy from Walmart. At 40-55$ for boots, replacing them every year isn't a big deal, and I get to refresh them every year where a much more expensive boot would certainly last as long but won't be looking nearly as good at it's end of life. 

And for that reason, I don't think I'd consider that for work wear, but I feel that's mostly the reason I'd consider this article. 

I like fashion, and don't really spend on anything expensive but I value options and diversity than having a pair of jeans I wear for 300 days out of the year. 
Possibly originaly but the mountain did not collapse. Only a university. AP is not working with all the info, only passing along the Chinese report. 
A cavity did collapse. The mountain did not. The site is still okay for more tests. 
No. It didn't. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/8ezko1/geologists_say_north_koreas_main_nuclear_test/dy09z7y/
Before this article takes off any farther this arcticle is misleading. A cavity has most likely collapsed, but the same site may continue to be used.

You said the biggest problem was paid shills or AstroTurfing. 

I said earlier:

>As far as "corporate shills" there are definitely a higher number of companies using all social media sites trying to promote content that looks organic than are paying people or bots for upvotes.

So I would say as far as content being misleadingly sent to the top the latter would be a larger cause of concern. 

We already know in regards to Russian trolls on Reddit. False news was massively shared by unwittingly real people. Not just paid bots. 
Thanks for that. 

Can you know address the second half of my comment where I ask if you think this is a larger part of "promoted content" on Reddit when compared to corporate "organic" oriented content?
That's exactly what I said. 

I was being funny saying you can count change. Because you literally can. 
Is there a live link you can share or a known reputable source?

That entire website is apparently dead. 

I do understand they've shared a lot of screenshots in their blog post. 

This is also 1 event. 

As far as "corporate shills" there are definitely a higher number of companies using all social media sites trying to promote content that looks organic than are paying people or bots for upvotes
Dude. You did say shills are the problem. 

You can't then say another user is predicting (whatever that means in this context) an argument of false pretenses. 

You raised the premise. He answered it. 

And it's not so much paid shills as it is PR firms organically inserting ads and letting real users unknowngly promote essentially paid for content. 

Which he's right to say isn't a problem of the redesign. Just Reddit itself. 
No. But they still report a pleasent or easy return process. Can also simply be providing info for others on how to return. 
It's 311
Kygo did a similar thing with a track called *intro* on his debit album 

https://youtu.be/bm6M0YX-KE8

Obviously it sounds more like his genre being a lot of tropical house. But I've always found seem similar because they're both instrumental introdutions to an album.  
Another suggestion would be to nest the multiple alarms together. 

So it reads "Alarm at 6 pm" large and then a sub caption or something "with consecutive alarms every 10 min for 30min"

If I'm generating 5 alarms I shouldn't need easy access to disable a single one of them. So being able to toggle a main sequence with the additional alarms nested would be a better UX for me. 
Amount of change you can count. 

But your right. You can't count changes (in the money sense) you're actually counting a number of pennies, of dimes etc. 
Okay. This guy should resign. We all know this already. 

But the moment my news starts asking rhetorical questions in ALL CAPS?!? I'm done. 

CNN opinion is almost as bad as Fox news. Luckily the facts are more less accurate. Too bad for the hyperbole and the slant because it makes this unreadable. 
I'm pretty sure the mooches were separated before he took the job. 
And there's the answer. It was open source. The website was made completely available to others... 

Calm down dude. 

It is still the best fishing site I'd ever heard of. 

Edit: and in 998 comments scanning years you literally have a 5% kindness meter rating score. So I'm not actually surprised by the way you're responding. 
Bad bot
How do they get an exact copy of a website that also fully functional?

As I said. It would be the best phishing site I've ever seen. 
See my other comment. 

 >For example, if you are being questioned by your defense attorney, and he or she asks if you were present at the scene of the crime, you might answer "no" - that's a legitimate answer.  Then, on cross-examination, the prosecution might start asking where you were, or using other evidence to prove that you were there - because you "opened the door" on where you were during direct examination, you can't subsequently plead the Fifth on the same matter at a later time.

As long as "the door has been opened"

He must answer none or all. 

> Federal grand juries can force people to take the witness stand, but defendants in those proceedings have Fifth Amendment privileges until they choose to answer any question.

Edit: He must answer any questions after a door has been opened in a line of questioning. So for reasons it is likely to plead 5th to all questions to prevent any doors to open. He technically can answer any question he wants.

For the curious:

>The Texas triscuit is a variation introduced at Trinity University. The design has similar 
advantages in terms of strength and weight. However, though the layout is similar, it has ′′ some important differences structurally. Most obviously, it uses a frame made from 1 1/2 16-gauge steel tube, in essentially the same shape as Figure 1. More significantly, it is 
not a stress-skin platform, as it has no bottom skin. This means the stress-skin structural analysis mentioned before does not apply; instead it relies upon the strength of the steel used. Helpfully, it also means that it is possible to attach a normal compression leg to the frame, instead of using a studwall.

We do use studwalls pretty exclusively though. And custom triscuits plugs for triangles etc. Also have a small handful of 1/2 size triscuits. 

And since it was raised in the other thread, we also use Spax Lags when putting these suckers down. 

They have predrilled holes just off the corners through the steel allowing them to be screwed down in any orientation to the stud walls. 


I suppose but the fake phishing site would need to be the best I've ever seen.

> ...it offers a promo rate of $8.99 or whatever instead of $24.99 so it would seem obvious, like most promotional plans, that your price goes up at some point

Right. In my case $18 instead of $45. But monthly is no longer an option. You pay annually up front. How can they raise your "monthly rate" if you've already paid through the year. 

I've yet to find anyone with proof that after paying for an annual plans they got another bill I'm order to continue using their subscription. 
A standard screening where I live is $13.50, or $19 for IMAX. (One of the largest cities in the US)

I went to 2 movies. I went with my GF on the first. So that's 2 tickets at 13.50. Or $27. The other time was a matinee with a friend and I only paid for myself. That ticket was just over $10. So as I said. $35. 

And it's for 2 movie nights. Worth 2 tickets each. So in your market it would $28 for your premium night and $18 for the average of standard night. So with SiNEMiA you would get your IMAX for free with the subscription I mentioned above. 
Are you really going to act like that and copy/paste my post?

What I mean to say is that I find it really inhumane way to talk to someone. And everyone owes each other more than that
My first question would be if pihole is set up as the only DNS option. 

Look I'm not trying to argue that you're probably more knowledgable than me but when the actual helpful part of your post in in an edit at the end of your post and when people reply to you saying good bot it shows that your post immediatley reads as disengenious. I'd much rather see knowledgable people treat those who don't one a one - one basis and not like a child. 

Hopefully of you made it this all you already know it's not a complete solution. I know everyone doesn't. Doesn't mean it's okay to paste a response that doesn't solve their issue (just "for-their-information").

I'm glad however you do continue to follow up. And don't just leave the thread. That would be much worse. 

I'm just trying to help out another redditor that he may not be as helpful as he intends to be. Which we are thankful. 

Editing for spelling and clarity. 
I get it. I do. 

But if I were OP I'd still feel like you were a dick and didn't read what I wrote.  

Edit: I mean to say it's patronizing. Especially when you just go and copy paste when it's potentially helpful. 

Not when it is helpful. 
Okay. Are you posting this in every thread today? For real?

Edit: not quite. Only 3 in the last 3 hours. But has other copy/paste quotes which seem to only tangentially touch on OPs problems. 
I just read that thinking WTF after seeing "final solution"
So like 30-40$ or 300-400?
I'm not convinced this is his official profile. He has zero connections. 

That being said everyone knows he was previously against the EPA before taking his new job. 

Can I ask how much you paid for your SiNEMiA sub?
Try searching your problem but specifically "after updating" I've seen others on Nvidea forums saying similar things over time. I don't know of any were actually founded though. 
How come you have never posted in the SiNEMiA subreddit?


Is there a reason you have a 2 month old account and only post in this sub?
I figured. Thanks for your help earlier. 
Are you dense?

That's a monthly plan. 

I'm talking about plans that are ***billed annually*** *upfront*. 

What you are saying is after paying more than $200 they sent you an email saying, "so uh yeah, you're gonna have to pay these next 9 months at full price. Here's another bill for an additional $150."

If you only had it for two months and then had the option to cancel it's monthly. Unless you have proof that they refunded you $150 after you canceled. 
Download Kodi and see if it plays. 

That would eliminate whether Plex is the issue or hardware on the Sheild. 

And I'm assuming it does this to all 4k H.265 files? Are they 10-Bit as well?
I have researched and I haven't found anyone providing proof that they paid for entire year in advance more than $200 in this case and have them billed again in the middle for a process hike. 

Which is why. Asking for proof. 
Which plan do you have?
Bad bot
Didn't explain why you didn't photograph your work
It'll probably more likely to flag you if you regularly sign in on your phone ***and*** hers. 
Be careful about using your account on mutiple devices. It can be flagged as fraud. If you are only using hers now you may be more or less okay. 
And you paid for a year in advance? If so, can you prove that somehow because that conflicts with what I'm hearing elsewhere. 
Thank you. 
And this is for annual plans? Not where you just "next month in advance"

I couldn't find anything about the promo expiring so thanks for that. 
Thanks. 

The only other things I would add is I don't really care for seeing anything opening weekend. So if I have to wait a week because of the dumb 30day limit. That's okay. 
How do you mean? My understanding of that is if you pay month to month. And at that time all you had to do was cancel and sign up again with a new promo. 

They only offer annual now. And as far as I've seen with the new plans they lock in the price all year. 
Yeah but they only offer annual plans now. 

Deadpool and Jurassic and Mission Impossible I think are also movies I'd be interested in seeing in Dolby. Without SiNEMiA I probably wouldn't though. 

So you might recommend just paying a second MP account? With a 4 movie restriction? 

What about dropping MP altogether, and switching? I'd see only 2 movies a month but that's still enough to see the best. It's a shame I won't see a few hidden gems though. 

In currently see 3-5 a mo. 
>Are seeing movies in IMAX or Dolby Cinema format worth the cost for you, or are you perfectly content with regular 2D? Or do you care for 3D movies in any way?

I don't care much for 3D myself because I have a lazy eye and can't see 3D, my GF would benefit. I care more about Dolby Cinema and mostly miss seeing those. Although I wouldn't otherwise pay for one every month, I'd basically uografe a movie I'd be seeing in standard in MP to IMAX. 

>Does Sinemia cover the theaters MoviePass does not?

Their website seems to be broken on mobile and I can't confirm the single theatre by my work. I agree, if this theatre doesn't take it it might be a deal breaker from the start. 

>Also, your GF should probably sign up for at least one plan...

She just moved states to live with me and currently working one part time job. So I'm paying because I have the income and that's okay with me. Potentially, I would even buy her a sub to MP if she was interested as a gift. Because that's nice to do (and could save me money) but that's my own decision - this thread is about the services. 


This is also keeping in mind the current MP offer is for 4 screenings a month. But on average I do go only once a week. 

Potentially if SiNEMiA is good enough I would potentially drop MP. But I might also keep it because I pay month to month and isn't a ton of money to have it just in chase. Since it does pay for itself after a single use. 
NPR EMBD also has a fantastic podcast segment called Trump Stories. 
My baby. MotoX2. 

I went back to Samsung (Had S3 -> MotoX ->MotoX2->S8 Active)

I got it for half of ~$450 and it is also tryle an amazing phone with a 4,000mah battery. And suprisongly coming from stock experiences for a while Samsung does add some value with what they bring. 

My battery got so bad to. Always had a portable one with me. 

I still miss Moto actions though -.-
Technically selling anything over Reddit is against site-wide TOS according to the most recent updates to policy. 
A degree will essentially purchase a network to the tune of several thousand dollars. And would also allow you to get experience in an environment where it's okay to make mistakes.  So there are benefits. 

But you can always look at getting into it later. And keeping it as something on the side will also keep you from experiencing burnout that alot of on-the-fence people feel early in the careers. 

Early on you might meet more snotty people who think your less for not having a degree but once you've established yourself and are knowledgable that should all go away. 

And I have a B.F.A from a theatre conservatory, which is almost as far opposite as you can be from my advice. 


I did traveling for a few years. Now I'm starting to settle. Did summerstock for 4 years. Cruise ships for 2. 

Now I'm looking to spend some time where I'm at and see if Grad school is going to get me my next step or not. 
Then I would go to a university for one of those things. And then see if there's a way you can get involved in your schools theatre or film program. Either through electives / classes or a local community theatre. 

People in the industry come from all over. It's okay to have a degree in something else if you want to pursue theatre later. 
I don't like mashed potatoes. 

What's her number?
Since no one has asked yet I will. 

Is there anything else you really enjoy doing?

I always loved theatre and turned out I was pretty good with all the technical stuff so it made a lot of sense for me. I never considered the financials too much (as far as yearly earnings) but knew it wouldn't pay as great as a doctor/lawyer/architect etc. 

I now work full time at a regional theatre near the bottom of the ladder, in my 20s. I'm happy with the pay but it's not quite enough to support a family on which is something I'm only coming to terms with now. But when I went to school I was never really concerned with that and everyone was supportive of me doing what I wanted / was already noticably good at. I wouldn't have changed my decision but some counterpoint back then like you're asking wouldve certainly helped. 

And while moving between gigs can be tough, for me personally I was never out of work, but I know that's not everyone's story. 

When it comes to debt, of you're getting a degree in theatre try to be debt free or close to it. Spending a premium on a theatre degree isn't always worth it because the experience matters way more. 
Sure. And you're speaking of when you're at school right? Not now?

Because that's the point of multiplecation tables. So you *didn't* end up writing 7+7+7+7+7+7+7+7 = 56
This is all fine. 

If I asked you today what any multiple of 1-12 is could you do it by heart?

And your example is exactly why OP of this post finds Core so weird. Because it's not necassary to break apart numbers so small, but helps with larger ones. 

There's no need to use that method under 12*12 because the pattern is easy. Go larger and use your base 10 strategy. Doesn't mean you don't have your multiples of 9 memorized this instant does it?

No one, or at least me, is saying memorization is the only way to learn. 


Edit: and your example is also only applicable for 11 & 12 in this example. There isn't really a shortcut for 7*8. 

Besides things like 7 * 4 * 2, but that's still memorization.
I just saw your username. This is no longer okay haha
Okay... What's the problem then?
How do you "actually solve" 4*4?

4+4+4+4. Right?

By now, you just know it's 16 right. Off the top of your head? Yes people actually memorized their times tables. Just like you have surely memorized them yourself by now. 
Aren't you trying to play the video though?
As far as I can tell the left is a device selection for casting in general, while the right is a menu for SmartView and that's why it only shows one option. 

Cast = Google
SmartView = Samsung

You evidently have a TV that supports both options. 

What happens when you use the youtube app and not the website. It might be thinking youre trying to mirror your browser (SmartView) instead of sending media (cast)

And speilgen means reflect (or mirror) so I'm pretty sure I'm spot on. 
Exactly. Although you can add 6 & 5 in the same step.
So they misread the mandate when they had sex with kids. 

Ohhhh.
President of Kenya for example. 
Short Answer: It's not  

I don't really understand how your picture relates, isn't that a screenshot of you casting?

I can't read the language or understand when the two screenshots were taken. 

I have Oreo and casting is as easy as clicking the casting icon in top right corner while connected to a device/network. 
I'm not diagreeing with that point. 

I'm agreeing with scartissue that Netflix doesn't have the same reputation it has for TV. 

And then the next guy saying the Movies in Theatres are the same as this in Netflix. I.e. subpar. 

My comment is to point out at least in the eyes of critics they are not the same. Netflix has much better TV shows than movies. 
Okay. But being rich still won't make him a red hat. More to the tune of affluenza. 

And your last statement hardly makes sense and instead comes off just as hate. 

Not saying people don't have a reason to hate that man. But ***again*** you are combining his actions with those on the political right. 
Hey I just wanted to say your post in well formed and thought out but unless I missed something we still don't now the motivation of the Vegas shooter. So please stop spreading misinformation. As it appears being factual and rational is important to you. 
It's still not really kerning. It's just missing a space. 
Okay. But his point is Netflix doesn't have nearly the acclaim to any of it's movies that it has for a single TV show. 
I will say you're right in pretty much every example. But there's equal importance on the role that parents play when regarding raising someone who will be beneficial to society. 

And it's their ultimate responsibility to prepare someone for living in their own, while the education system should help and provide tools - especially in the instance the parents are unable. 

TLDR; it's not just education, it's the parents too. 
I find the rounding up part interesting there. Because if you always round the the lower tenth then you can add the singles separately and never bother with substraction. Especially because it will always result in changing the tenths place again. 
So are you saying you don't know your multiples up to 12 by heart?

I guess it's fine to not have actually memorized them in school but now that math should be so simply to be instantaneous. 
So is it just missing a space?

Sure. But since he's asking w/o root I imagine he means like custom. Or raw ttf otf type stuff. 
Woah dude. That doesn't change my point at all. Okay stubs only for 5$. 

>I'm saying if the amount charged doesn't match the expected price of a ticket it *can* be flagged as fraud...

This would *corraborate* my point. Undercharging for a ticket *may* appear as fraud as it *doesn't match the expected cost of a ticket*

And OP has said many times he's not a stubs member / did not use account (despite that likely being what happened somehow) still means it has the potential of being flagged. 
And guess how much a ticket costs at that theatre on a Tuesday? 

$5

I'm saying if the amount charged doesn't match the expected price of a ticket it *can* be flagged as fraud because the computer thinks you're buying something else. 

Edit: because then on Tuesdays I can have a second MP account and buy popcorn in it every day with my movie purchase on my first card. The expectation has to match. 
Yes. By finding an font in apk format that adds it to your options in system settings. 
That's not true. It can be flagged as a fraudulent purchase. Basically it'll appear to MP as you buying something else for $5. Benefit is that it will still ring up as a charge from the theatre but it might be mistaken for concessions or some other product. 
I'm sure there are substratum themes that might do white icons 

With my setup the dark notifications are the source of the most problems. W/O theming dark Gmail as well for instance will produce the subject line of emails to be unreadable. However it changes to white when expanded. Dumb. I know.

You may not be Russian but you are a troll. 

You think Moore was falsley accused. 

You said you were white and privledged and in another post say you are bisexual, black and your gf is Latino. 

You are pretty crtical of transgenders calling them out for playing the victim and saying the T is ruining LBGT.

You clearly have a bias for the right and while you seem intelligent in your language all the things you are defending are not moderate principles but some of the farthest talking points, Moore, Ingraham, Alex Jones. 

Please help me understand why someone apparently in the LGBT community would defend Moore/Trump? Help me understand you as a person and not a fool with a 2mo old account with negative karma on every post. 
Some stuff is substantial, but most of that's already been reported in the press. The only thing The I thought was odd was Trump asking about something and whether it was Nunes. 

For all the people that he could mention I thought it was odd but we don't know what they were talking about. 
Anyone else getting this notification? Persistant and won't go away, opens to Google settings for web search, accounts etc.

I would but I would need premium showings, I'd also easily pay 15 or possibly 20 for it though. 

Keep in mind the higher it moves the less likely I am to turn around and spend on concessions. 

Right now I've though I actually see around 4 MP movies a month and 1 outside (and taking my gf with me to most who isn't on MP) I pay $10 a month as a see-a-movie-whenever-i-feel-like at almost anywhere I'm close to.

BBC has reported the same if you're concerned about the source. 

Companies are saying they weren't aware of these other rules and fully complied with customs and was was okayed by customs and has never sold to a black listed company. 
Hey. This is really cool. Thank you. 
Damn. Exactly. And that's a ton of private information.

I've known several redittors to regularly make new accounts to keep the accumulation of info scattered. Like a digital shredder. 
It's also important to note that cookies and scripts are still tracking you. Just having a tracker from FB in your browser and scrape what sites you visit. Even if you never shared them or liked them. 

Then there's also having any affiliated programs even installed on your devices. 

And there's an instance you used OAuth with your Facebook login and anything you do there or associated with the third party service. 

And then there's Google. 


Idk. I would like the answer to this too as it's the same for me. Doesn't seem to affect performance at all, but constantly says low singal over ethernet
I guess not. The search has changed. More animations flashier etc but not white or center screen. 

But my Spotify is also really weird. I had the full screen album artwork when playing songs for a few hours on two separate occasions.

For real, this thread is bad enough just identifying kerning. I don't expect them to care about the distinction.

Hey. Thanks alot. I'll check it out. 
My problem isn't them being black. It's the notification text is the same color as the overlay. 

So are you saying you don't have any of those issues in the notifications with your theme?
Yes?

I didn't see that fine print before.

Googled: "Product Sans Samsung S8 Apk"

First result. XDA

I have the second gen. What I explained above immediately restored functionality be to my remote. 
It's a bug in later updates to the Sheild. If the battery dies completely once it's charged again there's alot of funk in detecting the battery level. 

It'll show up in settings bit won't control anything and the light won't turn on. 

It will work while plugged in though. You have to reset the cache on Bluetooth share and restart the Sheild after resetting the remote. 

But it seems like you found another way to shock the system. 
Yes, I did. 
I'm using the Andromeda back end
Oh yeah  I forgot I did that.

It's Products Sans, the font from the new Google phones. I found an apk on XDA through Reddit that added it to my font choices in system settings. Although the same apk didn't work for other GS8 owners so YMMV. If you are curious enough to look back in my post history up to six months ago you might find the link. Or some GoogleFu on your own end. 

For what it's worth despite the font still being rendered in my system since the Oreo update it disappeared - currently doesn't have any font selected. 

If you can't find it let me know and I'll see if I can find some time to help a redditor out. 
Thanks. It's pretty silly how it doesn't work but the moment you expand a solo notification it's white again. 

Might just go back to White notifications like I had when I was still on 7. 
Where is that option?
I tried with themeing Gmail but in multithread emails it leaves a massive white block at the bottom. 

And there's less visual cues between elements. Subtle grey bars between emails are removed without ansark substitute. 
Does anyone here use Substratum? The theme is Swift Dark. I already went to /r/Substratum but the community doesn't seem very active. 

S8 active on Oreo. 
How many crypto subreddits do you read / buy? Golly. 
Do I have to use the dark skin for Gmail in order for this to show correctly?

Because the dark skin shows blocks of while after email threads and doesn't look all that great.

Thought this was going to be a level headed article. Ended up just being inflammatory editorial. 

I'm not diagree either the author but this is poor Journalism and a vilely biased website. 
I'm not a content creator but you can use AutoCAD to setup an isometric skeleton before exporting into anothrr program for art.

I don't see what the difference is loading it into a browser on your phone. It's still navigatable (for what there is) full screen. 
You said they work for six months straight.
Then someone else said that wasn't true. Then gave a 22 week  stat.

Which in it's own right is pretty close to what you said.

Then I elebarates the difference between the two stats he gave and that in reality a contract on RCCL for someone "working on the shows" is 6 months and 3 weeks. 

And you do work every day.

So I'm saying you're about right with your original comment. 

Unless he's speaking as a performer, but he should also specify that. 
It's not really a correction. 

The first number is for managers or 4mo on 2 mo off. 

The second is staff. Or 6mo 3 weeks on and 6 weeks off. 

You do work every day. 

Also a RCCL former employee. Also working shows.

Oh man. Windows widgets were the dumbest things in the world IMO from a design standpoint. Rainmenter was cool because it allowed to to also retheme your desktop almost to the point of looking like another OS. I used that along with dock programs like Rocket Dock and maybe another program from Stardock. 

But then *rainmeter* was getting to resource heavy. 

Glad seeing them still around though. 
Woah. Rainmeter is still around? I used it maybe a decade ago. 
Well there certainly is a style. And an art designed ***for*** isometric projection. 

And you low poly trees are all at different angles and directions so any sort of wonky projections that would come from taking a normal 3D scene to ISO is hard to find. That and the scene is open for without really any vertical line to register the isometric degree axis scheme. 

But really. Did you just post in a sub you've never even looked at before...
I don't know man. I can't tell it's isometric really at all, is this just a 3D perspective scene rendered with an isometric camera?

It's probably because it's been massively popular for years especially for people circumventing geobased Netflix content. It was just an extension that worked for people and got passed along.

At this point you're forcing me to be pedantic since it seems we don't understand each other. 
The article doesnt say that though. It says according to the NRA those funds did not go to the election. 

I bet they still did but you can't omit the last three words of the quote for the title.

Holy crap this title is misleading.

Of course they may still have done something illegal, this title suggests though they've been caught guilty.

But okay

Sure. But not sure what devices really can't. 

Maybe your Blu-ray player? Cheap smart TVs?

Your Samsung Fridge I bet. 
So what you're saying is the show ended. Or the entire show happened with the last look frozen on stage?
While this makes setup easier and more seamless this is not a requirement though. 
I think this is from Amazon sending emails to real people and soliciting responses. Older folk then don't know they aren't responding live/direct to someone. 

Plus trolls
Which I stated. 
I have a pihole set up which I've set up to block all adds on my home network. It works off of IP addresses and domains via DNS. 

If this telemetry was hosted from separate addresses than ciritical functionality (if any online functionality is actually needed) then you could set up a blocklist to stop this sort of traffic. 
I don't think most people find small hands to be a very demeaning thing. It just so happened that it got Trump worked up and became it's own thing, specifically on regards to him, but then starts to leak out a bit too. 
Yeah. Shiny confetti star. 
He also was against the Fox News Narrative after Kushners lies about who was at the Russia meeting in Trump Tower and when Judge whatever-his-name said Trump was surveillence be Obama at Trump tower. 

"Fox News cannot confirm, repeat cannot confirm..."
From my router its plenty fast enough, I have a 4tb Seagate. Not all routers will spin down the HDD when not in use though so that's a downside if you're worried about it constantly running 24/7. 

For me data transfer over the network isn't that great tho 3mb/s so copying a 3gb movie to it is a bit slow, so a lot of times I unplug it and do maintence with it plugged into my desktop. 

Alternatively you can just leave the drive on your home computer as long as you have a wake-on-LAN wireless/ethernet card - you're whole computer would be running though. 
I'm betting it's not a city proper and is reffering to his neighborhood and surrounding commercial buildings. 

Like strip mall buildings and stores each with their own parking lots. 

Not "downtown"
This definitely gets posted a lot, I would try to find some ild threads. I had issues so often I just plugged by HDD into my router instead. 

If you have a NAS why isn't the contents of your Ext HDD there too?
You don't drink, people respect that, everyone still has fun. 

Not everyone is even going to get drunk, you might not feel as comfortable at all crew parties, but it'll come down to how extroverted you are and you might choose to leave certain events early if you find you can't quite socialize on the same level. 

If you turn 21 while at sea though it'll be a big deal. 

And yeah the position is called cruise staff. You'd help set up events and some even host. 
Well for starters there's apparently a flaw in how they protect data and then there was the two years FB knew about and did nothing to notify the users or fix it. 

They are equally responsible for the situation.

No they didn't "steal the data" but yes, they are in part responsible for the data being stolen. 
If you're out-going you can try for cruise staff on RC, you'll definitely be in the minority age wise but I've had underage Co workers before. 
I contacted support
Yep. Had mine replaced in U.S. under warranty. 

Also doubt you could find them cheap. I think they released a retail version that was at least $100
To be fair though there are people holding literally right now that might not ever see a return higher than what they paid. 

It's kinda making the argument that these ten people have contacted cancer, however none of them are dead. Well sure they aren't dead *yet*. Just like the people holding now haven't actually lost their money yet *but surely some will*

And in all cases the user used an ultimatum in saying everyone which just plainly can't be true. 
I'm wearing 511 right now and I'd agree with this analysis. 

Slim and Skinny are both different cuts, and 511 is definitely the former.

You might feel that but literally every economist will diagree. 

Diversity gives a healthy financial relationship. Plus they may have to compete with others who sell others, so to attact their loyal customers they might need to offer similar services. 
Thanks. I already got it. 

He's using a hypothetical "I" when all he needed was to use the reality of "she" instead. So I was just confused. 
Gotcha thanks. He could just say she though instead of I
I'm not sure if you're trying to make a joke. 

But it almost sounds like you're complaining that you make 25 grand a year while barely working, and that's easy so...

While there are people who work 2 jobs and 10hr days for half that.

You asked:

>You made $10/hr as a manager? What did the regular employees make?

I said (Regular Employees) make closer to minimum wage or $14,000 before taxes. 

I didn't answer the first question because I was not him. 

Then you said 

>I just assumed a manager would be paid more than minimum wage

Which means you implied to say that either $10 is minimum wage to you or you're talking to me about manager wages when *I have been talking about regular employees*. 
Quick settings are the toggle buttons on the top of your screen. But If I'm understanding this thread correctly it expands all of them. Not just the top row. 

As if you swiped down again, or hit the toggle button where it was in the top right corner to show them all in version 6.
$10 isn't minimum wage. 

$7.25 is. 

Federally. 

Edit: I'm answering your second question. I cannot answer a question about something else's wage. 
Sorry you're getting downvoted :( people must be bitter about their gas prices. $2.19 where I live. 
Are you from America?

They pay probably something close to minimum wage. Or $14,000 a year before taxes.

Well that wasn't the point I was really making and you could be correct in your last statement 

But. 

Personal data has always been the product of Facebook. And this quote shows that it was known from the earliest stages possible that the system was made to collect information that people willingly have them. 
I think it's over messaging. This is a very old quote. Possibly around the 2000s. Also pretty sure it's on Wikipedia. 
I'm not sure if annecdotal stories are allowed here but I knew a guy in college like this. Restaurant kids menu was all he ate. Chicken tenders everywhere. And things like burgers we're always plain. Such a pain when we were out, not every restaurant offers chicken tenders. 

And he'd ouright reject trying new foods. 


Was a friend of mine though. 
It does relate to how the phone is almost identical to the others and probably won't get the update until later.  

More trying to point out how a more expensive flagship is given the backseat. 

Edit: and how in the case of VR capabilities it pretty much comes down to the device manifest not being on a list of "compatible devices" and has zero bearing on it's actual compatibility. 
I just want to say that it's really fucking stupid that the Active isn't supported by daydream. Isn't supported by ARCore. Isn't compatible with Samsung's Gear VR etc

All because I wanted a good phone that wasn't going to break, had a better battery and I hate the idea of the edge. 
Reread his comment.

Hey. Can you add a link to the original comment?
But you can't use a third party encryption service even if you wanted to in good faith to prevent Russia. 

Communications, even classified must be archived so that FOI requests can be made, Declassified ion at later dates, investigations etc. 

There's also a distinction in private non profits etc and the actual government. 
This is also particularly interesting after the case indicting that encrypted phone company for working directly with drug dealers/criminals. 
O.o

No. You're the one not making sense. The articles you linked claim that he *may* have a conflict if interest but he spoke to his supervisors on how to proceed and everyone signed off that he was A-okay to work. 

You ***may*** argue that you can't just waive away a conflict of interest regardless of preemptive moves. 

You ***may*** argue that you disagree with the FBIs A-okay or that their sign off was equally made from bias. 

You however. ***Have not*** made these arguments. You just posted links which clearly go against your own statements. 
No problem. You're still going to want to find the cause to uninstall it though.

I have a 2014 Nissan Juke and it bounces, naturally it'll probably depend on your car but it's not necessarily because your shocks are bad. 
He actually says Trump is a third-party. Not the actual party to the agreement. 

>"...he's a third party beneficiary"

Because the LLC is evidently the party. 
That is a solid point. But we are talking about how the other side sees things. And they don't see that the same as you or me. And instead *only* see the speculation. 

It's important in strategy to understand your enemy and that in order to win you have to convert them, and alienating your countreymen are not an effective strategy. 

People do need to be held accountable though. I don't have a solution but it's something I'm very aware of. 

And I'm mostly reffering to the literal "lock him up chants" and "impeach chants" on this sub. They're based in good reasoning but the constant chanting in the face on an going investigation I think is kinda funny. There is still the notion of innocent before guilty. 

That said still. It is evident he isn't *effective* and that should be enough to impeach regardless of criminal wrongdoing. 
Well I think it's more that you can't actually check them if you aren't in power. 

Otherwise all they can do is yell and throw a fit.

I see a lot of speculative news coming out of the media and the right is asking, okay but where's the proof? And sometimes they're right, a lot of the news around the Mueller investigation has a lot of connections but as of what's released to the public is ~~coincidental~~ circumstancial, naturally the real meat won't come out until indictments do and then the trial. So I understand a lot of average peoples frustrations. 

And that's how you get people on the right yelling you're an Alarmist. 

Again I'm on your side, but would appreciate a lot more moderation, especially in this sub where there's a lot of very heavy language used. 

Edit: alot of people in this thread are going to have a very rude awakening in the chance Mueller doesn't indict Trump. Which I hope he does. 

But that's the day people hopefully wake and and realize their chanting is identical to that of Fox news during Obama.
Idk but it would appear the printing is different and has a different picture on the front. Maybe regular and GOTY edition? Zero clue. 
But these "preferential rates" would be based on load though right?

Not if you're using X amount of power to run 1,000 Ovens you get a cut. 

But if you're using the power to refrigerate we're gonna make you pay a premium. 

You can promote a certain type of business before they decide to put up shop. But the moment an industry decided to open up and sign up for electrical they cant police whether that power is going to a toaster or the coffee machine. Much less whether that coffee machine is making a demanding espresso or just drip coffee. 

Am i wrong?
Okay, but not all jokes are appropriate. 
I'm not trying to argue but just want to point out that like in PA, running moderate denocrats might be the key to getting as many seats as possible. Going on the extreme offensive will only polarize people more similar to what happened to Obama with Fox news. 

You're good to point out that developung policy is important. Like this bill. 
Was just talking about this show with a co-worker two days ago: https://strangebirdimmersive.com

I work at the Alley so I'm not able to see many shows since they're all at the same times. But I've heard good things. 
Claiming Orthodox Jews as neckbeards is pretty inflammatory...
She worked for Ivanka after. Then Trump. 
It's just an example. I'm not actually saying they should. But that response night be better than a flat "fix". 
Nobody can know that. But she could have written something else. Being my point. 

If I need someone to do something over and I've explained in detail in person I don't then continue to write "do it again". 

I feel your just being obtuse. The only thing anyone is going off of in this thread is the picture and OPs comments. 
That's a really good point, looks like I got a year wrong with my math. I'm not able to find that much information about her there but her father and grandfather were also sizable names in PR, so she's been around it her whole life. 

I'm not saying she's qualified for *the white house* but the notion that she doesn't have any *qualifications* isn't fair. 
In the case of Russia I think you're conflating Trump's administration versus himself. The UN ambassador is doing great with the recent Gas attack. However Trump only said "if we agree with the facts" and then today via Sanders said it was "up to russia" if we are friends of for. 

Criticism of trump is fair however flowerty. Clinton, obviously. And Obama might have been naive about Russia, as of right now I feel history is going to show that Obama should've spoke louder and pushed harder instead of backing down during the election in attempt to not interfere, or do something unorthodox. 

China's interesting. The president has done a lot for China and is quite popular. They only got rid of limites which gives him the *potential* to be president for Life as of right now. That doesn't mean they can't get someone else later as long as he doesn't continue to consolidate power. Mostly a hurdle which would ordinarily block autocratic gvmt is removed and should be monitored carefully. 

I'm assuming you mean treating N. Korea as a close equal on the world stage? I was mostly calling ot the hypopcracy of claiming negotiations won't work *while* undermining his top diplomat and then in the same week of him being fired agree to negotiations. 

My main point in TPP is whether you like it or not, in the event that everyone else agrees would it be better to still agree and have a say as to *how* rather than isolate yourself economically. 

Right. Like your small business. If he wanted to give tax breaks to them I'd ask where to sign. It's the fact that the massive corporations don't even have an incentive to trickle down etc. Some of course do, but others like Wells Fargo walking away with a 35% raise for their CEO. 

And the case for middle class it's clear that it doesn't favor them because individual cuts expire while the corps are permanent. Well have to see if the individual get renewed. Otherwise people are going right back to paying more (some, depends on situation obviously)

Unionization is a whole other ballgame. I just want to say in the current climate that's not really all that easy. Great to see the teachers doing it though because they definitely deserve it. 

Main point about deficit is that it's a large cornerstone of the GOP ticket. 

I think your argument about wasteful spending is good and those examples I don't think or really debated for either side. 

On the case of tarifs. While it still remains to be seen. Why not just tarif China. Why the hell is hey starting a trade war with Allies? 

If mirror tarif is what it sounds like it is then I can get behind that. 

As far as the total Economy what specifics has Trump done to boost it? As far as I can tell it's been on the rise for a while. Not arguing it was Obama but for this conversation why is *Trump* the factor. And let's say before the tax plan for an example. 

And it looks like you post ran out. 

I want to say that I appreciate you taking the time to talk. Again. Super reasonable argyments. Thanks. 
If my kid did this to me I wouldn't dismiss the kid. I would re-explain my position. It's not manipulative to understand logic or as a kid fail to apply the actual intention of the author. 

The thing wrong with parents is when they dismiss children for honest thoughts. Or pull the because I'm an adult card. 

That's not to say children have to defended by parents in teacher meetings when the child is obviously in the wrong. 
Well I'd be curious to the actual age/grade the kid is. And I'm not promoting recognization. More that the teacher is short in her reply. Understandbly she may have a lot of work. But she can reply "Funny, try again" or "reread the instructions" etc. Sending back Fix is not the best way to teach IMO. 

But also nobody had the internet in the 80s and the frequency of these posts don't mirror the vast majority of parent or even teachers. Some may not even be real. 
Just wanted to say that OP elsewhere in the thread points out that this assignment is one of many where the instructions were the same but chose to color only this one the same. 

It's clearly not manipulative for a. Child of this age. But it's also not because the instructions were unclear. More or less it was to be humourous. 
This is a good point and is why this won't fly if you're in high school. 

But if you're learning clocks and crayons your situation doesn't really apply nor is that the purpose of this assignment to a child of that age. 
Different guy. 

I'm not even upset at the assignment. It is just coloring clock, and understanding analog versus digital. 

I'm mad that instead of understanding the miscommunication or finding it humourous themselves. He/She wrote back **"fix"**. 
Hitman. Don't know which one
This shampoo bottles look like synthetic oil logos. 
To be fair. Amazon is hardly a moral corporation. 
And it's important to note the privilege if the parkland Students. The reason why this shooting had so much more attention was because this kids came from an affluent neighborhood where they are getting a good education and took civics classes back in *middle school*. 
And I'd also like to say that I'm only asking you want you think are the good things because Its obvious the media only reports the bad (and in this case the bad is *really bad* most of the time).

And I'd like to get perspective from someone who I can tell in their post history is reasonable, who backs their opinions on their own experiences. 
1. Uranium One is a conspiracy. Fox news even debunked it. 

2. McCabe has been found by the FBI of handling the email investigation that he should he fired. 

Clinton didn't gut the while goddamn state department. Clinton wasn't chosen over someone else because she was friendly to Russia and could lift sanctions. 

Clinton can go to jail for all I care. I didn't like her much before and thought she was a terrible candidate put forward by the DNC. But one thing is certain is that she was hard against Putin. The only lasting effects her email server is going to have is how people keep bringing it up, Rexs decisions will have large and sweeping effects. 

Not to mention people in Trump's own administration use personal emails for work and a good portion of his staff can't even be cleared for security *to begin with*. 

I'm not here to defend her though, I think she's hollow, Rex definitely has done more damange in a singular year. 
No. I literally just said after getting Pomp would I ask for Rex back. No. 

I'd ask for someone else entirely. 
>Hope Charlotte Hicks (born October 21, 1988) is an American public relations consultant...

Serious questions, please respond to as many as you'd like, you seem reasonable and would love your perspective.

What about his foregin policy on Russia?

What about his policy on N. Korea undermining Tillerson that negotiations wont work and then turn around and agree to meet days before firing him?

Does the Paris Accords fall under foreign policy?

What's your take on TPP? Would agreeing to it just to have a seat at the table still be worth it?

My problem with the tax cuts was it was suppose to be for the middle class. And every week up until the end it was obvious that it benefited corporations magnitudes more. And continued to say how much it's for the middle class. All I wanted was honesty. If you want to give corps a massive cut to stimulate the economy, I'm perfectly okay with you doing that thinking it will help - I'm not okay being mislead about who it's for. 

What's your counter argument to the massive deficit now after the cuts? How are we going to fund the $1 trillion+ infrastructure he wants? 

Do you expect he's going to shut down programs through attrition before saying "look, they're ineffective?" (Like repeal and replace)

How can you applaud his economic policy when he was completely on the sidelines for the GOP tax bill? And then days later release his budget calling for way more spending?

Can you share with me what things *you do* like about his foreign and economic policy?
Can you tell me more about Rice? She was before I kept such close tabs on politics. 

I can't imagine her impact to be worse than Rex as we will have to deal with the staffing Exodus for a decade or more. 
I don't think she's *that* unqualified. She came from working in PR. 

It *is* strange tho how she never actually spoke though. 
That'd be a just under 5% raise *if you were working minimum wage*. 
I'm not a huge fan either. But at least she didn't dismantle American diplomacy and soft power in the world be leaving the door unlocked for legitimate facists. 

She'd be more like the current pick for SoS Pompeo who should be focusing on diplomacy when his whole career was about creating regime changes worldwide. Not a match for a job but at least doing something which some people approve. I have no idea what Rex has done that's worth applauding besides the free moments he spoke out against Trump. 
I don't think I'd beg for Rex back. I'd be asking for someone else entirely - if I were to beg. 
I'm sure you've already read quite a bit but incase nobody has mentioned: in a unprecedented sanction against WF for their recent actions they are not allowed to grow as a company until reforms set out by the courts are followed. 
Rex was on the right side of policy issues (Paris, Iran, Russia) but is possibly the worst secretary of state in modern history. 
Do you know if it works with Kodi?
I laughed at the grammar. 

But shield has Google Assistant which can control Hue though. 

How can Hue match the TV for lighting if there's no Android TV app?
Hue entertainment was an update to the Phillips Hue app to sync in screen content like movies with Hue Lights.

Reminds me of the Joe the plumber was saying Obama was bad for Isreal. When pressured my Shep Smith he essentially said he wants everyone to get informed and find their own reasons why it's true...
I don't really think that was the case. 

This election in PA will happen again in Nov. Seems like an inordinate amount of focus for a single six-month seat. 
Isn't fathom by definition not available through MoviePass? Or is it only my theatres that charge another buck or two for Fathom?
Thanks. As a kid I have fusing problems and such so my eyes were working together albeit poorly when I was young. Since my brain just shut one out I no longer have any "issues" with my sight. So that would be interesting to see if a prism would work like it did with my brother. 
What is the retraining process like? Are there limitations to your activity? Like driving?
It's interesting you mentioned prismatics. 

I have a twin brother who has the same condition but his brain coped differently. He continues d to having fusing issues etc. 

My brain decided to reject one eyes signal almost completely. So it would seem in any situation in regards to retraining the brain my twin brother who still wears glasses might be a better candidate than me with 20/20 vision (although independent)

Quick question. How different is seeing in 3D after the surgery? Who did 3D movies look?
I guess the only question I would have is what are the odds the brain can be retrained after the realignment? What kinds of tests can be done to determine that?

I've already had the muscle shortened in my eye as well if that makes a difference. 
Right. Which is the reason I asked the question on who is an applicable candidate, as I believe there isn't actually anything that can be done for my situation besides what has already been done and making a more concious effort to use my non-dominate eye for tasks. 
Yeah. Sorry. The "and" in my original comment meant that my coping mechanism was in addition to. 

It's nice when I do find other people. There's normally a small handful of people on threads that involve eyes. 

Growing up o could watch 3D movies in Blue, or red. So glad poloried movies come out. (although now when I look at someone else wearing them I see right through on of their lenses haha)
Sounds just like me haha. Had the muscle surgery when I was tiny. Still some turn. Eyesight improved with glasses over the first 18 years of life so I no longer wear them. 
What kind of surgery? Not Lasik I'm assuming.

Was it muscle surgery?
If it wasn't for M. Kelly's massive fuck ups when she left Fox and her poor ratings she might be seen in a higher light too. 

She also rebuttle hannity when Trump was touting him whether Trump would ever call on real Jornalists. 
That's the medical terminology for a lazy eye... 

Strabismus: Disorder in which the eyes don't look in exactly the same direction at the same time.

Amblyopia: Decreased eyesight due to abnormal visual development.

The first refers to the physical situation, the second is a cause due to the brain unable to ultilize both eyes efficiently.

Hopefully you've been to an opthalmologist and received a diagnosis and are not learning about your disorder for the first time but only in name. 

The name has no bearing to how your brain decided to cope (eg. Being able to pick)


From what I've seen in the past I don't think so. 

I think it's pretty dumb tbh
Yet Sheppard Smith, the only major journaist I know by name there since Kelly left actually has no college degree. But has worked in Journalism for decades. 

Somehow he's the voice of reason over at Fox. Too bad he's only on in the middle of the day. 
Meanwhile Sheppard Smith who has worked at Fox news *since it opened* keeps the midday spot where occasionally conservative viewers call for his firing, to go work for CNN, for biased reporting. 

>“Sometimes facts are displeasing, Journalists report them without fear or favor.” 

*Sheppard Smith, of Fox News in response to Hannity calling him "anti-trump" after a rant.*

Sheppard was also the only one to call Kushner's Russian meeting in Trump Tower saga lies.

> We’re still not clean on this, Chris. If there’s nothing there—and that’s what they tell us, they tell us there’s nothing to this and nothing came of it, there’s a nothingburger, it wasn’t even memorable, didn’t write it down, didn’t tell you about it, because it wasn’t anything so I didn’t even remember it—with a Russian interpreter in the room at Trump Tower? If all of that, why all these lies? Why is it lie after lie after lie?

He went against his own netowrk when they claimed Trump was under surveillence  by Obama at Trump tower.

>Judge Andrew Napolitano commented on the morning show Fox & Friends that he has sources who say British intelligence was involved in surveillance at Trump Tower... Fox News cannot confirm Judge Napolitano’s commentary. **Fox News knows of no evidence of any kind that the now president of the United States was surveilled at any time in any way—full stop.”**

He also debunked Uranium One. 

> "The accusation is predicated on the charge that Secretary Clinton approved the sale ... She did not. A committee of nine evaluated the sale, the president approved the sale, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and others had to offer permits, and none of the uranium was exported for use by the U.S. to Russia. That is ‘Uranium One.'"
Hey. What kinds of disorders qualify for this surgery?

I have strabismic amblyopia and my brain has developed the ability to pick which eye to look out of. Essentially I can pick on demand, call it an ambidextrous lazy eye, would my brain plasticity be a problem for a surgery like this?

I no longer wear glasses, my twin brother however never developed this ability and continues to wear glasses as he had continued problems with fusing vision etc. 
Both were reported. I think the guardian reported the higher number if I recall correctly. 

But the case if the door, it was six doors. Three pairs of French doors and all labor costs to update a historic building which is part of an ongoing system of updating these buildings. The doors were so bad they they were leaking water and one even had cardboard attached. They said the price still seemed a bit high but is a far cry from the other examples. 
Bookended means on either side. 

>one of two things occurring or located at either end of something else.

And if you're going to talk about a text post, that means it begins and ends *in the same way*. 
Bookended means to start and end with. This didn't start with it. So it wasn't bookended. 

This was. 
Bookended? Because he didn't use it correctly...
Still getting unexpected error. 
Don't see how you can call me a hasbara troll when I've ever once even said Isreal...

You've only made ~30 posts in your account life. 25 of them are this week in /r/politics.

You account is a year old but only recently started posting and coincidentally at the same time you've only received downvotes on *all* your posts. 

Definitely a bought account. 
Nah man. It's probably because your spiting conspiracy and "psy-ops" about a website takeover. 
I just want to point out in the doors one that it's 3 sets if French doors with all the surrounding costs incuding damage made by the previous doors in a historical building.

They did still day that seemed pretty high but it's a far cry from these other situations. 

That rennovation is part of a larger system of updating the old buildings, water leaks into the building and part of one of the doors has bardboard attached to it. 
Please don't jump. You want to live. 
Come on. All olive is is basically "for what it's worth". Just because you like what a particular article says doesn't mean the source is reputable. That's all.

Yeah sure. This article is legit, but olive is only trying to provide *more context* which in my opinion is always good, and so is the other redditor pointing out that this article is written by someone specifically covering U.S.  

Point being. He's not freaking arguing with you. He's just provided information, geez. 
Yes. And you can also still play on classic servers. 
>a Jew broad

>What are you a faggot?

All you post in is in AM radio subreddit where the hosts have been fired mutiple times related to misconduct and racism and tried to create a TV show that they even admitted was "too graphic for TV". 

###and there is is. Posts in T_D

Edit. 

/r/opieandanthony is 85% of your posts. 

/r/the_donald comes in and #2 w/ 9%

In your top 5 words are "shit" "black" and "fuck"
I think most people are going to disagree with you about the music comparison paragraph. Or at least in as much as that it's the same all all art forms. Music. Movies. Art. Games. Etc

They all invoke emotion. They all inspire in different ways to different people. Each one is given the opportunity to affect your life for your entire life. 

And it's obviously biased because you used to make music yourself. Naturally a game developer is going to have the same feeling you have about music, but about games. 

I'm not the guy you've been replying to but I do see you being reasonable in at least the way you're communicating. So I'm not downvoting you because I disagree, but upvoting you the way I think Reddit should be used - to share amongst each other civilly and contribute to a conversation. 
I just want to point out that articles may be leading with a similar angle but that will be a far cry from actually showing them (if the exist) or disseminating them. And while blurred photos have been shown in the past iirc any news agency should certainly think twice before doing that to a sitting president, much less promoting the disgrace of the office. 

It would be downright un-american! (Only partially kidding)
Jesus. No reason to be rude. 

I assumed (wrongly) you were speaking from experience and not playing devils advocate. 
So you carry a gun because retired old folk are too interested into what you're working on in your garage, because they think they're just being friendly?

What does having a concealed gun do that situation? Why is a gun a remedy to that situation? Idk. This just doesn't make sense to me. 

I can understand a degree if it's some homeless or a stranger in your backyard but all you really have to do is yell at them, at the most just say you have a gun or that you'll call the cops. Just don't get why you have to actually carry. 
>since everyone has a gun everyone tends to mind their manners

Wtf

1. My first thought before approaching someone has *never* been, "Do they have a gun"

2. Since when does having a gun on you force people to behave? 

3. What kind of shitty person are you to be only well mannered just because they might draw a gun / shoot you?
Is that like the Stockholm syndrome of movies?
If you're at home and your carrier supports wifi calling then just turn off your cell receiver. 
And if it's a whole row of cars? They should what? Yeild and go 50 on the on ramp waiting out the lane?
I know it's not in your title and may not be a sjtiom you're looking for but I use PiHole on my home network to block everything. 
Yeah. And on/off ramp connects to the feeder. 

No you should be able to tell what city. 
Probably because no one really wears mullets since the 90s. 

Except I guess for MAN...
Lol. 

I thought you had one of those bay apartments/hotel watching ships leave. Once the camera started to move I was like *"what the hell is going oooon"*
Is that what y'all call the highway?
I'm not saying anything you found isn't true. But Crayola hasn't published anything as to who they are. This one company did so on their own end. 

There could be other companies who also published that they are partners but first you have to find them. And second they may not publish that anyways. 
Guy from the rent is too damn hi memes. 

I guess a politician
I think one point the guy who you replied to  is that this is only one potential partner. Of which there may be others. Especially in the opportunity to replace this company when they stopped. 
If it's a modem/router combo you might need to Cascade your own router in AP mode. 

I have zero experience with Google. But I had to do this with AT&T. Although my issue was that is wasn't resolving any DNS. 

Your web login will show devices even if they are not being activiley blocked. It's more or less just a "what other clients are in this network". 

If you didn't configure your gateway to use the pi for network DHCP or configure each device to refer to the local IP of the Pi as it's DNS what you're saying is happening will happen. 

TLDR: on that device, what happens when you point it's DNS right at the pi manually?
What does it say when you type *IP addr*.

I'm willing to bet it does have a local IP. Something else is wrong. 

Does it show up as a device in your router settings?
That's only made from the scalps of a dozen eagles. 
That's fair. Im in Houston and the situation is probably pretty similar but I'm contracted for ever show the season, and any extra hours I move to the shop. 

For the true overhires upstairs I bet it's the same. 
Well sure. But you aren't given a contracted date to return. Have to find work elsewhere, don't know how long until they need to bring you back on. 

It may not be as long as I fear, because I've never worked there, bit I'd have a much better sense of security working under different circumstances. 
Another user posted 7 min before you so idk if you saw it but he said he had worse battery life than on N and had system app crashes. 

Was fast and a joy tonise but not daily driver yet. 
O.o

Curious if you use your phone for work all day.

I bought the S8 Active because I hated the idea of the curved edge and the larger battery. Heavy use for me and it lasts all day. Although I plug it in for my commuye and get a few extra %. I could easily go 48hrs with less use. 

Sounds like you would've really benefited from the active. 
Best of all *everyone* is speculative in this thread
I'm thankful for the help. 

But as I said I got it working. 

My gateway doesn't allow reconfiguring the DNS for the whole network. And my router doesn't allow  it either while in AP mode. I have to manually set each device to look at the Pi. And that's okay. 


Laughing at you getting downvoted for reasonable speculation, wow. 
That'll Definitely resolve the DNS while making sure the pi never works. 

I did get it working last night. 

I think my gateway was rebinded IPs on the way out. Set up another router in AP mode with cascading settings and everything is cool now. 
Okay. Fresh install. Pihole is online. And can ping. 

@ 192.168.1.99 this time. Static.

Same problem. DNS doesn't resolve on the devices. 
Uh. You're not understanding. 

It does already loop. So why have it loop three times per loop. 
I had to load the HD version of the thumbnail to see it. 
I don't know why but after just reading the title this popped in my head haha
I think it's more about that eneding scene and the sound design that makes this movie really great on the big screen. 

But I'll show it love on the little ones too. 
What did the trailer spoil? And did you still see the movie?
To anyone who's read the book Annihilation (what the recent movie is based on) flesh caves are very unsettling.

Well I took a tour of the facility in 2015 and their shop and know-how is impressive. As an intern it must be worth the experience I'd imagine. 

They were working in the tour of Matilda and a West Coast Duck Dynasty show.

My friends who is there has been with them for 3-4 years I think so he must like it and he started either as an intern or got lucky pretty close to being out from college. (this is all assuming he keeps his social media employment up to date). 

From the way Hudson explains how they hire is that it's always based on workload. And they literally fire/hire the same people as/if the workload gets light. So whatever that means for security. 

And as I'm sure you imagine they get a lot of applicants. 
I have some alum friends who are there now.

But what are you asking? What the place is like? How to apply? Is one offered?

I don't have much info bit if you could specify you might have a better chance getting someone to answer. 


And at that point the simulation genre game stops being a game. But an honest to God war simulator, most likely equivalent to what would be used to train actual soldiers.

Makes me think about people who play flight simulator who are already pilots and play it with %100 realism. 
Thanks. 
Thanks. 
Okay. You're misunderstanding me. I am not saying there's an equivalency. I'm not defending the right. I am certainly not critizing the left. I'm would be a Democrat. And I *did not vote for Trump*. 

I'm saying this whole argument if whether I like a policy is because it's leftist or on the right. Based on that fact alone. 

That we should be more nuanced and careful about the systems we use to describe things and the innate ability to promote polarization instead of moderation. 

IMO the right is far worse than the left in the U.S. < ... but such statements promote us versus them dehumanization and disllows room for nuance. 
Thanks for the info
Awesome thank you. 

Yeah this post was made after all I've been seeing lately are articles about Dana Loersch, Kelly Anne Conway and Anne Coutler. Who I'm okay saying that I feel they are vile women. 

Trying to get past a bit of media bias for the extremes and too a more moderate viewpoint for counter argument. 
Thank you. I'll research these names. 
Thanks, I know I didn't say it but I was looking for U.S. policies. 

Are they considered right in their own countries or still when compared to how the U.S.s scope is slightly more right then Europe's. 
Well so is saying that facism and communism can really exist on a left/right spectrum that's designed to function in capstlism.

I'm just trying to promote a view that doesn't create polarization *by implied design*. 

Extremism is bad. So is Genocide. It's not a left or right political issue. It's a *human rights issue*. 
Yeah. I thought about her but I find her tone completely incendiary. Just like extremists I feel shes half-purposed to get a ride out of people and mirrored in who tied into she is on social media. 

But you're right. The viewpoints seems to be pretty run of the mill. 

Are these other Congress women making public statements that are simply being looked over?
Thank you for posting this. 

I just pointed it out myself. Way too many misleading emails about this is /r/politics. Since the memo and parkland misinformation the subs been a bit better. 

I'm against this administration as much as the next "liberal" but in the everyone to research a complete understanding of these issues and not to bandwagon after the incident about the HUD furniture. 
This is going to be the last time I point out how misleading this while thing is and not at all like the HUD situation. 

It's for three pairs of French doors. So actually six doors. 

It inclides the entire job - that's also labor and restoring the damage from the old doors in a historic building. And part of an existing effort to update these houses. 

They did say yes, that seems still a bit high. 

I don't know if they've looked further into it. 

The note with the cost says Secretary Door iirc which is why there's all this outcry. Please have a complete nuanced understanding of the issue before you rage post about how the president paid off Stormy Daniels. 
Seeing a lot of news about Anne Coutler, Dana Loersch, Kelly Anne Conway etc. Which are the other major voices who are women on the right?
Can't we all agree its a horseshoe anyways. 

And instead if arguing which side of radicalism it is can't we all agree that either extreme is bad...
I can't say anything for actual technicalities *but* if you used it public facing and directed traffic to it you absolutely can use it for nefarious purposes. 

Unless someone corrects me I'd say it ultimately comes down to how it's being utilized. Like it's only poisoning, if well, poison is involved. 
I laughed after they supposed bump stock bans and when it popped up in Congress they were like "woah easy there" I didn't mean law. I meant regulations, which we control. 

And then it took a nosedive off the agenda even when it seemed like everyone wanted them banned. 
Eh. Idk if that's the right word. 

In any case I worked in entertainment and worked between 180-230hrs a month which wasn't bad, and I'm also a workaholic. 

However. The compensation is only equal to a 160hr work-month on land for my job. Maybe a little more since room and board is provided. In no way am I being compensated enough when over the holidays I was working 275hrs...

But I was out of school without a lot tying me down so it was still a great opportunity and would only recommend it to people in similar circumstances. 

From U.S. if that matters for people reading. 
Can there be some requirement on this thread to list ingredients?

Much less instructions and complete recipes? Is there another sub someone would recommend for meal prepeable recipes?
At least on RC most contracts are for 300hrs a month. Or 10hrs a day. 
Definitely one of the better. Although I might put the focus line further up to center. Not the very bottom of the photo. 
Active. 
Actually it did show that. But I swear it wasn't there for. Third time doing a pihole -r so *shrug...

Well it still doesn't work and won't pinklg out. Also during the reconfigure it can't download any of the block list sources. Which it didn't have a problem on the very first install. 

Might try redoing the original image...
Okay. It doesn't show the /24 then. But I'll give that a try. Brb. 
How do I remove the /24? It did that on its own. 

In my router admin it only shows 192.168.1.100. 


Sorry about that. 192.168.1.100
Running *IP addr* on the pi shows me the IP for the device is 192.168.1.100 as the static IP as that is what I've set myself for it being static. 

It reads: eth0... Inet 192.168.1.100/24 brd 192.168.1.255.

I have tried setting the DNS to the second address but things still don't resolve. 
I see you no longer have the box to Smash Bros. 
And? 

That's not snow. 
Where the fuck did that window go?

Also. Why speed up the framerate. 
It also wasn't for a single door. It was for three sets if French doors. The demo, installation, labor etc in a historic building. 

Yeah. That shits way to expensive. But this headline is also misleading. 
Is all snow wet?

I'm seriously asking. 
That's gonna be interesting. I haven't seen any kind if actual character acting from him. 
> *The King’s Speech* director Tom Hooper and Dafne Keen, the breakout star of Marvel’s *Logan*, have signed for the big-budget adaptation of Philip Pullman’s fantasy epic *His Dark Materials*.
Dude. Yes you did. You replied to post showing it clearly at a retail store with MSRP then claimed Nintendo increased supply which would imply that there are units to go around and there is no need for price gouging. 
If he acknowledges it then she might have to shut up / be offered more money. 

But if he doesn't acknowledge the deal from ever happening she would be off the hook. 

It's a win-win-win for her now that what information has gotten out has.

It's vsryging degrees of loss for Trump and or his lawyer. 
I don't know of any proxies. But there's plenty of chrome extensions that spoof your IP.

Aloha was one that was popular a while back
Maybe they took it down when the one build was pulled?
That's a sweet paper cup. 
Could use a VPN or proxy. 
The Reddit link was in a thread showing two matress firms one block from each other. And the outlet style store across the street. Naturally this was a particular location but it literally as bad as a downtown Starbucks. 
Can we stop posting the same arcticle on /r/politics 12 times a day? Just link to the NYT's article. 

Serious question about this and others:

Is there any moderation that happens in this sub?
I only caught the end live. Got best actor, actress and director. Suprised me on Movie. I'm happy for del toro but surprised. 

I also restrospectively got best supporting male actor. He popped up in one of the clips and I was like "he got one surely, right?" And yup. 
And if you're worried about the source but trust the guardian to also pick it up... In 2007.

You should raise the back face of the fry container. 

And it might look better compositionally if you but the fries on the side and just partially went in front of the burger. Would also also space on the drink for any advertising. 
Okay. But have you *ever* used the pool or seen any other crew members?
On RC it's *Cruise Staff*
The problem is they don't always split it by half. 

Say your ticket is $8. 2 for $16. 

Moviepass puts $10 on each card 

The teller maxes out the first card like it's a prepaid card (spoiler: it is).

So that's $10 on one and $6 on the other. And pops up as fraud to MP. 

This is just a possible outcome, there's zero reason why you cant each approach the counter separately to avoid anything accidental from happening. 
If you're referring to behind the scenes meaning theatre etc on RC it's a different position than what youre looking at. 

That would be event staff and that is literally hosting events like you suggest. 

If you don't have professional experience in technical theatre or a degree you wouldn't be working backstage. 

On RC though Cruise staff *do* operate flowspots for production shows. Which of your English is good and intelligent it's not bad bit I've had a lot of bad followspot operators. 

I really don't blame them though because I don't expect them to be good because it's not what they do. But at the same time all you have to do is keep the spot on the actor... 
I was a stage tech but it'll ultimately come down to your individual Cruise Director and Hotel Director to how free you are around the ship. 

First off you have to be staff. Not crew. 

Use the guest gym
I was able to eat in any reastaurants. 
Sunbathe on deck 13 (MJ only)
Pizza Buffet late night (MJ only)
Solarium Cafe food after hours (SR only)
At my rank k could order a drink from schooner Bar (but 20% off guest prices is still way more expensive than the crew bar)
On SR we could walk around out of uniform in smart causual with ID (essentially the cast dress code. 
Technically I think we could also join any dance type class although I never did. 
Would hang out in the pub for latenight comedy

That's with guests present and always subject to occupancy. 

There would be all crew parties in the secondary lounge. 
Arcade Parties
Open Sports Deck nights. 
Crew climb Rockwall maybe once a month. 
Crew open restaurant for those w/ privileges. 
Mexican reasursnt open after hours for crew once a week. 
But it's going to come down to your crew welfare specialist. 

Never anything like a pool or sauna. Advise from not using guest elevators as well. They just aren't controlled /monitored environments. 
No Rockwall and definitely no pools. 

As entertainment staff on RC I did have access to the Guest Gym in addition to the crew gym. 

They will host crew only Rockwall nights and arcade parties etc after hours. I've never heard of anyone with access to the pools besides training. 
Telemedics was already provisioned for under the Net Neutrality rules. 

It's just as easy to extend that to autonomous cars...
Actually don't alot of laws let you purchase the day before legally? 
I'm not saying you shouldn't have posted what you did. In fact you cleared up the miscommunication. 

But you *appear* to be saying you only like 4 movies in that time. And I'd recommend you edit it *for the sake of clarity*. 

Jeez
Then I'd recommend you edit your original comment. 

Besides blankly saying it was a bad movie, it's probably why you're getting downvoted. 
You literally just said that only 4 movies were worth your money. 
Your sentiment is nice. 

But there's no reason to restrict imagination to children. 
Depends on how long you've had the card.

And it also is a ton of time "wasted"

Depending on your region if you've had your card for 3-6 months as far as movies you actually liked, after that point you would have saved money by not having MoviePass if you only went to movies you actually thought were good. 
Change your network connection from auto to manual. 

And if I'm not mistaken the Cellular at Sea is turned off while I'm port. 
Well text is the only way you can communicate over Reddit. Something I was more than willing to do starting a conversation. 

After your last comment I thought surely a T_D user. Quite surprised that it seems to be the opposite because your ettique is atrocious. Not surprised that analytics has your post history at a 48% kindness factor despite your contraversial rating only being 7%.

There's zero reason to be so rude. 
What. You can't say "like I said" to new information which is contradictory to your last belief. Nor to a sentiment you have not already expressed. 

Plus. I'm not? I wasn't even arguing until now, I was just letting you know his ending wasn't so much his decision (like Ex Machina) as it was the Author of the book's doing. 

I thought the movie was quite well done. And although they changed most every detail including some of my favorites I thought what they chose to adapt was handled quite well to make it suit a movie format better.

But I think I know your opinion of the movie now. Jeez. 
You don't have to read the book. I'm sorry *you* don't understand. 

My point was this is not the directors decision like Ex Machina as much as it is *the source material*.

Has zero to do with someone's interpretation or enjoyment of the film whether you've read and or seen it. 

And infact I would advise against reading all three books before the movie as I felt it inhibited the enjoyment. You might get away fairer by only reading the first book (it's also rather short edit: and is the basis for the movie). 
Movies can be as equally open ended as books.   Saying that it's not great for movie goers doesn't make much sense. 


Seriously tho. 

***Allows*** 

Not requires. 

I'm all for hating Konami and this entire trend of micro transactions. You can however use in game currency. 
In terms of the women that how the book is. So it wasn't any kind of affirmative action type of casting. 
4/52 sounds like you're losing money paying for MP. Not to mention your apparent wasted time...
To be fair. The book which is a part of a trilogy, is equally as open as the movie. Even possibly more so because you're able to explorer an individuals experience from the inside (metaphysicaly). 
You can also easily assign colors based on their location (opposite etc) on the color wheel
Is that seriously a requirement of this sub?

I get why. It's so someone doesn't sensationalize an article which wasn't already. 

But that's where you need to look at the effect of rules and how that effects moderation. 

I don't think I've ever seen a direct mod comment here either. They could easily punch a misleading flair or another sticky. About two weeks ago o saw some of the /r/politics mehathreads about the memo and thought I'd subscribe because it had alot that world news doesn't. 

But there is a *ton* of /r/politics on my front page now and while I am on the left alot of the he stuff here is almost as bad as T_D.  I think I just need to find a heavier moderated sub. Any suggestions?
Hey. I'm not trying to mean but this is not tilt shift. Nothing about this is even remotely close. And while you *can* have title shift in B&W when's it's traditionalally saturated colors, there is no linear blur - I can't even tell if it's radial. And the blur transition is *way* too strong with a super odd focal point. 

This is just a fucked up photo .

I'm sorry. 
Anyway to roll back? Looks like whatever method or files you used fucked you up. 

Have you done any factory reset / cache reset since?

Do you have the latest play services apk? Thinking there may some disassociation in the app link. 
I'm aware. But just like all the bad news from either side. The headlines are enough to muddy understanding and often misinforms a large group who only read the headline. 

I also love how I'm getting downvoted for complaining about obviously misleading titles. It's still bad - don't get me wrong, it just *as* bad. So I don't understand why the title has to be that way. 
Thank you. 

Really debating from unsubscribing to /r/politics for all the misleading headlines. 
There actually are quite a few out there. 

Betterhelp and Talkspace being the most known IMO.

I did also just see anyone pop up in the last couple of months but I fogot the name. 
Plot Twist: I am an American!


Eisenhower is also in the record for being 100% against military parades as they glorify the role of the presidency in only the way if his ego, makes the country look like the Soviets and China (fscist, commie) and signals to the world the wrong message of peace (especially in peace time)

He was a freaking General. 

Trump whines and wants his parade now.

At work. Go to Daily Show YouTube account. Scroll recent. Should be in the first dozen. 

His in person interview with Tomi is also worth a watch. Noah is trying so hard to understand her. The interview is from 2016.

You're right in pointing out his rhetoric is incredibly similar.

Thanks but it's definitely a movie. 
I think it's considerdbly older being it formed a phobia for her. 10-20 years ago. 

But I will bring up the Mist movie although I don't think there were butterflies specifically.




IANAPA?
>ARCore is Androids SDK for Augmented Reality, 
I'd still do it. We also have tabs running bot sides so if you didn't raise them they'd get in the way for everyone. 
I m seeing a lot of negativity here in the thread and of course any company will make it seem like the deal is bigger than reality, including flubbing the original MSRP. This will not be true for the most expensive watches though.  

I don't know about Invcitica, but brands like Tag Huer, Rolex etc every sale mist be reported to Headquarters and they are only legally allowed to be sold down to a certain discount. 

Secondly for large sales the onboard shops also have to compete with Port shops as well.

That's still not too say they a ship won't be selling a watch at a discount which is also largely discounted elsewhere on mid range and lower. 

Personally I have bought a few watches from Cruise ships, Fossil, Citizen and a $950 MSRP Bulova watch for $460 months after it came out. 

That would also be with my employee discoint. 
Bingo. 

At my theatre it's also all automated so it only takes like 30 seconds.  I'm assuming OP has someone flying every linesets manually. 
Which is why I call out subs and small communitues. 

It's only when all signs point to bot that I can safely call it that. 
Gotcha. Thanks for the info. Unrelated to the supremecist group. 
But you see. Those are *immoral* personal freedoms. 
I've seen the videos. My comment is only in regards to the second half of your comment about the recent shooter
Well there was a hostile takeover in '77 IIRC which changed the message, mission statement and leadership. 
I understand what your saying but the last thing I saw was the the sheriff said they found no ties to supremecist organizations and even the one Reupublic of Florida or whatever backpedaled their statement saying there was a misunderstanding of the names of it's members. 

He was still found with footage of shooting a BB gun in his backyard while wearing a MAGA hat. 
Specifically though if you think someone would be a bot just check their post info. See how old the account is. What subs they post in and whether or some some of the posts seems like trivial personal accounts or posts in local / small community subreddits. 

In other terms *does it appear this account has anlife outside posting conservative talking points*. And yes they don't have to be conservative. 

However alot of others are people or trolls and if I see people posting in T_D or use Reeee of Snowflake I just move along. Ain't worth my time. 
Oh great, thanks. I did a search before hand but I must of missed it. 
Hey guys. 

Just came across this article today and thought it was a short and sweet opinion peice that calls out a problem that I was really only made aware after somehow stumbling into this comminity several months ago. 

It's also a good intersection of masculinity and the perpetration of violent crime by men, as it calls for everyone to use feminism as an inspiration to encourage similar conversation within other communities. 
Woah. Didn't know there were anti-immigrant Canadians. 


Didn't the NRA recommend restrictions on buying bum stocks after Vegas?

But then when they went to Congress NRA was like "oh. I didn't mean legislation, we want regulation from agencies we've captured"

Today? No changes have been made. 
If someone can find it NPR just did a long form investigation of your exact question where many funds were still being used to this day for **decades** after the campaign ended. Many were used for personal expenses and kickbacks. 

Here's one arcticle.

I remember a longer length podcast however. 
Went to Black Panther this afternoon for a 12:00 show.

Yup. I've done thinner foam core before as well. I also had tape the edges for reinforcement.

Hey. I'm not really sure why you deleted your last comment. 

And I'm not really sure what you're looking for in this conversation. But I hope you found it. 

And I wanted you to know that if you did want to continue the discussion tomorrow I'm here to answer anything.

If you no longer want to engage, say so and I'll leave you alone. 
I never said your first point wasn't true. It was all Russia backed. Rosenstein specifically mentioned the Pro Bernie in the indictments this week. 

I am not personally offiliated no. 

But if the organization releases a point of view *it is the view of the organization*. That's how it works. Sean Spicer at the Whitehouse is not making personal remarks. He is speaking *on behalf* of the WH as a whole. 

No one is disagreeing that there may be people in the IC that disagree. You are arguing languange semantics. 

*It is the official stance of the organizations which as a whole make up the intelligence community*
Edit: his post stated Trump believing Putin did not do it is not the same as him not actually have done it. 

Sure. Which is why I provided context that this was immediately after the IC stated on the record it *was* Russian. 

Him saying I believe Putin is directly contradicting the fact that he should already know it was him. 

The context matters. I have another quote after you address the context. 
This is one example. Also already posted several times. 

>“Every time he sees me, he says, ‘I didn’t do that.’ And I believe — I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it. But he says, ‘I didn’t do that.’”

>“I think that he is very, very strong in the fact that he didn’t do it. And then you look, and you look at what’s going on with Podesta, and you look at what’s going on with the server from the D.N.C. and why didn’t the F.B.I. take it, why did they leave it; why did a third party look at the server and not the F.B.I. — if you look at all of this stuff, and you say, what’s going on here?

>“And then you hear it’s 17 agencies. Well, it’s three. And one is Brennan and one is whatever. I mean, give me a break. They’re political hacks.” 

The first sentence is contradictory. To many previous statements he's made in person. 

Those comments I've shared numerous times already. 
This isn't the point that started this thread but it's what you're asking for.

I think it was Vix who made a video about the Fox & Friends feedback loop.

Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections

Jan 6 2017

The IC is completely against Trump's tweets. 

As I said. The tweet I posted he only said May not have done it. Any more absoliye you have to look eslewhere. I'm sorry it's not a tweet. 

>“Every time he sees me, he says, ‘I didn’t do that.’ And I believe — I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it. But he says, ‘I didn’t do that.’”

>“I think that he is very, very strong in the fact that he didn’t do it. And then you look, and you look at what’s going on with Podesta, and you look at what’s going on with the server from the D.N.C. and why didn’t the F.B.I. take it, why did they leave it; why did a third party look at the server and not the F.B.I. — if you look at all of this stuff, and you say, what’s going on here?

>“And then you hear it’s 17 agencies. Well, it’s three. And one is Brennan and one is whatever. I mean, give me a break. They’re political hacks.”

Here he is favoring Putin over his own IC. Calls them hacks. 

The veterens *in which* make up the intelligence community may support Trump as you suggest. 

The IC does not. Full stop. It is not the official position of any organization in the intelligence community that it was not the Russians behind instilling dissent. 

###Trumps official standing that the Russians did not interfere with the election is at odds with the IC. Based on their own publication of a joint statement in October 2016, a declassification of the report on Jan 6 2017 and a reconfirmation during Congress recently. 

This is a fact. If you would like to make the argument that the IC refers to all the individuals and not the official stayemts of each org. You can. But that's obviously missing the point. 
I've already shared this article.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/us/politics/fact-check-trump-russian-meddling-election.amp.html

It gives ample evidence.

###I'm sorry it isn't in tweet form
I already did. 

I posted them all. 

You replied to them all. 

We have discussed all the ones you were interested in discussing already. 

There's literally no more information I can give you. I don't know what you want. 
I gave you one tweet and one verbally spoken video about Russia May have done it. Which is a contradiction to him saying Russia never. It isn't absolute. And I conceede that. 

None of the others were contradicted by tweets. 

Some of them like about Schiff are misleading, which I explain. Others lack context. 

I gave you an explanation on every tweet on why they are disengenous. Some of them with references to articles. 

You already countered Retribution is not the same as preventive. And I conceeded that too but asked why Trump isn't doing anything preventove either. 

I don't know what else you want. The whole point of this thread is to explain but that in specific context of the President's tweets he is often misleading or contradictory and therefore difficult to gauge by other countries. And they would be better off to continue listening to the rest of the official departments in the U.S. and specifically all white house communications while in the least disregarding what he says in twitter. 

I cannot give you any more than that. But you've yet to disagree on a vast majority of my reasons why I find this to be true beyond the two I conceede right above. 

I tried to stop this specific thread because it was getting convuluted. But you insisted. I resummarized my position in one of those "essays" in attempt to return to real discussion and not semantics . Which you refuse to read. 
Gotcha. Absolutely. I wouldn't say blame them and move on without change or discussion. 

I know Facebook for campaign ads they are going to mail postcard for verification to u.s. addresses. Obviously that can still be circumvented but it is another hurdle. 

Idk about social media in general though. It already promotes a bubble by design. 
I think I understand your sentiment. 

But are you advocating we blame the people for being stupid or ignorant instead of the malicious agents who took advantage of them?

Or do you mean to say there's blame all around and not just Russian?
You didn't even read them, so I'm giving you bite sized offerings. 

Gish galloping refers to arguments without accuracy or strength yet I've given you citations for a lot and the rest is easily researchable. And upon every request I give more information. 

I still implote you to read my "essays" I promise you won't be overloaded. 

It's all written. You can take the entire week to read them if you'd like and respond in line. There's no reason to feel overwhelmed. 
Dude you're not following any logic. I'm not saying the Intel communities are a lie. 

HEs saying even never said these things. In this case he has on mutiple occasions. *Sometimes even I'm favor of the IC*. Which is a good thing (so you'd be right to suggest that's an odd thing to being up in the argument)

My point is that he likes even about things that would favor him. About things that are trivial. He's consistently disengenous and misleading and therefore should be ignored especially on Twitter. 

Its like your complaints about sensationalist headlines. His tweets provide no nuance. 
You are correct. Trump does not always make the same distinction. 

And people are asking literally right now for prevention from Trump. 

They are asking right now for those sanctions to be enforced. Right now. 

Trump bas the opportunity to do better than Obama. Why hasn't he taken any action or even spoken out against Russia?
Math? What math? You said the IC is made of Vets and they support Trump. 

If that's so. Why did the organizations publish these statements and reports saying the opposite?

That IS the math.  Can you ask me your question another way, cause apparently I'm failing to understand. 
Perhaps personally. I'm not going to say otherwise. 

Can you explain the joint statement in October 2016 or the Declassified report on Jan 6 2017 or the recent confirmation to the Intelligence House Committee? 
In regards to Trump saying Obama did nothing about Russia here's a video in his response to Obama placing those exact sanctions. 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8eaV5f3gR_o
Here's Trump saying

>It could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey

http://time.com/4591183/time-person-of-the-year-2016-donald-trump-interview/
http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/06/politics/trump-election-meddling-russia/index.html

Here is a video where Trump specifically says that Russia might have been behind it, or another country. 

This is 6 months after the IC reporting already starting that, Russia is behind it. 

Edit. 

And here's another joint statement in 2016 saying them same.

Your not understanding. It's the tweet that's the lie. The first link in that post calls out more than one of those tweets directly. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/us/politics/trump-blames-obama-and-democrats-for-failing-to-stop-russian-meddling.amp.html

Here is a direct link to *one* of the tweets, is so easy to see them for yourself. 

https://mobile.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/965079126829871104
Thanks for the concern. He's completely obtuse but I do see in his post history that he's tired of sensationalist headlines and unless he's lying, voted for Hillary. 

So I don't really get the pushback. He must however play way too much Eve Online and has fallen into a really toxic environment. 

My comments still exist for anyone to happen by them. Thanks again though, it's nice to see regular people on Reddit   
Edit : my first link was copied wrong. It's right now. 

I'm trying to respectfully engage with you. I hope the following meets your requirements. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/us/politics/trump-blames-obama-and-democrats-for-failing-to-stop-russian-meddling.amp.html

Here is an article which does specifically refer to a few of these. Although I have provided an explanation for each of them. The contents of which are all easily accessible from multiple sources. Any inaccuracies are my own. 

If you are looking for a link to the quoted tweets below. (Which is what you actually just asked for) Please just Google the text, they are direct quotes. 

After reading this I *strongly* encourage you read my post you said was too long. Which all these diverging point I wanted to consolidate my position so I can better explain to you. I'm more than happy to hear your explanations, so far I'm the only one providing information. 


>Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats, lead by their fearless leader, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the 2016 election. But wasn’t I a great candidate?

This is misleading. Adam Schiff said Obama could have done more. Does not mean he is solely responsible. 

-

>I never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said “it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.” The Russian “hoax” was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!

He did when he said he believed Putin when Putin said he didn't do it. Despite his own intelligence community on Jn 2017 saying he did. There are other moments too.

-

>Finally, Liddle’ Adam Schiff, the leakin’ monster of no control, is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something. Obama was President, knew of the threat, and did nothing. Thank you Adam!

This is misleading and an exaggeration. Obama did do something. Here's just one thing.
 https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cnbc.com/amp/2017/06/23/obama-approved-cyberweapons-against-russia-before-leaving-office.html

He also put sanctions on Russia.  Something Trump has failed do due after he signed it into law himself. 

Plus. He now have almost two more years of proof and details about what was actually happening. 

-

>Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $1.7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress, the FBI or Justice called for an investigation!

.I'm not familiar with this one. As I said. It was just a list of his most recent tweets. 

-

>General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!

He's saying McMaster forgot. If he did. McMaster should say so himself. Otherwise he's putting word in his mouth. The second have are asides to other issues. 

-

>Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!

First half is true. FBI did say it was mishandled.  The second half is an assumption, as if the current Russian investigation took away so much resources the FBI could no longer perform the rest of their duties. 

-

>Just like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem, why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn’t want to, and now they just talk!

Dems do want solve DACA. That's a lie. 

Them passing legislation back then. I'm not sure. I'd have to look into it. But that no reason not to do it now. And we'll see where this goes. 

-

>Funny how the Fake News Media doesn’t want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for President. Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn’t know!

It actually goes back to 2013 IIRC. And maybe what he's reading isn't stating that but he's assuming a motive that doesn't exist. I have seen articles over the years that specifically show Russia has been working on this for a while. The last sentence is disengenous because it claims he didn't even know himself in 2014 he was going to run, which I guess is true on a technicality that he was at the moment unsure. But that doesn't actually stop anyone from preparation or speculation, including the Russians. 

And still. He did campaign research I'm 2013, which is a pretty clear comment on his desire. 

-

>Deputy A.G. Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference: “There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.

The is factual. But lacks context. The same day as these indictments another American did plead guilty to Mueller's investigation. The last statement is true, but it doesn't say the contrary either. It's silent on the matter and so should Trump until it's actually analyzed. 
That's a sample of what he's said today alone. To give credence to why he should be ignored. But let's try this again. 


I *really* believe you're a real person. Who may very well be trolling. But I'm going to go on a limb that you just play a shit ton of Eve and only get your news from sensationalist Reddit posts. Which is a *massive* problem. So I'm going to restate my premise. If you want hard proof without your own research I will try, or I'll get back to it tonight when I'm off work. (Which will be post-midnight)

This article conflates top officials as senators, depending on what your definition of "top" official is. In the legislature the only people really above the rest are the Vice President or maybe speaker of the house/majority whip etc. 

With that said. Trump *is* at odds with his intelligence community. Foreign Governments *are* confused with how to evaluate the public statements coming out of America when the president disagrees with his own government agencies in specific regards to Russia instilling dissent, Meddling in the Election and potential collusion. And more generally about how he creates policy over twitter without any back to it. 

Russia Instilling Dissent. 

So many tweets saying Russia didn't do it. He said he beived Putin when Putin said he didn't do it. Therefore Trump doesn't believe he didn't do it. 

13 indictments just went out saying Yeah. Russia did do it. Now he's saying he never said it wasn't happening, it might be China, or some dude at home on his computer. That is a true statement he made during his run, but it's still contradictory to the unanimous report put forward by the intelligence community that later Jan. After Jan 6 2017 (if he was not privately informed earlier) he was made aware, alongside the public that Russia was behind it. 

Meddling in the Election. 

His new position is yeah maybe Russia did do it. But I would have still been elected. Which might be absolutely true. Only no one knows because it hasn't been studied. Neither he or the community can make such a definitive statement. Him doing so is disengenous. He can probably go as far as saying it is unlikely, but that's not the stance he's even taking. 

Potential Collusion. 

Personally. I'm not even sure he did anything directly. As the recent indictments suggest most American parties were unwitting. I'd be surprised if he didn't know it was happening around him though. Like Flynn. Or Kushners back channel to Russia. 

My stance is on this subject is that his logic doesn't even follow. Because it was aware to the world he was considering in 2012 and therefore based on his own argument of not announcing until 2015 doesn't make a whole lot of sense. 

On general policy over twitter. 

Just one short example although there are many: When he announced twitter tansgendered people would be banned from serving in the military. He had not even spoke to the Pentagon about this. And none of the administration work had been started on such a matter. It was latter overturned in court and reinstated. 

With the above said. The nature of his adminstration and cabinet, the amount of flip flopping on policy, policies that don't remain in effect and outwardly flase or misleading statements the world should ignore most specifically, what he tweets. And that any foreign government should listen to the U.S. intelligence agencies public statements over the statements of the president. 

Please. let me know what you need clarification on. 
The main focus was to create dissent in America. That eventually turned to explicit favoring of Trump. 

Internet Research Agency has been reported on their activity as early as 2013. So ***YES*** people were organizing this for that long. 

The logic that he didn't announce in 2014 therefore he couldn't collude. He may not have. But he absolutely still *could*

He's saying it didn't affect the result. Based on what? His gut feeling. This has not been measured. 

To conflate that to no one was convinced to change their vote is wrong. It's *absolutely* possible that changed votes in those swing States couldn't had a different outcome. 
Nvmd. I take that back. O read the rest of his stuff and where he posts. 
I'm literally copy and pasting. Here's your link I already replied to you about. The one about the main point of topic here. 

https://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/964594780088033282?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-9462779772790784643.ampproject.net%2F1518441587106%2Fframe.html

And you asking me to agree to an ultimatum. 

I'm saying in regards to Russia. Election Meddling. Policy Making and the investigation. He is at odds with his intelligence community and should be ignored. 

And wtore comminity means the public statesments put forth by each agency. 
Yes he meant the 2016 election
 Duh. He's saying he couldn't have done something wrong because Russia couldn't have even known *he was going to run*. 

And it fails to completely address that the Russian strategy as being anything other than static.

Trump. Now.

>Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President," "The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong – no collusion!"

I'm not even saying he did do anything. *All* I'm saying is that logic is whack. And foregin governments should really just ignore what he says online. 

He insists the recent indictments claims that it didn't effect the election, that it was only an attempt. When the indictments don't make any indication either way. 

Would he still get elected? Possibly. Although it was narrow in swing votes. Bit to say it *had no effect* is disingenuous at best. 
Idk. I think this one is a real person. Dumn and uninformed. But honest. 
2000: Trump enters the presidential race as a Reform Party candidate and receives more than 15,000 votes in the party's California primary.

2003-2004: Trump begins hosting the reality show The Apprentice on NBC, which he also executive-produces. He again mulls a run for president, but ultimately decides not to join the race.

How to run for president, according to Donald Trump

March 2011: A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows Trump leading all presidential contenders, including Mitt Romney.

April 2011: Amid more research polls indicating that he would be the preferred Republican presidential candidate among voters, Trump repeatedly calls for President Obama to release his long-form birth certificate, questioning whether Obama was actually born in the United States. (Obama eventually complies and releases the birth certificate.)

May 2011: Trump officially announces that he will not run for president.

February 2012: Trump endorses Republican candidate Mitt Romney for president.

2013: Trump forms a presidential exploratory committee and, despite a strong backing from Republican voters, announces that he has no interest in running for governor of New York in 2014.

February 2015: Trump decides not to renew his Apprentice contract, fueling speculation that he's mulling a run for president.

June 2015: Trump formally announces that he's running for president in a speech delivered from Trump Tower in New York City. Almost immediately, corporations and individuals that have partnerships with Trump - including Macy's, NBC and Univision - begin to sever ties with the mogul because of disparaging comments he made about Mexicans in the speech announcing his candidacy.

He says he couldn't be involved since he didn't announce until after 2015. 

I'm at work. And on mobile. They are all easily googlable. 
Are you saying this arcticle doesn't mention that or are you saying Trump is not completely at odds with his own intelligence community?
Mostly that the never said Russia didn't meddle. 

He specifically said he believed Putin when he said he didn't do it. 

He said he didn't decide to run in 2014. There's a tweet from 2014 that disagrees. he tradmarked MAGA in 2012. Thought about a rim even in 2011. 

And still doesn't consider the rissuan meddling wasn't dynamic

McMaster didn't forget. It's not true. Trump is putting words in his mouth. 

But in general it's all his tweets should simply be ignored. They are only blaming people wrongly. And complaining. 

I can't provide you with the entirety of context that's developed Iver the last 2 years. 
Look. If you're trying to say this article is conflating Congressmen as Top U.S. officials I get that. Although that's still a matter of perspective. 

But to say that Trump is not as odds with the entire Intelligence Community is false. To agree with the intelligence community you *have to* ignore Trump's statements. 
This article is in context of the recent news:

Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections

Jan 6 2017

The IC is completely against Trump's tweets. 
Anonymous reporting is the backbone of integral reporting when honest. 

Here's a link to the IC report in January. You can easily find news form last week where they alwere all asked again if they stand by their statements.

Is this article there are named Republicans and Democrats. Other  officials are anonymous, McMaster is named specifically. Which Trump then speaks for him saying "he forgot to mention". 

The entirety of the intelligence community in the beginning of 2017 and then restated last week to Congress is in direct opposition to what Trump is tweeting. 

It goes without even having to say that the president should be ignored on these matters. 
$15 for a standard movie screening? Ouch.

>One diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid provoking Trump, asked whether policymakers like McMaster who adhere largely to traditional U.S. foreign policy positions were falling into the same trap as Germany’s elite during Hitler’s rise, when they continued to serve in government in the name of protecting their nation.
I don't think there's a stigma. 

Or I might just me open minded. If I see anyone wearing it I just think "oh they must be sick and don't want anyone to catch their cold since they're out" or of I'm a touridt attraction and they're Asian I just think they're wearing as a precaution due to the high flux of germs and people. 

I work in entertainment and if one of the crew is midly sick and still comes in they're always wearing a mask out of respect, courtesy, and want to not make the other people sick. 

But that shit sucks y'all. 
I buy the Interceptor shoe from Walmart, if you have access. I'm in the U.S.

It's between $40-50 U.S. and I've met several other people who buy the same shoe as me. 

I typically replace them every year although they could last 1.5-2 years depending on use and replacing the shoelace. 

EDIT: Although for some reason I wear this boot 2 sizes smaller than what I regularly buy for shoes.

You can install any app as a duplicate (IIRC) inside Knox otherwise known as the secure folder. 

It's encrypted and requires a pin or biometrics to set up. 

Within this environment you can log into your normal apps with another account. You'll get notifications while outside it but they will me masked asking you to log into knox to see the notification. 

Unless you want security a major concern with the second user it is a rather inelegant workaround. 
Idk man. Some people would just call it supportive...
Lmao. You aren't kidding. 
Samsung removed stock multiuser support in their build. You'll have to keep them together and switch in-app. 

Or use Knox as a secondary environment.

###Edit: to anyone thinking of replying to this user he is sending profane messages to my inbox and calling me a filthy Trump supporter. I encourage anyone to actually read my post for your own judgement. 

###FuckTrump

###if you look at /u/particularreception comment history as well he continues to spread misinformation about the Obama-Era bill and is also generally not friendly. 
Because the social security financial branch shouldn't be the ones making this decision. 

Because everyday people also suffer from minor mental diseases and put into a criminal watch list. 

Because the law was too sweeping. 

Because *for some reason* its a right to own a gun in the U.S. and that law Trump overturned infrisged on that freedom for U.S. citizens. 

The ***only*** debate to come out of that bill is whether you agree that gun ownership is a right. And *if not* then pass new legislation at the top banning anyone of mental health therapy/institutionalized/hospitalized etc from gun ownership and not the Social Security peeps. 

I hate Trump but he was right to over turn it. And it would of had zero effect on this case or AFAIK any shooter to date. 

Get your facts together and stop spreading misinformation. this is not how we win. Pay attention to the details and the actual agrument instead of these distractions. I'm disgusted that both ABC and CBS both are reporting this and the damn photo the Whitehouse won't release. 

Instead how about. 

Why is it illegal to by a handgun bit not a AR15 as an 18 year old. 

Why is an AR15 in the same category as bolt action rifle. 

Why is a weapon that's dewigned from war and for destruction even be purchasable. 

If it's for recreation (because you aren't hunting with it) why can't it be held only at the gun ranges. 

Why did the parent who took him in knowing his issues and his weapon allow him to keep a key to the safe. 

Maybe the FBI should automatically subpeona the digital account information after threats like this. 

Quit with the distractions and start contributing to a real conversation. 

/Endrant

I'm all for for fighting Trump but your statement is false. Stop spreading misinformation. 
The is a different affair.

I was told by someone once that because the coil is under constant intense pressure that if it gets hit the spiral can explode outward with a release of pressure/tension. 

Just wanted to know of there's any truth to that. Only got to see a minute of the video but it doesn't look like anyone is physically near these spirals. 
Uh. Both Wired and Mashable put out articles today. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/mashable.com/2018/02/15/russian-bots-twitter-florida-shooting.amp

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wired.com/story/pro-gun-russian-bots-flood-twitter-after-parkland-shooting/amp

Funny how it's tech companies and not the rest of the news reporting this. 
I m so frustrated with today's news. 

Top story is also about Trump overturning Obama legislation preventing mental handicapped citizens from buying fire arms. 

But it's misleading. The overturned bill allowed the Social Security financial arm to declare people who received benefits through a third party due to their defficiency in handling money to be added to the criminal background database. 

It was sweeping, and opposed by many leftists watchdog groups. It wasn't their place to say and was unlawful. It does however being up the issue on whether gun ownership is a *right*. Which in this case the argument was made in favor. 

If it's not a *right* then the legislation has a lot more freedom just to ban anyone with a handicap from ownership. There's no reason I can think of that a downs patient needs a handgun but the law was overturned because he has the right to afford the ability to do so. 

More so. Mentally handicapped people are way more likely to be victims of crimes rather than perpetrators and authoritative and supremecist cultures are way more at cause of these situations. 

But people are spreading it for Trump Hate™. 
Reply. It also isn't true

>The Leon County Sheriff’s Office told the Tallahassee Democrat on Thursday that they knew of no information linking Cruz and the Republic of Florida, raising doubts about the group leader Jordan Jereb’s claims. “We are still doing some work but we have no known ties between the ROF, Jordan Jereb or the Broward shooter,”

There's a ton of crap is this subreddit that is misinformation. Clean it up mods. 

EDIT: From the independent:

>A representative of the Republic of Florida named Jacob Jered initially told multiple outlets that suspect Nikolas Cruz was a member, though later in the day Mr Jereb undercut his previous claim with a statement saying there had been a “misunderstanding” due to his group having multiple people with the same first name.
###To everyone is this thread saying he was in a white supremecist group:

From the same website. 

Somebody who knows more. Please link me. Until then stop speading misinformation. This is not how we win. 
There's a TON of misinformation going on with this bill and it makes me angry. This is not how we win. This clickbait journalism is coming from both sides and overloading people who are actually trying to be informed. 

It's now being reported that his Instagram account has a photo of him with MAGA hat. But the article I was given talked about a twitter handle. And there's a TON of fake profiles already where people re uploaded the photos. I don't find it unlikely that it's true but so far I can't even find a legitimate news source to confirm. 

At the same time when FB told people pages they followed was legitimate Russian take news FB users attacked back for censoring pro veteran news, completely missing the fact those articles were written and paid for by Russians...

Disinformation is rapant and so is ignorance. I don't know how long we can keep going like this. The problem is that it starts at the top with Trump, and casts a mirror into the rest of society. 
I'm on your side man. Nor am I advocating a side without science based facts. 

I'm saying in context of this argument you're saying that mentally handicaped people do not shoot (they get shot - victims) and thought that was a weird way to present a point.

I absolutely agree that they are more often victims *in other crimes*.


Having anxiety makes you more likely to be shot over confident students in a mass shooting?

EDIT: I am not agruing against the facts. Only pointing out something I thought was funny in the language. See my explanation in my comment just below. Ease the brigade. 

I was being silly when this is serious. I'm sorry. 
###i need someone to see this. 

Can anyone direct me to a credible source sharing this MAGA hat photo from his Instagram account?

There are links here to a wayback machine but they don't quite seem right to me, and why is the Wayback machine? Was his account deleted?

I just see a ton of fake accounts of his everywhere and I'm not about to get duped by some idiot journalist somewhere. 

Not saying it isn't true. Just looking for reputable reporting.

I forgot. 
Copying my comment from above:

Consider though that the poll was conducted after IIRC a scandal free week. Stock continuing to rise. Tax plan just passed. Senate was about to agree on a miltiyear budget. It was looking good. 

But immediately afterwards Trump rejected the Democratic Memo and this abise scandal broke out at the same time.

Fox news was broadcasting "President intends to release Democratic memo" after news broke that Trump sent it back. 

Trump was.also.govkng a speech last week on the economy while news channels hi ad it split screened with the plummeting stock exchange. Some broadcasts actually turned Trump off to focus on the dip. 
Ha. Yeah. Wasn't thinking hard last night.

That's alot better if you can bring someone. Thought it was super odd benefits were shared but you still get one ticket. 
I guess that makes it a little better, but suppose it really comes down to how often that second seat comes along. 

And I suppose nothing's stopping you from using the reward account for concessions when they aren't coming. 
Cinemark just started promoting one to me. $8 a month. 1 movie per month, %20 off concessions and a few minor perks. Can share perks worth friends. Which I'm assuming is the discount.

I'm not saying you're violated the TOS. You are absolutely working within the framework they provide. 

I'm saying him MoviePass did adopt a 4am-4am "day" you really wouldn't have any kind of legitimate claim to how it negatively effects you. 

One of the reasons MoviePass operates how it does as compared to something like QSiNEMiA is that it fills seats that were also unlikely to be filled to start. 

What you do is actually a fantastic idea since you can't purchase online. I just don't think in has any foundation to prevent a change that would ultimately benefit alot more people.

Devil's Bargain: Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, and the Nationalist Uprising https://www.amazon.com/dp/0735225044/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_iUYGAb9W93YXP

Biggest story released so far was Bannon was waiting in the wing to run for president if Trump resigned with Bannons base who he brought to Trump. 
MP should just make a "day" be 4am-4am.
Saw the recent post about how we should abandon this label among other slurs and thought the conversation and insight would be welcome here. 

He specifically notes his different perspective on masculinity from his father being the original moment of insecurity. 

He said he would describe how he managed to climb out of his situation after he comes back from a job interview.

Hey /u/poppinkream. 

Just wanted to let you know in my 5 years or redditting I've never friended anyone but after seeing you post a couple of times I decided that would be a great way to keep track of your research. 

Your posts now appears purple in my Reddit app, and every thread I come across with a purple name I know to read and be thankful. 
I'd say so. 

I worked on RCL as a theatre tech and know many entertainers. Don't know if you mean cast member or musician etc. 

You should find time to work something out, might not be as often as you want. But I don't think you'd regret the certification in any event. 
I just copied a post about the "type" bannon is below but wanted to make sure you saw it too. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7ww1p7/slug/du3u14i
This is from /u/random-dent a month ago. 

>To really understand this you have to get Bannon.

>It's important to remember that Bannon isn't quite a white nationalist or Trumpian *per se* - he's a hardcore isolationist-nationalist with a worldview that "Western civilization" is under threat and in decline.  He thinks in apocalyptic terms and sees himself as a prophet in an epochal struggle to save his tribal people, and is willing to do whatever is necessary to achieve those ends - thus his obsession with China, immigration, etc.  He believes ardently in "traditional values" and in a myth of the moral superiority of a Leave it to Beaver 1950's manufacturing and masculine America.

>To the degree that he's racist it's not about skin color, it's about beliefs and behaviour, and to the degree that he's anti-immigrant it's because of immigrants unwillingness to be the kind of "pure" American he wants them to be.  He sees a worldview wherein globalization leads to moral degeneration and the eventual swamping of **his** superior culture by **other** inferior cultures.  His Islamophobia isn't the terrorist-fearing post-9/11 that is so common, but a deeper one more rooted in xenophobia.  He's not afraid of people blowing up buildings, he's afraid that the West's openness to new ideas and new people, combined with the East's closed-ness, will lead to the West's cultural erosion until it becomes dominated by Islam or China, while Islamic and Chinese countries are able to maintain a "pure" ideology/culture.  He sees globalization as a scheme of a cabal of evil bankers who don't care about anything but their bottom line, and are thus complicit in the decline of his beloved civilization - which is where his populism, to the degree that he's a populist, comes from.

>Now, Bannon also thinks he's a genius.  He's *way* smarter than everyone else, sees these trends happening and is crying and screaming while everyone else lets their entire civilization crumble around them.  He needs power to get the things he wants to do done - to save his people.  Where does that power come from?  White nationalists, Tea Party Republicans, Nazis.  He doesn't worry about it, because he's smart, he can control people, and anyways this is so dire that the ends justify the means.  If he stokes up racial animus to get people to vote for Trump, who cares?  Trump will help him save the world.

>Here's the problem.  Trump doesn't have an ideology, except the glory of Trump. So when he takes office, he's suddenly being told that people will love him more if he behaves more traditionally.  Congressional Republicans have certain policy goals that are different from Bannon's, and when they fail, it's seen as a Trump failing.  So he drifts more and more into being a traditional Republican President, albeit far less effective.  He appoints Ron Swansons to ensure their departments don't function, but doesn't outright destroy them.  He talks about a border wall and gets a mild, temporary immigration ban in place, but doesn't do anything with it.  And he has no antipathy at all to giant, globalized business, except when he can use it to make his constituents adore him.  So not only is he being frustratingly uncontrollable, when you can control him, he's too incompetent to get anything done.  

>So Bannon is no lot the genius hand behind the throne he though he would be.  He's an impotent vizier whose sultan is constantly drifting to other people's influence.  To add insult to injury, he eventually loses even the fiction of influence, and is fired.

>Bannon always knew Trump was an idiot and an egotist, but he thought he could use him. It's imminently clear that Trump is not going to be useful in Bannon's epochal struggle, so he can say what he really thinks of him while trying cultivate the "alt-right" in an attempt to defend his culture from the horrible influx of others.  The only danger in doing so is alienating the alt-right who still believe in Trump, but he sees that as little danger because *he* created Trump, and *he* is using the alt-right, and can still control them... right?

>EDIT: Some people are asking for where I got these ideas - a couple of years of reading the news+stuff Bannon has written and Trump has done.  /u/hrtfthmttr has made an excellent post with some sources in the BestOf thread that I've added below with their permission:

>>It really isn't. This bestof is actually one of the better I've seen, because it fits exactly with the actual data we have about Bannon. If you have time, I would highly recommend reading the following:

>>* [Bannon speaks to his general worldview in 2014]( https://www.buzzfeed.com/lesterfeder/this-is-how-steve-bannon-sees-the-entire-world)
* [Bannon and his "factories of hate" approach]( https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/heres-how-breitbart-and-milo-smuggled-white-nationalism), where he was using Milo to stoke racial and gender fervor primarily as means to an end.
* [Bannon's interview with Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/12/bannon-for-president-trump-kushner-ivanka) in December 2017, highlighting his megalomania, long term political aspirations, and view of Trump.
* [Wolff's perspective on the main three camps infighting for influence with Trump](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/michael-wolff-my-insane-year-inside-trumps-white-house-1071504), Bannon being one.

>>Now, we have Freedom Caucus representatives that align with the Bannon ideology [actively pushing to remove Sessions]( https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/04/jeff-sessions-resign-freedom-caucus-mark-meadows-jim-jordan-324022), which I take to be a political attack by Bannon on Trump. They know that would be political suicide for Trump, but they aren't so sure Trump knows it, given how he already sacked Comey against Bannon's expressed wishes.

>>This is definitely the Bannonites vs. Trump, and the OP describes well what I think is the reason.


Little gold is what it translates to. 

Original Doritos where plain chips. Thus the Golden color. Nacho flavoring came layer. 

And this joke is bad because they only translated half the word...

And yes. I'm a hoot at parties. 
One says 50% if they were all killed. 

The other says and quote 175% of his maximum health pool if you killed all 4..

That should be 50 and 200. 
Well CNN did have their token right wing commentator until he proclaimed "Sieg Heil" on Twitter... 

Doesn't mean they couldn't have gotten another though. 
I've seen it. 

We aren't best. And haven't been for a long time. 

But we can be. 

And people often completely miss the point.

Apparently no one can agree on the math. People below say different amounts too. 
I'll check that out. 

Shep is just a funny kind of adlib guy. He shouldn't report international tradgedies with the same glib - at the same time the 24hr news mean he has to keep on rambling.

I don't know how exactly it breaks down. But it is not on every phone. I had it on my MotoX 2013 & 14 as a Moto feature which essentially bridged it over to Google Now. 

Nowadays people are supporting Google Assistant directly. On Nougat (With the S8) you have to unlock the phone. On Oreo I'm told it's possible w/o unlocking it. 
You're in a Samsung S8 Subreddit. 
It's not a feature on Nougat. That's the point of this post saying Oreo
What I mean is that he would still do his brand of his whacky speculation. 

He needed to calm his viewers but instead kept doing his brand. "There may be more bombs, we don't know. Anything could happen, there might be a dozen of them". Not a direct quote but you her an idea. Paris bombing shouldn't be fun reporting.

You should use factlet instead of factoid in this context to avoid confusion. 

Factoids are typically untrue but repeated until they become known as fact. 
I'd also check the screen resolution. 
So is that the tip?
Well okay. What do you not like about it?
Theming (also that's getting better on stock)

Samsung Pay is better than Android pay. 

Samsing Health is better than Google Play.

Shep is also hilarious. 

However when he covers serious things like the Paris bombing he forgets to sober up which is a problem. 
Oh man. I love watching Shep on Fox news.

"I'm a jornalist. Not a commentator like Sean Hannity, I report facts"
This needs to go to /r/interestingasfuck
Yes. You're right. That seems a bit odd. But there isn't any evidence that he was the source of the leak. There's speculation. That's why it's a conspiracy theory. 

But no evidence has been found that what you say is true. And the only news agency that reported that as true has recanted. 
That article is inconclusive. 

>A team of private investigators led by GOP lobbyist Jack Burkman told DailyMail.com he found no emails to Wikileaks on Seth Rich's computer

>A private investigator working for Seth Rich's family said he has examined the slain DNC staffer's computers and found no evidence he was in contact with Wikileaks before his death, disputing claims made by an unnamed federal investigator on Tuesday.

>An anonymous federal investigator told Fox News on Tuesday that an FBI review of Rich's computer found he had transferred over 40,000 internal DNC emails to Wikileaks last May, which were later published by the whistle blower website.

>Over the weekend, internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom – who is facing extradition to the United States on racketeering charges – also announced on Twitter that he knew Seth Rich personally and had personal knowledge that Rich was the Wikileaks source.

Family wanted police to release their report because of all the misinformation. Many don't believe it was robbery. But not that he was the source.

Since I'm not getting a reply from you I'm just going the mention that the Seth Rich Death/Murder is unfounded and false by Politifact, Snopes, & FactCheck. 

It's reported as false by NYT, LA Times, and Wash Po. 

The parents condemned Fox News for the report, asked for a retraction and sent a cease and desist. 

>"The investigator stated that he had no evidence to back up the claims which Fox News attributed to him."

Fox news then retracted the news without explanation. 
Yeah but it's the year paid upfront for $115. I hope she realized be that. It only says this right before you click buy after giving your info. 
Okay but who are these 6 people. 

Who died? You're meaning Rich?

Who got money from the above acts?
The 7.95 + 20 which is available on the website right now will charge you $115 for the year upfront. It only tells you this when you've filled out your account and main information right before you pay. There doesn't seem to be a truly monthly option anymore. 
That's what I said. You might be replying to the wrong comment
Who is going to Guantanamo?

Who got who killed?

Who got money for it?
Private sector is already going to pay more. She was also only with that job for 9 months so it doesn't appear she was there for a career. 

Plus she probably wants off the crazy train
Where was it verified by DoD? I think Snopes would have mentioned that. 
It was reported that this information already matched information the FBI already knew which gave it credibility. It's also not the only thing. 
That it's called checks and balances. And I'm pretty sure they had to redraft the ban once and maybe two times.

I also trust the Supreme Court way more than other parts of out governent. 

In the end it only meant that it's constitutional, not that we still should - morally, ethically etc. Just that he can. 

And I'm not for Trump. But he *was* elected. So what he says goes. 
You started with a question. Which I answered. And then took the opportunity to expand on what you were saying - which  I directly called out on top of my comment. That way whoever is reading is provided the additional context. 

So it's also in repsonse to who you wee right replying to
I try really hard to be objective about this too, and glad that you evidently really try to just see the facts, but I don't think you have them all - bit I see you asking a lot of questions on this thread. 

I'm not really mad at the DNC paying for oppo research. It happens all the time. And I'm not made at the conservatives paying for Steele during the primaries either. If they broke campaign laws then they should be charged accordingly.

I'm mad at the FBI *if* the GOP memo is true and they violated Page's rights as a citizen. AND/OR intentionally mislead the FISA court due to personal bias (which is really hard to do). But we won't know until we get the other memo ultimately. 

I am still mad about the DNC and the events around the primaries. 

I'm mad at Hillary for A LOT of things. And still wouldn't want her as president. But ultimately, alot of this doesn't have to do with her unless you actually believe she's pulling the strings. If she *also* was influenced by Russia (without getting into Uranium One) then absolutely I have that. 
Okay sorry about that. But my latter point stands. Mueller's investigation isn't into Trump. It's into Russian interference I'm the 2016 election, which Page certainly played a role. 

Ultimately it doesn't matter if he was working for him or not if he's being influenced. 
There's a couple top level comments on this thread. But you're right that there are more against him than for him on Reddit. 

But all you have to do is go to the_donald for yourself. That isn't satire on that subreddit. 

Curious though if you're American or not. If you are you should care who the president is. If you aren't then I couldn't blame you for trying to ignore it all. 
The DNC did pay fusion GPS for the research. So did the Republicans during the primary. The DNC took over the bill. 

This did not launch the investigation. As stated in the GOP memo, and reported by media before, it was started after Papadapalous when the U.S. was alerted by Australian Government after a diplomat learned Papa was touting Russians had dirt on Clinton and wanted in. 

And there is more than just the Dossier that goes into all this. 
What does your uncle say to the same companies investing in the same technology now? Oh and some of them will point out they are an "energy" company now. 
It was reported.

https://www.snopes.com/trump-military-inaugural-parade/

Snopes however is saying that is "unproven". So I guess we can't say for sure. 
Not same user bit to expand on this. 

Page is *now* working with Mueller *since* he plead guilty. He wasn't working with the FBI

*If* he was then this is some serious false flag espionage. But no one has even come close to saying that. 

.

One argument is that Trump may have been caught in the surveillence of Page. Meaning Page was tapped while having a conversation with Trump at Trump tower. 

That's absolutely possible. But no one is reporting that actually happened. Very early on in this whole process it was reported Trump tower was tapped by Obama. This might be the same, or something separate or that might not have been true at all at the time (six months ago or something) I'd have to research back into that. 

~~And they were spying on Page *while* he was working for Trump. He was fired later~~. And anyone who is a door for Russia to influence politics whether working for Trump or not can be investigated. So in the end it doesn't really matter who he's working for if he's actually doing these things. 

EDIT: This is also an extension to reply to /u/jumpifnotzero. Just wanted to make sure you saw this too. 
I suspect the absence of facts because 1. The memo leaves out information that has already been reported on by various news outlets. And 2. Because the house demcrats and the FBI claim the memo is misleading due to the omission of information. 

>That makes the known horrible things okay.

Well. 

The GOP memo is clearly lacking context besides any factual omissions. So at least with the surrounded context it's more understanding. 

Essentially the GOP is claiming the FBI did not provide all the information beneficial to Page when requesting the warrent which is required because he is a citizen. 

This information is the political bias of Steele as an individual. As well as the source paying for the Steele Doss.

Dems are saying the FBI did share that and if you'd allow us to provide the rest of context in our own memo you can see that yourself. 

*If* they did share this information to the FISA application, it makes  "the horrible thing" (granting a FISA warrent on knowing bad/misleasing info and violating the right of Page as a citizen) no longer horrible. Because it was never actually horrible to begin with. 

And the fact that renewals were made under two different FBI Chiefs, one appointed by Trump, means they were getting additional meaningful info from the surveillence of Page. And then there's the while part where Page actually please guilty to lying to the FBI. 

So it's not so much about making a horrible thing okay. And more like "is this thing actually horrible/is this being represented in a factual objective way?"
Cherrypicking doesn't mean it isn't true by default. Just that individual "cherries"/facts were picked *instead* of others/all of them. 

So you picked these of here, those over there and made a thing. In this case (and admitibly many) is misleading to a pretty safe degree of untrue. 

It is connotativley negative. 
I agree. He is "trapped". But this is not a trap. He wasn't set up from the outside for this. 


Can't wait for that parade. 

Can you imagine inauguration day if he got the ballistic missiles and tanks he wanted?

Shows you how real hyper-normalization is. 

That would have immediately screamed Dictator. And now its "patriotism". When really it's sole been for his ego. 
The info was already vetted by FBI and DOJ and was voted unanimously in the House of Reps. 

Only Trump has an issue with it. 
Well then the Judiciary kicks in 

Which is why so many people have sued Trump over the Muslim ban etc. Only that takes time. And can only happen afterward. 
The law?

I don't know much about the procedure they're are using because the GOP memo was the first time it had ever been used. 

But AFAIK Trump has a 5 day window to block it within this process. And he chose to do so. To supercede that would be against Congress. 
I get what you're saying. 

But it is curious the president thinks the GOP memo is a lot of something and wants a redaction of something in the Dem too. 
I doubt something like that would even be in this memo. 

It's not even about the grand investigation. 

It's about FISA warrent abuse....

EDIT: But thank you for engaging me. Not /s
Thanks for the the info. Enjoy your weekend. 
I am saying. As of now. Also I just saw that it was to be the attorney for Walmart? 

Anyways. If all she wanted was of lf the crazy chain I wouldn't blame her. 
I really think we are going to get it released by then. 

The problem is the redactions Trump is requesting in spite of it already being vetted by FBI and DOJ to a unanimous Houston Committee...
Interesting. 

Good to point out though that her departure as of now is only because she "found the type of job you don't turn down." 


Thanks. Just typing fast. 
Quick question. 

Any idea why my top comment is upvoted and my follow ups are negative? 

Is it brigading downvotes on all posts but the upvotes are only happening at top level comments because people mostly read those?

I mean to ask if there's anything factually wrong with my follow up questions. 
That's a good point. 
Which is why they already vetted the info with FBI and DOJ before it went to Trump. 

But Trump wants more out. 

I mean to say that it's much harder to correct the narrative without the full truth. 
Pretty sure there definitely was. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7usv0k/megathread_white_house_releases_controversial/

Was the top post for me. 
Thanks.

 So yeah. Whatever Trump wanted redacted was his choice but has been given the blessing of the FBI and AG. Wonder what it is. 
Why are the top/best posts in Trump threads always also the the top Controversial posts?
~~Is Gowdy on the committee?~~

~~How does he feel that everyone on the committee was originally okay with the release of the memo?~~

He's on the committee. So he voted to release it. It was unanimous right?
I absolutely believe that. 

I believe in order to accurately correct the misleading GOP memo the amount of information that needs to be released to complete the narrative naturally contains more secure facts. 

EDIT: That they intentionally included this information in attempt to actually release it. 

~Not an attenpt to release it knowing it would get redacted in order to fuel a political move against the redaction in the future. Which is btw. Super risky. 
I know about the latter fact. I'm saying the GOP picked "better" information for lack of a better word for less security fallout. Dems can't do the same because the counterargument naturally contains for secure facts. And the major argument against the GOP memo if I recall was that it was innacurate. Not so much about the suecurity fallout. 

That said. 

I did not see that FBI and DOJ had already reviewed it. Link? 

Wash Po reported that Trump sent it back with letter from Chris Wray and Rosenstein that two classes IIRC should be redacted. 

Would that mean intelligence originally okayed it but on Trump's request Wray is saying "yea, go ahead and remove what the president wants"? Which would make Trump specifically responsible for the future omission. 

EDIT: Counterargument - Gowdy claims Dems I intentionally included info requiring redaction .

I believe that. Because it is *essential* to correct the misleading GOP memo. 
On the basis of some information that should be redacted. 

I agree with you. 

But on the reason just above the DOJ agrees with Trump reportably. So the next step is to edit the memo to meet their requests. Which is what I thought would happen anyways based on my theory above. 

The only difference is I didn't expect the GOP to play as nicely. And the difference in Trump's aproach about listening to Christopher Wray *this time*. 
WashPo also just reported Nunes is committed to continue the inquiry of the effect of the Steele Dossier in government but without any more memos. 

### Thank God

>"The problem with this whole committee and the investigation itself, in a normal world the panel would have simply interviewed the Justice Department officials who approved the surveillance applications, like Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein. Instead we do a memo, And now the Democrats are doing their memo, and we’re in memo hell.”

- *senior House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Thomas J. Rooney (R-Fla.)*

And a ~~Senator~~ Representative from Florida shows reason. 

Here's my quick theory. 

GOP cherry picked information that specifically left out cirtical details, and that those details which would vindicate the Dems are way more important and therefore more relevant to the ongoing investigation. 

Meaning they can't be made public. Which is why Dems memo was 10 pages and GOP 4. You just *can't* release such nuanced I information in part. 

Trump may have his own reason of declining but I never felt like this was going to get a pass for the above reason. 

It *does* however show how completely irresponsible Nunes was for even writing the memo. 
Hey. Just wanted to say thanks for the job you do and hope you get a chance to properly respond. 

Also of you haven't heard Trump blocked the release of the Dem Memo and wanted to hear your first reaction it. 
House committee voted to release a GOP written memo into FISA (domestic surveillence) warrent abuse in realtion to the Steele Dossier. 

Dems claimed the memo was cherry picked and intentionally misleading and wanted to release their own explaining such. 

Original vote chose to release GOP and not Dem on party lines. 

GOP memo comes out. Analysis was made and GOP said we're being transparent. Outcry asked for Dems the ability to release theirs. New vote from Congress said yes but with both releases Trump had final say. 

Trump said yes to GOP. No to Dem. 

Some GOP say this is only about being transparent about abuse and not about undermining Mueller. Trump said he's vindicated about the whole investigation being a partisan Hoax. 

Trump just shot GOP I'm the foot by running on grounds of transparency in this release. 

Theres a ton of info leading up to this and a lot of nuamce and moving parts but maybe that's your ELI5
The actual color wheel theory term you might be looking for is what's known as a Harmony color scheme. 
Can't you just have any app as a game and record that way?
I worked on RCL as their Light Tech. 

That's all the entertainment lighting repairs, maintence, programming, and operation.  It's under the Cruise department under Head Sound & Light, Stage Production Manager, Cruise Director and finally Hotel Director. 

So it's incredibly related. 


Is that really the case or would it either just be for the acoustics?

And if you're not sure where he's going to be/see him again he can mail you instant photos. 

EDIT: they also make portable instant printers now as well which could be more cost effective as what you list above are pretty cheap. 
"fix this" 

Umm. It's not broken. This is a feature. 

I think you intend to ask of they give you an option to disable. 
How?
5 hours. No details. One comment from OP. Color me suspicious. 

It is a good painting though. 
Frankly surprised they don't zero+rate their own traffic. 
That's such a weird combination. 

1TB cap. Common for Comcast and honestly I'd say that within consumption of a vast majority of users. I have a 250 cap and would love 1TB.

25mb down. Of course it's only to depend on where you are but I haven't seen those speeds anywhere I've been in a while. 

$25 /mo. SUPER cheap in my experience. I'm used to $40-50 albeit at 50 mb/s or even 100mb/s at the promotional price. 

$50 per GB over? Hot damn! My carried charges $10 for every 50GB over 250.

It's like they just played roulette with all the features/costs of your plan. 
I have 250gb at my families house where there used to be 5 people on it. Meant it was impossible to cut the cord.

I'm not going to mention any of the demanding or stupid or ignorant guests and their questions/actions as an employee.

So you might be hesitant to trust Verizon. That's understandable but this article is really balanced but the people responding to it are not:

> The carriers mentioned in the commits include Vodafone Libertel in the Netherlands (20404), Verizon Wireless in the United States (311480), and Telstra Corp. in Australia (50501, 50511, 50571, 50572). We can’t speak for why these carriers requested this change (we’ve reached out to Verizon for comment, but have yet to hear of an official response regarding this issue), so we can only speculate about some of the possible reasons.

>...it’s possible that carriers are requesting this feature, and Google is simply obliging. Now, this doesn’t necessarily have negative connotations, as some carriers may be looking to normalize signal bars with numbers that actually make sense for a specific carrier or country: a lower or higher dBm number may be standard in a certain carrier or country, and as such, thresholds could be tweaked so that signal bars aren’t always sitting at 1 or 5.

>...The actual reasoning behind this change, however, is unknown, so don’t hop to conclusions just yet.

Can't we just wait and see what happens? This is also incredibly easy to call out a company on if they go against consumers. I get that less tech savvy people may be taken advantage of *if* a company decided to be malicious. But all you have to do I report it in the press or don't give your money to one of these manufacturers.

It's very easy to use a non-carrier phone on any network. Competition for phone OEMs is massive and there is a fair-ish amount of competition among mobile networks.

I'm just asking for a little practically and patience. 
Making the assumption that this is (so egregious)? /
Making the assumption that Google hasn't developed features for carriers in the past?
That would be unprecedented though wouldn't it?
Thanks for actually engaging me in a meaningful way - although you didn't counter on the audio recording of Trump's "locker room" talk. 

###Controlled Opposition
So you're saying Fox news is equally bought but engineered specifically to have an even level or pro / con in order to prevent a full tilt of public perception?

But in the case of fox news there's night and day difference between Sean Hannity and Sheppard Smith. Hannity is a "commentator" and Shep is a "jornalist" and Shep makes this very clear on the his news program. He specifically calls out a lot of misleading information being pushed by Congress. And thought that distinction is really interesting to look at over at Fox. 

###What about Obama
This was not a newstory I heard at the time. But the footage was aired on CNN at least. I can say this is somewhat Juvenile bit does not really pale to Trump's offences in the matter. In the audio Trump out right admits to sexual assualt. 

>I better use some Tic Tacs just in case I start kissing her. You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. *I don’t even wait*. And when you’re a star, *they let you do it*. You can do anything.

###Uranium One Testimony Declassified

So this goes into Russia trying to meddle with election politics. This again proves this to be true. I believe Russia attempted to meddle from every direction to reset sanctions. That's Hillary and Trump, both are possible. And either if guilty of any crime should face consequences. That being said only one was elected president and continues to admire Putin publicly and refused to establish sanctions in one of the most bipartisan bills to have passed Congress in a year. (But in reference to the news, yes this has been underreported - but I'm will to bet there'll be more pickup I'm a day or two as either side on Congress politicize this is their favor)

The other side of this testimony reads almost like the Steele discrediting.

> After interviewing the individual and reviewing the documents they had obtained, prosecutors determined that there was a “high chance” that he had begun engaging in illegal activity earlier than he initially disclosed—and that he had concealed those actions from the FBI.As a result, Justice Department officials working the case began to have “serious concerns” with using the individual as a witness. They “assessed” that the individual “would not present as a good witness” and “did not want to rely on him at trial.”

>Justice Department officials confirmed that they do not plan to use the testimony of this individual in any future prosecution.

>Most importantly, Justice Department officials explained that this individual never provided any evidence or made any allegations regarding Secretary Clinton or the Clinton Foundation in any of their interactions with him.

###Text messages about Obama. 

The actual context of these messages still remain unclear. Whether he meant to be kept in the loop as a sitting president should  or something sinister. The allegation is that he put his hands directly into the case which I find unlikely. Plus, this  was just before Comey went to Obama to brief him at the Whitehouse prior to the transition IIRC. 

This story did come across my news feed from Fox. 

###Clinton Emails

I'm not surprised to hear that. But I don't find it any more criminal then what she was already doing. She was found not criminaly at fault (and I know the releases were softer on the final draft). Send her jail, I'm really not here to defend her. But I haven't heard this yet and glad to hear it, I can't seem to find an article at all though. So it's a bit more of a can't be tried twice for the same crime sort of deal. The FBI really screwed up this whole thing it how it was handled. Not necassarily bias IMO but it was public chaos and yeah, maybe for *that* reason Comey should have been fired. Though Trump admited in interview is was because of the Russia Thing. 

###Release the Memo aftermath. 
This one I think it's important to make a distinction between the ongoing investigation and FISA warrent proceedings. I think it's completely possible that the FBI skirted giving up all the info beneficial to Page when applying for the warrant. But ultimately until the Dems get to release theirs there can't be much of a discussion on it. Everyone who is listed by name in the memo besides Rosentein have left for various reasons. Yates for example was fired by Trump for failing to enforce the Muslim ban. Her testifying against Flynn was a bonus. There was Comey, Mcabe, Yates, Stzork, and I can't recall the other two. It's also important to note that Trump appointed Mcabe himself. And if you want to get into details about the memo we can, but I can't say there'll be much of a conclusion until we get this other memo. 

Edit: and there *are* many Republicans, including one of it's authors, making the distinction that the memo is only for transparency oversight which is their job and is not meant to have any comment on the Russian investigation. 

The President however says he is "totally vindicated". 

And it's also funny to me, to run on a platform on transparency to bite along party lines to release the GOP memo and not the Dems.
And somehow Fox News can't be bought, you're saying?

Grab her by the pussy - 
### there is literally audio tape of this and a confirmed credible witness who lost his own job over the comment. 

If he never said it why did he call it locker room talk?

The pornstar has entire published interview where she goes into details about it for a magizanine. But yes, that is still alledgedly. 


How is it manufactured?

The Republican party used to be for "Christian family values" bit then supported "grab em by the pussy" - porn star affair with his third wife - would be dating his daughter at half his age - Trump. Then everyone came out to bat for Roy Moore. 

The Republican party used to be about fiscal responsibility but just passed record tax cuts while passing one of the largest spending bills be and is asking for a $1,000,000,000 infrastructure plan. Personally, that's okay, but he said it's for the working class when it's mostly just for companies - I wouldn't have cared of they were just honest. 

He openly attacks a free press, including the foreign press while he's overseas. All this mental gymnastics the party is doing to curry favor is ridiculous and it has irreparably changed the party moving forward. 
There is a such thing as topics that aren't joking matters. 

There is a such thing as decorum. 

Calling the Democratic party "treasonous" for not applauding while being hyperbole is plain unamerican. He called half of his Congress traitors to his country. 

And that's on top of how easily he arrived at choosing that word. Casually, "why not, let's call it treason". 
Sorry for all the downvotes and I hope you read this to give a little bit of context. 

Back when Esienhower was president Russia and China were doing all these parades, so it was brought to him saying the U.S. should too. 

Only he disagreed. He said that it wouldn't mirror America as being a broker of worldwide price as the preeminent world power. 

And he also caitioned that it ultimately wouldn't glorify the troops bit the president as he is commander-in-chief. 

I totally understand your own caition about how patriotism might be redfining itself. But we went through this already with a sitting Republican president. Who didn't dodge and was a *general*. 

Plus it's obvious to see that Trump want this parade for himself because he's envious of Macron and other world leaders.

I have a good friend who's younger sister is a member of "Kekistan" a fictional online troll community which uses PePe as a mascot. She refused to see that there are legitimate racists, far alt-right and neonazis in this community and insists that it's all for the laughs of getting someone riled up. And that there may be "some bad apples just like antifa and BLM"

While I believe she's not personally racist and instead fell into a online community/culture which lead her to this, the fact you can't take a step back and ask yourself if this "trolling" is simply helping or worsening the conversation and climate is what saddens me. 

At the same time Donald retweeted that CNN wrestling stomp .gif that started on the_donald and the subreddit went literally batshit crazy claiming he was one of them all along, troll-in-chief etc
He did a similar think about the Charlottesville rally. He's the quickest president in history to denounce his rivals in sometimes pretty nasty ways. But felt he needed days IIRC to respond about neonazis and still fucked it up. 
Just got a kick out of reading this thread. 

Thanks. I replied eslewhere to this guy. I laughed out loud at the goalposts. 
Man it's hard for me to say without seeing/knowing more about you but based on your weird ass language it seems that you are abusive AF

P.S. "it's not bad because people do it too/worse" isn't even an excuse. It's rationalizing poor behavior. 

By what standards? The standard of human decency. 

Take a nap. 
You're right.

I really have nothing bad to say be about TMobile and I've had them my whole life. 

There's an argument that their Binge on violates Net Neutrailty so they're pro-stance is super hypocritical. 
While I know how to spell and pronounce that name. I've still to this day never met of heard of anyone with that name besides celebrity/historical figures. 
On the topic of time. 

It should only take 5 minutes to get an answer from someone else, or a superior. If you don't have the ability to pick your business partner. And you don't have the money. Then you absolutely have time. And you absolutely have 5 minutes. And I'd encourage anyone in a similar situation to do so. 

And stop assuming I'm rich. Stop assuming I'm powerful. And stop assuming I don't value my time. 

In this case *you value your time more than potentially changing your signature* it's all relative. And because you lied. It ended fairly moot. If you were forced to change your signature then this would be slightly different. 

Signing a signature is *your choice*. No one can force you to sign it any other way. They could blackmail you bit it's *still your choice* how to sign. It ***is not a myth***. Legal or even otherwise. *you reserve the right to sign however you choose*. 
Hey. I'm sorry to see no one replying. 

I work I'm technical theatre, have worked in a corporate theatre warehouse/rental and on cruise ships in a wider form of entertainment. I see this behavior a lot. 

Your keen to also point out that is isn't always sexism (although it definitely is sometimes, especially in the industry). 

What I see here is more or less ego, and depending on how it's shown, not *necassarily* toxic as you seem to also agree. 

I think this comes from a few places. 

You are a paid hire, if this isn't true of the other 4 there's a differential between the positions. They've also been there longer etc. So they are going to be put into a more educational role of the start. 

You say you think everything if asked would say you are on the same level. But this exact behavior doesn't show that. If they analyzed it themselves they would see that, or have an answer to your question. Although it could ultimately come down to culture - especially if everyone is doing it to everyone. 

Companies on work at now do have that baseline. You walk in and get assigned a task. You have the experience to do it, and even if your superiors don't know you the expectation that you know how to do it is there. And ultimately, if it is safe, it shouldn't matter if the process in different. And anyone butting in should be asked why are you *choosing* to help me over your own task. 

We just had a meeting recently where this behavior was given a moment of notice. Asking someone for help is nice. Telling them how to do it is ego. Those weren't the exact words and wish I could remember the nuance but yeah. 

I had a really bad situation of this backseat driving while o had one giu up on a lawyer who had to use swaging tool (nicopress) over his head while standing on a ladder to an already hung clue in the rig. It wouldn't be easy for anyone. But I had to tell the rest of the guys to shut up because there's only one person with eyes properly on the issue and he's up there. 

Lastly. It might be because your group is too diverse in aspects and has never managed to create a procedure, or establish a synergy. And your team in at least one aspect of this wasted energy is disfunction. If someone is yelling while you're 25ft up it *needs* to be a reason. Whether you're in truss, a genie or on a ladder. He needs to know that that's not okay. Existing procedure should influence that isn't okay behavior. 

Anyways. Your topic really interests me and I'd love to talk more about it. If you could narrow any of your thoughts down I can probably give some better insight. 
I haven't said anything about consequences!

But I know for a FACT there are multiple mortgage companies. And multiple employees within the same company that might be more proficient, and I have a right to seek out someone else to help me. 

How about I ask to speak to someone senior before I walk out the door? These are very *reasonable and easy* measure someone could take in this situation while preserving the deal. 

This is how rights get trampled. Sometimes because people have no idea what their doing. And it's up to the individual to be proactive and assert his rights. This is minor - I know that. But your argument of power *is* valid, and it's worse for many others in way more serious matters. 

It's a singniture today, but was it tomorrow when the power man takes advantage? What happens when is *really* matters. What happens if it's a warrant?

###But here you are today. Saying it is a ***myth*** that you can sign your signature however you wish. This is false. It is not a myth. This is never true. 


Why are you generalizing everything? 

As if everything requires a signature and only from 1 source. 

Why do you equate walking away in a principle to being rich and powerful? In this situation you've already made it clear that the signee *does not have power*. 

So you're saying you didn't have to sign *anything* until after you give this mortgage company throusands of non-refundable deposits? Are you serious? 

I'm saying if I'm about to sign something, *the first time*, and it's overtly obvious that the person I'm about to go into business with has misconceptions about the law, and or, can't see pass triviality to what actually matters then I'm going to take some serious thought into what I'm getting into. Someone asking you to *change your signature for them* is chilling. 

*The fact you had to lie to your mortgage broker is chilling*
Okay. You realize that is a incredibly sweeping generalization that also implies that taking someone to court is the only solution when people disagree?

How about if they *really* are insisting you take your business elsewhere? I certainly don't want to deal with an individual or company with first-most, a misunderstanding of the law and secondly, will insist on trivial matters who can apparently only retain meek clients. 

I'm 100% serious. If someone asks me to sign my signature differently from the way I already do; or choose to then I will walk out the door. It's completely destructive to the principle that a signature represents. 
well don't know anyone who signed their name as X in this millenium and I'm not friends with doctors either...

I have never had my middle name in my signature unless it was digital and have never heard of *anyone* forced to sign a signature including a middle name. Much more than that I have never even *heard* of that being a requirement. 

What if you don't have a middle name? My mom doesn't. Not too mention should you ever have a need to be taken to court there's not going to be a single judge on this planet to dismiss a contract if it was you in fact who signed it. 

--

I can't asnwer your last question but I learned cursive in middle school, imeddiately proceeded to never use it and my signature is more of a free flow print than anything else. And it is definitely separate from my printed name. 

I *do* however know many people, including my brother who were taught cursive and how to sign their name and proceed to sign their name in full-form cursive as if it's a handwriting worksheet. 

Edit: please direct me to where a signature legally requires your middle name. Sounds like the singular firm is just bananas. 
That took me really long to figure out you meant gender pronouns and not calling me out on my use of you are your. 
But how will they sign contacts? Checks!? /s
Teacher. 
Not sure if /s but you know your signature can be whatever you make it, right?

Have you tried uninstalling it. And reinstalling it. 

Have you tried sideloaded another version. 

Have you tried clearing app data / cache / rollback updates in app settings?

This sounds more like an apk problem then a S8 specific issue. 
If you just wait another month the update should be out I'm pretty sure.

Getting free money isn't worth it anymore because I used to get $100? Are you for real?
Okay I don't know why you're getting downvoted because this is literally the first time someone has brought up an *absolutely* legitimate reason against universal. 

With today's political system after citzens united and regulatory capture this is absolutely a concern. 

My counter to that though is that any new system should put protections in place (well what if they were bought to never to that?) Just not going to play what ifs on something that hasn't happened. 

Anyone arguing for this is going with premise that it will be implemented right. 

The real question is whether you want corporations running it or you want corporations through the government running it. 
Seriously. How does a large geography actually effect healthcare costs?

Ambulances have to drive farther? Shipment of medical supplies have to travel farther? Insurance premiums and skyhigh hospital costs aren't affected by this. 

IIRC 70% of your healthcare premiums pay is towards adminstration costs, that exist regardless of geography. Insurance companies exist regardless of land mass. 
Okay. I'm on your side about healthcare but that has literally nothing to do with this unless you're referring to the manufacturing if ambulances, medical supplies and pills. 

Which is not the reason cost is high.

This reminds me of a restaurant I went two that had a burger but as a double (1/2lb versus 1/4lb). I asked them if I can have it only as a single (didn't see the point in overeating). 

The waitress said sure but that I may not be able to reduce the price, id still have to pay menu price (which I thought was dumb, but didn't protest - I was fine for the price even for a single). 

After telling her that was fine. She looked at me like I was crazy. I told her, I don't care if you bring me a double. *I will not eat the second patty*. 

Tldr; waitress thought I was crazy for saving them materials I wasn't going to eat.

Okay. You're right and wrong here. 

The FBI has not been surveiling Trump since before the election. They were surveiling Page, which IIRC did take place at Trump tower. So as long as Trump was corresponding with page he could've been picked up too - but page has been out of the picture for a long time. 

Mueller's investigation is about Russian interference in the 2016 election. I highly doubt Trump played a majorly active role in this, money laundering and other crimes involving Russia is another story.  His associates however have been proven to have lied to the FBI about dealings with the Russia. It was the people he chose to surround himself with (all of them with the hope they could manipulate Trump as his cabinet members). 

According to the memo the FBI *did* mislead the FISA by not providing any counter evidence that would be beneficial to Page as a U.S. citizen, like Steele's admitted bias again Trump and the financing of the dossier by the DNC (which was also originally financed by the RNC). 3 requests were under Comey. The last under McCabe, so even Trump's appointed FBI Cheif signed off on this along with a swath of other former employees. The only person remaining by name is Rosenstein. 

What's being reported today is that they did in fact pass along this information and was weighed in the application. But we won't know for sure until the Dems get an opportunity to release their memo.  Secondly, the three renewals meant that upon the original 90-day surveillence request, more information was gathered to continue surveiling. If nothing was meritous in those 90 days then the warrant would have ceased without renewal. This is also evident in the fact that Page plead guilty to lying and is currently a cooperative witness. 

Tldr: *according to the memo*, the FBI didn't fully disclose information benefiting page for the FISA warrent. But without the Democratic rebuttle the official story is incomplete. 

It still has no grounding as to how the Russian investigated started and is not sufficient to say without Pages surveillance the investigation would have never started/ended there. 

This needs to be viewed under the strict scobe of FBI procedure and being transparent about the secret FISA proceedings and not about partisan debate on the legitimatacy of Mueller's investigation.

That makes sense. Still seems like a lot of youtube videos though too. Because that's *separate* from the rest of the data in YouTube. 

The types of videos I watch on YouTube on Reddit are much smaller/shorter than if I was actually watching something in the youtube app. Still more than 50gb on 1-20min videos. 
I know you're getting downvoted but there is an actual subreddit dedicated to pointing out dates for this reason alone.

I absolutely get the point his oostnis making. Bit the packaging is literally giving you a common denominator with regular rolls. 
Of course. But some people are making a direct correlation elsewhere and if you look at the time of release of the memo it was before stocks went down. Stocks actually opened fine the next morning.

I feel it's mostly do to the lack of education and opaque labeling rules on products.

Selective breeding is GMO and that dates back to the invention of agriculture. These are good. 

All bananas are clones which are GMO. If you want bananas this is good.

Overtly large fruits are GMO. For many reasons these can be good but people start questioning the adverse effects of processes that are unnatural. But id say they're good. 

Using products like read round up so pesticides don't kill your crop that is later ingested are agruably bad. Arguably because time has not told us yet. But like human immune systems. It only leads to more resiliant pests and is not a sustainable system. 

GMO seeds are propietary and companies like Monsanto are notorious for suing small time farmers who inadvertently end up with seeds carried by the wind onto their farm. 

Personally I don't know if there was a time when the public majority perception of GMO was postive. Except maybe in a 50s science-centric advertising way - but they also got it wrong in a lot of other ways.

I'm not saying what you suggest doesn't hold water. What I am saying is that the standard comment of "They supported Hitler" lacks the distinction of hindsight and the potential for people to *change their minds*.

I'm not saying this is true of Ford or anyone else you mentioned. Just that is that if itself is a weak justification because it's a limited perspective. *At the time* Hitler was great for Germany after sanctions went way over the top from the end of WWI. Deoending on what year you evaluate public opinion matters greatly. 
Thank you. 
Tell me how to operate a davit. Tell me how to lower a lifeboat. Tell me how to release a life raft. Tell me how you're gonna drive a lifeboat. 

My assumptions are not ungrounded. 

What you suggested was an every man for himself. You were going to take it into your own hands and not wait around. And that perspective is counter-productive to emergency situations. 

My original comment was in response to several in this thread. I understand your opinion does not reflect all of them, my comment never had anything to with if someone was alone. It was a response to be people saying, forget the crew - I'm saving myself / I don't expect them to save me anyways. Which you mimiced in your post. 

EDIT: and it's the implication that if none of the employees are around in an emergency that they do not care about their responsibility. That's where that comes from. Fine if it's an assumption, but you already assumed a situation like that is even plausible. Do you have any other reason as to why they won't turn up? Did the rapture happen? My assumptions are not ungrounded. 

Edit 2: and the regard of you saying that you would lower you're own liferaft while also continuing to help other guests has the implication that you are more capable than the crew members in any form. The sheer absence of crew members indicates an abdication of responsibility. 
Again I think you're missing the point. I'm saying the likelihood that 1. Nobody is around is zero. 0%. 2. I'm not suggesting nobody is around, you are, and otherwise no one would fault you for what you suggest - so I don't know why you're arguing it. And 3. Like you would even know how to lower a lifeboat. That you would even know how to operate a davit. 

And then what, you're just gonna take a lifeboat/raft for yourself? Or are you all of a sudden the only one who can help others? 

I'm not trying to argue but you suggest a situation with Zero plausability while at the same time calling out my friends and coworkers for not caring for their job, for not caring about the safety of our passengers and for human life in general. While at the same time diminishing the work of everyone at sea in preparedness for disaster.  We have a responsibility and I'm pained to see you completely disregard their ability and disrespect their motivations. 

EDIT: and to people in this thread saying they don't expect to be saved from people who get such little pay. Fuck you. I'm not saving your life because I'm paid to do it. I'm doing it because I have the training to do so and if I don't you'll die. Money has nothing to do with it.

As someone who is to work for RCL I'm a bit surprised at the amount of negativity here. 

We do drills every week, and safety is one of the largest concerns int he entire company. If there's an emergency you better be damn sure I'd be standing by to aid in the evacuation. What? Guests are going to lower lifeboats themselves?

Its not like we're going down with the ship for Jesus Christ. We have seats on the same lifeboats.

The homescreen is for apps that need the quickest access so I'm okay having a single drawer alphabetized. 

Currently I have two folders at the top of my drawer. One for banking/money and another tools/utility. I find have up to four folders on the top of my app drawer way better than actual separate tabs. 

I use a single homescreen with 12 apps and 3 dock pages at 5ea. So that's already 30 apps. My center dock drawer icon is replaced with a play folder consisting off all the play apps. Which is another 6. 

If I hit home on the homescreen I also get the quick search which if I need something specific it's always going to be faster. Also in that window is most used/recent/and newly updated. 

Basically, and especially with Nova IMO your current setup is unnecessary and in many ways is possibly the worst way to go given all the other ways Nova let's you get to your apps.

Hey so I have Kodi and Sheild pro. Short answer. You can't. 

Android does not allow external media access from another network source. So if I have my 4TB plugged into my Sheild and want to watch a file from my laptop at least through a generic file explorer it won't give access. Afaik this will extend to any program requesting permission. 

You can however use the internal storage to do this. 

What I've done is just plug my HDD into my router and my Phone/Tablet/Desktop/Shield/Laptop can access it from there.

Tell me about it. Got up to around $30 with regular surveys two years ago. Last two surveys was Dec 2017 and before that Dec 2016.  1 survey in an entire year. 

And the last one was literally YouTube screenshots of "would you watch this?" Of literally my current suggested videos. 

I watch Stephen Colbert on YouTube almost every day. Of course I'm going to say they're good recommendations for me. You already know that!

Hi. I used to work on RC. 

It is kind of up to however the doctor fills out your PEME but something simple like BMI and the place you're applying has a hard limit it's going to be difficult to pass. There's no room for evaluation on a simple number, you know?

And you might have to pay for a complete second physical.

I worked with Thomas John on the Majesty of the Seas where he was billed as a juggler but he was BY FAR the best comedian we had during my contract. 

We would hang out quite late sharing stories - he's such a fascinating dude. 

We created "Comedian Bingo" where we put all the standard cruise ship hack jokes on a board. Then during that nights show he tried to give the crew a blackout on their bingo boards by working in all the generic content other comedians fare. We had a blast, and the best thing was that the real audience had no idea that that nights show was basically just for the crew. 

He did a juggling trick with a piece of PVC pipe that he didn't take with him - it's on my bookshelf as a reminder of people you meet almost in passing but end up reflecting on your whole life. Seeing his name again brings me great joy.

So would you say that fettishisation this way developed out of a point of confusion? 

A child irrationally trying to cope with stress while at the same time experiencing puberty which more or less created a link that coincidentally utilized a childhood curiosity?

That meaning to say for any other kid during puberty could equally experience the dawning of a fettish through only conicidental intances?

Because I think there's a difference in more common place fantasies and the fringe (perhaps that's just society and normalcy - although I don't think so).

The fettish you suggest seems to be more abstracted than something physical - especially because the physicallity you would experience if it was real is impossible to gauge. You've never felt something like it before. Can you speak at all about this abstraction?

One might say they like being wrapped tight because as a child they were etc etc Frued etc. But you obviously have never experienced anything remotely close to being swallowed alive, or have you?
Okay. That's quite a response. I grew up with all those movies you mentioned. 

What diverts someone like you from me who found no fettishisation in such an act? Why were those concepts originally linked to being sexual?

I understand once you're in and then branching out to deeper corners of a community, but what about those original exposures was sexual for you?

Thank you. It's "overhire" at 40-60 hours with overtime. Just to avoid benefits/401k. But as long as I'm making continuous steps forward I'm pretty good. 
There's a ton of smaller theatres. But I can't speak too much on the matter. I landed full-time at a LortB and haven't dipped too much outside of that. 

Houston is the 4th largest city tho. So it's got that going for it. I've only been back here since November. 
That's Houston. 
What exactly did you delete?

Have you tried reinstalling?
You have to run the initial setup for bixby if you haven't done that yet. 
Hey this guy gets it. 

Anyone saying this will boost retention I'll laugh in their face. Why would I continue to work for a company and sign up for a new contract just to get another 200-400 dollars. 
Ex-employee here. Still getting company emails. 

I laughed when I got this. As much as salary is a point when it comes to retention there are way bigger problems they have to address on the adminstration side before many employees would even consider coming back. (entertainment Dept)

And for that amount it will not swing retention in their favor. Why signup for another contract for $200 bonus (Six contracts) it's not like this is some pension plan. 
Not sure if I should be concerned about the not 1, but *3* bottles/cups at your workstation. 
The real issue with the shithole comment isn't the truth of the country being s hithole as everyone here seems to be saying. 

It's the *"Why"* would anyone want to come here from... That's the issue. 

Why **wouldn't** *anyone* want to come to America, the land of immigrants? Trump doesn't see them them as people with high regard for American freedom and liberty - he sees them as not worthy to be a part of America. 

It's like when a guy says *"well you don't look American"*. Wtf is that even supposed to mean? 
What happens if you turn off the volume?

In all seriousness you're gonna have to provide more info or put something on the title. 

But I'm going on a limb and and thinking you have no idea what you're talking about and you're bothered by a lot of notifications from many apps and you only want it for SMS. 

Go into settings and then apps. And for every app you don't want to receive messages for disable them.  

Alternatively enable do not disturb, and whitelist messages or certain contacts. 
I'll do that next time. It had been out for a while so I was thinking surely the mods let it. 
isn't handwriting against sub rules?
>some cheap one from China. 

I think that's your issue right there. One from samsung is only $25-30 IIRC
And I think he means bitten and not stung
Then I'd just wait for Oreo
In gestures and voice enable the Google hotword and under voice match check enable Google hotword at any time. 
Mostly because they didn't continue all the major feautures that brought people to the X line from 2013-2016. I understand it's their mid-range but another name could've been better. 

No moto-maker and getting rid of AMOLED were major detractors for me. 
I believe it was on two occasions he landed his private plane where he shouldn't have having 2 very close calls that could've been deadly to many others including himself. 

Lots of people were saying his pilots license should be revoked and that he most likely too old to continue to fly safely.

This exactly. I'm m literally 50/50 with Kindle versus Google books. Whoever has a better price I'll normally buy there. Is Kindle sales and Google's every single often $5 coupon. 
I haven't got a survey in two years....
And they're gonna have to compete with Amazons discount on audiobooks if you buy the Kindle edition. Audio books for less than the cost of the book is fantastic.

Go into app settings on Samsung browser. Click reset defualts. Next time you open a link you'll be prompted for a new default. Set it as chrome. 
3 weeks of vacation? Damn. You in Europe?
What trade?
I don't think this is kerning. Literally just the letter "d" 
Still not working. 
Still not working. 
This is mine:
 > I will be there at the same time I don't have a car so I can get a ride to the airport on the road and will be back in the office on Monday.

>I will be there at the same for me and I can see what you can find the right person for bed now to take the day before
Which I don't understand when there's a ton of things it isn't compatible with despite the S8 regular. 

I just found out the other day that I can't use Google daydream view. *or even the Samsung Gear VR* 
But shuffle is a thing with music. It's not with a movie. 
I do think the article raises a conversation about norms and behaviors while dating  etc and generally agree with most of what's pointed. Out in this sub but I do want to bring up a few points specifically. 

The magizaing when responding to the original media attention said that they (or the woman) thought about whether this was sexual assualt or just a date gone wrong and they decided it was assault. And they stand by the original article without regret. 

Was there "misbehavoir"? Quite possible but if we see to believe Aziz then it seems everything was handled quite like adults. And there is a discussion to be had on how men (or women) play the "game" to make a hookup. 

So the claim of sexual assualt I think is far-fetched. In addition the article takes particular significance into the MeToo/TimesUp movement - something where this situation does not fit. Maybe in a *much* broader context but when it's paired with sexual assualt the intent of this article is IMO garbage. 

Lastly. The account from the woman is told completely without her own agency. It's as if she made no decisions at all the entire night besides uncomfortable reactions to gestures made my Aziz. If dinner was rushed and so bad why did you *choose* to go into his apartment. Why didn't you *choose* to leave. 

This situation he had no power over her to cause her to restrain from her own actions. 

This story and the one about James Franco from his own actively-dating-girlfriend-at-the-time is ridiculous. 

Now **is** the time to talk about feeling comfortable (especially in the workplace) and how to treat people with respect. It's not however the time to incidentally ruin someone's career for a bad date to have that conversation. 

Edit: I do see alot of counterarguments to the agency situations and want to address them. 

To the story below of the user who felt like grace when she's 19 I think is a great story. And leans into the conversation about education. I don't recall from the arcticle the age of grace but I'm assuming they are both adults with adequate sexual experiences. So I'm going out on a limb and say that she should be a little more aware and concious of her right to leave. But it's absolutely possible that she felt for whatever reason that it wasn't feasible. But then the article should represent *some degree* of agency of the woman. 

And it's the combination of the article written about a woman without agency combined with the fact it was an official date and the magazine is recording the events as *sexual assualt* that's got me feeling so wrong about it. 
Do you have a link for that?
Did you see the video of firefighters slipping on the highway?
Spotify has a terrible algorithm too. How hard is it to just generate true random via white noise etc? That's all I want, give every track a unique identifier and generate randomness without any special algorithm to predict what I want to hear or what goes well after one another. 

/Rant
Where are you? Houston's completely shut. 
I also want to piggyback and point out that this situation will only last for a single day. By the end of tomorrow conditions should be magnitudes better. 

So what if everyone takes a day off? To be safe? To not deal with *other* stupid drivers who aren't yourself. 

I worked on MLK day so fine. 
Texas is rather large and the people aaying nothing is happening aren't true for everywhere. 

The highways in Houston and just about completely shut down due to ice. 

Emergency responders are skating on the road to set up cones etc. 

At least one river (forget which) is completely uncrossable by highway or the feeder (service road).

One high ramp has had cars slide *back down* while heading up. 

1 death reported so far (homeless person from hypothermia)

Recommended nobody drive unless an emergency until 12-1pm tomorrow. 

City of Houston will operate on essential personel only. 

All buses are no longer running until a reevaluation in the morning.  Tram will continue to operate. 

Many school districts closed for the second day in a row. 

50,000 without power peaked earlier, right now appears to be closer to 14,000

If someone needs help or heat in the Houston area do not drive yourself. Call 311 for help. There are 7 warming centers in Houston still with capacity. Homless, ederly, poor and those still affected by Harvey are welcome. 
Yeah. But say you get in an accident. Now you lost your house too. 
Idk... Turning on your oven when no one is home seems like a bad idea. 
What I mean by that is I swear every post I see about stardew valley is about OPs GF playing it. 
You're starting to sound like a certain U.S. senator.
Is Stardew Valley the quintessential GF game? My GF bought it for herself on her switch and constantly plays complete evenings away. 
>Andromeda

So you're on 8.0 Beta then. 

It doesn't seem you can until 8.0
That for Android 8 only. Are you on the beta?
HEY! Whick option in Substratum themes the shade? Im using the same pack but mine are still white.

Im using package installer, settings, settings icons, system UI, Sys UI Nav, Sys UI Status Bar Ico.
Ah I see. No longer being hosted
Hmm. Can you share the link to the wallpaper you can't access?
It seems to be from (or reused) wothin this app: [PixUp Zooper - Android Apps on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bedefined.pixelforzooper&hl=en)

Edit: it might have just been used for promotion as I haven't downloaded the app, but where did you find the original image? Did they steal from this app and simulate it onto the phone?
Another me to hold which I is is through the Subtratum app. It's not free and neither are the themes but they will allow you to theme *way* more than the Samsung engine, even certain apps can be themed via overlays. 

For me I've got a mostly dark them all around cause AMOLED. And things like me settings menu no longer have rainbow icons. 

I also use Nova Launcher, Bx Action to "replace" bigsby and a custom icon pack (paid)

I came from Motorola and besides Moto Actions my phone is just like stock. 
We appear to be the only ones left in this thread. 
Seriously. This sub. There's nothing wrong with the kerning.  U and DE are the closest together but are still completely legible as separate "words". 
Yea. I was so confused like that. I was like you're his girlfriend and you gave him head because you didn't want him to be mad at you? Sure it's peer pressure and she may have been uncomfortable but then break up with him!
I also want to make one more distinction to your restaurant anaology. 

If you're fired from Chile's you can most likely still find work in restaurants and certainly in other geographical areas. 

But CK and the like aren't really fired from their company as they are fired from the entire industry. Across all geography and even time. Anything the actor made in the past, working on currently and any future association is dropped to nill.
