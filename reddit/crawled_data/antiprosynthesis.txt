He was fired mere weeks after given the position of 'Ethereum CEO' and the ETC fork happened years after. It's remarkable how he jumped on that opportunity after being publicly butthurt about Ethereum's success before though.
It's rather befitting for Charlos Hoskinson' overinflated ego. Nothing surprising to see there :)
That's the problem. Ripple embellishes the statistics by presenting them in a confusing way. https://coinmetrics.io is an independent source. Seriously, never blindly trust information coming from Ripple. They're brilliant at putting up a facade of success.
They're caused by enough people assuming the bottom is in, triggering a cascade effect. There's nothing magical about it.
The market illiteracy in this sub can be downright baffling. These are most likely shorts closing/liquidating.
Only ETH. But this chart is rather old. The ratio increased even more in ETH's favor since then.
It doesn't even show. It has about as much on-chain traffic as DOGE. See https://coinmetrics.io.
Those don't even register on that chart. Barely any on-chain volume.
Wrong statistic. XRP is similar to DOGE both in terms of transaction count and value. See https://coinmetrics.io.
I posted this chart ages ago. It's no longer relevant. Ethereum far surpasses the rest of crypto now.
Oh, come on. Are you really going to twist this into your little conspiracy theory narrative as well?
It has native support for multi-sig. It's just a smart contract.
The highlighted price level is the average estimated price exactly one year from now. It's approximately in the middle of the broad channel that ranges from ~$1,500 to ~$20,000 on that date.

This is not the same chart as I previously posted. The reason I post it is because all the new people are probably looking at zoomed in, linear scaled charts. They're basically blind. Hopefully this offers some perspective.
The problem is that Neo doesn't add any real value to the ecosystem. It's a cute story to lure in non-technical investors at best. And there are already projects like Loom Network that execute DPoS but with Ethereum as backing chain too.
Bag holders will be bag holders. Neo and the rest of the self-proclaimed 'Ethereum killers' have about zero chance of overtaking Ethereum. They're operating in a highly diluted market to start with. See Bitcoin altcoins in 2013 for reference.
My pleasure. Good luck.
Luckily I changed my mind at the $10 mark. Seeing it go x140 after that was beyond my wildest expectations though. I'm not complaining :)
LTC and BCH honestly don't belong in that list. Pointless forks/clones of BTC.
You're acting as if Carbonvote is the only way that sentiment is gauged here. The reaction on the actual proposal is a first indication, Carbonvote another. Those are unfortunately as good as it gets. I'm personally not much of a fan of these kind of referenda though, as they assume far too much competence from the voters. I'm also against a rushed fixed cap to appease to narrowminded Bitcoin maximalist narratives. This needs to be fleshed out first or a vote of any kind makes little sense.
What do you propose as alternative mechanism for gauging sentiment?
TrueUSD is also an ERC20 token, so it shares that benefit. I agree that DAI is the most interesting solution, but it's also more complex and perhaps unproven. Although it has held its stability very well during the recent volatility.
I think when pegging to USD, this kind of centralization is to be expected. I appreciate both solutions, but the pragmatist in me prefers TrueUSD for its inherent simplicity.
It is most likely weighted by trade volume of the exchange pair.
I'd say currently the best immediate option is TrueUSD (TUSD). Bittrex already has ETH/TUSD and BTC/TUSD pairs. It's USDT but audited and redeemable. No ICO either. Very no-nonsense solution.
TUSD is just an ERC20 token, so the same instructions as ETH or any ERC20 token apply.
Then you're doing it wrong. When the market is down is when people should accumulate.
Yes, 'partnerships' :)
On-chain transaction volume is closer to 500x less than Ethereum too. I'm not even sure how it is even relevant to the discussion.
Yes, the details are still up in the air to a large extent. The leitmotif is very clearly that the objective is not to 'make the rich richer' as the usual concern trolls are claiming though.
> A miner earning a 10 percent return on investment today has to reinvest to earn 9 next month. That is the nature of increasing difficulty.

You seem to assume that there will be a perpetually fixed interest rate for staking. I'm not sure about the exact reward structure of Casper, but I know it is adaptive and I presume that it thus incorporates a mechanism similar to mining difficulty in PoW. 

> As long as the same rate is applied to all stakes large and small, the terminal result is a widening gap between those who start with more and those who start with less.

I don't see any other way than applying the same rate to stakes large and small, otherwise there would be no incentive to stake large in the first place.

> Some folks with 10,000,000 ETH purchased in the genesis sale are about to lock in a perpetual compounding return with PoS.

I doubt that there are people that possess ~10% of the total estimated ETH supply. And if they would sell those ETH, they would get a perpetual compounding return through other investment vehicles, only without securing the Ethereum network in the process. Who knows, perhaps they would invest in a huge PoW mining farm instead ;)


PoW mining *is* compounding returns when reinvested. I see no way of incentivizing a system without offering percentage returns one way or the other. Perhaps your criticism would be valid in a naive PoS implementation, but, from what I've seen, Casper aims to be functionally equivalent to PoW but without the pointless redundancy/inefficiency.
No, I mean that downtime can truly result in losses. See r/ethereum/comments/7nkwzn/what_is_the_punishment_for_a_validator_node_being.
Apologies. I answered before your edits.

First of all, at least as far as I'm aware, the ETH supply issuance will be adapted to PoS, which should mitigate at least some of what you describe.

Second of all, I see nothing wrong with early investors compounding more profit. Especially since early investors are the ones that take on most of the risk. That's just basic economics. In systems where individuals can accumulate value, some will eventually come out on top. This is not something that Ethereum (or Bitcoin for that matter) can or even aims to solve. And PoS is really not worse in that regard. As an early Bitcoin miner that continuously reinvested profits, you would've ended way on top as well. And late miners or investors also have no way of catching up with that advantage.

And third, if you have more ETH than the staking threshold, whatever it will be, are you just going to plug a Raspberry Pi into your home modem and hope for the best? I mean, you are aware that downtime results in losses? And aren't you concerned about security as well? All of this comes with a risk and therefore non-neglible running cost.
Sorry, but those diminishing returns are just negative numbers on the balance sheet. Much like effective staking also has a non-neglible cost of maintaining security and uptime. I'm sure you're aware of slashing conditions.
Aren't you just describing compounding interest? And isn't the exact same true regardless of PoS or PoW if staking/mining profits are reinvested? The main difference seems to be that PoS tries to eliminate the inefficiencies in that process. Are you proposing that ROI should not be counted in percentages? And what would be the incentive of putting in a higher investment in that case? Or how would you prevent one actor to split up a higher investment? It doesn't make any sense.
When will you learn that discussions don't revolve around appointing a victor? Seriously, you have issues.
I'm just trying to have a civilized discussion here. Not win a battle. Could you get over yourself already please?
facepalm.jpg
Eh? Where did I disagree on the decentralized part exactly? I just don't see it as a fatal flaw, considering all parameters. It's the choice of the market to investigate the risk involved and act accordingly, just like one would do for exchanges.

So, what solution do you propose?
So what solutions do you propose?
Sounds like a calculated risk. Regardless of that, the minimum staking threshold has not even been set yet, and the 1000 ETH number that is being thrown around stems from a time where ETH was only a 50-100th of the current USD price. Not only that, but this was merely put forward as a guesstimate, with the stated goal of reducing the threshold over time (10 ETH was mentioned). So declaring Casper DOA is unnecessary concern trolling, which is unfortunately a common pattern in your rhetoric. What solutions do you propose?
What about decentralized staking pools like www.rocketpool.net?
It's a confirmed coinmarketcap bug. Supply changed to 1/1000th, but this wasn't reflected yet.
I think that in case of Steem and Bitshares (and also Ripple), the transaction count is not really a sensible statistic. You could compare it to counting every executed EVM instruction as a transaction, which makes little sense. That said, both transaction value in USD and transaction count are rather flawed metrics on their own.
Actually it does. The amount of value transacted by Steem and Bitshares is so low, it doesn't even show in this top.
Got reminded of your comment :)
Xain is an Ethereum based project.
Those were only the latest additions. See https://entethalliance.org/members for a full list.
Look at OP's comment history for the answer to his intentions. Another concern troll.
Damn, I sure hope you're not holding BTC then.
Are you aware that Ethereum doesn't need SegWit to begin with and that Lightning is nearly identical to Raiden, the most primitive layer 2 scaling solution on Ethereum? Are you also aware that Ethereum processes 4-5x as many transactions as Bitcoin at a fraction of the fees, way faster confirmation times, and all without sacrificing security or decentralization? The facts do not agree with your narrative.
Sounds like 0xbitcoin is a token that exists to satisfy a religious belief system :)
That is not in any way unique to Cardano. Any language can easily compile to EVM too. Heck, any language could even cross-compile to Solidity rather trivially. Such statements are only there to draw in the uninformed.
The chance of EOS or NEO growing beyond temporary niches is incredibly small. I wouldn't worry.
There are only two with actual on-chain transaction volume. Fees are a function of that.
Any programming language can already be compiled to the EVM too. Nobody makes the effort of writing a compiler frontend for existing languages simply because it doesn't make a lot of sense. There is no demand essentially.
That doesn't make any sense. Let's say there is a (liquid) ETH/USDT trading pair. That means that a buyer has USDT and wants ETH, and a seller has ETH and wants USDT. When their orders match on an exchange, USDT and ETH simple moves between buyer and seller. There is no creation or destruction of ETH or USDT involved in such a transaction.
I am not a 'Bitcoin person'. In fact I haven't held any BTC (or any of its forks/clones) since 2016.
And what indicates that that is not happening?
Where else would you buy? Obviously the demand for USDT is highest during dips.
So what should the seller of that crypto receive exactly? Dust?
Agree. They need to provide a more complete audit.
I agree that there should be a full audit rather than a partial one. And I also agree that something is not entirely right with Tether. I don't see it as likely that they've been printing fake money though. And the numbers don't back that up either.
I'm not saying this kind of grand scale fraud is impossible. I'm merely stating that it's highly improbable and that there is no evidence that points to such a thing in this case. It is based on wild conjecture by a single actor.
And this proves what exactly?
And the publicly known people behind Tether and Bitfinex enjoy spending time in prison? They're running a highly successful business and clearly have personal wealth. I don't see how them jeopardizing their business and its employees, as well as their own quality of life, benefits anyone. Ergo it's highly unlikely that they're just printing fake money. Why is it so hard to believe that new money is simply flowing into crypto?
And this is supposed to prove what exactly?
No, because it would require multiple people colluding, which is inherently risky. And it is pretty much by design a scheme that ends badly for all actors involved. And this tends to be a recurring flaw in the reasoning (or lack thereof) of conspiracy theorists. They prefer the least likely explanation because it happens to confirm whatever bias they have.

That said, I think Tether is not squeeky clean either. It's just not the insolvent money printing machine bitfinexed tries to describe it as. The few true points in his hyperbole narrative get lost in the pile of lies and conjecture.
The math that new Tether is printed before the crypto market cap moves up? That is exactly how Tether works. New capital enters to invest in crypto, not park on an exchange.
In his case a lot of it is either false or carefully cherry picked to perpetuate a farfetched narrative. I'm surprised so few seem to notice the obvious signs.
It's definitely far more likely than them printing fake money out of thin air. That would be a scheme that knows no winners.
It's not an independent report. Note the anonymity of the author and the similarity in writing and argumentation to bitfinexed. The evidence overwhelmingly points to him being the author. He is literally the only source of all this FUD.
Have you considered that the most logical explanation of Tether being created is simply the influx of new capital?
I invite people to look at my comment history. I make no secret of where my interests lie, but I don't see any FUD there.
What makes it so clear for you?
r/iamverysmart?
www.tradingview.com is unbeatable. Make sure to use logarithmic scaling.
Have you even read through his tweets? The guy is an attention seeking lunatic that started his FUD battle after selling BTC at a very low price. Criticism is good, as long as it is based on facts.

And I haven't held any BTC since around 2016. I consider it a relic from the past.
FUD such as what exactly?
My FUD account? Did you mean to direct that to u/AtlasRand1?
This wouldn't have anything to do with your constant stream of lies and conjecture, up to even producing reports under a different identity? It's one thing to demand an audit from Tether, but you were outright spreading FUD.
More or less :)
https://i.imgflip.com/241ohg.jpg
You might want to backtest on the chart next time whether selling when ETH is down 60-70% is a good idea. Historically those times have been by far the best buy opportunities.
To whip out a somewhat tired platitude that rings true more than ever: buy when there is blood in the street, even if it is your own. It's the people that sell at these levels who will be crying and wailing when ETH inevitably reverses violently.
ETC is a chair.
It's not cheap. It has ~1000x more total supply than ETH.
Sure, see https://trustlines.network.
I hold only ZRX. I'm not much of an active trader/diversifier when it comes to crypto. ETH is just too safe and rewarding a hold to stray far from it.
Actually, there is a non-fungible token standard on Ethereum (ERC721). It's used for CryptoKitties, but I think we'll see some very interesting pegs to real assets in the future.
I'm mostly looking forward to the rage. Those people have stifled progress for long enough.
I hold some ZRX myself. With the way 0x has already established itself as a standard for decentralized exchange, I'm not too worried. Local volatility is part of the game. I'm still over 90% allocated into ETH though.
My assumption is that it gets its price info from an API provided by www.coinmarketcap.com.
The website contained malware. ETZ is a dead obvious scam.
I doubt that's his target audience. I'd assume that he wants to reach more than a handful of people.

So you measure fundamentals by most recently pumped? Do you want me to make a list of all the shitcoins that pumped into the top 5 in the past?
Please don't be dishonest. It's only the fifth largest by a single, temporary metric. How many transactions per day does the Cardano blockchain process? How many third party developers are building on top of Cardano? How many enterprises are building on top of it? The answer to all these questions comes down to near zero.
So is Ethereum. See https://github.com/ewasm. This kind of off-chain tooling is not exactly rocket science, and the largest ecosystem tends to always get the most broad support.
This is exactly the same for the EVM. It's not some sort of special feature.
That's not how it works. Smart contracts are stored and executed as EVM bytecode.
It measures on-chain transaction count and off-chain trade volume indeed. The on-chain transaction count is an even better measure of utility, since it shows both utility and capacity.
Yes, trading volume is off-chain. This pie chart is on-chain transaction volume only, which is a far better indicator of actual utility.
I absolutely love C++ and it's my language of choice by a pretty large margin, but even I think that it's not well suited for this purpose.
It has technical and/or game theoretic reasons, but I don't recall exactly.
NEO/ETH is around the same level as when I made that post. <shrug>
It's a decentralized pool, so I assume that is exactly what it aims to avoid.
Yes, one magnifies the other indeed.
I think you missed the word 'decentralized' there.
I haven't investigated it deeply, but it's definitely interesting. Its viability might depend for a large part on the minimum staking threshold of Casper though.
Decentralized staking pools are possible. See https://www.rocketpool.net for instance.
No, not only due to volatility. Also due to lack of demand, exorbitant fees and slow transactions. Bitcoin is a retarded dinosaur compared to the likes of Ethereum.
Nevermind. Educate yourself. Thank me later.
Frankly, not that much. The tech is really nothing groundbreaking. It doesn't stand out in any meaningful way in the long list of self-proclaimed 'Ethereum killers' out there, such as Ardor, Lisk, Tezos, NEO, Stratis, Qtum, EOS, Aeternity, ETC, ... In fact several of those make Cardano look like a pretty weak money grab in comparison.
I'd say less weird than believing pretty much anything that comes out of Charles Hoskinson's mouth. Are you not familiar with his history?
Sounds exactly like Ethereum but without the ecosystem.
It's just a slight variation of DPoS. Nothing to see there.
It shows that this is before your time. ETC was an opportunistic power grab by Hoskinson and Silbert. I was there when it got created. In fact I was even against the DAO hard fork, yet still stayed the hell away from ETC because of the obvious red flags.
Uhm, Bitcoin isn't really mined with GPUs anymore. Ethereum is the main culprit most likely, and it is transitioning away from the ridiculously wasteful proof of work mining. Be patient :)
r/ethtrader 
I think the first ICO was as early as august 2015 with Augur. The Ethereum platform itself never started launching ICOs though. It merely provided a fungible token standard, which implicitly made it easy for anyone to create a token and thus an ICO.
The fixed cap argument immediately exposes someone as economically illiterate. Tell them that inflationary rate matters, not fixed cap. And that Bitcoin will be inflationary until well into the next century.
They may try to copy/paste them, but that will become harder and harder.
Thanks. The ASCII art alone should provide sufficient incentive ;)
From what I gathered, the Ethereum foundation kept 11mn ETH, which comes down to ~10% of the estimated total supply.
Ripple 100%.

Bitcoin and Monero 0% I suppose, though one could argue whether early miners didn't have a massive advantage that practically equals a premine, so I'd classify it as unknown.

Ethereum 11mn ETH I believe, so approximately 10% of the total estimated supply.

Please correct me if I'm wrong.
I believe it was initially 12% of the supply, but a lot of that has already been sold over time, at least if I recall correctly.
Ripple had a 100% premine (no mining whatsoever more accurately) and 60-80% is still held by Ripple and founders. An estimated +90% is held by a handful of colluding entities, namely Ripple and partners. Both Bitcoin and Monero were mostly early mined.
It's not so much about terrible as it is about scammy in this case, but to each their own :)
Several great ones are listed here: https://consensys.net/ventures/spokes

There is also 0x and OmiseGo for decentralized exchange, and MakerDAO that provides an alternative stablecoin implementation to the unaudited Tether.

This is really just a quick grab from the top of my head. There are several very interesting projects brewing, and quite a few of them very close to hitting the market too. See https://www.ethfinex.com for instance for an example of 0x decentralized exchange by Bitfinex.
RSK is an incredibly centralized construct though. I mean, there are only 25 validators, each permissioned by RSK Labs. Dapps have to be whitelisted by RSK Labs as well. And 20% of all transaction fees go straight to RSK Labs too. Even known Bitcoin proponents like Peter Todd consider it a joke. And this seems to be the sidechain model that Bitcoin is trying to go for across the board.
The people behind these projects define the motive and direction. If a scammy proponent does not register as a red flag, I think you need to reconsider your process of performing due diligence.

That said, having looked at Cardano a bit on the technical side, there's really nothing groundbreaking there. It does some things slightly 'better', but there's just not much to see over the many 'Ethereum killers' already out there, such as Waves, Stratis, NEO, Ardor, EOS, Expanse, ETC, Aeternity, Qtum, Tezos, ... It's really just another relatively uninspired DPoS blockchain that needs to rely on marketing narratives and hype to gain importance in the market, and I see no significant incentive for developers to build on it. And it's years behind in terms of core development as well. Very unlikely candidate for more than some price volatility, at least by my analysis.
That premine was also distributed through an ICO and then redistributed further on the market over time. Ethereum has better wealth distribution statistics than Bitcoin for instance (though one could argue that ETH can easily be distributed over several addresses of course).

Centralization of the foundation is somewhat of a fallacy. Any supposed power they have is there by merit. They are probably scrutinized with as much, if not more severity than the Bitcoin developers. And since updates are brought forward as hard forks, it's still the broad market that decides whether such updates are accepted or not. Just as is the case for Bitcoin. So that argumentation seems built on a fundamental misunderstanding of blockchain governance. There is no such thing as full decentralization either way. It's a state of convergence that needs to be maintained actively.
You're cherry picking one instance. And you have downright terrible track record as well. You must've sold very low.
I don't have quotes at my fingertips, but here goes:

Denying the usefulness of stateful, Turing complete smart contracts is a common one, even though there are several obviously useful dapps out there, and Ethereum has the most vibrant developer ecosystem in crypto by a large margin.

Another one is disregarding Ethereum as only an ICO factory, which shows a pretty fundamental shortsightedness in not recognizing the power of tokenization, as well as an unjust conflation of Ethereum's ease of creating token contracts with the users of that utility.

And then there's the usual FUD like 'Ethereum is immutable and centralized around Vitalik!', which shows a lack of insight into how blockchain hard forks work, as well as spinning a strong asset for Ethereum into a liability.

Irrational reactions like that tell me most of all that competing by merit is no longer possible for them, so they resort to attack and sabotage instead. Even Bitcoin Core developers dare to bring such petty arguments to the table, which is rather telling.
And now it's prominent Bitcoin maximalists that make these famous statements about Ethereum. Technology moves fast.
Very interesting stuff. Thanks.
Ah, in that case I skimmed it a bit too fast. I'm guessing that a raw EVM implementation of the 1-to-N contract would be unbeatable though, and actually feasable due to its simplicity as well (if that's not what an LLL/Solidity/Viper/... compiler would already produce to begin with of course).
I looked at the user's comment history before responding. As amazing as it may seem, he was actually being serious.
According to r/ethereum/comments/7r3q71/_/dsvqanj the gas limit can be quite significantly reduced by batching, so definitely seems worthwhile.

Your last paragraph is interesting though. I wonder whether there is a sensible sweet spot that can be determined at runtime, much like is done for gas price by https://ethgasstation.info for instance.
Very interesting. I think you may also want to check this discussion: r/ethfinex/comments/7qoui9/are_you_going_to_implement_batched_withdrawals_to. Somebody wrote it in pure EVM there from what I can see.
Exactly. And even if it's just a little better in terms of gas cost, at scale that could make for a significant difference.
The smart contract itself is no doubt trivial, and so is the additional local code required on the exchange side, albeit probably less so. But it is an effort that implies potential risk nonetheless. So this post is more about trying to get exchanges to actually do it.
Are you saying that a system should be made purposely inefficient to only include the already fortunate? I don't think you understand what gives a blockchain its intrinsic value.
Very interesting. I've posted about this same thing just yesterday as well: r/ethereum/comments/7r3q71. Added a link to this thread in that post now as well.
Here is the post now: r/ethereum/comments/7r3q71
I don't want to hijack this thread, but what are your thought on this suggestion with regard to 1-to-N transaction batching? r/ethereum/comments/7r3q71
Reduce exposure from shitcoins you mean?
Ethereum is a sure thing really. I haven't found contenders that can be considered more than short term gambles so far. A lot of them are trying to play on the emotions of people who feel like having missed out on Ethereum, even though it hasn't even properly started :)
I've learned to avoid people and projects surrounded by red flags. One mistake is forgivable, but this is an unmistakable pattern.
Actually, ERC777 seems to be a more suitable followup to ERC20.
[My chart](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/400713619014287370/402955029029453825/unknown.png) has shifted a little bit in the meantime.
[Here you go.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/400713619014287370/402955029029453825/unknown.png)

It's not linear by the way. This is a logarithmic chart.
This belongs in r/ethtrader.
That's actually not what happens. When you buy ETH on Coinbase, they merely update their centralized database so that amount of ETH is assigned to your account. It doesn't touch the Ethereum blockchain in any way (there is a bit more to it, and in rare cases it probably will touch the Ethereum blockchain to rebalance its internal accounts, but you get the point).
You might want to back test that on the chart first before confidently exclaiming the least likely outcome as obvious truth :)
The EVM is programming language agnostic and writing a compiler frontend is not a huge job. That said, due to the specific nature of the EVM, it makes very little sense to use existing programming languages, and I'd even argue that it's a rather significant security and overall performance risk in most cases.
The former is on-chain transaction volume (utility). The latter is off-chain exchange volume (trading).

The daily USD value is pretty variable. See https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/sentinusd-btc-eth.html#log for a chart of where it's going. Note that this metric alone is not that meaningful. It could be combined with that with the fact that Ethereum processes 4-5x as many transactions as Bitcoin to give a more complete picture.
China banned crypto... again (a running joke by now). This might launch us sideways for a month before rallying again. $850 seems to be the absolute bottom, if we even reach that. If anything, it might push people to seek more safety, moving capital from the shit/gamble coins into ETH.
I'd urge you to recreate that chart on www.tradingview.com yourself. It will be highly educational. Maybe my next posted chart will be a live one, but I can't guarantee it.

How would you seize Ethereum exactly? :)
That's a rather ridiculous assumption. The only true part about that statement is the fact that ETH changes hands. The rest is conjecture.
Yeah, I'm thinking of making a dedicated post, reminding of this 1-to-N transaction batching being possible for exchanges tomorrow, after I check some exchange withdrawals for the use of such contract. This could reduce traffic and fees a lot potentially.
This is false. See also r/ethereum/comments/4fija2/_/d297dhb. Ethereum allows multi-out transactions just fine and in a more elegant, generalized fashion even. It would be nice if exchanges would actually use it for batching transactions though.
Inexplicable choice. Sonstobo manages to be just as toxic.
Everybody is a genius in a bull market. I don't see NEO surviving the inevitable blood letting.

That lacks ERC777 unfortunately.
Well, he's right (though some context would have been more prudent, hence [my answer to his tweet](https://twitter.com/antiprosynth/status/948912256900849664)). Ask him whether the same is true for Bitcoin and he will most likely be far more critical even. Crypto is still in its infancy. The difference is in admitting that and actively working on solving the challenges presented versus defending the status quo in hubris. Why do you think he is one of the lead researchers for Ethereum?
I think you might want to read this: https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7qckfb/_/dsoivu3
Government backing is a disadvantage if anything. The reason to pursue the inefficient design that is a blockchain in the first place is decentralization and trustlessness, which is rather orthogonal to government backing. Truly amazed by the lack of basic knowledge of crypto investors these days.
I personally prefer www.myetherwallet.com or www.metamask.io.
Which one? There are quite a few out there, each created by different developer teams.
Oh, indeed. In that case, apologies. Didn't mean anything by it.
Perhaps more accurate is that it was incomplete. Sharding is just one of the scaling efforts. Possibly one of the most drastic on-chain efforts though, admittedly.
To each their own. Just don't complain that nobody warned you.
See r/ethereum/comments/7qckfb/the_ethereum_blockchain_now_processes_about_as/dsosy08
Unless the exchange is slow to process your withdrawal/deposit, there is no reason to believe it should take hours. In fact, exchanges tend to overpay quite significantly for Ethereum transactions, so the on-chain transaction should process in mere minutes. Keep an eye on https://ethgasstation.info for on-chain transaction fees and their estimated confirmation times.
What credibility?
I think you need to be upset with Nvidia, not Ethereum miners. Nvidia has to adjust their supply to meet the demand.
While you're correct overall, I think we're going to see gas prices go down first. Ethereum software clients and exchanges are implementing proper gas prices estimation (based on ethgasstation in fact). Currently the market tends to overpay rather significantly for transactions, in large part due to those overestimated client defaults, but also due to exchanges using a too low amount of Ethereum addresses for their withdrawals.
Ethereum will be transitioning to Casper (proof of stake) over the coming year(s), so there will be an excess of GPUs on the market soon enough ;)
No, but I think this statistic is remarkable and deserves to be shared with the larger crypto community. Currently Ethereum processes far more transactions than all other decentralized blockchains combined, as well as more value in those transactions. Those are pretty astounding and irrefutable metrics.

And I have not performed any vote manipulation whatsoever. What makes you assume as such?
I use dark markets occasionally (for benign things, no worries) and XMR adoption there is extremely low. Only a couple of smaller markets support it. The largest markets still operate predominantly through BTC. In my estimation I also already took into account that Monero transactions could be 2x larger in value than Ethereum transactions. It still amounts to less than 1% of Ethereum regardless of that. Even if Monero transactions would be 10x larger than Ethereum, it would still be less than 5%.
I welcome anyone to look at my comment history to verify that your assertions are incorrect.
Transaction fees and throughput are a function of the amount of transactions being processed. Naming blockchains that have about 0.5-1% of Ethereum's transaction count is therefore completely pointless.
That is simply false. This person doesn't have a clue when he blankly states that 'Ethereum transactions are 5x the size'.
Fees are a bit higher (currently less than a dollar for a very fast transaction, see https://ethgasstation.info). Performance is about the same. Nobody is claiming that Ethereum magically solves all scalability challenges today. It has the strong lowest layer and the developer mindshare to do so though.
No, my chart actually excludes token transfers. I think his chart just has a different time window, which smooths out the recent increase.
Yes, that is certainly the goal that is being worked towards. With Casper and Sharding it may even be achieved on-chain. Off-chain scaling in the form of generalized state channel solutions like Plasma and (Micro)Raiden will also be essential though. I think that, given managed expectations and appropriate patience, we're in for a treat with Ethereum in the coming months to years.
See r/ethereum/comments/7qckfb/the_ethereum_blockchain_now_processes_about_as/dsoivu3

I'm rather certain. That site merely measures 'coins' in a rather generic way. If you want absolute certainty, you could try and contact them for clarification.
Sorry, but the facts simply contradict this narrative. I'm not going to bother debunking what has been tirelessly debunked countless times now. I never cease to be amazed by how someone can still defend Bitcoin with a straight face though.
We do know the transaction count though. It's less than 0.5% of Ethereum (see www.bitinfocharts.com). I think we can safely assume that the transacted value on Monero doesn't exceed 1% of Ethereum. So it wouldn't appear on this chart anyway.
See r/ethereum/comments/7qckfb/_/dsoivu3
It's not a choice. This chart was just taken from www.bitinfocharts.com.
Transaction count shows scalability though. And since transaction value is also far higher, it seems irrefutable that Ethereum is dominating the crypto space in terms of utility metrics. And this chart doesn't even include token transactions.
I noticed that indeed. And this chart doesn't even include token transactions.
Ethereum is a complete superset of Bitcoin that functions far better already, has more transactions, both in number and value, and most of the developer ecosystem. Twist and turn it as you like, but I don't see the point in keeping Bitcoin around at this point.
Solutions to what?
No, this is a scam. Don't click on any links relating to it, because they have proven to be malicious.
Ethereum didn't "crumble". And miners have increased the gas limit in the meantime. There was a brief spike in traffic and fees went up during that time, but that was basically it. People were mostly complaining because they were underpaying compared to the current state of the network. Something which is also currently being fixed in the form of proper gas price estimates in software clients.

That said, there's a reason there is such a broad scaling roadmap. Adoption is just starting to outpace that roadmap. So manage your expectations and expect occasionally higher (but still very low) fees in the meantime. Always check https://ethgasstation.info for estimated fees and their transaction times.
See r/ethereum/comments/7qckfb/_/dsoivu3
It might include the fees of token transactions, which are denoted in ETH, but a lot of tokens aren't even traded on exchanges, so they simply don't have a USD value to begin with :)
Well, that's not entirely accurate. On-chain there is Casper and Sharding. Off-chain there is Plasma, Raiden, MicroRaiden, and other variations of generalized state channels.
Yes, it's privacy oriented. Ethereum will have similar functionality (but as a more generalized abstraction) in the future as well. Primary focus at the moment seems to be scalability though.
It's actually up to $31bn now even. See www.bitinfocharts.com.
Note that ERC20 token transactions aren't even considered in this chart yet.
This chart only shows on-chain transaction volume, not off-chain exchange trade volume.
Actually, token transactions aren't even included in this chart.
So the solution to fixing Bitcoin is not using it? I guess I'm actively contributing to the solution then.
You're confusing off-chain exchange trade volume (coinmarketcap) with on-chain transactions.
I'll fix. Very sorry about that.
You are conflating unaudited smart contracts with flaws in the protocol. They are completely separate though.

Those dirtiest miners are just moving their enterprise abroad. PoW mining will always suffer from locality and thus also local influence.

I don't see Bitcoin and its many forks and clones amounting to much by 2019 personally. It's dinosaur technology, with or without blocksize increase bandaid.

For sure. Good luck!
Bitcoin's exchange trade volume (which is off-chain) is generally still higher than Ethereum. People just use Ethereum for actual utility, such as transferring value.
I guess the same could be asked about Bitcoin itself at this point :)
See r/ethereum/comments/7qckfb/_/dsoivu3
Monero obfuscates transaction values. Transaction count is known though. It processes around 0.5% of Ethereum's transaction count. So I think it's safe to assume that Monero processes at most 1% of Ethereum's value in USD. See www.bitinfocharts.com.
That's BCH and LTC actually. Not that it makes much of a difference what these Bitcoin forks and clones are doing in the grand scale of things.
I'm sorry for your loss.
> What happens to ETH today if Vitalik disappears?

The Ethereum development consists of quite a lot of people, but I'll let him answer that for himself: https://youtu.be/KlIFQ7GIdBA

> we shouldn't pretend ETH's fees aren't skyrocketing as well

Currently it costs ~$0.2 for an ETH transaction to confirm in less than 5 minutes. And Ethereum processes 4-5x as many transactions as Bitcoin. And all without sacrificing decentralization or security. See https://ethgasstation.info for fees and their estimated transaction times, and www.bitinfocharts.com for transaction count. So I'd say the lowest layer of Ethereum is magnitudes more solid than Bitcoin.

> or that there aren't scalability issues inherent in the current design

There are inherent scalability challenges for sure. And the Ethereum developers are the first to admit them as well. But they're also diligently working on on-chain and off-chain solutions to those problems. And their progress can be scrutinized and verified.
Token transactions are excluded from this chart actually. I think that with those included, Ethereum dominance could reach well beyond 75% even.
There are several technical resources online that can be scrutinized on Casper. Its design seems solid and not at all overcomplicated to me.

I consider transitioning to PoS a necessity. PoW is inherently wasteful and is actively damaging the environment. It also causes centralization based on country policies and private mining companies.
Ok, I'll have to explain it then.

Bitcoin won't reach its cap until well into the next century. It will be inflationary until that time. The same is true for Ethereum in that it will have decreasing inflation over time. The difference is that the cap is soft and inexact, but it's unlikely to ever exceed ~110mn units. ETH is in fact closer to reaching its cap than BTC, and towards and after Casper release, ETH will most likely be more deflationary than BTC for several reasons, such as staking locking up supply.

In short, it's not fixed cap that matters, it's inflationary rate that does. And ETH performs on par with BTC there.
Ethereum processes more than 50x the USD value that Ripple processes. And only a fraction of the latter even represents XRP transactions. It doesn't even register on this chart.

Also, try finding proof of actual adoption beyond tests and pilots. You'll come back sorely disappointed. Ripple is a facade.
It includes all the transactions processed on the actual blockchain, excluding token transactions (ERC20, ERC721, ...). It does also not include exchange trade volume, because that happens predominantly off-chain.
Yup, never trust words. Always check facts and metrics. Crypto is full of bullshit unfortunately.
Neither is Ethereum. Its governance is in fact very similar to Bitcoin. What makes you think it's more centrally managed than Bitcoin? And even if it would be, why would that necessarily be bad thing in the emerging stages of its development? So far it has proven to work out extremely well.
That is false. I won't bother explaining basic economics for the 100th time though. Perhaps somebody is willing to debunk this fallacy once more for me.
CNBC's Dumb Money in particular has been bafflingly stupid.
No, ERC20 token transactions still have their fees paid in ETH. Note that these transactions aren't even included in this chart yet.
Just a more solid design from the ground up, and a healthier development mindset that allows for innovation.

The specifics are best left to somebody else to explain succinctly. It's a combination of factors.
That's the wrong metric. That's off-chain exchange trade volume. This chart is actual on-chain transaction volume. Look at 'XRP Ledger Payment Volume' on that same page.
There is mining, just like Bitcoin. The plan is to transition to proof of stake in the coming time though. Read this for a glimpse into the future: https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ
Not enough volume to appear on that chart. Funnily enough it's about on par with XRP in that regard :)
I fail to see any advantage in what you just described. Could you elaborate further on each point?
Only transaction count is known. Monero processes around 0.5% of Ethereum's transactions. So I think it's safe to say that the transacted USD value won't exceed 1% of Ethereum. That means that it would not or barely be visible on this chart anyway. See www.bitinfocharts.com.
Hard to say, but I'm sure some of it is. A valid use case either way.
Actually, not complicated at all. The first phase of Casper will just be a set of smart contracts. It's incredibly elegant in many ways.
In their defense, it takes some knowledge and experience to be able to evaluate the fundamentals in crypto. And with projects like Cardano, Ripple, Tron, ... targeting their marketing specifically at those without that knowledge and experience, that price movement is understandable. Unfortunately it's also those people that will suffer the most when the inevitable blood letting happens and they find themselves stuck in the AOL/Myspace/Pets.com rather than the Google/Amazon/eBay of crypto. It doesn't help that a lot of the new, dumb money sloshing around in crypto also happens to suffer from extreme Dunning-Kruger effect.
To each their own :)
Monero doesn't even process 0.5% of Ethereum's transaction count though. It wouldn't even be visible on this chart most likely.
Your perspective seems to be that of an outsider that is relatively new to crypto. I can assure you that Ethereum is by all means a complete and superior superset of Bitcoin. That's not a superlative. It's a verifiable fact. Try to read up on the technicals of Ethereum and you should understand why.
That dominance is decreasing rapidly though. I personally haven't had to go through BTC since 2016.
Most Ripple transactions are valueless. The amount of actual payments is only around 140,000. And only a part of that even uses XRP. See https://xrpcharts.ripple.com/#/metrics.
The on-chain fees aren't. Exchanges sometimes overcharge for ETH transactions though.
True. It's very low and would not or barely be visible anyway though. See https://xrpcharts.ripple.com. The whole Ripple ledger processes about as much USD value as DOGE does.
Such as?

Ethereum is currently at ~$0.2 for confirmation in less than 5 minutes. And all while processing 4-5x as many transactions as Bitcoin, and without sacrificing decentralization or security. Sorry, but even with SegWit, Bitcoin cannot be reasonably defended any longer. Its lowest layer is just dinosaur technology at this point.
Ethereum processes over 50x the USD value of Ripple, and 4-5x as many transactions as Bitcoin. Yet its market cap is only half that of Bitcoin. I don't think selling is what you want to be doing here, but to each their own.
Well, sponsored by www.bitinfocharts.com, which is where the chart comes from.
That's not what I intended with this post. But I don't see much use for Bitcoin with the complete and superior superset that is Ethereum in the picture either.
Exactly. Ripple is little more than a facade.
Hard to say. I know EtherDelta is a big one. Somebody should try to write a blockchain analysis tool for this perhaps. Perhaps the existing tools on www.etherscan.io might reveal some things.
Trading related is no doubt a large share. Not trading itself though, as that happens largely off-chain on exchanges. Decentralized exchange (EtherDelta) is also a big one. General value transfer as well. It's hard to quickly get a complete overview of the activity to be honest.

Transaction fees don't apply for exchange orders, because those happen completely off-chain, in the exchange's centralized database. Only deposit/withdrawal to/from exchanges happens on-chain. And there the exchange charges additional fees on top of the network fees as well.
Because they are completely different metrics. Coinmarketcap shows exchange trade volume, which is completely off-chain. Bitinfocharts shows actual on-chain transaction volume.
This charts is not about the number of transactions. Work on your reading comprehension.
Yes, the transition will happen very gradually for that reason, moving over hybrid PoW/PoS first. I think exciting times are ahead. Can't wait to have a general purpose blockchain that is environmentally friendly and unbound by geopolitics.
There are sensible ranges you can safely assume to be in the realm of the possible. Even if transaction sizes would be twice as large as Ethereum, Monero would still only process less than 1% of the value.
I think you meant to post that somewhere else :)
ETH far outperforms Bitcoin and its forks and clones as a currency actually. Where did you get the idea that it wouldn't be optimized as such?
Are you sure you're not accidentally confusing the ETC slice with the LTC slice (which is also inexplicably large for its inherent pointlessness)?
There aren't really any banks that use Ripple software to begin with. There have only been tests and pilots that were most likely paid for and executed by Ripple themselves. They're a marketing firm that sells beanie babies.
That's not what this chart is about. Work on your reading comprehension.
It's not. ETH transfers over 50x the value of XRP on its ledger. See www.bitinfocharts.com and https://xrpcharts.ripple.com for verification.

I didn't add or remove anything. This was taken verbatim from www.bitinfocharts.com.
I won't go through the futile endeavour of trying to convince a conspiracy theorist with facts. Good luck.
It was the only chart available on www.bitinfocharts.com :)
Ok, first of all, market cap matters, not price. Market cap = price*supply. See www.coinmarketcap.com. Never buy/sell a coin due its low/high nominal price..

I think ETH is by far the safest crypto to hold, by a huge margin. It's severely undervalued compared to Bitcoin, seeing as it literally beats it by almost every metric, yet has only half the market cap.

Good luck!
I think you might want to have a very careful read through this: r/ethereum/comments/7k6wos/_/drck6h8
It's indeed still in development. But any such change occurs through a hard fork, which I'm sure you know needs to get accepted by the broad market, and cannot be enforced by a centralized entity.
The difference is that the Fed randomly decides inflation, where in Ethereum it is set mathematically, just like Bitcoin.

It's your choice to buy whatever you want. Just ensure it's based on a factual evaluation rather than hearsay narrative.
It wasn't offered on www.bitinfocharts.com, but according to https://xrpcharts.ripple.com, Ripple only processes ~$500mn, where Ethereum processes ~$25bn. That's a 50x difference, so it would barely even register on this chart to begin with.
Ethereum is significantly different. It's a general purpose, programmable blockchain. Essentially a superset of any other blockchain.

By what standard do you measure ETH as being cheap? I mean, I agree that it's vastly undervalued, but just wondering by what logic you've arrived at that conclusion.
That's not how that works.
No, this doesn't even include token transactions. Possibly the fees of those transactions may be included, but that should barely change the chart.
Those metrics aren't really related in a meaningful way. Though one could argue that Ethereum is severely undervalued compared to its utility metrics and overwhelming developer ecosystem.
Its weakness is that it adds nothing over Bitcoin. It's a literal copy with some very minor tweaks. There is no added value in such a project.
First of all, fixed cap does not matter, inflationary rate does. Ethereum is very similar to Bitcoin in that regard and will even be more deflationary towards the transition to Casper (proof of stake). Bitcoin will be inflationary well into the 22nd century too, if it still even meaningfully exists by that time.

Second, all XRP have already been created instantly by Ripple. They're still holding 60-80% of the total supply. It's pretty much a white collar scam in my book.
It's a weak clone of Bitcoin. It adds nothing to the ecosystem and suffers from the exact same weaknesses as Bitcoin.
ERC721 (CryptoKitties), ERC20 and other tokens aren't even included in this chart actually.
True, it remains to be seen whether this chart holds. With Ethereum consistently processing 4-5x the amount of Bitcoin's transactions, I'd say it's a matter of time until it's consistently higher though. Also note that this chart doesn't even include ERC20 token transactions, so it's probably already consistently higher with that volume added.
I didn't choose the chart type. It's taken from www.bitinfocharts.com.
Sure, but there are sensible ranges one can assume.
LTC's percentage is mostly historical I think. I think most insiders would agree that it has little to no future.
About time too. Bitcoin is holding back progress with its irrational dominance.
See the front page of www.bitinfocharts.com. This development is quite recent, so perhaps your chart is averaged over a larger time window?
Seeing as Monero only processes ~5,000 tx/day and Ethereum ~1,200,000 tx/day, I think it's safe to assume it's less than 0.5% of Ethereum. So it wouldn't even register on that chart.
Ripple processes only around 2% of the value Ethereum processes, so you can safely assume that its transaction count is heavily inflated. It's a barely used, highly centralized network with a carefully constructed marketing narrative, but lacking the utility metrics to support that facade.
They're not far apart, but exchanges tend to overpay for Ethereum transactions. Possibly because they use too few Ethereum addresses and are scared of network fee spikes delaying the transaction queue. It's a balancing problem on their end really.
No, just debunking falsehoods, with verifiable proof.
LTC has the luxury of barely having on-chain transaction volume :)
ERC20 token transactions aren't even included in this chart actually. With those included the domination would be even more pronounced. And probably by a lot too.

Sounds also like you vastly overpaid for that token transaction. Such transaction shouldn't cost more than $0.5 to get confirmed in mere minutes. See https://ethgasstation.info.

I wouldn't take Cardano's 'blockchain v3' sales fluff too seriously. There's very little meat behind that project to warrant its existence, and Charles Hoskinson is known for past dishonesty and dubious motive.
This metric on its own is indeed incomplete. Combine it with the fact that Ethereum also processes more transactions than the rest of decentralized blockchains together and the picture is far more complete.

Being used for facilitating trading is a genuine use case though. Please do note that exchange trades are not included in this metric, since they occur off-chain.
Yup. Stupidity and/or dishonesty basically.
The site didn't offer it. However https://xrpcharts.ripple.com does, and it shows that XRP processes USD value on par with DOGE. Ethereum processes ~50x more value. So XRP would not even appear on this chart anyway.
I don't think you understand how blockchains (calling Stellar that is a bit of a stretch though) work. During stress tests they're basically paying themselves, so no cost is incurred.
Wrong. Around $0.2 fee at the moment. Average fees indicate most of all that people (mostly exchanges) are overpaying. See https://ethgasstation.info for actual Ethereum transaction fees and estimated confirmation time.
No, BTC is still most used for that. You can easily verify this by looking at markets on www.coinmarketcap.com. That dominant position is decreasing further every day in function of ETH though.
Because the market is an idiot in the short term.
www.bitinfocharts.com
XRP would not even be visible on that chart though. Ethereum processes ~50x the USD value of Ripple. XRP is about on par with DOGE in that regard.
They process 1/50th of the volume though.
That transaction count is highly deceptive. The reality is that Ethereum processes ~50x the USD value of Ripple. XRP is not the third largest by any metric but market cap. Its transaction volume is on par with DOGE. See https://xrpcharts.ripple.com and www.bitinfocharts.com.
I do think that, yes. My estimate is that Casper will deprecate proof of work. There is no excuse for maintaining an inherently wasteful system in the face of an alternative that retains the properties of proof of work without said waste.
No, that would be transaction count, not USD value.
You're right. Ethereum also processes 4-5x Bitcoin's transaction count though :)
Sorry, I wasn't clear. I was referring to transaction count in this case.
Yeah, Ripple is a beanie baby pump company. Luckily the market seems to be slowly catching up to that.
Actually, by transaction count it's most likely less than 0.5%. There is no reason to believe Monero processes larger transactions.
Monero tx/day: ~5,000.
Ethereum tx/day: ~1,200,000.

I think that says enough.
The transaction count is known though. Monero processes a mere ~5,000/day. Ethereum a whopping ~1,200,000/day. So I think it's safe to say that Monero would not or barely be visible on that chart.
Actually, I think that Bitcoin still dominates there for the time being. See www.coinmarketcap.com. That domination is rapidly decreasing though.
ETC is a zombiechain. When somebody tries to shill it, you can safely assume they haven't done their due diligence.
They're mutually exclusive, but they do affect each other.

Ethereum also processes by far the most transactions. 4-5x as many as Bitcoin. More than all decentralized blockchains combined.

Off-chain volume is not necessarily zero fee. I can't give an explanation for off-chain volume versus on-chain volume.

I'm honestly confused what point you're trying to make, if any.
I know this might not be the sub for this opinion, but I personally consider Bitcoin and all of its forks and clones dead ends. They're years behind the curve. A blocksize increase is merely a bandaid on a large, gangrenous wound at this point.
They are completely separate metrics. There is no overlap between them. Do you understand that properly?
Yes, but only 1-2% of actual value transacted. Also, Ripple's transaction count is heavily inflated by costless 'transactions' such as order book entries.
Then I don't understand your confusion.
They are separate metrics. There is no overlap.
Probably doesn't even register due to very low USD value transacted, but www.bitinfocharts.com doesn't feature it.
Also consider that this doesn't even include token transactions, and that only a part of Ripple transactions involve XRP in the first place. So the difference is far greater than that even.

Shows how marketing and price pumps can generate a convincing illusion of utility and adoption.
It appears on www.bitinfocharts.com at least.
It includes all on-chain transactions, and doesn't even include token transactions (ERC20, ERC721, ...). It does not include exchange trading either, since those occur off-chain.
You're right. Ethereum processes by far the highest number of transactions as well though.
It's not that surprising. Market cap and marketing are removed quite significantly from verifiable adoption metrics.
Ethereum processes ~50x Ripple's on-chain USD transaction volume, so it disappears from this chart. See https://xrpcharts.ripple.com.
Ethereum processes the most transactions by a large margin as well. I think the combination of those metrics is important.
Every transaction has a cost attached to it and a value that is transferred. I'm not sure CryptoKitties is even included, since tokens (such as ERC20 and ERC721) aren't even included in this chart. With those tokens included, that chart would probably show well over 75%, though this is merely a loose estimate.
I'm not telling you anything. www.coinmarketcap.com and www.bitinfocharts.com are telling you.
Uh, what part of "This proposal is backwards compatible for all ERC20 tokens and contracts." did you not understand?

I think I won't bother discussing with someone that resorts to empty accusations as argumentation though.
On-chain transactions can't be inflated without huge cost. Off-chain exchange transactions actually can be though, considering zero fee exchanges. That's why on-chain transaction count and value are good utility metrics. Ethereum completely dominates all of crypto in both metrics.
Doesn't even appear. It processes barely any transactions to begin with.

XRP only processes ~$500mn. Ethereum processes ~$25bn, so thats ~50x of XRP. And that doesn't even include ERC20 tokens and the fact that only part of Ripple ledger volume even involves XRP. So yes, XRP completely disappears on this chart. Its on-chain transaction volume is about on par with DOGE.
Read the title again. Also, this doesn't even include ERC20 transactions, so it's actually a lot more.

The image is in the wild now. I'll take it into consideration for the future.
Value transferred on-chain the least important metric? Please elaborate.
Note that this chart doesn't even include ERC20 token volume.
That's indeed possible. The Ethereum ecosystem completely obliterates the rest of crypto by all metrics but market cap at this point.
It actually does. The rest completely disappears on that pie chart.
It's technically superior by all accounts from what I can see. What are your specific objections against ERC777?
Ripple only processes around $500mn per day, compared to $25bn on Ethereum. It's on par with DOGE in that regard. So it simply doesn't even appear in this top.

Is there any reason Ethereum couldn't perform batching as well?
This, as well as their marketing that is purposely aimed at the bottom of the barrel of non-technical investors.
XRP can hardly be counted as crypto. It's not decentralized or trustless and supply issuance is fully in control of a private company. It's a white collar scam.
It's not much of a partnership. Ripple just paid yet another company for using their name in a pump piece under the guise of doing 'tests'. Not exactly the first time. Nothing ever came from those 'partnerships'.

I think you might have your time frame wrong. This chart spans over a year. Check back in a week at least.
In that case, forget everything I said :)

Thanks for the quick answer.
That's only 2.5% of his net worth. That's very low risk.
That depends what percentage of his net worth those $250k were. It's all about percentages.

I think ETH will not drop below the second lowest trend line on the chart from this post.
It's just not an exact science. It can be practiced using applied science (Google 'quantitative analysis'), but that is not really what this chart is.
Because that is the only truly clear trend line that I could immediately distinguish.
[Here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/352817455380561920/399921582660648962/unknown.png)'s one from yesterday or so.
That seems most probable to me as well, and it seems like most of that value is flowing into ETH.
You can't just do the same analysis, but [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/352817455380561920/399921582660648962/unknown.png)'s a BTC chart I did yesterday.
This isn't the kind of thing you learn from a specific book. Normal observational skills, common sense, logical deduction and experience are all that is necessary.
Because the vast majority of the market participants aren't visible on the order book. Not to mention that there are multiple exchanges with different order books, which is especially true for ETH's well spread market.
I've never used that feature and don't feel like experimenting with it right now, but I'll take it into consideration.
I suggest that you examine the chart a bit more thorough :)
I'm personally just holding (ETH, and a bit of ZRX as well). No point in trying to overoptimize a sure thing.
A market as young as crypto moves on a logarithmic scale. The linear chart is useless really.
No worries. I don't think anyone with half a brain would confuse you for Satoshi.
In a couple of weeks perhaps. This chart spans more than a year :)
It's www.tradingview.com. I would suggest you try and reproduce this chart. The image is a full screenshot of the interface with all the relevant information visible. From there I think you'll find some new questions to ask in here.
- The four lines mark trend lines that have served as strong resistance/support in the past. They often occur in parallel, forming channels such as this one.
- The Y-axis is on a logarithmic scale. It shows percentage change instead of nominal change. So the distance from $1 to $2 is the same as the distance from $100 to $200.

I can't give closed form answers as to why exactly the chart moves like that, but the confirmations that it does are clearly visible, and not only in this particular image.
Where are you from? Perhaps localethereum is an option?
I wouldn't worry about these kind of opportunistic forks. They're launched for personal profit. You're the first I even heard mention it.
This is an updated chart. Glad to be of service :)
I think it's more realistic to consider this to be a broad prediction for the coming months. But I don't see why $35,000 wouldn't be possible.
[$2000 ETH confirmed.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e5/30/4b/e5304b6a0a83d343595f0670d173d2aa.jpg)
Somewhere in this broad channel. Probably in the second level or higher.
Make that days to weeks.
Ah, sorry, I thought you implied those to be indicators of anything meaningful.
Those are predictions that are impossible to make, but seeing as the market seems to subscribe to this channel, and the disruptive nature of Ethereum and the palpable sentiment shift that is currently happening, I think we can safely assume that this channel will be respected well into 2018.
You shouldn't use the order book as indicator for much more than liquidity/slippage. Thank me later.
I just used the extended line tool and drew them manually. I never found any use for more advanced drawing tools than simple lines, honestly.
A private one, sorry.
Believe? It's just a way to interpret the chart that the broad market seems to subscribe to. Not a prophecy :)
I'm not claiming absolute truths, but I think you may want to examine the lines a bit closer.
They're based on multiple reversals and thus strong support/resistance around those levels.
Lines. On a chart. Best way to learn is by examining the chart and asking more specific questions.
Follow each of those lines. They are not randomly chosen.
www.tradingview.com
Don't look at order books. They don't mean anything. And I mean that pretty much literally. Also, I said **minimum** $2000. $2000 as such is not a particularly important number. It's just the closest round number that makes sense to mention as an estimate.
Take a close look at the chart. If we go vertical from here, ~$2000 is where the next resistance trend line lies. So minimum $2000 until there is real resistance. At least according to this particular analysis.

Korean exchanges lack KYC, so even kids can trade. And it shows in their choice of pumps (cough, XRP).
Cardano marketing is one long appeal to authority, purposely aimed at dumb money. Their goal is to have uninformed people react like "Sounds complex. Must be legit!". But there is very little meat there indeed. I'd stay the hell away from it.
... into ETH :)
Try out MetaMask for instance. Then look at uPort. Now imagine a world where you never have to manually log into individual websites and manage passwords, or perhaps not even perform KYC verification on individual crypto exchanges, yet your global identity is secured on a decentralized ledger. And that is just one example. It's incredibly powerful.
I've engaged with him a couple of times. He sold after the DAO hard fork in 2016, so probably below $10. Poor guy lost his marbles over it.
Not they. It's just one person :)
Notice how that sub is just one guy collecting and even collaging Ethereum FUD. Also check his comment history some time. Certified nutcase. He also uses multiple Reddit and Twitter accounts to spread his nonsense. Luckily his rhetoric is so deranged that he's pretty easy to spot :)
The better question is: Any idea why BTC went up in the first place?
That is another potentially strong one indeed. Though it does have an adopted competitor in Tether already. I keep a passive eye on it.
Writing your protocol client in Pascal and naming it after that is not what I would call pragmatic :)
I answered that here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7op0ou/_/dsbbjro
Well, I have to agree on ZRX. Bitfinex is using 0x for Ethfinex. Coinbase CEO is also investing into an 0x based decentralized exchange protocol (https://www.coindesk.com/coinbase-ceo-backs-crypto-derivatives-exchange-dydx).

That's the two largest US exchanges that are shifting gears, with Ethereum and 0x as their lowest layers. And for that reason ZRX is literally my only diversification from ETH at the moment. It's the only token that I'm rather confident can outperform even ETH based on fundamentals for the short to mid term.

Agree that the user could have at least given somewhat of an investment thesis though.
Fair enough :)
Great work. Thanks.
I don't get the amount of upvotes either. There's a lot of reason in the comments at least.
Most people are silent observers, so I wouldn't be too sure. But understandable.
That's indeed true. I guess the exchange is responsible for keeping a well spread amount of addresses then. Most exchanges really only seem to have a very limited set of addresses to draw from.
Sounds like the real problem is the limited amount of addresses used by the exchanges. If they would use an address per user, that problem wouldn't really apply.
Plenty of reasons. I've summarized them here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7k6wos/what_does_ethereum_think_of_cardano_from_a/drck6h8

In short: he's a bad actor. People that have worked with him seem to consistently report negative experiences, ranging from manipulative, self-serving behavoir to downright narcissistic sociopathy.
Then let's not stop educating them. The Dunning-Kruger is definitely strong in crypto, or perhaps on social media as a whole.
Exactly. It's open source, so can be easily implemented locally.
Yes, obviously the client code should check the return value. I think that's a given.
It would at least avoid the insane gas prices some exchanges are using at the moment, but you're right.
My pleasure :)
It would tarnish their credibility quite significantly. Also, Brian Armstrong is clearly focused on Ethereum, and the framework seems to be a conscious long term investment in keeping their exchange reputable. XRP is a very shady asset after all.
There is no reason to believe it will be added indeed. Just shills shilling.
Amongst several things in the framework. There is just no way that it will ever be added to Coinbase unless they decide to scrap that framework pretty much entirely :)
That's a bit harder to find. It was on CNBC at any rate. I think at most a couple of weeks ago, prior to the BCH launch.
The likelihood of XRP being added to Coinbase is extremely small. The Coinbase CEO articulated the importance of their Digital Asset Framework in an interview mere days ago. XRP fails it in a spectacular way. See https://www.gdax.com/static/digital-asset-framework-2017-11.pdf
One problem is that software clients and exchanges are generally overpaying quite massively. There should be a push for using the ETH Gas Station API by these entities. See https://ethgasstation.info/json/ethgasAPI.json

Edit: Using that API directly may not be the best idea due to centralization concerns. Software clients should implement https://github.com/ethgasstation locally.
I would play this.

Actually, this is false. He was fired very early for manipulative behavior. By his irrational public hate for Ethereum afterwards and his attempted sabotage through ETC later on, I sincerely doubt that he made much from it. He probably made more from ETC. See https://medium.com/@classicether/out-of-the-ether-a-crisis-of-irresponsible-governance-facing-ethereum-classic-a77abdd7a9fa
Exchanges tend to overpay for no reason. See also https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7nqhzw.
He responded with his usual evasive, deflecting nonsense and provided zero evidence beyond a pinky promise. How do you not see through his bullshit?
That is one small part of one article addressed, and with no proof beyond a pinky swear from you. How about addressing all the other allegations? https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7k6wos/_/dre8mmb
Do you see me shilling anything there? I'm calling out a bad actor with a list of evidence. And until he stops playing the martyr card and addresses those concerns and the financial incentives involved, I will continue to do so. It's very clear that he will continue to evade and deflect though.
Aren't you a little old to maintain childish feuds?
The fact that this clown gets upvoted into the sky by posting a single sentence moon prediction proves that r/ethtrader has gone into Eternal September mode.
You're bending the truth. Look through this user's comment history yourself. He's a blatant Cardano shill.
It could be called merely a little petty if you disregard the huge personal financial incentives involved.
How about you let people decide for themselves how much weight the evidence holds?

https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7k6wos/_/dre8mmb
You're trying to play the martyr card, just like Hoskinson always does. The pattern of dishonesty is too overwhelming to ignore though.
Well, I'm not the one spreading lies here.
facepalm.jpg
The collection of evidence shows that there is a pattern of dishonesty and dubious motive surrounding Hoskinson. You're cherry picking one item from the collection. And those tweets weren't angry at all. Have you even bothered to investigate before discarding all of the evidence outright?
I did no such thing. And you're cherry picking one tweet from the list of evidence.
The people making these allegations are respected insiders, not random trolls. It shows that you haven't even bothered to look. See https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7k6wos/_/dre8mmb and actually verify things. Some things could surely be considered conjecture, but the pattern is undeniable.
Which information is false exactly?
You might want to first check who these 'Twitter tards' are, as well as actually look at the evidence.
It's more like $0.05. Do you have your units wrong?
I think people are suffering from pretty strong portfolio bias here. Hoskinson is little more than a criminal. It's transparent to anyone but the most gullible MLM victims.
I don't recall having arguments with you. Got a link?
Sounds like the words of someone who has cashed in and is already planning his exit.
Proof?
False. I changed my opinion. You should try it some time. At the time my opinion of the DAO hard fork was overly polarizing. Either way, I was bearish in a bear market and bullish in a bull market, so I can't complain. I was not invested in Bitcoin during that time either (except for some short trades). Bitcoin and its forks and clones are dead ends.
> it’s not here to make you rich overnight.

It made Charles Hoskinson filthy rich overnight already. How are people so blind to the financial incentives at play here?
It's not a hate campaign. Charles refuses to address the evidence and allegations. Until he does, I will call him out.
Huh? I don't recall such a thing. Could you provide a link to that?
You're evading. How about actually addressing the overwhelming evidence and your financial incentives?
No evidence. Just experience.
Let's have time be the judge of that, shall we? I've seen enough of these hype pumps over the years to feel very confident about my analysis, but that doesn't mean you have to share it.
You are completely free to form your own conclusion. I'm just presenting the evidence along with my own observations.
It's not a cop-out. I'll be reminded in 6 months time. My estimate is that Cardano will be out of the top 10 market cap list, just like the weak Ethereum coat tail alt pumps before it. I'd be somewhat surprised to not see Hoskinson crash and burn in some more ways in that time as well.

Time will tell.
!RemindMe 6 months
Why does he call himself a mathematician and cryptographer then? Why does he wave math books around in interviews as appeal to authority when he never seems to have opened one?

Also why does he repeatedly flaunt his very brief position as Ethereum CEO, even though he was fired for dubious reasons, and is known for not having made any significant contribution to it?

There is nothing wrong with not having credentials. But making an appeal to credentials that you don't have is just deceptive.
> Half of this guys comment history is him either calling out Charles with the same claims

> Furthermore, stop following Charles around and nit picking everything he says. Say your peace of course but there's no reason to go around being an annoying younger brother.

I will continue to call out Charles, as he is simply a bad actor. Luckily there are only a few of those in crypto, but I gladly spend my time eradicating the dishonesty and money grubbing. It's called making a long term investment.

> Moreover, please understand something. This post (even from the claims of the OP) was supposed to be technological.

That is not OP's motive judging from the rest of his discourse. His obvious motive is to make people aware of Cardano's existence and convince people to invest in it. Don't act naive, thanks.

> This is not EVIDENCE of anything, again.

You're entirely correct. This is an overarching observation that carries into pretty much all of Hoskinson's public discourse. It was mentioned to make people aware of his formulaic marketing/sympathy tricks. Just take note and see if you can spot why I'm making these observations next time you hear Hoskinson speak.

> This is a permalink that links to a comment from Charles

The link pertains to the whole paragraph. Not just the last sentence. Perhaps that wasn't entirely clear.

> Concern controlling in ethereum killer subs? What does that even fucking mean?

It means that he goes into other Ethereum altcoin subs, like r/tezos and r/eos, under the guise of expressing concern,  but transparently in function of marketing Cardano. Just browse through his comment history. It's not exactly an isolated incident.

Please also note that the 3 points from my evidence post are merely quoting the Twitter thread. These allegations are not mine.

Don't you find it strange that Hoskinson is surrounded by such allegations while nobody else in crypto seems to be?

Either way, this is not investment advice. Just be vigilant.
I haven't gone deeply through anyone's comment history. Just a quick skim over the first few pages was enough to immediately see his agenda. Especially in crypto this is valuable, since almost everybody has a financial motive.
> Name them, give us some examples.

Name what? The proof here is that he never goes in any real depth on anything, has no published papers or technical articles, and little to no GitHub commits. The guy is all talk and waving of credentials as appeals to authority. Feel free to show me otherwise. I couldn't find anything.
You must be new. Reddit comment histories are a great way to scope motive. This guy is a blatant shill. I've seen it way too many times now. If you're trying to promote something, at least be honest about it.
I'm just giving him an opportunity to prove his credibility. Try finding any published work or even meaningful GitHub commits from him.
Please list those many others. Thanks.
Could you show me some of your personal academic publications or credited work?
Let's conveniently omit the massive financial incentive, shall we?

Coinbase CEO emphasised the importance of that framework in deciding new assets mere days ago. XRP fails it spectacularly.
And Ethereum has about 3x the amount of nodes of Bitcoin running, so I'd say so indeed.
This link does a great job at answering those questions: http://ethdocs.org/en/latest/ethereum-clients
It's easy to verify. Just look at the GitHub repositories. There are many developers working on several projects. Vitalik is mostly doing research last I checked.
They don't exist.
Actually I took a ride on ADA and made profit. I'm talking about investment, not riding the pump of the day.
That is the essence of ERC271: non-fungible tokens. Combine with identity (uPort for instance) and the value proposition becomes glaringly obvious.
Please take your obvious shilling elsewhere.
Could you please take your obvious shilling elsewhere? Thanks.
I give it a < 5% chance that Cardano is still in the top 10 market cap by that time.
A lot of the information there is spinning the highly nuanced topic of blockchain governance into a polarizing anti-Ethereum narrative, much like Charles Hoskinson has also been doing with ETC. His often repeated 'immutability' narrative is incredibly flawed. The fact is that any blockchain is mutable by its very design, because any actor can release a client with protocol changes. If enough people adopt that client, the blockchain has officially turned mutable by precedent.

The single maintainer of that sub completely lost his marbles after selling ETH near the bottom after the DAO hard fork. He has been posting death threats and a constant barrage of carefully gathered Ethereum FUD, even using multiple Reddit accounts, all over the place ever since as well. He's incidentally also one of the bad (though mostly harmless because obviously insane) actors I've repeatedly called out in the past, far more so than Hoskinson even.
That sub is the work of one nutcase. Check his comment history some time. I'd say the crazy collages are telling enough, but I guess some people are still fooled :)
It isn't? That would be a change coming from you. https://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/7h6hfi/my_thoughts_on_the_tezos_issue/dqohh15 seems to confirm that you consider it a get-rich-quick scheme at least for yourself.
Just a *lot* of claims with verifiable sources. We're not talking one or two coincidental allegations here. Hoskinson is like a magnet to them. Occam's razor favours him being a bad actor by a huge margin. Try finding such a list of allegations on anyone from the Ethereum foundation for instance.
Would you say the same if you weren't holding a heavy bag of ADA?
I'll have to dig very deep in my comment history for that. It's been quite a while since I had to warn people about Tezos. In the past months they've been making those warnings more than true though.

A quick search only turns up this from ages ago, where I discuss some of Tezos' technicals: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/68hga1/tezos_red_flags

I've repeatedly warned people in r/tezos as well, but I can't seem to find anything. Maybe it was moderated away?

Ethereum will switch to Proof of Stake, transitioning through hybrid PoW/PoS initially.
Uh, DPoS stands for Delegated Proof of Stake. Have a read through these points to get a better understanding why it is a rather undesirable scheme that Ethereum purposely stays away from: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6qm0y2/is_the_ethereum_team_defending_their_ground/dkyk94c. You are confusing the quality of the design with the **intent** of the design. It's the intent where the problem lies.

> Cardano have, point in fact, been exceedingly honest - with both (very long) video explanations of Ouroboros and the whitepaper itself, along with shorter explanations of DPoS / PoS as a general concept.

I have seen the white board videos. They avoid pros and cons and focus on painting an unrealistically bright picture, purposely aimed at enticing the lowest common denominator. They're essentially one long sales pitch for people that barely have an understanding of what a blockchain even is. The IOHK videos tend to take the marketing fluff another step further. Cardano's tech is solid enough. Edging very clearly towards keeping Hoskinson & co firmly in control (as is typical of DPoS), but solid otherwise.

> how many contracts do you see written in LLL, beyond theoretical proof-of-concepts? How many in Viper?

How many have you seen written in Plutus? A language that doesn't even exist beyond a theoretical specification? Ethereum has at least 3 languages that are actually usable at this very moment, several more that have specifications, including of the functional paradigm. Cardano isn't exactly performing rocket science here. It's just another iteration on Ethereum's design, as the dozens other out there already.

> I.. literally said this exact thing. K-EVM is written by the K team, which work for Cardano.

Correct. I misread that. Apologies. The K team has little to do with Cardano though. They're IOHK funded, but the K spec is pretty old now.
Maybe it's just me, but I can't remember the last time Charlie Lee ever said anything thoughtful. He has just sold all of his LTC after pumping it into the sky too. People really need to start judging people by their verifiable actions rather than their public facade.
I'm not impressed by your transparent appeal to emotion. The ERC20 API is not why those funds were lost. The API serves a purposely minimal goal by design. We're talking about the lowest layers here.

I think that if you're a software engineer with some experience, you should know that 'working' isn't all there is to good code. When proposing an API that is to be widely implemented by other clients, introducing API bloat is simply a bad idea, regardless of whether it happens to 'work'.
I actually have, but that chapter has pretty much closed already. I think it's obvious that the red flags manifested themselves already. EOS and Cardano are most likely next to fall.
It is. There are multiple people involved. But Hoskinson is the one taking the credit.
Blockchains aren't sports teams or religions.

Good luck and stay vigilant.
Apparently nobody understands but yourself. Connect the dots.
One in a million? Cardano disappears in a sea of Ethereum coat tail projects. Even if it would have an actual value proposition to speak of and a proponent without a history of dishonesty and scams, it's still operating in a severely diluted market. And that wouldn't be so bad, but Ethereum is processing more on-chain transactions per day than the whole crypto ecosystem combined. And the same can be said about the developer ecosystem surrounding Ethereum.

My gripe with Cardano and Hoskinson in particular is the blatant dishonesty displayed. People are being lured in over lies. I don't think anyone in the Ethereum community feels threatened by it. If anything, the more of these clones emerge, the more diluted the Ethereums alts market becomes.
That is not what I'm reading in the EIP discussion. Just give it up already.
No, your Reddit comment history. Plenty of concern trolling and constant inability to accept that your solution is not the better one from a software engineering point of view. Push for a better reference implementation of ERC20 instead, without the preaching and concern trolling undertone, and you should see a more positive attitude emerge.
I have. Except that I actually understand what is being said and how it links to reality, contrary to the sales pitch parrots in here.
And it's appreciated, but I think the effort is better spent on providing a better ERC20 reference implementation, rather than trying to keep pushing this API change through ad nauseum.
Have you actually read it?

Also see https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7k6wos/_/drck6h8 for more glaring red flags.
DPoS essentially boils down to running a permissioned blockchain in public. Great for flaunting good stats. Terrible for decentralization. It shares this with NEO, EOS and several others. I purposely avoid DPoS chains for that very reason. It doesn't help that this is carefully kept hidden by the project's marketing. No honesty = no trust.

Solidity is not Ethereum's language. Where do people get this nonsense? The EVM is language agnostic, and so is IELE. Plutus doesn't even exist beyond a spec from what I've seen too. You might want to check [Viper](https://github.com/ethereum/vyper) or [LLL](https://media.consensys.net/an-introduction-to-lll-for-ethereum-smart-contract-development-e26e38ea6c23).

Ethereum has no ideological point of view. That's its strength. It's all about pragmatism, and that is what I prefer. The developers don't suffer from NIH syndrome and will investigate all avenues. If IOHK puts forward something interesting, there will be no qualms to use it.

The EVM is fully verified too. See KEVM. That said, this is far less important than Hoskinson's claims. He's great at making fringe details appear as important value propositions.
Your comment history reveals something else. Let's keep it at that.
I am a programmer and I've read through the EIP. Your suggestion sounds like interface bloat to me. The goal I of course agree with, but this is down to providing a better reference implementation, not mutilating the API.
Then I can only assume that you haven't read the allegations and thus are unwilling to perform due diligence on your investments. To each their own I suppose.
Read the EIP. u/Dexaran has been pushing this solution all over the place, even though it was rejected on good grounds. He's also an ETC shill that loves to shit on Ethereum in general. His agenda is not constructive.
It's not a good solution. Read the discussion on the EIP. u/Dexaran needs to read up on the single responsibility principle. He's confusing interface and implemention details.
How about refuting the points put forward instead?
It has nothing to do with rivalry. I have called out several bad actors in the past. Most notable examples are Charlie Lee and Dan Larimer. Neither of which competed with Ethereum at the time to begin with. I'm not some sort of Ethereum maximalist, though it does happen to be the only provably viable project in crypto at the moment, at least by my analysis.

I'm just sick and tired of the glorified scammers polluting the space, and I will keep calling them out as long as they keep appearing.
Professional software engineer for 10-15 years now. Primarily C++, from high performance, time critical, close to the metal stuff to more boring user facing code. Other languages too when applicable. Involved in crypto as both investor and developer (not in a professional capacity though) for around 5 years now.
The code is nothing special in the first place. It's an Ethereum variant like many others, and most of it doesn't even exist in code yet. And yes, I do understand it. Browse my comment history a bit, where I discussed concrete points. There is very little substance behind the hyperbole sales pitches.

I put forward clear evidence, with verifiable sources. Feel free to refute specific evidence with counter evidence. Perhaps start by reading https://medium.com/@classicether/out-of-the-ether-a-crisis-of-irresponsible-governance-facing-ethereum-classic-a77abdd7a9fa without portfolio bias.
It's not nice to hijack a topic with a different question entirely. That's why he's getting downvotes.
I'll just leave this here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7k6wos/_/drck6h8

The evidence against Hoskinson is overwhelming. He has not brought up a single point of counter evidence so far. The insiders I've talked to that worked with him described him as being a straight up criminal.
It's hard to argue with concrete evidence, but feel free to try.

Hoskinson is a known bad actor for anyone that has been in crypto for a couple of years.
Have a look at this: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/#markets

China doesn't even care one bit about NEO. It's a silly narrative.
Yeah, Hoskinson's participation is an instant red flag.
You don't have to do anything. The fork will be non-contentious. Keeping it on ledger is the best option no matter what, even in case of contention.
That is false. The difficulty bomb can be easily defused (as ETC did for instance). It merely protects against absolute idiots to blindly fork and profit.

And Vitalik is not the leader. The market is the leader. That is how hard forks work.
Are you talking about the transitional state that would still allow PoW mining? If I understand correctly, a hard fork to eliminate PoW is unavoidable in the end.
Ethereum has seen quite a few update hard forks. The difference is that the roadmap has been part of the deal from the start. It's what the community expects. Combined with the proven merit of the developers, it makes these update hard forks non-contentious. And should some party disagree, it is completely free to keep mining the old chain.
And Waves, Stratis, Ardor, Expanse, ETC, Qtum, ...
As far as I know, it will be a hard fork. Where did you get the idea that it won't be?
Yes, very professional: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7k6wos/_/drck6h8

You're a scammer, Charles. Only the uninformed fall for your shit. And plenty of those in the current crypto space. It's deplorable.

Can this obvious scammer be purged from crypto already? The guy has more red flags surrounding him than China: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7k6wos/_/drck6h8
You mean their shallow sales pitch that avoids technical depth and just tries to one-up Ethereum for the uninformed investor?
Oh, you're talking about exchanges. I'm talking about on-chain transactions obviously. You do know the difference, right?
Hoskinson blowing his own horn again. How sad can it get? Check that comment history :)
Cardano can't run CryptoKitties either. It's just conveniently hidden by the fact that nobody is using Cardano in the first place.

You are making dishonest statements on the back of Ethereum as usual. It's the only project with proponents that repeatedly put out honest warnings about the lack of scalability in current generation blockchains, with a broad roadmap to solve the challenges involved.

Anyway, dishonesty is your trademark: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7k6wos/_/drck6h8

Bitcoin isn't made to be transferred any longer. It's a 'store of value' only now. If you want actual utiity, try Ethereum instead.
Can't argue with that ;)
And Waves, Ardor, Stratis, ETC, Aeternity, Tezos, Qtum, Expanse, ...

Almost too many to name. None have any developer traction to speak of though.
Then challenge my knowledge, experience, as well as the evidence presented. Just claiming it must all be made up slander shows that you skimmed over it with grave portfolio bias rather than a desire to verify the truth and in such perform proper due diligence on your investment.
You've been on Reddit for 18 days, even though it is the center of the crypto community. I've been into crypto since early 2013 myself, and a software engineer in the field on top of that. I hate appeals to authority, but you're clearly new, both by statistics and portfolio bias. Approach anything said with a critical mindset, but waving away facts is not smart.
You sound very new to crypto. I wish you all the best, but seriously: **be careful**.

You're spouting some seriously hearsay nonsense here. A blockchain that currently claims to outscale Ethereum significantly without sacrificing security or decentralization is essentially a scam. Blockchains don't scale yet today. That is a fact.

In the case of Ethereum, adoption is literally outpacing the scaling roadmap. A luxury problem that Cardano doesn't suffer, seeing as it doesn't have any adoption or developer ecosystem to speak of. Ethereum processes over a million transactions per day. Cardano a couple hundred at best.
Dude, open your eyes. Read this article carefully: https://medium.com/@classicether/out-of-the-ether-a-crisis-of-irresponsible-governance-facing-ethereum-classic-a77abdd7a9fa. It's literally stuffed with verifiable evidence.

Just be careful. That is the only advice I'm giving here.
Comparing Steve Jobs to Charles Hoskinson? Quite the stretch of imagination...
Because there are hard facts behind those links.
I guess you haven't followed any of the links. Either way, just be careful.
There are good reasons why ERC223 isn't necessarily an improvement. See https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/223.

Yet another project that is all promise and no implementation that tries to cash in on Ethereum's success. The list of those is getting long.
Sorry, but no. The top market cap is littered with borderline scams and other crap. The reality in terms of adoption is that Ethereum and Bitcoin are the only two significant players.
It's not about being an ass. It's about being a self-serving scammer.
How else do you suggest I bring such a blatant pattern of dishonesty to people's attention other than naming the bad actor together with the evidence? Should I just keep silent instead? Have you even looked at that list of worrying signs?

The reason I bring forward this evidence is to remove any reasonable doubt, exactly because it can then not be dismissed as the usual 'jealous FUD' and tribalism so rampant in crypto. And no, I am not threatened by Cardano any more than I'm threatened by Lisk, Waves, Tezos, EOS, NEO, ETC, Ardor, Stratis, Expanse, Qtum, Aeternity or any of the other dozens of Ethereum alts out there that promise to solve every hard blockchain/cryptocurrency problem but consistently fail to deliver, or choose to sacrifice decentralization and trustlessness to a high degree in order to flaunt superior specs to the technically inept investor.

If you consider some of the points conjecture, filter them out at will. Unless you're not the type to perform due diligence on your investments, in which case you can proceed to blindly throw money at every hyperbole promise out there.

He's also not the only person I've called out in the past. He just so happens to be one of the most blatant examples of bad actors in the crypto space at the moment. There are unfortunately too many of them, and the more uninformed people flood into the space, the worse it seems to be getting.

Anyway, I am just one source of information. And I too have biases, no doubt. But I think you'll agree that it's unwise to dismiss any evidence that disagrees with your point of view (or, let's be honest here, your wallet). Challenge that evidence all you want, but blindly dismissing it is on par with yelling "La la la! I can't hear you!" when confronted with facts that require you to potentially adjust your point of view.
It's very simple. Because Ethereum has turned out to be highly profitable, and they want a piece of the pie. The same happened for Bitcoin around 2013. The difference is that Ethereum has the right researchers, developers and community to not fall into the stagnation and ideological drama trap.
I'll just leave this here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7k6wos/_/drck6h8

People really seem to be unaware of your past behavior and shady endeavours. Insiders I've talked to so far categorically describe you as manipulative and untrustworthy.
Perhaps verify the evidence put forward first. My comment is not on the technicals of Cardano. It's a decent enough project. Nothing particularly groundbreaking, but technically solid. My comment is on the character of Charles Hoskinson and the history of dubious behavior and dishonesty that seems to carry on into the marketing of Cardano as well.
Do you have anything interesting to say as well?
Just do some research if you don't believe me. The difference between stories/facade and what is really brewing in the background is pretty ridiculous. Especially today, what with the dumb herd flowing in like crazy.
I'd much rather see him debate Vitalik Buterin. I think Charles Hoskinson would get utterly destroyed.
Except that a lot of it are lies and sales pitches. Especially his period working for Ethereum. He was fired after manipulating people for personal fame and fortune. Insiders know him as a narcissistic sociopath.

Open your mind and be your own judge. Have an exit plan ready.
ETC is a zombiechain that only really exists as anti-Ethereum device. Most of the proponents have even left by now. There's next to no development happening. Stay away.

Just use www.tradingview.com, make sure to switch the chart to logarithmic scaling, and look for signals on the chart that the majority of the market will also see. Make sure to use sufficiently long time scales. There is not much more to it. The deeper you go into TA and it's derivative indicators, the more it becomes tea leaves nonsense.

I can't really comment on that. Bitcoin had no problem going 18x on nothing but fumes though.
> ETH as a token isn’t and won’t be because of ICO.

That statement doesn't touch reality in any way. Remember that all these ERC20 tokens are transacted on the Ethereum blockchain and that fees are denoted in ETH. Not to mention the market sentiment of Ethereum = ETH.

> I have read the Etherium white paper and was on there to convert my BTC to ETH.

You might want to work on your spelling of 'Ethereum' if you want to make further appeals to authority :)

> Educate yourself and pay attention when someone like me comes in and literally points it out.

Thanks for the suggestion and even more appeal to authority. I'm very familiar with crypto markets myself though. Past experience has taught me that strongly confirmed trend lines and channels on longer time spans have a very strong impact on the market. And if you would have actually examined my chart, you would see the undeniable evidence of that. That said, I obviously don't take these predictions as absolute truth either. They indicate high probability of future range and important doubt/reversal points. Nothing more or less. Overwhelming sentiment shifts can alter that prediction, but by the way things are lining up in terms of fundamentals, Ethereum as a whole is undoubtedly bullish.
No offense, but you sound very inexperienced when it comes to investing in crypto. I'd recommend you don't try and time these markets. Hold the asset where the development is flowing and read up on why Ethereum is considered such a disruptive technology. Good luck.
+7900%

Invested in Ethereum (ETH). I have no intention to sell for the next couple of years. Fundamentals are strong and local volatility is part of the deal.
Today's action doesn't even show on my chart. Did you even look at it?
No, logarithmic charts are pretty common. For crypto it's really the only chart that makes sense.
The right time to buy is when you think it will be higher in the foreseeable future. Local volatility should be considered a calculated risk.
Your appeal to authority doesn't impress me. I've been investing into and trading crypto for 5 years now as well. I think you need to take a very close look at my chart before making generalist statements.
And that is why this is a logarithmic chart. Look at the vertical axis on the right.
I think that is a healthy prediction to make from this chart.
I'm predicting that the price will be moving inside the broad upwards channel displayed on this chart for the coming months.
> There are no fundamentals to crypto besides sentiment. That’s a fact.

Is it now? What is your reference point?

> There is a direct correlation on all crypto volume. When one drops others pick up.

Yes, there are bots, arbitrage and otherwise, playing the markets. You're cherry picking and vastly oversimplifying though.

> Yeah? ETH is the fuel? Then why have ICO tokens? Why did Apple an other new startups use blockchain concepts but don’t actually use ETH. Explain to me a valuation of ETH above 2k - when most people will dump to pay bills or become overnights pseudo millionaires?

I'd agree that most ICO tokens are pointless money grabs. Several are not though. The ERC20 (and ERC721 for that matter) standards are valuable.

The value in ETH is perceived to be many things. I think a large one is the prospect of proof of stake, where ETH holdings can be used to acquire dividends, all while supporting the network. This along with the clear indication that crypto is shifting to Ethereum as an established standard is enough for people to buy and hold ETH. No different than most investments at its core, really.
That person has plenty of time to buy before 2k though ;)
Such channels indicate strong probabilities, not certainties. I'm not trying to state an absolute truth. It's just something that the majority of the market seems to subscribe to at the moment.
That morbidly obese finger sell in mid June though ;)
The channel on this new chart has more trend line confirmations. It also happens to be more optimistic. Which may be in line with the many projects brewing on Ethereum. We'll see.
> The market is being manipulated right now and the price is driven up by sentiment.

The market is always being manipulated and driven by sentiment. I'm not sure what your point is.

> Don’t kid yourself. There will be a correction in Jan.

Corrections will happen (though January seems like a pretty random guess). Just look at my chart. There are plenty of hefty corrections on there. I won't be the one trying to time the market though.

> Look at recent implementations. None use ETH as a driving force.

They are all running on the Ethereum blockchain. Guess which asset directly powers that blockchain.

> All these people are going to sell at $Xxx and there won’t be new buyers. Don’t be dumb thinking that 21mil = 120mil or that the PR can inflate it that high. Look at the shill Litecoin and what happened when it profit taking occurred.

I have no idea how to even respond to that word salad. I'm just speaking from experience of the past 5 years. Comparing Litecoin, a worthless clonecoin with no developer ecosystem, to Ethereum is a bit farfetched though. 
I think it will be higher than that, given this stronger confirmed chart and the plethora of positive signs for 2018.
Very similar to the flatline at $10. Pretty amazing indeed.

Literally the first hit of a Google search.
It means that people will parrot sales pitches they don't understand in function of their portfolio. Or just Dunning-Kruger effect.
Cardano cannot offer that either. If that is being claimed, they are being dishonest. I doubt that they are though, as it would make them into a mockery for any serious computer scientist.

And Ethereum has quantum resistance planned for the Serenity update, in a properly abstracted fashion too. And this has been known for a long time. See https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/28
State is just as mutable. The only difference is that it is harder to unintentionally modify it within the confines of a single smart contract. Unless you're claiming that Cardano is stateless, which is either false or a deal breaker of the whole protocol.
Do you know the difference between a blockchain client and the smart contracts deployed on that blockchain? You seem to conflate the two in a strange way. The clients were never really much of a security concern to begin with.

You are enumerating a couple of advantages without naming the disadvantages. There is a reason that the vast majority of programming is not done in functional languages, and it's not just habit or legacy.

Solidity is not a perfect language (no such thing exists due to subjectivity), but it's not the language of Ethereum to begin with. That would be EVM code, which can be relatively easily used as backend for any programming language. Existing programming languages are rarely a good choice though, for a variety of reasons.

The reality is that a programmable blockchain like Ethereum (or any of its dozens of coat tail projects) consists of state and behavior. The higher level language used to convert to a lowest level definition of that state or behavior is, while not unimportant, not a valid point of criticism against the protocol as such. And functional languages only protect against a couple of specific human errors, but with hefty drawbacks. It's not a solution. It's a different approach. And incidentally one with a lot of inherent friction.

I'm personally coming from the C++ stable of thinking, where functional programming is a *choice*. Either way, the real difference doesn't lie in these higher level languages, but rather in the underlying protocol. EVM puts no limitation on that, and I think we both know that architecture backends are mostly abstracted away when designing a compiler. So when a language is designed, it can be relatively easily ported to any VM implementation.
NEO also shot up like that. So did ETC. EOS also got pumped. So did Lisk, and Expanse. It cannot be stressed enough how much price and fundamentals can decouple in the short term. ADA will be not be in the top 10 by the end of 2018. RemindMe! 1 year
Thanks for trusting my opinions, but I don't consider myself knowledgeable enough to confidently comment on this issue. My overarching opinion is that still defending or fighting for any Bitcoin flavour or clone is hard to rationalize at this point though. I've moved to Ethereum a long time ago.
We are in a strong bull market, which will come with hard corrections as well. I mean, we've seen ETH go from $420 to $130 some months ago. That's why I simply hold ETH without trading, because it seems by far the most likely survivor of turmoil given its strong developer ecosystem. I also think that these kind of chart predictions only work on assets that have fundamental upside to begin with.
That's not exactly what I'm predicting :). I think we can safely assume that this channel is very strong though.
Which tech bubble exactly? People love to throw the 'bubble' word around, but it rarely maps all too well to reality.
I think that you fail to realize that the programming language of the client(s) is not all too important. Ethereum has multiple developer teams doing multiple clients, in different programming languages. It comes down more to preference than anything, since in the end they all run lowest level bytecode, which has no concept of the higher level programming language paradigm used to generate or execute it. You're conflating multiple concepts.

If your concern lies with Solidity, then you should be perhaps be looking at [Viper](https://github.com/ethereum/viper), or one of the other programming languages that compile to EVM. The important part is the EVM specification, not the infinite amount of languages that can compile to it. Those programming languages are not part of the Ethereum protocol. As I pointed out, there is a very good reason Solidity is a decent choice at the moment though. It maps rather directly to the EVM, allowing strict control over the security/performance tradeoff, as C does for physical CPUs. This is a very sensible choice by any standard. Serpent shouldn't even be mentioned as that was dropped ages ago.

Functional programming doesn't make contracts immutable. There is still state maintained. It's just a strategy to protect programmers from unintended mutability, and indeed tends to allow for easier formal verification. But indeed not a panacea, and has severe drawbacks, which make it unsuitable as a silver bullet solution. A multi-paradigm approach tends to make more sense for a second layer programming language. And Solidity, albeit not perfect (nothing is), allows for that multi-paradigm approach. I think Viper is where the real meat is for the future though.
While this chart already covers over a year, I've also posted an all time chart a while ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7i5vgp/eth_price_in_one_year_between_700_and_14000.

I'd say this last one has stronger confirmations though.
u/brussell1972 has his concepts quite confused. https://www.reddit.com/r/cardano/comments/7kiqto/once_ethereum_introduces_plasma_is_cardano_still/drgx8kp
You are wrong on so many points, I almost don't know where to start, but here goes...

First of all, as far as I understand, only the Cardano clients are written in Haskell. The smart contract virtual machine is language agnostic, just like the EVM. There are functional languages in development for the EVM just as well, but Solidity is currently a good choice because it has an almost 1:1 mapping to EVM instructions (compare it to C for regular CPU architectures in that regard). The choice of higher level language to compile to EVM bytecode is decoupled from the Ethereum protocol itself.

The choice for functional languages does not come without tradeoffs. They tend to be inherently difficult to write a properly optimizing compiler for, simply due to the mutable nature of the memory of the physical machine where instructions are executed. In other words, it's very easy to write code that balloons like crazy in both processing time and memory usage. Performance is easily sacrificed. That's why it makes sense to have multiple languages or even multi-paradigm languages (C++ is an example of that in the physical CPU world), in order to have control over those tradeoffs. There is no one end-all solution as Cardano's sales pitch claims.

You are also conflating immutability of Haskell and functional programming languages in general with immutability of the blockchain ledger. They are two entirely separate notions. **Any blockchain is mutable by its very design, because any actor can release a client with protocol changes. If enough people adopt that client, the blockchain has officially turned mutable by precedent.**
Ethereum (and Bitcoin) are peer reviewed by everybody, **including** academics. Cardano pushing forward peer review as some sort of benefit implies that it **excludes** people from peer review. Or worse, that this is a cheap appeal to authority as a means of marketing to people that aren't familiar with the academic world and open source development in general. I personally consider the latter more likely considering [your track record](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7k6wos/what_does_ethereum_think_of_cardano_from_a/drck6h8).
Let's be honest here. Nobody uses Litecoin for anything. You are confusing price and market cap with fundamentals. What matters is the amount of developers and enterprises building solutions on top. Ethereum is lightyears ahead of any blockchain in that regard. Including Bitcoin.

I'm not saying ADA is another shitcoin. But I am saying that its chance of capturing market share is very small, seeing as it's drowning in a sea of self-proclaimed 'Ethereum killers', each of which provide little to no incentive for developers to lock themselves into a non-standard ecosystem. Research all of these some time: Waves, Tezos, EOS, Ardor, Stratis, ETC, NEO, Lisk, Qtum, Expanse, Aeternity, ... Each of these make claims similar in strength to Cardano's sales babble. Most of them have seen price pumps. None of them have captured significant market share, and none show any reason to believe that they will. It's like gambling on the least likely outcome and hoping that enough greater fools do the same thing.

I'd also argue that most of these Ethereum alts have as primary motive short term financial profit. When reality sets in, there is no incentive for them to attempt to compete, because they have already cashed in anyway. And given the suspicious way that Cardano and IOHK was funded and Charles Hoskinson's track record in general, that is most likely all the more true here. The victims are the investors that fall for the sales pitch after the price pump. Not Charles Hoskinson or IOHK.
You mention HyperLedger, but you're a bit behind the times there. Several of the largest members have left that consortium and joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance instead. See https://entethalliance.org/members. And they focus on both the public Ethereum blockchain and private implementations that bridge the limited privacy and scalability of the main chain for the time being (Quorum, EntEth, Coco).

Anyway, I'm just seeing a repeat of 2013: Bitcoin price pumped, followed by a wild growth of altcoins, each with a couple of interesting details or improvements here and there. None gained any traction to speak of beyond price movement, and when the bear market started in 2014, profit was taken and the projects left to die. Exactly the same is happening again, but people are doing Ethereum variations in the hopes of cashing in on the crowd that feels like they missed out.
Just to note that there is a known bug in this version. Entering a seed will crash the game. Haven't gotten around to a fix yet.
I'm not arguing the technicals of Cardano or their capability of implemention. I'm arguing the realistic chance of success, as well as the role of Charles Hoskinson in the whole story. Technicals are a surprisingly small part of success in practice (unless the value proposition is a notable game changer, which is not the case for Cardano, like it was for Ethereum versus Bitcoin for instance), because the combination of the people driving the project, including the existing third party developer ecosystem is what really drives it forward (Ethereum is huge there). In that sense blockchains resemble social networks to a great extent, and that is especially true for programmable blockchains like Ethereum, where developers can leverage existing dapps. Also, contrary to Bitcoin for instance, Ethereum does not tend to suffer from NIH syndrome. Should IOHK bring something to the table that is worth pursuing, it will be assimilated by Ethereum without qualms (it's all public domain research anyway). In fact this has already been happening with the K formalization of the EVM for instance. So the chance of Ethereum clones to succeed is decidedly small. And I'm sure Charles Hoskinson is well aware of that too.
I'm just tired of the malevolent actors in crypto. Just read through this post and the links contained therein with an open mind: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7k6wos/what_does_ethereum_think_of_cardano_from_a/drck6h8. I could understand dismissing a couple of signs, but this is an overwhelming pattern.

Anyway, I'm not here to give investment advice. I'm just saying that you should be mindful of obvious red flags and have an exit plan ready for when things do go sour.
How many of those are actual value transactions (as in denotable in USD)? Ripple also has millions of transactions, until you start breaking them down and notice that most of them are essentially completely free because the cost is carried by the centralized validators (order book entries mostly). Since Steem is similar to BitShares, I'm assuming that the actual value-moving transactions are only a fraction of the published statistics.
> 1) As far as I can tell, Cardano isn't being 'marketed' at all, and if you consider their whiteboards marketing then I can't see how they've somehow taken a moral high ground? They've taken a procedural high ground, sure, which is why a lot of us like the project.

Hoskinson has been in this space for a long time. He knows how to play the strings. The whiteboard presentations and interviews around Cardano are blatant appeals to draw in the new, uninformed investors which have been flooding into crypto. The dumb YouTube crowd ate it like cookies and is parroting it for him all over the place. For someone like me that actually knows what is happening behind the scenes, he's basically selling snake oil. The product is decent, but the claims are hyperbolic and dishonest. And that puts me off.

> 2) the medium article was about how evil the EF was for forking after the calamity of the DAO, and the commenter was attempting to lay that evil at Hoskinson's feet. The problem is that this was a big no-go for him, and where you hear the semi-famous 'code is law' quote from. Hoskinson was opposed to the fork, not for it.

That is not the interesting part of that article at all. The interesting part was his treasury proposal, which entailed forcing miners to hand him a part of the mining profits for 'development efforts', with his usual manipulation and sabotage to get it pushed through. It's the exact behavior he was kicked from the EF for after his very brief period as CEO. He is primarily in it for personal profit.

> 3) The on-chain governance is being set up to resemble Republican Democracies (representative democracy, not the US party). While no form of governance is perfect, this has many advantages over direct democracy (what allowed the DAO fork to happen).

You can't prevent the DAO fork from happening in the first place. That is an utter illusion. When enough people have incentive, nothing can stop a hard fork. I think you might also enjoy this recent article that goes in deeper nuance on the topic: http://vitalik.ca/general/2017/12/17/voting.html

> 4) Snarky, obnoxious, whatever. And if he doesn't have legitimate concerns about other projects, why should he go off and start his own anyway?

I think he showed his motive plenty of times. But I'll repeat it in the picture he posted himself again: https://media.giphy.com/media/94EQmVHkveNck/giphy.gif

> Note that I'm not the one downvoting you here, for what that is worth :)

No worries. You can't expect people with financial bias to vote objectively. They just want the ADA price to pump higher.
> Ethereum CEO is not an appeal to authority, but speaks to the persons past, which is ironically exactly what you're asking for when you say you invest in the people behind something.

He was CEO for a very brief period and was voted out quickly when his motives turned out to be primarily self-serving. The interesting thing is that him being fired from Ethereum was handled very discretely, with no public malintent towards his person that I could see. His constant attempts at publicly discrediting Ethereum in the ensuing time however forced the real truth of his manipulative behavior to surface. I think that you may not have properly read the list of articles and links that I've posted (I don't entirely blame you, as there are only 24h in a day), but the allegations are plenty and come with enough evidence to not simply wave away as coincidental or a single human error. There is a pattern here. When he left BitShares in 2013, even fellow money grubber Dan Larimer publicly described Charles Hoskinson as having deceived him with his charms, but ultimately hiding an agenda of manipulative greed. A classic sign of narcissistic sociopathy, and not a sign of someone that is willing to carry this project further than the money entering his pockets.

> Cardano is one of the only advancing blockchain I've come across, short of Ethereum, which doesn't overhype itself and which has a strong feeling towards letting the technology speak for itself.

If you consider Charles Hoskinson's white board presentations and interviews not aggressive marketing, you must have your eyes and ears closed. It's very aggressively targeted as an appeal to people that felt they missed out on Bitcoin and Ethereum.

> with the sentiment that Cardano has nothing but promises and a 'highly dubious sales pitch' going for it.

Cardano has a minimally functional blockchain running. Almost none of the promised features have implementations. And it's marketed everywhere, primarily by Hoskinson, as 'blockchain 3.0, after Bitcoin and Ethereum', with direct attacks towards Ethereum's address with regards to immutability (which is a guarantee that can impossibly be made in the first place), smart contract security (EILE does not provide any advantage over EVM in that regard, but apparantly writing the client in Haskell and offering some formal verification tools is sold as a silver bullet solution, which it squarely isn't, and EVM and even Solidity has those just as well). Cardano, along with the many other Ethereum coat tail projects, is poaching the sentiment of uninformed investors that feel they have missed out on Ethereum, and are easily deceived by FUD. I think you'll agree that Cardano could perhaps be considered an alternative Ethereum implementation, with its own strengths and weaknesses, but these kind of statements are just dishonest marketing. Especially considering that there are dozens of these self-proclaimed 'Ethereum killers' out there by now, and their value propositions and features are all very similar to Cardano. See Lisk, Waves, Tezos, EOS, NEO, ETC, Ardor, Stratis, Expanse, Qtum, Aeternity, ...

> Incidentally, "peer review" and "academic credentials" is also what we judge doctors, physicists, chemists, biologists, neurologists, psychologists, engineers, etc. etc. by; you know, those real-world credentials that mean you actually know what you're doing. They're not just fancy dress-up words. [...]

I will not disagree that credentials sometimes actually mean something. However waving around academic peer review as extra benefit implies that the scrutiny is **limited** to academics, where Ethereum (and Bitcoin) does not limit that scrutiny in any way to the academic audience. It is all-inclusive of who performs scrutiny, **including** academics. And the academic world is all over Ethereum, with vigorous, cross-discipline discussions taking place in public forums all the time, and educational efforts being deployed across universities. Cardano is simply making a false appeal to authority. A classic sales trick commonly seen on teleshopping channels. And one that primarily appeals to investors that do not have an educated background or, in disrespectful terms, dumb money.

As an end note, please let it be clear that I'm not commenting on the technical background of Cardano. It looks perfectly decent from the papers I've read (albeit mostly unimplemented). I see nothing particularly groundbreaking that could cause a significant market shift though. But maybe it finds its tiny niche. Like NEO is the Chinese Ethereum, maybe Cardano is the Japanese Ethereum (although I would argue that the metrics clearly point out that the actual Ethereum is already the Chinese and Japanese Ethereum by a huge margin).

Anyway, read https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7k6wos/what_does_ethereum_think_of_cardano_from_a/drck6h8 and the links properly and with an open mind. Filter out what you consider conjecture. I think you'll still find plenty to be worried about.
I don't have a beef with Charles in particular. I have a beef with the many unsavoury characters that are muddling the crypto ecosystem these days. Facts and metrics have taken the background to weekly hype pumps. And we all know what happens when the crypto bull market turns into a bear market: those pumpers take their profits and leave, just as happened after the 2013 Bitcoin alts rush.

You're right though. I have said what needs to be said. Onlookers will have to construct their own conclusion from that. I'm sure psychological (financial) bias will push most into a state of denial, but at least the facts are out there now.
I wonder whether it's possible to have it automatically redirect to this sub?
> but a 'backroom deal' with investors in Japan (who cares?)

Cardano is being marketed as taking a moral high ground, yet this doesn't concern you one bit?

> another was that Ethereum was in the wrong by forking afterthe DAO (yet Charles has consistently been against that fork

I have no idea where that word salad comes from. But I haven't claimed such a thing in my post?

> designing cardano so that 6% vote situations won't happen again, plus 'code is law'

Yes, Cardano is centered around on-chain governance, with the massive centralization concerns that go along with that. But you won't hear anyone mention those during the pump.

> and a third was just about posting tezos on an EOS sub (granted he was a bit snarky about some responses)

He is purposely shilling Cardano there and concern trolling these subs. That is a pretty big red flag for a proponent of a competing project. And not only that, but he replies to criticism to Cardano with this gif:  https://media.giphy.com/media/94EQmVHkveNck/giphy.gif. That is not 'snarky'. That is obnoxious and it shows that his true intent is fame and fortune. As has been shown so many times in the past, yet he keeps drawing in dumb money into his dead-end scams.

Note that I'm not taking a position here as to what you should or should not invest in. I'm just warning you for the pattern of exposed dubious motives of Charles Hoskinson. Just be careful and don't fall in love with your portfolio.
As somebody that has been in the crypto space for about 5 years, I know that the people behind a project are everything. And I will not invest in a project that has proven untrustworthy people at the helm. They always end up crashing and burning inevitably. And in the case of Hoskinson it will probably be his neverending need for fame and fortune that will be the end of it. I can't comment on the other people in the project.

The Steve Jobs comparison is a weak analogy that artificially tries to connect the success of Apple (which has a history and actual products, without scams) with Cardano (which has pretty much nothing but promises and a highly dubious sales pitch that entirely depends on Ethereum's success).

It's telling that the Cardano shills, including Charles Hoskinson himself, use every weak manipulation trick in in the book to attach credibility to Cardano, such as appeal to authority ('Ethereum CEO', 'peer review', academic credentials), claiming to be the third generation blockchain after Bitcoin and Ethereum (it's an Ethereum copy with some changes that favour centralization and buzzwords portrayed as silver bullet solutions, let's not kid ourselves), esoteric appeals to emotion/moral (regardless of the hypocrisy that entails), ... These are tactics most commonly seen in teleshopping and homeopathy ads, where things are not being sold by their merit, but by story/emotion. Dumb money is easy money.

Also, you're saying that public figures are going to be demonified. And to some extent that is true. But how many in this space get demonified with a list of concrete evidence to go along with that? I have seen only very few. Dan Larimer is another one, and even he accused Hoskinson of being untrustworthy.

I am not going to comment on the technical side of Cardano, because it looks decent enough. Not particularly compelling in terms of being able to compete significantly in the diluted market of the dozens of self-proclaimed 'Ethereum killers' already out there (Lisk, Waves, Tezos, EOS, NEO, Cardano, ETC, Ardor, Stratis, Expanse, Qtum, Aeternity, ...), but it looks decent enough.

I'm not a particular fan of on-chain governance and some of the other centralizing design choices that have been made. And I see 'peer review' as a weakness rather than a strength, because it implies a degree of elitism in which peers are *allowed* to review, rather than the open source method where things are completely open for scrutiny by everyone. But I'm mostly not a fan of the portrayal of the features of Cardano being dishonestly described as solving all of Ethereum problems. Because that is simply false advertizing. And not just in the sense of it being an exaggeration, but a flagrant lie.

So in short: Cardano is a bucket of red flags. And it shares that property with seemingly most of the self-proclaimed 'Ethereum killers' that pump into the market every month. It has little to no reasonable chance of capturing developer mindshare from Ethereum, so I will stay out.
I'll just leave this here: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7k6wos/what_does_ethereum_think_of_cardano_from_a/drck6h8

I don't think you should be flaunting your brief period as 'Ethereum CEO', considering the reason you were kicked out, your long period of public hate for Ethereum afterwards, and the ensuing hijacking of ETC as your personal cash cow and anti-Ethereum FUD device (even though ETC is by all accounts that same Ethereum you hated on for so long).

I'd say it's about time that the slew of new, uninformed investors in the space receive some protection from your dishonest claims.
I believe u/latelot has a GitHub repository with the code available.
Trade volume says a lot. Vast majority of NEO trade volume is on Bittrex and Bitfinex. And this has always been the case. If we assume that most Chinese investors moved to Korean exchanges, the difference becomes even more stark. NEO is being bought/sold almost exclusively by Western traders. Both Bittrex and Bitfinex require pretty strict KYC after all.

Some more sources:

- https://medium.com/@andrewkeys_88339/ethereum-growing-exponentially-in-china-31f1d24c8ee9

- https://btcmanager.com/russia-china-to-digitize-currency-with-ethereum

Another clear indicator is overall transaction volume. NEO processes at best a couple thousand transactions per day. Ethereum processes nearly a million (more than double of Bitcoin).

Have you seen any real proof of cooperation of NEO with the Chinese government beyond pump stories? Not only that, but is there any universe where it even makes sense to have a government controlled blockchain? The whole point of running the highly inefficient design of a blockchain is to have a fundamentally decentralized and trustless network. That is not something rooted in esoteric ideology. It's literally the reason why we're putting up with that design in the first place :)
Yeah, software clients really need to take cues from ETHGasStation. People are vastly overpaying. I just sent some ETH over for as little as $0.06 and it arrived in less than 30 seconds.
I hate to break it to you, but Ethereum is already the Chinese Ethereum by all reasonable metrics.
I'm a software engineer myself, and while Charles has a good familiarity of the space, he has always struck me as mediocre in his ability compared to most other proponents in crypto. Be that as it may though, I'm not referring to his engineering capability. I don't see how that has anything to do with his string of displayed dubious motive and the blatant dishonest marketing of his projects. You're welcome to try and find any such dirt on me or any of the members of the Ethereum foundation. I think you won't find even a fraction of evidence for all of them combined. If that doesn't say enough, you're simply stuck in denial, sorry.

You can't purge bad actors from crypto without naming them in combination with overwhelming evidence. It's that simple.
Ethereum doesn't run on Solidity. It runs on the EVM, which is well specified.
Exactly. And when competing projects dishonestly make claims of having ready solutions for this, while they either don't or, perhaps even worse, sacrifice the fundamental purpose of cryptocurrency/blockchain just to wave around impressive specifications, the average joe is easily persuaded into believing that they're buying into the next Ethereum. It's truly 2013 all over again, but instead of pointless/scammy Bitcoin alts, it's Ethereum alts now.
The fact that there are so many obvious pieces of 'dirt' to begin with says enough. Charles Hoskinson just so happens to leave a trail of it. Anyone that has been in this space for a couple of years knows to avoid him.
The problem is all the money grabs claiming closed form solutions, yet none are able to deliver while preserving decentralization. Cardano doesn't seem any different so far. Bold claims but very little substance in terms of actual value proposition.
'We'? You're only coming here to blatantly shill a project that dishonestly markets itself as an Ethereum killer (your comment history is public). Stop attempting to appear as choosing higher ground here. Nobody is fooled.

And indeed, I will call out certain very specific actors in the space that have shown a repeated pattern of dishonesty. Unfortunately such a thing is not possible without mentioning the bad actor in question by name. I see no other way of ridding crypto of these bad actors than calling them out with evidence, as I just did in this instance as well.
Do you realize that your comment history is public? Hiding behind a veil of civility is not enough to hide your real intent. We've all seen it too many times by now.

Sock puppets and shills are really taking advantage of r/ethereum's no-censorship policy.
They are not just my conclusions. They come from speaking to other people in the space. From everything I've observed, Hoskinson is a friendly facade hiding a narcissistic sociopath. Not the kind of person I want to see in the crypto ecosystem.

I've listed several worrying allegations with verifiable sources as well. This is a pattern. Not a single occurrence. Whether he was an agreeable guy in real life is unrelated to that. Reality is not a Disney movie where villains are caricatures of themselves after all.

Edit: Nevermind. Just looked at your comment history. You're a blatant Cardano shill. Should've guessed from the generic praise formatted like a sales pitch. Nobody buys the whole 'service to crypto and humanity' nonsense by the way. You're here to shill and concern troll. And so is Hoskinson in the Tezos and EOS subs. It's dead obvious.
Given Charles Hoskinson's track record, I'll need more than a statement as proof.
He's not a solid person. See https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7k6wos/_/dre8mmb

You are not a respected figure amongst insiders. Upon me bringing these allegations up on Twitter, you also immediately blocked me and removed the tweet I replied to. Let's see you try and delete evidence this time.
Having watched the Kik CEO talk on video about the move to Stellar, it's really pretty obvious that he's using his company as a pump device. Lack of regulation is both a boon and a curse to crypto unfortunately.
They're scared shitless because Ethereum is a complete and superior superset of Bitcoin. Since competing by merit has become impossible, desperate FUD attacks are their only option.
Brave is interestingly using Ethereum for its BAT token underpinning.
IOTA doesn't work yet, so I tend to not include it in valid projects. It's hugely centralized and seems unlikely to ever get its training wheels removed.
The fact that it is on crypto exchanges, sharing the name of the company. New, dumb money doing what they do best, and sharks taking advantage.
LTC bag holders. A lot of new people have entered the market, and they bought into the hollow slogans without performing any due diligence.
A Bitcoin clone that got false legitimacy by being added on Coinbase when Charlie Lee was still working there.
What about it? Are you confusing price pumps with fundamentals? Or did you fall for the debunked XRP on Coinbase rumour? You might want to read https://www.gdax.com/static/digital-asset-framework-2017-11.pdf. Coinbase and even GDAX will never add XRP. It fails way too many requirements.
It's worse than that. They have around 60% of the total XRP supply locked up. And new XRP are 'manually distributed' by Ripple **selling** those XRP in back room deals.
The reason for that is frustration that price and fundamentals get so decoupled.
Anywhere from $3,500 to $10,000 by March 2018 from the looks of it.
It would appear that my previous prediction may have been on the pessimistic side. Here is a new potential scenario: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/352817455380561920/390869577354969088/Screen_Shot_2017-12-14_at_15.15.36.png
Charlie Lee honest? You must be new.
I'm not sure what is the point of any Bitcoin fork or clone with Ethereum already around.
Expect FUD from the lesser eloquent soon ;)
I'm not a crime lord, so no risk there :)
On phone, but it's pretty easy and educational to reproduce this chart. I just used www.tradingview.com (ETH/USD on Kraken, because it has an all time chart).
Just use a bank safe for cold storage of your private key. That way you won't even be able to access the address yourself without physically going to the bank and identifying yourself. It also solves issues like inheritance automatically. The flat fee for such bank safes is usually relatively tiny.
You were shilling EOS in the past, which is arguably the most dodgy ICO of them all, with marketing on Times Square and taxi cabs, purposely aimed to draw in dumb money. Please cut out the hypocrisy.
You touch the most important point here. Bitcoin can *theoretically* do a lot of what Ethereum already does, even on a protocol level. The difference is that Ethereum is already doing them, with extremely low friction, and the largest developer ecosystem building projects, including tooling, on top of that protocol. Whatever Bitcoin tries to do will always be a catch-up game at this point.
People disagree. It's part of life. I never battled anyone.
They're buying LTC, so I don't think the term 'due diligence' even computes.
Yup. Seeing the same. But we might just as well burst through it though.
Hard to say. Both are as irrelevant as they come.
LTC is making its dead cat bounce here. Time to switch to ETH and ride fundamentals again.
I'm not even so sure. Do you see Bitcoin or Litecoin scaling at all? Ethereum outperforms them both massively. It's clear that Ethereum will gradually roll out solutions *that actually work* sooner than the both of them, so that bodes well for both fundamentals and price.
ETH is at the start of a rise. LTC is near the end of one. Guess where the smart money is.
So dumb and dumber.
You never know when these futureless shitcoins will break down.
Have you researched it? It's a pointless copycoin.
It's important that he displays as little charisma as possible, and gives an incoherent and vaguely mumbled explanation of Ethereum being 'cheaper' than Bitcoin. Clearly that is the way to do it.
Visit bitcoin.org some time.
There is no way of knowing. No fundamentals means total unpredictability.
I have no idea. The market isn't operating on fundamentals or news at the moment. ETH is a good investment. God knows what might be a good short term pump :)
BTC with forks (BCH, ...) and clones (LTC, VTC, ...). Completely worthless and next to zero utility. The people buying these things either operate on hearsay or buy LTC on Coinbase because it's the cheapest asset there and they think they're somehow doing a good deal. Even Charlie Lee dares to unironically claim that LTC is 'cheaper'. Shameless pumper as always. He knows his dumb money very well, as has been proven in the past.
It's official. We have entered a dumb money market. Stay safe and don't get sucked in late pumps, people.
Crypto has entered Eternal September. Fundamentals just don't matter anymore. It will correct back though. Better be on the side where the fundamentals are then (hint: it's not LTC).
I'm not sure there is all too much evolution from BTC to LTC :)
Uhm, even at peak congestion it cost at most $0.5 for processing a transaction in a matter of minutes. It's down to less than $0.1 now again because miners changed the gas limit. Way overblown FUD everywhere though.
I'm talking about blockchains that are actually decentralized and trustless. Ripple is centralized in pretty much every way imaginable. Calling XRP a cryptocurrency is on the farfetched side of reality. The more you bite into the fundamental value proposition of cryptocurrency, the easier it becomes to scale, but also the more absurd it is to pursue in the first place.
I would love to see the source of those ridiculous claims. Crypto seems to move on hearsay lately.
Nope. Just watch it yourself: https://cheddar.com/videos/ethereum-co-founder-joseph-lubin-on-cryptocurrency-futures
Umm, yes. Fees are a function of transaction count. LTC and the other clonecoins don't have on-chain transactions to speak of, so they seem fast and cheap to the layman, but given the same transaction count as BTC, let alone ETH, they would buckle exactly like BTC would. Just look at the fees and transaction times of ETH back when it was processing as few transactions as LTC and be amazed :)
There are no such coins. Several make dishonest claims though. Ethereum is spearheading with a distance when it comes to scalability.
You can't compare without on-chain transactions to speak of.
It is exactly the same. Just more greater idiots than in 2013.
I'm assuming you know who Joseph Lubin is? Watch this video until the end: https://cheddar.com/videos/ethereum-co-founder-joseph-lubin-on-cryptocurrency-futures

Ethereum futures are on the way. It's not a matter of if, but when. And he's the one to know.
Coming from EUR, Kraken is by far the best bet actually. Their platform is secure, despite the website difficulties. Other exchanges don't have EUR liquidity.
Litecoin higher than Ethereum says a lot about the type of finance jocks and general plebs that are currently entering crypto. It's a transitory state. That money will flow into actual fundamentals soon enough.
Yup, BTC went like 15x in 2017. ETH went more than 55x. And the ETH chart is still ridiculously bullish, and market cap is still immensely undervalued compared to BTC. If BTC manages to not fall over its own feet as usual, we're in for some fireworks in 2018.
There is a sentiment shift looming over Bitcoin. It's pretty much the most risky asset to invest in at the moment. And primary reason for that is Ethereum. At some point the obvious absurdity of Ethereum sitting below Bitcoin market cap will just be so undeniable that an exodus is bound to happen. You can only go so far on fumes alone.
Joseph Lubin said it's a matter of weeks in a recent interview.
Sure, and scaling solutions are around the corner. But people are being a bit unreasonable here. Ethereum spectacularly outperforms Bitcoin and all of its clones and forks as it is.
I wouldn't hold your breath on LTC.
$0.3 for getting the transaction through in a matter of minutes is too high and slow for you?
Bitcoin copy/paste. Exactly the same terrible scalability, but hidden by the fact that nobody uses it. Pointless clonecoin really.

If I understand correctly, ZK-SNARKS comes as a set of primitives that can be used in smart contracts. It's programmable privacy tailored by use case. Monero fees are very high, even with next to no on-chain traffic, and it's an all or nothing deal in terms of privacy. So I doubt whether that comparison makes any sense.
I think we're actually in agreement here. What is your position on blockchains that are basically permissioned and centralized from their lowest layer, yet dishonestly market themselves otherwise, though? Because that is what I'm mainly criticizing here (NEO, EOS, ...).
Calling MetaMask 'a wallet' already shows that you don't understand the implications of frictionless site login by blockchain address, and all without trusted third party.

Blockchains like Ethereum that strive for decentralization and trustless operation are hybrid in the sense that they admit perfection is theoretically impossible, but reachable on a practical level. Purposely centralized blockchains like NEO and several other self-proclaimed Ethereum competitors have a fundamentally flawed value proposition. What on earth is the purpose of these when Google, Microsoft or any other enterprise could release a functionally vastly superior solution in a heart beat?
I am aware that it is exactly that: a technology. But the *purpose* of that technology is maintaining a trustless, decentralized ledger. There is nothing philosophical or ideological about that.

Ever heard about the MtGox collapse? Or the Bitfinex hacks? The plethora of site password hacks/leaks? A blockchain considerably decreases single points of failure (I don't believe they will ever be fully eliminated). And it does this with less friction than existing solutions on top of that. Try MetaMask some time. I think you'll understand the value proposition better.

Either way, there is no point in having a 'hybrid' solution. It's disingenuous to claim otherwise. There should be the realization that no solution will be fully trustless and decentralized of course, but purposely striving for that and then profiling as a competitor by boasting better statistics is basically a scam.
I'm not a purist, but trustlessness and decentralization are the only reason to even pursue the hugely inefficient solution that a blockchain really is. There is no validity in 'hybrid' approaches whatsoever. It's a ploy to swoon uninformed investors, using the trendiness of blockchain as leverage.
Sounds anything but trustless and decentralized to me. Too many people are buying into private companies disguised as blockchains these days.
Blockchains are like social networks in many ways. Ethereum was processing 800,000 on-chain transactions per day this week, has hundreds of ICOs (thousands if you include obvious crap), a boatload of incredibly interesting projects, by far the largest developer community in the whole of crypto, and so forth.
With only a couple thousand transactions per day, literally only one or two ICOs and nothing of note happening in general besides the usual price volatility, NEO's value proposition seems far too weak to stay relevant, much like the dozens of other self-proclaimed 'Ethereum killers' out there (Waves, Ardor, Cardano, Expanse, EOS, Lisk, Stratis, ...).

What put me off in NEO is the sensationalist claims they make (it shares this with most other self-proclaimed 'Ethereum killers'), it's built on centralized shortcuts like DPoS (essentially a centralized Ponzi structure), and has next to no product to show for most of these claims. The claim for supporting existing programming languages in particular sticks out as a crowd pleaser that was not validated on the engineering side first, as existing languages tend to make very little sense as smart contract source code for a plethora of reasons.

In short, I haven't seen any self-proclaimed 'Ethereum killer' provide a value proposition that could compete with Ethereum by merit, and NEO is no different. Unfortunately a lot of investors are incapable of separating price from fundamentals, and get pulled into the pump stories without checking any facts or metrics. We've seen the same kind of thing happening around 2013, except back then they were Bitcoin alts. Now they're all Ethereum alts. And with every such Ethereum alt popping up, their value proposition only dilutes further.
Monero fills a niche for now. It will be assimilated by Ethereum as soon as zk-snarks applications roll out. I don't see a future in niche chains. Too much inefficiency.
I think crap like GRS, VTC, LTC and perhaps even BTC will not have much of a market left in 5 years. They're years behind the curve and the culture in those communities is not particularly about innovation.
Microsoft did no such thing unless you cherry pick facts. Every innovation or product builds on previous work. Blatantly copying code verbatim is something else though.
I'd rather hold none of that deprecated dinosaur technology. The whole Bitcoin (and forks) / Litecoin / Monero community creeps me out with their religious ideology and constant attacks on Ethereum by the spreading of misinformation. When even the developers lower themselves to that kind of petty behavior, it is clear to me that they simply lost the ability to compete by merit.
Yup, LTC can be a short term trade, like so many out there. But I wouldn't want to hold it without close supervision. No fundamentals keep it up.
Yes, and they all just copy/pasted it from the Bitcoin code repositories like monkeys, with as obvious goal to pump their pointless clonecoin. It adds nothing of note to the crypto ecosystem.
I think two other pointless clonecoins were first indeed. Vertcoin and Groetzlcoin, or something like that. Just like Litecoin they have zero benefit from SegWit, because they all barely process on-chain transactions to begin with.
You do realize that Litecoin is a source fork of Bitcoin with only a couple small tweaks, that just copy/pastes Bitcoin changes verbatim? Same happened with SegWit. They just took the code and pumped it. I consider it on par with ETC, except that you can replace opportunist crooks Barry Silbert and Charles Hoskinson with perpetual pumper Charlie Lee. We're talking about a guy that would shamelessly announce LTC pumps on the BTC-e trollbox chatbox. These people are poison to the progress of the crypto ecosystem and are shilling snake oil to the uninformed investors out there.
You mean the guy that spends a lot of his time concern trolling r/tezos and r/eos?

Or the guy that posts things like this? https://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/7h6hfi/my_thoughts_on_the_tezos_issue/dqohh15

Or the guy that was booted from Ethereum very early on because he was conspiring and backstabbing for fame and fortune?

Or perhaps the guy that was very negative in public about Ethereum until ETC (the Ethereum you despised so much in public, ironically) got launched and you took the position as important proponent together with Barry Silbert, another anti-Ethereum figure?

Or maybe the guy that gathered funds for Cardano and IOHK by shilling Cardano as no-lose investment to uninformed pensioners in Japan?

Should I really go on?
It's better described as nostalgia for me. Also haven't held BTC for at least a year.
Exchanges should keep track for you. They usually have export functionality too I think, so you can plug CSV data in Excel or whatever.
Install the MetaMask browser extension and go to CryptoKitties. You'll start to understand why this is big. CryptoKitties as such isn't the important thing, but an identity defined by an Ethereum account doing everything from automatic login to having proven ownership of assets. Kitties now, actually meaningful things later.
If they're looking for value, I wonder why they run into LTC though.
With all the suppression that is going on, after months and months of consolidation, ETH is like an intensely coiled spring. At some point it will just pop violently.
You must be cherry picking a very specific time frame for that to be true. Just look at https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=POLONIEX%3AETCETH.
The only reason we went that way last year was TheDAO. Currently market sentiment is almost orthogonal to that.
I guess historically it has.
Wrong blockchain. No CryptoKitties (or anything else of note) on ETC.
Now make that same comparison for 2017.
That's what BTC holders also do... by design :)
People often get confused between on-chain and off-chain operations taking time. Transacting from/to an exchange tends to be a lot slower than staying on-chain.

I have never experienced what you experienced though, even during the recent 'congestion'. Given a proper fee, the transactions have always come through in a matter of minutes. See https://ethgasstation.info for a good fee indication.
Bitcoin is indeed not useless, just like a Nokia 3310 is also not useless. It's just that almost nobody uses it. It's a collector's item.
That person would cash out ETC, not ETH. And that is a zombiechain anyway. I feel for the mom and pop investors that unknowingly invested in ETC thinking it was Ethereum though.
Do you have a computer science background as well? I am of the opinion that assessing TheDAO should be a multidisciplinary effort.
www.tradingview.com
Uhm. That is ETH's all time chart.
Not if that cap is reached in the next century :). It's all about inflation, and ETH performs pretty much on par with Bitcoin there. And with Casper coming it's poised to become more deflationary even.
It shows that a lot of people don't have the faintest idea about inflation/deflation and are willing to buy BTC for the same reason kids were buying Pokemon cards.

ETH has close to the same inflation as BTC, and will have less inflation towards and during Casper. People are betting on the wrong horse because shills are perpetuating a 'fixed cap is better' narrative.
Yes, it's the one thing that put a dent in their credibility for me: having Charlie Lee working there and adding LTC next to the likes of ETH and BTC only because of that. And then Charlie's sudden disappearance from Coinbase, covered with a narrative of him leaving to work full time on LTC. It really gives LTC undeserved credibility with the plebs out there. It just adds nothing of note to the market.
I wouldn't try to attach too much rationality to LTC price movement. It's best described as a dumb money market. Pretty much everyone knows that it doesn't have intrinsic value, so it's all in the exuberance over ridiculous narratives such as 'silver to BTC gold!' and 'more affordable than BTC!'. It scales terribly, just like Bitcoin, and the only reason it has manageable fees and transactions speeds is because nobody is using it. When ETH did that amount of transactions it was a lot faster and had far lower fees :)
The ETC price perhaps. ETH should only profit from finally having that zombiechain exposed for what it is.
Yes, the Ethereum protocol functions as an intentless computer. ERC20 tokens are mere smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. If regulators crack down, it will be on entities that create these tokens, not Ethereum itself. Shady ICOs like EOS and Tezos spring to mind.
That is not what Bitcoin did though. Sometimes the only way to see whether a system is worth iterating upon is by simply deploying it. If there is clear demand, as we're seeing with Ethereum, there is also incentive for that further iteration. Since Bitcoin's only utility seems to be acquiring BTC and hoping for greater fools, it doesn't benefit all that much from further iteration. It has to barely work for the very minimal utility it offers. I consider that a very weak value proposition personally.
That sounds like an inefficient subset of Ethereum to me.
And neither have you. But at least I tried.
Yes, it brings some tranquility in today's fast paced society.
That's what I assume as well. Guess we'll see ETC burn a deep hole into the ground soon. Main shills left the project and hacker has no choice to liquidate before the market burns ETC to the ground.
It's not exactly that simple. If such cat games are implemented using a state channels solution, the amount of on-chain transactions will be reduced massively on top of that.

Also, replace cats by real world assets and you have a proof of ownership model. Then combine that with uPort (identity) and you start to see why developers are flocking to Ethereum.
> ETH has no water to hold till it has practical and useful products out and being adopted actively by the market. Once that occurs, it is relevant as to what ETH does better than BTC.

Could you explain to me what practical and useful product BTC offers?
He has always hated Ethereum in general and only ever used ETC as a device to undermine Ethereum. I guess he now moved to the next scam. EOS runs on DPoS consensus, which makes it highly centralized and easily exploitable as Ponzi scheme. Dan Larimer, its main creator, has a history of launching such schemes.
It pretty much resembles necrophilia with a skeleton at this point.
That's the second proponent that leaves that project. I guess we all knew it was coming.
Ethereum is doing more like 10-20 tx/sec now, so I think you have your math wrong.
Oh, I've made a couple. This kind of analysis tends to work very well until it doesn't. I'm usually only wrong when my predictions are less broad and less strongly confirmed though.
I'm personally not going to try and time the market, but maybe you indeed get lucky :)
My only concern is that ETH will appreciate too much (with the local volatility that comes with that) to be considered as such.
You are blatantly lying or using unrealistic gas prices. Or are you sending from/to an exchange?
I'm not claiming there is a particularly better measure. It's all in the combination of different metrics.

1) Past performance is very often an indicator of future result, until it isn't. As said, my prediction obviously does not include large external factors. It's just based on a strong chart, my experience of seeing that chart to be a large factor in price behavior, and the notion that Ethereum is in a healthy state with a lot of growth potential.

2) I can find such a chart too. But please take note of sample size. Either way, the predicted range is very broad for a reason. Do you really believe that ETH will not be over $700 a year from now? Because that is what my prediction can be boiled down to.
Actually we popped the top of the channel back then, so my prediction might have been more optimistic. But the same channel minus the top line applied just as well then, albeit with less strong confirmation.
Haven't checked yet. I'll see if I can find a time slot in the next days.
I would not exactly call myself a chartist, but I do recognize very strongly confirmed and easily visible trends. I'm not claiming any absolute truths here either, so you can get off the high horse.
Thanks a lot for the effort.
You confirm exactly what I also believe: market cap is first and foremost a psychological metric. It has very little bearing on true value because only a small fraction of that cap even exists on the marketplace to begin with. It really is just last traded price times supply. Nothing more, nothing less. Conclusions made from that equation tend to be more in the eye of the beholder than rooted in verifiable fact.

In terms of transactions, I'm not sure where you're getting your data: https://i.redd.it/dreefk5ggkzz.png. It's pretty clearly visible that BTC is the one not following suit here. ETH is actually rather closely correlated.

$14,000 is the highest extreme of that channel a year from now. I don't believe it is out of reach, regardless of your fixation with market cap, but I don't consider it very likely either. My cautious expectation is the $700-3,500 range.
Investing/trading in crypto. Back then it was mostly BTC and some short rides on its many copycats that were appearing (which reminds me of the many Ethereum copycats appearing these days).
It's far less clear. I estimate the top either around $19k or $27k, but BTC is just moving on irrational exuberance at the moment. The good part is that there is a lot of new money flowing into crypto, and that tends to flow into strong fundamentals inevitably.
A hard cap doesn't matter in the slightest. Inflationary rate matters. And that inflation is similar to Bitcoin, and will go well below Bitcoin towards and during PoS.
I've been doing this for around 5 years now, and I can assure you that the chart is an incredibly important factor. Only way to tell is by waiting though. RemindMe! 1 year
So far the competition has not impressed me. None of them seem to be gaining any traction to speak of either. It really feels like 2013 all over again. It's all about the [developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRm0NDo1CiY). And Ethereum is a system that exponentially feeds on itself in that regard, as smart contracts can leverage other smart contracts for functionality. So, sure, one could argue that a compatible chain could just issue copies, but I think history has sufficiently pointed out that that rarely works out in terms of value proposition.
I think you didn't look close enough. Follow each line closely.
I don't see the connection between logarithmic charts and less FOMO.
That's what I also expect. And seeing as Coinbase seems to want to add ERC20 tokens first, Ethereum will be the one in the limelight.
The problem is that Ethereum does that same thing as well, but far better, along with a theoretically infinite amount of other things. It's a complete and superior superset of Bitcoin.
Here's an intro video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66SaEDzlmP4

I think the sidebar of r/ethereum may also have some good links.
If your sample size is one then history might suggest that. It's not 2013 anymore, and exchanges aren't losing multiple percent of the whole BTC supply any longer. The future of crypto was very uncertain in those days compared to now.
It's not being added. The people that were holding BTC during the fork are getting the BCH. The only thing they can do with it is withdraw.
It's a copy, with exactly the same scalability issues. The only reason it's faster and cheaper is because nobody is using it. It's processing less than 10% of ETH's transactions per day. Back when ETH processed so few, it was far faster and far cheaper than LTC is now, and more secure and decentralized on top of that (see uncle blocks, GPU mining, ...). LTC is somewhat of a running joke amongst people that actually understand how these blockchains operate :)
For IoT things like Plasma are pretty much a requirement. Perhaps Sharding could keep it all on-chain, but that is still some time away I'd say.
With regards to (3): Around 2013 the market was flooded with Bitcoin copycats, many of which were nearly identical in API too. None of them gained any traction. The most successful one (Litecoin) barely processes on-chain transactions to speak of to this day. Developers don't just dilute into copycats. The largest ecosystem grows exponentially.
I think it was more akin to Brian telling Charlie it's either LTC on Coinbase or Charlie at Coinbase. Charlie chose the former and then claimed to the community that he left Coinbase to help LTC thrive. Yeah...
Ethereum has a very broad scalability roadmap. See Casper, Sharding, Plasma, and so forth. It's already outperforming Bitcoin by incredible amounts, but the coming year(s) will be very interesting.
Around 2013 the market was flooded with Bitcoin copycats. None of them ever gained any traction to speak of until Ethereum came with a significant value proposition. Now the market is being flooded with Ethereum copycats. What do you think will happen? :)
No, it's the misinformation regarding Ethereum's supply. ETH inflation rate is nearly the same as BTC and will decrease further towards PoS. The fixed cap narrative is incredibly shortsighted, given that BTC's cap will only ever be reached in the next century to begin with :)

Basically the fixed cap seems to make some people go a bit Pokemon over Bitcoin, even though its scarcity is pretty much on par with Ethereum.
The simplest signals with most confirmations are also the strongest. Follow each line I've drawn there closely and you'll understand. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. And it's not like this prediction is particularly out there either. It's very broad, and we could just as well pass by $200-300 before that time, all without breaking down from that channel.
Because it's the only scale that makes sense in crypto. Just examine each line I've drawn there on that chart and you'll immediately understand. Crypto markets simply move logarithmically.
I'm sorry for your loss. I won't recommend you to take a loan to buy ETH, even though I'm pretty confident that you'll get even and then some. There is always the tiny chance of something very unexpected happening.
ETH is a great store of value. Whether it's a particularly great currency is another thing though. I'm more inclined to believe that an ERC20 (or updated protocol) stabletoken will fill that role.
I estimate the probability of that very low, but never say never I suppose.
Yes, there is a 0.000001% chance of that happening. That would require a hefty flash crash, and would probably be contained to a single exchange as well. A pessimist could see us touching $200-300 perhaps.
I'm well aware of market cap, thank you. Calling it the main performance indicator is perhaps a bit naive though. It's most of all the main *psychological* performance indicator. We all know that market cap and actual value are very far from a 1:1 relationship.
Would have, should have. They clearly did not make the right decisions.
It has been consolidating sideways. I think 'boring' is perhaps a better description. If you have some experience in these markets, you know what is about to happen soon ;)
Thanks for the entertainment :)
Why not just buy ETH again now and wait a year? At worst 2x return seems like a no-brainer to me.
That kind of prediction is a lot harder to make. The BTC dump yesterday showed ETH inversely correlating with BTC, and Ethereum is pretty commonly accepted as vastly undervalued, so it's at worst a good hedge against a BTC crash.
I don't really see $400 in one year, but we could visit $200-300 before that time. That is not what I'm predicting though. I guess that if there is a point to make, it's that by simply holding ETH for a year, there is a pretty much guaranteed 2-35x return to enjoy.
Why do you consider that to be the case?
It's not impossible or even extremely unlikely, but I try to keep my predictions rooted in observable reality for now :)
There's a reason my prediction is very broad. Given the extremely strong confirmations of this channel on the all time chart, it seems very unlikely that we break down out of it.
Well, Ethereum is the ecosystem that is attracting most of the development, by far. And adoption is literally outpacing development efforts. So I'd say his analysis is very on point.
I'm talking about some sort of verifiable link. Not hearsay. Google turns up completely blank.
Source?
I think a reasonable, cautious prediction might be the $700 to $3,500 range. But Ethereum is the #1 blockchain by most metrics, and crypto never ceases to amaze ;)
Well, it was never used much in the first place. Adoption has been pretty steadily declining though. Last example is Steam dropping Bitcoin support entirely.
Well he has been investing a lot of time and money into Ethereum, so it's only logical that he spent that time and money expecting good returns. Investing doesn't tend to be a particularly altruistic activity, so I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make.
Ethereum futures are also coming in a matter of weeks, at least according to Joseph Lubin: https://cheddar.com/videos/ethereum-co-founder-joseph-lubin-on-cryptocurrency-futures.

It's impossible to tell what any of these will do with the market. All I know is that this strongly confirmed channel on the all time chart will be extremely hard to break down from.
It's a very broad prediction which I consider highly probable. But everything is indeed possible.
It's not the only chart that matters at all. The market clearly trades in function of fiat. Since 2017 the ETH/BTC chart has basically turned to noise. ETH has decoupled pretty firmly. Clear evidence of that is the stability of the ETH/USD price while BTC is more volatile than ever.
Yup, expectations have to be managed here. Scalability solutions will start to trickle in during 2018, but patience is in order. Adoption is quickly outpacing development. Reminds me of dailup internet in the early 90's.
I think you missed a career as a hip hop artist.
Actually they will only allow you to withdraw BCH balance of BTC held there during the fork. BCH will not be added otherwise. Unless that situation changed in the meantime?
I would be disappointed as well, but it's still a great ROI of course.
Those 'ogs' tend to have an agenda. Scroll through this thread or my comment history. I've clarified it with some links.
Just use www.tradingview.com.
That seems pretty unlikely. Also unlikely, but less so, is perhaps a visit into the $200-300 range on the way.
It's not an assumption. It's the very top end of my very broad prediction. I think the average of $3,500 is probably closer to reality.

Also, Ethereum's inflation rate will only decrease from here. Inform yourself.
Predications are based on probability. You don't hear me saying that this chart is absolute truth. I'm just confidently claiming that this (very broad) range has a high probability of being maintained.
I wouldn't hold your breath for that.
Do you see me claiming otherwise? Read the title and examine the chart.
That makes no sense. Why would you use something slower and more expensive when you can just as well not use it at all? There is no logic in that whatsoever :)
I think you need to work on your reading comprehension.
I don't get it either. Some sort of weird second mover advantage? It's a pointless copycoin in my book. Same scalability issues and same dinosaur technology in general.
Trust me. I do. You might want to take a look at the total crypto market cap of the past year.

Also, $14,000 is the very top end of the range. That is not what I'm predicting.
Actually, past trends are most often an indicator of future performance... until they're not. But probability favours past trends by a huge margin.
It's what comes closest to a unit of global purchasing power, and the whole crypto market trades in function of it, so I'd say it's money, at least for the time being.
ETH was around 90% of BTC's market cap last June.
Bitfinex' move towards a decentralized, Ethereum-backed exchange platform. See https://www.ethfinex.com.
ETC? I'm sorry :(
You're not entirely incorrect. When these lines have as many confirmations as they are, I'd say it vastly increases the probability that they are a self-fulfilling prophecy though.
I use www.tradingview.com for all my charting needs. I don't have a direct link unfortunately, but it should be easy (and perhaps educational) to reproduce the chart.
Logarithmic charts equal linear charts in the short term, so that doesn't really matter. And even in short term I've noticed that the logarithmic chart dominates.
Actually a good idea.

RemindMe! 1 year
The ratio to BTC is not really what the market is trading against. Just look at the stability of ETH/USD while BTC is making insane volatile moves these days. At best the ETH/BTC ratio will trigger an ETH rally when people start to realize how undervalued it is compared to BTC.
I think 'deflationary' might be too big a word for this guy :)
> Ethereum is uncapped so there is a bottomless supply.

Try getting your information from somewhere other than r/bitcoin. That is obviously false. I've provided links to more information somewhere else in this thread.
Here are two links that should clarify some things:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5izcf5/lets_talk_about_the_projected_coin_supply_over

- https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ

At any rate, the total number of ETH and the cutoff date matters rather little. It's the inflation rate that matters.
Actually, my prediction doesn't say that it will keep rising at all. We could just as well visit $200 before that, all without even breaking down from that channel. I'm just putting things into perspective with regards to local volatility versus the global picture.
Actually it's pretty well known that ETH inflation will tend to zero, but perhaps less so by the general market.
While I appreciate the existence of such an index, I think it's not always the best idea to diversify in a market where 99% of the assets are obvious turds.
Actually, Joseph Lubin just said in an interview that Ethereum futures are mere weeks away. Source: https://cheddar.com/videos/ethereum-co-founder-joseph-lubin-on-cryptocurrency-futures
Thanks for the input. Some argumentation would be nice though.
Just examine each line that defines this channel. It is as accurate a prediction as can be made over such a long time span.
The Ethereum foundation is largely funded by ETH holdings, so they definitely do have that interest. Also, a higher ETH price doesn't change anything about Ethereum's utility.

Edit: And indeed, as pointed out in https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7i5vgp/eth_price_in_one_year_between_700_and_14000/dqwjbhy, the Ethereum foundation obviously does not control the rate of ETH issuance.
Investors want percentage returns. A logarithmic chart shows the distance from $1 to $2 as having the same length as the distance from $100 to $200. The whole market only acts on the logarithmic chart.
It's not even 1% of BTC's market cap. So let's be real here. Below #1 and #2 there exists really mostly gambles. None of those coins have considerable on-chain transactions that indicate utility.
Sure. You can never predict that. Ethereum and crypto in general have grown tremendously in resilience since 2013 though. I don't think we'll easily see year long bear markets anymore. Crypto has been accepted as a thing that is here to stay.
I do: https://cheddar.com/videos/ethereum-co-founder-joseph-lubin-on-cryptocurrency-futures
What does Reddit karma buy you exactly? :)
The market tends to be irrational short term, but pretty rational long term.
And I thought my predicted range was broad ;)
Analyze the lines. They're not random.
Gladly, no.
Price predictions are for r/ethtrader.
It's a a low market cap coin. Very high risk, but perhaps high reward too, like so many gamblecoins out there.
Ethereum is a complete superset of Bitcoin, 'bro'. And perhaps you should read his full comment before writing a triggered response, 'bro'.
The mentioned average of $3,500 is really just that, an average. We could just as well break up out of this channel and land even higher than $14,000. At this point I see that as far more likely than breaking down out of the channel at least.
I think that is a very exact prediction to make over such a long time span. That's also why my prediction is so broad.
If we have to believe Brian Armstrong from Coinbase, ETH is the place to be by far, with BTC second. He doesn't even seem to consider LTC. See https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-12-07/coinbase-ceo-on-crypto-surge-bitcoin-futures-irs-video
Yes, and that crash shook all the shit from the tree, leaving the likes of Amazon and Google to thrive in the years after. Also, weren't you there when ETH 'crashed' down to $130 from $420 a couple of months ago?

Don't try to time the market. You'll outperform most of the active traders with ease.
See https://blog.ethfinex.com/the-ethfinex-roadmap-7c7cd82c835c

I expect the first phase to roll out in a matter of weeks to months at worst.
No, I'm more thinking of fast, programmable and trustless transactions. The kind that enables new possibilities without relying on some third party or being burdened by government intervention.
The logarithmic chart is literally the only chart that matters. People watching linear charts are essentially blind. It never fails to amaze me that a lot of exchanges still only offer linear charts, and that charting websites in general default to the linear chart as well.

And indeed, last year the fundamental sentiment around Ethereum was rather negative. This year there is a noticeable shift happening in the industry towards Ethereum as lead ecosystem.

Relative market cap has never been so decoupled from reality as today.
Examine that chart and each trend line very closely and you'll understand why this prediction is bound to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. There is a LOT of new money entering the crypto space, and it's not just going away.

That said, it is also not entirely impossible that we first touch the $200-300 range before that time. I won't be silly by trying to time the market when there is such a high certainty of high returns by just holding though.
I don't subscribe to that FUD. There really is very little indication that they have solvency issues beyond one Twitter account's claims. And I've come to believe that the most logical explanation for the correlation between USDT supply and BTC rising is simply the on-ramping of new fiat into crypto.
I'm mostly confident that this strong channel will not be broken downward due to the obvious shift of important crypto proponents towards Ethereum. Ethereum futures are arriving in mere weeks. Coinbase is clearly shifting focus towards Ethereum. Bitfinex is launching Ethfinex soon.

See also this recent interview with Brian Armstrong of Coinbase: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-12-07/coinbase-ceo-on-crypto-surge-bitcoin-futures-irs-video

When he's asked about Ethereum, Bitcoin and Litecoin, Ethereum gets a lengthy and passionate explanation with quotes such as 'processes more transactions than Bitcoin' and 'I personally see more developers building apps on top of Ethereum' (too lazy to watch the video again, so paraphrasing here). Bitcoin only gets a brief mention as 'digital gold'. Litecoin is just plainly ignored and not mentioned at all. That shows that he has a very clear overview of what is really happening in crypto in terms of fundamentals, regardless of short term price movements.
> Sending money from one account to another is rarely that time sensitive

You must be kidding.
Bitfinex as well, with the impending launch of Ethfinex. That's two of the by far largest exchanges setting their focus on Ethereum.
Why? Bitcoin is in a constantly clogged state, with fees close to $20 and transaction times of hours. Yet nobody seems to mind ;)
Bitcoin is processing far less transactions at fees of more like $20 per transaction, all while taking up to hours to complete such transaction on top of that. Ethereum is currently as good as it gets in crypto without sacrificing the fundamentals merits of a blockchain (decentralization, trustlessness, ...). I can't wait for further scalability improvements either, but patience is key.
There has been some discussion about improving clients to suggest a gas price. I think there are some caveats though.
Using https://ethgasstation.info as guideline should be safe as well. No issues whatsoever here either, even at peak 'congestion'.
What gas price did you set? You may have to use a couple of pennies more. I haven't had any issues whatsoever with mere pennies as fee. Use https://ethgasstation.info when in doubt.
I personally haven't seen any evidence of him using multiple accounts. Though I sometimes wonder how his ego is even able to fit in a single account ;)
Price discussion goes in r/ethtrader. Thanks.
So, how is it even possible to distinguish between a hack and an exit scam or insider theft?
Article is from today, so I hadn't seen it yet. I guess congratulations are in order. I hope this will serve as a proof of concept for Ethereum's multitude of state channel solutions currently in development.

Casper seems closer than you assume: http://www.trustnodes.com/2017/11/28/ethereums-proof-stake-casper-testnet-nears-launch

Raiden is also approaching. uRaiden is already being debugged on mainnet: https://www.coindesk.com/microraiden-payment-channels-go-live-ethereum-network

Plasma solutions are also in active development, with OmiseGo seemingly spearheading the effort. Expected to go live in 2018 last I read.
I'm not sure what your reference point is, but I haven't noticed much of a difference, even during congestion. Fees are still very low and transactions go through in seconds to minutes. Do you actually use Ethereum in any capacity?
You're not exactly coming with a strong argumentation there.
1. The fact that it already outperforms it in strides, at higher security and higher decentralization of nodes.

2. The abundance of information released on Casper, Sharding, Plasma, Raiden, TrueBit, ...

3. The fact that Bitcoin is an extremely slow mover, with some solutions like Lightning being talked about for years without any real results in sight, while Ethereum already has microRaiden in testing, Raiden in the pipeline, and Plasma solutions also in the pipeline. And on-chain there is Casper soon to be deployed on testnet.

4. The fact that the Bitcoin developer community seems convinced that proof of work is the end all solution to blockchain consensus, bringing generally very weak arguments to the table to support that.

5. The overall difference in community attitude, where the Bitcoin side (including developers) tend to be blinded by status quo and ideology and expect the rest of the world to subscribe to that, despite contradictory metrics. The Ethereum community has an overall pragmatic and more divergent thinking attitude, so things actually get done.
Do yourself a favour and Google "formal verification evm" some time. You seem to wrongfully assume that such a thing doesn't exist for Ethereum. In fact there are several competing solutions.

You also seem to wrongfully assume that formal verification is some sort of silver bullet solution.
I think expectations have to be managed most of all. It's clear that most of the research and development effort is already going towards scalability right now.
The difference lies in that fact that the Ethereum community recognizes these problems and is actively working on scalability solutions. There is a broad scaling roadmap, both on- and off-chain, that has plenty of resources to scrutinize and milestones to observe. Ethereum already scales considerably better than Bitcoin regardless, but will only get better as time goes on.
A new EVM transaction that makes it easy to execute multiple transactions in parallel, with builtin incentivization so dapp developers will actually use it too.

The description at the top of https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/648 is not too hard to follow though.
This definitely looks like something worth considering.
I am aware. However IOTA is not trustless and decentralized. And it shares that with several other projects that boast crazy statistics. I'll become less of a sceptic if it ever manages to get its training wheels removed.
I also wonder how many of those published transactions actually incur a cost. I'm guessing that the daily transacted value in terms of purchasing power is very low.
'no fees' is somewhat of fallacious end game. Transactions have to be processed trustlessly and decentralized. Someone has to carry the cost of that. So even if there are no direct fees, that cost has to ripple into the market in another way.
Well, and Ethereum. See ZK-SNARKS.
Simple questions:

- How many of the reported Steem transactions actually incur a cost? 
- What is the daily transacted value in purchasing power (fiat)?

If we know these simple facts, we can start making a first comparison.

Edit: Thanks for the downvote.
I'm not buying/selling these kitties either, but who are you to determine what does and does not have value? Steem is no doubt littered with what I would also consider terrible content, but if people are willing to pay for that content, who am I to judge them? That's just how the free market works.

And when I mean value transfer, I mean that actual purchasing power is being transmitted, without any room for subjectivity. A payment in other words. In the case of Ripple for instance, the vast majority of its so-called 'transactions' are entries being put on an order book, at zero cost.

How many of the reported Steem transactions are actual payments?
It certainly is. What else would you call the exchange of assets on a marketplace?
And how many of those actually transfer value? Ripple also claims over a million transactions, but when you then scrutinize those statistics, it turns out that a mere 20-30k of them are actual value transactions. The rest is just administration counted as transactions to beef up the statistics.
From what I understand, the token is mostly a method for funding the project indeed.
We're done here. You're beyond help at this point and I have wasted enough time. You are clearly just being purposely overbearing.

Congratulations. You won the conversation by distance. Maybe one day you'll learn to realize that conversations aren't about victory or defeat and we'll actually get somewhere.

That reminds me that I'd still love to hear your explanation as to why transactions have risen significantly despite months of price stagnation and severely lower exchange trade volume during that whole time. You refused to even visit that topic "because I'm an asshat", yet I think you'll agree it is actually very relevant to the discussion. Do you ignore it because it doesn't fit your narrative?
Tripling down. I guess you expect to be treated like you treat others when they make a minor human error. That would explain the inability to just admit such tiny mistake and move on. People generally aren't pedantic, overbearing bullies like yourself, so you can relax.
Really too much to name. Here's a quick grab from the top of my head:

- https://www.coindesk.com/axa-using-ethereums-blockchain-new-flight-insurance-product

- http://www.trustnodes.com/2017/04/29/germanys-energy-giant-launches-100s-ethereum-based-electric-cars-charging-stations

- https://www.coindesk.com/united-nations-sends-aid-to-10000-syrian-refugees-using-ethereum-blockchain

- ...

Then there are things like Raiden, Augur, MakerDAO, Status, and huge amount of other projects. www.stateofthedapps.com is a curated list of dapps on Ethereum.

There is really too much to name. Ethereum has by far the most third party developers creating projects in crypto. Perhaps some other users can chip in and list some more interesting projects. It's impossible to keep track for me :)
> My **speculation** of you being a bitter concern troll due to selling your ETH well below $20?

You can't cherry pick parts from a sentence like that to prove a point that doesn't exist.
You're still asking proof of something I didn't even claim to begin with? Are you serious?

> What part about "nuance it" == "moving the goalposts" is unclear to you?

That would make sense if I didn't nuance it **in the same damn sentence**. And I even repeated it a second time to clarify. I don't even...
Dude. It's alright to just admit that you accidentally didn't read the part where I explicitly state it to be speculation. We're all human beings. Small mistakes like that are fine. I won't judge you over them at least. You really have no idea how immature you appear by trying to double down like that.
> Given that it's the kind of thing that only I'm capable of knowing the truth of, those two are actually equivalent.

In that case I have refuted your accusations as well. Glad to have that sorted out.

> Oh no, you absolutely are stating it as absolute truth. You have a problem with absolutes, apparently.

Where do you see me stating that motive as absolute truth? I literally clarify in the same sentence that it cannot be proven. Do you stop reading as soon as you get triggered or something? :)
Which accusation was that? My speculation of you being a bitter concern troll due to selling your ETH well below $20? If I have ever worded that as accusation, I apologize. It's merely a speculation of your motive.
From https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7gt8we/against_onchain_governance/dqr8osl:

> Cherry picking a part of a paragraph as requiring hard proof, while I literally disprove/nuance it in that same paragraph is just being a troll and wasting my time. It doesn't prove a point or move the discussion forward in any way. It's just antagonistic behavior, aka trolling. For your convenience, I've provided a link to this behavior, which you somehow keep posting every time in an attempt at discrediting me, even though it proves my point exactly: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/739pt9/this_is_why_we_need_ethereum/dnr7qku.

I think I've clarified myself enough by now on that matter. You're asking for proof of an incomplete statement, pulled out of its context. In other words, you're asking me to provide proof for something I'm not claiming in the first place. How is this still not clear to you?
> Funny, I could say exactly the same thing about you and the vote manipulation accusations.

Yes. And that is fine. I merely speculate on your motive. You stated these accusations as absolute truth several times, with zero evidence to support them. And even when clearly pointing out that there is not even an indication of vote manipulation to speak of, you just don't want to back down. Just like your other claims of vote manipulation have next to zero evidence to support them besides your vague claims, yet you keep spreading that same narrative.
Denied, not refuted. As said, I'm not stating that motive as absolute truth, but it sure happens to line up well with your past statements, your overinflated ego, and the ensuing bitter concern trolling.
You never refuted it. You merely denied it. Your word means very little to me as far as truthfulness goes. And to be honest, if that really is the reason for your bitterness, I don't think your overinflated ego is capable of admitting the mistake you made by selling anyway.
I'm not 'getting angry'. I am just getting tired of your use of conjecture and seeming belief that people must somehow value your word over theirs to 'prove' a point. You are probably the most self-important person I've ever had the displeasure of conducting a conversation with, and that self-importance is clouding your judgement severely.

All I've ever really accused you of is being an embittered concern troll that has a bone to pick with Ethereum. And I speculated that this was because you just sold very low and were too stubborn to buy back in. Whether that motive is correct is something I will leave in the middle, but it's not uncommon, and the events do line up.
Here are links to the start of this whole derailed discussion:

I don't see anything wrong with those statements at all. You just get triggered whenever someone doesn't just blindly take your interpretation as absolute truth.

That reminds me that I'd still love to hear your explanation as to why transactions have risen significantly despite months of price stagnation and severely lower exchange trade volume during that whole time. You refused to even visit that topic "because I'm an asshat", yet I think you'll agree it is actually very relevant to the discussion.
What I think sets Ethereum apart from a lot of other projects out there is exactly the honesty in admitting that scalability is a non-trivial issue that will take time and effort to resolve. 5-10 years seems like a long time though. And scalability will evolve in very noticeable steps, so it's not like we'll suddenly move from today's state to full scalability. The market will also adjust to the increased scalability over that time.

When a cryptocurrency claims to have suddenly 'solved' scalability, rest assured that there are a lot of caveats to that claim, and it's most likely a claim designed to draw in dumb money. I'm not going to name projects that do this, but well... It's seemingly all of them these days.
Dude, what do you really expect? Vote manipulation is very hard to moderate, and as far as I know it's not the sub moderators that are responsible for this in the first place. It's the Reddit backend itself that tries to protect against that. And as you pointed out: if it happens, it probably happens in both directions. Stop being a whiny infant about it already.

> I never said the manipulation was purely for me... you said that. Interesting.

Ok, I've had enough of these baseless accusations now. Show me evidence of any vote manipulation by me, against you or otherwise. Stating that such a thing is not provable does obviously not count as proof that it must have happened. Your word is not in any way superior to mine after all (even though I honestly think that might be the belief system you operate in).
Let's set this very straight:

- I rarely ever post in r/ethtrader. Haven't been a regular there for ages. And posting in there should not be a necessary cause of prejudice either, regardless of your personal little vendetta with that sub. Stop conflating and polarizing thousands of people into an oversimplified narrative. The ETH price is a perfectly valid topic of conversation. Though I'm most certainly glad the moon kids have their separate sub.

- I am also not participating in their token thing. I got offered, but I did not react. u/carlslarson should be able to confirm this, if he even cares enough to do so (I wouldn't blame him if he doesn't). I honestly don't even know the premise behind the token beyond what you just told me. You seem more familiar with r/ethtrader than myself these days :)

- I have never used alternative accounts to manipulate votes. My comment history should make that immediately obvious, but obviously such a thing can't be proven with certainty.

Stop with the wild accusations. They are purely based on wishful thinking and conjecture, and driven by your irrational anti-Ethereum crusade, which I still believe to be emotionally driven by you selling ETH well under $20 (even though that motive can obviously not be proven either).
Ok, so I disprove your conjecture, and a new accusation is flung at me as deflection? I rarely ever even visit other subs to begin with, but I indeed warned about Charles Hoskinson in a couple of subs. Rightfully so, I think you'll agree.
Put up proof of any vote manipulation and me using alternative accounts in any way. Your word does not count as proof, even though you seem to assume that it somehow does.

If I recall correctly, back then your idea of proof of me using multiple accounts was one or two discussions with you where I got a meager couple of upvotes more than yourself. Are you really self-important enough to think that I would go through the effort of making multiple accounts, only for getting a couple of votes in one or two discussions with you? I don't think anyone cares enough about you to go through such ridiculous effort.
Wait, is this another accusation based on conjecture? Do you ever stop?

Pro tip (ugh): Look at my comment history. I rarely ever even visit r/ethtrader. Haven't for ages.
I think I should just write a bot to keep you triggered. This is getting beyond ridiculous.
Let's use your famous words then (except I'm not using them to deflect from the discussion at hand): Put up or shut up.
You have accused me in the past of using multiple accounts to downvote you though. And just like right now, all you used as evidence was vague conjecture, seemingly driven by the delusion that people disagreeing with your little crusade must equal vote manipulation.

Stop being a self-important douche already.
I'm not telling any stories. If anyone cares enough, they can just click our usernames and see for themselves.
You have been claiming this for a long time, well before r/ethtrader came with the token idea (which seems to have very little traction anyhow), and always only when the votes were opposing your little anti-Ethereum crusade. You even accused me personally of having multiple accounts when met with downvotes in our discussions. How about providing some actual proof beyond wishful conjecture? Otherwise I can only conclude that you're once again [lying in an attempt to poison the well](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7gt8we/against_onchain_governance/dqrx76o).
> Same thing happened with Eth.

And dozens of pointless shitcoins. That's not exactly a valid comparison.
Actually, Vlad and others have repeatedly warned that Ethereum currently does not scale well at all yet. Adoption is just outpacing the scaling roadmap far sooner than expected.
Price discussion in function of protocol fundamentals is all fine here. It is an undeniable parameter of the protocol after all.
I posted that simple link to your comment history because almost every damn thing you post is soaked in negativity. It doesn't even require a search.
As said: our comment histories are public. Not that anyone in their right mind would care enough to peruse them :)
First of all, this is a press article. Second of all, notice the quotes around every mention of "unlimited". They're there for a reason. It's just a figure of speech.
> You insist we agree on something we actually disagree on

Oh, but we do agree on the issue you refer to. It's just that your description of that issue is far more hyperbolic and dramatized than mine, but it is by all accounts the same issue, backed by the same data. Do you hear me denying the verifiable facts? Where we do disagree is in our approach and attitude to that issue and its future implications (brutal linear extrapolation versus believing that the market finds a way), not the actual issue itself.

> entirely different under normal standards of logic

And I'm guessing you define those normal standards? Judging by the overall dislike towards you in this community, I'm not sure those standards are representative. But I'm sure you'll explain that with more conspiracy theories and pointing out how everybody here is a brainwashed r/ethtrader shill, regardless of the many attempts at civil conversation that I and others have attempted with you that invariably ended in a roundabout of pointless semantics and pedantics and you squirming to not lose face (which should just not be a priority in an open discussion in the first place). Not to mention the several times that I pointed out to you that acting like a total douche does not exactly contribute to the willingness of people to engage seriously with you. You simply refuse to acknowledge that you are a human being with flaws like the rest of us, and that the world does not revolve around your personal perception of it. It's a sign of immaturity.

> You seem to expect that I need to back up all of my statements with evidence

Evidently. And I think expecting the opposite is also fair. I think you, as well as me, need to be careful about not putting words out of context though. Cherry picking a part of a paragraph as requiring hard proof, while I literally disprove/nuance it in that same paragraph is just being a troll and wasting my time. It doesn't prove a point or move the discussion forward in any way. It's just antagonistic behavior, aka trolling. For your convenience, I've provided a link to this behavior, which you somehow keep posting every time in an attempt at discrediting me, even though it proves my point exactly: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/739pt9/this_is_why_we_need_ethereum/dnr7qku. 

> You take offense to unfounded circumstantial accusations against your person

I'm not sure where I've taken offense against such accusations, but I'm sure you have a curated collection of links of that. I'm not even sure when I received such accusations in the first place to be honest.

Until you change your behavior and stop constantly poisoning the well, I will not stop calling you out for it. It's that simple. People are trying to create something here, and while criticism is certainly necessary and even appreciated, your constant barrage of defeatist concern trolling, smug high horsing and machine gunning this sub with the same concern troll narratives over and over is simply not.

Check comment histories. The guy is often just downright toxic, regardless of his occasionally valuable input.
Our comment histories are still public.
The friction of moving it out of a wallet for selling is so incredibly high that you have almost no choice but to hold it. I'm joking of course, but the irony is that this may not even be so far from the truth.
We're seeing a lot of very dishonest marketing from other protocols most of all. They are promising things they cannot deliver without severely diminishing the fundamental value proposition of blockchains/cryptocurrencies in the first place. Unfortunately their claims are impossible to distinguish from honest projections for the average investor. Developer ecosystem metrics are very clear though.
> The argument was that unlimited scalability was said to be here around now

I challenge you to find the source of that assumption. I don't think there was ever even a promise of 'unlimited scalability' to begin with.
Little to none according to anyone I've heard so far.
Hm, seems like I need to revisit this topic. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction.
There is a gas limit on the miner side as well, which unfortunately doesn't adjust as elastically as desired at this point.

And you're correct that raising the gas limit is somewhat of a bandaid solution that will increase fees during times of high traffic (the fees will still be very low though, especially compared to Bitcoin. Plenty of headroom there in comparison).

Edit: Sorry, this might be wrong or at the very least incomplete information. See comments below.

You've touched on the reason why scalability is the top priority research in the Ethereum space. Casper, Sharding, Raiden, Plasma, ... can't come soon enough.
It is unfortunate how so few actors can poison the well so easily.
Yes, adoption is outpacing scalability like crazy. I don't think anyone expected so much utility so early. That said, the miners really just have to increase the gas limit at the moment. It's somewhat of an ongoing default settings issue.
Which cognitive dissonances exactly?
Well, you're certainly a special character, and it would explain a lot.

By the way, I'm really not treating this conversation as some sort of match where eventually a winner and loser emerges. So I think you're projecting emotions on me that just aren't there. Not sure where you see squirming either. It's really as if we're having two different conversations altogether :)
Really, you need to stop taking things so extremely literal. Why on earth would I claim that you're *literally* always an asshat? In what universe does that even make sense? :)

And the effort you then put into digging up proof over something so inconsequential is downright insane as well. Am I correct in assuming that you're somewhere in the autism spectrum? That would explain so much. It would definitely explain the extreme focus on pointless pedantics. Not meant as insult by the way.
I replied before you made that edit. And now you build a whole argumentation over that? Also, did you hear me say you're *always* an asshat? No. Yet that is what you then set out to disprove for reasons unknown.

You're not infallible and regularly cherry pick and skew facts to fit into your personal bias just as well. And I no doubt make myself guilty of that too. It's called being human.

Edit: you're obviously correct about the infinite divisibility. But this signifies how you can be extremely pedantic and unable to understand that some comments received more effort than others. Obviously I know it's not *literally* infinitely divisible, but for all intents and purposes it can be considered as such, at the very least for the time being. Divisibility was not the topic there either. Perhaps work on not taking everything so ultraliteral. Communication tends to imperfection by design.
I never said that you're an asshat to everybody. I'm just saying that you are one very often, and for no apparant reason other than people merely not agreeing blindly with your point of view. It always turns into a pointless semantics game of you desperately wanting to prove you're right and they're wrong. It's not constructive.
Yes, that is your perception. You seem to have a bit of trouble understanding that things aren't always as black and white, and that there are different perspectives, let alone attitudes, with which to approach something. There are very few things that can be approached as absolute truths, and overly doing so indicates immaturity, at least from my point of view.

It's funny that you had to actually look for civil responses and how you then proceed to make that small sample size representative :)
No, you don't. I mean, just look at https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5is0ax/what_happens_to_transaction_costs_if_ether_gets. You linked to that just now for crying out loud. It's always a constant struggle with your pedantic, no-compromise battle for *winning* every damn conversation.
Then you must save all the toxicity for r/ethereum :)

Edit: nice edit. A tip: beating your own drum in public doesn't exactly make you more likely to be taken seriously. It rings Dunning-Kruger alarm bells mostly.
Deep. r/iamverysmart
Obviously I am. I wouldn't want to imply that you're not completely right about something.
Heh. In a job interview you would be that typical candidate that makes a recruiter conclude: "Decent technical skill, but terribly unproductive personality. No hire."
I was wrong. Deep apologies for not showing blind adoration to your superior reasoning abilities. I will now retreat, feeling utterly disgraced by losing this conversation.

Really sorry for wasting your valuable time. If only I could turn back time.

...

Grow up.
Sigh. I gave you an open door to leave the conversation with at least some grace.

I'll end it the way you want by pretending I was dead wrong and you were superiorly right instead. And I will now crawl in fetal position while you proudly stroke your neckbeard, alright?

Grow up.
My pleasure.
Because it served your agenda in trying to prove me wrong in public you mean?

Anyway, we're actually both making a valid point that largely overlaps. I think our disagreement lies more in a difference of attitude towards it. Let's just agree to agree :)
I think it's best for you that we end this discussion here. Cool off for a while first.
> The gas prices *do not respond to movements in ETH's USD price at all.*  Not even in the slightest.

Why would they though? ETH has some of the lowest fees on the market compared to its utility. That's just how markets work. If there is no incentive, nothing happens.

> And yet you continue to believe that yours will magically become accurate.

There is nothing magical about the market making adjustments, in any shape or form, when confronted with the incentive. Do we have to think about a solution? Yes. Has Ethereum failed as a whole? No. Hurdles are there to overcome.

> [Way ahead of you](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6ehp60/recommendations_to_miners_to_change_gas_limit_and/diakddu/).

Cute that you're way ahead of me. I wouldn't expect anything else though. You're obviously closer involved after all. I'll have a read through it a bit later.
I personally don't care about either Tezos or Charles' borderline scams, for various reasons. But I won't be the concern troll here :)
Fair enough. I expanded and nuanced on the extrapolation part. Not sure why you omitted that.
> Your "market" *doesn't work*.

It's inefficient, sure. The trend of fees in ETH is down either way, but way too slow compared to the massive ETH price jump. I also never said that this would magically resolve itself. The future of Ethereum update hard forks is also part of that market. And perhaps you providing a reasonable solution is also a part?

> And I'm refusing to give you one because you're an asshat.  That's my prerogative.

This is how you engage with everyone that doesn't blindly agree with your doom and gloom narrative though.
If possible, could you perhaps edit your response by prefixing it with my deleted one? Thanks.
I think you haven't even read the discussion on Twitter. Charles is known by insiders as a two-faced snake. What do you think his real incentive is for posting here? It's classic concern trolling.
I'm going to ignore the high horse smugness. I guess that is just your style of communication that I have to filter for useful content first.

I would most definitely be wrong by the partial paragraph you quoted from me. I'm right when considering the whole paragraph though. And that doesn't even necessarily imply that you're wrong either. What is your obsession with 'winning' discussions?


> Exists in the design, but doesn't exist in practice.  Which means the design is flawed.

We haven't even come to a point where fees are considered too high, so you're making premature conclusions. As said once more: the market is not as efficient as it should be. I'm open to hear your constructive, realistic ideas on improving this without reducing overall economic incentive from the market.
Oops, just accidentally fat finger deleted my reply to this comment. I'm guessing there is no way to undo that?
Dude, stop revolving everything about proving the world that you're right about something. It's severely off-putting. Especially when I've already clarified the intention behind my words sufficiently. You're just making a spectacle of yourself by now.

That decoupling most certainly exists in Ethereum's fundamental design or the concept of gas would not make sense in the first place. Currently the market has not felt the need to decouple significantly because fees are still very low anyway. It's really that simple.
Delightful to see one scammer fighting the other.
Cringe.

Be very careful believing anything that comes out of u/ethereumcharles' mouth. He has a history of hidden agendas.
It's like you literally didn't read anything I said. You quote the first part of my comment, consciously omitting the next sentence in that same paragraph that points out that the market is not as efficient as it should be. And even after further clarifying that we're in agreement, you still keep bashing on :)
First off, could you get off your high horse? This is a discussion. Not a dick measuring contest. Thanks.

Fees are ultimately driven by the market. Since transaction fees are very low, even when having followed price to some extent (ETH paid per transaction has definitely gone down, but indeed not in proportion to the insane price rise), the market doesn't feel the need to decouple that relationship just yet. You wildly extrapolate the current coupling as mathematical truth, but I think you know full well that if ETH was priced at $40,000, it's very unlikely that we'll be paying $20 (very rough number) fee per transaction. It's a market, and people simply agree to pay the currently very low fees.

I'd love to hear your explanation as to why transactions rise despite months of price stagnation and severely lower exchange trade volume during that whole time though. I can't come up with one at any rate.
Adoption is outpacing the scaling roadmap for sure.
Got any concrete proof of that being the case? Not saying you're wrong, but I think it's either a chicken and egg problem or it's the rate of change of the price/transactions that is the big influencer (market being slow to adjust), not the absolute value.

> Transactions go up in response to price going up.

Go up, maybe, as more people are drawn into the market. But if price stops moving up, as seen in past months, one would expect transactions to not increase then. Yet they did, drastically.
I admitted afterwards that the decoupling is indeed not perfect. I really don't know what your problem is.
Price doesn't matter. Market cap does. And with Ripple's control over the XRP supply, that should also be taken with a pretty gigantic boulder of salt.
> [...] though I do agree that this decoupling could be handled a bit smoother than is currently the case).

Me agreeing with you the first time.

> [...] As I pointed out, the underlying market could be more efficient though.

Me agreeing the second time.

Yet you keep autistically screeching for proof.
How can you even tell? Price and number of transactions have been moving in tandem. See https://i.redd.it/dreefk5ggkzz.png.
This is not an opinion. It's a fact. Off-chain solutions are a necessary tradeoff.
Their involvement doesn't grant more credibility is my point. That's a weak appeal to authority. IOHK did fund some decent research, and I'm certainly not saying IOHK as a whole is a scam organization. I'm saying that too many dubious signs surround Charles Hoskinson. He has always struck me as particularly fake and two-faced, and these allegations really only confirm that suspicion further. Just read the allegations (not the article). This is not small stuff.
Oh, you can be sure that the average Joe will become very aware when the flippening recommences. Don't forget that ETH hit ~90% of BTC's market cap mere months ago.
I agree that it's a rather ambiguous, contradicting but also considerable set of facts. The amount of alarming signs around the person of Charles Hoskinson is pretty staggering. I'm inclined to believe that the truth lies at the very least somewhere in the middle.

You make an appeal to authority by claiming that university professors are involved. I think that is pretty irrelevant. Everybody has incentives. In fact it is a common scam technique to wave such credentials around to distract from the lack of meat in a product.
I disagree with regard to 2018. Crypto is led to a great extent by the chart, and the ETH/USD chart just broke through months of sideways consolidation, while the ETH/BTC chart is close to the bottom of all time support. It's all very easy to see on both (logarithmic) charts. I expect ETH to outperform BTC soon, regardless of BTC's direction at that time. See https://i.redd.it/7rixjfgvp3101.png for reference.
Charles Hoskinson is in actual fact most likely a criminal. And that is one of the reasons that he was removed from Ethereum early as well.

Just be careful. Public appearance can be very deceiving.
It's called a Ponzi scheme. Google it.
Please work on your reading comprehension. We actually **agree** in that old discussion. And I've pointed this out several times before.
RemindMe! 3 months
I think the correlation isn't so much with ETH price as it is with the massive growth in transactions though?
False. On average, ETH/BTC pair represents only 25% of ETH trading volume. Not only that, but **all** crypto pairs move in function of fiat, despite often indeed having high BTC pair volume for historical reasons (a lot of exchanges already offer as many ETH as BTC pairs these days).
Crypto isn't traded in function of BTC though. Just analyze the charts. ETH has decoupled from BTC for the most part.
Short term you are correct. Fundamentals tend to end up on top though.
How about simply responding to what I'm saying instead of deflecting to an ancient and closed discussion every time?
How about starting from a 'no vote = burn' principle instead? 'vote and burn' sounds like a good way to decrease the amount of voters.

Edit: A downvote but no answer? I must've said something incredibly stupid :).

Alternatively a 'vote = reward' might also be a good way to increase participation. Seems like an interesting discussion to me at least.
Those are two extremes. Your take would also remove a lot of economic incentive from the system. It's a precarious balance.
