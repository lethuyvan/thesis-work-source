The adapter is only $9, by the way, but still ridiculous. Apple also stopped including the extensions cables for the power bricks with newer MacBooks that cost more than previous models forcing people to buy the extension separately, and they definitely should have and very very easily could have included USB C to A adapter with them as well.
After 6 hours of **inactivity**, watching YouTube with auto play on or a really really long video counts as activity.
It would make sense considering most people get new phones every 2 years and if they got a 7 they already have the adapter or have switched over to other wireless solutions by now. However it’s not fair for Apple to not include an adapter that costs them cents to make with devices costing $700+.
Not if people vote with their wallets, the only reason they’re still in games is because people buy them.
Either both your units are defective, you’re room is 100 degrees, or your systems are getting no airflow because both systems were designed to be whisper quiet even under full load. My day One system has never had its fans ramp up and from experience with the One X through friends their’s stay dead quiet while player enhanced games.
I mean, the system is designed to be whisper quiet even when under full load unless ambient temps are very high or the system isn’t getting any ventilation.
Yes they'll include more ram in the next update. /s
It's impossible for battlefield to have skilled matchmaking considering it has a server browser where any level/skill player can join any match.
iOS Devices do get much much longer support. For example the 5S released in 2013 and is still getting the latest updates and features and might even get the big new iOS this year, yet you can't name a single Android device from 2013 that's still getting major updates that aren't just patching security flaws, probably not from 2014 either. Don't know what you mean by can't use some functions of apps though.
UI scaling and text size is likely the exact same on the PS4 and Xbox versions of the game, might be something up with your TV's settings.
Apple is a hardware and software company, they have absolutely no reason to buy a social media company.
Swappa is a more reliable ebay for various electronic devices, however since it's less popular you're less likely to sell there. I'd say post it there and if you don't get any bites after a few weeks, try ebay.
Maybe have an electrician check to make sure the wiring is outputting the proper voltage/amperage, if it's out of spec the building should take care of it.
It might not be physically possible because the dedicated encoder might grab the video/audio signal before things like game chat are layered in.
GroupMe is my preferred group chat app.
The 7 is still a great device I would say hold onto it until the new phones release later this year, then your upgrades will be in line with the new devices’ release in the future.
The iPhone 7 can’t fast charge though.
yeah no...
What if they’re discontinuing it to introduce something new? What if at wwdc they announce a mesh airport system with 3 Apple TV sized devices that support ac wave 2 features and each have a 3.5mm jack and/or optical port for airplay 2 multi room audio?
All games run better on the one, and H3 downsamples from 4K to 1080p if you’re only using a 1080p display so it will still look better.
But they have beats for that?
Restart iPhone and power cycle router.
[Finally!](https://i.imgur.com/eOUCiwk.jpg) 
Take a picture of the screen with your phone?
Was it used, what version of iOS are you on? Have you tried doing a hard restart?
The 8+ considering it's 5.5 in just like the phone she has.
Can't tell if troll or not but the J7 appears to be a 5.5 in. phone.
Same thing happened to the famous, now ex, Halo speed runner Nak3d Eli and he went back and forth with Microsoft for a while and nothing happened, so I doubt you'll be able to get your tag back if even he can't
No, only if your streaming music or something like that will an app continue to use data in the background, when suspended in the app switcher it's only using as much data/resources as if it were closed for checking for notifications and such.
Routers have gotten extremely user friendly, they all have very clean interfaces where you can change the network name, password, and manage connected devices.
If it’s a problem it’s because of the incompetence of your team, it’s huge and slow and a single aa or a couple of supports firing at it can take it down fairly quickly even with someone repairing.
Any case that doesn't have metal on the back and it's super thick will work. Most cases designed specifically for the 8 will likely mention if the will or won't work with wireless charging, if not stated check the reviews.
No, not at all
All speakers have magnets
Uhhh no. The difference between now and when keyboard and mouse are officially supported is that now kB/m players are mixed in with regular controller players, and they have a huge advantage. However, when official support comes devs will likely segregate km/m players to their own lobbies/servers to keep an even playing field.
The fact that they put bloom, loadouts, and armor abilities in reach when Halo had always been about even starts who won a gunfight was based on skill not randomness. I can’t tell if they just didn’t care as it was their last contracted game or they were forced by MS execs to “CoD-ify” the game to increase sales. It put the series on a downward spiral that Halo 5 is only barely digging itself out of.

It's not very common, but those player's are literal scum, they take pride in having a an extremely unfair advantage over regular controller users.
I can just imagine the intel jingle in the style of the classic Halo music.
You can't downgrade, but one thing I recommend that's helped a lot of friends/family with older devices being 'crippled' by iOS 11 is doing and backup and restore via a computer. Doing so completely wipes and rewrites iOS getting rid of garbage files, caches, and potentially corrupted files that accumulate over years of updating. It gave their devices a decent speed boost and most the bugs they were experiencing vanished.
Same issues since launch.
Despite consoles becoming more powerful, they're still meant to be plug and play. That's why the games with settings only have 2 or 3 modes to choose from so the vast majority of users aren't overwhelmed/confused. If you want to tinker with a bunch of settings, try playing on PC.
Maybe if you had a huge music library, like people who used to fill their 160gb iPods, and you take pictures of literally everything and have hours upon hours of 4K 60fps footage.
This just in, Toyota will stop making the 2018 Camry when the 2019 comes out. How dumb do these cites think consumers are?
There’s a gradient effect as you scroll
My airplay experience degraded year after year of owning my 3rd gen. About 6 months ago I remember that there was a USB port on the back used for restoring the device, so I plugged it into my computer and did a firmware restore and now the thing works like the day I got it and airplay is flawless.
Yes they work
iOS 12 will be the first version properly optimized for the X's form factor, so I'd imagine it would be better. Also the a11 is beyond stupidly fast so it won't be slowing down any time soon.
Considering it's faster than the macbook and you get insane battery, yes.
Not unless they're 'abused', and every phone since the 7 has a force touch home button with no moving parts so they should last much longer.
Battery life is already amazing and there is no new bluetooth LE standard, that's why even the new apple watch doesn't use bluetooth 5.
They likely won't be updating the apple pencil for a long time, it's a very basic thing with really nothing to improve upon, and if a new version comes along, it will most certainly work with older devices.
Also the final rendered video is horrendously compressed further than the already compressed game DVR footage, and there has been a bug for like 3 years where it messes up the frame pacing and makes the video look stuttery.
It's getting updated to fix a lot of the bugs, improve the UI/UX, and add Xbox One X enhancements.
I'm sure they're aware of this and the updates are still in internal testing, public testing won't start for a while it seems, much can still change by then.
Probably because it's too powerful of a weapon to make the universe interesting, they would just mass produce them then have a kill everything weapon. Why doesn't the UNSC have super nukes that can destroy entire planets if Halo takes place 500 years from now when we already have a large enough nuclear arsenal to completely level earth?
Because VR is still a very ‘beta’ product, MS wants to wait until the hardware and software is fleshed out until they implement support for it, but honestly VR seemed like a huge hype trend last year and is already dying out.
I would wait until WWDC where apple may have something new at the low end.
Yes
After years of updating certain caches and garbage files get left behind and never get deleted or cause corruptions which slow down your system over time, completely wiping the drive and reinstalling macOS gives you a clean slate and the system should feel snappier.
Likely just processor and gpu upgrades but no radical redesign. Depending on what you use your imac for, the upgrades could be negligible.
What model specifically? Either way, I would start by backing up any important files to an external drive/cloud service. Boot into recovery mode, completely wipe the main drive using disk utility, then reinstall macOS from there.
You risk breaking both systems and if the S was bought new, there goes yours warranty. Just get an external drive if you need more space.
The answer is not enough, exactly why one doesn't exist.
Possible, yes, recommended, hell no.
It's not a rerelease, it's the actual original code running, that's the magic of backward compatibility.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UITze7alGZg
Confirmed
Higher res textures have minimal impact as long as you have enough ram, and considering the 360 had half a gig and the Xbox One has something like 5gb dedicated to games, it's laughable that 343i somehow made worse textures.
Both games run a dynamic res system and I'm pretty sure Halo 5 can dip below 720p, but BF1 varies between 900p and full 1080p.
The bare minimum time for a price drop would be in the fall.
The biggest difference is that they removed the rotation lock/mute switch which shifted the volume buttons so they wouldn’t line up.
The mini 4 has different dimensions then the 1/2/3.
That’s the total size of the app, not the size of the update.
We don’t know yet
Report those posts so they can get removed as they should. Keeping fake news with a tag is pointless.
That’s the only reason anyone would be getting frequent small updates, the last public update [came out in February](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/system-update-operating-system), no reason anyone outside of the insider program would have gotten any update since then.
YOU’RE IN THE PREVIEW PROGRAM, YOU SIGNED UP FOR THIS.

If you don’t want constant updates, unenroll your system, then you’ll only get the ~monthly big updates like everyone else.
They will definitely release a new model this year, there's a pretty obvious pattern that new watches will come out with new phones every year.
Yes there are times where the framerate is on the verge of unplayable, but I was still able to finish the campaign no problem.
It could be 1 of 2 things or a little bit of both. 1) load balancing server side, you’re not the only one downloading a game from that specific server so bandwidth is limited for each outgoing download because bandwidth ain’t cheap and they can’t be dedicating all outgoing traffic a single user, and 2) load balancing (often called quality of service) on your local network, your router is limiting the download speed so that there’s enough bandwidth for all the other device connected to your internet to use and not have to suffer with dial-up speeds.
K. I’ll have Phil get right on that. /s
Latency would make pretty much any game unplayable and the compression/image quality would make things even worse. That's also pushing a lot of bandwidth through your home network which would slow down your internet speed and cause terrible latency on any other connected devices as well, unless you have enterprise grade networking equipment.
Well yeah it's a full on PC/console game ported to mobile, of course it's not going to run perfectly, also it was pretty much 'just' released, so give the devs time to update and optimize it.
I use a logitech mx anywhere 2s and it's amazing, a bit pricey though
No
How fast is your internet on the detailed network statistics? Are you wired in or using wifi? Have you tried doing a factory reset?
Likely won’t work.
I can’t think of a single game that’s support 3D since like 2011, but don’t most 3D TVs have a 3D ‘interpolation’ mode or whatever that can turn any 2D content into 3D, but it’s obviously not perfect.
Ok I'll get right on it. /s
Focusing on quality over quantity, they internally design and prototype dozens of different products, but only the ones they think are the absolute best get released.
The idea is that you're getting more accurate colors, relative to color temperature to the room you're in, which causes less strain on your eyes because they don't have to adjust to different color temperatures. This doesn't translate to actual color accuracy, which you're sacrificing.
considering it's only ~$45 a year on average if you know where to get good deals, it's a great value
Where are Korg and Miek?!
SSDs are still not very cheap. A 1tb HDD is <$40, a 1tb SSD is >$200.
I’m not an extreme power user so I don’t need the extra screen real estate, ram or battery life, I don’t take many pictures so the dual camera isn’t worth it to me, and I like being able to use my phone one handed.
Both scores are still ludicrously fast, stop worrying.
My regular 8 is still just as fast if not faster due to iOS 11.3 improvements, battery is still just as good as well.
7S?
The Division?
Your circle never disappears, it's always keeping a total of how many years you have gold in total, not consecutively. You can cancel anytime before your 3 months is up and you'll still have the gold until the day it was originally set to expire, you can add a code to extend it before it runs up as well.
You need Apple's official lightning to USB C cable and the 29w USB C adapter. I wouldn't trust any random junk off of ebay as pretty much any time a battery fails, or worse, catches-fire/explodes in an Apple device, it's because of a cheap, uncertified charger or cable.
It should last forever, definitely until then.
Because the latency is horrendous making most games unplayable so why bother building in the functionality? Either way, it’s really easy to do stream over the internet. If you port forward all Xbox Live ports or put your system in a dmz, you can use your public IP address and you should be able to stream from your system form anyway that doesn’t have a super strict firewall.
If you feel like your Air 2 is slow and want to use the Apple Pencil, then it’s worth it. If you don’t feel you Air 2 is slow I’d say only the pro is worth the upgrade.
No, and the way the one s is defiantly set as you home system or else no other account would be able to access you live/games. If this situation you need 2 of everything minimum.
Reinstall app?
I’m saying that there are non-nvme pcie spec SSDs, I’m mistaken in that the drive a recommended is sata spec
Non-nvme 3D nand can surpass sata 3 speeds, m.2 allows them to work at their full potential, and again its lower latency because it’s running off of pcie lanes rather than sata.
Thank you for reminding us that common sense is a thing.
Why not 500 if it's in your budget? You might regret it later.
Yeah, NVMe is a little out of his price range, but an m.2 ssd, even non-nvme, is better than a sata drive because of faster bus speeds and lower latency.
They're much faster and and have lower latency, sadly NVMe is a little out of your budget which are extremely fast, here's a good regular m.2 ssd I would recommend though: https://pcpartpicker.com/product/6j448d/western-digital-blue-500gb-m2-2280-solid-state-drive-wds500g2b0b
This isn’t even remotely funny...
check, or subscribe to, slick deals every now and then, there's usually somewhere that had a good bundle for ~$175, not at the moment though.
Don't think such a thing exists, yet. There are 24 in. 4k non-HDR monitors though.
You should just quit gaming then, it's obvious that you no longer focus on the fun you're having in games and rather focus on how much money you're spending.
You make it sound like everyone has this issue but it's definitely isolated to you and only a small small minority. Just factory reset your console (keep games and apps option obviously).
We want it, Microsoft wants it, Activision doesn't because they want your wallet, so you have to wait to buy their remaster with supply drops and what not.
It’s defiantly not easy because they have to make changes to their emulation, then play test the entire game or at least a majority of it to make sure their changes don’t cause any serious bugs or crashes at any point in the game.
How would that be easier? It’s a lot of work for the BC team so that means more time per game and less games, I’d rather them release a batch, then the most popular ones get X enhanced later.
no
First of all you misused the deals tag, second of all, do you mean for an internal or external drive?
They sped up animations and people are reporting better battery life so you should have a better experience if you update.
It's still relatively new so likely no 'good' deals for a while, costco sometimes has it $50 off and that's about all i've seen.
Reach just had the best looking weapons, 'complicating' the original designs with just enough detail to where they look so much more gritty and realistic. The reach [BR concept](https://i.imgur.com/CZ8ip0t.jpg) would have easily been the best looking in any game if it was in the final release.
Nothing we or microsoft can do about it, it's something google changed with their app, you have to contact them about it.
Budget? What will it be used for?
You'd just need a simple PCIe to M.2 adapter.
no worries, I actually really like the idea.
It's a pcie retention clip, it goes on the edge of the slot like [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IrS6ah84hQU/maxresdefault.jpg).
Read my edit.
The game will likely enter, and stay in for a long time, game pass once the big patch release, and maybe be GwG down the road, but I can't imagine it ever being F2P.
Yes
yep, go to settings > network > go offline.
Although you said you wanted something not extremely small, the fractal design node 202 is just that and can easily be put in a backpack/bag.
If they were HDDs yes, but with SSD's performance impact is negligible.
Please follow proper post format
Yes, on lower setting though because it only has integrated graphics.
Make the console your home system and put it in offline after disconnecting it from the internet.
Yeah it would be possible for maybe 2x1080p displays, but having 1x4k display is much much more marketable, also with massive 4k screens becoming the norm, split screen is practically like getting your own medium sized 1080p display alread.
It takes *a ton* of extra processing power to do such a thing, the only console to ever attempt it was the PS3 and they scrapped it just before launch because they knew that there wasn't enough power to have a half-decent looking game and be driving that game on 2 displays rendering different scenes.
Why not post this in the far cry sub? It's a cool idea but nothing can be done about it by anyone here.
Go to any google page > click you account icon in the top right > click 'my account' > under the sign in and security column click 'apps with account access' > click 'manage apps' > then from there you can select and remove each service you want to revoke account access from.
I know, I was asking for future reference.
It’s not that, it’s because they have a monopoly in an market people just don’t want to bother with, for example Casio makes calculators that compete with all of TI’s at half the price, however teachers and textbooks have been using TI’s for like 2 decades now so no one wants to relearn all the functions and such for a different brand calculator. However if someone like Apple put all those functions in an elegant interface that translates well from the familiar TI’s, they could dominate the market.
follow proper post format please.
The use of the word 'air': using the word 'air' meant small/light/just-the-essentials when the Macbooks 'air' was the only product with that tag, but for the iPad 'air' it was the flagship ipad with the best specs and screen, etc. And now we have just the 'macbook', which is smaller, lighter, and has weaker specs than the macbook 'air'.
yep
Have you thought that maybe it's the conditions you subject the phone to? Either way, take it to apple, they'll likely replace it for free if there isn't serious physical damage as this is a serious safety concern.
/r/buildapcforme
Those specs should be able to play overwatch on ultra. My guess is that it's a windows/drive related issue, and also since the PC is 'used' I suggest doing a clean install of windows, also update the bios as well just to be sure.
The drives in the original one had a high failure rate for early run units, the drive has been updated and I haven't seen anyone report a drive on their One S/X failing.
With the new classkit stuff teachers could lock students to the calc app only during tests.


With the new classkit stuff teachers could lock students to the calc app only during tests.
Yeah I'd say that's a good deal.
There are promotions for non-subscribers every now and then, such as 1 month for $1 or a year for $40. For the spring sale they have [3 months for $10](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/live/gold).
You have to pay like everyone else.
Honestly, Apple could completely bankrupt texas instruments if they gave the iPad a calculator app with ti-84/89 features. Considering many schools provide ipads to all students, this would save them a ton of money if they provide calculators ($100-$150 a piece) as well.

EDIT: 2 things: I know TI makes more than just calculators, saying they would be *completely bankrupt* was an exaggeration, and I would never expect an app to completely 100% replace actual calculators in every scenario, i.e. of course *real* calculators would still be used during standardized tests and such.
it's just a placebo, there is no 'priority downloading'.
That's not how any of this works
Why would you post this? No one here appreciates you taking advantage of keyboard/mouse when we're all still using controller. Just play on PC dude.
Refresh rate hasn't changed but your series 0 likely just chugs along when playing the animation whereas the series 3 can handle it at full refresh rate.
That’s completely backwards
I specifically chose that mobo because it was the cheapest that had built in wifi because op needs/wants it based on his original build.
What kind of storage and what kind of ram?
You'd likely need a graphics card as most onboard gpus only support up to 2 displays, but it doesn't have to be expensive or fancy, just have enough outputs of the type that you need. 
No you cannot 'build' a laptop, so there's no subs for that.
Ok well there were a lot of things I found wrong your build. Here are my suggested changes, assuming it's for gaming. Intel's cpus are still superior for gaming so I switched you over to the intel platform and added a mobo with built in wifi so you don't need an expansion card for it, no cooler or thermal paste required (even if you needed a cooler it would come with paste) as the cpu comes with one, you didn't have ram which you need so I threw that in there, you didn't have any storage, which again you need, so I threw that in there, swapped out the psu for something of better value and you didn't need that extra fan.

flux from the when they were soldiered on?
Can you post pictures with a view of the entire inside of the case so we can confirm that everything is connected properly. Also your psu might have an on off switch on the back, or you might have it plugged into a switch outlet.
This is what I suggest, getting a new cpu, mobo, and ram now then getting a new gpu later as prices are severely inflated at the moment and there will be better new options later this year. Here's an example of what you can get now for your budget that would still give you noticeably better performance in the games you currently play with your current gpu.

Many people are reporting better battery life with 11.3
This means that your battery is severely degraded, the only fix is to get a new battery. Only the 6 and up have the throttling 'feature' to prevent unexpected shutdowns.
They boosted the animation speeds for all devices. My 8 fells noticeably faster.
Or a 38mm band
Yes but the connector rail would protrude and it would look silly.
no but there's an app that lets you turn gifs into live photos so they can be used for 'animated' backgrounds
You need to have each other as contacts and the ‘sending’ phone has to be unlocked, it’s surprisingly a feature that has worked every time for me.
maybe because you didn't bother looking for anything before posting...
Just pulling the plug and plugging back in isn’t the same as a proper hard restart. To do a proper restart go to the guide, settings tab, then choose restart. If the proper way doesn’t work I would try a factory reset (you can choose the “keeps games and apps” option so you don’t have to redownload any games). If that doesn’t work, try reinstalling the game.
Hard restart your system
Means your hard drive is corrupt or something.
You know Microsoft has marketing rights for the BF series right? All the trailers for BF1 had big Xbox logos at the beginning and end, iirc. Also for BF4, don’t think they did this with BFH or BF1, DLC was released early for Xbox.
A large majority of those votes were cast prior to the remaster being announced/released.
There is no proper 'verified' system or badge lik one twitter or youtube, people just add verified then an emoji to the end of their tag to seem 'official'.
No one was really asking for cod 4 as we sorta got it already with the remaster all people want is MW2 whether it be BC or a proper remaster as, IMO, it was the peak of series in terms of popularity and gameplay.
Yes 4 player split screen multiplayer is supported.
Wasn’t this possible on 360 though, or am I mis remembering?
Doing so would also result in people finding backdoors to side load pirated games so that’s a solid no.
There is no way.
open message, open preference from the menu bar, go to the accounts tab, sign out.
Update may have been corrupted, you can try an offline update.
Name one way in which any single moment of Halo 5 has more depth than any moment of a Bungie game? You can make this argument for Halo 4, but Halo 5 cannot be redeemed in any way.
Think there's a law preventing such a thing. For example you leave your phone on a plane and 'all devices need to be powered off' so if they can't turn your phone off it's a 'safety hazard' to everyone on the plane.
The lack of weapons and weapon customization at launch turned off a lot of people. Although this didn’t stop me from playing, I do occasionally go back to BF4 just to run some obscure weapons with crazy attachment combos just for a bit of fun.
I’d say maybe the S will to $200 at e3 then the X likely won’t get a price cut until the holiday season.
The only way to make a bootable installer is on a mac, so you would have had to do it on your system before replacing the drive.
Shoulda just made a bootable USB flash drive for installation.
Steve Jobs once said "A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them." This is the reason for Apple products being so simple and lacking customization over the years. If users are given too much freedom to customize they're overwhelmed and just won't customize anyway so why bother implementing it if a majority of users won't take advantage of it.
My first mac is a 2013 Macbook Air that I still have and use occasionally to test out beta version of macOS and such and it still runs just as good as the day I bought it and the battery life is still amazing.
Like no
They just license the name/assets, they didn't do any development work for the mobile version.
You do realize that this is only an insider/alpha update causing the black screen issue right? It's already been fixed and the new wave up insider updates going out don't have the issue and fixes affected systems.
Disc for what? Any drivers you need are automatically installed by windows updates, but if by chance one isn't automatically downloaded, you can find it on the support page for you motherboard.
Only few exist, this is the cheapest one: https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/7HYWGX/asrock-z370m-itxac-mini-itx-lga1151-motherboard-z370m-itxac
That board doesn't have an m.2 slot so you'd want the sata drive.
Is thing including peripherals (keyboard, mouse, monitor, etc.) or just the tower and components?
SLI and Crossfire are rarely supported, and when they are, they're rarely supporter properly, single powerful GPU has been the way to go for a while now.
Top end of the budget but pretty much the best you can get:

It could play games at 1440p 144hz if you wanted, it's pretty overkill, don't know why you'd go with outdated storage when spending so much through.
Slightly above budget how: much better CPU for gaming and cheaper mobo and ram to support it, cheaper GPU for same performance, much less but much much faster SSD storage (buy a secondary drive if you need more space in the future), bigger monitor with better image quality, and higher quality psu:

You can pretty much go all out with that budget: 8700k, high-end z370 board, 16 or even 32gbs of ddr4-2666+ ram, any case/cooler/psu you want.
When ryzen launched it was extremely competitive with intel's 7th gen, but intel's 8th gen CPUs beat ryzen in price:performance at the low end.
Sometimes you have to remove it for a while to clear any caps of remaining power, also check your mobo's manual, there may be jumpers you can bridge to reset the cmos/bios.
Yep you should be good, CPU's don't have drivers, fyi.
Intel CPUs are still supreme for almost every task. High-end ryzens are good for workstation type tasks, but the APU you originally selected is a low-end model with a gpu weaker than the 550 attached to it. For not an outrageous amount more you could get a much more powerful PC so if you do want to play more intense games in the in the future, it's an option, just my 2 cents.
Yeah that's pretty much all you'll need.
Just do a clean install of windows. There's an option in settings called reset my pc or something and it does a clean install for you. Once done resetting make sure it has all the latest windows updates as windows grabs any necessary drivers for you, then you should be good to go. Backup and important data before doing this.
If you're running windows 10, pretty much every essential driver is automatically downloaded and installed via windows update.
clear cmos?
Above budget, but you get a much better CPU and GPU combo, and more and faster SSD storage (i suggest buying a secondary drive down the line if/when you'll need one).

This monitor is at the top of your budget but is 75hz which is a nice bonus feature: https://pcpartpicker.com/product/Dnbkcf/lg-24mp59g-p-238-1920x1080-75hz-monitor-24mp59g-p
The i7 is overkill.
Although the ryzen processors are great, their value:performance is only worth it for 'workstation' task, for gaming and everyday tasks intel is still the better value.
i5 will be plenty power for games at $100 cheaper, faster m.2 SSD, I say don't get the 2tb drive yet, save the money now and get that later, better ram

Only z370 motherboards are compatible at the moment.
Defraging helps after using a drive a for a while when data gets... well, fragmented. So doing so right after formating wouldn't do much at all. Still I would set windows to do a weekly defrag.
Rule 10
It would just piss off your entire team considering you wasted a tank spawn for an armored car that can be easily destroyed.
It's not supposed to replace a ture dark mode, Apple has never expressed or officially stated such.
Exactly, it’s always the loud minority of people with issues telling everyone and posting that they shouldn’t update. 
I don’t think any iPads would be affected considering that they have massive batteries so it would take a long long time for them to degrade enough to justify throttling. Also throttling was partly necessary due to the design of batteries used in the 6 and 6S specifically so those are the only device we know are affected.
There's in open in settings to get fullscreen I believe it's under video output settings.
Didn't even know this was a thing. I guess it's nice when you get a notification in a situation where it should be silenced and you can quickly silence it without messing around.
swipe up to get to control center on the watch, toggle 'silent mode' (bell icon).
They're also the only company that gives a shit about anyone's privacy and data and keeps their mobile devices updated for 4-5 years compared to the average year or so for an android device.
They've always been blue until the didact shows up and takes command of them.
Rule 8
People don't want to follow orders, they just want to play the game how they want to, the only way to get *proper* teamplay is to play with a dedicated group or friends.
Should be possible.
I'm just saying that it having over a billion downloads means nothing when it's installed by default, so why did you mention it?
Maybe because it’s installed by default on all devices as part of the gapps package?
If you need a third party device, I wouldn’t call that cross compatibility, it’s just that someone found a workaround. These adapters aren’t certified or licensed by MS, Sony, or Nintendo.
Or you can just get a splitter
They're slightly thicker making falling out less of an issue, I never found the normal earpods to be uncomfortable so that doesn't change at all with airpods.
Because 343i's design team watches too much transformers.
Look, stop trying to ask us to justify if you *deserve* a refund or not, just contact MS support and see what they say, we don’t have any influence or power over their decision on the matter.
If you say you've used it 20-30 hours a week (much more than average, IMO) and we don't know how *intense* that use was, yeah it's likely a totally acceptable amount of wear.
After 2 years of use with no proof of purchase, not a chance.
You shouldn't have to, not everyone has to like every game.
> *buys year+ old device.* Has innovation stalled?!

If you wanted something *innovative* you would have gotten an X, what did you expect with the 7?
Uhhh, no it's an [advertised feature](https://i.imgur.com/sL8RFZj.png). You can also change this to other functions.
Did you try backup and restore? Try doing it through a computer as it completely wipes and rewrite iOS to the device so it'll fix any corruption that may be causing the issue. If that doesn't work bring it to apple, they might fix/replace it for free if there's no physical damage that could have caused it to stop working.
The max output is 60hz, you monitor detects that automatically and only runs at 60hz.
Just install them all, considering they're free everyone still playing should have them.
Forbes has been awful at writing about any topic for years now, can’t believe people still read them as a reliable ‘source’.
Battlefield 1 or 4
A ton of people still have an artificial hate for Xbox/MS after the initial Xbox One announcement, despite the entire Xbox devision being completely reworked since then. Right now, Xbox is easily the most consumer friendly console you can get, yet people still think there’s some ulterior motive that Xbox has because it’s owned by big-business Microsoft, when there’s no evidence of anything like that.
Maybe they'll announce that it's available right now at the event on the 27th?
Also Samsung Dex. However, Apple keeps their producers distinct, iOS devices are strictly mobile devices, Macs are strictly computers, they don’t like to blur the lines between them.
They’re likely releasing new watches with new iPhones after we’ve seen this trend for the past 2 years. So that would be September.
Any 1440p or 4k monitor will look ‘retina’ at that size.
There is no way, it just does it automatically.
X now, get the next gen Apple Watch after you have time to save up for it.
No
Tom French said it’s very possible in the next game after it being requested so much for halo 5.
No
That's all up to you, we don't know exactly what you like/want
That's not exactly 'native', streaming uses a lot of bandwidth, and the video quality is much worse compared to the native game dvr. 
If you can show that watchOS is acting up they'd do it no problem.
How so?
Nope, you could do it since the [first version of iOS 10](http://www.iphonehacks.com/2016/09/how-to-control-flashlight-brightness-ios-10.html).
No they cannot force you, it's just Apps will eventually require you to be on a new version to download/update.
Apple can do it and there is a sketchy cable you can buy to do it yourself. It does a full restore however so you'd have to set it up like new or from a backup.
Been there since iOS 10, iirc.
Nothing has been said so I'm guessing no, could be added in an update late on though.
Not natively on the system, you'd need an external recording set up.
Monitors are great because they have the lowest latency you can get and much truer colors and contrast as many modern TVs have filters and post processing that you cannot turn off at all. However if you want HDR support you can really only get that TVs at this time, at least for a reasonable price that is.
Because you can’t just cancel an update. Updates aren’t strictly adding new file, they change and replace a lot of existing files, so canceling midway leaves the game completely corrupted so the whole thing must be redownloaded.
The S maxes out at 1080p, 1440p support is just for proper scaling.
I had that same issue, but it equalized eventually.
It's in the CTE, it will be released eventually to download for all existing owners of BF1. IMO, it's too little too late, they're following a dying trend, ultra-competitive round based game modes that is, whereas all anyone cares about these days is a Battle Royal mode, and I can't blame them because that sounds and looks 100x more fun than incursions.
My guess is that this will be a focus on cheaper hardware updated with new features, so: SE 2 with iPhone 8/X specs, new cheap iPad (and/or Mini) with Apple Pencil support, True Tone, etc. new Macbook Air with updated specs, retina screen, and usb-c, and maybe a new Mac Mini as it is the cheapest mac after all.
He's said in the past very blatantly that he would be very happy to return to the series but neither Microsoft of 343i individually have contacted him about it despite him being available and independant. My guess is that this is just MS execs being greedy as they don't want to pay for his talent.
You can buy stuff with the Apple Store app and just walk out with it.
Probably a long time, it's the least they can do considering we didn't get H3A.
There's [Apple's official trade in](https://www.apple.com/watch/trade-up/), [swappa](https://swappa.com/buy/apple/watch), and I would resort to ebay/craigslist last.
Thanks for doing a giveaway!
That's why they began to specify these games as "Console Exclusive" meaning it's only on that console, but maybe PC and even mobile as well.
The 4 has lost support for about 4 years now. If they want a cheap device that runs the latest iOS, the SE is the way to go.
iPhone 4 stopped at 7, the 4S stopped at 9.
Only [the official adapter](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/adapters/wireless-adapter-windows) supports audio/mic 
Nope
Go to settings > display > video out > advanced > connection > select HDMI (your screen should flash then get blurry) > then go back > and you should now be able to force 1080p for the resolution.
Apple stopped signing iOS 10 a long time ago, there was a mistake recently where they were accidentally signing a bunch of old versions but that will likely not happen again.
If you love them then get the replacement and be more careful.
That's all up to you, if you like your airpods, get the replacement piece, if you don't, then don't.
> I was wondering the long term health risks as well that come with FaceID if there is any?

lol wut?
You cannot downgrade iOS. I don't think there's a big enough market for devices with older versions of iOS to justify not updating it to preserve value. Also unlike older devices the 7 runs iOS 11 just fine so you're not going to have a worse experience, you'll only get the new features.
All that work for a silly joke and all I get is a downvote? Come on man, what are you doing with your life?
[sticks](https://i.imgur.com/5Eq59Yy.png)
[Yes](https://i.imgur.com/5Eq59Yy.png)
There's rumors of a new version of the elite controller coming this year, I would wait.
It doesn't block the vent. Why would microsoft design an accessory that would 'harm' the system?
Yes you can, you get those controls in the guide.
Literally will work, your USB port isn’t going to break, also there are no charging on cables, all cables work for charging and data.
Have you 100% ruled out that it’s not your internet and not the games/EA’s servers fault? My ping is always fine.
Go to settings and force 1080p output.
Any will do
Because that looks horrendous.
no
Apple does not announce new phones at WWDC, at least not for a long long time. iPhones have consistently been announced and released in, or shortly after, September. The only new hardware we can expect from WWDC Mac and iPad refreshes, and even those are guaranteed.
Except maps would have to be designed around 50v50 making them terrible for any less number of players.
For parity in multiplayer with people still playing on the regular One/S and 360. Also the animations and such would look choppy and wrong because they only run at 30 FPS.
If you using wifi switch to wired, much more reliable. Also try power cycling your console, modem, and router. Check if you router has any firmware updates as well.
Exactly the same here. I have everything I'd ever need, all my music downloaded, all the pictures I want saved, all my emails and texts on device as well. What do people need 256gbs for?!
My main point is that I'd rather have all this stuff in one place rather than having to shuffle between an ipad, loaned laptop, and desktop.
Yes, that's a very very marginal difference for the security of knowing the product will work. And if it is a defective unit it will be 100x easier to get a replacement/refund if you buy new compared to used.
Yes they have a handful of laptops to rent out, however I'd much rather run the stuff on my own machine and be able to save all my projects and such.
The classes have lab sections where you need a computer to run the software in the class on your own machine especially for quizzes and tests that require you to make certain models/write certain scripts properly. At least that's how it was when I took them.
There's still a ton of people playing, are you sure you don't have your preferences for search set wrong?
It is, just google ios 9 stock wallpaper and you'll get hundreds of results.
why not start the update and see how much?
Yes
If you have a recent backup you can restore from that.
Public testing starts at the end of this month, release probably won't be for a couple months after that.
If you're coming from the original xbox one, that had a capacitive button that required no pressure, the S and X have a physical button that you have to push that makes a click sound.

Bring it to Apple
Have you tried the offline update fix?
6s was the first to have it
iOS 12 is supposed to be a ‘tune up’ update focused on fixing bugs, increasing performance, and increasing battery life, so hopefully all will be fixed, iMessage crashes more than ever for me in iOS 11.
Streaming and game dvr is handled by a dedicated h.264 (likely h.265/hevc in the One X) encoder that doesn’t use any cpu resources and always has ram dedicated it even when not in use. When no streaming or game dvr is disabled that ram doesn’t get used at all it’s still dedicated to storing footage but none is being stored. So there will be no performance increase.
Here’s the [most played list](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/most-played/games/xbox), based on real-time data for your region.
Settings > general > language and region?
You can use the PlayTo feature: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3078096/stream-music-and-video-content-to-your-xbox-console-using-playto
Bandwidth will be limited while in sleep mode. I've noticed the absolute fastest way to download stuff is to restart the console (so that all games and apps are cleared from ram), then staying on the queue page of my games and apps will give you the fastest download speeds.
He either needs to be signed into your account to play them or if you make the system your home system any other account on that system can access all your digitally owned content.
Yes
Except google is making a large shift from these cheap affordable products/services that just get the job done to device that compete on the high end. Look at the Nexus program, we went from phones with flagship specs for 2/3 or even 1/2 the price of competitors with really no standout features. Now in its place, we have the Pixel line which is at the same price as competitors with amazing cameras and great design. Same deal with the Pixel C and Chromebook Pixel and even Chromecast Ultra to an extent.
All of ODST happens between mission 3 of H2, IIRC, and before Halo 3. I would just play it after 2 to keep it simple.
Both the One S and One X support 4k blu rays and 4k HDR blu rays.
They switched alloys for the iPhone from the 6S onward because of bendgate.
I would hold out for the new phones this year.
Sadly that's just how a lot of games are, and 343i can't help themselves but copy and replicate what every other popular game has been doing, over-rewarding the player for even the simplest of tasks to make themselves feel good about nothing and keep playing. It's the same reason why you get like 20 medals for killing someone in even the simplest of ways in multiplayer as well.
The game will very very likely have controller support
It's all publishers here, they have to allow their games to become BC and most choose not to probably to keep sales of current games going, also there could be copyright issues with music and such not allowing the game to become BC without being updated and the publisher doesn't want to devote resources to updating old games like this. Microsoft wants every game to be BC, but publishers are the only one holding that vision back.
There is no bluetooth or wireless headset support natively however, they added party chat to the Xbox app for mobile so you can pair a wireless headset to you phone and use it for party chat like that.
That’s not how any of this works
Have you tried restoring through a computer/iTunes? Doing so completely wipes iOS off the device and rewrites it so any corruptions or garbage files that are causing issues would be corrected or deleted.
Maybe that’s an issue with your save or your game download was corrupt, no game should be crashing.
Rule 7
The frame rate was so-so on 360, then the original BC release was absolutely unplayable, then there was an update that fixed it and it runs better than 360 now.
I hope that they just added new tracks that fit the original soundtracks style and variety.
Some apps just don't have a horizontal mode, reddit is one of them.
Camera cut out won't line up.
Yes, but due to hardware and networking constraints, it's not done. Also you'd have to design the maps around that many players which would make them unplayable for any less players. I remember back in BF3 there were hacked PC servers (because 3rd parties could host) that could support 100+ players.
Simple google search would have solved this.
Phil Spencer has said he's actively against exclusivity deals like this.
Distinguishing* haha
It’s because there are no truly terrible phones anymore, reviews focus on distinguishing features rather than pros and cons because those don’t really matter anymore.
It definitely is, but 7 years later you think Apple would add this basic functionality. I understand it may be out of respect for Jobs, but at this point it’s just silly.
Why don’t we have a calculator and weather on iPad? Just Apple things.
Metro because it historically fits in, and, although all the hate, who doesn’t love a round on metro?
Ones that are above 24fps are usually 48fps as well, not even 60.
You either got 2 faulty systems or you have them in a spot with terrible ventilation. All Xbox One systems should be whisper quiet unless they think they’re going to overheat then they blast the fans.
Yes it should be able to pair with your phone and you can use the party chat functionality of the Xbox app.
Is this a question or a statement?
It’s amazing how powerful it is yet so quiet. I’m so annoyed when I hear an older iPhone or android vibrate and it’s louder than the text/ring-tone after being spoiled by the haptic engine.
Pretty sure mobile is still the largest and largest growing gaming market still. But angry birds is a relic of the past, it’s formula can only be milked for so long.
I just realized that he only had his ‘classic’ armor for 2 games as well. I’d like something between the classic and current armor like mark vi we can use in 4 and 5’s multiplayer.
They do this to conserve their bandwidth.
It’s just the way the BF series has always been, no senses in changing things just because. Also considering the size of BF maps it would just piss everyone off.
I feel like once the MCC gets fixed they’ll either make it games with gold and/or add it to game pass to build hype for the series as Halo 6 will be coming eventually.
Yes
Have you tried the offline update method first?
It’s still in alpha they’re definitely going to tune it.
Likely E3 at the latest, possibly before that.
Apple uses a different pin configuration so the mic portion doesn’t work.
Usually just dirt/dust clean it with rubbing alcohol and clean the lightning port on your phone with a toothpick for any loose dirt or dust.
Yes but you have to pay full price.
Yes
No
> Its funny how the paid version of fortnite is much ~~less optimized~~ **more demanding** than the free version.

FTFY, there are many games where the campaigns look much better and thus run worse, whereas the multiplayer has toned down visuals to meet a frame rate target, fortnite is no exception. Have you seen save the world being played, there's a ton more effects and stuff going on at times.

Clear local 360 storage in settings, should wipe your profile for the 360 emulator and you can sign in again and it should sync your new tag properly.
1. You can have 1 game and I believe 3 apps open, which can be switched between in the guide or on the home screen.

2. Yes.
Yes
Time machine.
But that’s purely limited by the size of the device as you need a large driver to get good bass. The sound quality is a good as it gets for the package it’s in.
Had an issue like this many years ago with my iPhone 5, it would go away for a while after restarting, but the only thing that permanently fixed it was restoring the device.
Apple's really gone all in on sound quality lately, the iphone speakers sound good, the macbook and iMac speakers sound good, the airpods sound amazing considered the how small they are and are completely wireless, and the homepod is easily the best speaker of it's size.
Amazon, gamestop, craigslist, letgo, offerup, ebay, etc.
Except that pulled it from the digital store because of the remaster so you can only get it physically, just an fyi.
The only difference I see is an updated lighting engine. The original game never looked bad, imo, but seeing the 'remastered' footage makes the original looks so dark and gloomy.
It makes seeing distant stuff less blurry.
I've noticed  in the server browser there's only 1 or 2 low ping servers and the rest are all 100+, when there's usually a ton of low ping servers for me. Must be an issue from the update and will likely be fixed in the patch for the lag. 
HOW CAN I TURN OFF CAPS LOCK?!
Been around since CE
Have you read any posts recently?
You can't transfer stats.
What do you mean exactly?
Really wish apple would just retroactively keep the stock wallpapers, like on macOS, instead of replacing them with every iOS release.
> Chromebooks are the most popular laptop form factor

I see 1 Chromebook for every 1000 regular laptops, where are you getting this from?
Try restarting the mac and apple TV as well as power cycling your router.
Battlefield 1, latest DLC is great, and Fortnite just because it’s what all my friends are playing.
People have wanted a system wide dark mode for years, it's obviously not a priority for apple as the best thing we have is smart invert and it doesn't even work in all their apps properly.
Turn off offload apps.
Goat Simulator is a classic
Never having to change discs to change games, never loosing or breaking a disc, everything has to be installed on the drive either way. And there’s also game share so 1 digital copy can be played on 2 systems at once, whereas a disc is obviously only 1 system at a time.
‘Free’ alpha/beta tests are rare in the preview program.
Restore through a computer? DFU mode?
Likely nothing from nvidia as they've been using AMD gpus exclusively for the past ~5 years now. However there is that new intel+rx vega chip that could definitely be a possibility.
Could be your mouse failing or acting up. Try a different USB port maybe.
Not a chance in hell
Turn off background refresh for Snapchat?
It’s is in no way confirmed to be coming to PC, and if it is, it’ll be a Windows Store exclusive which only works ok Windows 10. Either way, why are you still running Windows 8?
Uhhh, have you tried playing the MCC lately? The combination of low population and the game still being bug ridden it’s pretty hard to get a match. Even after the patch that fixes the bugs, population is still an issue.
Actually don't buy that. It comes with the old style controller , it's actually cheaper to buy one of the new S style controller (better bumpers, bluetooth, headphone jack, and textured grip) and the play and charge kit separately, here's the links for those:

[Controller](https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Black-one/dp/B01LPZM7VI/ref=sr_1_4?s=videogames&ie=UTF8&qid=1518383222&sr=1-4&keywords=xbox%2Bone%2Bcontroller&th=1),

Not really, I've never gotten the hang of it on console or PC as you keep having to compensate for the pilot turning which is unpredictable.
What mac do you have? All recent ones have bluetooth built in.
TIL about the iPod Hi-fi. I'd imagine the homepod sounds better because Apple poured tons and tons of R&D into making it the *perfect* speaker. You could always buy one, test it, and if you don't think it's worth it return it.
You can set his system as your home system. Only drawback for you is that if you lose internet you can't play your digital games.
No
During the update it’s replacing and rewriting game files, stopping that process completely corrupts the game so it has to be uninstalled.
They’re gigantic compare to the real things, have awful sound quality, and most of them don’t sync properly.
Where have you been?! 343 announced in the fall that they're not only fixing the game, but adding features and Xbox One X enhancements, and this update is coming in the first half of this year hopefully. 
Digital Foundry did a piece on the BC team and after those initial enhanced 360 and OG games they took a much deserved long holiday break and said they’d get right back on it when they returned. We don’t know exactly what they’re working on though.
If another device stats using wifi while you’re connected to wifi it can cause ping spikes and buffer bloat, whereas on wired if another device starts using the network your connection will remain stable.
I'm sure the 2nd gen/revision elite controller will be in the design lab.
Rule 7
Pretty sure they do this so they can add additional lanes in the middle if the traffic demand increases in the future.
It was removed because it was too resource demanding and Microsoft had the data clearly showing that a very very small percentage of users actually used it. Don't see a reason for it to return anytime soon.
You'll get used to clicking home to unlock in no time.
No one knows exactly what it is, but it can be shrinked in 1 of 2 ways in my experience. Method 1) connect the phone to itunes and sync the device, sometimes this drastically shrinks it and other times it doesn't change at all, so method 2) backup the phone to the computer then do a restore and restore from the backup, and this *should* drastically shrink the size of 'other'.
You can't disable the camera from the lock screen. You can disable the camera entirely via restrictions, but I don't think that solves your issue. Either way, you can access photos or anything from the lock screen via the camera, so what's the issue?
It's 100% to do with your TV, there should be a setting to correct it.
PlayStation which has had overheating issues since launch and questionable PSN reliability since it’s inception? Nobody’s perfect dude.
Rule 7 and try /r/gameswap or /r/gamesale
Yeah, streaming any video over your network will hog it’s bandwidth.
Since launch I wish the cloud had a negated suppression/damage effect the further you were from the center. But nope, you clip the very edge of the cloud and take 40 damage and can't see for 10 seconds unless masked.
It doesn't really mean anything, they also didn't directly post anything, it was a retweet of the poncho chief picture and was likely just some fun community interaction, no official announcement or teaser.
When I search 'SE2', all I get is rumors that it's for sure happening.
Wait for the SE2 to see what it has to offer.
Does you monitor have audio out?
> I never see anything posted about it on here

There were nonstop posts about it about a year ago up to E3 as last year would have been the 10th anniversary, the same time they waited for CEA and H2A, but once we got nothing at E3 and beyond we all lost hope. At least they're fixing MCC which is the still the most definitive way to play Halo 3.
take it back.
Definitely a placebo
[Probably amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_2_17/258-7738391-7673133?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=usb+3+2tb+external+drive&sprefix=2tb+usb+3+externa%2Caps%2C233&crid=3LAL2UFJF6898)
Although the Xbox One doubles as a set top box, it's mainly a gaming platform, and I guarantee ESPN and Netflix and such get way way more traffic from actual set top boxes like your Apple TV, Roku, Fire TV, etc as well as mobile and desktops, so they focus their development on those platforms.
 No, but I have heard of this handy tool called google.
It’s BC but no extra enhancements on the X.
The guy filming looks exactly like corey from trailer park boys.
what do you mean by 'new versions'?
That feature is called premium friends and is only active for limited times, there will likely be a premium friends event for the DLC release or even premium trials.
20m, iirc.
Kill trading is in the game only up to a certain distance though.
Nothing that can’t be redownloaded
Either the belkin adapter, the only one officially sold by Apple so it’s likely to work all the time and not cut out, or wireless headphones.
Apple Watch*
Yes there is, features get locked out at 30 days.
The homepod is designed for music/audio, I wouldn't want to use it in a stereo application like this, that's what soundbars and proper setups with a receiver are for.
You should have no issues syncing to itunes if you choose manually manage music. Then you can just drag the cd files onto the ipod without messing with your existing music/playlists.
March at the earliest, possible may/june as that's when the SE 2 is rumored to launch, it could be in the fall, or possibly not for an even long time. It's impossible to tell this kind of stuff with Apple.
Considering how crowded and loud apple stores can get, it wouldn’t be a very good demo.
Exactly, they had to create hype for the series again because of BF4's launch and Hardline... well, just being Hardline. Whereas BF1 generated a ton of hype and we'll get the last DLC probably late spring and by then the next game will be announced over the summer.
YouTube red or some other apps/websites to download videos.
However, they supported Bf4 for so long mainly because hardline was a flop, whereas we might be already getting a new main series Bf game this year.
Microsoft wants ever game to be BC, it's 100% up to the publisher to approve the game for BC, and in this case sadly, Activation will likely be making an MW2 remastered full of microtransaction just like MWR to further milk the series.
Because they're respecting bungie as it's still their IP.
No one chats in any games these days, people are either in private parties or don't want to talk/use a mic because the rare time you do find another person with a mic it's a shouting 9 year old insulting your mother who's got the vacuum running 24/7, has someone is blasting music int he room, and has 7 babies crying right next to the mic.
If you're hunting for reasons to buy one, you probably don't want one.
It was very prominent in the game pass announcement yesterday so it’s definitely still being released.
Nope
This is the service Apple uses to appraise trade ins, see what ta worth here: https://phobio.com/tradein/apple/
Then that’s a complete ripoff unless it’s in awful physical condition.
What year and specs?
Yep
They hinted for you to dump it when it stopped getting supported a year and a half ago.
They have a different hardware version for japan regardless because their networks use different bands. So they have a custom iOS version for those models that keeps the shutter sounds active all the time.
It can totally work with SSDs but would cause them to wear faster.
Why would they publish the game for Xbox if it didn't run well? Every game has to go through certification through Microsoft to ensure that the game is playable.
My 3rd gen was getting super super slow, any input would take 2-3 seconds to register on screen and airplay was almost unusable. Almost caved and bought a 4th gen, however I remembered the service USB port on the back, plugged it into my computer and restored it and it works like the day I got it. I would try that.
Apple wants mac screens to be as color accurate as possible for professionals that are using them, currently OLED cannot reach the color accuracy of IPS.
Both are fast enough to where you wouldn't notice a difference unless your were loading in huge files like a long 4k video.
And the flair gun, it’s completely useless outside of your minimap range, so to use it to benefit both your team and yourself you have to get up close to the action.
Have you tried doing an offline update on the Xbox first? The drive is likely completely fine there’s just a corruption in the OS’s files.
Playable, yes, bug free and 100% stable, no. There will be a patch coming early this year to fix a lot of the bugs and add One X enhancements.
It would be awesome if they converted the Apple TV aerial videos into live wallpapers.
He used to be very respectable when he was just, well... unboxing stuff. Then the subs got to his head and he adopted the I'M GOING TO SHOUT EVERYTHING vlogger style and his content became really hard to watch.
There was just a statement by Tim Cook that you can disable the throttling in the next update.
That’s like rolling back miles on a car; It doesn’t undo   wear on the engine just as resetting you battery cycles wouldn’t undo physician chemical degradation of your battery.
Nope, those are the only ones apple provides.
Likely, but they took a much deserved long vacation for the holidays so they likely have more games in the works.
Actually it was the BC team that did the 4K/hdr enchantments to the applicable games. Digital foundry interviewed them about it.
Don’t even thing this would be DLC, likely one of the main showcase events where you’re driving a heavily modified skyline.
Neither of those are really horror games. Dying light when it gets to night time sorta but left 4 dead is very arcade-y and almost cartoonish.
Have you checked to see if your battery has degraded enough to cause throttling? A battery replacement may fix your issues.
Battlefield has *never* had good matchmaking, it’s always been about the server browser.
They’re finally adding a team balancer.
That was the point of the original SE, a cheap, entry level phone with *some* of the latest specs. The SE 1 started at $400 at launch.
This has been an issue in a lot of BF games, other guy likely had a pretty high ping
/r/gameswap , craigslist, offerup, letgo, ebay, gamestop used, etc.
Series 3 gps is much faster, series 2 was slowed down by watchOS 4 pretty bad.
Yes, sadly
They have added 3rd party webcam support for mixer and Skype. Might still be preview though.
Nope
Why do people hack and cheat? because to them easy/effortless satisfaction is fun, just the way some people work.
Nothing officially announced, but I would really love to see Microsoft make a product of just the mic array from the bottom of the kinect and attach it to standard usb plug which can be used for voice commands/chat on Xbox and can also be plugged into a PC and used as a mic there as well. They could easily sell it for $30-40 and sell a ton.
Nope, you can only 'hide' purchased songs and apps.
It's safe to assume that you're very lucky it seems.
If you contact gamestop support and say that you were given false information by an employee they might be able to refund you.
Only reason not to is that there may be an SE 2 coming in March or possibly later, so I would wait for that.
How did you get the game 18 months ago if it released only 15? haha

But I feel the same, played a ton at launch and slowly tapered off. Bought Destiny 2 and WW2 and only played those for 2-3 weeks each just to realize that they were awful games underneath just designed to sell loot boxes, came back to BF1 after buying premium during the black friday sale and have been addicted to it again since.
Compared to phones, laptop and desktop processor rarely run at max frequency so if the battery degraded, it would have a barely noticeable impact on performance, just much worse battery life, which would be reason enough to get a replacement.
Found [a few good ones](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=iphone+8+plus+full+screen+protector).
Check for yourself: https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status
Using a [relatively thin hard case](https://www.amazon.com/elago-iPhone-case-Slim-Black/dp/B01HRGJLVI), already drooped my phone probably 6 times total from pocket height onto carpet, hardwood, tile, and even asfault and the both sides have been fine.
Someone made a really good point where if they just changed the line to "what computer?" as in, "this isn't your grandma's PC" would make the ad much better, but her saying "what's a computer?" just makes kids look really ignorant.
These have been around for years
You probably should have specified google play **music** in your title, but I couldn't agree more. The app on on both Android and iOS is so illogically layed out and navigation is a pain.
I completely agree.
There’s also alpha, or maybe even pre-alpha, footage of sand trap for Halo 4.
It was a common bug, update your phone and it'll go away
Clips saved externally aren’t meant to be shared on Xbox Live, they’re meant to be edited on a PC then shared on YouTube and such.
Run the benchmark a few times, the score varies every time, the number shown is an average.
Use the server browser, quickmatch always puts me in 100+ ping servers.
Probably could have been fixed with recovery mode factory reset or offline update, but exchanging it works too I guess.
Power cycle system, router, and modem. Test again, still high packet loss? See if there's a firmware update for your router and apply it. Still an issue? Are you using wifi? Don't use wireless, go wired it's the ideal scenario for any online game. That's not an option/still high packet loss? Upgrade your router.
Considering Apple still makes [in-ear style heaphones](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/ME186LL/A/apple-in-ear-headphones-with-remote-and-mic?fnode=34037a92440ca3b0e40f5a4216737fbdba12a2ac6774d465cd64744f871edcbf6becab5d4201849afa919f031a860124d61e362686583d48211436f5dde64385e0b7b2bf7734a78fd4c6dc5d0ffe34f8d02f28968bfc947e5f04fd5fe9568bc1), and they're pretty good quality. It would be nice if they offered an 'EarPod' style AirPod and an in-ear style.
If you swipe the little preview window away they save instantly.
Are you using windows? I was restoring a phone using windows with an itunes install that had gone through many years of updates and it failed 3-4 times, uninstalled and reinstalled itunes and it worked perfectly the next time.
> Nevermind, I googled it.

The world needs more people like you
It could be anytime: March, June, and October are the most likely times for them to refresh hardware. Also it likely won't be a redesign this year, just processor updates.
People love Apollo
If you're using the stock reddit app, it's just slow like that, even my 8 it takes forever to do anything, even with a very solid wifi connection.
Pics?
Was expecting seinfeld saying 'so you like jazz?'
Seems very average (in a good way).
It comes with a trial, either 14 day or 1 month.
You're in low power mode...
You're in low power mode, the cpu/gpu are underclocked when using low power mode.
Open the guide > press 'view' > then manage captures.
3 taps: settings > wifi > toggle. I wouldn't call that 'cumbersome'.
It's OIS
It shouldn't do this by default, but a toggle to enable the feature should be an option.
Because the air is their entry level system and hasn't changed in design since 2012 because why bother putting that R&D into their budget system?
power cycle
No, of course not.
Why not just try?
Was it replaced by a third party or officially by apple?
Have you tried simply power cycling your system?
Xbox Live is the social platform, Xbox Live GOLD is what's required to play online, use parties, and everything else like GwG and DwG are just benefits that you get no matter what.
That's not how this works at all. It's likely that the studio/publisher (so nothing to due with Microsoft) has lost the rights to the series and thus cannot sell the game anymore and they aren't interested in relicensing.
an apple gift card.
Although I think it's useless. Some people think it's the 'coolest thing ever' and constantly change their lock screen photos to live photos.
What percentage of your shots fired hit.
The test was don’t in battlefield 4, a game with relatively low processing delay and from button press to the action occurring on screen was 138ms wireless and 124ms wired on a 1ms response time monitor, and in games with higher processing delay it becomes even more negligible.
>glitch ?

No, this is an accurate recreation of a real life event.
Rule 7, go to /r/gameswap
Battle nonsense tested this and there a wired controller has 10ms less input delay than a wireless one, which is basically negligible when that's stacked on top of the input delay of your display and of the game processing delay.
Why not uninstall and reinstall itunes? doing so doesn't delete any user data.
Bring it into the apple store
AirPort Extreme is dated and will likely stop receiving support in the near future. Google WiFi is a very solid choice.
We already knew this, it was part of the official statement by Apple a few weeks ago.
Really anyone of them will do, just pick one you like the looks of and if you want wireless fast charging or not. Airpower is really only with it if you have an 8/X AND an Apple Watch Series 3 AND the wireless charging airpods, which aren't even out yet, and the pad itself will likely be much much more than any third party pad.
Your online data is store, well... online, you’re fine
Nothing should be deleted, do a backup just in case though
I know for a fact the Halo 3 playlist didn’t have abilities or sprint
Battlefield 2018, Halo 6, and Horizon 4
No
Also there are 2 serious issues regarding the final rendered video that have been present for years now. Problem 1) bitrate: the bitrate of dvr clips is already pretty low, but after rendering through upload studio it gets even worse and you get very blurry compressed videos, and 2) frame-pacing: this is a serious issue where the rendered video has the wrong frame-pacing making videos look choppy and as if they were recorded at a lower frame rate.
The clips are automatically deleted over time I’m pretty sure. There’s a new feature where you can record clips to an external flash drive/external hard drive now, I would start doing that.
Well what's the most you're willing to spend, and have you done my first suggestion to see if maybe the router isn't the issue?
Leave it plugged in for a while and it might spring back to life, but the battery will likely need to be replaced for it to work properly again.
Sounds like an issue with your router. Reset it, update your firmware if needed, if that doesn't work it's likely just a bad router, so you'll either have to run wired (which is always the most ideal), or get a new router.
The only thing I like cod for is that you can get a quick match of any game mode in at any time. TDM in battlefield isn't really fun as the small sections of the map just don't play well, and conquest/rush/operations rounds can take a very long time. That's about it though. 
Although your TV may be rated for low input lag, it’s likely *relatively* low compared to other 4K TVs which all have very high input lag, meaning your Tv still has high input lag at 4K compared to a 1080p tv or monitor.
A 4k input is more for the TV to process than a 1080p input, so you'll likely see more input lag when playing at 4k as opposed to 4k.
The 8 is technically faster as they use the exact same processor but the 8 has a lower res screen to drive which uses less of the gpu resources and ram. Yes the 8 has touch ID.
Do a backup and restore through a computer, should fix it.
The 3 still has a bunch of functionality, but the 2 is pretty much dead.
Yes, they both use the same standard of cable.
Doubt it. Activision will likely remaster these games similar to MWR and dump microtransactions and loot boxes into them.
Dash is rendered at 1080p so that games can use more ram.
What's the point of this post?
I would first rule out any software bugs. The best course of action for this is to backup the device to a computer, then restore it and restore the backup from the computer as well. Doing so through a computer completely wipes and rewrites iOS so it eliminates caches and corrupt files and what not from years or use and updating. Then see if your phone is still slow and having issues. If it is, next step would be getting the $30 battery replacement from apple.
Snapchat sucks for messaging (inconsistent notifications ans such), but everyone has it, so I mainly use that for group chats when not everyone has an iPhone, besides that iMessage is the way to go.
No?
Frame rate is still pretty low on PUBG, but they game will definitely get better over time and you will get a release copy when that happens. I returned MWR after getting it as the microtransactions and such ruined the game and population has fallen off pretty bad.
Here's a good guide: https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-wireless-hdmi-video-transmitter/
For low latency and high image quality, you'd want a dedicated wireless HDMI setup, but they're costly
Amazon owns twitch, they didn’t fire all the dev team and put amazon employees in their place. Also Microsoft makes the api for steaming, twitch still makes the app.
The S supports HDR for games and media, but visual ‘settings’ matches the day one One.
Twit h is in charge of updating the Twitch ap, not Microsoft. It’s like asking Apple to update the gmail app for iPhone, wut? That’s googles job.
Ankers usb c stuff is still the best
TeamViewer?
iOS doesn’t have mouse support, only keyboards.
How long have you had the issue? I had an sd card that was formatted weird and after I filled it more than 4gb it wouldn’t read in any reader, I could only be read through my camera via a usb cable.
It’s been working perfectly fine through all updates for me.
There’s an option in settings, don’t know what sub menu, for ‘full shutdown’, which is the same as holding the button.
I’m sure there’s plenty of videos on YouTube about this
The power of a platform doesn’t drive developers towards what platform to developer for, publishers tell them where to developer their games for based on which companies pays more for exclusivity, sadly.
Yes, it's a very obvious scam
Because there used to be Mac OS Version 1, 2, 3... 8, 9, then for version 10 they just named it to just OS X, and every version past that has just added onto version 10, so we got 10.1, 10.2, 10.3...
It's called reachability, it's so you can reach buttons at the top of the screen while using the phone one handed.
Don't bother trying to game on even the most powerful macbook you can buy, they're not cut out for it it. the 13" pro is perfectly fine for what you're doing.
iirc, apple updated the standalone magic keyboards you can buy with their new switch mechanism.
People who experience 'device-breaking' bugs are in the vast minority, but they're doing to make sure that their problems are heard.
Cold weather + lithium batteries = fast draining and voltage drops (unexpected shutdown). This would have happened with an phone.
Were you talking to real support or ambassador support?
CE and 2 were only 2 player campaign.
You can only have 2 play split screen for campaign, you can do up to 4 in multiplayer.
No you have to manually set it through the router, system, or both
If anything both devices being hard wired is ideal.
Could be an issue with your router. Maybe give both the pc and xbox static IPs so they don't 'lose' each other.
It's a game, it's not realistic in the sense that the gas clouds are small and you can't ads while wearing a mask because of balance.
That’s because google changed their image view layout, it has nothing to do with Apple/safari
Pretty sure you double tap to zoom.
It may be a software issue, you could completely wipe the drive (saving important files externally/in cloud storage of course) and do a clean install of macOS. If it's still an issue it may just be a bad knock-off battery and you should get it replaced with a real one.
No idea why my original link was for the UK store, here's the US link from the education refurbished store: https://www.apple.com/us-hed/shop/product/FPXQ2LL/A/Refurbished-133-inch-MacBook-Pro-23GHz-dual-core-Intel-Core-i5-with-Retina-display-Space-Gray
I doubt the system will ever work properly again, there's too much that could have gone wrong and something on the mainboard is permanently fried.
rule 7
https://support.apple.com/kb/ph21411?locale=en_US
Have you tried clearing the cache for twitch?
Safari is very behind in terms of html5 video, so that's probably why.
Nope

They likely never will because it's not in an majority of developers' interest to publish their apps there because A) they have to pay apple's developer fee, B) apps have restricted permissions, and C) if it's a paid app, apple takes a fee. All of which aren't an issue if you just host your app online for download/purchase.
You have to put your system in offline mode to watch dvds/blu-rays without an internet connection.
How long have you had the controller? It probably just bit the dust.
FYI, your vision for the ideal Halo isn't what everyone else wants.
I assume they would if the batteries degraded enough, however they have massive batteries so it would take much much longer for that to happen compared to an iphone.
Halo will never be the same again as the gaming industry as a whole will never be the same again.
PUBG is a battle royale game and Fallout is an RPG, they're nothing alike.
They also make one with 1 lightning port and a headphone jack: https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HLJV2ZM/A/belkin-35mm-audio-charge-rockstar?fnode=5b82552db4c096712f89889d3e25e9ba4f6683691d5ad9a6aba14e9d3e41c5089ff9a05477fcac648c98faf4cd6cdf4cbdf65bcc7b2833fed7bb052aa77341f9ab1bcf27b8e6528ee95a580ffd277e38dc56d118db1d1fdd811be0fb5c127181
Follow this guide: https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution
OS is likely corrupt, you have to do an offline update.
I doubt it's worth the time or effort.
This is an incredibly common issue. Follow the guide I linked too choosing "i need to troubleshoot an update error", then "i'm experiencing a startup issue".
Why not follow [the official guide for this issue](https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution).
Why not just go to the latest version, siri can easily be disabled.
yes it's fine
You can't
Who ever told you that has no idea what they're talking about.
Yes it can be fixed via software and the impact on performance is negligible.
Your chances of getting a faulty first run unit are likely the same with both editions at this time, the worst thing that can happen is that you have to exchange it for a new one.
Get to the recovery menu and factory reset, if that doesn't work you may have to do an offline update.
Are you trying to watch a youtube live stream or stream from your xbox? Confusing wording.
imgur is the most popular service to do so, it's not a social media, you can choose to have you images only be able to be found via the generated url and not published on the website.
Why would you group the 5 and 5T? The 5 was a disappointing compromise with many faults, and the 5T was a true flagship killer like the original One Plus One.
Those are the one ones at the moment, they'll probably add more the next iOS.
I would get one regardless as it's cheap and you'll get much longer battery life.
Yes
Have you tried a factory reset?
Donate or give it to a friend who you know would love it.
Yes that's the only place where the system exhausts heat.
[This news](https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/7oorvn/steven_spielbergs_halo_series_is_still_very_much/?ref=share&ref_source=link) is on the frontpage.
It's likely not going to happen as insomniac is doing contract work for sony.
Because a mac can last way longer than phones. A mac can be usable for 5+ years years, but a phone after 3-ish years has terrible battery life, and is horrendously slow so why bother pushing updates to it if a majority of owners have upgraded already.
> it’s been over 2 years.

You answered you own question, it's been so long that they definitely don't care and won't fix it now as there are no returns for them.
restart
Standard LED technology is limited in terms or brightness and contrast, OLED can get much brighter and even produce true blacks.
Not at all, Halo has always been about classic, arcade-style even starts.
Halo 3 on 360 is sadly dead, MCC is your best bet.
During the initial setup you have to choose 'restore from icloud backup'. If you set the device us without doing so, you have to restore it and go through the process again.
/r/AskTechnology
Lay off the LSD
Are they using headphones/a headset?
HDR isn’t a gameplay feature, it’s a visual one, of which the X has free range on.
It’s just the difference in the way your tv upscales vs the way the system upscales, put it on whatever you think looks better.
It was just $15 for like a month and a half straight, so probably a while before it’s on sale again.
Intel cpus with integrated graphics are APUs they just don't call them that.
You sound like you're required to use Apple products, but I'm going to let you in on a little something, you're not.
No, because games are required to have feature parity between the One and One X. So if a game can't handle split screen on the One but can on the X, the dev has to scrap the feature anyway.
Yes
fortnite is about the only f2p game worth playing, imo.
bug fixes
This intel/amd chip isn't like a standard APU though, it's more like a standard intel cpu and amd gpu glued together, the intel cpu still has its own integrated graphics and such. Compared to a true apu where components are shared by the cpu and gpu portions. So it is more like a dedicated gpu with a very fast and low latency link to the cpu.
The original SE started at $400, so I would expect $500 max for a new one if they give it a bunch of the newer features, just wait.
This was asked [just 3 days ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/7nzgma/any_word_on_the_hyperkin_duke_controller/), short answer: no one knows.
/r/titlegore
Now the 13 in pro can finally get a dedicated gpu.
It's been out of stock on the Microsoft Store and almost every major retailer for a while now. Usually companies try to get rid of the stock of a product before a next version released.
No, the adapter was meant for controllers before they added the 3.5mm jack on on all controllers, you'd need a headphone/microphone splitter.
For the stuff you're using it for, no more than 8gb is necessary, storage depends on you, I personally don't use much storage, but some people just need to save *everything*
What music app are you using?
My airplay experience degraded over the years with my atv 3. Then just a few months ago I remembers that there's a service usb port on back, so I plugged it into my computer and did a restore of the device and now my atv works like new.
And most importantly, they set the prices of games/dlc.
There are signs that the elite controller is finally going to get updated this year, so I would go with the headphones for now.
You need an adapter to combine them into 1, and you can use standard headphones except apple earpods if you want to use the mic.
It's called packet loss and it's definitely an issue with your connection to the server, don't play on wifi, always wired for best experience in any online game.
No one knows exactly what it is, but it can be shrinked in one of 2 ways in my experience. Method 1) connect the phone to itunes and sync the device, sometimes this drastically shrinks it and other times it doesn't change at all, so method 2) backup the phone to the computer then do a restore and restore from the backup, and this should drastically shrink the size of 'other'.
Not really, they've been using the same design/internal components forever.
They changed lighting because players were blending into the maps too well.
Not really, the most you can do is sell it, or better yet, give it to someone you know would love it.
Wifi calling has other devices disabled as well?
The macbook is slow and isn't intended for gaming at all, the pro, despite having more power, isn't really ideal of gaming either.
You can get a 120gb ssd for like $40-50 elsewhere, the brand doesn't matter at all.
It's hard to say, although bringing pretty much all of their other exclusives to PC, MS could remain reluctant to bring Halo as it sells the most systems and xbox live subs out of all their exclusives.
On your phone, go to settings > phone > calls on other devices > disable.
The app reappears when you use the HDMI passthrough.
I don’t know if this would work, but maybe disabling message notification on the lock screen? My assumption would be that a sound and vibration would be played but it just wouldn’t show the notification card.
*If* Apple were to provide replacements, I’d bet you’d have to have an iMac pro registered to your Apple ID, otherwise they’re probably just going to provide the stand white/silver accessories.
Apple Watch*
They both use the exact same disc drive and output at the same HDMI spec, there’s 0 difference.
Most electronics do in general, phones, laptops, smart watches, etc.
I always had a theory about this. I remember lag in cod never been too awful in cod4 and mw2 (never played waw), then lag became a huge issue in Black Ops 1 onwards, which coincidentally released the same year as the 360 Slim, which was the first Xbox to natively supported wifi, so all those people with shitty routers caused massive latency and packet loss for the rest of us.
Just asked Dice, they said sure /s
Nope, you can play background music through Spotify, pandora, or from a flash drive system wide however.
2 games? We haven’t encountered the flood since 3 and there’s been 4 FPS halos since then.
You can already play at 4K on PC though... so what needs redoing exactly?
Well you do getter better performance and battery life than a macbook (non-pro).
Problem is that you waited so long, you're only going to get $750 max if you sell it or even less for a trade-in. The Macbook (non-pro) is definitely slower, and the screen on the new pros is very good, but you'd have to spend a lot more to get noticeably better performance and the touchbar. Also with the air, you get stupidly long battery life (my 2013 air still lasts for ever).
Trials don't get you DwG or GwG
Although I was never a fan, people wanted firefight as it had kinda become part of the Halo series after being included in 2 consecutive games, ODST and Reach, and all we got were these linear missions that had almost no replayability.
Whatever it is it's already been in development for at least 2 years so no changing now.
Well it's in beta.
Can vouch for CDkeys, been using them for years. G2A and Kinguin are also good code sites to get good deals, but their reputations are less than ideal.
Halo
Nope, that think is a *turd* by today's standards as well. Keep looking on the used market though that's your best bet. You can also do a complete wipe and clean install on the laptop to give it new life.
No it wouldn't be hard, as when they reconnect the kb/m that's something the system can instantly detect and reject the input from them or disconnect them from the controller lobby.
No it wouldn't because there would be some common sense used and devs would have separate multiplayer lobbies/server for kb/m users exclusively so that they wouldn't be slaughtering controller users. 
It depends, do you often feel your games take too long to load, don't look good, and the frame rate is too unstable/low? If so then yes, if no, just wait for the next big console because all new games will be in the original one as well.
The problem is the original Xbox One, the S and X have 4k HDR blu ray drives that support 100 gb discs, but the original doesn't so they have to maintain that backward compatibility. MS is looking into multi disc support though.
Plex, Netflix, Youtube, Spotify, and Pandora are the main non-gaming apps I use.
Is it USB 3 and have you tried a different USB port?
You just gotta go back, really nothing can be done.
The new version just adds wireless charging to the case, that's it, they'll be the exact same earpods though.
I believe the antenna stays running even without service in case you need to make and emergency call, but battery impact should be minimal. Either way, apple has a 14 day return policy even of the product is open and used, and some places (like club stores) have longer return policies.
EarPods don't work because apple uses a non-standard pin configuration that flips the mic and ground connections, any other pair that specifies compatibility with android should work.
CDkeys as always
There's still an outage for purchasing: https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status?xr=shellnav
Yes most earbuds with a mic for smartphones work, however Apple's EarPods do not work, you must use a pair that's compatible with android for the mic to work. 
MacOS*, boot into recovery mode and there's an option to install MacOS over and internet connection.
Just turn it off, with it off all you have to do is hold the button then swipe, that's not much harder than just holding the button down as both require 2 hands anyway.
No, apple would never allow that for security reasons, you can't even do this on mac.
The One and One S have the exact same hardware with the S's GPU clocked ever so slightly faster which makes a marginal difference in some games that are GPU limited, however most are CPU limited in which there is no change in performance. The One X however is faster in that is has much much more powerful hardware and can play games at higher resolutions and higher frame rates with more detail.
No that can only be done with the official wireless adapter
Got a series 2 over the summer, going from 3 to 4 was a massive speed improvement, almost never any lag afterwards, and then with 4.2 my battery got oddly much better, I could stretch battery like to 3-4 days compared to my usual 2-3.
[ODST was never GwG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Games_with_Gold_games) though.
I'm guessing we'll see a hardware refresh soon, probably just a small update to have the front match the new 'S' controller design, and *finally* add bluetooth support. You'll usually see stock of a first gen product like this dwindle off before there's a refresh.
It forces 16x anisotropic filtering, which makes textures look more defined at a distance, that’s all.
The best selling FPS and best selling sports game every year for a long time, nope servers are dead sorry...
Halo all the way back in 2001, I stayed because of Xbox Live and the controller design.
Do an offline update, these issues are caused by years of updates causing small corruptions and such.
> computer says no

Uhh, Microsoft owns windows and they said yes.
The popular BC games get these updated cases
Pretty sure you can do a simple ‘offline update’ to fix this, Ms has a guide on their site on how to do it.
All digital since the One launched.
Eventually once the technology has matured, the oculus, vive, and psvr are all first gen products that each have faults and drawbacks. I'm guessing MS will wait until 2nd or 3rd gen products before officially support VR.
Yes because apple cracks down on cables that aren't mfi certified
CTE stands for community test environment, where changes and additions to the game are tested as minor as weapon and gadget tweaks and as large as testing the new DLC maps and weapons before they launch.
Because it's extremely poorly optimzed
There are none...
Rule 7, go to /r/gameswap
No, it's still pretty dangerous actually. /s
Well first of all buying/selling accounts is strictly against the ToS/EULA for xbox live, so there's nothing that can be done because you both broke the rules.
I'd say very much so. The 8 is blazing fast, the camera is much improved, the screen looks amazing, you get wireless and fast charging, the battery lasts *forever*, and more.
The 8 is 2 processor gens ahead, you get a bigger and better screen, better camera, wireless charging and such, so not only a much better device from the start, but it will last you a very long time.
I'm sure you won't find too many people here. The *average consumer* just gets their phone, either restores from a backup or installs the apps they use, then just use their device. Whereas I assume a lot of people on reddit, including myself, are power users to tinkerers and like to drill through the settings and adjust everything to their liking.
Nope, Apple doesn't sign older version for security reasons. I would try doing a backup and restore through a computer, as this completely wipes iOS from the device and rewrites it which fixes a lot of the bugs and such that can cause performance issues and battery drain, then see if it's still a big issue.
I completely agree in that we shouldn't be mad at Apple at all for what they did, it's just the fact that they didn't tell us they did it. Stopping phones from randomly shutting down is great, they just should have made a popup message if you're phone was affected after updating stating that you may experience slower performance and battery replacement would fix that.
Pretty sure that's just a standard trade-in
Likely the routers QoS prioritizing other services.
You should be fine, most electronics are rated to work up to a certain humidity and if you're room is really dry I doubt a humidifier will produce enough moisture to fry your stuff.
They've been moved to the stickers
Ok, what's your point?
All of them except the extra variants of the class level 10 weapons.
That only happens with matte screen protectors in my experience, any  glossy, tempered glass screen protector shouldn't have these issues.
Rule 2
Ok well what errors are you getting when trying to install windows? Have you tried restarting your system then installing?
Why don't you just restore from settings... 
So what did they do at the apple store?
2 main reasons: 1) from the beginning, Apple was using the best touch input hardware/software to minimize input lag, but in recent years pretty much all Android manufactures caught up to them, and some even surpassed in this aspect, and 2) Apple custom designs their SoCs and they're stupidly powerful. Qualcomm/Samsung/Mediatek/etc. aren't *very* far behind in terms of raw performance, but their chips run way hotter due to them just throwing in cores and ramping up clock speeds to match Apple and thus throttle more which causes random stutters and slow downs. This also means that Apple can tailor their software to specifically work with their hardware in the most optimized way, whereas Android has to work on a broad range of processors with different core counts, clock speeds, and from different brands running different version of the arm architecture and even some x86 devices.
/r/appleswap maybe
Everything you owned digitally is synced to your account, same goes for saves, when you play a game on a different system, it just syncs the save from online.
It's still the holiday season (many people with new devices with questions/issues) and many people are rushing to get their batteries replaced, what did you expect?
assault already has anti-tank grenades, the rocket gun, and dynamite.
Are you sure you plugged it in all the way?
>without any input lag

Well that's physically impossible...
A side gunner that just can just use their regular weapons.
Yeah, but to apples credit imovie and final cut actually take very good advantage of gpu resources.
You'd probably want one with a dedicated gpu to speed up render times, which you only get on the 15"
Gears 4 has much higher quality assets and such because it's X enhanced.
oled panels still don’t have the same tolerances as others
All the battlefield games for sure.
Where’s your evidence? Here’s digital foundry showing that every game runs better, patched or not: https://youtu.be/jYuvL6bO04Q
Likely, and it will get much better with the X enchantment update coming early next year.
No, games that haven’t received X enhancements run better no matter what.
Well what games? Not all are one x enchanted and some that are are still in a 1080p mode or sub-4K. Also check you console and tv settings to ensure it’s outputting at 4K.
That was very likely a placebo
That is very false, it's fine for all of them.
Have you tried restarting it first?
Nope, you can never go backwards with restores.
They would have sold a ton a long time ago if they ever dropped the price to something reasonable. I totally would have gotten one.
On Xbox as well, no issues. Maybe try using the server browser and only choose low ping servers.
iOS 7 was easily the worst of all time, it completely slowed down everything but the 5S, which it was released for, as well as being extremely buggy and causing a ton of crashes and resprings.
You’re better off just getting a new headset
Only ever disconnected around launch when servers were struggling but never since.
It was a 10 year agreement that either started in 2011 or 2012
The sad part is that all the achievement art is concept art that game never came to be.
I'm assuming you're looking for a service to host images online, imgur is pretty much the most universally used service for this.

I bet it was giving people the idea that Apple was tracking them and sharing/analysing their app usage and location data, even though all this data lives on the device only, people will always freak out over anything these days.
imgur?
Apple Watch*
It doesn't seem to suggest Apps at certain times of day or location anymore, it only seems suggests media apps when I either connect headphones or connect to a bluetooth device, for me at least.
The game hasn't failed at all, the game has a [very healthy amount of players](http://bf1stats.com/) at about 90k right now, iirc, BF4 only had <50k total online only a year after it's release. Also on the official [most played list of Xbox One games](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/most-played/games/xbox), which updates in real time, the game is ahead newer games that you'd think would be much more popular like Fifa 18 and the new AC.
Well Snapchat and Youtube are some of the worst apps on battery, so this seems fairly normal.
haha, fixed
I'm sure the S will receive 1440p upscaling support as well. There's no reason that the S can't support it.
Why is there no calculator on the ipad? It's just apple doing random apple things.
You can get a battery replace kit from somewhere reputable like ifixit or owc to save some cash.
The 6 and 6S were plagued with lots of faulty batteries, I know many 5S users that who's phones still run fine, and many 6 and 6S owners that have all sorts of battery and performance issues.
They can probably just go to Apple and possibly get replacements if there’s no serious physical damage that could have caused the issue and it’s 100% software that bricked the phones.
I was gonna ask why did apple ever make a 3 inch long USB to 3.5mm cable?! Then I remembered *that* ipod shuffle.
The apple charger will be very expensive and will offer no benefits over third party chargers except for simultaneous apple watch charging.
DFU restore?
Well of course as apple maps is tightly integrated into iOS, and google maps is pulling much more data.
This is the magnifier, you can enable/disable it in accessibility settings and it's activated by a triple click of the home button (lock button on the X).
/r/titlegore
Of course, it's basically an ipod touch.
Uhh, it's 2017 still
It means you're receiving data from the server at either 30 or 60hz, however, the rate at which you send data is tied to framerate, so since the game is locked at 60fps, you're always sending at 60hz.
Yes you can run it, but don't expect ultra settings
If it's still working perfectly for you and you don't *need* any of the new features/improvements, just wait, there's definitely going to be something new next year.
I've noticed most batteries go sour at about 500 charge cycles, which is a good 1.5 years worth.
Is it your first Xbox ever?
WW2 > BO3 > BO2 > IW > MWR, according to the US most played category.
Not exactly, CoD and Battlefield still dominate the FPS market especially because we only get a new main series Halo every 3 years whereas those games are every and every-other year respectively. But I really believe 343i has a chance learning from all their mistakes from H5, the MCC, and H5 to make Halo 6 the best shooter again.
use the server browser
It does for me, maybe try a power cycle
Use google keep as it could be synced on everything, but went back to the apple notes just for simplicity.
Yes it's possible, but for a lot of games you'll probably want to turn the resolution down to 1440p or even 1080p to get playable frame rates at higher settings/
Although the switch is great, it's never going to get all the multiplats. Enjoy your new system!
Oddly my battery has been much better since the update, losing about 5-10% less daily than before.
I went from the 7 to the 8 when the 8 launched and it was the least *upgrade* of an upgrade I've even done. The only different is wireless charging which I haven't taken advantage of yet, but so far the phone feels similar in almost every aspect, it feels just as the fast, the pictures are just as good, and the glass back just makes me more worried every time I drop the device.
Maybe try enabling PC RGB in color output.
Have you tried any *normal* DVDs?
The only watch that can do all that with an iPhone is the apple watch.
Does the case have a metal backplate?
Save the money and get the 8, unless you're a serious power user and just have to have the latest thing (obviously this isn't the case), the 8 is an amazing device that will be more than fast enough for what you're doing for years to come.
God I hope not, last thing we need is another game being added prioritized over fixing the insurmountable number of bugs.
I think it's just a way to explain the physical changes to the map. For example, bunkers and facilities were added, but those bunkers/facilities aren't there in single player, so the only way to explain it is that online has passed single player.
Are you talking about the zoom magnifier? Go to accessibility settings and turn it off.
I would trust ifixit and owc, as they both have great reputations are big known suppliers.
If you bring it into the apple store explain that it was a replacement from earlier in the year and can reproduce the erratic percentage change between reboots, they will likely replace the battery/phone free of charge.
If you have navigation probably.
~~Just because you never unplug your system doesn't mean the battery is fine, once fully charged the device purposely cuts off power and allows itself to lose 3-5%, then it fills that back up and repeats, after a long time that adds up to a full cycle.~~
^ this is not true for macs, apparently, but is still true for iOS devices.

Anyway, I have a 2013 macbook air and, despite having a newer mac as well, still use it as with a clean install of high sierra it still runs amazingly, plays HD video fine and web browsing is snappy.
The game feels no different to me at all with the changes.
Yeah just about as game sizes are in bytes and internet speed is measured in bits and 8 bits are 1 byte.
If you're surprised that's relatively small compared to a lot of newer games
Overwatch hasn't gotten an X enhanced patch yet, but the system will be generally faster.
There is, it's a little buried though. You have to go to the guide > profile tab > select your profile > select 'my profile' > go to the 'gaming' tab > choose the game you want to see time for > go to the 'progress' tab > go to the side bar and choose 'stats', your time played should be here.

There's finally an iOS 11 jailbreak, so maybe.
Probably after a certain number of cycles I'd guess around 500 as that's when batteries start getting really bad and you experience unexpected shutdowns.
Is you're device warm? Have you been holding it for a long time? Heat is the only reason the device would throttle itself, also try a hard restart and see if you're getting the same scores.
Not happening, Apple is very strict about security and privacy, allowing people to downgrade is basically allowing people to have their data compromised through old and well known vulnerabilities that were patched in newer versions.
Well that's the only way they really can. External GPUs via thunderbolt 3 are not ideal at all for professional use cases as you lose up to a third of a GPUs performance depending on the workload when using an external box.
Basically like old mac pros where we can still change the ram, storage, and GPU, but in a much smaller form factor.
The teased Modular Mac Pro
Just seems like general iOS 11 bugs, you're hardware is likely fine. Try doing a restore through a computer as this completely rewrites iOS to the device which fixes a lot of these bugs, then see if you're still having issues, then you have reason to bring it in.
Uhh if the phones locked they can't access it at all.
What scandal? If you're referring to the battery thing it pretty much only affects 6's 6S's and some 7's that have all gone through many charge cycles which wears out the battery.
Could be the system dying, one thing that causes this is the system not getting enough power. Is it plugged directly into the wall or into a power strip or extension cord with other things? Also it could be a software issue, have you tried a factory reset?
It would definitely feel a lot slower
Try using the online store.
It's part of the winter sale, game pass is $1 as well.
Honestly this 'feature' means nothing, I can't think of a single game that's properly implemented it in recent memory. It shouldn't even be an option for devs to implement anymore.
They don't slow down all older phones, they slow down old phones that have worn out batteries so that they don't have the issue where they just power off randomly even at 20-40%. If anything, you want the latest update because I would hate to have my phone randomly power off, I'd rather it run slower and me get my full charge out of it.

Digital foundry tested it and it doesn't make a conclusive difference: https://youtu.be/Z_vdqTt6HDg?t=59s
They’ve stated that you can buy the wireless charging case separately.
Just the way it’s always been.
Have both system be wired into the router.
This is mainly an issue with 6’s and 6S’s, phones that are already 3 and 2 years old respectively.
Only change will likely be upgraded processors to the new 8th gen quad core U variants for the 13 in and hexa core HQ variants for the 15 in. It'll probably be another year or 2, at the least, until we get an full hardware refresh.
The monitor should detect that it's a 16:9 input and automatically adjust, if it didn't, there should be something in settings to correct the aspect ratio.
Definitely the cheapest from a trusted brand
no
So sad that in the 343 games they layer like 10 filters over his voice to make him sound super and fake and robotic for no reason.
That’s how nfc works
You can install the google photos apps and set it to automatically sync your photos, and you can use google drive to easily share the same files.
Use all of googles apps/services
I think he would like the exterior design, but not be too fond of some of the Ganges in iOSs functionality.
That’s halo 5 btb
He’s asking the complete opposite, iMessage is the only thing he wants to use data for.
Definitely not considering it’s called an ‘Apple Watch’.
Never use upload studio, you’re maxed out a 5 different clips, and once rendered upload studio completely butchers the already low bit rate and makes the video even lower quality and there’s been a bug for years now that messes up the frame pacing making the videos looks very choppy.
I think it would be an awesome collab between dice and the fifa devs where when you launched BF1 on Christmas it prompted you to play a cease fire round of soccer which launched fifa if you had it installed and let you play on a BF1 themed field, similar to the parcel storm golf course in PGA tour.
I’m a very amateur player and the H2 BR turns me into a god, [proof](http://xboxdvr.com/gamer/Zbox/video/34294640). That thing is dangerous, keep it away.
Download all of them via the Xbox app or a site like Xboxdvr.com and just select all the files and throw them into any editing software, some rudimentary free ones being windows movie maker on windows or iMovie on a mac.
There is a 3rd way to play which is at native 4K 30fps, still with the original wonky (by today’s standards) controls, on the Xbox One X.
Half of turning tides (dlc 3/4) has been released. So we’re on 2.5/4 dlcs currently.
Actually the wireless radio built into every system since day 1 has Bluetooth capability, which either means A) MS buys these radios at a discount because the Bluetooth portion doesn’t work and all they need it for is WiFi anyway, or B) they just haven’t turned it on yet.
This could very well be a placebo, the Xbox uses a dedicated hardware h.264 encoder for game capture, so it should have absolutely zero effect on game performance.
Only sync once.
I think the 2013 pro is still an amazing machine considering not much has changed and you're losing ports. There is still sooo much that Apple can implement to make a new machine worth it. They will obviously update to the quad-core 8th gen processors eventually, they could implement true tone, pro motion, face id, and maybe even add a touchscreen, who knows.
To be fair, I don't think the average snapchat user has the latest update and are probably still on 11.0, and a lot of the battery issues were fixed in the newer versions.
It's just 343 doing what they do best following trends in the industry of over embellishing players with XP and meaningless metals/accommodations/accolades for doing even the simplest of things so that they feel a sense of pride and accomplishment and continue playing.
Shooting any silenced weapon while either standing still, or moving while crouching, will not make you show up.
Yes they do, games with dynamic res systems will now run at their highest resolution, games that weren't hitting their 30 or 60fps targets will, and all games have forced 16x texture filtering.
There was a big issue with a ton of the first-run kinects where one capacitor or something would fail causing it to overheat and shut itself off, happened to mine and I just threw it in the box to never be used again. You can pick up a new kinect for incredibly cheap used.
same as all other games, any movement or sound makes you appear, unless crouched.
Yeah... there's already a thing built into find my iphone for this: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207581

They're super expensive in the US now too.
Yes, it actually uses temp to confirm that you’re a living person and not an image or sculpture.
Yes, I'm using a custom text alert at the moment using this method.
Sometimes it takes a while for the data to erase. Just use your phone as normal and maybe power cycle it and it *should* be gone, eventually.
Yes: https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/how-to-make-ringtones-for-iphone/
power cycle both phone and watch
This was the original concept for Halo 5 that was leaked, iirc. The infinity was like the tower where, as osiris, you'd talk to important people - lasky, halsey, palmer - and you'd have a map room where you'd choose which place to look for the chief, then you'd go to that planet/location and look around the open world for clues.
This can be done with existing watches in watchOS 5, no need for new hardware.
It's 'iPhone X'.
Xbox, but thanks for the offer
Link?
Yes, fixed it
No headphone are true 5.1/7.1 as none have 5/7 dedicated drivers and a sub, it's all software processing and marketing speak. There are much much better headphones that aren't branded as such.
There have literally been hundreds of posts on this topic now, please use search/google.
If he makes it his home system it works.
coconut battery.
If you are serious, helicopters were still basically prototypes even by the Korean war, no way they'd ever be in WWII.
All call of duties are 60fps, on the original one and the X, even all of them on 360.
cdkeys.com
It hasn't received an Xbox One X enhancement patch, but it will get the standard improvements which are running at it's highest dynamic resolution, a locked 60fps, and 16x texture filtering.
Happens in a friends car every since iOS 11, very odd.
No because companies who are primarily ISPs, whereas google has other things to focus funds on, will do everything in their power with their billions in profits to prevent google fiber is as many cities as possible.
Considering they still sell the product in stores, I believe they're very much obligated to update the app, give it time though, this obviously isn't their priority,
It's worse for battery because rather than apps being suspended in ram and just resumed when you open them, they have to reload all their assets when opened next, wasting your time and your battery.
Exactly, water is wet, a majority of consumers will buy the cheaper option if all options do generally the same thing.
The internals of a USB C connector are larger than those of lightning so it would compromise the thinness of the device.
You get what you pay for
There is no such thing as a good or bad score, every iphone of the same model will perform within +/-5% of one another.
PUBG is a PC game though and though, that’s the same as saying over watch or csgo are best on Xbox, no one would agree with that.
Xboxdvr.con lets you upload directly to YouTube.
With paradise being my favorite arcade racing game of all time, this would make my life, I feel it will be ruined by micro transactions like MWR, however, like having cars be obtained via loot boxes rather than earning them through races or taking them down.
Mkbhd said it’s been silent for him and he does a ton of high res editing and rendering.
IMO, bf3 was the peak, even after bf4 was fixed with regards to bugs and netcode, they oversaturated it with cheap gadgets, hardline’s theme just wasn’t ‘battlefield’, and BF1 is just way too chaotic.
Premium gas, *if* your car can’t take advantage of it, if you drive a *real* sports car obviously, but your average Camry/Accord won’t perform any differently and won’t be any more efficient on premium gas. Your manual will state of so.
I vote dice as well. Battlefield has very solid gunplay that scales across all ranges, vehicles, destruction, and an engine that scales nicely with large open worlds while being very optimized yet stunningly beautiful and detailed
Also, I’ve never been one for warranties/Apple care, but with the phones getting so expensive, it’s actually worth it now.
Well considering you have to use a third party accessory, it's really pathetic for people that do. I don't personally know anyone that does, and if anyone I knew did, I wouldn't want to know them anymore. If official support is every added, those people should definitely be sanctioned to their own servers.
Don't' you mean GOOGLE's youtube app. Microsoft/Xbox has nothing to with what they add/remove/change.

Many many fans have been asking for/speculating about a vietnam game for years.
Please no
Depends on your internet
/r/iamverysmart
🤦‍♂️ seriously how do people fall for this? I wish internet common sense was taught in schools.
That’s what this post is about, right? I don’t understand
And 3
Apples seems to be really invested in actual ‘pro’ hardware with the iMac pro and upcoming Mac Pro update. Apple could really outdo themselves with a 17 inch MacBook that has the best mobile cpu, best mobile GPU, a 4k screen, and maybe a greatly expanded touchbar that can be used for more things like a ton of macros for editing videos/pictures/audio.
$15 on US store as well.
How does that even happen?
low power mode
Apple's is, usually, never about being first but rather the best. Face ID is 100x more advanced and secure than anything android has had, and I'm pretty sure the iphone is the thinnest phone to ever have wireless charging and be water resistance, sure the display is a samsung display just because they currently make the best oLED panels, and you pay all that money because of the R&D and manufacturing and logistics etc.
Every game has to be installed to the hard drive, even physical games.
Exactly, that’s likely asking how to clean fuel injectors in an electric car.
Well system updates stop for December and January and resume in February, sometimes later
Yep, it records a clip every time you knife someone, rank up, and a ton of other common things.
Well movies are filmed and mastered in that aspect ratio so that’s how they’re meant to be viewed.
Rule 7
welcome to 2013
The *magical* reason is likely that the game is compiled for 64 bit processors and the 5 was the last device to not have one.
Common bug, update your phone
Only way is via the mute switch
They mentioned in the video that they’d have a more in-depth article with actually on-site from the back compat team.
Microsoft has server locations in many major cities, globally, where each likely have multiple 10 gigabit lines.
2 hours is plenty of time.
rule 7
You weren’t forced to buy the adapter, it came with every device that didn’t have a headphone jack from then on.
Considering glass can shatter and aluminum can’t (unless physics has changed), I’d say the 7 is more durable.
Go to bed earlier? Haha, seriously though if you think it’s bugged delete the alarms, restart your phone and readd them.
The 7 is cheaper, 8 has wireless charging, more premium glass back, higher base storage, slight camera improvements, and is stupidly fast but not everything is optimized for it yet so the 7 feels just as fast.
The 5s was the first iPhone with Touch ID and came out in 2013, the s5 was the first galaxy with a fingerprint reader which came out in early 2014. Also it turns out all of Samsung, lg, htc, and even sharp had dual camera phones way back in the early days of smartphones, but the first proper modern implementation, imo, was done by lg with the g5 which came out almost half a year before the iPhone 7.
Voicemail transcription is on every device running iOS 10 or higher, iirc.
Touch ID, Face ID, slow mo, dual cameras, portrait mode, headphone-jack-less design, 3D Touch, truetone, to name a few (don’t quote me on any of these as I don’t know if they were iPhone first for sure).
Why do you need to do this?

Been there since the first ios 11 beta.
This is one area where apple should have put one of those informational splash cards that explains the new screen shot system. There's still people that think you *have* to tap on the preview to save the pictures and that you can't just swipe it away.
I’ve been wanting this since the beta, but dice has weird prioritized considering they added specializations, which I don’t recall anyone asking for, then specializations caused a lot of issues and now they’re focusing on balancing them instead of adding something simple like this that should have been there day one.
I assume these are a bunch of vloggers as I didn't recognize a single one. I watched all of the old rewinds and it really shows that youtube has stopped focusing on viral videos and have started focusing on the creators who just make a ton of content, hence their emphasis on vloggers who make *ok* content, but pump out 1 or more videos daily.
Monitors are just smaller TVs with lower input delay, thy don’t *require* a pc at all.
I don't know why, but people will say no. However, I still own a 2013 macbook air 13' i5, which was criticized for being slow at the time of release, but I'm currently running High Sierra on it and it still runs like a dream. It boots up fast, apps open fast, web browsing is snappy, it can play HD content when connected to an external display flawlessly, and I also used it for very light illustrator/photoshop work and it handled it just fine.

The latest models obviously have faster processors and faster SSDs so I don't see the problem with getting one. The battery also lasts forever, and although the screen is the worst on any Mac, it's still a very nice display relative to competition in terms of colors and brightness when viewed at the proper angle. I've since upgraded to a 2016 pro 13', but still recommend the air to many as it's still a very capable machine despite looking much worse than the macbook and pro on paper.
