[Brach's Pick a Mix candy displays](http://ellenalive.blogspot.com/2012/08/inside-our-five-and-dime.html).

It reminds me of my dad. Before road trips we used to go get a bag of candies. On the drive if anyone in the car spotted something outside that was "strange and unusual" they got to pick a candy from the bag. It was a great way to keep the restless kids occupied in the days before iGadgets. I was in a grocery store not too long ago and stopped dead in my tracks where those candy stalls used to be. It had been probably decades since I last saw one and I was suddenly overwhelmed with grief in their absence. Stupid box of candy.

Go to the engine block - I literally did this this morning and first attempt on "random bare metal" didn't work.I think it was somehow insulated, maybe it was actually painted, or galvanised or something, preventing good contact.
I literally jumped a car 2 hours ago and now I'm seeing this on the reddits.

I tried exactly this approach first but on the 2016 Honda CR-V I was jumping I had to have the dead negative attached specifically to the engine block. Just attaching to the metal around the engine bay wasn't good enough. Maybe what I attached to was insulated, either by rubber fasteners or it was painted and I wasn't paying attention. But when I moved it to the engine block and tried to start again it fired right up.

I was driving down a street they had all the fire hydrants open on, spraying horizontally out into the road. At a glance I could tell it was an absurd amount of pressure, and chose to swing wide around them and still sounded like a person running into the side of my car. But I saw a few cars swerve INTO the stream. I can't imagine how bad it dented up their cars' body panels.
A friend of mine has an idea for a toilet that tests your pee and poop every time you use the bathroom. Also could do all the contact tests from the toilet set like heart rate, weight, bmi, etc. Just hook it up to the network and it becomes a one-stop daily (or twice daily ...) testing center for irregularities in your health.

Shortly after college I was gainfully employed but had a bunch of friends still in college who were meeting for weekly poker nights. We played with quarters to keep it cheap, and they functioned as "chips" fairly well. I was regularly the big winner, but not always. This went on for months before someone pointed out they were mostly all playing with their weekly laundry money, often leaving them scraping by with dirty cloths for the next week.

With that info I started bringing BBQ to poker night. This always got a big round of thank yous. I let that go on for a while before I pointed out to them I was buying them dinner with their own money.

And frankly it's disappointing. Perhaps I should have lowered my expectations.
I was in USVI earlier this year and it's the same thing. I asked some people who spend a lot of time there about it. They said there were a few wind turbines but the hurricanes destroyed them. At the airport there were some solar panels but much of them damaged. In reality not enough of either has ever been installed on the islands to significantly displace the burning of traditional fuels.

It boggles my mind. Same thing in Hawaii, but I hear they're making improvements.

Self important artists at an ad agency. There unfortunately isn't much more to say. I think they were mad about whose work was being used for some project, or one taking credit for the other's work. Started screaming at each other in the middle of everyone's offices. We all stopped to watch. Cheap entertainment. Dude stormed off with an 8 year old girl's temper tantrum right as managers were beginning to step in, obviously furious but also obviously holding back major giggles.

The same woman (probably 10 years old than myself) cornered me, the IT guy (who'd been with the company probably 5 years longer than her), in the mail room one day and started demanding I do something about the way her computer worked (this was 15+ years ago, I really can't remember details). She was excessively rude and wildly out of line. I told her in a calm voice that the first thing that was going to happen was she would apologize to me. And then we'd both go to our respective offices where I would wait for her to send me a polite email with her request. Of course she blew up again immediately to which I responded with a smile, "OK then.", and walked straight to my boss to give him an update.

I don't like playing tattletale, but my first thought was to call her a Demonic Cuntasaurus Rex (or something equally as eloquent), which would have just played into her shitty office bully tactics, and likely gotten me reprimanded instead. As I recall she later came to my office and apologized, then sent me an email. When she wasn't being a tyrannical bitch she was fun to be around and a really good artist.

The guy, who was super fucking talented, was also a huge ball of unbridled emotion. We had our run-ins, too. Mostly he was constantly having problems with his computer, the vast majority of which he caused himself through complete lack of understanding (I got all the artists new monitors - he asked if he needed to move all his icons off the desktop before I swapped the displays ... bruh ...). He accused me, more than once, of sabotaging his computer because I didn't like him. No man, you're handling that just fine yourself. One day he said, "You probably think I complain a lot. But you know what they say - squeaky wheel gets the grease!". To which I cheerfully responded, "No man, squeaky wheel gets replaced."

Everyone is reading this as MW saying, "***Neil you're out of line and you're embarrassing yourself.***"

But what if MW were saying "Neil." mocking his comments about the usage of "awesome"? Or maybe not even mocking, but APPROVING of his statement.

[MW don't have their own definition of the word neil](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neil), [but dictionary.com do](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/neil).

> "*noun 1. a male given name: from an Irish word meaning “champion.”.*"

And [MW's definition for "champion"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/champion) includes the following:

> "*3 : one that does battle for another's rights or honor*"

Perhaps they're in fact saying, "***Neil deGrasse Tyson, you magnificent dork. Thank you for standing up for the honor of the english language.***"

You pick who cuts.

You are wrong. It is expected that a sit-down restaurant would provide service including filling ice water glasses on demand. It's part of the service you are paying for by patronizing the restaurant.

Would you rather I said nothing at all and then reduced my tip, with no explanation, leaving the waiter clueless as to why they were paid less, or how to improve their service in the future?
Yes, there are a lot of "tools" that use batteries. It's a joke. But it's based on a reality. Near universally, power tools that receive power from mains are more powerful than tools that receive power from in-built or attached batteries.
Yeah I was going to say - they're stirring together more metal, and that's a good thing.
I believe you are correct.
Toys use batteries.

I think Trump is a dipshit, just as much as the next guy, but we need to clarify something here.

His policy is about enforcing legal immigration. He is opposed to people being in the United States illegally.

So for someone to go through the appropriate legal steps to becoming a citizen of the United States of America would likely please him.

Because at sit-down restaurants the servers *typically* serve. That's what they're paid to do. And pouring water into glasses is just about the most basic restaurant server task there is.
But it's true! The guy on the internet said so!
No not at all, but OG like to think of themselves as some kind of affordable fine dining and I found it funny that the waiter didn't fill the glasses before leaving the pitcher.
So the dog entered the scene with the ball? I really don't want to have to open this in ImageReady to find out.
I went to OG with some friends one time and the server placed a pitcher of water in the center of our table and walked off without first filling glasses, so I said, I assumed under my breath, "hmmm, I guess I'll pour it myself". The dude spun around and ran back to the table to fill everyone's glasses. When he left all my friends cracked up laughing.

My best friend growing up was a belligerent fan of TGV during orange and gray time frame, the first picture. It didn't matter what anyone said, "No man, TGV is the best." This from a pre-teen in a tiny town in rural USA who had never been to France. I don't know what his tie to France was, but there were a few other instances in his life like this. Always weirded me out.
Works on older dogs too. I used to hang stuff from my tree for my 2 year old dog to try to get.

A while ago I moved from where they like to hand out single use plastic grocery bags, to where they charge for plastic grocery bags, so we slowly collected a bunch of reusables. We then moved to where they don't even provide plastic grocery bags.

I'm now back to my starting point. The first couple times through the grocery store the baggers would put everything into plastic bags and then into our reusables (same ones we got ten years ago). My wife said, and I quote, "What the fuck are you doing?" The bagger just rolled their eyes and said, "Thank you, have a nice day." On a later trip to the same store we forgot our bags and before we could grab a couple (which they actually have for sale), the bagger started putting everything into one-use plastic bags. Fine whatever. Until we got home and we realized literally every item was in its own bag. Even the vegetables that were already in a vegetable bag from the produce area. Hand full of asparagus in a clear bag inside of a grocery store bag.

WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS MENTALITY!? Set all the environmental stuff aside. The absurd waste of business supplies alone should encourage the store manager to squelch that shit.

I've driven my Jeep over the Rocky Mountains several times and watching the MPG plummet on the uphill side is depressing. Then realizing you're also throwing energy away by using friction brakes on the downhill side just makes it that much worse. In an EV you at least get some of that extra effort back.

I also drove my Civic Hybrid in the rolling hills of western Maryland many years ago. Climbing one hill would drain the little battery to the point it would go into petrol assisted regen while climbing. Then full coasting down the other side would fully charge it at which point regen would disengage and the car would start to accelerate rapidly.

Story *TIIIIMMMEEEE* again, gentlemans.

Many moons ago **[my cat Chips](https://i.imgur.com/JizDKl1.jpg)** was napping on a chair with his outstretched paw dangling out past the edge of the seat. Along comes **[my dog Jake](https://i.imgur.com/PRBa85Y.jpg)** looking for someone to play with.

At first Jake just bumped Chips' paw with his snoot. Chips didn't react to Jake's satisfaction. So he licked at that little paw, trying to encourage a playmate. Again, Chips didn't budge. Jake got a bit more aggressive and mouthed at Chips' outstretched front leg, eventually getting the whole paw inside his mouth.

This is when Chips decided he was done with the wiggly dog, and extended his claws - into Jake's tongue.

The look on Jake's face was hilarious. "OH MY GOD. OH - MY - GOD", certainly was rushing through his brain as he whimpered and squirmed. Chip's held him there for a few seconds before retracting his claws and then tucking his arm under his body.

Jake just sat back, a fair distance from the cat, and waited for him to be done with his nap.

Pretty mildly embarrassing, but I am very uncomfortable sitting with nothing directly in front of me, such as a table, ottoman, dash of a car, etc.

At friends' houses that didn't have a coffee table I would typically just sit on the floor with my back against the couch, or other such arrangement.

I avoid pooping in public restrooms at all costs, but on the rare occasions I have to, I am one of the ones who goes into stealth mode.

Until one day in a bathroom with like SEVEN stalls all empty, I take a seat at the far end. I'm doing my business when someone comes in and sits directly next to me! Apparently he didn't know I was there until he sat down and noticed my shoe under the wall. Now it's a standoff. Dude isn't shitting. I'm not shitting. Both just *sitting*.

I gave it a good minute of deep thought and decided to be the first one out. I let rip a nice loud shit/fart/shart, wiped, flushed, pretended to wash my hands, and bolted out of there before the other guy finished.

After that I just don't care anymore and get on with it. Everybody poops. We're all aware it's gross and noisy and smelly. Just get on with it. It's part of life.

Is there something wrong with an NPR link?
That seems more perpendicular.
I realized that a while back. It's easier to say to your boss, "Yeah I fucked that up. How do I fix it?"

They will know immediately when you're lying and trying to cover for yourself.

Then after you've taken full credit for just fucking up a few times you'll learn to do due diligence in your work and you'll fuck up far less often.

And the other part of all this is learning to cover your ass (CYA) with proper communication trail (emails and confirmations that other people agree with your decision before doing work, or have otherwise given you authority to do something).
I think this is the biggest reason anyone changes their mind about something. They were delivered a false reality of what the thing was and when they got the big picture they developed a new opinion.

So honestly, you didn't have an opinion of "country music" to begin with. You had an incorrect label for modern shit music.
Maybe it does - this gif doesn't prove it one way or the other ;)
That's the golight.

I find the whole thing frustrating and look forward to a time when I'm not flying so frequently.

It's also possible not fear **AND** not respect their manager. In which case they will either slack off completely, or work very hard to replace the manager.

I've been through more than 20 different airport precheck lines - it's different at every one I've been to.
People - they're no damn good.
Seems like it was invitation only as well? Like, each person could invite 2 or 3 people, and each of those people could invite 2 or 3 people, or something?
Precheck and Global Entry used to be so much better! They're still very helpful, but nothing like they were four years ago.

It's amazing how completely moronic people can become in large numbers.
And still have tens of billions of dollars. They could also be educating the people they're saving from disease and providing them with jobs creating free clean energy. Which, in case you were wondering, is something beneficial.
I think the front fell off.
I wonder about tying a long line to the rig before cutting it free and lowering it down below the danger line of the hull. Then hoisting it if at all possible later. It could make a good sea anchor too to steady the boat.
I'd like to see someone like Gates or Buffet do that with a cool useful technology like wind turbine construction or solar panel farms.
I think that's called "art".
I hope to never be in the position to find out, but it really seems like there should be a way to pull all that gear up on board and fasten it down.

Maybe not during the storm that ripped it off, but a few hours later if it hasn't torn the rest of the boat to shit.

Various TV shows such as Avatar: The Last Airbender, Parks & Recreation, Firefly, etc.

Various foods and beverages such as asparagus, shrimp, and warm teas.

Massages where you are expected to get completely naked.

Spain.

Various musicians such as Katy Perry, and Pogo.

Bunch of stuff. You have to try new things all the time because your interests are likely changing all the time.
No, because it's a setup and those are likely the display models that have something else wrong with them already.
A quick glance at tides.net says there's 15 to 17 foot tides in that area.

Surely you don't have such a huge variety of nuts and bolts on deck that you need that big a variety of adjustable wrenches?

I would take inventory of what's on deck and replace at least five of those adjustables with properly sized wrenches. Adjustables are good for when a nut or bolt has become missized due to a variety of causes, but they should be considered a tool of last resort.
Nut fuckers *indeed*. I went up a friend's mast this past weekend to adjust his windvane that had blown out of square and he handed me a weak pair of nut fuckers. I just smiled and said "I'll see what I can do ...". They did that awesome thing where the jaws bind on the nut and won't let go and the rolling adjuster won't loosen up, so then I was 45 feet above the water swaying back and forth and had a tool stuck to the boat. It eventually broke free - I almost dropped it, and achieved no effort in adjusting the hardware properly. I just bent the vane arms into their proper place and told them to lower me back down.

Nut fuckers. Not even once.
I wouldn't call it useless, but I would call it peculiar. I'd rather have a hefty set of bolt cutters than an axe for anything that he'd use an axe for on the boat.
This has the potential of being some of the best television ever produced.

Actually, no, the first thing I said in this thread was "Didn't they do it originally just as a gag show, one time thing?", but if you interpret that as "being a douche" then I wish you well on your adventure in this life.

It's also possible to get a disadvantage out of using it. If a person sinks too much effort into managing a Facebook (or other) profile they likely will miss out on something else more important.
That's your opinion.
It's worth it. We also paid for the "First Class" tickets and it was pretty great. Look up the details - no need for me to post them all here.
That's not math, that's conjecture. You have a sampling of one.

Quite a few years ago there was a designer that did mockup fake designs of what he thought Apple should be producing. I think he called his website Applele or something. Can't find anything now, but his designs were pretty amazing. This was all pre-iPhone I believe and mostly all-in-one computers like iMacs and such.
It would have been better to give her directions to share it publicly.
Actually it's been proven that this is incorrect. It's that negative people are more prone to speak their mind than positive people. It comes down to "I agree, why should I add to this?"

So you use a drone to carry a lightweight string over the top of the rock and down the other side. Then you use that string to pull a heavier rope, and again to pull a heavier rope, until you have your climbing rope over the top. Tie one end of the climbing rope to a tree. Climb the other side of the rock.

Every cat I've known has really enjoyed a good deep rubbing massage forward of their ears. I imagine that's a hard spot for them to scratch, it gets lots of funky earwax, and under the skin is the muscles that operates their jaws so it's probably sore. You're making their skin and muscles feel good at the same time.

Holy cow how did I not think of that ...

But it's a lot more photoshop work than I wanted to do.

I think it's actually a blending of Paula Deen and Katy Perry.
Seems like it might be easier to come down from the deck using a halyard than try to board from a jet ski.
No poops came out? How is that even possible?
That's TERRIBLE. But come on, why is a pregnant woman on a ski lift?
I don't know why but it never crossed my mind that a ski lift would fail in such a way. That's some terrifying stuff.

About 25 years ago my family was driving the loop at Yellowstone and a bunch of people had stopped to watch a family of moose. My sisters and I ran out to get a closer look with our cameras. There was a ranger nearby who, with his hand on his holstered gun, shouted to us, "***PLEASE STEP AWAY FROM THE MOOSE!***"

It's become a family saying. At the time we were rather overcome with excitement, but shortly after we all realized how big of jerks we were being :(

This is fantastic and I hope it catches on at all the MLB parks.

Perhaps an unexpected side effect will be fewer kids down in the other seats (bonus for those of us wanting to be obnoxious adults), and people who historically only bought upper deck seats might spring for more expensive seats away from the "family section".

So many benefits to this promotion.

That's a Fountaine Pajot Orana 44. I believe the factory main has three reefing points. It appears to be on the second one. According to the official FP user's manual for the reported amount of wind they should have 1 reef in the main and the jib at 2/3. I think they're full jib and 2 reefs. Captain's prerogative at that point.
These are really incredible stories, but as time passes and technology progresses this will become even more common. Partly because vastly more photos are being taken, and partly because of face recognition. After you meet someone and take current pictures together, then search your library for "pictures of Bob with Sue" you might find one from 15 years before you officially met.
And it doesn't have words on it.

Yeah, don't go blabbing about everything in your life to everyone you know. Only tell them about things you've done, or things that are currently happening. Telling them "I'm thinking about going to Disney World this year!" sure is exciting and lots of fun to talk about but then when you don't go everyone, including you, will be bummed out.

Do your research, make your plans, pay for your tickets, then tell people. You'll have more to talk about then anyway.

Feeling heroic many years ago, I carried a large extension ladder halfway around my neighborhood to get a cat out of a tree. As I was coming down the ladder an elderly woman came out of the house to say, "Is my damn cat up the tree again? Second time today! Had to get her out three times last week too."

Still about 10 feet up the ladder I just tossed the cat out (she landed mostly gracefully). The woman just nodded and said, "Yup. Seems right."
For the express purpose of destroying our oceans, no doubt.
I remember when this announcement was made, and thinking, "That happened *just now*?? Shit there are a lot of people in rural areas."

I was going through my grandfather's money collection last year and found a 10,000,000 Hungarian bank note. I googled it and it said it was worth something like $37,000 USD in 2017 money. Immediately I was like "holy shit it actually has value?!?!", then dug a little further and realized it was a dead currency so it's only collector's value of like $6, which is probably less than he paid for it 20+ years ago :(

I was just talking about this sort of thing with my sister. She recently moved into a house with power outlets in some of the most obscure locations. I recently moved out of a house that had a distinct lack of light switches (for rooms with multiple entries), where you would have to cross a room in the dark to get to the only light switch.

I get that builders are trying to make the house for as cheap as possible, but the house I sold was half a million dollars. Another couple hundred bucks to run the extra wires and put switches in the appropriate place is a no brainer.
My dad was a University of Texas graduate, a Longhorn alum. But later we moved to Arkansas, which at the time the University of Arkansas considered Texas to be the arch nemesis. My dad went around teaching everyone's toddlers to "[Hook'em Horns!](https://www.hornfans.com/attachments/texas1-jpg.786/)" - it looked a lot like this little guy working to make his rock'n roll fist. The parents just shook their heads and rolled their eyes and my dad thought it was hilarious.
Oh not really. There are lots of examples of people having screwball ideas for a business and run out of money long before they complete it because they have absolutely no sense of the cost of things. Get out on some long stretch of highway through the southwest sometime and you'll see all kinds of businesses in the middle of nowhere that just totally flopped, if they ever officially opened in the first place.

See that valve at the top with three sides? In my heart two of them are stuck together. It sucks and I'll likely eventually need surgery to replace the whole valve.

I received this lovely defect from my mom's dad's side of the family. His surgery included a scar on his chest that literally went from the bottom of his neck all the way down to his belly button. One of my cardiologist told me they likely won't even need to cut me open to do my replacement. I find that hard to believe but whatever, good luck to scientific medicine advancements.

Many years ago we were walking our pit/boxer/ridgeback/mutt who had an ability to be a fearsome looking dog. But in actuality he was a big baby. While my dog was sniffing some trash on the sidewalk a tiny (fit in the palm of your hand) puppy came running out of someone's backyard and straight into my dog's hind leg. He was so startled that he yelped and launched several feet straight up. I didn't stop laughing until we got home.

I was at Magic Mountain recently. A day pass is about $65. But if you want to NEVER WAIT IN ANY LINE you can pay $350.

You are provided a personal assistant and literally are escorated to each coaster of your choosing where you board immediately while the people standing in line watch. I watched a group of six people ride the same ride three times in a row, no waiting, seat of their choice, where the line was approximately 45 minutes long.

And honestly, if I knew that was a thing before I bought my ticket I would have done it as well.

Your internet is now the same. Not only that, but what you've been paying for the past decade will now be hindered in order to encourage you to pay more for the same performance you used to get.

Several comments about maintenance forecasting. My thoughts on that is most people say "budget X% of the purchase price for monthly maintenance", which I've alway found to be utter BS. The purchase price reflects nothing on the maintenance costs. What if you get a forty year old 54' ketch for $100,000? I bet the maintenance is going to be SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER than buying a two year old boat for $100,000.

Someone needs to come up with a maintenance forecasting scheme that is based more on reality, with some variables to provide values to, and plunk out an answer. Things like age, most recent significant refit, and climate its spent its life in.
Probably the area is overwhelmed with wifi from multiple access points and you're getting bad radio frequency overlap. You have to get closer to the one you want to connect to in order for your computer to isolate the communications from that piece of equipment.
They're talking about "public" hotspots provided by Comcast/Xfinity with access as part of your home internet service. I've used it many times in the past at places like hotels, coffee shops, etc. I usually have good experience with it, but apparently most people don't.

They have [an interactive map](http://wifi.xfinity.com/) so you can see where it's (supposed to be) available.

Magnificent piece of equipment. I wonder if anyone is making a modern version.
I'm fairly certain it's called a 420 because it's 420 cm long, which is 13' 9.3", or just under 14'.

I'd say something 12 to 15 feet is about right and would fit under the solar arch on the stern of a catamaran, or possibly on the cabin top.
That just means you get to enjoy it longer :)
What would be a good sailing dinghy for an old dude to carry on the back of his cruising boat while touring the world? I want to go fast, but I don't need one of those crazy things with wings out the side. The 420 looks pretty great, but seems to be targeted at the younger crowd.
Well we're in the process of purchasing a boat that is currently in the Caribbean. It'll be a long trip but we do have plans to take it all the way to Chicago. WOO!

The *absolute worst laptop I had* was another story! (which I've also told on reddit before)

We had some utter piece of shit laptop, no idea where it came from. I replaced it for the user and it was sitting on my desk waiting to be sent to the grinder. It disappeared and I thought nothing of it, trash anyway. A couple weeks later a woman I'd already decided was a worthless employee brings it to me for repairs. First I asked her where she got it from and she didn't even lie - she said she saw it in my office and took it on a vacation. Yes, that's theft. So I asked her what was wrong with it. She opened it and half the keys were missing and there was an *odor*. She said her dog ate a pound of chocolate and threw up on the laptop. She "cleaned it" but the keys came off and she wanted me to put them back on so she could keep using it. The laptop she stole, she now wants me to fix so she can continue stealing it. To prove it still worked she reached over and turned it on. Within seconds it started emitting the scent of dog vomit being cooked. "GET THAT THE FUCK OUT OF MY OFFICE."

She was fired shortly after.

My previous employer hired a new guy. I assigned him one of our typical cheap business Dell laptops. He instantly complained and demanded something better. I said no. About two weeks later he brought it to my office crushed and bent claiming he had set down his bag in the parking lot and a truck ran it over, again demanding a newer better laptop. I looked it up on Dell's warranty site and it had "complete care". They replaced it with an **identical** model. He quit a couple weeks later.

Go fuck yourself, elitist prick.

My sister found a box turtle in her backyard. It had a mangled foot. She named the turtle Mangly, took it into her home, and began feeding it. She took it to a vet who said it needed to do physical therapy (physiotherapy for you Euro peeps). Every day she put the turtle on a wooden block where its feet couldn't reach the ground and it just ran in the air for about 15 minutes. Eventually she returned Mangly to the yard where the little box turtle lived out its life. But every day my sister would greet Mangly in the garden with fresh lettuce and carrots and other vegetables, and Mangly would come running.
And that's my new phone wallpaper.

It's fun to watch animals come out of their shell when they're in a place with people who care about them.

I actually find that to be an attractive train. The color isn't my first choice, but it's not even bad itself.
I've pondered on "emergency response trains" for North America. Seems like with modern infrastructure and technologies, a set of properly equipped trains could be parked in the central states and reach any corner of the continent in three or fewer days, with a small city's worth of response equipment and housing.

Yeah that's the worst thing about it. The dog is doing something totally absurd and annoying but it's doing what it was trained to do so you can't really correct them. So the humans all change their behavior to accommodate this weird old pupper.

We taught our dogs to do the basics. Sit, stay, come, bed. There were a few others like "OUT" (leave the room), backyard, "all done" (for when you were done petting them). But nothing that was like a *trick* per se. So when someone new would enter their area they'd run over and sit and wait for attention. Sometimes they'd push their head against the person's thigh. For the most part it was really good. Especially because they were 65+ pound dogs that had the ability to sometimes look quite menacing.
Don't teach them to do anything that you will regret when they're old and senile. Such as "shake" or "beg" or "speak". They will do it **all the damn time** to every person they meet. It's not a good feeling when your 14 year old dog runs up to a new house guest and plants their big dirty paw right in the person's thigh trying to shake hands.
Because they're already on the payroll, whereas people who are already trained in it are not on the payroll and that would be an additional expense.

Why is China using soldiers to plant trees instead of hiring arborists, or college students? Because they're already on the payroll. This is an exercise in redirecting existing expenditures away from warfare and into positive activities.
Seems like that could be a prime contender!
But not exactly groundbreaking (no pun intended). It would take some engineers to diagram where to put the bolts for the frames, and then a bunch of low skill installers to come through and assemble everything.
Wouldn't it be cool if the USA reassigned even just 1,000 soldiers to install solar panels on all the government buildings?
Well that's silly! You're a train, you're not supposed to leave things behind.

Speaking from personal experience ... multiple personal experiences ...

Getting beaned in the head by a basketball makes you ***want*** to fall down, but doesn't necessarily put you down immediately. The worst was the time we were playing at night with just a driveway spotlight lighting the "court". I put my hands out to receive a pass, ball went through my hands and hit me square in the mouth. I was wearing braces at the time and they embedded in my lips. I stumbled backwards then doubled over in pain and hit the ground. I don't play basketball in the dark anymore.

It's really hard to find.". After a moment of silence he says he'll keep his eye out for white toner and let me know what he finds.

In the early days of our relationship my wife and I both wanted to travel. We dreamed of month long trips to Europe and realized how expensive it would be. I casually threw out the term "See America First" ... so we did.

Over the course of about nine years we've visited all 50 states, including each of their capitol buildings (as a defacto destination in each state). It's been grand and I highly recommend it to all travelers of the nation.

EDIT/PS: We even did some of it by train!
It's actually multiple trips over about 14 years.

I'd say Nebraska, Kansas, and western Oklahoma.
I lived in Vancouver, WA for six years and extensively toured Oregon. The only county in Oregon I haven't been to is Klamath.

My map, as stated in the previous comment, is incomplete.
Actually I've been to every state in the Union and visited all 50 state capitol buildings.
In truth I don't, and this map is missing a couple trips through. In reality there aren't good routes from PNW to southern midwest.

If you're like me and have been hearing the word potash for years but never took the time to learn what it is, now's your chance!

[Potash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potash)

> Potash (/ˈpɒtæʃ/) is any of various mined and manufactured salts that contain potassium in water-soluble form.[1] The name derives from pot ash, which refers to plant ashes soaked in water in a pot, the primary means of manufacturing the product before the industrial era. The word potassium is derived from potash.[2]
.
Potash is produced worldwide at amounts exceeding 30 million tonnes per year, mostly for use in fertilizers. Various types of fertilizer-potash thus constitute the single largest industrial use of the element potassium in the world. Potassium was first derived in 1807 by electrolysis of caustic potash (potassium hydroxide).[3]

So the short form is, **fertilizer ingredient**, and we make/use an absurd amount of it each year.

The original sky scrapers were mountains.
And/or cut.
A wire coat hanger machine is not the greatest example, but lets say there is a factory somewhere in the world where people bend and cut wire into hangers by hand. How soul crushing would it be to spend years hand bending hangers and then one day this rolls into the shop and everyone is sent home, permanently.

Are there any actual examples of that happening? Just all in one go, dozens or more people put out of a job? I would think typically it'd be a slow progression, unless something like this fully functioning were transported to a "3rd world" country where industrialization was still catching on.
Me too! It was great fun :D

If "netflix and chill" means "have sex", then the actual translation of her statement is "I have 15 minutes of sex coming to you soon". I translate that not to mean a sex tape, but actual sex.

So no, she's not releasing a sex tape. She's releasing sex. To you. Soon.

It's not that Italy is big - it's that the northeast of the US is perceived to be larger by Americans because of how close together the big cities are over there compared to how spread out they are across the rest of the United States. You think of the dozen or so big cities in the northeast and surely they must be as spread out as a dozen big cities in some other part of the country, but in fact they're all smashed on top of each other.
It is. This is exactly what I'm talking about. NASA decides not to give a reason for swapping a staff member out of a mission, regardless of what the reason is. The media (which includes the BBC) knows that it will create interest from the general public and reports it. NASA knows this from the outset and was looking for free/cheap publicity (which is essentially just people talking about NASA, regardless of topic).
I.R.O. The thought of it keeps me awake at night.
How does that change NASA withholding information in order to create media buzz?

I've had people say to me, "but who will take care of you when you're older?"

Is that why you have kids? Because you want a guilted nurse? It's cheaper to save the money you'd spend on kids and pay someone that knows what they're doing!
They're all so young. And so very very silly. 
Happy cake day.

A thousand guys to maintain locomotives? Sounds like I'm right, then.
20 years ago I was making like $6/h and my boss called me in for a chat. She was really excited and started to say things like "You've been doing really great, everyone is really impressed" so I started thinking hell yeah I'm about to get a dollar raise or something!

$0.05/h raise. I was working about 17 hours per week. That's less than a dollar ***per week*** raise.

THEN I had to act all excited because it seemed a big deal to her and I didn't want to offend her or make myself look bad.
This makes me wonder if people who have friends with really well known character parts use the character's name in the contact entry in their phone so when that person sends them a message it's as if it's from the character.
I can't imagine how difficult it was to maintain locomotives in that era. Even with all our power tools and sophistication it's still hard to maintain them 140 years later.
A friend of mine had a trick - he'd stick it to his bluejeans first to neutralize some of the glue on the sticker. Apparently it worked pretty well, but I never did it myself.
I did that in elementary school. Got four stitches in my eyebrow.
[Does not compute](https://www.thesaleslion.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/confusing-tech-language.jpg).
It's as if there is a great separation.
I can't believe that red car is street legal - it looks like a toy.
They had to head up (turn into the wind, right in this case) to avoid their sails hitting the mast of the sailboat, but that swung the stern (back of their boat) closer to that beige powerboat. Tricky situation - a bunch of close calls all at the same time.
I think boredom would kick in pretty hard after about 15 minutes.
Yes, that appears to be correct. Along with:

* I Start > Message > No response: 2
* I Start > Gif > No response: 3
* They start > No response: 7

The "petered out" can then be mathed out but I'm a lazy slob.
/u/stabbot  are you ignoring me?
We moved from the south to the northwest where my wife got a job working with kids. In the fall she made a comment to one of the kids asking if they were excited to play in the leaves and the kid just had this seriously confused look on their face. Later one of her coworkers pointed out that in the northwest winter is rather wet and the leaves are just a goopy pile of nasty.

I wonder if this could be stabilized.

If you're going to build a car, it'd be difficult to pick a better one.

They seem rather similar, for good reason. They're both genus lupinus. But something makes me think there are some key differences since Alaska and Texas are kinda different climate and terrain :D
Was it Cinnaburst?
A friend of mine took the paper wrapper off a Reese's and there was another one on it so he ate it. When questioned why he would eat the second wrapper he said, "I didn't know why it was there. I thought I was supposed to eat it."

O_O
I was hoping for poop juice, but ass juice works fine I suppose.

/r/nocontext.
I knew that was a bit of an underestimate, even as a joke, but I didn't realize how much.

[Looks like it's about 27:1](http://www.in2013dollars.com/1860-dollars-in-2017?amount=1), or maybe slightly higher. I was expecting it to be more like 2000:1.

This looks like he's several kilometers from shore - is that safe?
This gets talked about a lot.

Most of the time when I'm typing one up I realize I'm rambling on and then just delete the whole thing instead of editing down.
I'm genuinely curious what happened. Gifs that end too soon :(
I did that but it was the '80s and all I had was a yardstick - none of this fancy pants glowy sound making light sword from space.

We used our imagination, and we liked it!
I only found out a couple weeks ago they were making drones.
I had better attendance than one of my professors, and I was out of town for two weeks in the middle of the semester.
I'd stretch it out, give it more story.

All my life I'd wanted to be an organ donor and then cremated. I've thought about it and I could see myself in one of those.
Runners should have to touch the ground at least every 10' or some other arbitrary length that doesn't prevent awesome tag avoiding acrobatics.

I somehow got myself into a saved position on Oni where I couldn't go back and get more guns/ammo/healthpoints, and I couldn't proceed because the baddies around the corner killed me before I could get a shot off. It was depressing :(

I started watching Ascension on Netflix and quickly said "artificial gravity!?! that should be some rotating cylinder ship or something!" By the third episode (??) "ooohhhh ..."

It's an OK show - shame it got canceled.
That's fucked up.

Also if you buy a house, reset all the garage door openers (the motors, not the remotes).
I don't know if that's CrossFit or not, but my wife and I were watching that Netflix BeastMaster show and a CrossFit guy gets up. Immediately my wife says something like "that dude is big he's going to do well!" and I said, "nah, he's CrossFit. This will end badly." He didn't make it past the first round.
I think it shouldn't remove the 15 seconds, just the rope fuse. In the case of Nozdormu they'd still get 15 seconds but no countdown timer.
It's always nice to see some original work here.
Didn't shit my pants!
Let's just pretend for a moment that I could actually get something like that off the ground. The part where she drops it and bends over to stabilize it is exactly when I'd take the bar right in the teeth.
They should do this everywhere with go karts. Make a small city scene that's like 1/4 sized and put little cars on it. It'd probably go horribly wrong, but it'd be fun.
No, but [I do have some grapes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtN1YnoL46Q).
I don't think I've ever seen Jello that opaque.
I asked Google to do something one time and after it completed it I said thank you and it said you're welcome.

What a strange place - it's like an unfinished resort or something.
It looks like a very repetitive build.
I'd be tempted to stack something like cardboard boxes to appear as though they're holding it up.
Jigsaws are not quiet. How do you not wakeup to that?
The first time I took my dog to the vet for a checkup they were trying to inspect his feet and he went into a death roll. It was hilarious. They called him a furry gator.
Has Chun Li always had those crazy bracelets? For some reason I don't remember them in early StreetFighter games.
You've got columns and glass cabinets in your first place!?!
Yeah I feel violated.
:(
Perhaps of Italian descent. Why do you ask?
/u/stabbot could you do another one for me today?
You're the bestest!
/u/stabbot fix this for us!
I trained a guy to replace me at my first job and he referred to every port on the computer as a "skuzzy port" (common pronunciation of the SCSI acronym). Everything was SCSI to him. He didn't differentiate between parallel, serial, SCSI, ADB, VGA, DVI, printer, ethernet, modem, USB ... none of it. Everything was "skuzzy". I think the only thing he identified as being different was the power cable.

I told our boss about this revelation and her reaction was, "Well ... shit." He didn't last long.
That cat is on some serious drugs.
Wow that's crazy!
So the eyebrow grooming - women have been doing this for a long time, eh?
I'm with grandma on this one.
