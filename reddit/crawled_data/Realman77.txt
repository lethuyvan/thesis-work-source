Now that’s a sentence I would not have thought anybody would say 2 weeks ago
Well carbine and omega are pretty good, amazing with the armor pieces
Yeah the ARs were nerfed too far and the UMP9 was buffed too far

Literally all the ARs needed was like a small Tactical Stock nerf for M4, small recoil nerf for M4 (2-3%) and damage drop off past like 200-300m

UMP9 should have gotten less recoil or more damage, not both

Everything else is good though
Well every time I dropped there until recently it was only my squad and MAYBE one other, I've noticed its now a hot drop recently
Ugh why can’t it be brown for Miramar and green for Erangel and savage

It’s the same game, just 2 different game modes

Also let’s face it at least 80% of players are doing BR
Well BR Players are fine with STW loading screen tips for the start of the game, so I don’t see why the atmospheric loading would be an issue?
I have literally no idea how it happened and it was relatively close range too but I hit for 1 damage once

Well I’d rather they buff the AUG to have less recoil and more damage and the MK14 for less recoil, it has too much non-prone imo

Also nerf M4 recoil *slightly*

Also noise is extremely important gun noises have different layers of sound, watch WackyJacky101 in youtube it really helps for learning Pubg

Set to full auto and get very close or snipe from afar

Level 1 helmets so no issue with sniping
Battlefield sounds exactly up your alley, maybe Arma depending on how realistic you want it to be. Squad would also be worth looking at
I have 200 hours and only got back my money because I got lucky and opened a cropped corset out of a fever crate first try 
Sometimes I feel like I can barely hear guns and footsteps go crunch, died today because I could barely hear an M16 going off

It’s fixed with removing loudness equalization but that makes guns stupidly loud
It’s completely useless in general outside of sniper scope until you get something better

Zooms too much for AR

Barely redeems itself on sniper and sometimes better off with iron because it can zero (which is only good with iron)
That is extremely and obviously blue
I had that once, I don’t know what the cause is
Thank
Well I know but who in their right mind wouldn’t just play the tiers through outside of the ones you get from the more expensive battle pass 

That’s like 160$ for battle pass and all tiers lol
An M249 eh, but an AK or M4 would be easy to pick up from gaming, yeah
Wait it’s that much for a SINGLE TIER?

I don’t have the battle pass but who tf would spend that much money on a game
The AUG needs less recoil and then it will be worthy of a crate
Agreed for aug and mk14, but Groza is too OP for world spawn imo 
That would be too similar to miramar
I hated prison because it was basically split in half due to the cliff, but liked the one that was literally on the mountain near Georgopol

If you listen to the gun sounds it’s actually 3 separate sounds that REALLY help to show where it’s coming from

The actual sound: general direction

The whiz: from which side of head it’s from

The impact: general direction

Also look for muzzle flashes and irregularities in the terrain

I have literally never had a snow day and if there was one here the climates completely fucked and the world is ending

Had a flood day once so that’s nice
Holy shit where is this and is it with peeps at the store or randoms as enemies
Fuck no my luck is either really good or complete shit

ie: get a 50$ skin from PUBG with a 0.3% chance first go, then have some random complete bullshit happen
Nice now you can’t post on /r/me_irl
I love thinking about things that don’t exist
No devils lettuce in my Christian subreddit
Don’t worry, fictional is more interesting anyway
Spanish 4 and Honors Geometry

Spanish 4: the teacher is nice, but none of my friends are in the class and I’ve fallen so far behind I study only what I need for tests and I get an alright grade but I feel really far behind
I also do bad on oral assessments because I naturally stutter and skip when talking fast or for long periods of time

Honors Geometry: Fuck Geometry I’ve always had trouble with visual stuff like shapes, worst part is I don’t even get the honors grade boost with it and I need to do good to get into Honors Advanced Algebra, which I am actually good at
This new map reminds me of Subnautica and Far Cry 3, it’s great
A chemical
That’s a shit GPU and CPU
I actually like this as an emote idea
I was expecting Savage to be between 15-20 min a round
Well imo the game feels a bit slow despite all the action, it takes a similar amount of time to Miramar and Erangel despite the action because of the slow circles. At least lower time between
I keep getting killed by BS on this map, it doesn't play like Erangel or Miramar for sure. I'd say it needs faster first and second circle
IMO the circle is way too slow, it should be twice as fast for the first and second but the others are fine
its beautiful but way too much action and the circles move stupidly slow
Servers busy
*laughs in 300 mbps*
Spring break is next week for me
And then get banned from steam
Or just no teamkilling
Bloody Mess: Get a headshot with an AWM
One-Man Army: Win alone in a squad game

The majority of people here use FPP, it’s a fact

Also Chinese are people too
Yeah on Erangel death is usually from bullshit, on Miramar it’s from being out skilled
Those surveys are biased due to being on the subreddit.

Also I know for a fact China is a majority of the playerbase and does TPP near exclusively
Just because some like 75% of the playerbase prefers TPP doesn’t mean there should be a lock

I mean, it’s not like FPP servers are suffering at all from playerbase issues
Jeez FPP lock is bad enough, with solo only I won’t even bother
My only two wins are on Miramar

I also prefer Miramar to Erangel
I would assume Erangel

Middle loot Lake is like one of my friends go to for landing, I don’t get it like 75% the time we land there.

I usually push Salty or Shifty
Doesn’t matter the level of helmet if you have no ammo
April Fools, normie text memes only
Nah, they are way too common, I’d say twice as rare so only like 5-6 go off in an entire game

Also have them spawn everywhere and not just in the shacks
It’s only in the Flare Gun event
“Hang on let me get my calculator”
I’m not on spring break and it’s me but with PUBG
OC memes
Bush too thanks
That won’t make sense if you’re knocked though 
I’d honestly rather have an M24, more ammo
Reason you think that is because you have the same MMR as a new player when trying out TPP. After a while it balances and becomes normal

(Source: TPP player)
It’s got too much recoil when crouching and is only good prone (but is amazing prone)

It’s the worst crate gun imo but since they are all amazing that doesn’t mean it’s bad AT ALL
Yeah, but not worth a secondary slot
Sell and buy what you want with the money you get from the crate
Uh, I got a beige SKS

The SKS is beige anyway to begin with


Why would you use the VSS at 400 meters
Even if you are lucky enough to hit in the first place, like no damage due to damage falloff
Remove it and replace it with a 3 seater buggy
Or in the covered haybale storage
I don’t know, but it happens to the person who runs the server and plays on the same system
[FOR THE UNAWARE, IT IS ALCHEMIST NPC]
I figured it out. It’s Alchemist NPC.
Well make it so it puts you at a bandage amount of HP so if you are AFK you aren’t fucked
I found 1 in the outskirts of Hacienda on the haybales
I don’t have the VBucks
Ours had an AUG and MK14
Not overkill for 1440p 144fps
Yeah I hate when that happens, thought it was only me and my squad
I got killed by a guy named chang878378474
One headshotted me with iron sight Kar98k while driving at 110 kmh 

Not exact numbers but close
(This was today)
I actually want Dab so that would be amazing
False, it’s working for me on latest driver
The way I did it was go to Control Panel Uninstall and delete everything NVIDIA but the GeForce experience

After that I reinstalled the drivers
Like 85% of the playerbase does 3rd person

Considering that a majority is Chinese and all play TPP that’s already over 50%

And the majority of other countries also play TPP
Well that’s not obscure at all...
False, I got one on the stacked covered haybales at Hacienda. 
I’m not sure if it was a glitch, also no wonder so many people go to graveyard if each little thing there has a chance for the flare
It would be better if it was 90% death instead of 90% survival so people actually go around and so people blame themselves instead of RNG if you die there


I played 3 and found one in hacienda

On top of the hay bales that are covered

Nobody was there
Why are you buying games from Newegg 
Damnit I got a 1080 Ti in November

But it’s not like performance is going to lower just because a new gen came out
Oh no.

It’s retarded.
No
I’m using a 1080 Ti, if I go to 60 something’s very wrong
At least it’s valuable 
I did survive, it started as a 4 man but 2 died in the really early game
What about... payable bug fixes and QoL stuff

Random in paid FIXER crates, optimization has a 0.01% drop
Don’t doubt the P18C that thing is amazing at CQC
The Uzi is complete garbage for me but the enemies ABSOLUTELY shred me in close range with it

I’m way better with Kar98k at range, probably my best gun
It just sort of comes with practice

What helps is those “find the sniper” pictures, as long as they aren’t too OP

Look for the silhouette or helmet, not the other parts
Here’s a tip: git gud with snipers (at least the Kar98k)

That thing comprises of like 75% of my kills in the top 15
It took me and my squad 100 hours to win, and I didn’t survive, 130 for one where I lived (which was ironically a 2 man squad as the other 2 were being dumbasses and ran themselves over). Extremely exhilarating having only 2 in a squad match and winning.
To be fair I proned next to a dead guy once and a duo ran by me, and I got up and killed them both 
Will Floatplane have LinusCatTips on it? More importantly, does it in the first place?
What’s the next Super Fun for April Fools? This gonna be good
When GTA IV mobile port

I mean we have PUBG now on mobile so it’s possible for sure
The only salvation is that’s the only paid crate and first I’ve ever opened in a game
Yeah I prefer Miramar too because I find it difficult to see enemies near trees and I like to use the rocks and terrain as cover
From my programming knowledge, female penis size is null and not 0
Jeez I’m surprised a 660 can run 1080 40-50 it at all
Get a new PC, jeez if it’s that bad and all

My friend does perfectly on his 1060 and 16 GB RAM

I do amazingly on my 1080 Ti but I don’t count that

My friends on 1050 Tis and 960Ms don’t complain much
It’s the opposite for me... do really well on desert and get flattened on Erangel. I think it’s what you use for cover and enemy visibility, I stick behind mountains and trenches on Miramar 
Yes
Everyone else is tradelocked until Tuesday at least, don’t worry
Expect like 10-15$

Sell it ASAP, time only brings it down

My 0.6% cropped corset gave me 50$

If you sell first though you can set the future price :)
God damnit I could have gotten a CSGO karambit with those rates but I got a 50$ Cropped Corset from a fever crate
There is a guest mode on PUBG mobile to be fair, but if it was Facebook only I would be out, and in saying this as someone who has 150+ hours in PUBG on PC
Finally something helpful jeez
One time my UPS guy came up and searched the truck and said “I don’t have the package”

This was for an 800$ GPU

It took 2 more days to get it, thought it was lost in transit for a while
Nevermind, I fixed it with windowed full screen. I have like 8 more errors with WiFi and whatnot for a friend though so ouch
And I hope your fucking computer ignites

BE QUIET BEFORE THEY HEAR YOU
Well the really bright guns are rare so it’s not that bD
Why the fuck would anyone vote optimization, it’s good enough now
Well orange gives you an advantage if the enemy has them and the others look nice imo
At least those are a joke
I downloaded that driver, it didn’t fix anything. 
Smoke trap. Stepping deploys a lot of tactical smoke
That would be a good crate attachment, as well as range finder

(For the unaware, straight pull allows you to bolt the rifle without leaving scope)
I get this but only for like 0.25-0.5 seconds tops and it usually comes in as I land

8700k 1080 Ti 16GB 3000 MHZ 300 mbit connection
Not virtually, it’s literally an AR-15 but slightly different
Miramar is actually 50/50, people have tested it.
I’d say new maps and new game modes and new guns
We are all player unknown on this blessed day

Let’s fix it ourselves
The AUG is absolutely amazing at medium-long range, it shreds people like nothing else... keep it a crate item it’s way too OP for a world spawn
AUG is god

Best AR, take at all costs
“You must use a supported game”

Wow thanks much help 
Yeah, just click Alt+Shift+Left Click on the gun to toggle, appears on the menu so it isn’t that bad
I, uh, bought one fever crate key

Got a cropped corset

I’m not touching crates again
That’s not that bad considering hard drives are like 1 TB for 30$
I don’t see level 3 helmets much and if they are there I coordinate with my squad to two shot them
Well they usually use first aids so they are at 75 and I always one shot them, most people use level 2 tbh
Legit always drop Militar given the option

If not, Pozo or Leones, aim for the really good concrete buildings 
Are you me? But replace azahar with militar
The AUG is a monster, when I get it I’m basically on a rampage and get over 3-5 kills

Groza is amazing but I’ve gotten it but never used it long enough to see, only got it one game and didn’t even use it much, but from my 1 kill its not as good as AUG at range 
Uh, one of my friends who got PUBG FOR SURE after EA have the shirt
Yeah M24 > AWM because I’ve never been in a situation late game where someone has a level 3 helmet and max HP, and it’s way better to use easy to get 7.62 so if you miss you don’t stress out
AUG > Groza. Change my mind.
don’t diss the AUG. that thing is god tier, gave it to a friend that’s average and he got 5 kills with it

Can confirm, no issue and I use 1080 Ti
But you have the guilt of indirectly killing 99 people every flight
Miramar. Erangel is stale and it’s hard to see enemies on it

Also gg if you want to see the crate smoke
I actually don’t have much backlight bleed, if at all. I think it’s luck-based or they fixed it or something 
Well that’s if I could get it to work

“Unsupported game” my ass
Especially on Ernagel where the players blend into the green. On  Miramar they stick out at least a little which is why I prefer Miramar (also all my wins are on Miramar)
Enemies loot in a nutshell
Yes I have both 1440p and 144hz AND IPS in my monitor
And iOS and soon Android 
I got mine in late November for 800, I could have gone cheaper but this one has hybrid cooling. Then literally a month later it spikes like crazy to 2k+
Any person from the north bay better know how to get there without signs
**TACTICAL NUKE INBOUND**

Literally all they need to do is get a 25 killstreak and they could flatten anything 
4 Fortnite BR players with different skins vs the enemies in John Wick

Considering one of the skins is literally John Wick this shouldn’t be an issue
No, that means somebody got to it before you
Yeah trios would be amazing 

Just have it be 99 instead of 100 people, not a big deal at all

120 is best for a Battle Royale as it fits all the configs but whatever
Just check if it’s on auto, it takes like a quarter of a second
Also saying “weapons to auto” to your squad before rushing in is just badass as well as useful

Calamity is an amazing mod, my favorite actually, with an amazing OST, boss design, and post-moon lord stuff but the creator always seemed like a bit of a dick to me
The summer sale is also 5 bucks and guaranteed no scam

Also supports the devs if that’s your thing
I use a G-Sync monitor (1440p 144hz IPS), haven’t seen a single tear since I got the computer in December

Minimal stuttering but that’s probably the 1080 Ti

Am I the only one who prefers Miramar over Erangel? I find it near impossible to spot enemies on erangel and I like the terrain based gameplay more on miramar
I just won a squad game like that but I was on the 2 and the other guys shot each other and I head shotted the last guy because he was almost dead
I had a guy literally named qq followed by a spam of numbers snap to my head with a VSS and kill me when I had an M4 and Kar, was so salty

R1: Terraria guy just flattens Steve with a SDMG and chlorophyte ammo. Use vortex armor for good measure. Literally nothing can stop an extremely powerful mini gun with OP homing bullets

R2: It’s also a flattening, but less extreme. Terraria guy can use Water Bolt, Phoenix Blaster, and Nights Edge while Minecraft guy has an iron sword at best
R1: just did a FO4 unarmed run, so that

Are you jailbroken? Epic really dropped the ball with jailbreak detection here, but some devs are working on a bypass
I’m really disappointed by the jailbreak detection...

Come on epic you’re not stopping hackers just being dicks for no reason

You can side load .ipa files if you wanted to hack with an unjailbroken device
Well, prepare for a speech on the PUBG Steam Market

So, you buy crates and open them
You can get stuff
If you are lucky you can get valuable stuff that looks the exact same as the non valuable stuff

Yes 
I got it and now it doesn’t even run, just crashes on the logo
I’m using a compatible device
A N G E R Y
Hey, better than standing around doing nothing
I’m on iOS 11, 10.7 is screen size
y tho :(
Yeah for sure. Just inject code into fortnite.ipa and then sideload it onto the device... isn't doing anything but fucking over a portion of their userbase
No, works perfectly on my unjailbroken 7
well Fortnite is infinitely more popular than Animal Crossing, so yeah
yes, with Electra
iPad Pro 10.7 2017
well cheats aren't really that popular, especially on ios with jailbreak. if anything, PC would be the one with the most cheat prevention. Just put on an anticheat like most games on ios

This is on an iPad Pro 2017 so no way it's incompatible

Well yeah but if blue hole were to shut the market off before the 7 day cooldown on sales ended for our items we would be rightfully angry. I don’t know, we can’t bring it down at this point. Only way is to try slowly increasing drop chances of rare items to flood the market and then kill it once there’s nothing valuable?
On top of that being hilariously stupid, it’s also just proving their self defense point (not assuming that they would have a CCW in the first place)

I’ve gotten 50k before on a post
Just say no u afterwards 
My school said while they don’t endorse it they aren’t going to try to stop it and they won’t punish if it’s not insanely long or anything

If PUBG can run on a phone Fortnite shouldn’t be an issue

Also Fortnite on iPad would be legit amazing
Wtf, in 30 I’d die attempting that... nothing below 50
30 degrees is gloves weather, hell even 45 is at times

My hands like to freeze and go numb
Haha even in California where she’s from it’s like 95 around 1 PM in summer
Brr fits around 40-45, Hot! should be 90+
Don’t forget the North Bay like Marin and Sonoma and Napa
But what’s the point then
Jeez that’s thick level cold
Well no, I meant a lot of damage
Slightly OP plz nerf
Well unless they have shit or no skins, which a lot of people probably would 
I once got 5.5k upvotes, feltgoodman
Do a GTA and have it so you have to time your jump onto the train

Or maybe have it stop at only some POIs
That would be more badass than disappointing tbh
Yeah, same story here. Flattened a black knight with gold scar with an epic suppressed pistol. Thing has a serious punch
You hold control + mouse wheel
But I never felt the need to do it

Big if true
well there are both
also I dont know
TBH on the road map they said it wasn't esports ready at all
There's sometimes a glitch where spectating looks like one gun but fires like another. Most likely not a hack
i can't disagree
Fair enough, how about make it 10% of the population? Now that would be real interesting...
Or perhaps have the “odd” guy be born after hundreds of years of the same person, have him revered as a god or executed?
To regulate guns further and almost ignores the aspect that people do bad things when they are mentally ill
I don’t agree with conservatives because they spout this and don’t do anything about mental health just to keep their guns, but we actually need to invest in more mental facilities, therapists, counselors, and more stuff like that
And one day it fails and one person is born “different”
OCD
Clearly an infinite loop bug in the brain’s thinking process
It’s EXTREMELY loud but obviously from inside the head and not from around when I have it
Oh. Well I guess the best bet is to talk to your mom about this and maybe get the counselor thing going
Well, I have no idea what to say other than the fact that some days I feel like doing nothing. Is this a thing that’s been going on for a while or just a few days to a week
I think your girlfriend would be the best person to talk to, but you probably know her better than me, so you can do the decision on that one. Have you considered getting a hobby or going to a club?
Use an Anti-Anti Adblocker like Reek from uBlock Origin
This sounds a bit like depression. You should talk to a friend or something

If you do things you need to do now, then you can get on Reddit sooner and guilt-free when you’re done

If this is homework anyway, I’m being serious

Edit: if this isn’t homework, there’s a lot of things out there to do, people to meet. Also reddit isn’t bad on its own, only bad when overused

Is this why you’re so smart
But you have to be really smart to do the thing that makes you really smart, so only smart people can get really smart
Oh no
Oh yeah forgot about balance changes

Under launch pad is decent based on if you’re lucky with the circle
It’s more don’t mix other mods and Calamity

Calamity is best imo but still do a calamity run or other mods like thorium run

Too many cooks ruin the soup
I think the Profaned things would need more rock like the Profaned Guardians and Providence

Where’s star stealing, hidden block with star, and bullshit bonus stars at the end in Mario Party
Well even when I’m not bottoming them out they are still way too loud for the average office environment and when I bottom the switches out it’s insanely noisy
1080 ti begs to differ

Well tbh a car below 10k is borderline dangerous at times
It literally never snows where I live so I’ve never heard of that site
But it does flood very often so moderate-heavy rain the night before (6-7 hours) and I’m out of class
Wait 50 cents for a tide pod
Used to have that but it goes away after a while and Minecraft can be played again. Took me 3 ish years
No officer, it’s “hi, how are you?”
I pretty much have full bars all the time 🤔
It was a tiny speck, not a full beard. Hard to notice unless you have a high res display, which I am using

I asked and the first thing for Miramar was Hacienda del Patrón. “Good luck”
This is why I use the G900
While I admit to faking some in the past, this one was actually legit
Well in the game there is a full auto pistol called the P18C, kind of rare. As for the play zone, that’s strange
No, but I can levitate up the stairs
One of my windows doesn’t have blinds, so there’s that. Also the issue is me being barely conscious and not acknowledging the alarm
I will stay asleep with a calm one, can’t train myself to do something when I’m unconscious
Eh I need a borderline 12 gauge blast or two to get me up

Idea: wire a shotgun to an alarm, have it shoot out the window when I need to wake up

That’s my monitor! It’s great, keep in mind the red “feet” are more of a metallic red over a bright cherry red like in photos and isn’t that big a deal. Don’t forget to calibrate it (windows calibration worked the best for me) and make sure to turn off the annoying standby light in the OSD.
400 dpi is best dpi anyway
Not OP, but I went for a 27 in IPS Acer Predator
Seriously that mouse cramps my hands REALLY bad. It’s too small, and is WAY too low. Also obvious shit charger position. At least it looks nice amirite
Dear EA: can I have /u/leoleosuper ‘s Origin account? Thanks
Turkey twizzlers? That sounds horrible
“Four-chahn” would be worse
If the aliens are using something more advanced than SMS (at least I hope so) they will keep sending until it pushes through

It’s super effective!
Yeah, I’m doing it pretty well with a 1080 Ti and 8700k. Anything less is painful tbh

I didn’t switch at first because of the other features of iMessage, and FaceTime. But I realized those weren’t big deals. I literally never considered the color of my texts
Wow scary different colored texts
My personal sniper preference

SKS > Mini14 > M4 > M16 > VSS > Kar98k

I can never hit with bolt action snipers, seriously it’s horrible. Wreck with semi auto snipers though
For me server maintainence is right after I get home, at 6 PM-9 PM. We get the worst end of the deal in PST
Holy crap thank you for getting to the point
Seriously, it’s delicious and amazing!
Odyssey gave me more of a Galaxy nostalgia than Mario 64, though that might be because I grew up with Galaxy instead of 64.

I’m using that
That’s how it should have been, maybe call it an energy overdrive. Have it be slow but steady
It depends a lot. Most of the time I hide and watch them and bait 1-2 squad members with the downed person
Save until final circles and camp :)
