I've checked and those tickets are still valid, so I'm assuming that this year's tickets will be the same. Then we'll have four four day tickets available for the future.

It's an old riddle:

A man lives on the 10th floor of an apartment building. Every morning he takes the elevator all the way down to the bottom and goes to work. In the evening, when he comes back from work, he gets into the elevator, and if there is someone else in it, he goes back to the 10th floor. On rainy days he also goes directly to his floor. On all other days, he goes to the 7th floor and walks up 3 flights of stairs to his apartment. Why?
Short people can go to the 10th floor, but only when it's raining.

I work in a lab. I always had trouble with corded headphones because the polyester lab coats would rub against the cord and build up a static charge and eventually discharge in my ears which wasn't comfortable.

I switched to wired Bluetooth earbuds which eliminated the static problem, but the cord hanging behind my neck would get stuck by the collar of the lab coat behind my neck and would tug whenever I turned my head.

The AirPods are fantastic. They solve both issues for me, and even though they don't have the greatest quality of sound, they're still decent enough for what I use them for.

Same here! They used to have one in the Kenosha store that would direct your groceries to one of three bagging areas so the next couple of people in line could start scanning their items without having to wait for you to finish bagging yours.

If was a new fridge. I let my kids put in the shelves and I didn't double check. I didn't even notice when I put the pan in.
Also paper placemats with a map of Italy highlighting major cities. 
Thanks. I also just watched the iDevices installation video and they mention that you need to have a smart switch on both ends for the light to work properly.
It would be "compatible" with them in that they would dim with the dimmer switch, but they'd be dimming because their supplied power is being reduced, not because of the dimming ability of the Hue bulbs.

I would think that having this installed would negate the need to have Hue bulbs on the connected light fixture.
Here's a question: The lights over my kitchen table have two switches: A regular on/off switch by one door and a dimmer by the other.

Could I even use this dimmer in this situation? If I were to turn the lights off with the on/off switch, would the iDevices dimmer lose track of whether the lights were on or off?
I've been happy with my iDevices switches and outdoor switch, but ouch, that price.
We may never lose again!
That's how I did it as well.
I'm thinking the plan is going to go all to shit, except the Hound will be the one killed, reanimated, and brought back to King's Landing.

Not only will it be someone that Cersei recognizes, but you could then have Zombie Mountain vs. Undead Hound.

I got up to 50 million coins before I got bored and decided to start spending. I blew the whole wad going from 85 to 90 for everything.

You underestimate the American ability to complain about stupid shit.
I just got my final K2SO to bring him to L6. I had been playing with L6 Han the whole time; didn't realize until a couple of days ago that I should have been using Chewie. 
Yep. Happened at Whispering Straits in Kohler, WI. 
I'm assuming that at this point, Line has pulled the plug on K2-SO? I've played over 100 games today and have gotten nothing but boost tickets and coin awards in capsules. 

It's killing me because I only need three more for L6...
We did it once just to say that we did it. I think it was a lot more enjoyable because we met a group of cast members/Universal employees at La Cava who helped us chart out a beverage pathway. I never would have found Tipsy Ducks in Love without them!

We had a blast at DL over Easter. Doing fast passes the old fashioned way was fun, and I think we got more rides out of it than we would have with MDE. It was also fun going on some of the rides that have been pulled from WDW and some that never made it over to the east coast. DL was a lot cozier with smaller pathways and more trees than MK. 

It was interesting seeing the crowds; instead of 99% vacationers, it was about 75% locals who seem to have a lot of fun dressing up for a day or evening at Disney. 

It was really neat having everything so close together. We stayed at GCV and were able to quickly run to the room and back to change as the temperatures changed throughout the day. Not having to waste two hours of the day sitting on busses was a blessing. 

World of Color is the best show of the six US parks, and Cars Land is the best themed. It was fun seeing MSEP again, although I kind of wish we could have seen Paint the Night. We six get [these](https://imgur.com/a/8EyIS)  though!

Also, DL Pirates > MK Pirates. And Blue Bayou was amazing. 
It is. Also, not jail broken or anything like that. 
As a WDWer who just got back from a three day trip to DL, it's a yes from me. While a segment of DCA looks a bit like HS, the rest of the park with Cars Land, Paradise Pier, etc. are a nice change from what's at WDW. 
I have kids in high school and I can vouch for the fact that this is still a thing. 
I'm just at L5, but I haven't gotten a single K2-SO in four days now, so the likelihood of maxing out is slim.
I live in Wisconsin and work in Illinois. I bought cookies from people in both states and the WI cookies came from one baker and the IL from the other. Besides the different names for some of the cookies, there was a definite difference in taste and appearance between the two.

They're building a new 8000 seat arena which will serve mostly for cheerleading competitions. I think they're also building a new parking lot and a separate entrance for the venue. 
We make a stop at Colombia Harbour House every trip. Get an upstairs table with a view of the street below for a nice break from the crowds. 
During last year's Star Wars event, I ended up with almost 20 skill tickets and used the "Iron Will" approach and saved then to upgrade Beast to L6 all at once. Now I just use them to make the jump to L5 for tsums I use that are one away but I don't want to rely on luck (or time) for getting them.

TIL I went to Disneyland one week too early.
Very nice! I love your Haunted Mansion, too!
Just got back from there; we were able to get a 1BR at the seven month mark for a stay starting Easter Sunday. I was on the phone in the morning although I never went back to check if that was necessary or not. 
Search on YouTube for the Christmas show they did with drones at Disney Springs last winter. Speculation is high that it was a proof of concept for future shows.

The full sized ones are always there. It took me two trips before I got the Magic Kingdom mini mug. 
We popped into Trader Sam's, but it was too crowded and we were too hungry to wait for a table for five to open up. Next time, I think I'll just leave the kids in the park and go there with my wife only. 
The hotel was one of the "Good Neighbor" hotels across the street. It was about a ten minute walk from the gates. 
We went into ToonTown just to take a peek. Also easily better that MK. I kind of wish my kids were five again so I could turn them loose. 
Either that or drones. 
We only had enough points for two nights at GCV and were planning on driving down to San Diego the next day without going into the parks. The Fairfield was a tenth of the price of another night in our room paying cash. 

Usually on our WDW trips we fly out the last day so only get a partial day in the parks, so getting to stay for a full day on the final day was new and nice.

Oh yeah, I forgot about the app. So there you go. OP just needs to make sure to keep checking, because FPs were gone by 12:15 today.
If you want to get a FP for the evening, your only option is to walk by every now and then and see what the current return time is and get them when it's within the window you want. 

Just remember to make sure that when you get your passes, you're not blocked out because you have a pending pass for a different ride and haven't waited two hours yet. 
If I remember, the cost difference between the $500 card and the pack of three $50 cards was only something like an extra 1¬¢ per dollar, but with $5000 worth of cards, it's like a free meal, and it does make the cards easier to manage. 
I just bought (about two weeks ago) a $500 card at Sam's, so they're still there.

With the current technology, long-haul flights aren't tracked for 100% of the trip so if a plane is lost over the ocean, we can only guess at where to look based on its flight path. If it went off course and the pilot didn't notify anyone, searchers would never know that they're looking in the wrong place. 
A lot of this graffiti seems like a proto-Facebook detailing what they were doing at the time and where, as well as tagging people to embarrass them.

We're doing our first trip as well (20 days!)

1. From what I can tell, ADRs at DL are not quite the same as WDW because of the lack of My Disney Experience.
When you make a reservation for four at WDW, they let you identify each of the four guests so the reservation appears on everyone's individual plans. At DL, since MDE doesn't exist, you won't have that option even though you create the reservation using the same account that you use for MDE. 

2. We're planning on those two, as well as Storyteller's for the breakfast buffet.

3. We're doing the Blue Bayou dinner package for he parade. At WDW, I've done the Brown Derby package for Fantasmic and the Tiffin's plan for the now-extinct Jungle Book show. I think they were both worth it because between the appetizer meal and dessert, we easily covered the cost of the prix fixe menu.

At work they renovated the bathrooms and installed [these pieces of shit](http://www.dyson.com/mobile/airblade/airblade-tap).

The only way to avoid it is to wash in one sink and hope the one next to it is dry enough to avoid getting soaked.

We went to go see Hoop de Doo one evening. The next day we went to MK and were greeted by the Mayor of Main Street. Something seemed strangely familiar, then we realized that he was one of the cast from the previous evening's show.

I asked him if he had a twin, and he knew immediately that I recognized him, but without missing a beat, he went into a spiel about his twin brother who never amounted to anything and that the family really doesn't speak of him.

I told him that if he ever sees his "brother" again, to pass on the message that I thought he was talented and that we really enjoyed his show which got a nice smile out of him.

Napa Rose looks fantastic, but probably not someplace that I'd take the kids. Might be someplace that we'd try as a couple depending on how the day goes and if there's a table available at the last minute.

Looking at the menus and descriptions, Carthay Circle looks a little comparable to Brown Derby at Hollywood Studios which is a great place to eat. $$$ Prices seem to be on a par with each other as well.

Watching the boats go by at Blue Bayou is something that WDW doesn't have anything comparable to, so that might have to go on the "must do" list.
Funny, because reading the reviews for that is what finally prompted me to post here.

That was it. Opened Clover Configurator and installed EmuVariableUefi from the Drivers UEFI 64 Bit selections. Reselected the Nvidia drivers from the preference pane, rebooted and everything now works as expected. Thanks!
I went through all the settings and didn't see anything that struck me as odd; all the recommended settings were still set.

Edit: Looked up the BIOS change log and of course... "This BIOS prohibits updating to earlier version BIOS"
I believe if you go into the App Store preference pane, you can set macOS to not check for updates at all.

I'm positive that you weren't expecting such a negative reaction to it though. 
My original PS3 died three years after I bought it. I was pissed losing the PS2 backwards compatibility. 
I'm f√ºhrerous at this pun.
To be honest, going into the game I was nowhere near as confident about it being a winnable game as the others during their run, so when things started to blow up I wasn't quite as stunned as if this had been against the Lions or Bears instead. Oddly, this was probably the least stressful game I've watched in awhile. I was over it by the time the game was finished.

I'd just buy an empty DVD case and trim it so it sits flush with the others on the shelf. Maybe make a fake sleeve with [this movie](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0174255/).

Yeah, but now the Packers efense has to hold back the Cowboys for 1:33.

I have faith in Rodgers; I don't have faith in McCarthy's ability to call plays late in games.
Fuck this game. Fuck Om Capers.
It's like Witten can see the yellow line on the ground.
Okay, **NOW** we need a defensive stop.
Rodgers is just setting the table for a game-winning Hail Mary.
Prevents you from winning.
Dallas has all the momentum at just the right time. That INT was a 14-point swing.

Rides will also post wait times that are orders of magnitude higher than the actual time just to subtly get people to not get into line, especially on rides where you can't see the queue and how many people are actually waiting.

Last time we were there Mine Train had a 45 minute wait posted, but the wait wasn't even ten minutes.

That's why I was very careful to make sure the bag was completely sealed to start and fully dried off before I opened it up. I would also only use vacuum sealed bags for this; I'd never try it in a zip lock using water displacement.
It might, but you wouldn't have the temperature control as detailed in the article. 
No, not at all. And the cleanup was easy. I only had the two spatulas that I used to spread on the pan. And those were mostly cleaned orally. ü§î

This is the first time I've done something in a jar. If you were canning, you'd have these underwater to boil anyway. 
Also, you can do it right in the cans. Just remove the labels first. I do it in jars so I can close them back up after eating a spoonful. 
There isn't one. It's two cans of sweetened condensed milk poured into three 8 ounce mason jars. Seal tightly and place them in the water, and set your heater to 185 degrees for 15 hours. 

The water doesn't need to be preheated, and the filled jars are so dense that they don't need to be weighted down to stay at the bottom. 
This is the first time I've tried it. I like to just eat it by the spoonful, so I wanted something reclosable.

I used two 14-oz cans (which is by weight, not volume) and divided them between three 8 ounce jars.
185 degrees for 15 hours. Easy peasy!
Yes it's possible. Source: I just did it five days ago.

Also, maybe because of this, iMessage just worked without any crazy activation process necessary.

Update:

I'm able to boot. Thanks to everyone for your help!

I hit F12 at boot to go into the boot options screen, then selected my USB drive. Back at the Clover boot screen, I selected my installed drive, hit the spacebar and selected "without caches" (or however it's worded) then booted up successfully.

I mounted the EFI partition, replaced the config.plist file with a backed up copy, and am back in business.

I'm still stuck with two problems though:

* The audio still won't work. I recreated the steps that I used previously to get it running, but it won't work a second time.

* I can't get display mirroring to work. The Displays menu icon just says "Connected TV: S271HL" (which is the model number of the monitor which is connected to the graphics card via HDMI) and "Use as separate display is checked. there aren't any other options available.
OOC, is the Indiana Jones ride at DL just Dinosaur with different theming?
I presumed that by selecting the USB stick entry from Clover that I would be booting the USB stick installer. I didn't look too hard because it was late, but is it possible to boot the installed OS using the EFI partition on the USB stick? (Disclaimer: This is my first go around at Hackintosh building)
I'm at work; I'll have to check when I get home tonight.
The first screenshot is trying to boot from the installed MacOS. The second is when I boot from the USB stick.
[The boot still errors out. ](https://imgur.com/a/a72RJ) 

The screen gets garbled when the slash symbol comes up, but the very last thing that appears is "Still waiting for root device"

Edit #2: Fixed the second image link
Well, shit.

I was able to get the graphics working properly, but somehow I managed to lose the audio again. I went through the process to re-enable that, and now I get the circle/slash on boot.
The audio fix worked like a charm. Didn't even need to reboot! I never came across that guide. [Thanks a lot!](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/066/552/whos-awesome.jpg)

They have their ups and downs. 
And that's the game! Big, big win. Nice job all around. 
They've had some big-yardage-loss sacks tonight. 
I wouldn't call it terrible, but yeah, that was a push off. 
Why did they call the timeout if they were just going to kneel it?
Wow, I was totally expecting an 11 yard completion there. 
Nah, once they got that initial first down, I knew a TD was inevitable. This defense couldn't stop a nosebleed. 
Can /u/Spock_Nipples pick a combination spoon and fork utensil for me?
Right, it just seemed odd that there wasn't someone giving him a sideways "oh crap" glance when he detected Elsie's phone signal, nor was there someone after the fact brushing their hands together saying, "Well, that's taken care of." It just kind of happened and didn't really fit in with the other storylines.
They (I guess) killed off Stubbs, but never mentioned it again. Was it just to clean up the loose end of him uncovering evidence that Elsie might not be "on leave"?
At least just watch the second half only and pretend the whole game was like that.

On the order status page, it shows the phones that I'm getting, and each is paired with the iPhone 6s or 6s+ that T-Mobile is expecting to get in return for the JoD upgrade. The phone number of each line doesn't match up with their respective IMEI numbers, so that may be an issue when I actually return them.

If you're still waiting to order and you're upgrading multiple lines, I'd suggest having the IMEI numbers handy and have the tech make sure they match each line correctly.
My ship dates through T-Mobile:

7 Matte Black 128: 9/15 to 9/16

7+ Rose Gold 128: 9/19 to 9/26

7+ Matte Black 128: 9/27 to 10/10
Got on the phone right away; tech was helpful, but the system wasn't doing her any favors. She took all my info and promised to call back once everything went through.

The orders went through around 6:30, but IMEI numbers of my family's phones didn't match up with the phones that they were getting. I tried to call back and was told that the hold time was 3+ hours. 0_o

Charlie Brown was played 1-1/4 times as they stopped and restarted when Martin apparently had guitar problems. 
I guess I'll just have to wait for the tour video to see what I missed. 
Reports are that they just cleared the stadium again. 
I think much of the crowd knew that more weather was coming in, and there was a cheer when the announcement was made. I was looking forward to seeing them though. 
Nope. We only got ASFOS because they decided to start one more even after they were told it was over. 
Show ended early. While they flashed Will up on the screen, you could see him getting the word that they were going to cut it short. They still did ASFOS although it was raining buckets by that point.

I tried it earlier this week and it works, although where a regular navigation app may reroute you based on traffic, this has no idea where the crowds are, so it may route you through the Hub while people are staking out spits for Wishes, when a different route may actually take less time. 
So if you're trying to get a hard-to-book FP (i.e. Frozen) and you can't get one for early in your trip, try one of your last days.

I managed to get one on the second to last day of my recent trip which was actually 66 days out, and had no trouble finding a time early in the day. The second day of our trip, our first day at Epcot, had no Frozen FPs available at all. 
Take the bus over to AKL and eat at Sanaa. 
A win for Disney would probably be worse for them than a loss. 
That's what I was amazed at. Every time I walked by, it was only 10 or 15 minutes. 
I managed to get one for the second to last day of the trip which was 60 days +6 out, so I had first pickings. It went down during our FP window, so we came back later when it went down yet again. 
Yep, I think they're back to normal now.
It was for awhile after the French attacks. Yesterday afternoon when I reentered Magic Kingdom, I didn't have to do the metal detector, and this morning at Epcot, they were back to doing "random" screenings, although I was "randomly selected" yet again. 
Everyone who brings in a bag has to do the bag check. That hasn't changed. Security would randomly pick people and run them through the metal detector. All this is before the turnstiles. 
Right. It was mandatory bag checks for everyone, but going through the detector was random. 
You really don't even have to enter the parks if you really wanted to cause havoc here. There's no screening for the monorail, the ferry, busses, etc.
We were here for EMH at 8:00 so it wasn't so bad. Can't imagine what it'll be like later. 
Same here except replace "50" with "90". 
I don't see the show returning to the Vale again for any reason, other than maybe to show the White Walkers not giving two shits about the Bloody Gate. 

FWIW, I also don't see the show going back to Meereen to see how badly Daario is fucking things up, either. 
Maybe force-quit the game and restart it?
The only time I use mine is if I'm at a really high score at the end of a game, and the board shows that I can start another fever and use my skill again to extend that score significantly higher. Otherwise I just leave them.

Wait wait wait... Just making sure I'm reading that right. If I manually accept a heart rather tap "Claim All", that person will get a heart back from me? MIND BLOWN. How have I never not known that?
We normally rope drop Soarin', then grab breakfast at Sunshine Seasons before heading over to Test Track. Now there's the option of rope dropping Frozen and heading here for breakfast instead.
I'm still sitting on card 29. I'll battle other people's star destroyers when I can, but it's becoming rarer and rarer that any show up. I'm still trying whenever I can (sitting on 14 skill tickets thanks to C3PO capsules!) but I'm probably going to finish out in a couple more days.
This is correct, and no, I couldn't find the pineapples either. 
Same here. I was thinking inside the train station somewhere, but I'm not sure.
Snowbowl? Ultimate Snowdown? Snowmageddon? Apocalypse Snow? Snowlocaust?  snOMG?

You don't wanna be snowplace else!

...or he sits back and waits for the Boltons and Starks to destroy each other, then he moves in and takes out whatever's left and claims Winterfell for his own.
I'm sure they'd love it; height requirement is 40" though. https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/epcot/test-track/
Yes, it's right at the end before you turn to the exit area. The ride stopped just before we got off, so I was able to get a good picture here.
We're going this summer and are going with the "FP each one on two different days" strategy.

If I could only do one day, I'd FP Frozen, hit Soarin' at rope drop, head over to Test Track and hope the line isn't too bad because everyone is going to the new rides, then do Frozen. 
I send them [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUGq8hIBuhQ).
It's also in a little cul-de-sac (until Avatarland opens) so unless you know it's there, the average guest probably isn't going to happen upon it by accident.
I went to the shop at Disney Springs. A little more of a selection there, but no Leicester City to be found. 
I'm currently on a 20-game no-capsule streak. Not even a "let's drop an unobtainable capsule with two seconds left on the clock" appearance.
The physical ride is identical, just the theming changed. I liked the crash test dummies version better than what's there now.

We are there for opening night of Jungle Book and got the dining package. 

[Food pics](https://imgur.com/a/Y9MXS) 

The whole fish was quite the thing to have staring back at you, but it was really well prepared and tasty. 

I fully understand that it was opening weekend, but service was still painfully slow. We got there a little early for a 5:00 ADR, and were seated at around 5:20. We didn't get out of there until almost 7:30, missing a 5:40-6:40 Dinosaur FP that we were hoping to hit the end if the window on, as well as the 7:00 Lion King show that we were planning on. 

I agree with the review: it's great for adults, but there's not a thing on there that my kids would have eaten. 
Yes. 
Haunted Mansion is correct! Bonus fake points if you know where...
Correct!
I'm at the Character Spot at Epcot as I'm typing this and they're scanning Macic Bands. 
The bread is tasty; the sauces are fantastic!
Was this just a preview? I thought it wasn't opening until June?
No. That's a luggage-only transfer and it's specifically mentioned as not being allowed: https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/guest-services/magical-express/
Thanks, Obama.

Nice speed Villar!
I was already planning on being there and Periscoping as well!
A Mickey Mouse alarm clock that I got when I went to Disneyland when I was four. It's over of the first things I remember from my childhood. My dad was involved with drum corps and we were there for a performance. I remember running across a field where his band was practicing holding it to show him what I got. 
...which is why I'm wondering if Meera and Bran are heading for the Neck. They can meet up with Howland who can clarify to Bran what he didn't  see at the Tower of Joy. And with a living Stark to follow, the Crannogmen can join the fight for Winterfell. 
I don't know... Does your pencil.make a sound that you can add an extra vowel to and construct a pun based on Hodor's name?
I've still got the one on the left, as well as an unopened six-pack of commemorative Miller Lite.
Yep, finally had success with the app about 45 minutes in. 
All the headliners, Soarin', Test Track, and Frozen were in Tier 1 this morning.
The iPhone app is working fine though; I was able to get everything I wanted through that and not via a browser.
Got 'em, but I had to use the phone app. Thanks for the heads up!
Nope. Tried for mid-July and nothing was available.
I managed to get into Jungle Book at AK on the 5/28, but I could not get a Soarin' FP for 5/29, nor could I get a Frozen FP for mid-July. First the site was saying that they were all gone, now it's not even loading pages anymore.

You vultures... ;)
Just within the past week.
Think of it this way: Suppose you're arriving on August 1st. You're allowed to make reservations between 8/1 - 8/10. Another family is arriving 7/31. Their 10-day window allows them to make reservations from 7/31 - 8/9. Follow that back for people arriving through the last week of July. That means if you're trying to make a BOG reservation on 8/2, there's a lot of guests who already had access to that date before you did.
That's what I figured as well. 
Agreed. The usual strategy is to rope drop one and FP the other, but I bet Soarin' will be more popular since it's "new" and everyone will head there first. Make the Soarin' FP, head to Test Track, and maybe even ride it twice before you have  to be at Soarin'. 
Fast pass times haven't been updated yet; I tried to move my Kilimanjaro Safari time or to the evening, but it still won't allow me to go past 5:00. 
If by "signature" you mean "requires two dining credits", then yes it is: https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2016/05/a-look-at-the-menu-for-tiffins-restaurant-nomad-lounge-opening-may-27-at-disneys-animal-kingdom/
MDE won't let you select select your original three FPs at two different parks, so you'd have to cancel all of your AK passes first.
Funny... We're just going for the weekend, and this has suddenly become the most effort I've even had to put into planning now that I've got to start jockeying around fast passes and ADRs tomorrow morning.
Buried in that story: Is all of World Showcase going to open at 9:00 rather than 11:00? Or just Norway?
So happy I'll be there next weekend!

Rivers of Light is not opening yet, but there are several nighttime attractions that will be starting: http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/travel/ct-new-disney-animal-kingdom-travel-0515-20160427-story.html
Smells like Budweiser. 
I think before a round begins, the game picks some random seed to determine how frequent the MyTsums drop. One game I'll be using skills less than ten seconds in and end up with 1500+ coins at the end, the next I'll be struggling to use my first skill before the 30 second mark and will be lucky to end up with 500. 
I'm assuming because it still says "Downtown Disney" and hasn't been updated yet to "Disney Springs".
It's at the Launch Bay in what used to be the animation walkthrough.

I was leaving the park and snapped this one after almost walking into a balloon vendor. Google enhanced it a bit and it turned out really neat. 
Dang. Thanks.
I thought there was an agreement in place that Shanghai had dibs on opening theirs before Epcot did.
I'll second the comments about larger rooms being available. I booked a double at AKL at the 11 month mark for July, and when the 7 month windows hit, I had no trouble finding a double at BLT and moving the reservation.
10 boxes, no Vader. I got 2 Sebastians and 2 Bambis though. :(
I let it go overnight. The next morning I cut it up into cubes, then put it back into the fridge until I was ready to cook them. 
That's the video that the post I linked to was based off. It worked very well. 
The second cooking put a nice crust on the cubes. 
Yes, I got the lard at a regular store. Most of it was liquefied when I took the meat out of the bag, but enough stayed with the shredded meat to bind it together during the compression stage in the fridge and to hold it together during the final cooking in the pan. When it was on the plate, it didn't taste or feel "lardy" at all. 
Made the carnitas as described here: https://m.reddit.com/r/sousvide/comments/25eq0n/sous_vide_carnitas/ They turned out fabulously and everyone loved them. I may have had a couple of sous vide converts as well!
Racine, WI: Danish Kringle. 
The reservation system will let you make a Hollywood and Vine Fantastic Package ADR between 11:00 and 7:00. Their lunch times are from 11:00-2:55, so you would get their lunch buffet between those times.
Try during Extra Magic Hours at night, about an hour after the regular park closing. Last time I was there, the sign said 50 minutes all night, but I never waited more than 15.
You were actually able to capture a moment when nobody was there? I was assuming that it was one of those long exposure tricks where anything moving would "disappear" like these: http://petapixel.com/2012/03/28/post-apocalyptic-photographs-of-major-cities-around-the-world/
According to this site, MK has ferry service to Fort Wilderness: https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/guest-services/water-transportation/
Their "official technology provider" is HP. The way the DVC site runs sometimes, I envision it's being served up by one of these: http://www.hpmuseum.org/3qs/25c3q.jpg
Pittsburgh? You'll never find a more wretched hive of scum and villainy. 
Correct!
Nope. 
I love the music in the ToT queues. 
This is what I love Periscope for. There's almost always somebody streaming something live.

I have a UK account and switch back and forth with no problem. The only weirdness is that I have to go into the music preferences and turn iCloud music sharing back on each time. 
Isn't there a sign there indicating the total number of strikeouts for the season?
Something's wrong with my feed. It shows the Brewers with 14 runs. 
I knew that would be a little too easy. 
Isn't it back near a cast member entrance?
I'll go out on a limb and say somewhere outside the Imagination Pavilion at Epcot?
Bingo!
Nope!
Could you be more specific?
Not there. 
Nope!
Thanks!
I clipped this from a larger picture since it would be really obvious otherwise.
At HS, I'd take 50's Prime Time Cafe over Hollywood and Vine, unless you really want to do the buffet. My kids loved it, especially because we had a fantastic waitress who was really in character.
cheeseheaddave; intl; -6 UTC
Ditto with whoever gets to supply the tiny bottles of shampoo. 
That's correct!
I've listened to Mouse World Radio a bit, but I don't think I've ever heard resort music there, just music from the parks.
I agree. The lines at HS will likely be 60 minutes+ by the time you get there; Toy Story will be even worse, although they'll have the third track open.

I would get to EP at rope drop and head for Soarin' first, since it'll be "new" and probably a lot more popular. Then go hit the single rider line at TT if you don't mind skipping the car design in the queue. Then wait in the standby line at Mission Space which probably won't be too bad in the AM, as everyone else will be on TT and Soarin'.

At HS, Toy Story and RnRC are in the same "tier", so you'll have to choose only one; I'd go for Toy Story. Tower of Terror is in the other tier, so you'll be able to get a FP for that, plus one other in that tier. I usually go for Star Tours.
I've never had an issue with splitting checks, be it everyone playing cash, some on a dining plan, others paying cash, etc. Just tell the waiter when you sit down and he/she asks if you're on a DP.
