VG played well BUT I'd argue it was more TNC playing poorly.

VG didn't have to fight hard for space to recover, TNC decided that after making VG use all their abilities and only losing 1 hero in the process it'd be better to give VG space and went to farm instead of storming HG.

Each member will get 750 if they win, so all of them currently have 1170 each, so if Liquid wins they will have 1920 each and 1920*3=5760.

Overall, something like the essential with fixed reception, and Dash Charge/VOOC, and better camera.

Front wise, I think Essential/Xiaomi's method is good since the lower bezel helps shift the centre of gravity lower so it's safer in general use rather than having a top bezel and no lower bezel. I don't care for the selfie camera, so either implementation (notch or hidden in bottom bezel, requiring phone to be rotated for selfies) is okay.

He's a good caster, a bit overated in my opinion. But defenitely okay to be in a finals cast! To say that he is one of the best casters etc is really exageration, he casted like 1 game in a high level LAN, you need way more to compare him to ODPixel, TobiWan or Fogged
He's always been a player that likes mobility but he hasn't picked up a blink this game, so I suppose he'd be more in sync when he buys it.

I wonder if this is going to be a core Tiny or a jebait Tiny.
At least he isn't a Legend 5 pleb unlike Team Secret's midlaner Krappa.
Mineski coach, probably training?
Probably the most hype series today?
This game is so back-and-forth although Midone is worryingly poor.
Na'Vi should have this pretty securely, possibly 2-1 at worst.
Puppey picks Pudge while SunBhie gesticulates in disbelief clutching their strat folder LOL.
Liquid has just won with LD, and RTZ is one of the best LD players. Why not?
Stop Newbee, they're already dead!

There's no way Infamous claws their way back into the match.
He only died twice, once at 7mins, another at 15mins.
You pick invoker against Carl Al-Barkawi?
He merely knows enough to be dangerous, rather than helpful.

Is 44k the largest networth lead in a pro game yet? 
Announcing their Arena of Valor team and disband of the Dota 2 division? 
This is a malamute though.
Reminds me of [this.](http://wanna-joke.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/men-womean-of-the-caitlyn-jenner.jpg)
HTC needs to do a Transparent edition. Would buy.
But they didn't fail, unlike LG's. 
Every other SD810 user (Sony, OnePlus, Microsoft, Moto, HTC, etc) didn't have that issue. Sure it's SD810's fault.
Possibly. It purportedly uses the Pixel Visual Core, but it's just accelerated instructions and should be possible on the OG Pixel, just slower. 
Err, that's just the Pixel 1 ([IMX378](https://www.xda-developers.com/sony-imx378-comprehensive-breakdown-of-the-google-pixels-sensor-and-its-features/), 1 plus over the IMX377 in the 6P). Pixel 2 is similar, adds OIS but sensor is now slightly smaller.
What? HMD is Finnish. 
>The Pixel 2 XL's shots are 9MP shooting at 16:9, meaning that I chose to shoot at 8MP on the Lumia 950 XL - I do like to match up resolutions as best possible so that I can use Rafe's fancy interactive comparator, below.


Pretty sure he was praying very hard for it to stay in 1 piece.
It sort of is though.

Take Samsung. They've done this rodeo many times before. There's reports saying "based off S6 sales, S7 sales, X, Y, Z, S8 is projected to sell ___ in the first few weeks." Then someone goes and determine how far in advance they have to start production, start distribution and shipment, and stockpiling so that launch week goes as smoothly as possible. It's a done deal. Samsung is not aiming at new market segments, nor are they new to manufacturing and distribution.

Google? They're still trying to crack the Apple/Samsung flagship market, something new. Aside from a few fanboys they have no customer and (hardware mindshare) base. They've market sentiment, focus groups, and small product studies, but anyone whose looked into the field knows that you might as well do RNG since there's a huge difference. Man proposes; heaven disposes.

They only have the Pixel 1 to look back at, and with 18:9s being the rage and your manufacturer having severe supply issues with the displays, you really just want to do a few markets really well (even then you still got a lot of OoS issues) than to do many and fuck up worldwide. (Note 7, for example.)

It's a large soak test. You do initial limited introduction into markets where you have a presence in, so you can react quickly to issues (Pixel 2 XL certainly had its fair share) by retrieving the faulty hardware and doing failure analysis, etc. 

Google's taking more control over design and the hardware, and while they can hire some of the best and plan meticulously, but a few products needs to go through the system to work out the kinks and get it going properly. 

***

Didn't expect to type a wall; TL;DR: Google has the relative hardware chops of a adolescent, and Samsung an expert, but even the expert has fucked up hugely now and then, so the adolescent plays it safe.
Salt in moderation? FeelsHypertensionMan.
They started mainly doing hardware, so they have extensive infrastructure and personnel related to distribution, unlike Microsoft or Google. That was the meaning behind them behind hardware company first, then software. 

Even then you couldn't really call them a software company since their software mostly ships solely for their hardware, unlike Microsoft or  Google that are extensively everywhere.

Samsung is similar to Apple, although their software chops are more limited.

They're gonna sell you performance arm sleeves so you can move your mouse faster!!
I was *so* disappointed during TI7 with the Slacks cospray that Gaben would appear in shopkeeper's clothes and all we got was a lousy CGI fat ass that you can bounce off from.
To be fair as much as EG is not playing well now, they came close in TI6, placing 3rd after a close series with DC.
They fucked up the in game leaderboard thing so it shows day 1 leaderboard, in which he was #155 when he calibrated at 6.3k. It never updated after that (which is why Gh is still 'unranked' in game).

Small indie company™! 
There are HDR shots, like the very first shot (test 1 - look at the rightmost edge into the first bald tree, although the writer didn't get the same framing for both since he obviously took the photos with the phones side by side, the 950 XL makes it apparent with it's DR that there's additional trees behind, but you struggle to make it out in the Pixel shot.), and the shop shot (test 8)
To be fair, Apple and Samsung are mainly hardware companies that also do software, whereas it's the other way round for Microsoft and Google.

LG has no excuse.
Oops, you're right. For those that're interested:

Yeah S-Pen takes no space.
 At this rate there won't be a game 5.

You normally do *very limited* tweaks in a live setting. 
FeelsBadMan for TFR (and other DJs doing these stuff) since all these are premixed (you wouldn't risk doing this live), and he has to tweak knobs for the duration and look actively involved.

At this point I've lost all faith in them running an actually good tournament and wouldn't put it past them to actually do that.

They then changed it again afterwards so that Immortals were really out.

I'm getting similar SOTs on OOS4 and OOS5, but mobile standby is now top. 
Never happened so far. Not a deal-breaker for me, but if you're careless then possibly. 
1) SP4 i7, no issues even when gaming (DotA 2). The 2017 model is fanless for the i3 and i5, but they have fans on the i7 model.

2) It's pretty solid and mine still looks like new. Does your friend's other items look beat up? Might be owner related issue.

3) This is true.
This Weaver is out of control.
I guess a /s was really required.
Looking forward for the Newbee - Kinguin SF2 game later.
Still better than the dude sometime back going "Too poor to donate, but you guys should" and then he preordered the Pixel 2 XL. Suuure.
They belong to the hardware vendor. People keep doing this OnePlus == Oppo thing when they don't understand anything but the bare minimum to be dangerous.

> Qualcomm Quickcharge 4.0

The [*only*](https://www.androidcentral.com/razer-phone-review) review out now that talks about charging states the following:

> For fast refills, the Razer Phone is the first (and currently only) device to use the latest Qualcomm QuickCharge 4+ standard. In casual side-by-side tests, I've found that QuickCharge 4+ isn't quite as speedy as OnePlus's Dash Charge, but at the same time, you're also filling a much larger battery. Regardless, Razer should be praised for riding the cutting edge here.
He hides behind a monicker unlike most security professionals, sensationalises his discoveries, and only targets OnePlus. Seems kinda shady.
1 gave you diretide

1 gave you the E class

Choose wisely.
That's why they took time out of a hectic Pro circuit schedule to play in a tournament they don't care about.

Seriously??
Camera blobs are from the hardware vendor.

The org is just a faceless formless entity to me.
Sony printed their logo on the screen protector and *removed your warranty* if you removed the protector. VERY DIFFERENT.
They're going to lose early, BH is for the comeback.
I knew Liquid planned for late game comeback since they picked BH instead of randoming, but still...
Lets take a vote guys: Are certain redditors *too stupid* or *too lazy* to actually watch the stream and have a fun & interesting midas mode Reddit comment section?
They randomed. I know you hate Liquid even in CS:GO, but this wasn't their fault they keep getting Drow drafts.
Anyone with a OP3/3T on OOS5 can try looking for display mode toggle? Mine is missing. Search shows it exists, but doesn't show in Dev settings.
1) Why in tarnation do we have JPG screenshots??

2) Treble for 5T?

3) Srsly JPG screenshots?

On a side note I think display mode toggle went missing after the OOS5 update, at least on my OP3.
MinD_ContRol on fire today geez.
OnePlus target market changes their phone on an annual cycle, or at least biannual. It is a fringe benefit that this comes along with huge developer support so ROM enthusiasts also pick OP. You're not their target market.

XZ1 Compact?
After so many years of Lousy Goods and boot loops, can't blame most for being cautious.
Pixel 2. 

XL is still too much display lottery now, maybe in a few months.

Essential has pretty bad reception, doubt their fw update will work well.

The only thing I will consider the OP3/3T/5/5T as not being flagship class is the camera.
Samsung is not selling 1440p 18:9 screens.

Axon 7 is a tier below OP as a product as well.

Liquid is the defending champions for Starladder. Of course you invite them.
Still better than Super super. Those 2 are just plain evil.
Is Kuro gonna spam 3+ games of Pugna again.
At this point Liquid might as well just announce their 6th player: MidOne
Pugna needs some items to not die immediately in a fight, items a pos 5 is not gonna get.
Pos 5 Pugna...???
Puppey going full invis draft giff carry Riki please.
They made many of these heroes the meta. You'd be saying this about another team if Liquid didn't win TI.
Liquid's decision making and team fight in the late game is possibly the most refined of all teams currently. Secret almost seemed to be going "oh fuck oh fuck" as Liquid dived their base.
Sonneiko definitely MVP of the match.
This match giving me TI7 Liquid vs VP G1 flashbacks. 
The closest series so far the entire tournament, although Navi is playing a lot better as a team than Secret that's sort of tilted.

I max PT first if my carry isn't retarded and dive-prone. Pretty sure the offlaners targets me for the rest of the game for that.

Max level's stun is amazing when you see the hope drain out of the offlaner's face when they try to TP away.

I think Victor was trying to say that Kuro is the core of the team, although not expressed very well.
That's great thanks!

No it doesn't work like that. The base sensor DR matters, not how many bits the sensor can output. 
When the others in the call are all circlejerking about Anal being right, you're bound to keep in check your full criticism since it's not a good feeling if they turn around and splatter on you.
Who?
It's rather 50-50: half keeps wanting to give LG a chance with personal anecdotes that their G6 and V20 hasn't bootlooped, the display can get better, etc, and the other half keeps saying it's going to be more of the same LG (and that the V20 etc are in the bootloop lawsuit).


EE is going to pick carry Magnus next and you should know it's your fault he's maxing empower first and casting it on his supports. 
Better than the guy who wrote 无尽丹田 and outright admitted the reason why there were so many "...but wait, there's more!" was solely because he can't write anything else and he wanted the money.
They need "mid" and "carry" as well.

There are 2 Chinese players that need to rename themselves asap. Fucking super.
He's not repeating the article; he's saying who he would award if he wrote it.
I guess it was submitted as Yeik Nai Zheng, then someone at Valve/production house saw it, assumed Secret sent his name in the western order, and decided to put Zheng Yeik Nai instead.
Fucked part is that Valve calls him Zheng Yeik Nai to add the 3rd combination into the mix.
Even Valve got confused - no surprise.
FATA-'s head on KhezZu's body SeemsGood

What the fuck Secret.

(With an additional dash of strange colour splotches during highlights)
Strange that SunBhie's name follows Asian style (Lastname Firstname) but they butchered MidOne's. 

More correctly it should be: Yeik 'MidOne' Nai Zheng.

(Edit: You can google his yearbook to confirm the order - Yeik is his surname)

(Edit x2: His name has been butchered to hell and back so I'm just using his Chinese name instead: 葉乃政, or Ye Nai Zheng, so Yeik *is* his surname.)
Can't get more games if enemies don't let you pick it though.

Could be software set up gone wrong. Software is now so complicated it's surprising how everything works as well as they do.
It's a little complicated, but put simply all 3 CPUs (m3, i5, i7) have the same hardware, but during manufacturing Intel selectively disables certain parts of the chip, maybe that part of the chip is faulty, or out of spec, or just for $. As such, Intel has 3 different configurations of parts enabled that result in the m3/i5/i7. 

Putting it another way, consider a chair producing factory. Due to carpenters occasionally screwing up, the factory produces chairs that can be classed into 3: 1) perfect chair (i7), 2) good chair (i5), 3) meh chair (m3). The really terrible ones are thrown out, but the 3 categories would be priced accordingly, and look accordingly.

There is a distinct performance difference as the i7 has much more components enabled, namely HT and the huge eDRAM. 



 
I think you have software issues on the i7. There is no (significant) software or hardware difference between an i5 and i7 chip (other than the eDRAM, which is actually still there on package just not enabled), just what options have been set (permanently) on the chip during the manufacturing process.

You can try reinstalling Windows from scratch, or return for a new one.

Edit: You can also look at iFixit m3 teardowns - ever wonder what that narrow rectangular long slab next to the more squarish chip is?
You missed out the point where mods apologized for removing threads, THEN REMOVED THEM AGAIN ANYWAY.

He's sincerely vigorously defending it (alone) too much to be a meme. 
Yes let the salt flow through you.
Even most of sgamer is calling the author saltlord with comments like "Sometimes when games are lost, it feels like there are bugs", or "wtf essay = logic? Why the fuck is there so many people agreeing?".

The entire thread comments is pretty much slaking the author, and comments in agreement are either obvious sarcasm, or sarcasm. I haven't seen any that actually sincerely agree.

Just want to clarify it's just 1 salt lord and not most of chinese gamers being salty they lost TI7.
He had his snickers. 
And then he'd just pick Rubick and play Shakira.
Akke kept mentioning that only Liquid could win with those drafts when PJSalt kept saying Liquid wins through non-Dota.

Was quite entertaining.

Their logo is a dark horse though.
The main reason they even got to the grand finals was his calls. Melonzz said kpii was shook and I agree, I think he got slight PTSD when Liquid always seemed to have an answer to any move he made and it seemed like he wasn't able to do anything in game 1.

Kaka and him looked so lost and soulless when they left their booth.

Methane and hype0000 has been saltier than the dead sea in all threads about any liquid wins.
Reverse game 1.
This is like VP vs LFY game 2 please Liquid!!
Meant to destroy the mid picks which worked really well.
Game 1 LGD was winning all the way until the last 5 minutes where they nearly did a TnC vs Secret throw, and game 2 was the GH + Mind_Control show where Liquid won 4v5 with a farming Alch.
So does Kuro.
Liquid decided if [A] doesn't work they're just going to run VP dota.
TB mid wut
Liquid draft feels scary for the wrong reasons... Not sure if the last pick Terrorblade does it.
And then they just won 4v5 in game 2.
Bo1 drafts boys.
You can watch Epicenter GF Game 1. I think that was his best game recently, but he's actually played Io 5 times this TI: https://www.dotabuff.com/esports/players/101356886/matches?hero=io
LFY got 4v5'd - must be Liquid cheese.
AUI2000 in TI5. Naga Techies Enchant
Trust liquid to go from a push strat into using push heroes for a fight strat.
Would be killed by puck ulti.
He also had a lot more useful spells to steal when they draft Rubick. Kuro outplayed himself.

In this game there's what, assassinate?
He even picked Rubick for god knows why.
KuroKy needs to steal something useful but there's nothing useful. I have no fucking idea why Kuro played himself.
What the fuck is the point of Rubick in this draft ffs Kuro pls.
Reverse captain's draft (although non TI) was pretty good too.
He's a shitty Shadow Shaman in the current meta.

GH promoted to Captain now.

Winning EG probably made Empire like this.

Now that they 2-0'd EG some of them probably got "OH MAN WE'RE DOING THE DC LOWER BRACKET RUN" and can't play 120% they've been.
They picked Alch as well.
You pray that Batrider gets lasso off and you burst down Huskar ASAP, then the entire Liquid is yours to pick off.
LUL TIED 1-1 PRODUCTION IS FIRED
Get Empire to draft you AM against Oracle Huskar.
GEGE LIQUID IS DOING IT!
Feels like Empire is not playing as smooth as they've been playing and they're just losing because they're faffing against this quick and sloppy Liquid.
Easiest way is to just ban Huskar when you see an Oracle pick?

NotLikeThis.
They can't fight anything though. Not without burst from Mana Void hopefully killing the Huskar before he gets Oracle'd.
Hope this works: https://twitter.com/prostokandrat/status/894655022885220352

Jesus Liquid is the most relaxed team about their courier control.

Liquid is semi-tilted though, their team play is questionable.
Liquid playing like high skill pubs and Empire playing like a team...
I... I think they cheered a deny...?
Hell during that IG game in main stage Miracle- MK was hitting creeps and letting GH get the last hits to get that aghs ASAP.
Hopefully huskar'd. Liquid going straight for the meme strats.
Beast on it though.
Surprised I haven't seen Miracle-'s AM yet, hopefully Liquid can counter it.
To be fair KotL strats is very dependent on your team being good enough to pull it off as well.
You need to actually win with it though.
Sorry IG on mainstage.
Sven is to Reso as KotL is to GH.
Liquid is honoring AdmiralBulldong in spirit all TI long.

Can't make it to TI but your play lives on.
B R O O D B E A S T
They lost once with KotL against IG, so I guess teams thought they were mortal.
LIQUID IS DOING IT!
SPAM THAT FUCKING SENTRY YEAH
Gege fuck's sake Sentry is 100 gold.
Liquid playing incredibly sloppy this game versus invis mobile heroes.
Stop going around 1 by 1 without vision!
They wanted to give huge space for GH aghs for the death rush, but Matumba too impatient.
What the hell is that charge KuroKy.
OH GOD THAT COURIER USE THE BOOST OUT!!!
So far besides draft they get caught out quite often, so hopefully it works out. I'm feeling nervous if they can catch the weaver + BH roaming combo in late game. 
Liquid's primary weak point has always been their warding IMO, hopefully BH doesn't punish that too bad.
This is some strange-ass Liquid The Intergalatical draft.
Why is Liquid not sitting on top of the rune ffs.
I hope this is some genius KuroKy mindgame pls.

Extremely fast, nuanced, and brings across the implicit even though sometimes I disagree with his understanding but he hits far more than he misses.
Not sure if Anavoker will work. Invoker's having a rough stage on main stage.
For the memes, if TNC wins it's really a curse at this point.

IG hoping to do a repeat performance.
I think that was what Liquid tried to hope for (some Miravoker game like the game against IG.V) when they got outdrafted.
The only thing is that it feels baited.
Still somewhat nervous about this game though.
...Miravoker?

Yeah. Day 1 Liquid vs IG.V game 2.
Wings had 3-2-2 in Group Stage though. Liquid is more similar given the sheer versatility of the players, although they've different play-styles. 
3kuku too strong. 
EG vs Fnatic.

15 min game 14k gold lead.
Psst that's group B.
This was the way I wanted Liquid to play - like the Liquid-EG Epicenter GF Game 1, not the clowny game 2 against Secret.
13 min GG?
OG self destructing.
Same as last year actually.
So you lost 0-2 to last place and you're the better team...?
I.E., the rules:

> 1- Compare the matchup history of the tied teams

They're 1-1 against each other so go to 2.

> 2- Compare their wins vs the seed right below them. Repeat until resolved.

(Relevant rank portion:)


Rank | Team | Score
----|----|-----
5 | Secret | 7-9
5 | IG.V | 7-9
7 | Empire | 6-10
8 | Infamous | 5-11



Below Secret and IG.V is Empire. Secret and IG.V are 1-1 against Empire, so go further down to Infamous.

Secret is 1-1 against Infamous and IG.V is 0-2 against Infamous, so Secret > IG.V

> 3- Coin toss

Yeah.
Game 2 was sloppy enough that a team not as tilted as Secret would have punished them very hard.
He left because N0tail and Fly kicked Moon, and Crit- left, so he felt the team was already gone so might as well try newer pastures (and more strats).
He just dagon'd a catapult in front of Enemy T3s LUL

Can't get more of that TI pie, better maximize that BP pie.
They're playing the Io rush, which they had been reamed by Liquid in Epicenter GF game 1. 

Always an artform in action but must suck to be on the receiving end. 
That's partially because Valve has a hate-on for pimp.
Sh1t- draft and no plays sh1t- is in meta I believe.
TnC vs Infamous is so close that it's astonishing. 

Meanwhile Liquid (hoping to) put on the Miravoker show again.
They went for the meme ulti draft. The plan is for something like Fly Supernova into JerAx Overgrowth into S4 blackhole into Ana Echo Slam and all the while PL illusions chewing through your mana.
LFY/Liquid/EG/VP are all safe picks.
Jesus is it going to be a EE Pugna.

EE: WITNESS ME NOTAIL
SingSing and EE are like anime time lapse high altitude weighted training chambers where upon being kicked you gain success in other teams.
MP finds his way to top networth somehow, and has carried his team now and then, all things you can't say about EE.
C9 can't push, can't split push, can't team fight, and even with night stalker on the team they lost the vision game entirely. If they don't start playing better they might just as well disband after TI. It's terrible, bafflingly terrible.
Clown9 has, against all expectations, managed to make him look weak.

Entirely baffled. C9 can't push, can't rat, can't teamfight. GG
