Not OP, but it looks like [this](https://www.redbubble.com/people/zrises/works/23942281-s-m-crystal-stained-glass-style?p=poster&finish=semi_gloss&size=small) one from Redbubble.
DH has gotten really serious about working on TTC... just in time for my doctor to decide to put me on Spironolactone. I know it‚Äôs for my own good, but yet another obstacle has me a bit frustrated.
HFTT didn‚Äôt use the winner‚Äôs name, only called her ‚ÄúJane‚Äù iirc, but DID use her statement.
Honestly couldn‚Äôt hear it over them booing literally everything.
Price check: KeyKollectiv Meowcap v3 Guava Beans MX
Its a fragrance by Lush, but cute. :)
No rush! Thanks!
Definitely interested! Any pics? :)
Hi all~

I'm looking for:

* TF Hangover RX primer (travel or full size)

* Shiro Cosmetics "Do Your Research" contouring powder (lightly used sample or full sized)

* BH Cosmetics Zodiac palette

* Maybelline Age Rewind in Ivory

Shipping to Rochester, NY - thanks! :)
I plan to tell DH with a mug. I found this really adorable one made by a local artist that says ‚ÄúHi thirsty, I‚Äôm Dad.‚Äù DH LOVES bad puns and Dad jokes so I think it‚Äôs perfect for him.

As for our parents... I haven‚Äôt quite figured it out yet. Both of our siblings have already had kids so they‚Äôre all already grandparents. I‚Äôll figure something out.

As for social media, we‚Äôre huge gamers so I‚Äôve had a couple things floating around.

1.) A photo of the two of us playing games with a Link/Zelda onesie and the ultrasound hanging on the wall behind us 

or 2.) since we‚Äôre MMORPG players I think it could be fun to do something like a ‚Äúwaiting for group‚Äù type thing. 

We‚Äôll see someday!
Items that come to mind:

* Songbird hat

* Hannish Wool Autumn Shirt (dye-able)

* Weathered Evenstar Tights

* Bunny Chief Tights

* Swanliege Armguards

* [Makai gowns](https://img2.finalfantasyxiv.com/accimg2/a3/4b/a34bcd590c4c427a4b1ed3a8cfd1dc0bf71ca41c.jpg)

* Genta necklaces

* Eastern Lady's Crackows
I made an appointment at the Apple store about a month or so ago and they tested my battery saying it was at 88% capacity. My phone is still covered by AppleCare until March and I was hoping it would drop below that 80% "free replacement" threshold before expiration.

A couple days ago I contacted online support to have it tested again remotely since I; 

1.) Don't wanna go to the Apple Store until way after the holidays are over and 

2.) Simply haven't had the time lately 

and was told by online support "You device battery seems to be 100% healthy." (Taken direct from the support transcript I received in my email.)

I realize I have a much older device (by current technology standards, iPhone 6S+) but for fucks sake. I'm extremely frustrated.
Guilty. üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Had this exact issue more than once yesterday.
Updated to the latest firmware and everything?

I‚Äôve got an Asus AC1900 and have never had a problem getting speeds that meet or even exceed what I pay for at Greenlight.
What‚Äôs your setup? Netgear is shit tbh and you just might not be getting your promised speeds because of that. I had a small issue a couple months ago, but a quick call to customer service and it was fixed right away. They were even out next day to put my line back up after it was torn down in that wind storm from earlier this year.
That's completely understandable. DH and I bought a house last year so we've definitely put down some roots. GL to you! I'm sure the onesie you chose is adorable! üòç
Not as crazy as I am. Haha. I‚Äôve started planning to buy big ticket nursery items during our wait as I find things on sale. (Stroller, crib, nursery items, etc) Obviously not a car seat or anything that could be a safety issue, but you get it.

I plan on being gender neutral as well so picking up items doesn‚Äôt bother me any. I‚Äôd just rather get things over time rather than all at once. I also think I saw people from that one /r/PersonalFinance thread (linked here a bit ago) make the suggestion to buy things over time before you start TTC, so that made me feel a little better.
It should be absolutely fine to use on other parts of your body. I like it for my feet as well. :)
So the main issue with this scrub is that it uses apricot kernel or shell as the abrasive. These particles are jagged and not smooth, and can create micro tears in your skin. So whilst it might do the job for exfoliating, at the same time it's scratching your skin which can create openings in the skin for bacteria to get in, which can cause acne as well as pigmentation issues.
Chemical exfoliation does a better job by ungluing your skins cells without the scratching and tears. It still Exfoliates, but is much gentler.
Not sure why *that‚Äôs* the part of my post you decided to cling to, but what exactly is considered ‚Äúnormal speed?‚Äù The speed limit? Some people in the left are doing the speed limit. Should someone break the law and exceed the speed limit just to drive in the left lane? Should someone miss their exit/merge so you can pass them? I fail to see the point you were trying to make here. 

All I was saying, is that there ARE certain instances that require you to be in a specific lane. (490 split, 104->590S, for example.) It obviously comes down to poor road design. 
This. People definitely just disregard the ‚Äúleft lane is for passing‚Äù rule of thumb and there‚Äôs no excuse for being an asshole, but there are a lot of spots where you need to be in one lane or the other or you‚Äôre going to end up going the wrong way. People are selfish.
Luna/Theodore (Theo)
Yeah ;~;

I was completely prepared to pay $75-100 USD for it, but... looks like I probably won't be getting it after all..
Oh!! Thank you!!

Looks like it's only for members of the fan club - something I didn't know existed. I wonder if there's any other way I could get it...
I‚Äôve seen fan-made pens, but never a legitimate one. The one in this Instagram post looks completely different than the ones you can find on eBay and such. Anyone know anything about this?

Thanks!
It's selfish because it's clear you don't care. It's selfish that you refuse to do any semblance of research on how this could affect other countries around the world.

[Well](https://www.voanews.com/a/net-neutrality-debate-in-us-could-have-global-ripple-effects/1832561.html) I've [got](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27397857) news [for](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/opinion/global-threats-to-net-neutrality.html) you, [it](http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/technology/216107-why-the-us-net-neutrality-debate-matters-globally) absolutely [could](https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/20/the-implications-of-the-end-of-net-neutrality/).

It's so narrow-minded to think that something in another country couldn't possibly affect you. Just because our laws don't govern you doesn't mean that it can't have a lasting ripple effect on those around us.
What an incredibly selfish thing to say.

It effects a portion of the playerbase and the company that created the game and you can't be assed to give a shit?
My husband is also wearing his lucky socks. WITH YOUR POWERS COMBINED!
Like /u/Nouveau_Depart said in that other thread: "Wow, you must be so embarrassed you said that"
Well the first question would be to ask where you live. Some states (California, Rhode Island, Washington, New Jersey, and New York as well as the District of Columbia) have laws that provide paid family leave. If you DON'T live in one of those states, you could look up if there's anything in the works where you live.

I know it sounds like a "DUH" thing, but I live in NY and had no idea paid family leave was in the works for next year up until very recently!
My cousin and I have always been close and I've confided in her my WTT struggles and she's been pretty understanding. This time seemed a little different, though. She invited me to visit (which is a cross country flight) and I joked and said "I don't think baby cuddles would be good for my baby fever!" and she responds with "Yeah, but the hours of crying will!" I know I shouldn't get offended, but I responded with "Literally everyone knows that babies cry before having them. That doesn't seem to stop people." She immediately changed the subject. 

I'm not trying to be a total bitch or anything, but knowing that I'm struggling with the wait, to tell me that I wouldn't want one after knowing that they cry a lot? DUH. Of course I know they cry a lot. I apologized for being snarky, but ugh. /sigh 
Replied!
Replied!
Is there any real point in temping *while you still have your IUD in*? I haven‚Äôt had a period in ages and all I‚Äôve been able to find is ‚ÄúYes you still ovulate when you have an IUD.‚Äù Obviously it would be for pure curiosity since I wouldn‚Äôt be using it for BC or conception, but is it a good idea to chart and keep track of ‚Äúcycles‚Äù/ovulation early on or could everything change when I have it removed?

Baby rabies has turned my brain to mush. Sorry if I sound like a crazy person.
The only thing holding him back (or so he says) is that he‚Äôs gone back to college and is busy with school. That being said, I literally just want to talk about it! Talking about it and coming up with a plan does NOT MEAN IMMEDIATE. TTC AFTER college suits me just fine, but I‚Äôm really struggling with keeping my thoughts to myself to avoid an argument.

Also, are we the same person or something? I stalked your post history looking for your into post (forgive me!) and saw you‚Äôre into mech keebs and bujo/planning! I‚Äôm a mech key girl myself (mx blues) and a Happy Planner lover! 

At any rate, I feel a little relieved that I‚Äôm not the only one having these feelings. Feel free to PM me to vent any time!
I've been feeling pretty lonely lately. I feel like my brand of "waiting to try" is a little different than others here, so I guess I'm looking to vent and maybe find others in a similar situation. 


Most people here have a timeline, goals, specific reasons for waiting, but I don't have any of that. I can't get past *"the discussion"* with DH. The most he'll do is tell me he wants kids. He won't discuss the when, where, or how. Just that he wants them. Any time I try to have this discussion with him for any peace of mind he gets argumentative. I know that means he's not ready and let me be clear, I'm **absolutely not** trying to push him to be ready - I just want to have an adult conversation with my husband to get us on the same page. We argued about it a around a month ago ending with both of us being upset, him saying "Well maybe I'm not ready to have that discussion!" me responding with "You're 30 years old and I'm your wife, the least you could do is talk about it with me! It's *our* future." and then my complete silence after he said "30 is only my physical age!" I feel like he's not meeting me in the middle here and there's been absolutely no compromise on his end. It's especially hard to be patient when he won't discuss it at all. I feel like I'm waiting solo.


Sorry for the rant. If anyone knows of a better suited subreddit, lmk!
Sooo.. about that...
My husband is THE SAME EXACT WAY. Out of curiousity (and of course it‚Äôs fine if you‚Äôre not comfortable answering,) but does your husband have ADHD? Mine does and just knowing that has really helped me understand and control my frustration. 
Came here for this.

[Somebody's gotta tell him.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSJEd8KQB3s)
I 100% relate. I just spent half an hour in my room crying because my SIL announced that she's pregnant. I want to be happy, but it's hard.
Feeling really deflated today. Last night (two days before my cousin and bff is having her first) DH declared that he wants to now wait until after his bachelors degree instead of after his associates. That doesn't seem like a big deal, but he only goes to school part time meaning it will take him twice as long. 4.5 more years minimum. I'll be 31 by then. I know it's just a number, but definitely not part of the plan I had in my head. It especially hurts because he sends me daily text reminders that he wants to TTC. I can't keep getting these messages for another 4 years. I can't. Would it be rude to ask him to stop? I really just need advice on how to cope for that long. Sorry for the rant.
Interested in this plot if it's still available, lmk
I'd be interested in this plot. lmk if it's still available.
GIRLLLLLLL. Let me know. For real. I've been dying to do something different with my mop. [Here's](http://imgur.com/YjYCCHe) what I'm workin' with currently. Fresh wash, air dry cause I'm lazy today. Usually it's a blow dry and flat iron. I haven't had my hair cut or dyed since November, so it's gotten pretty out of control. :P
I'm from Rochester, NY and I swear I would come to Toronto just to have you do my hair. Soooo beautiful <3
If that's a pink Filco I NEED IT.

Happy birthday you generous person, you! I honestly love that more often than not if someone turns down an offer it's "No worries, man. GLWS." The last time I posted I got compliments on my current board and everyone always seems so supportive when someone is looking for something for their "endgame."
I appreciate your response! I've been looking for a good work keyboard. I need a sturdy one with a numpad and have had my eye on the Model M for a while now. Since it would likely stay at work I'm not really too concerned about the size. That being said, at that price I don't think anyone would have a problem with paying the shipping costs, but I could be wrong! Again, I hope everything works out for you!
If you decide to ship it, LMK. I'd definitely be willing to purchase it. GLWS! :)

The instructor for last practice I regularly attended would only adjust people if she thought they were in danger of hurting themselves. This could be the approach your instructor is going for - especially if it's a beginner or intermediate class. You should definitely ask!

I apologize for the slow reply - things got a bit crazy here at home! 

As cute as this guy is, it's not exactly my aesthetic, but I really appreciate your post! GL with finding that one a new home :>
Hello potential skin twin!!

I know this reply is late, but I've been testing products. I'm sure you understand! I just want you to know how much I appreciate your response to my post. I tried Thayer's Rose witch hazel toner and it's seriously LIFE CHANGING. I really don't think I could thank you enough! That being said, I still haven't found an effective cleanser that doesn't break me out, but I wanted to share some of my findings with you.

I've been using the Thayer's toner with excellent results. It was going really well so I added Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA liquid and it has been FABULOUS.

I also realized my mistake in my original post and the Clinique Dramatically different moisturizing **LOTION** is what breaks me out. I gave the **GEL** a try and in combination with the toner and BHA I've had really good results.

I've also cut milk out of my diet. I would say dairy completely, but that would be false. I still eat cheeses, sour cream, ice cream, etc. I just no longer drink glasses of milk with breakfast in the morning and I use a non-dairy creamer in my coffee. YMMV.

I'm not sure if any of this information will be helpful for you, but I hope it is. Again, thank you SO MUCH for taking the time to share your knowledge and routine with me. It's made a serious world of difference in my skin - something I've been struggling with for a very long time.
Bought Vortex Pink/White keycaps from /u/lextrixguy
I don't have anything you're looking for, but if you decide to sell that Meowcap LMK!! Glws
The only thing that comes to mind is the Keycool blue gradient keycaps that were on [Massdrop](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/keycool-gradient-keycaps) a while back. GL!
PMing
These are nice! Thanks for doing a giveaway! :)
I don't actually have a routine. The items listed were things I've tried in the past. I'm not currently using anything because nothing has worked so far. It's so hard to commit to Avene's price tag when I'm really unsure of whether or not it will work for me, but I'll definitely do some research. Thank you for your suggestion.


edit: I guess I'm having problems because it could be literally anything. I don't have a single good product that doesn't break me out to compare ingredients to. I'm not sure what to rule out.
**Issue:** Okay guys. I'm nearing my wits end. I've been subbed here for at least TWO YEARS and I feel like I'm not making ANY ground. Everything I patch test seems to break me out. I'm in the US.


**Skin type:** Blemish prone, combo, possibly dehydrated?


Products I've tried and the outcome:

1.) Cleansers

* Cerave Foaming Facial Cleanser - Squeaky clean feeling, tightness

* Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser - Whiteheads

* Cerave Hydrating Facial Cleanser - Thought this one was working during patch test, used on entire face and broke out

* Aveeno Ultra-Calming Foaming Cleanser - Squeaky clean feeling, general dryness

* Goodal Phytowash cleansing foam - Got a sample, patch tested, thought everything was going well, started to get deep breakouts again. 

* OCM Mineral oil, Innisfree Apple juicy cleansing oil, kose softymo speedy cleansing oil - all caused deep angry bumps


2.) Exfoliation:

* Stridex in the Red Box - burning, tightness

* St. Ives Exfoliating Pads (discontinued) - stinging. I don't remember too much else about these, but they're discontinued anyway.

* (Sidenote for this category: I have PC 2% liquid samples on the way!)


3.) Spot treatments:

* Hydrocolloid bandages are bae.


4.) Moisturizers:

* CeraVe in the Tub - Probably the worst offender, so many whiteheads

* Simple Ultra-Light Gel Moisturizer - Stinging, didn't seem to help with dryness

* Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel - whiteheads

* Nivea creme - turned my face into an oil slick


I'm not even sure where to start with narrowing down ingredients that might be the culprit. I use sulfate free shampoo and conditioner and Tom's SLS free toothpaste. I have Mirena (progestin hormone IUD), but I have had issues with acne long before it was inserted. I have developed good habits. I don't wear makeup often and always take it off before bed. I change my pillowcases regularly and use free and clear detergent.


ANY guidance at this point would be greatly appreciated!
I am interested in the PC and one of the Drunk Elephant decants if they're still available. :)
A couple portraits from my wedding.

I agree. Without proof I'm calling BS. I have found all the fragments and killed that named (for a WQ) and received nothing other than my WQ reward.
I gotta ask - what undergarments did you use for your strapless dress? I've been on the hunt and I've tried a couple things so far that haven't worked out..
Let me know if chocolate bar falls through :)
I designed my invitations myself as well and I had an absolutely wonderful experience with Catprint.com. I found that they were really affordable and as a bonus they send you a free hardcopy proof so that you can approve it before they start printing. Even before my hardcopy proof was sent out they emailed me with an issue with my file that was causing a bit of my border to be cut off so I would assume they would alert you of any other issues - such as the stripes not showing correctly.

Upon receiving my hardcopy proof I was able to completely change my design and paper type with no additional fees. Their customer service was always prompt to get back to me and super helpful.

Another thing to note is that if you have a larger order of invites (mine was only about 60, so not exactly worth it for me.. but!) they give 10% off of your order if you donate $10 to their featured charity.
That site has awful [reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/izidresses.com). Not to knock on what you found, just wanted OP to be informed.
It looks like a Spring 2014 Romona Keveza gown. No idea where you'd be able to get it now, but here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ybgtvQAvY).

I'd be all over it if you were doing paypal :\ Let me know if you reconsider!
If they're still available, I've got PayPal ready! Still trying to get my hands on them for my honeymoon!!

That's what I was afraid of. I want to cut my losses so badly - because you're right it could potentially be a disaster.. but it's such a unique venue and location and we won't be able to find anything else like it. I really had my heart set on it so I'm pretty heartbroken.
Just making sure you got my payment! :)

Thanks for your reply! This gives me hope for styles for myself! Also, a beautiful vintage comb would be a great look for your hair and dress styles! Just a thought!

Also!! How did she do the front? I'm so curious now!!
Ugh! Totally in love! What length is your hair normally? :)
Hopefully it works out for you! I find the #13 in the long wear is darker and more orange on me than my ampoule intense cushion in #13, but idk how that compares to the water glow. Good luck!
The only USA seller I found with one in stock is [here](http://www.imomoko.com/innisfree-water-glow-cushion-spf50-pa-no-13-18298.html). Ultra cute (limited edition?) packaging, but more expensive as a result.

**Issue:** I've noticed persistent patches of dry, flaky skin ONLY around my nose creases. These places are not red, irritated, itchy, or any of that. Just extremely flaky. These patches easily flake off DAILY. Is this possibly seborrheic dermatitis? Every case I've seen seems to have redness and irritation along with the flakes so I'm really unsure. I've been struggling with this issue before I began my current routine and none of my current products have helped or worsened the situation. (With maybe the exception of the below listed sheet masks, which aren't a long-term solution imo.)

**Skin type:** Normal-combo? Oily t-zone, dry patches around nose creases. Fairly sensitive, acne prone. I'm not exactly sure specifically what ingredients break me out yet.

**Current routine:**

**AM:**

* Splash with water

* Simple Micellar Water if I'm feeling extra oily/gunky

* Makeup

**PM:**

* Remove makeup with Burt's Bees facial wipes (white tea)

* Remove waterproof stuff with Simple Micellar water

* Cleanse with Goodal Phytowash Cleansing foam

* CosRx Natural BHA Skin Returning A-Sol

**Occasionally:**

* Tony Moly or Tosowoong propolis sheet mask

I'm located in the US. I've been using all of these products for some time now with really great results (not a single active zit right now, yay!). I do not currently have a moisturizer as I've yet to find one that my skin does not react negatively to. Moisturizers I've tried in the past include:

* CeraVe in the Tub (close comedones EVERYWHERE)

* Nivea creme (too greasy? broke me out)

* Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel (didn't seem to do anything for my skin)

* Vaseline (reduced the flakes while applied, does nothing for it during the daytime)

* Cetaphil Lotion (very greasy, caused slight burning sensation as if my skin were raw?)

I've also tried oil cleansing and every oil I've tried has broken me out horribly as well. Mineral (wood and baby), neem, sweet almond, Kose Softymo Deep cleansing oil, and Innisfree Apple Juicy cleansing oil.

I am currently waiting on a package that includes Scinic Propolis 95 ampoule and more of my sheet masks, my skin seems to LOVE propolis.

I'm open to any and all recommendations as I'm really not sure where to go from here and I'm working on getting my skin in tip-top shape for my wedding in 7 months (!!!!). Thanks guys!!
I quite love it on you, personally! 

What if you looked up some Youtube tutorials on different ways to style it? I used to have a pixie, but when I used headbands and clips and such I felt like I looked like a child. Learning to style it in a way that made me feel my age really saved the cut for me!
"Bumchin" or not, it's fucking sculpted like that of a goddess. Gorgeous!
Interested if you still have it! :)
Get. Out. These are SO stunning. I haven't printed mine yet (non-letterpress), but I am having some serious invitation envy! Wonderful job!!
Yes please! PM me your PayPal :)
Warm eye lot if it still hasn't sold, please :)
God bless this thread. That's all.
I'm pretty sure you're my skin tone twin! Definitely taking notes from your product lists, you look amazing!
585 here!
FH and I have our guest list sectioned into specific "groups" so we could stay organized and not leave anyone out..

...One of those groups is specifically for our friends from World of Warcraft.
I'll put my vote in for the skater dress or the daisy spin romper. These are strapless/off the shoulder options which might prevent some funky tan lines.

Have fun, OP! I'm sure whatever you pick will be perfect. :)
FH and I just aren't "cake people", so I get it. We considered pie, but ultimately decided to go with something even cheaper... doughnuts!

I think pie is a fabulous idea and if you're tacky for having pie, then I must be the queen of tacky for wanting a tower of doughnuts. Do whatever makes you happy!
I loooove this idea. Another idea could be that instead of walking with anyone, you could walk down, FH could walk up, and you would meet halfway before sharing the rest of the aisle together. 
Yep, this! It's probably going on too thick. Remember to spray in even strokes about 8-12 inches, iirc. If you're looking for it to be more opaque, try multiple coats - letting it dry between coats.
Only *slightly* over budget, but my pick would be [these](https://www.etsy.com/listing/195061314/bridal-infinity-knot-chandelier-earrings). GL OP!
That sounds sooooo gorgeous! I believe 10/16/16 is supposed to be one of those "super moons" so I'm really excited about our date, theme, and even the location (has the word "luna" in it!) It's all coming together. :)
Shades of navy/french/midnight blue and muted brushed gold. Colors inspired by the night sky. I considered adding grey, but I didn't want *too* much going on.

We chose a night sky sort of theme because FH is currently working towards a masters in astronomy and star gazing was one of our favorite past times before we moved to a city.

In addition, my ring has crecent moon detail and I'm a huge Sailor Moon fan (shocker, I know).

It just fit for us and we love it.
Seconding MUFE! So many foundations break me out, but their "mat velvet" #15 is my perfect shade match and it doesn't break me out.

Thanks for sharing OP, I'm so happy for you! 
Megaman shipped to 14534? I have a small flair on /r/Makeupexchange if you're interested.

Awesome, I'll take it! PM me your paypal :)
And Becca pearl!
MUG Creme Br√ªl√©e and Moondust if they pass
Thank you so much!

As for the last names, my last name is at least twice as long as FH's and I was afraid that would put things severely off-balance on the invite.

How should I format the inclusion of last names? My name on one line, his on another? Or perhaps putting last names directly under that format I already have?

Side question: Is the last name an aesthetic thing or a convenience thing of quickly being able to identify the bride and groom?

I only ask because we're doing postcard RSVPs and those will have our first and last names pre-printed on them as well as last names being located in a couple other places in the suite.

Sorry for all the questions, I really appreciate your input! :)
Yes please!
It's funny because I did have "dinner and dancing to follow" without "immediately" on previous drafts, perhaps I'll go back to it.

I appreciate your input! :)
Hi! Thanks for your comment!

I've seen it on a lot of invites and am under the impression that including "immediately" is an indication that the ceremony and reception are taking place at the same location.

I suppose it could also be worded "dinner and dancing immediately following." Does that sound better or still weird?

Thanks again!
Thank you!! :)

Of course I don't mind! It's [Cheddar Jack](http://www.dafont.com/cheddar-jack.font) and is free on Dafont. Enjoy!
That's so nice of you! I'll wait! Curaga is a for sure, though! :)
I'm not seeing anything else besides Opal or brink and both of those are pending. Let me know if they become available or if you'd be willing to sell Curaga separate. :)

Thank you! FH is currently going for a masters to be an astronomy professor and star gazing was a favorite activity when we lived in the country with less light pollution.

There's just so many elements in our lives that said "DO CONSTELLATIONS", so we went for it. :)
Me too! I ran around the house and picked up every pen I could find and here are my results:
[link](http://i.imgur.com/7urzNp4.jpg)

* HUB pen (Ballpoint, blue ink)

* Uni-ball Jetstream (Ballpoint, black ink)

* Zebra Sarasa (Gel, black "rapid dry" ink)

* Pilot G-2 (Gel, black ink)

* Mechanical pencil (Also Pilot G-2 brand)

Edit: Also, hello old version of my invite! All the info on my old one is incorrect. It was just placeholder stuff before we had picked a venue/date/etc.
Hmmm.. this one is almost like a matte shimmer. I haven't had any problems with writing on it (as I've printed test invites on my home printer and wrote notes about things that needed to be adjusted on it)... but that being said, I could just be using a nicer pen. (Anti-smudge, left hand friendly nonsense.)

I'll definitely try different writing mediums before I make my final paper selection for my RSVPs. Thanks for the advice, definitely something I didn't consider before!
Agreed! The new app is total garbage. Everything looks way too blocky and the Leafs roster was only fixed in the most recent update.

Garbage, garbage, garbage.
I'll likely use the same cardstock throughout the suite, unless people think that's tacky.. then... probably not. :P

Opinions, suggestions?
Sounds fine to me, PM me your PP? :)
It's 14534. :)
I'll take both MUG blushes, please :)
Perfect! PM me your PP :D
Hi! I'm interested in the wallet and the Sinner and Stella samples :)
Interested in MUG Rockstar and Hipster
I can swing that! PM me total price shipped and your paypal :)
I think Watts up is a little too yellow on me, personally. What were you thinking for the high beam if you're willing to separate?
I believe I have my e&j needs met for now, thank you for the offer though!
You're an angel!! I wish I could upvote this a million times. I've been looking for this swatch comparison for like... a month or more. I'm pretty neutral as well, but from the swatch I feel like it might pull orange on me - which is what I was afraid of. Thank you so, so much!!!
$25 shipped sounds good to me! Do you have any pics? :)
I'll check 'em out, thanks! :)
Oooooo... what were you thinking for the lot shipped?
Perfect! PM me your PayPal? :)
Interested! Price shipped and verification?
Hi! I'm really only interested in black, so if you're willing to split the two, I'm interested!
Thank you SO much for this! MUFE Mat velvet #15 is pretty much a perfect match for me, but I've been looking for something with a more natural finish. I doubt it, but do you have MUFE #15 to compare snow to?
I'll take them! :)
Would you be willing to do the MUG shadows as a lot? 
These are so eye pleasing! You did such a great job!! Did you use a font or is it freehand?
Lolita if it falls through, please :)
Certainly not the same, but I will pretty much always recommend Modcloth. Their [Gilded Grace](http://www.modcloth.com/shop/dresses/gilded-grace-dress-in-champagne) and [Sparkling Celebration](http://www.modcloth.com/shop/dresses/sparkling-celebration-dress-in-ivory) dresses are SO pretty and definitely give the same vibe as the photo you posted.

As an added bonus, both of the dresses I linked are only around $200!
[Here's](http://imgur.com/I19IuWS) my everyday with glasses and [without](http://imgur.com/VPWNZmP).


Looking for everyday suggestions, but *especially* bridal makeup.

Side note, I'm (obviously) very fair, typically wearing MUFE Mat velvet #15. I also believe I'm pretty neutral, if that helps.
Interested in the TF matte eye!
Sure! PM me your PayPal? :)
I need Poppy Picnic in my life... any chance you'd do $25 shipped?
Oh my god, shut up and take my money. Well done OP, it's beautiful!!
Awesome! PM me your PayPal :)
$14 shipped or before shipping?
If you still have the A-Sol available, I'll take it! :)
Just putting it out there, but I adore the way baby's breath smells! I did mock ups for my centerpieces and kept them around extra long because I liked it so much. OP should probably have a whiff themselves and form their own opinion on the fragrance!
Is the drip tip on the goblin mini press fit or flanged?
Here's the [album](http://imgur.com/a/Xha2Z)! Hope you find it helpful. First photo in the album is **with** flash, second is **without** flash.

Neither of them are natural sunlight as I worked all day. I can try and get natural light tomorrow if you'd like!

EDIT: Didn't swatch the Revlon as my bottle is quite old and I'm convinced it has oxidized.
REQUESTING SPACE BUNS, STAT.
I have the ampoule intense cushion in #13! If you still need it I can swatch next to KVD 42, MUFE Mat Velvet 15, Cover FX N0, Revlon ColorStay 110, and Missha Perfect Cover #13 if you're familiar with any of those shades!
I'll take the derringer off your hands.
Let me know if you're willing to separate the Evic :) GLWS.
At first glance I thought it was [this](https://moncheribridals.com/browse/wedding-dresses/david-tutera-for-mon-cheri/114289-vera/) gown, but the belt and lace styles are different. Nonetheless, it's a beautiful gown- sorry I couldn't be of more help!
Soon, I hope... I need something to hope for.
Well... uhhh.. how about those new jerseys?

edit: OR THAT GOAL. MATTHIAS!!

It's like my teenage wet dream.
Yeah, it was pretty brief but the other two definitely did.
I was actually at that game last night. Here are my thoughts:

As expected, the Marlies out shot the Amerks (22-38) and Bernier looked absolutely bored. I think this Marlies stint might be good for his confidence, but I'm not convinced it's going to better his game. He didn't seem challenged at all.

Secondly, I stuck around after the game and saw Bernier got 2nd star last night. He didn't even bother making an appearance on the ice when it was announced. I know it's a minor thing, but it's really showing his attitude.
I'm just confused as to why Babs doesn't have Reimer in net tonight. Is he still not 100%? I haven't heard.
Okay.

1. GODDAMNIT PENALTIES, FFS

2. What a fucking garbage call.
I think I love this more than anything ever. Congratulations! :')
THIS. Most brands size as 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 10... where are my large half sizes?!
Date twinsies! 

So far!

* Planning binder (a must have for me!)

* My dress (way ahead of schedule, tried it on alone, got a crazy good deal on it and couldn't pass it up)

* Locked down an officiant (one of FH's friends)

* Picked the theme/colors

* Chose bridal party members

* Designed my own invites (WIP!)

* Started contact with potential ceremony and reception sites

* Started toying around with centerpiece ideas

I may look like I'm a bit ahead of the game, but I've been engaged for a year and a half so I already had tons of ideas and did a bunch of research in my spare time before we chose a date and actually started planning.

How are things going for you? :)
Well.. mostly.. sometimes I wear them out if I'm feelin' fancy. ;)
Thank you! :D
40 hour work week and 12 credit hours this semester. Not sure what I was thinking going back to school at 25, working full time, and planning a wedding! My FH must think I'm Superwoman!

As for FH, he's working full time (four 10 hour overnight shifts) and taking 6 credit hours. He's been less involved in the planning, though.. it's really just not his thing. 
I have KP as well, but only on my arms and legs. I tried Gold Bond's "rough and bumpy skin" cream and it helped sooooo much. It's got chemical exfoliators (AHA and BHA) and while it took a little while to see results, it was definitely worth it. I'd say it might be worth your time to do a little research on it. :)
You said no jackets, but what of vests or suspenders? Garnet or dark red suspenders with gold or brass detail might add that bit of color you're looking for without adding a tie.

Off topic, but I really need to know where MOH got her dress! 
The Goldfinger cover of ["More Today than Yesterday"](https://youtu.be/xe9F5fQ4yJE).

It's perfectly us. Both of us love Goldfinger, agreed on a more upbeat song, and have been known to sing it to one another literally any time it happens to come on.
My FH and I were considering this vendor but backed out when we read on his FAQ page that the meteorite can rust. My FH isn't the most careful guy and definitely tends to forget and ultimately he thought the ring would be too high maintenance for him.
Gorgeous! So glad everything worked out (I knew it would ;) ) You did a fantastic job!
I love this SO freaking much. Just. Oh my god. Lovelovelovelove.
On the mother's FB post she says there was a note left, so it sounds like a runaway. Unless they think she's with someone dangerous, I wouldn't think an amber alert would go out for her.

My thoughts; clear gel or just water. Fabric flowers in them? They're going to be submerged, no one will be able to tell, I bet. Wrap ribbon or fabric around the vases? Add some small short candle votives (dollar or craft store would probably work)? Spray paint the top 1/3 silver or some such?

Edit for examples:

If it had been up to me, I would've picked the ball gown bottom right or aline bottom left. I'm sure your actual pick is stunning! :)
Indeed, PM me!
I'll take the a-sol if it's still available!
Sorry to bother you, but I was searching around for a dupe for Nirvana Black, did the owner of Deep Midnight ever get back to you?
I would check the fragrance notes. I'm not sure it would be D'light as it wasn't released until 2003. However, Sunwater was released in 1997. They have somewhat similar but definitely not the same fragrance notes. You could check [this](http://www.fragrantica.com/designers/Lancaster.html) site for comparison.
Hi! I believe the fragrance you're looking for might be Lancaster "Sunwater." Give it a quick Google search and see what you can find. Be careful with ordering online though, because expired product will likely not smell right.
[GiGi New York Hayden Satchel](http://www.giginewyork.com/Burgundy-Hayden-Satchel-Embossed-Python-p/hay-pyy-bur.htm). Gorgeous and pricey. Enjoy. :)
I have the oil I'd be willing to sell you, but! Amazon has both of these products with prime shipping if you'd rather have them new. [Kose](http://www.amazon.com/Kose-Softymo-Deep-Cleansing-Oil-230ml/dp/B000V2FB88/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&rps=1&ie=UTF8&qid=1443237919&sr=1-1&keywords=kose+softymo+deep+cleansing+oil&refinements=p_85%3A2470955011) and [Benton](http://www.amazon.com/Benton-content-Korean-cosmetic-beauty/dp/B00T2TLCJS/ref=sr_1_2?s=beauty&ie=UTF8&qid=1443237806&sr=1-2&keywords=benton&refinements=p_85%3A2470955011)
I actually have one that's only been used a couple times if you don't mind that. It's gorgeous, just not my color. Let me know! :)
Stick to the plan, chums! Stick to the plan!
I have nothing to add in the way of suggestions for a visitor, but make sure you're taking her collar off while she's in the crate. It'll prevent her from getting caught and hurting herself.
Memorial day was months ago. *Labor Day* is in two days.
Oh my god. That is absolutely beautiful. Love the history behind it and I'm sure it will look stunning on you!
So awesome! You're a lot more talented than I am! Also, that washi source, I needs it. 
Please tell me that's your theme! 
This may be true, but they're really great about products to take care of the skin where hair grows. 
Sidenote: this might be a good question for the dudes over at /r/wicked_edge Try searching or asking there if you don't get a solution here. :)
Dunno if it helps, but there are a few cleansing oils available on Amazon that are prime eligible!
I'm in!
Unrelated, but I am also a Rochester bride! I now feel the urge to stalk your posts (totally not creepy) for more brilliant ideas. You're fabulous to be helping out like this! :)
Strawberry rhubarb. Mmmm.
If you're worried about the veil falling flat, try a veil made of a more rigid material. Something like [this](https://www.etsy.com/listing/108786784/tulle-veil-bridal-illusion-birdcage-veil) would have some volume at the top making it to where it wouldn't lay against your face. (And hey, that one's only around $40!)

I haven't picked one yet personally- my wedding is still pretty far out.. That being said, I like browsing Etsy. They're typically cheaper than anywhere else and you can always filter for your price range. Just make sure to really do your research on shop reviews! :)
The reality of the situation is that regardless of where you choose (here, there, destination, etc..) there will ALWAYS be family and friends that will be unable to attend. You need to choose what you're comfortable with and what's best for you and your FH. At the end of the day that's what it's about anyway. I was personally struggling with a similar situation and decided that it would be "fair" to have the wedding where FH and I call home and that it'd be easier to not have to plan a wedding from 700 miles away. Good luck, I'm sure everything will turn out just fine. 
My vote is for A as well. I think it's more flattering than B, but you might get better/more accurate votes if B had better lighting. That being said, I'm sure you'll look fabulous in either! 
FH and I have decided on a astronomy/constellation/celestial.. (you get it) theme and will be doing Moon Pies with our thank you tags and [these](https://www.etsy.com/listing/103531455/the-mini-vintage-starfinder-digital-kit) super adorable miniature DIY-ish star charts for our guests. :)
Hi! My FH and I met on WoW! We're currently playing FFXIV and are also both fans of the series. We've got a modest "theme" but will be including subtle nods towards our video game love. I saw a post (maybe a week or two ago) where a couple had a chocobo cake topper, which was very cute.

Edit: [here!](https://i.imgur.com/2tfYCPv.jpg) /u/Yamamaya

Also, I'm not sure what the style of your wedding is, but you could always do something with your sweetheart table for just the two of you.
I'll take the innisfree lot :D
Any other info you can remember? Shiloutte? Material? The kind of straps it had?

EDIT: this is a long shot, but.. [3570](http://m.weddingshoppeinc.com/pr/sincerity-3570/25491) might be the right style (based on your description) Am I hot or cold?
I like #CheerstotheBaldingers! Good luck! :)

Interested in both A-sols to 14534.
Do you rest your chin on your hands at all? I used to catch myself doing it all the time and have reduced the bumps on my chin by simply not touching my face.
I  SO stoked on this. My FH and I met on WoW and are currently playing FFXIV together! I love your cake topper and hope you're enjoying Heavensward! :D
CosRX A-sol if it's still available to 14534? :)
Need, need, need! It looks great! :D
Works for me! PM me your PayPal :)
14534 :)
Oooo me me me! :D

Edit: To 14534 :D
This is correct! The red flower is the ampoule intense, the yellow is water glow, and the white/yellow is the long wear. :)
This! I ordered mine from there. Took a week to be shipped (which seems pretty standard for TK) and is on the way now. Yeeeeeeeee!!
Possibly [TherapyShoppe](http://www.therapyshoppe.com/).
Perfect, just PM me the images, the total, and your PP email and I'll F&F you. :D
Yay! 14534. :D

Edit: Also, I don't see an imgur album anymore, am I overlooking it? o:
I noticed the thread says "completed", but just wanted to check and see if the Innisfree cushion and refill were still available. Thanks! :D
I *believe* the mod you're looking for is the[Anatolian Mods Hit It BX](http://i.imgur.com/TiQoPgf.jpg). I'm not sure if it's still available, but at least you've got a lead. Hope that helps!
I need this because everyone knows you get your first pokeball for free. ;)
My corgi's name IS Link and I absolutely love this!!
I dont have anything for sale, but I'm also a porcelain neutral. Try MUFE Mat velvet in 15 or Cover FX creme foundstion in N0. If you don't mind powders or indies, check out Meow Cosmetics. They have TONS of shade options for foundation and their sample baggies are only about $1.00 each. My shade is the lightest neutral, Inquisitive Siamese.

Wasn't the biggest fan of the chocolate, but HOT DAMN that lemon cake one. Delicious.
It's really good and refreshing. Tasted more like cola than Dr. Pepper to me, but taste is subjective. I'd still give it a shot especially since he's looking for cola anyway and the prices are great, imo.
Love the Hastur idea; however, I'm personally more fond of the idea of calling it the Mordiggian RDA.
Vanilla white peach for sure.

Cumulus Mango, 20/80, 1.5mg!

Can't wait to hear the details of your new flavor! I've got my fingers crossed for something including pear! Thanks for the giveaway!
Gentleman and Voodoo juices intrigue me the most. Best wishes and good luck with your shop! 
Been looking for an awesome pear flavor! Thanks for the giveaway! :)
Flavor for days. Freakshow mini on top a Sigelei 150w. Yassssss.
Nice reviews, thanks for the insight. Not sure why you're looking for coconut in a "classic key lime pie" flavor, though.
I love surprises! Thanks! 
Dimitri, CLT v3, and Test Lab 9 Ritual in 0mg. Thank you!! :)
Haha thank you very much! The cone of shame pic was taken about a week and a half ago. Only half a week left until freedom! 
PMD is amazing! I love Bleux's stuff. If you like fruit vapes at all, check out Exotic Cactus sometime. Probably my second favorite.
As someone with both, I prefer my Sigelei. They preform just as well as eachother in terms of actual use (in my opinion), but I personally prefer the form factor and features of the Sigelei. The large fire button and the convenience of a magnetic battery cover on the Sigelei are definite pluses for me. And as far as the ipv3 goes, I dislike the springs for the batteries. They feel and look cheap and will tear your battery wraps if you're not careful. I'm also not a fan of the non-functional touch sensor that they were too lazy to remove from the design of the box itself. It's probably also worth noting that my ipv3 is currently out of commission due to a broken 510.. which *appears* to have rusted. This is likely user error on my end, but of course ymmv.

Edit: Also, the Sigelei is currently cheaper than the ipv3 (last I checked) so the Sigelei may be better for a slightly tighter budget.
PMD is my jam. Definitely recommend. :)
A pear flavor next would be AMAZING. But without coconut.. because fuck that. 
Meet Link!

Probably Amazon. No, seriously. It's re-release was exclusive to Amazon, iirc.
Instrumental version of "Eyes on Me" from Final Fantasy VIII. :)

Skin type: dry, acne/clog-prone, sensitive

Absolutely love these. I use a store brand and they're perfect. They "flaten" my pimples and prevent me from picking. They also work well over my moisturizer, wish is a definite plus.
Skin type: dry, acne/clog-prone, sensitive

Worked well for the intended purpose, but too harsh for my skin. Irritating, made my skin feel dry and tight. Works a charm for body acne, though!
Skin type: dry, acne-prone

This cleanser made my skin feel hydrated and clean, but clogged my pores and broke me out.
Not sure if this is still active, but I'm interested in the TokiDoki brushes. Price? :)
Interested in the Cinderella iridescent powder, price?
I'm not sure how much saving he'd do, he's a bit clumsy! That being said, I'm sure they'd be quite the duo, he loves new friends! :)
He's so handsome and I love the bandanna! Thank you for sharing! I bet he'd look awesome in a cloak and a decorative stud collar. (I obviously can't wait until Halloween!) :)
My cat is kind of lazy, but gets in moods where he runs around the house like crazy and plays with Link. Brewster will be 2 this month so he's a bit older than Link, but I think they're an excellent duo and definitely glad I have one of each. They're like Bert and Ernie and definitely even each other out. 
Purchased from Etsy user PupsterApparel! Hope she loves it!
Yay!! :D
I have a cat as well! His name is Brewster, though. Link's favorite playmate. :)
I think it suits him perfectly somehow. I'm glad you love it and I'm sure Link would be glad as well! He loves everyone (even strangers) and would be so excited to see you happy!
PupsterApparel on Etsy! :)
I can't wait to dress him up for Halloween! >:D
Much appreciated! PupsterApparel on Etsy is the seller I purchased the tag from. :)
Thank you very much! I purchased the tag from PupsterApparel on Etsy. :)
OH! I didn't even think of that! That would be so great!
Corgis are so great. His personality is like nothing I've ever witnessed in other breeds. They have SO much energy, though. Make sure you have the time for play and exercise! 


I'd love to hear some follow-up if/when you take the plunge! Good luck. :)
Thank you! :)
It really is such a perfect name. I bet your Link is absolutely majestic.

Thanks again! :)

Fluffy pineapple max vg 3mg sounds awesome. Thanks!!
Most recently I've been trying to mix it up, but the closest I've gotten is Bombies Kiss the Ring. Most everything else I'll think is awesome, and get tired of it after a week.. even with a juice rotation. Hopefully 2015 will be more kind!
I'd say my worst was probably trying every liquid under the sun to find an adv and that my best was probably making the switch from my Nautilus Mini to a Billow. 
My fianc√© and I both vape. We take turns placing orders for liquids and share all our rebuilding materials. :)
You'll want to try getting it out. If you have a pair of pliers, use those to very carefully unscrew it. Careful around the glass, obviously. 
Really appreciate the transparency! Good luck!
Thanks for clarifying!! :)
I think they mean the label. It's not the same style as usual Bombies labels.
Cotton is pushed up on the left one. 10 and 10.
Mermaids Tear and Crow's Milk sound delicious. I really like the names too. Good luck!! :)

Not sure if you're all set or not, but /u/murdurturtle does fantastic work. [Here's](http://imgur.com/a/FGcBk#ku6cs3a) the box I've been lusting after. I believe it's the 1590b in the color powder blue.. it's gorgeous!!

/r/murdurmod
Nice looking box for sure! Ever thought about doing customs?
Is it after you fill it? I've noticed with mine that it ~~leaks~~ practically drains all my liquid after a refill if I pump the bottle of juice (squeezing the bottle and letting go and squeezing again) because it sucks the air out of the tank and causes some weird issues with the "vacuum" way that RTAs work.

[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/JRiSPtW.jpg) my most recent build. I tuck the cotton almost in a ball under itself not really worrying about the juice channels. Just as long as it's not over the air hole at all. I watched [this](http://youtu.be/UKjemEjlPwc?t=29m3s) video (fast forwarded to the wicking part) before I got mine in the mail to try and get an idea of what I'd be dealing with and the way he wicks has worked flawlessly for me so far.
I'd absolutely be vaping it forward to a woman I work with. She was diagnosed with breast cancer and has been undergoing treatment for the past couple months. She's inquired about my vape before and I've given her tips and great local places to go for help and starter kits, but she's not yet taken the plunge. I'd love to be able to get her started.
All of them sound amazing, but I'll have to go with Strawberry Milk and Peanut Butter Cup. Mmmmmm.
Yes please!!
I've got a 30ml 3mg nic bottle of Lenola Cream. Dripped once. Might have something else of interest laying around. Let me know!
Really, really awesome of you guys!

Just in time for the holidays! Thanks for the seriously amazing giveaway! 
Shurb or strawberry astronaut 3mg! Thanks!
Atlantis and Space Jam Omega 3mg! Thanks for the giveaway! :)
Yep.
The only people that I know of who have them are those who received them in contests or were sent one to review. I ordered mine when the page said "Expected release date is 28th Nov 2014" (the site now says that the expected date is/was December 6th) and my order still has yet to ship.

If you do a quick search of this subreddit you'll see a few other posts with people looking for the Billow but none were successful to my knowledge.

I know it doesn't hurt to try, but I just thought I'd let you know that even people who pre-ordered have been waiting. Good luck!
I'll take those drip tips off your hands.
I'll take the batteries and charger if they're not already gone.
Really awesome giveaway, thanks guys!
Trade verified!
While the Lemo is a solid RTA, it's only a single coil build. If OP is looking for dual coil the Orchid is a good bet. Just sucks the tank is PC instead of pyrex or SS.
Where'd you pick that one up from, if you don't mind me asking?
Thanks! :)
Thank you! :D
(¬∞œâ¬∞)
Thanks for the sale and giveaway!
Space Jam Omega, 3mg. Thanks! :)
Not exactly "cheap", but Bombies flavors are all max VG and 25% off with the code "reddit25" right now.
I'll take it. :)
Hard to build on at all? Or just that it's better at lower builds? What's the lowest you built on it?

Sorry for all the questions, just very interested. :)
Couple questions; 1.) are these prices including shipping and 2.) is the tank on the orchid plastic or glass?
Sorry if this is off-topic, but I saw you post in a different thread (yesterday, I believe) about having some drip tips available? I can't seem to find it anymore, but I'm interested- considering my tip mysteriously fell off and disappeared while I was out and about today.

Let me know. :)
What size is the Bombies?
No problem, thanks for the response! :)
It'd be cool to see some drip tips on the site, otherwise I think it's aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate- even on mobile.

Thanks for the giveaway! :)
Everyone coming "home". Family and friends all in one place with great food and laughs.
Not OP, but judging by the labels left to right:

'Nana Cream, 'bacco B, Agent p, and Tiger Style.
As someone who eats pie filling without the crust and compote all by itself, I'd love to try Sun Goddess at 3mg. 

Thanks for the giveaway, always appreciated!
Atlantis and Milk & Honey 3mg! :)
I'm pretty sure I posted first, so if it's still available, I'll take it. :)
Definitely interested. Shoot me some pics.
Thanks for the picture, I'm interested! What version is it?
Might you be posting pics of the hana clone?
White always looks fantastic with Tiffany blue, so I'm sure that would satisfy her if you can't find an exact match. Good luck. :)
Trade verified!
Are you looking for new foundations? I've got both the KVD and Missha ones both about half full.
Pm'd
Mind sharing where it was originally purchased? Sorry for all the questions, I'll take it. :)
Thanks so much, I'm still interested. What chip does it have?
It does actually! Appreciated! I'll take it. :)
Interested in the Cana. Which chip?
What mg do you vape?
Excellent, definitely interested.
Pics of the hana clone?
I'll take it without the battery. PM'd.
Shipped? If not, what would your shipping cost to 14534 be?
Any chance I could get you to let it go for $50?
The scratch doesn't bother me too awful much, especially from far away. Which version is it and what chip does it have?

EDIT: I am certainly still interested, but might be heading to bed soon. I'll be checking back later. Thanks!
I'm interested. I'll wait on pics though. :)
TVC Hobbes' Blood for sure. :)
20off does not currently work, but 10off does. Just for anyone wondering.
Mizon mark x blemish cream! :)
I'll take it!
I might be interested in the black cana if OP passes.
Pics?
That's awesome! Pics or it didn't happen! :P
This. I usually vape 3mg anyway, but if I'm trying not to bite my nails or eat out of boredom I'll vape 0mg and it definitely curbs this. Especially if I'm vaping a dessert liquid when I'm craving sweets. 
Thank you for your thorough response! I'll put this information to good use!

Another question! Did you dress up for Halloween? If so, what did you go as? :D
Hi Mike!

Something about myself.. I am allergic to shell fish and pretty much avoid all sea food entirely? :P

I'm currently trying to get a friend with a fairly recent breast cancer diagnosis off analogs. So my question would be; what do you think is the best starter kit for an older individual looking to quit? (She doesn't even have a smart phone, so it would need to pretty low-tech, but all-in-one at the same time. I'm more than willing to help her with teaching and maintenance- so that's not an issue, but the more she can do on her own the better.)

And if I'm allowed to ask two questions; coffee or tea? And what kinds do you prefer?

Thanks! :)
My Bombies (YAY Agent P!) and TVC orders both arrived yesterday. TVC gave me tracking info, but my Bombies order didn't update the entire transit. I'm aware that can happen, but I've never experienced it before. It seemed like forever, but got here in the same amount of time it always does. :P
Coffee with my coffee! Fuzion's Joe Hipster is amazing.
It is normal to get *some* juice and to have cleaning and maintenance, but not a consistent flooding and spitting of liquid into your mouth.
Regardless, I've had to use a vision spinner II at 3.3-3.8V as a backup battery on multiple occasions with my nautilus mini and have had no issues with those lower voltages on it either.
I disagree. I use my MVP2 and nautilus mini with a 1.8ohm BVC at 3.3-3.8 volts pretty much exclusively and have never experienced this problem. That being said, I usually run my current setup at 3.8V and 9-11W.

OP, I'd personally make sure the head isn't a dud or a fake before blaming the tank or battery since the BVC coils (as good as they are) are unfortunately known to have quite a few duds. Also, make sure the head is screwed in tight (or you'll have that leaking, but not overly tight as this can cause dry hits) and be sure you're not pulling too hard on the drag. Another problem could be the liquid he's vaping. If it's very high PG, it could be that the liquid is too thin and is causing flooding.

EDIT: added some more info
Vamo v6 would be sweet, thanks! :)
I'll take MAC diva and the HG primer DS. :)
I need it in my life as well! So I did a little digging and found that it was a custom SX350 mod by /u/murdurturtle. [More pictures!](http://imgur.com/a/FGcBk#ku6cs3a)

Annnnnddd the [commission thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/MurdurMod/comments/2a9apm/sx350_mods_updates/) !!!!
The pics worked just fine for me. [https://flic.kr/p/pPZbs8](https://flic.kr/p/pPZbs8)
Thanks for the chance!
Thank you, thank you! The hashtags can be a lot to take in and having to search for specific ones can be tiresome, especially since users will use a wide variety of them to get more exposure. For example; someone would probably use #vape, #vaping, #vaper, #vapor and a load of others just to insure that no matter which one of those any other user may search for first, it's much more likely that their photo will be exposed to as many people as possible. Some users will even use irrelevant hashtags because it's a popular search term- such as something like #selfie. 
No thank YOU for the opportunity! Peachango is LEGIT. And again, thanks for the chance! :)
I use instagram, but I only have a personal account so I don't know exactly how much help I would be.

Dragon's juice @6mg sounds awesome! As always, much appreciated! :)
Much appreciated! Gogo Lychee 3mg max VG. :)
Not a single dry hit all day with the 'nana cream and a brand new BVC head. While max VG and other various high VG blends are my preference, this is my first time using the nautilus with a max VG liquid. 

Unfortunately with that being so, I don't really have extensive experience or any kind of conclusive evidence concerning the use of max VG liquids in the nautilus but.. so far so good!
Honey dragon in 3mg would be fantastic! Thanks for sharing with us! :)
My first bottle of 'Nana Cream is steeped as long as my patience will allow! (A week and a half..)

[http://i.imgur.com/UZTq3FD.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/UZTq3FD.jpg)

Spoiler alert: I've already ordered more.
Congratulations on all your hard work, I'd love to see some pics of the place!

And as always, you know how much we appreciate giveaways here! I'm seriously interested in Epicurean. I prefer high VG blends 20/80 or higher, 3mg. Thank you for the giveaway and congratulations again! Good luck with the grand opening! :)
Thank you! Very much appreciated! :)
If it's still available, I might be interested in the Vamo.
Thinking back on when I first started vaping and not being able to understand why my vivi nova tanks kept cracking (since I thought I knew it all) was frustrating then, but pretty funny now that I've moved on to better equipment. 

Awesome looking stands and thanks for the giveaway! :)
* [**Green Goddess**](http://www.drpicnics.com/product/green-goddess/) - *Dr. Picnic's Magic Elixir*

Picked this one up at my local B&M. Dr. Picnic's official website only describes the flavor as "pear jelly belly", but I get more than that. Maybe a little green apple.. kiwi? Different websites claim different flavors such as melons. It's a somewhat complex flavor, imo and has a great fresh flavor. Easily one of my favorite ADVs.


* [**Joe Hipster**](http://www.fuzionvapor.com/joe-hipster/) - *FuZion Vapor*

Coffee and breakfast. This coffee flavor with a hint sweetness (that tastes like maple syrup and reminds me of waffles) is full-bodied and lingers long after you've finished vaping it. (Yes, like coffee breath) I tire of this one more easily than other flavors, but it's my fiance's ADV so as always with juices, ymmv. Easily the best coffee flavor I've tried.


* [**The Lover**](http://www.vintagevapours.com/eliquid/vintage-e-liquids-the-lover-1936.html) - *Vintage Vapours*

Very full and fruity- no subtle fruit here. It's described as being papaya, orange, and guava and that's exactly what it delivers. Aside from the great "in your face" but smooth fruit flavor, the Zippo style packaging gives it a great experience from the second you have the bottle in your hand.

Awesome guys! Thanks for the giveaway! :)
I've been wondering this myself very recently, so I'll be keeping an eye on this thread.

My skin is sensitive to every single foundation I've ever tried. It gets dry and flaky so I distance myself from powders as most primers won't work for me either.
What's the usage like on it?
I fear that one may break me out, so I'll have to pass. Thank you for the offer, though! :)
Sample or full sized? :)
Perfect! You're fantastic, I'll PM you to verify payment. :)
$12 works for me. Do you have photos of the products? :)
I'd like to give 'em a try as a sample size. The mat velvet and estee lauder ones. It'd be easier for me to try them and sorta patch test without wasting an entire bottle. (I already have so many laying around that are unusable..) :(

I'm equally interested in both of those, so whatever sample container works best for the consistency of the product. (If that makes any sense.) Just let me know what it would be shipped to 14534. :)
Yes! Bask in our porcelain beauty and realize we cannot find a decent foundation! Hahah. Would these be samples or full sized products? If full sized, what is the usage on them? :)
Better late than never! [http://i.imgur.com/8uNqSjR.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/8uNqSjR.jpg)

(In)patiently waiting for my MVP2 and nautilus mini.
As someone from SWVA now living in Upstate NY, I am also so geeked by this.
I'd love to get my hands on some! Thanks for the giveaway!!
Is there an option for two dresses? The lace/tan for the ceremony and something short, modern, and edgy for the reception?

You really should wear whatever makes you feel beautiful, though. Everyone will be absolutely floored by how gorgeous you look in whatever dress you choose and I'm certain they won't even think about it "clashing." And hey, if the dress "clashes", you'll stand out more as the bride. No blending into the theme for you, which is something I've worried about when it comes to my wedding.. I'm the bride, not part of the decor!!
Thanks for your reply! I'll take the Vamo off your hands. PMing you! 
Interested in the Vamo, I'd like some extra pics of the scratches though if you wouldn't mind. Also seconding the question about shipping price.
Perfect! $57 total? Do you prefer invoice or friends and family via PP?
It indeed does! What would price with shipping be to 14534? :)
I'm interested if this hasn't already sold.
All awesome offers for the giveaway. Count me in. :)
Been eying the Aspire Nautilus and haven't picked it up yet. I'd love to give it a try!
They could always put the symbol AND the word corresponding. It might defeat the purpose of symbols at all, but I think the symbols are a cute touch. 
YAY! I'm so glad someone also shares my experience. It was so strange. In the back of my mind I thought, "What in the world am I doing with a wedding dress on?" and then it turned into, "I'm not taking it off!" 

I also see you're a planner? That's awesome. It's something I've always wanted to pursue, I just never knew how to go about it.
Thank you so much. I truly do appreciate your words of kindness and encouragement! Let's be excited! :D
Thank you, thank you! I can't wait to see how well it fits once I get it perfectly tailored for me. :)
Thank you! It really does mean a lot! :)
Internet high five! I'd love to see your dress! I'm sure it's amazing! And congratulations to you as well! :)
Thank you! Fortunately the sash wasn't an extra expense, as it's part of/sewn on the gown! :)
Missed opportunitiessssssss. Unfortunately I just used an iPhone app to slap those bows on my face because I wasn't near a real computer. Maybe next time! Hahaha.

Thank you so much! :)
Thank you so much! :)
Thank you for coming out of hiding for me. I appreciate the gesture and compliment! Thank you, thank you! :) 
Thank you so much! I feel like at least $6k in it, anyways. ;)

You said that you sell gowns? Do you work at a bridal salon? It means a lot getting opinions like that, since I didn't get any while I was shopping!
Thank you, I do appreciate all the kind words! Like I had said in an earlier comment, all of you are making me feel so much better about the planning process. :)
Thank youuuuu!! :)
I KNOW, RIGHT?
Thank you! I really didn't think I was the "type of girl" who could just fall in love with a dress, but I was so wrong. I don't know what I was thinking! 

*so hawt*. :)
Ahhhh!!! All of this excitement from my fellow wedditors has really helped my wedding planning mood! Thank you so much! :D
Thank you! :D
Awww! Thank you so much! You should've seen the goofy smile on my face reading your comment!
Oh, that's awesome! FH and I have a friend that goes to Philly all the time, I'll have to convince him to take us next time! :)
Thank you for clarifying! :)
It issssss! I will absolutely do that for you! How far away are you now? :(
Thank you so much! I'm just so excited! 

It's funny, though.. because if you had shown me it on a model or a photo of it online beforehand, I seriously would've probably stuck my nose up at it. I never thought that would be the right style for me! Shows how much I know! ;)
Thank you, thank you!!! We can be excited together!!
Yeah, it's this strange Goodwill "Boutique" they have a lot of nice stuff there and sometimes you can find good deals.. other times it's a rip. ($50 for a shirt at the Goodwill? I don't pay that price ANYWHERE..)


Anyway! They really do have a great selection (if you didn't notice all the dresses in the background of my photos). The one that is nearest to me is in Pittsford, NY. I'm not sure if there are others like it anywhere else, perhaps some quick googling would help! :)
EDIT: The woman working the salon and other very nice patrons are who took the photos for me. :)


Some backstory and detail, I suppose: 


**Backstory:**


A little over 2 years ago I moved to Upstate NY to be with my now FH. I really like it here and I'm very glad I made the move. That being said, my family (all of whom live in VA) seem to act like a wedding isn't even happening since it's not geographically close to them.


I get that it's hard to be excited about something when it's so far away (geographically *and* time-wise; i.e. a 2 year engagement), but I've asked my parents on many occasions to dress shop with me (whether it be in NY or VA) and none of them seem interested either way. I've tried on dresses alone before, but I never found anything I liked and I always thought that my dislike might be because I didn't have my parents' approval and dismissed them.


**Details:**


I had a day to myself away from my FH and decided I wanted to go thrifting. Not with the intent of finding a dress, but just some cute skirts or maybe some random jars and vases for my centerpieces, who knows?


After shopping the Goodwill a bit, and not finding any centerpiece items of interest, I headed to the women's clothing at the rear of the store. I found a few things to try on and to the dressing rooms I went. Upon arriving I ran into a fellow bride that had a group of people helping her try on dresses and proceeded into my room with the words, "Should I?" in the back of my mind followed by "Nahhh.. my mom's not even here.." as I shut the curtain. As I'm trying on my selected items, I couldn't help but continue to think about the dress the woman in the room next to me was wearing when I overhear, "No, I don't like it. It's too plain, I'm taking it off." My heart skips a beat as I think, "Now I just *have to*."


So... I did. I was immediately in love. I didn't want to take it off. I texted the photo to my parents and sent a message to my FH saying, "Oh.. FH... what would you think if I bought a dress today..?" to which he replied, "A dress? Like, a dress-dress or like.. THE dress?" and I was like, "THE dress." His response was more or less, "If you love it sweetie, it's yours." (Side note here; I would've called him because it would've been more personal, but he was at work) I walk around in the dress to get a feel for it (and again, because I didn't want to take it off) while I nervously wait on responses from my mom, my dad (who are divorced) and my FMIL (whom I get along with VERY well, thank goodness). And.. the verdict is that ALL of them absolutely love it!


So ladies and gents of Weddit, I did it! I said yes to the dress!
It's a [Jacquelin Exclusive gown](http://www.missesdressy.com/dresses/designers/jacquelin-exclusive/19875) #19875. I inquired as to how it ended up at the Goodwill with original tags (tags that say $1,495- holy shit) and I was told that it was a sample gown from a bridal store that no longer has that style. Upon my inspection, I think it's in perfect condition. No missing jewels or buttons.. no weird stains or rips. It's perfect! I paid around $160 for my gown and I seriously couldn't be happier. It IS my size, but of course it'll need a few alterations. I don't have a clear picture of the back, but I'll see if I can get one once I get it more fitted. It has a chapel length train, I believe.


When it comes down to it, I am just so, **SO** glad dress shopping with my family didn't work out, because going alone helped me save money and sanity. I'm so over the moon, so I'm very sorry for the wall of text! :)
So, so, so beautiful! I'm an Upstate NY bride as well! I've been on and off looking for a photographer, but I haven't gotten into full-blown wedding planning yet. Congratulations! :)
This! Asian sunscreens are very popular on /r/skincareaddiction as well! 
I've chosen "Daughter" by Loudon Wainwright III for mine. :)

It's more upbeat than most songs and is still nice without being too sappy, in my opinion.

That being said, I agree with /u/StrawberryStef. Since you have similar taste in music, narrow it down for him and let him pick from there. I'm sure it'll be much easier to find something you both love that way!
The 7th is my birthday! That being said, my cousin is getting married on the 6th!~

ALL the celebrations! :D
I want the Holika Holika BBs!
Haha the SPF one is the "protect" one iirc. Sorry.

I'm ready now! :D
And the Laura Mercier Foundation Primer protect sample if it's not already spoken for?

Thank you for your patience, I've been at work! :)


Hourglass mineral primer sample, MUFE mist & fix sample and ummm...
Black pearl mask and glamglow sample! Still looking for minimum. :)
It's Queen Helene. [Here's](http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?productId=prod5022025) a product link! :)
Stridex didn't make me extra dry or flaky, but it did cause my face to feel tight and squeeky, personally.

You could start with a more gentle exfoliant like an AHA (lactic acid) such as the St. Ives scrub free pads if you're concerned about trying the Stridex. [Here's](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/wiki/exfoliation_recs) the link to the sidebar exfoliation recommendations and information.

As always, be sure to patch test! :)
I do this sometimes! My favorite thing to do is use a sheet mask when my SO isn't home and randomly text him a picture of me wearing it (making a creepy face, of course) mid-conversation. I'll also text him photos if he's in another room so I can hear him go, "WTF!" Hahaha.
Vaseline prevents moisture loss and most people use it over a moisturizer, not usually alone.

Anecdotal so ymmv, but all of those products caused whiteheads and comedones for me as well. I was doing some research to try and cut out any possible irritants from my routine (because I didn't think it could possibly be my moisturizer that was breaking me out) and found that a lot of the produts I was using contained Cetyl/Cetearyl/Stearyl Alcohol. [This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/1ufvym/megalisting_products_without_cetylcetearylstearyl/) helped me tremendously. I started with Nivea creme as it was the most affordable to test (I got a travel size tin from Wegmans for around $1) and had really good results. I would absolutely try what /u/sept27 said and compare ingredients, as everyone is different! As always, make sure you patch test carefully when trying new products.. even if it is difficult to do when you can't find a good moisturizer.

Good luck!
My fianc√© has really great skin although he never does anything special (not fair, I know) but he gets curious especially after seeing and trying to help me with my skin struggles and really wanted to put the "minty stuff" on his face. I'm jealous.. we didn't make cookies... maybe next time! :)

edit: grammar
I picked mine up at Ulta for around $3-4. :)
I know exactly how hard it can be to find a good matching foundation so I'm really glad you found something that works for you! Let me know if you change your mind or get curious again. My offer still stands! :)
I'm not willing to let my whole bottle go, but if you're looking to try the shade, I'd be more than willing to send you a sample of my Missha perfect cover #13. Let me know and we can work something out. :)
Exactly. Even going as far as giving veteran players priority for beta access, as well as everything else you've mentioned.
Do you prefer invoice or gift? :)
I'll take the Benton and the green tea mask. :)
Today I stress picked some spots that were healing as a result of having to make last minute travel plans due to my grandfather's passing yesterday. I finally calmed myself down, but not after undoing most of my progress.

My worry stone (and other fidget toys) are an absolute godsend.
I'm going to bed now. I'll be awake in approx. 6 hours. If someone else really wants it during that time, I'll pass to them. Thanks!
I can do that! :)
Porefessional to 14534? :)
I'd do some research before checking it out. There a lot of different oils and not all of them are for everyone.
Intrested in porefessional, slightly confused by the wording. Is the $15 minimum for international orders only or am I just really confused?

Thanks!
Not OP, but would you know how the bright fit in 02 compares to the cotton fit in color? I've been really curious and the swatches online aren't very helpful. :(
The only reason I ask is because I got [this](http://i.imgur.com/J49Szhx.jpg) when I searched my area.

Good luck again!

edit: link
I can't find anywhere that says it's *actually* been discontinued. The Sephora site says it's just out of stock. It doesn't say it's been discontinued on the MUFE website either. Have you called around to any of your local Sephora stores to see if they might have it?

Also be sure to check Sephora.com. Click the color you're looking for and then type in your zip code in the box where it says "Find in Store" (to the right of the swatches) to see if they have it in any stores in your area.

You may also be able to get some other MUE/MUAers to check their local stores for you as well. Heck, I'll even make some calls for you if I can find it and you'd like to do an even exchange for it.

Good luck and let me know! :)
Haha no worries. Thanks! :)
I was also interested in the velvet face primer but I didn't see a price or it pictured. I'll keep looking! Thanks! :)
I'd love the asian skincare lot if it's still available! :)
I'll just do the pouf, I have enough mascara laying around. Thank you! :)
How much would it be if I inculded the better than sex mini? :)
Intrested in the petite pouf!

Edit: also still kinda looking :)
Out of curiousity, do you have an exact date picked? I've been trying to scope out pricing of venues in the area (JUST venues no caterers or bakeries or anything yet) and no one seems to be able to take me seriously since I don't have an *exact date* picked out.

I've even specifically asked for a certain amount of people and what the price differences would be when you compare Saturday to Friday and Sunday, but still nothing.

My friends and family keep telling me I'm going about all of this extremely backwards, but I'm going to be paying for a lot (if not all of it) myself and I need time to budget, plan, and save. I haven't lived in this area long enough and this is definitely my first time planning a wedding, so quotes would *really* help.. if I could get anyone to take me seriously.
I need this in my life. I know it's a long shot, but if you still have it and are willing to sell instead of swap, let me know.
I came in here just to make sure that the biggest reason this was upvoted is because it's a photo and not a screenshot.

Not that it isn't hilarious, just making sure the internet is running as usual.
Maybe. Do you have a photo of it? :)
I can certainly do that! :)
Interested in the Tonymoly BB and the Holika Holika BB shipped to the US? What would the price for those look like? :)
I just wanted to make note that *I* was the one interested in angelic. I also posted first.
Am I the only one who sees a weird female Draenei Doctor Manhattan?

Yes? Okay..
I just wanted to take a moment to tell you that I like your design more than any of the other sailor moon hoodies I've seen on the entire internet.

(And that I would also buy a Venus one in a heartbeat!)
Eep! I was asleep! Still available? :s 
Congratulations on finding your dress! It's gorgeous!

Just a thought, but have you considered a veil in a similar style to the ones you're interested in, but perhaps with black lace trim instead? Like [this one](https://www.etsy.com/listing/159350989/faerie-black-and-white-wedding-veil-with?ref=market)? I'm just not certain I think a tiered veil is suited for that particular dress- it seems like they would clash style wise.

Maybe it's just me, but I always take budget into consideration first. How important is it and how much am I willing to spend on it? Next, I typically decide what I DON'T want. It makes it easier to narrow it down and pinpoint exactly what it is I'm looking for. After that it's basically process of elimination.

I can't wait to see what you choose! Good luck!

EDIT: grammar
My SO is exactly the same way, but on the same coin- he's extremely supportive of the struggle. He doesn't 100% understand (his skin is seriously perfect with a quick rinse in the shower and very rarely a bit of moisturizer), but he just wants me to feel as beautiful as he knows I am.. which really does help with my emotional self-consciousness. Just know that he 100% means it.

Also, I've gotten into a habit of announcing when I have a treatment or bandage on my face before he sees me, because he *always* insists on letting me know that "I have something on my face." He never says it jokingly and always looks so serious. I tend to just look at him and go, "OH MY GOD WHERE?" Haha. :P
Not OP, but I'm interested in angelic. :)
Watt's up and tarte smoldereyes, please! :)
Second for sunny Seoul, please! Also skinfood gloss for the $10 minimum if sunny seoul falls through. :)
I really love the lighter shade. It doesn't try to compete with your beautiful bright eyes and compliments your skintone gorgeously.
How would you feel about.. $23 shipped for the two?
High beam and marshmallow bunny!

EDIT: Usage on marshmallow bunny? I saw you said the high beam was only swatched?
Perfect! :)
I know this is a tad old, but how much for tarte dollface?

(If it's even still available. :P)
Oh there certainly is! It's the Sailor Moon Miracle Romance Moon Stick Lipstick! (Try saying that 5x fast!) I have it and it's still BNIB.. I can't bring myself to use it! I can grab a picture of it when I get home from work.. or you can google it. It's a lip balm tube as the moon stick handle with a cap shaped like the top. It's too cute, seriously.

I believe they just recently came out with a set of two that are like the Moon Stick one except they're for Uranus and Neptune. I don't have those, but I'm seriously considering trying to get my hands on them.

Did you know there's also eyeliner?! They come in sets as well and they're called the "Star Power Prism eyeliner." There are two different sets and each set has one pencil, one liquid, and one lam√© (which I think is glittery) liner.

Sorry for the long post, these things make me very excited!!
I'm glad you enjoyed it as well, I've seen mixed reviews. I expected that as well, though.

I would've loved to share them with you all! I made too many for myself.. I ended up taking them to work and giving them away there! :)
Aw thank you so much! They were fun! (And yummy, of course!) :D <3
Hello! Nice to meet you! :)

Just out of curiosity- what's your skin like? Foundations are my favorite with indie lippies being a close second! 

EDIT: Also! Have you tried Rimmel Kate Moss in 110? It's called vibrant coral and it's GORGEOUS. 
I really enjoyed the episode! It was exactly what I was expecting and I'm still very excited for the coming episodes. It's got a really great feel (true to the manga with some nods to the original anime thrown in) and I think the animation/art style is wonderful. How did you like (or dislike?) it?

As for the effort, I love baking and decorating sweets and while it did take a bit to get all of the pieces done, I was super pleased with the outcome! I think the only thing I'd change for next time is to use a different method for the frosting so it comes out looking smoother. :)
I used fruit by the foot "flavor mixers." They look like [this](http://i.imgur.com/yPVqldN.jpg). I was unable to find plain fruit roll ups without tongue tattoos or full sized fruit by the foot that wasn't tye dye colored, but I think the tiny strips from the mixers worked out perfectly for cookies!

When you try it out, let me know! I would love to see!!
Thank you! They were also quite fun, although a bit tedious! :)
Thank you! My SO and I have been enjoying them! I wish I could share!!
I do! I sadly do not own one, however. :(

I do have the Moon Stick lipstick (balm), though! I just don't use it. :)

EDIT: I love your username!! 
The Neutrogena is a chemical sunscreen. [Here's](http://www.skinacea.com/products/sunscreens.html#.U7jYt4m9LCQ) a really great resource from Skinacea on some of the most popular brands/options. :)
It's nice to meet you as well! :)

It's so good! Which character do you like to play?
Oh.. I'm sorry to get your hopes up. I would've been REALLY excited too!
Thank you! I know, right? I've waited most of my childhood and all of my adult life for this! The only downside is that it's only every other Saturday. :(
Hiya! Thank you and thank you! I watched it at 6am (EST) and did not wait for my SO.. oops. :P
Thank you! :)
Haha so awesome! As silly as it is, I love the Pom bottles too! They're very pleasing to the eye and sit really well in my hand. I also really like the box in the second picture. So metallic and pretty! I would put something like that on my phone as a case. Hahah. :)
I don't typically use anything that'll make me matte, as I'm typically dry and prefer a dewy look. What's your favorite sunscreen currently? I've only tried Neutrogena Dry-Touch and it's been working really well for me.

As for Asian BBs, I've only tried a few, but the Asian ones are the only ones that work for my very pale skin. I've yet to find one that's sold in the US that's light enough for me and doesn't make me look orange.

I really like the Missha Perfect Cover BB and the Skin 79 VIP gold. I've also tried the Missha M Vita BB Cream (Moisture) and the Skin 79 pink, but I find that they don't quite oxidize right on me and turn out somewhat orange. All of them give a great finish and don't break me out, even though they're not quite the right shade for me. I'd be willing to do some swatches if you're interested! :)
I've been trying to get through BL2.. because, well.. as fun as it is, I tend to get motion sick from FPS style games. ):
Hello and thank you! 

I currently work in an office that handles Medicare appeals. Not fun. :(

OOOOHH... I find that I frequently keep boxes and other various packaging as well. I'd love to see some of your favorites! 

Until something prettier catches my eye; Kat Von D Lock-It Tattoo Foundation, Tony Moly Cat's Wink lipstick, and my most favorite; the Etude House Etoinette Heart Blusher. Too cute!!
Hiya antixtina! Thank you!

Right now I'm very much in love with my Missha perfect cover BB cream in #13 and my Coty airspun loose powder in naturally neutral. Perfect for summer!!

How about you? (:
Thank you! ^___^

I've been playing the Siren with my fiance playing Assassin on Steam. (Got it on sale, awwwwh yeah.)
Yes. Just.. yes.
She did request that others  "make an offer" on the items- which hasn't been done either. I don't think it's distasteful to reiterate the point that she's looking for people to make offers on it by simply asking them what they think is a fair price.
Indeed it is! Missha Perfect Cover BB in #13, Milky Beige. Which, btw- the Missha US website is having their semi-annual sale. The perfect cover BB cream is 50% off! I think they're already out of stock of #13, though. ):
I'm sure yours is beautiful! What do you use for organization on it or in the cabinet and drawers? 
No problem, enjoy! :)
Good luck! I hope one turns up for you! :D
She may have layered foundation/concealer or a nude liner underneath it.
I bought it from a man who posted it on Craigslist in my area. He actually had a matching 3 drawer dresser, night tables, a 5 drawer dresser, and a sitting chair of some sort. I would've loved to have had all the pieces, but it just wasn't in the budget right now. ):
[Here's](http://i.imgur.com/qwcXy8M.jpg) the Shiro Cosmetics "Why not Zoidburg?" intertube on me. It's literally my favorite!! (Sorry for weird lighting and crap quality.)
I knowww. I bought a sample before the full sized stuff came out and fell in love. I waited until the semi-annual sale to pick up more, though. ;)
Thank you so much!! I'm so excited!
Shiro Cosmetics intertube in Leeroy Jenkins. (:
Tracked down the original [photo](http://i.imgur.com/5IZ9GMv.jpg) on 0xJenn's instagram. It's MAC Embrace Me.
Thanks for the guide/list update!

Sidenote: Your BOSS link is broken. (:
So awesome! I've been wanting to take the plunge, myself.

Question, though. Is that a cowlick in your before picture or is it just the way you have your hair pushed back? My cowlick is what's preventing me from getting a fringe cut of my own!
Beer. Coffee. Food.
1.) You say she doesn't answer you honestly. What is her answer? I'm not a mind reader, but that would help me get a better understanding of her position.

2.) Are blowjobs something *you* bring up? Or is she the only one who ever talks about it?
To keep someone you care about oblivious just so you can keep them around is ridiculously selfish.
You should be looking for women in places that interest you. Do you like coffee joints, festivals, libraries, book stores, comic book or video game shops, museums? You don't want to seek women out based on what *they* like and then have nothing in common with them.

EDIT: The above list are the places I prefer to go when I'm not on my couch watching Netflix or playing video games- to simply answer your question.
Having anxiety disorder, I feel the need to know what my fianc√©'s schedule is like for the day. Not every last detail or anything- like "Okay so, I need to know when you're using the bathroom and when you're having a snack and.." or anything like that, but if he has somewhere to be or something to do- I like to know about it. It also super stresses me out when his schedule changes at the last minute or if he forgets to tell me things.

I do acknowledge to him that I know it can be a little stressful on him because of the way I act and that I'm working on it. He's been very patient with me.

EDIT: Also, I don't mind him having friends over when I'm not home (since we live together) or having a drink or two, but I like to know when people are in my apartment and I don't want to come home from work to find you shitfaced.
Destress by playing some video games followed by turning on really loud music and the usual getting ready routine. (Which includes many of the previous posts; shaving, changing my outfit too many times, primping, etc.)
**Physically:** [my lips](http://i.imgur.com/pF2Cuqj.jpg)

**Mentally:** My attitude while gaming (Most think I'm just another one of the guys)
Hated mac & cheese my entire childhood. Grew up to find out that the real dislike was american cheese and that mac & cheese can be made with different/better cheeses. Yum!
When you've touched, moved, studied the label of, or used my makeup or other beauty products such as my skin or hair care stuff and have tried to put it back in it's exact position discretely.

We don't care unless it was very expensive and you're "wasting it." Such as; squirting it out just so you can see it or smell it out of the bottle.

Just tell us you used it or that you're interested. We like it when you're genuinely curious about stuff that we do/use. Seriously.
DW frost death knight. The one thing I like about DKs that I didn't like at first is (obviously) runes and the way they work. I didn't like them because I didn't understand them. I love it now, though! Makes every other class feel weird. DK wasn't my first class/toon, but it definitely become my favorite!

Side note: the one thing I dislike about DKs that I STILL don't like.. is the starting zone. xP
Like /u/obliquepeach said, KVD light 42 will be back in the fall! Until then, I would suggest Cover FX cream foundation in N0.. as that's what I had to do when I ran out of KVD 42. Good luck and mark your calendar! 
AAAHHH Thank you!! Might you know when places may have it again?
Awesome! PM me your paypal (: Do you prefer gift payment?
Would you take $26 shipped for it? Seems about right for the usage. Not sure if it'd be different since it's been discontinued. Let me know!
I'm interested. I really can't tell the usage. Do you know how many times you may have used it?
I was sooo thinking the same thing! "There's no way anything with cocoa in it is gonna be light enough for me!" Hahah.
That's actually the color I have in my hair right now! It was very easy to do (the mousse), but I found that it took a lot longer than just slapping color on my head. Trying it a couple different ways, I found that (for once!) following all the instructions on the detailed pamphlet provided was the way to go.

I really loved the outcome and everything was very evenly colored (no patches or streaks); however, mine fadeded/washed out quite a bit- even with proper care. It faded to look a lot lighter and a lot more red, but I really like it and I'm due for another color soon anyway. Here's an [album](http://imgur.com/a/ck3Sd) (hopefully that link works) of how mine faded. Weird timing though- the first and last pics in the album are exactly a month apart.

EDIT: I should probably note that before the dye I was a natural medium-darkish brown.
I'm going to be recieving the liner in my bag. Do you think it would help to put it somewhere to cool down for a short amount of time before opening it?
Really not sure why I'm being downvoted without receiving CC. If you don't think it looks good, let me know why please!! I can't improve if I don't know what's wrong. Thanks! (:
Not really, as I tend to feel guilty when I spend a lot on myself. That being said- since I've found MUA I've also found my HG foundation at Sephora.. which just so happens to be $42 for only .33oz. Oops. :P
Using the brush in my above post, I used a very tiny amount of liner ONLY on the pointy tip to draw my "outline." I'm also still new to wings and gel liner, so I was nervous and wanted to start small.

EDIT: OH. And tightlining the lid. Also that.
Thank you! I used the Sephora angled liner brush that came with [this](http://i.imgur.com/kefl4L9.jpg) brush set with e.l.f. cream eyeliner.

Disclaimer: I don't know if the e.l.f. cream liner I bought has any staying power, as I bought it because I needed something cheap to practice with and didn't wear it long.
Thank you!! The shape is what I was most worried about. I feel like  my eye creases quite a bit in the outer corner, so it's been really hard to figure out the technique that works best for me. I'm honestly clueless about my eye shape.

Concerning the dramatic wing; I have tried with liquid liner before, but I just couldn't get it as sharp as I wanted. It ended up being a very fat wing. (If you could call it that.) I will most likely experiment more with gel liner this weekend!
I was going to suggest Tarte's BB tinted treatment 12-hour primer.. buttttt.. 

Hm.. have you tried the Bobbi Brown oil-free tinted moisturizer? Comes in 8 shades, I believe.
I keep my boxes just because I like the way they look. It gives all my makeup a uniform look when they're stored away. It also keeps the bottles/tubes/compacts from getting dirty.

Or it could be that I'm just some sort of strange neat-freak. Either or. :P
I know I just posted this above, but warm shades are always too orange/yellow/golden for me and I found that Cover FX makes a cream foundation that was an absolute godsend for my fair, neutral-toned skin. I wear the shade N0 and it's perfect. I don't know if you're fair like me, but I think their line is definitely worth a look. Lots of shade selection.

EDIT: Grammar
Cover FX total cover cream foundation in P10 (pink) or N0 (neutral). I know you said cool-toned, but the N0 is paler than the P10 and they don't make the P10 in a lighter shade.
I'm going to 100% agree with you on the NYX Taupe. UGH. 

That being said, the NYX Wonder Stick that has a taupe end is seriously something I'm going to need.
I'm almost forced to be brand loyal when it comes to foundations that work with my skin. I'm very, *very* fair, dry and acne prone and there are few foundations that are light enough and don't break me out.

That being said, anything else is fair game! If it's pretty and I like putting it on my face, I'll buy it. I don't really care what's on the label. 
I recently ordered Leeroy Jenkins and Why Not Zoidberg and now you've got me more excited for them arriving than I already was! Great look!!
Also not OP, but here's a list of white foundations (that I know of) in order of cheapest to most expensive:

* Manic Panic Dreamtone Foundation in Virgin White (1oz/30ml $12)

* OCC Skin Airbrush Foundation in White (4oz/120ml $25)

* MAC Face and Body in White (4oz/120ml, $35)

* Face Atelier Ultra Foundation in Zero Minus (1oz/30ml $48)

* Illamasqua Rich Liquid Foundation in 100 Pure White **OR** Skin Base Foundation in 01 White (Both are 1oz/30ml and ~$50)

Unfortunately I've never the Manic Panic one in stores, so you'd probably have to order it online, but it does have the drugstore price.

I suppose it's also worth noting that I didn't include "clown makeup" or costume/stage makeup in this list as I don't think they're suitable for everyday wear.

EDIT: Added one. (:
I found that while I do favor neutral in my skintone (so obviously I'm 
going to be a bit biased because the N0 is a better match for *me*), the P10 was still not light enough to even be considered.
Could you do.. the UD 24/7 eyeliner in Rockstar, Dr. Jart BB Mini, Kat Von D Lock-It Foundation 42, and OCC Lip Tar Psycho.. $15 shipped? (:
As far as foundation goes:

* Cover FX total cover cream foundation in N0 (Sephora, medium-full coverage)
* Revlon ColorStay (Normal/Dry) in 110 Ivory (Drugstore- I get mine at Wegmans, medium coverage)
* Missha Perfect Cover BB cream in #13 Milky Beige (Korean brand, light-medium coverage)
* Tarte BB Tinted Treatment 12-Hour Primer in Fair 00 (Sephora- tinted moisturizer, sheer-light coverage)

I haven't made much headroom in the concealer department, but:

* NYX Concealer Wand in Porcelain CW01 (Anywhere NYX is available)
* Hard Candy Glamoflauge in Ultra Light (Walmart)

And as for powders, I've realized that us pale girls are better off using a translucent. Hope this helps!

EDIT: Added in the Tarte, almost forgot!
Looking for the Kat Von D sample in 42. Let me know if it's still available. (:
What foundation are you currently wearing? I'm super fair skinned and might have some suggestions for you. (:
I came in here to make this exact comment, I swear. My fiance would be ALL OVER anything that has the word "DOMINATION" in bold, capital letters on the packaging. Hahaha.
Not exactly "fake geek girl", but a little something on women in geek culture. [This one](http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/04/27/306853264/gaming-while-male-a-privilege-few-men-recognize) hit a little close to home for me.
Seconding. It looks identical.
Ah, it's okay! As long as I've reminded a few people that didn't know (or had forgotten) like me, I don't really care about the internet points. (:
Guess I'm a little slow. Thanks for the heads up, though. (:
I couldn't find them at all on the site for a while now (even with the search function) and thought they were just.. gone. I know it sounds silly, but when I stumbled upon them and saw they were being discontinued AND on sale I wondered, "Why didn't I see this on Reddit.." Perhaps there are others like me! :P
Haha. Finding 111 was sheer luck for me. I was originally after 110 (something a little more toned down and coral-y), but couldn't find it and started scoping out the other shades instead.

Shameless is such a beautiful shade, but I'm soooo afraid of purples. I adore them on everyone else, but I'm afraid with my fair skin and dyed auburn hair, that I'd end up looking like a martian or something. Such a silly fear, I know.. but someday I'll be brave enough. Especially considering that not only do I love makeup, but I'm a daily World of Warcraft player and now I *just have to have* Leeroy Jenkins. It's beautiful and I love the name! Thanks for the tip! ;)
Oh, you'll have to fill me in on some of your favorite purples too! I don't think I'm brave enough for that yet!

Of course! I probably should've put it in my original post. It's Rimmel Kate Moss (red packaging, I believe that means matte) in 111 "Kiss of Life". (:
The swatches are beautiful and I ADORE the packaging. I'm glad you got your hands on it! Buying and wearing my red made me feel so incredibly sassy. Like I could do anything and wouldn't take crap from anyone! It was great!
I am so happy you found your confidence! I'm sure reds look absolutely stunning on you. I've been eyeing those velvetines for a while now and have seen swatches online, but have never seen them in person to get a real idea of how they'd look on me. I guess I'm not quite brave enough yet!
Your first red at 15 and I'm over here trying them for the first time at 23! All joking aside, I love that. All sorts of warm fuzzies! I also checked out some swatches of it, it is most certainly a Head Bitch Red‚Ñ¢. I'm sure you rocked it!
Really doubting the highlight side will be light enough for my super fair skin, but the taupe side on the light stick? GIMME. 
It was no problem, glad to help! I just hope it worked out for you. I know how big of a pain it can be to find a great foundation. 

P.S. Sorry it took me so long to respond. I didn't seem to get a notification for your reply.
I've never tried a full on fringe, which is something I'm definitely interested in. It's probably also worth noting that I now work in an office and unfortunately the beautiful, brightly colored hair isn't allowed. I'm really open to any styles, however.

EDIT: Also also, most hair makes me look very young, so I'm kind of looking for something potentially more grown up, but definitely still fun. I'll be 24 in 3 months, though most will say I don't look like it.
Well, I haven't seen a response, so I'll take the two of them if that's okay! Just let me know the total shipped. (:
I'll give her time before taking the primer. Definitely still want the too faced, though. (:
Did /u/elizastarbucks24 pass on the primer? I'd love to have them both!
What's the size of the Tarte primer?

Edit: 2nd for the tarte primer.

If I get the primer, I'll get the Too Faced Who's Your Poppy for the limit. If not, thanks anyway. (:
The "1W2 Sand 36" shade from Thailand should be the same shade as the "1W2 Sand" one from the US. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/upmy4rX.jpg) is a side by side comparison of the two shades from each respective official Estee Lauder website.

I would suggest finding your nearest retailer of Estee Lauder to try that shade out just to be sure. (:

EDIT: grammar :s
Absolutely! 

Edited: too early for me (:
Interested in buying the Too Faced Better Than False Lashes set. (:
Interested in the Missha M Vita B.B Cream (Moisture). What do you think of $10 for it?
Interested in the Skin79 tube samples. Both the hot pink and the gold. (:
Interested in purchasing the Skin79 BB cream. (:
I know this post is a bit old, but if you still have the Missha #13 and wouldn't mind selling it instead of swapping, I'm interested. (:
I am so ridiculously and inexplicably interested in this product. Now to decide if I want to take a gamble and order it or wait to find it in stores..
The CoverFX is a little pricey, but the Glamoflauge and Missha BB creams shouldn't be too expensive. (:
I'm *very* pale. Even NARS Chantilly, MAC NC/W10, and theBalm's "lighter than light" concealer are too dark and yellow-y/orangy on me. 

I'm not sure what's available to you, but if you can get them I highly recommend:

* CoverFX concealer in N X-Light

* CoverFX cream foundation in N0

* Hard Candy Glamoflauge concealer in Ultra Light

* Missha Perfect Cover BB cream in #13

All of those products are neutral tones and don't have any orange or yellow on me whatsoever. That being said, from one pale person to another; good luck and let me know what you find!
My fianc√® trys his hardest to at least pretend to be intrested in my makeup. 

He'll point to a specific product and ask me about it and as I'm talking about the colors and features and uses he just looks at me and nods his head and goes "Ohhhhhh.. okay!" and "Hmm.." 

He then usually follows that with, "Okay so how about <points to a different product> this? That goes on your eyes, right?"

Also, in conversation he regularly gets mascara and eyeliner confused. (Close enough, right? Haha.)

It's all really adorable, tbh.
Could you swing a neutral instead of the pink tones in CoverFX? They make a lighter concealer in the neutrals called N X-Light. It's descirbed as being "for porcelain to light skin with neutral undertones."


As someone with very, very fair (that even the NARS Chantilly is too dark and yellow-y), as well as sensitive and acne prone skin it works perfectly for me! Not to mention that CoverFX cream concealer in N0 is my HG. It has great coverage and ingredients! Good luck and congratulations on your upcoming nuptials!
Thank you so much. You really are too kind! :) Are there any specific tutorials or products you would suggest? The biggest thing keeping me from doing 'em is the fear of messing them up. Thanks again!
Product list:

**Face:**


* Revlon Colorstay (for Normal/Dry) in 110 Ivory 


* MUFE Full Cover Concealer in 1 Pink Porcelain (I feel like this may not be quite the right shade for me, kind of orange-y.)


* Nyx HD Studio Finishing Powder in Translucent


* Rimmel Match Perfection Blush in 002 Light/Medium


* Too Faced Chocolate Soleil in Medium (from May Ipsy)


**Eyes:**


* Nyx Super Skinny Eye Marker in Black


* Nyx La Amourex Mascara in Black


* Pacifica Eyeshadow Duo in "Duo 1" (from May Ipsy again)


**Lips:**


* Maybelline Baby Lips in 05 Quenched (Clear balm)


* Nyx Butter Lipstick in 03 Snow Cap



I'm not really sure of my skin tone (warm, cool, neutral), I just tried to pick products I thought would work, so I might be way off. That being said, product suggestions for my pale complexion would be absolutely adored and much appreciated! 
You could try wood oil as your mineral oil. It's only called "wood oil" because it's made to keep wood items (such as cutting boards) looking their best. Snow River wood oil is pure mineral oil with no additives or fragrance. It can be found on Amazon or at Bed Bath and Beyond.
If your face is red or feels warm (like sunburn), you most likely kept it on for too long. That happened to me the first time I used it and I have since reduced the amount of time I keep it on my face with good results. 
**Brand of product:** Nyx Butter Gloss

**Shade name:** Tiramisu

**Price:** $4.99 USD

**Consistency and formula:** Thicker, but not sticky. Definitely glossy. (Duh.)

**Where can we find it?** Ulta, Target, Amazon, Nyx website. I got mine at Wegmans, but anywhere that carries Nyx usually has it.

**Things you absolutely love about the product:** It's natural, but definitely not too sheer. It's got a lot of staying power (for a gloss) and to top it all off, it's very affordable and smells absolutely HEAVENLY. (It's also worth mentioning that there are a ton of other shades even if tiramisu isn't the right one for you!)

**Things others potentially might not love about the product:** If you have dryer lips like I do, you will have to apply a balm underneath it. (I use vaseline.) If you're sensitive to fragrance or don't like anything that smells sweet on your lips, it might be somewhat unpleasant.
Mine only gets red after a clay mask/spot treatment. Do you experience anything other than the redness? Burning, tingling, or itching?
After seeing the photos and reading that all the bases seem to have been covered in previous comments, my only advice (if you could call it that) would be to perhaps consider different undergarments. Not that there's anything wrong with the ones you currently have, but I don't think a little extra room would hurt.

I would consider seeing a doctor. I hope everything works out for you.
Assuming you're talking about the Axe "Spiked Up Look" putty..

Ingredients: Water (Aqua), Steareth 21, Cetearyl Alcohol, VP/VA Copolymer, Petrolatum, VP/Dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate Copolymer, Polyquaternium 4, Glyceryl Stearate, Glycerin, Steareth 2

Of note, cetearyl alcohol can be irritating and comedogenic, so if you are experiencing breakouts I would either recommend a break from the product to see if the breakouts continue or replace it completely. A lot of people tend to like aloe vera gel for their hair. I would recommend Natural Instinct Aloe Vera Gel ([CosDNA link](http://www.cosdna.com/eng/cosmetic_30a222658.html)).
I'm going to second the hormonal acne. While I agree with Camiyoka- that touching can definitely worsen acne (especially if you rest your chin on your hands a lot), I find that touching your face less doesn't completely prevent acne from popping up. Make sure you're getting enough water and maybe consider a derm visit.
As allmets said, there's the bloodscale and bloodfist sets. There's also the jade set, the saltstone set, the darkcrest set, and the tyrant's set.

My personal favorites fall under the glorious and lofty sets, but they're a bit more pricy as all of these are world drop greens.

If you're looking for something a little easier to obtain, I would suggest the chest item "Warrior's Embrace" which is a drop from Avatar of Hakkar in Temple of Atal'Hakkar. I'm currently using it in an outfit made for my female human death knight. (Blichy@Alexstrasza, if you wanna check it out.)
