> This is the same state that is bankrupting themselves on a poorly designed inefficient elevated rail system that could have been done years ago and cheaper if they just consulted some actual professionals and looked at case studies from other cities. They've increased taxes several times because they're ridiculously over-budget on the system and it's still not even operational.

You can also use kexec to boot the new kernel without restarting the system, but it's almost like doing a full restart, only faster.
Many problems in horror movies can be avoided by punching someone until you're absolutely sure they're dead
Yes, but sometimes custom kernels can work around the hardware issue by disabling certain cores or something like that in case of the Nexus 5X. 
Yeah bootloops and random failures are common with LG phones, definitely won't buy any of them ever again.

Although my Nexus 5 still works, my wife's LG G4 randomly decided to not power on or charge, we had to heat the SoC to make it work again. I guess LG phones are the new Xbox 360.

Also bought an used Nexus 5X which started bootlooping shortly after updating to Android 8.0, I already had the bootloader unlocked so it was an easy fix. Would have been impossible to fix otherwise.

LPT: If you have an LG phone that can be bootloader unlocked, do it now before it bootloops. 
Fuck WeMos, I've ordered something from them and it never arrived, didn't give me a refund

Wow, impressionist Polandball would be interessting
