I'm not talking about Xiaomi flagships I mean I get most of it. Which is a good deal considering the amount of money I pay, if you own an s8 and the s9 comes out would you upgrade only for a slight improvement? Or just a small new feature? If you had a budget phone you could upgrade it every year and not be left out on what's trending, that's what I meant.

What I do is buy a $200 phone every year or two, specifically Xiaomi I get to experience all the new stuff on flagships without having to compromise on battery. When I bought my Kenzo finger print sensors were all the rage. Now I'm getting the whyred when portrait mode and dual cameras are in fashion.

I get it's a desert map, but I prefer greenery, the map looks really dull and boring (this can't be fixed it's just preference)

The house layouts are really weird, even though I've got used to them I feel like there are too many places in a house

Relatively hard to drive vehicles, and hard to climb up rocks because vaulting is weird.

I liked the part where you hit your friend to demonstrate you can shoot normally from that position and you continued to shoot him until he was down even though it was unnecessary.
It's not android. :(
Unfortunately I don't have a choice, all the good phones are 5+ inches especially the $250 phones. The ones that are smaller have really awful camera.

I thought it was pretty obvious the way they designed the 'p' it looked like a popsicle.
No actually! I might have confused you with my phrasing. What I meant was when the song opens up in the app (black player in this case) it has the wrong album art, but plays the correct track.

For example the second screenshot in my previous comment plays the song 'six days' but has the album art of stranger things. 

[here's how it should look like if the album art isn't mixed up.](https://i.imgur.com/cfudW4y.jpg)

Similarly it's the same for all music tracks, the album art is chosen randomly. I first thought this was the fault of the music player but this happens in poweramp as well as black player ex. I'll test it on play music and some other apps and see if anything changes. Thanks for your time! 

Edit: I checked it with 3 other music apps (shuttle, phonograph and pulsar) and all of them work perfectly fine! Looks like this is an individual app related issue, sorry to bother you!
Yes, you are right, I'm using the device file search.

Hello! What do you think is the main difference between mge/dmg compared to supreme/global, is it just aim?

Edit: why the downvote? I'm currently mg2 and I want to improve myself, what's wrong if I ask a question? :(
Thanks!
Happy cake day!
Lmao Facebook VPN? Rip privacy.
Yes, you need a ROM with camera 2 API enabled, try lineageos 14.1
Ah right, my bad.
You'll probably have to import it from AliExpress or something...
Don't expect them to change that, that's what they make money off.
If you're an Indian, Jan 22, on Flipkart.
You should see their UI
It's amazing what we consider cheap these days, I miss those days when flagship phones were $450-$600
Agreed
It's buggy, ugly and super annoying. Each time they fix something, they break two other things.
Uh not entirely true, devs ported gcam to xiaomi Redmi Note 3, the image looks so much better compared to miui's camera.
I don't understand who would downvote a giveaway post...

Anyway my favourite game as of now is PUBG but the best game I've ever played has to be prince of Persia warrior within, that game is nostalgic as well as fun for me! Oh and GTA vice city too, so many memories, I wish I could go back in time

Anyway thanks for the generous giveaway op!

We don't own a car, I just skipped 2 classes to watch the launch event of a phone, turns out it was worth it! :)
No fuck you.
What happened?
Is there an upvote to die feature?
I just hope I die this time, haha.
Hi, I'm a redhead.
Thought so, it wasn't rigging enough giveaways for me, hope you look into it. ;)
That's what I thought, should I re-flash the ROM?
Who cleans that stuff? 
Haha!
Hey, if she says no, I'm here to die with you haha.
:(
You can try using xposed+gravity box.
Okay op, but what's that thing it's holding?
Did you check the offline section? If you can't find it just download some other theme on the theme store, alternatively you can use a launcher+icon pack
Thank you so much :)
That bezel on the top looks bad
All those features can be replicated on Android, pure Android looks cleaner and has a better UI, miui tries too hard, most of the time it's buggy, it has a bad memory management system.
Could you give me the link for the modded camera please?
Thanks for the reply, I'll surely check it out :)
Oh wow really? Could you link me to that please? Also is it the one with portrait mode?
Is it the same or better than stock?
Sure op thanks! :D

Exactly.
I'd recommend greenify. 
Hey, I've actually tried this and only thing worked for me was soundwire, but unfortunately I had a delay in audio output, I used it as a speaker for my friends to listen to while I was playing games on my PC (since my speakers broke that day) and there was a very noticeable audio delay, but if you use it to listen to music etc you can definitely use it.

Edit: why the down vote? I'm not lying, I'm just trying to help op.
The look of betrayal at the end.
Holy shit the second link could not be more accurate, I feel sad everyday that I have to memorize everything in order to fucking graduate, my memory is not the best, I can't recall what's exactly in the text books and they don't give you marks if your answers are different sometimes, I'm not kidding, everyone I know in my college memorize actual programs that we're supposed to solve in practicals, only a few care to understand it.
You were lucky enough to get people who were actually afk, nice!

Hey, which phone has the better camera?
I'd wait, but if you can't wait long just get a phone...
Turn that frown upside down
I'm not really good at naming, so I looked up some for you

"unicorn penis"

"Did not pay the rent"

And ofcourse the default name for most karambit "fidget spinner" haha

I don't know if you're asking for a funny name tag in general, if you are then "u wot m9" is my favourite nametag for m9 :D

I'll give it a shot, thanks :)
Fingers crossed man, if they do rebrand the five plus as the note 5 I'll be extremely disappointed
Oh, if I wanted to play music from Google assistant, how would I do that?

Okay, what am I missing here? Why would you post a gif of your hand, op?
Haha that sub is like dying after you're dead. 
LUCKY SCOOBY.
Ah yes, fingers crossed!
There's an easier way, as long as you have access to fastboot you can flash miui ROMs (only thing I like about miui) I made [this guide](http://c.mi.com/thread-36181-1-0.html) a long time ago, just try this and see if it works.
I think they can use the data from depth camera to take better portrait pictures
That was in China! But yes, it did.
Yeah, I'm okay with that, as long as the camera is improved and the battery remains the same
They definitely won't be launching a phone with MTK in India.

Probably miui trying to do something with it
I've never had to wait or apply since I was a moderator for the forum before haha, lucky me.

Ye I'll see what I can do, thanks. :)
I've tried that as well first it said I couldn't recieve payment as I didn't have a pancard then I linked my pancard but it still says my account is limited and I can't receive payment .-.
Any other way?
PayPal doesn't work so well in India. :( Last time I tried they charged a shit ton of tax, and the payment request was denied both times I tried for some reason
I do use it occasionally, but my account definitely doesn't look new... Most of my stuff has privacy set to friends only...
I've tried requesting there multiple times, the admins never approved me :(
Glad to see it working :)) and yea op do that. It's all in your head once you get over that you'll never go back just distract yourself enough to get away from gambling, remove your authenticator if you have to.

You should see the Five-SeveN in csgo, boy I'd love something like that in this game.
Ah, okay, so players need to qualify to play in the team...
Hi Livid it's me pm me
What about scream? Did he make the top 10? Also why didn't he participate in Krakow?? :3
Ah, that's nice. And yes, I'm new to csgo :) especially the esports part of it.
Who would they choose for #1?
I don't know if this is a hack, but one of my friends on my steam (that I don't even remember adding) was having a casual conversation with me and he was in-game I asked him how it was going and he sent me a URL when I opened it it gave the live locations of everyone that are currently alive and moving in the map, I bugged him a lot he refused to tell me how he got that.
Man you have no idea how alone I feel in this sub, I'm Indian btw.
If I got an awm,

1) I'd die before I'd get to it

2) I'd die while taking and coming back

3) my game disconnects or crashes

4) I'd never see anyone until top 15

5) everyone I see would hide behind trees or rocks and never peek

6) everyone I see would constantly keep fucking moving around
How do I get the new crate?
I'd prefer xiaomi phones over Nokia, they offer better specs...
Honestly I don't mind the NFC the battery is what made me give up on A1
Nokia is pretty bad at pricing tbh, they overestimate their phones.
Woof 👉🐶👉
What is memorial day?

Oh, so

Okay, noted. :) Thanks.
So,

    $result = mysql_query($sql);
    $row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)

Will return the integer value to $row?


Wow that worked, thank you so much! I need to explore the app more, my bad.

I was actually chasing this dude for a whole minute because he sniped the airdrop that was close to me, he got it first because he had a car, so I saw another car nearby and started chasing him he had the mk14 with 8x ;)
I have a confession, I choose NA servers during auto matchmaking because no one in Asian servers speak english and I simply cannot communicate with them, I tried my best by jumping around and going infront of them and dropping items etc, but if you're in top 10/20 you can't play like that.

Plis deliver op
the buildings load very well in the new test server, however if I turn on shadow play and play the normal one the buildings still don't load, so I'll just wait for pubg to optimise it, I'm not going to invest on extra  hardware just for one game. :(
Makes sense... :)
:( pls allow quality shitposts
Well I thought op wanted that switch because sometimes the head obstructs the view in tpp, so I just switch to fpp to avoid that
I use shadowplay, but when I start my recording and the game starts, it takes longer for the buildings to load :(
Is it better than shadowplay? Also does it use the hard-disk? Because when I use shadowplay, the buildings take a lot of time to load
Props to that dude I'd be pissed off
I just switch to first person during combat
Can someone who hate fog and rain explain why you leave those server? I really want to know...
Forgive me if this is a dumb question, I'm new to pcmr and I wanted to know if pubg could run even better? I mean GTA V looks really amazing on medium/high (which my 960 can run without a sweat) and pubg gives me 60fps even on desert map when everything is set to low...

Can someone tell me where I can find the exact changelog for the new updates every time it's out, like there was a 150+mb update today I looked everywhere and couldn't find the changelog or I just suck at looking
The best thing you can do is to remove your steam authenticator once you're happy with the skins, or cash out everything and then remove authenticator, please quit gambling while you're ahead or if you just started to gamble, it can be depressing as fuck. I've had my share with that and thankfully I've quit gambling, it doesn't look like you're addicted in the beginning but eventually it'll consume you!! Please stop gambling.
Can it be r rated?

Once you start playing the game, get the cases and sell them on market buy more games :D

I own a Redmi note 3 and this is the longest I've ever had the same phone, almost 2 years now. 
I'm not paying anything more than $250 for a phone.
