OP, you have a clear fork in the road; listen to Uncluded or don't and potentially miss out on some great tracks. You know where to find them, sample some and make your decisions.

Good but there's unofficial finishing grinders for cheaper that do the exact same thing. Where I bought my MFLB the finishing grinder was prohibitively expensive.

Android is about having options. In this case, the option to change a minor cosmetic detail on an otherwise great phone to suit your liking.
Reminds me a lot of Yoshida Brothers - [Storm](https://youtu.be/wx8BVGHMiC0).

Amazon have responded by bringing Firefox and Silk browsers to FireTV which allows for the exact same YouTube experience on the FireTV as before.
Amazon had started to carry the Chromecast devices in response to this. Google decided to push Amazon into a corner anyway.

I think the point from a non technically minded or security conscious person is why bother? You obviously have very strong feelings about making your communications secure, but the average user does not care. All they care about is which messenger app their friends use and because those apps don't become default SMS clients, will barely text at all. 

I've stopped trying to convert friends to the latest and greatest, mostly because I'm tired of being "that guy", so I stick to Whatsapp and Messenger. Like past messenger apps, Signal will not remain installed for long. (I am testing it)

Don't add new features without addressing performance first.
Also the Watch Later list has to reload every time you remove something. This wouldn't be as bad if there was a one-tap solution to removing a video.

Appreciate the reviews! I was planning on buying some Bombies for the first time tomorrow so this has definitely influenced which flavours I'll be experimenting with first. Problem is, they all sound so tasty!

May I ask what set up you were running with these? RDA or RBA or tank, etc.
In what way?

From the candid pictures she posts on her Twitter this looks to be the real deal.
I'll give that a try next time I refill mine, thank you. I guess I've always been worried about leakages but I'm more worried about never being able to open the damn thing again.
Mine used to do the same thing and it really hurt my initial week with it. What fixed it for me was to switch out the coil that came already attached with the spare you get in the box. No gurgling since.
Good shout, hadn't thought of those! 
I didn't realise the original trailer needed fixing until I watched this. Well done!
Same here, sitting atop an MVP 2. Upgraded from a Kanger Evod and it's a world of difference.
Staring worriedly at mine now. Only had it for a month and the death grip I have to put on it to unscrew the base... needless to say I'll use a cloth in case it shatters into my hand.

Edit: Just had to refill mine and hands feel like hell. Honestly the only downside of the Naut Mini in my book.
I had the same problem with Nannerbear and was very disappointed by the tobacco flavour. But apparently it doesn't say it contains any tobacco flavouring other than a "hint."

While volunteering you're still entitled to jobseeker's allowance. I have no idea what the going rate for apprenticeships are but I hear it's pretty awful.
Gorgeous update and all the features.. I don't remember Reddit News being this robust!

One question: would you be willing to add a way to quickly hide or up/downvote a post from the frontpage/subreddit? I don't like to read everything on my front page and if I'm not going to read it I'd like to get it out of sight.

Swiping left then tapping hide works but that extra tap makes the Reddit experience a little slower than on some other Reddit apps.

Edit: Also seeing some inconsistencies with hiding posts. If I hide them (swipe left, tap hide) they may or may not be hidden on the main Reddit website.
Awesome! In for another chance!

Yes you can, and should. Shame reddit into taking a look at their own massive man titties.

I noticed my Twitter feed exploded (one person) with hate at that episode of had to do a quick search. I honestly wouldn't have seen it as a problem if Twitter hadn't told me I should be outraged by this. I blame the fact that I'm white and entitled as fuck.
Didn't anyone see the recent episode of Doctor Who where they had a poncho and a cactus on-board the Mexican base on the moon? Mini-shitstorm ensued from people claiming racism.
Satisfying until you try and get one out. Then it's shake furiously and slam the pack against your desk until one dislodges.
I saw the pilot a couple of months ago; can anyone tell me if there were any edits done to the pilot before the air-date? The version I saw seemed a little rough around the edges in some parts so I was just curious.
Awesome idea but you wouldn't catch me sticking random stuff I got from strangers in my open ports.
Do you know of anywhere I could read about Gamergate that isn't biased? 

Genuine question because I'm staying well away from this shitstorm but I'd still like to know why every one I know is so outraged one way or another.
Appreciate the warning! I'll go in my best tie-dye shirt.
Got some unexpected vape-mail today from Colonel Boom! Heard some good things about this UK-based e-liquid and their supplier (PlumeBlu) sent me a free bag of Haribo. It's like they know me already.

First time getting a freebie from a company and even though it's a small bag of sweets, it was a pleasant surprise.
I hadn't heard of Dr Herman's before, I'll have to check them out next time I'm in town!
Cheers!
That's a really unique and awesome mod.
Sweet skin on the MVP! Mind linking where you got it from? Looking for something similar on mine :)
Wonderful contest!
The concept sounds great. I'm forever searching for free Wifi in Leeds to keep from using my data connection. I may throw caution to the wind and give it a shot.
The reviews don't look favourable for that app.
As a Horde main, Alliance got the best looking models imo. Looking great!
Why are so many people being argumentative about this guide? I feel your guidelines for this post were pretty simple: soloable, doesn't cost you a penny, easy to farm.

Appreciate the post! Nice to see someone post something informative.
Was this for a special occasion or is that just a regular thing you like to whip up? Either way, I wonder if it's too late in my life to be adopted by you.
A bit, but my EVOD was belting out some decent vapour on its own with my all-day juices. Most of mine are 60% PG / 40% VG. I'll have to give some Max VG a try and see how they perform.
The taste has definitely improved and the ability to tweak the voltage and wattage depending on the juice I'm using is pretty nice. I'm by no means an expert on what voltage to use so I usually go by taste.

The Nautilus Mini is a very good little tank as well. Coming from the EVOD I have only that to compare it to, but having variable airflow just adds more for me to mess with. The Nautilus is also so much easier to refill since you can get the little nozzle right in there so I don't have the problem with thicker juices trickling through the air pipe when I'm filling it.
Vape mail! Upgraded from my Kanger EVOD to an MVP2 and a Nautilus Mini, all thanks to /r/electronic_cigarette recommendations.

Put in a little Squid Ink by Kraken to test drive, holy moley what a difference in taste from my old setup! [http://i.imgur.com/tFu2skp.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/tFu2skp.jpg)
Sounds great. Ordered myself a Strawberry Milkshake to try!

Edit: Received my order today. Not bad for a fledgling company! What can I say, it tastes like Strawberry Milkshake. Not too sweet either which I prefer.
I just tried Squid Ink the other day and it's very nice indeed. Has a tiny bit of a sherbert after-taste; definitely an all-day vape for me. Minion Farts by Kraken is great too, if you like banana with a bit of custard after-taste. Both very smooth vapes.

That would be a great feature. Many thanks for considering our plight. :)
Cheers, I'll give it a whirl until something is sorted with Reddit Sync.

According to /u/ljdawson the cache clears itself after a while, maybe that's why yours is quite low.

You won't hear any complaints from me. 

However, removing posts because they're deemed by arbitrary rules to "not [be] typically British" problems is a slippery slope. I'll go to a serious subreddit if I want to hear meta complaints about the type of content posted, ad nauseam.

Wild but he's young and confused. I do hope he found his mother or was able to rescue the little thing.
A lot of the best cartoons have references that only adults will get, probably to make it bearable for adults to sit with their kids and watch it.

Personally though, I prefer the jokes/references to be a bit more subtle than in Justice League. Sure, kids aren't going to get these jokes so they're safe there, but the jokes aren't very subtle when you're older. 

It might be an unpopular opinion but the jokes that can even go over an adults head tickle me the most when re-watching old shows. It shows that the writers actually made the effort for the jokes.
You're a legend! Nice find!
Is the original teaser available anywhere? Did a quick Youtube search but all I could find was news reporting on the teaser.
Thanks random person for your personal recommendation.
All of these are amazing but I love the "Gallery Mode for Browsing" suggestion most of all. Baconreader has a similar option and it makes browsing a single, image-heavy subreddit a breeze. 

I sincerely hope /u/ljdawson implements this function. All of these in fact.
Does this impact the regular cards view at all? I quite like having big thumbnails.
> The only thing is you still have the occasional ad, which I found to be pretty reasonable at about every 8-10 songs 

That sounds very reasonable indeed. Thanks for the heads-up!
What's the freemium mode on Spotify? I thought Spotify was free on mobile now, only that you can't choose precisely which song to play; it only allows shuffle of an album or playlist, etc.

Either way, nice module!
Yeah, I think OP is really grasping at straws with this one.
It really is. /r/movies has some major league idiots running around.

That would be an excellent move on their part. I'm firmly behind demos of all games, even though I understand how they can be difficult for devs to produce.
> You won't really get it until you have the controller in your hands.

I get what you're saying, problem is that few people will shell out full price for a game because of a wishy-washy statement like "you'll understand how good it is when you play it." You can't build a review on that.
As a Hollander, the Belgians beat us on chips. 

I hope no one sees this comment and uses it against me at a later date, but I had to get that off my chest.
I'm all for this but the only problem is that swiping from the right to the left already hides a post if you have that enabled in the settings. 

I love the idea of gestures to upvote/downvote though.
I've never had a problem with lag using Swiftkey, but if they're talking about the performance of their swiping prediction then I would be happy to see this. 

The way swiping is now is just awful especially if you compare it to Google Keyboard and Swype. Though Swype seems to get too clever for its own good when predicting what word I "clumsily" swiped to.

I am this person also. It's fine though because what /u/Theriley106 should have added is that you should be wary of people with no hobbies if you're the outgoing and interesting type.

I've dated interesting and outgoing types before and they are tiring people to deal with.
Watch the video. Almost every time the rabbit stops being petted he will stomp his back feet.

Regardless of where the power comes from each level my original point still stands. Trying to spread out 5-6k crits over 100 levels just wouldn't work. Even less so if these 5-6k crits would be at the level 100 cap.

I heard rumours about Blizz shooting for Wotlk damage numbers but I don't know if that's still the plan. I guess we'll see when the damage numbers for WoD are finalised.
Blizz needs to increase the damage each level for 100 levels. I don't see them being able to keep damage numbers that low while still making it feel like your character is increasing in power. 
The damage numbers in Alpha aren't final. 
Will happen? IMO it already has happened. The last two seasons were nothing like the first two that got me in to the show.
Or we can stop bringing back old shows and focus on making new memories instead. 
It can get a bit ridiculous, right? Chrome is another big offender for me; easily gets to 500 MB if left unchecked. I shouldn't have to manually do this for each app, or download a separate app to fix it.

Maybe it's not possible in Android, I'm no dev.
/r/funny
That's the footage I was referring to in my own comment, agreeing with the OP about the disadvantages of 60 FPS in videos versus 60 FPS gameplay. 

The footage in the above video is unnerving and some (not all) people have reported feeling a little nauseous after watching it due to the disconnect between the user watching and the gameplay being shown. Playing a game at 60+ FPS is an amazing experience, watching a video in 60 FPS that you have no connection to has been shown to have different effects on people, from nausea to headaches. 
I agree with you all the way. I watched the Titanfall 60 FPS YouTube footage and it was.. weird. Mostly because I wasn't controlling the gameplay. It was disorienting. 
And those twenty minutes are heavily scripted and pre-planned. I prefer my panel shows with a bit more improv, or at least able to fake it well.
It never did afaik and I've been using Android since Gingerbread. Not sure where they got that from.
Not even a little bit.

I was always under the impression that /r/britishproblems was a bit tongue in cheek and not to be taken seriously. Are we seriously considering policing frivolity? 

Upvote what you like, downvote what think doesn't belong or is a repeat. Reddit's good like that.
I would not be surprised!
Yes but have you seen the wildlife there?

It may not make you a bad person now, but it surely made you a bad person at the time. Provided you weren't wrongly convicted.

According to Dara O'Briain they had to cut out a lot of what he said during Mock he Week because he was frequently too offensive (to air).
Opinions, man.. how do they work?
And a site that does exactly the same (with an arguably worse name/brand) is the solution to that? I think not.

For one site to become obsolete another needs to pop up that innovates the medium.
> I feel like there's something fundamentally wrong with someone.

> No offense.

OK.
Are people seriously making Reddit alternatives over something as simple as a change to the way the voting is displayed? 

That's just silly imo. And I'd personally hate for the creator of one of the best Reddit apps on Android to waste development time on something like that.
Or they did it to someone who doesn't know what the word means.

In case it wasn't obvious, the lady tears are yours. 
Ah well, fair enough. :) It seems they've succeeded in making the core of their game (shooting, scenarios etc) the best it can be. That is what they're great at after all.
It's not accurate to say that Bungie doesn't want to deliver a "ground breaking" experience when that has been their ethos when talking about Destiny. Their promises of deep rooted story, 10 year long campaign and massive world filled with drop in, drop out multiplayer experiences, "ground breaking" is exactly what they're going for.

Hiya, I'm on 0.43b and this issue still happens with most IMGur links to non-gifs when viewed through RES' expando. Is this something that can't be fixed?

Also I'd like to make a feature suggestion: a way to view the original gif without gfycat conversion. Mostly so that I can save the gif but also in case the service is slow or goes down entirely.

Thanks for this great addon!
Get out.
Ah ha, so spoiler tagged comments and the like. Good to know, thanks!
How do the spoilers work? I'm on the latest beta and haven't noticed any change in the way spoilers are handled in submissions. Is it just in comments?

Most likely, but these places do exist in Leeds and they aren't hidden. One of the beatings occurred outside Tiger Tiger for instance.

I'm sure going out in Leeds can be safe if you know what you're doing or where you're going, but it's far from "great" which is why I felt like I needed to talk about my experiences and what I've seen in the news.
I'd like to respectfully disagree on two points.

> The night life is great because of the large student population.

Hit and miss for sure. Certain places are nice but on a whole nightlife in Leeds can teeter between abysmal or downright violent. I've seen plenty of people being dragged out of clubs and beaten. The student spots are mostly nice and quite safe, though. I avoid Leeds nightlife at all costs.

> Public transport is everywhere and inexpensive.

Everywhere indeed, but incredibly expensive for what you get and it's only getting worse. Just recently the price for an all-day (any time) First Leeds Day Rider that would get you anywhere in West Yorkshire for the entire day on First went up by 70p. They "compensated" by making the Leeds Metropolitan Day Rider a flat £3.90 regardless of time of day, but even that's gone up a lot in the past few years. I've only lived here for 6 years and I remember it being £3.40 for a Day Rider.

And the short travel single went up by yet another 10p; where two years ago it was only £1 it's now £1.20.

Not ragging on Leeds at all as you could do A LOT worse. The city centre is amazing ever since they finished Trinity and with 35k a year OP is going to have a great time here.
I'd like to second Play Books. Clean UI, good set of options, ability to select a word and have the definition pop up. And since a year (maybe less) you're able to upload your own epub/pdf format books and sync them with your device. 

I couldn't ask for more.

Wait.. I'm sure I put a basket on your head so you couldn't see me breaking all your crates and robbing you.
You can get a £1.10 fare in Leeds (First buses); it takes you 7 or 8 stops one way. Good for getting down to the nearest shopping centre where I live.

Camera Zoom FX (mainly because it allows me to take pictures using the volume button) and Camera360. I find that Camera360 has the best "Enhance" filters; filters that actually enhance the look of the image taken rather than making it look vintage or the like.

But I'm going to try out some of these suggestions right now.

For those of us who haven't played in a week or so, is there any where where we can see all the changes made since the very beginning? You guys do such a good job with every patch but you add so many new things every time that it can be a bit overwhelming.

Keep up the great work!
Search "Yasuo Jungle" on Youtube; you're definitely not the only one who thought about this.

He's good in the jungle but not super impressive. He has no hard CC besides his ultimate and that depends on you or someone else knocking the enemy champion up. I can imagine ganking a Jana lane where she lands her whirlwind and you just ult in would be pretty amazing.

Totally viable in the jungle with his shield and low cooldowns and I imagine fun to play, I just don't see him winning any awards in the jungle department. That could change though, he might turn out to be amazing.

No, you're absolutely right, without Naughty Dog the Playstation wouldn't have had much in the way of amazing exclusives, either.

Edit: But then I'm reminded by Mr. COCAINE___waffles of Ni no Kuni. Sony had quite a few interesting exclusives to offer last generation.
I've played every Halo game since the first (not including the RTS) and read a couple of Eric Nylund's books on the Halo universe. 

I was clearly bothered to understand the Halo universe, I just couldn't care less about Halo 4's contribution.
Halo 4 probably, and that's a bit sad really if you think about. Nothing about Halo 4 was awe-inspiring; the graphics were snazzy by console standards but the campaign wasn't all that good. 

The 360 was just never a great console for exclusives, not when you compare it to the PS3 or PC. Though counting the PC is maybe a bit unfair.

Didn't the first GoW (And second?) have some of the worst host advantage of any game ever? 

Not denying the first GoW was great!
People generally don't mind ads on free apps. Scam ads are a different matter all together.
Buying a console day one always seemed a bit dodgy to me. I was surprised at how many of my friends actually got the Day One edition Xbones or waited in line for their PS4s at midnight.

Luckily for them, their consoles seem to be in perfect working order. I personally wouldn't want to risk it, and not knowing what the release of games is going to be like a year down the road, it's hard to make a decision now.
I personally can't stand 150+ pings compared to 60-70 pings; it feels as if it takes ages for my character to move.

Make a test account and play a few matches on EUW.
This would have been better without the camera-person and their companion laughing so loudly.

Just tried this out on the PBE and while Relic Shield is still in Thresh's recommended items, it does not work for his auto attacks. 

It's actually kind of broken, because the Spoils of War passive will still work if you last hit a minion, it just won't execute a minion like it should.

Edit: I meant it seemed kind of broken because it's meant to be part of Thresh's build, according to the recommended build, but it doesn't work as intended on him. 

But zillin's explanation makes a lot of sense. I see where Riot is going with this now.
Dude, spoilers. Not cool.
Hopefully bad enough that to this day, whenever he considers being a jerk, he's haunted by the little kid who punched his lights out repeatedly in front of all his class mates.

Sorry, I was bullied as a kid.
What does he bring in the late game if he's "just another support" as you put it? His team fight potential has never been stellar. 
Same for me, only it was a copy of Men at Arms. First book I properly sat down and read and didn't stop the whole time we were there on holiday.
I see no point in 3 green, 1 pink and 5 pots with the Relic Shield, simple as. Maybe the games I play aren't as high ranked but we tend to dominate the lane with one of us having Relic Shield.

Vision wars as we knew them in Season 3 are currently either dead or on hiatus in most games I've played. And with the gold income I can always adapt on first back.
When people talk about "The Art of Trolling" they're not talking about you, buddy.
You can usually last hit better when a charge is up. Relic Shield can destroy a minion at just under half HP when the ADC can't. I like to make it into a game, haha.
Brilliant! I'll look it up; thanks!
> I explained what the item does and was still raged at for 'taking the canon minion.'

Really? I can't say I'm surprised at the ignorance of some people, but still.

Honestly, in that situation I'd explain calmly what the item did but if the person kept on raging I'd go support mid or top. I'm sure they'd appreciate being snowballed.
I've been using the lens to disable other wards, it works quite well. My lane partner (adc) always buys the warding totem. 

I might try to trinket that grants vision, though.
Truly. Truly.
Relic Shield. No matter the support. It's just such a good item.

Then one green ward and two pots which change into Totalbiscuits.
I've just played a few games with Thresh and felt really tanky running a 0/13/17 build, especially with Relic Shield and the gold income boosts. I wouldn't want to give up all the goodies in the Utility tree for points that only help me out in very niche situations.
I'll give it a look, thanks!
Is there an app to check specifically which processes are causing it? The default battery settings don't really specify.
Not a whole lot; Falcon Pro was checking for tweets and updating my timeline every hour. It's gone down since then but only because Google Services has been eating battery like there's no tomorrow.

Hope Google Services is "fixed" soon.
When I got mine on the Friday they were released, I charged it to 100% and tried my best get as much out of the battery as possible. The only thing I really did was put airplane mode on at night because I normally put my phone on silent anyway. 57 hours later..

Screenshot 1: [http://i.imgur.com/RuMDWWA.png](http://i.imgur.com/RuMDWWA.png) -- Includes a 1 hour phone call.

Screenshot 2: [http://i.imgur.com/LP7aiBG.png](http://i.imgur.com/LP7aiBG.png)

And this is on the default 2070mAh battery. I imagine I could get 3 days out of the 3000mAh battery if I really tried.
Agreed, I've had more luck with Olaf built with 21 points into the defensive tree. 

Sometimes you'll be the counter to their top laner and 21 offensive will push them out of lane, but then you're not as useful late game because you can't take as much of a beating in team fights.
> I only needed to repeat commands two or three times.

Using the controller/remote would still be quicker, though. Unless you mean you had to repeat your commands once or twice before you learned what the Kinect wanted to hear and how to say it.
Aunt. I had a hard time seeing it as well.
After having just watched Jeff Gerstmann wrestle with the Kinect voice commands, this seems like a horrible idea.
No one said anything about there not being room for a meta change. There just isn't room for two equally optimized metas. There will always be one meta that is better than the others and that will be the norm.
> -The home button quick start menu is sorely missed for starting and leaving parties, and looking quickly at achievements and friends in a simple txt based interface. I can only hope they bring some version of that back.

So how do you quickly look at achievements or join/leave parties while you're in game if there's no "quick menu"?
I see this: [http://i.imgur.com/4SnQ2H1.png](http://i.imgur.com/4SnQ2H1.png)
Not really. There will never be more than one viable meta; there will be one optimal meta that everyone uses and other sub-optimal metas that will almost never see the light of day.

And Riot doesn't want to get rid of junglers all together by making them sub-optimal, which is one of the major issues with the patch right now. Well, one specific item.
And yet I have two friends that have been hyping this game ever since E3. I really hope they still find enjoyment in the game, but something tells me they'll lie to themselves and everyone else when asked.
The Rev3 review links to Frequency, whatever that is. The Youtube video is of higher quality and they get ad revenue from it: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4o4qc6Osk8](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4o4qc6Osk8)
> All these changes are geared toward giving supports more gold, which will allow new champions to fill that role.

This is exactly what is not going to happen and Riot has said they'll come down hard if it starts happening. Supports are listed as support. There will still be some fringe cases but one of the reasons for this patch was to give supports their identity back.
Who is it if not Killer Croc? Did a quick Google search and everyone seems to think it was Croc who said it.
No thanks. It's nice to have a system-wide font so my eyes don't have to adjust when switching between apps. And the default font just fits redditsync.

Of course. I was using Rottie as the most obvious choice but it could be anything, really. 
They absolutely are. Source: reviewed a few games, had to sign an NDA stating time-zones when a review embargo was lifted.
Not that I've seen. Bloodhound colouring is mostly lighter brown with black whereas Rottie is black with brown markings.

OP's doggie doesn't have any other typically Bloodhound characteristics so I'm not sure how accurate his Bloodhound ancestry is. Rottie would be more likely.
Odd then how Baconreader is the only app I've ever used with intrusive ads such as these. I realise it's not a simple fix but neither is the lame and tired "if you don't like the ads, buy the app" mentality. Some people can't buy an app or they don't want to be bullied into buying an app because the ads are aggressive and bothersome. I personally buy apps and donate to my favourite developers, not because the ads are annoying, but to support their work.

That's what I think this thread is trying to make the devs realise and my original comment was directed at the type of comments that state the best solution is to pay to not be inconvenienced. It's not. 

P.s. there was no need for the "ungrateful bastards" comment whatsoever. I don't care how strongly you feel about this subject, I've been a long time user of RES and I'd like to think of you as one of the good developers.
The devs have been told, this isn't the first time questionable ads have leaked through. 
Fair point. And I'd no issue buying the game again on Play Store since not only do you get a great deal with Humble, but your money goes toward a selection of great charities. Win win, really.
SEO.
I would love to buy this for "Ridiculous Fishing" but these games don't see many updates after they're released, do they? I know the Humble Bundle Android app can update the games, but there's no saying if they'll be updated as quickly as on the Play Store.

A brand new game like Ridiculous Fishing will undoubtedly see a few bug fix updates and I would hate to miss out.

All ads are going to give the developer revenue. Not all ads should take up half your screen or LIE to you about malware on your device or computer.

That's just bad form on the devs side.
This thread is not about paying for the app and I really wish people would knock it off when there's a thread in /r/baconreader complaining about the type of ads. I've seen screenshots of ads that claim you have malware on your phone and to click the ad to get rid of it. 

Ads should be as unobtrusive as possible while still giving the developer the needed revenue.
No mention of frame issues that I can see. Safe to say that these have been ironed out in the final game?

The game frequently ran at sub-30 sometimes sub-20 FPS before.
I'm using a Nokia 550 mA that I had lying around. I was a little surprised when I found that the box only contained a USB cable, but then I remembered "budget device."

I feel like with the Moto G I have to keep reminding myself that it's "budget" because nothing about the phone itself reminds me.
I've been very impressed by this phone so far!

The screen on time is currently sitting at 2,5 hours (automatic brightness) and the battery is at exactly 50%. I'll keep an eye on it, though!
Call quality is adequate on my Moto G. The ear-speaker isn't the best out there but so long as you don't have the volume up too far it sounds just fine. Have the volume up a bit further and there's some noticeable popping, though. 

This was in a quiet room on one phone call though; it might be different per situation. The popping could have also come from the other end.

Speaker is also adequate. Not the best but it sounds fine, albeit a little flat. I'm no audiophile though and I almost never use the speaker on my phones.

The times I've used Flipboard I've found that it's really hard to set up "right." By right I mean, so that I don't see the mountains of crap that I have little to no interest in.

I'd love to give it another shot though since it's been 6 months since my last try.
Just picked this phone up here in the UK and it's like night and day coming from an old-ish HTC Desire. I have a Nexus 7 2012 and I reckon the responsiveness of the phone is on par with that, at the very least. Battery life (with wifi and 3g on) has been excellent, too.

Only the first day, but I can tell buying the Moto G was a good choice.
Echoing Phones 4 U as they're the only brick & mortar shop selling them right now. They started yesterday and the Moto G is selling really fast.

Scotland is depressing. 
I honestly wouldn't still be playing this game if I didn't have three other friends to play with. And even then we only played ranked to get placed (Silver IV, woo) for the Season 3 rewards. My friends and I normally play ARAM, which even though it comes with its own hurdles, doesn't seem to stress us out as much as 5v5 does.

I can't imagine what drives solo players to keep coming back to this game when there are so many other games out there, multiplayer or otherwise, where you don't have to put up with a barrage of shit every other game.

I'd love to play more 5s/ranked in theory, be it to learn my lanes more or just to have fun, but I don't find it to be a very chilled out experience. Mostly ragers in the lower Silver on EUW who both don't possess basic game knowledge and think they're the next Xpeke. 

Riot doesn't do enough to separate the toxic players from the players who just want to have fun playing a game. The tribunal doesn't work because it's user-moderated. We had a guy two nights spouting off racial slurs in All chat because he was in a team with all Spanish players. I'm sure he's still playing normally on that account, whereas in other games he would've been temp-banned by now. I'm sure that what we saw wasn't his first infraction.

This turned into more of a rant about the state of League itself. My bad.
Any salient point the author could've made has been drowned out by the ridiculous title.
No one's complaining about ads, it's the type of ads. Telling you your phone may have viruses would panic people who didn't know better. These types of ads are malicious and unwelcome anywhere.
I can't speak for the rest, but Thresh is one of the least passive champions as he's an offensive support.
Knowing what his opinion was and him expressing his opinion so candidly in front of the camera are two different things. Her reaction was hers alone and it was justified. No one is saying that either of them did anything "wrong."
The earliest phone I've heard it on is the Samsung Galaxy S2.

Honestly, when do people in /r/comicbooks not nitpick? It's hard to find a submission in this subreddit that doesn't have people finding fault in it.
And Whatsapp? Everyone I know uses Whatsapp because it's the most popular cross-platform messaging app where I'm from.

I think that's the point greven is making. Unless you know people who own a Blackberry device and don't already use Whatsapp or Viber, why would you switch to BBM? Getting a whole group of friends to switch over to another app when they're comfortable using a service that is already available to everyone using iPhones, Android phones and Blackberry phones, seems unnecessary.

It's great to have the option, though. And for people who prefer not to give out their phone numbers, BBM is obviously a good alternative over Whatsapp and Viber.

Just because you give a reason for a stupid act doesn't make it any less stupid. 

The voting system on Reddit is there for a reason; you made a ridiculous comment that had nothing to do with the subject and the comment was downvoted into oblivion. You're willfully stupid by your own standards for not seeing that and an idiot for continuing to assert that your comment had significance by reposting it. Sure, delete it if your fragile ego can't take it, but don't repost the same stupid comment only so it can be downvoted again. And especially not a third time.

I quoted your comment so your idiocy could be seen before you had a chance to delete it and repost it again. So people are informed of the fact that you're trying to dodge downvotes because you feel your bashing of someone else's comment is so important that the world must see it.

Your replies so far paint a very distinct picture of an incorrigible self-important asshole who in his or her own eyes can do no wrong, so there's really no point to my own comment since none of it will sink in to that thick skull of yours. 

For a Redditor of two years with a very short comment history you should have maybe stayed in the shadows because so far you're making a real ass out of yourself.
You deleted your comment a third time now and I'm the silly child? Alright, buddy.

Which is why they changed that in the latest patch. You can now only lose a maximum of $500 when dying in Free Mode.
$300 is ridiculously easy to get and the only reason they add that tidbit about buying in-game cash is so people know it's an option if they want to buy ahead. And the only reason OP doesn't have $300 is because he banked it all. 

I don't agree with micro-transactions that give people an unfair advantage but considering everything that could give you an advantage in this particular game is behind a level cap, this is a non-issue. Weapons and better missions are behind a higher level-cap and money will not make it easier for you to achieve those levels.

THAT'S why Reddit as a whole aren't getting their panties in a twist about this. Not because everyone wants to crawl inside Rockstar's asshole and make a warm little nest to live out the rest of their lives. That's beside the point.

Love the idea but I couldn't see myself using this for more than 10 minutes. I need to have full control over every aspect of the theme and most premade themes are heavy on the looks but lacking in usability.

This app was obviously made for quick, on the go theme changing and it looks great for that.
Is /r/wtf a default subreddit? If so, why?! 
I've lived in Leeds for 5 years now and I don't have a typical British accent. I was born in Holland but to English parents, so my accent is impossible to pin down.

My point is, the death glare you get from some people in Leeds is really noticeable. For instance, on more than one occasion the person behind the till has been happily chatting away to every customer before me, but when it's my turn everything goes silent until the transaction is complete. And I'd like to think I'm quite friendly to people behind tills and such.

I feel your pain of being labeled an outsider.

There are exceptions obviously, and those are the people who you know don't discriminate just because it's something they don't know. So for weeding out the "nice but only to their 'own kind'" people from the genuinely nice people, the accent works quite well.

You would have to actively avoid looking at it when you walked in, then quickly turn and sit.
The first thought going through my mind was "Why would you want to spend the rest of your life with someone who asks for a picture of your butthole AND calls you a slut before they've even formally introduced themselves?"

Couldn't agree more. People who break plans for something better are the worst type of "friends." 
Just so you know, installing the "mandatory content" to the HDD and the play disc to USB works very well. I haven't had a single problem in 16+ hours of gameplay.

Minimum required USB is 16GB, though. Something to do with caching.
Will this still be part of Monogatari Second Season? It's a bit confusing with all these names for different arcs, especially with Bakemonogatari, Nisemonogatari, etc. preceding these as full-fledged seasons.
Especially with the older harddrives. My arcade model couldn't handle GTA IV being installed without having streaming texture issues. I upgraded to a newer model (black, 120GB) harddrive and I could install GTA IV and play just fine.

GTA V hasn't been a problem so far; installed "Install Disc" to HDD and "Play Disc" to USB.
~~Minimum 8GB should suffice, but~~ 16GB to be on the safe side.

Edit: Seems it's 16GB minimum after all.

I'd take ten maps at launch if I wasn't under the impression that a lot of the best maps will be coming out as DLC mere months after release. Ten maps is a big step in the right direction, though. 
It would be worth trying. The USB 2.0 read speeds should in theory be as good if not better than the 12x DVD drive in the Xbox 360. And I'm pretty sure you can install full games to USB.

Installing the mandatory install to the USB and the "Play disc" to the harddrive seems like it would be the best way to go about it. But I don't see the the reverse wouldn't work just as well.

I'll be trying this out tomorrow as I'm cursed with one of the older models of Xbox 360 that sounds as if a Boeing 747 is starting up whenever a disc is in the drive.
It's totally possible and I was considering this as well. Since the USB read speeds should average at 15 MB/s you shouldn't notice a degradation in performance.

It would be a good alternative for those of us with older 360s that make more noise with a disc in the tray.
I've only had the game for about a month now and I was wondering.. is it worth trying to level up two similar crafting professions (e.g. Weaponsmith, Armorsmith) while I'm leveling?

Reason I ask is because I'm sitting at 60 right now but because both crafting professions take the same types of ore, I can't seem to make either of them work for my level. I don't remember the last time I crafted anything for my level that I could use.

Also, how useful is Weaponsmithing at level 80? Is it mostly a money-maker or can you craft some one-of-a-kind weapons that make Weaponsmithing a must-have?

I did the same thing with Sona quite recently. They even had an Udyr jungle and Graves ADC. Udyr jungle had probably been watching too many Trick2g vids and thought tower-diving our carry was a good idea. Got a triple out of it and survived on half HP.

Or he could not lower himself to her level and just walk away. Unless she poses a real threat to his life I see no reason to escalate it further by punching the mom. As soon as you start throwing punches as well you lose all credibility as the victim. And the mom could get you charged for battery before you can do the same to her.

The guy was right to just walk away. In fact, he should be applauded because a lot of people would have become violent, verbally or physically, if they were hit like that. 
Your explanation for why it wasn't an unfair shot doesn't hold up. It was a clean punch so it was justified?
"I'm right-handed but if I punched you with my left, would it still be a punch?"

Cheating is cheating. Punching is punching. Neither should be done in a loving relationship. Unless you're into that kinda thing.

> It is overtly clear that was how the game is played.

Having not played a Civ game before, how exactly was this made clear? 

And even if it was made "overtly clear" why would I not attempt to play it? Trying something new is fun.
This was the first Civ game I had ever played so it was a surprise to me.
How do you figure? Seeing characters who weren't even alive in the same century battling it out killed it for me. I would have preferred being able to play as one "emperor" from the start of his reign, trying to overtake the country/world. 

There's nothing wrong with the game, however. Just not for me.

But I guess voicing an opinion is frowned upon.
This is why I couldn't get in to Civ V.

Do you seriously get assist gold for a kill made near a ward you placed? Or do you have to also be assisting in the fight? I know as a support you usually assist in all kills, but if you get assist gold from just ward placement, that would be pretty damn cool.
It looks like the kitten inside is trying to claw its way out.

Too cute.
OP is allergic to fun.
I find it hard to find a good balance between buying wards and buying items that will benefit my team. But now I see most people saying that items come secondary to buying tons of wards.

How does that work if the opposing teams' support is either a troll pick with a lot of damage, or hasn't been buying as many wards but has finished 2-3 big items and can heal/poke/disengage much better than you can?

And how does buying a ton of wards benefit Leona's tankiness if she can only afford one maybe two items? Surely she'll be useless in team-fights sitting at 2,3k HP with very little resistances or armor.

I'm genuinely curious because buying tons of wards over a good balance between wards and items hasn't been helpful to me in the past. I can see from item 13 that you only get your first major item at the 40 minute mark which is just suicide in my limited experience.
Noob here: so.. how many of these spots should be warded, all the time, realistically? Because if your support is buying say, 3 wards each time he/she goes back and the rest of your team is *maybe* buying a ward every other time they go back, you can't have have a ward everywhere can you?

I ask this because every game I'm in someone complains about wards when teamfights have already broken out and our mid is being pushed hard. Hindsight is great but how can people be expected to keep wards up all the time when they have a 3 minute duration and you need between 5-10 every 3 minutes? That's a tough job to put solely on your support, which a lot of people do.

Thanks for this video, I'll be putting it to good use!

Thanks man, I appreciate the tips. :)
While I do try to go into every game with a positive attitude, it just affirms my loss when I see "956 wins" when I hover over my opponents. That's definitely a flaw in my attitude towards the game.

Thank you for your advice! I'll PM you my username and region.
Thank you, that's some great advice. And to be honest I hadn't considered that the people I'm being matched with may well have 1,000 wins but 2,000 losses, making the match up relatively fair.
I never thought about it like that to be honest. Good point.
I am willing to learn and to improve upon my mistakes, I'd also like to have fun while doing so. Being beaten into the ground by players whose skill level far exceeds my own isn't very fun or rewarding.

I'm a gamer and I always have been, so putting a lot of time and effort into one game is nothing new to me. I used to live and breathe high-level end-game raiding in WoW and would constantly be looking to improve my game. Wiping 15 times in a row on Kael'thas wasn't fun but at least I could learn from my mistakes.

I'm sure you understand where I'm coming from and I appreciate your responses. I'll take what you've said on board and just.. keep at it, I suppose. Hopefully someday soon my MMR will lower to the level it's meant to be at and I can start enjoying the game again.
I'm not making excuses at all. I don't have a problem facing someone I have a hope of trading with, but I'm facing people who have played LoL for over a year, sometimes more. I've been playing for 3 months at most.

I'm saying I would have a chance to learn against people of my skill or slightly above, not against someone with years of experience.

Saying "suck it up" is not useful when I'm losing my team games due to the matchmaking system dumping me in match ups that I can't hope to win at my skill level.
So, am I just supposed to keep playing (losing) these games indefinitely until I one day realise that I'm in the normal elo I was supposed to be? That seems really backwards and a huge inconvenience to my team.

I say an inconvenience to my team because I'm a big part of the reason they're losing at this elo and while not everyone is vocal about it, I feel like they would have had a better chance at winning if I hadn't queued up.
Thank you! Sounds like fun.

You should definitely play the full game. It's even better than the DLC.
> You don't, which is fine.
TVs suffer from low resolution and input lag.

And monitors sit on your desk. So you're close to them. A 24" monitor would be more than enough and would allow for a better gaming experience.

My point was that there is no need to add a TV on to the price of a console whereas quite a lot of people will still prefer a monitor for a gaming PC. You don't, which is fine.
You've obviously never seen comparison screenshots between cross-platform games for the Xbox 360 and PS3. Sometimes the Xbox 360 was noticeably ahead, other times the PS3 was ahead.

Comparing specs does matter. And speculating on how the next-gen will pan out is fun.
If you game on your PC I don't know why you would want to do it on your TV. TVs suffer from low resolution and input lag.

If you're going to be building a gaming PC you might as well do it right or not at all.
A vast majority of people already own a TV. Someone who doesn't have a PC won't own a monitor.

Adding the price of a TV on to a console is silly.
A computer, sure. Not a computer that would rival the graphical capabilities of either console, though. You'd be looking at an extra £100 in parts at least and then you need to add on a decent monitor.

Although, an extra £100 isn't THAT much when you're already spending between £400-£500 on a system + games.
Not everyone has a PC capable of running it, though. For a lot of people it's 1 of these consoles or nothing.

I agree though; calling it an exclusive is odd.
Most of us appreciate the effort you went through and the fact that you posted this for all to see. I for one enjoyed reading it and I'm sure many other subscribers of /r/Games did as well.
The joke was working well until the "gas attendant" bit; why would you dump her right then and there, after she used a racial slur, if you were dumping her for being fat in the first place? 

Maybe replace "gas attendant" with "fast food employee" where the fast food employee got her order wrong. Instead of 50 cheeseburgers she only gave her 10. Bad example, I know, but it would make more sense.
I'm aware of all your points, thank you. My personal experience with players in LoL these past few months has been that, while there are a lot of nice people playing, the obnoxious kids are the vocal majority. 

And by kids I don't necessarily mean actual children, but people who act like children because they either don't get their own way or because they can't possibly fathom a reality outside their own and throw ridiculous hissy fits in chat.

I'm sure that the worst and best is yet to come, though. So I will keep at it and hopefully I can convince the people I enjoy playing with that it can get better.
That's a fair point; I hadn't thought of it like that. Thank you.
Like I already said, I didn't like playing PvP early on because of the caustic community of pre-pubescent kids shouting at each other while I'm trying to learn or enjoy the game.

I've had hamsters before and I've never seen one looking quite as dirty as he is. He also looks "moist" as if his water bottle has been continually leaking onto the bedding.

Poor little sod.
That has been my issue with Microsoft since their very first Xbox One press conference; they haven't shown the potential of their new console and Kinect 2.0.
I'm 29 so I'm not old enough to remember days without the mouse. I have however used Arch Linux in a mouseless environment and loved it.

The examples you give about how the Kinect could be used are pretty great. I just have a hard time seeing devs actually using the Kinect in such a way that would make me say "Hey, this Kinect thing is actually pretty cool. I'll be using this all the time from now on." Instead of with most of these gimmicks "Hey, this is cool but ultimately a hassle to use when I could just type or issue a command another more convenient way."

The one major game at E3 that was meant to be Kinect-heavy was Ryse and even Crytek admitted that they went from "Kinect-only" to only using Kinect for simple voice commands, a'la this-gen of Kinect. It didn't do much to sell the idea of Kinect.

Maybe in a year or two.
And what about the people who want nothing to do with the Kinect? Not because they think it could be an invasion of privacy, but people like myself who find that shouting or waving my arms at my TV is one of the most ridiculous ways of getting something done.

The problem with the Kinect being an integral part of the system is that I may one day be forced to use it. I remember the Mass Effect 3 gameplay trailers; all they consisted of were people trying to shove the idea of Kinect down our throats and it almost put me off the game entirely.

The way Microsoft are pushing Kinect it seems only natural that their vision includes games where Kinect is mandatory along-side the controller and that puts even more restrictions on my gaming. "Past midnight? Can't play XYZ game because I'll wake people up with my talking." "Warm day and windows open? Shit, the neighbours will be able to hear me shouting for shields or more ammo and think I've finally gone crazy."

Kinect should be a gimmick. You should never be forced to have it.
Don't forget to add that the PS4's harddrive is user-serviceable and upgradable while the Xbox One's is not.

I've had my Nexus 7 since day one and I've noticed no such issues. In fact, this opinion piece is the first I've heard of such problems.
That's the general idea and a real possibility in the future. But.. Microsoft doesn't have a proven track-record of providing competitive discounts on digital releases, so personally I'll believe it when I see it.
And given Microsoft's track-record on the Xbox 360, I can't see the sense in paying $500 for a machine with inherent restrictions where they MIGHT lower prices for digital and have good deals.

If they do, fantastic. That will breed competition.
Sorry, I misread your comment! Totally agree; there'll be quite a few games released for 360 in the years to come.
I think OP means he won't be sticking with Xbox in the next-gen.

BUYING Windows? Heh, you're a funny guy.
A quick Google on the game would have told you that it needed an online pass. Or you could have asked someone at the store.

Buying a used game that requires an online pass is usually not worth the price, you're right there. There are loads of games that don't require online passes where buying them pre-owned is a great deal.

Maybe pre-judge was a poor choice of words. Everyone judges appearances but to think less of someone because of what they choose to wear is wrong.
No one is saying that people won't have an opinion about you. What we're saying is that if those people pre-judge you based on what you wear they're assholes and not worth your time.

And you should never pander to assholes.
Impostor! 
Is the audio delay you speak an audio sync issue when making videos? If so, I'm glad I'm not alone. I thought it was down to my device (Nexus 7).

Anyone else with similar issues?
This is great, thank you! We've been wracking our brains but I think you just solved the conundrum.

He is such a lovely dog. Settled almost right in from the first day. No interest in other dogs whatsoever but he absolutely loves people and kids. The only time he's bossy is when it comes to cuddles; he absolutely insists on nuzzling up under someone's arm, whether you're expecting him or not. But so well behaved that he never tries to cuddle when we're eating.

All in all I think my mum adopted a winner. 
No, Buddy. :)
Leeds but my mum lives in Hull.
Aww, your dog Telly is a cutie. I'd love to know more about his and Buddy's mix/breed, but all we've been able to pin down so far is the possibility of Corgi/Dachshund.
We have no idea! Well, we think he has some Corgi in him and a bit of dachshund for the colouring. Other than that, we're at a loss.
He's 7 years old. His previous owner was in and out of hospital a lot and they thought it would be better for him to be with a new family because he's such a love-hound.
Sad to say that it made perfect sense to my "British" brain. Even read it in an accent.
What does the stopping power do to the wheels and breaks after such a stop? Can the truck continue driving normally after this? And pull it off again and again without issue?

Who said he's returning? I for one don't think this source is remotely credible. 

All we have at this point is that he was maybe asked to return. He could decline or he may not have been asked in the first place.
So where's the (latest) Nexus 7 build? There's no dev sub-folder for grouper at http://goo.im/devs/paranoidandroid/roms/grouper
It sucks because it's not true. CoD prioritizes local connections; I live in the UK and play against people from the UK or mainland Europe, never against people from the US.
To be honest, both reveals have made me shop around for a gaming PC. I don't like the way used-games are being handled and if I'm not going to be able to rent games anymore then I may as well go with a more powerful gaming machine.
Indeed. The "always-on" is up to the developer.

Me either. I think I used it for all of 30 minutes and then went back to the default setup. 

What really killed PIE for me was that because the top notification is integrated into the menu and therefore hidden by default, you can't see if you have any notifications until you open up the PIE menu. Because of this I ended up being greeted with 10 superfluous notifications when I went to look at my one new notification.


I just had an image of a herd of bunnies, all howling in unison. So.. cute.
In a game as big as Skyrim, some call that fun, others call it a nightmarish undertaking. Good thing these mods exist.
The Xbox version is miles ahead of the PC version in terms of user-friendliness. I've used it a few times to get two friends and one girlfriend into gaming.
The title doesn't say that the cat was theirs so I don't understand why you're calling OP a liar.
Nah, it's called Future Fitness in Leeds. But I've seen Curves around, as well.
We have a gym near where I live in the UK that specifically states "Women Only" in the sign. It really sucks because the gym is only twenty minutes on foot and is the only one close by. 
OP's is funnier.
If these men aren't trying to truly empathize with what happened in Boston then I think this is a horrible message. It's like saying "Well, there's more people starving over here in Africa! At least you poverty-stricken homeless people in New York get to the odd discarded bagel in the trash."

No one's comparing the two. No one should compare the two. No one should use what happened in Boston as a way to shine light on the lack of coverage in Syria.

Some kid should have micro-chipped his kitty friend. I'm sure the "new owners" did what was in their power to find out if the cat had a family already. OP probably didn't add all that to the title because it would have been too long.
The other panda is all like "Be cool dude, be cool; he's bringing us food! BE COOL!"
It would be a good idea to mention that this Kickstarter, as far as I recall, is to bring OpenShot Video Editor to Windows and Mac platforms.
I thought so at first, but now the Sunday Sport used it I'm not so sure. Is Brian even a real name?
I knew exactly what this was based on before watching the trailer and it looks awful. I don't imagine it lasting more than a season.
This was the first time I ever screamed while playing a game. You just couldn't have seen it coming.

Note: I've never played Dead Space or Amnesia, I'm sure those would do it, too. Or maybe not so much because I'd be expecting it, I can't say.

When I did a search for any news related to the Seth MacFarlane Flintstones reboot, the only information I could find was that the reboot is unlikely to happen as of April last year.

Aww, he looks like my childhood Rottie. He was the most loving dog I have ever known and I still miss him loads. He lived to be a healthy twelve years old. :)
Don't be a douche. The guy's allowed to have his own tastes and he didn't badmouth the show.
And all this to give people an alternative to hosting on Tinypic. I doubt MrGrimm could have known how huge Imgur would become.

I'm not sure if you're arguing your point with me, but you should know that we're in agreement here. I don't have anything further to add.
I'm not saying she went out of her way to get him fired, but she did cause it.
This is a terrible idea because it vindicates all the uninformed masses. Has anyone read through the replies to that tweet in particular? Most are screaming sexism now because they say SendGrid fired Adria Richards for calling someone out on a supposedly sexist remark. Firing her is just adding fuel to the fire and making them look like the bad guys when Adria Richards is the real villain for overreacting to a joke she overheard instead of being a human-being and talking to the two guys in question. Her actions cost someone their job.

It would have been better for SendGrid to publicly denounce that they "had her back" as she put it, and to distance themselves from her insane and misguided crusade.

If she's even been fired in the first place. This could very well be a hack of their social network accounts.
She must have deleted that tweet because I can't find it on her Twitter.
What he would been better off doing is upvoting and moving on. One of the main benefits of having an upvote/downvote system is that people shouldn't feel the need to reaffirm the parent comment.
Me either. They both just sound like any other dude but not very much like each other.

No one likes Avatar TBE.. but the call of 1000G in two minutes is too much to bear.
What you said could have been a subjective opinion, but the way you said it was not.
Or "SHUT UP!" or the way they've taken to cutting to a new scene with another character finishing their sentence twice in every episode.

I love Archer but it doesn't need to be repetitive to be good. But I guess it makes it easy for hardcore fans of the show to parrot their favourite lines (see most of the comments here)

You deserve that for calling it a selfie. The camel knew. Camels are wise like that.

How is this not WTF worthy? I can't be the only one who uttered the words "What the fuck?" when I saw the image.
Not just a shop. The title makes it seem like they're opening a new shop in Leeds. They're opening a shop based around the One Direction BRAND.

It's like a Disney Store but with One Direction merch. Overpriced merch at that.

Fuck that.

So the Top 10 highest voted comments on this AMA are complete garbage and a waste of everyone's time, except the person who asked the garbage-question because they can somehow feel like they've spoken to a famous person.

A while back I had a driver who, instead of charging me the morning fare which was due to end in 15 minutes, let me get on the bus and buy my ticket on the way off. 

Funny how the smallest of gestures can totally make your day.
It certainly happens but it does depend on the company and the amount of questions they get over Twitter. Xbox Live Support on Twitter is an excellent example of fast and courteous customer service, but then they have multiple people manning the Twitter account at all hours.
And their little faces. D'aww.. I enjoy finding slimes.
Sadly, not in existence as this is a felt doll. But I bet there are loads of happy hedgehogs out there.
The only way this would affect me as a gamer is if you can unlock guns and/or perks in a multiplayer game, e.g. Battlefield. Paying to have better guns that you'd normally unlock through progression is not cool.

The possibility of the game not being developed by Rocksteady has made me wary. Also, like someone else has already said, I'd much rather have the game centered around Batman (not JL) and set in an open-world Gotham City.
Every single game I've pre-ordered over the past two years I've loved. I may pre-order games early but I keep my ear to the ground and I'm not afraid to cancel my pre-order if the game doesn't look like it'll live up to my expectations.
Ha! Fair enough; I edited my comment to include "(on your keyboard)" since that wasn't clear at first. :)
While this is a valid solution I wouldn't recommend protecting your tweets if you're brand new to Twitter, or at all for that matter. If you protect your tweets it's another barrier potential followers have to get through and it really kills the social aspect of Twitter unless you have a lot of real-world friends who use Twitter and you just want to communicate with them.
The latest version of HoverZoom works well with imgur albums now. Check the top right hand corner for a number, e.g. "1/25" and you can hit right arrow (on your keyboard) to go through the album one image at a time.

As someone with the bad habit of downloading anything that looks good I have to ask: have you watched everything you've downloaded or are you just scratching the surface?
My thoughts exactly. I don't like the idea that people in these Nielsen surveys "help out" their favourite shows; I'd like to think the point is to be impartial and rate shows/episodes exactly how you feel, regardless of your love for it. If the show isn't living up to its potential and hasn't been for a while, the Nielsen ratings should reflect that.

You can flush them but you probably shouldn't. They won't dissolve in water and can very easily clog up your pipes. Depending on where the clog is it could be expensive to get it fixed.

That being said, I use cheaper baby wipes that seem to dissolve better than even the flushable wipes.

I vote on every post I see and I'm sure many others do as well.

"Submitted by" could be taken out of the post info. Many other Reddit apps use a similar format to display post info and I've never noticed a problem with long subreddit names or usernames. I'm sure they can be truncated if needs be.
If you did add swipeable posts you could remove the little arrow in the bottom right and add the functions into the swipeable posts, similar to Baconreader and Reddit News. Swipe post, rollover options to upvote/downvote, hide, comments, userpage etc.

You basically have hot-spots; the top-half of the link is the hot-spot to upvote, and bottom-half is the hot-spot to downvote. You'd need to know the hot-spots are even there though because there's no indication besides a tutorial pop-up at first launch. 

You have to long-press the hot-spots to trigger a response, though. I hadn't used Reddit Flow in a while and forgot to mention that.

It's quite an elegant solution.
An easier way to upvote and downvote would be great! 

For instance, Reddit Flow has the option to ~~tap~~ **long-press** on the upper part of the link to upvote, lower part to downvote. This makes quickly upvoting a bunch of links very simple. Now I'm not saying you should rip Reddit Flow off wholesale, but something nicer than having to tap twice to vote on a link would be fantastic.

Maybe visible upvote/downvote arrows that you can tap on.

Also, I'd like to throw my mock-up in here as well: [http://i.imgur.com/ZL3KO.png](http://i.imgur.com/ZL3KO.png)
Not a problem! And I'll gladly take some stickers! PM'd you my address.
Not to mention the child-safety on the pill bottles, the fact that mints (as far as I'm aware) don't cause heart-attacks and he would be taking a nitro pill if he was currently having a heart-attack. But if he was having a heart-attack surely the family would notice because he would say something and not go for a wander.

Even if all of this is true, the rest of his family are heartless for disowning him for what was clearly a horrible accident that could have been avoided had every one involved been a little smarter.

I don't like to think that everyone on the internet is lying but there are a lot of somethings that don't add up.

You didn't read a thing I wrote, did you? I know you can link to the comments on StackOverflow, I merely stuck up for the OP by saying that it isn't blatantly obvious.
Because the image makes his point better than linking to a page and saying "scroll down to entry x for the subject." OP probably wasn't aware that you can directly link to specific comments; it isn't very obvious on stackoverflow when the "share" button usually only serves to share directly to social networks.

The reason why is because this was a trilogy that used to only be available for PC and Xbox users.

Oh fuck right off. You have NO idea about this person's life. For all you know the person who gifted this could have been saving for years for the perfect present.

Nope, Facebook quickly removed them after everyone screamed bloody murder. And rightly so.

Well, a lot games journalists have given this game a resounding "hell no." OXM even went so far as to create an interactive check-list so you could score the game yourself. Here's an example of one of the items from the check-list:

> Insults relating to sexuality are so innately funny that they don't require context or purpose. Simply calling another person gay qualifies as a top-tier joke. For example, if a character approaches me with a gun, saying "looks like we've got a couple of queers", or "look how gay you are", that's fantastic. Gay people! Can you even imagine?

I'm sure some people would like it, though.
What exactly does it do? Rehost the images?
Judging by your typos, you may want to make your next a virgin.
There isn't much difference between Borderlands 1 and 2, except that in my opinion, Borderlands 2 is far more polished. The characters also have more fun and interesting abilities this time around.
Absolutely, point and click adventures are some of my favourite games. Telltale games are better than letting the genre die out, but the "games" they make are hardly a shell of the classic point and click adventures I grew up with.
Are you American? The game only just released today in the US.
Totally linear. I feel they missed a big opportunity there.
A set of missions where you play as different characters to the main story. It's not free-roam like the single-player game is.
Saints Row. Co-op in an open-world game.

Also, Dead Island. I'm sure there are more.
> Dog cannot help himself.

I read that in [this guy's](http://i.imgur.com/QFRFl.jpg) voice.
My girlfriend and I really enjoyed playing Borderlands 2 together. Her prior experience with shooters was limited but she soon picked it up, and since you're playing co-op you can rely on someone else until you naturally start becoming better at the game.

Does he like Minecraft? If so, the Xbox 360 version is great fun with multiple people.

You answered your own question there. 

Reddit may be owned by a rather large company but they don't get the funding they need to handle all the users, all the time.

They seem to only be releasing trailers for characters that haven't been seen in gameplay footage. Batman, Superman, Green Arrow, Grundy, etc. etc. probably won't have their own trailers.

NSFW language.
It definitely is a spoiler to people who don't follow the Marvel Universe intently. I didn't know, for instance. Now I do, without reading the related comic.
Personally, I err on the side of caution regardless. Rather put something in spoiler tags rather than spoil a plot point for someone.
Please use spoiler tags. :)
The site came up with some pretty good suggestions, unlike most similar sites. 

That's really quite cool! Is it yours?

**Edit:** My personal favourite: CountCrack! When a Baron of Crack just won't do the job.
Either a Main Coon or a Norwegian Forest Cat. The two breeds look quite similar.

At least, they do to me; a layman.
I feel a bit silly asking, but is this issue out? I thought issue 1 was out yesterday.
Hmm, maybe they're having issues on their end. I wish Google would actually tell us what's going on with the feature; it sounded awesome but no one seems to be able to get it to work.
Where did you enable Scan and Match? No one I've seen has had any luck getting Scan and Match to work; for all intents and purposes the feature doesn't exist even though it was meant to be released yesterday.
Trying to find info on this as well. Baffling that there is NO mention anywhere on why this feature isn't live. It definitely isn't working in the UK or anywhere for that matter.
You guys would be better off sucking a country's dick that doesn't loathe its cyclists. Might I suggest Denmark or The Netherlands?

Well, when you put it like that.
I could find a worse way to spend half an hour. There's some seriously crude jokes mixed in with some quite funny ones.

I do wish they'd lay off the fat jokes, though
> But it quickly moved away from that.

This new season they've gone straight back to the fat jokes with full force. Good thing there are still some genuinely funny jokes in the show.
That's a fantastic picture. Well done!
Skyrim and possibly Dragon's Dogma. You can find a demo for the latter on Xbox Live.
That picture makes my insides ache. All that nasty, sweet junk and you didn't bring back any A1 sauce? Shame on you, from a fellow Brit.
We have a lot of the things in that picture available in shops in the UK. We may not have the exact flavour however, in the case of the Oreos, or the same brand name, for example the Kraft Mac n Cheese.
It's already one of the top submissions in /r/JusticePorn.

That's how I usually feel about games as well, but Dishonored really limits the player if they choose the sneaking route. You miss out on so much of the fun that it potentially has to offer. Instead you're hanging around in the rafters, which is great at first, but soon gets boring.
I found sneaking around to be unrewarding. Sneaking is a lot of waiting around and reloading saves because you messed up. Killing people on the other hand can be very entertaining if you find new and ever more gruesome ways of doing it.

You also get to see the kill cams, which if you're sneaking and trying for the "good ending," you don't. I played through the entire game without knowing kill cams existed.
> pretty much reveals that there hasn't been a stealth game half this good since.... well pretty much since Thief 2

Deus Ex Human Revolution is a solid stealth game that I can think of since Thief 2. It's not solely a stealth game, but the stealth is a large part of the game if you want it to be.
I played through mostly non-lethal in my first playthrough and by the end I felt like I'd missed out on so much. I wasn't even aware of kill cam kills until I took out [Havelock](/spoiler) and it triggered an amazing kill sequence.

Playing non-lethal causes you to miss out on things that could make this game great, rather than "just good." That's why I never understood that people were singing its praises in reviews or the like. 

I've yet to go back and play through lethal, but from everything I hear it's a much more satisfying experience.

Something else that bothered me were the NPC's "dynamic" dialogue. Because the developers had recorded 10 or so ambiguous statements or questions to be answered by 10 equally ambiguous responses the world had no feeling of life to it. "Do you think you'll get your own squad after last night?" "I believe so." The former statement making no sense because they were all found sleeping in a few select corners of the map last night, and no captain in their right mind would promote them. They did nothing of worth.

I found Dishonored to be sloppy in so many respects. Deux Ex Human Revolution gave you a much more vibrant world, filled with interesting characters with enemies that you could dispatch in either a violent or silent way.. or both. You had the choice of what to do and you *were* Adam Jensen. You'd been wronged and you had the scars to prove it. Your fellow "teammates" were a boon, not a hinderance. And they were all very interesting without having to dig through a bunch of their personal belongings. And when you did they were even more interesting. 

Corvo's character is non-existent throughout the world, save for a select few references to [the fact that he may or may not be Emily's father](/spoiler). His cohorts are boring and lifeless, and never introduce themselves properly.

Dishonored is a good game, but it falls short of its potential by a mile.

(Sorry, this became a bit of a rant)
There's no saying if it did or not. It could just be two different scripted events, randomly generated.
No need to be sorry, I was just making sure so I was buying the right comics. Thanks! :)

You mean **Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk**, right? Not being pedantic, but Ultimate Hulk vs. Wolverine doesn't seem to exist.
In what way exactly?
So, The Daily Pixel is pretty much The Onion for tech? Why have I never heard of these guys?
They weren't saying it was bad, either; they were giving constructive criticism because they know more about the subject.
It takes more effort to order a pizza than it does to conceive a child. Actually birthing the thing, I can only imagine, takes more out of a person than picking up the phone.
I edited that post before you had replied to it.

> She did not push him, dumbass. Look at the video. You're just making arguments for the sake of arguing. I can already tell you're one of those people that doesn't care about the topic, just about winning.

Did you see her punch him? No, you did not. Unless you were there, on that bus, and in a better position to see what happened than the person making the video, you cannot say that she punched him. End of.

You're not willing to concede that you don't have all the facts. And now that you've devolved to name-calling, I'm done replying to you.
Unless you were there, on that bus, and in a better position to see what happened than the person making the video, you cannot say that she punched him. End of.
No one did. Because the video doesn't show it. She could just as well have pushed him.
This has nothing to do with her being a girl. Don't make assumptions.

Did you see him being punched in the face? No you did not, because the video doesn't show that. For all we know she slapped him or even pushed him. She was calling him out like a child. And he reacted like a child.

This wasn't justice at all. Just two people being idiots due to rage. And just because you think punching someone like that is appropriate in that situation doesn't make it so.
He only felt it warranted that response because he was being egged on. He won't feel the same after he's lost his job for flat-out uppercutting someone on his bus.
Yes, she was making threats. Yes, she hit him first. How hard did she hit him? She's a slip of a thing, probably a slap. That still sucks hard and makes you lose sight of who you are for a second. Did it warrant a massive punch like that that will probably have him jobless before he knows it? Hell no.

This isn't justice. No one was being victimized here; just a bunch of people who think they're still in the playground or ghetto. They were both antagonizing each other.
He was sat there for 4 minutes and 59 seconds, waiting to see the look on your face.
As a games reviewer for a small site, I cannot take Yahtzee seriously in his Zero Punctuation videos. I like his style, but as an entertainer.

I'll agree that if Yahtzee likes a game that it's often a fairly good game. But that's only because the character he portrays in his Zero Punctuation videos has impossibly high standards that no one can take seriously. And if there aren't any blatant flaws in a game he exaggerates minor flaws for comic effect. We get it, he's a joyless bastard; that's the character he's playing in his satire. Mostly it's a funny character but when he starts blatantly talking out of his arse it becomes a bit stale, even as entertainment. Throughtout his Borderlands 2 video I was shaking my head instead of sporting my usual smirk because he couldn't have missed the point of the game more if he'd taken a flying leap at it with a hang-glider attached to his scrotum.

For real reviews from actual reviewers, I like to look at GiantBomb for impartial advice, particularly their Quick Looks. Everyone has their own favourite game news site though, and everyone is welcome to their opinion.
Simon Pegg once instructed his Twitter followers to attack someone for saying that he wasn't a fan. Not flaming, nothing hurtful, he just happened to use Pegg's Twitter handle in the tweet. Pegg's response? "Can y’all flame this dick-twitch.” 

He can be such a bell-end on the internet and there's no need for it.
> Yahtzee has played a lot of video games. He requires originality for a game to be stimulating and we all know that most sequels aren't that original.

This sounds like you're putting Yahtzee on a pedestal a bit. As a reviewer, he's just ok; he's much better at being a satirist which is what Zero Punctuation has always been about.

Why people insist on agreeing or disagreeing with his opinion I'll never know. The only reason Zero Punctuation exists is to entertain.
Brilliant! Thank you for adding the close button so quickly :-) 
Great! I like the feature, so I hope that a close button will be added in future updates. :)
It would be great if you could implement a way to close it. I'm using it in portrait mode on my Nexus 7 and it makes the column on the left quite thin. And sometimes I don't want to read the comments at all.

Great work so far. :)
Once I've selected a news story and the tablet optimized comment pop-up on the right side, is there any way to close them so I can keep browsing normally? The only way I've found is to back out of the app entirely which isn't a great solution.
I do the exact same thing, except substitute "kissing" with punching them square in the nose. But this only happens when I meet new people who are very important in some way; people who I have to impress, e.g. new boss or some such.
Even the drawing on the paper is of our lord. You do good work.
I'd disagree with you there. If someone said either word to me in Dutch I would instantly assume they meant taking drugs in one way or another. While both words can be seen from both points of view (sex and drugs) they were almost exclusively used to describe taking drugs when I was growing up in The Netherlands.
I'm having a hard time coming up with an experience that I would find more frightening than being on shrooms or LSD. 

I don't even like to get drunk because I feel like I'm not in control of my own body, even though I know that alcohol just melts away all inhibitions. Maybe I like being inhibited.
I personally thought the guy from the video in the OP did a much better job of showing the effects of the drugs. This girl was like a kid in a candy shop when it came to XTC; too excited that she was actually taking "hard drugs."
Not a fan personally, and it took me ages to figure out what was different about this image.

Also, what happened to the number of upvotes being displayed in a small, dark grey rectangle to the right? I hope this hasn't change because it looks much better the way it is now.

People seem to be searching for a deeper meaning to this pile of drivel. Sure, there may have been a subtext that this reviewer intended to convey to the lucky few willing to put up with his nonsensical ramblings, but this is anything but clever. What a waste of time.
That would be another great use for the Lifestraw. But GumboVision was implying we could buy one and send it to someone in a country without readily available clean water. That's what I was replying to.
You can't not buy a physical copy of Borderlands 2 for consoles.
I think people took Google Maps for granted until now. It has always gotten tons of credit from little ol' me.
Most people don't know someone who doesn't have clean water.

We can't very well go on Craigslist.
Unfair dismissal. She was fired from her job for a reason that has nothing to do with the way she does her job.

If she was indeed fired from her job for starring in the film.
Yeah, then they wouldn't know that the GPS had been activated. Brilliant.

I can't help but think this thing looks like a joke.

I know it isn't. But still.
I'm not sure if it would be better or worse if this guy's name wasn't Dave.
See, there are more valid reasons than "we'll turn into another America."

Thank you for proving my point.
None of which are valid reasons for ignoring the fact that there are more countries out there that have armed police officers than don't. 

We should not be using America's shortcomings as an excuse for not arming our police when I'm sure they are many other valid reasons out there.
Understandable. I'm sorry if I came across quite harsh in my first comment. Reading through the comments from other people using The United States as a good argument against armed police really annoyed me.

It would be easier to list the countries that don't have armed police officers. The country of my birth, The Netherlands, has armed police.

Again, I'm not for or against armed police.
And what about the many other countries that have armed police officers? The UK is the exception here, but everyone is piss-scared of it becoming another US.

Not for or against armed officers, just against ignorant statements that assume all of the problems in the United States stem from guns.
It's all well and good likening criminal activity here to criminal activity in the US, where the police do carry firearms. What about the many other countries where police officers carry guns? 

I am **NOT** in favour of the British police force carrying sidearms, but having grown up in The Netherlands I am also not against it. What I am against is people comparing the US and the UK police in this case when so many other countries have an armed police force. 

This is a terrible comparison all round and I can't imagine how people could be so short-sighted.
Well, it did help that the burgers were really tasty. ;)
I was waiting for at least 45 minutes in that burger queue, but it was worth it. You guys were doing great work!
Another vote for Dog's Trust. I went to their Open Day a couple of months back and the commitment these people have to dogs, and most of all, finding the right dog for the owner, is an inspiration. 

I will always recommend someone looking for their first dog to go to Dog's Trust.
That kid isn't going to remember his second birthday party, may as well have something that's remotely fun for everyone else involved. At least he'll have some great pictures to look back on.
It's in the sidebar now, thanks. :) Hope that helps people out in the future.

As a non-driving European living in the UK I had some initial issues.
Something to watch: "Wolverine: Chasing the Phantom" on PBS. Great documentary on these amazing animals. A video from the documentary is featured near the bottom of that article.
Good thing a vast majority of those images are photoshopped, mainly seed pods on human skin. That doesn't make it less disgusting though.
I didn't actually. I guess it makes some sense then why /r/gaming has such a hard on for Pokemon.

Fair enough, where are the Eek! The Cat posts then? That was another cartoon that had a game made out of it.
That's what I was thinking. If I look even remotely as young and fit as this guy's 105 year old granddad when I'm 70 I'll be over the moon.
Yes please on the more touching. Not in a sinister way.

*Sinister.*
You're right, of course. But it doesn't hurt to take into consideration that some people may be taken aback by touching someone's bare shoulder, especially when it's someone you don't know.

Though, like Drude said his hand looks to be resting on her dreads.

Definitely not worth the money, but it's the only case that I've seen thus far that doesn't look out of place protecting the Nexus 7. I don't want a tacky looking leather case for something as sleek as the N7; I want something that represents what is inside the case well.

And as people have said before, for the price you'd expect a smart cover.

Thanks for the pictures! I will be very careful with my N7 and wait for a nicer case.
Youre totally right. I dont know what I was thinking.
"Very NSFW"? By Oglaf standards, this is nothing.

I am disappointed.
You should consider using Adblock; it really improves YouTube viewing. I haven't seen an advert in a YouTube video, or the site for that matter, in years.
That's good to hear. The owner and developer of Instapaper iOS is notorious for his outspoken opinions on Android users and how he feels that we don't pay for apps as often as his precious iOS users do.

Does the Android Instapaper client still require you to have a subscription to the Instapaper website? I know 3rd party apps did because they weren't allowed access to the API unless you the user paid for an Instapaper subscription. But since this is being slated as Android's official Instapaper client, that might not apply here.

Distruction, datstruction.. let's just agree to disagree.
I should have been more clear in my last paragraph; I was referring to when meinhyperspeed was the sole developer on Baconreader. It was understandable that development stalled back then because BR had only one developer, causing many, including myself, to jump ship to Reddionic and from there to the many other Reddit apps that came out.

I've edited that last paragraph to make more sense. 
You could very well be right. My initial questions was just a thought that struck me as a bit weird.
Because Steam seems to dictate when these super-crazy Larry sales happen and only handing 70% of $2 to a developer when they're expecting 70% of $39.99 seems fairly wrong.
Disney: Giving children everywhere realistic expectations, one soul-crushing realisation at a time.

Hey, it's better than pandering to them.
I hope so, good luck. :)
I'm surprised that you couldn't get used to Reddit Sync. Reason I'm surprised is because it's the only Reddit client that I have easily been able to get used to, whereas before I was always hopping to the latest and greatest, e.g. Baconreader to Reddionic, etc.

I agree though, OneLouder hasn't been a great switch. Although even before the switch development was slow at best, and many threads had been started asking for ETAs on an update that was already a week past the last ETA. The inability to keep to ETAs is what made me switch in the end. Granted meinhyperspeed was one man who also had a job outside Baconreader, so it was understandable to an extent.
So what percentage do Valve take during these Steam sales? Surely they don't take 30% of $2 and hand the rest of that to the developer or publisher, right?
You do NOT want to image search "bieberconda" with safe search turned off. 
I've continued using DeskSMS by ClockworkMod. It sends any text you receive through Google Voice and you can reply using any Google Voice client on your computer or tablet, including the official one. Works a treat.
Reddit Sync is another very good Reddit app. Worth a look.

Not until San Andreas you didn't. Vice City was a little over the top, but that was mainly due to the characters as it has been with every GTA game. San Andreas was the first GTA game that introduced balls to the wall insanity, a'la Saints Row, and frankly the two games should be kept seperate. 

San Andreas was great, but as you got closer to the end of the story, it was much less of a GTA game.
