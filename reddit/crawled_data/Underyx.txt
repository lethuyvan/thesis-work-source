Hey, johhnytexas, just a quick heads-up:  
**alot** is actually spelled **a lot**. You can remember it by **it is one lot, 'a lot'**.  
Have a nice day!
Based on the title, I was thinking this could mean a feature where a stronger team or player, specifically in Hearthstone, could decide to 'gift' some sort of advantage to the enemy, such as giving them a card. Now that would be quite interesting.

Huh! Quite ballsy of them to be trying to act funny in such a dangerous situation.
That's how JPEG compression works, it has much more artifacts near edges (since they're areas with more detail.) Just compare with any other edge on the picture, such as the balloon's.

Also if it really were a rectangular image superimposed on the blown up balloon, why would OP bother to cut out a small square on the bottom left corner of the rectangle?
Who was the driver saying that to?

My bad.
Can you help me out maybe? I have a weird name I have no idea how to spell for English speakers. It's 'Nagy' (which is in Hungarian) and the characters 'gy' refer to something like one softened D letter. You have the same sound in Vladimir, or Djokovic, for instance, but English speakers seem to say these with a hard D so it doesn't help with the explanation. Sometimes the word *during* is said with this soft D but this doesn't really help either, since some say this with a hard D as well, and for these people I really have no idea how to describe the Hungarian *gy*.

So, how do I explain how to say Nagy?
Just to sink more money in it.
I've got bad news about your A10nso.
Yep, in qualifying they didn't use those angles even once, so I'm pretty sure I was right.
Just theoretically thinking about it or even looking at the preview screens still doesn't give them enough info on how these cams work in an actual broadcast composition.
I dunno, isn't this the first time the production crew got a chance to control the feeds from the cameras in action? Asking since they probably didn't have a everything set up for broadcast during winter testing. It makes sense that during practice they'd use a more diverse set of angles to properly wrap their head around how they all work and look by the time quali and the actual race starts.
I knew it as soon as I saw the watermark.

I think your assumption that saying just "here's a link to donate" in a press release would cause lots of others to donate is completely baseless. Such press releases end up with miniscule reach compared to stunts like the one they're doing right now. There's a reason you've never seen a "YSK this company donated $1M to this cause, and you should donate too."

Most likely this one Reddit post alone has done more to raise awareness and get people to donate than your suggestion would have.
So you want to buy a bunch of instances to donate ten cents per instance?
your crazy 12 letter name
You're ignoring the fact that the reason they have such a high maximum budget is because they could get it approved by attaching some sort of positive PR benefit.

Since these clicks create value for the company, they actually did raise the maximum budget from what it would've been if whoever came up with the idea was looking to get a simple grant for the cause.
I don't think letting people have personal preferences is too useful in a programming language. Just imagine if you were allowed to use synonyms of `if` to write the same code. Some people would prefer `when x < 3:`, some would prefer `if x < 3:`, some `is x < 3?:`, and in other code you'd see `in case x < 3:`.

Your argument of the language not making choices on how you write code still applies. But would this add any value while adding tons of confusion and mental effort? I don't think so. My example sounds ridiculous, but I think if historically languages all approached syntax like Python does, a language letting people use arbitrary indentation would sound just as ridiculous.
What else do you want to base the syntax on? It's literally just a way to let humans understand the instructions for the computer.
Ah, right, sorry, mine is localized into a currency that I'm not so familiar with, so I just checked how many points I had and it seemed like roughly a point per 5% of dollars spent in the past year.
But isn't it 5% of dollars spent converted to points, and then 100 points converted into one dollar? Or does that apply only to previous (last year's) purchases?

Cause that would make it a 0.05% loyalty discount.
There's several seconds of lead up so it's easy to look away (as I did.)

We have a small room with just a few people. It's sometimes useful for setting alarms (for stuff affecting the whole team,) asking questions relevant to whatever we're talking about, and stuff like that. I guess mostly we just play around with it though. I definitely don't do anything personal with it. I got this Home Mini bundled with my phone, and had no better place to put it since I already had a Home in the only room at my place.
Glad to hear you're finding Crane useful (:
Nope, doggo's tongue looks like a ball, confused me too.
'Tony Hawk', like that skateboarder! I wonder what he's up to these days.
Since 2.0 is not stable yet, we haven't actually tried Crane with it yet. Not sure if the upgrades API was changed, but I wouldn't be surprised if Crane was actually incompatible.
We already have a cuckoo internally though :D
Ah, I see, I understand how that can be confusing; the two features described there are:

- 'start the new image before stopping the old one': this means running the old and new versions parallelly instead of first stopping the old one and after it's stopped, starting the new one (the default behavior of Rancher)
- 'wait 10 seconds after launching each new container': this is just a really simple way of slowing down the rollout of one service, when upgrading its containers one-by-one

Actually, I did mention rancher-gitlab-deploy in the article, and while I believe it happens to also support these two features, it still lacks plenty of Crane's magic (:
I don't entirely understand what you mean. the default gitlab runner image is configured per server, and how do you even mean combining it with cattle?

I also don't think I know what you're referring to by 'more control on which container starts first'; Crane doesn't really do anything like that.

GitLab's pipeline success messages are way less rich, not even comparable I'd say:

>foo/bar: Commit 4a41b71d of some-random branch by john.doe succeeded in 210 seconds

I don't even think there's a way to tell if what succeeded was a deployment our just a test run.
Yeah, somebody mentioned this once, yup :(

We have this theme of naming stuff after birds, and it felt very appropriate to use *crane* for our tool that moves containers around. I guess we should've checked for a name clash first.
Thanks! I'll go get myself some rain ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ

I'm pretty sure you're the one making the claim that Google is complying with NSA requests, so the burden of proof should lie with you; I was just mentioning why I'm having a hard time believing you.

Either way, I have no cold hard evidence for that readily available, I just heard anecdotes over drinks from Google engineers.
Okay, what you call 'manipulating me into clicking ads' I call offering me relevant ads instead of annoying disinteresting ones. If I hear you listening to Tycho, and I say, hey, you might like Caribou's music as well, would you consider that to be me 'manipulating you into listening to Caribou'?

And again, do you have any evidence of all this? Or you're basing everything you've said so far on just the possibility that it could be happening?
Source on that statement? Last I checked they weren't selling any of the data, and were only using it themselves to optimize ads.

And how is this related to the NSA again?
To the best of my knowledge none of that was happening with Google's consent and they've been actively fighting back ever since that came to light.
How do you know they send it to the NSA?
So, I'm quite happy with [how they turned out](https://i.imgur.com/koUwOGC.jpg). Thanks again!

I'd say crane is a bit smarter, it supports stuff like

Pretty dishonest to compare at the end that zcash went for $4000 while Bitcoin was at $1400.

1. It peaked for just a tiny bit and dropped almost immediately to below $100.
2. The value of one arbitrarily chosen unit doesn't tell you anything about the value anyway. There's ten times less zcash than Bitcoin in circulation, so if they were even just of equal value, zcash would have had to been priced at $14000.
You're going to see ads anyway. Might as well let them make them relevant ones so they can be useful to you.
...which is also good for the users.
Cause they're making a point of coming up with these tricks to demonstrate how they use your data for nice things. Other than that they're not too different from Google, Facebook, et cetera, they're just more... theatrical about it, so you don't need to exercise your imagination to understand how it's good for you when they have your data. Sadly, almost no one actually does that.
And lo, you still don't feel the urge to provide the unit of measurement to make your comment anything other than 100% pointless.

Don't you think it's immoral to use Google without giving them any data in return, if that's their whole business model?

So how do you imagine data stored in the pagefile is addressed?
Nice, you're getting upvoted and don't even need to argue with people who don't believe this, [unlike me at release](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/5xbe5a/slug/deh6353). This has been bothering me ever since.
Other than the publicly cited reasons, I wouldn't be surprised if they wanted to use a different engine that is easier to work with to cost them less man-hours.
But this time the IP is way more valuable than when the first game came out. And there's also justification for including that in the price; the developers most likely had to pay a hefty licensing fee to be able to release the game.
I think you're not really making an effort to try and imagine how Sessions would've felt if that really was a casual encounter. Or vastly overestimating the human mind. Can you list the last three times you had oatmeal?
>You'd expect if you were buying the ROM and emulator from Nintendo you'd be getting the game they originally sold on their hardware not some randomly dumped ROM.

In actuality though, I, along with I bet at least 99% of players, would not care _at all_ if all bits in memory were matching the original. I'd be much more focused on the game.
Well, maybe this one was less memorable? Is that somehow out of the question?

Where?
Seems like most people actually don't understand why they themselves hate it.

It's because they added a blogging platform on forbes.com. They let practically anyone publish their own blog there. When you do that, you end up with crap blog posts — these posts get shared cause of their low quality or polarized views, and people on reddit think that Forbes wrote them, so they hate on Forbes, which is sorta like saying reddit is stupid because of a post of one user.
The wording sounds silly, but I guess the above commenter's point was that the incentive is to make one good game that sells well, instead of a hundred crap titles that net $200 each.

That argument is like saying 'the screen works fine without Android, so why not keep only the bootloader?'

I don't think there really are much better options (we all use PyCharm or a regular text editor at my company) but the following exist:

- [Wing](http://wingware.com/) — They're Python specific, but I never even saw a reason to try it out
- [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/) — Microsoft's huuuuge IDE, designed mainly for other, more enterprise-y languages, but seems to be catching up on Python as well recently. Not too impressed though.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) — A lightweight text editor that has powerful tools (including an integrated debugger) regardless, and is under very swift development. I'm actually seeing myself use it fairly often even on large projects.
- With the proper configuration/plugins, you can be pretty productive with any other reasonable text editor: Atom and Sublime Text, or if you're more adventurous, vim and emacs.

Most likely they just misread that comment. It's funny, sure, but definitely not worthy of being condescending about.
Alright, sure, me too.

Hi, /u/Googler10!

Here's a friendly request that you stop using all caps in your post titles. Other users of the subreddit find this behavior rather annoying.

Thanks!

But those are no more error messages of C than any first party error message would be.
C doesn't really have error messages. Your code either doesn't even compile or it just crashes at runtime. Also, banks wouldn't use C anyway.

That's not what you asked, you asked *why they can* set these rules instead of *why they do*.
Their comment wasn't about you.
This is definitely the most hostile comment I've ever upvoted.
Why, people? This feels so pointless. No one will even remember in two days.
Actually OP made this post to spam their website.
Well, I don't think it's working. To me, it just looks mean-spirited and stupid.
My comment was more about the eloquence with which t_d users typically argue this point. The point itself is pretty obvious and not very debateable.
Ah, t_d's classic argument.
And 'digital exploration of interior design' is not referring to the pillow/blanket fort, but to the other subplot of the episode, with 'digital' meant to be read as its 'with fingers' definition.
I don't like the other answers. Basically it's all about just having demand for it. If you make origami swans and people pay you for them, you basically have the equivalent of a currency already. They could theoretically go to each other and hand over 10 swans for a slice of pizza, or similar.

So, about the question of how people start viewing these things as something with real value: in most cases, with national currencies, it stems from the government backing it. It's very convenient for citizens of a nation to use their national currency, so you can be fairly certain the currency will be used and is a reasonable investment right from the moment a government announces it.

In the case of Bitcoin, interest was driven by the technological innovation. For some people it was more convenient to use Bitcoin than cash, some found it to be a nice way to safeguard money, and others predicted that more people will want to use it later. If people will want to use it later, and you know about this now, you can purchase some Bitcoin and then sell it later at a higher price to those who want to use it. These speculators then just swarm the market, until the currency is mostly just them trading it at varying prices, trying to predict how many other speculators and users will want to get in on Bitcoin in the future.
Huh, last time I checked they only had ~~5~~ 7!

Thanks for the in-depth response, /u/sun_wolf!

To be perfectly honest, I can't justify spending this time to research the topic in much more detail. I, however, know very well the state of mind when you're skeptical about everything in relation to someone/something based on their history, and I understand your viewpoint a lot better now.

Thankfully, my opinion on the matter is absolutely inconsequential, so I'm comfortable with just leaving it at that and not leaning either way.

On that note, I'm still very much against discrediting Politifact based on OP's blurb, taken out of context, which well over a hundred people seem to be taking part in in this thread.
Well, it's still a big misrepresentation of Politifact's analysis.

Anyway, if you have any further information about this $400MM dispute I'm willing to go off topic and go over it.
Sure thing! '1 in 4 is' just sounded weird and incorrect to me so I went and checked. Turns out actually we both were wrong ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
In reality though, their argument's basis is not this, but what's described in the next sentence, cropped off from OP's screenshot:

>Iran had a legitimate claim to the money, as the United States owed it to Iran as part of a resolution to a decades-long financial dispute.

So it was the repayment of some sort of debt that was going to be due either way. Just delaying that really sounds somewhat different from ransom, especially since the resolution was already agreed upon. So the claim is somewhere between true and false.
Isn't the point of this to just point out there's more homeless women that one would assume? I would've assumed like 1 in 10 or something.
[You're wrong.](http://english.stackexchange.com/a/64581)
Can you link me to any flexible ticket program that doesn't require you to announce what flight you're taking 24 hours in advance and that allows you to select full flights?
This is not the full story. Checking in is a thing because of the no-shows who don't tell the airline that they're not going after all. This is why they bump passengers at the gate and not earlier - they need to close check-in to know how many passengers they actually have ready to board.
Yes, that's correct.
But then look at the [actual chart](https://i.underyx.me/2017-04-12T13-14-18.qipwn.png)
>Their stock is down by a good margin.

No it isn't. Google 'UAL stock' and check the 1mo tab.
I think there was a lot of misunderstanding here, I work in the industry and have already known about these shenanigans. In that comment I was trying to refute the suggestion that involuntary deplaning is profitable, not that overbooking is profitable.

Thanks, anyway.
There is indeed no refund for no-shows. So if you have 100 seats and expect one person to miss their flight on average, you can just sell 101 tickets to have 1% more revenue. This translates to an even larger increase in profits, since this last, no-show passenger has virtually no expenses associated with them (you don't pay for extra fuel, staff time, per-passenger fees, etc.)
How would they make more money like this? They don't just refuse to take the passenger, ever. They give them a seat of the same value and some extra money, too.
It it really causes more problems than the profit it brings, why do you think airlines are doing it?
No, the reason they overbook is all the no-shows. Their goal with overbooking is not exactly to pay for someone to be removed from the plane. They don't like to do that either.
Be wary of drawing any actual conclusions off of this. Not only is your sample size really small here, but there also are probably tons of other things that could be causing the change after noon.
Also 4,650 vehicles in transit.

Their goal for the first two quarters has been set to 47,000-50,000 deliveries. Looking pretty good.

So to clarify, your only problem with this discussion is the wording?

The article says

Do you think this is acceptable /u/username3? Get out of here.
I might've been unclear. You can absolutely have better design, but it won't be 'out-designing', i.e. you won't beat Google on the basis of your better design.

Glympse didn't really have anything unique that would've justified an acquisition. It's not like they had a unique product (especially not a hardware product) like Nest, they had no valuable data like Waze, all they had was something no one else really bothered to implement at the time, really.
>Sorry Ted, looks like our improvements budget has been cut. You're going to have to write less code this quarter.
I work at a Czech tech company. I've heard several people at least say it before. Most say just 'Czech,' though.
You don't just out-design Google with a competing app. They had it coming either way, which makes it smart that they didn't put more effort into their app.
Except you were saying 'fuck pycharm,' which is not something a normal person says if their only problem is that they do something differently than 99% of users and their way isn't the default.

So I guess everyone wrongly assumed you *must* have something more interesting to say if we ask you to elaborate.
But it's dropping way slower than the chart makes it seem like. You're just being dishonest here, regardless of your point.
Start the axis at 0% and end it at 100% to make this chart actually useful instead of just unnecessarily scary.

Are you suggesting that Jon's statements during that 2 hour stream were jokes?
That... does sound a bit familiar. Maybe I misremembered him saying he doesn't want to get political on the JonTron channel?
No, he didn't get into politics until very recently, and only on Twitter. In his latest video he even said he doesn't want to deal with politics at all.
Naw, that would be cheating.

I've asked this elsewhere in this thread but I feel like the question is actually more appropriate re: the quoted part.

I take your statement to mean that we agree that Trump is also someone who is mainly concerned with themselves and will take advantage of tax loopholes if given the chance.

Having agreed on this, do you think Trump can be trusted to close loopholes that he and his associates can make money off of? And if you do, why?
Do you trust Trump to work towards closing the loopholes he himself takes advantage of?
It shouldn't be this controversial to denounce those who mindlessly argue these bullshit arguments.
>>That's not a feature you'd factor into the hardware's price.

>why not? thats literally a feature

I'm saying it's not a feature **you factor into the hardware's price**.

>battery life still well over 60+ hours

One comes with a battery, the other doesn't. That's a hardware difference that explains some of the cost.

> still much cheaper than joycons

I thought all this time we were arguing about the pro controller. The joycons are actually two controllers, so it's not really fair to compare it to one Steam Controller.
>steam controller does in fact have HD haptic feedback

I dunno, when I turn on rumble on mine, it's just the two touchpads that do some screeching noise instead of actually vibrating.

>its also full rebindable, is able to load and unload contoller profiles via cloud

That's not a feature you'd factor into the hardware's price.

>battery life has also been reported to last 60+ hours.

But it doesn't even have a battery. You supply your own.

>who the fuck cares about NFC readers?

Mostly people who use Amiibos.

Also, from your comment above:

>its like 40 bucks

If you consider 50 bucks to be 'like 40', then yes. But I vote we just keep calling it 50 bucks.
I don't really see myself playing them often.  There's basketball, hockey, and a fighting game where you have to fully cut the other player out to win.
You can try parental controls, it should have playtime reports.
Yeah, it's so difficult to remove I thought mine was broken or that I had broken it when I first tried to take it off.
In the main 'story' mode it has 3 worlds with 15 levels each. Then it has some (maybe half as many) bonus levels with 4 characters to control, and three 1v1/2v2 minigames.
Yeah, I know.

I feel a bit like this was a deliberate strategy from Trump and co. since right after the elections there was a lot of talk about these 'blatant lies' websites and how their effect favored the Republican party. These were commonly referred to as 'fake news', but then Trump started calling everything else fake news. This totally murkied up the definition, made the word sound meaningless to most (that's the power of semantic satiation), and made people sick of hearing the term over and over again, thus totally nullifying the opposition's arguments.

It's scary that manipulating culture like this seems to be more effective than providing real arguments.
I think he meant 'fake news' in the sense of 'publication that makes factual claims they know to be false to get ad views and/or sway political opinion', like the ones we saw before the election.
If they copy-paste something from the FreeBSD kernel's source, then they need to state they took something from the FreeBSD kernel, simple as that.
That's not what the screenshot says at all. This is just a copyright notice that some part of the FreeBSD kernel is present in one way or another in the Switch. Not necessarily used by the operating system itself.

They'd have to put up this notice even if they just copy-pasted ten lines of code from FreeBSD for use in their own software.
We don't know which country you're from though.
Yep, I felt the same way. Also, cause of Usami magically summoning a cow right at the start.
I bought the Switch today. Saw the hero announcement video multiple times on reddit, never even cared enough to take precious time from Zelda to watch it.
Novelty?
Your article's second screenshot's text says 'enter the 12 digits'.
A PSA that the Switch falls over if you push it in tabletop mode?
Alright, fair enough.
But it seemed like it should take just one second to put it back, and you're already holding the switch anyway when it comes off.
How would they? I'd imagine that when it comes off it makes a huge \*SNAP* sound, the kind that makes your heart skip a beat.
How much is the 3DS battery life?
Because they weren't in any particular order.
But the actual proper way to format/markup this list of games is neither having five paragraphs, nor one paragraph with line breaks—instead, it's using list syntax:

- Zelda (duh)
- Fast Racing RMX
- Snipperclips
- Bomberman R
- 1, 2 Switch
>supper fantastic

That's a weird phrase but I guess dinner is pretty great so I get where you're coming from.
And according to a vague memory of mine of some podcast I listened to, lost luggage is also auctioned off in Atlanta.
The key difference, I think, is that:

1. The Nintendo Switch can't be considered unfinished by any means. It ships without some unimplemented extra features (browser, virtual console) which aren't an integral part of it at all. I've never used either on the Wii, for instance.
2. Nintendo is a reputable, and mature company, unlike indies with early access titles. They have billions of dollars in cash reserves. There's zero risk of them not being able to deliver something they promise to (and I can't remember a precedent for this from them, either.)
If that's true, no one will buy it until the software is there, right? So who cares? How is that bad?
Even if we ignore all the launch titles, what would be bad about releasing a lump of silicon? Who cares, then?
> The entire online system is unfinished

That's not hardware.

> third parties seem to only have had three months or so to develop games 

That's not hardware either.

Unless there actually is a problem with the hardware, I see no reason to delay its release.
Good news! A [press release today](http://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-will-not-have-virtual-console-at-launch-1792668183) confirmed Fast RMX (along with Shovel Knight) to be a launch title.
Accidental ad clicks however are way less profitable.
Sorry, I wasn't that interested in the game so I never actually tracked down the source before parroting this rumor. Now after a bit of searching around, all I could find is a few mentions of this on Reddit and NeoGAF.
>But Nintendo is very conservative when it comes to loss leading. They've apparently never sold a system at a loss.

I believe when they dropped the price of the 3DS they said it'd take a year or so of manufacturing pipeline optimizations until they could be selling at a profit.
The Fast RMX developers said they were ready to launch as soon as the eShop opens. Since there are games in your list above that are digital only, Fast RMX might very well launch on March 3.
Huh, I had a complete Berenstæin bears moment here. Sorry about that.
But no one's interested in it. ~~Also, you spelled Saturo wrong.~~

Hey, /u/GoogleAndroidWearCM, just one note for later: reddit automatically marks comments and posts that use URL shorteners as spam, so all four of your comments which linked through goo.gl were invisible to everyone else until now (I've manually approved them.)

We will once OTAs actually start rolling out (:

Well, that's not really new at all. I'm pretty sure anti-tamper refers to the way they're trying to prevent people from patching all of this logic out, bypassing the check for an auth ticket.
1. Most players around that level are not Miracle or anyone you'd recognize.
2. You might think that but I assure you you'd get bored of it quick.

And even then, this would just split the matchmaking queues into half again, causing even higher queue times.
Yeah, so spoiled, taking the refund they were offered for not receiving the game. So typical of Nintendo players, they always take the refunds.
Also, Android won't autoopen the login pages of public wifi networks.
There was a pretty funny comment by an 'oblivious' commenter who had thought Trump had been promising a muslim *band* all along.

Edit: Oh, and it was followed up by band names puns, most of which could've been considered offensive.
Well that's not what I was looking for though. I played through Human Resource Machine but it just felt a bit boring and shallow to me.

TIS-100 on the other hand had amazing puzzles that really made me think, and the whole backstory with the fictitious assembly language was just awesome.

Anyway, I'm not saying that TIS-100 is absolutely, objectively better, or anything. It's just that Human Resource Machine is not 'far preferable'.
Well, I had fun with it. It's an assembly language that's specifically designed to be fun to work with.
>far preferable to TIS-100 for a variety of reasons. 

Unless you're a software engineer.

I bought a 240 GB OCZ Vector 150 back in 2014 for my gaming PC, and it died a month ago. I've RMA'd it and was given a 240 GB Toshiba OCZ TL100 as a replacement.

As far as I can tell from online benchmarks this is a huge downgrade. (I haven't had a chance to actually try it out yet.) Is my assumption correct? Can I do anything about it? (If that's relevant, the retailer is in Hungary.)
Game developers seem to be patching Denuvo out around 6-12 months after release, though.
Where do you think the money you 'save' comes from when you help people buy an erroneously priced ticket? Is this not reflected in the airlines' later pricing, making other tickets more expensive?

I went first

See https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegameswap/comments/5kkcg3/h_stardew_valley_jackbox_party_pack_2_skullgirls/dbopips/
That's alright. I'm also interested in Hyper Light Drifter. In the meantime I've also wrote up a full list here: https://barter.vg/u/1e99/t/

Would you mind picking whatever would make Hyper Light Drifter and/or Witcher 3 work for you?
Alright, how about jackbox 2 + stardew for witcher 3?
The only one I'm interested in is Remember Me but it seems less valuable than either of my three, so I'll hold out for something better :(
No worries, alright.
Sure, if I count with the all-time low prices according to ITAD:

 - Stardew: 9.37 EUR
 - Jackbox: 8.04 EUR
 - Rust: 6.45 EUR
 - CoH 2: 3.24 EUR

So around 27 EUR. How about [Stephen's Sausage Roll](http://store.steampowered.com/app/353540) + [Card City Nights](http://store.steampowered.com/app/271820) as gifts which are ~26 EUR?

They don't have usage limits right now for CI but they're going to introduce them soon, for everyone. LineageOS would almost certainly be nicely asked to stop building all those nightlies, and the introduction of the limits might be expedited. 
Oh, I thought you linked that because of the fact that GitHub didn't shut them down. My bad.
1. Source code hosting and building images are very different and the benefit for providing it for free to OSS is not the same.
2. The case you linked was about an issue about how GitHub *wasn't able to keep providing the service for free*. See the resolution of this issue, [CocoaPods ended up having to largely reduce their usage of GitHub](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Master-Spec-Repo-Rate-Limiting-Post-Mortem/).
3. In this case GitHub is saying that 5 CPUs were in full use for this project, which had to be changed. At >540 hours per day, LineageOS would need to use at least 22 CPUs concurrently.
https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/
I'm very skeptical that any provider would just give away 540 CPU hours per day (that's 80 minutes per 403 devices) to them.

'Get hosting and running for free' works for open source projects when they're a few thousand line long Python libraries, built every few weeks when someone commits, but there's always a disclaimer with usage limits.
Well of course the problem is not as much _having_ that build system as it is _running_ it.
>Just have an automated build system

Those are exactly the resources they lack. That, and hosting the images.
How do you decide what the time limit should be?
Yay, so that probably means the end of that awkward mascot, Cid, as well!

None of this gives you, commenters, the right to just misrepresent Zuckerberg's/Facebook's statements.
Come on.

1. *'Facebook is a HUGE influencer'* can be a valid statement even if Facebook is not able to convert Democrats to Republicans or vice versa.
2. *'Same thing. Either the content on Facebook impacts people or it doesn't.'* Such a false dichotomy. How about neither of those absolutes? It's possible that fake news does not affect the elections while their 'get out the vote' messages demonstrably do.

Other sound-based strategies include the use of high-frequency sonic buzz generatorsmeant to be audible only to young people. Housing estates in the UK have also put up pink lighting, aimed to highlight teenage blemishes. In many cases, there is little data to show how well these more unconventional strategies actually work.
>1) Why aren't user data and user-created content separated? If they are, why did they delete both, and not only the former?

It takes effort to separate them.
As /u/mynsfwacctlol beautifully put it in /r/trackers:

>I can't really begin to explain how much of a loss this is.

>This was the biggest digital repository of music the world has ever seen. Spotify, iTunes, even Oink in its prime were kittens to what what.cd built.

>I made this analogy in another thread, but it was the digital library of Alexandria for music.

>It inspired me to learn about audio engineering, learn how to program, and most importantly, introduced me to music that changed me in ways I can't even begin to put into one tiny little box.

Yes yes yes! That's it, thanks <3
Nope, doesn't sound like it :(

Thanks for the guess anyway :D
Elections are not statistical evidence of how 'good' any one person is.
It doesn't sound too undemocratic to not give a group more voting power even if they voted to get it.
Seriously, a 28.6% chance for a Trump win is the closest I've seen said.
Your country is fucked, y'all.
Wow, I was very skeptical when opening the comments here, wondering what someone could possibly add to this, but this is actually something that I'm glad was said.
I do, which is why contrary to you, I didn't actually make generalizations that 'the entire software industry' is doing something. The cross section of companies where Docker is not being adopted and that aren't so enterprise that they're  locked in to Microsoft technology already anyway must be smaller than you make it sound like.
It's 2016, use Docker.

I don't get that criticism at all. A mishmash of syntaxes? Let's ignore that this is not actually called a syntax, but even then, how is this any different from any other package manager?
To them I would respond that the free market is supposed to balance itself out (as it already is sort of doing with Linux being a viable alternative as an OS) and to keep society afloat we need to abide by the rules even when it feels unfair. I feel like for most people going with Linux instead would only be a minor inconvenience and that they do not deserve to ignore the rules for such a marginal gain in quality of life/comfort.

For context, I use macOS on my work laptop, use Linux as my main OS on my PC at home, and I own a Windows 10 license.
>I can never get the uninstall command right the first time.

How do you manage to do that? I'm fairly sure that you can run just either `brew remove package` or `brew uninstall package` :/
I disagree. That's not what the original purchaser agrees to when buying the key.
Ok.
Even if from an economic standpoint it could make sense, you could also take morality into account.
Yeah, but the question was _why_?
You actually have more than one already. Just switch to the discover tab and you'll see [all these different sections](https://i.underyx.me/2016-09-20T20-32-28Z.2LtUY.png), each based on a genre/group of artists. This is the exact same thing as Discover Weekly, just presented in a different format.
You mean something like

>How could they possibly launder money selling digital goods online?

perhaps?
I decided to reply to convey that contrary to how you might have been thinking I was 'arguing' just to point out your error, I was actually seeking to be proven wrong to learn more about the topic.
deleted comment by /u/APeacefulWarrior:

>"For awhile, I thought..." Why are we arguing about this?

---

Because I was wondering if there was something I didn't know about that would make it a reasonable assumption that it's a money laundering operation.
But as far as I can tell they were only distributing via itch.io and Steam, which should result in just a few regular lump payments.
> I thought DH was some sort of money laundering operation

How could they possibly launder money selling digital goods online?
I'm at the final boss of **Paper Mario: TTYD** right now and I can already feel that empty feeling coming up that will settle in once I'm finished with it and am saying goodbye to the charming world and loveable characters of the game.

What should I move on to? I feel like the sort of quirky and sometimes meta humour is a huge part of why I enjoyed **TTYD**, which is the same reason I loved **Undertale**. Related to this, I loved the part where [Premise of Chapter 3](#s "I got to work my way up the rankings in the fighting ring") cause it introduced totally new rules and a different frame to the game. I might be looking for something like this. Other, optional qualities in the game I'm looking for are:

- long main storyline
- upbeat atmosphere
- couch-playable
- not too difficult

Also, probably way too much information for this thread, but I'm tracking games I'm interested in/have finished/etc. here: http://trello.com/b/62mKUE3X/games
Name one manufacturer who doesn't already provide updates 'up to 24 months' as the OP says.

I think you got downvoted here because you were arguing against your strawman, not the comment you replied to.
But also, a lone dude voting for the better candidate, or the lone family that recycles doesn't make a difference either.
Applause to the Chrome team! This seems like the best possible solution. Got rid of an annoying feature, managed to resist making Chrome more complex, and still provided a way for the few people who want to keep using the feature to turn it back on.

I don't know of a lot of product teams who would check all three boxes.
>99% appear to be up and running on our servers

This means that 99% of players are connected to the servers, it doesn't say anything about whether the game is actually working for them. This also doesn't include the players who are getting crashes.

Also, there's 190k players in-game now. Sure this number should be growing if issues were that rare.
>something like 98% of the player can play the game perfectly

Where the hell did you get this number from?
Tried this just now, GTX 1080, did not help at all.
18 MB patch just released. Will report back about whether it changes anything.

Edit: Nope, game still practically unplayable, with a GTX 1080. Tried different V-sync and FPS limit values, nothing helps.
I disagree. I can be done with a newsletter with just having a glance at the sender.
Goddamn reposts.
I live in Czechia and love the fact that I don't have deal with the awkwardness of using a multi-word formal name anymore whenever I tell people this.
I can do this for you, with no need for the extra 200 CZK. Email me the details at bence@underyx.me - my whole life is linked to and from the https://underyx.me domain, so that should be enough to give you peace of mind that I won't just run off with the money.

And by the way, the title makes it sound like you're asking for 200 CZK :D

Edit: Oh, and if you could pay me in bitcoin, it'd be way more convenient for me, but don't worry about it too much.
Now who in their right mind would do that?
Your comment is relevant for companies that have trouble taking off. I doubt OP's article included non-established companies in the data.
Founders probably also make better CEOs than CEOs brought in to fix a company.
Also, CEOs of successful companies tend to not take too much money out of their company in the form of salary. Stock options and other alternative forms of compensation can amount to a way higher income, and having a reasonable, low salary can help with popularity. Some CEOs actually made a sort of a publicity stunt out of having an annual salary in the $1-$10 range (not a typo). I would assume this is also helps lower taxes a bit.
[Coala](https://github.com/coala-analyzer/coala) has a very active and welcoming developer community. The project is really easy to work with due to it having very good test coverage - you don't need to worry about breaking anything, because you can just run the tests yourself and have the computer check if everything is still working correctly. Also, the team members are very strict about coding style and standards, which is a good thing, since thorough code reviews are one of the best ways to learn.

And if that wasn't enough, they're specifically keeping a list of tasks that they are saving for newcomers, which should make it really easy to get into contributing.
Oh no, at this rate you might end up having to pay if you want the full game!
I was about to invest on Wefunder, but decided to first search Reddit for any discussion about the company. I ended up finding your two comments. The fact that you registered new accounts only to chime in in Legion M threads with obviously fake comments makes me wonder if the company really has an idea about how to work with a community.

Needless to say, I decided against investing.
Or perhaps they were inspired by Stan's jacket in Monkey Island.

Do you have any reason to believe Grindr does not actually delete deleted user accounts? The fact that some (or even if you believe most) services don't does not prove anything.
What's the point of this comment? I'm genuinely curious.
No.
Actually, he's a rather accomplished software engineer and I'm sure his day job and place in the community nets him more than enough attention for him to be desparate for more.
Exactly, they're trying to keep this group open only for people who are actively buying removed games, which makes perfect sense.
That's absolutely your fault.
> So difficult to meet the requirements for that group (85 removed games)...

Well, are you actually collecting removed games? I have 22 apparently and I didn't even know any of them were removed. It would make sense for a collectors' group to only accept people who... collect.

Damn right! He also had two regular talks — at one of them he was presenting his work on a certain thing [(pretty technical description here)](https://lwn.net/Articles/689548/) that basically no one dared to even try to do since the last substantial (and failed) attempt around 10-15 years ago. It ended up becoming one of the... eh, _the_ main talking point amongst the audience for the rest of the conference, and I think (keynotes excluded) that was the talk with the highest attendance. He gathered quite a following afterwards as well, with a bunch of developers joining him to work on this thing.
>Why didn't they take the time left to decide winners

Cause that would heavily incentivize players to favor rush strats in the main rounds, and Blizzard doesn't want the meta to be like that.
…what? How would you even get to that conclusion?
>level of discourse

Funny, now that you mention this, almost all retorts against OP contained the cheap joke of repeating something from OP's comment. Like the '(gasp!)' and the 'Haha XD' thing.
Why the hell would you get upvoted, and why is the reply from OP downvoted? You're just bullying OP for no reason whatsoever. Have you never had an urge to correct people who are incorrect about something you like? Even if not, can you really not imagine that there is a person on Earth who is willing to spend their time doing just that?

Why does everyone have to be so hostile in this thread?
Man, I'm really sorry about these jerks, I totally understand what you're doing and am dumbfounded at how they cannot fathom it. As if none of them ever got into an Android vs. iOS type discussion.
Alright, close enough I guess.

I've recently moved to Cincinnati, and everyone keeps expressing their astonishment at the Czech 'comming' story. I've never had this reaction anywhere else before.
Huh, if you don't mind me asking: are you from Cincinnati?
Alright, close enough I guess.

I've recently moved to the Czech Republic, and everyone keeps misspelling the word 'coming' as 'comming'. I've never seen this mistake anywhere else before.

The fact that they modify the OS means that it's not what Canonical originally called Ubuntu anymore. It would be akin to a restaurant adding their own flavoring to the coke they sell (say, to make it mesh better with their cuisine) while still calling it Coca Cola on the menu.
And that's exactly what we're talking about.
Darn. I don't like these mods.

>they kinda sucked

I dunno, I found it [pretty entertaining](https://i.imgur.com/wwFFiFk.jpg),
Wasn't that already possible for a year or maybe even multiple years with Pushbullet, with the added bonus of supporting Windows and Android devices as well?
I was looking at the different exchanges, and different currency pairs, and it seemed like there's quite an arbitrage potential when huge transactions happen on one and the others take sometimes even minutes to keep up. I was thinking it might be easy to make money by just writing some software that aggregates exchange data, figures out the true value of each currency, and trades automatically trying to exploit these differences.

Now, tell me: why won't this work?
But... the market cap means two totally separate things for a currency and for a company.

A slightly more meaningful comparison would be the transaction volume of WU and BTC. According to blockchain.info this has been around **$170M/day for BTC** for the past 30 days, while Western Union has had $81.6 billion in consumer-to-consumer transfers[0], which made up 79.21% of their revenue[1], so I guess we can estimate an annual turnover of $103 billion, which comes out to **$282M/day for WU** over the year of 2015. And this isn't a very fair comparison either, since all of WU's transactions are actual transfers, while probably lots of Bitcoin transactions are just currency exchange.

Wait, I thought we were talking about both text and voice comms here. Does HotS have chat then?
Are there bans and punishments for comms abuse in StarCraft II, Diablo III, and Overwatch?
Actually, the pattern with Blizzard seems to be that free to play games have communication limited. They have probably found (or just thought) that free users are either more likely to be abusive, or are more sensitive.

Maybe they are afraid that communication would decrease user retention, which is probably one of their most important metrics, since that's how they can make money off of microtransactions. It totally makes sense too, when vou think of it this way, I can imagine people abandoning a game after a really bad experience with abuse, but I can't really imagine someone deciding not to play again just because they can't write whatever they want in chat.
Aw yeah, thanks for reminding me of Fuel! That's an awesome game.
It does indeed! I just checked a video and I love

 - How good the copilot is
 - That it's nearly impossible to win your first races
 - How wary you need to be of crashing — just spent a while playing GRID 2 and the stuff I can get away with is ridiculous.
 - The repair game mechanic between stages seems lovely
 - That the stages are relatively long
 - That the AI seems to participate in the same reparation metagame as the player, I just saw 'Clutch slipping' as a note next to an AI in the scoreboard.
 - That there's a whole team management aspect too, where you hire & train staff
Alright I guess. I normally try to stay away from making such claims if I have no access to any data.
Reposting this from last week, since I got to the party a bit late:

This probably won't exist, but I'm looking for a racing simulator on the PC with an emphasis on career mode and role playing aspects, preferably with good graphics.

I have no idea why, but the one time I have vague memories of playing one of the Gran Turismo games at a friend's house and being required to get licenses with driving challenges, and having brand choices (even of specific car parts) affect more than just the performance or look of the car, but I'm not so sure about this part. I seem to also recall some really old racing game called N.I.C.E. that I can't even find with Google now, but I also have vague memories of even the clothing you choose somehow being important to your career. Alright, now that I've written this down, it sounds a bit stupid, and my memory might be playing tricks on me, but still.

I also really enjoyed the Need for Speed series from Underground 1 until Carbon, for similar reasons (though being a bit older my preference has shifted away from arcade racing a bit I guess).

Oh, I think I've got what my main issue (and main request) is:

I just want as much of the game to be not racing as possible.

So, anybody got anything like that?
Most likely they've found or are thinking that people who disable adblock after seeing the dialog bring in more revenue than the people who just leave would have had they not been locked out. Did you have any alternative explanations in mind? I don't really understand your confusion.

Phew, that's a relief. I've sent it in already so I guess I'm in the clear. Thanks!
I think Burnout Paradise for instance was pretty novel all around. I don't see any reason why a racing game couldn't be done now which is a bit 'different' in a similar way :(
What's up with PC racing games? The whole genre feels really barren.
Why would you post this here instead of just googling it? PayPal charges 3%, Transferwise charges 1% in fees. I can vouch for transferwise, it's really fast and I've saved ~~like 200 USD~~ 403 USD vs banks in fees with them already.

Now you need to pay me back for taking the time to google this for you by using [my referral link](https://transferwise.com/a/188f3f) 😡

Edit: Oh, also, Paypal has crappy currency exchange rates.
Are they the ones with the old google logo on the bottom?
Oh, I think I've got what my main issue (and main request) is:

I just want as much of the game to be not racing as possible.
I actually own it but there's something I can't quite put my finger on that makes the career feel really bland. It might be just that it feels exactly like the DIRT games; all these games sharing the same system for progressing, the same sorts of characters, and tons of other stuff as well might be breaking the illusion of role playing as a driver.

Still, nice suggestion, GRID 2 might be the closest there is to what I've described.
Oh. It says so right in the first sentence of the article. I didn't even click the link before asking this question. Shame on me, sorry! :(

Hey there,

I'm one of the engineers working at Skypicker; just thought I'd mention that I really don't think there's a reason to include us in the 'scummy/scammy third party booking sites' category :)

We don't sell any of those shady hidden city combinations (the ones that go against airline rules, as you described.) Our specialty instead is combining flights of airlines that aren't allied with each other, and are therefore officially 'unsupported' combinations. Now, if you were to book these directly on the airlines' websites, you'd be risking losing the ticket of your second/third flight segments and getting stranded at your transfer airport if you miss the connection because your first flight is delayed. When you book through us instead, we have a sort of an insurance to protect against this; you can just call us from the airport and we'll do everything we can to get you to your destination as soon as possible (for no extra cost, of course).

Oh, and not having to go through booking 3-6 flights yourself on broken airline websites that try to trick you into paying for extra stuff you don't need can be pretty useful as well :D
Just my experience with buying stuff from outside the EU in mainland Europe. Not 100% sure that this is the case, so I'd suggest you just look into it.

Well, the main goal of the program is to conduct a long term study that will hopefully yield some data about the effect of basic income, being the first study to do so to such an extent. Thereby it will inevitably affect decisions of policymakers around the world, shaping the future of humanity.

Hey, Skypicker engineer here.

Just would like to point out that avoiding us would mean missing out on our [guarantee](https://us.skypicker.com/content/guarantee), so if your trip is made up of connecting Ryanair flights, and the first one is delayed causing you to miss your connection, you couldn't hold Ryanair accountable at all and you'd be left stranded at the airport. When booking through Skypicker you can just give us a call and we'll do everything we can to get you to your destination with no extra cost for you.

And about the extras; I'm confident that our CS team can handle requests for extra baggage without any problems :)
Are you serious?

>The increase in economic activity attributable to the 1984 Games, as represented by job growth, an estimated 5,043 full-time and part-time jobs using our model, appears to have been entirely transitory, however. There is no economic residue that can be identified once the Games left town.

&nbsp;

>the best-case scenario for the Atlanta Games of 1996 is consistent with what we could reasonably expect to find for public investments in general [...] Atlanta spent approximately $63,000 to create a permanent full- or part-time job. To create a permanent full-time job equivalent, past public works programs have spent approximately the same amount of money

&nbsp;

>It is estimated that the overall impact [of the London 2012 Olympics] on the price of properties in host boroughs amounts to £1.4 billion

&nbsp;

>We show that hosting a mega-event increases exports. This effect is statistically robust, permanent and large; trade is over 20% higher for host countries.

&nbsp;

>we find strong evidence [the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics] increased leisure related industries in the short run and potentially in the long run. However, the results indicate it had no long term impact on trade or total employment.

&nbsp;

>Using a small aggregate macroeconometric model we find evidence to support the view that the Olympics is an event that could successfully boost the economy of the host city by generating benefits that outweigh the preparation cost [...] the impact effects are quite strong during the preparation phase and the year the Games took place, the long-term economic legacy effects appear to be quite modest.

&nbsp;

>there were economic benefits and a more subtle impact on South Korean society, national pride, collective memory and sporting culture

&nbsp;

>[2000 Sydney] Olympics expenditure not funded by Games revenues is modelled as being met by an increase in New South Wales state tax revenues (via a larger revenue base and slightly higher tax rates than would otherwise be the case) and a substantial diversion of government expenditure from non-Olympic to Olympic items. Simulation results indicate that NSW activity is 0.3% higher over the 12-year period due to the Games, but there is little effect on the other states.

None of these suggest that there ever was a negative impact on the economy. We also established that based on the data I linked in my comment, the more developed a country is the lesser the effect is, which is definitely corroborated by these studies.
If you read the document I linked, it says that actually developing countries were routinely seeing a higher net positive effect than developed ones. Hungary is kind of on the edge of developed status so I'm assuming it'd be somewhere between the no economic effect observed in developed countries and the positive economic effect for developing ones, i.e. a slight increase in economic activity. (And of course the economy is only part of the big picture here, let's stop kidding ourselves.)

By the way, I actually started looking into this because I wanted to find some research that disproves this comment:

>the enormous boost it would be you mean? lol

But I couldn't find anything that would do so. Can you link me to one of these 'infinity amount of reports'?
Huh? I'm assuming you didn't read what I linked? It's a retrospective report on the economical effect of Olympic Games between 1964-2004, not just some random forecast on 2024.

The data there actually shows the exact opposite of what you're stating.
I did some digging and according to [this report](http://nccur.lib.nccu.edu.tw/bitstream/140.119/37406/8/803008.pdf) it might actually have a very positive effect on the economy.
This comment of yours really is worded in quite an infuriating way.

Furthermore, I think it's wrong of you to assume that "But there's tags!" would be read as a joke by everyone, I didn't realize that either.
Alright, fair enough.

I'd assume the justification for using this example is that it would be difficult to showcase all the different types of file system modifications it can detect with just one command.
That's like saying that the problem with `rm` is that people are going to delete the wrong files with it accidentally.
Oooh, I think I have the perfect thing for you: [maybe](https://github.com/p-e-w/maybe)!

So for all we know they could've cherry picked the news sites that have the worst ad to content ratio. I mean, I get it, we don't like ads, but come on guys, raise your standards a bit.
Ah yes, 3.6 of 8.1 is ads and 1.0 of 3.8 is also ads, that's helpful, thanks.
I'm still not happy about them talking about themselves in third person and acting as if all this stuff was posted by some random guy.
Also, ads on news sites gobble up as little as 18% of users' mobile data. Way to give the article a useless title.

And if anybody figures out what the X axis of that chart is supposed to represent, please let me know.
Wow, never knew these guys worked on a game as well, this got me really interested. Been listening to them sometimes ever since Endless Fantasy was featured in an episode of NPR's All Songs Considered.

Edit: This stunt is kinda lame though, what with the band shilling to spread it on 4chan and everything.
I think it's more about when she started to get aggressive with the bets.

This appears to be really similar to the [Facebook at Work color scheme](https://i.imgur.com/ziHMkeq.png). I'd say there's a higher possibility that the alpha build is just using this other scheme accidentally than that Facebook is rebranding.
But then I wouldn't have scored a goal.
Okay!
They are not removing support for custom launchers.
So replace the verb develop with design in my comment and my argument still stands.
~~There's a different team working on both products~~, and the products happen to be entirely different in structure. Feature parity would require the same thing to be developed twice, instead of just being a matter of copy-pasting code.
That's almost entirely because of the software. Spotify's code and stack will not change by moving them to different servers, so you shouldn't really expect any speedup caused by that.
Right, but why would Google's infrastructure be faster than Spotify's current datacenters?
Why would it perform better?

Their servers only ever see encrypted data. They can't read any of it without your decryption key. What are you worried about?
Nope :(
Sorry man, not really interested in any of those. Thanks anyway!
That's alright.
Sorry, no deal then. Look like I could just sell RUST at 7 EUR and outright buy those two :(
I'm pretty interested in Pony Island + HuniePop. I can give you RUST + one of the below:

- AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome
- Dustforce DX
- Osmos
- Super Hexagon
- Zenbound 2
- Greed Corp
- The Showdown Effect
- McPixel
- Thomas Was Alone
- Magicka + 2 DLC
- F.E.A.R.
- Gratuitous Space Battles
- Nightsky
- Awesomenauts

We could also do Pony Island + HuniePop + Necrodancer for RUST + three from the list.
Sorry, I don't fancy any of these that much :(

What if I just set the recommended comment sorting to 'new'?
>If it was true you don't want to embarrass them

1. I never said I didn't want to. (I didn't, granted, but why are you attacking a point I never made?)
2. I don't think people really get embarrassed over an anonymous comment on reddit, contrary to the 'turning in a paper' scenario I mentioned above.

>why don't you send a PM instead of broadcasting your correction to the entire thread

1. As in my above comment: 'Seems like a few other people learned something from this thread as well.'
2. It would also have taken more effort.

>Maybe it's because you are insecure in other ways and correct others publicly to feel a sliver of mental dominance.

When did my personality become relevant to a discussion of whether there was any value in me pointing out the error?
>Everyone understood that.

Oh, I wasn't entirely sure of it. I thought there was a possibility that there's a release time or something similar and he's planning to be ready 20 minutes before that with his node.

Also, [this commenter](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/4442vk/bitcoin_classic_beta_2_released/cznd4ir) seems to have considered this possibility to be more likely. Hope that's enough for you to disprove that everyone understood it.
Oh, and I forgot to point out that you're still wrong here. T is supposed to be substituted with the time of the event in question. This is why 'T-1 minute' is 1 minute before liftoff in the case of a rocket launch. If liftoff is at 16:11:24, then T-00:01:00 reads as '16:11:24-00:01:00', so it's 16:10:24.

I find it pretty funny how you say 'Correcting people on symantics on the internet when the meaning is obvious is some next level Aspergers' while actually misunderstanding the meaning.
Well, I don't know, I myself prefer that people tell me when I'm wrong so I don't have to embarrass myself later with the same mistake. Seems like a few other people learned something from this thread as well.

I mean, you probably wouldn't want to turn in a paper writing 'symantics' instead of 'semantics' as you did above, either, right?
What, no.

>In the context of a rocket launch, the "T minus Time" is the time before launch, e.g. "T minus 3 minutes and 40 seconds". [...] After a launch, most countdown clocks begin to show Mission Elapsed Time, which is typically shown as "T plus."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countdown#Rocketry

And even if what you say was true, the comment would still be syntactically incorrect, which was what I pointed out. What is wrong with everyone here?
Good God, Lemon!
>My node will be operational 20 minutes before the node starts.

Ehhh…
Right, but in this case, what did the commenter refer to by T?
I guess, but what does T refer to then?
'In 20 minutes' also refers to a point in time, that's not what the issue was, see:

- 20 minutes: interval
- in 20 minutes: point in time

So far so good, everything is correct.

- T-20 minutes (20 minutes before T): point in time
- in T-20 minutes (in 20 minutes before T): ???
You mean 'in 20 minutes'.

T-20 minutes refers to a point in time, not an interval.

This would be impossible; the password is revealed. Though I can't think of any reason why that would matter.

There's a relevant article that I love, here, [have a look](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=40). Especially the opening quote:

>If you’ve never missed a flight, you’re spending too much time in airports.

It doesn't take too much effort to rewrite this to fit our scenario.

But even then, in our case, there's no real reason to outright go for the less risky option: if you miss that connecting flight that you had only two hours of layover for, we will just book you the next one for free as a replacement. You'll end up exactly the same as if you just booked that in the first place.
4 hours sounds a bit too cautious. In our experience 2 hours of layover time is already safe even if the first flight is delayed a bit.
Thank you for letting us know! We've fixed that, the change might take a few hours to appear for everyone though.
Hey there, I'm one of the developers at Skypicker, and, well, it's totally legit :D

The reason we have cheap flights like that is that other sites normally only find flight combinations that are supplied by the airlines (or parties close to them), and when the airlines are in charge of connecting flights, they only use the flights of airlines they are allied with. Since we check all possible combinations, including those that the airlines don't offer themselves, it isn't rare that we end up with cheaper flights. We often see 90% cheaper alternatives on quite a few routes.

The issue that all this poses is that by taking these 'unofficial' connection flights, if the first flight is delayed, you can't hold the airlines liable for you missing your connection. But for this very reason we have a thing called the Skypicker Guarantee — so in such a case you can just call us, we will find you an alternative, and we'll book it for you free of charge.
I'm not against it, just would like to mention that any time a site sets my status bar orange, I get nervous cause I think my battery is dying and battery saver just got turned on.
Yeah, seriously, I was offered any phone of my choice at my new job, but I just said I don't need a new one. Had the OPO for 16 months now.
Wow, that's pretty crappy.
The only variable that makes a difference here is the fault rate. I used 20% which is completely unheard of and way more than any reasonable person would guess. And even with this number, it's better to buy the cheaper phone. Come on.
What values would you use instead? Maybe you think that every fifth OnePlus device is defective? (Which would make it hundreds of thousands of defective ones.) Perhaps you think that having to talk to OnePlus support would just utterly destroy your life so much that your life would be in ruins for two months, resulting in a -1 value/month? Well, even with these ridiculous numbers, You get 11.32 value per year for $329 against 12 per year for $349, so 29.06 $/value/year against 29.08 $/value/year.

Since the results are such a landslide, I didn't think the exact numbers would even matter.
So instead of breaking the problem down into manageable pieces and guessing about those, you prefer making one large guess? Why would that be better?

Which parameters seem off? What values would you use instead?
Your first point, I refute. I'm not defending any company, I'm stating that given these circumstances the right decision is to buy the cheaper phone.

I am however willing to concede that my math is shitty, but you will first have to explain why.
And on the topic of calling this a 'weird mathematical argument':

If we just tweak the numbers a bit, we can have similar hypothetical offers:

 - A OnePlus Two equivalent with a $50 price tag and 10% fault rate.
 - A OnePlus Two equivalent with a $10 price tag and 20% fault rate.
 - A OnePlus Two equivalent with a $0.5 price tag and 80% fault rate.

You probably would say yes to buying at least one of these. Once we have that, start changing the numbers, gradually making them worse, and try to decide if you'd still get it. At some point you'd stop seeing it as a good offer. But the question is, at which point? This thread shows us that if we go with our gut feelings, we make terribly biased decisions.

It's way more lucrative to use economics and maths to find the answer to questions like this than to just take a wild guess. If you apply this sort of decision making to your life in general — let's say you buy 10 items a year based on such calculations — you will almost certainly be better off than with making guesses. 
That's why I went with a value of 0 in the end. Having touch screen issues for instance won't make my life worse than it would be without a phone.

But anyway, considering cumulative value would make more sense. Consider the following, with replacing the last arbitrary unit with an even more arbitrary 'value/month':

 - I start out at zero value/month, with no phone.
 - I get a OnePlus with touch screen issues, so my phone has 0.3 value/mo, and I need to subtract the time I have to spend with customer service. This will hardly amount to more than $200's worth of my time, so let's place it at around that, -0.5 value/mo.
 - Let's say this keeps up for two months until I finally get a replacement. This means that after two months I'm at -0.4 cumulatively
 - I'll use the normal replacement phone for the rest of the year, bringing me up to 9.6 value after 12 months.

So that's:
 - With OnePlus, 99% of the time 12.0 value per year, and 1% of the time 9.6 value per year for $329. This makes my expected value here 11.976.
 - With the other phone 12.0 value per year for $349.

11.976 value/year for $329 versus 12.0 value/year for $349. I didn't really change my opinion.
Which makes it sound like Neerja Bhanot is a flight.
Dude, if I write a comment detailing and explaining why I would take the risk, please don't reply to it with the question 'why would you take the risk?'
Then I'd like to rewrite my quote as

>So all you're saying is, you would rather approve a payment and wait an unknown amount of time until your phone is ready, than wait an unknown amount of time until your phone is ready and then buy it?

Preferring the invite system on the customers' side still sounds like a no-brainer to me. And even OnePlus should prefer this, since no commitment means that the customers feel less entitled and therefore will be less angry if OnePlus slips up with production and can't deliver for a long time. Not to mention that it would have been a lot harder to raise the price if deemed necessary.
Oh man, [this again](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/2xwxcd/oneplus_is_expanding_to_all_eu_countries/cp4afqv?context=2)?

>So all you're saying is, you would rather pay and wait an unknown amount of time until your phone is ready, than wait an unknown amount of time until your phone is ready and then buy it?
> Or you could buy a phone from a reputable seller like amazon and have no downtime if it's defective.

My entire comment was about comparing this choice to buying a OnePlus. I have no idea how you missed that, but either way, what I wrote up there still stands.

And also:

> an invite system that is only in place to drive interest

You can't prove that and logic points toward this statement being false.
What's the chance of getting a faulty device? My guess would be around 0.1%, but let's count with 1%.

In this case, let's assume you could buy a OnePlus Two for $329 or an equally good phone for $349, which has a 0% chance for being defective (ha-ha). Let's say both of these phones have a value of 1 (in Phone Value Units or whatever).

So then: if one thousand people buy the $349 phones, they will end up with 1000 value for $349,000, which is 349 $/value, and if one thousand buy the OnePlus Two, they will end up with 10 faulty devices, which have a value of zero (that actually isn't true but whatever), and for $329,000 they will have a total of 990 value, which is 332.33 $/value.

The rational decision would be to buy a OnePlus Two in this case.

Edit: [Post now up](https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidWear/comments/3sx9u5/android_wear_marshmallow_update_megathread/). Come on over!

While we are at it, can we just take this discussion to /r/ampart?
The example given in the survey was 'look what my wife just bought'. The rule will cover posts about people being 'so excited' that they post photos of just their new watch, and the equivalent. As written in the post above:

>we will start actively removing the following posts **once we've written up clear rules**

Naturally, it will be possible to start a discussion if you feel like the exact rules are too strict.
LastPass stores passwords after they are encrypted on your local machine, and you decrypt them locally when you retrieve one, so even when using LastPass, you don't have 'one password that some random company holds'.

        FROM
            message
        WHERE

Well, you're an amazing person.
Nice dataset! Here's one I ran to get each user's copypasta ratio (number of messages posted by them that were copypasta, defined here as messages that were posted at least 5 times, and are at least 12 characters long):

    SELECT
    	copypasta_counts.username,
    	round(((copypasta_counts.count::numeric / total_counts.count::numeric) * 100), 2) AS copypasta_ratio
    FROM
    	(
    		WITH copypasta AS (
    			SELECT msg
    			FROM message
    			WHERE length(msg) > 12
    			GROUP BY msg
    			HAVING count(msg) > 5
    		)
    		SELECT username, count(username)
    		FROM message, copypasta
    		WHERE message.msg = copypasta.msg
    		GROUP BY username
    	) AS copypasta_counts,
    	(
    		SELECT username, count(username)
    		FROM message
    		GROUP BY username
    	) AS total_counts
    WHERE
    	copypasta_counts.username = total_counts.username
    	AND total_counts.count > 100
    	AND copypasta_counts.username != 'moobot'
    ORDER BY
    	copypasta_ratio DESC


And the results, excluding people with less than 100 messages (the results wouldn't fit in a reddit comment otherwise):

Yup, we're aware! It's just that it didn't seem like there would be enough new content flying around each week to warrant regular stickied threads, but the manually submitted weekly discussion that was posted by a user last week changed my mind.
I really wasn't trying to say anything deep with this. I just replaced Soylent with Bitcoin in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/soylent/comments/3ow16y/their_reactions_boggle_me/cw12usc) and thought it was funny, plus I was curious what responses it would get.
It must be because of all the soylent. You should've ordered a pizza every once in a while.
Why the 'food with money' part? This seems way better:

>I don't eat Bitcoin so that other people will approve of my diet. I eat Bitcoin because I want to be healthier and I think that Bitcoin is a good tool to help me accomplish that.
That, on the contrary...
That seems pretty decisive, thanks!
I never saw any source that would confirm that OPPO is the parent company of OnePlus. Do you have happen to have any?
Aww, I pre-ordered a while ago, and am using a Mac, but my controller is nowhere to be found, not even shipped yet. Pretty sad to see that I could've been this lucky here :(
We had this in Hungary for last year's elections: http://www.voks14.hu/

The in-app results were off from the real ones by a lot: for the largest two parties they had [41.6% and 23.8%](https://www.facebook.com/voks14/photos/pb.467501020025812.-2207520000.1444485044./555786264530620/?type=3&theater) on record, while the actual results were [25.99% and 44.54%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_parliamentary_election,_2014#/Results) (yes, the other way around.)

To this day [they are posting some pretty cool stats](https://www.facebook.com/voks14/photos_stream) though, they have a new poll each day about a variety of topics, and they post the correlations they find between the answers and demographic data/political preference of users.
Fun fact: PNR is actually short for Passenger Name Record and therefore refers to the thing where all the data the airfolks have on file about you is kept. The 6 character code is technically a 'PNR locator'.
[You can actually do that in $200 even with buying just 20 days in advance](https://us.skypicker.com/cheap-flights-from-chicago-united-states-to-missoula-united-states/departure-27-10-2015-27-10-2015/return-2-10), it's just that most search engines don't combine low cost carriers' flights like the Spirit-Frontier connection here.
It's like a PSA that only tells plumbers that there's a new standard for pipes that have a better flow rate.

The people would want plumbers to know, granted, since they want a higher flow rate and therefore want them to know how to work with the new standard, but the announcement itself cannot be acted upon by 99.99% of the viewers, which makes it a waste of time for them, and all the plumbers knew already anyway.
That's just ridiculous.
That's what PSA means, indeed.

But why would this have 'public service announcement' in the title?
Why is this a PSA?
Being nowhere near launch probably helped, too.

That's a totally objective (and correct) observation, not sure why you took it as a personal attack.

> a YouTube video on how to open a can with a spoon

WHERE IS IT? Girlfriend and I moved out, got 4 cans to open, and no can opener.\

Edit: By the way, don't bother answering, a search for 'how to open a can with a spoon' had it as result #1, just wanted to put this out there.

Edit 2: It worked! Was not even that difficult.
How would that even work? 'Okay, radio, insert tape'?
Thank you!
I just wrote a note on a post-it, turned on my radio and played a tape without an Internet connection. All of it worked. What exactly is the issue?
Here's a Stack Exchange UX answer about this: http://ux.stackexchange.com/a/50266
Hey, I paid for a year accidentally!

...it's totally fine though, I love you guys <3
Oh right, I guess I didn't even read that far. Edited to add a highlight on that too.
And yet the first line gives it away:

>Glyph cooldown is shortened **by by** 2.5 min whenever you **loose** a Tier 2 Tower
Why so cold, man? :/
Why would they? Also, wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that an average citizen has only one or maybe two crimes they could be charged with? I mean seriously, this gun charge was the best they had in this case.
I'm sure there's a finite number of things any one person can be charged with.
A more fitting analogy would be locking your front door and then using some magic power that only you have to shatter reality and scramble that fraction of space so that anyone entering your house's area will be unable to comprehend or interact with anything inside.
Right, so could that have been used in court in the FBI trial, or prevent the entire trial from happening based on the [Double Jeopardy Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Jeopardy_Clause)?

Cause if so, this might save people in similar situations — hiring a lawyer/private investigator to dig up anything they might be prosecuted for, and getting a (much more forgiving) verdict before the FBI starts to feel the need to have them arrested.
Right, but here's what my question was:

>What would likely have happened if he turned himself in for illegal gun possession right after he discovered the FBI agents?
I think you replied to the wrong comment?
Just wondering: what would likely have happened if he turned himself in for illegal gun possession right after he discovered the FBI agents?
This subreddit went way downhill since the good old days.

The only non-issue you have here is the interference with other sensors. (Decay is like 1% per decade, so we'd be left with 29.7 N of force instead of 30 N after ten years. Oh dear.)

>Nobody can argue anything about the new design so why even mention it?

That's exactly the reason I mentioned it. You come in here blurting on about your moronic bumper frame idea like it's an obvious answer and you effectively call the Ara engineers idiots for thinking any further about the problem than your clearly broken and limiting solution ("Jesus guys, just use a locking clear back cover design").

Dude, no. They had a better way to solve this than yours for the past three years. They came up with something even better now. Just shut up with that bumper already, alright?
But I couldn't find a single reason he said about why the bumper would be preferable to magnets, and I couldn't find one about why it would be better than the new design, either, since that hasn't even been announced yet.
How about side buttons or sensors? Just the first thing that popped into my mind, there probably are tons of issues that neither of us considered.

The magnets they had were already an upgrade from a bumper based solution, and what they just now announced is that they have something that's even better than those magnets. I don't even know what you're arguing against at this point.
Great! Now, please read the rest of my comment.
Please realize that some of the world's best engineers are working on this. I find it aggravating that you feel like you can dismiss the hundredth iteration design that these people have come up with as their best solution yet, after having spent tens of thousands of hours thinking about this problem cumulatively, while, as I'm guessing, you just read a few articles about Ara.

Anyway, have you never had a cover fall off when dropping your phone? How are audio sensors going to work if you cover them? How about practically any other kind of sensor other than a camera? How would this affect heat dissipation? Can you not think of any modules that would need to actually touch something else to use?

And worst of all, why are people agreeing with you?

It certainly does! I think it's safe to say that that is around 500 times more than we could've made if you turned adblock off. Thanks a lot! :D
All that sounds good, but I don't see an easy way of actually storing over a TB of replays with them.

Google's Nearline however would be perfect for us, but then there's a problem of the team lacking any motivation to migrate over.
Did we? That's just the TI4 surge in traffic dropping off. We've only grown since then.
Welp.

That's weird, there's supposed to be [two ad units right on the homepage](http://i.imgur.com/nzCFuMu.png). You probably are inadverently blocking them with some privacy guard/script blocking extension? I don't know. Not that it matters that much, anyway :D
We have ads but you're blocking them :(

Edit: To provide some extra information, when we started asking for donations almost a year ago, [we published data about our income and expenses here](http://dotabank.com/donate/). As you can see there we make around 10 bucks a month from ads while it costs 150 USD to run the site. Not much has changed since then, and we've received four donations for a total of 44 USD over these 10 months.

You know all batteries are replaceable, right? It does not really make sense to plan your obsolence by omitting a battery replacement mechanism, when anyone can just walk into a store and have their battery replaced for thirty bucks or something anyway.
Okay, let's walk through it then, step by step. What are the incentives driving a company when designing a new phone? Here's all of them:

* We want to sell as many as possible so we can make a large profit

So then, how do you make a phone that lots of people will buy? The answer is not ask /r/android, but instead to go with what people actually want, which is a nice, thin phone.

Hope that helped you understand.
They also make the chassis design way more complicated, and as a result, the phone more bulky.

No, it depends on how much you are willing to cooperate with the community by using the same name that everyone does.
OP made no mention of Hex.
There's so much wrong with this comment, I don't even know where to begin.

1. I know people from the USA who are well versed in European affairs.
2. Most Europeans don't know a lot about other European countries' governments.
3. Lots of Europeans don't know who the president of the USA is.
4. It would make sense for people all over the world to know about the POTUS as he's leading the #1 economy of our planet, contrary to the leadership of any European country.

Most of this is just anecdotal evidence against your anecdotal evidence, but that even that should be enough to demonstrate how silly your reply was.
So did everyone forget TI4 being the cover story of the New York Times?
Do you actually have any evidence that this is more prevalent in the USA than any other country? Each nation obviously discusses news more if they are involved. Just imagine the Huffleville, WA local news station reporting on Phorson, FL's interstate baseball victory in the other corner of the country over their own.
Media is already the plural form of medium if I recall correctly, no need to tack on an s at the end.

She started with tons of bot games. This was after she played a whole bunch of those.

She did play alone. New account, queued solo.
Actually, she played lots of bot matches before this one.

>If you're going to be learning skills, getting used to movespeed, reading items, why play against people?

She wasn't doing any of those. She had a pretty good grasp on the basics as she played lots of bot games before this one.
I was not in that game, and she queued solo.
She was using her own account, obviously.
Hell, I don't even know how to deal with brood myself.
The dialog actually didn't show for her.
What's even more scary is that she won the game. The game might now think she actually belongs in high skill.
What do you think I meant by '20 hours preparing'?

My girlfriend spent over 20 hours preparing and was really excited about her first game, but she was placed into [this high skill game](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1645835449) for her first match, got killed 21 times, got flamed a lot, and decided never to play Dota again.

**Edit**: For the record, I'm mentioning this as an example as how bad it can be even if you are really committed.

**Edit 2**: I'm seeing two things mentioned in replies so much that I will just answer them right here.

>Why would you give her Luna and not a support?

While it may seem obvious to all of you saying this that a new player in a high skill game should pick safer heroes, you are neglecting to consider that we totally did not expect the game to be high skill. Luna's one of the heroes who has guided hero bot matches in Reborn, and my girlfriend did pretty well with her, and I felt like the high move speed was good enough for escaping in <1k MMR. And most importantly, for all we knew in the hero pick stage, my girlfriend was the best player out of all 10, since we expected everyone to be having one of their first matches, and she had the advantage of having read and watched tons of guides, and also having played lots of bot games.

>Why didn't she play bot matches instead?

She did play a lot of those, just not co-op ones. I didn't think a co-op match would have been very useful at that point, as again, 'for all we knew in the hero pick stage, my girlfriend was the best player out of all 10'.
I got one for fifty.

I've been bugging Cyborgmatt for months to change it, making this modification myself to demonstrate my point, and even helped him a little on IRC to change it, so this has kind of been my cause to fight for in the past two months.

I did it because… I don't know. I guess the small differences are more easily identifiable and analyzable. But it does make the big picture less apparent, such as the difference between the peaks along the X axis. Actually /u/Cyborgmatt can you change it back? :l

With no knowledge of how exactly this works, I think allowing sites to vibrate the phone is entirely reasonable, and I'm also pretty sure that Chrome can't really differentiate if the request to vibrate came from the actual site, or an embedded ad.

I feel like the solution is the same as for sites with ads that have sound. Just don't use them.

Seriously, it looks like just a regular 13 MP photo blown up to twice the size. I can't believe so many people are falling for it.
Mine burned down after 3-4 months. Got credit for it at the store and bought an HD 5850 whose price went down to how much the HD 5770 was.
Sounds great! I backed Sportsfriends on Kickstarter actually, but never got Move controllers to be able to play JSJ. Really glad you made this game!

They just released the reborn client beta and are deploying 30 item long changesets to it every two days. Come on. 
>expenditure consists of taking workshop stuff and selling it 

You surely don't actually believe that.
Why was 'obtained' and 'their' not capitalized, then?
A visa is not a proper noun, you don't have to capitalize it.
This entire thread is about a person whose request was denied twice, for your information.
I'd prefer if the all-star match didn't have a monetary incentive for victory, I liked how the players didn't take the match that seriously in the previous years.

Of all the reasons there are to be mad at Steam's support, you just didn't hit any.

How did you get scammed out of items in the first place? Valve is making so much effort to make sure no one with half a brain gets scammed. Also, if someone scammed you out of $1K, would you be mad at the treasury for not printing you a thousand dollars to reimburse you?
> they are focusing on VR

Do we even know anything about how large a part of the company is working on VR?
A friend of mine wrote up some pretty lengthy criticism, [it might be useful](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/3aougk/esl_one_frankfurt_2015_feedback/).
Okay but counting you is cheating, you laughed for an hour at a simple neigh.

Right, except when C9 were 40 minutes late to their premium area signing session, and even then they didn't have EE and N0tail there.
Actually that's the sole reason I posted this photo. It's /u/dyslexicat's head on /u/RJacksonM1's body, stitched together by the panorama photo algorithm. We cumulatively spent at least an hour laughing at that.

>I don't know about that. The company is new and their cash flow is limited, so the chance of that happening is almost 0%.

You really couldn't take that extra second to type out your comment like this?
What's wrong with it? It was initially random, but due to users thinking it wasn't with all their cognitive biases, they had to implement a specific (pretty smart) algorithm for it, [as described here](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/02/28/how-to-shuffle-songs/). I have no idea how it could possibly be made better than that.
Neat, thanks, man! This amount is actually enough for five beers here in Hungary, so you just made two whole nights of mine.

Magic, whee!
Fair enough, that doesn't sound that bad anymore. Actually, I guess my real issue with sentiment like yours, which I unfairly projected onto this conversation as well, is that people are getting mad at companies for making decisions they don't like. They are getting mad without even trying to find out the reasoning behind the decision, and that bothers me a great deal. And even when such decisions turn out to be bad, why is everyone ignoring the fact that no one can predict the future? If there's a $1M investment a company can make to launch a product that has a 90% chance to fail, but will bring a profit of $100M if it succeeds, they definitely are in the right to go for it, and I can't stand the sad reality that companies are hated on after such a project turns out to be a failure, and that people feel superior to them for having predicted the failure.

I know this isn't entirely applicable to you, so I apologize for basing my previous comment on this mindset.
Okay, with all due respect for RES, I think you're the one not thinking it out here. From what I've seen you write and do, I'm actually rather surprised that I see your name above this comment.

Do you honestly think that without having any access to Spotify's data, without any experience (supposedly) with leading a corporation in the music industry, without any information about what kind of people Spotify's user base consists of, without any knowledge of the specifics of the deals Spotify made with the manufacturers, based only on your own experiences… do you think that with all this on the table, you can just state as a fact, that Spotify made a bad decision here? Do you really believe that a company the size of Spotify just "doesn't think it out" when it comes to defining business decisions such as this one?
Stars off their rating? Sure. Users leaving? Yeah, they deserve that. But users getting emotional over this and yelling at them? What's up with that?
Hmm, indeed, I wouldn't know of this myself since I've never downloaded tracks. I'm assuming that so few people use downloading, let alone to a custom location, that Spotify didn't think the feature was worth the time investment? Both for the cost of initial development, and the time that the added complexity wastes later on.

Now that I think of it though, couldn't you just reinstall an older version of the client until your subscription expires? I'm sure there's another music service you could subscribe to instead that has this feature.
That kind of makes sense from a business perspective, though, doesn't it? Especially if we assume that from the tons of partners, at least a few insisted on including an exclusivity clause for the platform in their contract. I don't see how it's fair for someone to be mad at a business for wanting to make more money and/or uphold their old contracts. It's not really unethical to not work on a specific new feature.
Weird, I never had any problems with performance, and I like the design, too. What devices are people having performance issues on?
What's wrong with it?
What did you hate about it so much? I liked the update.
What did they do so wrong that you're this hostile towards them?
Nope!
Én úgy érzem, hogy azzal csak magunkat szórakoztatnánk. Az emberek 80%-ának szerintem el kéne magyarázni a kontextust.
Dude, no. Not this one. This one has horribly broken scrolling, it's near unusable with a touchpad. I imagine the experience is just as frustrating with a scroll wheel until you learn how to use it.

However, I suggest that you look through the thingies listed here, check out their demos, and if you see one that you like, pray that it's easy enough to set up (some of them only need you to drop in a script tag in your HTML file): https://github.com/moklick/frontend-stuff
Wow, they just updated [the funding log](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Faqcki4Woh85wOQdl0P9rDKWaCvlG5r4woth0dkCMew/htmlview?usp=sharing&sle=true) and they're already at 1&nbsp;634&nbsp;027&nbsp;HUF!
Alright, I wrote the details down again. Really sorry about the vague, low quality post I had up there earlier.
So it turns our my post was missing 90% of the text body I wrote, so sorry about that! I've edited it now to re-add the details.
Huh? UberX is the main product of Uber.
Oh dear, I'm sorry, I posted this from a phone and it cut off 90% of my submission, with the details. I'll see if I can recover it from somewhere or I'll write it up again soon.
I don't think it matters? How are they different from an organizer's perspective?
Én igen, de bemásolom ezt az emailből amit a szervezőknek küldtem, mert érdekel a véleményetek:

>Viszont fontosnak érzem megemlíteni, hogy én sokkal szívesebben látnék a most a bejegyzésetekben lévő frappáns/kormányt támadó gyerekesebb plakátok helyett inkább olyat, ami minden irónia nélkül azt hangsúlyozza, hogy mennyire szégyelljük a kormányunk álláspontját és viselkedését a témában.

>Gondolok olyasmire, hogy "Hungarian citizens contributed millions just to tell you we're sorry" — nem vagyok a legjobb copywriter, úgyhogy nem is gondolom, hogy ez így tényleg egy jó szöveg volna, de szerintem legalább nagyjából szemlélteti, hogy milyen mondanivaló mögé tudnék én teljes mértékben beállni.
>Is there someone we can blame for this […] let them fear the gaming community for next year

Jesus, business doesn't work like that, don't be jerks to them for this. 'We weren't able to work something out' means that ESL didn't want to or couldn't pay them enough to get us free public transport. No one is at fault here and whining is not going to just magically create more wealth to support the extra transit usage.

Edit: /u/Fluffz86 had the following comments, each one deleted:

>Is there someone we can blame for this, e.g. facebook page with the guy you negotiated with? Also I would be interested how much money they wanted for 10k people using public transport? Isn't this something the stadium "owners" should be dealing with, since I guess it is pretty standard for football matches or concerts.

----

>since I am downvoted a lot, this was mostly aiming at the aspect whether it was not manageable at all (e.g. then we should raise awareness) or the organizers were just not willing to pay enough. calm your tits guys...

----

>that was what my second question was aiming at, one can easily calculate how much the 4 rides per person would cost and see how much discout the people at rmv were willing to give(if any, normally these companys do not deal with small amount of people individually, thats why I thought the stadium would have a default agreement).
With a international audience it should be something the organizers should be willing to give a few extra bucks just to make everything smoother and not let the people start the day with confusion how to get to the event and pay way too much by being unable to read the instructions on the maschines.
Comparing to the amount the VIP tickets cost, this is something I cannot agree with and if the fault is on the rmv side I guess putting a bit bad publicity on them would be the way to improve this for next year.

Oh well. I think I'm going to opt to use Uber for getting around, then.  Especially since they have a referral program, and for everyone who signs up [here](https://www.uber.com/invite/uberunderyx), I get a free trip of up to 10 EUR. Oh right, and whoever signs up with it also gets a free trip.

I dunno, you could even link your own referral codes to start a referral chain and give the entirety of reddit free car rides. But, like, whatever.
You can't start off a post with an excited title and then just make a nonchalant 'tho' remark in your post body.
To no avail, you mean.

Also, I'm pretty sure I had this on 5.0 as well. Or to be more precise, ever since I had Ambient Display.
>Video Game Tournament Raises Only $50 Million, Competitive Gaming Considered Dead
Bad redditor, go read the article.
Oh, thought you were posting these just to piss me off after how I overanalyzed the refresher one.

1. You don't eat tangoes, you use them to eat trees.
2. "I've not seen you until now" is not really enchanting.
:(
> I found your hair to be gorgeous.
Fine, actually I did get that, but I wanted to point out that while the intended meaning is clear, the comment makes no sense at all, which, for some reason, pisses me off a great deal — especially when not only does everyone glance over this fact, but he actually gets outright praised for being so witty.

You see

> Are you a refresher? Because I can ravage you twice in a row

can be modified to be written as

> I think you're a refresher, because I can ravage you twice in a row

while retaining the same meaning. This sentence is based on the following implication:

> If someone can be affected by Ravage twice, they are *(at least likely to be)* a Refresher Orb.

Now, in my plenty of hours of playing Dota 2 I have never seen a Refresher Orb affected by any skill other than Doom. Not only that, but I also have seen quite a lot of things being actually ravaged twice, none one which/whom were a Refresher Orb.
But… what? How does he ravage a refresher? Let alone *twice*?
My point still stands even if it's a hundred articles.
I don't see how that's relevant.
You can't just make such claims based on "I guess that's something she would do".
That sounds like a horrible idea. You can't just ban an entire domain for incompetence displayed in one of their articles. The idea behind reddit is that votes are the way to sift through content to get rid of the low quality ones.
You do realize you get more stuff at level 5 this year than with a level 25 one last year?
