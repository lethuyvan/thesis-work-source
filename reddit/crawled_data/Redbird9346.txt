Good news. I figured out what that thing you just incinerated did. It was the morality core they installed after I flooded the enrichment center with a deadly neurotoxin, to stop me from flooding the enrichment center with a deadly neurotoxin.

I’ll get everything else working while you complete this first simple test, which involves deadly lasers, and how test subjects react when locked in a room with deadly lasers.

Let’s see what the next test is. Oh, advanced aerial faith plates. Well, have fun soaring through the air without a care in the world. I have to go to the wing that was made entirely of glass, and pick up 15 acres of broken glass, by myself.

That jumpsuit you’re wearing looks stupid. That’s not me talking, it’s right here in your file.

Still, what does she know? Oh wait, it says she has a medical degree… In fashion… From France!

Well consider for a moment that no such transfer existed for 85 years. The Cortlandt Street station opened in 1917; the IND station opened in 1932. At the time the BMT and IND were competing companies. During that time we’ve had Hudson Terminal, WTC I and now WTC II, it wasn’t until recently that someone decided to do something about connecting the two stations, and what we have, which involved building around existing structures, is the result. 

Similar transfers exist between the G and L at Metropolitan/Lorimer, between the E/M and 6 at Lexington/51st, and between the 2/3/4/5 and S at Franklin Avenue/Botanic Garden. 
>	Except maybe 7th Avenue on the IND which needs some serious tile replacement.

I was going to ask which one you meant, but I realized both IND 7th Avenue stations – in Park Slope and on 53rd Street – could use some TLC. 
I boarded an R train at Woodhaven Boulevard this past Saturday. An announcement was made that the next stop would be Roosevelt. 

At Roosevelt, it was announced that the train would stop at Steinway Street and Queens Plaza, skipping the other stops in between. 

That was a sweet ride. 
That’s not train traffic, that’s just train route density. 
Or they’re going to a major stop that the train definitely won’t skip. 
Which delays the train even further. 
They outlasted the meme, didn’t they?

It’s an Agent18 case I bought from Amazon…

Eight years ago. 
Make sure iTunes knows to sync them to the iPod. 
Don’t forget France 🇫🇷 and the Netherlands 🇳🇱. 
Wait until they see the flags of Haiti and Lichtenstein. 
When: ghosting through that other racer, or doing that roll?
> We feel sorry for 459 players who only managed to deliver 9 cargos before the event's deadline.

Press F to pay respects.
I bought that song from iTunes ten years ago!
L and R sounds are quite similar. A clip I linked to (the one where he has issues talking to Siri) does demonstrate he has issues with both L and R sounds.
My first thought after reading the title. 
Interesting AF. 
I just had a thought. 

What would they have done if a song for which the license expired was on one of those stations where a set playlist in a specific order ran in a continuous loop (e.g. Electro-choc, Massive B, or East Los FM in GTA5)? 
They do seem to go a bit weird sometimes. 

For example, [this](https://youtu.be/r7PO31VQJ1s).
That's no lisp; it's [rhotacism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotacism_%28speech_impediment%29). Lisps primarily involve S and Z sounds. Barry's speech impediment involves R sounds, so it's rhotacism.
And only one of them has [rhotacism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotacism_%28speech_impediment%29), which has been used as a [source for jokes](https://youtu.be/WA5Zhir8rbc).
Yes, well, I'm polymerized tree sap, and you're an inorganic adhesive, so whatever verbal projectile you launch in my direction is reflected off of me, returns on its original trajectory, and adheres to you.
And stop signs at intersections with active traffic signals. 
And this is the reason I typically avoid Queensboro Plaza on weekends. I take a bus to either Hunters Point or 23rd/Court Square then take the 7 or E from there. Or, I take a bus that crosses the Queensboro Bridge. 
The “Astoria/Ditmas” side, (it’s actually *Ditmars*, with the added r), is actually upstairs. 
They run W trains on the weekend though. 
Sheesh. You would think that Central Park West would be a bit more classy. 
That decimal point is two places too far to the right. 

Actually, make that three decimal places. I just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to write a sentence which correctly uses “to,” “too,” and “two.”

Interesting. My high school had morning students and afternoon students. Morning students start at 7:10 or 7:55 or something like that, and would have a homeroom period between 2nd and 3rd. They would be done with their day around noon or 1 PM. 

Afternoon students would start their day around 11 and end near 3:45 or 4:30 PM. Their homeroom period is between 10th and 11th period. The school has 12 class periods throughout the day. 

That, and there were no lockers lining the hallways, only where you changed to/from gym class uniform, and you were only allowed in there for your designated gym period.

There’s the fish. 
I saw 0016 on the B24 on Monday. 
Missy certainly seems like a young Meemaw. 
As I was saying, vamlumtime’s day is seriously times. 
Amen. Two Sundays ago, I was waiting for a 7 train at Hunters Point. As the train was stopping, I start walking towards one of the cars. When the train doors opened, this *norteño* band rushes off the car I was heading toward, and started running to an adjacent car. I think to myself, “Perfect timing.”
When I saw that someone didn't deactivate the strip maps for that southbound run, I thought it was big news, but then I remembered that in 2015, I caught a 5 train that entered service at East 180th Street, but was signed as a 1 train for some reason, and the strip maps were active there as well.

For the curious…
[Look here for the 1 and others](http://b24blog.blogspot.com/2013/11/new-tech-train-strip-maps-stripped.html).
I agree. In fact, why stop at the penny? Why not eliminate all coins whose value is not a multiple of $0.1? The quarter would need to be replaced with a two-dime coin, but other than that, no major changes.

In fact, let's go even further and replace the $1 and $2 bills with coins as well. We already have a stockpile of $1 coins so all we'd need to do is phase out the bills.

Not only that, but when the original subway opened in 1904, Times Square was a local station (i.e., a downtown express train at 72nd Street would make its next stop at Grand Central).

Lol. Even Maggie doesn’t want Milhouse. 
The only word I recognized is *kudasai* (ください), as it’s a common word. 
It seems to be hit-or-miss for a lot of people. For me, matches are rare, and if I do get a match with someone and send a message, it’s like I’m writing said message on a piece of paper, sticking it in a bottle, then tossing it into the ocean. 

If I do manage to get a conversation going, it goes back and forth for a few rounds but eventually fizzles out. No bridge between *Start the conversation* and *actually meeting*. 

Then there are the annoying things about the people I see there. 

Top of the list are people who don’t make any effort into writing about themselves. I am, of course, talking about people who just write “ask me” in the *About Me* section.

Then there are the pictures with kids. Yours? Siblings’? Strangers’? 

Then there are the profiles I like to describe using car analogies. 

>	Dating profiles where all the pictures are headshots are like used car ads which show nothing but the steering wheel and dashboard. 

>	Dating profiles where all the pictures are of more than one person are like used car ads with pictures of the car in a parking lot among similar-looking cars. 

>	Dating profiles where all the person says is “ask me” are like used car ads where you’re shown the car, but not told anything about it. What about this car would make me want to contact you about it? How many miles does it have? Is the transmission automatic or manual? Does the engine even start? You don’t know because all you see is a few pictures and a message saying, “ask me.” 

Oh, and then there are the potato-quality pictures. I mean, come on! I’m looking at you with my Retina display so I hope your pictures look good on it.
I bought a copy of Portal 2 for my birthday.

By the time I got around to installing and playing it, it was near midnight, so I took a break.
The next day, I continued from where I had left off, playing through the point where GLaDOS says, "Yesterday was your birthday."

It was a jaw-dropping experience.
Unix time is the standard by which computers keep time. It's the number of seconds since 01 January 1970, 00:00:00 UTC. 

Older systems which use a signed 32-bit integer representation of this time value will overflow (i.e., exceed the maximum value which can be properly stored) at 03:14:08 UTC on Tuesday, 19 January 2038. The second before this would be represented as 0x7FFFFFFF or 2,147,483,647.  When the time clicks over to 0x80000000, the integer value becomes -2,147,483,648 (the most negative value that can be represented by a signed 32-bit integer), and the time therefore would be 2,147,483,648 seconds *before* the start of the UNIX epoch, or 20:45:52 UTC on Friday, 13 December 1901.
03:14:08 UTC on Tuesday, 19 January 2038, to be precise.

64-bit representations of UNIX time won't overflow for over 290 billion years, happening at 15:30:08 UTC on Sunday, 4 December 292,277,026,596.

Really? Because my computer is on Windows 10 and my A1059 works just fine with it. Heck, I even have an A1051 and a couple of A1040s that play well with Win10. 
Why would it?
Ah years, local number spoofing. I once tried to get my iPhone to block the 9,999 other numbers that share my area code and exchange, but that slowed the phone down considerably. 

I wrote a program that looped through the 10,000 phone numbers and added them to a number of vCard contacts, which were then uploaded to iCloud, synced with my iPhone, then added to the block list. 

Listing all those numbers on the phone was a pain. 
45th Street / 4th Avenue Station in Brooklyn. 

Train crews open the doors on both sides of the train prior to entering service as a check to make sure the train doors are working. 

Some R trains start at 36th Street, but those usually deadhead from Coney Island, so I’m guessing they delay or redo the door check here before entering service.

I suspect the digit 3 used in those is the flat-top variety, to avoid confusion with the Cyrillic character З (which transliterates to Latin character Z).

Though I’m not a fan of a sbemail being squeazeled into an April Fools’ Day thing. At least sbemail 206 (also released on April 1) is an official sbemail. TNAFT has not been recognized as sbemail 208, though it should be. 
“Screw all y’all.”
It’s more of a straight shot down to Coney Island. From Corona, reverse at Hunters Point, reverse at 39th Avenue, then follow either the Sea Beach or West End lines to CIY. 

To get to 207, you have to do the same set of moves but instead of going to CIY, reverse at Pacific then follow the D and A to 207. 
They do that for the 7 express. For example, at Grand Central, the 7 express is listed as “Weekdays, 3-9:35 pm.”

>	“5 to Flatbush Av 6am-9pm weekdays”

Assuming this is Borough Hall, as another post suggests, it would read “weekdays, 6 am - 8 pm. Some trains terminate at Utica Av.”

Though if 24-hour time were to become the standard, it could be shortened further to “weekdays, 6-20.”

The game actually keeps track of trailer damage in fractions of a percent, but only penalizes you if trailer damage is at least 1.0%. You could therefore get 0.9% damage on the trailer without penalty.

“…even if it were legal for me to do so.”
>Are motorists ***too*** selfish?

Yes.

If I were making the rules, I'd have buses take pictures of the offending vehicles occupying bus stops and bus lanes and then fine them per person aboard the bus. 

For example, if the fine for occupying a bus lane is $115. A typical 40-foot bus could carry anywhere between 60 to 75 passengers. So, take the number of people aboard the bus (including the driver), divide by 10, then round up to the next whole number. Multiply the $115 fine by that number, and you have the fine for occupying a bus lane when observed by a bus driver.
Think about it. When was the last time you heard of a young person driving the wrong way down a motorway? Never. It’s always an old person in their eighties. 

And how often do you hear about a teenager plowing their car into the sea? Again, never. It’s always an old lady in a Fiesta. 
Scania posted [a picture of one of their trucks in New Jersey (Liberty State Park), with the World Trade Center in the background](https://imgur.com/PQ3aDzl) to their [Instagram account](https://instagram.com/p/BLhCQ0KDA0A), so it's been done before.

Unlike ETS2/ATS where you drive around picking up trailers that are loaded and ready to go, a big part of any bus simulator is the transport of passengers and interactions with them. OMSI has fare transactions (collecting cash, issuing tickets, and making change). Fernbus has scanning and selling tickets. This functionality would need to be implemented.  Passenger NPCs would also need to be implemented realistically (e.g. animations of passengers boarding and alighting from buses, etc). I’ve heard they’ve done work in making a bus simulator closer to reality, including motion capture, but more needs to be done. I think this would be a combination of ETS2 and OMSI/Fernbus and less like Bus Driver, where passengers just phase into and out of buses. 
There are ferry routes IRL that go from base game territory to the Baltic territory, so I have no doubt that there will be ferry routes in game to bypass Going East territory for those who don’t have it. 

For example, Kiel, Germany to Klaipeda, Lithuania. I know Kiel doesn’t have a port in the game, but that doesn’t mean one won’t be added.

As far as settings and specs, my MacBook is running full screen at 1320 x 745 to my external monitor. V-sync is “Economic,” scaling is at 32%, everything is on Low except for texture quality (medium).

As for graphics, it’s got a GeForce 9400M with 256MB. 

My PC, as I mentioned earlier, has an R9 270X with 2 GB, and runs ETS2 at full 1080p, scaling at 200%, everything on high or ultra (except mirror distance), and that gets 60 FPS in most spots.

Listening to the Rays @ Yankees game right now and watching the scorecard being filled in. Cool.
D&C 107:85-89 specifies the size of each quorum:

Deacons: 12  
Teachers: 24  
Priests: 48  
Elders: 96

If a ward's priesthood body has an unusually high number of people holding a particular office, the quorum for that office can be split into as many quorums as needed.

"Double Play" or "Double Header" would be better names for that one, as those are terms actually used in baseball.
I bought most of the parts for my most recent build from my nearest MicroCenter. The parts included the case, the GPU, a couple of drives, and some other odds and ends. It filled a 15-inch laptop shoulder bag and a pull cart I brought with me. The trip home with all that stuff included:

* Taking a bus to a nearby subway station, which, thankfully had a system of elevators linking street to platforms,
* Crossing 10 lanes of traffic to get to said elevator from the bus stop,
* going down two elevators to reach the platform, which included passing through a turnstile which is barely wide enough to fit through,
* taking the express to the next stop, which has to be a major transfer point,
* taking three elevators, one of which stops at four levels and got insanely crowded, up to the necessary platform for my next train,
* taking the stairs at my destination station, since it doesn’t have elevators,
* walking 10 minutes home, and climbing up the stairs there. 

I probably wouldn’t be willing to complete the round trip with a fully-assembled build.

The letter suffix would need to go before the word *Avenue*.
I actually named the street in a city in *Cities: Skylines* using the several cities’ systems for inspiration. The city has a center boulevard, where the city’s first highway connection ended. West of Center Boulevard (or, in some places, Zero Street), there are numbered streets, up to 50 at the edge of town. East of Center Boulevard there are lettered avenues: Avenue A through Avenue Z. 

On the opposite axis, there’s no distinct dividing line, but it’s lettered streets to the north, fruits, trees, and berries to the south. Once the lettered streets are exhausted, we switch to the second alphabet using two-syllable names, then three-syllable names for the third alphabet, ending with Yolanda at the city line. South of A Street, there’s Apple Street, Banana Street, et cetera to Yam Street. West of 28th Street, there’s an overlap between the first and second southern alphabets: Tangerine becomes Amethyst, Vanilla becomes Barium, Yam gets near Calcium. The overlap ends past Zucchini Street (in-line with Diamond Street), with Emerald Street in position to run the length of the city. This second alphabet is minerals and elements. This gave me an opportunity to name this corner of town after many of the streets in Algonquin. At Amethyst Street, 31st becomes Galveston, 33rd Place becomes Frankfort, 36th becomes Exeter, 39th becomes Denver, Columbus is on line with 42nd, Bismarck with 44½, and Albany with 48th. Intersecting streets in this area follow the same order as the ones in Algonquin: Amethyst to Xenotime, with Ytterbium up against the city line. 

There are plenty of fill-in streets as well. In the lettered avenues, a lettered avenue can be followed by a name starting with that letter (e.g. Avenue D, Delaware Avenue, Dorchester Avenue, Avenue E, Eagle Avenue, etc.) there are also half- and quarter-numbered streets as well. 
It would be more helpful to consider the “side of the axis” bit as part of the building’s address instead of part of the street’s name. 
There are some neighborhoods that do that. For example, some avenues south of downtown Flushing have the sequence Ash, Beech, Cherry, Dahlia, Elder, Forty-fifth, Geranium, Holly, Juniper, Kalmia, Laburnum, Mulberry, Negundo, Oak, Poplar, Quince, Rose.

45th Avenue is the odd one out since it’s a number instead of a tree or flower, but it fits well between E and G as a stand-in for an F Avenue. 
At some point in the past, they considered renaming the roads crossing Cross Bay Boulevard in Broad Channel to numbered avenues from the high 190s to the low 200s.  
I see that in British Columbia near the border with Washington state. At the border, there’s Zero Avenue, then at some point there’s 0A Avenue, etc. 

That doesn’t really work in the US as numbered streets tend to be designated with *ordinal* instead of *cardinal* numbers. 

The street names here are 148th Avenue, 148th Road, 148th Drive, etc. You throw in a cardinal number with a letter suffix, you ruin the flow. 

The only place where cardinal numbers seem to have taken hold is where building addresses are assigned using some kind of Cartesian coordinate system, where a building having the address 2005 North 900 East would be just north of the theoretical intersection of streets called 2000 North and 900 East. An address of 890 East 2000 North would be located just west of that same intersection. Some cities might abbreviate those street names further to, say, “20th North” or “9th East.”

Paul F., aka Squirrel is a YouTuber/Twitch streamer with a regular weekly stream called *Sunday Night Trucking*, which, as the name implies, happens on Sunday night (UK time), and is dedicated to playing either ETS2 or ATS. The beginning of the stream starts with an abbreviated version of [this song (Spotify)](https://open.spotify.com/track/2vsznhmoIqpT92gHsnoW9r), which includes the lyrics, “He likes to drive a Scania, he thinks it is the best, / But he drives many others to put them to the test.” 

He has shown a dislike of Renault vehicles (the cars as well as the trucks) for quite some time now. If he does drive one for SNT, it usually gets wrecked (i.e. get 100% damage) at the end of the stream. [Here’s the most recent “Wreck the Renault” moment](https://youtu.be/zetaBfvG1dw?t=41m10s).

Beginning April 9, service to the Rockaways will be as follows:  
**A** to/from Far Rockaway ONLY; no rush hour service to/from Rockaway Park.  
**S** Far Rockaway to Rockaway Park.
Transfer between trains at Beach 67th Street.

from early July until Labor Day:  
**A** to/from Rockaway Park ONLY; no service to/from Far Rockaway.  
**S** Far Rockaway to Rockaway Park.
Transfer between trains at Beach 90th Street.

This is due to construction work to protect facilities at Hammels Wye from future storms.

I drive to the pickup point. If the trailer somehow doesn’t spawn, I escape to the main menu and then go back into the game, which usually regenerates traffic and respawns the trailer. 

I also used a no damage mod with these.

I manage to get up to 11 trailers before the loading of the job market freezes. Also, you can’t uncouple from a train of more than 10 without crashing the game on recouple or respawn. The trailers also seem to wiggle around a bit while stopped.

Same here. The original reason these bottle/can deposit systems were implemented is to encourage recycling. Now that the city has a decent recycling program where recyclable materials are put curbside weekly for collection, it's no longer needed, IMO. 

The only beneficiaries of the system are those who go around the neighborhood collecting bottles and cans on the night before recyclables are collected.
If this were in a public place, I'd be more willing to share its location based on that device ID, but it's in an apartment building in southern Brooklyn, so I'll leave the exercise to the reader.

Also, with those 16-segment displays, you'd have to judge from the context whether the floor has an S or a 5 in it, as both typically illuminate the three pairs of horizontal segments, and the top-left and bottom-right vertical segments. 

Though I have seen less ambiguous variations for both S and 5; they typically use one of the diagonal segments instead. 
That woutdn't as it's a Mac-formatted iPod. When plugged into iTunes on PC, iTunes will say:  
>iTunes has detected a Macintosh-formatted iPod. You must restore this iPod before you can use it on Windows.

What you'd need to do is install a virtual machine like VMWare or VirtualBox and install macOS on that. Then you can plug in your iPod, transfer your music to the VM (or your host PC), put them in an iTunes library on the PC, then restore and sync the iPod on the Windows PC.

Windows-formatted iPods can also sync with iTunes on Mac.

* The R46 is a 75-foot-long car. 75-footers aren't allowed on the BMT Eastern Division (today's J/Z and L lines, as well as the portion of the M line between Essex Street and Metropolitan Avenue). There was one [fantrip back in 1976 where a train of 46s went up to Fresh Pond Yard](http://www.erictb.info/r46freshpond.jpg), but generally they can't run in regular service due to the risk of trains sideswiping each other, as well as tight curves.

* The V train was discontinued in June of 2010.

* The M runs exclusively with R160 cars.

* This photo appears to have been taken at the 181st Street station of the A line.
Across the top from left to right:

iPod|Across the top|Headphone jack position
---|---
1G/2G|FireWire 400 (6-pin) port, headphone jack, hold switch|Center
3G/4G|Remote port, headphone jack, hold switch|Center
Mini|Hold switch, Remote port, headphone jack|Right
5G/6G/7G|Hold switch, headphone jack|Right

I have a couple of accessories that interface with the remote port, and as the name implies, it is used to remotely control iPod. One of the accessories also includes a microphone, so I could use iPod to record audio. 

Edit: the 3G, 4G, and Mini can use a remote which Apple sold, model number A1018. (I don’t know the model number of the similar model for iPod 1G/2G.)

Later iPods, i.e. Classic 5-7G and Nano 1-4G can use the Radio Remote, model number A1187. This model can also control iPod 4G and Mini, but iPod 3G doesn’t accept remote input from the dock connector so a Remote Port accessory is required for remote controls to function. The radio function is not available for these older iPods when an A1187 is connected. 

Nano 5-7G have built-in radio capability and they and the 7G Classic can be controlled with headphones with in-line 3-button remotes, like the EarPods. Model A1187 is not supported with these iPods.

I’ve ridden the express from 34th to West 4th on the R1-9 cars. Something about those old trains just adds to the thrill. 
Is it John, Paul, George, or Ringo?
That’s why I would set a minimum requirement (e.g. complete 50 WoT jobs with an Excellent rating; “No Damage” mods not allowed, etc.) to even be a juror.
The only thing that’s being “protected” by slowing train speeds is the [frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_switch#Frog_%28common_crossing%29). That’s the piece of steel installed where two individual rails cross each other. Slower speed means it’s hit with less force, but that’s the only thing affected by train speeds. 
The best one is the 60th Street tunnel. It’s ok if you’re on an R train, but even better if you’re on a train to or from Astoria. The trains flirt with 60 mph, but sometimes go faster than that. I’ve personally been on a train that reached 64 going toward Manhattan, but Queens-bound is usually the quicker of the two directions (again, only applicable to Astoria trains). 
Yeah, but those timers should only be active if the switch on the express track is lined up for the pocket track between 81st and 72nd. If the switches are lined up for the express track (i.e. straight through; only the local track curves to make room for the pocket track), there should be no reduction of speed. 
The timers outside Prospect Park have dulled the experience though. 
They recently upgraded the signals on the 7’s side of QBP, and now you get a similar feeling on Flushing-bound trains entering that station. 
There’s a similar little “kink” on the Flushing-bound 7 just before Vernon-Jackson. It’ll definitely catch you off-guard if you’re not prepared for it. 
But as it approaches Continental, the speed reaches its peak, only once the train is within about 100 feet of the platform do they begin to apply the brakes.
Mine is the 2 and 3 between Times Square and 72nd, followed closely by the E and F between Roosevelt and Continental. 
Part of the sync process involves modifying the on-board database which links each file to its metadata, which you then interact with while picking songs, etc.  

If you copy a file to an iPod without adding an entry for it in the database, it won’t appear with any music that appears in that database. iPod doesn’t scan for music files after each sync; that would be an expensive process, especially on larger-capacity iPods. iPod therefore just loads the database and goes from there.

All the easier to brute force.

The Java program below just writes a value to a String, but brute force password-cracking applications operate on a similar principle. It executes that `System.out.println(s);` instruction after about 15 seconds, but that's the ***maximum*** amount of time it would run.

    import java.text.DecimalFormat;
    public class PasswordGuesser{
       public static void main (String args[]){
       
	      // Since OP stated that the password is 8 "digits",
	      // we'll only consider the characters [0-9].
	   
	      DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat("00000000");
	      String s = null;
	      for (int index = 0; index < 100000000; index ++){
             s = df.format(index);
            }
          System.out.println(s);
       }

In fact, the only the IND used letters initially.

Letter|Northern trunk|Midtown trunk
---|---|---
A|Washington Heights|8th Avenue
B|Washington Heights|6th Avenue
C|Grand Concourse|8th Avenue
D|Grand Concourse|6th Avenue
E|Queens|8th Avenue
F|Queens|6th Avenue
G|&nbsp;|Brooklyn-Queens Crosstown
H|&nbsp;|Shuttles

Single letters were express trains, double letters were local trains. Since G and H were perpetually local, they were referred to as GG and HH. If this set of rules were applied today, what we know as the B, C, and M trains would be called the DD, AA, and FF. It would be weird since the DD, despite being a "local" train, would run *express* on 6th Avenue and the Brighton line. The main difference is that it runs local for a part of the route where the D runs express: along Central Park West and in The Bronx.
0 (digit zero) is used internally to refer to the 42nd Street Shuttle. H has a similar function for the Rockaway Park Shuttle.
The Z is the same concept, though skip-stop service on that line has been operating since BMT Standards were polishing the rails.

The stopping pattern for the 1/9 was as follows:

Station|1|9
----|--|--
242nd Street|1|9
238th Street|1|&nbsp;
225th Street|*|9
215th Street|1|&nbsp;
207th Street|*|9
Dyckman Street|1|&nbsp;
191st Street|1|9
181st Street|1|9
168th Street|1|9
157th Street|1|&nbsp;
145th Street|*|9
137th Street|1|9

\*: 1 trains stopped here when 9 train service was not operating.

Between 137th Street and South Ferry, 1 and 9 trains made all stops.

**H** is still used internally to refer to the Rockaway Park Shuttle. It last saw public use after Hurricane Sandy for the Far Rockaway-Beach 90th Street shuttle.

**K** was last used for a few years after getting rid of double-lettered lines in the mid-1980s. K replaced the AA, which ran from Washington Heights-168th Street to World Trade Center.

**T** used to refer to a BMT route that operated on the West End line in Brooklyn. It is currently reserved for use for the Second Avenue Subway.

Indeed. A lot of the cities outside of SCS territory are copy-and-paste. Cities are absurdly spaced out (i.e. only the big cities in a state are included), and some routes just don’t seem realistic. For instance, going from New Jersey to New York on Interstate 95. You DON’T meet up with Interstate 80, you DON’T pay a toll, and you DON’T cross the George Washington Bridge! After not crossing the GWB, you DON’T drive under the Apartments and then DON’T drive across the Alexander Hamilton Bridge to reach the Major Deegan Expressway (Interstate 87)! If this were SCS’s implementation of the region, you’d probably have all of that.

I think one of the issues is that some people see teachers as glorified babysitters who get paid well enough.

I disagree with that sentiment, but the following story is a bit telling.

I watch *Family Feud*, and from time to time, I like to play along.

The Fast Money round comes along, and Steve Harvey begins firing questions at the contestant. 


A sport in which spectators become hushed while the players play.… *Golf*  
What do you think’s a fair yearly salary for a teacher?… *$58,000*  
A beverage that tastes TERRIBLE when it’s lukewarm.…  *Beer*  
Something every bank robber needs.… *A gun*…
Something your mom would steal from a fancy hotel.… *Soap*  

The answers written above were the first contestant's responses. My response for the second question, relevant to this discussion: $100,000.

Then the results are revealed:

&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;
:---|---|---|:---|---
Golf|39|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;
$58,000|0|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;
Beer|32|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;
Gun|36|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;
Soap|33|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;
**Total**|140|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;

So the other contestant is brought out from backstage and the process repeats itself.

A sport in which spectators become hushed while the players play.… *Tennis*  
What do you think’s a fair yearly salary for a teacher?… *$40,000*  
A beverage that tastes TERRIBLE when it’s lukewarm.…  *Water*  
Something every bank robber needs.… *Getaway car*…
Something your mom would steal from a fancy hotel.… *Robe*  

My response for the second question, the second time around: $150,000.

And the results:

&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;
:---|---|---|:---|---
*Golf*|*39*|&nbsp;|Tennis|31
*$58,000*|*0*|&nbsp;|$40,000|11
*Beer*|*32*|&nbsp;|Water|0
*Gun*|*36*|&nbsp;|Getaway Car|5
*Soap*|*33*|&nbsp;|Robe|5
&nbsp;|&nbsp;|&nbsp;|**Total**|192

During the reveal, Steve says the number 1 answers for each of the questions. Towels for question 5, gun for question 4, beer for question 3, golf for question 1.

The number 1 answer for question 2: $40,000, to which I said, "That's not enough."

Shame on you, *Family Feud* survey respondents, for not thinking about the teachers.

Wait a second… this isn't New Jersey!
Welcome to the Forest Hills Conga Line. 

If your train makes it to Roosevelt Avenue and your destination is Forest Hills or beyond, take the E or F train at Roosevelt Avenue.

If you're at a local station between Grand Avenue and Forest Hills, get off and take the Q60 bus.

If you're at Elmhurst Avenue, take a Manhattan-bound train back to Roosevelt Avenue and then take a Jamaica-bound E or F train.

If you're stuck between stations, you're outta luck until the train reaches the next station… *if* it ever reaches the next station.

Have a nice day.

On the [Southern Region post on the SCS Forum](https://forum.scssoft.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=212941), last edited on January 30th, there's the following message from one of the mod authors:

> Read this message by SimKa regarding the non-labeled signs in Italy:

>I'm not the author of the adapted version [for] ETS2 1.30. The problem with the signs in Italy and the errors in the UK are corrected in the version of the modification which is currently under development.

>The modification version, which was published yesterday, does not contain any fixes, but only allows you to play with SR using ETS 1.30. The author of this adaptation is a fan of our map. I think that yesterday's modification of the map is currently aimed at players who use only RusMap and Southern Region maps for the game without leaving them. I would recommend that players who do not use the Southern Region map as one of the main regions for the game, abandon the version of the map published yesterday before the official update of the modification. Let me remind you that currently the official update of the Southern Region is under development.

Apparently, a fan of SR updated the existing mod to be compatible with ETS2 1.30, but didn't take Italy DLC into account, so blank signs abound there.

Relevant bit of *Simpsons* trivia from the [episode's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Feare):
>There were difficulties getting this episode up to the minimum length of an episode and many scenes were added in post-production. The episode starts with a repeat of a couch gag that was first used in the episode "Lisa's First Word", which is considerably longer than the typical couch gag. The crew added an Itchy & Scratchy cartoon and a few misleads as to who was trying to kill Bart. Even with all of these additions, the episode still ran short of time. ***This led to the creation of the rake sequence, which became a memorable moment of the episode, and the entire series. Originally, Sideshow Bob was only supposed to step on one rake after he stepped out from the underside of the Simpson family's car, but this was changed to nine rakes in a row. According to executive producer Al Jean, the idea was to make the scene funny, then drag the joke out so that it is no longer funny, and then drag it out even longer to make it funny again.***

Also…

>Kelsey Grammer [who does the voice for Sideshow Bob] did not know that the rake scene was extended, because he had only done the moan once and was surprised when he saw the final product.

At the time this video was recorded (November 9, 2017), neither *ATS: Oregon* nor *ETS2: Further East* had been announced (*ATS: New Mexico* was released in conjunction with the 20th Anniversary celebration, and *ETS2: Italia* was at or near the beta stage), so the upcoming DLCs Pavel is referring to here are those.

After activating the Secret menu (via YOUCHEAT), activate the $100K for the Poor, Show Tells, and Show Down Cards options, and set AI Folding to Never. 

$100K is enough to buy-in at Paris, which is the second highest tournament in the game. When playing, keep folding until there’s one other player at the table, then play against that player until you advance. If the tournament has more than one table, repeat the process. If you have a decent hand and more money than your opponent, feel free to force them to go all in.

I picked up 4 of these being sold together as a lot. 

Part of the item description (emphasis mine) read:

> Items were tested BUT have mechanical issues which may include *not powering on, charging and/or connecting*. No chargers.

I took it to mean that they didn’t have a FireWire charger with which to test these things, so I took a chance and bid. I ended up being the only bidder and got them for almost $22 shipped. 

Once they arrived, I tested them with a FW charger and found the three 20GB models actually worked, but the 30GB model had hard drive issues. Of course, their batteries wouldn’t hold a charge for long. 

I ended up keeping two of them, sold one of them for almost as much as I paid for the lot, and am thinking about selling the other one. On the two that I kept, I’ve replaced the batteries, and changed out the dead 30GB drive with a working 40GB drive.

Spring Creek is home to express routes mostly. Then there’s the B100 (Midwood ⇔ Mill Basin), a route that runs nearly parallel to the B2, and the B103 (Downtown ⇔ Canarsie), which runs along the Prospect Expressway for most of its length (the expressway, not the B103 route).
That missing apostrophe makes all the difference.

Looks like OP is on iOS, so that wouldn’t work. 
Aww!
It's a highly intrusive DRM (Digital Restrictions Management) scheme that's been proven to be anti-consumer.

Among its transgressions:

\1. Requiring an online connection to play, even in single player. 

From [this well-written explanation](https://whyisdenuvobad.github.io/):
>If at some point in the future any part of their DRM service chain is shut down due to internet outage or a company going bankrupt, games will be inaccessible.

One example occurred late last year when the validation servers for Arkham Knight and Mad Max went down. Players posted on the Steam forums asking what the matter was. ([Arkham Night](http://steamcommunity.com/app/208650/discussions/0/2549465882930894366/) [Mad Max](http://steamcommunity.com/app/234140/discussions/0/2906376154328223062/))

And for players with unreliable (or no) connection, the game is literally unplayable, as [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackSupport/comments/61kskg/denuvo_is_really_anticonsumer/) points out. Among the complaints brought up here:

>I bought FIFA 16 in a local store a year ago for like 15 euro (it was on sale; that's why i bought it). The problem is that I am a seaman and I am working on a ship and the internet connection is not very good. Thanks to Denuvo i couldn't play the game I bought. … My point is, what are the developers thinking? When I buy a game, I want to have full access because I bought it. It's like when you buy a car and then you can't change anything mechanical on it. That's why after this situation I'll never buy any Denuvo games again. I have to login 2-3 times just to play a game... I don't understand why developers think like that. 

\2. It's not cross-platform compatible. It requires not just Windows, but 64-but Windows. Anyone still stuck in the black-and-white days of 32-bit systems as well as users of macOS and Linux can't run these games.

\3. (an extension of 1): What if there's a really popular game and several years down the road you want to wax nostalgic with a classic game? If it uses Denuvo, you can't do that.

The hard drive on an iPod mini can be replaced with a CF card. I have a 32GB iPod mini that originally came with 4GB.
I took a job along that same route (though to the Palermo CdE, so the total route was about 6025 km). It took nearly 4 hours in one sitting, though I will admit that once I got to Oulu, I started driving at speeds more appropriate for American roads. The ferry from Longyearbyen cuts quite a bit of distance, so instead of 6000 km, you're driving about 4700 km.

The Simpson children discover Marge’s diploma in *That '90s Show*, which wrecks the whole narrative of Homer and Marge meeting in 1974 and their kids being born during the 1980s.

Pictures of a row of yellow cabs, the Lower Manhattan skyline, Coney Island, the New York State Pavilion and Unisphere, the Staten Island Ferry and the Statue of Liberty, Yankee Stadium, and the subway, with the text "NEW York City" written in three different typefaces: *NEW* from *The New Yorker*, *York* from *The New York Times*, and *City* in Helvetica. 

What part of that makes it hideous/ugly?

>Once the water started pouring out through the truck's 5-inch hose, it put to shame the volume produced by the Mexican ladder truck, which featured a 2½-inch hose. “I wish we would have had that truck during the Ellis and Potrero fire” which destroyed five downtown homes in April 2010, Robles said.

I'm guessing the purchasing of that truck was in response to that Ellis and Portero fire.

Why are you running such old versions? 

ATS 1.3 was released in June 2016 (in conjunction with the Arizona DLC release, pre-rescale).

ETS2 version 1.3 was released much earlier, February 6, 2013. It includes officially licensed Volvo and Iveco trucks, among other things. 

If you’re talking about the *most recent* version of the games, you’ll want version 1.***30***, as in the *thirtieth* major revision of the software.

Not exactly. Articulated railcars have connections between sections, but they are considered a single unit. The [BMT D-type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-type_Triplex_%28New_York_City_Subway_car%29) is a three-section articulated car with gangways between the sections. Two of the car's four bogies are shared by two sections. [Multi-section cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Multi-section_car_%28New_York_City_Subway_car%29) built for the BMT during the 1930s were five-section articulated units on six bogeys each.

The design of the R211T cars is based on a design used by, among others, the [Toronto Rocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Rocket) and London's [S stock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Underground_S7_and_S8_Stock), where each open gangway car has its own set of bogies and is therefore considered an individual carriage instead of part of a larger unit.

* Price before tax < US$10

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Line_Extension#New_Opposition):

> Due to protests from Beverly Hills residents and local officials, the Metro Board approved an amendment requesting detailed study and comparison of the two Century City station options in the FEIR. Metro eventually chose the Century City station location of Constellation Blvd and Avenue of the Stars, displeasing Beverly Hills and its school district, as the route traveled under Beverly Hills High School. They preferred the Santa Monica Blvd and Avenue of the Stars intersection. Metro argued earthquake faults and abutting a golf course made the location undesirable and would be underserved. After legal battles and court hearings Metro prevailed proving the DEIR was correct. At the Metro Board meeting in late October 2010, the Metro Board certified the DEIR and accepted the staff recommendation as the Locally Preferred Alternative (LPA). …

>During the planning and environmental review process, the Beverly Hills Unified School District and the city of Beverly Hills objected to the placement of the subway tunnel underneath Beverly Hills High School between the Wilshire/Rodeo and Century City stations. Metro chose a route placing the Century City station at Constellation Boulevard instead of Santa Monica Boulevard, due to lower ridership and an earthquake fault zone in the latter area. The school district claimed that Metro did not properly study the route to the Constellation Boulevard station, which it says could pose a safety risk to students. The school district and city filed a lawsuit in July 2012 against Metro. In April 2014, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge John A. Torribio ruled that Metro had properly conducted environmental studies under the California Environmental Quality Act and a transit hearing under the requirements of the Public Utilities Code. The school district and city appealed the decision to the California Court of Appeal. Beverly Hills Unified School District and Beverly Hills interest groups after spending $10 million on the lawsuit through August 2017, BHUSD lost the appeal to prevent Metro from contracting with the FTA for the subway project.

Occasionally, but they only ever sing the first verse, which says, when translated into contemporary vernacular: “Hey, buddy, can you still see the American Flag?”
I doubt I would have been able to do any homework on the school bus. The suspension on those things made it feel like you were riding a bounce house on wheels. You could seriously get a couple of seconds of air time if you were in the back of the bus, and your seat belt was loose enough. 

*The rule was you had to wear a seat belt. Nobody said it had to be tight across your lap.*
And now the bus has to have a sign that says *This bus has been checked for sleeping children*. 
I did the public transit thing from the middle of 7th grade through high school. This was during the time they gave students “flash passes” to allow them to ride the subway and buses for free (or at half fare if the student lived closer to the school). Then there was the transition to Student MetroCards. Same deal, but added flexibility* if a student had many options to travel between school and home. It also allowed 3 (or in some cases 4) rides per school day, so I would use it for side trips into Manhattan on my way home from school.

*There were several private bus operators in the city during this time in addition to the NYCTA, so when I first started using public transit for school travel, I got two passes: one from TCC, and the other from GBL. These were restricted to certain routes, and those routes would be stamped on the passes. (Though some drivers seemed to be too strict; on my way home one day I boarded a bus on my designated route at a bus stop a block away from the normal stop students from the school would board. I show my pass. Driver asks what school I go to. I answer. He says you got to board at the other stop, i.e. the normal one for students from that school.) For high school, it was a pass from QSC, for a route that runs rather infrequently. With the transition to MetroCard, I could take the subway instead of the bus, and I did.

It would essentially follow the A train to Jay Street, switch over to the F line, then once it gets to Smith-9th, force everyone off, then use the relay at 4th Avenue to reverse direction (doing what the G train did before it was extended to Church Avenue). The nice thing about Smith-9th is that it's the most elevated station in the entire system, and one would need to descend several flights of stairs to reach a passageway which connects to escalators to the surface and a stairway up to the other platform.

South of World Trade Center, Jay Street could be used as a terminal, but that would require either a relay at the lower level of Bergen Street, or an immediate reversal on the southbound A track to return to Manhattan. The relay would get people off the train, but it's not the most inhospitable conditions for someone trying to use the train as a hotel on wheels. Smith-9th is the next station that can be (and has been) used as a terminal. Its elevation and means of egress from the platforms make it a much better choice. Add to that the fact that it's quite cold in the winter, so sending E trains there would be a better way to deal with the issue.

Prospect Park to 7th Avenue on the Q/B

9th Avenue to 36th Street on the D

8th Avenue to 59th Street on the N

Parkside Avenue or Beverley Road to Church Avenue on the Q (I know Church isn’t completely underground, but it comes very close)

Gun Hill Road or Morris Park to Pelham Parkway on the 5.

The station in the video is Kings Highway on the N. Adjacent stations would be Avenue U and Bay Parkway, which have a similar station layout. 
This is why I would have E trains extended to Smith-9th Streets at the south end, and swapped with the F at the north end overnight.

Select the driver in Driver Manager and then click on the truck. This takes you to that truck’s entry in the Truck Manager. You can then either Sell or Relocate the truck. 

If you relocate a truck to a slot with another truck in it, the trucks will swap places. 

Same thing with relocating drivers. If, for example, Paul F is in slot 1 at the London garage and Pavel S is in slot 1 at the Prague garage, moving Paul F to slot 1 at Prague will automatically move Pavel S to London. 
If that “10 dollars” were a “Pay once for lifetime access” deal, I’d go for it. But no, it’s $10 a month, or $120 a year.

Not exactly. Look at any measure with a dotted quarter note. That note takes the value of three eighth notes out of a maximum of six. That dotted quarter takes up half the measure, the following eighth note takes the next one-sixth, and the triplet takes up the remaining one-third. 

In the original tune, a chord in that position takes up five-ninths of the measure (a dotted quarter tied with another quarter), with four eighth notes making up the remainder. 

My point is that that five-ninetieths (or one-eighteenth) difference between the next note coming at 50% (in 3/4) versus 55.555…% (in 9/8) ***does*** affect the rhythm, and if someone plays the hymn as written, the rhythm will sound off.
Oh, there still *plenty* of songs like that in the hymnbook. Allow me to list some.

Come, Come, Ye Saints (especially the third verse)

Our Mountain Home So Dear

Oh Ye Mountains High

For the Strength of the Hills

They, the Builders of the Nation

The Wintry Day, Descending to Its Close (third and fourth verses)




Mine is “Teach Me to Walk in the Light.” That second verse just irks me. Especially when it’s sung in sacrament meeting… at a single adult branch… where not even one “little child” is present. 

Then there’s “Israel, Israel, God is Calling.” My MTC companion would sing that while getting ready one day, and ever since then, it rubs me the wrong way. Granted, this was about six months after 9/11 so I was still a bit sensitive to the issue. 

I still walk out of the room whenever these are announced. 
But that last chord… a D major chord! (It’s D minor in the other verses.)
I love this one!
Have you ever noticed that *O My Father* is played as a 9/8 but appears in the book in 3/4? Well, the original tune [is actually in 9/8 with a 12/8 refrain](https://hymnary.org/media/fetch/147343). 

Listen to how it sounds on the [lds.org music player](https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/O-my-father?lang=eng) and compare that with the 9/8 version.
It’s not Relief Society. 
Ah, but there’s a method to this madness!

McConkie *knows* that it’s common in the church to skip the verses printed below the music. That’s why he had composer John Longhurst write the tune so that each playthrough of the tune would be enough for two verses of McConkie’s poem (which he gave in the Sunday morning session of General Conference, April 9, 1972).
And so, The Cheat mashed play on an extremely expensive jambox with high-speed dubbing and everybody put their weight on it!

Bernadette is pregnant with her second child – a boy (her first is a girl; when she cries, sounds a lot like Howard’s mother, who dies during Season 8), and Raj has a successful job at the planetarium.

The road you have as California 91 (and the route shown on your map is more or less a combination of the actual paths of the 91 and 55) doesn’t exist on the ATS map.

A more accurate representation of the path would be along routes 76 and 79. The 76 is just north of Carlsbad and the 79 is several miles east of Colton (where the actual junction between the 10 and the 15 is located) in a town called Beaumont. 

Now, the 76 and the 79 don’t connect to each other until deep in central San Diego county, on a route that, if followed, practically turns back on itself, passes through Wine Country, joins the 15 in Temecula for a few miles, then heads towards the 10 on a path that passes through Hemet. I suppose what’s on the ATS map is some creative license on SCS’ part.

Even Times Square was a local station when it opened in 1904. Then again, some stations were built as local stations despite major “fare generators” in the area. For example, the 155th Street-8th Avenue station (opened 1933) had its entrance right by the Polo Grounds (1890-1964). Passageways and stairways to the street were extra wide to accommodate. The next stop to the north, 161st Street-River Avenue, right next to Yankee Stadium (1923-2008), is also a local station. 

It must have been interesting when the Giants and the Yankees were in town on the same day.

If you were in northern portions of The Bronx or eastern Queens, you could see totality for about a minute.

You forgot the hyphen. It’s /u/iFrozen-, not  /u/iFrozen.

Most of the trains which stop at Forest Hills and Kew Gardens skip Woodside. Conversely, most of the trains which stop at Woodside skip Forest Hills and Kew Gardens.
Yeah, I saw that. What I'm talking about though is CCTV footage of the silo actually collapsing and spilling corn all over the road, or some dashcam catching footage of the action.

It's like a headline claiming footage of a major car crash, and it's just shots of the mangled wreck on the side of the road, and probably a shot of it being loaded onto a truck to be hauled away.
Something that isn’t conveyed well in English language broadcasts. 

[As referenced on *The Simpsons*](https://youtu.be/rJu2qSJ9zno?t=1m32s)
The Park is closed between 01:00 and 06:00. 
Then there’s the Q102 bus. Yeah, it goes to Queens, but there are plenty of subway options once the bus gets to Queens Plaza. 
It used to cost 25¢; they dropped the fare a few years ago. 
It’s interesting to note that the building number can be more than 99. For example, the building at the northwest corner of Woodhaven Boulevard & 64th Road has the address 63-118 Woodhaven Boulevard. The 98- block of Queens Boulevard goes all the way up to 98-120. 

Though interestingly, the 39- block of 48th Street in Sunnyside Gardens goes up to 40-39 on the odd-numbered side, as if there were some phantom 40th… something between 39-99 and 40-01. The buildings on the other side of the street don’t get past 39-90, and 39-88 is the highest numbered building on the same block on 49th Street. 
Yup. Though here in NYC they’re usually suspended over the intersection, though the [national MUTCD dictates signals be placed on the far side of the intersection](https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009/part4/part4d.htm#section4D11) (Part 4, Chapter 4D, Section 4D-11, paragraph 06; [Section 4D-13](https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/htm/2009/part4/part4d.htm#section4D13), Paragraph 02).
I did this for the World Cup four years ago. No regrets. That Germany-Brazil semifinal match: sweetness!
I would say the same for most of those who have been named so far.  
Every time I see a headline like this, I’m disappointed if there’s no footage of the actual collapse. 
Even if the sign had a comma after *obstruction*, it would work well. 

"Stop the Obstruction, Democrat Losers!"  
And  
"Stop the Democrat Obstruction, Losers!"
He’s right, you know. Democrats are being obstructed far too frequently lately. It needs to stop. 

Though the irony here is that he’s calling for a stop to Democrat obstruction, but he’s wearing a MAGA hat, which conveys the opposite message.

In this case, *homophonophobic* would be more accurate.

I was looking at this book about the Malbone Street wreck of 1918 (along what is now the Franklin Avenue Shuttle). It listed the names and addresses of the victims (97 died). I recall at least one of those addresses being on Avenue Q. 
It’s illegal to paint a real gun to look like a toy. 

It’s also illegal to make toy guns that look real. 
History lesson: many of those were also a lettered avenue at some point. 
Albemarle was Avenue A, Beverly was Avenue B. Not sure if Ditmas west of Flatbush was called Avenue D, but it does meet with D at Flatbush. 
Edit: D turns back to Ditmas at East 57th Street, and this run of Ditmas coexists with *another* Avenue D between East 88th Street and Rockaway Avenue. I think at this point they should have just resigned to actually using the name *Avenue E*. 

Ditmas also meets with 18th Avenue, presenting an unusual meeting of the Sunset Park/Bay Ridge system (numbered avenues and numbered streets) and the Kensington/Canarsie/Coney Island system (primarily lettered avenues with numbered streets prepended with East or West). Edit: Similar breaches of the system occur with 86th Street at Stillwell, and Bay Parkway (née 22nd Avenue) at McDonald Avenue. 

It’s also interesting to note that Bedford Avenue runs from Greenpoint all the way to Sheepshead Bay. Few streets in Brooklyn do a continuous north-to-south like that. The only other one I can think of is Flatbush Avenue: Manhattan Bridge to the Marine Parkway Bridge. 
Those streets don’t exist in that neighborhood!

Yeah. If they need thirty-three cashiers on duty, the place is busy. 
TJ’s doesn’t need parking lots to make the stores seem busy. 
I know, right? A lot of the stations on the Broad Street line look so similar. The local stations have ornately decorated station walls, but the express stations, not so much. 

However,based on the color of the tiles on that column, I’d say it’s the [Ellsworth-Federal Sts](http://www.roadandrailpictures.com/rpaellsw.htm) station. 
Oh, come on! The OP isn’t even 48 hours old!

And I meant it as fun banter as well!
On the Friday before the NFC and AFC championship games, which determine who plays in Super Bowl 52, the NFL posts to their official Facebook page announcing a chance to win a trip to SB52 to see the Patriots and the Vikings play each other there. 

The point is moot now since the Eagles earned their spot in SB52.
Well, the Vikings will have that up long after the game to reflect on what could have been. 
There is no such thing as an 8th Generation iPod Nano. 
If the NFL were indeed rigged, this would be a way to convince people that it isn’t. 

1. Post the matchup for the Super Bowl on the Friday before the AFC/NFC championship games are played. 
2. Rig said AFC/NFC games so that one or both teams in the matchup, which has now circulated on all social media platforms and reported through many news outlets, loses. 
3. ???
4. PROFIT!!!

It originally was its own app. 
I got on a 3 that was entered Times Square on the local track. The following train was a 2 on the express track. I was going to 50th Street so that was kinda nice. The train was nearly empty as well. 
Or the 7. You know how in Japan they have people who push people onto the trains so the doors can close? We were near that point today. 
You know, in the world of the Internet, there are some things that just go better with sound. This is certainly one of them, so it's a no from me.
You get the golden buzzer for saving this post.
Frankly, commercials like this should just disappear. St. Jude’s, the ASPCA, Save the Children, etc.

Tight curves in general.

There are a few places where the sharp curves might be an issue. 

On the J line, the curves between Crescent Street and Cypress Hills, and west of Alabama Avenue.

On the R/W line, the curve north of Cortlandt Street Station. That one is *the* reason the end doors on 75-foot cars are locked.

Remember when Siri was a standalone app?

I was running that app on an iPhone 3G, and then a server side update basically told everyone that you need an iPhone 4S to access Siri, and it’s baked into iOS 5, so you don’t need to use the app anymore.

Oh, come on! G is already so big the observable universe is too small to contain it. Why bother multiplying every number from that to 1?
>(99999999999999999999!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) / ((99999999999999999999!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)+1)

At this point, it’d probably just equal 1.

Edit: WolframAlpha wouldn’t parse this properly unless wrapping each factorial expression in parentheses. Having done so, it produced an extremely large number which could only be expressed as a Power of 10 representation, which is a tetration of 10s. For this result, I’ll use Knuth’s up-arrow notation to write the result. 

It is (10↑↑39)\^21.29149551270651

For those that might not understand even this, it’s 10^10^10^.^.^.^10 with thirty-nine 10s in the exponentiation stack.

I skimmed through the video, and it looks like there are bike lanes for most of it. Grand Army Plaza to Downtown Brooklyn, then across the Brooklyn Bridge to Manhattan and then down Broadway. 

The issue is that while there are bike lanes, there’s sometimes some kind of obstruction in it. 
The foreground is the Bethesda Terrace in Central Park, looking south. 

The view is from somewhere in Chelsea, probably in one of the taller buildings in the area.

Yup. You need to deliver them to different cities. 

For example, if you do Berlin to Amsterdam, then Amsterdam to Copenhagen, you could take a job from Copenhagen to Amsterdam, but it won’t count since you already made a delivery to Amsterdam. You could take a job from Copenhagen to Berlin, since you need to deliver to the city for it to count. 
Lowering the cruise control minimum to 5 km/h would be useful.

My issue is with using straight arrows to indicate an exit. They could very well mean continue on the roundabout. What threw me off earlier was the use of those straight arrows leading me to think this was a curvy one-way road. 

My point is this: ***straight arrows should NEVER be used on a roundabout!***
Don’t block the box
Blame it on the maintainers for not properly marking the roundabout. 
This bugs me to no end. I have playlists sorted alphabetically by song title, and when I add new songs to the playlist, they always get shoved to the bottom. It’s been that way ever since I started using iTunes Match.

I know many LDS members who *didn't* vote for *Fünfundvierzig*. Some were McMullin voters. Others were "with Her" (i.e. voted for Hillary).

Another method is to edit the save file.

1. Open your `config.cfg` file.
2. Search for `uset g_save_format`.  
3. Change whatever value appears there to 2. 
4. Save the file.
5. Load your ETS profile, then exit. (This forces an autosave.)
6. Download [SII Decrypt](https://forum.scssoft.com/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=245874). Extract the `SII_Decrypt.exe` file to desktop.
7. Navigate to `Documents\Euro Truck Simulator 2\Profiles\{Your Profile}\save\autosave`. `{Your Profile}` is the folder with the most recent *Date modified* time.
7. Copy the `game.sii` file to desktop. Keep this window open. 
8. Drag the copied `save.sii` file on top of the `SII_Decrypt.exe` icon. This will decrypt the save file.
9. Open `save.sii` with a text editor.
0. Search for `money_account`. Change the value that's there to the amount you want. Any 64-bit signed integer (–9 223 372 036 854 775 808 to +9 223 372 036 854 775 807) will do.
1. Save the file.
2. Rename the `save.sii` file in the autosave folder to something like `save.sii.bak`.
3. Copy your modified `save.sii` file to the autosave folder.
4. Open ETS2, load the profile, and enjoy your modded money.

For example, I have a highlight and note for a single word in [1 Nephi 15:35](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/15.35?lang=eng#35), *preparator*, with a note that the word was meant to be *proprietor*. 

In the apps for iOS and Windows 10, the word is highlighted properly. In the web version, the highlight is a few words later, under *wherefore*. I highlighted *preparator* in the web version in a different style, and the highlight appears in the app under *devil is*. 

Then again, I have a link in Alma 1:4, but that isn't showing in the web version.
My thought process I had in response to this video is interesting. 

First response: *What idiot turns right from the left lane, especially without signalling?*  
It wasn't clear at first glance that cammer was in a roundabout. At first glance, it appears to be a curvy section of one-way road.

Next response: *Why use* ***straight*** *arrows on the road for what is supposedly an exit from a roundabout?*  
This one is on whoever maintains the road here. The exit should be marked with a left-turning arrow. 

Essentially, this appears to be a case of *Instructions unclear; crashed my car*.

But h3lix is a partially untethered JB. I kept booting into 10.3.3. (Edit: when rebooting using Coolbooter)
This is more like a reverse DDOI, where it reads correctly left to right, top to bottom; but there’s some spacing element where the reading order is not apparent when you look at it. Think of it as though you had DON’T DEAD on the left door, and OPEN INSIDE on the right door. When the doors are shut, it reads properly, “DON’T OPEN DEAD INSIDE.” Now, for the purpose of this illustration, instead of being hinged, the doors are sliding. Now, slide the doors open, and you’ll see one door with DON’T DEAD, and another one with OPEN INSIDE.

That’s what this sign resembles.
