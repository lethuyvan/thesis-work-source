I'm jealous as fuck... where was this btw?
Uh...?
I'm hoping he does thats an honour 
Not a clue I was just watching live videos on youtube and it came up in the recommended bit
Is this the lyrics of a new kanye west song?
Yeah someone said it seriously then everyone jumped on it and made it a meme 
It was a meme in the facebook group UK pop punk for ages and I'm pretty sure one of the band commented and reacted to it meaning the meme absolutely blew up and everyone was saying it across all social media then next think you know its on tshirts and on the album
I've listened to a few and tbh I think shane lacks research for most of the people he interviews 
Code orange have a couple with just female vocals and others shes doing backing vocals
Legit?
Did he run the Barry Stanton twitter account?
Have you asked him about it or told your mum or is this the first time telling anyone?

Thats how they get you i wish you luck...
The latest episode was 30 mins on topic and 30 mins keem crying because clown was late and chad crying because keem was screaming it was a mess honestly
Ah makes sense it's gone down hill really fast 
Do you listen to the baited podcast? They were talking about H3 and chad went off on one calling him every name under the sun but tbh i agree he's sucking keem off but chads always been open about his opinion and saying whatever the fuck he wants.
A podcast with max, Ian and Joji would be amazing just getting them all in the same room together would be amazing considering each of them seem to have parted and taken different directions which is sad to see and I'd really like to hear them talk they were such a good team/group of people in the videos I always hoped they'd do a podcast (Max, Ian and Joji) back when they made videos together
Chad hates H3H3 with a passion have you not seen all his tweets about him? This would never ever happen as much as id love to see this :(
Oh shitttt i didn't see this i hope it means releasing music then!
Or watch it on a *completely lega*l free service with no ads already ;)
This show is actually so good though such a good watch! But fuck watching it on 4 theres too many ads 
I'm pretty sure it's named that because thats where John met the girl and where the story of the song began

It actually is, especially hot topic exclusives and other exclusives from american places
I actually picked mine up from a local forbidden planet after months of looking i must have missed the pre-order
I was looking for exactly the same thing and a song of theirs was on a shuffle and i was instantly hooked.
Then your username really checks out

Even so you are going to die tomorrow so you can LITERALLY do anything all laws are now null because how can they sentence you if you're dead the next day? if you get killed so what you're dead the next day? you say you'd feel bad for what a few hours before you die? you could just go around and do whatever the fuck you wanted with no consequences if you would go to work why? you're not going to get anything from it because you're literally dead the next day 
Thank you! I most definitely will be next payday as i can pretty much complete my collection for rick and morty from there!
£7 shipping is great considering the cost of shipping from hot topic then the import charges too I havent heard of popcultcha before so thanks!

It means Xtreme Memory Profile. What XMP does is, it allow your Motherboard BIOS to automatically configure the overclocked DRAM voltage and timing information instead of forcing you to do it manually. and try removing the battery from your motherboard for 10 seconds then insert it back in again you just need to get to the bios and from there it should be an easy fix and POST every time

Multiple people ive seen have had this problem with ryzen 5 1600's and I'm pretty sure you need to turn on the XMP on the bios. If it wont post at all just keep trying and trying to get into the bios and make sure XMP is turned on.


Hot topic exclusives will constantly ruin my collections.

This is not the case as you can see when you click the video it says the people's names meaning this was a manual take down meaning someone went out of their way to find a part of which they claim to own not a record label and the band which is sampled had no problem with it before infact im pretty sure he got the rights for this song
Yeah if you look at it closely you can see its not back lit sorry if i came across like a dick mate!
Its just the keys are completely solid and my razer keyboard you can tell its a backlit when taking a picture as the keys aren't solid if you had a backlit one and a none backlit one in person you'd realise the difference they look completely different like in the picture.
Does that even slightly look like a backlit keyboard?

I really hope I get to see them live one day
Yeah I agree that’s what it was for me but now I can hear the lyrics it makes them even better they have some amazing lyrics
I know it’s so sick!
Yeah i feel exactly the same I hope they maintain the same sort of style they have and had on mend move I'd hate them to change too much and have a full album like hurt.
Oh my god someone is wearing one that has a button that lights the jumper up and it plays jingle bells... everytime someone new walks in they press it and show them... kill me
I feel like lots of people are like this
Woah thats cool you should take a picture so we can all see it!

SO JELOUS THEY LOOK SO GOOD LIVE!
S O FUCKING JEALOUS!
Casey are honestly something else they are absolutely amazing
"so we've had recent reports that you didn't wear a christmas jumper on christmas jumper day is this true? do you hate christmas? are you that racist towards christmas? do you hate cheer? did it make you feel good not wearing a christmas jumper? thats it you're fired Merry christmas you christmas hating monster!"
Mannnn i'd kill to see them live I'm in the uk and bands seem to hate us for headliners these days 
Yes FUCK if you're into sort of heavier stuff then Mend, Move on is amazing they're EPs are amazing too honestly 10/10 they're whole discography is back-to-back bangers.
I'm scared thats the case here too... i work in an office where we just use the desks along side a different company as i work at a startup and theres only 2 of us in the company and my boss (the other person) is on holiday he usually forwards the emails from the other company where we rent the desk space as i dont get the emails from them so...
*was
Fuck yeah!
Yeah fuck my peers!
I actually have a white shirt on so I could just say its a very snowy picture so snowy you cant see the snowman on it
Except everyone in the office seems to take part in christmas jumper day yet i don't think i saw one red nose on red nose day... 
I didn't even know people still wore christmas jumpers tbh...

Wait how did you even do that to it theres no scratch marks in the middle or holes for rails to be put on it and theres barely any pop marks did you literally put this together to ride around and not actually skate with it?
Yup i feel you I'm a UK collector so its even harder for me to get all the exclusives etc :(
My god this is going to be a hard one to get HT exclusives are the number 1 reason i hate being a UK collector :(
Fair enough mate! We have clearly had different experiences! :)
if its on the camera roll? like i said in the original comment
So if youre showing someone a video you just hold the video infront of them for the whole video?
She apparently lied about it idk its kinda a weird situation nobody really knows whats true he's trying to say the police are framing him now to try get him sent down for life... 
This could actually be useful if you're showing someone something and they're one of those people who snatch the phone off you and start scrolling and shit. For example if you're showing them a picture on your camera roll and only want them to look at that picture and not go through all your photos that shits annoying as hell
I saw this post the other day and I've been praying for a headline since :((

Multiplayer is trash anyway and load times aren't even that bad tbh (on pc that is). Multiplayer is just a pile of shit.
They gave up on GTA 5 single player for more multiplayer shit it really wouldn't surprise me if they make a sole multiplayer game tbh.
GTA 6 won't exist just more microtransactions for GTA online maybe a GTA online 2.0 but they realise money comes in from the multiplayer transactions so R.I.P GTA singleplayer games...
Hey. I got 7.
Username checks out
Comment anything you say?
Aight but this isn't anyway justified because i like the band but no proof has been arisen for so long after she keeps calling them out if it were true shed at least prove herself correct or even at least go to the police this just shows lack of evidence and makes the whole thing unbelievable. I never wanted to argue anyway just stating my opinion on the matter if it comes to light there's evidence then so be it but at this point, i call bullshit.
Their popularity status was probably the only reason she would have to make something like that up though for the attention... thats all i can think of unless its true all im saying is theres no proof and she just keeps throwing the same shit at them even though she has nothing to back these points up if they was such a small time band as you said i they would take one fans comments more seriously but at this point it could be that they havent even seen any comments about these allegations unless she has proof they cant prove it didnt happen considering they will no way post all of their conversations for the public shes picked a good lie or a really sad terrible truth...
Idk attention? maybe? and I wouldn't call them small time really but 
birth planet first then in another few years dimension number 
There is no proof of this even happening with the moose blood thing she just sort of said it and stuck with it I'm not saying it didn't happen but i think they haven't addressed it as theres no proof even remotely just someone shooting allegations at this point if proof is brought to light or she files a police report and its proven they will then probably address it but no point addressing everything each fan says the thing with glenn was impossible to ignore because there was so much proof and so much going on and they just completely outed him.
They went to the police and they checked up on all the accusations and the police didn't find anything wrong with anything so only assumed as a lie and then im pretty sure lloyd just had beef with the rest of the band once he had been called out but doesn't put him in the best position as it was right after the accusations had been made and investigated meaning people associated it with the accusations being true but the police report being the lie... people never let shit like that go and people get shit for "defending" them but nobody actually listens to the truth which is sad...
Rick Sanchez - C-137
It's hard to stay away from the rick and morty fanbase really because its getting so big it seems to be everywhere i look which is kinda cool from how small R&M used to be when i started watching but then again is really killing the greatness of the show.
R&M is probably my favourite show of all time but the cringey annoying unfunny part of the fanbase is slowly but surely killing the whole concept and making people think ill of it... and BBT kinda went down hill but i still find it enjoyable to watch more for just background noise than to actually watch.
True theres no reason to even say either its not even funny wasnt even funny in either show let alone when you randomly come out with it just extremely embarrassing really...
Id rather hear people say bazinga than fucking pickle rick tho fuckkk
I personally think its absolutely amazing some definite bangers like Every One Lies To Me and want me around so so sick
Yup me too
They dont like talking about the whole glenn thing at all bc they know they fucked up considering there was allegations against the lead singer too and they just steered away from the allegations against him i think...

No that would be suicide
not to mention how nobody would work and how nobody would value money and how many people would turn into cunts. The world wouldn't work with everyone equal or even everyone rich as fuck nobody would do anything and life would have less of a meaning as it does now. Fuck the population.
Fuck it if we start with the really fucking poor people and everyone gives that person a dollar then move up the ladder until all the people in poverty are rich as fuck then we move to the middle class of people again until we was equal then fucked everything off and we are all billionaires then take all the money off the rich as fuck people now and make them equal and watch the world go to shit because we have no idea what to do with this money now as everyone has the same amount and then the price of the dollar falls and we end up where we are now and we ask everyone to give a dollar to one person. Also i accept paypal PM for the address if we doing this i want some damn money
I wish that was the case goddamn

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase "Wubba Lubba Dub Dub," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎
Yes its fucking amazing. Definitely my favourite from the album possibly my favourite by them.

I also recently discovered them because of a facebook post ive been nonestop listening to them for about 5 days and by nonestop i literally mean i havent listened to any other band they are fucking incredible
Poor birth control and lack of sex education
I personally think its a good album theres some bangers just from my first play through Favourites are: Airfields (personal favourite atm) live outside, an ode to lost jigsaw pieces and take my country back
Me too they did an acoustic version a few days ago so theres hope for live... i can dream...
I would kill to see skeletons live
They are such a great band theyre so nice irl too
Im so stocked on the new album

Nah you didnt just everyone has over used and killed the whole 'IM PICKLE RICK' thing :/ its about the equivalent as ****autistic screeching**** now
... 
Something like described [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/funkopop/comments/708o7d/opinions_on_the_new_rick_and_morty_pops/dn1df0r/)
Yeah idk tbh i was hoping for something different rather than just the usual regular pop 
Meh i was hoping for a larger sized pop than just regular size
I wasnt that hyped on the pickle rick i feel the jokes overused... i preordered just so there wasnt holes in my collection pretty much
Mine too i also think the pop is perfect unlike my opinions on the other pops 
I impulse preordered them all!
I know i couldnt resist buying multiple for that price considering id seen them go for £40+ online sold the 2 for 40 each so got mad return on it! and yeah i 100% agree with that!
Yeah i agree i feel like drunk crying beth should have been a variant and a normal beth couldve been the normal and yeah we had a conversation about the meeseeks box in these comments. and yeah i agree with that too and oh god damn i managed to buy 3 sold 2 on and kept one for my personal collection bought them for £15 each which is a bargain!
BELIEVABLE

SUREEEEE

I really hope they make that in later releases 
Why?
Depressing season 3 jerry would be a sick pop just him in his ripped pants id buy into that!
YES i wouldve been much more excited for this!
Im definitely just sticking with the 7 i see literally 0 reason to spend extra money on the 8 when i have a perfectly (almost) equal phone to it. the X in my opinion looks quite gimicky but will be more interesting when people get them and theres more videos of every day use etc
Idk why the fuck anyone would get offended by fucking words youre fucking retarded if you fucking do, SHIT.
So you was being a dick pretending it was the wrong number... or you just used another phone to text yourself lmao or lucky guess...
Noooo I'm definitely getting it I'm not gunna miss out on one pop to complete a collection i already have all the new ones on preorder... And yeah i see where they are coming from by giving him it but i feel like 'jerry with meeseeks box' wouldve been a go to variant rather than original.
It makes sense yeah but not half as much as if he had the things commented above it wouldn't be my go to thing associated with jerry but thats just me
We aren't talking about all pops just rick and morty pops so

Yeah i thought the same thing tbh. The meeseeks box didn't feel like it was linked to jerry in anyway i wouldn't have guessed he would have that in his hands in a million years...Yeah when he uses it he fucked the whole meeseeks operation up but the meeseeks box isnt directly associated with jerry.
UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH [Bruh](https://imgur.com/a/I4mCb)
I totally agree! the Twinkles and ghost in a jar are definitely my favourite in my collection. I'm hoping for a noob-noob one maybe sometime in the future. God damn.
In my opinion i really like each of them however a little let down the pickle rick pops are regular sized i was hoping for a larger pickle rick figure. And i was really hoping for just a normal no armoured pickle rick [Like this custom one!](https://www.reddit.com/r/funkopop/comments/6rtiaw/custom_pickle_rick_funko_pop_rick_and_morty/) Other than that I'm interested if any variants come from any of these...
I mean come on the videos by unilad i was never gunna get any upvotes anyway i just found the video funny (laughing at it not with him)
[long sigh to begin with] [express the fact you dont know where to start] [insert half assed sorry here] [back to normal self]
Would be great if you added different currencies (I'm in the UK so dollars pretty much mean nothing to my value) as theres no good app/website which has GBP tracking and valuing...

Yes you literally show them it the same as a ticket and they glance barely even looking usually and let you on
[this ,](https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/video-converter)
[or this,](http://www.flvto.biz/)
[or this one, ](http://www.youtube-mp3.org/)
[or this one too,  ](http://www.youtubeinmp3.com/)


I'm not 100% if these actually work for over 90 minutes... just google youtube to mp3 converter and look through all those

No... No it doesn't...
I mean you could use [this](http://convert2mp3.net/en/) then download the songs etc you want onto your computer then drag and drop them into itunes then sync your phone to it and add them to the phone the same as you would with other music then youre done
I mean it really also depends what course you're doing i guess...
Oh and when you get back on the return bus you will just show them it and they will usually just glance at it and then nod (most bus drivers seem to be mute most of the time)
Also say you are going to the campus you will get onto the bus ask for a single or return then say the campus place or something you know is near the stop in mind they will know where you mean as they will have done the route lots before. when youre on the bus and get to near your destination just click the little stop button which will ring a bell and tell the driver you want to stop. Most of the time if youre at uni too someone will already have clicked the button so you just need to get up and get off. On the newer first buses they have a screen with the exact place they are going to stop so if you say the place wring the first time just memorise the exact name and say that next time. 
There is an app which can get you a day rider and you just show your phone if you dont want to talk i do this and basically you can go anywhere within the distance which is stated on the app or you can even buy a weekly rider ticket which will mean you dont have to go to the hassle of buying one on the app every morning. This works the same as a day one and can just be reused im also pretty sure you can buy monthly and yearly but im not 100%
brilliant
They're literally really good friends with wstr. I know ben has been friends with sammy and alex for years! Im honestly shocked they dont bring them on more tours and i would deffo expect to see them support neck deep again 100%.

No i know they dont thats clear I was just wondering why they left the macbooks out when the thunderbolt 3 ports can do what the 3.5mm headphone jack does anyway obviously they dont do it for just the adaptors but i bet a hell the sales in adaptors has shot up now they only have thunderbolt 3 ports anyway...
But why commit to removing it for only 60% of their devices?

Yeah I really wish there was an app or something to track listens it would be so sick! have you tried spotify.me? it tells you your most listened to and what type of music you most listen to on spotify its pretty sick [Here](http://spotify.me/en)
Well have you been fired yet? I need this information 
Both albums go hard but just have different sounds
The same as impericon festival i believe
I know idk how much tickets will be though
I think its because its this was their first ep and its such a raw album with raw vocals then when they got bigger they was able to polish it more and they was able to change up their sound for wishfull thinking which is just more polished and mixed better

My guess is they wont be restocked within the 2 days you could somehow get someone to go into the store for you if you find someone in the uk willing to then they can ship it to you. they have some signed ones where they have done acoustics and signings so that might even be a better option if you can find some one
I preordered from it I had no idea it was even made by funko!
I never even knew funko made that when i saw it a month or so ago 
The one i linked?

That looks so sick.
Jesus would be a black genderless they/them triggered feminist against trump just so people wouldn't get offended by it. 

Oh and it would be an ebook 
See i was (still am ) really weedy and small haha so i literally looked like I use tumblr daily and get triggered when someone calls me by my wrong gender pronouns
When you go to get the new phone see if they will take the old phone and give you a better deal on the new phone this happened to me once they waved the upfront cost (for a contract) because I traded my shitty blackberry in they gave me a good deal as my phone was only worth about 50 and the upfront cost was 80

She was a real bitch from my brief encounter with her anyway...
The first and only time i went to a hair dressers (i have multiple family members who are qualified hair dressers so its never been a problem and isnt now i just fancied a change) I walked in didnt really know what to do (im really socially awkward and just awkward in general) the hair dresser told me to sit down so without hesitation i sat down she asked what i wanted I didnt really know so i just said a little off of my back but keep my fringe (im a guy and had quite long hair all over i meant i wanted the tiniest bit off the back and a touch up on my fringe god why couldnt i say that...) she gets the shavers out and starts going at the back of my head it was really short like almost bald short and she left my fringe she walks over to the counter and im still sat there I didnt think she had finished... She had... She calls me over and asked for £15 i gave her a 20 and got £3 back... that doesnt add up... anyway i said nothing walked out and a minute later i rang my cousin up to tell her what had happened she came and picked me up and laughed for a solid 5 mins before telling me the bad news she couldnt do anything... bare in mind this is 2 days before i go back to high school my cousin tried to make my fringe bearable by trimming it but that didnt work i looked like a lesbian moral of the story is dont go to hair dressers they are mean and make you look like a trans lesbian... I have long hair now and barely ever get it cut im scarred for life...

TL;DR asked for a trim got a shave cousin couldnt help school started again i got scarred for life of going to hair dressers.
For a second i thought i was being retarded then i thought wait a minute...

Do you mean rick with portal gun?
That was my initial thoughts when I first saw it too
Its interesting as fuck though idek why 
Im still stuckk watching documentaried even about it now! you made me so interested in it ive been reading and watching stuff since your post... I think its time for bed soon...
If i was to buy the phone outright we are talking dropping like £700 on a phone but if i get a contract i can space my money out further and yeah i was thinking about the speeds with the latest IOS im definitely looking into getting the 7 or above If i can somehow get my hands on another phone to keep me on ill look into the 8 or 7s but theres no real confirmed looks of either phone therefore I'm caseous of waiting...   
I still dont trust it i dont know what it is but theres just a part of me that doesnt trust it electronics and water arent supposed to mix aha
A few weeks with no phone is pretty hard in 2017
Yeah I saw stuff on that i just wish they'd hurry up and announce it as theres so many rumours going around and I'm in the UK and when a new phone is release the contracts for them are sky high for the actual deal youre going to get... I'm also on apprenticeship wage meaning im not getting that much money each month but enough to get a good contract for a 7 or 6s
The price of brand new iphone 8's are going to be ridiculous as to what i can afford and will probably break my bank...
I would love to try that i feel like it would be really weird because of the distinct taste iron bru has
Theres one with lemon in???????

You got me really interested and i went on another binge of reading these amas so i thought id link them for you!

There is some ama's with people who were there and an interesting one from someone who went to the school a year later. i agree it would be interesting to get another one to see how effected they are by it now
ahhhhh did my pictures help at all or nah then?
Thats been a problem with all the phones ive ever had but usually just in all normal rain damn
Does the screen still work in the rain? like is the touch effected i used my 5s in the rain and it would mess up my typing and click random things on the screen?
Wait are we not getting more explanation I'm so intrigued why you need this? haha

Theres more with even more iron bru types haha
[or this?](http://foodanddrink.scotsman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IRN-BRU-2-1.jpg)
I looked into that but i don't think the SE will last for me ill need a new one in a year and i want a long lasting phone until i 100% need another one or at the end of my contract. I agree i like bigger screens for things like that but the plus models seem too big for me
I hope my day hurries up...
The 7 sure is a lot better than the 6s but im exactly like you ive had all the s' except the 6s as i was happy with my 5s i prefer smaller phones and definitely cant deal with a plus its like a tablet to me! the 7 has a far better camera and is that bit faster i think im going to go for that tbh the deals on the 7 are pretty good too!
Statistically I have 72 years left of my life. The world will be completely different then. Every single aspect of life now will have changed to some degree. We will have ran out of fossil fuels. Normal metals as we know it now will be scarce. Ai will continue to develop insanely. The internet will not exist as we know it today. Most of my childhood actors will be long gone. My parents wont be around and i could effectively be the last of my family tree to exist. I could be completely alone.
Thats my exact problem
no matter how much they tell me i still dont think ill ever trust myself enough to test it and will still have a heart attack if i ever drop it in water... phones arent supposed to go in water...
Thank you!

is it actually though?

I agree! This ep is fucking amazing! I will die if they ever play any of these songs live.

[What is this "online hate"](http://imgur.com/W1zk4ZF)
This has to be a joke or bait
Which tweet? I assumed the full band would be there as its a signing too
What did you expect? (RIJ version) I'm a sucker for bens rough type voice and lyrics are relatable and love a good angry song. Also absolutely incredible live the crowd always go mad to that song and it just makes it much better. Sick finger pointing song. 10/10
I imagine its easier to get off than actually ride especially with no legs.
Wait... Why???

Finland?? Its happening anywhere now this is becoming the norm soon people will be reporting when a terrorist attack doesn't happen... what even is this world anymore...

Aliens? where? no they're blinking lights silly... haha... hAHAHAHAHA
This recently happened on the street i live on however they had arrows going the complete wrong ways... a day later they gave up and took the arrows off and replaced them with text signs... that where also the wrong way... now (a week later) i have a blank pole at the end of my street i think they have given up...
Legit one of my favourites! so sad its not on the actual album...
Someone recorded In bloom when they played an acoustic session [Heres the link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CbYH1DwLg4Q)
draw it out of the bank account?

I had to check the person typing this wasn't me because i think you just described me lmao 
What i do is I take some money out when i get payed and i have a piggy bank like thing which cant be opened unless you cut it open [Like this!](https://www.ebay.co.uk/i/232090353444?chn=ps&dispItem=1&adgroupid=41173316342&rlsatarget=pla-327941051664&abcId=1129006&adtype=pla&merchantid=113740874&googleloc=1006864&device=c&campaignid=861899408&crdt=0&var=531291775142) I then shove my money in that and I write in a note on my phone which has the amount in there so i can keep track then when i go to get the money for my holiday its all there because i didn't want to ruin the piggy bank. Alternatively what i used to do was i would tell myself i had for example £100 less than i actually had and treat that as my bank balance 0 
Yeah I've seen videos of those live but songs like 'in bloom', 'parachute' or 'critical mistake' would be interesting to see because they have a much more different sound than any other neck deep songs.
Yeah i agree with that it'll be interesting to see some of the new ones live and see how they actually perform them. You can definitely see they have gone in a different direction like they've said in countless interviews but i still dig it.
I did the same fucked me up every single time
you heard 19 seventy somethin yet????? that completely fucked me up 
I can't put it in order of 1-4 i feel like its too hard to give each justice for me it goes RIJ then all the other albums are on par i agree with your point on the raw part!
'are you a nazi? (please dont lie)'
I disagree I really liked the latest episode
Also the high note is followed by 'all in bloom' which takes up bens singing power it will be interesting to see if he can go from the high note to the full on part. I feel like he might have had some vocal training or such as before his voice would never have gone that high even on the other new tracks would have been a stretch but if you watch videos of warped this year you can see hes handling pretty well his voice live has definitely improved.
Yes i know but the chorus is repeated 
I agree with the live part it's gunna be very interesting to see this live and see if he actually sings it or does the thing where he will point the mic at the crowd to get them to sing it every time... I dig the diversity of the new tracks I don't think it's safe for neck deep especially because as you said bens voice doesn't usually hit the higher notes when live i think it's a rather big risk for neck deep to take considering the sound of RIJ or LNOTGY. It's interesting that's my opinion. 

p.s. I also think the whole of the pop punk genre is swaying into more pop songs rather than the more punky tracks... 

p.p.s beyond stocked for the sam carter feature on TPATP tho!
Any music can be qualified as emo as emo is just short for emotional and music is written to make people feel things aka emotions.
Mr Poopy Butthole sold out :(
[By this?](https://redd.it/6sy5ow)
It happens with all great things... people over saturate everything these days and just try be relevant by posting excessive amounts of things on the internet which eventually just desensitises people to the actual tv show because it has too much hype to be good and too many people jump on the bandwagon to watch shit. I'm really trying to stay with rick and morty but if people carry on posting as much as they do all the time eventually it will be bought by a large company and sold out...
Myself. The reasons why are endless.
I read a thing and Justin roiland hinted he was in the new season (season 3) but I'm not sure i hope so because I'm also a bit disappointed with the chase 
I'm already the one I hate
I will make a thread when it actually gets here and stuff i'll deffo keep you posted!
Thanks! It just looks kinda shady especially when its in a different language.
No thats my problem too. If you have chrome it auto translates to english
Well I'll wing it and buy it  and make a thread when it arrived its cheaper than anywhere sells it anyway and especially cheaper than anyones willing to ship it to me as I'm in the UK so shipping from the US is hard...
Woah then thats cool as fuck thanks!
Trust me you don't want to...
It's a drink which will eliminate sex changes and the whole term transgender as the change is permanent until you drink the drink again and change however you please and the religion thing some people believe the religion is in their soul (like trans people who think they're born the wrong gender) and this drink would give you the ability to have insight into less common known religions and feel how they feel. 
Yeah in the UK they're on the back of each seat its pretty cool how its such a wide used thing now tbh
And that is what I asked. I take it you're not the talkative type 
I mean theres that but that wasnt the first response that came to my mind hahaha
But would you?
I'm gunna start doing my wishlist on there so i can actually get my currency rather than Dollars lol. So thanks haha

An amazon wishlist! Hey thats a good idea especially for me as im in the uk and that popprice guide only had dollars!
9gag is not a joke 9gag is a way of life.
I can just see it now... :( good luck to you too we are gunna need it... hope you break your iFunny habit soon...
9gag's just as bad... hiddenlol if you have to browse a site i guess people should just stick to reddit...
Yeah I never got into iFunny because i just thought it was unfunny content where people was trying too hard to be relevant and funny but failing... Slowly but surely kids are coming into reddit and soon the front page off reddit will be full of people still laughing at harambe and pepe and calling each other doggos and puppers... when that day comes will be a sad day...
If you make a bootable USB drive can you load windows on a portable charging station? There is your answer...
Tbh the amount of iFunny cancer which spills into all parts of reddit is very common especially r/jokes and r/dankmemes they're ridiculous...
This is a thing in most places now I think. I know it's extremely common in the uk anyway most if not all buses have usb sockets and free wifi in the uk! They are also going green and having the buses electric too!
Did you just admit to browsing iFunny..?
I guess but still wanted to post to see 
Yeah thats true.
I mean I'm not asking to trade anything or sell or even buy Just think it could be quite interesting to see others' collections.

It's never happened to me before the whole of youtube is just shitty and broken these days.
There's no way for me to prove this i know but legit i was confused why i got such a long time to skip the ad
The thing is i didn't change the numbers at all like im being genuinely serious this isn't edited or even a joke i actually couldn't skip the ad and thought it was pretty cool...
