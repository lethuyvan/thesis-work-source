this + moving center channel up will hands down provide the biggest different.

It came down to cost/warranty and comfort for me. The Honda was slightly more expensive at the similar trim level (EX) and I felt it was fugly as hell inside.
Went to six flags a few years back, McDonald's at the next exit east had 3 working girls hanging out at the end of the drive thru.

People come to forums to discuss their problem, but here on Reddit especially they don't look first to see if it has already been posted
Have you ever picked something up at a Walmart store using their store pickup? Amazon shipping is literally faster than whatever clerk you get.
If you could "afford" this, you'd be paying it off straight up. If you're doing that.. awesome man.. you're gonna fix your credit soon. Keep up the good work.
> always make sure we can afford things before we make large purchases.

This is literally the opposite of buying with credit (unless you pay it off 100% each month and do it for whatever rewards)
If your credit is fucked, this is only hurting you more. Go get a best buy credit card.. or better yet.. stop buying things you can't afford. Sorry to be that guy, but the advice these guys are giving you is real.
> Therefore, multiple religions existing implies that most (all but one) are wrong.

speaker on top of main heat exhaust.. ballsy

R speaker tucked, for all practical purposes, behind the sub. 

Both L & R need to be pulled forward to be level with the center to give them a proper presence/soundfield. This also prevents reflections off the right sub.

Yep. North Chicago subirbs. Same as Alpharetta... Cobb..  similar high end  areas. Except here that extends beyond the high end snobbery of outsiders.

You can't refute what I stated, and are still making bad comparisons.


You're comparing NYC... And Gwinett? Even ignoring the weak argument the comparison is crazy. 

A chicago suburb of similar stature is full of 'black families'.. same with a NYC suburb.

When I moved to Georgia from the South, I was told which side of a dividing road in town I should live on (I'm white). I was constantly assumed to  be Christian and Republican and against blacks, because I'm white and male. My divorce lawyer, an ex state senator, fielded calls from the local GOP party about how to stop the blacks from getting more power.

Racism is ever present and palpable in the South. To deny otherwise is fooling yourself. Segregation remains at a visible scale.

Is it in every single neighborhood, no. But stop painting your broad strokes and misguided comparisons.

In Chicago no one gave a fuck.  
I still have no idea what you're getting at
"some like real neighborhood"?? What does that even mean?

And does Gwinett not have neighborhoods?
As someone who grew up in Chicago burbs... this guy is full of shit.

Gorgeous setup.. two questions

1. How's the center? I've been having a hell of a time getting a matching center without laying down the cash, and i'm worried that it is too small for my room anyway.

2. Why are the surrounds pointing toward the center of the room rather than the listening position (4 and 5 in a 5.1 are surrounds, and should be to the side of the listener pointed in towards them)

..so brave
Did Trump the brand ever give all employees (hotel, etc) a bonus like his beloved corporate shills?
The placement of those speakers & sub is absolute cringe
To add to his accurate comment.. Atmos is above.. so the 5 is your front, center, sides. 7 adds the two rears. .1 or.2 for your subs. Third octet, usually .2 or .4 are your above, ala Atmos.

Sometimes this is phrased as 9.1 or 11.1, depending on the brand, but that also can indicate (in most mid and higher end gear) that many of the later channels are "assignable" to whatever location you want them.
That's only a 5 minute walk if you have no legs 
Depth of speaker from wall is more important for speakers that have a rear port. It can help other speakers too, but 10"+ spacing like of they we're even with the front of an entertainment center (not touching, or square with!) should be plenty for most. Your 7'/9' spacing should be fairly decent.. just set the toe in to aim just passing your ears in the main listening position (slightly wider for a larger room/wider couch won't hurt too much)
sound stage. you want something roughly around an equilateral triangle in distance between the L/R and you. Results may vary by room/listener. Ultra high level... Too close and you don't get separation of sounds, too far and you don't get a connected sound.
Watched a bunch of youtubers at the park (Bobo, Seth, Singletrack, etc) and every one of them have stated how insanely steep it is. I look forward to getting my skills to that level and checking it out.

Yep, a chunk of the "2k 4k" releases look good. Just pointing out for OP who is looking for "reference", I tend to point people at the "real or fake" site just to get a better understanding of whats there. Its by no means a "dont buy" thing to me.
[Use this list to see what is really 4k](http://realorfake4k.com/list/). 

Yes, most of the movies in the "fake" category will also look really good, often a bit better than the 1080 release.. but you are asking for reference, and reference is full 4k to me.
The movie or the release?

* Shot on 35mm (some scenes 70mm)
* VFX Rendered in 4K and 5.6K
* Digital Intermediate at 4K
Only Blade Runner, Dunkirk and Allied are actually 4k from that list... for those that are nitpicky.

taking a step to the right, away from the ball, so that one could be run into. lul.

Not OP, but generally speaking, the events are well known enough around here to not need to link it every time.
timthetatman noticed the same.. a non-standard acceleration of subs, most by random new accounts
Ahh gotcha.. sorry I glossed over that.. yeah that might seem too good to be true

Lets be honest, while Atlanta has "good" and "bad" bbq places.. it is, relatively speaking, NOT a bbq town. It is mostly rehashed versions of other areas bbq specialties.

the usual... tv too high, speakers pointed straight... ;)

and even a nice jar (candle?) in front of the center channel
this should be top post. what the fuck is with the placement of the speakers?

While Eugene, OR has a few sights.. head to the coast from Salem and see the best part of the Oregon coast (Lincoln City to Florence). In fact, at Florence, head back to Eugene, then over to Bend and South to Crater Lake.. take the highway back out to the coast for the redwoods. Yes its a bit of a zig zag.. but you'll get way more out of the trip.
Yeah.. love the look.. but I wanted 4k.. decisions decisions.
Ahh gotcha, no worries. Just trying to help in my own weird way 
Disappointed in Coco and Three Billboards not having 4k steels.. even though they are 2k up.

The math and science academy high school is tied with Columbus High for #1 in the state on the annual US News & World Report rankings. I personally don't know anything about the rest of the district. I would venture a pre research guess that it is like most diverse districts, it has high and low quality schools.

Fuck, marry, kill. As they stand.
There are two canyon trails once you reach the bottom. Straight, and the more popular left. (Right is the hiking trail to the campsites.

This is near the end of the left trail, which has many small offshoots.
In general, no they don't need to be one in the same.. In this case..both are applicable.
I'm certain that people that post and people that read comments for suggestions are a VERY tiny overlap in this sub. So many posts with speakers pushed so far back.

That said, to be fair, speakers this little/bad.. it won't make much difference.
The "traveling to Tennessee from Georgia" pack is just SEE ROCK CITY x100
and 30 "vistors centers"
I bought my 55" 8 years ago.. i took it out of the box and marveled at the size. I put it on the big wall in the living room.. it felt tiny but still better than I had before with an old 32" Sony \Vega. ASs the years have gone by it has felt smaller and smaller. An 85" is calling me.. but I'm resisting so far... it isn't a game you can ever win. ;)
Its awesome man, wish more did
I love that this was mentioned before he even made it
Its kind of a dump.. and also where the deportation "holding area" (read: jail) is. Columbus will be your source of entertainment.. which, as a resident, isn't a whole lot unless you're a bar rat.
Showing the road and the tourist center :/
In the same way that gun CONTROL is a harsher term people should stop using in preference of something like gun regulation or gun access framework.
In Atlanta.. very close to the map location on your site. Interested in XG.. pm'ing
I was too conservative when I lived in Oregon and I'm too progressive for Georgia where I currently live. I fully support gun ownership and gun regulations. (Let's stop using the word control). It is not an uncommon position.
My Android auto tends to remember some music o was playing 3 months ago.. but not what I was playing when I was last in the car 10 minutes ago. To play the recent, I have to start it on my phone.

Not a Kia issue, but I digress.

I do wish my '17 Sorento EX had non-passthrough handles like my '16 optima had. I like to put things in that little pocket.. not have stuff fall through.

Yeah.. the hub has zero way of knowing what it is plugged into. That's a statement made by someone with a broken network.
This is what I'm getting at.. your statement has be baffled as to what else you'd use

Cmon man.
huh? what else would you plug the hub into? a hub?
Great video!!

 I knew this trail was familiar.. sure enough I had previously watched a [bcpov video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-XVkYuPCd0) on it

I think you replied to the wrong comment

have you ever called a walmart and tried to get a department on the phone?

they aren't a customer service company

Trash is trash.. it comes in all colors. No reason to expect one over another.
Fixed it . I had to go make sure that particular Chromecast was linked AND enabled to my account, and that it had a nickname. Weird.. but works like a champ.

..and no ability to communicate 3 desks over.. or listen to customer input
no and if you like sometimes shrill highs
WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT....

L/R are at a somewhat reasonable height... tv is slightly high but admitted he is testing .... TV isn't over the fireplace.. center is pulled to the front of the furniture....

This can't be /r/hometheater 
Food court in E does. A lot of the on concourse stops close far too early... Some even at 8... Many at 9.
..you didn't explain it either.
This is the common sense answer.. bit in reality many are fairly busy all through out the day as lots of unemployed people, people on 2nd/3rd shift, and stay at home parents workout during the "quieter" day hours
About time we got a new video from you ;)
then buy some equally basic pc speaker on ebay
Even at near field they are a bit close. Also.. they should be aimed around your head.. so either your speakers are too low or your monitor too high ;)

Congrats on the setup though

Give whatever music client you want to use (musicbee, etc) access to the library via a file share. So instead of loading files into it from your local D drive.. you load them from a mapped M drive.

My personal tip/preference.. always use read only shares for your media. I don't trust any client not to mangle my carefully tagged collection.
How dare someone who makes a living off of youtube put effort into his videos

Go off season for sure. I went during US Thanksgiving last year and it was pretty empty. Only thing that costs money outside of food/drink is entrance to the church at the top.

You do get a weird tourist sham vibe when you realize all the restaurants and hotel are the same company though.

Most of the ATL bike shops are good places and will help out anyone who enjoys the sport.

I've had great experiences at Atlanta Cyclery in Roswell, both bike shops out by Blankets Creek, and more.

All over Georgia.. Floridians away from home especially can't find the gas pedal to save their lives.

The overall higher average speed driven is one of the things I love about Georgia
I've never seen a Florida driver do more than the speed limit. Ever. They are always thinking they are still in Florida and that there's a state trooper over the next ridge. GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!!
yes, and the battery worse with each
I drive that part of I-285 around ATL all the time. Everyone squats the left lane. Its painful. No respect for keep right except to pass.
For some side entertainment, don't miss that [Magnus webcast](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh_L9snJoBo) from pitlane. Always good for a laugh, especially after hours.

No one is saying dead, settle down beavis. Purely to his own numbers, he has said so himself.
Understood. I think he got bored with the "trendy" games, went looking for something different and lost subs. That's no knock on him either. You gotta stay away from being bored.

Meanwhile, friends of his like Ninja have been climbing in views and subs heavily as they've adapted to the newest games.
Which is weird as his subcount has been struggling of late.

You didn't specify anything about age, interests, employment, area of town.

So we'll point to the sidebar for links on things to do, and you can find something that interests you and go say hi to strangers!
I'm with you.. just stating that too many these days only see polar opposites 
git r dumber! *diesel cloud*
They are building plenty of those ITP and OTP. Alpharetta, Chamblee, etc, etc.
To be fair, an urban growth boundary on the opposite side of the spectrum like Portland has, only introduces its own problems. Like most things, the answer lies in the middle.
The more time I spend in Atlanta the more I realize the drivers are a bulk of the problem. Selfishness, lack of awareness, not keeping right except to pass, etc. Chicago has more people and traffic/driving never felt so painful.
would buy again, 10/10.

Only complaint is the intermittent recognition of the stupid headphone dongle

In the world of shity blogs around the theme park industry, that "article" was particularly terrible
Good recommendations. I would remove smoke and Caffe Amici as I think both of those are terrible restaurants. But I would add other Mark Jones places like black cow. You could also add Chili Thai, or one of the plethora of casual Mexican restaurants if that's your thing.

I migrated to the pixel 2 xl from the S6. The battery life change alone is worth most of the cost to me. I absolutely see the blue tint off axis. I don't really use the phone off axis. The grain I don't see unless trying to.. and I have no burn in. I do wish the color profiles we're editable. I do feel that's coming. I am on the fence about returning it.. but I am leaning towards not.  Day to day this phone is fantastic. 

(My biggest complaints are Google launcher related.. but I can go back to Nova to fix those)
this happens to me everytime I open the app from scratch too.. now on a second phone doing it (S6 previously now P2XL)

The biggest weirdness for me is how it feels to type. The screen isn't as hard as gorilla glass phones I've had before.


i think if you have the first pixel, that's fairly good rationale for not upgrading given the current concerns.

I came from a Galaxy S***6*** - even if the screen was always blue on the 2XL .. it is an improvement. (It isn't by the way, I only see a blue tint on mine at pretty hefty angles that I *would never actually use my phone at anyway*

>This is why soccer will NEVER be a mainstream sport financially in the US. We don't like soft characters.

"This" refers to the act of diving/faking/simulating

>Someone hasn't seen the NBA

Where they do it as frequently as the Spanish or Mexican league...

So, its a mainstream sport... as you said, "big 4".. and it happens there. "Distance" is irrelevant.
You're thinking of baseball
Because reviewing every thing would ruin the flow of the game and you'd have a stop and go snoozefest.
Now go watch the NBA and I'll await your edit 
Soccer had always been physical.. it's well acknowledged.
Someone hasn't seen the NBA the last few years..

Correct, which isn't defined in the key. Information is, key.

Right.. that's why I don't understand this key at all. There is no definition of the origin city. What are the restrictions to define that?
