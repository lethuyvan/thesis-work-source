The thing that's hilarious about this is how half-assed it is. The Apollo program was the one that brought humans to the Moon. It has absolutely nothing to do with taking photographs of the ocean, and the last one was Apollo 17 in 1972. On top of that, calling it 33A5 makes even less sense because the Apollo missions were only ever names by a single number for each. If you're going to pull stuff out of your ass, at least do a Google search first.
Well, he wouldn't have survived if he'd stayed behind either.
Yeah, but /r/kidsarefuckingstupid is really bad. I thought it was light hearted while scrolling through the top posts, but then I started to see posts of young children getting seriously injured or maybe even risking their lives, and the comments were laughing at them for being stupid. Now I stay the hell away from that sub.

Am I the only one who thought for a moment that Thanos had died when he snapped?
I know I'm late, but I liked it. It was the one jaw-drop moment of the movie for me. It was so surprising that I don't even remember what happened immediately after. I just sat there with my mouth wide open wondering if it had really happened.
Popular opinion, but I don't
I don't believe any of this is based in reality, but I do think you've got some amazing thoughts. It's impressive how logical and creative you were while dreaming. You should write some more about this.
Damn I gotta get abducted

Yeah people like to say that here but as soon as they see something they disagree with they downvote it to hell.
Alright this does it for me. His Twitter is the epitome of /r/Im14AndThisIsDeep. This tweet doesn't make any sense.
This bothers me so much. Both definitions are correct. All it takes is a Google search of the word. I'm okay with people getting things wrong, and I'm okay with people correcting others, but when you get your corrections wrong that annoys me. When you want to correct someone, youve just plopped yourself in the smart guy chair, so you better get your stuff right. The least you can do is a quick Google search.
By saying switch, I'd meant swap the two words already in the sentence. I get the misunderstanding, though. Have a good day🌊
Dude are you serious? I suggested a change, and he said "thanks" and changed it. It originally said "I agree on Kanye with everything but this."

I'm in disbelief that so many people can't understand this.

Surprised he isn't following @realdonaldtrump
You may want to switch the words "on" and "with"
I think this has to be the first time he's ever learned Lincoln was a republican.
This was a huge disappointment
ok but why
never really know what you got til it's gone
I think what he's saying is that "love everyone" is too broad. A more focused or specific statement would be more effective at helping those who need help. Love directed at Trump or anyone who's well off is less well off than love for the unfortunate.

(Me interpreting melon's thoughts; not my ideas)
Completely agreed
I apologize for this.

Titan is a moon, not a planet.
My guess is he's referring to when he "saved" her

In the case of the reveal trailer, that's absolutely not true. We wait longer in between each new game than people do for CoD, so it's more of a hot topic. Few people want to talk about, rewatch, or watch YouTube videos on some new CoD reveal that basically just shows the new setting. People do this much more often for BF.

The Infinite Warfare reveal trailer has 17mil less views than the BF1 reveal. And Infinite Warfare has considerably more views than BO3, AW, and WWII because of the dislike hate train at the time. 
Yeah it is but that doesn't mean it's funny
Why am I nostalgic for a game I was never even a fan of? For some reason I love this game yet I never even liked this game.
dude isn't it hilarious and awesome when all the comments say some variation of "I'm not crying you're crying" or "who's chopping onions?" 

^^^^/s
The best thing to come out of this mess is the inspiring responses from others. Amazing from John Legend and Chance is fucking awesome as usual. I used to love chance for his music, but now I honestly think I'd be okay if he just never released any more songs (obviously I'd prefer if he did). I just hope he keeps up being active about the shit he cares about.
Tbf it's not even 8 on East coast and he's 3 hours behind

Nobody is acting like they were betrayed here. The OP is likely partially referring to Ye's tweet that says "I'm still the kid from the telethon." The post isn't even sharing an opinion on which is the right one. It's just using TLOP's "WHICH / ONE" to make a cool album cover.

Idk if I'd even be happy with that though. Then he fucked with everyone, intentionally manipulating feelings to sell albums. That'd be interesting considering he has been saying all the stuff about manipulation and love.

dog anyone can say they love everyone, it really doesn't mean anything. it's like saying you hate war or you want to end world hunger.

Edit: that's fucked I can't even defend it
Yeah, how the hell did this picture get out?
The way I see it, those who are bothered by the repost should downvote, and those who aren't familiar/don't care shouldn't. It's not that complicated, and I don't know why it's such an intense, constant argument on Reddit.

This would be awesome if it were a bit more organized. Some stuff like this already exists for specific products. For this case, say you need a game to play. You choose "Xbox One Action Games." You pay $30, and you have a chance of getting any products in the category ranging from $15 to $60. *Then you sit around for 3 days hyping yourself up until you somehow end up with a free to play game.*

#TWO SEPARATE ALBUMS CONFIRMED
Pretty sure it means [Pretty Huge Dick](https://genius.com/Kanye-west-breathe-in-breathe-out-lyrics)
probably rough spending so much money on specialized equipment, though
What would you say is the easiest way to find out what I like? I've really enjoyed some stuff in the past, but I have trouble finding new songs, albums, artists, genres. I have a few questions, just answer whichever you feel like/whatever might be important, please:

•Who are some of the more popular artists among serious electronic fans?

•Are there any albums that are so good I need to listen to?

•What platform is most often used (Spotify vs SoundCloud)?

•What genres should I be familiar with?

If it helps at all, I absolutely love Daft Punk's *Discovery.* Other than that, I've enjoyed some of what I believe is called electro-swing (sorry if that's embarrassingly wrong). I also really like chill stuff like [this](https://soundcloud.com/chloeburbank/you-suck-charlie-mastering). Im not necessarily looking for songs with big buildups and huge drops, though. I've listened to some other things, but it doesn't seem to me like I have one specific thing I'm dead set on finding.

Thank you so much, I've been looking for a way to get into this. Let me know if there's any more information I can give to help you out.

Edit: also a fan of [Resonance](https://open.spotify.com/track/1TuopWDIuDi1553081zvuU?si=aS6DlMMUTxOaQXc2KaulSQ).
Holy shit you people are never satisfied. You'd act like the fucking wheel was a bad product if you saw it here for the first time.
I'm not hating on any of the things. I'm ripping on people who think having different taste makes them superior.

Gives more weight to the ones you do rt
Lately, I've been spending a lot of time scrolling through /r/gaming comments sorted by controversial. Makes for much more meaningful discussion.
Kanye.
It's only 22 hours later, and Cole just dropped an album. Despite this, you are now wrong.
/r/KendrickLamar isnt that surprising but damn I didn't expect /r/FrankOcean. I'd guess it's because a good portion of the people here are subscribed to those two subs as well. It's like a nice little family.
Everyone needs to shut the fuck up with the Cole obsession it makes you look like little kids
i like this a lot.
/r/YouNotSeeingThisShit
Okay I agree that cole absolutely is not more popular than Kanye, but this is bad evidence. Those graphs are normalized. Notice how both go exactly to 100. It doesn't show the total amount of searches; it shows the percentages of the peaks for both of them. So Cole's graph could be showing average 5,000 searches a day, while Kanye's could be showing average 500 searches a day.

Try an uncommon term and it could appear to be more popular than "Kanye."
Well, maybe in his dreams
Interesting idea. I've been thinking the 7 songs must be significant somehow because he tweeted it (and before anything else).

I hope he does some kind of weird release. It seems like he has a lot more to tell us that he's keeping for now.
I honestly think this could be better than the real thing. Not ripping on them just saying this is fucking awesome.
I was on the toilet at home. I saw the "7 songs" tweet and I yelled and laughed and tossed my phone across the bathroom. A while later, I was sitting on the couch going through Twitter and /r/Kanye and /r/HHH. Surprisingly, I didn't mind only 7 songs to the album, but I would obviously like more. So when I read that Ye would be dropping a collab album with Cudi I lost it. 

Cudi + Kanye is my absolute favorite combo, and I hadnt expected it at all. I read it, screamed, and sprinted across my house. I hit the ground and just sat there smiling for a few minutes. Probably my highlight of the year so far.
Then listen to MOTM again. And again. And MOTM2. Again. Hope you enjoy.
Not saying you stole my ~~laptop you dirty motherfucker~~ idea at all, but I'd like to plug [my post](https://reddit.com/r/Kanye/comments/8dhq4m/this_is_the_dumbest_theory_ive_ever_thought_of/) from earlier with a similar concept.

^inb4 ^people ^reply ^with ^the ^originality ^tweets
Can I get a link? And does this include singles and features?
I disagree. This is genuinely funny. I don't really think it's unwavy.
Cudi + Ye is the best fucking combo though so I'm cool with that.

I much prefer it to Jay + Kanye. It's just less unique that way.
I enjoy this. Thank you mod(s?).

Great answer, thanks.
The article says there were dozens of these rocky protoplanets in the early days of the solar system, and this one in particular was nearly the size of Mars. So where did it all go? Obviously it went into forming the terrestrial planets, but it seems like there is way less material in our current planets than there would have been back then with dozens of smaller bodies. 

Or were most of these protoplanets much smaller than the one in the article?


Every time I see the notification I hype myself up in case of an album teaser. Im still not ever disappointed.

Then you gotta look for the planets, identify them, and throw accurate coordinates into a computer. It'd be better if there was a faster, more convenient system.
Yes, we know. We've all known for years. It would be impossible to miss with people like you doing us the service of reminding us on every thread, no matter how irrelevant it is. You truly are a hero.

Let me ask this: why is it so important? Soyuz is way cheaper and more reliable than anything NASA has for LEO, and we've got private stuff coming up like the Crew Dragon and the CST-100. So why should NASA dump money into making something that will definitely be less cost effective and possibly less reliable than its already existing options?
Dog if you don't like it go listen to their shit when it's out. It's not mutually exclusive. You're a Ye fan because he makes the best music. There's a price that comes with that.
It's great if they had fun, but people aren't complaining about that; they're complaining about the fact that it's here. Plenty of things can be enjoyable in person that I wouldn't expect other people to like.

Huh.
That's just so weird to me. We, and maybe anybody else can do absolutely nothing about how unbelievably big the universe is. Even if we spend thousands of years preparing and pooling our efforts (which we would absolutely not ever do), we still might not be able to get any people to far away places.
Is it in any way possible to shield from that? Or is just about anything going .9999c going to screw you up no matter what?
I believe the simple way of saying it is that, from the point of view of the passenger, everything outside of the ship in question would seem to have sped up time. You could spend a week on a spaceship going extremely fast and step out to find a year has passed on Earth.

Imagine a satellite going a good fraction of c. When it was created, it would flash a light once every 5 seconds. Now it's up in the sky (ignore where it's going or how it got so fast). People standing on Earth see a flash every 15 minutes. An astronaut hanging onto the satellite, going the same speed, sees a flash every 5 seconds. If there was somebody on Earth born at the same time as the astronaut, the astronaut is now younger than them.

Keep in mind I may be full of shit.
Dumb shits, I believe.
Yeah this dude is calling people pieces of shit for just having flaws.

Agreed. I'm not of the belief that Kanye is a superhuman that can effortlessly pull off whatever he wants. If I'm being honest, I don't even have much interest in reading a book about philosophy by him. And that's not because I have low expectations for it; it's because I don't have expectations for it. I've never seen him write a book before, so I can't possibly pretend to know what it will look like. If it's good, cool. If it's bad, it doesn't really mean much, but props to Ye for putting himself out there.

I wasn't around back then, so I find this perspective interesting. 
Is it? I'm not trying to argue with you; I'm genuinely curious. 

How do you define complicated? Because I understand that sts had to deal with new stuff like heat resistant ceramic tiles, gliding and landing, etc, but was it more complex than the Saturn V? Again, that's not a question I'm asking to make a point. I just find this interesting.
I was just there. It's the single greatest museum exhibit I've ever seen. Did you see the Challenger and Columbia memorial beneath it? Very touching stuff. They had a hallway with a memorial for each lost astronaut, which was followed by pieces from the wreckage of both disasters. The whole Atlantis area was extremely well presented. I haven't seen anyone talk about it, but I thought the Hubble model was really interesting, too. It might just be less popular because it's sort of tucked into the corner.
That's a simple quote, but I absolutely love it. I don't know why it gives me such a great feeling.
Being accustomed to the ISS, MIR seams really tiny and insignificant.
I really don't think that's a very unpopular opinion. 
That's one of the most badass space facts I've ever read. Absolute unit.
I just got a Saturn V set. It's amazing. 1969 pieces and 3 feet tall. I believe it's also made in a way that allows you to separate the stages.

Imagine the same thing but replace Kanye with someone who doesn't have a hate train after them. It would be all over the news

Yeah. I'd probably wonder a lot what it would have been like if I'd stayed on Earth, but it's not something I'd pass up. That'd probably be my second greatest goal, right after going to Mars and coming back.
Sounds good, pretty much exactly what I'd been trying to look for. I'll check sometime soon. 

I've been looking forward to this game because the world looks amazing. I've always loved playing in a game with a great world.
Oof. Definitely would have gotten it had I known. I'll keep an eye out for it now, though. Thanks.
Thanks, but I've already played them. Not looking for explicitly new games. I'm good with stuff up to 3 or 4 years old. Also I'd be alright with more expensive games, I just need to be confident in them first. 
Someone help me out Id like a good open world singleplayer action game, preferably $30 or less. Something that I can play a good amount. I've tried le witcherino; not a fan. I was thinking maybe AC Origins or Far Cry 5, but I'd rather not spend $60 unless I know it's what I want. 

I'm down for Switch, PC, or Xbox One. Even just discussion would be helpful. Thanks.

Yep. The shuttle program ended in 2011. Basically, we'd rather not keep killing people, and the orbiter is a lot of extra weight if you're doing nothing but transporting people, so it's excessively expensive. After Challenger and Columbia exploded, we had to keep using the other shuttles to finish the space station, though. Once it was done, we started using the much cheaper and safer Russian Soyuz rockets for getting astronauts to orbit. And now we've also got private companies doing resupply launches like SpaceX.

I agree, I'd love to visit more often if I could. Maybe I'll look at seeing some other space centers.
Oh God. I don't know this guy, but I'm assuming he committed some…less than holy sexual acts?
I don't know if it's necessarily fair to say that without ever having seen it in person. Although I do agree these pictures feel extremely lively and awesome. What I'm trying to say is it may be natural selection of photos. Photos like these exist of modern New York, but there are thousands of others that make them less notable. Over time, they'll stick out more, as I'd guess these old ones did. It's just that nobody cares about the more boring pictures of cities of the past.

Or I could be completely wrong. Someone who knows more than me about history, help me out here please.
See you later, space robro
im a fuckin dunce.

Edit: and I thought this couldn't be more embarrassing until I saw who you were. Love your photos dude.
I just went a week ago, and it was probably the highlight of the trip. The Saturn V was the most incredible space related thing I'd ever seen…for about an hour until I saw Atlantis. The exhibit was really well planned out. I loved the way you could see the shuttle from every angle. I just remember being blown away by the fact that I was standing almost close enough to touch something that had been in space only 7 years before. 

If anyone is thinking about going to KSC, absolutely do it. I can't think of any more enjoyable day or two at a tourist park.
[comment redacted, see *"im a fuckin dunce"*]
Agreed so much. Fucking tired of people being more bothered by someone they perceive as a bit of a douche than people that are legitimately fucking terrible people.
You know I'd usually call bullshit on a post like this, but I totally believe you.
Yes. At some point, you will absolutely dislike something. But I give you a 99% guarantee that you'd like it at some point. Just gotta listen to other stuff and give it time. 

I definitely recommend chronological, though. It starts out with music that everyone likes, then transitions into more risky, interesting territory. You gotta ease into it with some College Dropout and Late Registration. 

Good luck dude, have fun.
I'd flip my shit, but I wouldn't know what to say, because I know it's a huge pain in the ass for everyone to bother you everywhere you go. Although there are plenty of videos of HappYe responding to people who want to rap for him and stuff. Obviously he's sleeping here, but one of my great ideological struggles in life is what I'd say to Ye if I saw him on the streets. I've so far settled on something simple like "sup Kanye, how you doing?"
This post is terrible. /r/Gaming.
That's great, and I'm all for it. However, I'd like to point out that there are plenty of shows that make more episodes per time that have at least as high of quality as Rick and Morty

The thing that's great about this line is what it says. The media thinks he's crazy, that he doesn't have control over his own actions. In actuality, Ye says, they think he's crazy because he's not doing what the media wants him to do. They think he's crazy because he's not what they consider normal. And I think that's whack, Rick.

Ugh why the fuck does it have to be a constant binary love/hate around here? You can like some of what they do and dislike other stuff. Have a fucking mind of your own.
I haven't played the game yet, so I may be missing some context, but why would you care about pay to win in a singleplayer game? Generally, the problem with it is when it gives other players an advantage over you. I don't see any reason it would be wrong when there are no other players, though.
Am I the only one who doesn't like that (or at least doesn't get it)? It just seems shoehorned in and unnecessary. I don't feel like it adds anything, and it feels a bit out of place for his character.

Well by unpopular I mean not often discussed rather than hated on.
Unpopular opinion but the keys at the end of Only One are awesome.
Like when? I'm not saying I necessarily disagree 100%, but people always say this and a lot of what I see is just Kanye enjoying his own artistry. Paraphrasing Donald Glover: "Music is the one business where you're not supposed to enjoy your own work. Like, if you're a chef, you can make sandwiches for everyone, have a bite and say 'oh these are good.' But if you listen to your own music and say 'I love this song,' everyone thinks you're a douche."

I don't see why it's so bad to think highly of yourself when you're unarguably one of the most influential artists of your time. It's stupid to pretend otherwise just because you're supposed to.

How were you lied to?
God damn it I always come to these threads hoping someone will mention my town, and I always get *so close* but never quite there.
That’s not even remotely relevant. I am a human. You are a human. We are not observing this scenario from the POV of the photon. 
I’m not sure I understand what you’re saying. As others pointed out in the thread, all of the sunlight that reaches Earth is much older than any living person, but if we ignore that, then any sunlight you’ve ever seen left the sun ~8 minutes before you saw it. Which means, as long as you’re older than approx. 8 minutes, you should be older than any light you ever see (aside from that which comes from other stars).
But there’s a reason OP differentiated sunlight from everything else. People generally think of sunlight as some instantaneous thing that teleports magically straight from the sun. This shower thought is a creative way of reminding people that it’s really a constant beam of photons.
Yeah. Most of the posts here now are just everyday observations that I guess some people relate to. Stuff like “I wake up tired in the morning but have trouble falling asleep at night.” It’s nice to see a really good, original shower thought.
I’m struggling to find how you this is supposed to be relevant.

>We have won the battle, but remember, the war is far from over

This is one of the top 5 cringiest statements I’ve ever read or heard. It is excruciatingly painful to read that.
How do you feel about genocide?
I may be misinterpreting what you tried to say here, but if it’s what I think it is, I disagree. I’d much prefer it to be socially acceptable to wear more comfortable clothes in public or casual settings.

Someone has to make a TLOP cover that says this on it repeated
Ugh, why is everyone on Reddit such an elitist? He likes spending his money on iPhones; you like spending yours on food and shit or whatever. I honestly don’t care what, because I’m sure that you, like OP or any other human being on this planet, put time and thought into where your money goes to make sure you buy the things that you will enjoy the most. Just stop judging others for dumb stuff.
wym it’s from tlj 
I could say I know Morse, as I know each letter and could tap out or decode an easy, slow message. However, I’ve never used it in any practical context, and I could make absolutely no guess of what was going on there. Is it something that just becomes easier over time with more use?

Because European Redditors will use anything as an excuse to shit on the US. They say we’re intolerant, yet all they do is complain about how we live.
Ok that’s gross exaggeration shut the fuck up. I’m all for hating on shitty people for doing shitty things but this is such unbelievable hyperbole bullshit. You can tell that this isn’t real.

TLOP 

Late Registration

MDBTF

Graduation

Gotta say this is probably the most difficult Kanye-related list I’ve ever made. If you asked me the same question a week from now I could put it in a completely different order.
guys this was a joke why are you downvoting this
My bad. Seeing others saying that as well made me think they meant it.

I hate it when these random Redditors pretend to know more about a science than the professionals carrying out the project.
but that guy on facebook with a truck for a profile picture disproved global warming by showing me that snow exists
I’m never the kind of person to wish death on a show, but god I’m glad there is no more community. I loved the show, but finishing the last season was one of the worst TV experiences I’ve ever forced myself through.
Is this a joke? Assuming it isn’t, Doc cheated on his wife. I’ve never watched Doc before but it has kind of been everywhere.
well that doesn't make it clever
>I can look around til I see the glowing tracer rounds and know I'm getting shot at from the opposite direction.

Can you explain a little bit what you meant by this? Do you mean as they go through the air or once they've buried themselves?
TIL /u/FallenJoe is not funny.
I know I'm completely being *that guy,* but this would be artificial selection.
What's with the random **bolded** words **everywhere?** Also, why does it seem like only half of the comics posted to this sub actually have any sort of joke? The "joke" here is just 

>This part is super deep

>hahA interrupted your deep with a U SUCK!
Not only XD. "lmao XD." They figured the lmao wouldn't do it on its own. Although I figure they should have tossed in a 😂 just for good measure.
Thank you. I've always hated it how on TV shows the characters do something terrible, and then they freak out saying "everyone's gonna think I'm an asshole now!" Yes. They're going to think that because they saw you being an asshole. That's how it works. They did not misinterpret anything.
I hope I look that ~~good~~ not dead at 94.
>Response that is not hostile

>u mad bro??
Shit, what am I talking about? I rewatched Dreamland in the past 2 weeks, and he was a fairly prominent character.
[Dancing in the Moonlight](https://youtu.be/hMc8naeeSS8). I can never again be unhappy for as long as I live.
Alternatively, if you guys don't want to read through the responses here, go check out half the posts over at /r/GamingCirclejerk for the exact same answers.
I just recently started watching, and I remember at some point they make fun of Back to the Future making lame jokes about the time period, which was followed by a lame joke about the time period being shown about 2 mins later. 

I know, I did a terrible job of describing this. If someone could help me out, that'd be great.
Wait, was Ray completely absent in Dreamland? I hadn't even noticed until now.
These comments make it sound **REALLY REALLY** bad. For once, I'm going to listen to them. Can I get any sort of idea what kind of stuff it talks about without actually reading it? Like, where does it stand on a scale from 1 to Scrotie McBoogerBalls?

No clue how Late Registration goes with Sandy's house. 

I don't really know for TLOP…maybe something to do with Mr. Krabs/money?
I know you're saying it as a joke, but I really hope people don't start to rank Ye's kids.
So do you expect it to fall apart as the hook enters? Or when it begins to pull?
Considering how much you've put into responding to "triggered twelve year olds," I really do think it hurt your feelings to some degree. Also, it's interesting that you're calling everybody a twelve year old, yet you can't seem to type English past a 5th grade level.
I'm all for funny Trump jokes, but this is horrendously forced.

I strongly disagree. He seems to follow exactly the majority opinion.
Futurama, Rick and Morty, South Park, Community, Archer, Gravity Falls, The Orville, The Office, Parks and Rec, HIMYM, Stranger Things.

No particular order and I'm probably leaving some out.

I like a show with serial plot that maybe focuses on some serious stuff but has some comedy, too. I know, it's a fairly basic list; I figure if I enjoy what I'm watching, though, then it doesn't matter how unique it is.
Is this show worth watching? I've seen small portions without much interest. However, its fans seem to have similar taste to me.

Edit: these answers are awesome. I'm looking forward to watching it. After spending months finishing the entirety of South Park, I really need a new show.

It's really not clever at all. It's what the entire gif is built on; the trick with the can is just a jump cut.

We can see the title. You don't need to type that.
They did a good job of making that website look like it was made by someone who is inexperienced.
Yeah. I'm not trying to sound like a dick about it, though. It's cool that there's now such a mainstream game, even if it doesn't last too long. I do think it's a fun, well made game, but I just get tired of it pretty fast.
I feel like this is one of those quotes that tries so hard to sound deep, but if you actually think about it it doesn't make much sense. I understand that this is supposed to be saying he'd be caught off guard by unexpected tactics, but I really don't think that's true. It doesn't work that way with any other skill. Why would this be any different?
Haha dude we're kidding. It's not supposed to be a practical build, it's just for fun.

I liked it. I guess you're  probably being downvoted because people don't like self promotion, but I don't really mind it unless it's constant spamming of bad content. This was well-made, informative, and enjoyable. Thanks and good luck.
I didn't think he was bad here. He summed everything up in a simplified way, and he did a pretty good job of it for anyone who isn't a huge space enthusiast. Nothing was nonsensical, he didn't seem to be trying to impress anyone. Maybe the best footage I've seen of him speaking.
Imagine the following scenario. There's an active shooter killing anyone he sees. An unarmed man starts running at him. He gets shot. It's not good that he had to die, but he knew what he was doing, and the blame for his death is on him just as much as the gunman.
As a 16 year old kid, I completely agree. I shouldn't be able to play games where you run around shooting people.

There will probably be a lot who disagree, but I usually like games set in the future. I wasn't a fan of IW, but I loved BO3 and thought AW was fun, too. Regardless, I think people exaggerate the significance of setting in CoD games. I think the actual execution is a lot more important than setting. If future is what's necessary for fun and interesting innovation, I'm all for it.

Dude this is one of the most circle jerked comments on this website. How do people repeatedly see this in nearly the same context every time and keep upvoting it?
Eh, I've only been guilded twice (and on the same comment), but I enjoyed it. I can totally understand how some people think it's dumb or a waste of money, though. I see no problem with the system. Someone likes a comment, so they buy OP a little approval sticker for a few bucks. Reddit gets some money, and that means they won't have to gouge us for money in stupid ways in the future. I've never bought it myself, but maybe I'll do it sometime I really enjoy something.
How can I better identify various launchers? I'd love to know the strengths and weaknesses, visual differences, etc of the rockets used now and in the past. Are there any documentaries, YouTube series, or books I should be looking for? Thanks.

And anything ordinary they do is either them copying someone else or "Apple is incapable of innovating anymore."
For me that happens, but not because of the notch. I've noticed that the rounded corners are what makes it look so great.
That makes sense, but then you can't pretend to have a greater understanding of it than someone who has owned one. 
Because it's a different phone. An iPhone X with a notch has a greater display size than an iPhone X with a straight bezel. If a phone with a straight bezel had a notch instead with screen in the corners, it would have a higher screen to body ratio than without.
Yeah. Millions of these have been sold. Not sure why people think it's worth sharing this. It just clogs the sub full of useless garbage.

This is what I was trying to say. There have been times when I wanted to use a specific attachment on a specific gun, but I knew that I wasn't really able to focus on getting that attachment. I'd prefer a clear objective for every attachment. 
As much as I love BF4, its battlepack system is pretty awful. All I'm really hoping for in BF2018 is 
1) a little less rock paper scissors than in BF1
2) a solid progression system for weapons, gadgets, and attachments
I think if DICE gets those down, we could have a new legendary Battlefield game.

I trust them to do a good job regardless of whether they listen to this armchair developer's thoughts, though. Sometimes I even prefer when games aren't made how I would've done them, because it forces me to try something new in a world full of a lot of generic FPSs.
It would be tough for me because obviously I'd want to talk to him, but I've seen how some people constantly harass him, so I'd probably have to just do a quick "hey Kanye, huge fan."

Yeah. All of these people don’t understand the joke of the original sign, which is actually funny (despite the fact that it’s probably shopped). 
What the fuck is it with you people? Are you seriously that bothered by seeing someone tell a story about how they really enjoyed a game? 
Is it really though? Probably 90% of the viewership for any given Marvel movie is non-marvel fanatics.

Why does everyone here have their own made up weird reason? I’m surprised by how many people here hate on Cole without even knowing why. It’s because of False Prophets, not some random reason that has nothing to do with Ye.

This is very cool, but I don’t know if creativity is necessarily its strongest area.

>the lack of vr is why I haven’t touched my One S in months

So you’re saying that the only games that would be worth playing on Xbox would be VR games. You bought a console which was never likely to have VR support, yet you don’t want to use it for anything besides VR. 

Aside from that, I’d like you to reread what you just wrote.

>I’m not one of the clown desperate to count my console’s pixels…I can do that on my PC just fine.

>Anyone who does this thing is a clown. I am not one of them. Oh and btw I do this thing.

>You could drop a sail fish from the same height and it’d probably go just as fast.

Terminal velocity for a person is ~191 km/h. I’m not enough of a math expert to figure out the terminal velocity of a sailfish, but considering that they are usually <90kg, I’d assume they don’t have a much higher terminal velocity (although maybe they’re a bit more aerodynamic?). Even if it is considerably higher, chances are it’s not 320 km/h. 

Aside from that, I’d say the falcon is flying because it has control over what it’s doing, whereas obviously a skydiving fish would not.

I’m not trying to be a dick, so sorry if it sounds like it. I actually really liked your question.
Yeah, but yours is from a completely different song on a completely different album, and it has nothing to do with what he said.

Yeah, birds are way faster than fish, and fish have been swimming longer than birds have been flying.

Fastest aquatic animal is the sailfish - 110km/h

Fastest flying animal (and fastest animal on Earth) is the Peregrine Falcon - 320 km/h. They reach this only when they’re diving, but I don’t think that means it shouldn’t count.

Oof. Wouldn’t even die from impact.

>I feel Pt 2 is needed

I would have preferred if he made Father Stretch one song. That way people couldn’t complain that he just ripped a Desiigner verse for its own song. 
Do you mean /r/Rainbow6? I haven’t been there for a long time, but I don’t remember it being that bad. What happened?
Eh, there seems to be 80 or more islands. Considering you can spend probably 20-60 mins at each (please correct me if that’s not right, I didn’t play the beta), I’d say it isn’t too bad. After playing 80 separate islands, I probably wouldn’t remember if I replayed some, too. Some DLC is definitely necessary if they want people to play long term though.

Edit: As usual, getting downvoted for normal discussion. Stay classy, /r/gaming2.
You say that like people don’t enjoy PvP. Like anyone thinks PvP is a new revolutionary concept that you think is going to flop. Why? What makes you think that wanting PvP in this game is a bad thing?
That’s what this game needs. People could get bored of going to pretty much the same islands over and over. If we can get a map full of different mythical unexpected things, it would not only make it an extremely unique game, but it would keep people playing. Because “game where you play as pirates going around the sea gathering treasure” sounds pretty cool, but “game where you go around as pirates gathering treasure in a sea full of creepy unexplainable stuff” sounds cooler.

Edit: looking forward to playing the game, but I’d hope DLC is filled with some different stuff so people will be drawn to it.
To be fair, /r/XboxOne isn’t necessarily the best alternative for that. People downvote anything they disagree with.
It’s definitely good enough to search for something simple like that.
Butcher knife? 20 people before anyone could realize? Really? Even if I had a minute in public with a bunch of blindfolded people, I don’t know if I could do it. 

Back to the real scenario, I’d imagine killing someone with a butcher knife is fairly difficult. You have to get close to them, take out the knife, find a good place to strike, and hit it fairly accurately at a high speed. All of this without them noticing, and if you want to get anyone else, you have to make sure nobody sees or hears it while you have to remove the knife and the body falls to the ground. Then you have to run up on someone else, and this time you have to make sure nobody even glances in the general direction of the first victim. Repeat it 20 times? I doubt it. 

The only place I could really see this happening is at a concert or maybe a sporting event, where it’s loud and people are distracted. However, these all have good enough security to not let anyone in with a butcher knife in the first place.

I agree with a car, though. Other than that, I’m having trouble thinking of weapons that could work for this. Obviously, most people can murder a regular person if they want to (if they don’t mind being caught), and that’s terrible, but there’s not much we can do about it. The best we can hope for is leaving it at 1 or 2 instead of 5 or 20 or 100.
Can’t believe I’m not seeing more people saying this. People try so hard not to be racist on Reddit, that they end up being racist. [Seriously, look at this shit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/6ymniu/best_weatherman_ever_very_articulate_and/?st=JDP79WRM&sh=c2f976ba)

Jesus. Why does everyone always have to have something to complain about? 

1) Even if I had seen a clip like this before, this is still enjoyable to watch.

2) Can I get a link to the video that did this before this one?

3) It was Muselk’s friend, who was okay with it being used, and he gives him credit in the video.

Okay, I hadn’t included any, so you should be good. Since you haven’t heard of the others, I’d recommend checking out [Cuphead](https://youtu.be/4TjUPXAn2Rg). Probably my favorite Xbox exclusive so far, though I’m gonna have to wait and see what Sea of Thieves is like.
Guys why the fuck are you downvoting this? He’s just asking for help from Xbox users, which would seem like a primary function of this sub.

What kind of games are you looking for?

Halo: The Master Chief Collection is a good option if you’re an old time Halo fan or if you want a shooter to play with friends.

Halo 5 is pretty different from the older games, and it has very polarizing opinions, so you could give that a try, but do some research on it first.

Cuphead is a fairly difficult couch coop mainly boss focused game in the style of a 1930s cartoon. I’m sure you’ve heard plenty about the game already.

Sea of Thieves is an upcoming multiplayer game where you get to crew your own pirate ships and hunt for treasure. It is scheduled for release on March 20, but there is already lots of content up on YouTube. [This](https://youtu.be/WwJs7B-s14w) is the most informative video I’ve found on it. 

If you really think you’d like it, PUBG is definitely enough fun to make up for how broken it is. Surprisingly, it might be more fun solo than with friends sometimes.

If you’re into racing games, we’ve got Forza. I don’t really know much about this other than the fact that they get good reviews.

That’s really about it for relevant Xbox exclusives. It kind of sucks, but I certainly didn’t buy my Xbox for its exclusives. Let me know if you have any questions.

Edit: Gears, too.
>I’ve been playing Doom for about a week. I’ve known for a while the textures in that game are pretty bad.

Did I read that right? Or were you referring to RE7 there?
Not me personally, but many people do it for prerelease content like betas. Although it sounds counterintuitive, sometimes it makes sense to preorder when you’re unsure of whether you want a game. If you like what you play in the beta, you’ll leave the preorder. If not, you can cancel it.

No. Not even a little bit. What does that even mean?
Battlefront 2. It isn’t mindblowingly incredible, but it is fun. You can pick it up for $30 at a lot of places now. If it wasn’t for the Reddit hate train, it probably would have gotten okay ratings. People make fun of the single player, but it’s at least more engaging than an average CoD SP (not that that’s a super high standard). 

Don’t buy this game if you’re content with the games you have. If you’re looking for something to keep you busy for a while, however, this is not a horrible choice.

I was not specific enough in my post.

I like redstone a lot, but mostly right now I’m looking for survival/building related stuff. I used to use a lot of mods, but now I’m pretty much always vanilla, although I’d love to look into simple graphical or QOL mods, along with some resource packs and custom maps (preferably some that would be good with 2+ players). 

I’ll give a quick request because I’m not making this easy. 

•Survival YouTubers that don’t yell all the time and are creative with building (if it helps, I used to love watching MindCrack guys like bdoubleo, generikb, etho, but I’m not sure what kind of options that leaves me)

•Some way I could look through the most popular maps of the past few years (I remember using minecraftforums in the past)

Again, thanks.
Super helpful, thanks a bunch man. 
Makes sense for the bouncier, more cartoonish style of this game, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t really damn impressive.
That makes sense. I loved it, though. Sprinting, new biomes, hunger, more items, experience, they all added to the game imo. I like the hunger system, though I can understand how it could feel like a chore. I’d call 1.8 and 1.0 the peak of Minecraft for me. Not that I think nothing good was added afterwards; I just enjoyed it the most at that time. There was so much exciting stuff for me to mess around with, but it didn’t feel too confusing to figure out. 
I always loved [this quote.](https://youtu.be/C7qcFCTa1vw) I’m in a good place right now, though, and I know that so I can appreciate the fact that I’m living in another chapter of “the good old days” of my life. I recommend trying this to anyone reading, because in the future you’re not going to care if you stubbed your toe or got a B- on a test. You’re just going to remember the good memories, so don’t worry so much about the annoying bits.
No problem, thanks for reading.
Just knowing that you liked it is good. There’s no point in wasting money when you already said that.
This is seriously the funniest thing I’ve seen in 2018. Thank you so much.
Fun fact: no single user here makes up the entirety of Reddit.
Come on, don’t blame it on the kids. Minecraft is about as perfect as a game can get for a kid. It encourages so much creativity and problem solving, and there’s nothing too inappropriate. The kids may have fed some issues, but they really don’t know any better. Obviously, many of the YouTubers from then gave the game a pretty terrible image. I don’t really think Minecraft would still be going strong without their influence, though. 

*WARNING: the following is just a bunch of nostalgic rambling with little to nothing to do with your comment.*

There was a server a few years ago called MindCrack with a handpicked roster of youtubers that were awesome at building, redstone, etc. If it sounds nerdy…well, that’s pretty much because it was. But I loved to watch it, because it was crazy what kind of stuff these people could pull off. It really sort of felt like they were all living in an area together conjuring up parts of their imagination. Eventually, as most of the people who I’d played with broke their computers, stopped playing, etc, I started playing other games. I hadn’t made some definite commitment to never play Minecraft again, but I was playing less and less. 

Later, I find out that MindCrack sort of broke up because of some disagreements. This is when the game pretty much died for me. Sometimes, I think I’d want to go back and rewatch a bunch of the old videos, but I’m not sure whether that’d be too empty feeling. Excuse this gross exaggeration: it’d be like watching old videos of someone who had passed away. If I could choose three games to resurrect, I would pick Minecraft three times. I still play in creative with one of my old friends from time to time, but we’ve never really reopened anything like the survival worlds we had made trying as hard as possible to imitate what they did on MindCrack. 

I still remember getting on the computer every day to check if the Adventure Update (1.8) had come out. 

If Minecraft never makes any kind of comeback, I hope I at least get a chance to play a game like it. Not saying I want a new sandbox or anything; I want a game where you really feel like your character can do things. I know that sounds really stupid, but lately most games have left me feeling like I’m just touring around some tech demo (another gross exaggeration). The ability to not only press a button to build thing X, but instead to honestly feel like you can do whatever you want is awesome, and doing it with friends makes you feel a bit more connected than in less interactive games. 

I know I’m jerking the shit out of Minecraft right now, so let me go ahead and say a couple things:

1) I love recent games. I think the past year or two have been awesome for gaming. I just haven’t found a game that I think I would be willing to play for 5+ years.

2) My excuse for this post is that I’m tired and excessively nostalgic from reading through this thread. I understand probably 0 people read through what I said, but that’s alright because I needed to write out what I was thinking, almost like a diary on a public internet thread. If you did read through the whole thing, thank you and congratulations on knowing me better than 99.999999% of the world’s population.
I’m not trying to sound like some circlejerking asshole, but I just threw on Sweden then read your comment, and it made me feel really happy. I gotta get my old Minecraft buddies together for a new world. It’s the one game I’d hope to still be playing ten years from now.
