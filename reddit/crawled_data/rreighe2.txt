Sounds like a plan to me. I love snow and I am a child of the night. I'll be fine with eternal darkness once a year. Vit-D pills beeyach. 
It took me 2 solid weeks of downloading GTA V and updating it. granted, i had to take the computer offline so that my brother could play his games, but still... 2 weeks... and it used HALF of our monthly fucking bandwidth. 
We're 200feet from the city and goddamn suddenlink and at&t (those bitchasses) wont lay a goddamn cable for the neighborhood of mobile homes and a few brick houses around here. We are inches away from being able to get 150mbps DL, and yet here we are stuck with 600KB/s. it's so stupid. 
man... you must be a super duper early adopter, because 4k still isn't really extremely affordable yet- and also most people aren't filming in 8k on a regular basis yet. :( I'm sad now. I don't even have a 4k screen. 

apparently there are also "HD Projector screens" and "4k projector screens" why? 
I was told, by someone who did makeup for a film we did a few years ago, that it is a fine enough makeup so that you can not see the powders on an HD camera. Apparently there would be a 4k makeup or some other name it would go by that would allow you to get super close up to it on a 4k+ camera without there being makeup particles that are super visable. 

but idk... i dont do makeup.

But Moore's law kinda might get in the way of that. 
Definitely not a first gen. 
kinda talking out of my ass, but i think it's because lower frequencies require so much more power to vibrate a cone than higher frequencies. I'd like to know the real reason why though. might go look that up. 
Ideally, you'd have a tweeter for high pitched sounds, then a mid sized woofer for your.... mid range sounds. then you'd get a sub for your... sublevel frequencies. now, if you wanna go absolutely nuts, get an [infrasub](https://www.soundandvision.com/content/bag-end-infrasub-12-powered-subwoofer) to have super-low frequncies being pushed at you. 

So you'd kinda split it into more than one speaker if you want the best best sound. 
Sure! 

I made an oops. Anything that is 100% mine you can use. I'm sorry. Unofficial remixes and mashups aren't enough of mine  to give away. So I'd you use my mashups or remixes, it'll be at your own risk.

I wanted to tie in a sarcastic "classic sjw's attempt at antibullying" with the fact that the dog is a pitbull, and then maybe throw in some [mr worlwhy](https://www.google.com/search?biw=2013&bih=1114&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=OIPkWvLmHoLAjwTKjLaIDg&q=pitbull+rapper+mr+whirlwhy&oq=pitbull+rapper+mr+whirlwhy&gs_l=psy-ab.3...6015.8157.0.8290.3.3.0.0.0.0.96.175.2.2.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..1.0.0....0.DX5H5d-hP34), but everyone hates my jokes and i'm to tired to try anyways. 

so basically it as going to combine the dog from OP, a pitbull, with the artist name Pitbull, with SJW anti-bullying bullshit. a triple pun. i suck at life.. 
yeah.... it kinda had me worried. 
HOLY SHIT IT"S THE DEMIGORGAN 
be careful with promoting to family and friends. don't burn them out like I did with my music. But then again... you gotta start somewhere /u/SupremeBaller. Just don't hammer them to watch your stuff. 

also, someday, once your stuff gets some views- collaborate. cross pollination of views is a great way to share fans. 


dude, if you want an actual banner, and cant do it yourself, and you want to be custom- you're gonna have to drop a dollar. 

have you EVEN seen /u/xSTONERx's stuff? It'd be worth it if you actually gave a shit and didn't want to fuck over someone who's put years into their craft. 

or you just want everything handed to you? Jesus... he even said "affordable" which means "just fucking hire me i want work and i'll (probably) negotiate" like dude.. a talented artist offers themselves to you and is willing to not charge you your whole life savings and you tell them no. maybe you shouldn't have a banner. 

what? you gonna "promote" them and give them "exposure" to the.... how many people watch your youtube channel? you have a million subs? half? a quarter? an eighth of a million subs? unless you're getting 20k views a day, i dont think free is worth it. and evn then.. you'd think that by that point you'd realize you're gonna have to spend a little to get a little.

that's his work. 


well. i figured it out. 

deleting/uninstalling it didn't do anything because steam just reinstalled the version that was last used- IE the shit version with the mods. and fuck you assblast420 for being so cynical. I dont give a shit about your opinion on who you think modded the game. I really, fucking, don't. I'm not a dumbass that would waste money on a game on a thing that wouldn't benefit me at all in the real world- IE the only thing that would happen from modding is getting banned and wasting the money you spent on a game. but apparently no one gives a shit and it's always the account owner that gets in trouble. Had I known that i wouldn't have let anyone ever use my game. 

Well.. I had him look through the install folders and delete all of his goddamn mods. 

like none of that mattered because he got me fucking permanently banned. 

to anyone searching this on google... don't change your game... and don't let others use your game. make them buy it themselves and use it on their own shit. 
Nah. Don't think so. 

It's not gonna "kill" a Tesla. By killing I mean rendering it off the market. They just not gonna happen. It might give it some good competition and eat away at sales but it wot kill it. Short of bankrupting the whole company, nah. Not gonna happen.

"nobody take the wheel. nobody take it from my hands. We apparetnly cant do it on our own. the whole worlds letting go, we dont have a chance. we can't do it-- not at all. no one take the wheel!"

is it a form of fucked up marketing?

Why are you such a piece of shit?
Yes they are. They use 50% the amount of carbon for an equivalent distance as gas and desil powered vehicles. 

They also are future proof because as we get rid of shitty coal power plants, the power electric vehicles use will get cleaner too. So there's the immediate 50% reduction PLUS the level of how clean the electricity you get is PLUS the changing power grid energy sources.

> CHANG: The calls have gotten so aggravating to Pai, he is doubling down and making the fight against spoofers a top priority for the FCC. Robocalls and telemarketers are the No. 1 complaint the agency gets from the public. New technology has made spoofing easier to do and harder to detect. Last year, people received about 2.5 billion robocalls every month. It got hugely lucrative for scam artists.

>PAI: These call centers that were uncovered in India just last year, for instance, were generating something like $150,000 every single day from American consumers who, upon receiving a call purporting to be from the IRS, were, naturally, scared - especially if they were elderly, or recent immigrants and the like - and were forking over money, even if they didn't owe it.

>CHANG: So this spring, the FCC started investigating ways to let phone carriers block calls from spoofers.

>Why aren't carriers already blocking spoof calls? Can you tell when calls are getting spoofed?

>PAI: A few different reasons - one was, under the FCC's rules, carriers were obligated to patch through any calls that they got.


I hope they fix this shit. I'm tired of sms and the current calling standards. It needs to be updated and more reasonable 
Fuck that dude. He must be too much of a dumb ass and brainless twat to realize that these calls are spoofing other peoples numbers. Fuck, it's not even that difficult. 

Plus, can you even find someone's address by their cell number? Sounds like that Navy seals copypasta. "I can find your cellphone number in over 300 different ways" yeah... I'm sure

Idk if that'll help him out not, but it has made some stuff a bit easier for me to get.

Someone should make a "realistic finances" sub where people are rational and yet somewhat conservative with their money, but will some sense of humanity in them.

That sucks. So much. How's he doing sense then? 
That makes me said. Playing music and writing it seems to be the only thing that gets me through the day or week. It might not help me financially, but it helps me not kill myself from going absolutely mad. /r/personalfinance suggested I "sell all my crap" but then I'd have nothing to live for. I'd be a  useless piece of shit at a useless job serving no purpose for the world. And I'm pretty good. I think I have a real chance at making $50k a year from music someday if I keep grinding it. I've been making friends that are pretty helpful and I try and help them as often as I can. Life without music for me would not be a life at all. I just couldn't do it.

Variance Within. i'm everywhere! 

http://varianceiwthin.com and you can find anything that has to do with me or my music and branch out from there based on the things you use! 

I still use presets and i think using them and samples (from splice or whatever) are perfectly fine. I just think that the elements that define the song, the elements that are the main focus should be in some way yours. also keep in mind that sound design isn't just limited to synth settings. there is also global automation (so automation that is your DAW telling a VST to change it's settings - think filter sweeps, or changing the wetness of a reverb, or a HighPass_Filter slowly removing bass during a build up right before a drop)- basically things that change large chunks of a track or Submix BUS. Sound design can also be combining elements of many different tracks and selecting EQ portions or whatever and combining them into a SUBmix BUS that then becomes it's own track that gets fed into the MAIN SUBmix bus.... if that makes sense.

There's also post processing, which is adding additional shit to a track's chain AFTER the VST or Sample or *insert thing you recorded* - which includes... literally anything. You can use effects to MIX or to SHAPE the tonality of a track (they're kinda the same thing, but the difference is intent. MIXING effects are using to shape the tracks so that they all combine together into one cohesive picture without being a shitty mess of nonsense. SHAPING effects are generally the same effects as mixing, but used BEFORE the Mixing Effects. Their purpose is to create the exact sound you're looking for without much regard to the mix as a whole. (think GTR distortion, phasing, unreasionable MB compression, hi/lo passes to build effect or emotion. those aren't being used to create a cohesive mix, those are used to create an effect or emotion by morphing the track or tracks)). But the actual effects used for MIXING or SHAPING are the exact same effects. so the only separator between those two are what your intending on doing by using these effects. a MB compressor could be used to help a track sit better within the mix, or it could be used to morph the track into something that sounds more like you want it to be.

Your mixing/mastering is pretty good. Could you a little more punch, but that's just taste.

It sounds really copy pasted. like, really copy pasted. there's no tension and release. 

Don't stop working on this song. experiment with: 

turning parts of this song into a verse, parts of it into a build up/riser, and then parts of it into a drop. Your theme is great and shouldn't be abandoned for your next project. 

It's okay to use presets. I use them too... but you need SOMETHING that isn't a preset. What I like to do when I'm not good at building a particular sound from scratch is 1) look up tuts, and 2) alter presets, use the presets as a building block to get you to something unique and original. 

Also, don't skimp on arrangement or theory, EVER. no matter if you do a genre that isn't known for amazing theory (cough cough future bass, trap, or dubstep), don't ever skimp on learning theory. KNOW what chords you're using. and don't just click D, A, G,  on your piano roll. maybe throw in a D + E an octave higher and make it a sus chord. know what scale you're using. If you're in C major, try sharping every F (to make them all F#), then dropping everything down a half step.  i'm not telling you what to do in this song. just telling you that music theory is extremely important. I'd say it's more important than sound design. trust me, the more you learn it, the cooler stuff you'll be able to do while writing the song part of the song. 

also, dont skimp on sound design. 

you've focused a lot on mixing and mastering and layering it's showing. 

now focus on: 

1. *theory,* primarily alternative scales and modes (like harmonic minor, harm major, or wierd ones like Whole Tone or Mixolydian scales. it'll give your songs a foundation that immediately is different than 90% of EDM out there, which is primarily Am and F(M) [Sauce](https://www.edmprod.com/beatport-analysis/). 
2. *arrangement* Know what's best for your song. How long is the intro, the verse, the drop. do you want to omit or add arrangement elements to your song? Do you want to combine different arrangement parts of a song? lately a lot of people have been combining the drop with a chorus, or a drop with a hook, but that might not be for you. but who knows. 
3. sound design. 


What's odd is there could be some logic to his post. 

The stuff has been hidden for forever, but as soon as it's excavated, it risks being destroyed by natural or man made calamity. 

I'm being totally serious. 

That 2000 year old mummy that is in a museum might be wiped out in a nuclear blast or something. 

It would be totally fine underground. 

Even doubly so for above ground artifcacts that have to be carefully monitored with precision temperature and humidity measurements. Fuck up that area, then be unable to retrieve it for whatever reason, and maybe the internet gets destroyed (or at least the servers that the information about said artifcact's information were stored in) and you've got yourself a lost artifact that future generations might not be able to know about. 
Oh ok. It just sounded way too good to be someones first go.

So in actuality it's your first **completed** song. But not your first time attempting something.

this type of campaign requires selflessness, and requires "don't be a douche by only pasting "your stupid link" and not putting in further effort. 

I absolutely think there should be a spotify playlist, and apple music playlist, and google play all access, and youtube, and... and ... etc.

I'll be more specific next time. I'm looking for you to post stuff that you made, not slushii and artists that are already hugely successful. I'm looking for artists that are quite unknown or barely/almost making it. 
Rules: 

1. must not be older than 2 months. 
2. no mashups
3. if you post more than one, i'll pick the one i like the most. 
4. if I add your song, please share the playlist link to your socials. I can't really force you to do that, but if I add you it's in good faith that you'll hold up your part of the agreement. (bonus points for proof of posting!) 
5. don't post other people's music. if you didn't write it/remix it/or manage it, dont post it lol. just your own songs, or versions of songs.

wtf free speech isn't overrated. 
Deadmou5 too. 
Oh god you're right. 
They'll drop him as quickly as they dropped bush, and the next guy. 
If everyone thinks (A) is going to win and nobody votes for (A) because all of (A)'s fans think (B) has zero chance, then nobody will vote for (A) and that will lead to (B) winning instead. :/
This just gets better and better

lol history channel. 

Next on Picket Pokers! how the aliems convinced hillary to loose the race so that america can have big big problems! 
Dan Carlin said (i dont remember where, i think it was on one of the joe rogan podcasts) that you don't really realize that you're going through a huge historical moment. it kinda just happens. the real history comes into play once the puzzle pieces have been put together and you can see the whole thing, and how it played out, in hindsight. 
just replace the crying laughing with a cough! 
Baby you're a little vibe, baby you're a little vibe reader

Yeah that's what you are

You play it off a little unconsenting but baby you're a heart stealer

And right here in this bus

Its like you didn't know that smile was gonna melt me down

Its like you didn't know those lips are what I'm needing right now

And girl when you say 'NO NO NO! stop it! I'm just your fan, I dont want to have sex with you! I just wanted to see loud shows and get drunk with my friends! 

Yeah its like your reading my vibe
"it" being people started talking about it. 

"happened in the last 48 hours" being the public news about it. 
That sounds like the same thing Tesla is doing. They're not keeping much if any of the profits, they're churning out researching and developing also. but people keep saying "nah uh! they're not profitable!" 
no kidding. should we delete him from our dj libraries? 
but everybody came out alive, right? 
Import song into DAW, 

Analize song with native BPM finder or melodyne. 

Set daw to have songs click track. 

Create click track, line it up with song and with the length of song. 

Import song and click to NLE stacked on top of each other. 

Mute song unless you need it for reference. Use click when just trying to get the beats down. Test it with the song every once in a while for dumb shit or to make sure the mood still matches. 

Hopefully you won't be super sick of this song. 

Just make sure the click perfectly matches the song in both your daw and your NLE.

Oh. Yeah. You're right. If they're going for Ultimate realism then that'd make more sense for them to have hearing consequences from gun shots. 
I'll try that!

Edit: wasn't that. Although some of them really helped my kicks but it wasn't what I was looking for. 

E2: yeah I don't think they're waves plugins. 
lots of ear plugs too. I think it's too much to ask for. I'm fine with it being at -0db alone with trucks, loud music, or explosions etc. There's also cool tricks with compression, saturation, and other neat tricks to make it be  perceived to be louder than it really is. 

plus, all the people that are already complaining about too much dynamics (so tired of them) will complain even more than they already do. (the ones who complain about having to turn up and down a picture while it's playing)
it wasn't an orange amp- i dont think. it was just a plugin that was primarily orange looking.

edit2: starting to think it isn't Waves 
People don't realize how much an influencer can get paid. I totally believe both the $3500 and the $15000 because both are easily possible. 
He was tired of being a doggo. He wanted to be a kitter. 
But that gets into mixing and mastering. It's really bad to have too much dynamics in a film. you want the dialogue to be at a comfortable volume, then everything around it needs to be estimated. Google says that talking is about 60db, and a pistol is about 160db. you're not gonna have a 100db difference in a film. you might have 20-30db in dynamics- TOPS. Then you have everything else that you need to mix in to create, what is top importance, is emotional response. 
HELL YES. 
yes, that's bad too. but that's a different conversation for a different time. that's the whole fucking point of a whataboutism. 
wtf. I'm sorry that happened.. that's horrible. 
You Sly entrepreneur you
Fuck that. What happened to the dude that got ran over?

is there a plugin that combines vocoder with serum? 

Basically, instead of vocoding a sound, is there something that you can do serum + many other synths with these options (things like bend +/-, flip, sync- but mainly the FM from (other oscillator) or AM from other oscillator, but with a stream of audio from another channel instead of an oscillator? 

Like, take serum and where one of the oscillator is, replace it with an input from another channel. So that instead of getting a single waveform, you get whatever the heck is in that other channel as either your carrier or source for FM/AM synthesizing. 

does anything like that exist? 
Edit. I deleted my link because I didn't like the video.

You're in for it son. 

I used to be a soundman for my old church. I wouldn't mind doing it again.

Maybe I'm going against the grain, but I've turned off notifications for almost everything except for threads I replied in, it tags, etc. And I don't get anything like this. 

Maybe start disabling notifications on things you don't give a shit about... It'll take a while but you can eventually get like 70% content with the notifications you get. 

I also hardly get game requests. I just block the whole game and all notifications once I receive any type of game invite. 

If I join a group and I see too many posts of it on my feed, I unfollow the group and disable all notifications.

I dont know about people calling trump Hitler. 

But it honestly is both sides fighting to silence the other side. That fox news lady that turbo to silence LeBron James.  Both sides need to stop this shit. We need to try and open up dialogue. 

I really do that that the NRA is too powerful, but there needs to be a line drawn on what's kicking it down and what's limiting free speech. 

This is literally the plan of the Soviets, to tear the nation apart from the inside out. That's why the Russians are spending adds to get us to rally against each other. It's why Russia is pro trump and anti trump at the same time. 

We really need to come together again.

We need some modern moral anchor that can maybe reign in this absurd swinging back and forth that's going on. Something that works for today, but could be adopted by religious folk along with non-religious folks. 
I got banned from facebook today. Somebody reported me for harassment and bullying when all i did was call them an asshole... for being a condescending asshole. then they reported me and now I can't get on there. 

the point of that, is there was a discussion about the NRA, the Tide Pod not challenge challenge, and a few other things. The guy jumped in on the conversation and then reported me when he didn't like what I had to say. 

It kind of makes me less likely to even say what I think though because I have goals, and I can't get banned from social media, because those goals kinda require my engagement on there. But I so damn want to do my part and try and learn and teach via the internet.

That makes a ton of sense. 

What I'm aiming to do is make a future bass (trap nation) drop, but with screaming vocals, and with a real guitar. But I feel like just having a guitar would be too different from what people connect with, so I'm gonna have a layer for a supersaw underneath it. 

I needed a second opinion on it's tonality because it would be wired if I layered it with the wrong (or totally different) style of synth. 
That sounds about right. if you use a fuzz pedal, it's literally crushing the sound into a square. I think you're right.

It is quite ambitious, BUT, it is possible because:

1. launching those things will be dirt cheep compaired to lauching the geosynchronous sats that stay up there for 30 years. 
2. the same company that has the sats has the tools to launch it. so when some are ready, they can basically just set up a launch and go (of course not excluding the crazy stuff involved in launches). 
3. the rockets can land themselves, so one rocket can take a LOT more into space.
4. as the tech gets better, both the rocket launching, and the sats will become more capable and efficient. So once you reach a bottleneck, you will have high odds of overcoming that bottleneck pretty quickly. 

it is pretty damn ambitous, but also somewhat possible. but then again all you'd have to do is serve [The other half of people who don't even have internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Internet_usage), and convert some from the internet we have today.

Skydrive vs British Sky Broadcasting Group (BSkyB). 

One was an online CLoud service, the other was a broadcasting company. completely different fields, yet the UK ruled for Skydrive to be renamed.

edit; oh, someone already beat me to the Skydrive case.

He understands the algorithm (at least way more than anyone else at a creative level) and has enough data to talk about it. Sure, you might hate his clickbaity thumbnails (big whoop) or his voice (so? How fucking shallow can you get?)

We are one block out of City limits and yet we get no uverse no Suddenlink. All we can get is shitty rise broadband. I don't think at&t or SL are any better for companies, but 10% of 24Mb/s is much better than 10% of 730KB/S. We only get about 10-40% of the speed were paying for. It takes 30+ minutes to upload a WAV file and 4 hours to upload a 3m video on YouTube.

I'm trying to think of how to get rid of lobbying. because one you'd have to write up a solid af deal, then get enough votes. 

but the moment that the lobbyists will get wind of it, every bit of their focus will turn to taking down your bill. 

so then you're going to have to have a big budget for lobbying them one last time- but if you include retroactive clauses then you too will be in trouble, for your lobbying to get this *needed* bill into a vote.... but then again, you'll have to pay them big bucks compared to everyone else because the other lobbyists will argue to them "if you take the deal with ____ then you wont get paid any more" or something. 

I'm caught in this delima and that's as far as I've gotten trying to come up with a solution for getting politicians who love bribes to enact a bill that disallows bribes.

That last sentence was uncalled for.  I don't think I'm right and everyone is wrong. I'm searching for the right answer but I defend what I think I know, but not too the death. If my idea doesn't hold up then I consider changing it. 

A few things you pointed out that I didn't know we're the music channels buying fake views on top *of* the real views they're already getting. That makes sense.  If you're at 250,000 views you might as well double it. People won't notice the engagement rate being about 1/2 of what it should be. 

I'm not arguing out of ego. I'm arguing to see what I have learned and tested that holds up and what doesn't match and needs to be rethought or tried in a new way. 

E1: at least for me, right now, I'm staying FAR away from fake views and likes because those would do me far more harm than good. 
I might be partially wrong, but I'm not completely wrong. 

Is real engagement not WAY MORE valuable than fake followings? 
Just because a lot of people (likely not the majority as far as fake likes and follows) do that, doesn't make what I'm saying false. 

Real customers are 100000x more valuable than a fake like orna million fake likes. 

A million fake likes are worthless if you're not gonna make any money off of the thing you're actually trying to do. Anyone worth their salt is going to push for real followers because real followers means actual people that can see your product. 


Nah people look at that and don't pay you if you're using bots. Bots are for an ego boost or for scamming people. An informed marketer is going to have a good idea if they're using bots or not. 

If you have 1,000,000 followers but are only getting 200 likes on your posts then you're probably full of shit. 
/r/assholedesign ?
Lol. No of course there will be a ton of people with large fanbases that post about it just because they legitimately enjoyed it and want to support the filmmakers. Of course... But IF they did influencer marketing for it, some of them WILL be paid. More than likely meme pages, fitness, topical pages or insta models will be the main targets for the Cloverfield marketers.... Of course that's only true if they are going with that route. 

Edit: aaand what did I say that was so wrong or bad? 
You could put in the work to become an influencer, or purchase an account. Some of them get bought and sold like a business. But you won't be buying one that revolves around a particular person or band. 

If you can build up a real audience with real people then you could start charging for posts, even with as little as 10k followers. You'll probably only make a tiny amount but it's better than nothing. 

Hashtags. Hashtaggies. Hashtags. Become the hashtag slinging slasher. It puts  your post on the top of the Instagram hashtag feed for a brief moment. So if you put a ton of relevant hashtags, then it momentarily puts you at the top of a ton of hashtag feeds. That's the purpose of them. You'll get a follower here and there if the actual post is okay, but if you're a sexy person then you'll get a fuck ton, like 5-15 followers. I showed my friend this yesterday and he was getting about 45 likes on his stuff and gained 10 followers, and probably half of them are real people. The other half will unfollow after a couple of weeks, but that's fine because if you post 2-3 times a day of insterestinf (or sexy) stuff you'll grow a lot. There is also sites that you can pay for shoutouts. That's what I'm going to try for my music is 12-24 hr shoutouts. 
Keep an eye out for social media accounts with 100,000- a few million followers posting stuff about it today and this week. They'll almost certainly be paid to post it. 
That second paragraph would be  a pretty funny way to twist it.

>Congratulations, you have worked in two relatively small spaces that probably change their setup once a decade and probably have decently well optimized systems. hmu when you do some actually sound engineering.

well what have you done that makes you feel like you can shit on my experience? 

>TRAINED ACTORS DON'T MUMBLE

but luke and linus aren't trained actors, don't have a vocal coach (as far as i know). so i wouldn't expect them to articulate like someone professional like.... stephen colbert. 

>a company that can't even register a domain or keep an active facebook page.

were going through a branding transition. so what. we've been focusing on our craft, and now that it's at a level worth sharing with the world we're working on branding and marketing now. I dont think you're very good at judging character, or you just want a fight. 

again, wtf have you done that's so goddamn great. 

>Just open youtube videos from a handful of different creators and you'll hear the volume difference.

http://productionadvice.co.uk/stats-for-nerds/

>Youtube does however do a ton of file compression that causes a loss of quality.

why are you talking about file size compression? i'm talking about dynamics. bit rate compression is different than audio volume compression. 

>Look at the fucking knobs. On the first compressor, they're all set roughly midline. What it comes down to is their volume varies way too fucking much and no amount of live unmanned processing can fix that.

yes. it. can. and no amount of compression matters if the ratio is set too close to 1:1, and no amount of outboard gear will matter jack shit if the threshold is lower than the audio coming in. and apparently the audio isn't coming in hot enough, and the ratio isn't set to crush it hard enough, or else we wouldn't be having the dynamics problems were having. it doesn't matter where the knobs are at if the damn signal isn't getting changed any/enough. 

>I'll say 3 problems that audiences introduce. 

that's getting a bit off topic and has zilch to do with linus' podcast. I'm aware of those problems, but yeah I haven't really been doing live sound lately so those things aren't really on my mind. I think you do want an argument, because you say you don't want an argument yet you keep coming back. 

>Straight vocals don't work that way. The one sound is the whole context.

yes in the podcast, but i was talking about the stephen colbert subject when i was talking about context. and in a podcast, being able to hear the damn thing at a consistent level is more important, i think, then a little mic bleed or background noise etc. 

>The goal of live audio is a natural sounding voice. 

yes, live audio.. live as in being there in person where you can see the actual physical person. but dude, even shows that i've gone to the mixers the engineers are using have compressors and are tweaking the different tracks. even sound =/= unnatural sounding. you sound very anti-doing **anything** to change the raw audio source. 

>Noise isn't natural. Especially in voices. The same fucking goes for obvious compression.

again... priorities. you want your audience to hear you, or do you want them to think "wow, some parts are *really quiet* and other parts made my ears hurt because the difference in audio is so great, that i have to keep turning up and down the volume of the device i'm listening on" I have no confidence in you picking the right answer. 

>BTW, you didn't even use the right kind of compressor for vocals. Multi-band compressors work a hell of a lot better.

i dont like using multiband compressors on vocals. never did. I tried it and i don't like how it sounds. I prefer even compression for the whole thing. I EQ before the compressor. 

yeah... fuck SSL boards who use whole band compression... /s

>I'm done with this argument.

oh please... you can't help yourself. you **have** to be right. 

>You don't know enough to be interesting to argue with.

nah
lets breakdown what you replied with. 

> Have you ever worked with live sound?

yes. for a church of 200 people for about 2 years, and i assisted the engineer at a church of about 1500 people for a year. I've helped set up the stage, and micing, and mixing for both places. I'm haven't done it as long as you but... it's not a *completely different beast*. it **is** a different beast, but you're over exaggerating a quite a bit on how different they are. 

>Part of an actor's training is voice and diction.

no duh. And even though they can be trained to carry their voices more evenly, their voices will STILL need to be compressed, in order to sound it's maximum best, before going to a TV, Youtube, or any non-live medium. Just like you gotta compress tracks for the Kick, snare, guitar, piano, keyboard, etc etc etc. 

>Don't even fucking pretend that your 12 years of remixing EDM includes knowledge of acting.

I'm not giving you my whole resume. But yes, I do have experience with [actors and film production](https://www.facebook.com/ingressmovie/?ref=br_rs). As far as I understand it, youtube is only normalizing videos. 

>Here's [LTT's video of them](https://i.imgur.com/h67SNvb.jpg) setting up their compressor with FocusRite's help

ok. that's good to know. I didn't know they had installed it yet. they must have it set to a really soft compression ratio because there *still is* a lot of difference in their quiet and loud speaking. I'll eat my words on them not having a compressor and reliable hardware setup, but not on the audio being compressed enough. 

>An amateur with horrible mixing is inaudible.

not sure what you're saying? you can definitely hear when someone sucks at mixing.... is that what you're saying? 

>Stephen Colbert without processing (meaning standing next to him and listening) sounds better than Stephen Colbert with processing

no shit. never would have guessed. who'da thought hearing someone in real life sounds better than on TV or headphones? 

>because audiences fuck audio

by what definition? by clapping too loud? any mixer worth his salt is going to be okay with a little mic bleed. you'll never get a pure signal. it's okay for the snare to bleed into the kick, it's okay for the audience to bleed into the lead vocals, or stephen in this case. it does make the mixing a little more tricky, and it does mean you're probably constantly watching the compression settings for said vocals, but it's by no means "fucking the audio." 

>and every piece of equipment that undoes that fucking fucks it a little bit.

I dont think the goal is to "undo that fucking." the goal is to get a good clean mix. and i'm not quite sure what your definition of "fucking the audio" is, but as I understand it, mixing is shaping the audio from the different tracks so they sound pleasing once combined. all that shaping *changes* the audio, but it doesn't necessarily "fuck" the audio up. And as Pensado has said in a few of his videos (that I can't find) sometimes you have to overdo a specific effect, which would make it sound bad by itself, but it sounds so much better in context of the whole track. and sometimes you have to under-do an effect, for the same reason. 

>Compression doesn't increase amplitude. To make their mumbling audible you'd have to crank the gain and heavily compress it.

yes i know how compression works, thank you for the lesson. 

>That would massively increase the signal to noise ratio and unless you really, really knew your shit the compression would be way too obvious (aka sound like shit).

1. noise isn't bad. if it were, then those world class engineers working on Waves plugins wouldn't add a "noise" option to their tape, tube, and other analog sims. Noise, much like timbre, is a choice of taste. noise, in and of itself, isn't bad. 
2. obvious compression isn't bad either. there is a point where you can be like "wtf dude turn that down, you're crushing it too much" but if you don't limit it below where the main meat of the signal is, you're probably okay. But being able to *hear* the compression isn't a bad thing. if you have a trained ear you can hear compression, and guesstimate about how hard they crushed the track, or how much they let the track breath. 

>pull up the WAN show audio in your DAW of choice and fix it.

[you can see that there is way too much dynamics just by looking at the waveform](https://i.imgur.com/39uDu5o.jpg) those peaks are really different. The highest peaks are clipping at about 1+ Digital DB, and the normal volume just before it was at -10Db. that's a really huge difference. Then later on they're slightly normal at about -8db. but their peaks are incredibly *too much*.

Here is my chain, [IMG](https://i.imgur.com/0DbU8Hn.jpg) and you can see that there is a lot more consistency in the mix. [here is the track frozen](https://i.imgur.com/1CGEZ7v.jpg). see how it's a lot more even? yes, their room is a bit noisy, but you can now actually hear luke's mumbling, but now you don't blow out your ears from him first mumbling at  -20 to -10, and then within a moment, clipping at 1+. that's a HUGE difference in volume. I'll admit, I probably went a little overboard with compression, and their room being noisy doesn't help it. but at least you can set it and forget it, and that's my wish, is that if I listen to a podcast, i'll be able to hear luke's quiet mumbling and not go deaf as he laughs *reallllly* loudly. 

[HERE is the final video with compressed audio](https://youtu.be/QEgMGPhU52I)

[here is uncompressed audio for comparison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrpoQWiQlrQ&feature=youtu.be)

edit: a few typos

edit 2: the best way for there to not be noise, is to get a microphone that you'd eat when using. have two mics, one for luke, and one for linus, they talk really close to their own microphones, essentially pressing the mic to their chins. that means that their vocals will be wayyyyy louder than the noise of the room, and that would be the way to solve the noise problem, and the high reverb problem. you could compress it to hell and it would still sound good and clean.

Couple questions; 

1. How close is the mic to your mouth? Can you link the mic in a store so I can take a look at it? 
2. How close is the mic in relation to the keyboard? Like is it just as far away from your mouth that it is from the keyboard? Or are you eating the mic relative to the mic's distance from the keyboard?
2. How loud is your keyboard? Is it like hollow and acting like an acoustic guitar, amplifying the sound? Or is it generally pretty quiet? 
3. Are you timid and shy or loud and powerful? 
4. What are you doing that you don't want to hear keyboard typing? 
5. Can you use plugins to help your audio be more refined? 

I was watching tested Today and you're right. They are pretty consistent in dynamics. My mistake

Did you even read my post? The type of compression I'm talking about has literally zilch to do with your viewing platform. It has NOTHING to do with who vs who, it has nothing to do with being a trained showman or a chill tech guy. 

Stephen volume is consistent because there are people mixing him properly. If you heard his audio without processing he'd sound, production wise, just as bad an amateur that is mixed horribly. He's mixed by world class mixers who do precision EQ and compress and probably analog warming etc. 

Typical Redditor thinks they know what they're talking about.

Forget that I've gotten so used to Fab filters pligins, and about 15 of Wave's plugins (mainly SSL board), forget that I spent the last year focusing almost exclusively on learning how to do ANALOG via VST simulators (primarily waves plugins). You wanna know where I'm at? Go to http://Variancewithin.com and tell me I know nothing about recording or mixing or compression. I know I'm not world class or Grammy level, but I DO know what the fuck I am talking about and I know it at least moderately well. 

And... You loose dynamics but dynamics don't equal fidelity. Its "audiophile" nonsense. Less dynamics are better when you have to constantly turn the volume up and down in a 20 minute span. 
They're all alone all alone in a time of need. 
That's really sad. They really do need help with their audio. That's beyond a rookie mistake 
Edit : I was pretty mean. Sorry. 

1. That's good
2. Do what you want but I don't think you have a good deal. If you can't be creative enough to know what to give away and what to charge for then that's your problem. I was giving you ideas to fucking make more money. 
3. It doesn't take a lot of time to look at those FREE websites that I just posted. Your deal isn't a good deal. Those free websites have info on thousands of labels for hundreds of genres. You gotta offer more than that and charge on something else or you're a fucking scam. 
4. I didn't say that the artist was supposed to send one generic email. In my idea, You'd be the one that's sending those emails. So if you only come up with one generic email then that's just you being lazy. And that was only one business idea that I was fucking giving you because the POINT of number 4 was that you are offering a shitty deal and I was trying to brain storm with you on how to make your fucking ten dollars. 

Apparently you're immature or have an ego sky high and can't take suggestions or critisism because you spent more time defending your shitty expensive website than trying to WORK WITH ME on ideas on how to make your shitty website and shitty products better, especially considering I'm the only fucking person that bothered to reply to you. 
Edit: I see now that they *have* a compressor... but in my breakdown down below, I show that they aren't making good use of it. They have 20db differences in their audio. it's a bit too much. 

I'm talking about dynamics. Not anything else. And I am 99% sure they are not. The absolutly do not sound like there is any sort of compression going on. Dude literally every song is compressed,, every professional radio station it TV station is compressed. Ever wonder why you don't have to keep turning the volume up and down when watching Stephen Colbert?

my explanation and breakdown of the audio in the podcast: https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/7u6kcb/why_doesnt_linus_and_luke_compress_dynamics_their/dtnr897/
1. website formatting is really awkward. (win10 chrome) 
2. that's really expensive for just a list. there are websites like [allrecordlabels](http://www.allrecordlabels.com/db/genres/Dubstep.html) and [Labelbase](https://labelsbase.net/search) who have thousands and thousands of labels. FOR FREE.
3. i'm not paying $10 for something I can get for free.
4. you could try and ask for 10 bucks if you automatically sent them really good emails, and all the artist had to do was send a link and input data about their project and band. BUT, there is also Drop Track, demo box, and others. 

youre gonna have to do something different to make this more appealing of an offer... 


no that one is real. 
film me hanging from a tree i'm going in! 
Ok so you're talking on an episode by episode basis. I disagree still though. I think that they should compress their mics quite a bit. 
Occasionally too loud is a problem with it being too dynamic. They're essentially the same thing. If you have to adjust your volume to hear better or because it's too loud, then it's WAY too dynamic, movies excluded. 

That wouldn't work extremely well because tested has a mixer (ok the table) that gets mixed down to 2 channels that go into the (camera?). In order to make it sound the absolute best, you don't wanna compress the master channel, you want to compress each individual channel that way when each person is talking over each person you can hear everyone mostly equally. If you compress the master channel, then the loudest wins. Not good for debates and just general talking over. If you were to compress the master, you'd want something realllllly soft with like a 2:1, or a maximizer just to bring it up to around -3db, or a hard limiter so it doesn't clip. 
Linus, if you use software, you'll likely be even later to the podcast because of software issues. If you use hardware it'll just work more often

EDIT: [I broke down the audio in my daw and did work on it in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinusTechTips/comments/7u6kcb/why_doesnt_linus_and_luke_compress_dynamics_their/dtnr897/)

Go put 10 mints in your mouth than drink some water. The cooler the water the better
Have you ever put 20-30 mints in your mouth at once, (took me about 10 minutes to chew on them) I couldn't drink water for so many hours, even though I tried, it just fucking hurt. I was so thirsty. 3/10 nope. 
I might have to try that. I usually don't use more than the take editor. 


I want more lengthy talks with mkdbhd4d3d3d.  
I think y'all just have some shitty friends. 

Maybe find better friends or communicate with them better to see if maybe they are better friends. 

If you can have fun with a group of people without alcohol, then having fun with loud music and alcohol (of it's y'all's things, can make it more fun). 

You kinda have to have a care for them and they for you beforehand. 

Anyone partying to do it to be cool is doing it wrong. The music, social networking, friend making, and alcohol is the center of a party.  

And sometimes it just takes  relaxing and chilling the heck out. 

But hey if parties aren't your thing it's no big deal. But there are frnds who do either non-alcoholic parties, or friends who hang out and just so happen to include alcohol. 

But yeah... Don't do it to be cool.

Wow. I did not know that aspect of history. They should have just waited it out. Oh how hindsight is 20/20. 
I'm not sure. When should I call them multitracks and when should I call them stems? 

Nvm. Found the answer: http://duc.avid.com/showthread.php?t=363338

> Stem: is a file containing a submix of (usually) "like" elements such as 12 individual drum tracks being sub mixed down to a stereo file, with all the associated processing to make them sound more or less complete. Maybe it's drums and percussion, or even so far as drums and bass being called rhythm section stem. Or all guitar tracks for a song being sub mixed together into a stereo file labeled Gtr Stem. You get the idea. 

>Multitrack: These are the original tracks from the recording session and they usually have one "element" per track. i.e. Kick In, Kick Out, SnTop, SnBot, Hat, Ride, Bass DI, Bass Mic, Gtr-57, Lead Gtr-R121, etc. Of course it is possible that if multiple mics were bussed to one track that there could be more than one element on a track of a multitrack. I do this with gtrs sometimes... multiple mics bussed to a track to create 1 sound. This is still a multitrack because it was done "live" during the recording sessio

Just keep trying to hang out with people. I was just like that. Still not entirely sure how I got better. I still am pretty awkward, but at least I can keep a conversation going, usually. Sometimes silence isn't bad. Sometimes it is. But you won't really learn those subtle cues instantly. It's ok to be awkward. Just don't give up. Consiously take note of "oh they didn't like that" then maybe don't think about it too much. Just let your subconscious figure it out. And he'll, don't just find one group of people. Like say if you're only hanging out with Hicks, try hanging out with other people that like rock or pop or edm or whatever. (extrapolate the music genre into any style of people, like engineers or blue collar people.) Etc. 
5-11 the fridge is still pretty tall for me.

Don't play or read for either of those isntumrnts. So I can't give you the technicals, but here's a spreadsheet I found from Google that could hopefully help you some.

E1: A hard way would be to just test it. Get a clari and oboe player sitting next to each other and test notes, but oboe uses concert pitch, so you could also just test a clari next to a piano, or a guitar tuner. Might be easier. 

E2: But then again, thing about that chart, it says oboe is concert, and when you are playing concert 1, then the oboe is playing it's D if I read that correct. A b c d e.... So you might have to go UP one whole step. But of course test it first.
How come song songs can have "bad notes" in them (I would use "bad notes" as a sub category of accidentals) and it sound so damn good. Like in the song Mist by Sizzlebird, it sounds like the vocalist goes off key on some words, but it still works and sounds super good. But it doesn't sound like she's doing notes that would normally be used for key changing. I'm sorry I don't have any more examples. Maybe I'm imagining it. Is there a trick to allowing and making "bad notes" work in your piece? 
No half measures

I wouldnt do the text rolling down unless it was just a few sentences here and there. No paragraphs. Its much more tasteful to just show what happens than telling what happens. You don't need 30 minutes of real footage, even the most patient of people will walk out of the theatre. 1 - 3 minutes max with mostly snippets and a soundtrack.

Just a little sliver of ice around lake Summerville. Nothing exciting. Apparently it was snowing in CS. 
Or super proper. 
People down here really don't know how to drive in ice. 
You got me... I've got no idea. 
The last time it snowed we let our little pooper go out and run around. Within about 30 seconds he noped the fuck out and ran back inside. It was pretty hilarious.

Don't you have to pretty much eat constantly though to not be hungry when on a vegan diet? And if you do full ketogenic you can go longer periods without eating full meals. But I don't know the solution. I barely even know this problem. 
I've lived in Central Texas for 26 years (except for 11 months once) and I've only seen snow once every 2-3 years. 
But then you'd only have vegitarians left and I don't think that'd be good for the farm problem. 
Anocdotally the only couples I know of that haven't slept in the same bed / room haven't lasted or ended up hating each other. 

How does that work where you're happily married but don't sleep in the same room? That's odd to me. 
I don't. It depends on you and what you want to do. All I'm doing right now is doubling my meat portions and eating a little less of other stuff like veggies. But even that is helping me just a tiny bit. Just look it up and see if it'll work for you or if it won't.

Why are all the good aspects of chrome disabled by default
I don't think so. Not at a glance. 

Like GTA / Fallout / Witcher style animations and dialogue. With mild violence (aka bullies beat you up and maybe you eventually at a higher level can defend yourself from the bullies). Or you could be the bully if you wanted. Somewhat grounded in reality. Open map. Both adults and kids. Deep heart wrenching story. Lots of side quests. Cause trouble in school or be the good kid. Ride bikes steal bikes. Things would have somewhat grounded outcomes, both negative and positive.

What if there was a hood/neighborhood rpg? Just doing kid things? Maybe get into a little trouble here and there. 
Knees week?
What are your thoughts about actual stories beyond just the POV of the player? 
Me too. Me too. I gave up on them a long time ago.  I miss a good story. Hell, even an online co-op story is better than the same match 10000 times with only slightly different changes each time. 
I've toyed with that idea before. Just couldn't come up with an idea to make the dialogue not cheesy. Do they speak English? I hate movies where dogs speak English to each other. But if one were to record actual  vocals of many different animals, we'd 1. Not know what's going on in the story (ie go get _____) or (go help ___). That's an aspect I haven't found an answer to. :( 
What if there was an animal RPG that took place in a neighborhood and slightly in the country. You'd be a a lower level in back yards, then you move to the inner city for medium levels and then out in the country parts of the map would be higher level because you'd have to defend yourself and others against wolves and other high level animals.
