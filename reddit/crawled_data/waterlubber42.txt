That's another possible thing. What I heard was as follows:

NIPS is:

So NIPS might be the right one.
The blinking light in the elevator is perhaps morse code, it might translate to `DEA` and then another letter that I don't recognize.
It probably wouldn't, and most likely isn't, but if you've tried everything else it might be that.
Are your steppers skipping steps? If this isn't a problem with firmware (which it very well might be) it could be some funny buisiness going on with the stepper drives. You might want to replace the RAMPS hardware or even just use an Uno and Teacup or something just to test the steppers

I've seen errors ranging from cello fingering, to notes requiring a C extension to play (usually when the cello part is copied over with little changes, although this can be intentional depending on the piece)

Good bass writing would be more aware of the range of the instrument and how it is usually played, and in pieces with fingering would have that done correctly.
I have no alt, and have been using this account for three years. I don't think you're proving your point.

Keep in mind that this is not going to impact Rat operations. It's more of a sentimental/symbolic thing (i.e salt mining.) Mostly, any rats that are set up in Fuelum will have to move stations and transfer ships out.

Perhaps have the loss go up drastically when healing ships of similar or larger shield size. That way I can heal up my little buddies in a hazres (I try to get my friends into the game, and bounty hunting is a great early game cash maker) without worrying about my own shields
Yeah, honestly, I don't see much of a problem with this. 

If FDev wanted to do a fair nerf without affecting much else, have healing beams either:

1. Produce way more heat when the targets shields are full
2. Have a 30 or 60 second max operation time before an individual cooldown period
That's true

Don't betray; you get a red flair and nobody will trust you
I still can't join circles. "Something went wrong."
Something went wrong.
I would. Sadly, I might not be able to as of know -- the "something went wrong" has been hitting me really hard.
I'd love to know. I have like 20 circle's passwords but can't join any of them.

RIP :(
I'll join yours, but I'll have to see a solid background before I share my key. Sorry.
? Betrayers are **red**, blue means I've joined at least one circle and gray means you've joined no circles.

The first number is amount of people in your circle, the second is the number of circles you've joined. It takes about 5 to 10 minutes for it to update.

No, I think that means it's been betrayed D:

No, 3 were in yours, joined 5, and betrayed one
3 are in my circle, I have joined 3 circles (I've joined more, it's still updating)
Your flair speaks otherwise.
This guy probably betrayed you, that or the other red flair dude
Don't lie, the red shows up if you've betrayed...wow, 3 people

No way it's betrayed this quickly :(

Okay, so if you get someone to "Join" your circle you get another electron. If you get betrayed your circle dies?
You can't log into multiplayer servers without an account though (unless said servers had account verification disabled)
I think you can download mods without the game but I'm not 100%.

It really is non intrusive though, since the only parts that require an online connection are the ones that are online anyway

Indeed. I'm currently trying to convince Reika to add more debugging stuff into ReaC, which is far harder than actually building the reactor. It's for the common good.

I personally, as someone with virtually no memory, use OBS. YMMV.
Be careful using Sentinalh's tutorials. I know him pretty well; while the reactor setups are correct (the way to hook up CO2/Hot CO2/exchanger) the reactor designs themselves aren't very great -- Reika frequently changes the code of RoC to make popular designs on the internet break.
Progression gating is probably the most fun way to do it, the least fun way being spending hours in a crafting table or forcing exploration (modded chunk gen != fun)

Not all the time. But heating the lens in your eye can cause cataracts
Actually, if the microwaves were just hitting his hand it wouldn't be that bad. It just heats it up and your body can easily deal with heat.

If it hit your eyes or head, however, you'd get cataracts pretty quickly. The eyes can't cool themselves.

Yeah, this is very weird as it only start occuring recently. I wonder if my install is missing a font package that only discord uses
No.

The way information is encoded on a cell signal (like CDMA, GSM, etc.) is far too complicated for a brain to decipher. It's encrypted, too, which makes it impossible to decipher.

Sorry to burst your bubble.
I'm probably going to end up reinstalling a new distro.

I set up this Debian installation ages ago and have upgraded it too many times. 

Update: This issue doesn't occur on the web version. Only on the desktop version.
Interesting! Zooming in slightly mitigated it. Thanks.

Edit: It didn't completely fix it, but it looks a little more tolerable.
can we get some [*hyperspace](/hyperspace) flair?

I have the exact same issue as you. 

1. Installed with the exact same guide on Debian 9. It broke Steam because Steam is stupid (needs 32 bit libraries). I decided to then upgrade to Debian 10 to get the full newest mesa versions

Before upgrading, I ran a make uninstall on the compiled mesa and then reinstalled the older version through package managers, unpinned any packages and ran a full-upgrade. 

I also installed steam, and I think that's what broke it.

libgl1-mesa-glx is version 17 for me though.

I'm posting this message from that machine, although I haven't fixed it. I just replaced "amdgpu" in Xorg.conf with "fbdev" which uses an alternate, shitty rendering path (I know very little about it). No acceleration but my screen works.

Edit 1:
my `dmesg` https://pastebin.com/XdzwtpvD   
my `xorg.log` https://pastebin.com/BWSWhBSs   
another log: https://pastebin.com/0CbutS88

Edit 2: I solved it! You need to download AMD's drivers (example here: https://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/Radeon-Software-for-Linux-Release-Notes.aspx)   

Modify the install script `amdgpu-install` so it doesn't check the distro, then run it. It fixed it for me. YMMV, make sure to read apt's output in case it tries to do something stupid.

Even better, create an alias that runs this and opens a terminal with `cmatrix`, `nmap`, and `fsv`.

I think the one Cody is planning on building is a [fusor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusor), which uses inertial electrostatic confinement. If he manages to build an inertial confinement or magnetic confinement reactor, on his own, he should apply for a Nobel Prize.

Still, fusors are super awesome and have a handful of uses (such as making neutrons for medical or science applications)

You can only pick them up once, from the alien containment. If you want them in item form for later...transporation, you can leave them there for the time being.  
Also, they don't despawn, and you can ask them to stay in a specific location.
Can you send more than one time capsule per save? i.e if I reload my save before I launched the rocket, can I send another?
Another tip: Bleach water is delicious and easily solves your water issue. You can get common coral samples from those big coral tubes, and the salt just spawns in the world.

Actually, the fuel consumption is astronomical if the reactor was just fusing all that hydrogen. I reckon it either removes any deuterium present and fuses that, or just splits off a small amount for the reactor. The rest is probably heated up with a heat pump and ejected like a heat sink.

I'm talking about waste heat. With high specific impulse, you by definition need to have very low mass flow for the same amount of thrust. With such a low mass flow, you can't dump all that waste heat into the propellant easily like you can with a chemical rocket (e.g regenerative cooling). There are no radiators on any of the ships in the Expanse as far as I can tell.
Fourthed
/r/AyyMD
Even at 99.9% efficiency the heat output from those GW levels of thrust would vaporize the drives. Although at higher massflows you might be able to  vent some of it with the exhaust.
I think the Zubrin NSWR might compete with the Epstein drive. Then again, it's even more ridiculous than Orion...

Itchy and Scratchy.
Pure oxygen at .22atm is just as safe as your standard 22/78 air mixture. The problem with it is that keeping a capsule at .22atm when the air around it is 1 atm is difficult. On Apollo 1, they pressurized the capsule with pure oxygen at 1 atm or above, and that made the partial pressure 5 times higher. Needless to say it didn't go well.

You mentioned Antegros, which IIRC is Arch-based.

Most distros will allow you to choose wms from the login screen if another one is installed (via your favorite package manager). You can try installing `i3-wm` or `openbox` and see how you like them. (Note: openbox is very barebones and requires a bit of configuration, but shouldn't take more than a couple of hours)
Your potato is practically a supercomputer compared to *my* potato. The underlying distro can give you some performance advantages (Arch is a good start). However, using a resource-"heavy" WM like KDE, Unity, GNOME, is probably going to bog down your system. I use i3 on my ultra-potato, but if you want a more traditional setup openbox is probably a good choice.

What the fuck did you just discuss about the PSAT, you little student? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in investing, am involved in numerous secret raids on art retreats, and I have over 300 confirmed pictures for my blog. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top clam in the entire mud bed. You are nothing to me but just another tomato flower. I will spread your pollen with the precision only an electric toothbrush can provide. You think you can get away with spreading information about the PSAT? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of proctors across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the invalidation, student. The invalidation that wipes out the pathetic little number you call your score. You're fucking failing, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can ignore you and your lack of class in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my wooden desk. Not only am I extensively trained in stock brokerage, but I have access to the entire archive of the College Board and I will use it to its full extent to void your test results off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" meme was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will remove your clams and you will drown in sulfates. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

The difference between 4,000 feet of water column versus 1 atm of pressure is a LOT bigger than that of air pressure and vacuum. You can survive for 30 seconds in vacuum, provided you open your mouth and let the air out so your lungs don't explode.

> I just posted this story in an /r/AskReddit thread and realized it would fit here.

I once played a game on Android, called Kingdoms at War. Similar concept to Clash of Clans.

Anyway one day I was just minding my own business and building my kingdom, and I got attacked. In this game when you got attacked, you essentially couldn't do anything for a set amount of time if you lost. No biggie, I'd wait it out. 

I came back a couple hours later, and I still couldn't do anything. I'd been attacked like a dozen more times. Turned out this bullshit bully guild would go around doing this to people, flooding them with attacks so they couldn't do anything. I basically couldn't play the game for two days.

Alright, time to get even.

I made a new account, and after about a week of effort - insinuating myself in chats and being near members - I got myself invited to this guild. They didn't know who I was, of course.

I played nice with them, doing whatever I could to help. I gained their trust and was promoted to an officer in the guild after a couple months.

So now comes the revenge. People would do this thing where they would temporarily transfer guild ownership so they could join another guild and help out with wars. They would only do this with people they trusted explicitly for obvious reasons.

About a month later, the owner asked me to hold the guild for the day while he helped a friend out. Of course, I said. No problem. My time had finally come.

The second I had the guild, I fired every officer and banned all members. I transferred all gold to a new guild I'd set up on my original account. Then I disbanded the guild and deleted my alt account.

They never knew what happened. Game, set, match you bully motherfuckers.

    I'd just like to interject for moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
    Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.
        There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!

It's a lot more than that. It gives you full control over every aspect of the camera, manual focus + DOF calculation, histograms, panorama tools, (it can't render them on the camera but gives you an edge overlay), games if you want them, scripting support, RAW, bracketing/more advanced autoISO, etc.

Stock Canon PowerShot usually has manual focus and manual control over aperture/SS, but ISO is fairly limited and shutter speed has a maximum cap of 15 seconds.
Elite definately helped me get a sense of *relative* scale for space...hearing that x nebula is 3000ly away really gives you an idea of how far it is.
If you're a beginner just get a Canon Powershot and throw CHDK on it. Full set of DSLR features at a fraction of the cost. Obviously the pictures wont be as crisp but for someone who is unsure about continuing into the hobby it can save a lot of money.

I thought it was possible because of what Factorissimo can do. I suppose changing it would require updating the actual block/entity itself every time the charge state changed, which would be somewhat laggy.

Using an animation is probably the best choice, as it fits with the other things in Factorio that use their animations to display state (such as the accumulator, and power switches, etc.)
A very, very dodgy solution would be using the alt-view displays from inserters and stuff like that. That's the only thing I could imagine.

Apparently, I was going to be in a LOT of trouble, but since my teacher liked me, I managed to dodge it. I had never used it for anything malicious, just to do it as a "look what I can do" thing.
Could you use a workaround? For example, a "compound block block", a special block that would store information on the compound blocks within it. It might not work the best for refineries or other large things, but for armor slopes and other dumb blocks, it may be able to combine the models together.

You already demonstrated changing models within blocks with the "deformable blocks" introduced a while back.

> I'm currently studying abroad for the summer, and I was stuck with one Looney Toon of a roommate!Her favorite activity is to invite herself to nights out no one wants her at, get drunk, freak out when she doesn't get enough attention, then force one of us (usually me) to take her home and then listen to her whine and lie about her situation. I've missed out on so many fun nights with my friends because of her. 

> Last night we went to a club that was SUPER crowded as it was a Saturday night, and my roommate chose to wear 6 inch open toed heels. When her feet were inevitably stepped on, she burst into drunken tears and ran screaming out of the club.

> The next morning when I woke up her first words to me were, "MY TOES ARE BROKEN!!!! I CAN'T BELIEVE NONE OF YOU CARED HOW INJURED I AM!!!"

> Now, I've been playing soccer competitively for years. I've broken a few toes, and based on her behavior and since LITERALLY NOTHING HAPPENED TO HER, one could only assume she was making this up for attention and her feet are fine. So I decided to have some fun. 

> I immediately leapt out of bed, with the level of (faux) concern one would probably have for a pregnant mother about to be hit by a school bus full of kittens and elderly people. 

> I said, "oh my god! We have to get you to the hospital! I've broken toes before, if we don't get them set properly you could never walk again!"

> Her face paled. She just wanted some attention, she didn't want to go to the hospital and miss the beach trip our program was going on today. 

> As I began to hurriedly dress myself, she stuttered. "Um, maybe I'll wait on that..."

> I grabbed her. "No, we have to go NOW! I'm getting our program director." Ignoring her stammering that she was "probably just going to rest and ice her toes," I got my director and she called an ambulance. 

> Crazy roommate was shipped off to the hospital, missed the beach, and got a stern talking to from our program director about what constitutes a "real injury." Serves her right for ruining 3 of my weekends in a row!

> Edit: Wow! I'm quite surprised by the response to this story. I have a real juicy one for y'all, coming real soon. Keep your eyes open ;)

Eh, something will probably cause the apocalypse before then. Might as well enjoy meat while you can.
Why wouldn't they want GMOs? Allows more food to grow, for cheaper, and that means more profit and cheaper food.
It's okay, I can wait
if it is tasty and non-toxic I will eat it

You got it backwards. Base infinity would be a different symbol for each number, base 1 would be a count using zeroes. (e.g, 0 = 1, 00 = 2, etc)

I don't use PTT channels on my server. If someone has bg noise I tell them to please get rid of it and if they don't they go into the "PTT Only" group that denies PTT perms
The amount in lightbulbs is really quite harmless
Also, reinstalling isn't going to do anything. Just run `apt-get clean` or whatever it was, I'm on mobile.

Granted he would probably use LFS or Gentoo. Or Arch.
Not anymore in 0.15, they were removed.

In 0.14, I don't think you need them for the rocket silo but you do need them for a lot of the science packs.
No! Hash and salt! You need to keep the decryption keys somewhere...

Depends on the source, usually the stack going to the sewer is 4", and depending on what feeds into it the size can change. Longer distances also require thicker pipes.

It's good to try.

I love that you're doing this. Seeing a company even *notice* Linux and the other FOSS communities makes me very happy.

Metallurgical coal is different from fuel coal.

Fuel coal is probably of a lower grade, with more impurities. 
My Moto Z Play scans wayyy faster than my iPad. They might make it better, but certainly aren't the best.
Pipes would be circuit switched networks, most stuff nowadays is packet-based and throttling will just be only allowing some packets through.

I didn't even need them, I could get the backup codes because my computer was still logged in to Discord, and then use them to disable 2FA. Then again, YMMV.

KSP did the same thing. 0.90 was potentially a beta, but believe me, 1.0 was nowhere NEAR stable.
Are pictures of "de-activated" shards deadly?
Do you feel a drying sensation?
I don't think it's actually that. I think it's more like the following:

- Go to next post
- See people talking about topic from before
What's the azeotrope for ethanol and water?
That's nearly pure ethanol, you could run an E85 car off that, probably.
100 mph at only a few kPa is way less than 100 mph at full atmospheric pressure
I honestly have no idea. I did it with luck.
In my family we just yell back and forth across the house until one of us gets bored and walks to the other.
Well, you were -- if you don't breathe it builds up, and you get the urge to breathe.

You won't notice oxygen deprevation, so gases like argon or others that displace oxygen can be more dangerous.
Or have "beautiful eyes"
CO2 is still mostly harmless, if you can leave -- its presence stimulates the urge to breathe, so if you have too much CO2 in the room , you'll immediately want to leave it 
It's because they learned the pattern to do what they want, instead of learning the underlying reason beyond that pattern. If I want to go to, say, Reddit, I know I need to direct a browser to get content from Reddit. If somebody who doesn't understand tries it, they'll just repeat the actions that worked last time. This is why they don't read errors, or cope with changes -- it doesn't fit in with the pattern.



ReactOS?

Thanks! I'll take a look.

Edit: I took a look. Nice, I wanted to install Chromium on Windows but couldn't because compiling on Windows is cancer. Now I have a binary for it!
Most plumbing isn't clearing out pipe.

It's actually installation and running the lines for gas, water, heat, et. al in construction and remodelling.

If you still want to use chrome but want less tracking bullshit, there's Chromium, the FOSS branch of chrome .
