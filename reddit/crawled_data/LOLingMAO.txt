I don’t think there is one, if you do find out one let me know
Still have the Powerlink?
Just curious do you have a source? Not trying to be a douche I’m legitimately asking
Nacho should be coming back on the 30th
got a link? I cant find any :/

I'll do $17
Realistically, what happens to Kim Jong Un now? It’s not like he gets off scot free for the murder starvation, imprisonment of his people right?
Yeah sadly Austin is mostly left out of the good deals. I'd rather make a 2 hour round trip for a bit extra than to not sell at all.
Too much of a hassle lol, I usually prefer local because paypal and shipping are annoying fees to pay. 
Replied
Replied
Replied 
No it's not
Sorry I was editing on desktop
Yeah sure, I could do $10+ shipping?
I think I lost my robes Cletus, I can’t afford to buy new ones to show off my MAGA 350’s
Why would that help? I got my 700’s by using Firefox when Chrome kept fucking up on me
I volunteer to receive a new MBP.


In all seriousness though, I actually really like the keyboard (except for the arrow keys) it’s nice but I still prefer my Vortex Race 3
It was a penalty but there was no way the ref could’ve caught it had it, unless there was VAR
I like mine, my only gripe is the up and down arrows are too small when compared to left and right
Loan with option to buy... of €42million.

That’s what’s baffling to me at least. 
If you do decide to part out at a later time, I’d be interested in the RAM. 
Yes
Do it come with everything? I could do $85 shipped to Austin, TX
No u

I mean... I understand getting rid of these tariffs, but the problem is that Chinese companies don’t spend any money in R&D and simply would just remove the label and sell them as their own and they pull the profits.

You can’t be competitive if all your tech is stolen and sold at a lower price than yours.
Not officially but language changes all the time
Still have it?
Around $8, $10 to be safe, I'll also throw in the cables necessary to get you started
If you can cover shipping yes
Confirmed
I love mine, but since I won’t be gaming anymore I just need a monitor for my MacBook Pro, I haven’t owned any other ones though. 
trading for what exactly?
I'll wait to see if anyone local to me is able to trade, if not I'll PM you!
I don't have 2 Corsair fans?
Sold cpu cooler to /u/dpatel9920
Sold ram to /u/dpatel9920
Damn, I would but you don't have any confirmed trades :/
Sold motherboard to /u/dpatel9920

Top 10 for me, but Runaway is the GOAT.
This graph is pretty old, Vox used to be pretty bad but within the past year and a half they’ve really improved their quality in videos
$850 shipped unless you’re in the Austin, TX area and it would be $800 local
try your local sneaker groups?

What’s that?

Well now the anti-circlejerk circlejerk
I have one, PM me if you're interested.
It is this [one](https://smile.amazon.com/Maximus-Hero-Wi-Fi-AC-Motherboard/dp/B075RJ944T?sa-no-redirect=1)
The reason like it is that the pastel colors make it pretty much a perfect summer shoe, it’s a clean design (I hate 97’s but for some reason I love these) at least in my opinion
Already sold it off sorry
Took some pieces out that totaled to 3k this isn’t all of it lol
No I'm keeping my 8600k and 960 Evo and WD Gold for my SFF build. 
mainly looking for $190 to cover shipping but let me know
I have 3000mhz 16gb Corsair Dominator RAM if you're interested

I think he was just saying in general
He was worth every penny, he gave us some great memories (scoring the winning goal for La Decima, and outrunning Bartra in the CDR final) that immediately was worth 100 million, not to mention the fact that he played a part in last year's league title run that when he stepped up to the plate when Ronaldo was out.

Anyone have a news article?
No they’re white so I’m sure they’re fine people
Still have?
Can I take more from just Susan G Komen?
They never justified it, they said they don’t feel bad for them. That’s not a justification.
Well let’s not forget that she also shot other people
This is actually just the MX Master, the 2S has just Logi on the lmb 

Also I had problems with the 2S, I returned both my original and the replacement from Amazon because it would disconnect every 5 seconds on all 3 settings and with Windows and MacOS.
Well for one it was before the Ronaldo bicycle kick, another being the context of what competition and who the other team was, and finally the fact that it isn’t a “textbook” bicycle kick that you would see if you looked it up on google image search.
Well I mean it only did occur 2 days ago, it’s fresh in people’s mind of course it’s gonna get more praise and attention.
There’s a thing called a hyperbole you know
I tried setting it under all 3 settings and it would continue to do it
Yeah but if the low temp affects all the bags then even if one is puffy in the low temp it should be a red flag.
Where else could he put his arms though? I never see defenders go for slide tackles with their arms crossed over their chest.
Wait, so you guys should be having a bigger deficit?
Around :34 to :35 you can see that he doesn't get on the line where the foul occurs, fuck Barcelona but it's the correct call.
matter of inches, but yeah correct decision.
Not a dive, he should've gotten the pen but he exaggerated too much 
Yeah, but you weren't trying to higlight the differences in your original comments, you were trying to say that Rocket League is a bad version of FIFA.

/u/thewxdude never said that FIFA was a shit game either, he just said that the precision in Rocket League is infinitely higher, which it is because every goal you concede is indeed your fault (assuming your teammates don't score an OG or pass it off) but in FIFA your goalie could pull some stupid shit, or it could literally go through their hands.
Playing Rocket League is more akin to playing FIFA without all the assistance and I say it as a player of both games
Can I ask why? 

It just seems that you’re ignoring the fact that some of our largest companies are gonna lose a lot of money.
I would probably be more upset if Trump was legitimately this stupid and not just acting maliciously
We got him some Rogaine so he won't be exposed any longer.
Ibrahimovic’s vs England was nice too

Finding evidence for people being racist would be hard because I’m sure most people wouldn’t outwardly say they’re racist.
Chi chi spent that shit as fast as it came in, they were broke because she hired private tutors for Goten
Oh you're kidding me

You must be joking

Or you are smoking


Yeah? It was 2-1 with RMD winning and then Lewandowski was offsides and tapped it leading to Ramos to tap it into goal. The 90 minutes ended at 2-2 and then overtime happened and the game ended 4-2 with 3 total offsides goals.
Isn’t this Manhattan from Tony Hawks Underground?
If you’re talking about the Bayern game, they wouldn’t have gone to overtime had the Lewandowski goal (Sergio Ramos OG) been counted offsides.
I got the white one for my PC and MBP and it would disconnect every 5 seconds for some reason when connected to either computer. I returned it
No it's actually James.
These are bad fakes
Yeah, I mean I don’t stream or do anything super CPU intensive so I have no use for a 8700k considering I max everything out without OCing my 8600k
Yeah but if you oversimplify all the Marvel movies they all lack depth.

Iron Man - guy creates suit and gets it used against him, he beats the copycat

Incredible Hulk - guy is dowsed in radiation and a maniac wants to be like him, he beats the copycat

Captain America - guy gets tested on by the US military to be a super soldier and stops evildoer who was also working on creating super soldiers
Maybe injured? I hope it’s nothing serious ☹️
You’re oversimplifying it 
Not interested in parting out
Yeah my bad, it’s the 8600k
Maybe we can scoop in, Ramos is 32 and still kicking but a backline of Marcelo, Varane, Umtiti, and Carvajal would be great. I'm sure Deschamps would also support his defenders be on the same team to build chemistry for international games.
It’s pretty simple, the only complicated part is the fact that they take cash,coin, and card
[Annie](https://youtu.be/WJXW0y-cfE4) are you okay?
Yeah, it’s mind numbing fun. Not a deep story, everything is very shallow and pretty direct. So I can just pop in and watch
Yeah but *nostalgia*
Yeah I know, that’s why I said fiscally irresponsible
>Even $300 on a fake is too much unless you’re making pretty good money.

$300 isn’t too much if you’re fiscally irresponsible. They might not know it’s fake, they might think it was on discount, it’s not like the sellers will tell you it’s fake.
It’s pretty easy to get some fake Louis Vuitton, she might’ve paid $300 on the $1200 bag.

But you’re still absolutely right about sustaining damage
MTV realized that Catfish isn’t enough to keep people watching anymore so they got one of their biggest shows in the past decade to come back in hopes that people watch it (I will) kinda just wish they actually also went back to music videos though.
No he means would you have to accuse your father of rape, or having to actually rape your mom
Denial doesn’t make something come true lmao it does detract from your statement
Yeah, I mean I like the color way, but apart from that they don’t seem special in any other way.

Like I’ll pay max $200 but I see it on StockX *selling* for $2000+
What do you mean as a churner?

If it makes you feel better, I don't understand either.
Probably skipped out on using a VPN
It does sometimes, but I mostly just fix it and tighten my laces which may not be comfortable for others
Really only interested in selling the whole set since shipping would eat up the whole cost of the Zero.
Are you sure you watched Annihilation? It was really good in my opinion, some parts were pretty slow (like the whole beach scene where she finally sees the lighthouse) but I couldn’t really think of any other really slow parts to it
Damn, Austin never gets anything good from SNKRS or Adidas Confirmed :/

Sadly Castle Hill might be demolished by the time OP comes :/ 

Just gonna add some stuff for OP.

When you go to Zilker, stop by Holla Mode it’s a perfect little snack when you want to end the night.

Mickelthwait is a MUST but go when they open because once they sell out of meat for the day they don’t make more. (Get the Lemon Poppy Slaw it is amazing)

P Terry’s is good, but I would recommend Hopdoddy’s over that (still get both though) 

For pizza, get Homeslice or Via 313

For sushi I would try to get the lunch special Bento Box at Lucky Robot it’s not the best sushi but it’s a nice little lunch spot.

For white people tacos, get Torchys. For authentic tacos you can go to most shady looking food trucks at night, I personally like El Super Taco on Oltorf.
He was adding on to his example by saying he is more financially incentivized to fuck over people with disabilities because it comes out cheaper to him.
Austin? I’m assuming that’s why it said I would expect Fiber rollout in December 2016 and here we are without so much as an update.
Yeah seriously, this is a human conversation where friends are talking seriously. Not everything has to be happiness and sunshine, as long as they still respect each other and continue to live healthy(or as close to it) lives, everything is fine

It’s funny that you didn’t post the gif where it clearly shows the defender stepping on him
If anything he did great, I was legitimately scared he would score his teammates just didn’t pass enough to him 
What makes you say that? ^/s
It’s *possible* that it didn’t happen but with his history of not being faithful it wouldn’t surprise me
Are Belgium even gonna field Nianggolan? I thought there was outrage that he wasn’t called up
He could be using this magical thing called *figure of speech*, it’s this new thing in the English language where not everything you say has be taken literally, revolutionary I know
Same here! I emailed them already, I'm gonna call my bank tomorrow and see if I can contest the charge because I emailed them on Friday and still no response
I’m still sad he passed away ☹️
You said Adidas is over saturated and it’s a fad.

He said they’re not interested in the resell market so if it were over saturated they would make more pairs, especially if it was a fad they would want to sell as many as possible before people get over it.
Well... different from this case but Disney in the past has sued daycare centers with Disney characters on them. So they definitely care even if it’s a mom and pop shop.
Your reasoning doesn't make any sense otherwise, everything would be having a 5 finger discount. It's cheap enough that you could scrounge the money up if you collected your pocket change throughout the day daily and still have money left over.
Calculated.

Calculated.

Assuming you don’t have a school email make a Spotify Premium family plan with 5 other people and divide that up equally into $15.

$2.50 and some change to account for local taxes.
No we would play at 1-3-6 Varane in the back. Casemiro, Kroos, and Modric in the middle, and then Marcelo, Carvajal, Ramos, Bale, Benzema, and Ronaldo up front. ^/s
Do you have a source for Bale being on 600k? The only sources I can find have him around 330k
^I ^miss ^you
So basically just being a cheapskate
Honest question, why don’t people just pay for premium? It’s really cheap and actually nice. I pay $5 a month for that and Hulu so basically $2.50 a month for it. It’s something I can afford and if a broke ass student like myself can afford it I’m sure most others could too
Just a warning to those who order these, I got one of these for my girlfriends birthday and it did not turn off. We had to destroy it so it would shut up
Correct me if I’m wrong, but couldn’t we still *possibly* get Mbappe? He is on a loan with obligation to buy at PSG so he could still technically reject their contract offer and still remain a Monaco player for the beginning of next season?

So I bought both the small and big SIGG boxes, but I only received the small one in a package, I called UPS (which did the shipping across the US to my city) and they handed it off to USPS who then delivered to my house, I got the mail in my hand from the mailman but it was just the small box.

I already emailed Supreme, is there anything else I should do? I recorded me unboxing it because I knew the box was way too small to hold both SIGG boxes in it.
Absolutely fucking astounding, especially with the weighting between domestic win/loss and European win/loss

Just curious how do you know it's adjusted?
I think he was asking for you to actually tell your story
People aren't complaining saying it's just the photo inside the lettering, it's everything. The background to look like old paper, coloring inside the lettering being almost exactly the same with the characters standing center-right (except for Chewie)
Absolutely, but previous episodes would literally spend 10-15% of the time going over flashbacks of episodes that weren’t even that far apart. They’d only have to get that animation and slap a cloudy “filter” and they could use that for 4 seconds but have dozens of them
I actually felt that this episode had less reused animation than the previous 10ish episodes. I was contemplating just waiting until it ended but this episode is enough to keep me going :)
So I’m thinking of doing another big spending spree on Steam this upcoming summer, what are some more obscure games I should purchase if the price is right?
I think experimental would be a better adjective, you have to construct it on top of the fact that it doesn't have G-Sync or Freesync.
I was exaggerating for the sake of a joke lol thankfully I’m not in a position where I have to resort to that. Thank you for your input though!
And sold out :(
Could this be why there is a convoy of undercover police and an FBI van headed northbound on I35?
It was just a joke at least for me, people who really struggle and don’t have much time (irresponsibility has been the case I’ve seen in my early classes) 

Personally I prefer 2 sunny side up eggs with some strawberry jam on toast
Nah I’m broke as fuck and I can only afford that and a cup of milk for my breakfast.
One of my teachers was really into cycling and she hit a pothole and smashed all her front teeth out, got them fixed and the fake ones looked amazing, so it definitely could be an accident that broke a bunch of teeth
The trailer seems promising, I might check it out at SXSW assuming they have tickets left
Good bot
If anyone is able to proxy one for me PM me please.
Those only go up to 60Hz
Could we even expect to see a monitor that could handle that within the next 2 years?
Edit: fixed
If you want to get rid of it, I'll pay for shipping and throw them away for you ;)

But seriously though, just get some Crep Protect and get cleaning.
Curious, why not?
Also in Austin, we can go as a group and sing it out as a trio including OP
Didn’t everyone clown on them when they first dropped? When did everyone suddenly love them?
Except that we also have a trigger happy problem with police officers right now as well. 
Except that they do solve their problems with guns. 
The message is going to be put into their head that they can solve their problems with guns. Which is the exact problem we have right now.

That’s what I’m saying, they own the space inside your mailbox. Not you’re actual physical post/box
I thought she had Disney feet?
I think the concept is that there’s a space that belongs to the USPS, that space is inside the mailbox but not the actual mailbox... or maybe I’m just digging to deep and I’m just being retarded

Might be the latter
It’s easy to tell that apart by accent though, Dominicans and Cubans have this exaggerated accent. I couldn’t tell the difference between Mexican, Guatemalan, Honduran, and Salvadoran though

I’m gonna need a source for that bold claim
Watch Chinese security cam videos on liveleak and you’ll get an idea why.

Most notable things are the fact that if you get injured or need medical help they’ll simply ignore you and step around you
But when people say Cocaine White they mean bright clean white
Go to Champs and get some Crep Protect with the cleaning cleaning solution it works really well for my UB’s
Thank you for actually providing a source unlike the dude. So obviously much less effective than a rifle but still could’ve provided some chance.
Can you provide a source? Your responses have just been “nuh uh” twice without even supplying an argument 
Same goes for Common Projects 
Not much more honestly, aren’t they retailing at $250 USD? Only about $30 more after conversion
Yeah they are, I got 3 of the same jeans all 32x30 and Skinny fit, 2 of them are more of a relaxed fit and one actually is skinny
Wouldn’t they vote him as best player though? For the banter
My reasoning is precisely what you said, Flo would probably sell them off, not that they would choose to leave
Kroos said himself he wants to retire on a high note around 32. Modric is 32 currently, and he does run quite a bit in games so he may be on his way off but I hope he and Kroos retire at Madrid (although it is highly unlikely)
The ASUS Maximus X Hero has it in the bottom and the Phanteks P400S doesn’t have a little hole right where the USB 3.0 connector is ☹️

Payday 2 has been a shitshow for a while now though, I stopped playing when they added their crates
Easily my favorite person on Always Open🎉
The asks doesn’t matter, it’s how much it’s selling for. They’re in the mid to high 200’s
These are selling for less than retail just fyi
It would really depend on the shipping costs, I've never shipped across the pond so I couldn't give you a for sure price, PM me to see if we can find an estimate with your postal code or city.
$55 shipped or $90 for both Home and Away :)
Seriously just an hour in jail? He could’ve just taken a nap or something.
Damn, I think I’ll just stick with my Z35P until the X35 releases, GLWS!
The boost has the usage creasing on the inside of the heel (the part where nobody sees) otherwise no, everything is in great condition
I’m interested, but how does this compare to the Z35P? 
But you do have an opinion... it’s just not very popular. Everyone has an opinion and they voice that with upvotes and downvotes as well as comments. 
White Ethnic Trevor you mean?
9/10 wore a few times, but they've been kept clean they also include the extra laces as well
The $220 also includes shipping and fees so it'll just be $220 flat.
But did you call her a bitch?
The first brother that was on the ground sounded like a rat with a mexican accent lmao, yeah that's pretty awesome. Is it on Crunchyroll or another site?

Absolutely is! I got it in the summer, I got the Small Lie set but I sold them off to upgrade my PC 
Look on ebay or craigslist. I got them for $140 locally.
My chair takes care of that :)
For me the Race 3 is the perfect size, I personally don’t think I could adjust to a 60%
Pretty much, I don’t really do anything super CPU intensive like streaming or editing so I’m fine with my set up at the moment :) 
Belkin dock for iPhone and Apple Watch :)
For me it’s literally just the Aesthetics of the Vortex Race 3, if they made a Full sized version (not like their new one that doesn’t even have arrow keys) I’d probably get it

I’d love to but I don’t have the box it originally came in sadly 
Automoderator is a faggot
I remember just a few seasons ago people were saying Salah had no ball control, poor shooting, and his only redeeming quality was speed.

I think your reading comprehension skills need some working on [man](https://imgur.com/gallery/w3hUyFC), I never said that you wanted to ban trophy hunting.


When I said 

>to say trophy hunting should be illegal would be stupid

It seems that you almost willingly ignored the preceding sentence 

>	I personally disagree with trophy hunting,

Right before that sentence came a period which was when the call out stopped.

I called you out for using a fallacy, and provided my idea on it. I never once accused you of wanting to ban hunting.


You're fallaciously arguing about the fallacy. He isn't wrong that humans have been doing it for thousands of years. I personally disagree with trophy hunting, but to say that hunting should be illegal would be stupid. I'd rather have some guy stroke his ego and have that money go to conservation than some guy kill the animal for a quick buck for its horns or pelt. 
So... you can't touch them at all?
No, they wanted to get rid of it to keep profits up. However, there was an outcry because it definitely is one of THE Olympic sports, so it's on track for the 2020 Olympics.
The phrase “rational discussion”
That phrase isn’t a part of my vocabulary 
Originally from the Rooster Teeth Podcast here is an [Animated Adventure](https://youtu.be/HINYhLtaaxc)
Rooster Teeth
Is there an instagram equivalent?
Hardware swap has people who sell them in the 800’s maybe twice or 3 times a week?
didn't receive anything
You kind of looked like a David Bowie tribute singer
The price is on the can tho
Sold 2 right bose speakers to /u/ShanghaiShark
He had Batshuayi running next to him but he decided to keep the ball for 15 more seconds.
Hope he does well, I'm watching the game and he's done pretty well
PMing
Definitely agree, he shouldn't get any attention. If he chose to break the law on multiple occasions that's on him.
But the government won’t put any regulations because 

“Free market” > your rights
Shame I thought he’d sign into YSL
*insert “I’m actually 12 so shut the fuck up” vine*
Happened to my OG Beats when I let my friend borrow them and his dumbass took them to the gym. He paid me back in full though.
Do you still have the SSD's?
I have the Aorus, I really like it, it’s pretty quiet even under load but I don’t have any super intensive games either so I can’t really say anything about it under load. It does well at 2K120hz on an ultra wide 
What parts are needlessly expensive? I think the only thing would be the 850 SSD, everything else seems fine
So you’re just gonna ignore the part that’s inside the parenthesis?
Nobody really thought that, that’s why I added the part in the parenthesis because I knew someone would comment this almost verbatim
Around $6000 in shoes at MSRP assuming the NMD’s cancel out the yeezys so the average price is 180 per shoe
He was anticipated to reach close to Messi/Ronaldo levels(still pretty far though they're on a different level). He hasn't put up the stats (injuries obviously) but he's played an absolutely necessary role in our team.
Yeah, so I basically was having problems with my speakers and I called Bose so they sent me replacement speakers and a puck. But they accidentally sent me 2 Right speakers. I didn’t realize it until yesterday when the 2nd speaker arrived

I think the problem ended up being dirty ports on my subwoofer though because a lot of dust came out when they were hit with compressed air
I don't think so? I don't really understand the wording but you can look at my comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7tvr5k/verizon_apple_continue_to_lobby_against_your/dtg45cn/)
That doesn't seem like it... according to this [site](https://www.mlmlaw.com/library/guides/ftc/warranties/undermag.htm) which is aimed to simplify the legalese.

That law really only seems to be used to let people see and know what warranties certain products contain. I don't think it actually says anything about companies being forced to follow their warranty if you open it, especially if one of the conditions of the warranty is that you don't make modifications

Feel free to correct me though, I just skimmed through it so it may be wrong.
Purchased the second set of 16gb of Dominator RAM from /u/corstang17
Purchased 16gb of Dominator RAM from /u/corstang17
Hmm I need to pick one up on the way home then, I’ve never thought about using those
I upgraded to an Apple Watch. Still miss that week long battery but almost 3 days is good enough for me. 
Isn't that the premise of "The Boy"?
You realize you're on the Austin subreddit, right? 
I don't really know honestly, I haven't been paying attention to the Homepod that much.
You can't just make a claim and just say "Google it". That's not how this works. 

You make a claim, you provide your sources.
Propaganda of what exactly? Calling out someone who isn't fit for Presidency with every mistake? Fox went crazy when Obama wore a tan suit, but everything is fine when Trump makes racist comments. 
>Anything bad that happens currently is because of Obama, and anything good that happens is because of Trump 

That’s the thinking of a The_Dumbass user.

Edit: I'm crying right now 😂, ["One doesn't need to "prove" facts"](https://dl2.pushbulletusercontent.com/W6LiL9dewDZoI3na5SuUsL6S65E6lQwO/fakenews.png)
Does airplay have any degradation? I only recently got into the Apple ecosystem and I’ve never used Airplay before
Someone get this man a Noble Prize goddamnit.
Property taxes go higher the more your house is worth, however these houses are owned by people who don’t have the disposable income to renovate their houses so they’re worth a lot less than the other houses that were recently bought and renovated.

So basically they have to sell the house for less than anything else nearby is, or risk a lien where then the city just sells the house and you’re stuck being homeless.
You’re totally fine, I understand the joke as well. There’s plenty of people here who moved here and have been here less than a decade saying that transplants are a cancer on Austin without noticing the irony.
This is my hometown actually, I’m not a hypocritical transplant saying don’t move here.
Personally, I think people should pick if they want to pay less taxes for welfare. But once they need it, they can't qualify so like Ayn Rand except she wouldn't have been able to get any benefits. But that's not a realistic idea that could be implemented.
They're looking at my city (Austin) I don't want them here. The locals in East Austin are already being priced out of their houses they bought a long time ago. It would only get worse if Amazon came.
I sincerely don't hope you live in Austin. I don't want them anywhere near here especially when gentrification is bad enough right now.
I like when we don’t try crossing for every attack 
Why not? Montoya basically body checked Benzema from behind
Sort by controversial
That was early 2010's streetwear. I believe that's Pyrex, made by the same designer of Off White, Virgil Abloh. Shit it way too expensive to just be given some "quotes"

FTFY
I started cry-laughing when Gus said "Arturito" 😂
I missed the stream but my favorite line was when Michael said “aye he be fucked up”
I’m still mad that Shake Shack got rid of the Hot Chicken ☹️
Like everything it takes practice, this is barely his first season on the first team. He’ll get better, our players didn’t start off being great. They made their mistakes but now we have a squad that has achieved 3 Champions Leagues in 4 years.

You’re the reason people think Madrid fans are a joke, because you do not stand by the team or the players when the going gets tough.
And he’s also 19, lay off him. It’s CDR we can still win this isn’t the end of the world. You can’t just support the team when we’re winning.
This is basically one of the big plot points in Coco
to be fair it would be my dream to play professionally for any top flight club
Did you know about this beforehand or did you only learn about it from that comment a few days ago?
I held a gun to his head man
You’re just an asshole 
yes I sold it, just updated my post sorry about that!

I thought that was the reason why AMD cards are preferred for mining?
You can still turn it off by going into the settings though, it’s 2 more button clicks I know but we can survive
Well the app is a replacement technically
Dude chill lol he brought him up because most of r/soccer watches the BPL and Kante is considered the best defensive mid in the league. 

You really did get triggered by his comment though
 I haven’t thought about using that! I think I might have one laying around
I do, it’s hard to go back from high detail on everything to flat colors everywhere
I kinda regret buying it on the Switch, it looks bad in terms of graphics even in docked mode. I would personally stick to PC.
They couldn’t though they need 60 votes iirc. They still need to convince 5 republicans though before even getting the Democrats to agree. 
Ooh look at Mr. Fancy Pants over here
It won’t happen lol it’s banter
I actually just updated my post already purchased a cooler thanks anyways!
Got a link?
>this is why Bleacher Report has gone to shit


wot?
PM me
Considering he only has a year and 6 months on his contract I am skeptical of paying 500m but then again I'm just hoping the transfer happens, I'm not the person in charge of transfers at Madrid haha
How many sticks is it and what's your asking price?
I hope Papa Flo keeps an eye on him, absolute beast.
I created pretty much my whole rig off of Craigslist for the whole shebang, are you sure you aren’t just searching properly?
I just checked, they have nearly triple my current internet speed for $10 less
I get excited everytime I see a new episode pop up in my feed, easily my favorite new series
Still have? 
Hit the lawyer, delete the gym and facebook up man PM incoming
Kinda hard to find reliable websites for the high seas though. I just use the main ones that are recommended with a VPN but even then they may not always be there.
My trouble is that I can’t seem to get high quality content :/
Same thing here
Damn I literally came to the sub to complain, thank god it’s not on your end though.

~~Found one for $170 at Best Buy~~

Never mind it was the 2gb
You deserve it with this great work!
You’re gonna get back on the large Instagram accounts, I remember your pool party was posted by I think Hypebeast? I forget who exactly but great job!
But why now? Also, aren't higher end GPU's like to 1080 and 1080ti not power efficient enough?

Not when people respond with snide comments, which you’re full of apparently with a quick look of your comment history
Which other ones have they ported? 
Honestly Nintendo should just port the big Wii U titles, I’m not gonna buy one anyways so if they want my money just port that shit
But you entirely expect Ronaldo to hit that, I think it’s a combination of things for the team. Zidane needs to light a fire under their asses, as much as a love him and the work he’s done he has to remember that he’s the manager of the squad. 

I really hope he doesn’t get sacked
The math is there... I still don’t believe you.
Oh... a $15 fee? Might as well add a $5 shipping charge
Porn/Gore sites don’t exactly champion themselves as “kid friendly” they aren’t also marketed towards kids either.
Where the hell could I get gashapon toys in the US?
For that 1:1 lead poisoning 
Yeah, but if you have to hold an actual meeting before practice instead of just saying it during practice it might be serious.

She’s lucky she isn’t black, otherwise she would be charged with “being a minority”

Eh not really, as a fan of football you hear about black players being abused by fans by being called monkey or being thrown bananas and this is in countries like Italy and Russia. 
Wel if you want to afford it just get a better job ^^^/s
M8 the Barca fans are out in full force you won’t win, you’d win an argument against a brick wall before you win against them.
No thanks, price is firm
I got a pretty used up one for $200 and other than the squeakiness I love it and don’t regret a single cent
I have a similar set up to yours, get a Herman Miller Aeron. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT
You can always explain [later](https://youtu.be/ZXsQAXx_ao0) ^but ^seriously ^though ^consult ^your ^SO
Standard battery, as far as I know the extended range hasn’t released yet but I haven’t kept up with the updates
Honestly I’d be willing to drive to meet, it’d be extra but still significantly less than the shipping charge
He’s almost guaranteed death in the newest season, he’ll probably sacrifice himself to save Brienne or some shit. 
Not sure why you got downvotes for literally showing a counter example of what the other guy said. 
These would be excellent for her re-election especially if the news picks this up as well 
That’s cheaper than the preseason games here in the US...
That’s what the overpriced food is for though. People don’t really give a shit if the Sears gets replaced with an AMC because it would be closer to people living in North Austin and better than Galaxy 10.
Can you explain? Not being snarky, I just don’t know
It's also good that management is (hopefully) not badgering him about coming back. 
Wouldn’t this be too big to actually eat as sushi?
Hillary won the popular vote FYI so even those who were BernieOrBust didn’t play a really big part into Trump winning. The DNC purposefully trying to stifle Bernie’s campaign probably did play a big part though since many of the Trump voters I know said they wanted anyone but Hillary
They should've given it time in testing, not when it becomes publicly released. You can't just tack on "Early Release" and be okay with it, otherwise companies like EA will doing the same thing
Needs more Eurobeat
Well the parents have to be okay with their kids getting married to each other don’t they?
So you’re just gonna ignore what he said, and just respond with, “Did you die tho”
I believe there are some cars that do give you a birds eye view, but mostly it’s just practice line up next to the other car, turn steering wheel all the way to the right, reverse quite a bit, steering wheel all the way to the left and slip in, and then just work out the details. Austin Powers does a better job [showing it](https://youtu.be/IGiQOCX9UbM)
He sold all his stock? Wouldn’t that be considered insider trading if he knew about this defect?
Well Trump made it, people reacted to it. That stupid tweet is now going to be a part of US History.
But you’re complaining right now though
Kinda related, I saw The Growlers at ACL this past year and they were pretty nice
Don't be a dick either. Someone is just asking for a source.
Proportion doesn't matter. The impact does. 
Yes. He's doing more than you and me. 
No seas pendejo ^^^^^^/s
Even if he is acting like it, it’s better than him not doing it at all
So does anyone have a mirror
I actually went negative for a few milliseconds
I only have ~~$3~~ 0.000206 Bitcoin
So you’re saying they’re delicate little snowflakes?
So you’re just gonna ignore what he said to try and keep arguing?
You know damn well what I was talking about. The reason this is a whole problem and lawsuits are being brought up. It was only rumored regarding them slowing down iPhones through updates. How is one supposed to do research beforehand? I really like Apple but I hope they do lose these lawsuits, it's not fair to deceive your customers like that. He's not asking for regulations so your little "Stop trying to get a government..." comment is stupid, he wants financial compensation for being defrauded of his money, not from the government but from Apple. The government will simply be holding the court and make the decision.
Except nobody knew, they were just rumors up until a few weeks ago
So what happens if you run towards it?
I live in Austin, there have been more coyote spotting but I don’t remember there being any actual coyote attacks on people recently
Nobody believed it was real when some of his posts were “0 people like this”
I mean nobody ever thinks it’s real, pretty sure there are guys just like Brendan though 
For those OOTL: https://imgur.com/gallery/Gjcb5
To be fair it’s complete shit on PC as well
Too bad it’s not the no ads version, I love Hulu but can’t stand the ads
Damn which one do you go to? The one here in Austin is always dogshit and overpriced
Go back to Facebook dude lol it was one comment to tell him to chill out😂
You sure care a lot to **not** be a Barca fan lol
Not really freaking out, I’m annoyed sure but you seem to be over one win considering we won La SuperCopa only a few months ago with an aggregate of 5-1, shit changes don’t you worry about it 😉
So you’re not arguing for the sake of fact you’re just arguing to be a jackass? I really am LOLingMAO at your comment now  😂
I mean that’s fine, we didn’t deserve the win. You can not argue though that this last goal should have happened had the ball been correctly called as out of bounds. Nice try at the joke though
I think you mean headlight fluid
I’m not saying conceding this goal was the reason we lost dumbass. This play shouldn’t have gone forward because the ball was out and was not given a thrown in for us. I’m not saying we deserved a win so chill the fuck out.
I’m not talking about that though?
Bad optimization
The game looks pretty fun, those frame rate issues are what bugged me most about it.
Damn can’t believe that all started from the ball being out 
Wait there’s a second half? The players left that mindset at the end of the 45
I’m gonna have to disagree with Google Assistant it’s amazing for the small things I need a personal assistant to do.
I meant comfort wise haha, people here would be riding these if they were a more recognizable brand. Also don’t mind the other posters if Kanye wore them once these same dudes would be paying $400 for a pair
I love them, but there’s a problem with them for me at least. Whenever I use no shoe socks the Flyknit rubs up against my ankle chafing it
Thankfully I got them yesterday for $206 at my local botique :) beats paying for beat up ones for $280 on Grailed
Some white Kaws’ would be gorgeous, but they’d be a pain to keep clean

There’s this dude who got a beard using the main ingredient in Rogaine, however I wouldn’t know the side effects of using the chemical.
I’ve heard these are the most comfortable shoes around, how do you feel about them? 
Doesn't have to be, you don't buy these for the boost you buy them cause they have the Yohji Yamamoto aesthetic

Not on the Switch though. I kinda regret buying it, it's horrible looking compared to the PS4 and PC :(
Yeah... I've been listening to it for a few months now and I don't ever recall a change machine being brought up
Let's not act like **nobody** else does that though
What are good no-show socks? I lose my no show's constantly through irresponsibility (I think my washer eats them, I've pulled socks out of the drum before) and I just want cheap ones that are comfy, preferably in large packs.
...or you know people can do what they want? Isn’t the point of society and a potential utopia is that everyone is accepted? Whether they want to believe in Jesus or a Giant Spaghetti monster as long as they aren’t harming others they should be able to do their own thing
Well to be fair, Nazism would probably affect you if you aren’t White and Christian so it’s not like you have to exclude it because it would almost by definition affect others
Still have the CP’s?
Jesus you’re dense

What are the resolutions on Rocket League? This is the only purchase I've regretted for RL, pretty on PS4, GORGEOUS on PC, and just god awful sometimes on Switch.
That’s fine, same thing happened to the Western Hemisphere not even 600 years ago. Populations change all the time.
I wouldn’t be talking when you deleted your comments 
Well racist people do tend to hide behind free speech. So he didn’t call you racist, like you originally stated, and there was no implied meaning either. Stop victimizing yourself.
There’s a couple of people taking this meme too seriously, I love Bernie but it’s a meme chill out
He didn’t say you were racist, you said “so he can have his free speech limited” and he rebutted to that. 
The way you’re speaking about it is trying to teach a German on how a German life is
I’m so mad I feel like it’s a screw up. I ordered something from Supreme last week as well and I emailed them about why I haven’t gotten a tracking number and they said they cancelled my order, so I checked my bank account and I didn’t get a $38 refund, but I suddenly have over $450 returned. 

I heard KAWSONE and Supreme use the same company for online sales is that true? 
Damn I’m disappointed it isn’t getting a box :/
As in 4’s in general or these 4’s specifically? I had a pair of Forest Green and they were super comfy

No you’re literally what’s wrong with America. It’s noble that you want to help your home country, but you still need to pay your fair share of taxes. 
I have the order number but the money was taken out of my account so im not worried
I got stuck on please wait... hoping it goes through
I think they should really do more collaborations... maybe Burnie on Hot Ones?
Nope, I feel the same way. I have a Z35P and it’s only *slightly* too big but I couldn’t imagine having that monitor, the physical travel of my neck would probably hinder productivity
Aw fuck, hopefully less than $300.
What’s the anticipated price?
**of the road**
Still cheaper than the tickets here in the US for the pre season games.
Doesn't it use Mini USB instead of Micro USB to charge though?
I got one on eBay for $750 with 1K miles, just be patient and if you use Craigslist just set a save search with email notifications in case anyone posts one for sale.

How many cops got acquitted when there was video of them shooting an unarmed citizen? 
Shut up, you're just as bad as the people who act like the general public won't call this tablet the "MyPad" instead of "MeePad"
Are you being facetious? The whole point of trademarks is that you have a brand you have to preserve. The point of patents is that it isn't fair that you spend a bunch of money on R&D and some company swoops in and steals your product and undercuts you running you out of business. 
Isn’t that the point?

I personally like being able to charge on any of my ports, I tidy my cables up so people tripping isn’t much of a problem, the specs have been upgraded well enough that I do believe it’s worth it. I’m already mostly invested into USB C so I don’t see a problem with that either. That’s not even taking into account the hyperdrive for the new MacBook brings back most of the ports
Honestly it’s not more expensive with a better library at least in my opinion. I pay $12/month for no ads, and Netflix is already at $11/month

edit: fixed the price I said $14 but I was wrong.

I never said it wasn't correct, I'm saying it's retarded because it's so over-encompassing of every single person. He's right, we'll never know for sure if every single person in this world is 100% not a pedophile. It's just plain stupid to say that though, hence the "retarded argument" part.
It is a retarded argument though, it can apply to anyone. It’s not that it’s a Michael Jackson thing, it’s that it’s a retarded argument overall. I could say that to you. I cannot say FOR SURE that you’re not a pedophile. 
He has trial coming up next year, not to mention the fact that the women who came out haven’t recanted.
Because it’s an argument you can use with ANYONE I could say that about you. Therefore it’s a retarded argument. I don’t know you, I can’t say for sure that you haven’t touched kids before though.
Your claim is that he *might* have been a pedophile, we just don’t have any proof of it. 

That’s stupid, the whole basis of law in the US is that we are innocent until proven guilty, not the other way around. 
When was he convicted of that?
Because that’s a retarded claim? 
OP I would advise against this because then she’s gonna expect more

I’m buy and sell stuff locally all the time, a good deal for an iPhone X at this moment is $1100 for a 64gb and $1250 for the 256gb. This is just what I’ve seen around the Austin area, you WILL NOT get a sold out item with incredibly high demand for 10% of the resell.

The one time I did complain to a company it was to Google Maps. Here in Texas, our toll roads are owned by a shady company who takes their time sending bills in order to catch you with late fees. 

Anyways, on Google Maps you used to need to manually put in if you wanted to avoid highways or toll roads or ferries. A few months after I sent them a long email/rant they sent me an email saying that they added that feature. Now you just put it in and your choice stays on there until you want to change it.

Wait so combined Spotify + Hulu no ads for $11.99?
I️ won’t switch to the Hulu deal until they have the 0 ads option for extra.
Budget - <$150 USD I️ do not mind buying used.

Source - Bose Companion 5’s that are connected to my PC.

Preferred Type of Headphone - Over Ear preferably 

Preferred tonal balance - I️ know jackshit about headphones, but bass would be nice.

Past headphones - Sony MDRXB950BT - I️ liked them but I️ upgraded to...
Sony MDR1000X -I️ really liked this, but I️ used it for everything and I️ sweat a lot so I️ want to get nice headphones and then sport headphones. I️ just need help on the nice headphones however.

Preferred Music - Hip Hop and Rock primarily.

Reason - I️ want better sound from my computer while playing games and listening to music.
But the $5 is with ads isn’t it?
Still have?
I’m not an audiophile by any means but don’t you need a DAC to even enjoy those files?

Let’s not act like Android phones are incremental upgrades year to year either though
I buy and sell a lot locally, it’s totally possible. I just sold a 7 Plus 128gb for $550 that I bought a few months ago for $400. I already had money saved up for the X so I just put that money back into my bank account. You just have to be patient to find a great deal.

Good ol Russian Institute of Technology. The funding was brought to you by Rosneft.
Except for the fact that we can do simple shit like not have so many cows, or use less electricity, or buying locally grown food so transportation of that food doesn’t contribute as much as a cross country trip.

Also, why do those people in developing countries not deserve any wealth? I can almost guarantee they work harder and longer than both of us. 
and people were saying 70 million was too much for him. 
The used game market is pretty quick, hell even on release day games can be found used for $50. It might take a few weeks if they aren't near the summer or winter sale
I didn't mean you specifically, I meant in general
Except for the fact that if you want consistent 4K60FPS content you need to  spend enough money for a 1080ti (which is $700 minimum) and then a proper CPU (another $210 minimum) and the PSU (another $100+ depending on how power efficient you want your system)  not to mention the MOBO (another $100 minimum)... and then you get to the games, however the games people are buying the Xbox One X are going to be new games that people want to play immediately. So they'll be spending $60 regardless. 

I still love my PC + Switch combo and wouldn't get an Xbox One X. It just is annoying that PCMR people are annoying about it.
Not really, he can play 4K HDR on his tv. I have spent a total of $2400(according to PCPP) on all of my components + peripherals, but I still couldn't play fluid 4K. 

I personally don't regret it, but after taking over a year of bartering I've gotten to wear I am now. People always say to just buy a PC and save money on the games but you usually have to be a patient gamer for that.

I owned the XB271HU before I switched to the Z35P, it as an EXCELLENT monitor. I highly recommend it, I switched for 2 reasons though

1. The stand is ugly and doesn't fit the aesthetic of my setup

2. I got a killer price for this ultrawide, only problem is it's a VA panel, but since I don't do any creative work I am fine.
Save his logic? You cannot just pick and choose which offsides goals would have counted. So what we had luck. That doesn't take away from the fact that if Lewandowski was counted offsides in the second leg, we wouldn't have scored the 2 offsides goals. It's not that complicated 
Those offside goals wouldn't have happened had we not gonna into overtime.
And the goal that led to overtime was offsides as well
REEEEEEE

Get a Samsung T3 and move shit over. I use my Macbook Pro as a study+work laptop and I also have a gaming PC for fun. I just am confused on why you bought the worst model they currently offer apart from the Mac Mini
What the fuck, did you buy it new? I could find a couple of base Macs for $900 USD. If you want to increase your memory, increase your iCloud storage. I pay $1 a month for 50gb  I think 2tb is $10 a month?
Ah, I was under the impression it was a Macbook Pro. How much did you pay for it?
From what I'm gathering, is that you have at the VERY LEAST a 2012 Macbook. So either you got 5 years out of a laptop (or 9 years if you got a 2008 model). That seems pretty good for a laptop. 

Also it's not a coding language, those are terminal commands.

Congrats, you're in the minority. They're trying to tilt you so that you fuck up more when you start thinking in the moment instead of being more tactical.
The other guy probably feels the same way lol
I've put Shadow on Casemiro so far he's been a tank for me.
I have an Acer Z35P it's a VA panel though and the blacklight bleed is noticeable at an angle but otherwise it's a great monitor and I have it set at 120hz iirc
You're a fucking god. I love you so much haha thank you so much!
Mine would have a .5 second input lag for my DS4 so playing any games was unbearable so I sold it hopefully they have a better internet connection
My bad, I always go over the wall. Especially near the corner flag. It's a great feeling when you score from such an awkward angle
Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but the way Jews were rounded up was because Germany had a census and Jewish people obviously identified themselves as Jewish(among other documents). Then the Nazis rose to power and they persecuted the Jews.

You could translate that into the data that the government has on us and when someone with bad intentions and they rise to power... Well history could potentially repeat itself.
wtf are you doing you're going against the circlejerk

Jesus Christ you guys take things way too seriously. 
[Well...](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/960/986/d28.gif) 
I'm not complaining cause I got a dad bod going on
Hmm make sense, I guess Spanish... Spanish is significantly more different than Mexican Spanish than I originally expected. I understand Casemiro being truncated to Case but Carvajal is already a pretty short surname
Slightly unrelated, but why did you kinda abbreviate Carvajal's name? You were already 60% there.
Is it worth it to upgrade from an old S340? 
Don't worry the most expensive player I've pulled has been Bellerin. So 17k into my coin purse.
It's a power free kick, anything less than 2 bars is a low driven kick (for when the wall jumps) and from 2 1/2 to 3 1/8 will be blasting it to the top (assuming your player has good FK Acc.) In my case, L1 + LS up + Circle
Wait so are your chances higher with the web app? What about the companion app?
He doesn't mean it literally. It's not that deep.
But this is a recreation of the sauce too? The formula will have for sure changed
Dude it's just a sauce... If you want it that bad make it. They already have several videos of basically the same thing
Because I don't have any sauce reserved, you ask for the nuggets and then they ask you what sauce you want. 

And [also](http://www.reactiongifs.com/r/2013/06/opinionated.gif) 
I went to McDonald's, ordered some chicken nuggets because I wanted to try the Szechuan sauce, they didn't have any. I was annoyed for *maybe* 5 seconds but I just told them to surprise me with the sauce and I got the Signature Sauce and it was pretty damn good.
You're the one with the victim complex who doesn't understand why people would want to keep a would-be murderer behind bars... So who's really trolling here?
Well, I don't know man. You're one of the few who's trying to argue against emailing the Parole Board. So you tell me if you're trying to get stabbed.
Trying to keep your attempted murder inside jail? Seems like a justified agenda
I'm not trying to get stabbed when im walking in the park so I'm emailing them
Minimum I can find for shipping is $7 so I'm gonna have to stick to 25, sorry about that

I think you're meaning to talk to me, but my closest MLS team is 4 hours away with little to no traffic. 
I'd love to except Austin doesn't have a professional team and the nearest one would be the equivalent of going from Leeds to London
I'd fix the time from Austin to DFW or Houston to at least 3 hours.
Exactly, I wasn't trying to argue against him 
I wish I could afford to go from Austin to Madrid every other week
At least he's more transparent than others. 
Well I mean we are well known for counter attacks
I'm like 95% sure he's making a joke
So when you jump you don't fall down like a ragdoll? ^/s
My guess is people walk with their hands straight down like Napoleon Dynamite.

I know the commentator pissed me off with that, I would hope commentators would know the rules of the game.

I'm looking at one right now for $1100 local
I'm team "I like shit and if it's worth the money I'll pay it, as long as it isn't out of my budget in which case I'll look used" 
Curious where would I find a replica?
On behalf of a sports fan who recently got a jersey from someone ill tell you thank you :)
My line of thinking is that 23 and Me is more Euro-Centric so it would apply more for people with relatively close European descent
Serious question, if I'm Mexican is there any point in me doing 23 and Me?
Why not both?
You're not in the minority don't worry
Your friend does realize "breaking ankles" is a metaphorical phrase, right?

No, this entire thing started when the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
Correct? You mean "The *only* answer"
Kinda off topic but not really, I feel like there are other sensations that we have no concept of because we don't have the proper organs. So in this case, if we didn't understand the concept of color we would go crazy on how it is described.

I saw it last night, I thought you guys were overhyping it. But goddamn that was a good movie.
It was in development in 2009 so I don't think a R rated Deadpool was the reason we got It.
What is this?
Although I'm upset we tied this last game, I'm happy both Mariano and Morata are doing well in their new teams 🙂
Mine seems to have a lot of latency through a DS4 on Bluetooth so I think I might sell mine.
Nice, I'm kinda hoping we get another Y3 collaboration. Yohji Yamamoto is a goddamn genius and that dragon jersey was gorgeous.
So if I post my fits, then there should be someone who actually posts a good one right?
Well she's also a dancer, so there's that too
I'm not talking about DACA. The whole context of the main comment all the way to yours is not directly related to DACA.

Even then, these would be the children of those poor people I was speaking about.
Right, because that thought never crossed their mind? You do realize we are talking about poor people who cannot pay a lawyer to help them through the complicated system right? Or the fact that you can spend a decade applying and still get rejected?

No they just choose not to.
Hey *guy*! Fuck you!
Ooooh edgy /s
He landed knee first on the mat with all his weight. He doesn't look like a light dude either, probably 180-200 lbs + downward force all on the knee.
I thought only Battle of Gods was canon? All the other ones weren't canon overall because Toriyama had little to nothing to do with them.
Still have?

I built it, but I'll sell it to you for *1 million dollars* and your first-born
I would get those when I didn't have a card (and checked my credit scores as well) and those calls didn't actually stop until a month after I actually got a credit card
So you're saying my build with a 7700k and a 1050ti isn't a good build? ☹️ /s
Its nice to dream though
The thing is I dont know you, if you have a flair for another team within the league I dont assume that you would watch them.
Shit I would too. 

Just like Eric Cartman's 4 Point Plan. 1.Start up 2. Cash in 3. Sell out 4. Bro down

Also he could just let his contract expire and we would then get a 23 year old Mbappe on a free but with high wages. Thats better than paying €163m + high wages.
I'm gonna go with the thoughts of actual Hereneeven fans when they say the whole team fell apart last season (not falling out or anything, just that none of them played incredibly)
...look at his username. @ultraautistic

Are you seriously thinking this is a legitimate source? Its obvious his name is a play on @ultrasuristic_

Same, I saved up all summer for one. It's perfect for everything that is semi-professional and then I have my PC for literally just games, Reddit, and home streaming.
If anything our top targets were just getting renewals from all the players with a higher buy out clause for each of them...
Shit thank you! I'll update my post!
I honestly don't know how to measure that :/

Ironic because the U.S. did the same to Mexico with corn for NAFTA. That was a big reason of why my family illegally immigrated here to the U.S.
I have a pair of MDR1000X, should I get these as a second pair?
We should have never gone to extra time had it not been for the Sergio Ramos OG because Lewandowski was offside.
Defeating one of the strongest teams in Europe with a 6-3 aggregate isn't outclassing them?
The ref had plenty of more chances to send off Vidal and tbh he and Casemiro should have been sent off by then. 
Are we just gonna ignore that in the Sergio Ramos OG, Lewandowski's touch should've been counted as offsides?

I sat next to the anonymous questions box in my science class and my science teacher was also the sex ed teacher. 

Whenever I got bored I would go into the box and read the questions. My favorite were

"Can you get pregnant from a dildo"
Slightly unrelated but where the hell can I get glass mixing bowls. I'm trying to buy them secondhand but I can't find any.

I meant having to offload him, not going straight to Bayern. Even if he did go to the Premier League we would still have been getting robbed but a player of his caliber HAS to keep playing.
It was for the best 😔
They're not rich because they're white. They're white because they're rich.
Honestly I think it would be a better situation if it came out he was a Perez mole. At least we would know he was acting maliciously compared to being so inept to drag down Barcelona to the extent he has
Quarter pyramid

Better?

Yeah he is for sure but he's not THE fastest if that makes sense
This is why I don't want us taking 30 mil for Lucas Vasquez. He's not the flashiest nor the fastest. But he always has that pep in his step
Shit you're right! Let me fix that
Yeah, like the tackle Mee did on Morata was feet first then ball and Morata got the yellow

Edit: Mee did get the yellow disregard
That's not exactly Bartomeu's doing, they've been having players talk up scouted players saying they have Barca DNA and look at the Fabregas saga.
"It's not much but it's mine"

Can you shrink them 1.5 sizes down please lmao fuck these are my grails :(
Well I don't think she's really there mentally after her aneurysm
...But I mean we already did Brazil, going to do Russia, and then Qatar. Morrocco would certainly be a step up especially for European citizens. Or well citizens in general.
Isn't Morrocco probably the best African country to visit?

I actually love the honeycomb meat, the one that freaks me out is the one that kinda looks like a tongue with taste buds.

Speaking of tongue, tacos de lengua are delicious too
I honestly think if we hold off right now his stats will go down dramatically with the exodus of all his teammates and he'll be significantly cheaper

Seriously, here in Austin theyre in stock everywhere I go. I have only seen like 5 people using them since they released
This line of thinking is slippery, like ISP's. Their infrastructure, their service, their rules. It can't just be some blanket statement.
I'll make one for you for 29.99
But you're still not actually arguing against my argument. You're comparing European countries to each other when the actual question was Europe as a whole compared to South America and Africa
Government mishandling plays a huge part in that
Actually my answer still stands. I'm going from the early 1500s all the way into the late 1800's when the reason why European countries are richer than SA and Africa. While I don't disagree with what you're saying Switzerland was pretty poor during these times but a huge part of why Switzerland is rich is not only what you said, but they're avoiding the highest expense. War. The last official war Switzerland had was their civil war while other European countries had to deal with WW1 And 2 which killed plenty of the people in other European countries that saves plenty of young people who have great ideas who werent killed allowing for your social and political systems to flourish. If a government mishandles money that was previously a colonization powerhouse *cough* Spain *cough* and is poorer than Switzerland, that still is not a counter argument to the fact that the reason why European countries are typically richer than those continents because of their exploitation of said continents
I didnt compare European countries within themselves, the question was why are European countries richer than continents like SA and Africa. My answer still isn't wrong. When those countries got more resources (gold, goods) they would sell to their neighbors and became richer than them. 
Seriously? How about reading my comment?

The conspiracy doesn't tackle that Real did not receive money from the government to afford Di Stefano. 
That wasn't what I was arguing though when did governments put in money to buy a player. I'm not arguing that Madrid more than likely has strong-armed the government into lowering taxes or allowing stadium deals. 

However, let's stick to what I actually said.

1.) Because of colonization of those continents and exploitation of their people and resources. 

2.) I have *never* heard of them you must tell me more

When did European governments put in money to afford players?
Bingo. Not gonna fix it though haha
💔plz no
...Or maybe it's just preference?
You're right, I apologize /u/WholesomeLad :(
Won't teams just milk Barcelona for prices though now that they're assuming that they have a shit load of €€€€? I'd think an inflated Dybala price would be like €150mil
To be fair your're probably not the #2 player in the team worth a couple of hundred mil. 
I switched to iPhone, but anyone have any recommendations for a cheap good tablet. I want to use it as my radio/car media player.

I am literally still unstable financially from buying mine (I'm also 19, so I don't have super important bills but I basically used a all of my budget for the year buying this, but I don't regret it one bit since I managed to hook up my Macbook Pro onto the HDMI, with my gaming PC on the DP.
He's kind of mumbling(the loud ass A/C system doesn't help either) buuuuut...

"Alvaro, want to tell the Madristas before your departure?"

"Thank you for everything, it was wonderful to win again here, I hope Madrid continues to win, I hope they won't play against me"

Incredibly simplified but that was the overall message
Supply and Demand, there's no supply but there is a demand
I think you're forgetting the Sergio Ramos OG was because Lewa was offsides, Casemiro definitely did get away with a Red. But then there was the kick at Marquinhos by Neymar with no intention of getting the ball.
I'm still hoping to get a pair of Zen Grey Yeezy 1's. But the price ☹️
