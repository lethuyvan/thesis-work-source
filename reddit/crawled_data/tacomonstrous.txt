The parent comment was talking about purchased songs.
There is no DRM for music, and hasn't been since around 2010.
I've never encountered your problem A, but you can still download any purchased songs to your hard disk from the web version.
Assuming the Warriors get past the Pels.
Seriously, OP, you should have done your due diligence before letting someone use a Chromebook in Developer Mode.
That's a bit crazy.

My PixelBook wouldn't charge with my MacBook Pro charger, not sure what happened. It works fine with my phone charger though. 
There are two things Chrome OS needs to be a better tablet OS:

1. A *much* better virtual keyboard. Typing on this thing is like pulling teeth right now.

2. A better paradigm than the dock at the bottom, or at least better palm rejection, so you're not unknowingly activating the notification center or the Overview screen all the time.

Outside of these I'm pretty happy with the tablet experience on the PB.
Bonus graph seems to be the same?
GPM will soon be replaced by whatever half-baked thing Google's going to announce at I/O under YouTube's umbrella. So your wait will end soon.
You're going to have to target Oreo soon anyway: https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/12/improving-app-security-and-performance.html

Might as well do it now.
The meaning of this was the opposite of what I thought from the subject.
This isn't an AC unit, just something that can control one. It works better than most first-party smart AC controls, which uniformly seem to suck.
Yes, it does.
I use [Sensibo](https://sensibo.com/). It's compatible with most standard units. It's basically an internet connected IR remote.
Wait, how does that happen?

> Google should have a the keyboard shortcuts ready somewhere in the OS so we can just check on it easily, you know? 

Hit Ctrl+Alt+?
>- You probably cannot open PB one-handed. The hinges are just a bit too firm for that.

They loosen up over time. It's a deliberate feature.

> The launcher key (leftmost column, the one with a filled dot icon), and the menu key (the top right corner) do not work when you have everything minimized/closed. Doesn't work like the Windows key or macOS' apps key at all.

Works for me on Dev 67.

>The problem is there's no way to dismiss/minimize the floating window without clicking the tiny 'X' on the window.

Esc works for me, at least on Dev 67.


Working for me on the Pixelbook.
Depends on how much importance you give to playoff performance.
Sleeping on Manu smh
Watching this just makes me miss prime DRose 😢
It's a little hard to take your comments seriously when they don't address the combination of use cases that I point out for the Pixelbook, which very few other devices, if any, can lay claim to. Your Toshiba chromebook certainly doesn't.
>I am extremely skeptical that the experience of a Pixel Book is much different at all from the experience of a much less expensive chromebook

It most certainly is, especially if you tend to have 6 browser windows and 5 Android apps open at a time. Just try opening up Overview mode and witness the lag. 

In any case, if you don't see the point of it, that's fair, but to declare it a terrible idea seems like a normative statement, which is what I was responding to.

Edit: Let me put it this way. There's nothing I can do with my MacBook Pro that I can't do on my PixelBook with Crouton. It also weighs less, has a better keyboard, functions as my notebook, and lets me download Netflix videos for offline viewing. Oh and it also costs much less than the MBP.
As someone who has both the Pixel LS and the Pixelbook, I have to disagree greatly. If someone likes the Chrome OS experience, as I do, then why shouldn't they be able to get the best possible one? Also, a $900 laptop is well below what an equivalently specced Macbook would cost, and the Pixelbook has by far the better keyboard. Not to mention, it is also my go-to notebook through Squid, as well as my go-to PDF reader through Xodo, and certainly my go-to media consumption device. The build quality is just fantastic and the convertibility and lightness are simply amazing. 

In any case, I do have crouton installed, so that I can use Sublime Text, and then voila you also have the best hardware for a Ubuntu machine.

The only real downside for me is the lack of biometric authentication. PIN unlock takes the sting out of it a little, but I would have much preferred a fingerprint reader.
There have been no real feature additions to Play Music for what seems like years. I'm hoping that whatever service they're looking to replace it with (led by YouTube) will be built with Home in mind, and will get features like this.
A lot of what?
You shut your jinxy little mouth.
Nah.

Not really sure what prompted this response, because nothing I said indicated anything about commingling my work and personal life.

When I say 'professional organizations' I mean conferences, conventions, etc., which are coordinated through Facebook. I personally keep my profile as bare as possible and certainly don't do anything work related on it, but I still need one for a couple of groups that I'm part of, because it's the only way to get updates. 
That's often not an option for everyone. A surprising number of organizations, even professional ones, use Facebook as the main tool for co-ordination. It's very annoying.
> a senate seat.

Luckily, we, along with stalwart states like Idaho and Montana (and 47 others), will never lose a senate seat, barring a constitutional amendment. The second house seat though might be in danger.

While this was a shitty call, as I said elsewhere, this might have worked out better for the Jazz as things panned out. They got the last minute tying shot from Mitchell, while in this scenario where Gobert gets his and-1, the Spurs would have had the final shot, in all likelihood.
If Rudy got his and-1, the game would only be tied. 
Rudy's shot left them trailing by 1. A foul shot would only have tied it.
How do you mean? If that happened, Spurs would run out the clock with a last second shot. So either they win or it goes to OT anyway.

Yeah there's no way for that not to suck.
Where in Boston is your work? The commute is very convenient if you live near the train station in Providence, and if your office is near Back Bay/South Station, or at worst, on the Red line. I work near Brookline, and, even though I'm near the Providence Amtrak, I just drive, because the Green line is terrible.
That's disappointing. Hope this improves over time.
A newbie question: What kind of file system interaction does this support? Can files cross-pollinate across containers? Or with the Downloads folder?
I've had both, and there's no noticeable difference in battery life. If you have the disposable income to buy the more expensive model, then by all means do. It's not necessary, but it's awesome.
Okay, in that case, I'll edit my edit. Thanks for pointing this out.

The podcast functionality has nothing to do with Play Music. See my reply above. 

Yes, it doesn't make much sense. It's also the reason that podcasts can't be played on audio groups.
It's not. It's powered by [Google search](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/03/19/google-app-starts-rolling-podcast-subscription-management/).
It was, but they added a bunch of new networks (NBA TV, Tennis TV among others), and hiked it to 40. I got it when it was still 35, and it's actually been pretty awesome.

It's hard to know with certainty what plans Google has for the future. With Crostini, it does appear that they're going to be launching some 'hardcore' features. For now, though, the focus is on the regular user.
Not yet, but there is [project Crostini](https://www.reddit.com/r/chromeos/comments/7ytpb1/project_crostini_linux_vms_on_chrome_os/) which should let you run Linux in a container, though there has been no official announcement about it.

Otherwise, there is always [Crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton), which is what I have to run IDEs.
No, not unless you tell us what kind of work you have in mind.
Okay, crarnberrypanda69.
There's no reason that we can't have all this without its being a corporatized billion dollar scam of an organization. A bunch of alumni feeling good about their schools isn't good enough reason to keep it going.
>it might be DP2 or maybe the beta like you said.

Or an experimental prototype that might never see the light of day. We won't know for sure till I/O. It'll be exciting to see some radical changes, that's for certain.
Yes, no other country has a system where schools make millions of dollars off the backs of unpaid 'student' athletes. It's a vile system, and I hope we don't fuck up other countries by spreading it.
About two weeks longer than for O. Not crazily so.

One thing that does support the gestures prediction, btw, is the fact that new screens fly in from the left on P. This indicates that you'd swipe left to go back, which is a bit contrary to expectation, and also perhaps one way to get around whatever patents Apple has.
If it's just a prototype floating around Google, these gestures might not make it in time for P. The beta release around I/O should reveal what's happening. Less than two months away.
Given how long the Oreo update is taking, it doesn't fill one with glowing optimism. Though, less snarkily, my point was that they're already thinking of P. Which is a good sign.
There's no evidence presented that it will progress to anything more than a warning dialog.
The biggest news here is that there will be an Android P update for some Samsung devices.
I don't know what this means, but I feel it.

It's fair to do the charge back, but you're not going to be able to force the company to do business with you again. When I do a chargeback, it's because I never want to deal with the company ever again.

AD didn't have the ball though. Do the same rules apply?
Tell AD to get smarter. Refs did the right thing. They ignored AD elbowing Danny Green in the face, so you have no leg to stand on.
He *was* fouled though, so there can't really be any real complaint about i. AD better know that he's a professional.

From the comments:

>I suspect they accepted the appeal, since several of my devices just got the 0.10.06 update via the play store.

EDIT: Appears that the problem was fixed on appeal essentially simultaneously with the developer posting this over-dramatic rant. 
It also ignores the part where the other biggest Trump critic is the reigning champ and also comfortably seeded for the playoffs.

Podcasts are actually separate from Play Music. They're powered directly by Search. To see this, just Google a podcast by name.

>That said, when it comes to third party app performance, the S9 should match, if not exceed the Pixel 2's performance. I've done a test on this 2 weeks ago.

My man, that test was with a Pixel 2016. 
Safari isn't available on Chrome OS, so not sure what that means.

There is no Chrome window or Chrome app on the Pixelbook. The entire OS is Chrome. So closing a window doesn't mean anything. Only rebooting does. On any other platform, closing all your Chrome windows amounts to exiting Chrome. On Chrome OS, it doesn't. 

One solution is to install an extension that will save your tabs state and recover it whenever you like. 
>I didn't realize the I7 was referred to as the Eve.

It is, but so is the i5. It's just the codename for all Pixelbooks. It's a Neon Genesis Evangelion reference, as are a bunch of the other Chromebooks (I think I saw an Asuka somewhere?).
Stay after what? Reboot? If you close the window, they go away. Unlike other platforms, where closing the browser windows counts as exiting the browser, on Chrome OS, everything is the browser (technically: these are the roots of the OS, even with Android apps). In other words, pinned tabs should survive reboots, but they will not survive you deliberately closing the browser window.
You could try Shirshak and see if it pulls it up.
Have you tried spelling the songname?
It does have that. That's what /u/armando_rod is talking about.
That's not really what we're talking about here.
Yes, someone else pointed this out as well. I guess I don't swipe that much, especially for the .com part of emails. Never encountered this issue for that reason.
No difference here between swiping and not swiping.

Very curious that this seems to not be a standard feature.
That's really weird. I never get an automatic space after any of my periods, and I've been using GBoard since its Google Keyboard days.
It doesn't appear all the time. Always been somewhat sporadic for me.
I think you're thinking of SwiftKey. GBoard doesn't automatically add a space after a period, which is one reason I switched from SwiftKey.
It's been around for a while.

Cool find! [This issue](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=813699) was also filed today.

That describes the life's work of Walter Bronhard.

This is definitely not true.

The test was actually done by David Pogue at Yahoo. This is just blogspam based on that.
Huh. Very interesting experiment.
That was a game 6, IIRC.
For me, functionally, it's a text messaging system that works over the internet. It's essentially an internet based phone service.
I don't need the VoIP thing, but it would be convenient on certain occasions. Don't really make that many calls to begin with.

I could desperately use OK Google and Auto support though. They've been promised for months, but still no progress.
But not to Google Voice. It's annoying how much of an afterthought that app is.
And are they fixing it or what? It's incredible that they'd just casually fuck up such a key feature.
I think Play Music is having issues with the cast protocol.
I'm having issues here as well. Ended up using YT Music instead.
Best two or even three in this case.
It's so annoying. Basically we won't know anything till the preview actually drops.
>Customer service told me to reset a few months ago.

Pro-tip: If Google CS tells you to try a factory reset, just tell them you did one already and that it didn't help. Hardware issues are rarely fixed by resets, but Google likes to make you jump through these hoops, hoping that you'll give up.
This article makes the notch support sound like a headline feature, when it's probably just a minor adjustment to the System UI to support new hardware paradigms. They talk about P being a big update and all they can give in support is the stupid notch thing and some pablum about the Assistant that is already true in O?

That's what happens when technology reports know nothing about their subject.
The patriarchy strikes again.
Right, that's the standard icon.
Don't forget Slo-Mo!
I agree that there should at least be a widget, but you can already set recurring reminders.
I'm not sure what the difference is.
You can ask Google to set reminders.
So just on this thread, there are *four* different icons/text that people are seeing 🤔
[Mine](https://i.imgur.com/c0TIDqg.jpg) looks different!
>says as that defaults to "(Refurbished)".

Don't think that's true. I've gotten new phones through RMA where the email didn't say (Refurbished), and they weren't refurbished.
That's just because 4.1-4.3 were all called Jelly Bean. JB was introduced at I/O 2012 on the OG N7 and 4.4 didn't come around till the N5 in Oct 2013. 
I have a 'Share place' button with a weird icon that replaced the standard share icon.
I also drink too much alcohol so that I can handle.

For your Instagram issue, install Photos Android app and share to Instagram from there. Very simple.

All my acquaintances use Hangouts, so it's never been a problem, but Duo is introducing Google account sign-in soon, so that should be fixed.
I use a Mac at work, and I'd like to have something like Spaces to organize my windows.
Wait, really?
Strange. My refurbished phones always arrived in generic packaging and a note explaining it was refurbished. Was the Pixel C packaging encased in plastic wrap and was it shipped by the Google Store?

I don't think it would be legal for them to not tell you that it is refurbished, especially if it's in retail packaging. What's preventing you from turning around and selling it as a brand new device? You can't tell without opening it!

EDIT: [Here](https://imgur.com/a/o3OXB) is the email I got when I got my refurbished phone. It explicitly says that the device is refurbished.
For people who call others snowflakes, you guys are awfully thin-skinned and victim-minded.

Also, I hope you were out there protesting on behalf of "free speech" when the NBA prevented its players from kneeling during the anthem. Somehow I doubt it.
>There's no need for Google anymore after how smooth Oreo is. 

This is gold.
Ask any Android developer about what they think about Samsung, and then get back to me. 

Also, have fun with your fantasy world where having by far the smoother software experience, and providing at least six months more of additional updates is equivalent to being kicked to the curb.

A bit more seriously, Samsung has introduced a lot of great features in their software: better screenshots and better handling of Bluetooth devices come to mind, but they have a history of fucking up basic Android APIs for no apparent reason. This shit isn't new.
Because it came in original packaging and didn't say it was refurbished. They're required to let you know if the device is refurbished, and such devices usually arrive in generic packaging, not the retail one.
I got a brand new one about a month ago.
Samsung's great developers strike again.
Most of these things aren't even that bad tbh.
Thanks for the unexpected bit of humor on this thread.
I really wonder if that dev was just trolling with that comment. Why would someone take it seriously? It's obviously a throwaway line.
>So from now on, I should just never close chrome and just shut down my chromebook

Yup.

>Sorry, I'm pretty new tbh

Not your fault. It's weird legacy behavior that's confusing and probably doesn't make sense any more for Chrome OS. I don't know if they're looking to change it any time soon.


The issue is that in Chrome OS, only shutting down the computer counts as closing Chrome. So you can't close windows and recover them on 'restart', because you're not really restarting anything there. If you reboot the computer with your tabs open, then they'll show up again as expected.
But what's the percentage at which it kicks in? Is that also standard? I'd imagine it's much lower for Apple than for others.
>  if we have a certain percent of the run that is bad, we don’t pay based on a pre determined agreement.

Yes, but how do you know what the pre-determined agreement was in this case? 
We have no idea what kind of deal Google has with LG. They definitely don't have anywhere near the leverage that Apple has with their suppliers.
What is even the point? Does Google have some long term plans that we don't know about?

Huh? You can always install Linux on a Chromebook simply by activating Dev mode. 

>The earlier Chromebooks are even faster than the newer ones, so its purely obsolescence by design.

This is just BS. Compare a Chromebook Pro to a Toshiba 2014 and then come back with this.
Gapless playback works fine for me here.
Play Music has the same feature.
Someone told me it was an in-house thing.
This is the most impressive part. The wires in my house are by far the ugliest thing around. 
Thanks for pointing this out.
You have this backwards. The audiobooks exist to augment the Home and Assistant experience, not the other way round. 

I for one never listened to audiobooks before they were introduced on Google Play. Now I can listen to them through Android Auto, and so can use them on my commute. ~~Audible still doesn't support Auto~~. This is wrong. Audible does indeed support Auto! 
>You can see/approve App permissions before installing an app

That's because the apps will ask you for the permissions at the time of use rather than up front. Apps that don't target 6.0+ still present all their permissions when you install them.

Weird that you would call this a *regression*.
Right, and that's great, but most people don't have the time nor the inclination for that kind of control. The service Google provides is great for us.
Maybe it takes a few minutes to process? Not sure. Food and Jars work, but other terms don't bring it up, though other pictures from the restaurant do show up for 'restaurant'.
>Don't post it, don't tag it, don't give it any info.

That's easy, because I never tag anything. 

>Then go do a search for food. See if it comes up.

It does. Every single food related picture, including [this one](https://imgur.com/a/y4rcI) that's a photo showing jars of pickle at a restaurant. This is one of the easier things for it to search for actually. They must have millions of photos of food.

Also, the location search is a little too scarily good. It pulls up scanned pictures of my father-in-law on Pier 39 from 40 years ago when I search for San Francisco. I've never tagged any of them.
>Google doesn't know how you'd categorize each photo. 

Yes, because I don't. It does it for me. 'Food' and 'parties' both yield great search results. All my photos are taken on my phones with High Accuracy location activated, so it's all catalogued perfectly well.

Once again, you obviously have organizational needs that are very specific. Most people, including me, don't. Google provides a great service for us.
But it *is* easily browsable and organized already, by location, date and people. All without me doing anything. That's my point. Your system is not necessary for everyone.
I suppose that's a valid distinction to some people. To me, it's just as good, and even better, since it requires me to do precisely nothing.
Why do all that work, when Google just takes care of it for me?
The Embiid tweet is what elevates this to art.
I used a small local company called Aucoin Construction for both our bathrooms. Was pretty happy with them. 
Fun fact about Engelland: his sons are named Press and Path. The Engellands will not use any name that cannot be found in a third-grade reader.

The Chromecast Audio is hooked up via HDMI? It doesn't have that connectivity.
It's not working on Beta yet.
All I can say is that I've met more interesting people in my short time in RI than in all my time anywhere else.

SMH, no one ever mentions [Jahangir Khan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahangir_Khan?wprov=sfla1) the real OG.

(Yeah yeah I know it's only Americans on this list, but this mofo literally didn't lose a single international squash game for *five* fucking years, and 555 matches. That's not even in the same realm as simply insane, it's galactically bonkers.)
Yeah, but he's still lapping his contemporaries like crazy. They also had the opportunity to rack up the same gold medals, but only Phelps actually did it.
Interesting. Just from my personal circle, it seems like a lot of people bought Echos over the holidays, and not many got Homes.

Also, all the Sergey Brins in that comments section hurt my eyes.
They're looking to satisfy a very limited need as a test of their on-device AI capabilities. I've said this before here (to little resonance, apparently): Google's looking to diversify its income streams to wean off its dependence on ads and their privacy-invading implications. One of their long term goals I'm sure is consumer products based on their machine learning prowess that only *they* can create. This is only the first tiny step towards that.
I was very excited about Wear when it came out in 2014, and at one point owned 4 of the devices. I still hold on to my OG Huawei Watch because it looks good, but the notification system is still shit (why no grouping??), it took literally 6 months for the 2.0 update to roll-out to it, and now it's been duly abandoned. 

Most damningly, I haven't worn my watch in 2 months and *don't miss it at all*. 

Having to buy a new watch every year to get the latest updates is a bit ridiculous, but I'd be okay with it if I felt like the platform was worth it to me. It just doesn't feel like it any more.

The last time Google explicitly talked about Wear in its I/O keynote was 2016, when they introduced what in hindsight seems like a half-assed attempt at an update in Wear 2.0. It was barely visible at I/O '17, and I'd be surprised if it has any prominence at I/O '18. 

All of the tech partners in Wear seem to have basically abandoned it, leaving only the fashion brands. There is no flagship Wear device, no presence in the media, no attempt to push anything visibly forward.

Doesn't fill me with optimism for the future of the platform
It's basically on life support. At this point, it's just a rump OS that luxury watchmakers can slap on their devices to make them 'smart'. Google seems to have given up on it.
This is a dead platform, unfortunately. As far as the world knows, this is the only person working on it. Google barely talks about it any more.
It's terrible.
Probably the Nexus Player: L to O, for better or worse.
I love Schwab Checking, but is it possible to have a checking account without an associated investment account?
"Read my book" works for the last book you were listening to on any device.

Haven't figured out how to get it to read some other book without first starting it on my phone and then saying "read my book".
As would anyone who has experienced the sulphurous air of Gary, IN. 
I have no idea what this comment is about, but with all these upvotes I'm sure it must be a good one!

EDIT: Seriously, WTF is going on this comment. I've been trying Google this for the past 30 minutes and [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/7iw6mo/hhh_secret_santa_mixtape_thread/dr4gq3i/) seems to be the first appearance of this pasta. Is there more to it??
It's ridiculous if Draymond makes it but LMA doesn't.
Somewhat (ir)relevantly, someone named Dwight Howard signed into my gym this morning. The person at the front desk didn't understand why I was so amused by this.

Have you used Squid? I don't sketch, but it works very well as a notepad.
That is orthogonal to this problem though, which is one device being shared by several accounts.
Or Serpico, or Dog Day Afternoon, or Scarface...

Just a fucking travesty.
The worst was Pacino for Scent of a Woman. What a travesty.
😍😍😍😍
It's really a pity, because the native touch keyboard is terrible.
Does this even work on Android?
I don't understand why they didn't just include one with the Pen.
Right, [this dude](https://twitter.com/adamac) advertises himself as developing Fuchsia at Google. 
Seems a little silly to claim that Google's developing this 'secretly' when you're literally exhibiting an early prototype of it.
It's really curious that scoring less reduces the probability that you will win. I think we need a deeper exploration of this phenomenon.
The article does have photos of the prototypes.
The data is explicitly *not* being uploaded to the cloud.
Apparently so. They also took my comment a lot more seriously than I did.
Who cares about numbers when you get blocked literally in the face.
They just stole this from [this article](https://design-milk.com/how-ivy-ross-helped-change-google-design/) that was already posted.
Goddammit. I just tried it and it worked. So much for that.
I can't get Google to play Kanye's Late from the album Late Registration. It always just plays the entire album. It used to work some time ago, but hasn't for the past few months.
You must have quads of steel.
Clips is just Google getting its feet wet with on-device, non-cloud based AI. They want to move away from profile-based advertising, along with all its gnarly privacy issues, as their main income source in the long run. This is just the first, tiny step in that direction. It's not meant to be an income generator.
WTF. How did you even find this?
I had a similar issue with my first Pen. The second one is perfect. Call Google for a replacement.
He's just so soft and cuddly that sitting on him makes hating more palatable.
The i7 is actually noticeably better, especially when going into Overview with many windows open. Thé i5 would hang regularly in this situation. The SSD makes a real difference, not to speak of the 16GB RAM. Surprisingly though, the Bluetooth is also significantly better. Hasn't failed on me yet.
It should have been clear that I was being facetious.
I dropped my i5 and a corner got dented, even though it was still in my laptop bag. But it had a bad touchpad, so I RMAd it for a new one. I've since sold it for an i7. But yes, it's pretty easily dentable.
Doesn't its keyboard have very polarized reviews? 
These are exactly my thoughts whenever I find one of these threads. 
>indefinitely better keyboards and track padd 

I have a MacBook Pro 2015 and this is definitely not the case.
How is he going to be fine with a random Chromebook with a crappy keyboard then? That doesn't make any sense. He clearly wouldn't be. It's the Pixelbook in particular that he's happy with.
That's your prerogative, obviously, but for someone who writes a lot, the keyboard might be the most important feature.
> So he'll be fine with pretty much any Chromebook...

You clearly didn't read the article. He specifically points out the keyboard and touchpad as being best in class.

[Pixel Buds Review: Pass](http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/11/15/google-pixel-buds-review-pass/)
Is this something that was added in iOS 11? I don't have it on my iPad.
None of these are as terrible on Android as you think: maybe half-a-second longer here or there, and that too, only because you're used to the swiping mechanism in iOS. I'm not, so it doesn't make any difference to me. As for chatting and redditing, the notification system on Android makes it much better *for me* to deal with both when compared to iOS. The inability for the OS to group messages from even a single conversation is a complete dealbreaker. I think this is much worse than any of your complaints. Once again, it's my perspective.

~~To get back to my example, file management is objectively miles ahead on Android compared to iOS. The scenario I pointed out is basically impossible to figure on my iPad~~

Looks like this is only because my iPad is super old at this point. Ignore.
Speed of tasks on each OS depends on the task in question. Try to attach a PDF from Dropbox to an email you're already writing, and let me know how long it takes on an iPad.
That must be why all my portraits look like Mexican fast food.
Cool. Those aren't really things I see myself needing, but obviously if you're used to them, it would be hard to not have them around.

BTW, I've set it up on Squid so that my finger erases. It works really well!
But Rondo *wants* those assists. Doesn't that make him selfish for assists?
What a fucking baller!
We went to Bravo Brasserie today after braving the active shooter situation at the mall. Turned out they have a weekly Monday night special as well, which was a better deal than the restaurant week menu: $34 for a two course meal for two with a bottle of wine. Great deal!

We're trying Persimmon next. Been meaning to go there for a while.

It's crazy how many choices there are in a city this size.
My wife and I walked into the mall just as people were being mildly encouraged to evacuate. Everyone was calm and slightly amused (or maybe that's just me projecting). We walked around for 5 minutes and then left through the Omni.
Google China maps offset. Among other things, you should find the following Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restrictions_on_geographic_data_in_China?wprov=sfla1
That discrepancy is a deliberate act by Google to conform with Party directives.
Just curious: what features are missing in Squid when compare to LectureNotes?
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
I have multiple Homes and Chromecasts in my house and it's been totally fine. People with issues are going to be very loud about it. That doesn't mean it's widespread.
They have a winning record against the Eastern conference!
Did you set up Google Assistant on the iPhone? https://support.google.com/googlehome/answer/7535860?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&hl=en
There is, and it's decent, though not as easy to use on such a big screen.
I have 11 Chromecast capable devices (Homes, Android TVs, Chromecast Audios) and 5 Android devices. It's just a 3 bedroom house 😆

FWIW, my wife thinks I'm deranged to have this arrangement.
I got like 15 of these on my network. Seems fine.
😢
It's an asinine exception in the first place. Why can't non-profits pay the same taxes everyone else does? I'm having trouble imagining why one would want to incentivize property ownership by churches and universities.
No way, dude. He made that one with basically the entire Heat team challenging him. Also, he was carrying a semi-full head of hair with a much tinier baldspot.
I'm pretty happy with GBoard on my Android devices. The one on Chrome OS is *much* worse. Among other things, the autocorrect is complete ass. It would be a better keyboard without any.
I don't understand how his head stays supported by those tiny shoulders. It's worrisome.
It's an incredible device, but there are two downsides as a tablet:

1. Android apps still can't be used side by side. This should be fixed by an update in the next couple of months.

2. The onscreen keyboard *suuuucks*. It's just terrible. I hate hate hate using it. I have no idea if this is going to be fixed any time soon.

I use tablet mode mainly to take notes in Squid with my Pen and to watch movies. Both these things work really well.
[It's this one, actually](https://youtu.be/xDa5dpHzvTY).
Have you tried using the Pen with Squid? It's basically replaced all my notepads now.
Crouton works very well for me. No issues here with xiwi.
I'm not angry. I'm totally incensed.
How about fixing the fucking share icon? How about that?
The Bluetooth is much more solid and it doesn't hang when Alt-Tabbing.
The struggle is definitely real.

Or: you are an unusual edge case that they haven't thought to optimize for. Have you left feedback? There's not much point in complaining about it here.
Patty is just trash tonight. WTF was that?
It's been updated sporadically, but it was still targeting Gingerbread up to the latest one.
Chromecast groups have been funky for me for a while. Try restarting your router.
At least with the camera, opening it up to other phones brings with it the additional headache of supporting those devices. This is probably a non-trivial concern for such a hardware dependent app.
It really depends on what your work situation is. I commute to Boston from Providence precisely because we never liked Boston that much, and it's just ridiculously expensive for what it offers, especially given what we were used to in Chicago. We found a place on the East side for about half the price of what it would have cost in any reasonable part of Boston, 15 minute walk from downtown, 15 minute walk from Brown, 7 minute walk from the train station. It's awesome.

We've also found it much easier to make friends in Providence. Boston's full of annoying yuppies and feckless academics, and inordinately cliquish.

It's a much more relaxed life here, and it has quite a bit to offer for a city its size, especially when it comes to access to good food and drink. 

We don't have kids, but I've started looking into daycare options for our (near?) future hypothetical child, and they're substantially cheaper than what our friends in Boston/Cambridge are footing. I haven't looked into schools that much, but we've heard that K-5 is basically fine. 

The labor market is weak. On the other hand, MA has plenty of jobs on offer, and, if you have a job near downtown Boston, then the commute can be pretty decent on the MBTA. I think over the next decade or so, more and more young families are going to get priced out of the Boston area and find their way down here. 
Do you have the link to that thread?
Yeah, I'm running the same beta build on both. It's definitely curious.
Nope, that's not it. Am running 64 on both.
My gawd. This is the funniest thing I've seen this week. 
Yeah, I read all of that. Doesn't seem enough to justify the headline. 
What's the revamp here exactly? 
Overview is janky on every ChromeOS device. They just haven't optimized it enough.
If I have a few windows and Android apps open on it, then doing the three finger Overview sometimes freezes the i5 for a few seconds at a time. It's still janky on the i7, but it hasn't frozen on me yet.
> Almost everything you hear about the Timberwolves on national media is just parroted narrative with very little substance.

That's because everything on the national media is parroted narrative with little substance.
They're running the same version of the OS. I just got the i7 to see if there's substantial difference in performance. It's definitely smoother and doesn't hang like my i5 does sometimes. This Bluetooth thing is a big plus. I think I'm going to keep the i7 and sell the i5. I'm getting the i5 RMAd anyway for touchpad issues, so I'll probably sell the replacement as soon as I get it.
Running the same versions actually. It's weird.

Small nitpick: He was actually in the Punjab region, which is in the north*west*.
Is this both on the Android app and the website?
I was all ready to facetiously complain about how Manu wasn't included, but now I can only mournfully whisper, ^he's ^Argentinian.

Fun read though.
I'm genuinely trying to disabuse you of bad information. Here's the relevant extract from Wikipedia if you need more convincing.

>At Google I/O 2014, a proof of concept showing Android applications, including Flipboard, running on Chrome OS was presented. In September 2014, Google introduced a beta version of the App Runtime for Chrome (ARC), which allows selected Android applications to be used on Chrome OS, using a Native Client-based environment that provides the platforms necessary to run Android software. Android applications do not require any modifications to run on Chrome OS, but may be modified to better support a mouse and keyboard environment. At its introduction, Chrome OS support was only available for selected Android applications.

>In 2016, Google introduced the ability to run Android apps on supported Chrome OS devices, with access to the entire Google Play Store. The previous Native Client-based solution was dropped in favor of a container containing Android's frameworks and dependencies (initially based on Android 6.0), which allows Android apps to have direct access to the Chrome OS platform, and allow the OS to interact with Android contracts such as sharing. Engineering director Zelidrag Hornung explained that ARC had been scrapped due to its limitations, including its incompatibility with the Android Native Development Toolkit (NDK), and that it was unable to pass Google's own compatibility test suite.

It's impossible that there was any mention of container based Android apps before 2016, because that's the first time they were revealed. They were first released for a select few Chromebooks like the Pixel 2015, and then only much later for other models.

Edit: by the way, you still haven't mentioned which Chromebook you're talking about here. 
Having a debate about verifiable facts is pointless. You are talking about an entirely different way of introducing Android apps, which involved each vendor repackaging their APK using something called ARC or App Runtime for Chrome. It wasn't direct container based access to Play Store apps, which was introduced only in 2016 and is what people talk about now, when they talk about Android apps for Chrome OS. 

In particular, with the ARC system, very few apps were available, and what was available was actually usable on every Chrome OS device, and in fact with some mods, on every device running Chrome. Google decided that wasn't scalable. If a particular Chromebook was promised Android apps, then that would have only happened after I/O 2016.
Maybe you could mention which Chromebook it was, so we can direct our outrage appropriately. Also, it was actually 2016, so you were even further off.
Great for older folks like my parents.
That totally seems like it would be worth $85 million.
I love it. The Pixelbook is my default notebook now, with Squid as the notetaking app.
That would be unlikely, given that Android apps for Chrome OS were only announced at I/O ~~2015~~ 2016.
Haha! This is awesome!
Yeah, it's really annoying. I've been saying this over on /r/Android and getting downvoted.
All those things you mentioned, except for some third party integrations like August Smart Lock, already work for me and have for a while. I will note that such integrations didn't work on the phone Assistant for at least a few months after they were introduced on the Home.
I guess it was a controlled roll-out? Rather strange, especially since the last Auto update wasn't that recent.
Is Kawhi okay? He looks like he's falling asleep on the bench.
See the edit to my previous comment. It could just be that third-party apps don't work yet. Direct integrations like Hue do. 
Through the head unit.
I don't know dude. I've been able to turn off lights and ~~check on my August lock on Auto~~. Don't think regular Google voice search can do that.

Okay, for the sake of science, I went downstairs and tried this in the car again just to make sure. The lights worked, but I was told that 'August is not supported on this device'. Seems to me that's confirmation that it *is* a version of Assistant, but not one that supports third party integrations yet. This is how the Assistant on the phone was for the first couple of months.

The Verge doesn't always know what it's talking about.
Yes, home control works on Auto already.
It's not different. Auto already has Assistant.
I'm pretty sure what I already have *is* in fact Assistant. It has the male voice that I've assigned to Assistant, and can do literally everything shown in the videos.
I don't see how this is different than what's already available. Is this really new?
I've had this in my Mazda 3 ever since I installed Auto in it. I know it's Assistant, because it uses the male voice that I've chosen for it on my Homes.
Yeah, it's not clear what the OP is referencing here with the link. Wallet integration has been around for a couple of months now.
It's been available on Auto for a while now. It's not new.
Casting for Amazon apps is likely up to Amazon to implement, so I can't ask that of Google. Though it seems like they're taking a tougher line about this with Amazon recently.
In general, Google doesn't seem to realize that audio is Home's killer feature. Everything involving it is half-baked:

1. Have something playing on one speaker. I say 'Play this song on <some other speaker or group>'. Nope, can't do it. Have to specify what the song is all over again.

2. Chromecast audio groups are broken. There is a known issue where I have to restart my router every morning. Otherwise, Home says it's playing something, but it just quietly doesn't.

3. No way to manage playlists once something starts playing. Why can't I just open up Play Music on my phone and see what the next song will be?

4. As discussed in this thread, the podcasting experience is godawful. They really need an API for apps like PocketCasts to integrate into Home, so I don't have to rely on Google's supercrappy implementation.

5. No audiobooks. Enough said.
Except that the blog post says nothing about Wallet.
Maybe they'll replace him with someone who can actually do their job.
Somehow, you still seem to believe that ["this crap"](https://i.imgur.com/fAlCKtY.jpg) is worse than having an uninvited message in your list of conversations. Most people would disagree.
You only copied *one* of the pictures. Rather disingenuously.
Your screenshot is misleading: that screen only pops up after you agree to a much tinier pop-up at the bottom. 
A piece of misguided snark that has been inexplicably upvoted?
This isn't an ad. It is asking, fairly discreetly, about your experience with something you're actually using. What exactly is the complaint here? I don't get it.
Fuck no.
Yup, same here. Don't have the update though.
Same here. Hated it.
I use tablet mode for watching videos and for writing in Squid. Otherwise, no.
Do you see any obvious improvements in performance? I'm most interested in how smoothly the Overview works when you have a lot of windows and Android apps open. The i5 stalls frequently, and I'm hoping the increased RAM and faster storage on the i7 will help with that.
Why am I lauded for being the king of poops? The numbers say otherwise.
Restart your router and see if the issue persists.
I recommend waiting for the Pixel 11.
Could you post the Chrome OS version as well?

For reference, here are the numbers for the i5 version, running Dev 64.0.2328.41.

Octane 2.0: 28905

Peacekeeper: 5346

WebXPRT 2015: 544 ± 10

Speedometer 1.0: 134 ± 3.6

ARES 6: 29.65 ± 1.22 

Jetstream 1.1: 159.44 ± 21.333

As you can see, the numbers, except for Octane and Jetstream, are actually better on the i5. I suspect this is due to the fact that I'm running a later version of the OS.
Be careful. The listing has the following caveat:

>SquareTrade Protection Plans are only valid for new products purchased at Amazon within the last 30 days
It's ridiculous how little Ron understands about the actual workings of the technology he writes about. This is not the first time he's made such an obviously false assertion, and with such confidence.
>This isn't a bug, it's working as intended.

Exactly.
What the actual fuck
The most flabbergasting thing is how easy he makes it look. But then you look at his legs, and they're basically a blur as he accelerates to the rim.
Quit projecting.
I'm referring to the syncing capability. We don't know what goes into making it as seamless as it is. It's not inconceivable that this is a hardware related feature.
*patiently waits to be told when to look*
No, it's a software mod.
No idea, but I think they have the same entertainment console, so I don't think it should be any different. Took me 10 minutes to do it.
The CC audio was built specifically to be grouped with others. You want them to retroactively upgrade the hardware on the regular Chromecast?
I installed a mod on my Mazda 3 to be able to use it, and I love it. The Maps and music interfaces are so much better than the regular system. There are no weird Bluetooth issues. Since it's a mod and not an official version, there are some glitches that I tolerate, but nothing terrible.
On the contrary, there should have been no room for a loss in this game.
Any accessibility setting, in my experience, has the tendency to slow the phone down.
You need a phone to set it up.
I'm not a Russ fan, but no guard does this better. Electrifying.
Yup, it seems like a problem with Google search in general.
Okay, I must have a bum one then.
Look at the current top rated comment.

EDIT: When I wrote this, the comment was 'Lol denying the truth classic israshit', which still has plenty of upvotes. I realize one can argue that 'Israel'!='Jewish', but IMO, the underlying tone of this comment is problematic.
Are you having issues clicking on the touchpad (not tapping)? I'm finding it very hard to select or drag and drop things.
Segues, not Segways. Confused the fuck out of me.
That's nothing. One time I was simply thinking about something and autocomplete came up with it out of nowhere. Spooooooky.
You do realize that, even if 5% of the country can afford the Pixel, then that's 70 million possible customers? That's a bigger potential market than basically any developed country apart from the US.
>guy is a stubborn old man who never changes out of his military system

Of all critiques, saying that Pop never changes his system is the stupidest. What are you even saying here?
All of what things? I'm saying it doesn't compute my current tax liability correctly, so it doesn't give me a good idea of how much of a cut I'll be cutting next year, if indeed I'll b getting a cut.
Depends. At a marginal rate of 25%, and in a state with high-ish income and property taxes, it can be quite substantial (as long as you're not hitting the AMT). The doubling of the standard deduction hides the fact that the personal exemptions are being eliminated entirely: For a family of three, there is essentially a *negative* change in deductions+exemptions. Of course the reduction in marginal rates should alleviate this a bit.
Actually, a number of apps are having this issue, including Sync for Reddit.
But it doesn't even apply to income taxes, as long as it's on 2017 income. At least, as far as I can tell.
I just did exactly that, so hopefully that is indeed the case.
I'm confused by this. Taxes on 2017 income, if paid before Jan 1, 2018, should be deductible on my 2017 return right? The prepayment clause here only applies to payments towards *next* year's taxes.
Dude, just take the L. The difference in convenience is massive.
That caveat can be very important for some people (it is for me).
This depends on where you live, what deductions you usually took, whether you're single or married... Many factors!
If you do so, then AFAIK if one person itemizes, both must. That could eat into your wife's deduction.
Yup.
https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/tax-bill-2017/card/1513382086

Because that comment was in response to something I said.
You are weirdly obsessed with equating this with schizophrenia.
That argument is not convincing. The Prime video app is available for phones and tablets, and lets you purchase content without Google ever knowing about it, let alone getting a cut from it.
First impressions: hate it. 
The Pixel 2 XL with the iPhone X's screen and haptic feedback.
I would have thought MJ came the closest to playing like MJ. But what do I know.
It just ended with me saying 'pus pus pus'.
As they say, jonesty is the best wholicy.
Looks like a bunch of birdpoop tbh. Maybe make the circles a bit bigger?
It does auto-tethering with my Pixel 2. It's not the same as having LTE, but it's better than having to get my phone out every time.
I had the Pixel C as well. It's just not comparable in terms of getting stuff done, though the keyboard snapping in and out feels really sweet and well done. It was great for media consumption, and the odd email or short document here and there, but not so great on the productivity end of things. It's certainly nowhere near a good laptop replacement. The one thing that it has that the Pixelbook still doesn't is the ability to view two apps at once in tablet mode. It should be rolling in though in the next few weeks.
I've asked them about this on Twitter, and they said that they're waiting on Google to release an API for this.
Xodo, the Android app.
One could argue that Jordan didn't have to switch teams to get his fellow All Stars.
I just use an adapter. Seems to work decently. I agree that it's a step down from the LS in that respect. Don't miss the fan noise and random squealing beneath the keyboard though.

I was worried about the reduced RAM, but it's been okay so far. The i7 version is still MIA, but the i5 is working out pretty well, so I'll probably hold on to this for a while.
Oh yeah, I totally forgot the lightness. It's awesome! I run a slightly more complicated setup with Crouton and Sublime Text, but everything is synced through Dropbox and Drive (no different than my MacBook in that respect). Speaking of, I left my (new) MBPro behind, and I don't think I'll miss it at all.
I've literally never had this happen.
I'm not sure why you were having issues with song skipping. I haven't had any problem with that.
Why the fuck are they negotiating new deals when they already have deals in place for GPM?

If it's true that the Play Music team has been absorbed by YouTube, then I guess we're never going to see a reworked UI for the app. 
Alright, who let Kim Kardashian run Google? Confess yourself!
The issue is that the podcast isn't playing from Play Music, but rather from Google search (yeah, it doesn't make sense). This doesn't yet support Chromecast audio.

What they need is a media API, so that apps like Pocket Casts can be used.
I have a different issue where audio group play just fails silently, meaning Home says 'Playing blah from blah on blah group', but nothing happens. The only thing that fixes it is a network reboot.
Haha, was not expecting that. 
This sub gets into circlejerks. It's in one now over the Pixel Buds. 
> Why not just add forwards and backwards swiping..

It's not precise enough for that. If you're trying to call Assistant, or pause, or check on your notifications, and your touch gets interpreted as a swipe, it would be super annoying to skip a song you didn't want to skip.
I like mine. Assistant works really well, and I find myself being able to do a lot of things without getting my phone out, especially when it comes to music and responding to texts and calls. They probably aren't worth their price to the average person though, and they're definitely not as convenient to take on and off as the AirPods.
 
Oh, and skipping tracks requires a voice command, but it's really seamless, and works with a whisper. Still a bit inconvenient of course.
Leave Messenger feedback and tell them to support Share Targets. They've had two years to do it now.
Well, there is the option to use the Voice app now. I've been trying it out for the past week or so. It's noticeably faster than Hangouts, but doesn't support Notification Bundling or Share Targets yet. It is supposed to get voice command support soon though, which will be a huge plus when compared to Hangouts. Also, it supports GIF insertion unlike Hangouts (for Voice messages).
Amazon is just shady now. Very disturbing anti-consumer stuff. 

You should contact the media about this. 
Cool. There should be a keyboard shortcut to bring this up.

You mean double double.
Yeah, I saw someone suggest that earlier and it did fix the issue.
Huh, force stopping did help. So weird.
Yeah, I'm having the same issue. I've left some feedback, but not sure what else to do.

The same thing also works on a lot of Android devices as well.
>He's not even considered the majority GOAT,

Says who? 

He played at a time when wickets were much less friendly to batsmen and completely annihilates any one else's numbers, past or present. Sure, he doesn't have Gretzky's longevity, but keep in mind that he would have played a lot more games had World War II not intervened. I mean his numbers don't make any sense. It's like he's from a different planet.
'Play *whatever* in the Kitchen' is very useful when your hands are dirty or you're just doing other things. If you don't think that is worth $29, then I don't know what to tell you.

Look up Don Bradman. 

Edit: from the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Bradman?wprov=sfla1)

>Bradman's Test batting average of 99.94 has become one of cricket's most famous, iconic statistics. No other player who has played more than 20 Test match innings has finished with a Test average of more than 61.

Basically, he's 63% better than any other human being who has been a batsman in cricket, a sport played by almost 2 billion people (most of whom admittedly live in the Indian subcontinent).

Live in New England, hate the Celtics and just about every other Bostonian team because Boston sucks. Just a little hick town that's full of itself and is only propped up by Harvard and MIT.

How easy is it to install Google apps on one?
I'm not going to argue this that much, but I think you're severely underestimating the amount of work it takes to fasten on a completely different operating system onto another. MS still hasn't figured out how to integrate UWAs with legacy applications seamlessly and it's been half-a-decade at this point. A year and a half is not very much in that scheme of things. Were you promised Android apps within a specific timeline? Did the manual or packaging say: 'Android apps coming soon!' I genuinely don't know. What I know is that there are several devices on the market that do have Android apps, and they still aren't that seamless, and they still aren't that stable. They work, but it's clunky and I don't expect it to get very seamless in the near term.
>Perfectly powerful devices get abandoned for no particular reason.

How so? They still get OS updates. People who bought them weren't promised Android apps for the most part.
I'm surprised at all these people here who prefer Rasoi to India. I've had much better experiences at India. The service is much better and they actually have interesting stuff on their menu, and not just the same old boring fare.
I don't even have to go half as far back to find a much more horrific mass shooting (shootingS really) in the USA that were committee with legally acquired  weapons that fantasy rescuers like you weren't able to stop. What does that prove?
I don't understand how that's a viable argument when mass shootings happen all the time with legally acquired weapons. Case in point: 58 deaths in Vegas just weeks ago.
>For example, "'gun free' zone" means that while I'm carrying peaceably but in technical violation of the law, I risk jail time for trying to save your life.  If you and I could have a conversation while a violent criminal is repeatedly impaling you with a 12" chef knife, would you be opposed to me using my gun to stop your attacker? If you enjoy the feel of cold steel transecting your spleen, and want any potential rescuer to spend some time in prison, go ahead and support "gun free" zones.

Right, because the Japanese are getting their spleens cut open on a daily basis because of their strict gun laws 🙄. I don't know what fantasies of being a rescuer you want to live out, but I'd be more than happy to never be near them.
And it's always a stupid argument, because it boils down to: why have laws? Criminals are going to break them anyway.
Maybe you should include a link to the app in your post?
Google doesn't give a shit about Android Wear now. It's a team of two people on the roofdeck with the Android TV engineers and the intern running Hangouts. 

Home, on the other hand, they actually want to turn into a line of business.

If being the biggest tech company (and the second biggest overall) in the world isn't giving you enough resources to run a good enough backend, then something is seriously wrong with your organization.

I'm saying for me there is no better alternative in this price range.
I have both the Pixelbook and the 2015 MacBook, and much prefer working on the Pixelbook (with Crouton for Sublime Text). I don't need 80% of the features that the MacBook has, and they just get in the way, but I like working with premium hardware. Also, the tablet convertibility is actually really awesome. I'm using it as my notebook as well now.

Basically, I can afford having it, and I like having it, so I have it. I wouldn't recommend it to most people, unless they have a clear idea of what they're getting out of it.

There is a known issue with Chromecast audio groups. When this happens, I have to restart my WiFi network. Call Google support just so they know that this is a prevalent issue.

To see if you have this issue, try playing on just one speaker. If that works, then you have this known issue.

Was anyone else expecting a takedown of the Better Business Bureau?
In the time it took you to write this long repsonse, you could have easily found a laptop with comparable hardware selling at a price much lower than the Pixelbook's. If such a thing actually existed. Your claim was that Google should sell this for $400, which, as I pointed out, was completely ridiculous. Now you're just trying to bloviate your way out of that assertion.

FWIW, I already have the Pixelbook and Pen, and they're awesome, though I'm not satisfied so far with battery life.
>And you can find this hardware for much cheaper than $1k

Then you shouldn't have too much trouble finding an example of such a machine. But you can't, because you're full of crap.
You're delusional if you think this hardware can be obtained for that price.

So you seem to agree that there are quite a few ways in which the XPS is worse. Also, I run IDEs via Crouton on my Pixel LS and intend to do so on the Pixelbook as well. Works pretty well for me and I don't have to compromise on hardware quality or access to a non-battery killing version of Chrome.
Fair enough, but if I'm paying $1000 I'd rather have the hardware on the Pixelbook and install Crouton on it (which is what I'm doing).
That still doesn't fix the keyboard and touchpad, though.
>For $1000, an XPS 13/15 is better in every single way.

Judging by the keyboard and touchpad on my wife's XPS, this is far from true. Also, Windows just sucks. I hate having to use it and its messed up updates system, and weird schizophrenic settings.

There is no way to do this without compromising two-factor security. Either you have security or you don't.

Yeah, any Chromebook allows use of multiple displays at the same time. It was the case that Android apps didn't interact well with this, but that's now been fixed.
Same.
At the end of the day, the fact is that this is at best a so-so screen on what's supposed to be a flagship device. Personally, I don't care so much. I'm concerned more with the camera and the software, which are both stellar, but it's clear that Google (yes, Google, not LG) dropped the ball here. If they'd just sourced their screens from Samsung like last year, they would have hit this out of the park.

To echo the first comment there, in my experience these reps don't know squat, so I'd take this to mean roughly bupkiss.
>If I buy a new Chromebook, I want it to have Windows support (community).

That's a different explanation then, and one that I can understand.

Doubt it's going to happen any time soon, however.
You're asking about devices that have Windows drivers, which, since the Pixel doesn't, implies that you're asking about other Chromebooks. These Chromebooks have Android apps, so your response to the parent comment doesn't make sense.
Are you talking about the 2013 Pixel? That seems like a weird thing to say considering you're asking for features available on *other* devices.
Thanks.

It's been okay on my Pixel LS. I'm using a Bluetooth mouse and headphones right now with no issues. Smart Lock on the other hand has been totally useless. On the other hand, Bluetooth on my Windows laptop isn't any great shakes either.
How can one website have so much trash?

Mods, is it possible to just ban links to this piece of shit 'magazine' entirely?
I know how that works :) They've actually ported that system over to Android as well now. My Pixel phone updates in the background, though it's sometimes very clear that something's taking up resources while that's happening.
Never had this issue. Also, the restart after the update isn't super extra long like it is on Windows.
Updates on the Pixel phone happen in the background as well, so not a problem.
I have an SSD too. That's not the issue. The issue is that it thinks it's okay to stop me from getting to my work just because it needs to install an update I didn't ask for.
Don't know why you got downvoted, but this seems like the most reasonable explanation.
I was seriously unhappy when I posted this. I was in the middle of finishing up some work (my poor LS's screen met an untimely demise recently, so I'm stuck with this Dell for the time being), and the damn thing froze and restarted, and wouldn't let me get back to work for 10 whole minutes. I mean, WTF?! I have a deadline to hit.
Google decides to make Allo default texting app, making it work seamlessly through Google Play Services.

WhatsApp and Telegram see this and say 'Hey, Google's using its ill-begotten power over the Android ecosystem to privilege their messaging app over us! Stop them!'

European Commission agrees with them and fines Google yet again. 

Doesn't really seem that unlikely, given how they've been pretty sympathetic to arguments that Google is unfairly getting OEMs to privilege its Search and Maps services using its Play Store hegemony.
Up to $1 can mean anything.
What's the price difference? I trust Google's lot more than I do Amazon when it comes to support for Google products.
Main difference is that my Pixel currently has a busted screen 😜

Also, I like the convertible form. The same incident that busted my LS also took care of my tablet.
I don't care about the i7, but I don't really want to downgrade from the 16GB I have on my LS right now.
Everything is a reason to moan here.
That's probably part of the reason Duo's only a fallback to ViLTE. Also, it only works if the other party also has Duo installed.
I would think it's less about the carriers and more about anti-trust issues, especially in Europe. Even this, they're only doing on Pixels and Nexuses for now.
Yup, see the same lag here.
What carriers even have ViLTE?
>weird shape, nipple

Phrasing!
That's an argument against doing anything today then. It will invariably look gross in tomorrow's technology. 

If every photo is producing a 3 second 4k clip at the same time, there's not going to be much room left on your phone for anything else. Granted, they could give you the option of doing 4k Motion Photos if you're so inclined, but if that leads to development overhead, I'd rather have this than wait for them to give me 4k.
I'm not surprised. The main utility of these things is to tell you something more about the moment than the still photo can. They're not meant to be full-fledged videos. I very much like looking at Live Photos that my friends take on their iPhones, and am looking forward to being able to do it on my Pixel 2 (when it gets here... at some point).
What's the resolution on Apple's Live Photos?

My plan for now is to buy the 128GB i5 and then sell it when the i7 goes up for sale. Don't anticipate much loss in resale value given the experience with the Pixel LS.
Yup :(

As far as I can tell, it connects with your phone directly, but not to the internet.
Which is weird, because the OG Huawei is still the best Wear device I've seen. Too bad Wear itself is a dumpster fire now.
3 years. It ends on January 15, 2021. Of course, if you buy it later down the line, then it'll be less than that.
Doesn't work :( Just plays from the Home.
Okay, will try that and report back.
No, I haven't used any of the recent Chromebooks, so no idea what the difference will be. I plan to use it for the 2 week return period and see how it goes. Hopefully by that point the i7 will be available.
Huh! Gotta try that, but what I really want is group audio, so I can play a podcast throughout the house.
They need an API that audio services can hook into. I asked Pocket Casts about Home support, and that's what they're looking for.
Can you also ask them about podcasts on Chromecast Audio?
I would dole out for the full max version, but it's not available. I don't really care about storage space, so I just pre-ordered the $999 one with the $249 protection plan. The only thing that I'm leery about is going from 16GB to 8GB RAM.
Well, I dropped my LS and busted the screen, so... 

I would have waited for the i7 with the 512GB Nvme otherwise.
No, thanks for reminding me again. 
I prefer Chrome OS. Never really got used to OS X. I could get one from work for free, but haven't bothered yet. Oh, and also Chrome on OS X is significantly less battery efficient, and I'd rather not divide up my browsing usage on my phone and laptop by using Safari.
I use mine as my primary computer. I have Ubuntu running under Crouton just to use Sublime Text. Mostly I just love the premium touchpad, keyboard and screen, and the awesome browsing experience. Is it worth the money to the average person? Probably not. Is it worth it to me? Yes.
I doubt I heard anything special, but it's supposed to be always-on (you can also choose when it's on) and works completely offline, without phoning home to Google. I think Google's experimenting with these small scale things (like the Clips camera), so it can have products that work without the cloud and without the accusation that they're spying on you.
AFAIK, the portrait mode on the 2 is based on the dual pixel sensor which the 1 doesn't have. Not sure if that's also the case for front-facing.
I wish it would integrate with Pocket Casts, or even the podcasts on Play Music. The way it is now, I can't play on any of my Chromecast Audios, so no group play through the house.
Not surprised. It's a bust. I haven't worn my Huawei Watch in two months, and I rarely miss it.
People forget that only the Nexus 4 and 5 were priced like mid-tier devices. The mythical Nexus-y Google is a memory shaped mainly by the popular 5 and the Nexus 7 tablets (both circa 2013), with little else to support it.
>A friend of mine called Google Support and they assured him ALL Pixelbook models are NVMe storage

Hmm... Wonder if there's some other way to confirm this.
It was first mentioned in May 2016, so, okay, it's been over a year. But 'years' makes it sound like we're fans waiting for GRR Martin to finish the Winds of Winter (goddamn you GRRM).
You can't get to Marshmallow without Lollipop. Software development doesn't happen in a vacuum.
Buggy != pointless. It was a significant update for many reasons. Marshmallow was the clean-up update.

[According to an engineer who worked on the buds](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15404918), you can do it on my 6.0+ Android phone, but you need the Pixel buds.
What? They reworked the whole UI. It was pretty buggy (don't miss you memory leak!), but it was the start of where Android's interface is now.
They have nowhere near the volume that Apple has. I'm guessing this is being sold close to cost.

At least, USB C is some kind of open standard, and there should be third-party dongles available soon.
The L release video was the best one yet.
Looking 5-10 years into the future (which I'm certain Google is), advertising is going to become less and less lucrative, as cost per click continues its steady downward trajectory and as native advertising sucks up all the oxygen in the room. Google needs a plan B. That's the hardware, that's the Assistant and that's Google Cloud. They *need* these bets to become profitable at scale and quickly. We'll see what happens.
You're viewing this wrong. Google wants to have a revenue stream that's *not* advertising. That's the whole point of their hardware ecosystem. Look at Clips: all the machine learning happens on device and nothing is dependent on the cloud. That's where Google wants to go, but at a much larger scale. The Assistant is collecting data to make *that* future happen.
The Assistant is their real flagship product. Everything else is just a vehicle for it.
It's probably because they had 'High priority only' turned on for notifications.
No, those were stealth launched and available same day. I had the 2015 LS two days after it was announced.

It's sad how much Google fucked up the head start it had with Gchat. Ten years ago everyone I knew was on it. If Google had given it some attention and not let Gundotra fuck it up with the botched conversion to Hangouts (I mean, how incompetent were these people to screw up so badly?), they would have had at least some chance of being a player in messaging. As it stands, they're nowhere in the picture.

Completely tangential mini-rant, but when did people start using 'As far as' in this way? It makes me want to scratch the insides of my brain. Where is the goddamn verb, goddammit??! Don't leave me hanging.
[But it has.](http://turnto10.com/news/local/general-assembly-approves-car-tax-legislation)
The point is that it's Amazon who fucked up, not Google.
If Amazon was violating YouTube API usage rules on the show, as some have suggested, then it's pretty justifiable.
It's a hub for connected home devices that can be controlled via SmartThings. It just works through the Shield instead of as a stand alone.
>Google pulled YT from Echo Show because it will launch a similar device codenamed Manhattan

That doesn't make any sense. By that logic, no phone or TV device aside from Google's should have YouTube on it.
I mean Amazon doesn't even allow Chromecasts to be listed on their website. They also didn't release Amazon Prime Video on the Play Store in the US till a month ago. They go out of their way to make sure that the APKs from the Shield don't work on other Android TV devices. They have no leg to stand on.
So... This will be a tablet with Google Assistant and better speakers?
At $15, it's pretty much a no-brainer. Pre-ordered.
Isn't that supposed to be phased out over the next five years?
Wonder if he's getting paid for this? That OK Google interaction was smoother and faster than it ever is on my phone.
For me, it's Sublime Text
Yup, took me a while to figure it out, but that did the trick.
The Shield is the only thing connected to the TV, apart from the soundbar.
The CEC thing is borked with my LG. It kept turning off every 4 seconds. Had to turn it off.
Pretty sure this update broke my Shield. It keeps going to sleep every 4 seconds, and now is completely unresponsive.
The word 'jam' appears about 25 times too many for me to take this seriously.
That's very strange then. My wife and I are certainly able to play on different Google Homes simultaneously. Might be worth a reset.
Yeah, but phoning back home all the time *definitely* would kill the battery.
It just shows up as an image or GIF.
WhatsApp does support this.
Hey, did you know that Bill Gates uses a freaking Android? What a champion!
Free brownies every Wednesday afternoon would be a good start.
Have you set up Multi-User?
Apple's been killing it on processor speed for almost 5 years now. This ain't something that happened today.
The iPhone has been better for quite some time now in the sheer horsepower department. Ever since the A5, basically.
And are those competitors delivering per-person customized reminder services? Google's still the first to it by a long shot.
People always think that implementation of a feature is easier than it actually is. 
Uber or Lyft are the only reliable options in my experience. Phone taxis can flake out for no reason.
Why don't these apps just use Google Backup? Seems like a basic thing. Lots of the apps I use do this, including Flamingo, Reddit Sync and Pocket Casts.
Long pressing anywhere lets you drop a pin and move into Street View pretty seamlessly. Maps is still one of my most used apps, and I find the pace of development pretty awesome.
Man, don't know who downvoted you for this. It's just true.
My firstborn?
I mean a year is not that much time in the scheme of things. Especially when they're stitching in a whole other OS. I'd expect it to take at least another year to be even close to seamless. 

But yeah, even if they promise a Windows container, that shouldn't be the main reason to buy the Pixelbook.
In the US, Samsung depends on carriers for support, so if you buy an unlocked device you're on your own.
Just yesterday.
Cathedral square is such a missed opportunity for the city. It could be a beautiful European style town square with cafes, restaurants, just a lot of vibrant culture. I'm sure I. M. Pei designed it with this in mind. Hope it changes some time soon.
For the money I paid for it, I expected Samsung to do a much better job of repairing/replacing it. I mean Google gave me a Pixel XL to replace my 22 month old 6P. That's obviously over and above what's expected, but Samsung didn't even do the minimum to mitigate the situation.
This.was pointed out to me below. I totally forgot about the 2012 N7!
Ah, of course. He was absolutely right. 
It came out with Jelly Bean 4.3, actually. Then got updated to KitKat and Marshmallow.
That's better than my dad's S4 that I spent a crap ton of money on, and which was replaced not even a year and a half later with my old Nexus 5, because it was overheating and the battery was shit, and no amount of repairs did anything to help. Last time I spent money on a Samsung.
Well, it exists in the Indian accent, and probably in many European ones as well, but those accents are less standard, so I'm not too sure.
This guy just doesn't know how to take the L.
No one's making excuses. If anything it's Apple fans trying to argue that having a camera that's not obviously worse is some kind of big achievement. *That's* making excuses. 

Also, who the hell is upvoting these shitty comments? (งツ)ว
The point is that, for American English speakers, those are absolutely not the same sounds. The first is a dental stop (which doesn't actually exist in most American or English accents), and the second is a fricative, basically an S articulated against the teeth.
> Kobe was definitely the X factor that helped the Shaq Lakers go 3-2 against SA over their time together

put some respeck on D Fish's name boi
The actual pronunciation is with a dental fricative, basically an S sound but articulated against the teeth. The Indian pronunciation is an aspirated dental stop, which, to the American ear, sounds just like the 't' in 'term paper'. This isn't wrong, per se, but is one of the obvious markers of the Indian accent, one other being the retroflexion (tongue curling up to hit the roof of the palate) in the pronunciation of the 't' in 'term paper', along with a lack of aspiration in the same 't'.
This is the correct answer.
6pm is already too late in my experience, especially on the weekend. 5pm FTW.
I mean, you're splitting hairs here. So, worst case, they're the second biggest phone company in the world? Google's mobile division is not even in the conversation!
That's all of Samsung Electronics, which includes their chip and display making entities, among other things. Their mobile division is about half the size of Apple's and about a third of the popular mindspace.
Come on, they're only the biggest and richest phone company on earth. This is the minimum we should expect of them.
It's still 62% upvoted at this point, which is not bad in the scheme of things. 
It's pretty interesting how quickly the tune changes on DxOMark depending on who they rank higher. Especially so for Apple fans, who, for some strange reason, still feel entitled to being some kind of embattled class.
If anything, this is actually a good sign for Google. A year down the line, and the best Apple can do is HDR that is arguably on par with the 2016 phone?
[Actually, no!](https://i.imgur.com/JVgkTWz.png)

Looks like they backported O-moji to the N release. That, or the Android container uses Chrome OS system fonts. Probably the latter.
By that logic, there's no reason to ever text anyone. Just call them!
Ah, my bad. Not my brightest moment.
>The surface book is literally better in every way.

~~[Nope](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/715m9q/google_pixelbook_is_googles_new_chromebook_with/dn8le78/)In fact, for me the Surface Book is better in nothing. Not specs, not quality, not the ease of running Linux. No. Thing.~~

For me, it mostly doesn't. 
Just in time for my art project: a super slo-mo video of me pouring Hershey's chocolate syrup directly into my mouth.
Haha, the dude even went to the trouble of downvoting your comment, without responding to its substance. Lame.
The web browser is consistently the most resource intensive piece of software on most laptops. 
I have this issue. I left feedback a few times. It's very annoying.
Google had multiroom audio way before Amazon, and it still works better than Amazon. Amazon still doesn't have multi-user. Those are pretty serious things on which Google is the leader.
The thing that's most impressive about this is that a guy named Warwick Wong persevered through life to become an engineer at Google and file applications with the FCC.

Edit: Warwick, you really didn't have to create all those sockpuppets to downvote me so. I still think the world of you.
We can judge by the current avatar, the Pixel LS, which is awesome.
Yes, because I love my LS and want an upgrade.
>I know you've generally been disagreed with on this topic, but I thought I'd let you know that I agree with you. 

Thanks 😃

People are just too wedded to their preconceptions to look at this with open eyes. Their loss, really.
There are still a number of rough edges. I'm interested in seeing if they're better on the Pixelbook.
>congrats on your pixelbook i guess
btw windows precision touchpads are as good as macbooks. it's not magic, just a high resolution touchpad

But they're not? It's not just hardware, but how the OS deals with it. Even the best Windows laptops have inferior feeling touchpads. My wife has one that we paid more than my Pixel for, and it is just not as good. 

Also, why is it such a problem for you that I prefer my Pixel to a Windows laptop? 

>you get what you pay for

Exactly. And I'm paying for what I consider to be the premium experience for me.


>it doesn nothing better than linux....

I much prefer using the web on Chrome OS. It's just smoother than anything else out there, except maybe for Chrome on a tricked out MacBook. Having a reliable, smooth-functioning touchpad is very important for this, and no Windows machine I've used offers the same quality. 

Another thing: when you install Ubuntu via Crouton, there are no driver issues: everything just works out of the box. The last time I tried putting it on a Dell, it was far from easy to ensure that. There's always a piece of hardware, be it Bluetooth or the touchpad that needs some obscure tweak.
But I can already use Ubuntu alongside ChromeOS on my Pixel, so I get the best browsing experience that's out there + access to Linux when I want it, all in a package that looks and works better than any Windows machine. It doesn't make sense to switch.
Now you're just throwing a tantrum.
>You can probably get an i5 xps13, maybe even i7 last gen version for that price.

My wife has it. Not as good as a Pixel, though it did cost the same. The touchpad is noticeably worse, and the keyboard isn't as good.
Great touchpad, keyboard, screen, smooth operation, seamless updates, stellar browsing experience, instant bootups, not Windows.
But do they do what this one does? I haven't found any worthy replacements for my Pixel LS yet, outside of a $1800 Macbook.
I don't. It's only an issue in sRGB mode.
I did mine last week, got it 2 days later. I had a 32GB Silver 6P that got replaced with a 32GB White Pixel. No serious complaints, though the screen on this Pixel is noticeably yellower than my old Pixel when in sRGB mode.
I was talking about the Chromebook. The experience is just of higher quality. No weird driver issues, no untimely updates, no weird start screen, no weird divide between Metro and non-Metro settings (I don't use any Metro apps). The only thing I truly enjoyed about Windows was universal search from the start button via the keyboard, but with the advent of the Start Screen, that all went to shit. And don't get me started about Cortona.

Basically, Windows has too many things I don't use or need and they don't get out of my way quickly enough, or without some noodling.

Chrome OS on the other hand is a minimalist pleasure, and with the hardware of the Pixel, it really is a joy to use. To be frank, I just find other OSs straight up ugly now. This is of course very particular, and I understand that not everyone will be on board. People need Office and Adobe software and other 'productivity' stuff. I don't, and when I need something more involved (mainly IDE stuff), I have a chroot running Ubuntu that does the job. 

Edit: one thing I should add is that with the addition of Play Store apps, the minimalism of Chrome OS that I liked so much has definitely taken a hit. It's great to have the option, but it's still not all there, and there are a lot of rough edges. One thing I'm curious about with the Pixelbook is if they've managed to chisel it down a bit more.

Have you used a Chromebook Pixel? I'm curious about the jankiness you mention. 
People keep saying this should cost less, but a) don't not know what features the hardware has, b) can't provide any examples of devices with even the features we know about for the desired price. My LS still smokes every other Chromebook out there 32 months after release. I expect it to be the same with this one. That's worth a lot of money to me.
>Because it's not a high quality device! It's a $500 machine with and a $700 Google sticker. People trying to justify spending idiotic amounts on overpriced crap never cease to amaze me.

Have you used one? Do you know how good the hardware works? How smooth everything is? How crappy every other device feels after using the Pixel LS?

I don't think so. Keep your presumptuous opinions to yourself. I know what I'm paying for.
Dude, why are you so upset that I like using a high quality device with great UX for my browsing and typing needs? It's not like I'm forcing you to do the same.
I know what I like, thank you very much.
Crouton takes me 2 seconds to get running. Don't know what you're talking about. Also, I don't need Crouton for most things I do on the device, only to run Sublime Text, which is once again a joy with the awesome keyboard and trackpad.
> I mean, I'm sure there's a healthy profit margin on these

I wouldn't be so quick to conclude that. They're not making too many of these devices, and supply chain and for low volume devices can be very expensive.
Because after using a Pixel, using Windows is like pulling teeth for me.
>Who is google making this for? 

Me, as it turns out.
People on this thread are just yammering about something they have no experience of. It's pretty amusing.

The Pixel LS + Crouton is also my daily driver. Such a beautiful device. I'm really happy I get to upgrade it soon.
Crouton works beautifully on my Pixel LS. Your experience on a crappier Chromebook has no relevance to the parent's comment.
ITT: People being pissed off about the price of something they weren't planning on buying anyway. 

I for one am super excited about this device and will be buying it ASAP to upgrade my Pixel LS. 
You cannot sell for lower prices without Apple scale. This is destined to be a low volume high quality device. Exactly what I wanted.
Sweet!

While this is very cool, I think it's a bit optimistic to call it 'easy'.
The patent must have expired.
I wouldn't do that unless you never ever want to buy anything from Google from any of your accounts.
No issues with Play Music or Pocket casts. It must be a Spotify problem.
But Goggles was just a visual database right? No machine learning involved.
>Google removed the button to invoke the app drawer in the Pixel launcher and they introduced a swipe up gesture to bring it up, so they seem to agree that gestures feel more natural.

There's a caret indicating that there is something there, though. 

I don't think swipe gestures are a great idea for primary navigation. They're too annoying, at least for me, and not really discoverable. Android already has a great on-screen button system, which works. There's no reason to change it so drastically. 
They should try nicotine patches. Hear they work wonders.
Yeah, same here. I had wireless chargers everywhere. Since I switched to the 6P and now the Pixel, I can't remember a single time when I missed them.
What's your definition of 'colluding'?
Coming from Chicago, Providence feels like a paradise of integration.
Just go back and reread your inane comment.
The only thing worse than fanboys is people obsessed with fanboys.
Weird. I've had my Crouton with Ubuntu installed for over 2 years with no issues. I do back it up every couple of weeks just to be safe though.
It's part of Play Services. It might not be obviously visible on all devices, but it's there.
This happened to me a bunch, and they sent me a replacement, which has been okay so far, after a week of use.
This doesn't have much to do with stock Android. Play Protect is a service that's on all phones, and it's not messing with Bluetooth on any Pixel or Nexus devices. It's specific to this phone.
>. Is it the "close all" text at the top? I assumed that's not stock

It very much is.
No. For instance, I still can't play things on my Chromecast audio groups without Home. In fact that is one of the main reasons I bought one.
And then will fly, but little do they know, they will only die.
And yet they don't support notification channels on Oreo, so I can get heads-up notifications for my emails.
Seriously. It looks like crap. They basically took a bottom navigation bar and put it right underneath a top tab bar.
No, unless you want to play it through Bluetooth on your phone.
Yeah, that's something to think about UXwise. 
I get a fresh New Release station every Friday.
Yeah, but WhatsApp still has to do hacky shit to get their calls on the lockscreen. On iOS it's integrated into the same dialer, so there is no effective or visible difference between a WhatsApp call and a regular call. 
They should really be making an API like Apple's CallKit so any VoIP or video calling app can integrate into the dialer with privileged access to the lockscreen, etc. The main issue is that dialer apps are different across the board on Android, so this might not be as simple as it sounds. Still, it's definitely needed.
>Also, I'd like a clear all button for recents.

It's already there. What version of Android are you using, my man?
Wearing new pants all the time sounds uncomfortable tbh.
Not quite. You can't customise tones and colors yet, but you can decide if it should ring or light up for each channel separately.
Use a better music app. Amazon's apps suck across the board.
I don't have an iPhone to test these things, so I'm not really sure. See if this article helps: http://www.idownloadblog.com/2013/06/25/apple-enables-direct-google-contacts-sync-in-ios-7/

EDIT: Actually, looks like you need to upload the contacts manually. See here: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6800987?tstart=0 

Basically, it looks like you need to move from iCloud to Google for your contacts syncing purposes.
https://support.google.com/mail/answer/2753077?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&hl=en
This has been a problem since the Nougat update on Chrome OS. I  made a post about it [a while ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsync/comments/6god27/small_cards_view_in_chrome_os_with_nougat_doesnt/), but I should probably file a bug report for it to be taken seriously. Maybe you can do it!
You need to sync your contacts to Google. Otherwise, how's it supposed to know who your contacts are?
Are your contacts on Google contacts?
Yeah, I got this too. But doesn't seem like I need to update anything.
I have no answers, I'm afraid. I try not to engage.
> Notification overhaul. The settings for notifications should be at a system level, not an app level.

That's already the case for apps that target O (i.e. have notification channels).

AFAIK, that's only coming with 8.1.
>SystemUI tuner, or a way to customize the toggles.

How so? The panel is fully editable. You're talking about individual buttons and what they do?

>Switch to last app on double-tapping recents.

That's already a thing, though.
Ah, thanks.
It's still working (can never tell with these features). Unfortunately, podcasts are still a no-go with Chromecast Audio

One of my wife's cousins (maybe once or twice removed) lives in Pawpaw, MI and has an app on his phone that alerts him to murders in Chicago on a daily basis. 
Is that a quote from somewhere?
I would expect some more notable userfacing changes, like better integration with the dialer for VoIP apps (like iOS has had for a few years now). The sense I got from the various interviews and AMAs from the dev team is that they used up a lot of bandwidth on putting Treble in place. Without that taking up resources, that should free up devs for a lot more userfacing work.
Also, they don't share the same conversation history. 
>takes much longer for Android to recognize that the device has changed orientation

Pretty sure that's deliberate, to prevent inadvertent rotations.
This is exactly what I wanted to say. This is not Montreal. You don't need snow tires as long as you avoid unplowed streets and drive carefully.
Yeah, like the other commenter said, you just have to sync your contacts to Google. One way to do this is to switch the contacts sync on your iPhone from iCloud to Google.

Play Music isn't the best designed app, but the author's complaints miss the point. It's not built for local music playback. Its main purpose is to stream from Google's servers. 
I know all the words you wrote, but still feel like I'm reading a different language.
Look, if it was really possible for companies to pay to have ads ad surveys delivered to people who were surreptitiously recorded mentioning their names in random conversations, well... that would be pretty radical, and a major violation of Google's privacy policy. It's a very serious charge, and if you have evidence of it, you should file a consumer complaint [here](https://www.usa.gov/consumer-complaints)
That article has nothing that supports your claims. What it actually talks about is the hotword detection module being included as part of the Chromium distribution. I mean, I understand if you have genuine concerns about this issue, but at least find some good sources.
It's funny that people believe that Google gets info by eavesdropping, when that's by far the most inefficient way to do it. 
After all of tonight's games, we have:

Total wins-losses: 146-163

Still the same differential, 17!
This post is more of a technical perspective on the two frameworks. I agree that when it comes to getting it into the hands of consumers, Apple has the upper hand.
I think we can be fairly certain that Trump voted for Trump, though given the competence he's exhibited as president, maybe we can't take that for granted.
I thought that was Querrey.
But Play Services works without access to Google servers? I thought apps were reengineered to work without it in China. Even the Wear team put in quite a bit of work to make Wear independent of Play Services just for China.
http://www.greatfirewallofchina.org/index.php?siteurl=news.google.com

Also works. Which was unexpected for me.
Really? Seems weird that they'd do that.
Wow, great find!
That... doesn't seem as bad as having a back problem?
It didn't get the info from the link, but rather from the email itself. You can turn this off from settings in the Google app.
Well, that was a time of a different convention. Both 4.1 and 4.4 should have been full-point upgrades by current convention.
Okay, then we agree!
Shapo's my future lefty Fed.
One group working on 9.0 is no indication that there isn't another working on 8.1. In fact, I'm pretty sure there was a response on an AMA once saying exactly that for a past release.
Seems like GBoard should let you use these stickers anywhere that accepts image input. At least in theory. I can use my 'Selfie stickers' in other apps (though not Voice messages in Hangouts, sadly), but I haven't been able to get the blob stickers to work yet.
Unfortunately, not that I can find.
I had to download the source and compile it. I can PM you a link to the APK if you want it.

Edit: it requires a Pixel or an S8, by the way. Do you have a Pixel?
It's an issue on Spotify's end for sure. Songs play correctly with Play Music.
Install the sample app, use it and then come back to us.
I had no idea what your post meant without reading the tweet: Essential basically exposed personal info of customers to at least one other random customer.
Haha, I made the same mistake! Just realized it after I saw your comment.
I've seen these concept videos. It's cute, but is it a killer feature? I'm not sure. Maybe once Instagram/Snapchat jump on it? 
>It’s becoming harder and harder for devs to be cross platform and Google is falling behind Apple.

People have been saying this for years now, but most users don't go beyond a dozen apps that they use frequently. Also, how many apps are going to really depend on AR? I guess we'll see.
I've gotten last minute Amtraks for $12 on weeknights. Usually, if it's below $16 I take the Amtrak option on the way home. So much faster.
I just got an RMA for the rebooting problem. I was a bit skeptical that it was a hardware issue, but *shrug*...

I just tested it with all my dots. The only app where the notification wasn't dismissed was Pocket Casts. For every other app, it went away: Inbox, Gmail, WhatsApp, Hangouts, Newsstand, etc.
It doesn't though? Not for me.
It's been 2.5 months since I posted with no improvement so you might have to wait quite a bit longer.

Even my hotspot settings get backed up nowadays, SSID, security settings, everything. It's great.
Yeah, I got them in Chrome. Not sure if I like this. It's kind of disconcerting.
What app data do you want transferred? I reset my Pixel twice last month and it took me 30 min each time to get back to where i was.
Well, good on you for taking my comment in better spirit than the other commenters. Have fun with the Home!
It certainly is relevant to Google Home users. And Google owns Android. What's the bigger link that my limited faculties are missing out on?
and who are you? the asshole police?

Still, this is pretty old news at this point. Also, it has little to do with Android.
Welcome to last week!
Originally, the comment I replied to mentioned that they were having an issue with Spotify. That's what I was responding to. It seems to have been removed now.
'Flush', as in 'not jutting out'. Not 'flush' as in 'awesome'.
This is really the only game in town when it comes to phones my wife wants to hold and are not an iPhone. Wait a year or so, get it for around $300 or so, and profit.
It's not just you. The 'Now' part of things has been random, unpredictable and borderline useless for me for a while now. Sadly, it used to work much better 2-3 years ago. Looks like Google's stopped giving a shit about it, since it's now been relegated to a secondary screen with preference being clearly given to the 'Feed' part. It's very sad.
Play Music doesn't give  me that notification on O stable, though it did on the previews.
Google Store financing is completely different from the Fi installment program. I tried both when I got the Pixel last year. Synchrony is a bit of a shitshow, so I went with Fi instead.
In present times, it's not really second place though. It's just first place in the Eastern conference.
> You need to pass a credit check to get the installment pricing.

I didn't need one. At least there were no hard pulls on my credit report from Fi.
Yes, all of the east side of Providence is tainted, and badly so. But the fact remains that the Brown that lent his name to the University was an abolitionist. It's right that the University (and really our entire nation) recognize the vile roots that fed its rise. We certainly haven't done anywhere near enough to mitigate that, but the name doesn't need to be changed. It's not like Calhoun College at Yale that was named after a literal defender of slavery. 

But thanks for trying.
Are there any non-white member though? 

Genuinely curious.

Edit: [More relevant link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Brown_Sr.)

And from the [Brown University wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University)

>It is sometimes erroneously supposed that Brown University was named after John Brown, whose commercial activity included the transportation of African slaves. In fact, Brown University was named for Nicholas Brown, Jr.—philanthropist, founder of the Providence Athenaeum, co-founder of Butler Hospital, and an abolitionist. 
C'mon, give the guy a break. He can't escape the name he was born with.
I think a bunch of features for Assistant and Home that were announced at I/O will finally be released at the October event. They want to make a big splash with things.

And come to think of it, we are a bit spoiled when it comes to timelines. 5 months is not really an unreasonable amount of time to finalize a product release. We're just used to tech moving faster and faster these days.
>Do you get sad when you have to replace a few screws holding that shelf on the wall?  That is how I think of individual players.

That's dark man.
Timmy D's retired though.
Geography: F

Trollology: Also F
It's an experimental feature, so... 
It's not official support. It's basically a a rootless mod.
I'm guessing it'll accompany the Google products event in October. There will likely be a smaller Home revealed, and this feature might be a headliner.
Weird. It's fine here.
Was about to say. Talk about sheer longevity.
I'm talking only about Prime items. There's no guarantee that they're coming from Amazon any more. Sure they end up refunding me the money when I complain, but it's very annoying to not be confident that you're getting what you expect.
I've been very disappointed lately with a few Amazon purchases. Especially those that are actually sourced from third-party vendors. Just had a drill Chuck delivered 10 days late, and it ended up being a wood saw instead!

Bulk goods like toilet paper and paper towels have steadily been getting smaller in size with the price constant. I prefer Costco for that stuff now. Much more reliable.
They also have a deal with Costco, where you can get Kirkland stuff at a 10% upcharge of you don't have a membership. Still a really good deal for a lot of bulk stuff, especially because delivery is free.
Well, it includes Whole Foods for now, but probably not for much longer.
Instant apps is not an Oreo thing.

Yeah, very pleasant news. I might even go and splurge the refund on my annual membership on a Costco membership instead. Have found myself ordering a bunch of stuff from there. Even with the 10% upcharge, it's cheaper than Amazon, and certainly more reliable quality-wise.
I don't know about that. I've seen Live Photos by people of their kids, and that little bit of unexpected motion always makes me smile. There is definitely something to it, precisely because it gives you that fleeting feeling of serendipity.
You don't understand the difference between me as a random redditor calling something lame and you as someone in a position of power engaging in a pointless argument with another such random redditor? There is a material distinction between the two situations. Also, there was nothing personal about my original 'attack'. 
Great, thanks for correcting the situation! 
Just going off my experience with your moderating style here. Perhaps 'petty' is overboard, but it's not clear to me that you're always acting in good faith here.

EDIT: Just going off the example of this thread here. The reasonable way to respond to the concerns of the redditor who had their post removed is to say, well, yes, the rules are a bit ambiguous, but there was a decision taken to give preference to the XDA article for reason Y. Sorry it didn't work out. Instead, you engage in a prolonged argument about how the redditor is in the wrong. Just seems petty in my estimation.
Only way to deal with someone like /u/IAmAn00bie I'm afraid. Just a petty person.
Was the link to the primary source deleted? Lame, mods.
>However, crystal ball trainee developer Jorim added some
artificial latency in this transition 3 years ago, because he knew
that it is going to be an issue at some point so we have some
headroom to improve! Genius! On a more serious note, it was because
he didn't understand how to read systraces with binders involved (to
be fair, there was also no binder tracing).

Pretty funny. Also shows how messy development can be for something as sprawling as Android. 
There is auto HDR+, which is always on, but a bit less effective than having HDR+ deliberately on. You can tell, because HDR+ on takes just a bit longer, though not as long as on the 6P.
I run my Pixel LS as my primary laptop with Crouton alongside for my work needs. Best laptop I ever used. Can't wait to replace it in the fall, and I will happily pay over $1000 for it.
I agree, but I didn't feel like it was asked in good faith.

EDIT: To explain what I mean, the question would be good in isolation, but it doesn't really make sense in context. The point of the conversation is the question: Does it make sense for Google to invest in an Assistant driven earpiece that's solely employee focused? The strongest thing thing offered here is being able to add things to your schedule. Makes me feel like the person is just arguing for the sake of it.
>Consistent sound quality for the call center and a better working environment for open office peeps.

What part of that needs Assistant? If anything it seems to argue against Assistant. The last thing you need in an open office space is people OK Googling all the time.
Well, there are other factors. We don't know if he used HDR+ on the Pixel, and also the Pixel is significantly faster at capturing images. Still, pretty impressive for the 6P.
It doesn't. It's just Chrome autofill which uses the same database as Google autofill.
Why does that need Assistant?
This is why they do staged rollouts. Mine was 65MB and worked fine. Weird that there are so many differences here.
But that's just internal product testing for a consumer product. Which happens for basically every product.
There's no formal indication of anything, but if there are going to be headphones like this, it's very likely they're meant to make up for the lack of a jack on the new Pixels.
What's the point of having Assistant based headphones just for employees, especially when you're not going to be very mobile with a gigantic pair like in that picture?
Not sure. But I don't think it does.
Exactly. It seems clear that Evan Blass is in on the whole charade.
I know what a financial advisor is. Was commenting more on the weird marketing decision to call them 'translators'.
And what the fuck is a financial translator?
I mean no one before or after is much better than halfway to Bradman. He's just off the charts. Also, Jahangir Khan, the squash player. Won 555 matches in a row in international play over the span of five years.
It's good.
But not the same as Hangouts, unfortunately.
Last time I reset (and this on DP4), all my SMS conversations including group texts were backed up and restored seamlessly. I still had to use SMS Backup and Restore for the call logs though. If you want to be absolutely certain, you should download this app. It's pretty easy to set up.
Less.
The two apps have completely distinct chat histories. I have essentially all of mine in Hangouts, so I don't want to make the switch.
It does its job well and reliably. No complaints here.
This sync isn't seamless by the way. I had to type in my passwords for various apps separately from their website logins, but just that once.
I just use Google's inbuilt password manager, and I don't have to do anything. Factory resetting devices is now a complete breeze, because even the logins are remembered. 
It's a statewide conspiracy to piss you off.
I don't understand so many people complaining about calendar entries. I've been able to add to my calendar ever since I hooked up my Google account to it.
I can yell at mine from about one room away, but that's as far as it goes.
Gold.
