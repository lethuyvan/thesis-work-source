Colouring metals is done in different ways, though, and chemical colouring is certainly possible.

I think the subsequent version with 1366x768 was the most popular laptop in my first year in college. But humans respond better to visual cues and therefore better looking must also be better performance, you see. 
If you look at it in another way, Microsoft has always been about Windows and Office in the consumer space, which they've never had to market. Apple has made consumer hardware, which they've obviously got to sell. It shows. One company is obviously much better than the other at it. 
Well, the image of a Windows laptop is still [this](https://image3.mouthshut.com/images/imagesp/925598723s.jpg), and a Windows desktop is [this](https://images.techhive.com/images/article/2015/04/10792618_5676a307fc_o-100578383-large.jpg).   

Apple is excellent at marketing, and it certainly doesn't help that Microsoft doesn't want to really sell their products but push manufacturers (well, Dell and HP for the most part) to make similar devices. If not, they would've churned out Coffee-Lake Surface Books and Kaby Lake-R Surface Laptops by now.

See, here's my point. Were it any other driver than Verstappen (or perhaps Magnussen), we wouldn't see a crash.

10 GB? WTF?! One system update takes that much. 
But the point is, how much later? He fought him, got past, and was screwed by strategy, and got a perfect run to get him again with only 10 laps to go. You can't blame a driver for going for an overtake. 
Oh, but he was dropped for the SA matches in favour of Bumrah.
I've been through my clause and it doesn't seem to have any. I use like 350 GB a month. 
> but we can both agree that Ricciardo didn't need to force that overtake  

> he would have probably been able to overtake on the next lap  

Were we watching the same race? Max almost smashed him into the wall already once. Ricciardo said he'd had enough of going around the outside and went inside. Were he to have gone inside the next lap, I'm pretty sure 'stappen would've closed it again.   

> It says in that link that they've changed the rule "known as "moving under braking""?   

They had a sudden arbitrary rule that you can't move in the braking zone. That's gone. This one pertains to a second defensive move *anywhere* - be it braking zone or not. You can make one move from anywhere to anywhere (as long as the other car is not alongside), but when you make the second (usually opposite direction) move, you must leave space for the attacking car.

See, here's the thing. ₹30k laptop will only be ~300-350$ in the US (and the prices spike because of taxes and import duties), and these are typically laptops which are back-to-school ones to run word and chrome.  

Moreover, you *may* get away with running simple photoshop and publisher work (I used to do so on a ₹37k laptop for a couple of years), but then you'd have to spend another ₹30-35k about three years down the line to get up to performance which will match a new laptop of ~₹55k (the mid-level Inspirons with core-i7 come to mind) today.  

Try to find refurbished ones with a small SSD (128GB) and maybe i7-4/5/6 series processor. I'm not sure where in India you can buy them with warranty. I'd really recommend you get Dell's new [Ryzen 5/Vega 8](http://www.dell.com/in/p/inspiron-15-5575-laptop/pd?oc=a540119win8&model_id=inspiron-15-5575-laptop) laptop (you get a 4C/8T processor and 8 G DDR4-2400 RAM (RAM Speed makes quite a big difference for Ryzen) for <₹50k, and you can invest about ₹6-7k a couple of years down the line, throw in an NVMe SSD or extra RAM, and it will work just fine for quite a few years.   

Of course, budgetary constraints may rule you out, but I don't know. Laptops are quite expensive in India. 
Theek hai, ji :-) 
If you don't want it to run hot and want to run PS and Dreamweaver without lag... try checking out what laptops from recent years you can get used or refurbished. Or stretch your budget (because I still strongly believe laptops are not like phones and good ones can last you several years of performance).

Well, the FIA's statement basically said that Verstappen's moves resulted in the incident, but Ricciardo also apparently admitted he went too late for the move (notwithstanding him actually braking a full 50 metres earlier than when he braked during his previous overtake, potentially expecting a crash).   

From what I can see, he's just swallowing it and keeping it to himself for when it matters. 
Yeah, I guess there are such days and maybe tomorrow being a holiday people will come.

Yeah, I'd assume a purpose-built circuit would be in Chennai, Bengaluru, or Hyderabad (I say Bengaluru because (1) weather is much nicer and rains are more random (2) I'm biased cuz hometown).  

But not only was the circuit based in Delhi, it was about 50 km from Delhi in the middle of nowhere with no obvious public transport to get to there. And it was developed by the promoter essentially as a marketing tool for their "Sports City" and eventually to sell more houses nearby and in other projects. And they ran out of money because it was simply too hard for fans from the south and west (Mumbai, I'd assume, is another great place except in June) to get to Delhi and then to Greater Noida and then from there to the track. 
Nice! The [track layout](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Irungattukottai_Race_Track_map_--_Full_track.svg/1441px-Irungattukottai_Race_Track_map_--_Full_track.svg.png) is quite cool, but the track itself is quite narrow. But this is definitely good news.   

I used to once assume that were F1 to come to India it would be at Irungattukottai or Sholavaram. 
Yeah well, you're right. But the rules are same for both. You can't be pushing others off track even if there were runoff. 
It is quite clear, though. You make one move, and the second move must leave a car's width at all costs. Nobody moves twice at the exit of a corner. 
But here's the thing. At the time Kvyat was thrown out of RBR, he had done the following:  

1. Beaten Ricciardo by 3 points with 1 more retirement;  
2. Scored Red Bull's only podium of 2016 in 4 races  

I'm only guessing the move was due to Jos Verstappen's politics (He probably wanted that Red Bull seat for Max from 2016 start, but didn't get it, and was looking to move him. I don't know). 
Well, he got demoted after beating Ricciardo over a season, and there's no way you can compare Kvyat to Verstappen and Gasly.   

Hartley was brought in because Red Bull didn't have anyone else and they wanted Kvyat out. 
Humidity, man XD
I understand, but the [data](https://i.imgur.com/nj9Qwvf.png) says otherwise. 
I don't see how that's going to happen. 
You're looking at maximum daytime temperatures, I guess. 
Exactly
It wasn't late at all, though, the data shows it. He braked at least 175 metres before the corner. Vettel braked ~80-90m before and almost managed to make the move stick and most certainly didn't take out anyone. 
It's ... Shitty
But it sorted by best which not Ellen Tea. 
Ded RIP

You don't need to leave space on the *exit* of a corner if you're ahead. You need to leave space on the *entry* of a corner or while covering off a car when it is alongside on a straight. 
Madame êcry is not yet here. 
So in Abu Dhabi I can shove people off anywhere because there's runoff? 
That he got thrown out of F1 for nothing. It's there in my comment. 
So long!!  

Anyway, I think we got side-tracked (I wasn't willing to get into Prebuilt vs Custom built debates because I like building on my own but I think Prebuilts offer value for a specific set of people).  

> Do you happen to own any pre-built or ANT PC?  

Most certainly not.  

----  

I was confused whether you're generally recommending not to buy pre-builts, or about Ant-PC specifically. I didn't know of them till the first comment on this thread. I assumed that you're saying avoid Ant-PC particularly.  

In any case, Ant-PC seems to be an assembler rather than a desktop manufacturer, which is the better kind of prebuilt (although Corsair's is kind-of sweet if not for the price). (Again, **not getting into this debate**. 


It was a puncture, no?
Ben Edwards and Martin Brundle... we can only dream... 😐

The cars were taking several laps to warm their tyres up. That's why the newer tyres were much slower than the old one. The track temperature was to blame. 
SC min time of arrival delta. If you're going into the pitlane, you can only go quickly to the speed limiter line it once you're *in* the lane.

No incompatible parts, and any failure you contact the same company.  

> You are not OP.  

So?  

> If you wanna buy Ant PC, your money, and your choice. Be my guest  

I'm asking you why you think so and what makes you make a general statement "avoid ant PC" without any considerations at all. I wondered whether it is generally about avoiding pre-builts or whether Ant-PC is somehow worse than other pre-built ones.

Not for me, but someone who doesn't want to sit and customise and is willing to pay 2-3k more for a PC that will definitely work and has a single-point warranty? Maybe parents buying something for their child (yeah right, you might say, gaming pc to children?)
Actually, Vettel could've made it through cleanly (perhaps in 2nd with Bottas fighting back), but (as he said later in an interview) he didn't know where he was and missed the brake marker board. So that was more on Vettel than Bottas. 
This is not the "Verstappen Rule". You're still not allowed to make two defensive moves without leaving a car's width of space.  

Moreover, Ricciardo brakes about 25-50 m before the 150m brake marker, which is more than plenty even with all the over-speed, were he to have had the space. Even if he didn't make the corner, he would've run wide (like Vettel, but Vettel broke hardly at 100m or even further down). 
Yeah, my parents' power went out last week after trees pulled down the power  lines during a rain storm. 
I apparently [called it](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/8fqala/2018_azerbaijan_grand_prix_pre_race_discussion/dy5p3rp/?context=10000) before the race started. Who knew?!   

After viewing the incident itself over and over, I'm thinking:  

1. Ricciardo thinks Verstappen closed the door on him and left him with nowhere to go. He even mentioned the gap a bit in the paddock pass.  
2. Verstappen... I'm not sure. Maybe he doesn't think he did anything wrong? He refused to talk about the moves.  
3. Red Bull are trying to play a Mercedes Spain 2016 on this, when it clearly wasn't. I don't understand. Even the FIA is playing this game with their reprimand statement "...It was obvious to the stewards that although the incident had its origins in the moves by car 33, the driver of car 3 also contributed to the incident...". Ricciardo seems to have admitted that his move was "late" to simply not cause any more chaos and get the team to move on from this (perhaps wants to try to retain as much favour in the team as possible?)

Also, what the fuck did Magnussen do, trying to Kill Gasly twice?!

My opinion of Kvyat being thrown out of F1 for nothing is only getting stronger with all these incidents by all these drivers.

They showed it on 4. 
That wasn't the only reason. I'm surprised both Sky and 4 missed Ricciardo weaving on his outlap all through sector 1. Those tyres simply did not get up to speed. I'd really love to see S2 times on that lap for both drivers, if someone has F1 access. 
Not good ~~on a street circuit~~
They were racing each other because you have a driver's championship along with the team championship. After keeping it together for several close calls all race long... this was coming for these two. 
The FIA reprimand was quite silly in my opinion. It said something like "even though car 33's moves resulted in the action, car 3 is also found to be the cause of the accident" or some vague rubbish like that. I'd have thought they'd say something more of substance (like going for a non existent space, or at least something that you can visualise from it).

> Per-capita? As in volume of rainfall divided by population per state?  

Yes.  

> And per district would be fun to make but I didn't find any accurate data on a district level  

Unfortunate, because rainfall in states like MH are concentrated in one region leaving the others dry, so would paint a better picture. 
It would be quite interesting to also see a per-capita or per-district mapping of this somewhere sometime. 
Not really, he bottled it, all cool. 
That final corner alone would've cost ~0.4-0.5 seconds, and then you keep losing time because there are no more corners.

Well, for all grumbling about Ferrari hamstringing Räikkönen... his final Q3 lap has been short of the best thrice now. 
Hahaha
The truth is that they're both 4 times WDCs. It's easy to say "best car", but Vettel won 4-0 against Webber and Hamilton 3-1 against Rosberg in the same car. In my opinion, we can just sit back and enjoy moments when either of these drivers (or both, as in Spa 2017) are on top form.
Also that Ferrari has been historically slower than RBR and Merc at upgrades in the last few years. 
5 minutes is still a long time. If it's floor damage: hard luck. But if it's an attached element, easy. 
Räikkönen seems to be struggling a bit. 
Eh, man. 
They would've probably fixed it...
Why do I think that US -> S might be the better strategy and somehow Kimi will be screwed over in spite of it?

Look, here's something very very bitter you need to hear: your parents are holding you back. I know your mother is ill, she needs company, your father is bad, etc., but you're young and have a long and unpredictable and ever-changing life ahead of you, and you really need to build your own path.   

If you can afford it, promise her you'll visit her once in 6 months and follow through with it. Also, do what I do: call your mother every day. My mother was in a similar situation, but I had prepared her before that because I did BE also away from home.

Both BJP and Congress have backed each other up and followed up with the same policies when it comes to taxation, funding, identification, reservation, and minority affairs. What they say in press conferences and do on the streets just distracts you from what's beneath the sheets. 
I wrote a cover letter once without changing the name of the company.  

So it read (to a company called AVL). "I would greatly benefit from an opportunity to work at an excellent company like Bertrandt."  

Moreover, in several areas, Bertrandt and AVL are competitors.

I can't do that and sleep at night. I am data, data, data. I log food in 2 sources to see how they compare, take average, see how that and my workouts compare with weight loss, build a prediction, and work to lowering it. 
So, as long as I deregister at the Stadtverwaltung, it's not a "Zweitwohnsitz"?

MFP fetches my extra energy burn from fitbit, so even though my target is 6000 (which includes a 2700 deficit), I usually eat slightly more (~6100-6300) and it's still lesser).

Cabbage is like ₹12 a piece on retail and Ladies' Finger is ~₹50/kg. Expensive ones are around 70/kg when they spike and >100/kg (things like Arby, beans, avre all spike often). 
> also love the diversity in its weekly menu.   

Which goes in cycles across a month or two and also switches to cheaper vegetables cuz you know. 
Yeah, but it still comes out cheaper. Why? We've done the food delivery thing when both parents were unwell, for a few months. *Definitely* about ₹3000 more expensive per month. Why? for the price, they make small rotis, larger quantities of subzi that sometimes we've to spice/add ghee/salt to btw, etc., etc., which means that IRL it's skewed, and we've to balance them all out so that everything from variety, taste, quantity, and nutrition are properly met to our needs. 
Exactly. 
Well, I guess I know why.  

At home we always buy stuff for long periods of time (month, two months) when we can. Like 5-10kg atta, 25kg rice, etc. It reduces the amount of time spent shopping and cuts costs a lot (e.g. 1 kg Ponni rice would be ₹70 but a 25 kg bag would be ~₹1000-1200). 
I told you no, you can make 2-3 days of tiffin dosa with 50 rupees.

Same thing. They changed name due to World Wildlife Fund
I really don't want to compare any crimes with each other, but for the lack of other examples in my head at the moment.   

I'm just wondering how Sweden is different to other countries which count separate rapes as separate incidents, and whether they deconstruct each rape into sub-parts or something like that (and eventually if it turns out so, which it apparently isn't, what the whole point would be). 
Right, that makes sense.  

> Den som genom misshandel eller annars med våld eller genom hot om brottslig gärning tvingar en person till samlag eller till att företa eller tåla en annan sexuell handling som med hänsyn till kränkningens art och omständigheterna i övrigt är jämförlig med samlag, döms för våldtäkt till fängelse i lägst två och högst sex år.  

*Mental note: Learn Swedish beyond "Jag tycker om choklad"*
Well, a theft has a beginning and an end.  

Anyway, my point is, notwithstanding the horror of having to ask a rape victim about the number of penetrations and the duration; a rape "event" and a systematic rape crime over time can't be similar crimes. 
Sneeky Boi. 
TFW /r/cricket causes World War 3
> person was raped 5 times by a single person that is 5 individual crimes  

I'm really sorry to ask, but is this like at the same time, or like with gaps? 

^(Because, for example, stealing from a house on multiple nights is multiple crimes, but stealing 500 of 10 notes on one day is not 50 crimes)

1. If colours are washed out, set output to Y Cb Cr, and then adjust settings, and then back to RGB.  
2. Brightness -17, Contrast 50, Hue 0, Saturation 0 for all colours.  

In the Monitor Menu,  

1. The Bulb one is set to standard  
2. Picture: Brightness 100, Contrast 50, Sharpness 5.  
3. Picture Advanced: Picture mode sRGB  
3. HDMI RGB PC Range: RGB (0~255)    

After all this, search for "colour profile" in the system settings if English (India) or "color profile" if English (US), and follow the instructions to fine-tune it.

There's this technique that we used to practice when we were young that helped me and several of my friends a lot to be able to hit exact notes from anywhere on the spectrum at any time.  

1. Wake up early in the morning. 5 AM, 5:30 AM, maybe. Possibly down some warm water. Make sure you're not hungover or had a bad night's sleep.  
2. Pick a scale.  
3. Sing each note softly, and hold it as long as possible, and try to make the vibratos die down and the note hit the exact one you want to be at.  
4. Go up and down the scale, and optionally pick another scale, and repeat.  
5. After the soft singing, go to a soft->loud->soft pattern for each note. Repeat.  
6. Next pattern: Loud -> Soft -> Loud  
7. Next: Loud flat  
8. Next Soft-> + -> ++ -> +++ to as loud as possible.  

The important thing here is to not wake everyone up, but to intensely be able to hear each of your notes, and every little imperfection. Observe as each day you get closer and closer to your target note on average.  
I've been using BenQ GW2470. Once you configure the profile, the colours are really good and the response time is 2ms, and it's not a TN-Panel. I'd recommend that. (I bought it in Germany, but I think it's the same in India).

There are still so many things a bog standard Windows 8.1 phone does better than Android Oreo; it's shocking. Like per-app notification tones, motion tracking, Exchange Sync without dropping folders or fetching deleted ones, and jump lists.  

It's just that there were no apps, and the OS got increasingly slow and buggy, especially after the Windows 10 Updates, and it became untenable as an OS for 2014-15. Oh, and their wonderful marketing. Flagship phone with plastic. Yay.

There's also [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOlanGczdWL4d5BcpDcdhCGlbaazoJw40) by another band from a related friend circle (although I know fewer people from this band than the former). 
Well, I didn't mean it that way. 
Well, apparently not now, because repost, but obviously /r/metalcore (although I don't follow it much because half the sounds sound the same). 
A bunch of people who are in my friend-circle made [this](https://open.spotify.com/track/6TFuhdfOgoD9YqTIYQRI3U?si=PsIU2yZYRHuykOaV3kYw2w) a few weeks ago, BTW. 
Well, for starters, I have been working on my classical vocals for some time now, so not much metal.  

Second, I listen to Thrash and MDM as much as core, or even more.   

Third, I rely on Spotify for new artist recommendations. If it no show, I no know.  

BRB, I need to harvest some karma by posting this song in other subs.

Thankfully Amazon DE isn't censored. Unlike Netflix they don't change content based on which country you are in (which is good, because I can use superior Netflix India and Amazon DE when in India)

It's hard for *Indians* to live - forget live - go on a vacation in other states.

High quality designed and made in India products.  

1. Patriotism folks will buy.  
2. People longing for high quality stuff that's not choked by exorbitant import taxes will buy.  
3. Branch out into unique products that people can only buy from you.  

Start with electronics, branch out into other stuff, and run a tight ship with lots of AI and automation right from the start, freeing up humans to provide unmatched customer service.  

Use this money to lobby government into leasing out certain railway routes.  

Increase quality and speed so much that demand in spite of price is very high, get more routes, rinse, repeat.

MY DEAR CHINESE FANS
You studied in a Kerala Prince school, ah?  

My father has changed a lot in the last few years. I'm pretty sure if I had complained to him about school problems he would've said "don't go to school" or something like that (usually when I would complain of headache or something, he would say "cut your head off, then").

That's what I was thinking of. Apollo Pharmacy. But I had a "City Pharmacy" near my house in Chennai many years ago. And IIRC one more "Pharmacy".  Medplus just calls their shop "Medplus", though, in Bluru.   

> He was a fucking asshole.  

Such teachers need to count bars. 
Indeed! Chennai and Bengaluru too, only few are called "Pharmacy". Most are "Medicals".

I'd say it comes down to the games you want to play. For example, I'm not one to care much about PS4 exclusives because I play things like Project Cars 2, F1 2017, etc., so Forza Motorsport would offer more to me. Obviously I play on a PC and so Xbox exclusives will be on PC too in the future because crossplay, etc.  

If you're interested in the PS4 exclusives you should probably get that.

You should dump her and be proud of it (I know I'm in peak circlejerk territory now, and I would like to apologise and stop). 
You're obviously a stupid female (and so am I, or I was, for the first ten years of my life for having that glorious red teddy bear that was almost a metre long and cost ₹350).   

Edit: Maybe because I was small I'm imagining the toy to be bigger than it actually was. 
Slightly relevant to today's topic: My [One](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM8bTdBs-cw). 
Obviously. Which male needs a teddy bear, and which female isn't stupid? 
Well, deep down I'm a rabid feminist, so... 😅
Of course I know he thinks that. Sometimes little-knowledge is dangerous, and I don't have time to explain. At least to people who are unwilling to learn. 
IQ tests have largely equalised men and women in major developed and free countries, with slight variations (setting men to 100 on average, women were between 99.5 and 101.5). This even prompted some journalists to run with the story that "women are now vastly more intelligent to men" or some crap like that.  

In any case, IQ tests indicate many more things than just out of the ~~box~~ womb intelligence (in fact, they indicate living conditions and society and culture more than anything else). 
Dhushtanai kandaal doora vilagu.

You're wrong. 
> On the flipside, India also goes to great lengths to ensure everyone has the opportunity to vote.   

Yeah, I know, they even send CRPF to polling stations when there might be some trouble from Maoists or whatever.  

> Contrast with the US, where the GOP openly brags about going to extreme lengths to disenfranchise as many voters as possible.  

I had to google what GOP was. I thought it was your election commission. Interesting, because in India no party has control over who votes; the election commission is independent and is set up under the cognisance of the judiciary, the executive, and the president.  

----   

That *was* my point. It isn't compulsory in any country to take money from Lobbyists. However, in India and many European countries, you can have a random party that comes to power from nowhere because people are fed up with all the current parties, like [one which swept to power in New Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party) with 67/70 seats in 2016 after hardly 2 years of being formed (this isn't a singular incident, though, has happened in different states across the years).

Thanks. 
> no shit sherlock.   

Well, shit, Sherlock, because I underestimated the costs last time, and ended up spending nearly 900€ on getting furnishings for my house from other students second-hand last year!
What's the name? 
God damn it! In India we just shout at the dude who scratched our car and pay for our repairs 🤷‍♂️
It's split as 3,2,2. So after 99,999 it's 1,00,000, and after 9,99,999 it's 1,00,00,000.  

In modern times, the 1,00,00,000 has been replaced with 100,00,000 (nobody uses "1 Arab" any more, it's just 100 Crores, 10,000 Crores, etc.)
I have put up an ad on WGG.  

I'm not able to find too many shared flats because it's on rather short notice (I didn't know whether and where I'd move till Monday).   

Moreover, I spent quite a bit furnishing my current 1-room house (which I have no more plans carrying down 5 floors and across Germany and to another place whatsoever, I'd rather vergib to the next tenant), so that's there too. 
Alright, I'll be specific.  

And is liability insurance a thing that people commonly buy? 
Thank you. 
Oh, alright.  

I assumed "keine Waschmöglichkeiten" meant no connections either. 
I mean, when I say I have no money, just that I have less than to be able to buy new.  

>  dormitories or flat sharing  

I'm doing that too, but they're less in number at shorter notice. 
Are there reliable sites where I can buy appliances, beds, etc., second-hand? Could you tell me some, if you know? Because buying everything new is way beyond my budget. 
You're right, I've got it mixed up.  

The thing about empty houses, is that it gets really expensive for me to buy everything because I'm not yet done with studies so... I have no money. 
I'm just cool with pipe connections for a Washing Machine. But the amount of ads with "keine Waschmöglichkeiten" just leaves me... worried.

> Only works if you rent an appartment/house fully furnished.  

Oh, even furnished apartments seem to rarely have washing facilities in the 350-650€ range. That's what I've found amusing. Even a year or so ago when I was looking for a place to move into, most apartments just used a Laundromat around the corner or something.  

> In which region are you looking? Because those are most common in the bigger cities.

Stuttgart, Bad-Canstadt, Böblingen, Ludwigsburg, Esslingen or anywhere within VVS, basically. 
Lobbying, contrary to belief, doesn't always involve money. It is simply a group of people getting in touch with the legislators constantly in order to push their agenda. If you visit your Legislator or Member of Parliament with your neighbours every three days as a residents' association, sit outside his office (in his "lobby") and ask for a road to be built, you're lobbying for a new road. 
At least if they gave away free tickets for a Ramayana play it makes sense, eh? But apparently not.

I don't want so many Indian matches to be honest. I am the minority in India by a huge margin, but it's like the FIFA randomly scheduling more Brazil matches because you know, Brazil. It's stupid and I wish someone would rebel and cause this to stop. 
I'd rather have that than what we have now, to be honest. It was held along with the Super 10 in the host country as part of the world cup, and not a year before in a rain-soaked field. 
You should see India. They recently made every foreign donation to political parties retrospectively since 1976 legal, and they're not required to be made public. At least you don't have that!   

*Even so*, somehow, and with Facebook spending perhaps crores and crores (1 Crore = 10 million) in newspaper ads and lobbying efforts about how "Free Basics" is good for "poor farmers who want to sell their crops", the government passed an extremely strong Net Neutrality law (compared to many other countries) after strong reactions from the public.  

So, money isn't a barrier in the US: the lack of parties and candidates is (which means one or the other is anyway going to win the seat, and there's no upstart party threatening anyone). 
Apparently there's a PS 5 coming out by the end of the year, say people. 
This never happens.  

1. You switch playback from PC to mobile while on a playlist, and the playlist loops between the same 5-6 songs unless you stop and restart the playlist.  

2. Sometimes, an artist never plays for hours, and all their songs in the playlist play at the same time.  

This is, of course, for custom created playlists for me. Spotify's shuffle sucks worse than Windows Media Player in 2001. 
IIRC every country has companies lobbying. Lobbying by itself isn't a problem as long as you're not passing a suitcase full of freshly minted notes within it.

Thank you :-)

I didn't know there are single hot daddies with toddlers available on Tinder in India. 
My friend now speaks in 15% Boarisch and it's irritating as hell to me because neither of us is extremely good in just normal German 😅😅😅
Let him do it then. I can claim my Suzuki Swift does 5:56 because I installed a fancy spoiler, but that doesn't mean anything, does it?
You can focus on both, you know. Nothing wrong. 
Just like crabs never see the mountains.

Thank you! 
Thank you, Mitty. 
No no, this was just... Madness. Watch the video. 
Wow thank you so much 😀
We do. It's called ICC World T20.

Ah, OK, I saw "macha" and "bhidu" and I thought Kannada :-P 
I have misread your comment; I apologise. 
Design the simulator using existing tools.  

At least that's what they want me to do. 
No. 
No. 
No. 
OK.  

To make vehicle powertrain, you need the software model, so that you can simulate to see its properties and then calibrate it such that it behaves the way you want. Then you use the software model to make the real engine behave the same way by flashing the On-Board control unit.  

So, if you have a model ready, you need a simulator to run the simulation. 
Adhu therinja naa yen inge irukken /s  

To be able to simulate and calibrate future powertrains with model-in-loop or software-in-loop, they need a thing they can attach their software to, so that the simulation runs. 
Well, a man's got to add things to his CV before he starts doing it. 
Thank you.  

Development of new simulation paradigm for powertrain calibrations.

Thank you. 
Thank you. 
It happens in excel too, IIRC. There are some junk bits at the end of the floating number and therefore you keep subtracting numbers till you're supposed to reach zero but sometimes you'll see "-0.00" which is really something like "-0.00000000002022"
Let them send the contract first. Also I need to look for a house. 
I got a contract job. 
Round-off error? 
Nah, our college hostel made paneer and Sunday lunches quite well. 
Rubber? 
Wasn't it "How do you turn this on"? 
[2011 Canadian Grand Prix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q6Iaz1-8VC0) has to be one of the best Formula 1 races in recent history.  

Jenson Button was plumb last after multiple crashes, a puncture, and a stop-go penalty after 40 laps amidst monsoon weather and yet won the race. 
Siege Ram. 🙏
