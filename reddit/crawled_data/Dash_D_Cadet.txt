Holy shit, its the legend himself! 
nope, still not worth it. 2015 is a never ending beta with these problems:

- handling (sucks major ass)

- cops (ded)

- multiplayer (ass)

- online only (lol)

- story (cringefest)

- rain rain rain

so yah, might as well think twice before purchasing because this game is bland and boring. no passion was put into whatsoever and the trailer deceived us all

They need to add something like what 2010 Hot Pursuit did. 

- Sports 

- Performance 

- Super 

- Exotic 

- Hyper

*sigh* 

I've been saying this for the longest time. Shit like this is what kills the multiplayer experience. Ghost mode was supposed to be implemented from the get-go but i guess Ghost games logic was for us to be in some kind of demolition derby. This game is a joke and I'm glad i've returned my copy.
ah, i see you kno de wey of the slav

thank fuck. 
1. NFS High Stakes (cant go wrong with Rom Di Prisco and Saki Kaskas)

2. NFS Most Wanted (nuff said)

3. NFS ProStreet. (a lot of memorable tracks if im being honest)

4. NFS II SE (nostalgia)

5. NFS III Hot Pursuit (nostalgia)
poor f1 lm :((
fuck yeah. that trailer was the very definition of EPIC. still can't get enough of that reventon taking down those racers one by one
trailer was great, but deceiving for the most part. similar to payback as well
cmon bruh. hp 2010 did a great job recreating the classic nfs feel with a few exceptions of gimmicks here and there 
i can give you mine if you're in MN. i have a couple flex lanyards sitting around with no use
even in nfs 2015 was like that. i feel the problem lies on the games engine 
i'll prolly rebuy payback if they announce ghost mode
very noice
I respect your list/opinion
Lol, nitro is wack
maan afternoon blocks used to be the shit back then, a 4 hour route could easily take you less than 2hrs but now its gone to shit because of the stupid algorithm

Cons:

- Commercial 

- Apartments 

- Downtown 

- Countryside 

- Houses with long ass driveways

- Addresses that does not exist

- 60 ~ 70% chance you'll return to the warehouse

- Routes are spread out in different cities 


Pros:

- Less packages (5 ~ 30)

No, it doesn’t work. That ‘original’ idea of theirs comes straight from the Forza series. NFS really is a shadow of its former self. 
They keep adding shits that noone asked for. Offroading? who the hell even asked for that?

Who in their right mind thought collision was ok in a drift speedlist? The multiplayer in general is just plagued with cancerous drivers trying to take you out left and right.

yeah man i feel ya. all in all its just sad to see what this franchise has become. they stooped so slow to the point where they had to hire jake paul to promote this heap of trash.. 
hey atleast rivals scored better than both nfs 2015 and payback so im guessing theres still hope? 
That's what i'm hoping, really. Been playing older NFS from Porsche Unleashed down to NFS 2 SE just to relieve the nostalgia and simplicity from back then. I just hope in the future we have studio that is passionate about NFS...

Yeah im not surprised too. I know for a fact Amazon has been giving out shitload of reserved blocks to newbies, which in return leaves us little to no blocks for us vets. I could see this as a temporary thing since this trend started before the holidays so im not too worried...
came across another flexer, a white van driver, and a pizza delivery guy. we all ended up delivering to the same address

I dont know about your area, but here you can grab a same day morning and afternoon between 5 & 9am
Definitely the logistics side
As long as Amazon stops giving out reserved blocks to newbies, maybe it'll go back to normal after New Years..
Maybe it hasn't taken affect in your area, but its really happening out here. I've been getting blocks left and right since friday

Edit: a word

Because of the upcoming holidays, i think Amazon is giving out a shit ton of reserved blocks to new flexers, which in return leaves us with little to no blocks against the botters 
Heres hoping rockstar surprise announces midnight club
considering ea's track record and the recent battlefront scandal, i don't think they'll stop adding speedcards and lootboxes... 
wat booty
Sonic Mania & Sonic Forces!
the real work is actually searching for blocks which (in my opinion) is a pain the ass.

i never go to someones backyard unless the customer noted to do so

Sony needs to update the trophy list. Its killing my ocd seeing just the recent trophies that i earned and not being able sort them alphabetically or by grade like the vita and ps3... 
In the early days they used to hand them out to every drivers. Dunno why they stopped doing that
This art style reminds me of jet set radio 
You can take as much time as you like, as long as you finish before 9pm. Oh, and for the notes.. ask any of the blue vesters to hand you an official "we missed you" amazon note.
if its a house and you see a vehicle, ring the doorbell. if noone answers, try placing the package between the front door and screen-door. if the package is too big, then try the backdoor and leave a written note on the front door. if that doesn't work.. return the package!

Still waiting on mah boi Naruto!!
Haha, i know exactly what you mean. 

The first thing i do before i scan for evening blocks is to check for commercials/businesses that are closed. If they are, then i put them on a separate cart and i push it to the gawd damn blue vesters. Apartments are fine because customers are usually home. but it can be a pain in the ass if you’re delivering it to downtown minneapolis, thats when i have to switch carts. Non-existent address used to be an issue for me, but not anymore. 

So yah, thats how i usually deal with evening blocks. :P

Lol, was this Prime Now or Fresh? 
This is all just too much hassle and headache. Everyday they're updating an existing shit with a new shit
At this point they should just offer a full 8 hr block...
Ive never encountered a hostile customer, but the way you responded was just right 👌🏾
They seem to be using some sort of bot because it goes away in milliseconds. I was very lucky to grab a 4 hour afternoon block tho :(
Yup. Its happening here as well 
I think you need to charge your phone 
Lol, Prime and Fresh blocks disappears faster than Logistics 
Its a chaotic mess tbh. Its also crashing the flex app, lol

I noticed that the more you deliver (consistently), the less chance you'll get deactivated, but also theres a high possibility that you'll get email complaints from delivering packages 8hrs a day.
How often do you deliver? 8hrs a day? 40 every week?
And what was your reliability rating? 
Cringed so hard my ass clenched and turned into a six pack
Im getting the legacy.
