All the usual old school banking stuff is working - so cash, card payments, payments in, direct debits and standing orders. 

You just can't monitor it online or do ad hoc bank transfers, for example 
Why wouldn't they? You're not just going to task people with dealing with as many cases as they feel like. You need some measures to see if you're doing a good job or not based on what you'd expect.

Important to note that the person giving the advice would almost certainly have benefited from choosing a non-cheap option - they wouldn't be an impartial advisor. Nonetheless, here's the article:

---

A TSB adviser warned the bank against embarking on a major internet upgrade on the cheap, The Times can reveal.

Consultants raised concerns in 2015 that the bank was not setting aside enough money for the “incredibly complex” project to move customers to a new online system.

One said: “There have certainly been some examples of where it has cost significantly more to re-platform an entire bank. It is not overly generous as a budget for that scale of migration.”

TSB customers were still struggling to access accounts yesterday despite Paul Pester, the chief executive, claiming that everything was working.

Mr Pester wrote on Twitter: “Our mobile banking app and online banking are now up and running. Thank you for your patience.”

By last night, however, he had received 1,300 messages from angry customers saying that they still could not log on to their accounts. The bank later admitted that its internet banking was operating at only “50 per cent capacity”. It was limiting the number of customers who could log on to its mobile app to ensure a “normal service”.

It advised customers to continue trying to open the app but to close it down and restart if they had problems.

Sabadell, the Spanish bank, bought TSB in 2015 after the lender was spun out of Lloyds Group by an EU competition ruling. At the time, TSB was paying Lloyds £220 million a year to use its mobile and internet banking systems.

Sabadell believed that it could save £160 million a year by transferring TSB’s customers to its own system.

Under a condition of the EU ruling, the Spanish bank received £450 million from Lloyds to cover integration costs.

Sabadell insisted at the time that these funds would be “more than sufficient” for the switch. The Times has learnt, however, that advisers currently working for TSB were concerned in 2015 that the bank was underestimating the complexity of the project. One said at the time: “It is great that Sabadell are so confident this is not going to be a problem but history tells us these things are difficult.”

The analysis suggests that TSB could have done more to prevent the failure that has caused problems for millions of customers this week. Some have been unable to access their accounts for six days, leaving them unable to pay bills or employees. Others have reported money missing from their accounts.

Mr Pester said last night: “I want to reassure customers that the engine room of the bank is working as it should. All day-to-day services such as direct debits are working as normal.

“The challenge we are facing at the moment is that while we know everything is working, one of the main ways our customers see everything is working — through internet and mobile banking — isn’t functioning as well as it should be, and for this I’m truly sorry.”

He did not say how long it would be before normal operations resumed.

That's the most Mirror headline ever. 
You can bet they will have been testing this the whole way along, but there’s one part of the process that you only get to do for real 
As Morgan puts it:

“The reports of unauthorised transactions, access to other customers’ accounts, and failures of in-branch services have all the hallmarks of an IT meltdown.

“This is yet another addition to the litany of failures of banking IT systems. Potentially millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.

“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.

“Warm words and platitudes will not suffice. TSB customers deserve to know what has happened, when normal services will resume, and how they can expect to be compensated.

“I will be writing to the FCA in due course for their assessment.”
For anyone wondering, TSB has been since the weekend migrating from the old Lloyds/Halifax/Bank of Scotland-based systems to their own, with the usual results: https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2018/apr/24/tsb-online-banking-troubles-uk-public-finances-business-live

Note it says “In the UK illegally?” Then “go home or face arrest”

I don’t get the issue with that. If you’re here illegally you shouldn’t be here. Therefore, go home so that no one needs to go through an arrest and possible deportation

It even says “we can help you go home voluntarily without fear of arrest or detention” 

Yet two words of that whole thing get seized on for political expedience and fuck all happens. Anyone here illegally must be laughing.

TIL. Stopped being in Surrey in 1974.
The way people on here were carrying on, you'd think everyone got sold down the river
When 23 Russian diplomats were expelled from the UK in the wake of the Salisbury spy poisoning, social media was abuzz with banter that having Stansted as their point of departure was as harsh a punitive measure as any economic sanction imposed on our eastern adversaries.

The joke is, in case you missed it, that flying from Essex’s claim to a London airport is a tortuous, humiliating experience, and that anyone with any self-respect would only ever grace the likes of Heathrow or City.

Such snobbery is no rarity in a city that boasts six airports (seven if you count London Oxford) of varying stature.


Broadly speaking, Heathrow, the seventh busiest terminal in the world, is more than acceptable because of its prestige, and a bona fide Tube connection; Gatwick is, too, thanks to its standing as second in the UK and a location suiting the green, monied hills of Surrey. City is a different beast and synonymous with the financial capital from which it takes its name. It is an airport choice that raises eyebrows as impressed as they are curious: are you far more important than I think you are?

Then we come to the butt of jokes: Luton and Stansted.

The northern pair - Luton to the west, Stansted to the east - seem to elicit caveats if not jokes when visited by a certain type of traveller: it was the only airport serving Bydgoszcz; I can stay at my gran’s the night before; I wanted to mix with the Great Unwashed.

 Luton and Stansted have provided fertile grounds for budget airlines
Luton and Stansted have provided fertile grounds for budget airlines CREDIT: GETTY
But these two airports are key to supporting the growing desire for air travel in the south of England and help reduce the already-low cost of flying. Without them, low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Easyjet, as well as the likes of Jet2 and Wizz, would not have had the room - or cash - to establish themselves and offer £20 flights to the Continent.

Luton certainly suffers the worst image problem. Not least because of its link to a city regularly appearing on the podium of Britain’s Crap Town awards (in 2004 it was voted the worst town in the UK). The Bedfordshire hub is also without its own train station, so all travellers from London must board a permanent rail-replacement shuttle bus from the Parkway (though this will be rectified in 2021 with the introduction of £200million direct link).


An eternity-long redevelopment of the terminal building has busied the airport approach with road works and hoardings, while the dirtying orange of the Easyjet HQ monstrosity does nothing for holiday ambiance. And is it just me, or does it always rain in Luton?

But, jeez, it’s only an airport. Once inside, your experience will not be so different to other London terminals as to rage at Luton for being “a canker on the soul” (Anthony Reed, Google reviews, 2018), or for boasting the “worst customer service in the world” (Kit Bienias, Google reviews, 2018). And I can bet that your flight is either cheaper than flying from anywhere else, or does not exist elsewhere.


Don’t get me wrong, Luton is not perfect (£3 for 10 minutes drop-off parking) but it did drop that £1 charge for security liquid bags. So, it’s trying - plus it’s the only London airport that doesn’t offer a rip-off “express” link from the capital that’s twice as expensive as a normal rail ticket but only seven minutes faster (this may change in 2021).

Stansted, on the other hand, is far more pleasant than airport snobs would have you believe.

The airport does boast its own train station, just 30 minutes from the Victoria Line at Tottenham Hale, or a little longer into Liverpool Street, and is currently gleaming from an £80 million redevelopment of its terminal building, originally designed by Norman Foster.

The Essex airport now offers as wide and impressive a range of food and drink options as its south London brethren. Sure, it is a smaller airport, with just the one runway, though the walk through duty-free is as long as a second, but it welcomes 26 million people a year and its growth rate is higher than that of Gatwick. It will reach its current cap of 35 million in five years and has applied for permission to raise its capacity to 43 million, just two short of Gatwick today. Last year, flag carrier British Airways announced it would begin flying from Stansted for the first time in its history.

When discussing this article with friends, one ventured of Stansted: "It’s ok if you want to fly to some obscure eastern European city”. Or New York, or Toronto, or Dubai, or Jamaica. With the growth of low-cost, long-haul, smaller airports are offering airlines a chance to challenge the status quo and it is surely not long until Luton champions its own transatlantic route.

As the saga of Heathrow’s third airport trundles on, the likes of Stansted, Luton, and even Southend, have never been more important to the capital’s holidaymakers. Being openly snooty about a friend or colleague’s travel destination would never be considered acceptable, while pomposity surrounding flying budget airlines is on the wane.

It’s time we embrace our second-choice airports, as well as the third, fourth and fifth.

You could ask your solicitor to send him a Cease and Desist.
In theory it should at least keep your pay the same in real terms, as we calculate inflation based on the price rise of things like mobile phone contracts, which then informs the minimum wage.

Bloody Sharia law!
No doubt, but part of being a good police officer is knowing when and how to act. If the situation is being worked through in a sustainable fashion (via the use of solicitors), that’s much preferable to creating multiple flash points each and every time this happens. 

As there didn’t appear to be any present risk to the public, that would seem to be the right judgement.
Is the complainant a castrato?

Don’t see the point of them breaking it up by force, a point the police officer may have made if the clip didn’t cut off early.

Indeed but that’s all year round without the headaches I outlined 
If you have a void, you can’t pay your mortgage. Now you may have 2+ mortgages to pay

You have to repair and refurb

If your tenants make a mess, you may have to pay

If your tenants seriously damage the place, you may have to pay and accept a void

Your tenants may stop paying for a variety of good and bad reasons. You may have to spend months getting them out while receiving nothing, at your cost. You may also have to put things right once they’re gone.

Your mortgage may go up by more than the rental market can sustain by way of interest rate changes

The value of your house may go down (it happens) meaning you’re in negative equity. If you do decide to sell, you’ll have to wait months while you serve fair notice on your tenants 

What I’m saying is that it’s not always the /UK vision of some fat landlord sitting back doing fuck all. There are good landlords (lots of people want to rent, and they have to rent from someone) and they can run all kinds of risks for a return not much higher than bank interest.

I generally distrust anyone who takes the opportunity 
Did that happen?
That’s why I prefer our moderation to be somewhere between light touch and not at all

Edit: this looks ironic now that the thread has been removed by our own mods 
That’s my assessment of it
When I did it I just got a job and kept renting my student house 
There was a specific thing I remember which was either an image or a story about a poster found in a faith school which was particularly ‘regressive’, shall we say. The mods removed it putting it down to bring a ‘low quality image’, despite the rather serious ramifications. That’s when people started to look at each other and go “Hold on, there’s something going on here”

After a while it began to be realised that there was an unspoken list of “difficult topics” that would get removed. In their absence, the commentary and voting did the rest.
It’s been such a horrible, one sided hive mind for years.

They reaped what they sowed when they started redefining it almost as a Labour/Left lifestyle magazine and deleting/banning posts or people who didn’t go with the ‘vision’. Hence what it is now. Try going in there and finding a post that’s warm about even the concept of Brexit that hasn’t been drilled into the ground - as an example.

Reminds me of a Reddit. AMA one of the soldiers who went to Afghanistan after 9/11 took part in.

Note: if it looks like the plane’s melting, open the link in the YouTube app

Also the US has the problem where all the guns already exist; they’re not starting a new country from scratch. There’s literally more guns than people. So you can’t magic them away without a lot of ‘politics’ and even then you’d be lucky to scratch the surface

Australia had the same problem, they bought the guns back from the population and now have a relatively nice society. But America has all that political and criminal baggage that would make such an idea much less attractive to them.
