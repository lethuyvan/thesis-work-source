\[MOVIE\] [Flume: When Everything Was New](https://itunes.apple.com/us/music-movie/flume-when-everything-was-new/1368163226)
I think the instrumental mixes are up on Beatport.
The song is way better than the name change.
Hi Preston, big fan of your new EP!

1. My personal favorite song off the EP is Satisfied. How did that song come about?
2. What's some non\-electronic music you're into right now?
3. Do you like pineapple on pizza?
Woah, the drop is dope! I hated the original mix, so I didn't expect this to be this good.
Hard to say. There's one part that says *"He could not go on any longer. He wanted to find peace."*. That could mean two things:

1. His mind couldn't take it anymore and he committed suicide.
2. His body couldn't take it anymore and he died naturally.

I think we don't know enough to say it was suicide. But it could be. Also, what makes it even more unclear is the translation. The original statement uses the Swedish word "orka", and there's no good English translation for that word.

Edit: [Swedish newspaper says he took his own life.](http://www.gp.se/kultur/kultur/tim-avicii-bergling-tog-sitt-eget-liv-1.5756761)
Hur kan du vara så naiv att du tror att han kanske menade något annat?
Wow, did you really miss Avicii's death last week? Anyway, he was found dead in a hotel room in Muscat, Oman. Cause of death has not been stated yet.

I don't know German, and I don't have a Bild subscription, but [according to Swedish newspaper Expressen](https://www.expressen.se/noje/avicii-hoppade-av-hemlig-comeback/), he was booked for three sets in Germany. He cancelled them because he was afraid of the high expectations.
Fuck ZHU. Sand is coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere.

Det verkar som det. Även jag tycker att den är bättre än Friend Of Mine.
Det är en [osläppt Avicii\-låt som heter Unbreakable](https://soundcloud.com/sukri-swifties/avicii-unbreakable-live-at-umf-miami-2k16). Tror tyvärr inte att den kommer släppas, då samma melodi senare användes i hans låt Friend Of Mine.
It doesn't happen in True Stories, it happens in another documentary named "Avicii på turné" towards the end of the documentary.
Ärligt talat så känns det lite som att skriva att man kan slicka sig på armbågen på CV:t. Imponerande förvisso, men det är irrelevant och tillför inte något. Risken finns ju dessutom att arbetsgivaren ser det som någonting negativt.
I think the new EP is a step\-up from Stories. Only song I don't like is Lonely Together.
[Tim is not mentioned in the Spotify credits for that song.](https://i.imgur.com/83l8bKm.png)
[Wolfgang Gartner \- Wolfgang's 5th Symphony](https://youtu.be/w_x7DFmgX8M)
Yes, it's the song I called We Burn.
AFAIK, this is the only Avicii song Tim himself sings.
Here are the ones from his UMF Miami 2016 set:

* [Avicii feat. Sandro Cavazza \- We Burn](https://dbr.ee/8tjx) \(Faster Than Light\)

* [Avicii feat. Billie Joel Armstrong \- No Pleasing A Woman](https://soundcloud.com/aviiciiradio/no-pleasing-a-woman)

* [Avicii feat. Aloe Blacc & Mac Davis \- Black and Blue](https://youtu.be/dib6Sdqi7yk) \(melody was later used in Liar Liar \- Avicii By Avicii\)
* [Avicii feat. Dan Reynolds \- Heart Upon My Sleeve \(Vocal Mix\)](https://youtu.be/ZT6360B5cK0)

I had to upload some of them myself because YouTube and SoundCloud uploads of some these tracks get copyright striked.
For everyone in Sweden, [True Stories is available on SVT Play](https://www.svtplay.se/video/17478602/avicii-true-stories).

OT: 

If anyone has a copy of the documentary "Avicii på turné", please share the link over DM. It includes some footage where he finishes a song right before entering the Ultra mainstage. Thanks!
I made a playlist in chronological order which includes every Avicii production. Feel free to hit me up if something is missing. \(I used the [Avicii discography Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicii_discography), but it's incomplete, songs like HUMAN  \- GHOST and Avicii \- UMF \(Ultra Music Festival Anthem\) are missing.\)
This is a chronologically sorted playlist which includes [every song Avicii has made, remixed, or co\-produced. ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicii_discography#As_featured_artist) A few songs are missing because they aren't available on Spotify \(at least not for me\). Let me know if a song is missing.

[The club mix](https://open.spotify.com/track/0hkhHEVEtLkm65VPRfzlzv?si=JVd42h9GRxu2odNIzS8IqA) is a song of the year contender IMO.

Edit: It's a new single, not a new album.
[TIL Armin van Buuren's real name is Armin van Buuren.](https://i.imgur.com/VFBgalI.jpg)
It would make sense to make it this year's Tomorrowland anthem.
The song with the most official remixes is probably DJ Snake & Yellow Claw - Ocho Cinco. IIRC, the remix package has 30 remixes.
It reminds me a bit of [Throttle - Hit The Road Jack](https://soundcloud.com/throttle/hittheroadjack).
Men då är det ju vi som skriver låten?
The genre is named /r/trance. [Here's Photographer's SoundCloud page.](https://soundcloud.com/photographerofficial) One of my absolute favorite trance tracks is [Photographer's remix of Dash Berlin's Shelter](https://youtu.be/gIQS9uUVmgk).
Honestly, this is very underwhelming.

EDIT: Okay, this might be the worst thing Knife Party has ever done. I did not expect them to release something this bad after a two year hiatus. Also, Rob should take this back:

And dedicated dad. ✌️
I know most of you already heard this one, but I just had to share it. I love the long, ambient buildup and the drop at 6:48 is probably the best drop ever made. A true masterpiece.
> XcQ

Haha, nope.
Say what you want Carnage is definitely enjoying his time on the Mainstage! And his set is in no way pre recorded, not that big of a fan of his music anymore but he has the energy and still seems to be having so much fun on stage while the crowd is absolutely wild 👌🏻
Lit.
So apparently this is Sosumi's last release. Does anyone know why they're shutting down?
Let's pretend this doesn't exist.
No it's not, they just both happen to sample Etta James - Something's Got A Hold On Me.

Great news. I never cared for Datsik's solo music, but when it comes to bass house, Ephwurd has been one of my absolute favorites for the past few years.

Also, I hope Datsik's departure doesn't prevent [this](https://twitter.com/Deorro/status/973495742064046080) from seeing the light of day.

Not quite Deniz Koyu quality, but a surprisingly decent pop song nonetheless.

The line between "real progressive house" and "festival progressive house" is quite blurry though. There are [some Avicii songs](https://youtu.be/OSkgJHeUoXg) that I consider as much "real progressive house" as [some Eric Prydz songs](https://youtu.be/73JXnM0e-g0).
Big room by its [original definition](https://youtu.be/Kut4KVREQ1k) is actually very similar to "real" progressive house.

I'm happy he didn't reuse the original melody. Not because it's bad by any means, but his pop remix formula has become a bit stale. And the new melody is fantastic.

I think this will be different from everything he's ever made. The artwork isn't really suitable for a pop song.
If you have heard the deluxe edition of Adventure then you've heard pretty much everything except a handful of remixes and his [Pop Culture mashup](https://youtu.be/lTx3G6h2xyA). Maybe he just isn't your cup of tea.
Kygo is currently one of the best (if not *the* best) pop EDM producer out there, but damn his old tropical house remixes are just on another level. It's sad how almost the whole genre has vanished after his departure from it.
A few remixes of the songs on his Sunrise To Sunset project have been played in some radioshows lately, therefore I think it's a remix compilation. [Also the release date is February 19th.](https://www.spinninrecords.com/releases/after-the-sunset/)

Firstly, I switch around between flairs quite often. I'm currently using the Armin flair because he made one of my favorite songs of the week. Next week I'll probably use the Don Diablo flair. Secondly, I'm a bigger fan of new Armin (Intense, Embrace) than old Armin.
Not what I expected after their last few releases, but I'm happy they went into this direction.
The Rob & Jack remix is such a banger!
Really solid album although I was hoping for a few more new songs.
The song name says it all.
This is better than I expected. Reminds me a bit of Boneless.
It almost sounds like something out of the latest Calvin Harris album, and that's not a bad thing at all.
I miss the days when Proximity's slogan "Your favorite music you haven't heard yet" actually made sense.

It was released by mistake, [the Beatport link is now dead](https://www.beatport.com/release/supa-dupa-fly-2018/2176787).
I don't believe it until it's on Spotify.
Okay this makes up for last week's song which was terrible.
**Confirmed with release date:**

* Galactic Marvl - Hello My Friends (February 2)
* Felix Jaehn - I (February 16)

**Confirmed to have an upcoming album:**

* Ashley Wallbridge
* DallasK
* Mat Zo
* Oliver Heldens
* Orjan Nilsen (Early 2018)
It follows the same formula as KTN's song with Seven Lions, but that's not a bad thing. I enjoy the harder dubstep drops quite a bit although I'm not much of a dubstep fan. And the second drop is fantastic. My only complaint with this song is that I find Mako's vocals quite unmemorable (and he's one of my favorite vocalists).
Tujamo - Booty Bounce
Best Confessions release in a while.
It's good but I was hoping for something housier.
Sounds like something of his album Forget The World. Love it!
Just as amazing as Vol.1 and 2. Maybe even a bit better. Here's my ranking:

1. Woest
1. Get Low
1. Safari
1. Take Us Down (Feeding Our Hunger)
1. The Underground
I mean trance fans were generally disappointed with WAAWN because it's more of an electro house/big room/trouse album than a trance record.

> For the last 18 months i've been spending most of my time between shows at the studio. My goal was to have fun, inspire myself, and make something amazing, so when I got time in the studio I focused on making Moombahton records. I asked Toy Selectah to help me source some vocals and we got into an amazing rhythm and I kept writing songs. We went to NY, Miami, Dominican Republic and Mexico City to work and it was some of the most incredible experiences ever. So here’s the first song off my upcoming album...

Idk why but I'm excited to see what The Chainsmokers will do next even though I hated MDNO. It feels like they have to change up their sound a bit to stay relevant. I don't think they'll do big room or progressive house though. Maybe they'll do hip-hop collaborations or something?
I'm interested in helping!

Edward Bloms baksmälleost

Ingredienser:

* 1 rejält bakfull person
* 500 g hårdost (alla sorter funkar)
* Ev. lite kryddning i form av ett stänk sprit, eller lite muskot, kummin, chili, vitlök eller dyl.

Smält osten på medelhög effekt i mikron. Rör runt ett par gånger så att inte de yttre delarna blir sega. Ta ut den medan det fortfarande finns en liten osmält kärna i mitten. Stänk ev. över lite sprit eller krydda. Mosa ner den osmälta kärnan och rör runt alltihop.
Ät med sked innan osten stelnar.

* Electro house: Fusion between [electro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electro_\(music\)) (which pretty much is a dead genre) and house music, e.g. [Fedde Le Grand - Put Your Hands Up For Detroit](https://youtu.be/jkRDcu-QXyk) and [Benny Benassi - Satisfaction](https://youtu.be/a0fkNdPiIL4). A more modern example of electro house is [Zedd - Slam The Door](https://youtu.be/_HOLr0jqnCI). There's also a subgenre of electro house called complextro which is more glitchy than regular electro house and sometimes confused with dubstep. E.g. [Wolfgang Gartner - Wolfgang's 5th Symphony](https://youtu.be/w_x7DFmgX8M), [Porter Robinson - Say My Name](https://youtu.be/f9_apoZ4eKk).
* Progressive house: Originally a term to describe songs like [deadmau5 - Faxing Berlin](https://youtu.be/2KTxNTxTtm0) and [Pryda - Melo](https://youtu.be/05CWBsuBgLM). Progressive house would later evolve to songs like [SHM & Laidback Luke - Leave The World Behind You](https://youtu.be/xG4AhAnyqvE) and [Avicii - Fade Into Darkness](https://youtu.be/LnnF8fczRzY), so there are basically two different types of progressive house.
* Tropical house: Poppy deep house with tropical vibes. The genre was pioneered by [Thomas Jack](https://youtu.be/fssmuf2CUWU) and rose to the mainstream through [Kygo](https://youtu.be/2UBr0dMSeXc).
* Hard house: [That's a certified trap dinger by GTA and Juyen Sebulba](https://youtu.be/OR43E7BUF_c). Seriously though, I don't know.
* Minimalistic house: Pass.
* Acid house: A sub genre of house music where every single song uses sounds from the same equalizer. [This mix should give you an idea of what I mean.](https://youtu.be/oT-NDt8N90E) Acid music isn't very popular anymore but it has influenced mainstream songs like [Armin van Buuren - Ping Pong](https://youtu.be/Z8V5GfFeUDs) and [Calvin Harris - Slow Acid](https://youtu.be/no1YHRhFr5A).
* Chicago house: The oldest type of house music, e.g. [Marshall Jefferson's house music anthem](https://youtu.be/QAR8cq5Bl94).

WHY ARE YOU SCREAMING?
Very disappointing. Justin Mylo can do way better than this.
I haven't really liked his last few releases but holy shit this might be my favorite Herobust song!
Decent song, better than their previous future bass releases.

Hmm, I searched for it before posting and the last submission I could find of this song was four years old.
Radiology have been putting out some really good progressive house songs the last year or so. This is no exception.
One of his better future bass songs.
The drop sounds a bit weird but I still prefer it to the radio mix.
Whoops, fixed it.
Best song of United We Are.
I wouldn't call it a copy but they're definitely similar.
Could be either Silicon Valley or Ozark.
Have they confirmed Sentido will be released?
Best song they have put out in a while imo.
Dreamer is the latest single by Axwell Λ Ingrosso. It was premiered last year during ADE and it has been their most anticipated song since, mostly because it was a progressive house song reminding their fans of the Swedish House Mafia days.

So yesterday they finally released it and it's amazing. Well, at least the first minute or so. The progressive house drop from the version they played at ADE has been replaced with a weird poppy drop which feels out of place with the rest of the song.

The vocals are a bit annoying but the drop is great.
Seems like it's not available in my country... Thanks anyway!
I don't think I actually have heard this one before. Good song, it should be on Spotify.
One of the best songs CAZZETTE has put out since they left electro house.
Mad Decent does annually release a Christmas compilation album, but I've never heard of a standalone EDM producer releasing a Christmas studio album.
The FEEL remix is great.

I think this was the first Paris Blohm song I ever heard. Still an amazing song.
[1001tracklists.com says it's Armin and Hardwell](https://www.1001tracklists.com/track/2qz28zq5/hardwell-armin-van-buuren-discharger/index.html). It's similar to Off The Hook so it could be them.
Core is a good song.
Det här är ett utmärkt tillfälle för att citera Stefan Holm.
Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person in the world who actually likes that drop.
Yes.
Well that's not very convincing.

Bra, då är du helt okej i min bok.
The Otto Knows remix is great!
10/10
Artist of the year IMO.
Track number 15.
It was called Heroes in the [official tracklisting of Hexagon Radio 103](https://twitter.com/HexagonHQ/status/821779024670294017?s=09). I doubt they just would make up a name.
I love how The Chainsmokers can post on this subreddit without anyone even noticing.
Holy shit, I didn't expect the dnb drop!

Not sure why this comment got removed. It's not a leak, it's a rip from the last episode of Swanky Tunes' radio show.

Nice to see Thomas Newson on Revealed again.
Yeah it's pretty crazy how they manage to put out these killer tracks week after week.

Morgan Page has been killing it with these Armada releases.
The vocals are great, but the drop is really generic.

Who's the guy in front of Moksi/Kill The Buzz?
And he also made a song with Robin Schulz.
Because it's an EDM track with pop vocals.
The drop around 2:44 is amazing.
4.0 if you count ["Triology"](https://soundcloud.com/emmd-4-0/dv-bos-trgy-preview-unreleased).
Not very interesting IMO. Arcade was way better than this.

I like it, but the drop would've been better without the "oh oh oh" part.
Exactly! You can't say that about your family.
This EP contains some of Hardwell's best songs to date and I'm sure volume 2 will be just as good.
The melody reminds me of [Silence by DVLM and Ummet Ozcan](https://soundcloud.com/emmd-4-0/dimitri-vegas-like-mike-vs-ummet-ozcan-silence-preview-unreleased).

And he's currently making an album.
Because it wasn't an official remix until now.
SideSync is the older app. They don't have the same features though.
This is my new favorite Zonderling track.

Breathe Carolina's best track of 2017. Ashley Wallbridge's remix is amazing as well.
Kolony Anthem is a nice banger.

Lit wih Yellow Claw, Gucci and T-Pain is good, but nothing exceptional.

The song with DVBBS and 2 Chainz is okay.

How Else is forgettable.

The song with Lil Uzi Vert is straight up garbage, worst track on the LP.

Night Call with Lil Yatchy and Migos is another forgettable track.

The song with Bad Royale and Big Gigantic is great, best track on the LP!

The song with Wale is bad.

The second collab with Bad Royale is another banger.

The track Ricky Remedy is disappointing, I expected something harder.

Overall, mediocre LP although there are a few good tracks in it.
Yeah, seems like he deleted it.

He's one of my favorite trap producers, but I wish he would take a few more risks with his music. His track with Zeds Dead is a good example of him playing it too safe. That being said, I'm excited for his upcoming EP.
I love both, but Seven Lions' diversity as a producer makes him a bit better in my opinion.
Two big EP's, one two-track EP, two official remixes and now this. And it's only July. W&W should take some notes.
I don't even want to know how many cheap earbuds I've broken doing this.
