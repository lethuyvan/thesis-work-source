Dr. Laws is amazing (ASTR101). First day of qz section he came in and knew everybody's name. Class is also supposed to be super easy too.
Ngl I think, although Misery Business has awesome instrumentals and vocals, the lyrics are kind of bad; the whole "she's a slut/whore and stole my man" theme is not a favorite of mine.

Ffffffffff. I don't think they'll be there when I come back to school.
Wow I really missed this foreshadowing
Trish is so damn annoying. Ah. Real villain of this season.
Did enjoy it though, especially the Kilgrave episode. Was wayyyyyyyyy too slow imo; it could have wrapped up or added some plot points more quickly; Alisa just felt like the same thing over and over again.
Jeri was my favorite part of this season; she was so effing scary! She would be great as a villain, honestly.

Reverse take this to your grave and Infinity on High and this is my list exactly. (Although I will admit that I haven't touched Evening out in a while so I'm not sure where it would fall.)

It's a water bottle and a bag, from what I heard. My friend got it really late and it was extremely underwhelming.
I'd like more rock and less overproduction but from how well mania is doing, it's probably just going to continue going in this direction. I don't know --- I'm totally fine with them going into a more poppy direction, but I feel it only works if it's executed well. Take paramore's newest album --- it's one of my favorite Paramore albums, even when they went in a new sound direction. The thing is, they executed it well.
I would agree with you critically, but your opinions need to be communicated in an educated and calm manner for anyone to take you seriously.
Old stuff is good stuff imo
Damn. I'm a newer fan (introduced in around 2014), but I do like pre hiatus stuff a lot (more than post hiatus, definitely) and would have killed for them to open with Thriller at Seattle. 
Hmm, it'd be interesting to read it before Percy Shelley came in and made it unnecessarily verbose.
I think pop punk is more suitable --- they've just been very close to fall out boy and consistently associated such that the definition has leaked in. Otherwise, I wouldn't call them emo.
Being a legendary game developer.
Yes, and their question and responses are also poorly worded given the context --- clarification does not equal trolling, especially when a person has not worded their idea well.
Wait... This is the bad place!

Andrew Jackson was an asshole, I agree.

Yeah. The shipping has been hell -- my friend's y&m pacakge came in like 5 months after the tour date and didn't include half of the stuff that was expected.
Fucking west coast smoker. That transition from $20NB is one of the best transitions they've ever done.
Check out the genius page on it --- it's pretty filler, but there is some politics in there, as is the rest of the song.
Writing proofs is pretty fun
Yeah. He also slept naked next to naked, underage girls to test his celibacy. A lot of Indian folk are not a huge fan of him.

An entire verse is dedicated to it
Have you seen the genius page on it? Pete said it's a ton about the Iraq war and George Bush (the second one).
G.I.N.A.S.F.S is a favorite but it can't top the other two
Have you been to a concert before?
I'm probably stupid because critically, Sunshine Riptide is a bad song, and critically, Burna Boy's part is bad, but I love the song and Burna Boy's part. The first half with the slower, kind of slurred singing and then switching into that faster, sharper tone is super cool imo.
You can't excuse bad music by claiming that it has some deep conceptual meaning imo.
No
The chorus is a darning 40 seconds long and is just...bad, and Pete's lyrics go dry in all the verses. I don't understand how people enjoy the song.
Fake roster.
Where's the shit?
I think I'm one of the few who really like Burna Boy's part.

It's OK+. A solid 3/5. 
Yeah man! I feel like I'm in the minority here (which isn't a bad thing, people can like what they want). I will appreciate everything they put out, as I am trash.
Well, an album is an album, right? I know a lot of albums are now engineered for shuffle play stuff like Spotify but they're still albums and deserve to be listened to as albums.
God damn it this is the best thing I've ever watched!
Very good bot
Man I know and that portion at the end live was so good and had so much emotion yet in the studio version it's much different
We literally told you not to hype yourself up. And ofc it disappointed. 
The ending was done so much better live. I think I'm going to stick to live recordings of this one.
Not sure how I feel about this, to be honest. Really hyped myself up, especially for the ending where Patrick goes ballistic, but it was less crazy than anticipated. I think I'll need to give it a few more listens.
This is super different from hearing it live. I'm going to need to give it some more time --- not sure how I feel about it right now.

While there were a few gay characters, their homosexuality was usually highlighted for jokes --- lot of rags of masculinity and homosexuality, especially with Chandler.
This was what I was first introduced to, so I'll always like it, but I just had a day of just listening to pre-hiatus stuff so it's hard to get back into it. It's not a bad album, and I love it, but only do I love it at certain times.
Thanks for this amazing art Pete can you please put this on your fall out boy twitter like the last one thanks

I always thought of Rick Steves as a cool dude, this just reaffirms it.
West coast smoker even though I didn't like it at first, really warmed up to me after the 20 DNB transition and the fantastic instruments.
Oh my fucking God. This is my fucking favorite album period. This is euphoric when listened to as a whole. There is no song I dislike on this album. Everything is fantastic. No criticisms. Fantastic transitions, great instrumental, and amazing vocals.
Man I love that book
Yeah ok
The celestial leaf would be awesome as I need it for a smithing quest. This is super helpful!
The TSA spent 300K+ on a randomizer app from IBM, so I think that counts.
Was literally just a mobile site turned into an app anyway, so there's really no big.
Barnacles have the largest penis to body ratio out of any animal. In addition to being hermaphrodites, they have sex by stretching their incredibly long penis across rocks to other barnacles in order to inseminate them, as they can not move themselves around to have sex with other barnacles.
Kind of like my father!
I think of this because of the "flamingoes are pink because they eat shrimp" fact. People usually love to put it out there but most people actually know this. 
Oh boye you really got me!!¡!!!!
Maybe you're right???¿?????¿????
Sorry for the exclamation on my part.
You can. Use runes! What are you talking about! I think you'd just get something like "you can't use that here" but someone would have to try.
Hey are we counting the deluxe version or is this simply the original
I enjoy this album quite a bit, and a couple of my favorites are found in this album, but it's definitely not my favorite album. I still stand by my opinion that pre hiatus is better than post hiatus regardless, but I don't resonate with some of the songs as much as I do with other pre hiatus albums. Very good album though.
Once you get the late game, almost every good crafted item can only be made by certain professions. This is especially seen in the DLC.
I let it rest and then plugged it in to my computer with a usb-a to usb-c connector and it booted up again so maybe try that???
Oh my God I fuckin know Jesus it is just so SEAMLESS.

Very good album; got some of FOB's best work. Definitely less polished than infinity on high, but it's darn good.
Quality shower thought.
To each their own, I guess. I really like the gameplay, but the multiplayer experience is absolutely horrid. So glad it didn't win best multiplayer.
One time at kakariko I mounted a house at a certain angle at the shrine and dismounted by pressing the jump button and clipped through the ground. It was pretty wack

if they didn't have that weird thing around the purple wave mania would be much higher. I love the wave and the whole purple aesthetic of mania, but they screwed up with the album art. For FAD, I'm probably biased because I love FAD that much, but hey, the art is good!
I used the online functionality once with a neighbor and have out around 200-250 hours into the game otherwise, and it is still one of my favorite games. Definitely worth picking up now.
Second season was good but there are a few characters in which the voices are not the best --- they are minor characters, however, but there comes a point in which you have to hear them drone on and on for an entire episode, which is a little painful.
I tried magni-statising, but the darn blocks kept falling way too fast for me to stasis them in time. 
Most libraries in the US don't require a subscription, as it is public.

Arms.
The good thing with mine is that it take more force for it to unattach so even if I drop it it shouldn't be an issue but I'm still worried
I used a weird combination of cryonis, stasis, and magnesis for this shrine. Very annoying 
All for shitting on Trump, but this is just rude and unnecessary.
How am I me? How am I controlling myself, a person with a consciousness? When you realize that you are controlling yourself, that you are your own person with their own control of their life, that your life is as interesting as any other person you see and has just as much consciousness as anyone else, it's just so confusing.

I, as trash, will eat up anything they produce because I have no taste and will always support them. However, I do agree with you. I loved SRAR, and was happy with ABAP, but this sound is weird. Of course, I will still buy and listen to it because I, as trash, will love anything they produce.
It is "stay frosty royal milk tea" iirc so yes, it isn't a long song title, but your evidence and reasoning is flawed
This title is like a fall out boy song title pre hiatus
Thought this was a coaster for the longest time.
Depends on what vinyl player you have. If you get a cheap ~100 dollar one it won't sound that good, just look pretty. If you get more expensive, like Audio Technica ones, it'll sound great but you'd be sacrificing your wallet. Expensive hobby in general.
Lunatic god or a god of a lunatic oh their faces are dancing
Man... Cards against humanity has been getting kind of lame.
It's different when you've got a game like "Vroom into the night sky" being sold alongside with titles like Odyssey.
Tell that to any geneticist, I dare you (there are other factors though).

This is probably the best answer I have gotten so far. Thank you!

I believe male pattern baldness is determined by the X - chromosome, so in males, since the dude passes the Y to his son, whether or not the mother carries the baldness Gene decided whether the son will be bald. Baldness is recessive, so there's a lower chance of a woman being bald --- I believe the mother and the father both have to carry the balding allele. Although, this is on a much more simplified scale, but mother's usually hold all of the power.
I don't know I would instead suggest the silicon gel grips
It's sad that this, basically illegal stuff, is the only way to really get "experience" that jobs that actually pay want. 
Definitely weird to see all of the "Wow, I love this new song" comments, but still nice that they gave it some love. Would have been awesome to see a remake, but this is good too.
Shipping is pretty bad though but still a great deal
I feel like this word is pretty self explanatory.
I didn't like this episode that much but the cinematography was pretty damn good
rapey and kind of dickish I believe
this is obvious bait what's with the down votes?

It's a school that condenses all of high school into one year.
It's a one classroom school aimed to condense high school into one year so I don't think that such would have been avaiable.
So cute! Is it a baby boy or girl?
I understood the whole sperm-egg deal but I thought sperm transfered through kissing. When I heard that one of my friends kissed a girl, I was intensely shocked and tried to tell him that he got someone pregnant.

Not only this, but the start menu itself is also super bland compared to other Zelda games. It's just a slideshow.

By far my favorite is folie a deux. I really loved that album and that ~kind of~ different sound but just close enough to really recognize it as fall out boy. Enjoyed all of it and remains one of my favorite albums of all time.
Very edgy
My least favorite part about the defenders is how easily Jessica warmed up to the defenders; like, that isn't really her character.

There's an episode of Tom and Jerry where Tom gets rejected by a girl cat and, after stress drinking tons of milk, lays on some train tracks. Then, when Jerry is watching tom, sees his girlfriend with another mouse. Dejected, they both lay on the train tracks. You then see a train come, the train sounds its horn, and it fades to black.
I want them to release all their singles and just fucking release the rest all at once at an obscure time like they did with AB/AP
