So how does a tourist go about setting up and using AliPay?
The N900 had an unlocked bootloader out of the box, IIRC.
**Note 8**. Kept getting stuck in the stupid "7 day jail" when trying to root/ROM it. After a few months of putting up with endless factory resets and re-setups, I sold it (at a significant loss, thanks to the eFuse being permanently tripped). Samsung, never again.
> Nubia has usually easily unlockable bootloader

How are they with releasing kernel sources and factory images?
\> Phone with Red Magic OS - 2 claimed   
\> Phone with Stock Android 8.1 - 73 claimed

Lol. But good on them for offering a stock Android option. :)
> it was torture for two years.

Wait, does this mean you're cured now? I've got the same issue but they said it's incurable, beyond some mental training to tune it out... :/
> \3. **Rooting Disadvantages**

- Your warranty is void
- Your KNOX eFuse is permanently tripped, which means you will **permanently** lose features which depend on KNOX, eg Samsung Pay, Secure Folder, Private Browsing in Samsung Internet browser and anything else that may check for KNOX (eg enterprise or banking apps).
- Because the eFuse trip and subsequent feature loss is permanent, this will reduce the resale value of the phone.
- Applying OTA updates will be difficult or may not work at all. You'll need to unroot first before you apply an OTA update and re-root.
You could use the "identify" command in the [ImageMagick](https://github.com/ayaromenok/Android_ImageMagick7/releases) package to verify if the picture is a valid image, before you apply the wallpaper.

Eg if you run `identify wallpaper1.jpg` - if that returns anything but a non-zero exit code then it means that the image is corrupted or its not a valid image format.
Pics?
So I know your comment was tongue-in-cheek, but, what's preventing the guy from doing exactly this? I mean, technically he isn't driving the car so isn't he in the clear?
I imagine the meeting [went something like this](https://i.imgflip.com/29agfa.jpg)...
*I put on my robes and wizard hat.*
Sure, no worries.
Yes, but regardless, this isn't the place for it, this is r/Linux. Do you think it's also appropriate for everyone to complain about lack of installer for macOS, iOS and other platforms (again, considering this is r/Linux)? Would it be appropriate to do this for every software release? The point is, his complaint is off-topic here, that is all.
Yes, that looks alright - except, instead of SuperSU you should flash [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases/download/v16.0/Magisk-v16.0.zip). SuperSU is no longer recommended by root community.
> It's Audi's fault Google thinks I need the same stupid notification to display forever on my phone in case I forget?

Yes, it's Audi's fault for not updating their app to target Oreo, given that Oreo has been out since October last year and the Dev Preview has been out since February last year. They've had plenty of time to update, and they have no excuse especially considering they aren't some small time company. Just look at the ratings of all the Audi apps on the Play Store - they're abysmal - it's likely that Audi doesn't really care about these apps and they're just there so that they can tick a box for marketing. Had Audi updated the app for Oreo, you would have a choice to hide the ongoing notification without blocking other notifications from the app.

> I can already see what's using the battery in the settings

Yes, but sadly majority of the users aren't as smart as you - I've been using Android since the beginning, and since the beginning I keep seeing people blaming Android for draining battery when really it's crappy apps like Facebook etc that run wild in the background and eat the battery. This is why Google's had enough and is enforcing new background limits (in Oreo and more in Android P), and forces an annoying notification for apps that do not use the new battery-friendly APIs - so that it's clear to the user what's running in the background and using battery. It's also a security thing, so that malicious apps eg the ones which display random ads/popups etc can't hide in the background so easily any longer.

If you don't like this, then leave a 1* rating in the Play Store for the app and ask Audi to update their app.

> Being open source doesn't guarantee that's something a business wants

Of course, every business has different needs. But in this case we're talking specifically about Android vs iOS from a business perspective, and *in theory*, it's open source nature gives it an advantage over iOS. I work for a carrier and we provide managed mobile solutions for businesses, and many of our businesses have switched from iOS to Android because of this very reason - the flexibility Android offers gives them the controls they're after.

> No one gives a shit about branding it with logos. 

Yeah, I don't either, but some companies do, like Verizon for example. They love putting their logos everywhere they can. 

> I don't care if my phone is open source.

Oh, but you *do* care, you just don't realise it. The reason why Android has so many features and works the way it does is because its open source. It stands on the shoulders of the work done by thousands of developers contributing code from around the world - the heart of this work being the Linux kernel. Linux gives Android the flexibility to run on and interact with a variety of hardware and platforms. Eg, say you have a USB OTG cable, you could plug in any random USB device (memory stick, keyboard/mouse, printer, scanner, webcam, mic etc) and it'll work automagically. Google Chrome is the #1 browser in the market and it's based on Chromium, which is also open source. Without realising it, your day-to-day usage of your device may include several open-source components, without which your device and usage would be very, very different and limited. You do care about open-source, you just don't realise it. Android wouldn't have evolved to the level it has today if it weren't open source. 

>  I just want the fucking thing to work without making reddit posts about it.

But it works just fine, you're just being nit picky. If Android didn't work fine then it wouldn't have an staggering 86% market share.

> The 280k redditors on https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/ seem to as well.

Yes but I bet the majority of them would be adults, not kids.

> I do prefer the precision of a digital setting that I can input numerically by default instead of spinning some dial.

Which is fine, and which is why Android gives you the choice. Android is all about choice, unlike iOS. If you don't like this - that's fine too - you also have the choice to go back to iOS...
Yep, I do.
> May \_I\_ bitch about no installer for Windows?

Sure, I mean you can do what you want. But there's no point bitching about it if you ask me when it's a non-issue.
No, but complaining that they can't run a Linux application on Windows while browsing r/Linux is weird, especially when they could just use a VM.

I'm not against Windows, I use it myself. Read my reply to OP, there's no reason why you can't enjoy the best of both worlds.
As an Ingress player, can confirm.
Taaaaaaake meeeeeee oonnnnnnnn
You can, but it won't restore the features. The instant you root, Samsung's KNOX eFuse blows up - physically - and can't be repaired. Once this happens, anything that depends on KNOX will no longer work, even if you go back to full stock.
Samsung Pay, Secure Folder, Private Browsing in the Samsung Browser and anything else that depends or checks for KNOX.
I've used both and definitely prefer front-facing. My use case is primarily when I'm at work, and I want to quickly check something without picking up my phone. If I pick up my phone there's a good chance I'll get told off by my boss... :/  Even outside of work, its just more convenient. Eg, say I'm at the bar or a dinner table, I can quickly check something without lifting up my phone from the table.

I don't like keeping my phone in my pocket because the heat is uncomfortable and [due to health reasons](https://www.google.co.nz/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4074720/&ved=2ahUKEwip2-azttzaAhUTOrwKHVZDAYwQFjABegQICRAB&usg=AOvVaw2dEI31UuHpAmAN6VMBgfLe).
If you click on "Edit", are you able to see the tiles? Then you could just drag-drop them into the upper panel and get back your tiles that way.
Run Linux as a VM then and use it as your primary OS for browsing, GIMP etc. Use Windows just for your office and gaming apps.

Once you start getting more experienced with Linux you could potentially reverse it, ie use Linux as your main OS and use Wine to run your Windows games and office apps, and for those apps that do not work very well in Wine you could use Windows in a VM.

If you've got a recent PC with two separate graphics cards (could even be onboard + dedicated), then you could pass-thru your graphics card to the Windows VM and even game in it and basically end up with the perfect scenario where you get the best of both worlds and you don't have to compromise.
I might get the OP6 first and if the Pixel 3 has the right specs (6GB+ RAM, small bezels) then I might sell my OP6 and get the Pixel 3 instead. Buy then again, the Pixels are becoming increasingly difficult to root so I might just stick with the OP6 instead...
Seconded, get the Pixel 2. Also, it should work just fine in OP's country as it has all the necessary bands for global GSM/LTE (although some carrier specific features may or may not work, like say VoLTE / WiFi calling / RCS).
Factory reset?
Why do you want to root your device? Be aware that you'll permanently lose some Samsung features that you can never get back, if you root your device.
> For example the most annoying is my MMI Connect app for my Audi. It's designed to run in the background so it can manage the car remotely

That's not an Android issue, the issue is that MMI Connect (and other Audi apps) are just plain crap and not updated for Android Oreo. Oreo has new background limits and controls so that apps can't exploit or drain your battery in the background. Apps which have been updated to target Oreo's API don't have this issue of constant annoying notifications - Oreo has a new way of handling notifications called Notification Channels, which allows various notifications from an app to be divided into "channels", so you have a *lot* of control over which notifications you want to see, and how you want to be alerted. 

Now, Oreo (developer preview) has been available to everyone - *for free* - since early **last year**, so there's absolutely NO excuse for Audi - with millions of dollars at their disposal - to not test their app and update it for the latest Android version. Blame Audi, not Google. But this shouldn't really come as a surprise though, car manufacturers always been shit at making decent apps or in-car infotainment systems.

>  Another similarly annoying one is when it tells me that Google's own Hangouts app has been using my mic.. Ok yea I know... thats why I have it. Stop telling me over and over and again

That's a *Samsung* issue, not Android/Google's fault. I don't have this issue on my Nexus 6P, running stock Android (Oreo). I had the Note 8, and it was full of annoying prompts everywhere, treating me like I was some sort of a child. Unfortunately Samsung messes around with Android too much, so a lot of bugs/annoyances that you may come across might actually be Samsung's fault, not Google's. I ended up selling my Note 8 because I just couldn't stand Samsung's annoyances any more and went back to my old Nexus 6P.

> But man.. Android just doesn't seem built well for business use yet.

Actually, Android is *perfect* for business use. Because its open source, you can customise it for your business needs to a level you just can't achieve with iOS. Eg, want your company logo freaking everywhere? You can do it. Want to lock everything down in the phone to just very specific functions? No issues. Want to monitor everything your employee does on your phone? Creepy, but it's easy peasy. You can do pretty much anything you wanted with Android, if you had the resources. It's every corporations dream OS, because they have the power to build their device exactly according to their needs, unlike iOS. Also, if they come across any bugs, they can actually fix it themselves, which again you can't do in iOS and you're *forced* to rely on Apple and be at their mercy. Android is infinitely more powerful than iOS for businesses because of this flexibility and freedom.

> Freaking gifs in the gboard keyboard

That's not an Android feature, that's a GBoard feature. Gboard isn't part of Android, it's a proprietary Google app. But unlike iOS, Android has plenty of keyboard apps available, so you're free to chose a keyboard that doesn't have gifs. 

>  I'm not a 13 year old girl

Believe it or not, people who aren't 13 year old girls also use gifs.

> Also wtf is with setting calendar invite times by spinning hands on a clock?

You can click on the little keyboard icon to the bottom-left and input the [time in digits](https://i.imgur.com/sOCFJJa.jpg).

> This is how I teach my niece to tell time.. Again I'm an adult, I'd prefer to type in the time by default, if kids need to set calendar invites fine have a clock face icon they can click, not the other way around... jesus is everyone a child now?

You've got that *completely wrong* - clock faces are actually catered towards *adults*, not kids. In fact, [schools are getting rid of analog clocks because kids these days can no longer tell time](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2018/04/24/schools-removing-analogue-clocks-exam-halls-teenagers-unable/) by looking at a clock face. Think about it - hardly anyone wears analog watches these days, never mind hanging old school analog clocks on the walls. Kids can't relate to them at all. What's even the point of teaching kids how to tell the analog time, when no one's using analog clocks? Digital clocks are better, cheaper, more reliable, uses less battery and are already built-in into most devices most households already have. There's just no purpose for analog clocks any more... no wonder they're extinct and kids can't relate to them. This is why I argue that any analog clock interfaces that you see are actually catered towards *adults*, adults who grew up with old fashioned clocks and learnt how to tell time the old fashioned way.

Explanation please? It's been a while since I watched the series. Who're all the people in the panel (besides Aang of course).
Relevant username.
Seconded. After the Nexus line ended, OnePlus has taken over the mantle as *the* most root and ROM friendly device out there. Also, a very important point to note is that OnePlus explicitly state that rooting *doesn't* void warranty, unlike other manufacturers who are either vague about their root policy or void the warranty or worse, even permanently *remove* features once rooted (Samsung). OnePlus supply official firmware images and even provide official instructions on how to return back to full stock, again, this is something most mainstream OEMs don't do. Finally, OnePlus *actively supports* community root/ROM/kernel development by giving away free devices to community developers, which is awesome and again something that most OEMs don't do.
Google phones (Pixels) are no longer "easy" to root, thanks to their A/B partitioning system and extra encryption/SELinux security. I mean, if you follow a guide its easy enough but it's a pain for when you have to install an OTA update or something and you need to unroot first.

OnePlus phones in comparison are a *lot* more easier than Pixels.

In terms of ease of root, I'd rate your devices as below:

OnePlus > Motorola > Pixel > HTC

The one in the Spark Building, Willis St
Wise words, thank you. Appreciate it. :)
This is the one in the Spark building on Willis St. Never had an issue with their service previously (although their coffee was fairly average) - everyone knew my name and my order, and there was always a cheerful smile on their faces. Today though was different, all new faces - don't know if they were temping or permanent - no smiles, young and inexperienced. I don't really blame them tbh, but the person who hired/trained them - they really shouldn't be on the frontlines on their own. If this was their Friday, I'd hate to think what their Monday would be like.
That's it, this is the last time I'm going to Mojo. Having waited 15 minutes for a frikin *tea* (it wasn't even that busy), I asked how much longer it was going to take. The lady was a bit rude and simply said "I'm not the one making your order" and I was like.. really? How am I supposed to know who's in charge of making my order? So I ask someone else and she looked at me sheepishly (like she forgot my order, although she didn't admit it) and said she'll start making it after 5 minutes.. so with the 15 mins already gone past, that'd bring the total up to 23 minutes .. for a simple green tea. I'd had enough so I told her to cancel the order. Didn't even get a refund or an apology. Never experienced such poor service in Wellington.. kinda ruined Friday for me. :(
Kiwi here, can confirm.
Samsung Internet is widely known (at least in the Android circles) to be a much faster browser. It's based on Chromium but is quite lightweight, so you still get the same website compatibility as Chrome. But it's better in many was due to its handy features like Night Mode, persistent Private Mode (so your private tabs are saved - with a password option), pop-out video player (which is really handy for sites with tiny/clunky player controls) and of course, support for Extensions.
Yep, what the other guy said. You need to wait for 7 days before you can unlock the bootloader from the Developer Options. Once done, you should be able to flash TWRP via Odin.
Deku, is that you?

Use the app [Shortcutter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.leedroid.shortcutter). It gives you a bunch of new Quick Settings toggles, one of them being mobile data. Just enable the toggle in the app, then edit your Quick Settings panel and drag-drop the new mobile data toggle. You can then use it to either complement or replace your existing mobile data toggle.

Yeah but how would you approach them initially without making it look weird? I've tried directly introducing my self and shaking hands but it feels so formal/awkward in a social setting. And if you approach someone who's not already in a conversation then it's likely that they're just as awkward as you, making the whole thing doubly awkward.
I'm not your chief, friend.
Ah, in that case, if you go into the Cloning Options for the app, there are a few settings you could try (try them one by one), eg

- Increase Compatibility
- Ignore Crashes
- Interpreted mode
- Skip native libraries
Ah, then it's likely using signature checking. You'd have to root your device then and edit your build.prop
You'd have to modify your build.prop (requires root). But if you don't want to root, you could try using [App Cloner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.applisto.appcloner) to create a clone of the Amazon Video app but change the build.prop values just for it (in App Cloner, click on the app - Developer Options - Build Props

Yeah but that's a different issue, physical build quality has nothing to do with it.
I think a better option for OP would be to load a cryptomining script on the site, so a least he can make money off those recruiters. :P

If you've used iOS and like the way it looks and feels, then you'll like MIUI too. If you however prefer the stock Android look then you'll hate MIUI. Still, you're forced to use it for 360 hours so I guess that's plenty of time to decide if you end up liking it or not. :)
It should last you 2 years. Even if you get the latest flagship, something better will be out in a few months.
Forgot to mention in the other comment, basically LineageOS doesn't automatically update vendor firmware as its proprietary, so you'll need to do this manually every time there's an new version of OxygenOS released. This is important because the vendor firmware is basically the low-level/proprietary code (usually drivers) for things like the camera, your sensors, LTE etc and sometimes they contain critical security fixes. So keeping your firmware up-to-date is as important as keeping your ROM up-to-date. 

Note that this isn't an issue if you're running official OxygenOS ROM though, as the ROM contains the firmware.
Firmware+modem is generally what you want. Also, you generally want the latest firmware but sometimes LineageOS may not have caught up, so best to download both 7 and 8. Reboot to recovery, flash 8, then flash the latest LineageOS build and reboot and see how it goes. Any issues you could go back into the recovery and flash 7 instead.
Which OS do you use? If you're on Windows consider installing Autohotkey, as you could use hotstrings instead of hot keys, which are easier to remember and don't require pressing a modifier key.

Also you can use context-sensitive hot keys so the same hotkeys do different things based on what's on your screen or which window you've got active.

Eg: I remap Ctrl+C when my mouse is hovering on an email in Outlook to copy the entire email with its header, but outside of that Ctrl+C works as normal.

Ctrl+P executes a print command as per normal but if a text is selected and that text contains a valid hostname then it pings that host instead.

Ctrl+S inserts a dynamic signature (based on the mailbox I'm in) if I'm typing up an email, otherwise it executes a save as usual.

These sort of context-sensitive hotkeys is the way to go, otherwise you'll end up with too many hotkeys and be more inefficient as your hands unnecessarily traverses from your keyboard to your macropad.
You should update to the latest 20180416 build - it has updated [GPS code](https://review.lineageos.org/#/c/LineageOS/android_device_oneplus_msm8998-common/+/212923/). Also, make sure you flash the latest [firmware blobs](https://jamal2367.com/downloads/?dir=OnePlus 5/Firmware %2B Modems/Android 8.1.0/Open Beta) to go with it.
Your XTRA_SERVERs are pointing to the old versions, try the ones below:
 
`XTRA_SERVER_1=https://xtrapath1.izatcloud.net/xtra3grc.bin`
`XTRA_SERVER_2=https://xtrapath2.izatcloud.net/xtra3grc.bin` `XTRA_SERVER_3=https://xtrapath3.izatcloud.net/xtra3grc.bin`

And enable XTRA_VERSION_CHECK

`XTRA_VERSION_CHECK=1`

Save the file and reboot, then using GPS Status & Toolbox clear the AGPS state, then preferably head outside so you have a clear line of sight to get the initial fix. See how long it takes to get a fix. Make a note of the number of satellites you can see. You'll need at least 4 satellites to get a semi-decent fix. Once you have a fix, fire up Maps or PoGo and see how it goes.

If that doesn't work there are a few other parameters we could play around with.

Also, ever since I deleted my Facebook account almost no one (besides my immediate family and my best friend) knows that it's my birthday, so I don't get hounded by calls or messages any more. And if there's a party or event, people who I care about invite me personally (phone/email/txt).

It's just an arbitrary time period. The idea is to discourage third party resellers from unlocking the bootloader and preloading bloatware/malware and selling the device. Samsung does this too on some variants of their flagships, except its a 7 day period.

> That simple fact does not cancel out the fuckups of OnePlus, and I don't know why you're acting as if it does.

When did I ever say it does? My point is if they're singling out OnePlus for those reasons then they might as well avoid every other mainstream OEM.

If you don't want to use specifically Chinese-manufactured devices, that's fine, it's your call. Also, no one's calling you a hater, heck, I'm not even talking to you. I'm calling out OP for singling out OnePlus when pretty much every major OEM is upto some or the other shady practice, either currently or in the past.
There are other apps which work better than AdAway and without root, eg AdGuard or Blockada.
LineageOS user here, camera quality is just as good on stock. Actually it's even *better* if you install Camera NX (ported Pixel camera APK), as it brings in some of the Pixel Camera's features (excellent Auto HDR+, Zero Shutter Lag etc).

You need to understand the technical differences between a virus and malware. A virus is a program which infects other programs and spreads on its own accord, with minimal user interaction. This behaviour is pretty much like a real, biological virus. 

A malware on the other hand, can be a virus but is more of a generic term for *any* malicious application - applications which exhibit user-hostile or unwanted behaviour.

Technically its not possible for Android to get a virus due to its design/security model - each app runs under its own low-level user account and doesn't have permissions to access another app or its data (this is called sandboxing). 

However, it's very much possible to get *malware* - and this is because of the permission model. Supposing you grant an app *all* permissions, it could do a lot of damage - it won't *infect* any files like a virus, but it could still steal your passwords, credit card details, steal and spam your contacts, charge you money by calling premium numbers, run botnets for hacking, DDoS attacks and other illegal actives (using your device as a proxy), mine crypto currency, collect your personal data and sell them to underground groups and so on.
Now you need not worry about all that it if you're careful about what permissions an app uses and don't grant apps unnecessary permissions, but still loopholes exists via unpatched exploits. And your device in particular is quite vulnerable to these exploits.

If you're really concerned your device was infected then you should change all your critical passwords ASAP. Two factor authentication may not be sufficient if your 2FA device is the very same phone, as the malware could have potentially snooped on the 2FA codes (if it had the permissions). So although all this is highly unlikely, I'd say it's better to be safe than sorry so please change your passwords immediately. :)
You still have to wait two weeks, so I wouldn't call it a "lot quicker".

**Edit**: Why am I being downvoted? I'm talking about their latest device, the Mi Mix 2S. Seems they've changed it so you need to wait for 360 hours / 15 days, as per many reports on XDA, eg:

Oh by /sdcard I mean your internal memory - that's what the partition is called (it's confusing, I know).

If it's a 7mb file then it could be a malicious app, but maybe it's file extension/type got corrupted somehow. But without having a look at the file itself it's hard to guess what it could have been. Next time - upload the file to virustotal.com and you'll know if it's a malware or not. :)
https://www.reddit.com/r/lineageos/comments/8dw1uv/_/dxr88oi
A typical factory reset only clears user/application data but not your media/downloaded files (/sdcard), but that should be sufficient - even if there's a malicious file on your /sdcard, if you've done a factory reset then it's harmless.
> I really wanted to get one and use another ROM, because it's the closest thing to a cheaper Nexus/Pixel but I don't want to support those shady practices.

But every mainstream manufacturer is involved in some or the other shady practices - if its not privacy, then it's poor customer support, shoddy QC/QA - sometimes leading to putting users **lives** in danger, **inhumane factory worker conditions**, price/market manipulation, tax avoidance, bribery and corruption, misleading ads, hardware lottery, anti-consumer practices like removing the headphone jack or voiding warranties if the bootloader is unlocked, permanently disabling features from previously-rooted devices and not restoring them even if you fully go back to stock, stealing design/technology from other companies, not paying license fees, not acknowledging known issues and furthermore blaming *users* for said issues, deliberately slowing down phones to force people to buy newer phones (planned obsolescence), deliberately imparing functionality if your phone was repaired by a third-party repair shop... need I go on?

If you *really* have a strong ethical and moral compass about not supporting shady corporations (and you're not just a OnePlus hater), then your only options are the Fairphone and maybe the Pureism Librem...

Alternatively, if you like the OnePlus hardware but don't want to support the company, simply buy a used OnePlus device and load LineageOS on it - that way OnePlus isn't making any money off you and not stealing your data. Slap on a case or dbrand skin and you won't even have to worry about advertising the brand. And if anyone asks you what phone you're using, just say its a random no-brand Android device running LineageOS and tell them all about LineageOS and the awesomeness of free/open-source software...
Recent years? Have you forgotten about the whole Superfish incident? And even after Superfish they were caught preloading malware/adware on their laptops two more times. Lenovo were never good. The only time they were good were when they were an ODM for IBM (making the original Thinkpads), and that's only because they had to build the devices exactly as per IBM's specifications and weren't allowed to make any alterations...and as soon as IBM sold off their Thinkpad division to Lenovo, it went to crap - quality went down almost immediately and then they started preloading bloatware and then malware..
You'll need to wipe your /system partition and flash the ROM again, and then flash pico Gapps. This will preserve your data. If you don't wipe your /system partition then it won't get rid of the Gapps.
Not sure what that file is, but you don't need an antivirus on Android - they don't add much value and don't have the power to do anything - because an Antivirus, like other apps, do not have access to other apps - Android sandboxes each app so one app can't infect or access another app's data, so you can't really get a "virus" in the traditional sense. I mean, you could get a malware that has rogue permissions and steals your contact details, makes premium calls, spams, crypto-mines etc but that's still not a virus.

Anyway, what you *really* need to stay safe:

- **Use a system-wide adblocker**, like AdGuard or Blockada. I'd personally recommend AdGuard as it has a much superior filtering system (if you can't afford the license you can get the beta version for free). A decent adblocker will block all those fake popups, drive-by downloads, javascript hacks, cryptomining scripts etc.

- Do not download apps from random third-party websites. Only websites I'd recommend are APKMirror.com, XDA Developers for advanced users/geeks, and F-droid.org for free/open-source apps which are trustworthy and free of ads.

-  Do not install random apps from the Play Store that you haven't heard of. Do not trust the reviews or the large number of downloads, most of them are fake. Unfortunately the Play Store is a mess and has tons of crappy apps like Cheetah Mobile, and Google isn't doing anything to remove them. :( If you're looking for trusted apps, check a trusted website for reviews/recommendations, like Android Police, XDA Developers or on Reddit's own r/Android Saturday App recommendations thread.

- Check the permissions required for an app before you install it. If the app requires too many permissions or uses permissions that aren't relevant to the app (eg a Flashlight app should *never* have access to your contacts or messages), then avoid the app. Once again, check trusted websites/forums for reviews before you install random apps.

- Keep your apps and OS up-to-date. Avoid apps which haven't been updated in over an year, as these could contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

- Finally, consider switching to a custom ROM like LineageOS. Since your current OS is only on the August 2017 patches, you're missing out on a *ton* of important security patches - your device is currently vulnerable to very dangerous exploits, like Blueborne, KRACK and Meltdown/Spectre.  LineageOS however, is maintained by the community and has patched many of these critical vulnerabilities, so I'd highly recommend switching to it if security is your top concern. However, installing it isn't easy but maybe you could ask a tech-savvy friend for help (or a phone repair shop might be able to assist). The other advantage of LineageOS is much better performance and battery life, since it doesn't use Samsung's TouchWiz and doesn't have a ton of unnecessary crap running in the background.
Well it might be worth investing in a Mac Mini. They're tiny, use very little power and practically last forever. In addition to running weMessage, you could use it as a media box or a NAS/file/print server so it's not entirely useless. A basic Mac Mini costs only $500, but if you find that's expensive or don't want to support Apple with your money, you could always buy a used one for a lot cheaper - for instance, a late 2012 model with a Core i7 CPU + 8GB RAM and can often be bought for $250-$300 on eBay, and there are cheaper ones too (you don't really need a high-spec model if you're only going to use it as a server).
> why would you use something that restrict you to one company

That's *exactly* why I don't use WhatsApp. I'd rather use open standards than be reliant on a single company's proprietary platform, that and the fact that WhatsApp is owned by Facebook is even more reason to avoid it. (yes I get that everyone in your country/circle uses WhatsApp so you won't stop using it, I wasn't trying to convince you otherwise, just merely pointing out the flaw in your argument, also stating my personal reasons for not using WhatsApp).
> I wish iMessage was available on Android

It is, kinda. You could use [weMessage](https://wemessageapp.com/), but it requires you to run a macOS device as a server/proxy. If you already own a MacBook/Mac Mini/iMac then this is a fairly viable option.
NZer here, can confirm. 

Although my friends circle uses Hangouts, other circles use FB messenger. WhatsApp and WeChat are mainly used by those who have overseas contacts. Discord is mostly used by gamers from what I've seen. 

But SMS remains the primary mode of communication - especially for important messages. Even if I have a contact on other platforms, I prefer sending them an SMS if it's important - I find online chat apps best for casual banter.

I don't use FB anymore so I use SMS to organise and RSVP to group events, don't feel like I'm missing out on anything. Have no issues with others replying to me or vice/versa (even with iPhone users), no "green bubble" discrimination like in the US. 

My only gripe is that I wish carriers here implemented RCS so we can move away from all these proprietary messaging platforms. :/
Unlocking the bootloader doesn't void the warranty on OnePlus phones.
It's actually quite easy to change the battery on the OP3/T, [plenty of guides](https://www.fixez.com/guides/oneplus/oneplus-3t-repair-guides/oneplus-3t-battery-repair) and videos online on how to do it. Finally, a [replacement OEM battery](https://m.ebay.com/itm/OEM-OnePlus-New-Replacement-Battery-Original-For-OnePlus-3-2-1-X-3T-with-Tools/122585524284?hash=item1c8aaaa83c:m:mwJrt0domk2JfZhpp_UOWeA) costs < $20, so it should be affordable by most.
Well, most of us here don't use CrDroid so we don't know what you're talking about. A screenshot of what you're asking would be helpful. But then again, it won't do any good - LineageOS generally do not implement *fancy* features, by fancy meaning anything too out-of-the-ordinary. Their aim is to provide a lean, stable ROM as close to stock, but with a few added features where it makes sense (benefits privacy/security/adds real value to majority of the userbase).

Finally, LineageOS do not take feature requests, see here: https://wiki.lineageos.org/faq.html#can-i-have-xxx-feature-added
You said CrDroid in your post, not LineageOS.
It's not temporary. Check their forums, this has been going on since at least April last year. They're provably targeting just the P2 for whatever reason.
But S8/+ doesn't support Treble. You'd be better off saving up some money and getting the S9/+ instead (also the S9+ has 2GB more RAM, so that with Treble will last you a longer than the S8).
The Razer has 2GB more RAM so you can multitask a lot more. But if all you care is running just 2-3 apps in the background, then the Pixel is more than good enough, especially if you aren't going to be gaming. There's literally no reason for you to consider the Razer phone.
Yes, the camera really is that bad. You *can* get good photos out of it, but both you and the subject must be perfectly still under bright light...
Looks like r/mechanicalkeyboards is leaking
Yes. I'd recommend getting only the pico GApps and the manually installing only those Google apps that you actually need. On the S2, you'll need as much performance and battery as you can squeeze out, so keeping it minimal is super important.
Nether the Note 8 or the S8 have an vanilla Android option, at least, not one that's fully functional. I'd suggest getting the S9/S9+ Exynos version and then loading a Treble ROM.
If you've got music on your computer then all you need to do is plug your phone in and drag-drop the files too your phone. If your computer is a Mac though, you'll need to install the Apple File Transfer app and then you can drag-drop to it.
Wrong sub. This is r/LineageOS
Thanks, that looks promising!
It works using Dnscrypt-Proxy - https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-https/cloudflared-proxy/

From what I understand AdGuard basically has dnscrypt-proxy built-in, so I don't see why support for Cloudfare can't be added.
Thanks but I should have mentioned using DNSCrypt. I tried adding a custom dnscrypt entry but was unable to locate Cloudflare's public key...
In addition to the other answers, I'd recommend switching to LineageOS if you're really concerned about privacy and permissions. LineageOS has this awesome feature called Privacy Guard, that blocks even more stuff than stock Android by default, and it also has this nifty control panel where you can see which apps requested what data, and you can block that access easily. From there, you can also prevent apps from running on startup and in the background.
> >3) Does stock android has a way to block apps from running in the background

>You can kill apps that are running in the background, but not stop them in the first place. There may be apps that let you do this though.

You can do this on stock Android, but you'll need a PC/adb: https://www.xda-developers.com/freeze-app-background-processes-without-root-android-nougat/

u/MachineUnlearning
Will 3.0 finally target Oreo? I can't wait for AdGuard to support Notification Channels.

Also, will 3.0 also include support for Cloudfare's DNS?

Finally, any plans to switch to Magisk's [libsu](https://github.com/topjohnwu/libsu) library?

Use case:

> Some poorly coded applications requests a new shell (call su, or worse su -c <commands>) for every single command, which is very inefficient. This library makes sharing a single, globally shared shell session in Android applications super easy: developers won't have to bother about concurrency issues, and with a rich selection of both synchronous and asynchronous APIs, it is much easier to create a powerful root app.

> This library bundles with full featured busybox binaries. App developers can easily setup and create an internal busybox environment with the built-in helper method without relying on potentially flawed (or even no) external busybox. If you don't need the additional busybox binaries and willing to minimize APK size, Proguard is smart enough to remove the binaries for you.

> A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.

It's definitely a surprise to see r/prequelmemes here in r/SCCM.
Yep, seems like there's a memory leak somewhere. Multitasking especially surfers if I don't reboot for a couple of days. But after a reboot, everything is super snappy, like I just got a new phone.
As a dev myself (not Amazon), I prefer providing an opt-in for users who are interested - with a clear "no support" disclaimer, as in if it's broken we won't help you unless you get back to a supported environment/settings/build.

I live in NZ and I've got my Amazon account/Alexa set to the US and it works just fine - I absolutely do not have an American accent - not even close - and yet Alexa has no issues recognising my commands. Can even recognise some esoteric band and song names which aren't actual words - eg if I say "Play Derezzed" it knows to play Derezzed by Daft Punk. That honestly blew me away.

I don't care much about regional customisations either (at least for the ones in NZ). I still get my local weather. I can still get my units in metric. Most of the skills work fine too without much delays or issues. 

I think Amazon is unnecessarily over-conservative about making some features available globally - features which absolutely shouldn't have any regional dependencies. I can understand some skills being US-specific, but there's absolutely room to make some more of the skills available globally, or at least to make them available for English speaking nations.

Also, you have to realise this deliberate feature gimping is hurting the Echo's adoption. When it was officially launched here in NZ, I know a ton of people who preordered it but then sold it after realising how limited and almost useless it was here, which is a shame. Many of these people switched to Google Home and will likely not switch back if Amazon continues to ignore non-US users. 

The world is more connected than ever before, thanks to the Internet becoming cheaper and faster. There's no excuse for creating artificial borders in a digital era. Give the choice to the users, don't treat them like mindless sheep. After all, the ones who are adopting and driving the adoption of digital assistants and home automation are geeks - geeks who are very vocal on social media, geeks who normal people turn to for help and recommendations. You shouldn't ignore this audience. Give us the freedom of choice. Please? :)
OP3 (used). With 6GB RAM, Snapdragon 828, UFS storage and an extremely active developer community, you can't get a better device for that price which is also very root friendly. This device will basically last forever thanks to the community.

Reboot. Yes I know it's not a solution, but it's a quick and easy fix. I always reboot first thing in the morning so my phone is ready and good to go for the rest of the day and won't lag on me when I need it the most. Been doing this on my stock LOS on Nexus 6P, runs like butter, no issues.

It's nice overall, but my only complaint is that I wish they integrated/parsed the content of the website and pulled the episodes directly, kinda like how Terrarium or the Manga Rock app works. The problem with using a browser is that it sucks using the app at night, cause the app itself is in the dark theme mode (along with the rest of my phone) but then if I go to watch something in say KA and suddenly the whole screen goes blazing white and blinds me (thanks to KA, not the apps fault) ...if they integrated the videos into the app and parsed the websites instead this wouldn't be an issue.
OMG than you so much! Been searching for an app like this for ages!

What about the username/password?
Windows doesn't have an SSH client, not unless you enable the Linux/Unix services and install everything which takes ages.

As for SFTP, you'd still need to set up the SFTP server on the Linux box.

Again, this is unnecessarily complicating things. When the Live CDs for other distro include SMB by default there's no reason for Arch boxes to do the same. With SMB you can simply browse for visible computers and drag-drop the files.
> If this was the case, I'd just use sftp, which *is* included in the arch live image IIRC

Yeah, but windows doesn't include an FTP server by default, so that's unnecessary additional setup. SMB is the fastest way to transfer files to a default Windows machine.
\* *Too-too-roo*
Would this law also be applicable to eFuses? Because eFuses are essentially the electronic version of "warranty void if removed" stickers.
On stock Android, perhaps, but if you use LineageOS or CopperheadOS, one could argue the security/privacy is actually *better*. Heck you can even buy phones with CopperheadOS preloaded if you really have huge security and privacy concerns but aren't comfortable messing around with the device firmware.
Intriguing. I might try this out in my regular keyboard, but I'm not fully convinced it'll make me faster since it requires an additional keypress (making combos like Ctrl+Shift+Arrow or Ctrl+F5 a bit more cumbersome...).
I agree but why not best of both worlds? Include samba on the live CD but not the base installation - have a prompt in the installer asking if the user would like to enable browsing Windows/SMB shares out of the box - can even automate that by having the installer check if there are any SMB shares visible, if so, include samba support automatically.

I agree with Arch's principle of KISS, but that's not necessarily the aim for Arch's derivatives - bearing in mind that these derivatives are often used by people who are new to Linux and likely have other Windows machines on their networks. In most cases, these derivatives are directly competing with Linux Mint, Ubuntu and the like, and are even targeting the same type of user, so it makes sense to include samba support to make it easier for the newbies to switch to Linux.

Finally, Live CDs are often used as rescue media, so there could be a scenario where one might want to boot a machine which has a hosed primary OS and you want to backup files over the network to another machine - in which case it'd be again handy to have things like samba already set up and running to minimise the downtime.

> The presence or lack of a sticker has no bearing on any warranty.

Could that also be applied to eFuses (like the ones on Samsung phones), in the same vein?  After all, a physical sticker's purpose is to check if a device has been tampered with physically, and an eFuse's purpose is to check if a device has been tampered with electronically. Both void the warranty, or at least, in the manufacturer's eyes.

That's no excuse though. There's no rule that you *have* to use the camera, especially when that wasn't a requirement in the earlier versions. Also I, can use Instagram without giving camera permissions just fine.

Hmm, it was only supposed to be temporary, wanted to get the OnePlus 5T but decided against buying it cause of the whole Widevine situation. But after updating my old 6P to Oreo it was working so well that I decided to just keep using it until a decent Treble device came out (with a fully working camera or GCam port and fast GPU (Adreno)).
 
So looking to see what the OnePlus 6 and the Xiaomi Mi 7 turns out like and will then make my decision. :)
Yep, it's work profile.
How about letting *me* make that decision instead of forcing it on users? The previous version worked fine if I revoked the camera rights via app-ops, just couldn't use the camera but the other parts of the app worked fine.

The point of runtime permissions is to give users that choice. It shouldn't be an all-or-nothing situation.
My favorite creation is a cross-platform OTP code copying system. The Tasker task intercepts and extracts OTP codes from most common types of SMS messages and then sends it to my server, and I've got various scripts (Autohotkey on Windows, Python on Linux) which pulls the OTP code down and writes it to the system clipboard so I can easily paste it into any website or app that I'm using. Makes 2FA logins very painless, saves me a TON of time.
Hmm, good point. Spoken like a true time traveller.

Excellent article, might have to play around with Flutter this weekend. This is what's gotten me really excited:

> have you ever asked yourself why creating a toolbar menu is so complicated on Android? Why would we describe the menu items in XML, where we can’t bind any business logic to it anyways (which is the whole intention of a menu), just to then inflate it in a callback of our Activity/Fragment before binding the actual click listeners in yet another callback? Why don’t we just do it all at once, like Flutter does?

Android has *way* too much xml and boilerplate code that sometimes makes it PITA manage and maintain, particularly for large projects. Speaking of which, I wonder how well Flutter will scale for large projects where you might need to rely on external libraries to get things done..

Edit: Before you downvote me, my repositories *are* updated and I only just installed F-Droid yesterday.

Edit2: Fixed by enabling the Guardian repo as [suggested below](https://www.reddit.com/r/android/comments/8b5seb/_/dx4vu91). I now have 0.13.1 from F-Droid!
It *is* updated. I only installed F-Droid yesterday. I've always had this issue though, NewPipe was always out of date so I stopped using F-Droid completely and switched to the Github versions. 

Only just re-installed F-Droid l yesterday as I wanted QuickLyric, which, Ironically was out of date as well and broken too so I just ended up installing it from the Play Store. I don't even know why I bother with F-Droid tbh.
Unfortunately they're abusing it, you can't use the app at all if you deny access to the camera, so it makes the whole asking for permissions thing pointless.
If you want the latest release, I suggest you get it directly from their Github page here: https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/releases

Unfortunately the version on F-Droid is quite a few versions behind (as always).
Unfortunately the F-Droid version always lags behind by a few versions for whatever reason. The current version on F-Droid is 0.11.5 which was actually released back in *January* but added on F-Droid only 5-days ago. :/

The current master release is 0.13.1 which was released 9 days ago but I bet you it'll take a few months before this version makes it to F-Droid...
Hmm, you're probably right. :| 

But at least we have a lead! Maybe you could reach out the artist and find out where they sampled it from? Published artists usually do not sample from random ringtones without seeking appropriate licenses.

The sample otherwise sounds very familiar to me though, kind of like menu / background music made during the late 90s for videogames and such. If you want some leads, check out the works of Matt Hill, Morphadron, Rom Di Prisco and Cypher.

I realise OP said "folding", but they were probably referred to using distributed computing tech for humanitarian projects. Luckily there *is* a platform for such projects - the World Community Grid is one of them - and some of their past and current projects deal with various cancer-related issues. The [Help Fight Childhood Cancer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help_Fight_Childhood_Cancer) project is one such project which actually completed its goal successfully in 2014, which resulted on the discovery of 7 compounds that destroy neuroblastoma cancer cells without any apparent side effects.

I thought it was French bread or a sub.
Chocolate chip :( 

So my batch came out mostly alright and it tasted pretty good, but I forgot to flatten them, so they were hemispherical and a bit raw in the middle. Being a perfectionist I thought I could "fix" them but popping them back in for a few more minutes.. I swear I left it in like just for 2 mins @ 180 and it immediately started to burn. 

Hmm, now that I think about it, it's probably because put them too close to the upper grill. Also, none of the recipes I've come across mention which rack you should place your tray in (or if a swap/rotation is required)...

OEMs could change the way background apps are displayed, but the background limits enforced by Android should work the same across OEMs.
> And the results are apps breaking in certain ways and people complaining to devs about it? Sounds like a fantastic solution A+

Yes, especially since Apple do it so often themselves. Actually it's even more of an issue with Apple as they simply force the updates onto everyone at the same time, whereas Android updates are staggered and take a while before the whole ecosystem catches up. And developer preview versions of Android are available for anyone for *free* for almost a whole *year* before the version is released, so if anyone's to blame for not getting their apps ready in time, it's the devs.
> It's the most crucial one to me and striking when I use an android phone that lacks it. It's the main gesture to do the most navigation on an iPhone from going back to switching to previous used app with 3d touch really quickly. It is the fastest and most intuitive.

And that is a user preference thing. When I use iOS, I sorely miss the back button and the navbar.

> The argument for navigation buttons as to who it benefits the most as stock is the weaker of the two.

That is just your opinion though, not a fact.

> So out of my 150 apps 99.99% of them don't have it enabled. I believe that's an android thing like other android users told me because it is not on by default

Then you should stop using shitty apps or complain to those devs. It's not an Android thing that's disabled by default. Go to Settings - Apps - Notifications: Heads-up should be enabled, and the default mode is enabled. Heads-up notifications only don't work if your phone is in do-not-disturb mode.

> Native support that improves the user experience without all the hassles of researching and installing 3rd party apps

Sure, and you don't need to. Most *normal* users don't spend hours researching third-party apps just to use their phones. Android works just fine out of the box, and out of the box it has way more features than iOS.
https://www.reddit.com/r/android/comments/8aigrp/_/dwzs8ts
> Swipe back has been in for several years now.

That's only one gesture, ad that's not needed in Android because of a dedicated back button.

> That's why I say android is behind unless you spend time tweaking it out of the box, something that shouldn't be. Why is it not built into the system yet?

There's no concensus proving that gesture-based navigation is better than dedicated buttons, so why should it be built into the system? Android is all about choice, if you don't like the way something is done you can actually do something about it, unlike iOS.

> Popup boxes with information while I'm using my phone

You have that in Android as well, it's called heads-up notifications and it's been around since Android 6.0. If an app hasn't implemented it for whatever reason, then it's that apps fault, not Android's. Go complain to the app developer instead. 

> If I didn't have to customize and download multiple apps to make my phone faster and more enjoyable to use, then I would agree.

Well, that's the entire point of Android, the freedom of choice and flexibility. You build your device and mould it to the way *you* want it to be behave, not how the manufacturers thinks you should use your device. If that's not for you, then Android was never meant for you.
> why do they need to be running

For fast switching. I multitask heavily, especially in and out of games, Reddit, several chat apps and Chrome. It'd suck if there were delays every time I switched between them. 

It's negligible amount of power but it's not a waste of memory. Free RAM is wasted RAM. I'd rather have the apps I use frequently in cached memory so it's faster to load and switched to.
Not OP, but I use a [Gamesir G4s](https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-G4s-Bluetooth-Wireless-Controller/dp/B01HNXGKT6#), which works with pretty much every emulator out there and also with native apps and streaming apps like LiquidSky.
> while Google lets them go crazy.

On the S5 perhaps, but try a Google Pixel 2 if you really want to see how responsive Android has become.
Perhaps, but any company that forces you to use Facebook isn't worth working for. Anyways, New Zealand is mostly a Microsoft shop, so most companies here end up using Microsoft's corporate social networking tools, such as Yammer and/or Teams.
> doesn't have built-in native gestures

You're talking as if gestures was a thing that's been in iOS for years. It's only a recent development, whereas Android has had gesture navigation apps for several years now and they work just fine.

> 3d touch

3D touch is a gimmick, it's not great UX as its confusing with long-press, but it's also a hardware limitation, not an Android limitation. I don't know anyone who actually uses it.

> I don't like how Android doesn't show notifications on screen unless it is a message or em

What are you on about? Notifications is one of the things Android does better than iOS, and even iOS fans agree. Not sure what you mean by notifications aren't shown.

> I don't like how the control panel is on top when my hand mostly resides on the bottom of a big phone.

That's a fair point, but how often do you actually need to use the control panel that it's an issue? If you're using it that often, why exactly? Maybe it's a workflow issue. But there are apps that provide a bottom control panel if you want one.

> Using navigation bars felt like going back in time

That's a matter of preference. I prefer the navigation bar as it provides a consistent UX. The double-tap recents to switch between apps is an awesome feature. Plus you can remap some of those buttons to perform other tasks. It's super handy.

> Where's the native 1 hand support?

I'm not sure if stock Android has it, but on several Android phones you can just swipe left or right on the home button and your screen will become smaller to the left or right side. If your phone doesn't have this feature then there are many [free apps](https://www.androidpolice.com/2017/10/28/xdas-one-handed-mode-app-makes-easier-use-giant-smartphone/) that you can use for the same.

> navigating Android and switching through previous used apps felt like several steps back.

On the contrary, I think Android's implementation is far superior. Why exactly do you feel its several steps back?
Actually, they *have* to this time, they don't have a choice. If an app doesn't target the recent APIs then it'll just not function in the background as expected and the app is as good as just suspended (and eventually killed off if left unused).. This is one of the reasons why you keep hearing reports of how some users aren't getting notifications for some apps after upgrading to Oreo and such.
And that's how it should be. It should only refresh when you check the app, not constantly in the background, unnecessarily draining your battery.
Ah, uni. Fair enough. Well the good news is that once you graduate and start working full time, you don't really need Facebook. So hopefully it's not too long for you. :)
Fellow Kiwi here, just curious why do you continue to use Facebook even if you hate it so much? I've gotten rid of my FB account a while ago and it's been the best decision ever.
Ah, that's the issue then. I'd suggest getting some buds with volume keys on them. I use AKG branded ones and they work well.
Open the camera > Settings > Gestures > Volume key action. Make sure its set to "Shutter".
Yes I'm aware of the issues with the Nexus 6P, but that's a hardware/QC issue, not an Android issue. I guess I'm lucky in that I've got a good unit. :)
I use [Sweech](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sweech) - it's super simple to use - no complicated passwords or server setup required, and it works across all platforms - just need a browser on the other device, no need to install any other application or set up anything special. The best part is that it's quite lightweight, no unnecessary features or bloat slowing it down unlike other apps.
> I do miss being able to use the headphones to trigger the camera from a distance though

You can do that on Android too. Not sure which phone or app you're using, but with the Google camera app, pressing any of the volume buttons takes the photo - and you can use the buttons on your headphones for this as well.
Not OP, but I use the [Gamesir G4s](https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-G4s-Bluetooth-Wireless-Controller/dp/B01HNXGKT6) and it works superbly. Compatible with every single emulator I've tried and also works with streaming services like LiquidSky. Best part is that it's got a programmable rapid fire function, which is great for some of those sidescroller games they require you to spam the fire button. :)
... isn't that a good thing? Most people *want* their apps to remember its previous states.
Have you seen the latest new leaks? It doesn't look anything like Apple's notch. Most people who were against it have reconsidered their stance on the notch. It's not a big deal, and I don't think it's copying Apple when Essential were the first to come up with the notch. If anything, Apple were the ones who copied Essential, so if OnePlus copies Apple then it's really copying from Essential.
> I usually have to do some sort of battery management at some point on android

The good news is that it's [getting much better at it](https://www.reddit.com/r/android/comments/8aigrp/_/dwzs8ts).

I'm current on Oreo on my Nexus 6P, don't have to do any sort of battery management or worry about the battery at all. No rogue apps running awry in the background. No idle drain. And it's only gonna get better.
> I still gave Android a try with the Note 8 [...]   
> android is behind in the U.I and user experience department

Well, there's your problem. That's not "Android" that you tried, that's Samsung's version of Android called Samsung Experience (also known as Grace UI or TouchWiz). 

Manufacturers typically customise Android to their liking so what you experience isn't "stock" Android but a particular variant, so your user experience is specific to that particular device.

Unfortunately some manufacturers, like Samsung, take it a step *too* far with their customisations, and when things go bad people start blaming "Android" when it's really Samsung that's at fault.
Or you could just get a decent Android phone instead. Nexus 4 is so old it's not even relevant to the discussion. Nexus 5X was just a bad phone with bootlooping issues and low RAM from the get go, and Huawei is notorious for over aggressive memory management across all their devices - I wouldn't recommend Huawei unless you're going to run an AOSP ROM (stock Android), which doesn't have those issues.

But if you actually bought a decent flagship device like the Pixel 2, Galaxy S9, OnePlus 5T, you'll find that you won't have any issues multitasking.
> malicious apps can’t just wakelock your device for hours, like on Android.

That's getting harder by the day. With Oreo, Android has a bunch of [restrictions on background processes](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/android-8.0-changes.html#back-all). Also, anything that's actively doing stuff in the background but doesn't have an ongoing notification, Android displays those apps in the notification tray saying they're running in the background and using battery - which means its not so easy for malicious apps to hide in the background any more.

And with Android P, there are even *more* background limits, see here: https://developer.android.com/preview/behavior-changes.html#input-data-privacy

You should be paranoid, and you *shouldn't* be comfortable filling this in. If anything, the Cambridge Analytica scandal has shown that how dangerous innocent looking surveys can be. To willfully give away information to an unknown entity with no history and no privacy policy is foolish... unfortunately that is the nature of the times we are living in.

It's not a "bit" better, it's a lot better. Infinitely better. Windows updates are forced on you, and they take your system hostage - not letting you do anything while it updates. And most updates require a reboot for some strange reason, whereas in Linux updates rarely require a reboot - and even when the system does reboot, its instantenous - no "preparing to install updates... do not turn off your computer" nonsense. All this results in a loss of productivity. Why, just last week at work, we had to upgrade to the 1709 build and that resulted in a downtime of over 2 hours, which is ridiculous. And I was one of the lucky ones, the upgrade failed spectacularly for several of our staff and their systems required a complete rebuild. And before you critique our upgrade method, it was something that Microsoft themselves recommended and personally signed-off as A-OK for our environment. We did everything according to the book and the upgrades were a shitshow. This isn't just me or our environment. Just check r/sysadmin and see how incredibly awful the updates are. And while you can use Group Policies to prevent forced updates, *thrice* now Microsoft has overriden that behaviour. Its gotten to that point that people have resorted to blocking the Windows update severs via firewalls.

The time spent setting up Linux for the first time is easily made up for the time you waste on Windows updates and all the little annoyances that come with Windows and the time spent disabling all the annoyances like Cortana. Don't forget that Windows still lacks a proper package manager, with every application having its own upgrade mechanism and running their own individual updaters in the background and some of them having their own individual notifications and popups that annoy you. It's a huge mess. 

On Linux, if you choose a decent rolling-release distribution like Solus, then you have to do the setup only once in the lifetime of your computer, and you'll always have the most recent version and most never have to do a clean install or do a major upgrade like you have to with Windows. And even if you switch your computers, you can simply make an image of your existing machine and restore it on your new machine - and it'll continue to work automagically, unlike Windows, which totally freaks out if you move an installation to a different machine.

> So I should do a fair amount of research

No one's making you do anything. How you choose to spend your time is entirely up to you. The argument here is about the benefits of one system over the other, nothing more, nothing less. Your statement that "no Linux system does any of this things better" is incorrect. Whether or not you have the time to do research is not my problem. Just say that you don't have the time, and move on, no one's going to criticise you for that.
No. I've been a loyal SwiftKey user since the early betas and and still continue to use SwiftKey but I find it unfortunate that its getting bloated by the day, with unnecessary "features" like stickers and gifs. What I find more disappointing is that you refuse to implement any of the features us long-time users are *really* after, such as:

- Ability to manage/edit the personal dictionary (learned words)
- Swipe over spacebar for cursor control
- Shortcuts for select all/cut/copy/paste
- Macros/auto-texts

All these are what I consider should be basic features for a truly useful keyboard app. I don't understand why SwiftKey is wasting their development efforts on unwanted features and  deliberately turning a great app worse by the day.
They do in fact. These apps even walk users thru enabling that permission, so all the user needs to do is click on the on setting. Most average users don't even think twice about enabling such things, especially when they don't know what it does or how it can be misused, I mean, to a layman "draw over other apps" hardly seems like a harmful permission compared to things like having access to your media/contacts/location/camera.
No
It's not an Android Oreo issue, it's a Nokia issue. I don't have this issue on my old Nexus 6P running Oreo with just 3GB RAM. The Nokia 8 has 4GB RAM so it shouldn't be killing apps unnecessarily in the background, unless they made their memory management more aggressive than stock values.

If you're rooted you can change these values, unfortunately Nokia refuse to unlock their bootloaders, making it near impossible to root their devices. This is why I don't buy or recommend the new Nokia phones.
Does the modded GCam apk work on this? Only reason I'm not considering Sony is due to the fairly average camera quality (of the stock camera app).
> F2FS was demonstrated to be faster especially during the OP3T release, not just synthetic benchmark but also real world usage.

That's because they were comparing it to ext4 using its default values. If the right mount options and filesystem tweaks were used, then ext4 can have similar or even better performance compared to F2FS. Some tweaks include using the parameter `relatime`, increasing the `commit` period so that it doesn't sync to disc instantly, setting `barrier=0` etc. And if you want to live on the dangerous side you could even disable fsync completely for even better performance, at a risk of losing data due to crashes/unexpected reboots.

F2FS only seems faster because it has some of these tweaks built-in, but if you use ext4 with the right tweaks you can get similar performance, while making it slightly more unsafe it should still be safer than F2FS.
SwiftKey has the best word prediction I've used in any keyboard. If you don't want any tracking, just don't use any of the sync features and then block SwiftKey using a firewall app. I use AdGuard for that (which is also probably the best adblocker for Android, well worth getting).
> I want my computer to just work. I need it to run Excel, Photoshop, and play games. No Linux system does any of those things better than what I use now.

You're forgetting about this feature called Windows Update - which Microsoft has somehow managed to make it even worse with Windows 10.

Linux does updates infinitely better than Windows. If you need any reason to switch (your main OS), this would be it. Then run then Windows apps you need in Wine or a VM.
Not if you've got an SSD, sufficient RAM and VT-x/AMD-V. Which is pretty much every modern PC.

I feel things were easier back in the day when it was cash only. The digital era promised to make things simpler but instead it's become so much more complicated.. unnecessarily complicated if you ask me, especially when we have the technology and means to unify everything.

> And also, will authorities make Google do this search?

No. The only time when this happens is for very high-profile criminal cases, like mass murder/ terrorism cases. Never for ordinary theft.

Understand that Google have over 2 **billion** *active* devices in their database, and probably twice or more number of inactive devices. It's simply not feasible for them to action, let alone even *reply* to every stolen device request. This is also the reason why the authorities will not take any action either. If you have contacts they may say they'll take action to make you happy, but trust me, it never happens.

I hate sand.
No, it won't work and they can't do anything because the device is essentially dead to the thief. They would have tried a factory reset the moment they stole your device, which activates the factory reset protection - which means the phone is basically a brick unless they know your account details. So likely that the thief sold it to some pawn shop who would have dismantled the phone and/or sold for parts to some repair store. So if your phone was stolen a month ago, your phone is no longer a phone, but a set of parts spread across the world and forever a part of the universe. I suggest saying your goodbyes, making peace and moving on with your life.
Not really, because the ID is also tied to the hardware ID, so Google can prevent unlicensed devices from registering for GApps.
Not possible, AFAIK. Could maybe contact your local carriers and see if anyone's reported a lost phone? I know carriers have a tool where they can punch in the IMEI number and get all the details of when the device connected to their network, which was the last SIM/MSID associated with it etc.
Fair point.
Unlike Chainfire's SuperSU, Magisk is fully open source and is completely available on Github. Anyone is free to fork his work and continue in his absence.

Alternatively, there's also phh superuser, which is also open-source (and which is what Magisk su is based upon). phh's superuser is in itself forked from koush's superuser. Koush's superuser btw is what turned into cm-su, which then became Lineage-su.

**tldr**:


    koush-su --> cm-su -> lineage-su
           \
            ---> phh-su
                   \
                    ---> Magisk-su


So now you see the power of open-source? It's all one big family. You don't have to worry about Magisk becoming abandoned.

Just do exactly that, flash the ROM without wiping the data partition.

However, you're *very* likely to face bugs, especially if the unofficial build deviates significantly from the official ones. Regardless, fixing it is as simple as wiping the data partition so its not a big deal I guess (but then you'd have to set up everything again, so I suggest taking a backup first either way).
Yes, that's basically the plan lol. Get a couple of drinks first to even attempt it, then get a few more down the line to tolerate the singing. :P
> that keeps most things stock (icons, notification, etc)

But Nova doesn't change anything unless you actually change it. What do you mean by "stock" exactly? Stock Samsung? Stock Pixel?

Could you elaborate what exactly that you can't do in Nova?
Not when lying on my bed though, a phone is a lot more convenient.
You can't really "fix" that - your TV is essentially just a big LCD panel + glass + small circuit board. Guess what costs the most out of all? Yep, its the LCD panel. You can buy a replacement panel, but for a TV of that size it costs just as much as an entire TV. So you're much better off just buying a new TV, but since you've got one already then dispose off the broken one at a recycling centre (or you could try selling it for $1 reserve on Trade Me, might be useful for spare parts for a repair person).

I've stopped using all battery apps like BetterBatteryStats, Greenify etc since I use Oreo and LineageOS to limit what runs in the background and on startup and limit what stuff all apps have access to, so I don't really have any battery drain.
Huawei unfortunately has aggressive memory management, so it unnecessarily freezes or kills off apps in the background. You can't change this behaviour without root or a custom ROM unfortunately.
Switch to a different gallery app. [Piktures](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.diune.pictures) does exactly what you've asked for - it'll simply rotate an existing image, no questions asked, no copies created. Just open the image - menu (three vertical dots) - rotate left/tight. Done.
Just flash a boot.img file that includes Magisk, you don't need the whole ROM.

You can do this from the Magisk Manager app. Of course, you'll need the boot.img file first from your current ROM. Once you have that, follow the installation instructions here: https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445
Sadly, no. The Mini uses a completely different chipset (NovaThor instead of Exynos).
Why do you want it add it to a ROM? I'd recommend keeping the two separate as Magisk is updated regularly (as are ROMs) so it becomes a pain to keep integrating the zips every time something changes.
Still seems a bit off. BurgerFuel is a burger joint, this just looks like an attempt at viral marketing, with everyone wearing the BurgerFuel T-shirts and that big logo at the back.
Yep, I feel the same way. All the fire/safety drills I've been in have always consisted of knowing how to evacuate a building, but never how to operate an extinguisher. I suppose in most cases it'd be best to leave the firefighting to the professionals, but there may be situations where you could take care of small minor fires yourself before it becomes major.
I feel like you're asking for help with a homework assignment...

Good point, but still a fake. The "second time" then would be a different camera angle of the same fall, which begs the question why did they have a dedicated camera focusing on a treadmill that no one was on?
Have you tried an alternative gallery app like Piktures?

Well, it you want to be a slave to Microsoft, then sure, whatever floats your boat.
No, because you don't seem to want to put any effort. PCMR isn't about buying some prebuilt PC and downloading games. PCMR is about setting up your machine exactly the way you want it to be, to mold it do what *you* want it to, to be in full control, to be its MASTER not its slave. This is what separates us from console users. This is what PCMR is all about.
Well we're in r/pcmasterrace after all, if you can't put in the effort might as well go back to being a console pleb. :P
You don't need to reboot, just Ctrl+Alt+Backspace to kill and restart the X server. But the proper way to do this though would be to run the command *sudo systemctl restart sddm.service*, which will restart X and all graphical applications (Ubuntu users should instead restart *lightdm.service*)
You can get an older graphics card for Linux for cheap, which is what I do.

And you don't need to run a VM for Netflix, you can get it to run in full res in Linux just fine with a Chrome extension (check the Netflix sub, can't post the link here unfortunately.. Stupid automod..)
You don't need to reboot, just run Windows in a virtual machine, then Windows becomes just another app you can switch to for running windowsy stuff.
There's no reason why you can't have the best of both worlds - have both Linux and Windows installed.

If you're technically challenged though, instead of struggling with Wine you could use PlayOnLinux or Crossover instead - both of which are built on Wine but provide a fully graphical interface with wizards to install most common games/apps. Most of the older games work just fine eg Skyrim, Diablo 3, WoW etc work perfectly (in both Wine and Crossover/PoL) without requiring any sort of special treatment. Outside of Wine, there's tons of games ported to Linux natively, check Steam for Linux, which has a steadily increasing library of games. Also, most emulators work just fine as well so you have *thousands* of gaming titles available which work just fine on Linux. Which means you really only need Windows for playing the most recent games. 

If you *really* want to take this to the next level though, instead of dual-booting, set up a VirtualBox VM with Windows and pass thru your graphics card - this way you can play your games inside Windows while still running Linux. The advantage of this is that when Windows does its updates, it won't hold your entire PC hostage - you could still play another game or do something else in Linux while Windows does it's thing, and then switch back Windows when it's all done. And the best part of a VM is that it's super simple to take snapshots and restore to an earlier snapshot if an update fails for whatever reason.

So yea, if you're smart about it you can get the best of both works - stability, security and reliability of Linux + gaming/app compatibility of Windows + added bonus of near-instant backups and restores.

Don't be a slave to technology. Use technology to make it your slave. This is how you achieve zen level of PCMR.
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.

Yeah. Problem is they're all a bit *too* focused on a specific technology/tool, and if you're interested in multiple technologies you'd be stretched too thin, also this makes it a bit overwhelming for non-specialists. Eg, there's the Drupal meetup and while I'm interested in Drupal I'm not really keen on attending a regular meetup specifically for Drupal.

It'll be good if there were just a general tech meetup which is accessible for everyone, where you could discuss anything tech under the sun and talk about all the cool projects you've worked on and meet people from different walks of life.

No doubt to capture the portal up there. ;)
Good suggestion. Cape Palliser has stunning views (particularly from the lighthouse) and tons of friendly seals just chilling along the road! I dunno if they've fixed the shitty road though, went down there late last year and it was a bit annoying drive on that stretch near the lighthouse.

This isn't an Android issue, it's a Samsung issue. I have a Nexus 6P with Oreo and Netflix works fine with nightlight on. Trust Samsung to unnecessarily change core Android things and break them, as usual... This is one of the many many reasons why I sold my Note 8 after fighting with it for a few months, I just couldn't take it any more. So much happier now going back to my old phone.

**Edit**: As the person below mentioned, it could potentially be a device specific issue. Have you tried a factory reset yet, u/JThaddeousToadEsq? But before you do that I'd suggest checking your display/color calibration settings (eg change from dynamic to standard if you've got that option) or turn off the video enhancer if you've got that.

How can the site be real if our eyes aren't real?
First of all I never gave a "guarantee", so stop putting words in my ass.

Second, you've taken my comment out of context. Read my parent comment, which says:

> They may be a bit more expensive than eBay but they're always OEM/genuine parts (**unless otherwise mentioned**).

The /genuine bit implies they aren't necessarily OEM but they aren't some fake ass parts you'd find on ebay.

Third, my second comment was talking specifically about the Nexus 4 battery, which I've ordered myself in the past and it was a genuine part. 

Also, the fuck is wrong with you? I'm promoting your site here dumbass and you're acting like some fucking idiotic and pedantic rude cunt who hates his job. But good job revealing your identity, Matt, I'm sure your employers will be pleased with your behaviour. Fucking idiot.
Um, maybe you should read that link yourself. It's warning against third-party sellers. iFixit isn't some bs site. If you have a more trustworthy supplier than then please share. FWIW, I've purchased batteries and other parts from them before and they were genuine.

Edit: Since the followup comments were seemingly deleted, thought I'd clarify:

- First of all, I never "guaranteed" that it's a always an OEM part

- The parts aren't necessarily always OEM, but can also be third-party replacements. Regardless, they are high quality and work as advertised. You genuine I mean they are what they're advertised as, and do not conk out after a week like the random batteries you get on eBay.

- The Nexus 4 battery I linked above was indeed an OEM part, but this was when I purchased it two years ago, so it could have changed now. Regardless, if it's aftermarket it'll be of a high quality, plus you get a 12 month warranty if it doesn't hold up to its promise.

You could try Fixez but they do not always have OEM parts in stock. 

Alternatively you could use a parcel forwarding service for iFixit to ship outside the US.

OEM part, ships worldwide, 1-year warranty, won't rip you off like a random eBay guy.
You could also get a cable pipe (or that twirly thingy you can twirl around wires, like a binder) so instead of having multiple cables you just have one pipe going up. And put your PC near one of the legs so the pipe runs along the back and it's invisible.
Geez, that's stink. :( It's not right for schools to force students to buy proprietary software and not even make it available with a license. I mean studying is pretty expensive as it is.

One thing you could do though is ask your mates if they're willing to share their CC subscription - I do the same with a few other subscription services and that way at least you can split the costs. :)

Not sure if that was a deliberate typo... lol.
Um, do not buy batteries from eBay. Always source them from a trusted supplier, like iFixit or Fixez. They may be a bit more expensive than eBay but they're always OEM/genuine parts (unless otherwise mentioned). I've bought many batteries from both sites and never had any issues.
I use [Island](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oasisfeng.island) to run certain apps with secondary accounts or for testing/sandboxing. It's based on Android's built-in multi-user/Android-for-work features.

1. Report it to your carrier. Most carriers have a dedicated Call Investigations team who specialise in investigating the source of such calls and blocking them. Make sure you note down the numbers and timestamps.

2. Which phone are you using? If you're on an Android, you could use [Calls Blacklist](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vladlee.easyblacklist) to block those numbers - you can block a specific range of numbers and unknown/private numbers - and if that doesn't help you can even use the whitelist mode which allows calls only from your contacts.

Then what's the difference between high speed and high quality? I always thought high speed just blocked the domains.
The first steps would be going thru your apps list and disabling everything that you don't use or require, anything that's not critical to the functionality you seek from the car phone. It's really simple, the less stuff you have enabled, the less stuff you need to worry about. I'd also look at replacing some of the apps that you use with lightweight versions for even better saving and fewer interruptions.

The next step is turning off Sync and enabling Airplane mode when you're not using your phone. Disabling background sync will prevent apps from waking up the background to sync, and airplane mode has the added advantage of not only turning off all network connections but also all radios, which should result in significant battery savings when idle.

If you've got root however, there are a ton more things you can do.
Or you could download SwiftKey, which has a built-in clipboard manager.
The OnePlus camera unfortunately can't be better, but with the modded GCam app it's almost at par. Still suffers at low light scenes but for the most part it's pretty good with GCam.
You can't, unless you've got root.
They're probably busy porting all their bloatware and crap to the new version of Android and are probably having trouble integrating it with the new Android version.

This is why I always recommend getting a stock Android, or a stock-ish Android device. The lesser manufacturer bloat, the faster the updates, the fewer the attack vectors and the better the performance.
As others have said, Android tablets are dead. Don't get them. It's a waste of money. You're better off buying an iPad. And this is coming from an Android fanboy, who's been using Android since v1.6. Unfortunately Google has singlehandedly killed off the platform, there's nothing we can do about it really.

The Switch has nothing to do with this btw. If what you're really after is though is a portable gaming device, I'd highly recommend getting the **GPD WIN 2** instead - you can run even run PUBG without any issues and have a full Steam library + console emulators at your disposal, making it arguably the best portable gaming device on the market currently. And because the WIN is essentially a PC, is infinitely more powerful and customisable than any Android device on the market currently.
Except, AdHell2 has been discontinued and no longer supported. And it's replacement, SABS has been served a DMCA notice by Samsung. Basically Samsung doesn't want us using their KNOX APIs, which is only meant for businesses.
Yes, as I mentioned sometimes the root application can be bundled with the firmware, but I wouldn't recommend that. It's best that you root the device yourself by flashing the root app (hopefully it's Magisk) so that you:

- always have the latest version of the root apps
- know what you're doing and how to revert it
- know that you aren't installing any malware or other malicious applications
Yes, but I don't think that'll solve the issue here. I'd say if it's possible, open the files in another computer or another application (like Simple EXIF viewer) and see if you can check the metadata there.
There's also CopperheadOS, if you're on a Pixel/Nexus device.

As I said before, the Google SUPL servers are no longer used - even if it's not in your GPS.conf. Of course, this may depend on your device/ROM.

I just tested this on my Nexus 6P with official LineageOS. I don't have SUPL_HOST defined. Requested a GPS fix and checked my firewall, the AGPS data is downloaded from izatcloud.net, a service which is run by Qualcomm (you can check the WHOIS records if you want).

Yes, it was based on Google's own hidden code called App Ops, but it's grown a lot since then.

> 1. The jargon to me especially is impenetrable. ROM to me means "read only memory". I really don't see how anything in the entire process fits the definition of "ROM".  
Is a ROM the same as firmware, and is that the Android operating system?  
And when you root, do you install a modified version of the official firmware?

You're right that ROM means Read Only Memory, and while that's not technically true here, it is in effect, because the ROM here refers to the system image (firmware), which is typically a zip file. The system image is basically an image of your /system partition, which is where the OS lives, and this partition is mostly read-only (hence the name, ROM). I say mostly because its changed to read/write mode when applying OS updates - but besides that, it's always in a read-only state.

The terms ROM and firmware is therefore interchangeable, although firmware can also refer to the low-level firmware that's separate from the OS, namely the modem/bootloader/vendor firmware.

> And when you root, do you install a modified version of the official firmware?

No. Rooting basically involves copying the superuser daemon ("su") and installing an app which manages access to it, so an app requiring root privileges needs to go thru the management app, which either grants or denies access.

However, there are third party or modified versions of the official firmware which are pre-rooted, but 99% of the time there's no need to install these, in fact, I would highly recommend you avoid such firmware.

> So then there seems to be the recovery image, is it synonymous with bootloader? 

No. The recovery image refers to the recovery OS, which is a complete standalone OS that lives separately to your main Android ROM (typically in the /recovery partition). This is a minimal, barebones OS who's primary functions include applying firmware updates, formatting partitions, backup etc.

> What more can you tell me about how this works? 
In my mind, it fulfils some of the same functionality as the BIOS on a PC, is that a good (partial) analogy?

No, it's not the BIOS. As mentioned above, it's basically a second operating system that has a similar or sometimes the same kernel as your main Android OS, but it's not android - it's more like a core Linux OS with some Android libraries loaded for basic functionality. All devices have a recovery, but you might want to install a custom recovery (eg: TWRP Recovery) and the main reason for this is because TWRP doesn't check for the signature of the firmware, meaning you can flash unofficial firmware or mods etc without any issues (official recoveries only allow flashing of zips signed by the manufacturer). TWRP also provides a touch interface whereas most sock recoveries do not. Other features include full backup/restore of all or specific partitions, converting of filesystems between various types, USB MTP support, USB OTG support, built-in file manager etc.

> If my phone is Android version 6.0.1, then what does the build number refer to? Is that just a more specific version number than just "6.0.1"?

6.0.1 is just the OS version. The build number basically goes into a bit more detail, typically this number changes for with every monthly update or patch. Basically this changes with every update/release, aka "build". The OS version only changes when there's an OS-level update, eg feature additions or major bugfixes. To get the build number go into Settings - About - Build Number (exact location of this may differ on different devices/ROMs)

> What is Magisk? I can't even guess what this is but it pops up in my searches everywhere.

Magisk is a root management app and a "systemless" module installer. It proves a root daemon ("su"), an application to manage root, a method to hide root and mark a device as "certified", and a repository of user-installable modules which are installed at the system level, but without actually modifying the /system partition.
The A-GPS thing is increasingly becoming untrue, many of the newer devices no longer connect to Google's SUPL server. The best way to check is look at your gps.conf file (which is also slowly becoming irrelevant btw).

One of the main advantages of AdGuard over others is the ability to whitelist specific websites, which isn't possible with other DNS-based or hosts based adblockers.

Plus, AdGuard detects cryptomining scripts and even shows you a prompt that a website is using a cryptomining script.
Do all their servers support WireGuard? Also, what are the speeds like? I'd like to use it for HD video streaming. I've tried Nord and ExpressVPN and the performance can be a hit or miss at times. I'm hoping WireGuard can help with that.
As you can see the driver swerved at the last second to avoid hitting the vehicle. At that second he was probably off his phone or whatever distracted him. If he realised that there were people directly in his path he could have *potentially* taken further corrective action. Regardless, not wearing high-vis clothing on a road like that at night time is stupid. I've never seen a single cop here without a high-vis vest at a checkpoint at night.
So, Log Horizon?
It's the same (or at least, similar). Type "dir" and check if you can see all the files. What you want is the fastboot file. If you can see it, and your phone is connected and in fastboot mode, type ".\fastboot devices" - that should show your device, if all is OK. Then run the same command except type. \fastboot oem unlock *code* , where *code* is your unlock code from the Huawei website.
Hi all, new to this sub. Is there a recommended viewing order for all the Fate/ series?
Yep, the very same. Maybe it's a macOS issue? Have you checked the EXIF fields in the Preview app? Open the photo, click on Tools - Show location info - and under the "i" tab select EXIF. That should show you all the metadata including the recorded date/time.
Yep, it can work using a WiFi hotspot. I agree it's really odd that it should also affect a flash drive. 

I'm just looking at the date created/modified fields.

Here's a screenshot of a photo I just transferred https://i.imgur.com/CA9EpOl.png
> The encryption isn't very good from what I understand

It's more than good enough for photos and normal media. What, are you trying to transfer some company secrets or government files or something? If you're that paranoid then just use your own WiFi network or hotspot, problem solved.

> Also the rest of the app is built to allow remote control, which is definitely not what I want.

So don't use that part. It works fine for file transfers. Remote control requests come up with an extra prompt on your phone, it's not on all the time and certainly not unattended without your permission. I also see that you're using LineageOS, so you can restrict its permissions and limit them to just file transfer.

> After moving the files, I'm checking "get info" in finder. The main data point I'm looking at is date modified. They all show up as the date I moved the file

That is odd. I just transferred some photos from my Nexus 6P to my MacBook via AFT and checked "Get info" like you did, and the date created/modified are the original dates the photo was taken. What phone are you using?
UTC time converted to PST, most likely.

Yes, but it's encrypted. Also, connecting to it requires authentication. Also, its not enabled all the time, so I don't think you should have any concerns.

Although I'm curious why you think the metadata isn't preserved when copying files to a USB? What metadata exactly are you looking at? How did you create that file (which application)? And which application are you using on your Mac to verify that it has lost that metadata?
As others said, airplane mode/power off. But there are other ways to find out whether or not you've left your apartment, like social networks. Might be best for both of you not to log on to any social media sites. And maybe prepare an alibi for yourself in Arizona (and prepare a super boring day plan so they won't go into detail) in case they ask any questions
> 1.) My understanding is that the 15.1 LineageOS build for the Pixel XL 2 is very new, unofficial, and still has a lot of bugs (like sim recognition and no wifi calling).  Do you think that will remain the case for a while or will it get better in time?  Do you know if the oneplus flagship build is any closer to being stable/flawless?

The Pixel builds will likely get better over time. The OnePlus builds are however currently stable. As mentioned earlier, OnePlus devices are way more root/ROM friendly than Pixel. OnePlus even gives out free devices to community devs on XDA to promote the root/ROM community, which is awesome.

> 2.) I've read several places about hardware backdoors on chinese phones, and specfically about Oppo and oneplus having data breach issues.  Do you think those worries have merit for the current oneplus flagship?

The rumours of hardware backdoors have nothing to do with the data beach issues. The data breach concerns are easily squashed by switching to a custom ROM like LineageOS. As for the hardware backdoors, no ones found anything concrete yet so your guess is as good as mine. If there are indeed secret hardware backdoors, then we're probably already doomed as most devices are manufactured in China these days.
The old Disconnect is gone. The only thing that remains is a browser addon, which only works in the Samsung browser. AdHell2, SABS etc have all been discontinued due to Samsung coming down on them because all those apps all use restricted KNOX APIs which is meant for businesses, not end users. Sure, there may be some new app on XDA tomorrow which uses these APIs but there's no guarantee that won't be taken down. Regardless, it's clear that it's something Samsung doesn't want end users using. So I wouldn't count on it if I were you.
I wouldn't recommend the Note 8, it was a pain to root due to the 7 day jail. Although you might get lucky and get a variant that doesn't have it. I ended up selling mine though because of it. Also, once you root the Note 8 (or any other Samsung device), you trip the KNOX eFuse which leads to permanent loss of some Samsung features, which greatly reduces the resale value of the phone (as I found out the hard way). The Note 8 (and similar Samsungs) also have a lot of annoyances, eg constant prompts treating you like a kid and no way to turn them off (eg: every time you turn on the hotspot it says 'turning on the hotspot turns off WiFi' or some such crap. I mean ffs Samsung I get it, I'm not stupid, but do you *really* need to annoy me with that message every effing time?!). If you're nit-pickey like me, I wouldn't recommend a Samsung.
> I think you need to root and get adaway or something similar to eliminate all ads without using a VPN.  Is this true?

This is correct. All other apps like DNS66, Blockada, AdGuard create a local VPN - unless if you have root, of course.

> The Pixel 2 XL decision follows along from here, because if I need to root I don't want to void the warranty and as far as I know only Google has a current gen flagship where you can root and not void it.  Not to mention very easy bootloader unlock.

OnePlus devices can also be rooted without voiding the warranty. The root process is way more easier on OnePlus devices though as you don't have the A/B partition system too worry about.

> 2) [...]  I'm assuming this means magisk would need to be flashed *prior* to the factory image now?

No, if you flash Magisk prior to flashing factory, it'll just override Magisk. Just flash Magisk after you unlock the bootloader.

> root..   

Magisk *is* root. To flash Magisk you need to unlock the bootloader. Which wipes the data. So just unlock the bootloader the first thing you get your phone, and flash Magisk.

> probably the easiest to get stock images
Getting the OnePlus stock images is just as easy. 

> hardest to bootloop if I fuck up
It's easier to bootloop a Pixel compared to a OnePlus, due to its A/B partition system.

> My understanding is that the Pixel as setup above will probably only have google+carrier receiving data

Out of the box, yes. But as soon as you install any third-party application, that assumption goes out of the window. If you want to preserve your privacy while using third-party apps, I would highly recommend getting LineageOS, as it has an awesome feature called Privacy Guard, which prevents your private data from leaking unless you explicitly allow it (also allows better battery life by preventing apps from running on startup and in the background). Since you're planning to flash Magisk, you might as well consider LineageOS because its really the same step. LineageOS is just another zip you flash. Since you're not ready to go Google-free yet you could flash the GApps zip as well, so you'd still have the advantage of the Google ecosystem and the privacy features of LineageOS. As a bonus, if you have LineageOS then installing OTA updates while having Magisk installed isn't a big deal (it's fully automated), however if you use the stock ROM on a Pixel with Magisk then OTAs are a bit of a pain.

However, if you're new to all this then I guess it's OK to just stay on stock and stick with Magisk. 

> 4) [...] My understanding is that if I do need to root, OTA updates will be a no-go and every time I want to update, I'll have to re-flash everything basically.

Not everything. You just need to restore your bootloader, apply the OTA then restore Magisk. It's a bit of a pain but if you have LineageOS or any other custom ROM, you don't need to so this these ROMs have a functionality to automatically restore Magisk. As for reliability/stability, you don't have to worry about that with Pixel or OnePlus or LineageOS (on either devices). Both devices are quite stable and work fine without any major issues on both the stock ROM and LineageOS.
You've probably drained the battery completely. I'd suggest just leaving it on charging overnight and try again tomorrow.
Magisk doesn't interfere with the bootloader or recovery. You shouldn't have any issues booting into recovery if you've flashed it properly.
There's no study because there's no direct correlation. There are far too many variables involved, starting from the battery size and screen resolution to various software/hardware optimisations. In reality you can't make a choice based on your screen size.

Your best bet would be to go to [PhoneArena](https://www.phonearena.com/phones/benchmarks) or [Gsmarena](https://www.gsmarena.com/battery-test.php3?idPhone=6074) and pick a phone which has been benchmarked for a high battery life.

Personally though if you ask me, people should stop worrying about the battery life and just get the phone that they want + a portable battery pack. That way you can actually *enjoy* using the phone instead of worrying about the battery. After all, if you wanted the highest battery life you could get yourself a dumbphone that lasts a week, but what's the point of that?

How about AirDroid?
Yay! Thanks for this.
Nope - that's the best part of OnePlus devices - your warranty *isn't* void! That and its overall root-friendlyness (easy to root, easy to restore) makes it a pretty good device to mess around with root and ROMs etc.
Now that you mention it, yeah that's likely the case here. :/
Well it's hard to say *exactly* what all it did without downloading the app and decompiling it, so to be on the safe side, if I were you, I'd change all my important passwords ASAP (on a different device) and factory reset the phone. You can't really trust apps like that these days, and the Play Store has been known to carry such malicious apps in the past (like the infamous WhatsApp clone that had millions of downloads).
Do you have access to a PC? If so you could just flash TWRP again.
Well all the OnePlus devices since the OP3 have received very positive reviews, so it's highly unlikely that the OP6 will be "awful". If anything, OxygenOS might be shit (it's certainly getting shittier) but you always the option of installing a decent ROM like LineageOS.
It's dangerous. Just take a look at all those permissions: https://i.imgur.com/XBkZ4YJ.png

Do you have a bootable Linux USB stick? If so, just boot from it and see if it works. If it works, then it's an issue with your Windows installation, possibly a corrupted driver or system file. 
If you're still in Linux then you can still copy/recover your stuff from your Windows drive to an external drive. From there you've got two options, you could try and repair your existing installation (boot Windows into Safe Mode - Shift+F8 - system restore) or try reinstalling Windows from a bootable Windows USB.
Sell.

I'm serious. Old servers like those are very loud and consume a lot of power, and the specs aren't good enough to do anything worthwhile. You'd be better off buying a Raspberry Pi or ODroid or similar - occupies *far* less space, no noise and uses negligible power.

Same as the others, you'll need to register on the Huawei website to receive the unlock code after which you just type *fastboot oem unlock <code>*
From the S8/ Note 8 onwards, Samsung introduced a new "feature" which prevents you from unlocking the bootloader until you've used your device for 7 days after the initial boot, so basically you have to wait 7 days before you can root your device. 

Now that in itself isn't a big deal, but the problem is under some conditions that 7 day counter resets or something and your bootloader becomes locked and you get a red "untrusted binaries" screen and you're stuck at boot. The only way out is to flash the full stock firmware and waiting for 7 more days before you can root again.

I ended up selling my Note 8 after putting up with this for two months - my device kept going back into the jail and I had to keep reformatting and re-flashing and re-setting up everything. It was possibly the most annoying device ever I had to deal with, never have I had so many issues in rooting a device, and I've been rooting Android devices since 2009.
What do you mean by you "can't get ADB to work"? Is there an error message? Where exactly you're getting stuck? Can you upload a screenshot?
Seconded.
This is incorrect.

1. Snapdragon versions are locked down
2. Many variants now have a "7 day jail" limitation
3. Rooting voids warranty
4. You *permanently* lose some Samsung features such as Samsung Pay, Secure Folder, Private Browsing etc

My cousin had a car that used to say something in Japanese when you turned it on. I thought it was greeting us or something so I used to play along and say something back in my broken Japanese (ohayo gozaimasu). Made me feel like in was in the Japanese version of Knight Rider.

> Camera seems better all round on the Huawei but I hate EMUI.

It supports Treble though, so you should see AOSP ROMs ported to it shortly. Also, previous Huaweis have all had the camera APK ported to AOSP as well so it's likely to be the same for the P20. Which means you get all the benefits of the camera + stock Android.

Because its not really worth it for modern batteries. My 2.5year old Nexus 6P still has 94% of its original capacity, and I don't do any sort of battery care. Pretty much charge my phone all the time. Even if I use it for 3 years, the degradation wouldn't be enough for me to lose any sleep on it.

> Any legit automated methods to root an Android?

No. And the reason for that is there is no "Android". What you're referring to as "Android" is a highly customised, device-specific variant built by your manufacturer. Unlike Windows/PCs, most Android devices have locked-down bootloaders (by default) and various security features implemented which means making a universal one-click-root method is very impractical.

Now bear in mind that there *used* to be an such an application back in the day, but it worked due to the author manually programming in specific root methods and bundling all the individual tools and scripts for each device. Eventually it was abandoned because of the sheer number of devices out there and the complexities and the headaches of keeping all those tools and scripts updated for each variant and carrier and Android version. For instance, Samsung alone makes more than an dozen variants of just their flagship Galaxy S device - and I'm not even taking about the Note or the A series or J series, or their previous years releases. And this is all just Samsung, never mind other manufacturers. So you can imagine the difficulties in maintain such a tool, if one existed.

Finally, it's not a good idea to automate the process because rooting isn't for everyone, as it comes with several drawbacks, including, but not limited to:

- Unable to directly apply OTA updates
- Possibility of bricking the device
- Voiding the warranty
- *Permanently* losing some features (due to tripping of the eFuse on Samsung devices)
- Breaking device certification so some apps may no longer work (Netflix, Snapchat, Pokémon Go, banking apps)

Of course, there are fixes/workarounds etc for most of the drawbacks, but it's a cat-and-mouse game, constantly fighting against Google and other corporations. 
It's a huge hassle for the average user, it requires a lot of time/effort. If you're already not into rooting then you probably have a busy lifestyle filled with other hobbies or actives. Rooting is a full time hobby, something you need to keep yourself up-to-date with and it requires a lot of reading and technical know-how of how Android works and keeping abreast of all the new Android releases, all the new root tools, all the new anti-root features... 

This is why something like this should never be automated.

Conceptually it's the same, it's even served with something similar to raita (yogurt/cucumber/green chilies). Only difference here is the presentation. :) Most of middle-east to South-east Asian countries have a similar dish.
Yes but no distro forces you to update. In fact majority of the updates do not even require a reboot. Another huge advantage is that when you do reboot, you have none of the nonsensical "windows is preparing to update" message. Post-update reboots are instantenous and don't hold you hostage like Windows does.

Plot twist: that is his phone. Maybe he's running Android x86 on his PC.
Depends. Plain Bluetooth? Sure. But if your Bluetooth headphones support aptX-HD or LDAC then the quality is comparable to wired. Is it the same though? No. Is it technically worse than wired? Of course. But most people aren't able to discern the difference, especially if all they want to do is enjoy the music and not deliberately nitpick upon the minute differences. Heck, I consider myself an audiophile but even I don't mind using my Bluetooth headphones (ATH-DSR9BT) and listen to Spotify (compressed music, omg the horror!!) over my Beyerdynamic DT880 + FiiO E17.

But I do have a complaint and that is with the current state of Bluetooth earbuds. No decent ones out there with aptX-HD and with a decent battery life. :(
Off topic: I really wish they updated the Robin to 15.1.
Possibly. But bear in mind that we're now living in a post-Cambridge Analytica world, suddenly everyone's more conscious about corporations snooping on their lives (whether or not it's a knee-jerk reaction is a different story). So it's possible that even Pixel users who bought their phones for the OS, are looking at alternatives to Google services.
Not everyone buys a device for its OS. Eg: see all the people excited about flashing AOSP (Treble) on the Galaxy S9.

> There's a huge stumbling block with that goal in that they're using someone else's OS. I

That's not an issue, they could just fork Android, like Amazon did.

> I love Samsung, but I'm an Android fan first

You may be, but most users don't care about "Android" or even know that their "Galaxy" is an Android phone (or what it means). Heck, even Google seems to be moving away from the Android branding.

> they'd have most of their customer base questioning whether their OS worked as well as Android

Again, most customers don't care about things like the operating system. Heck, most of them wouldn't even know what an "OS" is. For most people, a phone is like an appliance, a washing machine or toaster. They don't care what's inside it or how it works, as long as it does the job.

And that is what Samsung's taking an advantage of, by pushing their own stores and apps front-and-centre, if they can convince enough of the popular app makers to publish apps on their store (which isn't a big task), then Samsung could do a bait-and-switch and most people won't even notice it.
This isn't Oreo's fault, it's Samsung's. People should stop blaming stuff on Oreo/Google when Samsung or other OEMs customisations that are causing issues.
I'm fairly certain that YouTube Vanced doesn't require GApps. In fact installing it requires MicroG, which indicates that it uses MicroG for signing onto your Google account. The old OGYouTube app worked the same way.

Not sure why OP couldn't transfer >4GB but I can assure you it's not a limitation of Linux filesystems. Adoptable Storage uses ext4 by default, which has a max filesize limit of 16TB. Although some manufacturers use F2FS instead of ext4, in which case the max filesize limit is 3.94TB.
+1. When you have minimal bezels, there's no need for a notch. Also, its part of human nature to like symmetry, so naturally a notch-less design is more appealing. It's also the reason why people dislike asymmetric bezels (and why I wasn't a fan of the V series second screen).
It's not the ride (that matters), it's the rider.

Yes, but I don't think it's deliberate - Samsung is aiming to please enterprises (and its paying off too, what with so many companies ditching Apple), so they're trying to add in a ton of security features and controls - unfortunately root, and the kind of modifications Magisk does at the core of Android is the kind of thing they'd want to protect against. And with Blackberry out of the picture, Apple is the only big competitor for Samsung in the enterprise mobility space, which rakes in big bucks.
Not sure, but not surprising really. With each new release Samsung's making it increasingly difficult to root. Even when the S8 came out Magisk didn't work on it and topjohnwu had to explicitly add support for it (took a few tries even to fix all the bootloop issues).
I didn't come to r/gaming to cry!
A and B are very valid points. But given the timing, I'd be inclined to say it was A

C isn't though, it only costs an OEM $10,000 to get a model certified for GApps. Even for the smallest of OEMs that means the added cost is just a few cents extra per device.
As I said, it's a simplified version. I didn't even mention anything about silicon vendor's blobs for instance. The point of this was to illustrate that when most people think "Android" they don't really know what they're referring to or which organisations are involved.
"Only"? You mean to say that they don't even have a phone?
Some key points to note:

- Pokemon GO users will now need to explicitly add the app to Magisk's hide list
- Magisk currently doesn't work on Samsung S9(+)
-  **Google banning non-certified devices from Google Play Services can be worked around by installing Magisk *before* running the first-time setup.**

That last point is huge as it means you potentially don't have to waste any of your 100 tokens - as long as you flash Magisk before the initial setup. Not sure though if this also includes devices that never had Play Services installed in the first place, like Meizu...
Not exactly. Android (simplified) is made of three layers: AOSP + GApps + OEM Skin

- AOSP is the base OS. It's open source and doesn't contain any proprietary Google code (no connections are made to the Google server). 
- GApps is the Google layer, this is the proprietary Google code which starts with the Google Play Services as the base for all other Google services/apps. This layer is officially known as Google Services Framework.
- OEM Skin is the proprietary code added by device manufacturers on top of the above two layers. Typically this includes proprietary OEM apps, themes/UI customisations and additional software features and code to support propriety hardware (such as Samsung's S-Pen or KNOX). 

Ideally, you'd want to run pure Android, which is AOSP. But pure AOSP almost never works out of the box on most devices (due to missing drivers and hardware differences), which is why there exist community projects such as **LineageOS** which provide device specific easy-to-install versions of AOSP (+ extra functionality such as Privacy Guard). Of course, to replace your existing Android firmware with pure AOSP or LineageOS, your device needs to have an unlockable bootloader and the ability to load a custom recovery (TWRP Recovery), which in turn is used to "flash" these community-built firmware images. 

Now while AOSP/LineageOS alone works well without any Google Apps, unfortunately many third-party apps rely on the Google Services Framework for various functionality (such as push notifications, maps, GPS location services etc), so for most people, pure AOSP or LineageOS is virtually useless - unless you never install third-party apps on your phone.

To fill this need, there's a project called **MicroG** which re-implements some of the core functionality provided by the Gapps while mimicking their API, thereby allowing third-party apps to function again (albeit with some bugs/limitations). As expected, MicroG is a work-in-progress but it, used in conjunction with other open-source apps/services like F-Droid, Yalp store, Mozilla Unified NLP, provides a viable alternative to using Android free of proprietary Google code and with no reliance on Google services.

Hope this clarifies things a bit. :)
If it's work related then does it matter? Cause you probably have a separate work profile on a separate work phone (or at least a separate work environment like Secure Folder on Samsung or Island or similar). If you're doing work stuff on your personal phone and in the same profile, then that's dumb. Unless you're your own boss.. even then, it's always a good idea to maintain a gap between your work and personal life.

An "alternative" doesn't imply exactly the same functionality. I never said "same".

> By no extra battery life I meant there are no extra background processes

And that's because it's part of Samsung KNOX and TouchWiz, which in itself runs on top of Android. It'll consume resources just like any other service on your phone. It does not utilise zero resources.

Ah, I see it works by magic then. Nice.

You can have that in Island as well

> It is basically a seperate phone in a phone

That's essentially Island as well

> If someone wants a seprate work profile which they will use daily, it makes sense to buy a Samsung phone.

Sure, if you a) like Samsung and b) have the extra cash to throw around. Why waste money when a free app can essentially do the same?
You can still register your device. Just remember that you have only 100 tokens, so if you're only using it in Bluestacks then it's best to use a separate Google account.
I agree, but it's not very "impressive" as OP claimed.
Why would you tie yourself down to a single OEM when you can get the same or similar functionality from other apps or OEMs? It makes no sense.
I said that's one of the alternatives. Island doesn't have any of the drain. Also, the Lite version of Parallel Space doesn't have the drain either.
Nah it means 'Care Of'. He probably takes good care of PC parts.
> you got yourself a Disney short

This only ties in with KNOX to check that the device isn't tampered with. Again, this isn't anything impressive.
Yep.

Agree with everything you said, but it's not "impressive". It's not groundbreaking. It's not new. It's not unique. AKA not "impressive"
Sure we do. I don't think you've ever felt the pain of going out camping or hiking and not getting any reception on your phone. What if you're on your own and you injure yourself, need assistance but there's no coverage on your phone?
It's a sandbox, well the more accurate term would be "container".

It's nothing new or impressive though, there are similar apps which do this, eg Island and Parallel Space (although Island doesn't have an encryption option yet) which work on non-Samsung phones as well. All this is built upon Android's built-in "work profile" feature, meant for enterprises.

This honestly surprised me a bit because I didn't give the app that much credit. I was just expecting it to create an encrypted file that could still be navigated to outside of secure folder, but that didn't seem to be the case. If you navigate to the location of said download, outside of secure folder, you don't see absolutely anything stored in said location. I even used Mixplorer to look for hidden files. So pretty awesome.

It *does* create an encrypted file, well, not an individual file, but inside the encrypted filesystem/container. The reason you're not able to browse this is because that location is not accessible without root (and if you root your phone, the whole Secure Folder feature will not work). This is again not very impressive or unique to Secure Folder, as without root you can't access the private data of *any* app - not just Secure Folder.

Camera doesn't "blow". Sure its not Pixel/Samsung/Apple level but keep in mind, neither is the price. Also, the modded GCam apk works fine on the OP phones and has better quality than the stock camera (no waterpainting effect eg and Auto HDR+ is impressive).
Could be OC'd scores with thermal daemon off and the SoC being cooled externally. You can't trust random benchmarks.
Yes but not Netflix from the looks of it. :(
Oh, that's disappointing. :( in that case I might just get an Android TV box.

Apologies for the slightly off-topic question/rant, but isn't this the perfect opportunity for LineageOS to reconsider their position on allowing signature spoofing for MicroG? I think it's high time that we stop relying so much on GApps and make it easy for people to transition into a GApps-free world. This 100 token limit is ridiculous. First SafteyNet, now this. Who knows what other controls Google will enforce onto us next?

The whole point of LineageOS and similar custom ROMs is to be free from Google and OEM's control over our devices, so that we could finally be in control of the devices that we own, the devices that we paid good, hard-earned money for.. but our reliance on GApps means we're still tethered to Google and need to play by their rules...
Thanks for the detailed reply, I really appreciate it. Will check those links out!

Also, not sure if you saw my edit but the Massdrop CTRL would be my ideal keyboard and I even ordered it, but I literally just cancelled my order because I didn't realise they were shipping only from August 15. :( I live on the other side of the world so its likely that I'll get mine only in Sept. I can't wait that long lol, so I'm looking to essentially recreate the CTRL on my own (or buy something similar if it exists). :)
Newbie here, first of all, thanks for doing this guide! It's good to see some actual informative posts in this sub as opposed to people just showing off their setup... 

Some questions:

How about some links to where we can buy switches and custom keycaps? I'm interested in shine-thru Zealios 65g and shine-thru PBT keycaps with raised lettering. On the site which sells the keycaps, I'd like to mix-and-match the colors if possible, ideally with a visual key-configurator like the one they have on WASD keyboards site. So far I haven't been able to find a site like that.

You didn't mention anything about lube and stabilisers. Does the GMMK need these?

Also, does the GMMK come with QMK firmware? If not, is it programmable? Or can we override the stock firmware to QMK? If not, are there any other alternatives to GMMK?

Finally, is the USB port fixed to the centre of the keyboard, if not are there routing channels underneath the keyboard so we can have the cord come out at the corners? If not, are there any other alternatives to GMMK?

**Edit**: I should mention that the Massdrop CTRL would be my ideal keyboard, but I literally just cancelled my order because I didn't realise they were shipping only from August 15. I live on the other side of the world so its likely that I'll get mine only in Sept. I can't wait that long lol, so I'm looking to essentially recreate the CTRL on my own (or buy something similar if it exists).
TL;DR - An overwhelming majority - 74% voted for smaller phones. :) Manufacturers, are you listening? We want smaller flagships.
See [above](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/870zw8/google_now_blocks_gapps_on_uncertified_devices/dwah42k/). Not really an ELI5 unfortunately, I'm unsure how changing the Android_ID will affect GCM apps with Oreo.
Push Notifications (which use Google's GCM (now known as Firebase)), rely on the AndroidID of the app to match the device/system. If there's a mismatch, the notification will be sent to the wrong (non-existent) device and therefore you will not get any push notifications for that app. This is a fairly common issue users face when restoring backed up apps using Titanium Backup, on a different device or different ROM (as there's an Android +ID mismatch). Now, pre-Oreo this wasn't a big issue as you could just override your device's Android ID to the previous version so if you restored all your apps using Titanium, then the Android IDs for the apps would match the restored Android ID. But post Oreo, the Android ID for the system is no longer randomly generated so you can't just use any ID you please, also the Android_ID is now unique for each app and that ties in to the system's Android_ID.

I'm not sure though if the API that queries and returns the Android ID does this algorithmically, or if the ID generation is just a one-off during first setup and then then API simply returns the value from the database. If this is the case then we can simply override the system Android ID to the previous value. But I'm unsure how this affects individual apps since the Android ID is now also specific to per-app, in addition to being tied in to the device's Android ID, so if we override the system's android ID we could potentially break GCM for all the apps...
Except it breaks GCM push notifications, which relies on the AndroidID to be correct.
But won't that affect GCM push notifications? I've always had that issue if I restored my Android_ID using Titanium Backup.
Only the US and UK I believe.
> Edit:nevermind, read more into the article and comments

So what's the TL;DR version? Do we need to make a new Google account then? Or is there a way to backup and restore this?
"Most" phones? Besides Nokias and US carrier sold Snapdragon devices, most (Android) phones (globally speaking) have unlockable bootloaders.
Yes but eggrollking is from North Philly.

Dunno, might need to get a cat scan done.
> within two days it turned off suddenly during use, once with 89% battery

Hmm, that could be the infamous Nexus 6P battery issue. Your phone or battery could be dying. I'd suggest a battery replacement for a start and see if that fixes it.

> To get the appropriate firmware, do I just first flash a 7.x.x factory image for N (or 8.x.x for O) from Google's factory images page, and then LOS on top of that?

Yep, just flash the stock firmware. But you don't need the whole thing, just the bootloader, radio and vendor. http://kantjer.com/image/

Reboot your phone into bootloader mode and flash the img files manually via PC using fastboot

If you're not comfortable with the command line though the just flash the full factory image from Google.

Also, now's a good time to check that you've got the latest version of TWRP recovery installed, if you flash the full factory image you're going to need it anyways.
Too many Samsung annoyances (eg: constant prompts everywhere treating me like a kid and with no means to turn then off - "enabling WiFi Hotspot will use mobile data", gee thanks Samsung, but do you need to show me that prompt every fricking time I turn on my Hotspot?). Also, I had lots of issues rooting it, kept getting thrown in the "7 day jail" which forced me to reset and restore to stock and wait 7 days every few weeks. After about going thru two months of hell I couldn't take it any longer so I ended up selling it.
> Don't you just love the Note 8?

No, I don't, or rather I didn't - which is why I sold it.
Avoid WhatsApp. And Instagram too.
Dunno, but I keep Privacy Guard on by default and haven't had any apps crash because of it. Eg, I pretty much deny all permissions for Snapchat and while it complains that it can't access my camera, it works fine otherwise.
You can do that on pretty much any recent Android phone btw.

https://www.xda-developers.com/runinbackgroundsetter-restrict-background-processes/
Basically a period where you can't root your phone, ie the bootloader gets locked and you don't have an option to unlock it. If you get locked while you're rooted or modified your system, then you're forced to factory reset and flash the stock ROM again.. But you still have to wait for 7 days before you can unlock the bootloader and attempt rooting again.
Judging by the press renders, that's a negative to both.
Well it's launching in 3 days, this is just a teaser. Guess we'll have to wait and see.
RemindMe! 3 days "Check Indiegogo"
\* piqued
It all depends on the app and how you use it. If you use Snapchat a lot for example, then you'll be left over with several cache files. If you have a ton of friends spamming you on WhatsApp for example then you'll be left over with a ton of photos/videos etc.

Games don't leave many leftovers though in my experience, so if you uninstall PUBG it should get rid of it. I'd just check the /sdcard folder and /sdcard/Android/data/com.tencent.ig  folders to be sure there's nothing left.
My only issue is that it doesn't have Privacy Guard, so I went back to LineageOS.
> Do they leave any data behind

Yes.

[SD Maid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.thedarken.sdm)

> I'm planning on installing a 700 MB app soon and I would also like to know if I can get it with no worries

There's no guarantee unfortunately. SD Maid and the like work using a list of know leftover database. If this a brand new or some obscure app, then SD Maid will not know of its leftovers.
Adguard.

And I know it's not tracking my activity because I've monitored the outgoing traffic using Wireshark. It's safe.
That's no longer the case. The license for mp3 expired. Not that it matters much now, there are superior formats anyways.
Couldn't stand the Samsung ROM (too many little annoyances) + was having issues rooting it, kept getting thrown in the 7 day jail constantly. Got tired of going back to stock, rooting, bootlooping, getting thrown in jail again, rooting again, setting up everything again.. it was super annoying. So ended up selling it.
Yep. Also, there aren't any third-party twitter apps that can follow a hashtag in real-time - you need to keep manually refreshing it, which is a PITA for breaking events.

Good for you.
Went around 3PM, just got back home. Was bloody brilliant! Loved the percussion band + dance group performing hard out in pouring rain and little kids going to them and joining in the dance.. everyone had a stupid wide grin on their faces lol it was awesome seeing everyone enjoying themselves so much. I'd say that dancing in the rain added that extra charm to it. Then there was this group of human zebras trotting along Cuba, dancing to the tunes of different performers/music and they put on a bit of an act. Was super weird and funny. Priceless expressions on people's faces though! There was also this performance by the Wellington City Concert Band, they went around Cuba/Guzhnee/Leeds/Dixon performing different numbers at every block and the whole crowd moved along with them lol, with people joining in from their balconies and clapping along... Ooh, almost forgot about the guy juggling basketballs and a flaming torch on a one-storey tall unicycle on a wet road, that was quite the feat.

Also tried Ethiopian food for the first time, loved it! Loved the simplicity, the flavours and of course, its super healthy as well. Will definitely be returning to try out more.

And this is all just a few hours of day one! Can't wait to go back!
Not really. There's still plenty in stock at other online retailers like [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?catId=0&initiative_id=SB_20180323150912&SearchText=OnePlus+5T), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss/142-9030038-9162964?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=OnePlus+5T), [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.XOnePlus+5T.TRS0&_nkw=OnePlus+5T&_sacat=0)...
Not really. Name any other device which is around the same price ($485) and has:

- 6GB RAM + SD 835 or equivalent/better
- Headphone jack
- Global LTE bands
- Quad satnav systems (GPS, GLONASS, BDS, GALILEO)
- Rooting doesn't void warranty
- Fully functional AOSP ROMs with a large root community
> Both Amazon and eBay it's up in the $550+ range.

My point still stands. Show me any other phone that meets my requirements in that price range. 

> 5T--why does it matter if a phone has GLONASS, BDS or GALILEO? When has GPS has ever fallen short?

GPS based applications which are time and accuracy sensitive, particularly games like Ingress - getting an instant fix gives a competitive advantage in the game. On my Note 8 (which has all four) I'd get a 2 second fix time with excellent accuracy - it was awesome.

> Most NA customers wouldn't care about global LTE bands either

Sure, but I was pointing out my needs/use case. Even if you're a NA user, surely you'd go visiting other areas/countries at some point? I don't know about you, but I love to travel and especially as an Ingresser having all the LTE bands for the best speed and coverage is essential.
The modded GCam apk works well and even has better quality than stock OnePlus camera - no "water painting" effect and better sharpness.
Not really. This was never meant for people who are after the Samsung Experience, but for people who like Samsung devices for their hardware features.
Who exactly is claiming it is simple?

I've never seen anyone (or at least a decent number of people) actually recommend installing a custom ROM to ordinary people, particularly for Samsung devices where there are many, many drawbacks (and it's not as simple compared to other root-friendly devices).

Heck, I work in IT and have been messing around with phones for decades, and even I don't recommend it to any of my fellow colleagues, who are all smartphone enthusiasts and geeks. 

Rooting and ROMming is for a very nice set of people, and there are obvious drawbacks associated with it. I would never recommend it to anyone unless if I, for some odd reason, want to be that person's personal tech-support guy for the next 2-3 years... 
No
Yes, that's the whole point of this ROM...
Yep but only basic functionality since it's not possible to run the Samsung camera apk (yet).

You'd be better off running the ported Google Camera APK, but you'd still be missing on some features, but that is to be expected.
That *is* kinda the point of this thing. It's not for people who actually like Samsung experience features.
Even if the bootloader is unlocked, without Treble you can forget about a stable, fully functional ROM for the Note 8. Just check the S8 / Note 8 forums for Exynos (where the bootloader is unlocked). The ASOP ROMs they have there are pretty much gimped with even basic functionality missing. You'd be better off selling your device and getting an S9+ / Note 9 if you really want to run AOSP.
No developer edition phones, they haven't done them for a while now.
> I can only see this being good for when Samsung stops supporting the phone. Otherwise there are baking in such nice features at this point and the phones are pretty great to be honest.

Well then you aren't the target audience. This is primarily meant for people who like Samsung hardware but don't care much for the "Samsung Experience" software features. Treble finally delivers a functional and stable AOSP experience on Samsung hardware, which is a dream come true for many people.
Because it has possibly the best hardware combination? Headphone jack, microSD slot, fast UFS 2.1 storage, possibly the best AMOLED display, wireless charging, stereo speakers, IP68 rating, slim bezels with narrow aspect ratio making it easier to operate one-handed, great choice of first and third-party accessories, excellent global availability and support, excellent local support, several financing options with many vendors/carriers/workplaces offering deals, bundles, discounts.... 'nuff said? :)
Damn.

> I'm sorry, but this is definitely a wontfix. There is a culture and history to both words, it gives the software a distinct vibe, I don't care if Lance Ulanoff finds it silly.

And its exactly this sort of stubborn attitude is why this, and many other capable open-source software never really take off. I mean, what's the point of a social network if there aren't any people on there and you're doing nothing to grow its popularity?
Good bot
> Hang on, I've heard mixed things about this in general: can I root, lock my bootloader, and keep root? Somebody told me I could and should do that at some point... But it sounded wrong.

You can do that only on some devices, like OnePlus, which do not verify if the binaries have been tampered with. You can't do that on other devices though, like the Samsung. In general this isn't a good idea as you could lock yourself out and not have an easy way to restore your device if things go wrong. 


> Oh whaat? I didn't know... Do we know why he stopped? Did he say anything, or just disappear?

This is one of the things I liked the best about these books - the incredible attention to detail, and all the small minor things you'd notice every time you re-read them. Like in the panel you linked, I love how Prof Calculus is the only one unperturbed while there's chaos everywhere.
> Hmmm... I guess I could also unroot, upgrade, and reroot, right?

Yep, that would be the safest option.

> Can I lock/unlock the bootloader freely after the first 7 days in hell? Or would I have to wait 7 days after each lock?

Good question, I'm not sure.. But why you'd want to relock the bootloader though (it's not a requirement for an update)? I'd advise against relocking it unless if you're sure you're 100% stock, wiped the phone and intending to pass it on someone else/sell it.

>  And... The S9\+ exynos would be pretty popular, why wouldn't he support it?

Oh, not saying he wouldn't support it, but I haven't heard anything yet so far. Chainfire has been inactive for nearly 6 months now (as in not made any announcements nor updated Flashfire in this period), so if you haven't bought the S9 yet I wouldn't make any purchase decisions on that basis and wait for some confirmation first and also see how the whole jail thing plays out. That is, if you're really keen on root. If root is something optional for you that you'd *like* to have but can live without, then yeah go ahead and buy the phone I suppose.
Yeah, that might work, potentially. I'd check with Chainfire first because I've had bootloops with Flashfire in the past when using it out unsupported devices (I never tried it on recent Samsung devices though). I mean, the bootloop is nothing you can't fix, but it sucks if you'd have to go back to stock and wait for 7 days again every time..

MalwareBytes doesn't install any crap though. Not sure what OP's on about.
I'm really curious as to how you may have gotten infected, as it's pretty hard to get a virus these days (if you follow safe computing practices). 

- Do you not use an adblocker?
- Do you use IE / Edge? 
- Do you install random apps from random websites?
- Do you torrent/install pirated apps or cracks?
- Do you ever plug in random USBs?
- Do you not update Windows regularly?

I don't use Windows much at home these days, but I thought the days of people getting infected randomly have been long gone, at least in my experience. Haven't really come across any infected PCs in recent times, whereas in the past (back in the XP days), I used to be hounded by calls every week to help clean up someone's PC...
But does it compare to the money I've spent on Battlefront 2? ^/s

This was never meant for people who were after the Samsung experience to begin with. So if it's not "worth" it for you, you aren't the target audience.
Only thing you'd be gaining is faster and more frequent updates.

You could try uninstalling the apps that are crashing, reboot and then try reinstalling them. That should override the corrupted data - unless, there's some common database/files there also corrupted in which case you'll have to separate the two and format the SD Card and use it separately.
Well, obviously it works or else it wouldn't even be an option in the first place. The fact of the matter is the filesystem is corrupted.

Your mixed SD card is the culprit. SD cards are notoriously unreliable for storing application data. I'd recommend you format it and use it just to store media.

We just used the Microsoft Deployment Toolkit - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/upgrade/upgrade-to-windows-10-with-system-center-configuraton-manager - worked like a charm.

Office/Outlook wasn't an issue as we were already on 2016/O365, but it should also work for older versions of Office.
The universe will implode.
Nope, you can still buy the phones but you could always [download it](https://copperhead.co/android/downloads) as well. AOSP also works pretty well on Nexus/Pixel phones, but Sony phones are also a good choice if you just want to run pure AOSP (Sony even provide official build/documentation for this).
There are Linux phones already, check out the phones by Jolla and Pureism.

Alternatively you could buy a Nexus or Pixel phone and load a pure AOSP ROM without any proprietary/Google code. CopperheadOS is a good bet, it's pretty privacy oriented and is integrated with F-Droid and supports Gapps signature spoofing.
Systemless isn't the issue here though. Depending on which variant of S9 you get, rooting can be very difficult to next to impossible.

The Qualcomm versions for instance have a locked bootloader, so you can forget about those. And for some of the Exynos variants, they have this thing called the 7-day jail which forces you to wait for 7 days before you root your device, but once you do, sometimes it resets on some conditions (eg say Magisk gets updated and you do a factory reset or an OTA or something) and then you get stuck in boot loop, forcing you to go back to full stock and you have to wait for 7 more days and got thru that all over, sometimes several times. Many people have been facing the 7-day hell since the Note 8 was released and have gotten rid of their devices because of this (like me). 

Of course, it's possible there's an Exynos variant of the S9 that doesn't have this, but I'm not sure which models do and which ones don't, and whether that variant would be fully compatible with your carrier.

Finally, don't forget that once you unlock the bootloader you trip the KNOX eFuse, which leads to permanent loss of some Samsung features like Samsung Pay, Secure Folder, Private Mode in Samsung Internet, Samsung Pass etc. This many not be a big deal for you, but since you can't restore these features even after you unroot, it greatly reduces the resale value of the device (I lost a good amount of money when I sold my Note 8 because the eFuse was tripped).

All this makes modern Galaxy devices NOT root friendly at all, depending on your variant/resell intentions/luck.

Sadly Android Studio isn't available for ARM, but there are alternatives such as [AIDE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aide.ui).
Depends on what you're programing in and what toolset you want to use, but you can most certainly program and compels stuff on Android. Eg Termux for Android has a full-fledged package manager from which you can install full development environments, and if that's not enough you can always chroot into a Linux distro on most phones and have access to a full-blown OS, running all on your phone.
Except the ending.
I dunno about the S7, but it's definitely not possible on a Note 8 (not yet anyways).
It's not just Samsung Pay though. Also, if you sell you're phone it could greatly reduce the resale value as these features are lost permanently. Of course if you don't plan on selling your phone anytime soon and you don't intend to use any of the Samsung features then it's not a big deal.
> How i can see if my custom ROM has virus in it?

You can't, not unless you're a developer and have access to the full source code or the patience and skills to dig thru verbose logs and enable tons of debugging and run test cases.

If a dev compiled a ROM on their own its not too hard to add a few extra lines of code which does malicious stuff (eg: steal passwords). Custom code like that won't be detectable by your typical virus scanner. 

Your best bet is to change all your passwords ASAP (using a PC or some other phone) and do a full factory reset and revert back to stock or official LineageOS.
That guide won't help if the "virus" is baked into the ROM.
I hate dirt...
Sorry, but if it's really important, just txt me, email me, or heck, write me a letter if you have to. Any organisation that I'm concerned about or vice versa should have all my details anyways. If I get a unexpected anonymous call, I'm dropping it, I don't care who it is, it's getting dropped and it won't even go to voicemail and I won't even think twice about.
Reckon it's still worth getting? How are they with their monthly patches?
**boot**  contains the kernel - do NOT flash this from stock image as LineageOS uses a custom kernel and you'll likely run into issues even if it does boot. 

**booloader** is *generally* updated only once per major Android release and is not included in Google's monthly patches, unless there were some vulnerabilities found in it. The bootloader is independent of the ROM so it's safe to update this, but not necessary (only compulsory for major Android updates). 

**radio** is *generally* updated only once per major Android release and is not included in Google's monthly patches, unless there were some vulnerabilities found in it. The radio is independent of the ROM so it's safe to update this, but not necessary (only compulsory for major Android updates).

**vendor** contains all the main third-party, closed source firmware blobs (camera drivers, sensor drivers etc), and is updated frequently - and it's quite important that you keep this up-to-date with the latest stock vendor image from Google. Unfortunately LineageOS isn't able to automatically update this as this is closed-source / proprietary.
We're talking about Reddit though, not Facebook. Any privacy conscious person wouldn't be using Facebook in the first place in this scenario.
This wasn't a regular update though, it was an in-place upgrade to a new edition, which involved backing up user data, wiping the drive, deploying the new wim to the devices and restoring the data (all this is fully automated). We even ran the whole process past Microsoft and they okayed it and said we should have any issues... Oh how wrong they were.

How's the graphics and gameplay? Reckon it's worth checking out?
We have about 5000 machines, upgrade to the latest "edition" of Windows 10 was a huge clusterfuck. My own device spent over 2 hours doing the actual upgrade, when it was estimated it'd take less than an hour, and when it did finish the upgrade it was semi-built, with settings only partially migrated, drives not mapping, missing user data etc. Good thing I did a full manual backup beforehand.

Ironically, we had very few issues upgrading from 7 to 10.

Now hold on a second there pal
I just used Magisk as an example. There was always SuperSU and before that Superuser by ChainsDD. And before TWRP there was CWM. The process of rooting or loading a custom ROM hasn't really changed much. The only exception was for some devices with locked bootloaders, you had to rely on exploits to gain root access and then load a custom recovery or a rooted kernel. And even that process really hasn't changed much, except it's becoming increasingly difficult to find exploited for devices these days.
Does it matter? Both involve unlocking the bootloader and flashing a custom recovery. Once you've done that, it doesn't matter if you flash Magisk.zip or LineageOS.zip, it's the same process. You need to do your homework either way. Only you are to blame if you research thoroughly and don't have the patience to go to great lengths to revive your device.
What's that go to do with anything? When did I even mention rooting?
Yep, Magisk doesn't help here unfortunately.
So the opposite of VoLTE - LTEoV?
It used to be, but not any longer. Genuine hard bricks back in the day were caused due to bugs in eMMC hardware, the Galaxy S2 and S3 were notorious for this.

These days its next to impossible to permanently hard brick a device via the usual flashing means, unless you deliberately go out of your way and try to access the device at a low level to screw it up.
Also, fun fact: both are retrievers. The proper name for labs is Labrador Retriever, although hardly anyone calls them that these days.

No, but once Knox is tripped you permanent lose out on some Samsung features which you can never get back, even if you go back to full stock and relock the bootloader. This can reduce the resale value of your phone (I had to sell my Note 8 at a significant loss because the eFuse was tripped).
In addition to what the other guy wrote, bear in mind that you'll *permanently* lose some Samsung features as soon as you unlock the bootloader. These features are the Knox-dependent features, such as Samsung Pay, Secure Folder, Secret Mode in the Samsung browser and any other apps which check the eFuse, such as some banking or enterprise apps.

So unless you use any of the above I wouldn't recommend even unlocking the bootloader, let alone loading a ROM.
> without compromise

No. There's *always* some compromises with rooting or ROMs. For Samsung devices, once you ~~root~~ unlock the bootloader, you *permanently* trip the KNOX eFuse, so you permanently lose out on some Samsung features, which can greatly reduce the resale value of your device. You don't get these features back even if you restore to full stock and and relock the bootloader. I lost a couple of hundred when I sold my Note 8 because of the eFuse. 

I believe there's also some loss of camera functionality since you can't run the stock Samsung camera app. You can run the ported Pixel camera app but I'm not sure at the moment what it's limitations are on an AOSP Treble ROM on Exynos hardware. I would guess that for a start, features dependent on the ISP/DSPs used in Qualcomm SoCs will not work, maybe this might affect HDR+? I dunno.

Also with custom ROMs there's always the issue of OTA updates, sometimes it'll require manual intervention, also, you'd need to manually update the low-level firmware if you're serious about security and bug fixes. 

Also, we don't know yet how this affects the 7-day jail period enforced on some variants, so overall, I'd wait a couple of months before making any purchase decisions.
I wouldn't recommend SuperSU, check out Magisk instead it's way better and also has the added advantage of hiding root from apps (allowing you to use Android Pay, Netflix, Snapchat etc).
No. Especially if you're not hugely into custom ROMs etc.
Same here. This was one of the reasons why I sold my Note 8.
Yes, but it requires support from banks. You can't just use it with any random card, your bank needs to support it. Here in New Zealand for example, Samsung Pay is useless.. along with majority of the countries in the world. Samsung Pay is supported only on a dozen or so countries.
It's unwanted bloat. Increases app size, RAM requirements, makes it laggier etc. And it's something I've never seen anyone actually ask for it... especially considering that all the apps that you'd use this on already have stickers built-in (eg Messenger, WhatsApp, Allo), so I don't see the point of adding it into the keyboard.
How about making a "Lite" or "Go" version of SwiftKey, as is the trend with other popular apps? Low end Android devices are becoming first class Android citizens now (with Android Go coming into the picture). I'm sure a lot of people would appreciate (myself included) a Lite/Go version of SwiftKey without all the stickers and additional themes (just have a fixed light/dark theme).
SwiftKey wasn't made by Microsoft though, so I wouldn't say it's "from Microsoft". Microsoft merely bought the company and kept the team as is. They don't deserve any credit, except for keeping the team intact I guess.
If you wipe the system partition and try to boot the device, then you could get potentially locked out on some devices/scenarios (eg say you don't have the recovery flashed permanently or you wipe that partition as well), then you'll be left with an unusable device - until you get to a PC that is. But you wouldn't be attempting all this without having access to a PC anyways in the first place so it's kind of a moot point.
Thanks! I've made a few more edits after your edit, so do check them out. Also, please let me know if you need a hand in rewording some of the definitions or if you want to add anything further. I've been in phone modding community for over a decade and I see a lot of misconceptions and incorrect terminology used, so I'm happy that someone's taken the initiative to make a newbie-friendly glossary. :)
Yep, it you never leave the city it's fine. Personally I like to travel, and not having Band 28 was a bit of a deal breaker for me (which is one of the reasons why I sold my OnePlus 3 early).
You mentioned custom ROM, but didn't explain what a **ROM** is in the first place (in the Android context). For those not in the know-how this can be confusing.

In the same vein, you should also explain what **firmware** is, and how it can refer to both the ROM as well as low-level firmware (modem/baseband etc). Might also want to add that it's important to keep your firmware manually updated when using a custom ROM, since most ROMs do not include (low-level) firmware updates.  Might also want to explain **modem/baseband** (probably link this to RIL). 

**Recovery** : you said that this is a partition, but you should clarify that this also refers to the software that runs off this partition - they're not the same. Your current definition is confusing and slightly incorrect. If I were to define this, it'll be along these lines:

*"A recovery is a minimal, special-purpose OS that lives independent of the main OS. It's primary functions include applying firmware updates, formatting partitions and other OS maintenance/recovery tasks. On most devices, the recovery lives in a dedicated recovery partition, but on newer devices (like the Pixels) the recovery is part of the boot partition"*

On that note, you should also explain **A/B slot** system, since it's usually the A/B devices which have the recovery integrated in boot. (see edit below) 

**Treble** is NOT a new partition system, but a framework to separate the low-level hardware-specific code from the high-level OS code, by providing a standardised vendor interface. *"A device with it can boot a Android 8+ image with no modifications"* - this is unclear and misleading, I would drop that completely as it's a bit more complicated than that. Instead say that a device with Treble support makes it easier for OEMs to push out new Android releases, as they no longer dependent on third-party silicon vendors to provide updated firmware. This also makes it easy for the custom ROM community to port a generic Android 8+ system image with a fully functional camera, fingerprint scanner, sensors etc. 

Note that some devices have a separate /vendor partition or an A/B partition system, but that has nothing to do with Treble.

**Clean flash** and **dirty flash**: you should clarify that clean flash refers to flashing after wiping the **data** and **cache** partitions as a minimum, but it's also recommended to wipe the **system** partition. In case of a dirty flash, no partition (or only the cache partition) is wiped.

**Magisk**'s definition can be improved, particularly where you said "systemlessly". **Systemless** is a new concept that a lot of people aren't familiar with so perhaps add a separate section to explain what it is and why it's important to maintain a systemless state. You also said "repo" but most normal users don't know what this means, so you should expand this to "repository". FOSS is also something ordinary users aren't familiar with, maybe have a separate section explaining what FOSS is. 

**SafetyNet**'s purpose is NOT to protect apps from vulnerabilities - but rather to provide a means for apps/developers to check whether a device is rooted or has its core system components modified in a way that deviates from standard. For example, simply unlocking the bootloader causes SafteyNet to fail - you don't even need to root your device.

**SuperSU**: might want to also add that the root community no longer recommends SuperSU and is instead recommend that the users use alternative root options such as Magisk, phh-su, LineageOS-su. Might also want to explain phh-su and LineageOS-su. On the same note, should also add a **KingRoot/KingoRoot** section and indicate that this is definitely NOT recommend by the community as it's known to include adware/malware and users should avoid it at all costs.

**Root**: Can be reworded to: *Access to the root folder of a device and other core parts of an operating system, which is generally restricted or inaccessible. The process of "rooting" a device is fairly complex, but the core aspect involves sideloading a root application (also referred to as superuser or su) which grants root privileges to apps that request it. Rooting enables many useful operations to be performed that are otherwise unavailable on a regular device, however it comes with drawbacks such as potential loss of functionality, voiding the warranty on some devices and breaking OTA updates*. 

**TWRP**: TeamWin Recovery Project, a custom recovery that allows for more advanced options than the default recovery. It's primary advantage is the ability to flash custom ROMs and mods, which typically isn't allowed by the default recovery.

----

Additions:

**eFuse**: An electronic fuse implemented on some devices (typically Samsung), which indicates whether or not a device has been digitally tampered with. Typically, rooting or unlocking the bootloader blows the eFuse. Once the eFuse is blown its generally not possible to restore it to its original stage, even if all modifications are removed and the device is restored to the stock ROM. On Samsung devices, a blown eFuse leads to loss of several features such as Samsung Pay, Secure Folder, Private Browsing in the Samsung browser and failure to load some banking or enterprise apps which check for the eFuse state.

**A/B slot**: A new partitioning system which consists of two sets of partitions (typically two sets of boot, system and vendor partitions). These two sets are referred to as the a/b slots, and it's purpose is to deliver **seamless updates** - a process where the OS applies an OTA update to the second (passive) slot while the device is still in use, without interrupting the user. After a reboot, the system then boots from the passive slot (making it active) and thereby reduces the downtime of an OS upgrade to just a few seconds.  This system is currently used by Pixel and Android One devices.
> How many bricked phones do you have   

Zero

> and how did it happen?   

Because I do my homework before ~~rooting~~ messing around with a device and I'm willing to go to great lengths to unbrick phones (using QDLoader mode and QFIL, or a Medusa box for eg).

*Edit: Edited for clarity - rooting, ROMming, modding.. all have similar processes and carry similar risks.*

Which version exactly? Both 0.11.6 and 0.12.0 work fine for me on my Nexus 6P Oreo.
He said it was $1200AUD in Australia, which works out to $926 USD. Not worth it. But for $650 I agree, it's definitely worth it. Unfortunately Pixel's aren't really worth it outside of the US, unlike the Nexus line which was not only globally available but also globally affordable.
Most Xiaomi's don't have Band 28. I wouldn't recommend them if I were you.
If you've never done this sort of stuff, I wouldn't recommend it - especially if you don't have the patience and technical skills. Imagine when you've followed all instructions yet suddenly your very expensive phone turns into a very expensive brick. That said, it's very difficult to *permanently* brick modern phones, but it all requires a lot of reading, a lot of sifting thru tons of irrelevant stuff, stuff that may be valid for some models but not your particular variant (and Samsung likes to make several dozens of variants of the same model).

That, and with the current decent quality of the stock Samsung ROM means AOSP is not worth it at all for the average user - especially when you stand to actually *lose* features and permanently tripping the KNOX eFuse.
It was never really meant for those purchasing Samsung phones for their software. But for people like me, who don't use any of the Samsung features.. who love Samsung for the hardware but not the software.. Treble is a godsend. It's what we've been waiting for *years*. Can't believe it's finally here.
Nexus 6P. What do you mean it's "normal" on your phone? Can you post a screenshot?
Same issue with the [official Reddit app](https://i.imgur.com/NWS0n8L.png) as well. It's definitely vertically filmed but incorrectly oriented.
Sync for Reddit. Don't have issues with any other gifs/videos.
It's not the vertical film that's the problem, it's that it's a vertical film that's recorded horizontally so it forces you to rotate your phone but still doesn't fill up the display. I have no clue how OP even managed that, if it was by accident.

It's all done mate. Check out this app called OpenSignal, they've mapped out all cell towers and signal strengths etc (all crowdsourced of course). Also check out https://opencellid.org. Location triangulation using cell towers is also done and there are many open-source projects around it, just search F-Droid for NLP or lookup Mozilla Location Provider or https://radiocells.org/geolocation

I've only worked in IT, but the WiFi at all the companies I've worked for have been crappy - and these aren't some small time companies mind you. In my case though it's not that that signal is bad, but it's always so saturated that it's stuff like automatic updates are best turned off. I end up just using mobile data because it's so much more faster/reliable.
Thank you - that's really nice of you. I might take you up on that offer. :)
Pretty much. I do this for my work network as well (why are all work networks crappy?) Doesn't affect streaming and I still get push notifications just fine. :)

Ah wait, are you trying to access it externally? If so you'll need to enable port forwarding on your router (for port 21) and use your connection's external IP address.
All good. Glad I could help!
You can just set your work network as "metered", that way it won't auto-update your apps on it.

Go to Settings - Network & Internet - Data Usage - Network Restrictions (under WiFi) and tap your network and select "Metered".

Edit: [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Yi9P8YV.jpg)
That's probably from a cache file. I'd recommend excluding the "Android" and "data" folders, and also anything begins with a period ("."), as these are hidden files/folders which is just app/temporary data.

Edit: Saw that you're on an LG phone. LGs have a built-in backup feature, you should use that as well, it's under Settings - General - Backup & Reset
I wouldn't recommend ES Explorer any more, it's loaded with adware/bloatware and has been a dodgy app ever since it was sold off to its current dodgy company.

Anyways check out Solid Explorer - I use it as well to access the FTP server on my router (ASUS) with no issues. Solid Explorer is also an overall excellent file manager so it's worth getting.
I use the plugin [Ultimate Rotation Control](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.fameit.rotate), and it works fine with Tasker. In fact you don't even need Tasker, you can just use the app standalone and choose the "forced auto" mode, that way your screen will forcefully stay in your physical orientation and will not allow other apps to override it. It works fine on my Oreo on Nexus 6P, but I can't say if it'll work on the S9 or not. Worth a try though.
If you're using Magisk then you don't have to manually flash the zip each time. Magisk is automatically flashed with OTA updates. So as long as you deselect the option to encrypt in Magisk Manager you don't need to do any extra manual steps.

Well, the real question to ask is, why not?

But out of all the clients, I prefer Sync because of its UI - it's so sleek and lightweight and I love the default font selection - making the whole UI compact, doesn't waste too much space with no unnecessary UI decorations. Just the right amount of whitespace, IMHO.

Plus there are a ton of nifty features which Sync came up with first (which have now probably been copied by the other clients), such as the one-tap access to ASCII emoticons (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞. The dev is awesome and responds to feature requests and issue personally.
And reap that sweet karma!
Checkout BxActions and AdHell2. BxActions can remap the Bixby button to do something useful (I used mine to activate the torch on long-press). With AdHell2 you can completely get rid of Bixby so it's no longer running hidden in the background and you can never ever accidentally open it.

I liked it but the Samsung ROM was getting a bit too annoying for my liking so I sold it off after a few months. I hope that the S9 has proper Treble support and someone's able to port a fully functional AOSP ROM with decent camera support.
Is that the place on Ghuznee St?
Because of all the funny cat gifs.
So here's the thing...
Actually, you can. The newest Magisk beta works fine on Android P. Regardless, Android P is the future and it's coming in a few months and the Substratum team haven't found any workarounds yet - even with root. Substratum is doomed either way, no point investing any further time into it (if you're a stock ROM user).
Why would it take days to set it up? What sort of customisations do you intend to do?
Sync master race
Not if you're on Android P.
Also, Substratum no longer works with Android P. It's future is now uncertain, at least as far as stock ROMs are concerned.
That's irrelevant. The point is, it has nothing to do with Android - if they set it up on an iPhone they'd be giving the same access of their iPhone to their school. As I said, it's an MDM thing, nothing to do with Android.
Everybody was kung-fu fighting
It's not an Android thing, it's an MDM thing that applies to iOS as well.

Yes, because it doesn't modify any system components. This is essentially a sandbox environment that doesn't affect your regular apps or the system. Think of it like installing Xposed under [Parallel Space](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lbe.parallel.intl) or [Island](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oasisfeng.island).
Xposed without root exists - it's just normal Xposed. Contrary to popular belief, Xposed doesn't require root, just an unlocked bootloader. It's a completely different matter though that most people who have an unlocked bootloader typically also have root, or that some Xposed modules may require root.
Or is this just fantasy?

Are you a sabretooth?
Sorry, but this is pretty naive. I know you mean well but:

- 10 year old SoCs are practically worthless. Well, it's not the SoCs themselves but the fact that SoCs are tied down to their hardware is what makes it worthless. SoC like say, the Snapdragons are used primarily in phones. So any phone that's 10 years old is useless now. Consider the first Android phone, released 10 years ago - the HTC G1 with a 528MHz CPU and 192MB RAM. I mean, what's the point of that? If what you're after is open hardware then you could buy a open dev board with much better specs and for probably cheaper (like the Raspberry Pi) and with better overall support. Alternatively if you're specially after a phone form-factor you could just get the Librem Pureism 5 or say the Fair Phone 2 etc. Basically there's no point to in wasting efforts on such an old SoC.

- As to what's in it for the copyright holder? It literally means nothing to them. The dev community is a very minor audience for them as it is, and the sub-community that wants the code for an old SoC is such a small minority that I'll actually *cost* them money to release the code. It's not free advertisement. That money would be better spent making actual ads or viral advertising. Trying to please some 0.0000000001% of your audience is pointless.

- Don't forget that most companies aren't at a liberty to just hand over the entire code to their proprietary work. Qualcomm may make the SoC but they may be licensing some of the designs/tech/code for certain components or modules from other companies - which would be governed by several contracts, NDAs, patents, copyrights etc. So any code release will need to be sanitised first and then okayed by their legal department and guess what, legal will have better things to do. As I said above, time is money, so going thru all this effort just to satisfy a bunch of nerds is going to cost them money for zero gain. 

- I mean, think about it. Say if Qualcomm released the entire codes for the MSM7201A used in the G1, what's in it for them? They're the market leaders already, you think that's going to give them any additional customers? They won't get absolutely anything out of it. Zero, zilch, zip, nada, nothing. In fact, they stand to *lose* a lot of intellectual property as you know who would be the ones to lap up any code releases? Their competitors, that's who.

- Also, petitions don't mean jack. Seriously, when was the last time an online petition made any impact against a market leader like Qualcomm? These companies don't even listen to their main user base, good luck trying to get their attention for something that's utterly trivial. You'd probably have better luck at winning the lottery...

- Kickstarters won't get you anywhere either. This isn't something money can solve. You can't buy everything with money. Heck, even Broadcomm, with their billions of dollars, is unable to tempt Qualcomm. A Kickstarter is insignificant.
Yay! Glad you got your camera back. :)

It's not yet jersey time for me but walks to work are certainly becoming a lot more pleasant! Really looking forward to winter (yes, I know I'm weird).
It was only supposed to be temporary, the 6P was my backup/dev phone. I couldn't stand the Note 8 any longer (well it was Samsung ROM really that I couldn't stand, had various issues), so I sold it off and wanted to buy a OP5T, but then I decided to wait for a Treble device since its 2018. I might get the S9 if someone's able to port a fully functional AOSP ROM to it, so just waiting to see how it plays out.
Let me know when that ratio changes to 49/51, I could be the one who brings balance to the workforce.
I'm still rocking the 6P, no issues whatsoever. I just hope it lasts long enough so that I can upgrade to a decent Treble phone.
> I was in a phone shop yesterday where I got to test out Galaxy S9. I have nothing against Samsung but it still stutters!

Yeah, I experienced the same with my Note 8 as well, and this was coming from a OP3 running LineageOS.
Yes but this is 2018. No excuse for an expensive flagship device not to carry 6GB RAM, especially when small-time companies like OnePlus have been doing it for two years now.
I liked the game the way it was - even with the original gym system - but stopped because of all the cheaters using third-party scanner apps, GPS spoofers and bots etc. Even people I knew IRL were cheating openly, and that killed the game for me. Everyone had dozens of variants of all the high level mons with high IVs, I just couldn't keep up anymore. I mean at first it didn't bother me, but then raids happened and I saw IRL people bragging about their unfairly obtained mons, talking openly about using multiple accounts, being banned etc.. That was the first and last raid I attended.

Now I'm back to Ingress and hope to get to level 16 before Niantic screws up the game with Ingress 2.0...
You can disable it using AdHell2
Not really, since I unlocked the bootloader and the eFuse got tripped, I sold it at a significant loss. But I was glad to get rid of it though, couldn't stand the Samsung ROM any longer. Glad to be back on LineageOS on my 6P.
Nah. PX2 has only 4GB RAM and no headphone jack.
[CopperheadOS](https://copperhead.co/android/) resell Pixel phones with their OS instead of Google's. Although it's very highly privacy and security oriented, it's will not suit everyone, as it doesn't come with the Play Store (although you can side-load it later on, but that would kinda defeat the purpose if you're looking for a Google-free experience).
Ah, that should be fine I think. I have a 2nd gen Echo but plan to get an extra Dot so I can use it in the bathroom with my water resistant UE BOOM speakers to listen to music. I don't really need follow-up mode, but I wonder if I can switch over the tunes to my bedroom Echo once I'm out of the shower...

Over 80% of faults our helpdesk receives are printer related. You don't realise how much printers suck when you look at the all the open tickets and it's all pretty much "printer jamming". And these are all modern printers mind you, massive MFPs that costs several thousands of dollars and yet they still constantly jam, still have the same issues of paper getting skewed, scanner belt breaking, not detecting paper sizes, not detecting toners, not auto ordering consumables.. it's most definitely a scam but somehow no one does anything about it.

I was gonna get a OP5T but decided to wait for Treble. So went back to my 6P.as I already sold the N8.
Except, online petitions rarely work. When was the last time that a major corporation like Google actually listened to a petition and took positive action?

This whole thing is a waste of time, our efforts are better spent spamming companies like Nokia to make their bootloaders unlockable, so that we can do whatever the hell we want with the devices we own.
And *this* is exactly why root/Xposed/custom ROMs are still so valuable - you just can't rely on Google any more, they're becoming more and more like Apple by locking down Android and taking away features with every new release.

I'm still pissed that with Oreo I can no longer change a notification's priority so that it just hides the icon from the status bar. :(

I started on Sojourner ever since they introduced the badge, but I broke my streak accidentally about 4 months later and didn't even realise it until like two months later. That shattered me and I gave up on the badge, also because some weekends I just can't be bothered going outside.

Then I moved homes last year and one of my main criteria for the new place was for it to be in the range of a portal. My friends thought I was crazy, but hey, I haven't broken my Sojourner streak since then. :)
> i would love to play ingress but i have not the memory on the phone


Really? Ingress is only 50MB in size. How could you not have 50MB on your phone? Just delete something that you don't need. Also, if you don't even have 50MB free then your phone would perform very slowly - it's recommend to have at least 10% free storage space on any device otherwise there might be significant performance impact.
I could never get it to change the color of the lights regardless. Did it ever work for you? I'm using a Philips Hue gen1, and Alexa just uses the last color.

Yep, only the music, no movie.
It was epic indeed! I loved that they played the iconic 20th Century Fox intro - I probably heard it a thousand times, but hearing it live was just so magical. 

I felt bad though for getting lost into the movie at times, only to suddenly realise that there was a live orchestra playing the background score, then I'd focus on the orchestra for a bit but get drawn back into the movie. But I guess that was the intended effect. :)

I think it's a good start. 6023 is the post code on the receipt and it matches the registered address of the company, so it's likely the company OP is after. I can't find any other taxi companies in that area (Berhampore), the nearest one being Combined Taxis in Newtown (which is 6021).

Tbf the OP2 has been DOA since day one - I mean, no NFC, seriously? What's even the point of the device? OP2 is like the unwanted child that no one cares about, not even OnePlus.

Thankful this is not an issue with the OP1, OP3/3T and OP5/5T - LineageOS has been super stable on these, regularly updated, well supported by the community and widely regarded as being better than stock - so much so that it's "worth it". Especially with features like Privacy Guard making LineageOS a much more desirable than the stock ROM which has been mired in controversy with privacy leaks and bugs like the Alert Slider one which OnePlus have acknowledged but still refuse to fix years later...

noahajac has a nice detailed reply that he usually posts for Samsung devices, so I won't go into detail here.

But to give you a rough idea or starting point, the process for most Samsung phones goes like this:

1. Make a backup of **everything** and download a copy of the stock ROM for your device to keep it handy in case something goes wrong 
2. Unlock the bootloader by clicking "OEM Unlock" from the Developer options under Settings. 
3. Flash TWRP Recovery for your device using Odin on your PC
4. Reboot into TWRP recovery
5. Copy the Magisk zip to your internal storage using your PC 
6. Click on Install button in TWRP, select the Magisk zip and flash it. 
7. Reboot TWRP and if you get a prompt: make sure you do NOT install the TWRP app, as that will ruin your SafteyNet and future OTA updates

Edit: I've no experience with a Galaxy Core Prime, so not sure if the above will be even achievable on your device as there are a lot of other variables involved (such as whether your device in particular is unlockable or not - not all phones have an unlockable bootloader).

Sorry this isn't as detailed as you might have hoped, but noahajac will surely come along and present his masterpiece of a reply. :)

Edit 2: If you do decide to follow the above, please keep in mind:

 - "Galaxy Core Prime" is very vague. Samsung makes a gazillion variants of every phone, so you need to be *very* specific when looking up information or downloads - you need to look for your exact model number. Eg there are different versions of TWRP recoveries for different Core Primes, so you need to get the one that's specific to your model.

- Do not trust random websites on Google. The only websites I'd recommend are xda forums and Reddit for information, twrp.me for the recovery, and Sammobile.com or updato.com for your stock ROM and Odin. Avoid random blogs like the plague, they're the worst.

Edit 3: If you do decide to root, bear in mind that you won't be able to automatically install OTA updates any longer. You can still download them, but if you want to install them you need to go back to your stock recovery by flashing it from Odin, OR, if you've got the Flashfire app installed, you can try flashing your OTA update via it (it works even if you've got TWRP). But Flashfire hasn't been tested on every device so use it with caution. Either way, you need to be prepare and comfortable to restore to stock in case things go wrong, so always keep your backups handy.

Edit 4: Please note that I won't be able to give any further detailed answers - if you want to look up the details, you should be able to Google them. (eg: Google "how to enable developer mode" or Google "how go flash TWRP using Odin" or Google "How to install USB drivers for Galaxy Core Prime for Odin"). Etc. Hopefully these should be enough tips to get you started. Or you could wait for noahajac's awesome reply. :)
As mentioned in the other thread, I would like to build a high-end phone. If it's not high end then there's just no point, for me at least. Let me elaborate, since you were quite vague in the other thread. I'm a *very heavy* multitasker. I use my phone like a PC, have several dozens of scripts running in the background for automation, I use Termux to provide a full GNU/Linux toolset with vim and a full dev stack for editing and building code on the go. I even have a local copy of Arch installed in a chroot environment if I want to use a full fledged DE. I've got global gesture controls set  up so if I swipe down the edge a terminal drops down, just like Guake on the desktop - except - all this is on my phone.

As a developer and power user, I would naturally *love* to take the control over my phone to the next level - but not at the expense of losing functionality.

So therefore, I'm sorry but I'm not in the least bit interested in your board. If I wanted a low-end customisable hardware, I can easily build one myself using a Raspberry Pi or similar (and I already use a bunch of Pis for home automation, they're awesome).
> We need skeumorphism back

No we don't. Just because *you* have a certain preference doesn't mean everyone needs to change their preference.

It's just a design trend. It's just currently in fashion, and like everything else, it too will pass.

> I hate it and miss all the colors and affects old programs had, and in some ways, they were easier to use because of it.

That is fair enough, I mean it's your choice. Thankfully there are some solutions, eg system themes (Substratum) and third-party icon packs which can help change things to the way you like.

> Look at Reddit, it is flat and has almost no colors. 

Are you talking about the website or Android app? If so, the website itself is irrelevant to this sub, which is  r/Android. If you're talking about the Reddit app, pretty much everyone agrees that it's trash. Regardless, Reddit it a poor example. 

> Cannot wrap my head around why people like this so much.

Again, it's a trend/fad, sometimes you can't really explain why people like something. Why do some people like Death Metal? Why do people like Taylor Swift? Some things in life are just a mystery.
I wonder if they also use Arch Linux.

It's a work in progress, but having played both I definitely enjoyed Star Citizen more - it's just so much more immersive, and I love how they pay attention to all the minor details. It's more of a space life simulator than anything, where you can spend your time doing mundane jobs or just go around enjoying the scenery.
Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.

Why this over Star Citizen?
You mean the module or apk? The module was just a one-click install for me.
This is exciting! I hope Tasker eventually becomes more like Automate or Macrodroid and has all the AutoApps functionality integrated so you don't need to install a dozen different apps to do something useful.
Swift?
A high-end phone with a QWERTY slide-out keyboard, maybe make it modular so that I can swap the keyboard out for extra battery or a gamepad like the one on the Xperia Play.
There's dozens of us! Dozens!

I never take selfies, and I always use fingerprint or pin to unlock my phone do I don't need face unlock either. So no, I don't need a front camera. Of course, I realise I'm in the minority, so companies will never make a phone without a front cameras...

I disagree. Of course, unless you don't have root/ Magisk already, I find the Magiskified version a lot better. For one, I don't have to hunt around for the apks, also Magisk automatically manages updates for them so I don't have to worry about keeping it up-to-date.

Funny you should bring up Croissant. After I watched that episode of Star Trek TNG, I started pronouncing Croissant the "proper" way, except, no one else understood me. They'd just look at me all confused not sure what I was talking about. So I resigned and went back to pronouncing it the western way....

It's the same with German words/brands too, like Porsche and Volkswagen - people look at me all funny when I pronounce them correctly.

Actually, it isn't. They said that there were looking into making phones unlockable in the future but never actually confirmed anything. Recent user reports confirm that all Nokia phones are still locked. 

If root/unlockable bootloader is important to you then you should avoid this phone.
And no headphone jack. :(

Yeah, in Samsung browser. It checks your eFuse for whatever reason, so you can't open an incognito window if your eFuse has tripped. Doesn't affect Chrome though.
"Kernel, you better take a look at this".

"What is it son?"

"I dunno, but it looks like a giant..."
Yeah, I'm in a bind at the moment which is why I'm still holding on to my 6P. Waiting for a  *proper* Treble device without any eFuse or 7-day-jail nonsense.
Used to be, but apparently not any more. Hiren used to contain a lot of cracked/patched apps, like Acronis and Norton Backup etc. Basically lots of copyrighted/illegally licences apps (aka warez). I'm surprised someone's actually using them in a corporate environment, imagine deploying tools made by Razor1911 or aXXo in a workplace.... basically Hiren's is synonymous with warez even if the current version of the boot cd doesn't have any warez. Regardless, when used in a corporate it does bring in a licensing issues, as a lot of those tools are free for personal use but not corporate.
Me neither, but it did reduce the resale value. I lost a couple of hundred dollars because of this.
People like you and me don't care about Samsung features, but ordinary people do.. infact they buy Samsung *because* of those features, it's not bloat to them.

Of course, I was truthful and did explicitly state what the drawbacks were of buying such a device, but I suppose if you're sneaky and don't mention anything you could get away with it. Personally I don't like having do deal with buyers after the sales done so I try to be as explicit/verbose as possible so they know exactly what they're getting into.
Yep that's right, and that's because the S4 and devices back in those days didn't support reporting the bootloader lock status. I believe this issue only affects devices made in the past 3 years.
Yes. The very fact that the bootloader is unlocked will trip SafteyNet. A patched kernel or Magisk hides this, so the SafteyNet check passes and Android Pay etc will work.
Used to, back in the day. But apparently not more. Still, I would avoid it. Would you trust deploying something made by say, Razor1911 or aXXo or other infamous underground group in your organisation, even if it was legal?
Hiren's is illegal though. Hard to believe you would basically deploy warez in a production environment.
Ah. Regardless, I wouldn't trust someone who used to distribute warez so freely. Hiren to me is synonymous with warez.
Yes and no. You'll need to flash a SafteyNet patched kernel, or install Magisk.
r/AndroidQuestions
Yeah but the amount of power used by other components, such as the display, is way more than the power used by the SoC, so in comparison the savings isn't that much. Don't forget the additional software/services that are running, like all the new camera features, animojis etc. However if you compare the screenoff time (standby time) though it would be a lot better (especially due to Oreo's new background limits).
You could potentially work around that using Magisk which tries to emulate that eFuse is set to 0x0.. although I haven't tested it if this fools Samsung Pay and the like. Also unsure if this works with the new Oreo ROM on the S9.

Regardless, this does reduce the resale value of the phone (as I found out the hard way), because when you reset the phone & restore the stock ROM, Magisk is gone and these features will no longer be available to the new recipient.
Anything that depends on the KNOX eFuse, so this includes:

 - Samsung Pay
 - Secure Folder
 - Private Browsing
 - Any other third-party apps that look at the eFuse to check for tampering, eg banking apps.

This is going by my experience with the Note 8. As Samsung adds more KNOX-related features and touts KNOX to more enterprises and companies, the above list is only going to grow.
Us as in the general public, then I agree. Us as in /r/Android or Nexus users? I disagree.
So other than the Gapps, there are optimisations like

 - Simplification of animations (not sure if they're completely eliminated or just cutdown frames)
 - new 2D recents menu (no overlapping card view, only 4 apps visible)
 - More controls for data usage / data limits
 - ART optimisations (smaller DEX files)
 - Minimum RAM requirement is now only 512MB
 - Kernel optimisations
 - More aggressive OOM killer (out-of-memory killer)
Yes but the Nexus line was aimed at Android enthusiasts / the dev community, so really a Nokia isn't a suitable replacement, unless if the only reason you bought the Nexus was because it ran stock Android.
But you lose some Samsung features - permanently and irreversibly.
It won't lead to fragmentation as Android Go is fully compatible with regular Android apps. From a developer's perspective Android Go is no different to regular Android - it's just Android Oreo.

Go just has additional optimizations applied, such as replacing regular GApps with cut-down "lite" versions. This isn't just some tweaks though, some of these apps have been built from ground up - and they're missing some features from regular Android - so it wouldn't be suitable to include in regular Android that ships with most devices.

Basically think of it as another OEM "skin", except this skin is made by Google, is actually fast and cuts down a lot of bloat from Google's own ROM. It's an extreme lite version of Android which is purpose built for low-end hardware.

As for why it exists? There's a **huge** market for sub-$100 devices - a market which is currently dominated by cheap Chinese devices with ugly skins, bloatware and more importantly - these devices are often neglected and receive no security updates. Unfortunately these devices give Android a bad name, especially considering that many first-time smartphone users who know little about Android go for these. They buy one of these crappy devices and then complain "lol Android sucks, my next phone will be an iPhone". Just see r/androidquestions, so many people using crappy LG devices with a measly 1GB RAM or some random no-name device and complaining about it. Android Go targets all these, because guess what, even sub-$100 devices deserve some love. Afterall, Android is all about inclusion, and Go is a right step in that direction to further the goal.
Same here. I really should start cooking early morning...
None, because none of the Nokias have an unlockable bootloader or  a developer community.
Same here - heck, my current carrier's 4.5G speed is faster than what I get on fibre, sadly data caps are abysmally low.. (well we have an "unlimited" plan but that throttles the speed after 22GB, so not really unlimited. Also, can't tether on that plan. :/)
If you're referring to chntpw, you can download it and add it to your own bootable USB - http://www.chntpw.com/download/

There's no need to rely on dodgy stuff, especially in a professional environment.
I'm not sure if it still is, but back in the day when boot CDs were all the rage, Hiren used to include a number of cracked apps like ones from Acronis and Norton to name a few. Regardless of its current state, I wouldn't use it in an organisation - doesn't seem very professional.
Anyone know if the bootloader unlockable on this one?
Lol well I was planning to get a OP5/5T and use my 6P in the interim but I've decided to wait for a Treble device. Most likely the S9.
Hulu?
It's hard to say, it's really up to the maintainers. Basically you'll need to find a dev who's interested in building and maintaining support for the device. In addition the device/builds will need to meet certain requirements to get official LineageOS support, as listed here: https://github.com/LineageOS/charter/blob/master/device-support-requirements.md

But due to the limited release/availability of the XZP, plus overall general lack of interest, it's unlikely that there would be an official LineageOS soon. Basically the XZP simply isn't a popular enough device.
An A/B device is one with the A/B slot mechanism, ie a device which has two sets of partitions, an active set and a passive set. This is used for the new Seamless Update feature which was introduced with Nougat - this allows an OS upgrade to be installed with virtually no downtime (just a simple reboot is required), as the upgrade occurs on the passive partition while you're still actively using the device. 

At the moment very few devices have this partition setup, although it is expected to become more common in the future. The ones that I know of currently are the Pixel devices and Android One devices (Xiaomi A1). The XZP isn't an A/B device.
Android Police have an article which they regularly update with devices which have Treble support.
No Treble because it launched with Nougat. Not that it can't be added in, but I haven't heard of any news that they're bringing Treble with the Oreo update.
Unfortunately it a Mediatek. :(
Um, who exactly is hating on the S9? Haven't seen anything negative mentioned here, let alone hate.
The FM radio + large battery make it seem like an ideal choice for an emergency phone.
> Why do phones have to be "exciting"?

Because it leads to stagnation, which slows progress.. which is exactly what's happening right now. People like you are the reason why manufacturers can play it safe and still gain massive profits. Devices are selling simply because of brand name and planned obsolescence. Companies have little incentive to be innovative.

Remember flip phones? Slide-out phones? QWERTY sliders? Xperia Play? 

Phones these days all are just plain black rectangular slabs. No I don't want a triangular phone, but I'd kill for a modern flagship device with a proper QWERTY slider (like the HTC Desire Z had).. but unfortunately these days it's all about removing features.
Funny, it was the other way round for me (Note 8 -> 6P).
The 5 day time is only for countries with official service centres though. There's no way they can keep that promise if they have to ship to Australia or New Zealand for eg.
Other pros include (ROM dependant of course) better privacy, better security, better performance, better battery life, faster updates, much longer support periods and the biggest pro: **being free from the shackles of your manufacturer** - you use the device the way *you* intend to, not how your manufacturer intended. No more relying upon the manufacturer to provide an update. No more being tied down to a particular brand because you're reliant on their software features. No more putting up with ugly skins and other OEM annoyances that are baked into the stock ROM. You have the freedom to pick and choose the features you want, the freedom to build upon a blank slate (AOSP) if you wish.

Possible cons include more complicated update/upgrade process (sometimes they require manual intervention, sometimes you may need to manually hunt around for firmware files); possible loss of useful features (camera quality, Netflix quality); possible *permanent* loss of features on some devices (eg Samsung); warranty may be void.
It's Google's new messaging app.
If that were the case, what's stopping a disgruntled employee from leaking the keys/code? Surely the programming/delivery mechanism itself is secure in some way, because you can't trust third-parties to keep secrets - especially companies that based in China.
I'm disappointed at the lack of Deadpool/Deathstroke.

Wait, so the only way to get the update is to ship your phone to OnePlus? wtf?

Edit: Apparently so.

> Reason being is that due to the security copyright controls baked into streaming services, the update can only be delivered via a physical connection from an authenticated PC.

Two questions arise:

1. Couldn't OnePlus make a PC app which can "authenticate" your PC (whatever that means) and update the phone?

2. Would it be possible for someone to pull the update from such a phone and post it online? I'm guessing this is an update to /vendor or some other hidden partition which can presumably be flashed using QFIL. Unless the update is some sort of DRM keys that is tied to the hardware ID...
I thought you were going to do a bamboozle, but I was pleasantly surprised.
> How's Ska doing on those charts?

I dunno, but I could ska her.
And put it on Reddit.
Agree with everything, except the bit about the camera. Having owned both phones (and gone back to the 6P), I feel the camera on the Note 8 is definitely better. Not that it matters though, most flagship cameras made in the last 2-3 years have been good enough for me.
This is possibly the best analogy that I've seen so far. Very well put.
It's a matter of principle. There's no excuse for a flagship not to have 6GB RAM in 2018, when midrange devices back in 2016 packed that much. If I'm paying flagship prices, I demand flagship specs.
And I'll keep doing it. Downvotes are meant for off-topic comments, not to voice disagreements. I will NOT be silenced by idiots who abuse the voting system.
Battery capacity and RAM are completely different things. I don't see your point. It's 2018, there's no excuse for flagships not to pack 6GB or higher RAM especially when space requirements for additional ram isn't as much as space requirements for 4000mAh battery. 

If you like being cheated from your money, be my guest.
