The camera replacement fee is $80. 

The program covered blurry cameras. 

If you think they are going to extend a program for a 3 almost 4 year old phone, you are bugging. 
All Verizon phones are unlocked. The Verizon versions of the iPhone come with all bands for CDMA and GSM.

Verizon model = perfect for unlocked.
*iMessages cannot be sent to an Android.*

You need to enable SMS. Android can only receive SMS from an iPhone. 
Some people don't use their brains. 
Apple will hold your stuff for 28 days and then it will be deleted. 
Honestly -- the top grade powders for these are the way to go. 

THey don't give the gritty appearance. 
No fear mongering.

Unlock the fucking phone yourself.

People come here and sell blacklisted phones or phones that will be blacklisted due to carrier protections all the time.

You are new. Never bought anything, or sold anything. You want $600 of someone's hard earned money for your phone no one knows the state of.

So you unlock it.
Apparently other people do because they downvoted this thread.
I work at apple too.

You click all in gsx and you can see if the device has been replaced. 

Not just ac+
Yes, they would. 

So why not attach it to your account and let them know it is a fully paid off that was previously used for that amount of time and request an unlock.

Again, Sprint now uses Applecare, and thru can see when a phone has been replaced or even transfer the owed money balance. Apple gave them this access.
No no. 

What I mean is *you* bought it. *You* get Sprint to unlock it. 

Because, you will wipe your hands clean of the matter as soon as someone buys it. 
...?

How about you get it unlocked? 

Sprint phones are the hardest to unlock, and Sprint can see the repair chain if you get it replaced. 
That juicer wants to talk to you
Uh me.

I've got 2 6s+, 1 6s and one 7+ in storage and 2 iPads and a bunch of Androids.

☹️

I need to sell this shit.
While she should get the same consequences, it is up to you to know right from wrong. 

Restrain her, and get away from her ASAP. 

If a man hit me, I'd get the fuck out of there, even if I end up not calling the authorities. My hurt pride is better than a broken jaw and potential jail time. 
I have this issue.

Searching for an app rarely gives me the relevant app.
Sadly, that is where the history of the dwarves stops, and then you being the elfquisition.
I probably didn't...

Acronis is bae. 

So long as you have the back ups and a secure system in place, nothing can hurt you. 

*Protected.*
I just don't trust the ocz drive 😒😒😒😒
Uh.. I don't think so.

I don't like compression, but honestly, it may have been.

I should also mention that the 8TB is in a zfs mirror. Might slow down transfer speeds since it is splitting to two drives.
Honestly, it was 75 GB in 26 minutes. If I was awake to remember. Connection is sata3.

Gigabit cat5e on the source, cat6 on the destination.

The NAS is freenas.

Drive is shucked 8 TB easystore white label WD with the tape trick in a standard PC (freenas) with a 2nd gen Intel i5 and 8gb of RAM with sata3.

For the Samsung, it was 20 mins.

I should mention -- I'm using MBR, not GPT. 😭😭
Honestly... With a gpu on a laptop that is to be expected 

After a year, my T60p with a Lenovo battery (straight outta Lenovo) would only give me 30 mins on the battery when using solid works. :(
Toshiba bought them.. 
"you dumb fuck"

no.
Can be down grades to 8.4.1, but still not with it.
Why were you down voted?

This is true.

iPad mini 1 is worthless. Fixing the screen is $20 and some labor if you do it yourself.

My old co-worker gave me his broken iPad mini, and honestly, even after fixing it, it sits in my drawer... Next to my iPad mini 2... 🤦🏾‍♀️
64gb iPhone 6? $180?
Tbh.. idk
You think a 13 year old being groomed is going to report someone?

Unlikely.

Honestly, if I were you, I'd set the age limit of my app to 18. You cannot allow minors to potentially be exposed to pedophiles or potential sexual grooming that may come along with an app that lets you talk to strangers.

You would probably be in violation of the anti human trafficking law if you don't. 
And how will you determine this? 
What? 

All a kid has to do is hit accept.

And then they'll see a dick. 

Does you TOS ban people under a certain age?
PREACH. 

I love my iPhone, but this is bullshit. 
Who is the carrier? 

Some carriers will let you pay off 50% and pick a new phone on a new installment plan. 
It was covered by AC b/c it was in the second year...
PM me the serial/IMEI.

If the phone clocks up as purchased in an UAE type country, then no facetime for you, my friend!
I noticed after a battery swap, the phones were hilariously hot. 

Idk why. There is a 90 day warranty on the battery part.
Beats gimp pinky lol.
Shouldn't Javik uh look African?
I did.

Can't remove all of the poop.
This is a rule.

I just got hired by the MTA.
Hold on --. I looked at my records: I had a sigmoidoscopy.

That's why I was awake.

Still not fun.
What? 

No. It was a she and she was a doctor. 

I didn't get paid $20 to a random stranger.
Tbh... A good light is $30.

So easy to gel at home.
I'm not used to it.

😥

I didn't like the fact something was going so far up in there. And then water was sprayed to make sure there were no polyps... 
IT WILL GO BACK UP.

USE THE PHONE. DON'T WORRY ABOUT SHIT LIKE THIS. 
Horrible things. 

How dare you put a tube in a child who has autism? Like fr? My colonoscopy was traumatizing as fuck. The water pressure in my tush was not what I was prepared for at fucking all. And the leaking? And the farting afterwards? 

I can't imagine what it would be like to a 5 year old who didn't need it. 
Honestly, my dad has a 6s+ and he loves it. 

:\

Does it do what *you* need it to do? Forget everyone else on the latest and greatest. It's *your* phone. 
I am fully vaccinated -- I may need to re-up, but my mother has a "gimp" pinky finger that doesn't stretch out all the way, and so does my sister. 

Everyone is vaccinated. I don't have this stupid pinky. 

Mine goes out all of the way. 
HOnestly, it is a last resort antibiotic. 

It may have been abused by doctors for patients in the past. 

But your teeth will look great on the dance floor? Your bones too maybe since it binds to calcium?
Blood samples?

I read the article. I thought he ass raped those kids by subjecting them to a colonoscopy. 
Honestly, jailbreaking can't replace Android esp when most of the developers want bread for apps they never update or are extremely unstable.

Android has its drawbacks, but it isn't a shitshow like /r/jailbreak 
Ugh... that was really long... I've owned a black 4s, a blue 5c, 3x 5s in all three colors, a lot of 6 in all three colors, 6 plus in gold and silver, 6s in gold, silver, and rose gold, 6s+ in space, and rose gold, and 7+ in matte and gold...

:|

I should stop fixing these up. 
I like my iPhone, but I will go back to Android should the iPhone break. 

Note8 or 9? Here I come .
Yeesh.

Sounds like you don't know how to do a screen repair buddy.

For the home button -- did you put in all of the screws in the right place, and is the backplate facing in the right direction? It is easy to flip the backplate of the home button the wrong way.

When you put the screen down, did you make sure to capture the tabs underneath the top of the screen? Is there any loose adhesive around the ring? If you let it bunch up, or if there is a stack of it, the screen won't go down. 
The wall goes from 8th Ave A, C, and E to the 7th Ave 1, 2, and 3. 

It is really long. 
That... that sounds actually normal.

This is a common issue. If you have carrier insurance, replace. IF not, buy a new phone. 
There are countries on this planet where you can buy an iPhone, and there is no Apple store with genuine parts to help you. 
PM Me the IMEI. 

Ill look at the activation [policy. 
No.

I bought a 6s plus for $200 (cracked screen + 141 for the AC+ + 29 for the screen). 

Less than $400, and back in April 2017. No way.

I had completed the game before, but started up my most recent save from a while back -- couldn't figure out why I was in the Henne mines.


The data is not relevant.

Don't use it.
They did it before on the release of iOS 10 with the 6s, and again on 9.2.1 for the 6.
Your third 'source' is stupid. I don't even know why you mentioned it -- kill the fanboyism. 

Do you realize how many variations of the Samsung Galaxy device there are?

Miss me with that bullshit, pt 2. 

And you base this on Google Search trends. I can search cumstain iPhone slow 100,000 times and it will appear. :|
And end up with app vomit? No, thanks :(
You may have to file a civil suit since the guy locked up the phone.

This is why when I sell a phone, I always meet at a bank. 

Anyways, you need to find the receipt if you can, contact Apple, and wipe the phone. 

Also, give me the phone IMEI. It might just be pin locked. 
You can't.

Don't even both tossing the files in DCIM. They won't stick. This isn't Android. 
resetpassword in the terminal.

Might fuck up the keychain though. 
Then put a fucking Apple store in every country -_-
So they got another company to do it.

So now everyone's shit is vulnerable.
Same here.

I got serious, and even with what's left, I feel better (complete poops yas 🙌🏾), and fit into smaller clothes.

I didn't cut out the candy, I just reduced it. Severely. Gum helps. 
How do you know?

Because they say it?
I'm staying on iOS 10.3.3 .

I'll upgrade when I have to. Miss me with that bullshit. 
Honestly, I've been having that issue since iOS 9. I'm on 10.3.3 on the same exact phone you have with the same issue. :|
...Are you being stupid?

You probably downloaded your inbox as well. I downloaded over 20 GB, and that was just my inbox alone. I pay the extra for the 100 GB. 

You are BUGGING the fuck out if you think Apple isn't mining your data as well. *bugging.*
Do the worsened symptoms result in death? Or just additional pain.

One of those uncles I mentioned also had polio before he died and walked with a permanent limp since I've known him. I think he knew what pain was. 
Bro. Dengue fever is no joke.

My family comes from the Caribbean. Lost two uncles to that shit. If they could, they'd line up and take the shot.

I live in the North now, so all we have is West Nile, which is also no joke.
The HD version is trash though.

The voices are terrible -- way too deep in register.
See. Walmart, Target, rite aid. 

Places people can get to.
Yup.

If that is a MLM, it is a shit one to get into b/c their stuff is readily available. :\
Me either...

Wow. I love their lotions, too. Nice and thick.

(Don't message me huns. Not going to buy from you when they sell that shit at rite aid.)
No. 

It is a $20 charger. 

You want to risk $$$ over that? Throw it out and buy a new one.
How did you do the back up restore:

iTunes or iCloud?
The shape is already there.

No forming and filing.
Never settle!
Oooh. 

What kind of builder gel was used for the part on your hand? 

Ugh, that is the color I want when I say "Natural." IBD, you failed me. 
IBD Natural II does not match any of its swatches...

It's basically pink. :|      



The RGB20 is the top grade version of those white powders you see on the internet: https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=RGB20&_osacat=0&_from=R40&_trksid=m570.l1313&_nkw=RGB20+nail&_sacat=0

I'm not linking the seller I bought it from b/c I ordered a gram, and I got a half gram, so we are in disputes for a refund :(

I didn't need to paint a black coat >:3

Gelicious has a nice video differentiating between the two: don't waste the money on the white powder, unless you are looking for something more pearlescent.

Sim free = all carriers. You still be fine.
I've done this before. 

If didn't end well.
Tbh, they look good and didn't cost you bank.

I started off using forms for gel nail application, but that takes too damn long.

I started using tips and 6 hrs became two.
Make sure FastBoot is off in the BIOS.

This is true.

I uploaded her WhatsApp record to Google drive instead.
This app is *trash.*

I used it to transfer the data from my mother's S3 to the 6S I was giving her... it didn't even transfer the images, and downloaded no apps that the S3 originally had.

I ended up just resetting the 6S, installing the apps one at a time, and uploading the S3 photos to Google Photos. 
Look. Enjoy your job, I hope you get out of retail or get to GSM/DCI or a manager position like I did and start making some real money.

I don't really care. 😒
If he used wood screws wouldn't that have cut traces???
I was an Ara that became a dci.

I didn't like charging people for obvious shit.

And I met a lot of people that didn't need to be there. But also a lot of the customers were rude or very entitled, so telling them to drop $300 on a data transfer and an os install let me sleep at night because I wasn't there to be abused.

I was glad to leave... To apple. But now I work for the government so you listen to me lmao.
You could have said that...

If your real nails are going to break like paper, then if you do use color gel I would reinforce it with a clear builder gel brushed in two thin layers.
I inferred that from here: http://reddit.com/r/RedditLaqueristas/comments/8ctotm/its_been_a_rough_day/dxi5zyo

I thought she was trying to build nails.
But protective.

I just dropped my phone on concrete today. Nothing happened.
We are legion ᕦ(ò_óˇ)ᕤ
All that matters is that I can see it naked in is glory.

Also, no broken screens or denta here :3
Probably a crappy case...

(Not trying to be an ass, but the only true case is the otterbox defender...)
Lol.

Mine is almost a year old. I keep it in an otterbox defender.
Didn't get it.
Back is matte.
Not a dude.  
The front os black? 
Phone twin :D
Because mine isn't peeling or pitting...

The phone is a year old.
The x is trash.

Not even I have an upgrade available for a phone with no notch. Sorry. After having a note 8 for a week, that notch is maddening.
No I use a case lol.

This phone is almost a year old in an otterbox defender.

Mint. Crispy.
No wonder they broke...
Wow o.O


I've been doing gel extensions for months, and never had this happen ;~;


What kind of gel did you use? Please tell me you used a hard builder/sculpting like ibd? 


Right now, from what I can see is this: It doesn't look like you have an apex present, esp on the thumbnail. 

https://imgur.com/a9mHETx

https://imgur.com/kaeDuM9


Those two links are just examples of what my current set looks like. I have been wearing these nails since April 4th, and I type with them b/c my fingers can't touch the keyboard (lol). Mine look so thick b/c they were longer, and I filed them down, so the thicker part of the slope are visible. And I need a fill.


As explained here: https://youtu.be/vKB-gQAvb78?t=1m19s


I use ibd clear and Natural II quite often, and what I do to make them stick and *never* break or lift prematurely is this:


I don't have a nail file, but what I do have a Dremel (5k-35k RPM) with a flex shaft and a reverse function. I wouldn't buy this, but I worked as an engineer and modeler for years, so I know my way around it and proper usage. I'd get a real nail file. I use a diamond bit to file down and file away the cuticle on the nail. I do not nip the dead skin still on my hand. Leave it alone.


Wipe away with 91% to 99% IPA solution. Buff gently with a buffing block. Wipe again with IPA. I have a mix of IPA + acetone in a 99:1 ratio, so I can full dehydrate. 


I make sure to scrub in there, and remove the oil completely. 


I follow up with two coats of Mia Secret acid free primer. Best one I've found tbh, the ibd stuff doesn't come close. I do one coat -- wait 30 seconds, then do another coat. 


Then I apply two coats of a standard base coat. Do not wipe the tacky layers in between. Also try not touch them with your fingers otherwise you may transfer oils. 


At this point, I apply a nail form, get my cleaned and dry gel brush, and apply my slip layer using the ibd clear gel and cure that. The slip layer just means brush the gel on the nail, and make a "path" for the gel to run down. 


Once that is cured, I build a thin nail. Thin enough that I can remove the form without breaking the nail, but also thin enough to shape easily with a hand file, like a tip. You'll have to wipe at this point. 


Once I have that, and it is shaped, then I go about building structure, but I do gently buff, wipe, and apply a new coat of primer since the gel is no longer sticky at this stage. 


I take a big goop of gel, and start tickling and teasing it downward and make a mock apex at the true nail free edge, and then I flip my hand upside down so the gel gravitates to create that apex. Once that is done, I cure, and then I file (hand and electric...), and all that good stuff.


Sorry to go on and on, but your thumb leaves me wondering, b/c it doesn't look very strong. Either that, or you are using a cheap gel like UR Sugar, or ... Sina *hrf*. Sina I'll never recommend. Ur Sugar is nice, but only as a color overlay -- not for structure. I only recommend the ibd. 
Irradiated watermelon. 
*gasp* 

Don't you dare D: ... or do. It consents ;)

This is a place where iPhones can frolic in the nude!
I AGREE.

I have a matte black Lenovo Thinkpad. Does that count D:
I just read an article that they identified a drug dealer from his print from the camera of an iPhone 7 Plus, and I realize I CAN SEE MY PRINTS IN THAT PICTURE.

*blocked*

I may not be a drug dealer, but I'm not taking chances.
I'm **red**y for that. 

The underside of these nails are red, to make louboutins. 

Matches the red 8 more lol.

https://i.imgur.com/3JPOOlZ.jpg
Nothing is stopping you :o

/r/malepolish 
I may have to remove them entirely. 

On these nails, the underside is actually red, like louboutins (lol). (https://i.imgur.com/3JPOOlZ.jpg)

I'm starting a new job, and I need to gauge my finger usage before I can apply new nails :(

I'm just going to have to a gel overlay for now, and wear them short *sobs quietly*
I have a Note5. I'm not a fan of the glass back. 

On a cold winter morning when the phone gently smacks you in the face because you are still half asleep... you will wake up instantly b/c it is so damn cold. 
Ty, ty. 

I'll be filing them off on Thursday for a fill :D
It actually lives in an Otterbox Defender... 

It just got naked to take a quick wipe and a nude selfie ;)
Get insurance or Applecare+.

Protect the phone during the contract. 
My first and last name start with D, so people took to calling me double ds
Zucc looks more like a CUP instead...

Probably does...
Honestly, if the only upgrade you want to make is the size -- then yea. 

I'd do that. 
The screen is too damn small.

I do the same shit as op on my 7+ 128 GB, and I will never ever ever ever ever go to a smaller phone. I also have a Note5. :|

In fact, I'm planning to get a Note8 b/c I am size queen. 
My mother used to do this shit all the fucking time at the doctor's office.

My mother is not anti-vax but she didn't like doctor's prying. 

At 15, I started going without her. Honestly, I'm here to get better -- not here to get play your mind games :|
No...

Hngh. A noise.
Use the damn phone. 

This issue is minor. Don't make a mountain out of a molehill. 
I have this issue in iOS 10.3.3 on my 7+.
6s+ SPace Grey. 

HEADPHONE JACKKKKKKK
But them how do you get it out?
My sister joined Primerica for a summer because she thought she would make some money.

She was so fucking mad when she found out she had been deceived.
iPhone 6 16GB.

Given to me instead of cash for a job. Carrier unlocked and everything. 

Used it until I got a 6S 64GB, and then that broke, went into for repairs for another 6 16GB, then back to that 6S 64GB, and then a 6S+ 128GB... and four months later a 7+ 128 GB. :3
If you have another phone logged iun with the same Apple ID, you can change hte password by going to

He can't do anything. 

Just being honest.
I paid $1k for my phone too. And my N model works better than my original device ever did. 

Apple will just replace it. They don't need your intervention. Don't be surprised if it is just sent back to you. 
Lmao... no ._.
The phone is Verizon unlocked.

Next Tether Activation Policy Description:  US Verizon LTE Unlocked Policy

You can remove it from Boost Mobile safely and sell it as the SIM-Free/Global unlocked version of the iPhone X. 

I see you are complaining about Dust in the Earpiece. Get that figured out first before you try to sell the phone, or you might get brick through the window.
That is possible. Usually not the case though. 

Again, your phone is carrier locked for NOT Verizon. 
It isn't a problem.

My iPhone 7 Plus (blk) is a remanufactured model. In fact, all of my iPhones except one are N model phones. (M= retail, N = replacement). In fact, you and I have the same exact phone model. 

Mine is working perfectly.

None of them have problems that the original retail models did. They all work fantastically.

**You are not entitled to a new device. You are entitled to one that works. It says so in the warranty agreement.**

The only time I didn't get a refurbished phone as a replacement was when I had an injury due to the phone. It was a gold iPhone 7 Plus and cut my thumb all the way open. Screen wasn't broken, there was a hump near the camera and  Blood under the screen and everything. The phone had Applecare+ and was only 50 days old. 

They popped a new one out of the box for me and used that as a replacement, because I came in with my finger bandaged up, and a bloodied phone. 
Boost Mobile devices are locked to Boost Mobile if that is where you bought it from for 1 year.

PM me the IMEI and I can tell you if it is unlocked rn. If it is locked and says "sprint/mvno lcoked policy," you need to either pay for an unlock, or you need to follow boost's rule and use hte phone for a year on the network before requesting an unlock.
Meet at a bank that you are a customer at.

Banks have a vested interest in making sure their customers don't get robbed, and do it during their open hours. They usually have a guard onsite too. 

And you can deposit the money right after you get it.
I have apple gsx ._.

I can see the activation policy of every iPhone in the wooooorld. :D
I'm guess it is doing this: 

You are at the home screen, you pop in the SIM card from the Verizon Pixel XL. 

It goes white and says HELLO >_<

It tells you you need to activate the phone. You type in your Apple ID info. 

Doesn't change shit, it just keeps looping back to HELLLLLLLLLLO. 

You pop out the sim card like wtf, and the phone goes back to normal just says "No SIM card insert."

In the menu though, it says the SIM you just put in. 

I've been there. I had a T-Mobile phone that was sold to me as unlocked, and it wasn't. Thankfully it was iCloud unlocked. I got it to the home screen, popped in my Sprint SIM, and that happened. 

In the menu it said Sprint 28.0, but refused the SIM card. 

Sad to say, you'll have to petition TraceFone to get hte phone unlocked. Hopefully they will :D
OK. 

I see why the phone is blanking out and then restarting...

This is not a Verizon phone as you stated in the other comment:

Next Tether Activation Policy Description:  US TracFone / StraightTalk Locked Policy


This a TracFone locked iPhone 5S. TracFone uses VZW/TMO/ATT but REQUIRES a tracfone sim!

A Verizon iPhone, like mine, has the policy of: Next Tether Activation Policy Description:  US Verizon LTE Unlocked Policy
Not really. 

The only thing keeping water out is a ring of adhesive, and some rubber on the bottom screws. 
What exactly happened? 

Error -1 on restore + searching issue is ELIGIBLE for the replacement.

Tell the tech to read: OP1959

Retail - If the iPhone has damage to the display, change repair warranty classification from Quality Program to Accidental Damage and add the iPhone Display Repair S-Part with the whole unit replacement part (prefix 661) to Parts Quoted. Any other physical damage does not qualify for this program. For more information, see How to process a mixed-failure repair (OP1745).

If you phone has liquid damage, then the tech is telling the truth.

PM me your SN. There is a lot more to this. 
Uh. 

I know why you can't... but why are you trying to?
What  are the middle two letters of your SN? 

You might qualify for the quality replacement under the present program. 
Uh ... sadly. 

The tool matches the results of the apple diagnostic perfectly. 

I just did diags on my for sale iPhone 6. 393 cycles, and 94%. But the battery health thing on 11.3 says 94% which matches but doesn't say the cycles.

You can have 1k cycles and 98% and I have seen this a lot. 
Preach.

I have a 7 Plus for my main, and a Note5 for my personal. 

Android is not boring. iOS is, but it is functional. 
PM me the IMEI.

Also attempt to do a restore using iTunes. 
I did this for my iPad mini. 

An old coworker gave me his iPad mini b/c he broke the screen. Fixed it, downgraded the software, and now I have a cellular iPad mini 1 on iOS 8.4.1 :D
Preach.
To my honest: her dad likely had her get the shot because she was already addicted to something.

He didn't want her get an STD because she wanted to fuck for drugs.

Anecdotal, but yes. This is true.

My father and mother forbid soda, but we had other sweet treats that fattened us up. To this day though, I don't drink soda. I never acquired the taste.

I do remember however when it was implemented/proposed in New York City by then mayor Michael Bloomberg, and almost immediately removed:

First -- there were people actually going around with petitions AGAINST the tax, citing this line: if the government starts taxing your soda, what will they do next?

Second -- people started to gain a rebellious attitude towards the proposal. You would see nightly on the news people holding two cups of soda like "f the mayor!"

Third -- we have a major illegal goods issue in bodegas in New York. I don't know if the same speed to Philly, but slide some cash to a bodega owner and you can get most illegal or grey area highs. What is to say there will be no underground market for soda?

When the proposal failed, ads started going up instead showing someone pouring a soda out that would turn into fat instead. There are also calories counts on the menus which shock and awe people, but ultimately don't change what they order. There are also salt shaker items here, indicating that a meal might have more salt than the recommended daily dose, but again, doesn't change what people order. (I'll find the study on that.)

There is currently no evidence that any of this is working.
You know what is crazy?

I've seen that.

I replaced the battery on a client's phone who was having the issue where the device would never charge past 2%.

Even with the battery replaced, it still never got past 2%. I told her I'll replace the phone for the $29 price b/c that is what would make me feel comfortable. She was OK with it, and now she has a working phone.

Peculiarly... also an iPhone 7. Verizon model. A1660. 
?

They just has a 20% off sale... 
Agreed... Except now I work for them. Hngh.

But fuck the G train in particular.
26. Same. 

I use Otterbox Defenders or Hard Core cases only. 
Exactly. 

My mother was pulling a sweet salary, better than my dad was. Full insurance for the fam, and all that good stuff. 

Her gender wasn't going to keep from making this schmoney, so yea ._.
np
Uh. I think having children might be part of that. :\
I agreed.

My mother worked, and my father took care of myself and my sister and my cousin when we were growing up b/c he didn't have a job. 

It was never weird. He kept the house clean, and everyone fed.

If she is making $8k a year working from home, her time is wasted completely. It would be different if she made $50k or something, but 8? Come on. 
350
Fucking preach.

My $200 (cost of parts) MBP 2012 was given to me by a deceased relative.

I installed two hard drives, one SSD and one HDD, upgraded the ram to 16gb, and then piece of shit had heat issues after a year.

Redid the thermal grease on the logic board = waste of my fucking time.

My T60p I got for $150, and traded in for $75 for a newer Thinkpad had water spilled in it the day I got it, and ran longer than that piece of shit Mac.

I'm thinking of parting out the MacBook. 🤦🏾‍♀️
You ok with the color pink ._.

Pink 6s+ 64gb CDMA and GSM unlocked.

Relaxed by Apple.
This new style is trash.

Any time I want to get real work done, I'll go to control panel...

I don't trust the settings app 🙅🏾‍♂️ (I'm not a dude, but I can't find the female emoji)
I work at Apple not Asurion.

You have no idea how many carrier stores will recommend this to their customers :\
Eh, I suppose. There were more things I bought, like detergent. 
???
I would never recommend to not go thru apple for a screen replacement unless it was an old phone.

I work at apple. 

If we fuck up, we replace the phone.

I recently had a fellow tech I was teaching absolutely fuck up my pink 6s+. It was replaced.

Edit: also, wow fuck you.

That isn't what I said at all. I told you to report the phone as lost to asurion and pay the lost fee, then sell the broken shit for parts because if asurion doesn't have the parts, they'll cut you a new one instead.

You'll make back all your money from selling the broken device to a refinisher, and you'll have a new phone. You'd be out no money. Even the staff at my local att recommended this when I mentioned I had loss but no damage insurance.
I used to do the same thing. 

In my area, there was a Pathmark. I convinced my mother to go with me so I'd have a second person to load up my cart with. 

They had a triple coupon thing going on, and I had like 50 inserts b/c they throw them out on my block and no one used them so even at the tender age of 18, I was already digging through the trash for them.

I had maybe 100 coupons for tea, and a whole bunch of shit. 100 coupons for chewing gum, everything you could think of.

We loaded up two carts for $80. Went early in the morning too. I even gave the cashier a stack of coupons. 

I had 100 boxes of tea, 500 packs of gum, cheap healthy food stuffs like yogurt that I would normally never buy. 

We even went back later that day b/c my mother was so impressed with the savings. 

We loaded up on heavier stuff so we had to have a car service drive us back home, but bruh. We didn't need anything else for almost 4 years. We stored the stuff at a storage unit. 

Then we started running out of detergent, and other little things. Now, I still coupon, but not as excessively. I'm older, I have a job, I don't have the time so much, but on Saturdays, I'll still make sort lists where I have the coupons all set so I can just grab and go.

You are completely right about the inserts being straight trash. I remember the P&G inserts -- bruh. So much brand name stuff for so little money. I was hooked on Downy Unstopables. Then the coupons dried up, and so did me buying them. :(
$10

Even if you have dark skin.

I'm a light skinned black woman, and I fucking tan. It peeled. I cried. 

I'm black, how could this happen to me? 🤷🏾‍♀️

Uh, the sun doesn't care. 🤦🏾‍♀️ Put on the sunscreen. I even use sunscreen when I do a gel manicure.
My location has over 80 of each battery.

Problem is, people will come in and not have done backups before hand, or anything else for that matter. 

We take some people without appointment for that shmoney. :3
Eh...

Don't let this kind of survey get under your skin.

I'm 26, and they still don't let me buy liquor. Just stay away from the alcohol and the cigs. Eat healthy and exercise...
Lmao. Get him.
You are crazy.

Esp that one with the blue room and Cody Lane? Shitttt. I say poor girl for that one. I know she's a H addict so she was prob doing it for the drugs which is why she didn't say no. And I think she was raped as a child because she mentioned before a shoot her first anal was at 8. 

All very sad.

Mine was I think $250 when it was bought. It isn't portable, but it has outlasted a lot of my electronics. 

I even had a Kenmore sewing machine that is still kicking. No wonder Sears is going out of business. Build shit to last, and people won't come back. 
Omg sorry.

The price is coming down too. $699 for the 64 GB version. Down almost $100 :o
There is no customizing...

Nova Launcher is the shit. I still use that on my Note5 <3
> So you would have committed insurance fraud, and then sold a phone with a broken screen and likely a bad imei?

Some people only buy insurance on the loss, and some carrier representatives will actively encourage their customers to cite the phone as lost instead of broken. 

Happened all of the time when I was an AT&T customer. 


Have you seen REWA technologies videos on refurbishing an OLED screen? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syC-HJLjokI

These Chinese refinishers will pay $$ for these OLED screens b/c they cost so damn much. Why do you think that screen replacements for even old Samsung phones are still $$?

My mother's AMOLED S3 screen costs $200 to replace. The S3 is an old ass phone.

Unlike shitty LCD, they are made by two companies, and are hard to fake. They will pay $ for that screen.

You could have got a new iPhone X instead, possibly with a new warranty, sold the old phone to a refinisher, and would have been out no money, but you were impatient. 

Do you have a second phone? Or you just need to be seen with your X?

Food for thought the next time you drop it. 
Tbh, if she never had find my iPhone on it, consider it gone.

A smart thief would not care about the info inside, just simply restore it and set it up as new. And if you blacklist it, they can just pay to have to replaced at Apple, or a sketchy eBay listing.

PM me the IMEI. I can see when it was wiped if the phone was unlocked, and only if the phone is carrier unlocked. It shows a restore date. 

I can also see if Find My iPhone is on. 
I would have just said the phone was lost, and then pay the full deductible, and then sold the other phone on craigslist or something b/c repair shops in china will pay $$ for oled screens for the X.

They have the tools to refurbish those. You'd have probably spent nothing on the repair if you were thinking ahead :|

This is nonsense and you know it. The vibe motor on the 7 is the taptic engine. :|
If your core apps are tied up with Google, much like myself, it is *ok.* 

Photos needs to be open to upload photos. The background uploading is hit and miss. 

YouTube Red is more expensive on iPhone, but I'm on a family plan with my sister on her Android so we pay the regular price. :)

It's OK. I just don't let iCloud handle anything but my photos :\
Carrier lock! Not iCloud!!!!!!!!
PM me the IMEI.

I'll do a look up, and let you know carrier and lock status :\

I want to see how this goes meself. 

You can PM /u/lolitslamby to see I'm legit lmao. 
No way. -_-

That Nas drive is a raid1 mirror.

So much redunancy!!!

If it is important, keep it. If not, don't or don't be sad when you lose it. 
If you open it regularly, then you won't have thousands of photos. 
That is precisely what I am saying.

That would be so lit. 

But no. One or the other says Apple :(
Oh, NAND backups.

Complete back up of the data partition and you can restore it any phone. ;-;
You know Apple uses Google servers for cloud storage?

Says Google can't access data. Allegedly. Take your chances. :)
Mine was the phone on the car roof.

The phone flew off, and just hit the highway at the entrance ramp. I saw there was a drink all over my back window, and I didn't have my phone. I stopped (it was 5 AM, no one was there), looked for my phone using my Android to call it, and even an Otterbox that shit was trashhhhhhhhhed. It hit the wall at at least 60 mph.

AppleCare covered it at $99 for a replacement, but that backup I made an hour ago saved my ass. I still had all my text messages, my important photos, my contacts. No fuss, no muss. 
I like you too! 

Although, you do more local backups than I do >_>;;

I do it once every two weeks, but it goes to iCloud every night.

But, it is clear we do this b/c our data is important to us. 
Honestly... you need to decide how important that data is.

If you haven't made use of the phone or its data in over a year, you may not require it. 

Google Assistant so amazing. 

I can now use it to turn off my TV b/c my TV has CEC and Chromecast.

My sister asked "Have we gone too far?" 

"No," I replied. And then I asked Google to turn off the TV. :D
My dad saw a big difference going from the 6 to the 6s plus. 

You would see a massive one, I would think, going from the 6 to the 7 Plus or 8. 
Wait -- you can purchase Applecare+ on the refurbs? 

Why would anyone buy an iPhone new than lmapo/ 
It made me cringe as well.

But as said even in OITNB, blacks (and other minorities) can be racist, but can't act upon the racism in the way that people in power can. 

If you have a guy in power with a predilection against minorities and poor people regardless of his race, HE can act on his prejudices. 
A YEAR OMG SORRY.

Edited!!!
Hm hm hm. Esnt to trade a Note8 for a 7+ heheh.
I can give you the history. 

PM serial or IMEI. That is only if the person went to Apple :<
Did you know you can make TouchID read every single finger? 

When you set it up, just tap each finger on it. 

TouchID only reads a PART of the finger or whatever you show it during set up. When I had a Ballistic HC on my 6S, I could only expose a small section of my thumbprint due to the design of the case.

https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51j%2BV5V6WjL._SL1000_.jpg

It worked. 
Agreed.

If there was too much liquid on my finger, my Note5 would say "wipe your hands."
I use OneDrive instead.

$70 a ~~month~~ YEAR, I get Office apps and 1 TB of storage space. Full res too. 

Apple's iCloud doesn't compare to that.

IMAP only bro.

You'd be insane to POP3 on an iPhone. 

Edit: 
Why -- POP3 stores a copy of the email locally. Imagine if someone had a 50 GB mail server, and it was 75% full and now the iPhone has to download a copy of each email to the phone, AND its attachments? No way. 

Make sure the ISP isn't blocking "less secure apps" that use IMAP/POP. 
Maybe you should try that first... but more than likely your battery is considered "consumed."
I had mine replaced for this reason. 

It kept hissing at me even during phone calls. :\
If you buy the phone w/o a carrier, it is better. 

But, I agree. Carrier insurance tends to be where it is at. 
I use them for my commute. 

If the headphones are dead when I get on the train, then I have nothing to listen to. 

No videos, no music, no games. I'm not the kind of person that plays their content at 80 without headphones while other people are on the train with headphones.
I've noticed this issue with the 6s.

Tbh, DA2 is a great game once you finish Inquisition.

You know the vibe motor is in the taptic engine... Right?

When you remove the taptic engine from the phone, all vibration stops.
So you see how many people complain constantly about iOS 11 being a battery drain?

iPhone 7 Plus still on iOS 10.3.3.

Won't catch me dead on iOS 11. I'm missing a shit load of emojis though, so my sister on her S8 constantly sends me ? boxes instead. 
Hey, right now I have the best of both worlds.

I have a 7 Plus, and a Note5. 

When I get myself a new Galaxy as my main phone, I'll have a Galaxy and a 7 Plus.

I got two phones. 
Bruh. 

Look at the size of the taptic engine for each one:

Look at the size of the taptic engine for the phones that have it:

X: https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/MUXnVof2qWYCCEMY.huge

Look how small it is on the 6s+ and the X? Remove the barometric vent, and then do a linear shrink to the left. *space.*
That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Bro, did you make this thread for it to be an echo chamber, or get the actual opinions of people?
Come back of the weekend, holy shit. I'm screenshotting this. 
That's shit and you know it. 

They removed it on the 7, and didn't introduce wireless charging. Why? 

Apple gets royalties every time someone has to make a headset or a device that plugs into the Lightning port so the user doesn't get a "accessory is not supported" warning. 

That is money Apple can make. If someone doesn't want bluetooth headphones, their only recourse are lightning headphones, which are sold and made by, you guess it, Apple. 

What if I wake up and my headphones aren't charged? I'll have to use wired, which means I need a dongle -- made by Apple. Or headphones -- made by Apple.

And then I am putting 2x wear on the port. In go headphones, out goes the charger. Instead of just, in goes the charger.
omg no

You ruin my sleep, you play with your life D:

Perhaps, but in the here and now, it is still here. 

So Samsung, I'm coming \o/
Speak for yourself. 

I may not charge and listen to music at the same time, but I'm not going to run the charge on my Bluetooth headphones for some nighttime listening. 

This is why I have two phones :\
Me too lol
Have you opened an iPhone that lacks this jack? There is space for it.

The 7 for example. Change the shape of the taptic engine and boom. Space.

Or remove the useless barometric pressure gauge and boom: space.

Just because a technology is old, didn't make it useless unless it has been superceded by something better like FireWire was with USB.

Bluetooth is capable, but it suffers from interference, needs to be charged, and can be incredibly inconvenient when things decide to unpair.

It doesn't just work.
Lmao.

I got three phones for a little over half of what you paid lol.

Let me not tell you about the fourth or fifth one because then you might die lol.

I'll tell you lmao. 

Fourth one: 6s, cracked screen. Bought for $60 from the owner who didn't know what Applecare+ was apparently. 
Phone also had a failed battery, so I was able to get it replaced for $29. That's $89 ;D Verizon unlocked. 

Fifth one: 6s, cracked screen. Bought for $80, fixed the screen for $140.45, and gave it to my mother. Verizon unlocked ;D That's $221. 

So, uh yea. $923 for five phones. *laughs at your $850...*
1. There is a reason that even a company as big as Samsung pays to use the induction technology from another company.

It is tried and true and it has been tested rigorously. Do it wrong, and the phone can explode. So you can make your own and waste all that r and d money and have to recall your companies main product and lose an bunch of money, or go with the standard and play it safe.

Imagine if Apple had a note 7 debacle? Unlike Samsung, thru don't make everything else under the sun like washing machines, TVs, stoves, and sound equipment. A recall would murder their profits for years.

2. So you remember what it was like before the headphone jack was standard on phones?

The blackberry had a 2.5 mm connector, and some phones had a special connector for their headphone that made them hard to find when you lost them. The 2.5mm connector is not a standard. 

Everyone's Walkman came with a 3.5 mm connector and the walkmans usually came with headphones included.

So when the 2.5 mm connector vanished and the 3.5 mm connector became standard on phones, people no longer needed the 3.5 to 2.5 adapters/dongles, or the specialized headphones you could only use per phone.

You only need one headset and it JUST WORKS. You plug it in. No fumbling with Bluetooth or distortions.

The port itself is unbelievably cheap. Cents on the dollar. The license is cheap too. It is also consumer friendly. $0.99 headphones? $10 headphones? They might suck but they JUST WORK.

Instead, you now get to put extra wear on your single port. Double or triple the wear depending on the port.

It doesn't benefit the OEM or the consumer. If you tell me a phone is missing a headphone jack, especially since I remember what it was like before the port was standard on smartphones, the phone is going to miss me.

You need to back up your statement or explain it.

3. I remember FireWire. I also remember how quickly it died.

FireWire was supposed to replace SCSI, ADB, and be fast . It was for a time and could even do full duplex. Then it got expensive. Because, well. Apple wanted their royalties.

 Then USB got cheaper, and better and look at today. If a PC vendor said give me the cheapest so I can make the most profit, you'd only get USB, and it's controller and the display ports and that's it.

Notice you never see FireWire on any older PC laptops?

Now you just see USB. It is faster than FireWire is at least as of 3.0, and now a dead technology because the parent company got greedy.

The 7 I bought off of someone who didn't realize the phone was still in warranty.

$100 and a same day trip to the Apple store I had a new phone.

The $375 for the 6s+ was shady af. 128gb, band 30, side grey. 

The phone was $200 and had a cracked screen. It was also carrier unlocked att model making it the same as the SIM free model.

So I bought it.

At this time, Apple let people buy Applecare so long as they were within the 1 year warranty. 

So I bought it. 

$140.45 for the Applecare for the 6s+ at the time with NYS tax.

$31.58 for a failed screen replacement from Apple that resulted in a phone replacement.

So 200 + 141 + 32 is 373. 

The phone now sits in a closet because I got another of the same phone for my father for $140 with applecare+ off of a co-worker.  😐
I don't think so.

Unlike Apple, they made a water proof phone with a headphone jack instead of using the excuse to remove it to make more money off of licensing for their proprietary port. The water resistant s5, S7, s8, s9, note 7, and note 8 are all water resistant and all have a headphone jack.

My sister has a galaxy s8. The phone is a true work of art.

At $400, I'll stick with my 7+ because I've only had it since July and I got it for $100, and I bought a 6s+ for $375 I only used for 4 months before I got the 7+.

I don't have that kind of scratch to be spending it on a phone every second.
I miss it. Apple's motto (at least as I see it here) was "it just works."

I have a pair of wired headphones that I keep on my nightstand so I don't disturb anyone. 

Well, I can't use them without the splitter, or the dongle. My wireless headphones are for my commute only, so I don't keep them on my nightstand.

So what I do instead, is take my wired headphones, and I plug them into my Note5, and I use that phone instead. :\

My next phone will be another Galaxy for sure, but not until my 7 dies. Might take a while. 
*It all depends on how it falls, and what it falls on.*

So sick of these posts. There are posts from people who dropped their iPhone X once, and it shattered.
OK... I get what you are saying...

But I have had the ability to backup messages to my GMail with an app when I had an Android in 2009. 

I paid $55 for 5 licenses for a program to backup my messages in PDF format from my iPhone to my Google Drive and my OneDrive. 

I think Apple can get it together with all these engineers they are paying, and get my messages in the cloud. 
I never had any luck with Revlon's matte coats. 

I've only been able to get a true matte with gel :|
This issue is resolved for the A1660 models with the service program out right now.
Everything works.

I'm on an unlocked 7+ right now.
See?

But people want to down vote.
You can see if you can still buy AC+ by going to checkcoverage.apple.com and purchasing it there.

Even if something is broken ;)
Apple would repair it at the whole unti repair price. 

Applecare+ ?
iOS 11.2 is no longer being signed. 

So no. 
Not sure why this was downvoted, but I agree. 

7+ on iOS 10. Not experiencing any of these issues. 
Pm me the serial or imei
Body phones are locked to boost for 12 months
Pm me the imei. I can check that.
So you are correct on the first statement.

The model is CDMA and GSM capable so you can use the phone on boost, and actually, even while still on boost if you go to another country and pop in the SIM, it will work or if you switch to cricket. Traitor.

I think it is marketing. 🤷🏾‍♀️ I say that because if what I will say next...

All 6s pluses are CDMA capable and GSM capable when unlocked. I used the att unlocked variant of the 6s plus because that is what I have.

A1687 is the Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile version, and A1634 (sim free/unlocked for all carriers/att variant) comes with an extra band 30 and is solely what sets those two models apart.

You can use any variant of the 6s or 6s plus on boost so long as it is paid off, Sprint locked, Verizon unlocked or Apple unlocked.
Honestly, my only explanation is you might have been touching the phone in your sleep, or said a trigger word for Siri.

Because you changed your physical region, it is possible the phone changed the voice of Siri to Chinese, and this is what you saw when you woke up. 

As you stated, the phone was speaking to you. If the phone was on Aeroplane mode as you stated, and it started talking, it probably was saying "Siri not connected to the internet." 
*shakes /u/firstlastnamewilldo* NEVER FORGET!
Yes they work. Hold up let me get to a computer'

Edit: 
I came to Boost with an unlocked iPhone 6. I got a Verizon 6S next, then an AT&T unlocked 6S+, and then a Verizon unlocked 7+. 


iPhone 6 and 6S will come with CDMA and GSM bands so you can use them. You just need a SIM card and that will be tied to the IMEI/MEID of the phone.

The 7, 8, and X require that you get either the CDMA and GSM unlocked version if you buy it hot and fresh from Apple all out. There are two version of each phone size (7 CDMA and GSM, 7+ CDMA and GSM, 8, 8+, X so on so forth.) 

You MUST make sure to get the version of the 8 Plus or X with the QUALCOMM antenna. 

https://www.apple.com/iphone/LTE/

If you see here, version A1865 will work with Boost even if it is bought straight money from Apple and unlocked b/c it has the CDMA bands. 

The GSM version that work on AT&T and TMobile WILL NOT.

Any question, ask me -- the person woh actually has used a shitload of unlocked iPhones on Boost and not /u/firstlastnamewilldo  :|
Resolved!!! Yay!
Also on 10.3.3.

Stopped popping up for a while an hour ago.

Still can't log in to the app store though.
It is out on the system status page.

☹️
...No. 

The alarm will stop sounding when it goes into snooze. 
You are the one saying this, so you are going to need to source it.

Sounds like bullshit tbh.
I have a similar set up, except I have a 240 GB SSD as my main drive.

I use a symbolic link to make a "fake" point where the back ups are stored on the C drive and I point it to a mech drive with more space. To do this, you need to first go to:

C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\MobileSync and remove everything inside. THIS WILL DELETE YOUR BACKUPS so either *move* it or *remove* it. 

Since you are on Windows 10, press ctrl + x and then a to open Powershell with Admin, or Command Prompt with Admin depending on what version of Windows 10 you are on. **You need to use Command Prompt. Powershell does not recognize the mklink command.**

Make your new destination folder (mine was called iTunes Backup Dumping Grounds)

In ommand Prompt type:

mklink /J “C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup” “<Your External HDD>:\<iTunes Backup name>”

So mine would be: (quotes are necessary b/c my folders have spaces in them. You can also hit tab to autocomplete folder names.)

mklink /J "C:\Users\OptionalCookie\AppData\Apple Computer\MobileSync\Backup" "E:\iTunes Backup Dumping Grounds" 

Anything copied to the backups folder will go to the new destination on drive E. 


The point of card benefits.
Shitposts like this are the reason that people were calling for this sub to be nuked. 

64 people just died, and the first post says it likely more than that. 

You are watching people die -- don't be crass about it. Have some respect. If you are going to be an ass, keep it to yourself. You don't need to make every thought a comment. 
The point of the credit card is to be used when you do something wrong within the first 90 days of purchase.

So long as you don't abuse is, you should be fine.

I shattered a teapot and filed my first damage claim in over 5 years of being an Amex cardmember. 

I haven't needed to do another one since and I've been a card member for 8 years. 

Fuck out of here. 
For me, I made Alistair King with anora and took loghain as a Warden.

This way, Alistair can live, and I can still have my side boy.


It is .99 for me. I also buy iTunes gift cards and load into my account, but there is no tax on those either.

You live in CA? I'm in NY.
It isn't even taxed.
If you paid by credit card, file a damage claim.
I pay $150/yr for the parks Dept recreation center here in NYC.

Gym, classes, and a pool.

So cheap Ava right across the street from me. I can poop at home.
I reported my issue: 2 years later and the restaurant is still in the wrong spot in Apple maps. I just checked.
Apple did the same thing to me in New York City. 

One of the most mapped cities in the world.

I was going to a restaurant to meet with some old friends, and I use Apple maps because this was my first iPhone, and why not.

Led me to a locked building four blocks away.

Opened Google maps to realize my true location. 😐

The moment I could remove Apple maps, I did.
No. Dont ever recommend this channel again.
My only bowel complication is that mine are huge.

Like Jesus. As long as my arm.

And I go everyday. Ugh.
Have this upvote.

You arent wrong about one and two.

Number three, if your man is wandering, find a new one. Kind of goes with number two.
No. You can't.

They don't remove. They are still there just hidden.

And even if I remove maps and keep Google maps, it is still requests for maps even though I don't want to use Apple maps 
iPhones are pretty bad here to with uninstallable shit and no default apps. 

☹️
Really?

I just recently got a second restraining order and only then was the box ticked that the offender had to give up their guns. 

She is a mental health patient, and she ended up catching the bad end of a beat down on my part when she sucker punched me.

Haven't seen her in months since the second time she did that shit.
I licked my own shit.

It was salty.
Batteries can explode.
... Black Melania?

People knew about Beyonce before they knew about Melania.

And Melanias stunning achievement is being the president's wife 
Tbh, pin 3 is the one that really has to be covered. 

I don't think it should be a problem. 
Preach.

I come from a country where MMR diseases were prevalent.

You know we all lined up for those shots for sure.

I better reup mine tbh...
You can use milk drop with foobar and stay high.
A five dollar charge caused my mother to wild the fuck out and cancel time warner.

She wasn't wrong.
Because you don't know what might happen to her between here and now?

She might be (all forbid) sexually assaulted, she might play with a dirty needle, she might start having sex before you know she is having sex -- like fuck. Come on, think.
Holy shit.

Do not want.
Tbh, I don't do acrylics because if the smell, I do feel mostly, but some people can't grow out their nails.

I personally cut my nails short and I do gel extensions and fills instead (on myself, with my own gel.)

I like it that way. 🤷🏾‍♀️
So why don't no companies join and leave Nvidia living themselves instead...?
So, do you use extraneous Android functions like downloading files from the internet directly to the phone, or the OTG functions on the phone?

Would you be fine being cut off completely from downloading a file to the phone for later use, or are you OK having internet access at all times?

How do you feel about iTunes and only iTunes for general management? Are you prepared to pay for something extra to save your text messages?

Do you like using default programs? How you would feel losing Google integration? 

(These aren't necessarily drawbacks.)
Yeah. 

Even when I was a grunt, I got $18/hr, but my work was specialized. 
How do you use your Android?

You have to remember where you are asking this question. This sub will push an iPhone on you even if it isn't for you whereas Android might be a bit more forgiving on the subjects and gadgets might be completely forgiving.

Do you use it for productivity? 
Are you dead ass
I got paid almost $20/hr at that job.


What a friend of mine did was basically say, I can't afford this. Let's negotiate.

$5k went to $1.5k, and he paid it all the same day after the hospital wrote out a contract.
Tbh. When I worked retail, even I got a better plan than that.

$100 every paycheck, doctor visits are $30, some are less, and others are $50.

$350 deductible, oop max is $3,500 and 90% coins.
I was thinking of reinstalling it again, since I don't have the time to tabletop any more :(

Then I'd lose another 15 hours of my life. No thanks. 
Wait, hold up?

What is happening? 

I come to WPD because it makes me not take my safety for granted.

The other day, I saw a cyclist ride straight on into traffic, and the only reason he didn't die was because someone driving was paying attention. This is in NYC by the way.

A few days before that, when I came out of the subway station, the don't walk hand had already come up meaning I can't cross, but the cars looked far enough away that if I ran I could have made it. But I *didn't.* I've seen enough people die here from their own stupidity wanting to do the *exact* same shit I was poised to do just to shave a few extra seconds off of their commute. 

I used to think that cars have to stop for me when I cross the street and that attitude continued well into my 20s. WPD changed that shit for me, and that shit stopped when I also go behind the wheel of a car. I am driving a one ton vehicle, and the state effectively gave me a license to kill.

I can't imagine a reddit without WPD. It has changed my whole worldview. 

Some of the deaths here aren't handled as elegantly in the comments as they should be, and that is the only thing I think needs to change. Simple politeness and respect is required, but the content shouldn't change. 
Up voted for the nick alone.

I love that game.
This. 

My iPad uses UK time b/c I use it solely to talk to my family back home, so I set the time different so I don't wake someone up. 

My phone was fucking up the message times, so I had to remove iMessage from my iPad :\
I do this. 

My main phone is an iPhone so no Boost Dealz, but I got my Note5 with it on so I can get my money. 
Don't treat me like I'm stupid. 
Don't be like that.

I'm from New York City.

She's white.
A co worker of mine is like this. 

Nails and hair done. Just bought $250 Jordans. I said, girl, you just had a baby. Save up for his education. 

Nah, I need these for me.

Next week. $500 Coach bag. I saw the receipt. I said, wow, you didn't need that bag, didn't you just get Jordans last week, you have a child. 

Can't I be happy?

She got fired a few weeks ago, so I hope she was able to return the bag. 
These are all of my friends. 

I went on a vacation I saved up for apart from my savings, and I put pictures on Facebook. I went with my co workers, because I decided to go with people who were getting a check every two weeks. 

My old friends are wondering why they weren't invited. *Because you don't have jobs.* The last time we went out to eat, only two of us were gainfully employed and had to pick up the check, and someone had the nerve to talk about dessert. :|

Once a week, I would get hit up with something from an MLM from these people. I even did Primerica for a week to try it (I learned a lot from the class tbh), but fuck that shit, it was a cult. I'm not OK with that.
omg drop these people. 

Stop enabling them. 

They have to go!
I use the 1440p on my Note5 on the regular. I get 8 hrs, but I usually idle the phone... because I am working ._.
I am the owner of 20000 iPad mini screens... And one iPad.
I only use the IBD when it comes to hard gel, girl ;)

I've got four or five bottles sitting on my shelf... more like had T_T

The shelf fell, and I watched 2 bottles disintegrate when they hit the ground. I have to file a credit card claim, but my heart. </3
Mind telling us? 
That happened to my friends Note8 after DST changed. 
I didn't say that.
Tbh, it reminded me of the Crow. 

Yeesh. I turn the TV off when I see that episode, but then again, I don't like crime police shows.
I'm going to need a picture of that.

The supplier I am familiar with usually will purchase broken OEM screens, and remove the glass and then put on a new glass, polarizer, and OCA. 

The screens have a funny look b/c I wear glasses, so I can see the "slowness" b/c my glasses are transitions.

I can tell a fake screen when I see it due to Apple training, but also they have a frame drop that is pretty evident when you are wearing glasses. :<
Natural or Natural II ?
Tbh, most of the screens are actually OEM parts in terms of the LCD + touch combo.

It is the polarizer and the OCA glues that make the screens look wonky.
Whatever activation policy was on the phone previously, is the same one that comes over.

Note: You can only see the activation policy if you either work in a mobile store, or if you work/worked for Apple. You can't see this by just willy nilly punching your IMEI into places

Example: I had an original iPhone 6S+ from AT&T. The original activation policy was 23, AT&T Activation Policy.

When I got it unlocked, it became 2303, Multi-Mode Unlock (for CDMA + GSM capable phones).

Unfortunately, the phone was replaced due to a battery replacement gone wrong :(

Because the policy comes from the old phone when the repair is closed, you have to first close the repair to properly activate the phone. From there, it can take a few different policies after activation: 

4004, United States Country Default Flex Policy    
2388, S2388 US Loaner & Service Picker policy - iPhone 7/8/X - Eureka    
2354, US Loaner & Service Picker policy - iPhone 6/6S - 2015/2014    

Then it will go to your normal activation policy. 


If you want me to check the activation policy, I can: just PM me the serial. If you got an unlocked phone, then I wouldn't even trip. Just say *blessed.* 

If it is still on the picker policy, then when you restore the phone next, the phone will lock :T

Because data ._.

If I have a 1 GB plan, you think I want to waste it sending a 5 MB picture when WhatsApp can compress it to 500 KB? Use your brain.


Same here. 

When I lived with my family in the UK before coming to America, it was JUST WhatsApp. No one actually knew what iMessage was...

I'm still stuck using WhatsApp to talk to my cousins even though they have iPhones, but it is crossplatform, so that this nice. 
SO THEN WHY DID YOU MAKE THIS POST?

I AM CONFUSION
Also remember the Samsung is chugging out a higher resolution. 

And it doesn't really matter anyways. Guess who is making the iPhone X screens... Oh. Yes. Samsung. 

Doesn't matter which phone you buy, people richer than everyone on this subreddit are winning. Esp Samsung. 
Take this with a grain of salt. 

Use the phones, and stop worrying about what is faster. You won't notice after a few months anyways when you clog up both phones with your shit lol
So you get it. 

Do you think you dropping the device in water had anything to do with device having issues :|
...Come on. 

WATER AND ELECTRONICS DO NOT MIX.
Hngh.

Bluetooth module might be fucked.

See if you can have someone on Apple Support run diags for you. 

I would, but I'm leaving rn :(

Actually: pm me your sn. I'll send you a diagnosis ticket.
Well, you didn't say that. -_- I'm not psychic. 

Do you have another phone or device you can test with the BT speaker.
Make sure the speaker isn't the issue first. 
Her 😉

But np. The battery serial was also the same, so forget cycle counts. It is the same exact unit.
This is actually explained in the attached documentation in the images.

https://www.hgst.com/sites/default/files/resources/HGST-Power-Disable-Pin-TB.pdf

Basically, those three pins never had a purpose before, but now they do. 
Uh... so yea. OP read my reply to your PM... 

You need to get an emergency appointment ASAP to save the client experience D:
lmao. Hate. I mean hate.
Did you try that? Did it work? 

What version of the 7 Plus do you have? It will hit you with invalid SIM if the device IMEI has not been tied to the ICCID on the Sprint account, or if you are using the GSM model of the phone and the SIM can't make sense of the 1 X EV-DO freqs. 

Customer is only right 10% of the time.

When I hear "how can we resolve this?" I want to throw a brick at someone's house.
And some customers lay on the verbal abuse for shit that is their fault 90% of the time.

You are a week out of the return policy. The date is right there. Uh huh. You want to speak to a manager? Uh huh. Uh huh. Store discretion.

You broke your item and have no protection plan? You want to return it? Uh huh uh huh.

*Dies inside*
I used to work at best buy as a dci.

Then when my position was eliminated, in went to Apple because by that time, I had almost 50 repairs under my belt in a month.

Then I got a government job, so I left.

I reached out to my old manager (at apple) when the battery replacement stuff started, so my days off are for part time work. The extra cash helps, and I didn't even have to re interview.

You guys at the phone hub are saints. Dealing with shit so I don't have to lmao.
https://imgur.com/gallery/PS9Xx

iPhone 7 plus. I love this background.
Lmao on the money. 

I do maybe 10 battery replacement in a 5 HR shift. More if I agree to stay in the back and just replace while other people do the paperwork.

Having to go over the same spreche with each person is mind numbing. 
No they aren't.

Hey someone to pull the hard drive and do a data transfer.
Oh shit you are right.

Hold on. I vaguely remember the name of that software.

It is called gecko toolkit. Only works up to iOS 6.x.x.

Edit: https://www.unlockboot.com/gecko-iphone-toolkit-reset/


Has valuable photos -- never backed it up.

They couldn't be that valuable then.

Here:
It is called gecko toolkit. Only works up to iOS 6.x.x.

Edit: https://www.unlockboot.com/gecko-iphone-toolkit-reset/

Apple replaced my 6s+ and it came with iOS 9.3.2

I left it right there.
Sprint? 

Type: ##UPDATE# then hit call.
Agreed.

Anyone who spends more than $5 on a screen protector is a fool.

Get a good case, and a glass protector and you are fine.
I usually get 8 hr sot on my 7+, but I'm in iOS 10.3.3.

If the op has an iPhone 6, this is actually feasible.

The batteries for the iPhone 6 don't come with the adhesive preapplied like that of the other devices.

I usually apply tge adhesive to the new battery first so even if I am tired, I don't mix them up.
Pm me your device serial.

I can check if the battery was actually changed. What I always do with my clients is show them the battery diagnostic before and after, or if I help another tech, I demand that they do that because I want my surveys. And my diagnostic compliance to go up. I'm greedy like that.

I probably did like 100 replacements this week alone, but that doesn't mean you get sloppy. 

Curious: do you have an iPhone 6? I can see someone making that mistake with a 6, but not any other device tbh.
iOS 10.3.3 7+

It does it. So cute.
Phone a doctor.

Please. It doesn't matter what anyone thinks except that you are bleeding from your clit.

No sex for a while... Again lmao.
You are going to need to explain that.

I think you guys have blinders on and are suffering from white woman syndrome.

I'll let you rock. Peace.
I do not hate white people at all.

My boyfriend is white. Clearly I don't hear him enough to let him fuck me. 😐

Again, you are reading context that isn't there, but ok. I'll let you go about your business.
But the crime tends to be intraracial, yes?

White people kill white people and black people kill black people. 
If you think I'm trying to justify this video, turn you are putting words where I didn't put them, and finding the context you want.

I'm going to say this: if it wasn't an elderly white woman being abused like this, would you be as up in arms about this video as you are now?

If it was an elderly black or Hispanic woman, would you have even left a comment? I have my doubts, but you are welcome to reply what you want and I won't read anything but the words you wrote.

When I lived in the UK, after a football match, you'd see people burning shit in the street. After the Superbowl, they were doing the same shit, but I didn't see any videos of the police tear gassing them. Instead I saw a prolonged video of five white guys tipping over someone's method of transportation and burning it.

A girl just murdered her Uber driver after stealing from a store and some how wasn't shot by the police, but a black guy gets murdered on Walmart holding a fake gun. 😐


No need to do that. At all. This is a niche scenario of homeless people acting like shit. You don't need a video for that.

If it was a homeless black woman being belittled by a gut and robbed like this, would you be up in arms about it? Or would you have gone to the next video? 

You probably don't need a video on this sub. Hit up BBC or your local news on Google.
Have a look at YouTube comments then on a fight video.

All n's that and n's that while glossing over the white folks in the same video. After a football win, you have white folks tipping over *cars.* Someone's car they use to get to work. But a blm protest merits tear gas. 

No, I am not trying to justify this at all. It is disgusting regardless of race, and you glossed over the fact a black guy came in to defend her and punch out a guy who might have knocked him out.

But ok. 👌🏾
You can't. 
Thanks for this. 

Same iPad, I used build 10A8426 and string 6.0.1
Except that one will -- It is the common model using in Macbook Pros. 
...This is how I was taught to do this in school... In 2005. ._.;;;

I thought everyone did it this way. Fuck. 
I would have broke out the hose like that person said in the comments and got him the fuck out of my yard. 

Spitting in my yard and shit. The fuck. 
It causes diarrhea. 
Tbh, I like YouTube Red + Google Play Music + YT Music. 

I pay $15/mo with a family plan for 6 people, and it works with my Google Home Mini, and my Insignia Assistant Speaker in my bathroom and excellent on my phone. 

If Google Play Music doesn't have the song, then most of the time it is on YouTube Music (YT Music) meaning I can start a playlist with the song from YouTube, and turn my phone screen off on either the YouTube app or the YT Music app.

This means music not normally a part of Apple Music or Play Music, like video game soundtracks, or music found on other streaming utilities like Tidal or Spotify. Also comes with ad-free YouTube.

I feel like I get more bang for my buck with Google, but you are free to do as you want. 
I thought everyone did this.

When I go to Chipotle, or get fast food, I take a shitload of napkins, and straws, and sugar. No reason I should buy this when it is free w/ my purchase. :\
People want fast charge, yet, don't demand for Apple to include it from the outset. *eye roll*
Tbh, that sounds about right.

Damn, you found me out.

😐 edgy motherfucker
Use cable select and skip the relationships...
Uh..  she deserved that after he tried to hit her?

I'm seeing the same video here too. He keeps coming closer to her and then attempts to hit her before she hits him.

Yea, the cane is sharp, but tf. Video mage it for self defense.
I have 0 feeling in my nipples ._.

I can pinch and squeeze and feel almost nothing. :<
I don't. 

My hair has dye in it.

If I do that, it will lose the color fast.
Tbh.

It really looks like an elevated train station in Harlem or the Bronx.

This looks 100% NYC. I'd recognize that snow proof grating anywhere.
I know lol.

They'd probably use that logic as fact and that is fucking terrifying.
Uh maybe?

I was always better at math.

I got a 770 sat math, and a 480 in reading. 😐 Fucked my SAT score entirely because I doesn't understand the main idea.

Vaccines probably caused that idk.

Oooh. Added nail bling. I like.
I got my vaccines and I got a master's of science and a bachelor's in engineering.

Fuck this bullshit.
I just filled a lawsuit against HP in small claims court for that instead.

iPhone 7 plus here.

Bluetooth gives me shit with a speaker that is right next to the phone.

I'm starting to really think about getting a new unit with a headphone jack.
Preach.

Barenecessities had the bra for $38, and I was like gimme.
Hm. 

I don't think there are any USB to NVMe adapters out there in bulk.

You may have to do this:

Use Clonezilla, Acronis or some disk imaging tool that will let you throw the image onto an external hard drive.

Install the NVMe 1 TB. 

Write the image back to the new drive.

My suggestion: Don't screw the laptop back together until you are 100% done. 

You may want to wipe the 512 GB nvme, and even if it is M key, it won't fit in a SATA based adapter.
You can't go to the MS Store and grab a copy of pro instead?
Preach.

Take this upvotes. 

Might be BPT, but it is the same keyboard warrior bs. :\
Lol.

Alcohol prep, primer lmao.

I need to go back to /r/redditlaqueristas
I tried reverse forms. I couldn't really get it around the cuticle without flooding.

I use paper forms.
I don't do that either. 

Ew. I don't know what you do with your mouth.
Pause.

How does one use the bathroom while wearing this?

Do you take the whole thing down?
My nail polish is for my fingers!!

Except, now I use gel so there is that...
...You guys are serious. 

Let's use the use "delete." Everyone knows what that means without context. 
...You like to watch yourself having sex? 

It seems like it is less about the other women, and more about you. :<

I've seen myself have sex, and I deleted the videos almost immediately. I'm just saying :<
I covered all three because I could get a piece of tape small enough where I didn't have to worry about placement because I had the coding notch for alignment. 
Wow :O

I think they got scared lol. 

When I trained some people @ BBY, they seemed ... scared of Apple customers b/c when you deprive someone of their phone, they get nasty. 
Yay! 

I am glad your issue was resolved! 

Don't be too hard on those guys during the survey. Give a 9 or a 10 otherwise it reflects badly on them :x
Drive back? Couldn't you deactivate it remotely?

And they could do it over the phone? Maybe you'll have to pay in person, but yea...
I use a drill to remove it.

I use a base coat and a mandrel with an arbor band after using a carbide bit to remove in bulk.

Edit: Regarding the Sina gel b/c my phone is being stupid. Exact same reaction -- I put it on my pinky, and I didn't even finish because my nail was burning so much. It didn't even though my skin.
Yes. I've learned not to buy what's cheap and buy the pro stuff. All the time.
My 7 is in an Otterbox Defender... 

I can't actually see the back. 
I did something similar with a 5s a long time ago:

The phone qualifies for a free display replacement under the VMI guide. :D

This is a common issue with the iPhone 6. 

https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/01/leaked-apple-document-iphone-repairs/  
I feel confused when I read what you are writing...

Did you follow a guide when you swapped the screen? 

There is no battery logic board -- there is just one logic board. 

Look at this image: https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/kagyl1qcW4AtoBlf.huge

The top screw, the bottom screw and the side screw all press into standoffs. The top and bottom go into metal screw standoffs, and the side goes into the metal housing from the phone.

The MIDDLE screw goes is the logic board. IT is not a standoff. 

Same here: https://d3nevzfk7ii3be.cloudfront.net/igi/3XQvxPR6gZtBBjeL.huge

The screw closest to the power button is a standoff, the screw furthest is not. 
YouTube Red eats my battery alive. Mind you, my battery wear is 96%. iOS 10.3.3, so I don't have the iOS 11 battery issues most people do, OR throttling. 

If I use bluetooth and YT Music, oh my god. I never had this issue on my Note5. The battery on that usually died when I fell asleep and left on the always on display. :| 

With my GSM iPhone 7+ it uses the shitty Intel modem instead of the Qualcomm one, so versus my Note5, signal is wayyy shitter. If I leave my metro area, I have to stop, remove the GSM 7+ case, remove the SIM, and insert the sim into the Note5 or the CDMA/GSM iPhone 7+ to get better signal :|

If you ARE going to get an iPhone, QUALCOMM ONLY. 

But I am so sucked into the ecosystem, I can't leave just yet. 
NO. 

I am still on an 7+ with 10.3.3. I have another 7+ with 11.2.6.

I am waiting for the last release of iOS 11, and MAYBE. 

I just think the control center looks so bad in iOS 11, and versus iOS 10, and iOS 9, the whole UI has becomes very cartoony looking. iOS lost that professional sleekness to it. :\
I didn't use it.

But yes. Their notes sometimes left out ... A lot.
Ah, no.

I was a genius -- just backroom.
Are they unlocked then? If they are in your possession, I think you would be the best person to unlock them.

I would buy this, but the T-Mobile versions won't work on Boost/Sprint. :(
And that is OK, but you have a person asking a genuine question regarding getting a phone and thinking it is going to be OK for them, esp a person switching from a phone 4 generations old. 

They are likely looking for longevity as a factor.

I would therefore, disagree with the assessment posed by /u/shenlonglobster . I think the 8 Plus would be a more optimal phone down the line.

Why: If you break the screen on the X, OLED replacements even for old Samsung phones, are expensive enough that you still want to go to Apple to get the screen replaced. You are going to be spending $250 to replace the screen AFTER the two years each time you break it, and don't want to leave it broken.

With the 8/8 Plus, your screen replacement is only $140-$180 and it is LCD so third party replacements might be more feasible. 


My question was regarding this: Your average genius knows less about the phone than you.

I am asking how do you know that? Unless you are a mind reader.

I want to point this out:

I bought an iPhone 7 Plus from T-Mobile. The phone cut my finger open. I had a retail M model. Apple took the phone, and replaced it with another M model phone, curiously enough, likely because the phone was so new.

I received it in a flat white box without the accessories. 
If you are on something like JUMP or NEXT you can pay off 50% of the balance on the phone, and grab the phone you want. 

But why leave the S8? The S8 has better signal overall, even though Android may not be your cup of tea?
And... how do you know that? 
The part comes from Apple. It is a refurb. 
It means that when they attempted to remove the battery, the tabs broke. 

It happens. It would happen at Apple too and the process would be the same, minus the waiting. You are getting a reconditioned for replacement phone from Apple -- it is perfectly normal.

Did the staff correctly position you for the repair and let you know that this might be a possibility? 
I bought a 6S Plus in April, but ended up with a 7 Plus completely by accident. I was going to use the 6S Plus for a while... 

I plan to use this phone until 2019, or until it dies. :|
...What battery connector?

The bootloop might be because you inserted a screw into a wrong hole -- did you make sure to keep the screws 100% together and reinsert them in the same order?

If you didn't, it is VERY possible that you accidentally put a screw through the logic board.

I know for the iPhone 7, you have 2x Microstix @ 1.2 mm at the top for the camera cowling (front and back), and 3x Microstix @ 1.2 mm at the bottom + one REALLY long Microstix at the bottom.

If you put that long one anywhere else -- boom. There it goes. 
Why can't the X be fine for another three years?

I still don't know why 2 years is the expected lifespan for a phone. 
Can't help yourself until you are ready to help yourself. :(
Yes
😐

Where are you going with this?
No. Just no.

I'm not a gang member so I don't use fam or cuz.

Not using lit unless we are talking about real shit, like I win the lottery.
Ir blaster and a remote app.

My LG g3 and note 4 has this, and my sisters galaxy S5 and s6 both have this.

Sadly, it is not on the S7, note 5, or later phones. :(
How about USB 3.0 on iPhones.

Every Android phone I've seen so far has this shit and it is blowing minds when I see shit transfer to my s8 hella quick and my iPhone is still here on file one.
The top section is where the wifi, bluetooth, and one antenna are held.

IT is very possible the screw for that antenna popped out of place since it is in the corner about near the power button.
Yup. https://imgur.com/a/O7P9a
Want to sell it for parts instead?
*very good*

My battery says 96% from Apple diags, and the condition is excellent.

Otterbox Defender baby. 
Sounds made up.
Maybe. But we will never know now.
...So I can have both? 

I'll take one. Thank you!
This isn't Android.

You can't connect a mouse to an iPhone... you can connect a keyboard. 
No no. I had this issue once before too. 

A friend logged into my iTunes Store with their account so I could have access to their stuff. When I swapped phones, it was asking for their password b/c I didn't have access to their content :(
People like you are the reason that the general belief that "2 years" is old for a phone. I've had this since 2016. I intend to ride or die on this bitch. 

But, at the same time, you drop $1000 on a phone, you shouldn't blink twice about protecting it.

I am getting on OP's case b/c why is (s)he trying to buy the cheapest charger instead of getting something that is quality? Why are they trying to put their $1k investment at right? 

Apparently, this makes me jelly. 
Spends $1000 on a phone. Cheaps out on the charging. 

What the fuck.
...They should be unique. 
To be honest, he probably went back there to urinate.

People in New York do that shit all the time.
No.

iOS 11 is trash. 

tbh, you can't ask for an unadulterated opinion for getting an iPhone on the iPhone subreddit. Being honest. 
Wait wait wait.

That is because of the GPU only??

My sister's computer keeps putting up that gibberish when it goes to a dos screen.
You know, it was the dead of night, and I had a question that was really killing me (I had an allergic reaction to some silicone paint I was using, and my sister's allergy pills were right there):

Is levocetirizine an antihistamine?

Google knocked that shit out of the park. Gave me a whole paragraph on the results and side effects of the drug and proper usage.

Siri, lying next to my head, tried to call my aunt (her name is Citrine.)

:|
Hngh.

I could never go to an SE sized device after having my Plus phone for so long. :(
Jokes on you: my screen is matte!
It looks like white gel underneath a color that is then filed off.

same with every race...

Exactly a month ago? eBay has a 45 day claim time.

File a claim through Paypal If you need to. 
Wait stop.

How long ago did you buy it?

Np 😉
I was agreeing with you you fool
So you have model A1660?

This phone falls under the quality program.
Maybe you just aren't lucky 😔

I've dropped my 7 plus a lot. No issues so far.
Now I feel like a fool.

Tbh, with the defender, I'll punch out the plastic, and replace it with tempered glass. Better feel, better look, additional protection. 
What is your model number?

There is a quality program for those. 
THIS ONE ATTEMPTS TO SAVE THE DATA!
Nope. 

In fact, it is better for the battery.

10 months 6s => 93% health

8 months 7+ => 96% health
Perhaps. 

I think that the alarm speaker is enough really for that.

You can access find my iphone without 2FA, just the password. 

So imagine, that someone logs into your account, and they can see you through your camera without you knowing. Even for a minute. 

You would feel offended and weirded out. 

But wait - you say! What about 2FA for this step. Well -- you don't have the phone, and some people only have a phone as their Apple device. 
Tbh, while this is great, a smart thief would turn off the phone, or cover the cameras or whatever.

Make sure you back up your phone. Always!
The scrotal defender and not those slim one's right?
Mine has been in an Otterbox Defender since July

Multiple drops, never broke a screen. Broke a screen protector, but not the screen. 

Get a real case. Not that flimsy shit you have been using if you are such a klutz.
PM me the imei and I can check the activation policy.


My old boss at apple kept doing this.

You'll be manager some day -- yeah, the fuck right. Got me a government job and left.
To be honest, probably not.

Yes you can use any Verizon sim.

Who is your present carrier? Depending on the carrier, they may request you get a new one.
You won't -- that is just to deter theft. 

Make sure that you are adamant that the first sim in is Verizon. 

The Verizon sim card needs to be the first on your put in.
I hear you on that lol.

7+ iOS 10.3.3
I'm on iPhone and I just see a box. Granted I'm still on iOS 10...
So...uh. how do I get this plan?
Giving credit where credit is due.

I like you already.
Let her wear what she wants.

You aren't her mother, or her man.

You can also close the window. 
No they will not. 

Within 1 year from date of purchase: whole unit replacement

Within 2 years from date of purchase: whole unit replacement for free

After 2 years from date of purchase: replace whole phone at the battery price.

Vintage. Not covered. 

The 5 and up are not vintage.

For wearing a bikini? Tf? 
Unlock it...
Probably less sorry and more no dead guy at casino and days old crime scene.
Jokes on them. Here comes my 6s+ with applecare.
I did this with my MacBook and my old Thinkpad.

Oh those were the days.
Haj?
Anecdotal: black female. You will get $1 at most.
Wow.

That was simply amazing. Especially when she got into it.

Shit.

This is why you don't do crack kids.
Android has had a dsp since forever :3
> I just can’t imagine him doing it.

Bihh? You just said he has trust issues. -_-
I got shit done today.

I cleaned my floors, cleaned my room, washed my clothes, sewed my clothes,  all while watching YouTube :3
Those can be had for $20 us if you actually want them

I got my iPhone 7+ for $100 back in July.

A guy sold it because it didn't turn on but didn't know it was under warranty.

I'm using the refurbished model to type this out right now. 😗
I would never do this.

Shit is a testament to my progress with thinkpads.
Yup.

Exactly. That's it right there.


Title gore.

Took three tries, and it is still bad.
I'd like to back this too.

I bought an Msi z170a pro because I got a Skylake 6700k for $150 back in 2016.

Tell me why it said it has 6 sata ports but one is blocked by the GPU? Design makers snorting that Apple crack too much eh?

Tell me why when the dos like text appears at start up it is all gibberish?


Haha... no. 
It is an overcharge.

Batteries are shipped in an overcharged state, and then brought down to 50% for storage. 

The value should stabilize after a few charges.

I always see values of 103-104% when running diagnostics on a phone that just had the battery removed. 
If it is unlocked.

Most of the time, b/c it is bad esn, it isn't unlocked.

PM me the IMEI/serial and I can check.
We need a mirror!!!
Uh... can someone explain why he is touching the mercury??

It looks like he is just wearing nitrile gloves -- it goes right through that. 

(This is not organic mercury?)
For iPhones, when they can't get a decent wifi/data backend, messages will default to SMS.

Tbh... 

Someone did that and they were honest with me. 

We had a talk, and I told them if the phone has issues after I put the real battery in, they have to pay for a whole unit replacement. 

No issues. All were happy. 
$0.99 for 3.

$1 USD paypal. 
No, don't do that. That's fucked up. 

The buyer likely did a hard reset on the phone if anything.
Tbh, my dad loves his 6. Refused my 6s+ and my 7+ offers. :\
Looks like water. 


Was there a whole 10 pages of fingers in ass?
To be fair: that is a second battery. Not really a case so it will have weight to it.
I have a 7 plus with an OtterBox.

You don't know heavy.
There are fucking terrible.

She needs to shoot her surgeon.
Bitch.

A friend she doesn't need.
Tbh... I subscribe to it.

It is insight on everything in our world today, and tbh, the accidents section has made me more cautious.

I used to run across streets like a fool because "the cars have to stop for me" or some dumb shit like that.

I almost did that shit a month ago until I saw a video where a woman was killed doing that exact same nonsense to do what: shave 5 seconds off of her commute?
Fuck that's terrifying. 

I sincerely hope that I am never in that situation. 
Can't use one example like that :\

I can do several examples for Republicans in modern times. 
Ok, but most try to push their religious agenda on people while snubbing it at home. :/
Yup.

If you had a Verizon S7, you could just flash the unlocked firmware and unlock all the bands.

But can't do that with the s5 :(
Agreed.
The fan connector isn't plugged in. I see it in one picture.

But that wouldn't cause the smoke. I've done it by accident before and no smoke, just game crashes.

But according the people: you got scammed.
The Verizon s5 is CDMA based not GSM.

It didn't have the bands att needs. The phone would work on Sprint though.
Do you use iCloud photo library? If not, photos are counted in the back up.

There is also system data in that back up + settings and what not. You can't just add up the sizes on that list and boom that's exact. My backup is 4.4 GB, and my WhatsApp is 1 GB, and none of the other stuff adds up to 3.4 GB. 
Oh my god, pay the $1 a month Apple is asking for. 

Stop being cheap. 
I see where you are coming from with that.
So, most carriers and the iPhone upgrade plan require you to just pay up 50% of the value of the phone.

If the phone price is $799 ($800) and you pay $400, then you can upgrade to a new phone -- I call that rental fee. $400 to rent a phone for a year, and then I get a new one.

*Yes, I agree!* 

You are literally dumping $400 a year or more on a new phone if you did this every year with very expensive flagship phones. 
If the camera part is in stock, they will replace the part. 
Omg no
Hmm. But he doesn't smoke.
Uh huh.
Just so you know, I'm good with the letdown.

I think you are thinking I'm just telling people to go home: I'm not, nothing harsh is going on here.

Apologize for me if you need to. 🤷🏾‍♀️
Oddly enough, my methods have led to a csat of 100% over 111 repairs for this FY alone. 🤷🏾‍♀️
Hm. It seems you are correct in regarding the VMI. 9/17 at least.

Nonetheless, if there is a counterfeit display on the phone, I avoid them. It usually points to other modifications inside of the phone, or sloppy work depending on the technician.
OK -- then you are saying the exact same thing I said. 

You can position a repair like that b/c it is exactly as you said: what is best for the customer. The scenario I mention is unusual at the retail level, but the depot does it all of the time. One time, I had to ship out a unit for a cracked screen, however, the repair failed. The customer recevied a new phone instead. Only paid for the screen, because that is what is best for the customer. No requote was issued, even though it was mentioned.

Since the screen reconnect failed as we expected, we can charge for the screen and the battery and replace whole unit and ship the old parts back to Pegatron, and stock DOA the battery part we put in. Totally legit. 
The VMI guide states you are to deny repair if there are third party modifications to the device: what is a third party modification? A fake screen. 

Someone else opened this device. I won't be responsible for their fuck ups. 

If you are taking in phones that have fake screens without properly positioning customers and letting them know that if there is a third party modification to the phone and the phone fails to turn on after a repair, then you are setting yourself up badly. 

Example: A client came in with a phone with a third party screen on an iPhone 6. Super easy. 

We notified them that the display appears to be fake, and that if the unit doesn't turn on after replacing the battery, they would be responsible for a screen replacement.

Well, guess what. When reconnecting the screen, the tech working on it noticed the connector melted on reassembly.

The customer had to pay $109 for the new screen (this was a while back) + $80 for the battery and we gave them a new unit.

If we DIDN'T properly position this client, they would have been entitled to only pay the $80 fee because we didn't tell them.

Now that batteries are only $30, I am not killing myself over trying to make some money vs following the rules. I am not taking an L for someone's fake shit. 
I am a part time employee there. 

I was previously employed there (full time), but then my workload started to not match my pay: other employees would dump off of their more complex repairs on me (screen, receiver, batteries), and while they handled the paperwork, I wouldn't see too many people, and so I left. :\ Plus I got a much higher paying job in my city. Can't beat a government job. 

My experience as a customer was mixed. My phone was damaged during repair, which isn't a problem b/c I always have a backup, it took a week for the replacement to come b/c the phone is no longer in mass production... but when it came it was on iOS 9.3.2 yaaas >:D (6s+, 64gb)

However, now that I am part time and I've learned more, I will say this -- if you have fake parts on the iPhone, I will deny repair, or in writing let you know that if I remove the battery and those fake parts become an issue, you will be responsible for paying for the fake parts or you can go. 

Fake screen, not going to touch.
Bent, cracked, deep scratches (only 6s, 7, 8, and X), and otherwise damaged = go home.

I also demand that you perform a backup before I start work, or I will write client declined a back up. 

Then you need to turn find my iPhone off, and it is all good. 
Agree with your edit. 

But yea, my location (an NY location) doesn't have 6+ in stock b/c NYers are boujee af. We only stock for warranty what we sell :\
No. 

It isn't at technician discretion. The part isn't being manufactured any more. 

I just replaced two 6 Pluses with the touch screen issue with a 6S Plus because that is why the system told me to do. The 6S Plus is still in manufacture and is still for sale. 

I even had to replace a 6 Plus under warranty with a 6S Plus :|
Not the case anymore 
Tbh... until March, Apple replaces with 6s+.
> charge it overnight

This is it,
Again. 

This battery replacement isn't going to change your life. 

I disagree with the customer service person's assessment, but you can do what you want to.
I actually received a 6 replacement almost 2 years ago with a wear pattern on the back. 

They didn't swap it, but that is possibly b/c it was just cosmetic issues, but they did give me a written extended warranty of 180 days instead of 90 days. 
I've got almost 50 at my location o.o

(I should mention, I am in a location that is a big city. If you live in the middle of nowhere, then stock will be low...)
Ok, except I am going to guess like most people that the S7 has bluetooth on. 

:|
The iPhone 6, and 6S batteries are 100% in stock. 

The 6 Plus is in low stock, and the 6S Plus is in shaky stock. 

My location recently got a single 6 Plus battery today... which was weird. 
PM me your IMEI.

If there is a service order for a battery replacement, there should be before and after diagnostics. I can see both, and I'll let you know.

I noticed a lot of people expect this battery replacement to change their lives. I have had complaints from a few customers where the replacement was done, I show this to them, and they feel a bit suckered in by the replacement. :(

Do you know what your battery wear level was prior to the replacement? If it was between 80-85% you might see a change, but if you were (and I am guessing you are) one of the many who demanded a swap between 85%-95%, you won't see a change at all. 
My fucking goodness.

Third post about this shit.
Your username is on point.

Two months on Reddit.

Barely any history.
This is usually where I sell my iPhones. I usually am the seller, but I come prepared.

I *always* meet at a bank. High def cameras, cash withdrawal and a deposit on site, and wifi. 

When I sell the phone will be iCloud locked until we finish chatting and I reset it in front of you using the store wifi. 

You can't set up an iPhone without a SIM card, and if the phone is unlocked I will come with a Verizon SIM card. 

I set it back up to go to the menu with the buyer watching, we exchange money, and then I can deposit it right in the bank and we part ways I don't need to worry about being robbed. 

Some buyers will come with the imei24 site in hand to check for activation lock:
https://imei24.com/check/iphone_icloud/

or blacklisting: 
www.swappa.com/esn or www.ting.com/byod 

And because I am an honest seller, I'll hand over the IMEI then. :3

This is the correct answer. 

When I do battery replacements and I find loose screws, they usually come from the home button.
The screws that hold in the backplate for the SE are approximately 1.6 mm. With repeated presses, they tend to fall out. 

The crunch you are hearing is the button bottoming out against the device glass. 

You may have to ask someone to open the phone and tighten or replace that screw. I just did the same thing today for someone with a missing screw on the home button backplate. 
I traded in a Galaxy S7 for a GSM iPhone 7 Plus. 

So much regret. 

Should have stuck with the S8. 
I'm having this issue too... but I always chalked it up to my shitty carrier. 
No problem. 

So long as you know :D
Replied. 
And you've never been in a relationship. :|
PM me the IMEI so I can look up the past history of the phone if she ever took it to Apple.

Might have some weird shit wrong with it. Also make sure the room mate resets it right in front of you and sets it back up on wifi with out an Apple ID.
Eh...it used to be $80.

Now it is the cost of the display replacement -_-
Not true at all. 
Oh, girl, it is so slow you can actually touch it. 

Some people use a nail file, but I already had a Dremel with a flex shaft, so it was the same thing :D

Builder gel comes off with acetone, but if you pile it high it will stay on forever. I file it down b/c the heat tends to warm up the gel enough that you can just peel it right off of the natural nail, or get it thin enough that you can soak what's left off. 
I use a file to remove it. Dremel @ 5k rpms, and sanding band.

I generally just use builder gel for my toes, and remove every month when it is time to clip.
Hmm.

I am using cheap ass born pretty chrome powder and only gel.

Born pretty gel base coat, cure (don't wipe), two layers of black cure, don't wipe in between, no wipe top coat, cure.

Then I do the powder. Then finish with another top coat. No yellowing.
My MacBook pro sits in a closet now. $1200 in the trash basically. Heat issues that caused kernel panics within less than a year of ownership. Logic board replaced three times under Applecare.

I got nasty and told them to cut me a check for all my money back because the laptop was shit, or replace it. Apparently it was easier to give me back my money. 🤷‍♀️ 

I get better features from a computer that only cost me $500 with a three year warranty including accidental.

2-in-1, touchscreen, pen, mechanical keyboard, no fucking stupid dock. I hate that dock with a passion. Also, Windows. (Why did I ever leave you?)
Honestly, I got my 7 plus cheap.

I like the iPhone because it is pretty fast and kind of generally supported by mainstream apps. 

I worked for Apple, so I kind of had to just the device then. Now, I don't, but it is a great daily driver until I get a note 8. Just not looking forward to spending that kind of bread now.
Same in NYC.

Except when your train is stuck in the fucking tunnel. :|
Not just women.

Men too. Saw my cousin beat the shit out of a man for having sex with his wife.

They are still together. I don't talk to either of them. They seem to live for the drama.
Yup. Cheaper to simply source NAND flash (not hard drive) from the same source and introduce a new minimum size. 
Ooops o_o
It is seriously addictive.

I don't want to work with acrylic either, but gel manis are just so fast -- what is drying time -- that I have started to move away from standard polish <3
I have to. 

I still have an Android phone I use daily (Note5), that I am planning to upgrade to a Note8. 

While my iPhone 7 Plus is my daily driver, the Note is what I use when I actually have to real work done (and also take notes :D).

I have a folder with an image of a man crawling and drooling as the Google Apps folder, because I am slave to that ecosystem.

In that folder, I have Google Translate since my job has me talking to some people who don't speak English and it is easier. 

Google Drive because that is where Google Photos stores stuff, and I need to access photos from my Drive (like my store loyalty rewards cards I took screenshots of from Samsung Pay).

Google Authenticator because 2FA is normal now, even though I use the Google App for the prompt to hit yes or no instead and I can use my Note5 for that too. 

Google Maps because Apple Maps is trash and led me to a locked building. 

YouTube and Google Play Music because I pay for YouTube Red and I think Apple Music is trash. If I have an Android device, and I have bought into the Google Home/Assistant ecosystem , here is no good reason I should ever pay for Apple Music. Plus it comes with YouTube Music so even if the artist didn't release the song on Play Music, they definitely did on YouTube, and I can hear it from there. 

Google Calender because I like the quick view of the week. 

Google Voice since I have a secondary phone number on the phone that I use for calling and texting people I don't want to have my real number.

Play Books since it is better than iBooks and allows me to upload my content to Drive and select from it there. 

Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides because everyone can access those for collabs unlike Pages, Numbers, and ~~Present~~ Keynote. 

Google Rewards for that cash money for tracking my ass. 

All of this syncs up to my Android phone for a seamless experience. 


I would note this regarding the PC part: I pay for the extra space in iCloud -- $12/yr, can't beat that. I use iCloud for Windows to auto-copy pictures to my computer until they can make their way to my 1 TB OneDrive ($70yr for Office 365) and my Google Photos.
Got the design tutorial from Suzie's nail career education channel.

This is all 100% gel polish.

Bought from born pretty on eBay, but the builder feel is from gellen on Amazon.

Powder is also from eBay. Unicorn purple powder on the first hand, and lg-08 on the other. Chrome tips.

I love gel polish.

Hmm. That explains why Jaquen Hqar's actor did his fingers like that when talking to Arya for the first time.

Interesting.
What? /u/12ManyBeers don't listen to this guy.

If you bring up the battery, they can do a multi tier repair and kill two birds with one stone.
Nice. 
Eh. My boobies.

Mine are uh.. big. So I have a larger cupped bra. 

Makes for extra pockets in a pinch.
Mine fit a plus-sized phone. 

Not a great place to keep it in the summer though D:

I can say the same thing about my Lenovo thinkpad...

😐

Eight years and one tea spill later.

My sister spilled grape juice in her thinkpad years ago. All that happened was the keys were made sticky. No damage to the laptop or otherwise.

(Can't really say the same for modern thinkpads, but I think you get the picture.)
Up it to $280 and I've got an iPhone 6s gold 64gb that was used in boost Mobile. 

Carrier unlocked.

I'm in NYC.
Ms, and only chocolate chip.

Oatmeal cookies give me indigestion :(

(Oddly enough.. Oatmeal doesn't?)
To be honest, I would slap a case on that bitch and use it until something REALLY happened to the phone and then do the $99 replacement.

Remember that you only get TWO incidents TOTAL.
Tbh. I switched from a 6S to a 6S+. 

It was a good switch :D
ipsw.me disagrees with your statements :|
Lmao.

Chopped up and laid out on the side of van cortlandt baby. 😝
Nah girl.

A crazy man came up to me today and started talking to me about Korea, and the Korean war.

I told him to stop talking to me.

He went on to the next person. It is too early for that shit.
Uh, tbh if you want to make the tape super long for an easy grab in the event it falls off during a drive swap you can do that too.

Remember you just need a 4 mm wide strip, and the tape is non conducive.
I'm from New York... No is a word I use every day.
Agreed. 
Tbh, you can def get more for it
This is actually a 6s...
Ah my fault.

The controller was Danish.
No it was not
The swedish one that caused a mid air collision and then the guy shot the controller after?
Ok, but you have to count calories eventually.

Then the cookie must be optional.

Just as a goldsmith can be destitute if there is no gold.
It sounds exactly like pica.


...So now would be a good time to sell my RX 470? 


https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/7t3d8i/apple_removed_cpu_throttling_on_ios_113/dtbbrwv/
I understand very well how batteries work. Capacity is a function of voltage. 

I get it -- when the battery degrades and the lithium can no longer hold a charge, and becomes rock material, the battery resistance overall increases, and therefore even with the same current, R/I = V continues. I completely understand that.

This is my issue on how it relates to iPhones:

Throttling was never introduced before, and there weren't random shutdowns of iPhones before. You probably don't know this, but when I was working full time for Apple, there was a bulletin for random 30% shutdowns on iPhone 6's, and we were advised to replace the whole unit for in warranty devices. It was "corrected" later in an iOS release. This was before the 6s battery replacement issue, but during iOS 10.

I find it strange how despite the 5s having similar nominal voltage in that battery as all of the others that it does not qualify for the battery replacement at $29. 

There is a circuit board attached to the back of the battery cells -- how come it cannot display to the *end user* what their remaining charge is correctly, or if the battery is at the end of life?

The math for that is simple: 
If I have a degraded voltage, let's say from 3.82 V (sounds like BS) to typical end of life 3.0 V for Li-ion, and a typical 6s battery measuring at what the label says of 3.82 V and 6.55 Whr. 

Assuming 100% efficiency (n) for the battery when it is fresh and clean (in reality, it is more like 90%, but semantics), I get this: 

6.55 Wh / 1 = 6.55 Wh    

6.55 Wh / 3.82 V = 1.7146 Ah     

1.7146 Ah * 1000 mA / 1 A = 1714.6 mAH    

Which is exactly as advertised for the iPhone 6S battery -- a 1715 mAh battery. 

So when my voltage decreases, and the phone knows this, why not just reflect the capacity correctly? Obviously, battery efficiency takes a big hit, and the capacity would like it is increasing according to the math (the power (watt hour) rating will fall as well, but to what I don't know), but shouldn't the circuitry in the battery be able to relay this to the user? 

When people come to me for repairs, and they have a consumed battery, the counter is jumping around erratically. It will go from 80% to 2% right in front of my eyes.

How come it isn't reflected correctly to the user, unless there is a general manufacturing fault?

Edit: Let me clarify what I mean by capacity -- I mean the battery percentage displayed to the end user. The end user isn't going to understand what "mAh" means. 
Oh my god no. 

It is just the word "fuck."
Ill buy it.
Sure.

The other guys phone is unlocked btw. He can restore with no issue
Uh, so why not have the battery counter correctly display the battery life? 

My HTC Evo 3D would just eat the battery alive when the battery was determined to be shit. No random shutdowns even with an overclocked CPU. 

That phone was from 2010. Apple is just being lazy. 
/u/Secer 

pm me the imei or serial i can confirm activation lock, as well as the past history on the phone.

Tbh tbh tbh.

iPhones aren't bug free either. 
Fucking New York.
This is meth? Not something else?
Tbh, that's pretty shitty.

I personally have sold hundreds of phones and I always make sure that there is no iCloud, and no financial obligation. If there is, I make it known to the buyer before hand. 

For a major organization to do that is pretty shitty. 
Take your chances >_>

I have my Otterbox on my 7 Plus and I have dropped it several times with no issues :D
Instead the killed the hopes and dreams of millions.
Is it a deep scratch or a crack? 

Tbh, if it looks like a crack when they magnify it, they may deny the repair. 
Customers might say "normal wear and tear," and then you see the phone and it looks like it came out of a war zone. 

Do you have a picture?
OK, firstly mate, that's bullshit. Weasel out?

For the 6S, you have to lift up the screen and there is a ring of adhesive around it. The screen will *shatter* or the cracks will be worse if they do it and then Apple will be responsible for the damage.

The 6S battery is not backordered. Stock of that battery is very high. It is the 6, 6+, and 6S Plus that are severely back ordered. 
It means they have to follow the same rules as apple.

If you have a fake battery, they can't work on it.
Uh... the rich stay rich b/c they aren't buying the latest product every five seconds. 
...So get it from iFixIt.
If they are Apple certified, they cannot work on the unit. 
I am still on 10.3.3.

I want the features of 11.2.2, but I am currently unwilling to upgrade T_T
I am having a similar issue, except I have full range over the router controls.

I should note, I have a Philips Hue which was super easy to set up and was working in minutes with both HomeKit and Assistant. 

I have no fucking clue what is going on with this bulb. 

I have killed the 5G network on my router. Power cycled the router. I pulled out my old Android for this. Reset it so it was pure, and downloaded the app.

The app is just there like a little shit antagonizing me about "no connection." 

-_____________________________________________-

Edit: I am going to do an exchange tomorrow. If the bulb keeps giving me shit, I am just going to pay the extra $5 for an additional bulb to my Philips Hue. 
Get a computer.

It is 2018. They weigh less than paper notebooks now and cost less than that damn phone m
Sometimes you need to help yourself.

You NEED a computer to restore the iPhone if the phone has issues. Do you want Apple to fly a computer to you?

Support gave you options, and you refused the options, so what do you want them to do? 

You probably live near a Best Buy, ask someone from Geek Squad to do it. 
I returned mine when my sister looked at the phone and it opened.

>_>

My nudes will be safe.
And activation lock would greet you when you attempt to activate the phone.

Guys. I have three years at Apple. I know what I am saying.
I use OneDrive and Google Photos. 
Eh...

I got my 4TB red for $80.


I'll wait.
The keyboard is nice tbh.

I thought I would miss the classic keyboard, but no. It is sturdy. Even depresses into the computer when you told the laptop into a tablet.

It has a track point, but I uh.. don't use it. Never got the hang of it. I generally poke the screen now.
Personally, I wouldn't spend that much on a phone period.


Eh.

Carriers don't care about loyalty :(
¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

A bit strange you went through my profile, but ok.

I won't go through yours. ;)
You cannot turn off find my iPhone with a restore thru iTunes!!

It would invalidate the point of activation lock!

It is likely that find my iPhone was turned off from iCloud.
If find my iPhone is turned off it is not activation locked.

It can be restored and used by someone else.
He was murdered on tv, yes?
Ok.

Let me break it down for you.

When you go to erase contents and settings, the iPhone asks for you to confirm the erase, and then enter a password to remove find my iPhone. If you get it right, it will erase.

With me so far? Aight, boom.

Now, let's say the owner's pin was guessed or they didn't have one.

Well, now I can go to settings > passcode and just set an easy one for myself as the thief in this case.

Now I can again go to settings > [victim name] > password and security > change password > [change the password]

If I don't care about the owner's shit, I can just try straight away.

If I want their stuff, I can just go to settings > [victim name] > iCloud > turn off find my iPhone > [enter the password I just made] 

And it is off. Won't turn back on until I tell it to. Then I can extract the stuff, or look at it even and activation lock still be removed and the owner can't do a remote erase.

I have people turn off find my iPhone without erasing the phone at apple all of the time. You don't need to erase it to disable it.
Uh... Yeah.

I've never done that.

Went from AMD to Intel back to AMD and back to Intel without a reinstall. Even swapped motherboards four times and twice on the same processor.

Completely stable. Even survived an upgrade to Windows 10, and a shift to UEFI/GPT + bitlocker.

Maybe something else is wrong.
Visit your iCloud account by going to iCloud.com directly and see if the phone is still there.

If not, it has been removed.

Sorry. :(
Honestly, it is more than likely that they just want the phone.


Ok...

Feasible.

Unless they were able to get into the iPhone they lost and change the password (which you can do on the device now...) And use the new password to remove find my iPhone and reset the device.

Might be easy if the owner had no pin.
I wear acrylic nails sometimes. Coffin style. I can still do my tech job... with some help from tweezers ._.

I opened my PC to clean the fan. Big mistake. 

The cover bounced back, caught my nail in between the chassis frame and the sliding cover and snapped off my nail. Acrylic nail and a portion of the real nail.  

After screaming and bleeding, and my PC's blood sacrifice fulfilled, the fan was cleaned, and tears were shed.
Honestly, you've got to break out! 

I came from Android. 

I had a HTC Evo 3D, then an iPhone 6, a 6S + Note 5, a Note 7 + 6S (had to give it back), another Note 7 + 6S, and then a 6S Plus + Note5, and a 7 Plus + Note5.

(First phone = main phone.)

I sync both phones with the series of Google Apps on iOS, and the same e-mail is on Android.

I don't let iCloud manage anything: Contacts, Calendars, and Mail are all managed by my Google Account ONLY. Notes are in Google as well. I also don't use Safari. I use Chrome -- all my passwords are stored in Chrome, and I can use them on Android, iOS, and PC/Mac.

For photos, I use iCloud + Google Photos + OneDrive for my phones, and I can use Google Photos + OneDrive on Android so my photos are accessible everywhere.

This way, I can access all of the stuff on my iPhone, as well as all of the stuff on my Android, so I am not tied to an ecosystem.

Regarding dropping almost 1200 eur on a phone that is just faster with the same garbage iOS... I wouldn't do it. You'll be paying 600 eur a year for the phone b/c the phone will only be good for 2 years until iOS 13 cripples it. Add to that what you might have to pay for AppleCare+ and any damage you may incur. 

I'd grab a cheaper phone with a more reasonable price tag. Free yourself from the iOS ecosystem -- it isn't hard to leave. All you have to do is take the first steps. 
*never*
I should mention I am on iOS 10.3.3...

*blushes* 

Edit: Damn it. I just checked on my other phone with iOS 11. This option is there. Fuck. I'm not still not upgrading until I have to. Damn. 
Preach.

I use 20 GB. Total.
It is a common baseband issue with the phone. :\
Otterbox Defender!

OTTERBOX DEFENDER!

*OTTERBOX DEFENDER!*

(Seriously. This case is bad ass. My phone is immaculate.)
Chill. 

You came here asking for help, and /u/Phoenix_Four is trying to help. 

Have you triaged the issue like /u/Phoenix_Four said? 

I would backup and restore, and then launch without restoring the backup and see if the issue persists.

If it doesn't, and you restore the backup and the issue comes back, then you have the answer. 

You need to do these things first before you start to cite that you know everything, b/c what do you think the first they are going to do at the Apple store is? 

-_-
It's fine. 

You can use the phone. 

Honestly, the owner turned off iCloud b/c they aren't looking for it. 

Don't be so paranoid. Apple isn't going to help the police to find a lost phone, and the police have real crime to solve, like RAPE and MURDER. Not some kid who found a phone someone lost. 

If Apple refused to help the police when people were shot up in San Bernardino, they aren't going to help some nobody find a "lost" phone. 
Please use your head before you start down the path of being accusatory. 

If the owner marks it as lost, their phone number will show up on a restore if they left a message when the finder attempts to activate the phone. 

It may not show up if the phone cannot be connected to wifi because the owner changed SIM card access to another phone therefore cutting the phone's internet connection off. 


Uh. It is yours. 

No one can track the phone once iCloud is off. 

The owner probably turned it off b/c they were done looking for the phone. 

Enjoy. 
Why is this the worst? You don't own the phone yet.

If you stop paying on the phone, AT&T will blacklist b/c you ain't in nothing but a lease. 

If T-Mobile is going to pay the premium, the phone would need to paid off by them FIRST and then you can bring the phone to T-Mobile.
Tbh, tbh, tbh.

When you buy the phone, if you are buying it outright, make sure the first sim card that goes in it is a Verizon sim card. Even it is used. You never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever want to accidentally lock a phone to T-Mobile or Sprint. 

They are bullshit. 
Get the CDMA + GSM model.

You'll have a stronger Qualcomm modem inside, instead of a bum ass Intel modem. 
I can check if a repair was done.

PM? Did you get an Apple repair or you swapped in a fake battery.
...Uh. Instead of making a useless post, can I ask you to explain what you mean?
I think you need to be able to switch it *on.*

It needs to be opt-in, so that the wrong people don't activate it by accident. 
Forget the apps. 

I want the ability to upload my images over cellular via iCloud since it is always on unlike Google Photos and OneDrive where I *have* to open the app after. 
Don't.

My iPad mini 2 is slow on iOS 10 even with reduced motion and reduce transparency.

Recently, I've just put the iPad into storage. I couldn't deal with it anymore, and I just use my iPhone and my laptop in the tablet configuration. 
Eh, I have to RMA my 390.

From what I am hearing, folks are getting 1070/1080s in exchange instead.

So... Why not RMA with MSI?

(I'm actually having a genuine issue with my card, but I haven't gotten around to working on the issue.)
Oh god, I almost forgot that. Those assholes. People need to learn about this magical thing called the cloud and back ups, and that a Sim card is just a place for a phone number m

Apple sends you this email telling you to back up your stuff before you come in.

Please tell me why, even after an email and a checklist, people come in, and fail to do this and then complain about the wait time even though they didn't do the simplest things?

Or say: do I really need to?
Nice bf.
...Do you transcribe on weekends :o
There is no attendant on the NYC subway system.

You swipe, then you go in. No swipe, no go.

She's just high.
Tbh, I see you have an iPhone X. 

I'd get the battery replaced, and put the 7 in storage @ 50% charge. 
I currently work at Apple (part-time) after having worked for them for a good period of time.

I decided to make some extra money while this whole battery shit was going down.

When I deny a phone for repair (because fake screens, damaged units, bent units, broken lighting ports... the works), I get "I can do it myself, just tell me how to do it."

If I have to tell you how to do it, you can't do it.


Ugh. My dad sent me a video of a guy using an RF meter to measure radiation. 

I had to politely correct my father and mention that the murder radiation is detected with a Geiger counter. 
Sounds like a consumed battery.

I've seen consumed batteries do an erratic percentage shift.
OK, but your initial comment made it sound like you knew this was the case, but that you don't even use all of the space, and that it doesn't matter anyways. 
Yea... you just contradicted yourself in the same sentence.
Ew. 
You will have to pay for it. 

It won't be replaced under the warranty unless it hits the 80% wear mark UNDER the warranty. 
Don't be lazy.

I gave up my Thinkpad T60p for a Yoga 20FY.

It was a good change. Touchscreen, ink screen, USB 3.0, an internal GPU that I could play video games on.

The T60p put me through college. $150 off of eBay, spilled water in it within a few days of ownership. Opened it up, cleaned it out, good as new.

Lasted until I traded it in to get the 20FY, and - three year protection plan from Best buy because I don't trust it to be water resistant like the other thinkpads.

26 and J.

Saggy at, but they are mine and I love them.
Does the imei on the back of the phone match the info in settings?
Office 365.

$70/yr
Uh. PM me the serial. That's really odd. I ordered a 6s+ for someone and it came with 9.3.2, and another one came with 10.1.1. 

I can check if the unit is a refurb.

Also, when you go to Settings > General > About > Model Number

If it starts with M it is a retail unit. If it starts with N it is a refurb unit. 
/r/appleswap 
Hell yes.

I pay $12/yr for 50 GB, and do a backup to iTunes whenever I can. 

I constantly see messages here from people "oh, I lost all my pictures."

*Never going to happen to me.*
I've got 1 TB of OneDrive, Google Photos, and 50 GB iCloud Photos. I'm not playing.

I don't have Apple Music, I have Google Play Music + YouTube Red, so my local music is managed through iTunes. As are my ringtones. 
And the fact they have dodged paying taxes in the US for years...
Uh... can't you just copy the songs off of the Android phone, and copy them to iTunes and sync with the iPhone?
Mine became a freenas + Plex server.

Houses my security camera recordings, my PC backups on a raid, and a hard drive for Plex.
Common baseband chip error. 

You'll need someone to reflow the chip, or buy a new phone.
Hell. Yes.

I still use an Android phone, so I have to if I want the phones to sync. 

I no longer have a Mac, so the Google Apps being on both iOS and PC make it easy. 
"issues."

You dropped it.

You caused those issues.
Uh. 

I'll beg to differ on parts of your statement, but not now.

You can't power on an iPhone that had no battery. It will just boot loop. You can with Android.
Good point...
This is what happens when you make the battery part of the circuit.

Android phones would just eat the battery alive.

iPhones will just randomly shut down instead of doing the right thing.


Please leave.
The Ivalice games are the best in my opinion.

FF12 is game of thrones meets final fantasy. My favorite.
Uh... Xii (12) is in ivalice.

Ivalice has a whole set of different races. All ivalice games do. Fran the Viera is playable.
Tbh, that is not an issue in have experienced with 4 phones. But I've also never owned a 5s so :<
Are you sure it wasn't a bad battery lot? 


Total power? 

Is this a reference to something?
He could have just waited for the b train and just walked through it.

I think this is 145th on the a b c and d...
What can I say?

Usually, I say go to an AASP and ask them to "break" the tabs, and order you a new phone, but most AASPs probably have no consignment stock of the iPhone 6 batteries. 

Look, I'm telling you straight. Don't like it? Can't help you. 
A manager did this at a restaurant to me and a group.

His breath was hot. I mean my neck snapped back.
I've never used it.

I  have always had access to Apple diagnostics.
So, what I do is I leave the phone on the charger even after it gets to 100%, and I'll leave it there until I need to remove it.

Currently I am at 98% wear on 88 cycles with my 7 Plus after owning it for 6 months (refurb from Apple; 3 months with no use 50% storage charge.)

My old 6s plus is at 98% with 108 cycles after 4 months of usage. 

And my 6s is at 93% with 196 cycles after 8 months so I must be doing something right...

I have no earlier data b/c the 6 I had before was sold :|

Can I ask when you started the full discharge and recharge?

Remember, the graphic is log. You can be at 95% @ 203 and drop off really quickly too. Do you know where on the passed graph you were? 

PM me your serial -- I can see details (iffffffffffffff you want to!)
I find that it does.

I'll see people who come in for a battery replacement with a consumed battery at 300 cycles. When you ask about their use, they follow the belief that you must completely discharge the battery before recharging.

Then you meet people who have a battery nearing consumption with over 800 cycles. They charge when the battery is at ~50-60% and don't let it die throughout the day.

I've probably done over 100 battery replacements, and it tends to follow that logic. 

Personally, I can say this: I have an iPhone 6S I used for approximately 9 months -- it was at 93.9% wear after 196 charges. I never let the phone die down to 10% unless it was dire. I can expect by my behavior, that at another 200 charges, I would be 87% (wear graph is logarithmic, not linear.)
Kidneys too. 
Yea.. no. 

Apple positioned same unit repairs usually. 

It would be $29 for the battery, $80 for the camera, $80 for the receiver, and $80 for the speaker. 

Enjoy?
This is what happens when you get those bum ass replacements.

They take the circuit chips from dead batteries and "repurpose them."

Why didn't you just go to Apple for the $29 replacement even if you had to wait? 
Lmao wat
It is a 6s in a smaller body. Not a budget phone. 😐
...Exactly.

I hated hearing people at Apple that while using the phone the battery drained. 

*Well, no shit.* 
It isn't a budget phone -- it is a small form factor phone. Tf. 
Hmm hmm. Feasible.
I like this idea.
You are right.
Good.

I would have done it for free but the end is well
Never
I'm still waiting for mine T_T

I got two replacement 6s+ recently. 

One came with iOS 9.3.2 and the other 10.1.1. 
Wouldn't that just be New Vegas...?
Precisely. 

You can change the flash chip, and so you have to bring over everything else as well.

For cellular devices, you more than just a serial swap. 
That would be helpful.

I can at least see the repair chain.
Uh, to be honest, it is not. 

So, when you swap the NAND, you need to bring over the BT MAC, Wifi MAC, serial and IMEI, otherwise the new NAND will be incompatible w/ the upper and lower CPU, baseband, and EEPROM.

The guide given to employees on matching configuration uses the last 4 letters of the serial for comparison. 

For example, if your serial said "G5MG," the employee should expect an iPhone 6 64GB in gray that is the A1549/multi-mode version.

If the employee sees a silver iPhone 6, the iPhone has been modified and repair should be denied. If the employee sees 128 GB, the repair should be denied. If the back says A1586, the repair should be denied. 


A better look. 

iOS 11 looks like a cartoon whereas iOS 9 had this subtle sleek to it.

That BIG text at the top is weird. Notifications didn't need "bubbles," we were ok with lines for years :|
Because they don't know better. Instead downvotes were handed out , instead of knowledge.

Not a soul in this comment thread corrected them. How is /u/Mika9931 supposed to know that it isn't an SD card if you don't correct them?
Apple wouldn't touch a phone with unauthorized modifications on it, so idk why they took it. 

They would have invalidated the warranty, and told /u/psychsnvibes to leave. 
PM me the IMEI. 

I can tell you the activation policy. 
Honestly, what doesn't make sense to me is this:

When I worked at Apple, if the phone had any modifications, it was ineligible for repair OR replacement.

So if it was modified from 16 to 32, Apple wouldn't touch it. However, they took it from you, so something weird is up, and I would start making moves.

You might be able to find the old IMEI by going to Settings > Your Name at the top > Scroll down to the list of devices and find the deivce.

If you've ever backed up that iPhone to a computer, you can go to iTunes > Preferences > Devices > hover over the device in question -- IMEI and serial will appear. 

PM me the NEW imei. If they properly connected the new IMEI to the old IMEI I should see it in the repair chain.
PM me the imei from your old phone, and your new phone.

It is very likely it was modified, or you are being lied to.
There is NO SD Card in an iPhone.

I am weirded out that no one corrected you on this and just downvoted you.

The storage in an iPhone is called NAND flash.
Because people still call on this book to be considered in laws and regulations.

When you have stuff like this in there, maybe you should take a hard pass.

That is what I didn't get you not understanding.
I just said this. Did you read my post or gloss over it?

I said:

Maybe this was ok for the days of the Bible.

It has no place in today's times.

Can you read that first? Danke.
Really?

I have to explain this?

If you have issues with your child today, you call family services and face y them removed from your home and placed into a group home.

You don't kill them. If you do that is murder, and you should be punished for it.
The mods need to ban you from this sub. 

Get the fuck out of here.
Sorry
Uh. Maybe that was ok for the days of the Bible.

It certainly has no place in today's time.
Putting someone in prison because they didn't follow the terms of their probation isn't.

Find a way to stay clean and turn you try to stay out of prison.

Because some people need to go to prison to get clean.
I wish people at my job understood this.

When you finish soldering your masterpiece, turn the fucking iron off.
Dead cells.

Consumed lithium ion that can no longer hold a charge are considered inert, like rocks.

Thru no longer react to hold a charge.
I... Did work at apple...

Then I quit because I hate retail.

But then I decided to reach out to my manager for a part time position since he knows I'm hot fire at battery replacements. Over 1000 repairs and 93% diagnostic compliance. 

So I'm back until I decide to leave again.

But yes. You would have a battery replacement positioned to you the moment you told me that.
Sounds consumed.

Exact behavior of a battery with a lot of rock material.
Note 7?
Android phones can power on without the battery, but iPhones cannot.

Remove the battery in an iPhone and it will never pass the Apple logo at boot.

I think that is why Android phones don't have this issue: they omit the battery from the circuit, and can bypass it entirely.
No.

I work part time at my old Apple location.

They needed help, and I needed money, so I reached out to my old manager.

I'm talking one single location though.
Yeesh. 

I went through 20 in a week.

Good luck.
iOS 9 was fabulous. 😭
If that were the case, honestly, every iPhone 5 and under should have been hacked by this.
I agree.

This is not gore, this is normal use. 
He specifically stated that everyone takes the side of the little lady in this sort of dispute.

😐
Why do you think it is was ridiculous being given two years in prison? 

All you had to do was not violate your probation. I swear to god. 
Can it charge as well?
Go thru Amazon first.

Chargeback if it doesn't go through. 
What phone are you using...?
Ugh hngh. 

Hopefully, this does not happen to mine >_>
While I sympathize with you, I don't think you should ever try to say:

My sexual assault was worse than yours, and that is what this feels like. Especially when you didn't go to the police and make that clear that this wasn't someone touching you knee, it was rape.

Sexual assault is sexual assault. From a touch, to comprising positions, to outright rape. It makes the victim feel shame, and helpless. 


Yaaaaaas
It screams bioware
"Instagram model"
I hate the Apple store in Grand Central Station.

I went for a battery problem *months* ago where the speaker wasn't working and the phone kept shutting off with a battery trap. 

The rep concentrated on the speaker, and then dismissed my battery issues entirely. I had a much better experience at SoHo. 
bad bot

what is the point of this shit
I like you. 


So a reflow.
My idea on this battery thing is this:

Android phones bypass the battery in the circuit. Remove the battery in most Android phones, and they will still power on without it.

Open an Apple device, remove the battery, plug in the charger and try to start it up. It just bootloops on the Apple screen. 

Once you add the battery to the circuit as a necessary component instead of just an "optional" one, you start having issues. 
This is my notice: error -1, and baseband searching issues seem to only happen to matte/jet black iPhone 7s. 

Primarily GSM. 
Do you reflow the solder or replace the chip entirely?

/u/CEOTRAMMELL might want to know.
Sounds like a baseband issue.

By any chance, do you have a GSM iPhone 7?
You'll have to wipe it.

Can you try to do a back up to a computer?

I still don't understand how people have important photos and don't back them up.
Actuallly... yea. 

Do you have a better picture of it? It looks like the logic board is intact for the most part. 
Uh no they don't.

The phone takes on the activation policy of the phone it replaces.

Go to https://www.att.com/deviceunlock/#/ and get the device unlocked.
Hmm. It isn't unlocked.

Tbh, is it with it to you?
It's not unlocked atm, but yea. Thanks Apple and Intel.
Also, tbh, a part of me wants to say the Intel modem has shit bricks. 

I've never seen this issue on the Qualcomm iPhone 7/7+. Just the Intel ones.
Try submitting an unlock request for the phone at the att website.

Try using another sim and see if that changes anything
It was bought from att. 

Does your sim card tray match your imei?
It might.

They can claim warranty on it.

Pm me the serial also.
Can your friend find it on their card statement?
Hella fake.
Wait.

That's a real spider?
How did you pay for it?

Credit card and when did you pay for it?
Ouch.

:(

Always New York 😐
My uncle installed LED lights at his place.

Couldn't open the garage door.

So I'm like, let's try removing the light in the garage. Since you just put that there.

Removed it. Worked again.

Brand was general electric.
They can also interfere with a garage door opener.


Not really... the phone is just slow, but not unusable.
No.

She clicked it.

The thief penally restored the phone, paid someone to send a link to your friend and she thought she was logging into a legit page and it was removed.

Enough said. No one hacked anything. Just straight up phishing.
Link*
Your friend clicked the line the scammer sent and entered her username and password and the device was removed.

That is what happened. 
Sounds about right.


I like you.
Not really a PR stunt. 

I went through 5 iPhone 6 Plus batteries in a single day. 

No more are coming.
Tbh, I think gibbed is pc and 360 only m

Don't expect anything different this time.
I don't know tbh. I don't buy music.
If you paid by credit card, you can attempt to have them cover the damage.

Most have provisions for this.
Even when you go to the iTunes store app?

You'll get a refurbished phone. 

Read your warranty terms agreements. 
I ended up getting my phone replaced.

The whole shit delaminated according to them :(

Oh well. 
What if I want to hire a lawyer?

My relative has no priors, is of an age, while the other person is in and out of jail. 
It costs $20 or less to buy a new one. 

Stop being a cheap ass. 
Well, you did your girlfriend but I can just go to a porn subreddit and probably get better content.
Why would anyone pay for this with the internet
And we are all still here somehow. (Not a word on that tiny penis? Ok?)

I just didn't believe this was an actual subreddit, but here I am. Looking at trashy porn... I think.
Take it to Apple.

They will do a whole unit replacement for $29. Back up your shit. Turn off find my iPhone before you come in.

Come in with your laptop if you need to. :\
I was just being cute.

🙄😰
Lies!
I'll be honest. 

We found it while searching thru the trash for junk. We've found graphic cards, iPhones, hell, the G500 I am using is from the trash.

It was password locked via the OS, (blank username/blank password) and I guess someone else stole it and then couldn't use it and threw it away? It was in a box. 2015, 128GB, 11.6" 

All I had to do was restore the OS. She switched from the T60 to the 2015 Mac. She loves it. 
How about you just play the game? 

Please? Enjoy it for what it is, and stop looking for what it isn't. 
NYC. God I need to leave this shithole.
I couldn't get used to it.

My sister was pro at it though, but she has a Mac now 
I did.

How do I get that money back :|
It isn't my vagina.
What??

It is taxed. D:
Elomi Caitlyn?
You are correct. 

I just checked. Comes up at the normal price. 
Eh. This is somewhat mentioned in the first game and the books. 

It is stated that the Cat School of witchers are kind of failed rejects b/c they are all crazy. They were one of the first, so the experiments first started there. Most of them are just assassins now. This is from the book and the third game.

The School of the Wolf / Kaer Morhen was attacked by a mob riled up due to religion. Honestly, a bad plot device b/c if a single witcher makes a mob shit their pants, idk how a mob of peasants will. It is believed that Cats were hired to help kill the Wolves there, b/c the only survivor that was Vesemir and Wolf witchers not present during the slaughter. This is mentioned in the first game.

The second attack on Kaer Morhen was by the Salamandra. Also in the first game.

They were likely attacked and their school wiped out b/c one of their guild accepted some coins from someone who wanted to kill someone higher up, and then doomed the school to its fate. Who knows?
There are two. Hubert, and the other one sleeping in the tomb.

She has a desk appearance ticket. 

Is that a charge?
This exactly. 

Represents the modem, color, storage, and general config. 
No warranty = $30. 

IF you are under the 6s repair program: https://www.apple.com/support/iphone6s-unexpectedshutdown/

THen it is free.
The SE is valid. So is the 5s oddly enough.
Only thing I would say is low price.

The 6s is ... somewhat waterproof. It has sealed off connectors, and a seal around the screen. The lightning port is not water proof however. I would check for greening/yellowing in the lightning port. 

When I worked @ Apple, a coworker of mine dropped hers in the toilet. We opened it, no evidence of water damage.

But people tend to severely understate their water damage. 
I use the braided MODAL cables @ Best Buy. 

Never had an issue. Also spiffy.
There was an app on jailbreak that was $7.99 and useless at hot garbage that let you do this b/c it only worked with Windows XP (????)

No files here. It is just a facade. 

I keep my Android close by when I need to do the real work. 
Uh... battery serial. 

So, there are two parts for Apple batteries for each phone. One is series "1" and series "2." All of these end in a specific serial set and it is seen during diagnostics, and is also on the back of the battery.

If it doesn't match, the battery is a remfg fake, or an A grade that uses the circuit board from an OEM battery, but fails to note the serial on the back.
Unless it is less than $20. Water damage appears as intermittent failure. 
If you want, I can run diags on the phone for you.

PM me your serial and I can give you results. 
So hot, it *burns.*
No way. Don't even buy it. 
Don't mind them. I use an iPhone and a Galaxy Note5. 

If I had to throw one off of a cliff, I wouldn't think twice. Bye iPhone. 
*never*

I went from a 6, to a 6s, to a 6s Plus, to a 7 Plus. Broke the 7 Plus, and my mother was using the 6S Plus, so I went back my 6s and I was so disgusted T_T


Good to know :o
Chrome

Sorry to break the mold, but I can grab tabs from my PC/Thinkpad to my phone and back again. I no longer have a Mac... so yea.
How about in adults.

I keep touching my phone every five seconds ._.
I use Chrome b/c I no longer own a Mac, and I usually just snatch tabs that are open on my PC or the ThinkPad to my phone and vice versa. 
How tf were you able to move stuff :o
Haha...

I just exchanged mine well before this for a bunch of EasyStores that were shucked and tossed into a freenas. 

Talk about skin of your teeth :D
Why not just keep it for iCloud storage and not have to worry about paying for 101 months of 50 GB storage?
I'm on an iPhone.

Google still gives me a monthly breakdown on my activities. 
Do you have Samsung pay?
Uh there is an option in power options to set when the lids is closed, do nothing.

I use it on my laptop pretty frequently.
I'm a klutz.

I need my OtterBox. 😭
I have an Otterbox defender for the 7 Plus (same thing).

I have a back plastic film for the phone, and a front glass.

No scratches. Matte black.
Ugh. 

I miss those. 
Agreed.

It was Democratic apathy that got Trump elected.

Poor turnout unlike when Obama took office, and us thinking these people are stupid.

Don't underestimate anyone folks. 
I remember during the quality program for the 6s, we have 30 batteries to start with.

At the end of the week, we had 2. 

No replenishment came for the batteries. We had to do whole unit replacements. We started with a total of 24 WURs (48 really, but 24 for 1688 and 24 for 1633), two for each color, and size. When those ran out... well. I don't like to talk about that. 
Tbh, best buy will just replace it usually.

Thru have those in New York City.

I see it on the train every day.
Chiraq
I could do that, but idk if that is unique.

I don't want my sister seeing my porn. 😒
A New York love story
Yes, it is crap.

But, you have the option of a fingerprint reader, or a passcode.

Not face or a passcode when people have been using fingerprint readers for the past five iterations of the iPhone (5s, 6, 6s, 7, 8)

I have a twin sister, I can't use FaceID, but if I had a galaxy, I can use what is unique to me -- my fingerprint. 
Grab a USB -> Ethernet.

Problem solved... But wifi cable? SRS?
No. Take that somewhere else.

I stick with pads b/c taking out a tampon in a public place is like asking for trouble. 

It is like removing a cork. During a particularly heavy time it just went "splurt," and there was blood all over my pants :|

But, look man. Some people love the city, some people hate it. 

You didn't like it, but it doesn't make it the cesspool of the planet. It got better when you left. Buh-bye.
Press up real quick (release)
Press down real quick (release)
Hold down side button until the phone shows the iTunes logo.

It needs to be plugged into a computer w/ iTunes during this. 
Because iOS 11 is trash.

My 7 Plus will stay on iOS 10.3.3 until iOS 11 stops being trash.
Same here. 
Oh my god. *Use the phone.*
No way. 

Just spend the extra money for a newer watch + AppleCare+. 
Wait hold on.

In the defense of the employee, this is the correct procedure. If the tabs break, the phone should be replaced. 

However, the employee should have set the correct expectations to let you know that you would be without a phone b/c their location doesn't have stock parts. This would have been the correct action, and the employee requires retraining.

Also 45 mins? It takes me 15-20 mins to do the battery, and like 10 mins for the paperwork. He probably broke the tabs and was attempting to retrieve them.

However, the new phone should be sent back to the store the next day -- it doesn't sound like he did a carry-in repair, and ordered the battery whole unit replacement part. The procedure he should follow is take down handwritten confirmation from the customer, pull the battery tab, and answer the question in GSX "Was battery removal successful w/o breaking the tabs?" If he answers no, it would offer him the battery part and it would be shipped overnight. 

Also, only people with AppleCare+ get a loaner. No AppleCare+, no loaner -- you are just a customer who bought a phone, not one who bought any extra. If you are out of warranty, you don't get a loaner, you just get a replacement phone, and you have to wait for it.


Something like this happened during a class I was subbing for.

"How big are your breasts?"

Bold guy just asks this.

All I can say is "bigger than yours."

I wasn't thinking. My mouth went off faster than my brain. 

People thought it was funny, to his detriment, but I was going to ignore him before my lizard brain made me into OptionalBurn.
A better looking control center and the ability to change the text sizes.

A file manager would also be great, so I can store files on the iPhone and remove them via USB. 
No... it is for all of them. 


Oh ya.

When she was lying in bed and all you basically saw was her breasts, I was like WTF...
I get the feeling people don't understand women's clothing.

She is wearing pants and a long shirt. 

She is not wearing thigh high boots. At all. 
I'll disagree with that statement, but you are welcome to your opinion. 
T-Mobile is "Carrier Services" which is also the same thing as AppleCare+.

My AC+ bought thru Apple says "Applecare+ for 6s, 7, and 8 Plus." for my 6S+

My AC+ bought thru T-Mobile says "NY Carrier Services" b/c I live in NY b/c I bought it T-Mobile. This is the same thing as AppleCarE+
My iPhone 7 Plus still has iOS 10. If I fuck up and I have to restore, I am going to slide back to my 6s+ w/ iOS 10. 

iOS 11 is straight trash.
If you think iOS 11 look "professional," then you haven't seen iOS 9 baby. 

iOS 11 looks like a shit show. The control center looks like a hot ass mess.
This is correct... I saw the note this morning. 

I still have access to my account. I am here eating popcorn like :3
No, that is no longer the case.
Uh... I read an article in GSX that said that they removed the option to only allow battery replacement even if not consumed but at the consumer request. 
Thank you :D and you are welcome :D

Also thank /u/deelowe for the suggestion of Kapton tape :D
Uh yea. 

Buy one of these: https://www.ebay.com/itm/OEM-Waterproof-LCD-Front-Housing-Frame-Adhesive-Sticker-For-iPhone-7-and-7-Plus/192228490614?hash=item2cc1b5fd76:m:mxXQ-cCiILNtrkNAYmOmmCQ

place it around the frame, and put a book on top of it or something to press down the adhesive. If you have leakage, you have a problem, but tbh, I wouldn't trust it.

If people know what made their phone "water resistant" they wouldn't fucking bring their shit near water. 
In their defense, that is what the literature they were given at the time said to do.


Chill the fuck out.

I think it was a nasty way to get people to watch shitty videos and subscribe to a crappy channel.

In lost nothing of course, but you don't think it is duplicitous? Offer on one hand and erase all existence of the content after?
Charge the phone at 30% or higher, keep the charger in using the iPad brick until needed.


Wow same here.

Phone twins.

I had a 6s I used for year. Battery is at 93% following this method according to Apple diagnostics (I have access to that.)
That was the norm for nickel cadmium battery, let it die and then charge.

Terrible for li ion because you end up with rock material for the dead cells that you try to bring back to life.

I've had to do a battery replacement where the client had only 300 cycles because he let it die then charge. He'll be back.
🤢
It is.


"Security reasons." 

If that was the case, every device would have an update if parts are still being stocked. 
You aren't alone in this tbh.

I bought an X with the full intention of returning it. We tried FaceID at the store -- myself, my sister, and two cousins who are basically our other sisters...

My sister (twin) was able to open the phone. My cousin (not a twin) was able to open the phone. Other cousin couldn't, but it was enough for me to not even want to try to the phone anymore.
Eight!
People don't like him b/c he held a massive giveaway, and then didn't give anything out. 

He said he had a truck full of iPhones, and gave away 9? He can go to hell. I didn't enter his giveaway, but what a way to pull subs and views from people. 
Lol. Np
Dry begging has never killed anyone.

They may just replace it for the $29 price instead.
It is possible...

Just there are legit people for that. This is not one of them.

Contact Apple Support and be prepared to send an e-mail with the receipt. 

Once the receipt is verified, then activation lock will be removed. 
Use iCloud for Windows or export the photo library to JPEG. 

Also, do what iTunes says. Delete any existing back up in iTunes and do it again.
...Compete...
sorry I missed the *no-cost* part. 
But you can save all your contacts in Google, and then you have the contacts when you send an e-mail on Android or something. 


You can set that as an option. 

I don't use that option myself, b/c I have 1 TB from OneDrive, but I use it as a backup, and also so I can use Google Apps to share my photos on my Android. 
Give me the serial number on the case via a PM./

I'll give you the scoop :O
Return it !
I would have requested the client do a whole unit replacement
If I were still working there, I'd qualify that as consumed, and in the name of custy satisfaction, I'd replace it.
Huh. 

Well, if the battery is swelling, we were told to replace the unit at the battery replacement price. This is indeed confirmation that the cost of the battery replacement is $29 for the 5S !

Nice :D
Look at the nails man, the nails!
Something similar happened at my University...

Reddit doesn't care about the Christians who complain about persecution in a very safe country like the US.

Try not to roll back.

My cousin (like a sister) was raised with me and lived in WV and worked at a hospital.

She volunteered with a few people to go to the hicklands and deliver drugs to people who were severely deformed from cousin-fucking. 

Well, she got a lot of n-words tossed her way. She said that didn't phase her -- it was a how fucked up the kids were that shit. First and the last time.
Agreed.

The entire series of Google Apple + OneDrive keeps everything synced. Everything I have in iCloud I keep in Google Drive and OneDrive. I don't let iCloud handle Notes, Calendar, Contacts, or Mail.

Yes, but Apple is new to that game.

Samsung has been doing it since the s5.
I don't trust apples water resistance...

It is a thin layer of goo around the screen.
I would refuse. 

According to the VMI guide, you must have an Apple battery in there in order to receive service on the phone. 

If the battery does not have an Apple logo, it is a no go. 
I am an iPhone user... Came from a long line on Android phones. Still use Android phones when I want to be productive.

I would like to have had the option to increase performance at the risk of my battery. I did that with my HTC Evo 3D -- murdered the battery, but I got wicked performance out of that phone.

Just use a damp paper towel.

My iPhone 7 plus has never seen water.
If the phone has to be replaced instead, the device is sent off to a Depot where the phone will be refurbished.

You will be given a new phone.

If find my iPhone isn't off, the phone is as good as a paper weight. Also proves you are indeed the owner of the phone.

Turn it off at the store if you would like as well, just know how to turn it off.
Morning appointment.

T
Know your Apple ID info to turn off find my iPhone. Come in with a smile :D
Omg I meant turning off the screen.
Uh no.

I doubt it.
No. 

As a former employee, I would give you a firm no. You need to have the cracked screen fixed FIRST and then we will address the battery at the same time.

You would have to pay out of warranty pricing on the screen replacement, and out of warranty pricing on the battery. So that would be 129 + 29. 
Not doing this. 

You make an appointment and tell me the results. 

Good evening. 
I don't think plugging it in would have an effect.

I can't turn on an iPhone without a battery even when plugged in, unlike with an Android, so I think the circuit runs through the battery. 
So... why not do what the notification is telling you to do...? This isn't hard. You are capable of using reddit and you are capable of reading. 

They asking for $12 a year for 50 GB. You can also stop the photo backup to iCloud, and use a different service if you would like to instead, and just have it back up the Application Data.
Exactly. 

Customers take years off your life sometimes. 

I remember a customer came in one time with an iPhone (at Apple) for a screen replacement. 

She had backed up and reset the broken iPhone, removed Find My iPhone and everything, and she had a second iPhone restored from the back up ready to go and was already using that. She was so polite, that I just replaced the phone for her instead under her Applecare+ at the $29 price for her.

A minute later, I had a customer blame me for them not knowing how to backup their phone and being unable to recover their data after the phone was dropped into a puddle and damaged -- young man too. Like fr. -_-
I'll concede on that one. 
Listen to me.    

Your phone is your life, and if you don't backup YOUR images, YOUR contacts, YOUR messages, and what are basically YOUR memories using the two ways that Apple provides for you, then YOU take that risk. Not just for a technician -- anything can happen your your phone: theft, damage, it just stops working.    

I do an iCloud backup every day. It is $12 a year for 50 GB iCloud space. I backup to iTunes once a week. I have 2 years of OneDrive 1 TB space for my photos (and MS Office) $70/yr , and I have the free space from Google Drive for my photos as well.    

If my phone is stolen or damaged, I don't need to worry - I am protected. I'll just get a new phone, or Applecare+ my shit. If I get a battery replacement, and the tech jacks up my shit, its good -- I'm protected. No sweating. Except putting the screen protector back on... that's bollocks.     

Regarding what you said:    

No one is forcing the customer to do anything. You don't backup, you take that risk. When I was a tech, if you refused the back up, that's all on you, but I have you sign off on the repair saying you have declined to do one and understand the risks. If you refuse to sign, you will be shown the door. I can't work on your phone without that legal paperwork, and we are told what to do in the event of a customer declining.     

There is a difference between a car and a phone. You go into a car shop expecting to not have a car for a few days. There is no data on the car you need saved. A car doesn't have photos on it, or contacts, or memories that you need to keep intact. It is a car with the single operation of getting you to and from location A to location B in one piece without stalling on the highway. Your example is shit and you know it.     

Apple can get a password back for an Apple ID after waiting 3-5 days to prove it isn't someone trying to seize the account. Apple can't turn off Find My iPhone without a proof of purchase, at least at the retail chain. People have been bricking their phones for years. I can't tell you how many people bought Activation Locked devices and were saddened to know they had a paperweight, or how many people locked themselves out of their Apple ID and were unable to get a proof of purchase and didn't understand it was necessary.     

You can win an argument with a customer who is out of warranty. They have to buckle and do what Apple says in regards to getting the phone replaced -- cough up $300+ or go away. You can win an argument with a customer who came in for a battery replacement, and doesn't do a back up. All Apple is responsible for is the safe operation of the phone -- **not the data.**

You forget that the operation of the phone has NOTHING to do with the data on it. Best Buy offers hardware protection for laptops, but if you want to backup the data there is an extra fee that you don't have to pay but you run the risk of the computer returning with no data on it. And you have to sign paperwork to that effect. 
Not my problem. 

I don't even know why you bothered replying. 
Don't for a second believe that.

Servitude is not the same as getting what you want. 
Are you serious?

iCloud back up is as simple as turning off the screen (not phone!), putting on Wifi, and plugged it into the charger.

And then just make sure you have enough space in iCloud. 

Apple has documentation on this. All you have to do is make them read it. 

https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203977

Edit: turning off the screen not the phone.
Well, you've never replaced an iPhone battery before so... 

Have you never made an appointment?

It says make sure you do 1 and 2 *before* you come in. 

1. BACK UP YOUR DATA. It is YOUR data. Apple gives you two ways to back that shit up and if you aren't going to use iCloud or iTunes, if the tech damages your phone and offers to replace it and you didn't back up your shit, kick fucking rocks. 

2. Turn off Find My iPhone. GSX support will no longer let you do this without a receipt. But don't come in not knowing your Apple ID and hemming and hawing the whole damn time b/c you decided to play stupid. 
I am saying come prepared, but don't act like a piece of shit. Treat people how you want to be treated. That is life 101. 

Don't come in without doing a backup and complain about the fact that you *have* to do a backup before an employee will touch your phone. Come in with your Apple ID and password known so you aren't there trying to fiddle and turn off find my iPhone.
You think the employee wronged you? 

Don't be an entitled piece of shit. I'd rip the tabs on your phone on purpose just to watch you have to sit there and do an iCloud restore. 
BRUH.

Preach! 

I could do a replacement in 20 mins, but the fucking paperwork and serial number catching is nightmarish. Makes the whole thing take an hour.

Customers coming at you for "same day" when they are coming in at closing. *logic*
When I worked, I would replace the battery same moment if it was possible.

I would not start a replacement w/o a backup. If I messed up and I needed to replace the phone, at least we have the backup. 
People upgrade when their phones feel old.

Make peoples phone feel old. Then they upgrade.

More money for Apple.

If you told them a battery replacement makes the phone feel new, and it is only $79, why would I spend more money to upgrade when I can just replace the battery.
Google. Go to ifixit
Omg thank God I don't work at apple anymore.

Whew.

I hope you guys all back up your phones to iCloud or iTunes or bring your laptop with you, and don't give the tech a hard time.

PLEASE. WHETHER YOU GO TO AN AASP OR APPLE RETAIL JUST COME READY WITH YOUR SHIT BACKED UP AND WITH YOUR LAPTOP IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR ICLOUD.

These guys are having a hard enough time as it is. Don't make them crazy.
All shit you can buy online.
Same here...
Water damage appears as intermittent failure.
All 6S will support CDMA. At this time, every phone had the Qualcomm chip.

The A1633 will work on Verizon just fine. 

Case in point: I used the A1634 (6s Plus) which is SIM free, AT&T version on Sprint which is also a CDMA carrier.

You got a better phone that has the extra Band 30 (the only difference between the A1688 and A1633.)

The 6s+ is not marketed as waterproof, nor is it waterproof.

No one else is going to have this problem because they didn't drop their phone in water. The issue is that your dropped your not water resistant phone into *water.* 

Your battery is shot because it *got wet.* Your CPU is acting up because *it got wet.* 

If you think it is software, by all means, restore. There isn't a need to make a post for the obvious. 
Jesus Christ. 

*no they do not.*
