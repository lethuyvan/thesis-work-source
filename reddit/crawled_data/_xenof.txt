Great map with good visual and gameplay.

The circles feel a little too slow for this map. Never felt scared of the blue like I do on other maps. 

[Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKT4YCYDies&feature=youtu.be) the only glitch I encounter during my short playtime. This occured after the pre match while I was in plane. I couldn't get out of the plane. It was solved by the plane kicking me out.

 No problems so far with Airtel. Solid 15-20 mbps speeds at home and work. I usually prefer it to my broadband connection for which I'm paying through my nose. 

Call quality is somewhat bad but Telegram calls and Discord are better for friends in any case.
Calls don't use up LTE bandwidth ?

Unless you have VoLTE, call quality should not be affected by bandwidth.

Is this phone a good upgrade over a RN3 ? 
I'd love to have Spriter Pro. I really love making games and I want to start working on a 2D RPG. I find that Photoshop is not very convenient for creating pixel art and sprites. I also can't justify paying for the CC package.
Let me tell you a little bit about the concept of the game I'm trying to make. It's based on [Ramayana](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana) , an Indian epic poem. I feel that Indian culture is very under represented in games as well as other media. Even though it has a potential of being turned into very good games similar to Skyrim or Witcher.  
One of the main reasons I haven't upgraded from my 4570. 

MoBo and CPU are pricey enough. RAM prices just make it impossible. 
This could be easily fixed with predefined (static?) shadows as there isn't a day night cycle. Like they do it in CSGO maps.
Resolution was the problem mostly. Couldn't spot shit at long range. 
sudo apt-get install friends 
1080p with render distance at high , textures and AA ultra, post processing on medium and everything else very low.

Fps averages in the low 60s with occasional dips to mid 50s. 
That GTA V looks horrendous.
W = double U ?
Played it for about 60 hours on a laptop. i5 5200U and  940m GPU. 1366*768 and all settings very low. Got 30-40fps with dips down to single digits.

It was mostly fun because I always had people to play with who would spot for me, because I couldn't with my potato settings. I doubt it will be fun if you play solo.
doing that with an i5 4570 and 1050Ti

I think the auto brightness works with a different ambient light sensor which is cheaper than a camera.
Also sometimes (in gaming scenarios mostly) the monitors may be in a lit room during daytime and a dark room during a play session.

Really hate the fact they are locking some students out of buying them. But it's a really good deal!
on AMOLED Displays it hardly takes much power. Not as little as an LED for sure but still very less. 

And companies want you to check your notifications on their smartwatches if you're a few metres away.
Notification LEDs weren't that standard. It was a feature for business oriented phones. And nowadays AOD is a better solution. 
Redmi Note 3 Qualcomm version. Was the best phone performance wise in my budget at the moment and there isn't much new stuff in the more recent phones. It's just little bumps in performance. No new flagship feature sticks around like the fingerprint sensor.

Any pointers to starting to learn machine learning and CNNs ? especially the math behind it. 
I don't know what to label my beliefs as. I am not averse to religious activities as long as there is some small benefit to me.

I recite shlokas in the morning with my brother because it feels good. I'll burn incense because it smells good. I pray because it helps me keep track of my thoughts. I visit temples where I feel nice and quiet. I have read a small portion of religious texts and I try to apply whatever knowledge I gained from them. 

But I will not go to any temple that is too crowded/busy/loud. Spend exorbitant amount of money on poojas.

A physicist, an engineer and a statistician went hunting. When they saw a deer the physicist calculated the bullet drop assuming vacuum conditions. The bullet dropped 5 metres before the deer.

1. ONE messaging. Needs to be installed on all Androids and have it setup during first boot setup. Should have a desktop client(Even a chrome app is fine).

2. Work with OEMs to remove redundant apps, like HTC did. If I have play music on my phone I'd rather not have an OEM music player.


1. More ecosystem. Work with Microsoft (maybe?) to get continuum like features between Windows and Android as they are the most used OSes today.

I realise most of these are S/W features but honestly there isn't much I need hardware wise. I feel the performance offered by mid-ranges today is enough for my use. 
Unlocked my Redmi Note 3 about 6-7 months ago. The site was in chinese but I didn't need a VPN, they approve pretty quickly as compared to Sony. 
Downloaded the tool almost instantly after getting permission unlocked the bootloader instantly. Honestly don't know what you are talking about.
Are CPU temps really high right after booting up?
I am getting about 50-60 celsius on boot which goes down to 40-45 after a couple of minutes. Is that normal?
JFC, that's incredible!
TIL that's possible
I don't really think it's gonna go away. Most flagships still have it.
It's more than enough. You should be able to use that for at least a couple of years.
1. Check if your motherboard and CPU support support dual channel memory.
2. You'd only see the benefit if the RAM specs match for example the clock speeds.
3. You'd be better off getting the 10GB solution because games have started recommending 8GB as minimum already. 10GB should help you keep some other programs in memory while you play games.
Yep. As long as you're not putting in two cards or a 1080Ti you should be fine with this.
I don't think that problem occurs on every Ryzen CPU. I encountered this problem when building a Ryzen 3 rig for a friend. BSoDs and random restarts it was solved fairly easily after updates.

A quick google search would tell you that this is an actual problem.

Once again I am not saying that this will occur on every single Ryzen CPU.
It's just a thing I thought OP should know. It's quite random I guess.
I had thoroughly cleaned a couple of weeks ago and reapplied the thermal paste. I am unsure if I applied the paste correctly.

It's at 45 celsius rn though. Don't know why it was so hot.
Most things the OP described can be done in a web browser. Assuming OP wants to watch movies online and stream his music. 
Getting about 65 degree celsius on my i5 4570 while watching youtube. The computer was running for about 8 hours. Is this normal? should I reapply the thermal paste?

I'd rather suggest you to buy a chromebook for the task you've described. Windows 10 is a resource hog with all its background tasks. 
Netflix 4K /s
The 560 is a slightly low performing card priced below the 1050 Ti and matches the performance of the 1050 card. However it is not a card I'd recommend buying if you are trying to play any AAA games.

The RX 570 is the card just above 1050 Ti however its price is currently comparable to that of a 1060 3GB card which is not worth it. At that price you might as well buy the 1060 3Gb as it offers better performance.


If you are intent on buying an AMD card I'd say wait for a deal on the RX 570. Or just bite the bullet and get the 1050ti.
Just a note: Keep in mind there are a few problems with the Ryzen platform as of now. On some there are random reboots and to fix that you will have to upgrade to the latest edition of Windows 10.

If you're planning on any sort of content creation I'd say go with Ryzen if you can deal with the issue I mentioned. And even in gaming the intel and AMD chips are fairly neck and neck. 
Pretty bland without the usual date tbh.

I used to be a shill for Prime Video. But amazon's delivery has been lackluster as of late. Prime Video still offers some interesting movies especially regional but their TV show selection is poor.
Is the 1050ti a good upgrade over an R7 265 ? I was hoping to get a 1060 3GB but I don't want to break the bank. R7 470 is stupidly priced. 

I am playing at 1080p and usually don't mind playing the latest games on low-medium settings.

Also is Zotac a good brand and are there any downsides to buying the mini version of the card? I do have the space and PSU to accommodate the larger version.
Jaldi aa

Beer's on me
The R7 265 isn't on there. 

Also doesn't work that well on phone except in chrome. Not even with chrome webview inside relay for reddit.
On just get an expand/collapse all button. That would be easier.
Saturation depends on person I think. Some people like the oversaturated panels of the Samsung phones some don't .

There is an option to tweak the white balance in MIUI. And out of the 3 Mi phones I've owned none of them had a warm display. 
RN4 has a single camera. No audio DAC. No fast charging. I'd say these features make up the price difference. 
There's literally been a dozen posts about this already. 
I use a RN3 myself actually. And as far as I know MIUI 9 for Note 3 will be based on marshmallow itself(correct me if I am wrong). And sure they might introduce nougat like features even with the MM base I know they bavkported features in the past. But they don't work as intended. For example the fingerprint API in marshmallow does not work with apps in MIUI8. 

I love Xiaomi for the fact that they provide such a prolonged support but MIUI updates and Security updates are not the same as getting full Android updates 
Security updates are not the same as android updates though.
the DAC doesn't matter to most people I guess
/r/DarwinAwards 
It's non-stock peers have a single camera. 
The closest Mi phone I'd say is the Mi 5X.  And the A1 is almost 500₹ more than what the 5X is priced in China.
The Mi A1 is basically a Mi 5X with stock android. So if you want to compare cameras you can search for g5s plus and Mi 5x comparison.

Mi A1 is also an Android One device so it is bound to receive software support for at least the next 2 years. Moto was known to provide support but after Lenovo bought the company the support has been lackluster. 
It's quite random I think. Usually on Google Railwire WiFi the popup is instant. But for my college WiFi the popup can appear after 5 minutes. It 's good to have a button that manually let's you open the captive portal.
ELI5?
Would the VRAM be any issue in the future? the 3.5 GB mess up I mean. 
I am getting a second hand 970 for the price of a 1050ti. Should I got for the 970 or get a new 1050ti ? the 970 was not used for mining but is about 2.5 years old.
It was solved of its own accord.

Here's my experience since my first phoen

* Nokia 6303 = God Tier Battery Life

* Nokia 5233 = It was alright would get me till the evening at which point i would be home anyway

* Samsung Wave Y = Never really used this phone outside of making calls and taking pics (that was all you could do on Bada anyway)
 
* Samsung Galaxy Win = It was good at first wouldn't require charging till the next morning. But then I got a data plan and started charging overnight. 

* Yu Yuphoria = Again an average battery life.

* Current Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (SD)= Great battery life. Get me through a day and a half easily.

In conclusion battery life has certainly improved but as have the functions of your phone. But with tech like quick charge and bigger battery as in the RN3 I don't worry about it anymore.

My phone usually rests onto the right of my mouse. So it's easier for me to tap to wake rather than pressing the power button.

Exactly. I went through the trouble of installing a custom kernel just to get double tap to wake. It makes sense when you have fingerprint sensor on the back.
Strangely enough, I've never seen these.

When you earn about $500 per moth $52 per game is a huge amount. You can add the fact that most cards don't work with origin so you have to go and get another card (which costs some more money) just to buy games, just becomes too much of a hassle. This increases piracy.
 If they want to eliminate piracy they should offer their games at a reasonable price according to the average earning of country. And since games are virtual goods they can go pretty low on the price.

Well I don't think pricing it ~400$(excluding taxes) in India, was a good move either ( it was dumb af IMO). But well so much for hoping.
Do you have plans to build your own recording software? I know that you have the AMD Gaming evolved client. But I mean something that offers unlimited and is easy as hitting a button.

Edit: My question to Raja, will we see any more AMD products with names of Indian rivers?

well no, I found this annoying when I was going through raw footage. I wanted to separate out the 14-20 second videos I wanted to delete which were around 100-200 mb, from the ones I wanted to use which were 500+ mb.

It would be a perfect VR recording and editing station. I would also mod it using an arduino to wake up using an IR blaster and push the temps to a log file on my drive.
Thanks for the giveaway OP! All the best to everyone.
But can it run Crysis?
I've had many occasions where I was in team with a hacker but couldn't forfeit the game because he was queueing with only one other guy. It's still frustrating if the hacker is on your team, this is for that occasion:)
What if I want to play another game on that account? 
Yup this worked! But can you explain what that command does ? just curious .
I'll try this when I get back home. The WiFi works sometimes randomly, so this may be the solution. I'll let you know if you got to the answer correctly ;)
If you have the steam version you might wanna take a look at [this](http://gtaforums.com/topic/753764-steam-downgrader/) before you mod. 
THIS IS SO KEWL
Just installed Ubuntu MATE as primary OS on my laptop. I must say I am enjoying customizing my OS more than I thought I would. :)
Thanks
Can I have link to that wallpaper?
Time to win some games and chew bubble gum. And I'm all out of gum.

It's cOS not CM
They forgot RGB lighting 
How can I make sure my Num Lock is always on when I turn on my computer?
Thanks ! :)
Hey OP what's that sidebar app? 
It just pops back in an hour or so.
I really wanted to see Oreos in 4K :C
I am guessing I am the only one, but I read that as " See Oreos in 4k"
I haven't got a bad key till this day. But it's not really ethical in my opinion, it harms the devs as the keys are usually bought from a region where the local steam price is cheap. If you really want a game and have the money to buy it from official retailers like steam GOG or greenmangaming, just do it. Otherwise consider sites like G2A or Kinguin.
C'mon we were on a tight budget. Cut us some slack :P
Partly, IMO it's also because we don't have the same grammar / punctuation  rules.
At least every 12 year old wouldn't be carrying a gun on them.
We are also the first country in the world to land on mars in one attempt, in less cost than the making of movie "Interstellar". 
 Goggle's cache servers ([Google Edge](https://peering.google.com/)) is also really helpful if you access mostly oogle services.
The UI is a big annoyance . It just feels like bloat to me. Besides chrome's data saver mode and goggle's cache network in mumbai do the job just fine for me.
Absolutely hate that browser. I'd rather emulate IE9 on my mobile and use the internet that way.
[Time to deilver](http://store.steampowered.com/app/450390/)
You can check if the game has a demo on steam otherwise you can just purchase the game game and refund it if you don't like it.
Not for gaming. But if you do other stuff like video editing, 3D modelling etc. you should get an i7 or a xeon.
Here in India, there are hardly any gaming conventions. I am sure it's the case with many other countries too. 
Keep in mind you'll have trouble on newly released games as AMD releases drivers after Nvidia (usually).
IMO it's not as good as SA.
[Closest you'll get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53EVBPVJpZw&list=PL4vbGURud_HrM7ow0mNnib1p4mAhndmIP) 

A ps4 emulator is in the works(PS4 EMX. many people say it's fake. But I like to stay optimistic). But it won't be playing retail games anytime soon.
Mumbai,India.
You'll have to check the motherboard too.
Get a better CPU. IMO it will bottleneck the GPU. You could get a less fancier motherboard and a better CPU. I'd say go with Skylake and get only 16 gigs of DDR4 RAM.
If you plan to sell the GPU, you may be able to afford a 980. Your GPU is the bottleneck in the system.
This is a really nice idea for a giveaway! Even though it was claimed; I solved with curiosity!
The Nvidia logo at the end of the video makes me think, it won't run on even a FuryX
I have heard that nVidia has nerfed the 780ti via driver updates. Is that the case in AMD's side too?
They could just turn it by magic..
It could be possible that they tried and failed. Maybe they didn't want to interfere with the past so they setup circumstances, making his birth impossible. But Merope beat them and gave birth to him anyway. Just, maybe.....
It's a page from a Harry Potter book torn and folded into a boat.
The main problem for me rn is the difficulty in dual booting with Win10. I need windows to run Unity which isn't available on Linux (stable versions). It's not a thing that's hard for me to do but it's too time consuming.
42069 thanks op
Mumbai brother!
I had a 7 day down-time during the last monsoon and did not know what to do. My ISP is good enough to extend those 7 days; but I did not like being at my ISPs mercy to get something that I paid for.
Did Modi have a meeting with Gabe or something? I see other people have the full retail price even Sri Lanka.
Some parts have free shipping. Probably the ones which are stocked in India.
Hello brother!
You can also run it as a scheduled task on windows. So it will automatically update your apps.
While we are at it we could also discuss setting an acceptable contention ratio and down-time.
Hi, Thanks for the giveaway!
[this](http://www.amazon.in/Dragonwar-ELE-G9-Bluetrack-Gaming-Function/dp/B00IJ5WZAG) mouse looks very similar to the one pictured. Except for the top design.
Why don't more websites do this? It would surely reduce the server costs and will also enable faster downloads.
I get what you mean. But you can try to push both the maximum and the minimum fps simultaneously; so you could play without a noticeable drop.
I am talking about how an update from NVidia caused the framerate to drop.
It's an album from another reddit post. And this still holds true for Win10.

Like raping my physical wallet wasn't enough.
[They are not ](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=rupee+to+dollars):\(
Yeah the Brits might come back.
Over 20 "official " languages. There are way more than that in reality.
I can't stand phones with no SD card. Call me old fashioned but I like buying my storage at once and not having to pay for it every month. Also I am usually on a poop-y 3G network so cloud solutions really aren't for me.
Voodoo 5 , thanks op!
Where I live the H/W and networking jobs are handled by "IT engineers" and computer engineers write programs. Although it may vary from country to country and company to company.
Usually write/debug software.
In my experience it was horrible. I tried it during the division beta.
I don't like bugs from any dev personally. And I am not against Ubisoft either, nearly 90% of the games I played in childhood are from them. But we can't ignore the fact that they have released some not so quality content over the last few years. I would be more than happy to see a change and let Ubisoft be my favorite company again.
Why have you saved  all these links ?

I wish I could say there are  o features in Windows 10 that i like. but as a single monitor user the ability to have multiple desktop is just something I can't live without now
Yeah did the same on my laptop.  Even tho GeForce experience app was there it wasn't able to detect my GPU . I sometimes feel we are receiving the insider builds rather than the release ones. 
Ok,  I pay for 2 megabit per second and get 2 megabytes per second. 
I pay for 2mbos but get 16-20.  All hail my ISP. 
I'd love Just Cause. Thanks for the OP giveaway. 
Not really, it hardly recognizes any places near me. And as I converse mostly in limbo of a language called Hinglish it is unable to even get what I am saying. 
Yes but sometimes even he system requirements are not very informative, for example when they say " a GTX 770 or equivalent on AMD" you just can't know what it is. Also it's very difficult for older games/naming convention for example when a game says 7870 or newer, you assume that your poor r7 265 can handle the game; but the r7 is just a refreshed 7850 so it won't run the game.

In all it gets very complex due to naming conventions and different brands etc. which is too difficult for a new player IMO. I know that it's good for people to learn new stuff, that's the way I've learnt; but giving someone a a yes or no answer is much better to attract new players.
Yes, but it is not implemented into store pages; which makes it more of a developer tool than a feature. And as I said steam could also display what kind of performance to expect for current hardware using the data from similar PCs.
Hey,  I didn't know that exists. I am kind of new to reddit so pardon me. I'll be sure to post it there. 
Yes,  and this would be more of an incentive to participate in the hardware study. Gamers get better spec requirements and devs get better idea of the current hardware. 
Used to work when I had a faulty n/w card. For other issues like when my ISPs net is down it just throws random errors.
Freesync was kinda cool.....
So when's GPUworks is releasing?
Thanks dude. I tried it and it does work quite accurately, funny how google just baked it in silently.
I am running MM, and my headset does support this on iOS
It cools down better if the RAM stick is 16 Gigs
I believe it's a cup of coffee.
It would be rather better if Google allowed the devs to list individual permissions; for example even if an app only accesses your photos and videos, it also shows up as it can access your files too, it would be better if it said that the app only has access to photos.
You have to install naptime or if you already use Greenify you can sign up for their beta version to get the same feature. 

Link me : Naptime
I have set mine to kick in after 5 minutes of inactivity. I used lollipop for some time and now I can see some noticeable differences in battery life. 
If you have exposed and greenery installed. You can enroll in their beta to get a feature which turns doze on when your screen turns off. 
It's not necessary, if you stick to play store or other trusted source. It does more harm to have a Antivirus than to not have one. 
Most of them are,  it should be a standard practice that the developers should write about an out of context permission in the App Description 
On the same boat, although price is a concern. Around 600$ is my sweet spot; any suggestion?


Yeah, thanks! 
Thanks mate!
will surely join if there are beta servers in Asia.
I have no experience with MSI but I can tell you Gigabyte  cards are cool and have stable factory OC. Also Sapphire customer support sucks so I would go with the Gigabyte .
The only difference would be whether or not the card is factory overclocked and the frequency of OC. You can of course do the over clocking yourself. So you should only compare the thermal performance.
Yeah, it's mediocre at  best. But for 6₹ I am not that sad.
try searching for it yourself, not using the OPs link.
No, you buy in-game money in MW, No limits has the fuel system. IAPs are very optional in MW.
Can confirm available in India for 7.31 Rupees. [link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.games.nfs13_na&hl=en)
There should be another one, usually shows up in related apps.  
Noice, congrats m8. I can run it on ultra but on 1366*768, hope you enjoy the game. :)
a random comment, please XD
Isn't this a feature in MM ? 
tried 720p, it does not happen. I didn't know 1366*768 wasn't a perfect 16:9 ratio.
 I didn't want a smartwatch until now , now I NEED one.
I would love Talos principle.

Yes it's not in real life, but on TV I have seen this multiple times. 
Happy Cake Day!
I haven't watched this show. But let me have a guess, the girl cleaning the laptop is from a rural part of India who married into some urban family. The girl smiling may be her sister-in-law or her husband's second wife, who suggested her to clean the laptop to "impress" her husband or her mother-in-law.

The "beauty" of Indian TV is you can apply this to almost any scene where one girl is doing something and another is looking at him and smiling. /s
Had already seen that video, but the caption made me laugh so hard. XD
Closed captions cleaner ? 

Cash credit cleaner?



I am a noctua fan and I find that true, ;_;
Sometimes other traditional media companies buy the rights to broadcast a movie/Tv show exclusively in a region, and they pay huge sums for the exclusivity factor. So the content creator is not able to license the content to Netflix. Traditional media is very stuck up in some case, a good example would be Crown's Invitational from Australia, which was on Television. There were no GOTV demos of this tournaments available.

Now if the content creator does not fall for the exclusivity deal and licenses Netflix (or other streaming services) along with TV channels they would turn a huge profit as the viewership on Netflix will be huge and this will earn them more revenue in total. Which brings us to the fact that you stated, the movie industry is fucking dumb.
Thanks m8, now I can binge House MD just before my exams!
Hulu and commitment?
Yu Yutopia anyone? no ?ok..
You did at first, but now they have implemented a option where if you change your device ( or flash ROMs in my case) you have an option to reset the authenticator via a reset code sent to your email. Also you can generate some backup codes which have no expiration.
I think they will be adding content as we go, otherwise it would have taken them weeks more to launch. And I don't think servers will be able to handle large collections being uploaded and a huge number of people signing up, at least I hope so. Some content like House of Cards may not be available as local channels like Zee Cafe have a contract.
High time ISPS increased the FUP limits on high speed plans, the max FUP I get is 50 gigs.

Thanks for the giveaway OP! I would love to have any of the Hitman games.

It has become so easy to provide demos via steam, you don't need disks or anything. I wonder why they don't do it.
R7 265 no problems yet, played skyrim with enb, GTA V , with the Crimson drivers max temp was 45 celsius. 
I just don't get one thing, if has enough knowledge that he thinks he could open a computer and fix it, why did he not know how to get the graphics card out?
Let's hope for the best..
Amazing! 
We have the same problems, after they converted INR. Please GabeN I just wanna buy skyrim in peace.

Having the R9 fury would make happy. I don't personally have one but I just think that if we continue to (only) support AMD, the market would be monopolise, which eventually is not good for consumers. Didn't mean anything personal.

Yeah true that, I had to buy a disk drive to use my copy of GTA V.
I'm not saying that it should be adjusted according to the country's GDP or something, I am just saying that Steam isn't always the best option, so rather than jumping on the bandwagon of buying games from Steam, try a local store sometimes.

I have yet to see any Indian CSGO server in matchmaking , they came back after two weeks just for testing purpose. I just hate Dubai servers, they are filled with hackers.
Now all they have to do is

* Add debit card support

* Maybe even netbanking support

* Reasonable pricing

* Indian servers for CS:GO( They have been offline for months)

And I'll be a happy panda!

Alle Hagel PCMR!
I'm not just here to bash on it you know. I would be happy to listen to what your view is.
These are not assumption, mate. These are experiences I've had. Yes one out of ten families may opt for a smartphone. But from what I've seen from the time I've been to these villages for NSS camps, I've not seen the tendency that you say. I am sorry we may have been to different parts of India, but you just can't say my observations are baseless.
So 1500 per annum is more than 1500 per month ? What did you like fail maths or something ? So according to that 1500$ per annum i.e. 125$. So do you really think a person in village will buy a smartphone over jewelry and other investments? You people need to get out of cities to see the India. Sure everyone in a city will have a smartphone/mobile phone. But that is not the case in rural parts, as the mentality of them does not prioritize a phone which goes down in value over something else that increases in value.
Do you really think that a person earning 1500$ a month can save up?
I agree with your point. But I don't think not being able to help the farmers more can be outweighed by any benefits.
The cost of a smartphone includes not only the smartphone but also other needs that come (or should come ) before a smartphone such as shelter , food , education , electricity.
It was a whole another thing if everyone in India could read. It's like learning to ride a motorbike. I learnt to ride a bicycle in my childhood so I could easily learn the bike in 2 days. But my friend who didn't know how to ride a bicycle had to learn everything from how to balance the bike which took her about a month.
See the thing is, you have to literate people to at least be able to read the screen on a computer or other device, so that they can digitally obtain the book. I have seen engineers, computer engineers , who have an 'O' grade pointer ,not even being able buy a kindle book.
I have two sim cards right now and so does every member in my family and also friends. So you divide that number by 2. This also counts the connections which are not actually in use but have not been surrendered. It also counts the commercial connections. So the actual number of persons connected to the internet via this 900 mil connections might just be a fraction.
Ever been to a village ? The *gram panchayat* computer is either in the *sarphancha*'s house or in a corner eating dust.
I am saying that the people who will benefit from this are the ones who can already afford a data plan for month.
It MAY . But you know there is way to ensure there is 100% *book literacy* - just concentrate on getting *book literacy* first.
You will still get a data plan right ? Then why pay for internet again in taxes ?
Tell me how many people in villages have WiFi enabled devices. And before talking about internet literacy we should consider just plain old literacy. In my books literacy is not primary pass, it's at least metric pass.
For people to be on equal footing , they at least need to have their basic needs fulfilled. In this case the people who helped this guy were doing the job the government should be doing. Say the government had provided him with the basics such as education, shelter and food, he would've easily been able to get admitted into one of the nice engineering institution on his own, most of which provide free internet access.
It's not a "technological improvement". It's not the case that we are discovering some way ti magically transfer power over WiFi ,is it ? It's just implementation of a technology. *Mangalyaan* saw  a lot of technological improvements. Yes I know it does cost some amount of money but it also improved the technology used in defense and military.I don't se Free public WiFi doing that.
It just might be another extension of internet.org.
No , but the inclusion of these type of services is pointless. I see no benefit of this to the average Indian.
An Engineer opens a medical clinic, with a board saying "Treatment for 10$, get 100$ back if it doesn't work".

A doctor comes across this and thinks that he could make a quick buck by fooling the engineer.

He enters the clinic, says " Doctor, my tongue is not feeling well, I can't taste" .  Engineer tells the nurse to get medicine #322. After drinking it Doctor yells " But this is petrol". " Ah your tastebuds seem to be working again" engineer says. The Doctor pays the engineer and leaves.

The next day the doctor comes back and complains that his memory is faulty. Engineer tells the nurse to " Bring medicine #322". The doctor yells " but this is medicine for my tongue problem". "your memory has been fixed" the engineer says. Doctor pays up and leaves.

He comes back the next day with a plan fully formed in his mind. " I can't see too well " he says. The engineer sighs and says " Alas a problem I can't solve here's your money back" and he hands out a 10$ note to the doctor. the doctor says " But this is just a 10$ note, you were supposed to give me 100..." " I see that your vision is now fixed  please pay my assistant on the way out"

TL;DR Doctor Shocks Engineer Rocks (No hard feelings)
That Case :X
I don't see what kind of advertisement they'll get, Game companies usually advertise their latest games, not usually just the company.

Did the same thing as OP did because honestly I don't think it's going to the "devs" who actually made the game but some fat-bum Ubisoft executive, and they don't deserve it, they've pushed many broken games out which was later revealed as the publisher(probably the executive mentioned above) pushing the deadlines on the devs.
Can I join the club too?

Hello, I am entering for Bioshock Triple Pack. I started gaming on PC when the PS2 came out, I remember my dad getting my first PC when I asked for the PS2(i was like 4). It was a moderate build for the time with a Celeron, 120 gig storage and a whooping half gig of ram.

 I knew nothing about PC building when I got my current computer, a friend of dad's built it for us. It had no graphics card, a core i3 540, 2 gigs of RAM, 500GB HDD. As I started to learn (& earn a bit) I started tinkering with it and today it has a i5 4400, 8 Gigs of ram, a 256 Gig SSD, with that old HDD, and a R7 265. I know it's not "GLORIUS" for many, but it's the one for me. :)

I can confirm that
They are the same price IMO.

I'm waiting for sometime and saving up, so I think DDR4 will also come down in price. Also if I get skylake, would  applications like Auto-CAD and 3DSmax be  able to harness the extra 10% performance?
Never mind I decided I will save some more and get the i5 skylake.
i3 like i3 4xxx or i3 5xx?
I think they tried it with MKX but it failed.
VMWare workstation!
I would love to have a VMware license, I have to use Ubuntu for some of my classwork and it's a pain in the butt hole to recover the bootloader each time I update Ubuntu. Thanks OP!
Hello there add me GeT_LeFt :P.
It would be nice you could setup one server in Asia. I have played this  offline with bots and would love to play with my friends. 
This is pic is zoomed all the way in. I don't have my library id made yet, so I can't actually enter the books section. 
Respect brother. He sounds like a good man. May his soul rest in peace.
Not to brag but there are some cyber cafes(PC bongs as we call them) in Asia+India(IDK why they are considered different) which offer i5 3470, GTX 760( or higher) for a maximum of 1 USD per hour.

Actually I had no idea that I was supposed to install binaries for some of my hardware, like my GPU and Network card. I hadn't researched much before installing Ubuntu and then after several crashes when trying to launch some games I just gave up. It's ok now, I haven't booted into Windows once, I haven't come across any reason to yet. Maybe it's because I am not required to submit anything in any weird format but i feel that if I have to I will find a workaround.
OP gave me a much required motivation to switch to Ubuntu.I've had trouble with linux (Ubuntu Gnome) for some time now and the partition has just been sitting there. This post was like Shia LeBeouf for me and forced me to get out of my peasant mindset and try solving the problems, and it worked.Thanks!
Thanks OP!

Good luck everyone

High Five! 
Can you post a pic of your rig please?
I love the combination of white and chrome near year monitor! Anyway goodluck.
Please select a number from 1-**1000** only. :) And also what case is that?
A picture of your rig is mandatory :(
I got 39 steps, iBomber Attack, iBomber defense in a 10 key pack. Paid 5$ this games are worth 20$
This just goes to show how stupid and ill-informed our government "experts" are. I don't think they even have a clue what net neutrality means. It means to treat every network traffic equal. This is just the polar opposite of what net neutrality stands for.
Hey there OP, thanks for the giveaway, though I didn't get any key. Anyway I wanted to ask you about game development. I'm in my first year computer engineering and I do know a bit of Java and C++. Would you suggest that I learn how to program fully first and then turn to creating games or learn programming as I experiment in Games. Also how important do you think artwork is in a indie title, as I have little to no experience in designing sprites or any computer graphic in general.
Yes I wanted it too. But the tablet is priced approximately near the kindle paperwhite, which seems too good to be true even without the extra features.
Yes, but this is the case with GPUs, not the entire PC as a whole. And in this example I'm just noting the use of the term as a buzz word.
I would also like to add that Steam doesn't let me use my debit card directly, because of a security measure posed by the Reserve Bank of India, But Steam hasn't fixed it even after many complaints. On the other hand origin fixed it in about a week.
Yes, the download itself is 22 gigs while the install is 27ish. But still that is like a 25% difference, so I am still getting around 4 MBps down right?
I'm sad to say many of the alt PUGs have servers in India which have very low pings compared to valve official servers. I am ready to pay Valve say 15$ for 3-4 months in order to have good servers. 
I didn't quite get it, can you elaborate?
I tried four different servers, two in India, one singapore and one in Europe. Also I didn't run them at the same time.  Also I would say why doesn't steam give us Indian users something good? All the CSGO servers are always under high load and half of them have bad reg. Why is this national partiality done on steam and not origin?
* I have a 60 Mbps (megabit per second internet connection). 
* Both downloads were done one after the other.
* I live in India, where generally all valve servers are bad (CSGO, DoTA you name it).
* If you don't know the other reason it's the customer support.
It is the Xiaomi-mi pad. I think it has a Tegra chip too(not sure though) . Also it's very cheap; approximately 250$. 
I get it now. Yes it would be awesome to have that kind of processing power on mobile.
Thing is PC will also advance. New technologies such as new manufacturing processes are first implemented on PC then used in other applications. So I don't think tablets and mobiles will be able to compete with what is considered a modern PC at a given time.

PS: A tablet in future maybe more powerful than today's desktop and I agree it's still a lot of processing power.
In 5 minutes :-\
It would be just a marketing gimmick, none of the laptop processors have power to compare with the desktop forget mobiles and tablets. So say some dev decides he wants his game on mobile as well as PC it would hold the graphical fidelity on the PC version back. One could build the pc version and then port it to android but hardly any dev would do that. Because it's easier to create low res assets and then upscaling them rather trying to optimize a game meant to be played on a good PC for a underpowered mobile. 

**TL:DR It would hold PC Gaming back**
I'd say Life is Strange, if you're into adventure games.
I use malwarebyte and windows defender in real time protection mode. I don't do much web browsing on my windows desktop anyway, so it's kinda hard to get a virus or malware. And in case I someone recommends some software that I am interested in , say like obs, I cross check it with alternativeto.net and download from the software's website only.
Just upgrade, then.
I have purchase 2 games and countless wallet codes still had no problems.

I'll go for books, I think we live in a age where literature is at it's best. And it's also improved by the many types of mediums we have to consume it. A story can be easily made available as a hardcover, e-book or even audiobooks. Sure many good  books get made into a big budget movie. But the movie is abridged. Even if you have multi-million dollar budgets for visuals, in my opinion it can't be compared to building up a scene line by line, word by word as only a book can do.
Still better than xbox's kinect. RIP.
Indeed, and also fucking hard. I completed it 3 times but never without killing.
Aww man I thought I'd get bad rats.

I would love to get Grand Theft Auto 5
I have great memories from this franchise, it was something me and my cousin bonded over. We used to mod the GTA 3 trilogy together. Now he has moved away and the only way we can have fun in GTA is GTA Online. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Now if I have to compare myself to any of the above it would for sure be Ted Mosby from HIMYM. (I haven't watched all 9 seasons so please guys no spoilers). 
I relate to him because of how I overthink all the stuff in my life and also my attitude of falling for a girl, like almost instantly. I can also relate to being a dork because I correct everyone. By the way you do something "by" request not "on" request. I also believe that *the one* is out their somewhere and she's coming here as fast as she can.

I also have similar friends ~~except for a Robin~~ but Robin is not from any nearby or distant foreign country. And Barney would be a little more laid back. I even have a "slutty pumpkin".

But I am not an Architect but a Civil Engineer (in making) so I would be the one working for Ted. I also currently don't have any plans on settling down.

The Marshall and Lily in my story have not been together as long as Marshall and Lily but they are the same cute couple which you can't imagine breaking up.

Like Ted I may have rushed in telling Robin that I love her but she handled it alright and we are still friends, although we don't see each other that often.

The Barney is a more towards dating 5-6 women for a week rather than having one night stands with each of them. Like Ted and Barney, we aren't that close. Yes, we go out sometimes but we are not *best friends*  and  he admits it.
I would imagine that I can relate most to him out of the show, but I loved the whole *family*.

I'd like to see some UI changes to CS:GO as well, though I am not sure about Source 2 because it might change physics as it uses a different physics engine which will affect grenade throws and player movement.

Yep, I have that problem too. Just had an insanely great game, I'll be sad if it's not saved.

I just have my friends for reference sorry if I was wrong,  all my friends have skins. I just feel that skins make steam much cleaner.  And as a player who only plays 2-3 games on steam I like that.
It's very weak. You can play some games on it in contrary to popular belief like most source based games eg CS:GO, DoTA. You wouldn't be playing any modern titles though.
Hello, first of all sorry about your friend and it's a great thing you are doing (not the giveaway; the charity event). I was a PCMR from as long as I remember so I never owned a console, but I did play one Dragonball game on my cousin's PS2. It was fun because we would beat the shit out of each other with all the cool moves like Kame Hame Ha.
Living in India I can tell as a fx 6300+mobo  and a 270x cost more than 500 USD. But still I can always sell my old parts and upgrade.

3333
Gotta save that!
I have almost the same build (different mobo) and GTA V runs 60 fps(locked) with advance graphics disabled , on a 1366x768 monitor. If you go with an Nvidia card you might get more performance.

You will need to upgrade your processor too if you want to play Witcher 3 (I mean even running it), otherwise go for a r9 280x/ GTX 970. If you upgrade your CPU,you will have to get a new Motherboard too. But IMO you should just get a GPU now and get CPU+Mobo in December, after Intel announces Skylake.
**What game systems do you own and actively play on? (This includes both modern and classic consoles)**


PC mostly, sometimes I play on my old PS3 (like two games a month, mostly my backlog of exclusives)

**What game systems do you own but only collect for? (Same as above, includes both modern and classic consoles)**

None

**How often do you actively search for accessories for either using or collecting? (Controllers, novelties, power supplies/AV)**

Once in like 6 months.

**If you do not own any consoles and are exclusively using the PC for gaming, what are consoles that you would want to own or collect for?**

I don't want any current gen consoles but I am searching for a N64

**What country do you reside in?**

India

**What are your thoughts on a Music gifting community?**

Umm..... Not sure. I would think that's it's quite easy to get music as it doesn't cost as much as any game.

I love FPS.
Well my love for FPS comes from playing counter strike for 12 years (that's like 2/3 of my life till now), And also the first game I ever played was Half-Life. I feel relaxed while playing FPS games. I like City-builders too. I love the fact that I could create anything, a city with crazy flyovers? 3 highways on top of each other? you got it.
Hey, first of all, thank you for the giveaway. I have very fun memories of me and my cousin playing GTA San Andreas on his PC. We never really played the missions we just goofed around with mods.(That's how I got into modding). I didn't play the later titles because I didn't have the PC good enough to handle them, but now that I have it, it would be nice to give it a visit once again.

Hey, it's very awesome of you!
Would you consider being a candidate for the next PCMR lord?

Also get a upgrade now or wait for Skylake?
http://steamcommunity.com/id/XenofRPs

Civ 5 would be nice.
So I am considering upgrading my whole system in like 3-4 months. Should I still buy DDR3 for my current system?
So should I get a 280 or 960 now?
Here are two reasons behind my answer 

1. The Pentium is a unlocked and the i7 is not, so it will give you more performance (in gaming FPS, theoretically)

2. You get a free copy of witcher 3.

3. JK the i7 is already obsolete(with the arrival of 5960x) so you will have to eventually buy a new CPU anyway.

Edit: Formatting
Go with the pentium route, you can update the CPU later. Graphics card is the most important thing in a gaming PC. But still just my opinion.
Thank you!
What about the heat output? Will the Maxwell in 750ti help reduce it ? It's a small build..
Nope, cinematic is 24fps!
The Minimum requirement is 500W so you should be fine using the adapters.
Thanks m8.
Most PSU don't have 6pin connectors. You will be just fine using the molex to 6-pin adapter.
Edit: Also check if your psu has enough wattage for the graphics card
In my case I don't have an international debit card. So I buy the steam gift cardswhich are the only ones available in my country.
Those variables though........XD
Should Have read your comment first......

So you have a limited steam account. In order to have some social features such as ability to add friends, you have to have a unlimited account. To do so you need to have a purchased a game/dlc on steam. 
Note: Games keys bought from other sites like G2A don't count.
Have you bought any game from steam?
I am new to this subreddit so I haven't seen you. It's a great job you are doing. Thank You.

Yes it will work. No hardware manufacturer puts a limitation on their hardware according to branding. You just have to match up the ports or sockets... 
Get the Sims 4 it's a bit more polished. 
That's exactly what I love! :p
I wish they will just be like " We're sorry guys, we're adding back all your favourite feature from Sims 3 to Sims 4 like open world.....". It will just make my day. And will also piss off the pirates who don't get updates..
Honestly, IMO both are identical performance-wise. But Sims 3 can justify it because it has a Open World w/o loading screens.
Are you talking about sims 4 or sims3?
So personally I think you should buy the GPU, with the other parts, unless you have a very good reason to buy it now (like I am not able to play GTA V with my current graphics card). Because the prices are always fluctuating and mostly going down. So if you want to get the most out of your money get all the parts at once...
Getting a new rig later this year..... :3
Just want to get this for GTA V
And what about the 265?
i3 540@ 3.1 GHz
I said my CPU would bottleneck the GPU, not vice versa.
I could but anything above this will be bottlenecked by my CPU...
The Cities : Skylines Review was the one which stood out to me the most. Personally I share the same opinion, Cities Skylines is what I hoped Simcity 5 to be. And Dota 2 review was also kinda funny.
I would like to have GTA V, but if that is already taken I would be happy to get Cities: Skylines.
P.S. : Your reviews are kinda awesome and of a different tone than most other curators, I hope you continue this work.
Thank you, I was actually using GPUBoss, for deciding my   next GPU.  
Have you played the community map Dust2 night, if yes, what do you think about it, would you like to see it in the competitive map pool?
I switched to Chromium(I know it's almost the same thins), it uses about 60-70% less ram. Chrome would use around 250MB when idling, Chromium uses about 80-90MB with a youtube video and a Facebook tab open!
