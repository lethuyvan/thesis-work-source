Well flask doesn't handle CLI stuff at all, so you could include the CLI stuff in your flask app, but flask will still only handle the web part of things.

I did something similar and ended up with 3 packages:

- myapp-core
- myapp-cli
- myapp-web

myapp-core handled all the business logic and contained the ORM models that were shared across the web package and cli package.

myapp-web is a flask app that basically just does view handling and imports stuff from myapp-core.

myapp-core is a CLI app that handles cli processing and imports stuff from myapp-core.

This works great, but there's no reason you couldn't just put all your CLI code in the same package as your flask app.

This is the exact use-case for hybrid properties.

    from sqlalchemy.ext.hybrid import hybrid_property

    class Post(Base):
        __tablename__ = 'posts'

        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
        upvotes = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
        downvotes = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
        age = Column(Integer, nullable=False)
        importance = Column(Integer, nullable=False)

        @hybrid_property
        def hotness(self):
            return (self.upvotes - self.downvotes) * self.age / self.importance

Then you can just do this:

    Post.query.order_by(Post.hotness.desc())

And you can access the property on instances as well:

    post = Post.query.first()
    post.hotness

No need for extra update queries.

Neat. I didn’t know watches could slow time down. 
Sure he would. He already has a toaster. Why would he steal another one?
The problem is that he's using recursion and never extends the current filelist when he calls `find_file` recursively.

Imagine a directory structure like this:

    folder/
        file1.jpg
        subfolder/
            file2.jpg

Here's a working example of OP's find_file using a global variable:

    filelist = []

    def find_file(folder):
        global filelist
        for filename in os.listdir(folder):
            fullpath = os.path.join(folder, filename)
            if os.path.isfile(fullpath) and '.jpg' in fullpath:
                filelist.append(fullpath)
            if os.path.isdir(fullpath):
                find_file(fullpath)

This works just fine and filelist will end up with:

    ['folder/file1.jpg', 'folder/subfolder/file2.jpg']

If we move filelist to a local variable:

    def find_file(folder):
        filelist = []
        for filename in os.listdir(folder):
            fullpath = os.path.join(folder, filename)
            if os.path.isfile(fullpath) and '.jpg' in fullpath:
                filelist.append(fullpath)
            if os.path.isdir(fullpath):
                find_file(fullpath)

Now when this runs, filelist will only contain this:

    ['folder/file1.jpg']

Yes it did recurse into the subdirectory, but the output was basically discarded since the sub-call to find_file has its own filelist and does not do anything with it.

The better solution is to return the value each time and extend the parent's filelist with the result of the call to find_file:

    def find_file(folder):
        filelist = []
        for filename in os.listdir(folder):
            fullpath = os.path.join(folder, filename)
            if os.path.isfile(fullpath) and '.jpg' in fullpath:
                filelist.append(fullpath)
            if os.path.isdir(fullpath):
                filelist.extend(find_file(fullpath))
        return filelist

    print(find_file('test'))

This works properly and does not use global variables.

Event better though, I'd probably use a generator:

    def find_file(folder):
        for filename in os.listdir(folder):
            fullpath = os.path.join(folder, filename)
            if os.path.isfile(fullpath) and '.jpg' in fullpath:
                yield fullpath
            if os.path.isdir(fullpath):
                yield from find_file(fullpath)

    print(list(find_file('test')))
Wonder what this will do for Boost? I've used them for the past 3 years. Hope the coverage just gets better with not too much increase in price.
Well the traditional way is to check for presence of a "distribution file".

For example, if `/etc/redhat-release` exists, then you're on RedHat.

There is a package called `getos` that does this. It also maintains a list of which file should be present for which distribution:

https://github.com/retrohacker/getos/blob/master/os.json

If you only want to check for specific distributions, it shouldn't be that hard to do it manually:

    var fs = require('fs')

    function callback(error, file) {
      if (error) {
        console.log("file does not exist");
      }
      // file exists
    }

    fs.readFile("/etc/redhat-release", callback);

Makes sense. Just thought I’d share.

It was named by Sir Humphry Davy and he was a bit indecisive. First spelling it alumium (this was in 1807) then changing it to aluminum, and finally settling on aluminium in 1812.

The spelling in –um continued in occasional use in Britain for a while, though that in –ium soon predominated.

In the USA, the position was more complicated. Noah Webster’s Dictionary of 1828 has only aluminum, though the standard spelling among US chemists throughout most of the nineteenth century was aluminium.

It’s getting removed from the JDK and spun off as a separate package. That allows it to develop at its own (maybe faster) pace rather than being tied to JDK version.

Yeah it's kind of a bummer. It works when you define things in the same HTML file, but it doesn't go through any external scripts.

So it must wait for awesome person to create an extension.
So you have files included with a script like this?

    <script src="app.js"></script>
    <script src="another.js"></script>

And then you want to write some more code like this in your html file?

    <script>
        someFunction();
    </script>

And be able to jump to definition of someFunction if it was defined in one of the script files?

I don't think that's possible. There might be an extension to do it but I'm not aware of it.

You can jump from javascript file to javascript file (provided you have a [jsconfig.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig) file set up properly). But from HTML to javascript I'm not sure is possible.


All the packages listed in `packages=` in `setup.py` get created in `site-packages`

Which for your project, this:

    packages=find_packages(exclude=['tests']),

Gets translated to this:

    packages=['shotcharts', 'retrieval', 'utils']

So all 3 of those get created in `site-packages`

You can nest it if you want by putting `retrieval` and `utils` under `shotcharts`.

If you want it nested under `nba_shotcharts` then your directory structure should look something like this:

    nba_shotcharts [main repository named whatever you want]
        setup.py
        nba_shotcharts [python package]
            __init__.py
            shotchart.py
            utils
                __init__.py
            retriever
                __init__.py

Then your `find_packages(exclude=['tests'])` would get expanded to this:

    ['nba_shotcharts', 'nba_shotcharts.utils', 'nba_shotcharts.retriever']

And you'd use it like this:

    from nba_shotcharts import shotchart
    from nba_shotcharts.utils import something
    from nba_shotcharts.retriever import api_retriever
Weird. That looks right. I used your setup.py and the github repo linked. I was able to install your package successfully using `pip install .` I'm also using Python 3.

It created the `shotcharts` package in `site-packages`:

And I could import it successfully.

Type hints are crucial if you want to use the new [data classes](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0557/) in 3.7.

    @dataclass
    class Inventory:
        name: str
        unit_price: float

    item = Inventory("Python Book", 34.99)
Either of those commands should work. If you do a `pip install .` then it should create a `package_name-version.dist-info` folder as well as install `package_name`.

It's possible that your package isn't set up correctly so it's not actually installing the package. Sounds like this is probably the case since you're not able to import the package after installing it.

What does your `setup.py` look like?
You probably want to return `redirect(redirect_url())` instead of `redirect(url_for(redirect_url()))`

The way you have it now is going to try to call `url_for('http://localhost:5000/')` when `request.referrer` is set which won't work.

Yes, Word documents are actually compressed archives. Try opening a `.docx` one in a zip utility and you can see all the different files inside.

`document.xml` inside the zip file is what actually contains the text of the document. So you could look at that if you wanted, but it has a lot of extra metadata still, since it's an XML document.
Word documents are actually compressed archives, so the reason that it's smaller than the text you entered is because it's compressing it.

So given two documents with 100,000 characters each and nothing else, the sizes of the documents could be very different depending on what characters are in the document (how often word/phrases are repeated) and how Word is able to compress them.

Sweet! Let me know if you need anything else.
This might be a little long but bear with me...

Let's assume you have a directory structure that looks like this:

    setup.py
    README.md
    vite/
        __init__.py
        vite.py
        cli.py

This directory structure allows you to make a pip-installble package. You would need to create setup.py to look like this (at a minimum):

    from setuptools import setup

    setup(
        name='vite',
        version='1.0.0
        description='vite static site generator',
        packages='vite',
        entry_points={
            'console_scripts': [
                'vite-cli = vite.cli:main',
            ]
        },
    )

Now from within your directory containing setup.py, you can do `pip install -e .` to install your package.

The `-e` flag means that it's editable so it will automatically pickup any changes as you make them and you don't need to re-install.

The `packages='vite'` parameter tells setuptools to install the 'vite' package which has `vite.py` and `cli.py` under it. Now you can do `from vite import vite` in python no matter what directory you're in.

The `entry_points` parameter tells setuptools to automatically create executables with the given names. In this case it will create a `vite-cli` executable that runs the `main()` method in `vite/cli.py`.

That `main()` method can basically replace what you have in make.py.  You could assume that the user is always going to run `vite-cli` from the project home directory, which would be `os.getcwd()` in python, and you can build your paths from there.

Something like this in `vite\cli.py`:

    from vite import vite

    def main():
        # assuming the only thing this does is generate html
        # really you should put your argument parsing here to dispatch the correct logic

        project_dir = os.getcwd()
        pages_path = os.path.join(project_dir, 'pages')
        build_path = os.path.join(project_dir, 'build')
        
        vite.generate_html(pages_path, build_path)

>How would I go about doing that? Again, given my current method of doing things, where will make.py fetch those functions from? Correct me if I'm wrong, but looking at that code you've written, are you implying a globally installed Vite module?

Exactly, yeah. Vite gets installed once, then your entry point calls into that.

`make.py` can call methods like `vite.markdown_render(filename)`. Instead of  markdown\_render\(\) taking a relative path and concateing with PAGES\_PATH it should accept a fully qualified path.

`make.py` should know where the PAGES\_PATH is, then pass that along with the filename to markdown\_render\(\).

Basically for project specific stuff, it should happen in `make.py` and `vite.py` should know how to operate on ANY project given the correct paths/parameters.
You can also

I can't wait for the day when someone invents a way to take horizontal video.
Looks like a good start. Some feedback:

1. You should make it pip\-installable. Then you don't have to worry about "Don't delete the cloned repo, since make.py" since you could have it create an entry script automatically.
2. Avoid star imports like from `huepy import *`. Just import the names you need.
3. Move all the argument parsing logic under `if __name__ == "__main__"`. The purpose of having that section is so someone can run your script like `python` `vite.py` and also import it using `import vite` then call `vite.create_project()`  The import doesn't work right now since you have argument parsing logic runs when vite is imported and causes python interpreter to exit.
4. I would probably try and move a lot of the logic out of make.py and into another common package. Then in make.py you can call functions like `vite.project.jinja_render(project_path)` or something like that. Basically I like to keep the entry scripts as fairly "dumb" entry points that just do some argument parsing and call into a library that has everything organized. This makes it more re\-usable.
They were introduced as part of the language in 3.5 because of PEP 484

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/

However, the types are not checked at runtime. They are only for development purposes and require your IDE or a package like mypy to check them and report the errors.

Non-static inner classes contain a reference to the instance of the enclosing class. I think depending on this this is used it could potentially slow things down and prevent the JVM from garbage collecting certain instances.

Anyway, if you don't need access to the non-public fields and methods on the enclosing instance, then there's really no reason to use an inner class (or at least a non-static one).

If you post code samples it would be easier to pinpoint exactly what is causing the slowness in one example.

If you’re running all environments from your local computer, changing the database url is the way to go. Do not keep multiple copies of migration files. 

If you update your app config to read database url from an environment variable, it would let you do something like this:

    export DATABASE_URL=whatever
    flask db upgrade

Then it will run against the right database. 
What environments are you referring to? Like development and production?

You should run the database migrations when you deploy your code to the environment as part of the deployment process. It won't make sense to run the database migrations against production if the corresponding code changes are not deployed on production.

1. Write your database migrations and run them against development to make sure it works.
2. Deploy your code to \[environment\]
3. Run database migrations against \[environment\]

flask\-migrate picks up your database information from your app config, so as long as you have the database configured correctly for the flask environment, you shouldn't need to do anything other than `flask db upgrade` in each environment.

Go to File \> Other Settings \> Default Settings and set "Project bytecode version" to "Same as language level"

Go to File \> Other Settings \> Default Project Structure and change "Project SDK" to an installed SDK

Apparently my default Project SDK was set to an older version of 1.8 that I no longer have installed, so it was defaulting back to 1.5 whenever I created a new project.

u/Philboyd_Studge not sure if you have the same problem, but that fixed it for me.
That's what I do. Then I also need to...

1. Right click on the project, go to Module Settings, change "Module SDK" from 1.5 to 1.8
2. Go to Preferences \> Compiler \> Java Compiler, change "Project bytecode version" and "Target bytecode version" to 1.8

Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but those never get updated automatically even after changing my pom.
First thing is that you need to put your `drop` variable inside the loop so that each dropdown has its own list of selections.

Next, if you track the dropdown values in a dictionary that is an instance variable, you can then access them at any time.

Here's an updated `StockCheck` class. I added all the string variables to `self.options` using the same key that you have in your `stock` dictionary. Then I added a button that will print the values of `self.options` when you click on it, just as an example. Really you could do whatever you want with the output.

    class StockCheck(tk.Frame):
    
        def __init__(self, parent, controller):
            tk.Frame.__init__(self, parent)
            label = tk.Label(self, text='Stock check', font=LARGE_FONT).grid(row=0, column=1)
    
            self.options = {}
    
            n = 1
            for key, value in stock.items():
                self.options[key] = tk.StringVar(self)
                self.options[key].set("select") # default value
    
                tk.Label(self, text=stock[key]['unit'], font=LARGE_FONT).grid(row=n, column=0)
                tk.OptionMenu(self, self.options[key], *count).grid(row=n, column=1)
    
                n += 1
    
            tk.Button(self, text="Show Values", command=self.print_values).grid(row=n, column=1)
    
        def print_values(self):
            for key, value in self.options.items():
                print(key, '=', value.get())

If you want to try Django, I recommend going through the official tutorial. It's very thorough and easy to follow.

It talks about setting up models \(relational database\) and getting everything working.

[https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/intro/tutorial01/)

Once you understand that, you'll need to get your project to work serving data \- and not HTML \- so that your app can consume it.

Django REST Framework is a popular choice for that.

After the Django tutorial, you could check out DRF and it should make more sense.

[https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/beginners\-guide\-to\-the\-django\-rest\-framework\-\-cms\-19786](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/beginners-guide-to-the-django-rest-framework--cms-19786)

Honestly that seems like a bug based on the documentation.

But to work around it, I might do something like this. I converted the result to dict since I usually want a dictionary anyway.

    vars = {'one': 'one thing'}
    
    data = dict(config.items('SectionOne', vars=vars))
    
    for key in vars:
        data.pop(key)

But if you don't want the dict, you could just do this:

    data = config.items('SectionOne', vars=vars)
    
    data = [item for item in data if item[0] not in vars]

Edit: I just submitted this issue: https://bugs.python.org/issue33251

Here's what you need to do...

First you need to set `emmet.extensionsPath` to a directory. In this directory you will need to create `snippets.json` file.

This file could look like this:

    {
      "html": {
        "snippets": {
          "!": "html>body"
        }
      }
    }

That will change the `!` expansion to `<html><body></body></html>`

If you want to insert literal text, surround it with `{}` like this:

    "!": "html>{example text}"

That will expand `!`  to `<html>example text</html>`

You can also use `${1}` to insert cursor position after expansion.

Whenever you change the snippets.json file you will need to reload vscode.

I'm not sure where they are located on your filesystem when vscode is installed, but all the default HTML snippets are here:

[https://github.com/emmetio/snippets/blob/master/html.json](https://github.com/emmetio/snippets/blob/master/html.json)

Hope that helps
Python basically copies a reference to the closure variables to the function so they are available after the outer scope  returns. That keeps them available in memory.

You can see this by using `inspect.getclosurevariables`.

    >>> foursided = make_test_dice(4,1,2)
    Index1:  2
    
    >>> inspect.getclosurevars(foursided)
    ClosureVars(nonlocals={'index': 2, 'outcomes': (4, 1, 2)})
    
    >>> foursided()
    Index2:  0
    4
    
    >>> inspect.getclosurevars(foursided)
    ClosureVars(nonlocals={'index': 0, 'outcomes': (4, 1, 2)})

So it knows that when you refer to `index` that it's a closure variable, and not a local variable or any other kind of variable. Notice that it also knew that `outcomes` is a closure variable, even though you didn't explicitly tell it so with `nonlocal`.

No.

The way flask-login works is that on each request, it calls whatever function you have registered as `login_manager.user_loader` and passes the `user_id` that should be returned. 

It should return None if the user ID is not valid. For example, you could have something like this:

    class User(UserMixin):
        def __init__(self, id):
            self.id = id

    @login_manager.user_loader 
    def load_user(user_id): 
        return User(id=user_id)

That will simply create a new user instance on each request without connecting to any database.

The only requirement is that the object that is returned MUST have all these methods and attributes:

https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#your-user-class

And that's all that `UserMixin` does - provides default implementations of those attributes/methods.
flask\-login requires that your user object has certain attributes.

For example, it exepects to be able to call `current_user.is_active` to check if the user is active.

So now you need to add that to your user class:

    class User():
    
        @property
        def is_active(self):
            return True

It expects to be able to call `current_user.get_id()` to get the ID of the current user as a string. So add that to your class:

    class User():
    
        @property
        def is_active(self):
            return True
    
        def get_id(self):
            return str(self.id)

There are a couple more attributes like that as well. So `UserMixin` provides default implementations of these methods and attributes so you don't need to do it all yourself. Just inherit from the UserMixin class.

    class User(UserMixin):
        pass

You can see everything it implements here:

[https://flask\-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\_modules/flask\_login/mixins.html#UserMixin](https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/flask_login/mixins.html#UserMixin)

Again, you don't have to use it. But if you don't, you'll need to implement all those attribtues and methods yourself.
Don't feel bad at all! This is definitely one of those "how hard could it be?" problems where it turns out the answer is "very".

Check out this StackOverflow answer. It contains an implementation of an equation parser, built on top of the pyparsing library \(which is built to allow you to parse strings into a grammar\).

Use [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)

    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

    text1 = soup.find(id='slim1').attrs['label']
    text2 = soup.find(id='slim1').text
For a simple solution, you could use `ast.literal_eval()` function. It can parse math expressions:

    import ast
    ast.literal_eval('1 + 2 / 4')

Parsing a string like that manually is actually incredibly difficult for anything beyond simple cases.

You would need to loop through the string that the user entered, try to figure out if the current character is a number, space, operation, or some other possibly invalid character. Then you need to calculate the answer, taking into account order of operations (if you want).

If you want to go the second option... you'd need to put your `input()` calls in a loop and store them in a list as the user enters them. This is potentially easier. You can accept a number and an operation in each loop. Verify the operation is valid (based on a list you have created). Then calculate the answer based on the numbers and operations you have stored.

It can still be tricky if you want to follow order of operations. Should this:

    Enter number: 1
    Enter operation: +
    Enter number: 2
    Enter operation: /
    Enter number: 4

be evaluated as (1 + 2) / 4 or 1 + (2 / 4)?
You definitely don't need something like redis. The multiprocessing module has the ability to share variables with the process that spawned the process.

Return the value from your looop function, then "results" would be the list of results from pool.starmap.

Here's a working example:

    import itertools
    import multiprocessing
    
    list1 = list(range(0, 1+1))
    list2 = list(range(0, 1+1))
    
    x_fromlist1 = []
    
    def looop(x,y):
        localvar = x
        return localvar
    
    def multi():
        global x_fromlist1
        with multiprocessing.Pool() as pool:
            x_fromlist1 = pool.starmap(looop, itertools.product(list1, list2, repeat=1))
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        multi()
        print(x_fromlist1, "global variable")

Which gives you the results of all 4 calls to loooop:

    [0, 0, 1, 1] global variable
There are many directions you could go depending on how the calculator should operate.

Do you want the user to input a full equation like this:

    1 + 2 / 4

Or do you want to prompt for each individual input like this:

    Enter number: 1
    Enter operation: +
    Enter number: 2
    Enter operation: /
    Enter number: 4
This is actually kinda cool.

In your "view all receipes" route, is there a reason you're building a list the way you are?

https://github.com/O2-AC/recipes/blob/e05ef28d80300aaa31c4211b67db51605ee27b08/application.py#L108-L115

I suspect you could just do `db.session.query(Recipe)` to get a list of all the recipes, since that seems like what you're trying to do.

On this line, you seem to be referencing `ingredient` variable, but that variable is not defined.

https://github.com/O2-AC/recipes/blob/master/application.py#L53

Also the fact that you're doing `db.session.expire` in an "add recipe" view tips me off that there might be a better way to do what you're trying to do. You probably don't need to expire the recipe. Just find it by name like you're doing, then update it if it already exists.

It just pisses me off because golang is a fairly new language. It’s not like it’s been around for 30 years and they bolted on dependency management when github became popular. It was designed that way. 

It’s a fun language but the dependency management really turns me off. They could have made dependency management beautiful by learning from other languages, but nope.

Is your criticism really with vscode or with golang? Installing from github like that is how dependency management works in golang. 

It's horrible.

Install directly from github with no version pinning. I can't believe the designers of a language in 2009 thought that was a good idea.

Getting rid of the ÷ symbol and using parens clears it right up.
Ideally you should be offloading this type of filtering and joining to the database. This is exactly the type of thing that SQL is very good at. I'd strongly avoid adding attributes about orders to the products.

For example, to get a list of all products:

    select * from products

To get a list of products where current stock is less than minimum stock:

    select * from products where current_stock < minimum_stock

Now you want to get a list of products that have orders that are not received. I'm not sure what your actual table layout looks like, but something like this should give you an idea:

    select *
    from products
    join orders on orders.product_id = products.id
    where orders.received = false

This is only 1 query. There are no extra queries and no filtering you need to do in Java.

Basically I think that doing all the heavy lifting in Java is not a good idea if you can avoid it. Let the database do what it's good at.

You can use Hibernate to set up the associations (if you haven't already) and use HQL to query the associations.

https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.3/reference/en-US/html/queryhql.html

And this is a class variable and an instance variable:


    class Cont:
        pos = Point()

            self.pos = Point()

flake8 is just a wrapper for pyflakes, mccabe, and pycodestyle. None of those tools have the ability to detect unavailable imports.

pylint can detect unavaialble imports. For this it uses your PYTHONPATH. So you'd have to find a way to set that.

You can set this using the command line, like so:

    PYTHONPATH=/path/to/foo pylint

Or using the option `--init-hook` to append to sys.path:

    pylint --init-hook="import sys; sys.path.append('/path/to/foo')"

And `/path/to/foo` should be your site-packages from your virtualenv, plus any other paths to other places you have packages installed that you want to check.

TO get the same option in vscode, you probably have to do something like this:

    "python.linting.pylintArgs": [
        "--init-hook=\"import sys; sys.path.append('/path/to/foo')\""
    ]

Honestly though, why not just install pylint or flake8 in your virtualenv? Saves so much trouble.
The admin interface sucks for generic foreign keys. There's no way to use the built-in autocomplete with it. There are third party components you could look into.

Honestly I'd probably have a foreign key to both Building and Property and get rid of the generic foreign key.

Then make sure that one of the two fields is provided in the model:

    class TenancyDocument(models.Model):
        building = models.ForeignKey(Building, ondelete='CASCADE', null=True, blank=True)
        prop = models.ForeignKey(Property, ondelete='CASCADE', null=True, blank=True)

        def clean(self):
            if not self.building and not self.prop:
                raise ValidationError('Must provide either building or property.')
            if self.building and self.prop:
                raise ValidationError('Select building or property, but not both.')
            super().clean()

Then you could autocomplete on both `building` and `prop`. 

You could customize the admin template if you want to simplify selecting one or the other.

edit: If you really want, you could even add a database constraint to ensure one of the two fields is not null.
It's definitely possible. I do this sometimes. Just set the path to your python executable and linter executable in the specific virtualenv.

My relevant settings look like this:

    "python.pythonPath": "/Users/boxidea/.virtualenvs/main-env/bin/python",
    "python.linting.flake8Path": "/Users/boxidea/.virtualenvs/linter-env/bin/flake8",


If you use pylint instead of flake8, then set `python.linting.pylintPath` instead.

Oh right, cause it's returning `RequestHandler<BaseResponse<UserType>>` and not `UserType` directly.

But sounds like you got it... you need to cast from User1 or User2 to UserType.

> I thought higher of Swift tbh...

What would you expect it to do? Automatically cast to a different type? That would be very bad.

I would probably get rid of User1 and User2 and just use UserType. Then have builder methods or helper methods to build an instance from either backend. That gets rid of your type casting issues. Doesn't sound like you're actually using User1 and User2 as separate types, so you're just making it harder on yourself.
You will need to create a `UserType` object from your `User1` object in your function and return that.

Or you could probably cast it to UserType

    return r as UserType

It probably better to copy the default class variable to the instance upon instantiation.

    class Email:
        is_sent = False

        def __init__(self):
            self.is_sent = Email.is_sent

        def send_email(self):
            self.is_sent = True

Yup, just leave that out. Then all the template compilation happens in the build step (through vue-loader) and you don't need to include the complier at runtime.
If you update your main.js file to do this: 
    
    new Vue({ router, store, render: (h) => h(App) }).$mount('#app')

instead of this:

    new Vue({
      el: '#app',
      router,
      store,
      template: '<App/>',
      components: { App }
    })

You can switch to using the runtime build of Vue. The runtime build is 30% smaller and will run a bit faster since it doesn't need to parse template strings at runtime.

Just think of all the [Guy Fieri pictures](https://medium.com/friendship-dot-js/i-peeked-into-my-node-modules-directory-and-you-wont-believe-what-happened-next-b89f63d21558)!
Remember that this:

    <test v-model="something" />

Is just syntactic sugar for this:

    <test :value="something" @input="value => { something = value }">

So by creating the component programmatically, then checking the result of `$on('input')`, you are essentially making sure that v-model works. Actually testing using v-model seems kind of redundant to me.

vue-test-utils does have some nifty little helpers that we use. Check this out (to test the example we've been discussing):

    import { mount } from 'vue-test-utils'

    const data = {value: 'value***'}
    const wrapper = mount(TestComponent, { propsData: data })

    # test that 'input' was emitted and check the value
    expect(wrapper.emitted().input[0]).toEqual(['value changed'])

The formula for your grade is this:

x = percent on assignment 1

y = percent on assignment 2

z = percent on assignment 3

`g = (10 * x) + (40 * y) + (50 * z)`

Fill in what you know so far (x and y) and simplify:

`g = (10 * (73/100)) + (40 * (60/100)) + (50 * z)`

`g = 31.3 + 50 * z`

Now you know you want your final grade to be at least 67:

`67 = 31.3 + 50 * z`

So solve for z:

(subtract 31.3 from each side, then divide each side by 50)

 `35.7 / 50 = z`

`z = 0.714` or `71.4/100`
> How do we split up the numbers so everyone is even?

Your question is a little confusing.Really not sure what you mean by that or what you're trying to do.

You say these are the amounts paid:

Roommate A: $1822 

Roommate B: $1755 

Roommate C: $1599 

Roommate D: $1457

Now what? What does that mean? Do you want to add some amounts to these? Is Roomate B's $50 on top of the $1755? 


> geo-coordinates, you really must use a db like Elastic or mongo which has that functionality builtin

Most popular relational databases have geospatial functionality built-in, or easily available as a plugin.
I'm not sure I'd do it this way.

v-model is handled by the template compiler, so when you instantiate it manually, you don't get the two way binding. This is what you found out. v-model is a function of USING the component, not defining the component.

But, I don't think it really matters.

If you're testing a component that looks like this:

    Vue.component('test', {
        template: `<div>test. value: {{ value }}, prop2: {{ prop2 }}</div>`,
        props: ['value', 'prop2'],
        mounted: function() {
            var self = this;
            setTimeout(function() {
                self.$emit('input', 'value changed');
            }, 500);
        }
    })

What do you actually want to test? You don't need to test that `v-model` works when using this component. You need to test that the correct value is displayed, and that `$emit('input')` is called with the correct value.

It's up to the PARENT component to re-set the value of `value` and trigger the re-render of the test component. This is what v-model does. But to test this component, you don't need to care about that.

You could test USING this component in a parent:

    Vue.component('parent', {
        template: `<div>test: <test v-model="somevalue" /></div>`,
        data {
            somevalue: "a test",
        }
    })

And in that case it would make sense to test the value of `somevalue` before and after the test component's `$emit('input')` is called.

Try it:

    
    from pathlib import Path
    
    class MyPath(Path):
        pass
    
    p = MyPath()

Results in `AttributeError: type object 'MyPath' has no attribute '_flavour'`

Problem is this line:

https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Lib/pathlib.py#L977

When you subclass, `cls` is not `Path` but `MyPath`. So now you've gotta re-implement `__new__` in your subclass or add `_flavour`.

Not super difficult, but kind of weird. If you implement `_flavour` as `_posix_flavour` in your custom subclass, then it won't work on windows.

That's a slightly different thing.

The "64 bits" you're talking about is the native storage size for "blocks" in the OS. This just means the OS stores its data in "blocks" of that size.

When developing, an integer uses a size to determine how many digits to hold.

Dates are typically stored as the amount of time (in seconds) since 1 January 1970. It's common to use a "signed 32-bit integer". This means it ranges from -2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647.

[1 January 1970 plus 2,147,483,647 seconds](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+January+1970+plus+2,147,483,647+seconds) is January 19, 2038. And if you add another second, it could either roll over or throw an error (depending on the programming language).

The solution is to use a 64-bit integer, which ranges from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to +9,223,372,036,854,775,807.

You could technically store a 64-bit integer on a 32-bit OS, it would just take up 2 "blocks". It might be slower when making calculations and can even be a lot more difficult to work with (again depending on the programming language).
I think the problem is that the extension is registered to work with `vue` filetype and not `vue-html` filetype.

You can test this by seeing if the completions work outside the `<template>` block. For me, they work outside the template, but not in it.

I manually updated my install of the extension to get it working.

Add the following to ` ~/.vscode/extensions/thekalinga.bootstrap4-vscode-3.0.0/package.json` in the `snippets` section.

    {
        "language": "vue-html",
        "path": "./snippets.json"

Not 100% true. You can't do any tricks to get around the rule... like flicking it up with your foot and heading it your own keeper intentionally. You can get booked for this whether or not the keeper touches the ball.

I had a 2011 MINI. One morning it wouldn't start. Towed to the dealer and basically *everything* was wrong with it.

Something happened to the DME if I recall and basically knocked out all the other electrical systems. Had to send the DME back to Germany to diagnose and ended up having to replace the alternator, navigation system, and even the gas pedal. It was at the dealer for 2 months. This was the 3rd time I had to tow it to the dealer. I sold it after that.

This was fun: https://i.imgur.com/RTC8k8E.jpg

Good thing MINIs come with free towing and free loaner. You're gonna need it.

Once you know about another node/peer, you can exchange the blockchain with it, and ask it about the nodes it knows. Then it creates a chain and continue propagating when new nodes are added.

So you do need to know how to connect to at least one other node manually to start, and hope that node knows about other nodes.

Bitcoin has a hardcoded list of "seed" nodes to connect to:

In general it's not a good idea to explicitly check against booleans like `while won == False:` unless you have a good reason for doing so.

Python has a concept of truthy[1] which allows you to just write `while not won:` which is more idiomatic.

What happened is that since line 35 was indented, the `line_equal` method was actually returning `None`. And since `None != False` your loop continued.

[1] https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing
Nice! This was my solution.

    def string_match(a, b):
        count = 0
        prev = False
        for sa, sb in zip(a, b):
            if prev and sa == sb:
                count += 1
            prev = sa == sb
        return count
Well yeah, `Integer.valueOf(1)` just returns the cached instance, so it's literally returning the same instance.

But... only for integers < 128 (which is the default max int for the cache IIRC):

    Integer.valueOf(127) == Integer.valueOf(127)
    # true

    Integer.valueOf(128) == Integer.valueOf(128)
    # false

I was just trying to show that two instances can't be compared for *equality* in Java using `==`.
Kind of a weird question when you convert it verbatim to Java. `==` in JS is an equality comparison but in Java is a reference comparison.

In Java, one Integer does not even `==` another integer:

    new Integer(1) == new Integer(1)
    # false

Anyways, it's super easy in any language with operator overloading. Here's Python:

    class Thing:
      def __eq__(self, other):
        return other in (1, 2, 3)
    
    a = Thing()
    (a==1 and a==2 and a==3)
    # True



The solution I just worked up used `zip(a, b)`

https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip
You'll probably need to rework it. I can't see an easy way to make it work keeping your `for i in a:` the way it is.
I think your problem is probably with using the `.find()` method.

One of the example strings on codingbat is `xxcaazz`. Let's use this example:

`'xxcaazz'.find('x')` always returns 0

So the first time through the loop, `i` is `x` and it returns 0, which is right.

Second time through the loop, `i` is again `x` and it still returns 0, which isn't what you want. You'd want it to return 1, representing the 2nd character in the string.

Long story short, your code potentially fails when the same character appears in the string twice.

Your code also doesn't count the same character twice if needed. Even once you fix the problem with `find()` it would still only return 1 for `abc` and `abc` when it should return 2.
`ema12` and `ema26` are series.

When you do this: `ema26 < ema12`

How can you define if one whole series is less than another whole series? If all the items are less than all the items in the other series? If ONE item is less than ONE item from the other series?

Neither pandas nor python will answer that for you. You need to do the conversion yourself when you compare the objects.

Your syntax is not quite right. Check out the examples here:

        else_=func.to_char(table.c.date_s, '%m/%d/%Y')
    )

For your specific case, you could also use Oracle's NVL2 function which would be a little more simple:

Rearrange the problem and maybe it will make more sense.

Remove the 865 and all the other numbers sum to 3070.

11879 + 1600 - 300 - 109 - 11000 + 1000 = 3070

In the first case you're adding 865 to 3070:

11879 + 1600 - 300 - 109 - 11000 + 1000 + 865 =  3935

And in the second case you're subtracting.

11879 + 1600 - 300 - 109 - 11000 + 1000 - 865 = 2205

None of the calculators you're using are wrong.
Not sure what you're getting at.

3070 + 865 = 3935

Placebos can work. Sometimes even when you know it's a placebo.
The problem is that while your initial query DOES join scenes and projects, when you access a related item like `scenes` for each project, it issues another query to fetch those items.

You will likely need to experiment with [prefetch](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/api.html#prefetch) to accomplish what you want.

Why *did* angular skip a version though? I haven't been following it. Was there an actual reason for it?
Didn't feel anything in Ashburn.
Where are you getting that from? It’s in the standard library. 

https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html
I have no idea honestly. I've never encountered a situation where that's necessary or desired.

It's mentioned in the docs as "one of the pillars of Flask’s design is that you can have more than one application in the same Python process" but that's the only place in the docs that this "pillar" is mentioned. Weird.

IMO one of the main issues it solves is circular dependency. Let's say you create your app in app.py and all your views in views.py. In app.py you import your views and register them to the app. Then in one of your views, you want to call a function that needs an app. You would need to import the app from app.py. Now you have circular dependency between app.py and views.py. There are ways around this, but they will all feel a little hacky. The application context is a *slightly* more elegant solution to that.

FWIW, there's a big Github issue to update the application context docs because they are misleading and confusing:

https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/1151
Yes. The first line is the "summary" and any other lines are the description (separated by a blank line). GitHub desktop just splits it out to separate boxes.

Just do this:

#Application Context

I write a function that I want to be accessible by any Flask application. You could write 2 Flask apps and run them both in the same Python process, and I want my function to work for both of them.

So I write my function like this:

    def myfunction(app):
        print("this app is cool: {}".format(app))

Now you can use this from your Flask application. You just need to pass in the current Flask application.

That's not always ideal (partially due to circular dependencies), so as a convenience, Flask provides an "application context" to get the current app.

Now I can rewrite my function like this:

    from flask import current_app

    def myfunction():
        print("this app is cool: {}".format(current_app))

Now you can call it from both of your Flask applications and it will automagically know which one to use.

#Request Context

Similar concept as application context. I write a function to print the URL parameters for a request:

    def printargs(request):
        print(request.args)

Now you need to pass in the request every time you use this function.

But instead of having to pass the request, Flask provides a "request context"

    from flask import request

    def printargs():
        print(request.args)

Now you don't have to pass in the request explicitly, and my function will operate on the current request (if it exists, like in a view) or throw an error otherwise.

For some more fun, you can use this to create "default" values with a syntax like this. It copies the class attribute to an instance attribute whenever an instance is created.

    class Original_Class:
        data_attribute = 'default'

        def __init__(self):
            self.data_attribute = Original_Class.data_attribute

Then you get this:

    instance1 = Original_Class()
    instance1.data_attribute # 'default' as an instance variable

    Original_Class.data_attribute = 'newvalue'

    instance2 = Original_Class()
    instance2.data_attribute # 'newvalue' as an instance variable

    instance1.data_attribute # 'default' unchanged since it is an instance variable

> Or rather, I guess I gave Python something in the more immediate scope to check than the class attribute.

yup

> Will make Original_Class.data_attribute always an instance variable?

yup


Your post is hard to read, so I reformatted it:

    class Original_Class:
        data_attribute = 'original'

    original_instance = Original_Class() ## Class instance made
    
So far so good.

    Original_Class.data_attribute = 'original updated' ## Update underlying class

    original_instance.data_attribute 'original updated' ## Also updates created instance

So reassigning a data attribute to the base class updates an already created instance.

    original_instance.data_attribute = 'data updated 2' 
    Original_Class.data_attribute 'original updated' ## Updating the instance does not affect base class. Makes sense

    Original_Class.data_attribute = 'data updated 3' 
    original_instance.data_attribute 'data updated 2' ## Suddenly the class and instance are no longer entangled

Can anyone explain what's going on here? Thanks!

---

Now, to answer your question. When you do this:

    original_instance.data_attribute

Python checks to see if there is an instance attribute on `original_instance`. If not, then it checks for a class attribute with the same name.

So when you first check `original_instance.data_attribute` it's returning the class attribute.

Then when you do `original_instance.data_attribute = 'data updated 2'` you're adding an instance attribute, but it just happens to have the same name as the class attribute.

You can check that the class attribute is updated by doing this:

    original_instance.__class__.data_attribute

What error do you get?
You should do the split on each row.
    'sjkasj fco st asklakl 2920 291029 sjajkjska'.split()

Will return a list

    ['sjkasj', 'fco', 'st', 'asklakl', '2920', '291029', 'sjajkjska']

You could then use that to write to the CSV file.

> Is it not possible to have both these on the same page and same route?

It is possible. It's not a good idea, but it's possible.

It's best practice to have your views do one thing. Right now this view is handling at least 3 things that I can see: liking a video, disliking a video, and posting comments.

Views that do one thing are easier to test and troubleshoot (in cases exactly like this).

You would be much better suited by breaking this apart into 3 views.

However, to address the immediate issue, you test `request.form['likebtn'] == 'Like'` in your view. When you submit the comments form, there is no field named `likebtn` so trying to access `request.form['likebtn']` will raise a `KeyError`. You either need to catch this error or check to see if `likebtn` is in `request.form`.

But like I said, splitting this view apart is a better solution and will make your life easier and you'll be able to troubleshoot much easier.
Agreed. Dude didn’t even get a ticket since he didn’t technically break any traffic laws. 
You should have a more verbose error message in the console. What is that error message telling you?

That being said, looks like you’re trying to access “likebtn” in your view, but I don’t see that being passed from the form.

> Is it a good idea to do this throughout my code (put hooks in where it makes testing easier? )

To be blunt, it's a horrible idea. And a good indicator that you should refactor your code to make testing the production path easier, or use some testing libraries that can help you.

Are you familiar with mocking and patching? In this case I would probably patch the "choice" method during testing to always return the first result.

Here's an example.

    class FetchStuffFromDB(object):
        def __init__(self, category):
            self.category = category

        def fetch(self):
            get = <code that talks to DB>
            chosen = choice(get[self.category])
            return chosen 

Then using your test library's "patch" functionality (how this is used is different for each library, like pytest or unittest). You can swap out the random.choice call with a method that is NOT random. In this case it just returns the first item instead of a random item. So now you have a deterministic way to test this method.

    @patch('random.choice', lambda x: x[0])
    def test_fetch():
        chosen = FetchStuffFromDB('category').fetch()
        assert chosen == 4

Edit: When I do code reviews, I *usually* only allow patching of methods/classes in the standard library. This is usually to make random or time-based functions not random anymore - like your example, UUIDs, random number, dates, etc. You technically can patch large functions in your own codebase, but then you're back to the same place you were when you asked this question - parts of your production code are not being tested.

The dog's age in human years after X years will be

Good stuff! When I first implemented it, I felt like I was going against the grain because everything you read online says "you should be using vuex".

If I needed more, I'd probably go with something like a [global event bus](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Non-Parent-Child-Communication) instead of vuex.

That's what we do for our big Vue app. No problems yet. It's very easy to understand what's going on when you don't need to worry about "extra coding to ensure that the list in the $store still matches the list on the server".

We do some basic caching for API endpoints that don't change very often, but that's easier to implement then a whole vuex store.

Honestly it's probably a good idea to start with a clean database when you go live. I wouldn't worry about resetting IDs for a go-live if you can prevent it.
What database do you use?

Best way is probably to use an autoincrement field and set the number it starts at to 5000. However, some databases (MySQL) only allow one auto increment column per table, and you're probably using it for the ID. So if you're using MySQL that's not an option.

Actually, if you're using an autoincrement column for ID already, can you just add 5000 to that and show it as the invoice number?

    class Invoice:
        @property
        def invoice_number(self):
            return self.id + 5000

Using that method the invoice number isn't stored to the database, but does it need to be?

To answer your direct question, yes you can access the database in models.py. Here's an example that increments an invoice number to the max() + 1 if it doesn't already have an invoice number.

    class Invoice(models.Model):
        invoice_num = models.PositiveIntegerField(null=False)

        def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
            if not self.invoice_num:
                self.invoice_num = Invoice.objects.latest('invoice_num').invoice_num
            super().save(*args, **kwargs)

However, this has a possible race condition. If two new invoices are saved at the same time, they would get the same invoice number. So I probably wouldn't use this method.

Not always.

"sudo" runs a command as another user. Any user.

"su" switches to another user. Any user.

To switch to another user, you only need to run "su anotheruser". However, many systems have "su" locked down so you can only run it as root. So then you need to run "sudo su anotheruser" to run "su anotheruser" as root.

It's common practice to set up permissions so that normal users can only access su when running as root, and only allow sudo to access su. That's why the "sudo su" pattern exists.

It's possible to give normal users access to su directly, but that's not a good idea.

In this example, I can't see why the parent component should be keeping track of the the state of the child component at all (isPlaying, etc).

For a video player component, I think it would make sense to pass the URL/path to the video as a prop and that's it. The video component would keep track of its own state (playing, paused, fast forwarding, etc). It could emit events when things happen, so the parent component (or other components) could respond to them.

But in general, each component should be keeping track of its own state. And I think that might be a good way for you to think about the encapsulation (data vs state).

> I come to a similar conclusion when I was thinking about how to implement a component that shows notifications. Again, I could pass down an array in a prop, and then I could add messages with .push() but shouldn't the component handle the message queue internally?

In this case I would say that neither the parent nor the component for displaying the notifications should keep track of the message queue. You should use something like vuex or another state management library (or write your own) to keep track of the queue. The notification display component simply shows the notifications in the global state, then any other components can add to the global state.

So close.
I usually set a loading variable, then fetch the data from the API. That way you can distinguish between these states:

1. data not yet loaded
2. data loaded and no contacts found
3. data loaded and contacts populated

Script could look like this:


    data() {
        return {
            loading: true,
            contacts: [],
        }
    }

    created() {
        this.fetchData()
    }

    methods: {
        fetchData() {
            this.loading = true

            someApi.getContacts().then((data) => {
                this.contacts = data
                this.loading = false
            })
        }
    }

And template could then look like this:

    <div v-if="loading">
        contacts loading...
    </div>
    <template v-else>
        <div v-if="contacts.length">
            show contacts here
        </div>
        <div v-else>
            no contacts found
        </div>
    </template>

For "date difference in seconds" you can do

    (date2 - date1).total_seconds()

instead of

    def dateDiffInSeconds(date1, date2): #dunno
      timedelta = date2 - date1
      return timedelta.days * 24 * 3600 + timedelta.seconds

When you do `(d2 - d1)` it returns a [timedelta](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects)  object.

Is this right?

486 * 10 = 4860 days

Then add back in the 25 days where they can rewatch another movie, that's only 4,885 days.

Shouldn't it be (5110 - 25) / 10 = 508.5 movies
> how many movies would it be possible to show them in that amount of days?

5,110 days and one movie per day, it would be possible to show 5,110 movies

Do you want the minimum number of movies possible? Watch a movie 10 times then move on to the next one.

5110 / 10 = 511 movies

And with 25 days where they could watch the same movie again:

(5110 - 25) / 10 = 508.5 movies

> It’s chicken dumplings. 

Gnocchi is actually just the dumpling. No chicken required. 
Gotcha. I just edited my reply above. It's a weird syntax that I would probably never use. value_types should definitely be keyword arguments IMO.
> They put keyword args, then *args after them in some of there functions. So, in your opinion this would be bad practice?

It's not bad practice - Python just doens't even work that way. It's a syntax error. Do you have a link to what you're referring to? I'm curious now.

Edit: I take that back, slightly. The only thing I can think of is this:

    def awesome(one=1, two=2, *args):
        print(one, two, args)

In this case, `one` and `two` are not necessarily keyword arguments. 

So you can call awesome with no arguments:

    awesome()

You can call with only positional arguments (as many as you want):

    awesome(1, 2)
    awesome(1, 2, 3)

But if you call with keyword arguments, you can't specify any more positional arguments:

    awesome(one=1, two=2)

Neither of these will work:

    awesome(one=1, two=2, 3)
    awesome(3, one=1, two=2)

It's kind of a strange syntax and I would probably never define a function like that.
When you define a function, you can use `*args` to capture positional arguments, and `**kwargs` to capture keyword arguments. When you call a function or define a function, and important point to remember is that there can be no positional arguments after keyword arguments.

Better understood with an example:

    def func1(one, two):
        print(one, two)

I could call it using any of these:

    func1(1, 2)
    func1(one=1, two=2)
    func1(1, two=2)
    func1(1, two=2)

But I cannot do this:

    func1(one=1, 2)

Another function:

    def func2(one, two=2):
        print(one, two)

I could use all the same calls as `func1` but in addition, `two` is a keyword argument with a default value, so I can also do this:

    func2(1)

I can define a function to capture an arbitrary number of keyword and positional arguments:

    def func3(*args, **kwargs):
        print(args, kwargs)

And I can call this however I want:

    func3('hello', 'world', something='yes')

But I cannot call it with keyword arguments before positional arguments:

    func3(error='yes', 'definitely')

In your `args_test` function, you have positional arguments defined after keyword arguments.

Change the defintiion to this:

    def args_test(*args, kwarg1='foo', kwarg2='bar'):

And now you can call it with any number of positional arguments:

    args_test('one', 'two')

Or you can overwrite kwarg1, kwarg2, or both:

    args_test('one', 'two', kwarg1=1)
    args_test('one', 'two', kwarg2=2)
    args_test('one', 'two', kwarg1=1, kwarg2=2)
    
Using selenium bindings, it might look something like this (for my example above).

    driver = webdriver.Firefox()
    driver.get("http://www.example.com")
    value = driver.find_element_by_id('status').text

This will literally load an instance of Firefox (you will see it pop up on your screen) then you can use the `driver.find_element_by_id` selector to get the value.

Since it's Firefox, it will run all the JavaScript when you call `driver.get()`. However, if it does a lot of AJAX stuff, it might not be complete by the time you call `find_element_by_id`. In that case you can add some waits to make sure it has time to complete.

You can implicitly wait:

    driver.implicitly_wait(10) # seconds

But in this case it would be great until we could say "wait until the div contains the text 'available'". You can do that too!

    from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
    from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
    from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

    element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(
        EC.text_to_be_present_in_element((By.ID, "status"), "available")
    )

So that will wait until the JavaScript has loaded for sure (but at most 10 seconds).

Selenium is really powerful and you can do stuff that you can't in BS, but it can be slightly tricky to figure out how to do things on pages that have lots of JavaScript.
This answer has a working solution on stackoverflow:

You can definitely add TypeScript definitions. You can bundle the type definitions (in a `.d.ts` file), use other provided type definitions, or write your own for libraries that don't have them.

I believe for flow you can include type definitions in a `.js.flow`file. So if your library is `something.js`you can include `something.js.flow` along with your published library and it should just work. Haven't tried, but I'm sure there's a way with flow to write your own definitions for libraries that don't have them.
Ah yes, JavaScript most likely. Here's a super simple example:

    <div id="status">sold out online</div>
    
    <script>
        document.getElementById('status').innerHTML = '123 available';
    </script>

If you "view source" then you will see that it says "sold out online" but if you "inspect element" then it will say "123 available".

View Source = Source that is delivered to your browser, before any JavaScript runs. This is also what BeautifulSoup sees, since it doesn't run JavaScript.

Inspect Element = Current state of what you see on the page. JavaScript has probably run at this point.

If you want to scrape stuff that is loaded through JavaScript you'll need to venture into the world of selenium (http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io) which controls actual Web browsers so it can run the JavaScript.

> I have no way to make the information "escape the walled garden" of showresults().

Sure you do. `showresults` could call another method with the selected values, or you could update a global variable:


    selected_values = None

    def showresults():
        global selected_values
        selected = listbox.curselection()
        selected_values = [options[idx] for idx in selected]

Now anytime after you click the button, you can access selected_values.

Hard to answer definitively when I'm not sure what exactly you're trying to do with the values once they are selected.
You can use `listbox.curselection()` to get an index of each selected item. So if you've selected the first and third items, it would return `(0, 2)`.

If you need to get the actual values of what is selected, you'll need to use those indexes to lookup in the original list. You can change the command of the button to a method that does that.

Here's an updated example that will print the value of each item selected when the button is clicked.


    window = tkinter.Tk()

    options = ["Option A", "Option B"]

    Label(window, text="Choose options").pack(padx=5,pady=10)
    listbox = Listbox(window, selectmode=MULTIPLE)
    for item in options:
        listbox.insert(END, item)
    listbox.pack()

    def showresults():
        selected = listbox.curselection()
        values = [options[idx] for idx in selected]
        print(values)

    confirm_button = tkinter.Button(window, text="Confirm", command=showresults).pack()

    window.mainloop()

Man, that's nothing.

I once worked on a database that had a "role_id" column for storing user roles. It had data that looked like this:

100001001

101001000

100000000

You're thinking "binary!" and you are wrong.

It turns out that each digit (starting from the left) corresponds to an ID in the "role" table. So if the position first from the left had a 1, the user had role with ID=1. Second from the left, the user had role with ID=2. You get the idea.

In subsequent upgrades, there were new roles added, so digits were just appended to these existing values.

Other places in the database used actual foreign keys, so I don't know WTF they were thinking with that one.

        return skip

Yes! I have a car-only napper as well. 3 years old. But thankfully she won't wake up when I move her to her bed as long as she has been asleep for about 10 minutes.
I'd do it one of two ways. First define a "print_decorator"

    from functools import wraps

    def print_decorator(func):
        """A decorator to print the result before returning."""
        @wraps(func)
        def decfunc(*args, **kwargs):
            rv = func(*args, **kwargs)
            print(rv)
            return rv
        return decfunc

Then just decorate the methods you want:

    class Worker(object):

        def _get_id(self):
            return uuid.uuid4()

        @print_decorator
        def run(self):
            return self._get_id()

    worker = Worker()
    worker.run()

Or if you don't want to decorate the class, do it after instantiation:

    class Worker(object):

        def _get_id(self):
            return uuid.uuid4()

        def run(self):
            return self._get_id()

    worker = Worker()
    worker.run = print_decorator(worker.run)
    worker.run()

Well by default `re.search` will only search one line (which is delimited by \n). We can add another capture group for everything after the numbers:

    heat input\D*([\d\.,]*) *(M{0,2}) *([^\r]+)

Let's try it:

    >>> val = 'askdfk heat input:  x  2.00 MM BTU/hr\r\n another line here'
    >>> match = re.search('heat input\D*([\d\.,]*) *(M{0,2}) *([^\r]+)', val)

    >>> match.groups()
    ('2.00', 'MM', 'BTU/hr')

So `group(3)` has what you want now.
Here's a really great site for testing your regexes and visualizing what is going on.

https://regex101.com

What you have is pretty close. What I'd probably do to enhance it:

    heat input\D*([\d\.,]*)

This says:

heat input followed by

any non-numeric characters followed by

numbers, commas, periods any number of times (and capture this group)

Then you can use the "capture group" to get the specific output you want in Python:

    match = re.search('heat input\D*([\d\.,]*)', val)

    >>> match.group(0)
    'heat input:    2,000.00'
    
    >>> match.group(1)
    '2,000.00'

You can enhance further to check for MM:

    heat input\D*([\d\.,]*) *(M{0,2})

This is the same as above except it will match "0 or 2 Ms" after the numbers.

Then you can check for `match.group(2)` to see if MM was present:

    >>> val = 'askdfk heat input:  x  2,000 BTU/hr'
    >>> match = re.search('heat input\D*([\d\.,]*) *(M{0,2})', val)
    >>> match.groups()
    ('2,000', '')
    >>> bool(match.group(2))
    False

    >>> val = 'askdfk heat input:  x  2.00 MM BTU/hr'
    >>> match = re.search('heat input\D*([\d\.,]*) *(M{0,2})', val)
    >>> match.groups()
    ('2.00', 'MM')
    >>> bool(match.group(2))
    True

The order of the import statements does not matter, but you need to call `install_cache()` before any of your `requests.get()` calls otherwise they will not be cached.
> Is this all somehow automatic?

Basically, yes. It does what's called monkey-patching.

Essentially what it does is a more complicated version of this:

    import requests

    def custom_get(*args, **kwargs):
        response = requests.get(*args, **kwargs)
        print('got a response!', response)
        return response

    requests.get = custom_get

You can replace functions in other modules with your own version. In my method I've replaced `requests.get`with a custom version that just prints the response. It should work exactly like the regular `requests.get` but prints the response.

In the case of `requests-cache`, when you call `install_cache()` it's going to monkey-patch any necessary methods to cache the responses when you call `requests.get()`

That's your problem.

404 exceptions happen at the **app** level, not the blueprint level.
It's probably just making requests faster than the API updates.

When I run it in a `while True` loop I get this:

    {"latitude": "-39.6958", "longitude": "-116.4965"}
    {"latitude": "-39.6958", "longitude": "-116.4965"}
    {"latitude": "-39.6958", "longitude": "-116.4965"}
    {"latitude": "-39.6958", "longitude": "-116.4965"}
    {"latitude": "-39.6766", "longitude": "-116.4647"}
    {"latitude": "-39.6766", "longitude": "-116.4647"}
    {"latitude": "-39.6766", "longitude": "-116.4647"}
    {"latitude": "-39.6766", "longitude": "-116.4647"}
    ...

So it's able to make a couple requests before the API has a chance to update.
You're not doing anything wrong. That's just the way python works.

In this case it seems like VSCode is a maybe little dumber than Brackets.

VSCode does not seem to know that `e.target` is a DOM element but Brackets was able to figure it out.

This is because it has no way of knowing what you passed to your `test(e)` function. You could potentially pass `test("string")`.

If you use it directly on the result of `getElementById` it can easily figure out that it's an Element.

>Purchasing new toilets for the entire school will cost $22,000. It will need to employ plumbers to fit the toilets at a cost of $9,500

Total cost for toilets is $31,500

> It is estimated that this will save the school $16,000 in water consumption fees.

Is that 16,000 per year? Let's assume so for the sake of math.

> The hand-driers will cost $13,500. The cost of employing electricians to install the hand-driers will come to $4,400

Total cost is 17,900

> As the school will no longer have to purchase paper towels, it will save $7,300 per year. It also estimates it will save $1,000 per year in cleaning costs, as the bathrooms will take less time to clean and bins will need to be emptied less frequently. The school will incur additional electricity costs of $1,700 per year however.

Ok cool.

So let's add up "one time costs" for installation.

$31,500+ $17,900 = $49,400

Now let's add up how much the school will save each year.

$16,000 + $7,300 + $1,000 - $1,700 = $22,600

Now divide the total cost by the yearly savings to get the number of years for payback.

P(A | B) is basically "the probability of A after B has been observed true". 

So for independent events P(A|B) = P(A). Think of coin flips. P(first flip) = 0.5 and P(second flip) = 0.5 and P(second | first) = 0.5 cause it doesn't matter what the first flip was - second flip always has 0.5 chance.

But it's different for dependent events:

P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

For A to occur after B, B must have occurred which is P(B) and A and B must have occurred together which is P(A ∩ B)
Which part do you need help with?

Do you understand the difference between independent and dependent?

Professional programmer here. I use both Python and Swift on a daily basis. Both are great languages and I enjoy working in both.

I also do a little bit of Kotlin work as well. I hated Java as well but Kotlin took away all the pain points, and it works with all the Java libraries my coworkers wrote. Worth checking out. It's pretty similar to Swift in many ways.
This is how I was doing it:

    $ kotlinc main.kt 
    
    $ kotlin MainKt
    Hello world!

    $ java -cp /path/kotlin-stdlib-jre8-1.1.2-3.jar:/path/kotlin-runtime-1.1.2-3.jar:. MainKt
    Hello world!

You sure the paths to the stdlib and runtime jars are correct? Java will not show an error telling you the path is not correct or the jar doesn't exist. It will just spit out the "NoClassDefFoundError".

Your example works for me when I try.

Once you figure out the classpath issue, the following should work. No class actually needed in kotlin:

    fun main(args: Array<String>) {
        println("Hello world!")
    }

It will generate a MainKt.class for you with `public final class MainKt { public static final void main(String[] args) }`

This one is okay. You're asking to "GET all tasks" and you return all tasks.

    @app.route('/task/<int:task_id>', methods=['GET'])

This one also looks okay. You're asking "GET one task" and you return a single task.

    @app.route('/task/', methods=['POST'])

This is one he's talking about. You're asking "Create a single task" but then you return all tasks. This should only return the single task you just created.

Likewise for updating a task. It should return only the task you update.

> How could the variable be altered if the user is coming from one of my pages, and going to another of my pages? 

The "next" variable is being injected from a URL parameter. So anyone can send a link to someone else and have it redirect wherever they want if you don't validate it.

> Unless the user is doing that themself - in which case, why do I care?

Let's say you run Example Bank and your site is example.com. I run malicioussite.com and I have designed my site to look exactly like yours. I create page that looks like your login page and says "authentication failed. try again" in an attempt to capture usernames and passwords.

I create a link that looks like the following:

http://example.com/login?next=http://malicioussite.com

I send this link out in a phishing email that says "This is your bank. Please login to update your info!"

The user clicks on that link, enters their credentials (correctly). It's your site, so it's legit. Then gets redirected to my fake "authentication failed" page after logging in. User enters credentials again on my fake login page and I capture them.

This example might be a little far fetched for what you're developing, but it's just one example of what can and does happen with this kind of thing.
They don't need to break into your webserver. The next variable is being injected from a URL parameter.

http://example.com/login?next=http://malicioussite.com

That will redirect you to malicioussite.com after login.

Bottom line is you should ALWAYS validate anything that is user input.

Generally you would do something like this...

>index.blade.php

    <div id="container"></div>

>app.js

    import Vue from 'vue'
    import App from './App.vue'

    var vm = Vue({ 
        render: (h) => h(App)
    })

    vm.$mount('#container')

>app.vue

    <template>
        <div>
            <navbar></navbar>
        </div>
    </template>

    <script>
        import Navbar from './Components/Nav.vue';
        
        export default {
            components: {
                navbar: Navbar
            }
        }
    </script>

That puts all the template logic in app.vue so it can be pre-compiled to a render function.

And you can put whatever else you want in app.vue as well.

Hope that helps.

So here you have a component in your HTML that needs to be compiled in the browser.

The runtime version of vue.js cannot do this since it does not include the template renderer. You have 2 options (as described in the error message you are receiving:

1. pre-compile the templates into render functions (or use single-file components for everything).

2. use the compiler-included build.

This section of the documetation shows you how to switch to the compiler-included build (scroll down a little for browserfy):

https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#Runtime-Compiler-vs-Runtime-only

You should use the runtime build if possible. It's smaller and faster (since it doesn't need to compile templates).

If you're using [css-loader,](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader) and [extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin) then yes. You can just `import './_reset.scss'` provided you have it configured correctly in webpack.

JSON.parse is expecting a string of JSON data. You're passing it a path to a JSON file.

If half the teams win all their games and the other half loses all their games, team 16 would have 0 points and make it to the playoffs.

I doubt that could happen though, since I assume two teams from the "lose all" half would need to play each other at some point.

So depending on the league structure, somewhere just above 0 would be the answer, depending on how many times teams play each other. If a team from the "lose all" half can get away with only winning 3 games then they could get to the playoffs with only 6 points.

You can write the current votes like this:

42 * 4.57 = 191.94 total points

The number of votes we need is 42 + x and the desired score is 4.66 so you can substitute those on the left side of the equation. This also means the total points will go up by x * 5 so add that to the right side of the equation:

(42 + x) * 4.66 = 191.94 + (x * 5)

Solve for x and that's how many more votes you need.
That game is 50/50.

Think about what you want the offensive player to do, and try to position yourself to force him to do only that.

Simple example... if he is coming down the wing and you want to keep him outside and prevent him from cutting inside or crossing, you need to position yourself so he cannot move his body inside and does not have an angle to pass.

Obviously the closer you get, the harder it will be for him to cut or pass. If you just run in as fast as you can, he can predict your tackle and make a move around you. If you give him too much space, he can make any move he wants and you will be caught off guard 100% of the time.

Position your body such that his only move is to continue down the line, then when he moves down the line you have predicted that. You're on balance for that and can make a tackle or force him to make a mistake.

This is where it just takes practice practice practice. You have to know when to commit to the tackle and when to give him a little space to make a move. Ultimately what you want is for the offender to make a move that is really your idea! Give him a little space, cut down the angles, and make him want to take the only move you are giving him.

Don't attack him square. Come in with one foot in front of the other, slightly "bladed". This will keep you on balance no matter which way he chooses to go.

Here's a video discussing some of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqJ9u2-hPN4

His footwork is not great though. He's opening himself up to nutmegs. I'd personally come in more angled.

Which step in your friend's break down do you not understand?

No, I'm boxidea.
Wrap it with a if block something like this:

You can't have your kek and meme it too.

Oh shit. You should probably go file a critical bug report right now.
The Human class accepts anything that implements Alcohol so it shouldn't matter too much.
Took my 3 year old shopping this weekend. We walked into a clothing store...

"Oops. Sorry daddy. I messed up all the clothes."

"Oh, you don't need to apologize. You didn't do anything."

"But I will."

This should apply to biased coins as well... you'd just need to substitute 0.5 probability with p or q.

Makes sense. No worries. I don't plan to use it in a crib or with an infant. 
Solved! Thanks!
No brand name or marking on it. The main dowel is about 12" long. Looks like maybe it's supposed to hang. 
I combine the high kick with juggles. 10 juggles, then the 10th one is a high kick that I practice controlling 3 different ways: keeping it close, moving to space, or passing. It's a pretty fun drill. 
I went to WalMart and got a pair of youth shin guards for $5. No strap, and they are not obnoxiously huge. They have been working great for a couple years now.

That's amazing! I usually can't finish one without losing four.
Is there an easy way to understand peer dependencies in NPM? If vue depends on vue-template-compiler being installed, why isn't it a regular dependency? What's the difference?
Create a data variable called `name` for the input value. Bind that to the input using `v-model`. Then you can use `this.name` in your methods.

    Vue.component("name-sub", {
      template: 
      `<div class="name-sub">
        <label>Name: <input v-model="name" /></label>
        <button v-on:click="onNameSub">Submit</button>
       </div>`,
      data: function() {
        return {name: ''}
      },
      methods: {
        onNameSub: function() {      
          alert(this.name);
        }
      }
    });

You should check out the Vue guides if you haven't already. This is covered on the introduction page under Handling User Input.

Yes. 
I was just trying to eat my lunch today at work but some jerk stole it and ran to the other side of the building #hotdogdownahallway
Except the lightning cables. They came out in 2012 so that's 3 per year. 
Cool. But how is this related to Flask?
> You're actually using more code in this example.

Not saying you're wrong... but how so?
I get your point, but it can easily be done with basically the same amount of code:

>  <a class="button button-wide">.button .button-wide</a>

Why is the duplication needed? button-wide is obviously a button.

Bootstrap does the same thing and it drives me crazy.

No. Just use regular foreign keys. 

Use validation to ensure either an artist or group is selected (but not both) if you want to enforce that.
Seriously. Doesn't water weigh like half a pound per 8 ounces. 2 pounds is around 4 cups of water. I drink that much coffee before 10 am. 
I've seen software dev jobs that would normally pay 100k go to someone with an h1b for about 50k. 
Don't know about construction, but in IT, definitely tens of thousands per worker. Maybe up to 50k per worker annually, depending on the position and city. 
I don't get it.

My wife told my daughter on Tuesday they were going to vote.

"And then I will drive the vote!"

Pretty sure my daughter thought they were going boating.
This might be tricky. There's no straightforward way to do it.

The index name is created by the [BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._create_index_name](https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/db/backends/base/schema.py#L830) method.

A subclass of this class is then set on the connection class for your database engine. Here's the [Postgres](https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/db/backends/postgresql/base.py#L139) line for example.

You could potentially create a custom database backend that inherits from the base backend and overwrite only the SchemaEditorClass with a custom class that does what you want. Might work. Might not. I haven't tried it.

Seems like a lot of work though for no discernible advantage IMO.
Saw 3 jets fly right over McLean. I was at Lewinsville Park at the time.
Well on the surface it doesn't seem like there would be a difference.

In a 1, 2, 3 scheme, 1.5 would be the halfway point between low and medium (1 and 2). In a 1, 3, 5 scheme, 2 would be the halfway point. There's no difference. Both are unit-less numbers that only have context within the ranking of the specific scheme.

It really depends on the specific implementation, though. There could possibly be a difference depending on exactly what you're doing, but given normal operations (average, mean, mode, etc.) there would be no difference.
I accept pull requests if you want to try and fix it.
I do! Except it only goes forward at a rate of 24 hours per day. 
Two sided here too in Loudoun county. Except ours had a cover folder that you could use while carrying your ballot, and it would feed into the machine right from the folder. Completely hidden.

Wonder if whoever was running your place forgot the cover folders?
Millennial also checking in. My wife and I both voted for Trump. I don't agree with everything he says, but he checks all the right boxes for issues I really care about. I wouldn't admit that I voted for Trump to most of the people I know. Ironically, many of them seem to be filled with hatred and racism.

The newer Gloros (16.1) do not have a tongue though.
Thanks. I didn't see that. 
Games are usually 90 minutes long. In this gif they are at 90+ minutes, which means they are in [stoppage time](http://football.isport.com/football-guides/understanding-stoppage-time-in-soccer) which usually only lasts for a couple minutes.

Meaning... this is likely the last goal scoring opportunity of the game and they are tied 0-0. And he misses. Spectacularly. What are the odds!?
