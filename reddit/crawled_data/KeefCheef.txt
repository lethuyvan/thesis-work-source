I'm having the same issue as well. Both Glitch & Dekker have permanent high spirits.
D2 or "D2"? 
Just like in MWO
Won't be able to play as I'm going away for a few days, but at least it will be ready when I get back on Friday!
Of course I'm going away on a trip tomorrow, but at least it will be ready for me when I get back on Friday!
I'm not offended but I can't say I find it particularly funny either.
I've played less than 50 games but so far I haven't had any trouble with people flaming.
 
Don't as me about my W/L though... :P
>Any mech build should be able to kill any other mech build.

I really don't think that needs to be the case. There are definitely some matches that are won and lost in the mechlab and that's OK - if it wasn't the case, why bother having the mechlab in the first place?

More specificially, if your build doesn't do enough damage, try switching to SPLs or something for higher DPS while maintaining your speed advantage. I don't think an ML build is ideal for lights in S7.
Honor-less curs with high elo ;)
That's only cause the giraffe neck sticks up so high, they're probably pretty close to the FNR in terms of distance to the ground.
I always ban boreal so no comment on that one, factory has been my favorite so far.
I have crushed many an assault with my Warhammer. Tonnage isn't everything.
> LB20 is only better point blank.

Don't forget crit chance, crits are very strong in Solaris. Don't need to destroy structure when you can just crit weapons.
gotta practice those headshots
> "OH MY GOD I CAN'T BELIEVE I LOST TO A 30 TON URBAN MECH!"

I haven't faced off against too many but I have a sneaking suspicion that the urbie is going to be one of the stronger chassis, having a ton of armor and access to good ballistics.
I was doing pretty garbo in the div i started in, but started doing a lot better when I switched. So it's worth experimenting with different divisions and mechs and see what suits you best.
Jungle is always banned anyway lol I think I've only played on it once.
General tips for adapting quick play mechs:

More armor - even on legs. Less ammo than you would usually run for quick play. Chassis with good armor quirks are definitely strong here as well. 

As another poster said, sustained DPS is key so make sure your build runs cool enough for sustained engagements (no cool shots in solaris!). 

Crits are really strong as well - expect to see a lot of LBX-based builds. I've been having some good success with a 2xLBX20 WHR. 




I didn't downvote because I disagree, it was for... Idk, reasons? 
Under 50 or so? but that could change depending on your specific collection. I'd look at chassis overlap as well as number of mechs. If you already own most of the chassis then probably a pass (unless you really like one of them and want a hero with the 30% CB boost). 

It does also come with the premium time which makes it a decent deal even if you do have most of the mechs already in some form or another.
Depends on what you have. If you are a relatively new player/don't have a lot of mechs, I think it is a good value. But if you already have a decent amount of mechs in the pack and/or other heroes, I don't think the new heroes offer much variety from what's otherwise available in those chassis.
They released one recently that has G10 on one side instead of steel which makes it significantly lighter/nicer to carry
Crkt squid
Trulies?
Yep. I came back because of two free hero mechs. And also battletech hype. 
DAE dead gaem? hehehe
try saying the same stuff in any other game (LoL, overwatch, Siege, etc.) and see how fast you get banned

Not familiar with that model but as you can probably tell by surfing the front page, Hamilton is a pretty well regarded brand around here. I myself have a pilot day date ("interstellar") and it's fantastic (although I'm coming from a seiko not an omega so YMMV).

 


if it's warm then can I drain pour my bcbs faster?
cool guitars but why do PRS have such big heels on the necks?!
man now I wanna visit bolivia and get wasted at a 4 day party
yeah they're pretty garbo but whatever got that MC
don't have an urbie yet, what variant is best to go for?
I don't really like the stainless bezel but that dial looks really nice.
I was really tempted by that blue version but I went with the interstellar black. I love lume but I'm gonna save the blue dial spot in my collection for one of the seiko PADIs I think.
I think you can tell them apart by the little icon next to the name in the menu
don't forget water bears
Meh still more fun than terrorist hunt
LoL has two separate queues for this so I think it's a good idea, but it depends of the ranked player base is big enough to support it without wait times going too high 
Play ranked? 
Brew at room temp, store in refrigerator 
If you want to make any money, you have to become an owner or manager, which is incredibly stressful. 
When was this? All SMs I know are salaried and it's been illegal for managers to make tips for several years now
Nice looking watch but damn those are some long ass lugs
There's definitely an argument to be made in favor of low beat movements if they can go longer without a service and/or have a longer power reserve like the powermatic/h40
Just accept it as part of your watch's character! Nothing stays mint forever. 
Love my weekender but I gotta say the ticking drives me nuts at night! 
Not that I could afford either, but I much prefer this one to the other one! 
How thicc is that bad boy? 
I just wish they made a version without the power reserve, unnecessary clutter on such a beautiful dial IMO
Jesus Christ man it was just a bit of non sequitur on my part no need to take it personally 
Just cause it's expensive doesn't mean it's good
If you managed to destroy a timex, it might be worth looking into something purpose-built for toughness like a victorinox INOX or seiko tuna 
I hear that! I would be surprised if brands like phoibos and others didn't start catching on more in the next few years. Coming from the knife world, Chinese brands like Kizer and WE represent some of the best value, high quality pieces out there! Granted, heritage seems to be a lot more important in watches, but it's hard to argue with great value.
Huh, mine does it at 11;56, must just be a variance movement to movement 
Second shittiest, you forgot about Papa John's 
Just picked one of these up a few days ago, loving it so far! 
Looks nice, may have to pick up one for my skx as well. Although sometimes the idea of wearing a dive watch on leather bothers me
I've got the same one, but I switched it to a leather nato strap. This watch does have an obnoxiously sized lug width (23mm), but with a 22m strap you don't really notice. 
Love the clean aesthetic of this watch. Can't go wrong with seiko, it seems. WIGH! 
Yeah that one is going to be an instabuy for me 
Mine actually came sharp out of the box, although it is definitely a little thick behind the edge 
Hmm guess I should have waited for the second batch of round heads... Oh well I still like mine even if it's not as exciting 
I was being a bit facetious, obviously 3 is popular for a reason and I don't have anything against them. But I think that the 4 o'clock crowns are part of what give Seikos such a cool personality
Looks like one of those old backyard thermometers
The BM8180! What a great watch. Although I do blame it for for getting me into watches. To paraphrase /u/NickShabazz, "it may not be all the watch you want, but it's all the watch you need" 
You posting this is not making me want it any less! If only I could decide between this and the Waterbury chrono
3 o'clock crowns are boring! 
I've been eyeing the intelligent quartz flyback chronograph for a while but I may end up going with this instead...
I usually dislike the tank but that one is kind of OK 
Cool watch! My grandfather was also a very practical guy who wore a citizen. 
Crkt could be such a great knife company if they got rid of tip down and 8cr
Nice! Just got mine yesterday. I went for the bronze as well but now I kind of wish I'd gotten it in blue
Love this knife! Such a great value too
I know it's cliche but the leek really is a great knife, the best slicer in my collection save maybe the delica
Any thoughts on the lunar solo vs the skyscape trekker? 
As soon as they come out with a new color I'm going to buy one of these. 
Just buy a crkt squid and save yourself $80.

Edit: or, if you want a small knife with s30v for around $100, get the Spyderco Lil Native 
It looks like they have plain edge too but even so looks pretty meh
I have the wood version and I love it, no plans to sell. But I do kind of regret not getting the CF, may have to pick one up from the next run they do
I have the small and it is the perfect size for me. It's roughly the same size as several of my other favorites like the BM valet, kizer feist, etc. So for edc I think it's ideal.

I know some people have said the ergos are better on the large but I think it just comes down to your own size preference 
The more Spyderco knives I buy the more I love them 
Love the leek. I have several more expensive knives but the leek is still one of my favorites. A well designed and USA made knife with a blade that's actually ground to cut things! 
Infantry GMT that I got off massdrop on black Friday. A bit of an impulse buy on my part but it seemed like too good of a deal to pass up at $100. I don't have much use for the GMT hand but it's not particularly obtrusive either so I don't mind it.

I know it is quartz but it has a sapphire crystal and feels like it is built to last. 

This is my first 'nice' watch and my first with a metal bracelet. It definitely wears differently than my little citizen bm8180! The mesh band is growing on me but I think I'll get a nato strap for it for every day wear. It definitely has stiff competition for wrist time vs the citizen which is pretty much the perfect tool watch for my money. 

I'm mainly a knife guy so having a watch made by (in my opinion) one of the most iconic knife makers out there is super cool to me.

I'm already feeling the itch and looking at some of the victorinox autos along with Hamilton and seiko for my next purchase... But this is suiting me well for now! 
I'm liking it so far, it is definitely on the small side which is nice. The brass looks really nice but I already have the wallet from them in stainless so I got the pen to match. 
The Parker Jotter is another one to check out that will take a lot of standard refills. Would definitely recommend carrying a cheaper pen for a while before you commit to a more expensive one! 

I'm liking the machine Era so far but it is my first "bolt action" pen so I don't have much to compare it to 
So far so great but I just got it yesterday as well!
Lumintop AAA Tool Ti, Machine Era field pen, Spyderco Lil Native

wait, that's a *flipper*? how
So, essentially the same as living in Boston or Chicago?
I'm a simple man - I see beer scouts, I upvote.
ooh very nice, what'd you use to get that?
What about a delica or endura? They are lockback knives and cheaper than the other spydercos you mentioned.


yeah I like that blade shape a lot but if it were mine I'd definitely get some aftermarket scales done
Reminds me of the CRKT wrinkle ;) 
Hopefully they make enough that I can actually get one... 
Thanks! Just ordered one :)
Where'd you get it? Everywhere I've seen is either sold out or doesn't have them in yet
I don't have particularly big hands but it's fine for me. It's not going to be something you want to hard use for a long time but for typical EDC stuff it's perfectly fine.
I only have the valet but I can definitely recommend it! Disappears in your pocket and you get dat M390.

The smaller axis lock is not as "swingy" as on my griptilian but is still pretty good after some breaking in.

I finally pulled her... - spd... 
Just got mine the other day! I'm liking it but it's definitely different than my other knives. How are you finding yours so far? 
Pre orders sold out already... Dammit... 
Which is good because the pvp in d2 is g a r b a g e
See you, space cowboy 
Reminds me of [Spike](https://goo.gl/images/8GkddP)
I'd whale for that
Cormag yes pls
The dragonfly line does lock so you may need to take that into consideration 
But... Why? 
It's the TTT - tactical turd trowel
Yeah I just got some in and was a little disappointed considering how hyped mango is. Ah well I got some creme  brulee in too so it's all good 
Yeah I really wish they made lower % or even 0% nic pods
First impressions are that it has a great action for such a small knife. I will try to take a better photo soon - the blue anodization is a really nice color in person. Pretty much the entire frame (integral) is milled although it is a little rough in some places. 
I'd be all over one of these if they made them in 154CM
I pulled brave lucina and brave Ike back to back... Pls dont kill me
An umbrella 
coming from the ridiculous grind of SW: Galaxy of Heroes, FE:H is downright generous
yeah it seems to be fit pretty snug - I tried both punching and pulling it out with my skeletool pliers so far but I'll try heating it up. 
Yeah I know, I suppose my point is that the CF looks really nice :)
I got the wood version but kind of regretting not going for the CF
tell that to /u/spaced_inv8r 
Does the action feel gritty at all, and will it drop shut? 
That's kind of the problem... I have several more expensive knives but when it comes down to something no-nonsense that "just works" it is really hard to beat!
Hello everyone! Welcome back to another episode of kickstarter crap
I have one as well. It was pretty stiff when I first got it but it's broken in  nicely 
I wanna say it was /u/NickShabazz or someone else on here
Hmm I want a techno but have been holding off because of the rumored techno v2
Yuengling (beer), citizen bm8180 (watch), and benchmade x shinola valet (knife) 
You forgot your Oxford comma! 
Looks like a strider but actually appealing 
What sort of scales are you thinking of doing? 
Looks cool man! Nice to see queen get some love on here
Just ordered mine yesterday! I also went with the wood 
Judging from that choice, I'd say we're a good influence :} 
As the owner of an orange Delica, griptilian, and shinola valet, I must respectfully disagree :) 
I'm between this and the rams horn but I think I will go with the wood
Not a strider fan myself but I will say that Chris Reeve hasn't felt the need to add a lockbar insert to their expensive titanium framelocks either. 
Ahh I'm glad I held off on the old version. This should scratch my front flipper itch nicely 
European companies can get m390 a lot cheaper, I imagine we're going to start seeing it more on "cheaper" knives 
I must be the only one on this sub who doesn't have a pm2 at this point 
Everyone should own this knife. 
Agreed! I also don't normally like black coated blades but this one looks real nice 

Edit: take that gosh darn zip tie off though! 
Looks like a pretty standard ZT clip, I'd hit up KAI and see if they can hook you up. Otherwise check mxg gear I'd say
Have been thinking about getting one of these lately since I think they're legal to carry where I live too and would be fun to have. Not sure how people would react to me having it though even as short as it is, I got comments when I lent my squid to my coworker the other day... 
I'd get the sharpening system first and then buy the rat 2 since you already have a couple of SAKs
The valet is a great knife and I do wonder why it isn't more popular as well. 

I will say, however, that the leek is hard to beat. 
I think the clip is unique to this knife - I don't know that benchmade has any other ones they could offer you
I sent an offer we'll see what happens. I may end up just waiting for the feist v2 depending on the price. I really want the smoke although I do wish it was a bit smaller - I can't believe they only made 100 >_<
pm'd
ah nice I missed that post, thanks!
I'll buy it off you if you don't want it
Nice, I also have a medium stockman. great knife!
what case do you usually carry?
I'm not too concerned about a different variant, as long as they do more than 100 so I can actually get one!

CF is cool but I think I'd prefer a plain titanium one. A nice polished g10 could also be cool
I hope they do another run of these soon
Spyderco sent me a sticker with the replacement clip I ordered for my Delica (along with an extra set of screws and some blue loctite!) 
Very nice, are the scales full CF or g10 /peel ply? 
Didn't like mine but then I started carrying it at work. Seems to be more worth it now even if I am scratching up a $400+ knife... See the /u/NickShabazz video on the cult of resale value. Although fwiw my Kershaw leek is still my go to work edc because of how slicey it is
I love my sebenza and I get that Chris reeve helped develop s35vn, but I'd be all over a CRK with m390 
I think it's (technically) legal in Boston too
Since the sebenza and delica have already gotten plenty of mentions, I'll add in the benchmade 485 valet
bog oak master race
Refrigerator handles are the arch nemesis of pocket clips
Hell yeah dude! Welcome to the club
I'd grab it while you have the chance, and for the price you can hardly afford not to
Yep, indeed so!
I'll second this - I've had this wallet for several years and I love it! Sometimes I mix it up but only for the sake of variety.
Ganzo's don't qualify as clones since they aren't trying to pass themselves off as spydercos/benchmades etc. They might be design ripoffs but they are still branding them as Ganzo.
Just when I had talked myself out of the going gear exclusive... 
I use my knives also but this one would be something I'd be more into as a Star Wars fan than as a knife guy
It's not like you'd ever use it anyway... (I certainly wouldn't at least) 
Not in my home state :) 
Not that I'm ever going to buy either, but I just don't like the look of the scales on the wave. So it'd have to be a Neon for me anyway.

(of course, I used to say that I was never going to buy a sebenza either and now I've got one) 
How big is that guy? Looks sweet man! 
Everyone posting their insingo blades lately is really making me want another sebenza... But I would have to sell one of my other knives to afford one and I really like the ones I already have! 

That is the collector's dilemma I suppose
An edc classic! I've got one of the g10 ones coming in the mail from bladehq right now
Nice valet! 
I usually like having a clip for easy access since there are usually other things in the same pocket as my knife. 

For situations where I'm not going to use the clip (athletic shorts, times where I don't necessarily want people to know I have a knife, etc.) I'll just carry a traditional or SAK. 
Hahaha just busting your chops. I also have a lot of Spyderco, benchmade, and victorinox in my own collection.
The one on the right is exceedingly dope
Do you work at a coffee shop? 
You're just saying that because 50% of them are Spyderco 😆
Yeah but the only ones left that I've seen around are in acrylic or wood. I want a nifebrite and maybe a micarta one too... 
I'm feeling queasy just thinking about it... 
Sebenza does mean "work", so maybe it's all the people who baby theirs that aren't doing it right ;) 
Does that model come in S35vn? ;) 
I love my inlaid one but part of me wishes I'd gone with the plain one... There's something elegant about it 
Confirmed
Beer scout and 0450 owner checking in, nice knives my dude
That is one sharp spoon there ;) 
Can't have kershaw putting out better knives than Al Mar themselves now.

I would definitely pay for an upgraded version with a titanium lock side, nicer steel etc. (ZT collab? An 0450 action with Al Mar style, mmm...) but I kinda doubt it'll happen any time soon.
Do you know if that would work on the Nokia 6 as well?
Very nice! I picked up the same one a while back and I am loving it.
Just do it! You know you want to... 
Yeah I'm always on the lookout for cool small knives and this fits the bill. I hope Kershaw releases more stuff with a stock deep carry clip. 
Hmm... Maybe if I win the lottery. Or CRK decides to come out with that flipper 😜
Yeah I am really liking that shield, very nice 
I love CRKT designs and I appreciate the price point but I do wish they would do more mid range stuff 
Ahh my dude I just bought a new knife last week, not fair
If you're not gonna sell it what's the difference?

Disclaimer: have a ZT0450 and love it
Ah, that explains why I didn't recognize it. Are the wood parts dymondwood or regular? Also I just really like that handle shape so many benchmades are too chunky 
Most beer is 😊🍻
Nothing wrong with the classic weber, it's still charcoal
Very nice, what model benchmades are those? 
WASD... X?
Benchmade shinola valet (just the backspacer but it looks nice). 

Or just go all in and get a Spyderco with orange frn scales 
Seconded 🍻
r/beer is that way ->
I don't have one but word on the street is the centering on most (all?) of the CF sebenzas favors the show side a little bit
Very nice looking scales, what are they made out of? 
I had one of those back when I was in the scouts
This as a mini grip + sheepsfoot would be an instabuy for me
What do you use? Just a regular companion or have you got the eldris? 
How are you liking the upgrade?
Choices: damn good. 
If only this knife had the option for tip up carry I'd be all over it
Nice! How's the glow? 
Spyderco pocket saw
My friend is bike mechanic (uses a knife in the duties of his job) and he got arrested in NYC just because the cops saw a pocket clip and stopped him. In contrast, I live in Boston (2.5" blade limit) and I've never been stopped by a cop so they could check my knife
Why drink IPA when you can just drink yinlinz? 
If it's an auto then what's the big hole in the blade for? 
Yeah I was blown away initially by the difference. I'm definitely going to keep the leek around as a beater though! 
No but based on a lot of reviews I felt pretty confident. I probably would've gotten the CF version if it came with an uncoated blade but I'm really liking the g10 so far
spoken like a true gear collector
If you're wondering "what did that poor knife ever do to you?", it belonged to my grandfather and I'm guessing he just sharpened it with whatever was on hand. Even so, it was completely dull when I got it.
More real estate for testing sharpness 😂
Go Green! 
Yeah not much love for combo edges especially but some people swear by fully serrated blades. If you keep em sharp they are competitive with plain edges I think but that can be a bit of a hassle as others have mentioned. 
Yeah I've bent this one back once already, looking for something that's rides a little bit deeper /closer to my pocket so it doesn't get bent out halfway through my shift. I'll definitely be looking into everyone's suggestions - looks like I have a few options. 
What's the difference between this and the 765?
I snagged it on something at work - I work in close proximity with a lot of fridges and things with pokey handles so it seems clips with a lot of clearance like this won't work for me. Which is too bad because I like the way the polished stainless looks 
Hey, there's that g10! I impulse bought one and it's arriving on Monday, can't wait! 
New pattern from GEC maybe? 😆
[Shinola x Benchmade Custom 485 Valet](https://www.shinola.com/benchmade-valet-knife.html)
I love coffee and knives so this will be a no brainer (assuming I can actually get my hands on one)
I've got the same one, fantastic knife :)
Thanks man! (goes without saying that sometimes I rotate knives in my edc ☺️) 
Yeah it's the collaboration version with shinola. I don't know how limited they're going to be but if you're considering the valet I'd definitely pick up this version. 
Yeah it is!

Benchmade includes sharpening as part of their [warranty/Lifesharp program](https://www.benchmade.com/warranty-service)
Loving it so far. The size and deep carry clip are really nice although the axis isn't as free swinging as on my griptilian (although that's partially due to the blade size). I actually like the look of the orange backspacer with the dymondwood, and of course dat m390 😎
Haven't had to sharpen it yet but I'll probably send it back to benchmade when the time comes 
You posting this is not making me want it any less 🙃
My experience has been that you don't like Spyderco until you actually own one
That is smaller than I thought they were, very cool knife though! 
Or a crkt squid for a bit cheaper (although heavier) 
I'm trying to resist buying the new g10 version but it's such a sexy knife... 
[That's the joke](https://imgur.com/utzTCyo)
I don't know much myself, but Birdshot IV and prepared mind 101 on YouTube have some good videos about different neck knives. 
If you had a girl that looked good, would you call her? 
Yeah it is very similar to the spyderco delica
Spyderco is really loving that H1 lately huh
How are you liking the feist? I'm heavily considering picking one up soon
Spyderco my wallet why
Yeah and there's always bladehq if I really start jonesing for it... Just got a BM valet a couple weeks ago so I can be patient :) 
ah dang, too slow!

"just remember, all caps when you spell the man's name" 
so far so good - I really like how small it carries on my belt. Haven't gotten to use it too much yet though.
Almost pulled the trigger on this knife a few times... How do you like it? (especially the maroon micarta) 
My advice would be to start with something budget friendly like a parker jotter or space pen. If you haven't lost it after a few weeks then I'd start looking at something nicer. 
I think that model is 12c27 sandvik 
CRKT squid or pilar are both good choices. The dragonfly is excellent too, but that depends if you like the lockback design (harder to close one handed) 
I got mine off massdrop and it was still about $40
I didn't know that... I just assumed the OEM battery was dead when I got it
I have the original aluminum one which is also great but I got this one with the neutral white LED and I'm loving it so far! 
Normal Al mar is aus 8 which isn't really much better as far as I know
No Gerber shard? ;) 
Any tips for forcing a patina? Or should I just stab it into a lemon for an hour. 
Seems cool but I'd rather pick the refill I like and then buy a pen for it, rather than paying for the ability to fit 80+ different refills when I'm only going to use one.
I understand that the space pen is not a high end writing experience, but the advantage of it is that it will write *anywhere* - for my job, I have to write on a variety of different surfaces, carbon copy paper, and sometimes in the walk-in freezer (-5F to -15F), and the space pen is the only single pen that can fit my needs for all of those conditions.
Lumintop tool AAA. Great little light and cheap. Maratac AAA and thrunite ti3 or similar are good too but I like the Lumintop because it has a tail clicky rather than being twist operated only
Are you able to charge/replace the flashlight battery easily?
How do you like the micarta handle on the beer scout? Been thinking about picking one up
Pomegranate burt's bees is in my top 3 for chapstick /lip balm flavors, good stuff 
Nice, I also EDC a squid and a dime
Thanks! That is a bit steep but I do love my leek... price might be justifiable if I pick up that new CF leek :)
Where can I get one of those / does it fit on a leek? 
I have the [Chrome Mini Buran](https://www.backcountry.com/chrome-mini-buran-laptop-messenger-bag) which I've had for two years and absolutely love. I really like the laptop sleeve. If that's not to your fancy I'd check out some of the other Chrome bags, they are all top quality.

looks like most people here are posting recipes for the 185, here is my method for a single cup in the 155:

17.5g fresh ground coffee, medium grind : 300g water (1:17)

use water right off the boil, rinse & preheat brewer/vessel of course.

bloom w/ 40g water for 25-35 seconds (adjust bloom time based on your individual coffee)

pulse spiral pours to keep brewer relatively full at all times without going over, stop at 300g water 

remove brewer at 3m30s or when done drawing down, whichever happens first (try to dial in grind so draw down is done between 3:00-3:30)

stir! (and then drink & enjoy)
Don't live in NYC but have been to FIKA and can also vouch for coffee being good the times I've had it
just get a chrome bag dawg
I work for a major UK-based coffee chain here in the US and we teach making americanos by pouring espresso on top of the water. Sounds like a local difference.
avenge is leaving standard so secret pally is taking a big hit regardless
unless your local store has a lot of beer snobs shop at it, in which case it's sold out already :P
Dear Chasey Lain, I just wanted to ask...
Must be regional, never heard anyone refer to a long black before here in the states
espresso should be poured on top of hot water for an americano to preserve the crema, traditional cappucino is 1/3 espresso, 1/3 milk, 1/3 foam. otherwise this is mostly correct.
cafe au lait would be made traditionally with french press coffee, although regular drip coffee is commonly substituted here in the US
eh I prefer torps, celebration just seems like an inferior version of SixPoint's Sensi Harvest

yep brew at 1:4 and dilute 1:1 is what I do :)
try a 1:4 ratio, that's what I use and I still consider what I make to be "concentrate". Also I would recommend brewing for a longer time (18-24hrs) at room temperature.
Need to know a little bit more about your recipe to help. Not familiar with costco beans but most people prefer a dark roast for cold brew (although light roasts can also make excellent cold brew). Use a moderately coarse grind but not as coarse as french press. 

What coffee:water ratio are you using?
I think this article had a good point before the author ruined it bumbling about things that aren't important. 

He writes "Has anybody else started to develop a jangling case of nerves as they approach a barista?" yet in my experience baristas are always extremely helpful and friendly towards newcomers - it's the customers who question "what variety of Guatemalan bean suits them the best" and hold up the line that we don't like. 
That website is terrible, why not just put them all on one page rather than make me click 30 times?
I have a pretty good at it and I just have to restart the same time as a barista

- SRM4 quirk makes the most sense if you're using a build similar to this. I rarely run out of ammo and when I do my AC20 is long gone anyway so I'm just a distraction at that point. 3xSRM2 just doesn't give quite enough punch IMO

They also work around this by having different formats with different card legalites, such as t1 vs t1.5 - they use the natural card cycle to nerf/buff - "lightning bolt is too strong, let's print shock instead"

Yah I think /u/SeanLang rocked a HGN-732 build with 3xERLL and 1xLBX10 and it worked really well.
People just want to drive Mad Cats. I think most people are happy with the IS gameplay as is.

I've been reading the books lately and I really do wish they spent more time on the Inner Sphere before jumping into the clans. IS politics are actually quite interesting.

Also, the way the clans are introduced in the books is kind of... mediocre. "Hey, do you think these guys are aliens?" "No, they must be the return of Kerensky's SLDF!". Not a whole lot of suspense built there.
I'm a pretty hardcore MechWarrior fan, been playing MW games since MW2. I've stuck through with this game and really thought (part of me still thinks) it could be great. It has the foundation of a great game, and the whole 3rd person debacle really hasn't affected the game that much. 

But this is just ridiculous. UI 2.0 doesn't even look good. But when I saw the CLANS! link on reddit, I got a boner from excitement. That was immediately killed. To release this sort of thing immediately after Project Phoenix, at such a high price, with CW nowhere in sight... It's getting really hard to defend this game or try to get anyone else into it.

IMO stalkers are somewhat redeemed by high-mounted arm hardpoints, putting them ahead of Awesomes.
3M is probably the best locust, but I would say the 3S is actually worse than the 1V. The 1V is decent against mechs that are already wounded, but there's really nothing you can do with the 3S to get satisfactory damage out of it and neither of them can duel other lights.

Not so much of a sidegrade, unless you're talking specifically about the misery. Which still can't run dual UAC5/LBX10. There are definitive advantages to an Atlas vs. a Stalker.

Life is risky. If you believe it's best to keep your cats inside, that's your business. Honestly, the best case I've heard for keeping cats inside is that they are invasive predators and disrupt local bird populations.
If you want to keep your cats inside, that's fine. But I don't feel that those who wish to have outdoor or indoor/outdoor cats should be vilified. I've had two cats (indoor/outdoor) in my lifetime, one died of cancer at 14 and my current feline is very happy and healthy at age 15.
Yeah, because all outdoor cats die horrible deaths at the hands of coyotes and cars... Oh wait, no they don't.

The different weapon variants just have different stats, they don't have special attributes beyond the numbers you can compare. CQB variants generally have higher ROF and worse recoil, SV variants usually have higher damage but longer ready times, etc.

As for finding a good group to play with, your best bet is to join up with a clan, either through finding someone who communicates well in game, or looking in the clan sub-forum on the official GRO forums.

Can't help you on the headset issue, either put in a support ticket or see if someone on the official forums has had a similar issue.

Unfortunately, as you may be able to tell, this subreddit is quite small and overall under-utilised. 

You won't have as much of a problem with snipers when you learn the maps better, and where they are likely to hide. Don't be afraid to tell your team in voice chat it's time to move up on the point.
Part of the point of this is you don't need a macro, chain firing will give you the exact amount of time needed to avoid the penalty.
Remember Tribes: Ascend?

Pepperidge Farm remembers.
Huh, I assumed it was for coke or pills.
Meh, you can even go to the more rural parts of New Jersey (yes, there are rural parts of New Jersey) and you'll see plenty of confederate flags.
Same reasons the jagermech is good: high mounted arm hardpoints. Allows for much better sniping over hilltops while exposing a minimum amount of your own chassis. True, the treb has more available tonnage but you'll find the low arm hardpoints lead to many more blocked/missed shots than on the BJ

He supports his rankings pretty well, IMO. I don't think he's right on all points, but it's hard to argue tournament-tier mechs since you see pretty much the same variants across all teams that participate in various tournaments.

>Even that isn't enough though - we have doubled the GXP conversion rate to get you elited in your new Mech all the faster!

Hero boost only affects c-bills, not XP. If you have some extra MC, converting excess into GXP during a 2x conversion time (like this weekend) is worthy.
Bought it right after it came out, totally worth.
Sneak up on battles between the other two empires and snipe at both sides :}}}
The more important question is when does the NS sniper rifle come out?
and I used to have a friend tell me it was better to bind spacebar to shoot so your aim didn't move when you fired. 

It may be all well and good for sniping but for run and gun I find that toggle just gets in the way more often than not.
Toggle just seems so much more clunky in general...

The audio is extremely quiet, you should see about making it louder for future videos.

Haven't seen a Misery running an AC20 myself, but it looks like a solid build.
Sniper build is definitely viable as well, but I prefer the 5J with PPC's and JJ's for sniping (Although the Blackjack is arguably the better medium jump sniper now).

One thing they have been very faithful to is era-specific variants.

Meh, I generally dislike going to a game's official forums. I prefer reddit for a number of reasons. If anything, the removal of GD will only make this subreddit more active and I'd prefer to just come here.
Yep, I had a lot of fun playing it for a while, and then I kind of just... stopped. MWO and Planetside 2 may have something to do with it, but Tribes wasn't getting the same level of attention.

Pretty sure that must be a TBT-7M you're talking about, 5J has 5 energy and only 1 missile hardpoint.
So it's essentially about not wanting to wait two seconds for normal fullscreen. Unless you really really need to check reddit in the middle of a battle, I really don't see this as a big issue. I understand that they should fix it as it is a bug but it seems extremely low priority to me.
Ok right but what's the problem with using normal fullscreen mode?
So what exactly is the problem with just using normal fullscreen then? Waiting two seconds for the game to restore?

It was a lot better than the LMG, then they did the recoil update, now the reg LMG is better. The cycle of buffs and nerfs continues...
Indeed, sometimes it's better to give it to top lane (on blue side anyway).

It definitely depends on the champions, and if I was playing a heavy mana/gank jungler like maokai I would be more likely to take the second blue.
depends both on the jungle and mid champions. If it's a lux or anivia or something like that mid, almost everytime. Most junglers don't really need blue after the first clear, although if I'm playing maokai or amumu and it's a  less CDR/mana dependent mid then I would take second blue.

I'd rather have the mid have enough mana to get the kill over me having to back an extra time.
There are exceptions of course, see my [reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1c4l05/lucidity_boots_20_cdr/c9czt08) to /u/Zerthin
Obviously there are exceptions, and I'd probably take it/give it to toplane if the mid is manaless as well.

But if I think they've got a good chance of surviving the duration of the buff I will definitely give it to them (barring madred's proc/red buff snafu's)
junglers who want to win give their mids blue buff.

You probably want to upgrade to DHS but not endo, stalkers notoriously run hot.

SSRM's are OK but since they're in the arm, you can get by with SRM2's for a ton lighter. For ballistics, AC/20, UAC/5 and Gauss are probably the best choices.

AMS is not designed to completely counter missiles (see: ECM), but rather reduce damage from LRM's when you can't get into cover. No, it will not save you from multiple barrages of LRM20's, but yes, it does help enough to be worth 1.5 tons on some mechs.
I predict you break your no MC rule when the hero Cicada comes out.

You wouldn't end up using every 'Mech even if you did have them all - some will be your favorites and others will be forgotten.

A game like Skyrim is finished when it comes out, and doesn't require additional work. If they do decide to add more content, it comes in the form of paid DLC/expansions ($45 for all the currently available Skyrim DLC on Steam). Otherwise, they can go ahead and get started with Elder Scrolls VI whenever they want. PGI will to continually support MWO as long as it is financially viable for them. 


Let me put out a scenario here for you:
The total cost for Skyrim+DLC is $105 if you don't get it on sale. All of the currently available hero 'Mechs are $130, and bays for every mech are another $86, totaling $216 (rounded to the nearest USD). After that, only 350 hours stand between you and all the content in the game, less if you use your hero 'Mechs a lot. 

Most people aren't going to play that much. But most people aren't going to buy all the hero 'Mechs and mechbays for every mech. Some people will, sure, but they have to make up for the completely free players as well. The average paying player might buy a hero 'Mech and some mechbays, along with a sweet phranken pattern for his Cataphracts. Some nice content that will keep you going for a while. So maybe $50-$60 now, and then another $30 when the clan invasion starts for a Timber Wolf and an Urbanmech bobblehad. Many people buy even less than that, and choose to grind most of the content they want. To me, $105 for Skyrim doesn't sound that cheap anymore.
hah yeah the outfit alone reminded me of "Show Me Your Genitals"
They absolutely took beta feedback and sometimes were too hard with the nerf bat (i.e. infiltrators not getting shotguns, but SMGs are OK now). 

I won't make an extensive argument as to the niche for the skyguard, since several good ones have already been posted. It will suffice to say that in it's current state the skyguard still fills the niche of mobile AA and is a very good support fire unit in an armor column.
Skyguard was incredibly OP then, which led to it being nerfed (*maybe*) a little too hard. However, currently air and AA are relatively balanced now compared to beta, so I wouldn't expect many buffs any time soon.
OP was clearly not in the beta
probably used to LoL where the reddit is actually more informative than the website.
Hindus still got their panties in a twist
Meh even just ghostcapping will net you at least 20 an hour.
neon phranken ftw
yeah but it was kind of made redundant/obsolete for most champs with the reworked black cleaver.
because the game would always freeze during the elevator sequences in ME1
I think the most useful modules for general use are sensor range and target info gathering. 

360 targeting is useful on brawlers, not so much on snipers. Target decay is the reverse.

Adv. Zoom probably needs a buff, it's not much better (and arguably worse in some cases) than the standard 3x zoom.

Capture assist is nice if you play a light or a lot of conquest but otherwise I would recommend using your GXP elsewhere first.
nice, thanks.
Has this been confirmed?
Maybe this will shut up some of the people that say PGI never listens.
Giraffe camo matching set is 1500sc exactly.
Temperate chaparral  is also definitely improved
I also got "surface to air" xp when I crashed my reaver into a liberator this morning.
only because everyone's tanks get blown up first.
>you shouldn't have to go to the internet to gain access to basic game info

clearly you've never played minecraft.
I wouldn't exactly call it p2w, but the prices are a bit high for both in-game and real currency. 

Infantry plays pretty well with the default weapons for most factions, but stock vehicles get left in the dust by upgraded ones.
He's not in that bad of a spot, he just has weird scaling (i.e. scales with almost every stat just not particularly well with most of them) and his Q probably needs to be looked at. If they also buff his jungle clear time I won't complain, but he's pretty strong vs. melee top lanes.
I've seen this happen before with Cho'Gath and Alistar's knockup as well.
Silt striders, bro.
Yeah, but *usually* they don't release the champion spotlight unless the champion will be available in the next 24 hours.
I set it to all regions and everything, still no match after like 10 minutes :/
Makes MWO's matchmaker problems not seem as bad :P
misread that as 3633... my bad.
Nope, you got that backwards. Battlemaster is unseen ~~and isn't produced until 3068~~, Mauler would be 100% OK for MWO.
True, but I mostly end up with a SSRM2 for anti-light weaponry since the thing is so slow. I think the IM makes up for that with the arm-mounted laser and being faster.

Maybe I should try putting the LRM5 back in my 4X
>if somebody lands on a property and doesn't buy it

when does that ever happen?
I think camo patterns should at least be permanent unlocks for that variant
Considering most griefers probably just use trial mechs anyway...
I wish we could have marauders :(
heh, looks like my 4X will be all but obsolete... I knew I should've got the 2x first...
unless you've never bought MC, in which case they're bugged.
This is happening to me as well, on both hunchback with PC gamer skin and Cataphract with default
what does that have to do with anything? (assuming you are talking about  PC specs)
Even if there are a million potential mac users, that's only a 3% increase compared to the PC user base.
>wahhh organized teams are ruining this team game that we want to play solo!

League of Legends deals with this problem by having separate queues for solo/duo and full teams (for ranked matches at least). MWO would benefit from something similar - sometimes it's easier/faster to just play solo than getting a group together only for 1-2 games.
Must be something about the 670 -  my friend gets around 30fps with an i7 and a 670, yet my theoretically inferior i5/560 system gets 60fps. 
True, although I mainly run the 4SP so a lost side isn't as detrimental to firepower, and it makes a decent zombie. You're probably right about the "normal" hunchies however.
IMO giving up the 2 SRM6's is too big a hit for firepower unless you're putting in LRMs. I put a 240 engine in mine and that gives me enough space for 2 SRM6, 5 MLAS & AMS. Gotta be somewhat careful with heat, but it shouldn't be a problem if you space out your laser blasts. Not as fast but if I wanted a faster medium I'd drive a cent.
I don't think XL engines are that good on hunchies, since your side torso will almost always get focused.
the cooldown on W is fine, seeing as you can reduce it by hitting enemies with E. More damage from shadow hits and some small energy cost reductions are all he needs.
you give up too much damage if you get frozen mallet, and honestly chasing shouldn't be an issue - you should be killing them before they get a real chance to run.
His clear times are actually really fast since E has such a low cooldown, and his ganks are passable once you hit 6, it's really just the lack of sustain that makes him sub-optimal.

That build looks like it would work just as well for top lane, although in either case I would only get 1-2 doran's.
perhaps they should release hero mechs initially for MC only, but allow C-bill purchase after a period of time and people who bought them with MC have had a chance to enjoy some exclusivity.
yeah but single player was the best part of those games anyway. That's what I played em for anyway. Jedi Outcast multiplayer on the other hand... things got crazy.
meh, I've played every other MW game with a joystick but I had no problem switching over to mouse for this one.
Ziggs also has better AA range than several AD carries. 
It's got pretty good range, but not as far as you can get with, say, Jarvan or Lee Sin. Might be interesting to see a comparison vs. Shen.
Seems to have broken for me, was working perfectly before but now it's back to showing me the new theme
>Making the old theme the default would kill off the new theme in a heartbeat.

Good.
mods are pretty much ignoring the fact that its shitty and only responding to people who "like" it.
Why are you only responding to people who like the new theme? [This comment](http://dd.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/12yoim/the_official_subreddit_theme_feedback_thread/c6z8yf6) has been at the top for some time now and makes good, constructive points, yet you refuse to reply to it.
The old one wasn't intrusive. This one is in-your-face ugly.
It's garish and hard to read for longer than 30 seconds. It also messes with RES and makes it hard to tell who replied to who. The font is terrible, the header looks like it was done by a 15 year old in his free period, and most of all the old style was much more readable and fitting.
Great, maybe now you can reply to some of the comments that actually got upvoted.
Great, now give us the old theme back.
At least give us the old theme back as an option. It was nice and minimal yet effective.
Please bring the old style back, it was much cleaner/nicer. The new one is overdone, garish, and hard to read. And put the logo back on the left! 

Who designed this, a 5th grader?
Please bring the old layout back, at least as an option. The new one is garish and hard to read.
Still no evacuation? What's that, 3 months delayed now? 

I think all the devs are playing Planetside2
they are good but have incredibly steep range fall-off. However, close range you can get a OHK with a headshot. The shotgun is considered to be a top 3 secondary along with the machine pistol and revolver.

The Sar-k is fun but overall the regular shotgun is better due to its faster kill time, but what secondary you choose should also be dictated by your primary for that loadout.

edit: corrected sidearm to secondary
Orianna's shield does do damage. I also don't see you complaining about Leona's W.
>I prob WONT post EVERY game on this reddit. I will be doing a highlight video every 10 games or so and once the series is a little more established i'll just post the Highlight video on here with links to each individual game

so don't. people might be more willing to watch if you condensed the content a little. People want stellar gameplay and/or insightful commentary. Pretty much everyone that's on this subreddit knows what   level 1-10 is like.
not bad, but might be more useful if you used the stock AR vs. the HAR (I know that HAR spread is more predictable, but everyone has the AR).
Also echoes of AP sion
You always need 1 slot for the crowbar
dude, punctuation is your friend.
Agree with everything except that Toxic nade can be extremely useful for area denial in Domination and KOTH - it will also kill players inside hardsuits. Overall an explosive nade is more effective, but if you can have both a tox nade is great situationally.
It's more challenging since everyone is on a higher level of precision as well. Although if I could play BF3 vs. console players I probably would clean house.
Gonna be straight with you: most people here are probably interested in watching higher-level play, not noobs stomping other noobs.
I specifically named genres in which a mouse/keyboard control scheme is superior. You're implying that consoles actually have "strengths" over PC in some areas, what are they?
A (proper) mouse is much, MUCH more precise than a thumbstick. I didn't have a rumble pak growing up so I can't say I especially miss it. You actually AIM better with a thumbstick? While dealing with acceleration and the like? I doubt it. Not to mention the fact you only have your thumbs rather than your entire hand, a mouse is much easier to control accurately and precisely.
Until consoles can be operated with a mouse and keyboard, they will *always* be inferior for some gametypes, most notably MMOs and FPS's.
The LMG is somewhat of a niche weapon and better used when you are in position beforehand and able to crouch. Even with the lowest possible recoil, its real advantage is high damage and being able to put a lot of lead in the air, not accuracy.

If you like the HAR, use it. I personally prefer the standard AR, but it is a good weapon if you get used to it. You also have to be more careful with ammo, of course.

Have you tried the burstfire rifle? I have mine down to .01 ADS spread (with tag) and the recoil is less than a comparable assault rifle. Not as satisfying in the way the LMG is, but more versatile and highly accurate.
You can try the [manual patch](http://blacklight-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php?t=404911).
remember that all Star Wars movies are rated PG except for Episode III, which is only PG-13. 

Just remember to never enable g_saberrealisticcombat when you play Jedi Outcast.
Personally I found the killhouse pretty mediocre due to its odd scope and high spread, but I am also comparing that to my custom BFR. Shotgun is a shotgun, although it would be nice if it had the foregrip.
try entering it manually after you set up your raptr account
The shotgun is nice since it has the express mags, but the BFR is pretty lackluster - it has more spread than a stock BFR, and it just feels generally inaccurate (Maybe because I'm used to my .01 spread bfr). I also don't like the scope on it much, but that's preference.
None of the "new" receivers can be GP-permed yet either, even though HAR has been out for some time. Do not underestimate the greed of PWE.
I believe they actually started out with Vin Diesel, but people know Chuck Norris better.
I see plenty of people doing well with light builds, and it's quite helpful to have a light or two on your team for CTF. Light builds are widely regarded as being underpowered, but certainly not useless. 

Also, a lot of people use SMG builds that do less than 50dmg - the ROF more than makes up for it. The 50dmg number is good when a lot of people are running around with the default build, but when more people have over 200hp, it's going to take 5 shots most of the time anyway - and almost no one runs a full 250hp, 222 and 242hp are the most common builds I see.

What the game really needs is some form of matchmaking.
Pretty sure it's a heavy Hellboy reference as well.

edit: it's definitely a hellboy reference, for the haters: [ [Galio's Gatekeeper] skin resembles Hellboy, a hero from Dark Horse Comics, due to his red skin, giant fists, demon horns, and chonmage hairstyle. His wings are the only contradiction to the likeness of Hellboy.](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Galio_the_Sentinel's_Sorrow/SkinsTrivia)


Vayne's tumble already has this. Broken wings does NOT follow your cursor, Valor does. Broken wings will go either towards an enemy that you have your cursor over, or will go in the **direction Riven is facing** if you do not highlight an enemy. These abilities all have short ranges, and since you want to use them quickly a range indicator is really not necessary.
I think you mean [Jareth, Leonine Titan](http://magiccards.info/scans/en/on/43.jpg).

I feel old :/
It does seem odd that they seemingly wanted him to be a caster/carry, but only gave him the tools to be an AD. 
so he's basically a more badass volibear with a talon-esque ultimate. awesome.
I'm gonna go with man-bear-tiger.
I think Twisted Fate really needs it more, both his spells and model look really out of date next to champions like Jayce and Diana.
Try playing on one of the harder difficulties, where almost every enemy gains armor.
more people are noticing how strong he is now, I hope they don't buff him into becoming FOTM. We'll never get to have a SSoHP.
you used that trollface too early. Who's that Taric? dude looks pro as hell
Fizz is strongest when played AP mid, with an emphasis on ganking. He has strong re-positioning skills; but since he needs to be in melee range to deal almost all of his damage, he requires good timing with these skills to stay alive and be effective. 

Lich Bane is generally considered to be a core item on him, since he needs to auto-attack as well as his Q applying on-hit effects. The movement speed is also nice, as mobility is one of Fizz's greatest assets. Rod of Ages used to be built often on him, but has fallen out of favor since it delays your lich bane - players now usually prefer 2-3 Doran's rings. Zhonya's Hourglass, Rabadon's Deathcap, and Guardian Angel are other items worth considering. 

His ultimate is a very strong ganking tool and is extremely effective at picking a target off - just take care to actually hit someone with it. 

He's not played as much because melee champions generally have trouble farming against ranged opponents, but he does well against mages that are reliant on skillshots or that can be assassinated quickly. He also does quite well against Vladimir in lane due to his healing debuff.  Ryze is often considered to be one of Fizz's worst matchups due to his instant, targeted CC and lack of skillshots. 

Overall Fizz is a strong champion who's also fun to play, and I recommend everyone try him out!
Drummers still get plenty of chicks. It's the bassists that are poor and lonely.
Be aggressive early. Vlad won't be able to trade effectively with Riven if you can get up close to him. Don't let him passively farm, because once Vlad gets lv9 the matchup will be much harder.
