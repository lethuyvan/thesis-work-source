To be entirely fair to Saints Row 1, The (what four?) times your character spoke were well worth the price of the average game play.

Overkill themselves said if you 'care about the game' to get it on PC. Being 'behind' on updates and DLC isn't a small thing for this game. I remember the outrage over the 360 and PS3 not receiving updates, and then the outrage over the Crimewave edition, then the outrage over the skins. 

No man, This isn't a good holdover game. There are far better uses for $40 than this. If you literally need to buy something to bridge the gap until Smash or Octopath, fold forty one dollar bills into paper airplanes, and throw them at cashiers while you buy smoothies. The game works best with four players, on a single team, and if you've convinced four people to buy an outdated version of a roughly five year old game, you could've pooled that money and done something much better with it.

If you cannot live without Payday 2, get the PC version. If you cannot get the PC version, you can live without Payday 2.
Which 20% is this one?
Also, If that doesn't somehow dissuade you, the game is considerably less fun in single player and since most people are going to be steering clear of it, it most likely won't have a large playerbase. You won't have $40 worth of fun with this game alone.
I'd ask over at /r/carAV if you don't have experience but are trying to do something fun.

The Kona is... a Kona. I don't hate it. It looks like what I would imagine if you said "Think of a generic crossover."

It's not good looking. It's not ugly. It's alright, if a little goofy. Like the Veloster's younger, more mature brother; It still looks weird, the whole family does, but he seems to have it together so no ill will.

The Life Aquatic and Isle of Dogs.

I won't post any spoilers for Isle of Dogs, since it's still in theaters but the ending is like one long gentle sob.

Oh, And the part where E.T. makes the bikes fly. My son jumped up and shouted when it happened and it was like being a kid again for a spilt second and suddenly becoming a jaded adult. The most bittersweet cheer I've ever heard.

Not about culpability, he stated the wrong way vehicle was on fire. Removing the driver from the fire and attempting to get some distance in that case is a good idea. You should probably know how to properly drag a body but accidentally paralyzing someone while saving them from burning to death is considered the lesser of two bad choices.

But, I mean, fuck that guy. I hope he lives so he can face justice for his stupidity. Ending up on the wrong side of the freeway is a mistake. Driving at speed down the wrong side is fucking heinous.

A camera that indiscriminately captures images of cars for a private company to issue fines (and have been tampering with safe yellow light timings) is obviously going to catch more flak than a personal device that holds other drivers accountable for being shitty.
To be totally fair, muti-turning lane streets where at least two vehicles have to turn left, even protected, are a butthole clencher. The amount of times people are just like "Fuck it, I'm gonna turn into THIS lane!" and don't even care that my car already occupies that space is amazing.

To be fair, I fucking wish my numpad had the small single zero and plus sign, so I could get that sweet double zero and backspace. That's the two things that keep making me consider an 87 key with a 22 on the side.

I mean, the fact that I used to use those printing calculators has nothing to do with my fondness for the ten key... Just Sid Meier's Pirates.
I think there's many people who watch Jon for many different reasons. Some want to see the games he plays (Early Total War access), some want to watch him play games (and comment early and often to correct him), and some want to listen to him and the gameplay is somewhat inconsequential (except for occasionally yelling at my TV). Of course, This list isn't representative of everyone, but Jon engages his comment section and listens to their advice some times (often not though) so people are more inclined to comment.

Also, It's fun to just yell at Jon sometimes.

Dennis and Mac will manage to lose it all before the end of episode 1, only for Frank to get it back somehow for Charlie to invest it all in a full month of studio time for a live-action, animated Dayman series only to have no actors (Dee will volunteer, the gang will jeer), cinematographers (Mac will mention Project Badass, Dennis will go 'Ehh'), or scripts (but Mac and Charlie will say they did a great job with Crime Stinks)

Episode three will have Dee ask when she's getting featured, Everyone will call Dee a bird. The gang will move on.

It will be fair to think the technology will exist but in 20 years time, but there's still 1995 Honda Accords driving around. I don't think widespread adoption of such a wildly different tech will have such a quick adoption time.

'Ultra-High-end' users will be whipping out their fold-able portable phablets, and running Mac ads saying 'What's a TV/Computer/Phone?", perhaps even in the next 20 years but at the same time, my mother doesn't understand how I live without cable. I don't understand why she does. I don't think I could feasibly expect a transition so radical to happen on a moderately small timescale.
Hmm. Thought it was mete but I googled it and it said it was 'met'. Oh well, thanks for the correction!
Well, It's transparent, so you can see what's behind the water mark. You've got the true color right next to certain parts of the the water mark, so you can just stamp that over a bit. Faces might be a bit tougher but, again, you have the actual image right there and a good amount of skin tone references for each person.

It takes some time, but you can 'recreate' the image using the reference behind it, just with colors that match the colors outside the water mark.
> It doesn't make sense to own a tablet, a laptop, a smartphone, a desktop, a tv and an e-reader,

Tablet, Laptop, Smartphone, and e-reader all overlap in similar ways but a TV and Desktop have less overlap. 

You could argue that the Desktop could be replaced with a dock for the Laptop but you'd still need a large display for it. A laptop (or anything else) with a display large enough to replace a TV (For an American household) would be too gigantic to bring with you anywhere and currently heat management is too poor to imagine replacing my Desktop with anything or to imagine carrying anything that hot with me.

Once better battery solutions exist, I could understand replacing tablet, smartphones, and e-readers with a single device and once heat gets under control replacing desktops with high powered laptops but TVs as dumb displays are going to exist.
I played GTA IV on my 360 first and beat the whole thing, I used to love getting a Mustang knock off (I hated that they removed customization) and just drifting through traffic effortlessly.

I don't terribly mind the idea of loot boxes as a whole but the miscommunication over how you can attain the cookies for bells (12/24 hr cycles which most likely won't be the 'good' ones) and general randomness that applies to the double/triple randomness (The 'good' cookies show up, you get trash) doesn't give any option BUT sinking leaf tickets into it.

Plus, The whole point of the game is collecting furniture. People are going to want complete sets. You can effectively play Rocket League or Overwatch without ever opening a loot box because they don't truly matter but if you're not collecting furniture in AC, what are you even doing?

I'm not going to shout Pay to Win from the roof tops, but I also hated the randomness of the Scamblers and Butterflies. Besides, the Star and Flag pole were how many tickets combined?

Side Note: I also trash on Fashion Wars 2 for having loot box mount skins and still haven't purchased them to this day.

> you getting angry over it won't change that fact.

What part of "I find it weird" even remotely sounds angry? I mean, Dismissive, yeah but angry? Although Lego may make sets marketed towards adults (I still want to pick up that Mini Cooper) I don't think I've ever seen something official acknowledging AFOL. It is a known term, and commonly accepted in the community, but ***I*** find it an odd distinction to make.

This is obviously a judgement, and one only based on personal preference, but if someone says "I enjoying building Lego sets" I get a different feeling than if they say "I'm an AFOL" or "I'm an Adult Fan Of Lego"
> And what better way to try something out than buying a physical copy which I can trade/sell if I don't like it?

An inflated price of a 'limited edition' run of a game that might just be okay seems... iffy. You could just look at gameplay online and be turned off enough to know that Grant's great tunes are put to poor use here.
> The only hate I've seen was the annoying noises and the performance issues.

It took me 19 hours to 100% the game. I think 3 of those were searching down the really hidden collectables. I was fine with the noises, Had no performance issues, but the gameplay was so-so and the levels were super disjointed meaning it didn't have the character of Banjo-Kazooie.

Ah shit. Sorry, got caught up. I don't hate the game, I'm just super disappointed.
> non-issue ones

10,000 non-issue bugs become an issue when your games get a reputation for being buggy messes. Also, Plenty of modders have plenty of QA (Having personally worked on non-ES5 mods) and mod QA comes in the form of downloaders who encounter problems. Bethesda's paid employees have left plenty of major issues bugged in the game, leaving some people with utterly broken games (Mainly the 360 and PS3 versions) with no recourse.

DAE Bethesda can do no wrong, Skyrim on TI-84 plz.
> They're explicitly criticizing the sausage machinery though, which they know nothing about. 

I think plenty of people on reddit and abroad know more about the engine than you give them credit for. While I will agree that often we see a bug (or several thousand) and meme "Bethesda can't code" which... Is true. "The engine tracks a lot!" does not excuse their really shoddy code which can be fixed by the community tools (and not even extensive developer ones) that they themselves release.

That being said, I enjoy hearing that their are upsides to the engine that I often didn't think about, though at the same time it proves that an uninspired developer could simply slap down vault pieces and be like, "Yeah, whatever, door, door, door, room, and done" which makes the care that went into F:NV's vaults even nicer.

Player's don't care about the engine, they care about the game. Most people will take a well-rounded car with doors and AC over a stripped down frame with a V8 and a racing harness. So when you think of players critiquing animations, VOs, or generally bugginess that Bethesda games are chock with, the 'outdated' engine exacerbates those problems.
> Also, adults who are into Lego have their own specific category, AFOL. 

So, Well start using the same identifier for Adult Fans of Labdo, okay? Besides, As an adult who has gone to plenty of Lego conventions and builds a bunch with my son, I find the AFOL label weirder than just enjoying Legos.

Today they're putting together 'basic cardboard toys, designed to be simple for children' but tomorrow when someone makes a Labdo car or something, will you accept that adults can like things too? There's nothing wrong with building a cardboard robot and being psyched that you put it together right. I mean, IKEA Beds, Computers, Legos, and Labdo are all really simple to put together (IKEA Beds may require more physical strength than the others but instructions are cut and dry) but man if it doesn't feel good.

Look, If you own a Switch, you've got no room to tell other people how 'adult' they should be when buying their games or building their cardboard robots. You have to sit and home, read the newspaper, and constantly have a tumbler of Whiskey for that level of judgement.

Anecdotally, Most of the White people I know who voted Republican live over in Forney, or generally anywhere outside of Dallas county and the Republicans I know in Dallas County didn't vote because they thought Trump was 'too much'. Granted, This is a sample size of like... 13 people so it's completely non-descriptive of Dallas County but I was psyched that Dallas went Blue.
Well, Yes, I know. My bro explained the major story links to me since I remembered Firelink from the intro. One day when I'm gud enuf it'll finally all make sense but until that point, It's just an amazing action game with some rather infuriating phantoms invading me constantly.
I never got huge into Dark Souls. I couldn't get very far in the first one without a bunch of help from my buddy, and eventually he bought me DS2 as well. Couldn't get past the Pursuer, put the game down and never came back.

Cue my brother buying me DS3 to play with him, and I was racked with guilt. Put down DS1, 2, and just jump to 3? I know the story isn't that linked but still. So I went back and I played DS2 until I was able to cheese past all the bosses. Then I beat NG+. Then I did NG++ (Just to get the final miracles for the last achievement.)

I may not have 500 hours, probably closer to 80~90 but damn if it didn't make me grow up a little bit. I finished off The Dark Soul achievement in DS2 and I'm working on it in DS2:SotFS as well as playing DS3 with my bro. We don't get to play together often but my brother and I just beat that Chalice King Bitch dude (Finally).

When the DS1 remaster comes out, I'm going to pick it up again and get to dying. It's strange how relaxing the game became after... Well, Shit, I don't know what changed about the game for me... Probably Great Soul Arrow.
Well, If they hadn't released it, it would've never been bad.

Basically repeats what the data from my Accent shows. Assuming the tank is 11.9 US Gal as reported and there are 12 notches on my gas gauge, the light comes on for the last notch which would be roughly one gallon and it commonly takes 10.x Gal to fill after the light. Though based on my driving habits, the light will sometimes come on with ~'38 miles' remaining on the range. Though one quick acceleration will get it to show ---.
Well, As another angle, my son loves the game and all he does is die basically. It's cute, it's really easy, and it's a simple game. I don't get frustrated by anything and I don't mind putting down the controller and chilling while he figures out how to jump into a cannon for five minutes.

Crows not a bad spot but we hit up the Perot afterwards, so we just parked down there and walked back up.

While you're not wrong, I think it's funny that you were -1 when I saw this.

I mean, Just like those crappy interpolation 120hz TVs weren't 120hz, This *isn't* 4k. Does it look great? Yes. Does it look better than 1080p? Yes. But the hardcore push back of "They said 4k wouldn't ever happen on consoles!" I mean, It's not in this case. It's impressive. The tech they've used, and the dynamic resolution stuff will no doubt improve gaming immensely, but this isn't a case of moving the goal posts since they were never reached.

End of the day, Graphics don't matter above all else and RE7 is a great game at 1080p, the same as it is at 1260p, and the same as it is at 2160p. However, 1260p 'upscaled' is not 4k. I mean, I have a 4k TV hooked up to my PC and still play games in 1080p60. It's not like I'm watching Planet Earth II, I'm gaming.

> I would prefer not to have to fight in a civil war against the actual army

Well, that's part of the problem too. Since the Army is comprised of U.S. Citizens, many of whom both agree and disagree with the president, I can't see how order would be maintained. If the Army is ordered to march on protestors expressing their second amendment right against a tyrant, I'm certain at least a few Soldiers would lay down arms or even join in.

If the president (who can't even understand a war crime) tries to give an order, can it be rejected as an unlawful order? Can the president even attempt to use the Army (Federal troops) on U.S. soil against U.S. citizens?

When the second map was revealed, I was both excited because I had a ton of new roads to explore instead of the same five from before, and disheartened because I was hoping the game would be over soon.

I actually really liked the game (it kept me company on a few 24 hr shifts), I enjoyed feeling sick from malaria in the middle of a firefight, I liked the guns breaking at just the wrong moment (except, you could just grab fresh 100% conditions in the gun shop every time you passed), and so on but it was just SOOOOO LONG. The respawning outposts were so over done.

But the fire tech. Man, just getting bored and finding new ways to kill those dudes. That was where it was at. Setting up IED traps for convoys, Using the stealth sniper to sneak close enough to lay IEDs all over the place. Actually, I just really liked the IEDs. Sucks the AI was omniscient.
The uPlay overlay lags any game it pops up over for me...

Can't disable it for uPlay games, so I have to have notifications turned off. Everyone has to contact me through outside sources, mainly steam and TeamSpeak so I have no real reason to even run it, except for needing it for Siege.

Meaning uPlay provides me no function except another layer of bullshit.

As an aside, I use GOG Galaxy, Steam, Discord, TeamSpeak, etc. I have enough "overlays" in my life. Origin feels more compitent than uPlay, and the Blizzard launcher is basically an Overwatch updater. uPlay fails to bring anything novel to the table and is therefore redundant and irritating.

> If say GTA required you to hold Square or X To get out of a car

To be fair, GTA uses it in some unique ways though. Y (or Triangle) will have you pull the door handle, Holding Y will break the window right away. If you're in a hurry, (e.g. running from the cops) just break the window right off the bat, car alarms be damned. If you're not, look for one that's unlocked so you don't attract attention.

While driving, Y does nothing but if you hold it, you'll dive out of the car at speed.

"Hold X to open door" "Hold Y to pick a lock" are worse where GTA (At least the Online) has some actual hacking minigames and stuff that you usually do in place of simple QTE distractions.
While an interesting take, I always thought of it as a 'shortcut to awesome'

Take this with a grain of salt, but this has been stewing with me since 'Wet"

For older games, Often times the actions were simple. In Mario, you press A to jump, anything awesome that happens is usually in relation to your ability to press A well. As games got bigger, we expected bigger visuals so now instead of just making cool jumps, you have to take out an entire panzer division alone. They're obviously (for good reasons) not going to put a surgeon simulator minigame in the middle of Far Cry's battlefields so that you can revive your partner, but for a game mechanical sense the revive can't be 'free' other wise you just tap them on the shoulder (ala RE 5, and 6) and the 'death' becomes trivial. They can't just have it be an interact with an unskippable removal of control (Gamers will complain about the 'arbitrary wait times' for actions to complete) so what's the answer? Force interaction.

Hold X to push this box, mash x to open doors, press the crouch button rapidly to say hello to your squad mate. All of the 'context sensitive' actions usually have little relation to the buttons you're pressing (Mash your side arm button in a spectacle slasher game to move this lever) but they force interaction.

QTEs are the absolute laziest way to make a character do cool stuff (We need to show the player that Chris is a badass, pressing both triggers to dodge a boulder sounds great!) but the hold button method is like 'You can let go of this at anytime!' so it feels more involved than QTEs. In multiplayer/competitive games it's an actual tactical choice, but in Single player modes/games I feel its a cover for 'We don't know how to make all these actions make sense so just hold X'

I had Call of Duty 3 on the Wii and there was a level when you plant explosives you had to screw in the det cap and press the plungers by making motions with the Wii remotes. This made setting explosives feel like setting explosives. On the Xbox, you hold X to set, hold X to boom. QTEs are in place to make you do things that the engine usually doesn't allow, (and I really hate to draw this comparison) whereas games like Mario Odyssey and Breath of the Wild give you a tool set and allow you to create 'awesome' moments by interacting with the game while, for the most part, not removing direct control of the characters actions.

**Tl;Dr: These Micro-QTEs force your perspective to make you feel like you're doing things, instead of just wasting time holding a button.**

P.S. Don't play Wet. It's a silly movie with a lot of button presses over all the cutscenes.
I mean, Cave Story was $40. The 'Switch Tax' meme is just a recognition of certain Switch games (no matter how deserving of the price) being considerably more expensive.

Or, Shantae Half Genie hero is $19.99 on Steam right now. The Switch version is $39.99. Just because the prices have not been released, does not mean we cannot voice concerns about pricing trends.
Plus, I could much easier recommend walking sims like this (that are already cheaper on Steam) on PC since they're not intensive or competitive. If this gets Switch taxed, it probably won't sell great. Assuming at least a quarter of the Switch owners are dual PC-Switch players.
The thing that kills Firewatch for me (recommending it, I don't really care to buy it again right now) is the Switch tax. If it's digital only, it might get through fine but as it was pretty short at release prices, and doesn't have much replay-ability, so if it has a physical release you could at least resell it.

She's pissing in folk's apple juice. Literally and Figuratively. The only help he can get her is having her committed.
It is disingenuous to claim that it 'requires' it though, which hot on the heels of the air filter comment I was more just irritated at them.
I had a quick lube place tell me my air filters needed replacement when I went in. I told them I had literally just replaced them before coming in. They said "Are you sure? They're dirty." so I just said "Are you throwing them in for free?" which they scoffed at. Like, don't try to rip me off unless you're giving me free shit dog.

Also, they told me my engine required fully synthetic oil. I asked why to which they replied "It says GDi on the engine." I mean, Synthetic is better but the manual calls for 5w20, not synthetic.

But, if there has to be a panicking regulatory state that drags the U.S. as a whole kicking and screaming into a clean future, then I'm okay with that and will proudly wear that warning on my forehead.

Heck, I let my phone ring one time for like a minute, turned it off after killing the two dudes who rushed me, then stayed in the same spot until the third guy assumed I had to have moved and got him last. It worked opposite that time.

Then again, sometimes I get to turning off the phone and an enemy rushes in to kill me since my team mate decided when I said "Turning off my phone, cover me" to look directly at me instead of the doorway.
Since GOG is well curated, I don't mind release posts. It's not like there's forty indie-pixelart-roguelike-metroidvania-VNs being released every day.

You know what? You're not an asshole.

If the first man had said "Hey, this lady needs your seat" then you both scooted past each other or something then fine. He didn't help or tell the driver to wait a second or anything. If we're assuming the elderly person was nearly invalid (as they didn't or couldn't say anything themselves) and needing his care then he needs to be vocal to allow others to assist him and provide extra time for things to get done.

Then, this woman in the front apparently watched this all go down and was cool with not telling the driver that you were trying to get off. "Hey, Driver, Hold up." she could've said and bam, situation again resolved. Instead, she wants you to shut up because 'you're creating tension', tension that she could've relieved.

To be fair to them, I don't really think they're assholes either. I can see from the woman's point of view that she just wanted to ride on a quiet bus, so like whatever. The man could've been so caught up in taking care of her because she'd just been injured or something and was in a fragile state, plus he might have been shushing you because she's very conscious of how she inconveniences people and man does it suck to get old and realize the world is leaving you behind.

So, Yeah, there were plenty of failures to communicate here. The biggest positive to come out of this is you have the frame of mind to recognize that perhaps your behavior wasn't the most societally polite.

What does tete-a-tete mean though? Google translate makes it out to be "This was a private conversation" which seems rude-ish.

So, basically, You're aware that you were rude. If you don't make a habit out of it, you're not an asshole. Maybe next time, call out "Hold the door" or something of the like, might help alert the driver of the situation.
Well, He has to open his hood to show people. A bit more subtle than a swastika on the arm, ya know?

This is a bit of an odd question, obviously, but do you find yourself 'relating' more to female heroes than male one?

I'm a male, but I often don't really think about 'relating' to my characters and often times will choose a female character (just to have something different from my daily life of being a guy) but I relate more to their actions (loss of family, murdering everything, etc, etc) than their gender.

I'm not trying to claim that gender is your only 'badass' criteria but I find myself more engrossed in a character if I understand *them* not so much based on them being 'a badass dude'

I mean, after all, Duke Nukem is a badass and I don't relate to him at all, Joanna Dark however, I can relate to her on a lot more levels.
I always liked Maleshep more than Femaleshep, so I was surprised to find that the internet decided the opposite was true.

I think it comes down to personal preference but man, Maleshep nailed that kooky non-hard sci-fi commander voice most of the time.

Didn't RF2 severely reduce RF1's level of terrain destructibility? I recall playing RF2 (Haha, Jason Statham is the only reason I replay it) and being disappointed because of the massive increase in non-destructible things.
Honestly, I hated the fact that 90% of the game was me holding down the 'repair' button. I get that you needed it since you could destroy your exits to rooms and junk but still. The reason destruction was so fun in RF:G was because you could dynamically react to things and still complete your mission.

I was gonna make a reference to RF1 but I tried to thing of a situation where I used Geomod super tactically then. I know there were obviously levels where I used it but they just don't stand out anymore. I should replay that game. For some reason, I can only think of that bullshit underwater level.

All the lack of choice of a Vinyl, All the portability of an MP3, and all the hipster cred of 'Retro' tech!

To be fair, I like records because I put them on and then songs play. I don't get to hit skip, I just get to flip it when its done playing. Outside of the house though, Spotify has like 400 songs downloaded on my phone, which I can stream to the chromecast hooked up to the same system as my turntable.

Music is too damn easy these days. I remember being psyched to have a big ass MP3 player because it meant carrying less CDs with me (Or that big ass tape box that stayed in the car) and not having to deal with making a CD mix of like 50 different single songs that I liked enough to deal with hitting skip 30 times when I eventually got sick of them.
Honestly, It's similar to Korea in the "Wildly ignoring everything painted on the roads" aspect but much more aggressive. I've been flipped off more times than I can count by people who almost hit me than anything else.

On average I drive something like five miles a day and still manage to almost get hit at least once daily. The other day, A driver turned the wrong way down a one way street, while a van was trying to exit it, almost squishing me in the narrowly prevented mashup, and the driver rolled down his window to yell at me. 

No headlights at night, no turn signals at all, over the limit on surface streets, under the limit on 50% of the highway, and the worst part is I can't even reasonably assume that whomever hits me is insured.
> I wonder how many lives this stopping vs moving at 1mph has saved vs how much it has taken in extra emissions?

Look, I'm all for saving the environment but I've been almost hit by two cars in the past two weeks and one had the gall to flip me off after I jumped back from their car barrelling through the sign. 

The person going 60 in a 30 will slam on their brakes with 10 feet to spare, slow down to 10 and 'roll' through. A California Roll is not some safe, fun semi-yield. I mean, after living all across the US, I'd be just as likely to call it a Texas or Maryland roll than anything else.

I'm sure there's more emissions caused by cars sitting in traffic on 75, 95 or the 405 than those of us sneaking around on backstreets with stop signs.
I mean, Dallas was on my mind but I've ~~driven~~ avoided death in Houston before.
I can't see his score, so I don't know if you're lying or not. Better blindly join in, in case you weren't.
Imagine this, if you have a four-way stop and everyone just rolls up (while obviously checking their phone since the car is going slower), misses all the other traffic behind their massive A pillars, doesn't check their sides for pedestrians, and assuming that the car directly across is going straight since their blinkers aren't on (because who uses those anyway?), so it's fine to just roll through right?

Even without that perfect storm of idiocy, it's stupid easy to miss a pedestrian on the side of your car. Stop signs are used in places where they actively want to impede the flow of traffic for a variety of reasons. Yields are much less likely in residential settings (where this sign is) since traffic has to be regulated by things like stop signs because if you just gave Americans a straight stretch of road with a sign that said 30, and a bunch of 'Go ahead through if it's clear!' signs, they'd be mad maxing down that shit at 60 before you know it with tons of accidents chalked up to "WELL I DIDN'T SEE THEM THERE!"

Stop means stop. You put the sign there because you want people to stop. THAT'S THE POINT OF PUTTING IT THERE. The purpose is to make sure that you have full stopped your vehicle and checked your surroundings, not the .1% of your brake pads life the local township has maliciously robbed you of.

You stop your car fully because it is a two-ton pile of pain that is powered by explosions and by god is it dangerous.

I didn't use to have problems with packages but at my current place I've had like, six incidents. The best was when they missed delivery (I was home), then told me it was lost, then gave me a UPS box... with someone else's makeup in it, then told me it was lost again, and then finally 'found' it.

Well, the /s is there because it was supposed to be humor. I do think socialist states are susceptible to corruption as well but this post was about me making fun of capitalists. Since humans are susceptible to corruption, any system that involves them (or at least has input from them) will be susceptible to it as well.

Since all forms of human government are prone to corruption, I guess the only solution is to kill everyone, but since that's no fun, I'm just going to make fun of the current system which has proven to be corrupt.

The only real gripe I have with physical games on the Switch (outside of having to get up off my couch, ugh) is that putting games into the Switch feels like crap. 

I pull up the little rubber stopper thing, the Switch pops out of it's dock, I pop the tiny cart out of the Switch and have to hold it between two of my fingers while I fumble with the other cart, I push the new cart in (which thankfully reseats the Switch in the dock), close that little rubber thing, and flop my ass back on the couch.

I don't know how to improve it, so this seems like complaining without a solution but I'm totally open to suggestions if you guys know how to make it easier.

Not really though, I understand zipper merging, safe following distances, and how to use my fucking blinker. The Range Rover that whipped into my lane without a turn signal and then immediately whipped back out into another causing both lanes to have to brake suddenly is traffic.

Shitty games on Steam are that Range Rover. If everyone just used their fucking blinker and wasn't complete cancer, we'd have less traffic. If people didn't make shit games (asset flips, baby's first game shit), we could have an 'open' Steam without a shitty Steam.

So, we need cops who actually care about enforcing traffic laws (Other than just speeding) and a Valve who actually cares about standards or we have a classic tragedy of the commons case, where a few perverse actors ruin everything.

There is such a thing as too many people using something ruining it, because they don't care about the thing like more invested (or niche) users do.

I have a hard time using the whole range of motion of the stick based on the location of the stick and shallowness of the grip in portable mode but since BotW relies more on the buttons than the camera (for the most part) it's okay for me. I can't aim for shit with the bow (and I'm not in situations where it's socially acceptable to flail around with the gyro aim).

I generally avoid FPSes on the Switch because of this as already have enough really good games and a PC to play FPSes on.

Basically, instead of putting my thumb tip on the top of the right stick, in portable mode my thumb knuckle rests on the tip 'comfortably' which makes down/right/up awkward.
This reminds me of Star Ocean: The Last Hope. The AI was so useless despite all my leveling that I spent the entire final boss battle playing as my Healer so that she would continually spam heals instead of just faffing off. Then the AI took control of my other characters and... spammed regular attacks.

Fuck that battle too forever.

My mom only could hear out of one ear, so CC was always on. First it helped when watching foreign films because I could read fast enough to keep up, then it helped later when I started losing hearing in one of my ears as well. 
Shame is a personal emotion. I never said I told them to stop. It's like watching someone you know get fat for no reason. I'm not going to tell them how to live their life. I will be disappointed though.

Who the fuck are you to care so much about the fact that I feel shame when I see waste?
It's not even about 'manly men' mods, half the time the 'mods' seen on these Jeeps reduce functionality. 

If someone hands you a wrench and you tape the jaw shut, it's not cooler, it's just useless.
That is true. He simply asked who the fuck cared and I was trying to give some insight into *why* someone would even bother caring.
Few vehicles can be described as uniquely American as the Jeep Wrangler. It's attracted a cult of personality that (almost) anyone (with deep enough pockets) can drive it and look perfectly at home.

It was bad enough for a long time that people who didn't (gasp) take them off-road were allowed to buy them but once you've seen a Wrangler lowered, on 22s with low-pro tires, with an all white paint job without a spec of dirt you get a sense of shame. Of wasted potential. 

The feeling in your heart when you see perfectly good food in the trash. I mean, you're not going to touch it, since it's trash now but damn, someone could've eaten that.

So basically, 'Why do I care?' because it will make your life better.

Not because a 4ghz i7 is the best around but because it will run your program faster, allowing you more time to do things. Not because the battery life is long but because it will allow you to spend less time hooked up to a wall.

The only real problem I had with rain maps was that it sounded like a torrential downpour but looked like a drizzle. Either crank up the rain effects or crank down the volume.
In Far Cry 2 you had to physically hold your minimap while in the car. I got so used to driving with it out that I would hold the right stick slightly down so the full map would always be in view.

Funny, I didn't think about death much as a kid until one day I was watching Terminator 2 and all of a sudden it hit me that one day I would die. I panicked and ran outside to play, since it was a beautiful summer day.

Yeah, it was late night leaving a club in Denver when I ran into a dude outside of the Denny's I was scarfing some late night grub before my hour drive back. He asked for some cash for food, I told him I didn't have any cash but if he wanted some food he could come eat with me, we sat, ate, and talked for a while.

Even if he was just bumming for cash, I got an interesting conversation out of the five or so bucks worth of breakfast I bought him.
I miss the rain just because it was so fun having all that extra noise to try to filter out. The loss of visual clarity. The only issue I had with the rain is that it sounded like a torrential downpour but looked like a light sprinkling.

But lets be fair. If the netcode worked well, The Fox Engine was basically begging to be used in a BR game. Imagine outrunning the circle (since, it's always a circle) in a cardboard box down a sandy hill. Finding decoy balloons, filling the final circle with them and then setting them all off at once. The first time I played PUBG I thought "This would be so much better if it was on the Fox Engine."
Well, The kid merely pointed out you could see her... hind parts...

I don't know but my four year old is quick to say "Look, you can see her booty!"

Also, In attempting to teach him about eating in moderation and not feeling bad for not eating everything I make for him, he quickly got in the habit of yelling "Because I don't want to get fat!"

Kids sometimes have no filter, the initial comment about butts (Not hind parts. That's serial killer talk.) could've been innocuous but that Dad quickly turned it into a few years worth of therapy with that "She doesn't love her dad" talk.

As much as I love AP I can't even count on both hands the times I out-of-bounds clipped or basically phase vaulted to the top of an object when I took cover against it.

I managed to break an entire stealth section because I took cover and teleported over a wall into the next area. Didn't get caught. Since I was playing a super sneaky type, I took it as a win and kept going.
With what I was recording at the time, I would simply call my brother on Discord. I set up audacity to record my mic in, since Shadowplay would not properly record my audio, and then drop the audio file in under the video file in Premiere.

No streaming from me either.
There's not enough skin there for a piece of luggage for my collection though. Maybe just enough for a glass box on my mantle though.
I got trashed on for saying that a while back but rest assured, after watching youtube videos on how to set it up and doing a test record, I ended up with a couple gigabyte flash video with no sound.

So I went back to Shadowplay and record my discord chat with Audacity on the side.

When I was a kid, KFC was the shit. I used to love going there, just the right amount of grease, crispy skin, and flavor.

Then I was living in Korea and decided to eat KFC there and man it was pure shit. Just all grease. Skin basically slipped right off and just dumped grease on me. I didn't even finish it. "Gross. Korean KFC sucks." I thought.

Then I got back Stateside and went to a KFC since I was short on time one day and it was all just... meh. It was uninspiring, bland, and just not good.

That was like four or five years ago. I haven't gone back since. Popeye's on the other hand...

My understanding is that currently Xbox, Switch and PC players can play together OR PC and Playstation. A 'team' of PSY NET players can be either all Playstation players (Since Sony does not allow crossplay between consoles) or it can be a combination of Xbox and Switch players.

You cannot currently party as a crossplay team, so a party is all one console (All Xbox, PS, or Switch) but as a PC player you'd have no way of knowing.
Psy Net means Psyonix Network. All Psy Net players are console players. If you have a party of Psy Net players they are either all Playstation or Mixed. PC players show up with their Steam Profile image.

I thought it meant they were Playstation players for the longest time too. I still call them Playstation players if I'm losing to them.

Plenty of people get in as an E-1, excel at PT in basic or get high rifle marks (Gets you E-2 usually at least) and pick up E-3 mainly due to time in rank.

Realistically, If you stay at E-2 for very long as Active duty, you're either fucking up or already fucked up.
If he did four years of JROTC and 'went in' as an E-1, he got fucked. It's automatic E-3 for the Army with JROTC. Doesn't even have to be Army JROTC for it to count. He just got promoted regularly, though quickly.

Doesn't make it any better because that first discordant ass 'king' didn't rhyme with anything either. King and nipple don't rhyme. King and king don't rhyme. The fucking work 'king' is in the word milking so it's not even a good rhyme and I'll say I'm not certain it's a rhyme at all.

Most people don't like leaving multitudes of consoles plugged up. I have my GC, Wii, Super Nintendo, and Sega Saturn all on display but only the PS3 and the Switch are hooked up to the TV though. (The 360 is in a closet since it's can't Wifi Netflix like PS3 can.) If I wanted to play the complete RE collection (0 - 4) I'd have to hook up the Wii or GC. If it came out on Switch at the right price though, I'd probably rebuy it.

Most people old enough to have a Switch and be screwing around on a subreddit for it are probably well-off enough to value convenience and nostalgia over many other things. Add in the portability element of the Switch and (to a random redditor) the 'easy' bolstering of Switch's game roster and bam, we're frothing for ports of games we've already played.

By spreading this shower thought, OP hopes to weaken the case against him. Maybe the judge will be browsing reddit right before the case, see this, and think "Hmm... Maybe it's *not* proof after all..."
This is why my nine-or-so year old LG 720p continues to be a mainstay. Press a button and four or five seconds later, she turns on.  I keep looking at newer TVs but man, I just need a big as monitor. I don't even need 4k really. Now, "Large Format" displays carry a premium since they're "Commercial grade" and dumb TVs are few and far between.

Then every time I find a good dumb TV, I go on rtings and get disappointed because they say it sucks.
My computer used to never go to sleep. Did a fresh install on an SSD and now it's nearly narcoleptic. It's good since it only takes a split second to turn on but damn, It has me consider running a second power button to my desk so I don't have to reach over and press the case one.
Always nice to have some clarification! The OP's 'Kickstarter April 2018' made me think it was a project on KS slated for release in April, so finding only the one blog post at off my skeptical alarms. 
In the Village, Apartments started sectioning off parking spaces so they could pile all the bikes there nice and neat.

It's stressful to be under attack. He needs to remind himself not to make a show of it, hence 'Stay hidden' as a verbal pep talk.
To be fair, a real conversation would've gone "Look at these faggy things, Spence!" "Shut up homo!"

Look, all things aside, That car's electrical system melted three times before we traded it in. It was an ugly gold with the 'camo' looking interior. The brakes went out on it once.

I still liked the car. The Mountaineer my mom got after it was soulless and uniquely average in absolutely everything but it lasted eight or so years until my dad drove it into the ground.

I mean, it only took like two rounds of bfg and he was basically dead. Just double jump dodge to the left or right to avoid the hallway attacks. 
Things do happen. Sometimes they're unavoidable accidents, like an asteroid hitting earth or pipes bursting in your apartment. Other times they're completely avoidable accidents, like driving down a clearly marked road that tells you not to drive down it.

The difference is, if you're at fault for an avoidable accident, you don't get to say "These things happen" you just get to say "I fucked up." 
I don't mean to sound dismissive but I jumped right into the Ultra-Violence difficulty level and only died once to his first mode, he felt even easier the second time and it just made me feel even more badass following him to hell to beat him down again.

I sold a car on Craiglist once and took a picture of the rust on the side.

Like, You're buying an engine and a body. Nothing crazy, here's the rust.
> and they pose no threat to you.

They know where you are. They know you have more than them. They have the potential to be a threat at some point, therefore you put them down so they know not to mess with you. So they know that you're willing and able to put them down no matter when and where they come at you.

Basically, you have to play "Evil Jon visits Rust" instead of "Why Not Wednesday Jon"
It's a funny anecdote but one of my old First Sergeants was the U.S. Army liaison in Hollywood for a while. Seeing a bunch of pictures of him out there on the red carpet was kinda hilarious.

You're misinterpreting the data. Sweat pants won't keep you as warm as poly-pro and Patagonia pants. So potentially Philly represents the potential maximum on the "Temperature / Comfort" scale for the local environment most of the year. Also, Philly specifically doesn't have the same amount of tree cover as most of Maine so you get more intense winds through city streets plus it's right off the water as well.

Also, it could just be proximity to New Jersey that causes it.

Further more, 20 degree temps feel ***a lot*** worse after a 80 degree day. That's a 60 degree drop. Compare that to a New Hampshire day where the temp stays between -10 and 0. It can still be cold in other places, relative to local temps.

I install Avernum games on my 'craptops' that I have no plans to re-purpose.
I own almost all of your games on GOG and I logged on to steam the other day and saw that I had a coupon for Avernum 3. I thought "Don't I have that one? Maybe only on GOG and not Steam."

Long story short, What's up with the naming convention? Are you going to avoid "rebooting" the series again? Have you considered making another 'new' series in the Avernum world? Are you randomly gonna drop Avernum VII or are you avoiding that number for RPG reasons?
Which sucks because last time it was that whole "Last gen/Current gen" argument but what's the excuse now?

Honestly, my buddy bought me GTA V during the Winter Sale but I had no intention of buying at all. I won't be running out to get a console so I can play Red Dead a few ~~months~~ years earlier.
I just keep the extra keys around, kinda like a box of gift cards.

Buddy interested in Pillars of Eternity? Send him a key. Brother wants to try Hotline Miami? Send him a key? Trying to get some friends to play Insurgency? Good thing I've got a few keys lying around. Friday and feeling down? Send someone a key.

I'm not gonna bother trying to trade any of them.

When I moved to Texas and was getting an apartment someone commented "Well, We have some Water bugs (Said 'Whattabugs') but nothing else!"

I'd never heard of 'water bugs' that were big so I spent about two days googling and searching for what they were and I found out they basically lived on lakes and stuff. Then I walked outside my apartment and was greeted by a roughly two inch cockroach.

After pressing a few other people I finally came to the realization that to cope with being surrounded by cockroaches all the time, they just call them a different name.

At least they're feral.

I had issues back on 8.1 though. The funniest part was, I sent my video card in for RMA and I used my i5 integrated graphics and the game ran great! Got my GPU back and... Black screen. Could never get the game to run unless I used integrated graphics.

My buddy said the other day "What should I tell my girlfriend I'm doing?" when he was logging on to play GTA V with us to which I said "Tell her you're playing GTA V with your boys."

Are you playing enough video games that she feels neglected? If so, make adjustments in your life or relationship.

Are you not getting enough alone time due to her neediness? If so, make adjustments in your life or relationship.

Does she just hate video games and want you not to play them? If so, Make adjustments in your life or relationship.

Do you simply want to continue 'hiding' your steam behavior? Make a new account and gift games to it. Leave your 'main' on snooze/away and family share your library from it to your 'GF is watching account'

Or, just tell her you want to play video games and if both of you have a problem with that... Well, you get the point.
I have roughly 1400 games on Steam and I've played probably 40% of them seriously. 25-35% are games that I previously owned (On Xbox or so) that I just wanted the PC versions and I 'still need to get to' 20% or so and the last maybe 5% I've beaten.

You should see how far a man can stretch with the right pair of shorts.

God, I like to think I'd be able to handle if my son was weird. I'm weird after all but damn, I just had a mini panic attack thinking 'What if my kid turned out like that?'

"I can't believe how bad this computer is! I spent $600 on it! These things are too expensive! What did you break on it this time?! I swear this thing was fine before you touched it." 

\*Open computer and see $250 worth of parts from four years ago\*

I'd rather know which parts are inside it, create a fresh image and keep all the drivers for it on a backup USB.
The alternative is that I built my mom a computer after a computer shop tried to charge her $300 for solder some capacitors on a pre-built worth much less than that.

When something breaks, she calls me. When I tell her to do something with it, she does it. 

I guess it helps if your parents are grateful for your help instead of treat you like an investment that never turned dividends.
I mean, It's not like I can take it to tower guard either, just that up there there's no Colonel around so I can talk like a fucking savage in between radio checks.

> I understand it must be annoying to not have a phone

I can leave my phone in a locked box up front for 8 hours a day and be fine since I'll be at a computer most of the day for work anyway but if you tell me I can't have something to take into the portashitter to jack it since all 11 of my tent mates are back right now and I've gotta rub a quick one out and Miller won't stop asking me about Rip-Its or something then you're out of your goddamn mind.

Granted, I probably would've just jacked it in the tent... quietly.
The relief of pulling off the blousing straps... Then your hair popping up as you pull down the nearly-knee high socks and just feeling your legs decompress... Ahhhh...
A late 90's Mustang is Rear-Wheel Drive you would absolutely not put the spare back there. If I recall, this is just a dumbass in Houston driving without the tire at all.

The front sitting low (unless you've lowered it) shouldn't scrape with a spare unless your suspension is fucked as well. Spare tire rims are like, 14 inches at smallest and IIRC the SC1 had like 15 inch rims. 
Not everyone involved, just the people who market it. When you're on a phone, Wikipedia redirects you to a compressed mobile variant so why can't NYT detect that I'm not on a phone and let me use my 16:9 display? It's not like I'm trying to read three articles at once. Why'd we ever ditch 4:3 if we're just going to compress everything into a tiny sliver in the middle of the page?
To be fair to Slayaway Camp, It's totally a phone game but it's a nice little puzzle game I'll pick up whenever I'm bored and just want to do a few puzzles. No where near as addicting as Tetris used to be so it's easy to pick up and put down.

So, yeah, Sometimes I do play "Phone games" instead of GTA V, Rocket League, DOOM, PUBG, or Dark Souls.
Is the DLC content worth it? It looked like two weapon packs and then a challenge mode, sans DK DLC right? Or does Gold get the DK DLC after it launches?
I beat it 100% and then someone erased my save so I beat it 100% again.

And I'm still considering picking it up right now.
1.) Those are plants. Not the best plot anyway

2.) Covering up adds some mystery

3.) Not everyone plays a game for the plot, some enjoy Hometown too.
The funny thing is, my Male Warrior mostly wears the Scallywag Chest so I can show off those chest hairs. I wish he had some short shorts to move in so he could pull off [these](http://i.imgur.com/VoA0XX0.jpg) moves.

Woah.
New style of articles, designed with phones in mind. Parallax scrolling IIRC. Notice how the deadspace lines up perfectly with portrait mode in a phone?

It's nice when done well but that intro was terrible and that article was *so* long. Honestly, I wish I could shoot the UX designer who suggested it to everyone and their brother.
A remake of the original Warriors movie (1979) would never hold a candle to the original.

A sequel to the original Warriors movie (1979) could never [Most likely] capture the magic of the original.

A remake/rerelease of The Warriors video game (2005) would be enjoyable

A sequel to The Warriors (2005) could never capture the magic of the original.

There's a subtle hint in my wording that reveals my feelings. The Warriors (2005) was a great beat-'em-up game using a great story as it's backdrop. The Warriors (1979) was much better than the game however and you basically can't argue otherwise (to me at least) plus arguing for Rockstar to create another multiplayer game, especially one limited to brawling and... what? The Rouges are gone, now all the gangs unite and take over New York city? The Warriors come back even stronger and stomp out every other gang and control New York? Both of those outcomes disservice the  original's story (and I disliked the Jailbreak series as well, just since I'm not enough of a sour apple already. It wasn't bad per se but it felt more fan service than canon.)

So, yeah, I'm enough of an asshole to think my opinion matters but The Warriors was already an ancient [Greek?] story, adapted to modern times and after seeing Spike Lee's Chi-Raq, I'd appreciate it if we just read the originals instead.
DONNIE! YOU WOULD'VE BEEN THE GOOD ONE! YAH UNWRAPPED ME DOC!

Elevators were supposed to hide the loading screens! That bomb made the cell reload before the damage was reapplied to the 'default' long range textures.
You're downvoted for implying a video game would do something better than Hollywood would more so considering that the movie left off at a great point and it's best to leave it at that.
That's way too cheap, unless each hour long mission only awards you with $50 Warrior Dollars (To keep it in line with 1950-60 inflation)

Having a second monitor is a negligible amount of GPU/CPU usage and Ryzen doesn't have an onboard graphics so you couldn't hook a monitor to it if you wanted to.

Why not just put them both on the 1080? I've got two monitors hooked up to a 760 and don't have any noticeable drops in performance.

They're not woefully ignorant (Well, not ONLY that) but actively ignorant.

When faced with evidence, they CHOOSE to ignore it. Woefully just implies that they are. You can be woefully ignorant of how a firearm works, have it explained to you, and then no longer be ignorant but rejecting the explanation without a single critical thought about both your own knowledge (or lack thereof) and the argument presented is to remain ignorant.

Woeful gives them too little blame in their stupidity. 
Did she fit in an 8x10 or did they go a little bigger and add some of that cool mat board stuff?
I'm a dude so they're of no pressing use to me but there are Tampons in my glove box. More than once I've been asked why they're there to which my reply is "Do you need one? No? Well, I'll guess they'll be there for someone who does."

There's also tissues in my car, jumper cables, an air compressor and USB cables. Being prepared is nothing to be embarrassed about... but of course, it's this bitch's cross to bear so it's a tragedy for anyone to see them.

They put up a few "Designated" parking spaces and the maintenance people for each unit collect them while they're out blowing leaf blowers at all hours.
I always pick up the bikes I walk past in HP but it just seems like they're sitting next to bike racks on the ground. I don't know if people are kicking them over or what but the other day I saw Ofo people in an F150 picking them up and throwing them in the bed of it.
Yes is all I can say. I was disappointed when I saw that the release was JP only.

Eh, Regular sedans are the Neutral Neutral of my car/alignment meme chart. Then again, I still think of Sedans as having trunks big enough for bodies and so on. 

It's more the height. As you can see, everything on the road blocks my tiny-ass car's view and that's what I get for liking compact cars but when the buying public adopts higher and higher vehicles and conveniently ignores stop lines at every blind corner and inches forward every time I'm trying to see around their jacked up front ends it makes me want to cut their suspension til they're dragging like old school low-riders.

Sedans are on the ground, with relatively low clearance because 90% of sedan drivers won't be taking on it on gravel roads... and even then 5% of sedans that do anyway will have enough clearance to not suffer too bad. Station Wagons were low down too, since sometimes they were just sedans with toppers, like my buddy's old Taurus Wagon.
I had a station wagon growing up as a kid and I always hated the looks of the 'Crossover Sedans' segment. It feels like the same argument I had before where someone wanted a big Explorer to feel safe and so on but didn't understand that minivans were much better suited to their needs and uses.

Crossover SUVs are too 'soccer mom'ish now but Sedans are too boring but *I don't want to be anywhere less than two feet up or I won't feel safe.* Compact Hatchbacks are 'too small' for me to make my commute in this ***major city*** where I will inevitably only drive to my work, apartment and Whole Foods.

I saw your post calling them 'better looking' and I was like 'I'm going to argue with this person since looks are subjective and I'm enough of an asshole to think my opinion matters (We had a Pontiac Aztek once too)'

Then I saw it was you Doug and my heart sank. Arguably (and Objectively) you're better suited to answer the question of what a trendsetting car is.

But... Man do I hate 'Crossover Sedans'. Not really for how they look (I like the XV) but because people didn't want to buy station wagons since their grandparents had them but now flock to these things without third row seating.

tl;dr: I like Station Wagons, Minivans and other horrible automobiles.
I made a binding for Insurgency which used the pad as a mouse but when I pulled the left trigger all the way down, activated the gyro.

It worsened my overall accuracy but increased the tension and made the game more fun. Sure, not good for competitiveness but walking into a room and aiming with the gyro to spray makes 'Spray and Pray' moments much heavier on the 'Pray' part. If they ever make VR controller specifically for Gun games (Like a lightcon) they need those ones from the arcade that had the slides to simulate recoil (Like from Time Crisis 3) because the feeling of the gun setting off the rumble, plus your every movement of your hands translating into your accuracy makes for an intense CQB.
Played 200 hours of MGS V with it, Played 60 or so hours of Witcher 3 with it, It's my preferred controller for Rocket League but except for using the gyro for flight (Which is just fun) I have a terrible time with it in GTA5.
I'm curious how you make Pot Roast.
Goddamn. I skipped a few games and here I go looking stupid.

I only ever had a demo disc of it but never picked it up since it came at the time of a glut of 'Critter heroes' just like Kay.

I have both Kay and Ty on my PC right now and my son friggin' loves Ty.
You can only have Zubat from Gen 1 and you will like it.
One of the Pokemon in Sun and Moon is a trash bag. A literal trash bag with arms. I still like the games but I wish each 'gen' was cut down by at least 50%-ish. There's like 10 Pokemon from each gen that I totally love, 25 that I like, and I'm indifferent or actively dislike most of the rest of them.
Ty the Tasmanian Tiger had a bit of a resurgence on PC even though I hardly remember it being popular in my day. If they have the files lying around and you already remade a PC version it's probably worth it, especially for a platform with limited titles like the switch.
However you can do it, emulator or whatever, get a hold of the first Katamari Damacy my dude. Even if just to play it once. It's worth it for anyone who likes kooky games. Katamari for Switch would make me cry.
Sorry, We're out. Didn't expect so many people to pick cake.
> An 80 hour RPG is worth way more than $60.

Is that 80 hours of meaningful story or is that Blue Dragon? Because I'm still salty about that game. Just because your game can be long doesn't mean it's good.
Is this what GTA V looked like on the Xbox 360?
You sure we're talking about the same Fallout "Blow up Megaton, Give a homeless guy water" 3?
It's not a big deal, I would hardly expect everyone to identify a weapon easily. Basically, the M-16A1 through 4, M4A1, AR-15, HK416, and the M27 (And probably many, many more) use basically the same lower receiver which all have a similar 'down/forward' safety.

The fact that this says "CAL: MULTI" makes me assume it's a civilian weapon which means it's likely an AR-15. The AR-15 is a .223 rifle but I'm assuming they wanted to really put the 5.56 (NATO) so they just said "Multi" instead.

And googling "Trump M4 Lower" returns only results for AR-15s, including one website that makes incredibly distasteful "Hillary for Prison" Lowers...

Sorry about the delay in posting this, The pipes burst in my place.
But if you're already past that point, best not to dig deeper. 
It'd be cool if you were the only applicant, so he fires you every day and then they rehire you after you leave the office so you can do it again tomorrow. 
Potentially, but the thing about lingering feelings is that they linger. In the moment, it's you or him but back home when you see his mom crying or his kids faces and you know they don't know the things you did (or worse, they do) and it's fine because you know you had to do it but really, *did you?*

Even if you can remain detached enough, you're going to see someone who looks like him and remember that time you tore face meat off a skull and ripped it apart with your teeth in a desperate bid to prolong your time on Earth. Heck, maybe you liked the taste and now every time you bite into a juicy pork chop you can hear the sizzle of him human ribs over the fire.

You're back home, you're okay and normal now but your mind never left that mountainside. Also, chicken from the factory doesn't have a head. How do you deal with seeing the face of the man you ate in every crowd from now on? 
You ever carved off a persons rib meat with a potentially dull knife and roasted it over a fire while the head of a former person is looking at you from the corner where you dumped the rest of the body so you wouldn't have to look at it?

You ever had a conversation with a person and then later had to chop their ass cheek off so you don't starve?

Eating the meat isn't so bad but try butchering another person some day.
Look, I don't care if we already discussed cannibalism, If we're out in the woods eating people and I die you'd better fucking eat me too. You'd better not let this meat go to waste. I'd rather be a savory filet in someone's mouth in the hopes that the smoke gets someone back to civilization than rotting on the ground while you stare too like 'Oh no! I talked about eating people with him! Now I can't eat him!"

But if you kill me for food, that's just survival of the fittest... As long as it's fair combat, no knives while asleep.
Aziz doesn't even seem like a red wine type. Since this story all but confirmed he's half Randy/Tom Haverford I assume he's got a wide selection of sweet white wines at his house.
> IS LINK ACTUALLY PART OF THE MARIO UNIVERSE?

Link sees Mario in Link's Awakening DX, so Link has some tangential knowledge of Mario.

Mario sees Link sleeping in the inn in Rose Town, so Mario knows Link personally.

Mario saw Link sleeping while he was dreaming of Link's Awakening.
Oh yeah? Well, I was hunted once. I'd just came back from the Shrine of Resurrection. I was hitching through Hyrule and some Lynel started harassing me. Next thing you know, I had a whole army of lynels chasing me through the woods! I had to take 'em all out - it was a bloodbath! 
That's pretty cool, I didn't know that!

Okay guys, Metal Gear Solid 2 is starting to make more sense than this shit. 
I knew Dogs could be girls and Cats could be boys but I was really fucking confused as to why our dog was named Randy when I later found out it was a girl. Like, What the hell? My mom was just like 'Randy can be a girl's name."

25ms from you to where though? P2P games are your ping to the other 'host' player. 25ms to a satellite + ping to mesh net + ping to other player 'host'

At least a server based game you could join a server and predict a relatively close number but unless the server is on the satellite as well, you're not getting a base of 25.
But you get to wear a backpack and stand in a dark room! Or simulate a convoy on Sega Saturn FMVs!

Almost everything I've ever heard about Bluetooth audio says this is wrong so I'm curious where this idea came from. Am I incorrect in my understanding that bluetooth audio is horribly compressed?

How I lost the major bug was AC4 and 3. I played 4 right after my son was born and had a lot of late nights playing it while holding him and completed everything...

Then I played AC3 and every collectable felt soulless and pointless. I just played the campaign and enjoyed it for that. I often catch my self drifting back towards 99/100 collectable quests but can usually snap myself out of it before too much wasted time. 
Wow! That's crazy, you're being ridiculous. 
This is /r/nintendoswitch, shouldn't we say "Shake Joycons to pay respects"?
> Skill floor increase to learn how to use them.

I think this actually lowers the skill floor, since you can just pick it up and fire at 300m logically. The old way had me checking distances and eyeballing things until I figured out what 300m looked like in game.
I figured that the Nazis must have terrible mechanics if they're just okay with generators pinging and popping on the top of the hill like that. If I heard that shit, I'd come running to shut it down or at least call it up to higher to get someone to investigate.

>  expect to hate the shit you make for a long time, maybe forever.

People ask me why I always say I hate all my work and I say because I made it.
If a customer says "I like squares, basic colors and no serifs on my fonts" then It's "No rounded edges, simple colors and no serifs"

If a customer says "We want a minimalist look with bold styling and modern stylized fonts" then it's "Okay, let's try this and see if they like it and hope they'll accept the fact that it took me five hours"

If a customer says "You know what's best, make it pop and keep it clean" you might as well say "Your pay sheet is going to be heavily scrutinized and you may as well not expect repeat business."
My brother is a graphic designer and I have some professional experience with it as well. 95% of the time I simply say "Well, You could build a building but you don't have the tools."

I can live with the DS sprites but holy hell V and VI are so bad. They already had the GBA versions in existence. They could've just released those and I would've been happy. Instead they "Remade" the game with default RPG Maker sprites and were like "It's been remastered!"

You push your thumb down to flip to semi, then forward if you want 3rb/Full Auto.
Some days I sit around sipping whiskey in a bathrobe with my slippers on while playing PUBG on the computer before retiring to the bedroom to play on my Switch.

I probably won't be playing the same things but you can bet by the time I'm forty I'll be doing something similar unless something else kills me first.
You could always die alone. No guarantees it'll prevent false accusations though. 
You can get cheap older monitors with HDMI at my local goodwill for like $20-40 too.
They're called "Walls, Traffic, and other cars" in Burnout not brakes.
The HD collections are Substance, Subsistance and Peace Walker, so if you've played the non-SotP/Snake Eater versions, you've played the HD. The only difference is that X360 and Vita lack the pressure sensitive buttons so a few actions were remapped.
But then you have four controllers at best, two sets of Joycons at worst.
Pull up till your front doors are in line with the car in front of the spot you want, put it in reverse and cut (turn the wheel until lock, two and a half rotations ish) the wheel all the way towards the curb (so, right in America in most cases), back up until you're angled at about 45/50ish degrees, straighten out the wheels and continue to back up until you're absolutely sure you're going to hit the curb (or, until you do) and then cut the wheel away from the  curb (left in most American cases) and you'll ease into that spot like a powdered body into a gimp suit.

Practice in poorer parts of town where they're less likely to notice the dents. 
I leave the tequila in the freezer and the marg mix in the fridge. No need for ice there. I love how it tastes with a dash of salt then next thing I know I'm passed out on my desk and my friends are wondering if I left the game or finally died of alcohol poisoning.

No ice, please. 
It's non-violent, it doesn't block a roadway, it doesn't effect job performance AND it's not even long.

Kind of? They still ignored their console versions, Starbreeze or not. That's the real issue here. I played a ton of hours on PC but eventually the DLC spam wore me out. It's not a bad game but it's feast or famine. Either buy it on console and get no attention or buy it on PC and show your Credit Card every time you boot it.
It made the forest more frustrating though, IMO. Invisible backstabbers were cool for all of zero seconds.
> "He was hacking, 100%". It's always more "Well, it was probably just because of the game itself"

Had a Chinese guy shoot ten feet behind me and while I was in cover and get a headshot. I couldn't tell if it was lag or hacking. Then other times, I just get outplayed but I watch the death cam and it blatantly looks like they're hacking but I can't tell because maybe they just got lucky.

But the game is fun to play with my buddies.

I miss that stupid car. It was terrible. We had the Gold one with the Camo-ish interior. The entire wiring harness melted, three times. We basically replaced the electrics twice, lost brake power more than once and finally sold it at a loss to buy a Mercury.

Playstation has always been easy for me. I've never accidentally confused X while playing a Playstation game for some reason. Something about seeing a square or triangle sets my mind into PS mode.
I guess I just have switched back and forth enough that A B between Nintendo and Xbox/SC has never bothered me. Playing Nintendo, B is at the bottom and A is to the right. Simple enough.

X button is the bane of my existence though. For some reason, my brain can handle Y not being at the top and will reach left to hit it but if I read "X" (despite knowing where it is) I press left.

In more casual text, like a reddit post, I will sometimes insert a "like," normally to express confusion, exasperation, or an example but not if I'm like, the president of the United States or anything.

I mean, work would set them free if those lazy freeloaders would work.
It takes a long time to get to the top floor, hence high floor being high skill. You enter on the bottom floor.
If I had to file it down, the actual freedom. Most sandbox games (In the current crops) say "Here are our tools, do what you like with them." Gmod is "Here's our tools, also here's our code and whatever here's a repository of everyone's work that isn't the Facepunch forums."

If someone says "Why do you play Gmod?" what do you say back to them? Do you prefer trouble in terrorist town? RP maps? Sandbox style creation? Creating wooden forts and using makeshift cannons to blow them all to shit? Posing source engine models in goofy ways? Making cool screenshots? Creating armies of NPCs and having them battle? The space maps which allow you to build working spaceships with oxygen and planets to land on?

A sandbox implies that you show up and use the sand in the box for your fun. Gmod let's you choose what's in the box and how you play with it. And you can play Gmod for hours without ever touching the 'sandbox' mode because TTT and so many more game modes exist, thanks to other players.

Both games are hard to describe for different reasons but can be easily simplified if that's the end goal. Heck, You could call Gmod a Sandbox and Doki a Visual Novel and be done with it all.
