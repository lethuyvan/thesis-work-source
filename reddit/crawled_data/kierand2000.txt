>How do we give kids privacy to have their own lives and still protect them on an online world? 

Teaching parents and children on using the internet responsibly and it's inherent risks.

>How do you monitor voice chat and snap chat and the likes, without having to look over their shoulder at every second and every interaction and every conversation they have with their friends?

How did we manage before the digital age? Where kids and teenagers would being saying/doing the same things. Unless you followed them and spied from the bushes you'd be even more clueless as to what they were up to.


Again educate the kids and foster an environment at home where kids can actually talk about issues. It's all about trust and that's a two way street.

Yep. And an F-16 one.
Ah OK. I'm still waiting on that too. I expect another January release for 8.
Probably blame your carrier for that not HTC. I've had Android 7 since last January.

Edit: international unlocked HTC10.

I can personally recommend this guy. Got me through the 12 lessons and passed the test 1st try in 6 months. Used his car for the test too. Friendly guy with great knowledge.

>The name originates from a "silly joke" during the promotion of Hot Fuzz. Wright had written in Cornetto ice cream as a hangover cure for Frost's character in Shaun of the Dead, based on his own experiences. In Hot Fuzz, Wright included a couple of brief throwaway scenes that referred to the Cornetto joke in Shaun. On the promotional tour of Hot Fuzzduring production of The World's End, one interviewer pointed out the use of Cornetto in the first two films, and Wright jokingly said that they represent a trilogy comparable to Krzysztof Kieślowski's Three Colours film trilogy.

I don't think you are right about our hedgerows, ours would be more comparable to hedgerows in Great Britain. Hedgerows in Normandy are a totally different beast from ours or England's. As the allies found out to their detriment during the weeks after D-day.

>But there is no evidence Clinton even was informed about this deal. The Treasury Department was the key agency that headed the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States which approved the investment; Clinton did not participate in the CFIUS decision. The deal was also approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Ultimately, only the president could have blocked or suspended the arrangement.

>Moreover, no uranium produced at Uranium One’s U.S. mines may be exported, except for some uranium yellowcake which is extracted and processed in Canada before being returned to the United States for use in nuclear power plants.

Your right actually, had to skim the specs, didn't know it was going C connectors on both ends. But most phones with USB C, at the moment AFAIK, have the normal A side at the wall end as it enables it to connect to any current/legacy USB port. And those c type cables are fast charge enabled.

EDIT: side note, do you know any phones that use c-type connectors on both ends? Would like to have a look at them. 
USB C is the phone end of the cable. It's still the normal wall side port, so it's backwards compatible.

And then?
How? 112 is an internationally recognised number that redirects to the local emergency services line, be it 999 or 911 or whatever.
No ads I guess? Lol
No not in nearby settings, that would be google turf. 

Took a bit if digging but it's in the sense home setting menu under "personalise HTC sense home".
They do have code that serves up ads, it in their free trial version only though. I guess they updated the HTC version with the free trial version by accident and it rolled out through the play store.
It's not as terrible and annoying as it sounds. If say around lunch time I look at my lock screen, it sometimes suggests a nearby restaurant and can give me directions to it. You can swipe it away and it won't appear again that day.

It's not like full screen ads for candy crush or anything.

Amazon reps can't offer a refund on third party items. Only sold by Amazon and fulfilled by Amazon.
No, if it's third party not sending here, it's the third party seller, not Amazon, who is saying it won't ship to Ireland.

They have restrictions that change, list of items restricted is available in the help pages.

Good question. I think the most omfg moment I had was when learning more about the gas attacks. I had assumed gas killed a lot of those hit by it, but death rates were only about 3 or 4%. Most who were affected by gas survived.

Living on with with horrible mustard gas burns or having respiratory problems for the rest of their lives.

Terrible shit.
I thought that at first too, but the info cards said they were for tunnels. Toxic gas from the explosives or carbon dioxide would build up in the tunnels causing men to pass out. These were for the men sent down to rescue them.
Lol, certainly looks that way from that perspective. Now I'm not sure if it's two knives or a bayonet with a knife! 

Edit: Asked my gf, she confirms it was a bayonet with a knife. WTF.
Your welcome. It's an eerie experience seeing all of that.
couldn't resist.
Really? I spent too much time in that section. I agree the trench was definitely a let down, felt too clean or something.
>there were practically no opportunities to interact or engage with anything.

Do you normally touch other museum artefacts?
They do, I was disappointed by it though. It's right under were the tank is in the photos. The trench feels too bare.
Thank you for your work, the displays are amazing.
Your welcome man. If your ever in London, I'd highly recommend going to the museum.
[You are correct.](http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/medical-insurance.html#section2) In my case my employer pays, so I have to claim back the relief.
Yes and yes. You can claim it on the revenue website. 20% back on what you pay, up to the value of 1000E per adult and 500E per child.

Except Seasame St has moved to HBO, so they're safe. Drumph can still try attacking the funding of PBS though, seasame St old network.

This is the same place/story from a few years ago. The initial reporting was on it was suspected there were bodies buried there.

This latest report is after an excavation at the site has confirmed the initial reports.

Can I ask where this leak came from? A quick Google doesn't show results. And I'm not in the habit of downloading random zips from gdrive.
I'm sure I've seen this when I did my fork lift training with an English dub.
Yep, just checked their website for 240Mbs internet with Max TV option. It's still a fiver more even after the new price increase coming January.
I'm aware, but only two people in the house and my laptop only has a 100Mbps network card wired (so any increase wouldn't be noticed there). But my TV package has been upgraded to the max one without asking or paying. So I'm not asking for more. Asking for 240Mbps with their full TV package would cost more than what I'm paying now.
120Mbps down, 10Mbps up. Exactly what I pay for. Virgin, Cork suburbs.
Knew I heard fear of the dark in there, had to watch twice to be sure. Up the irons!
[This is long, but should answer all any question and help you weigh up if you should bother] (https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/faq)

TLDR: Should resolve queries faster than your ISP DNS server.
Google updates it's DNS faster than your ISP.
And as just witnessed, if your ISP DNS goes down, so does your internet. I've been using Google DNS for probably 10 years and don't remember ever being affected by any problem with Googles DNS.

As for doing it on your router instead of the device your surfing on, if you apply it to your router, any device on your network will use it. As opposed to changing the DNS setting on each of your devices seperatly, which could be time consuming.
Saw other comments that it's not an option on some of their routers.
Works on Horizon. 
Just to add for everyone doing it on your personal device, change it on the router settings instead. That way the change will affect all devices on the network. Rather than changing it on every phone, tablet, laptop etc... 

I changed to Google DNS years ago and didn't even know there was a problem till I saw this tread.
Working for me in Cork, but I'm using Google DNS. Though my phone is not working.
I remember this in the news when it happened, cause everyone was giving out about it only being a box of Weetabix. When it was actually the shipping carton boxes that contain the individual retail boxes. So anywhere up to a dozen boxes in one carton.   
HAHA! Like they take any of those complaints seriously. It'll be noted and you'll get a cookie cutter e-mail back about it, nothing will be done.
Used to work in Smyth's, even though their pricks to work for I can vouch for their trampolines. All the enclosures are on the outside perimeter, springs are covered by a matting so no amputations. All parts are available as spare parts, bounce mat, enclosure net, safety padding, poles, springs. Everything. Certain parts can be hard to get at times, but they always come available eventually.
Oh Jesus the lamb! Haha

That's literally what the tweet in the op said.
God dammit, must edit again.
I dunno since it's not actually in stock anywhere, so is it a real offer if they can't fulfil it? 

Anyway I'd say it's only a placeholder price.
Thanks, edited.
A price tag is an invitation to ~~buy~~ ~~offer~~ treat, not a contractual obligation to sell at that price.
It wasn't posted here, I x-posted from r/videos cause I thought the content would be interesting for us here for the exact reasons you gave.
Also worked there for far too many years. Completely agree with you. Also the weird blur that is linked in the imgur album does not affect any of the in game text, so that would rule our the hardware being defective. IF there is a fault it's with the game.

As a side note, fuck Smyths. I still get wound up thinking about encounters with customers in there. Maybe we need to set up some kind of PTSD group?
Jumped into an operation the other night, pretty late. The chat was filled with an bunch of us discussing WW1 history and battles. It was the most fun chat I've had the pleasure of seeing and was super refreshing change from the usual garbage.

Admit it, you just hate your brakes.
Passed 18months ago. My instructor never even mentioned block changing. My experience is gear by gear offers better control and smoother operation, larger chance at mucking up on block changing. Only exception he made to changing down was obviously an emergency stop, in that case just step on the brakes and gears be damned. Someone also mentioned engine braking, very useful and saves the brakes some stress, obviously you never engine brake significantly without using your actual brakes. That is dangerous as there's no brakes lights on then. For the test just go gear to gear I'd say, it's smoother, which is what they like. Once you pass do whatever you want as long as its safe.

Except the aisle sitter is clearly a child. Unless Dublin bus now use child labour...
Even though your statement is correct, it annoyed me. Because I went looking for a lower quote and the cheapest I got was still 150e more than my renewal. So I called my the guys I'm already with and they matched last year's price. All logic seems to be out the Fucking window with car insurance.

None of the usual consumer advice seems to help bring the price down.

Edit: fuck my grammar, but I'm annoyed and on mobile.
Also to clarify, not annoyed at you. Annoyed at the situation.
Well it is being remade...

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USAand your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

222 for Carrigaline, but don't use that if your only going to Donnybrook. 207 for Donnybrook, or the 206 to Grange is viable depending on how far you're going up Donnybrook hill.
They're a different shape from today's hurls that's for sure.

Charge of the light brigade!
Horse and sword play :D
Well he's an American citizen so yeah, he can go home.
Can we go and troll that mayonnaise subreddit again with Mayo things in honour? 
Damn, look at you two. I dunno how you're still going, had to replace mine last year.
The bus swerved out and you can see from the gif everyone started braking, look at the tail lights and the fact they come to a stop. Only the truck didn't brake in time and that's probably down to the weight of the load, but he did try to stop.
Did they? Seen Demolition Man many times in Ireland on syndicated TV, VHS & online (either Netflix or torrent) and and never seen the pizza hut one. 

Edit: Pizza hut is still relatively new and holds a very small market share, Taco Bell doesn't exist here.
I dunno, I mentioned in this thread that this happened to me too. Think they just download a YouTube video of the song you want and it doesn't always work out for them.
Same thing happened at my dad's cremation. We asked for "always look on the bright side of life" from Monty Python. Got the film edit with swearing and credits bit etc.
I'm hoping smarter people than me can answer that, that's why I posted the article. But I don't see how it can be bad as long as it's safe for the device and user.
Link?
It absolutely does not take hundreds of metres to stop a luas tram from normal speed. Talking out your ass.
My WiFi signal is fine, I'm in a normal sized 3 bedroom house. But yeah milage there will vary on the structure. Did need a WiFi extender for the bathroom which is in an extension. As you said you can request them to send you a separate router if the Horizon box WiFi isn't doing the job for you.


I've solved any support problems by contacting them through there Twitter page. You get lads in Ireland who give a shit and they've solved everything for me quickly. 


Haven't a notion whats going on with  your Horizen go.


The speeds you're getting are typical for a WiFi connection. If you want full speed you'll have to be wired and have a network card that supports more than 100Mb/s.


The clunky UI for the TV is the bane of my life. But it has been slowly improving over the last 3 years.
I'd say the M10. But I'm waiting on the reviews to come in first.
Is this the right day to ask about VR headsets? Looking at purchasing my first headset, so just dipping my toes in to see. Can anyone recommend best bang for your buck for under 30 Euro price mark. How important are some of the features I see listed, such as adjustable lens position and length. Magnets and remote.
In good lighting the photos are perfectly fine for a phone. But when compared to say the s6, the differences are noticeable. It's up to you if it is acceptable or not. In low light, horrible. So much noise & blur.
I've seen in another thread that the headphones that come with it will plug into the bottom. The type C USB port, as that port supports A/V out. I guess the top 3.5mm port is for "legacy" earphones.

15 days? you sure about that? From what I remember it was 90 days, but that wasn't A9 specific.
They're rumored to have a 3 year Nexus deal with Google.

I know sorry, I usually avoid it like the plague. But they had the most pictures and tweets relating to it.
Haha I didn't even notice the state of the map.
I've done Portmagee to Dingle last August via the Wild Atlantic Way. It was a took 2 and a bit hours, stunning drive, but you might want your wits about you on some of those roads.
Yep used it, got full speeds. Though it would take up to 30 sec to get there.
1. Mine does.

2. Mine was open.

3. Who hasn't been hungover in work at some stage?
Agree with the TV bit. The UI for TV is so sluggish. I'm not sure about the Netflix throttling. Sure plenty of people reported it, but it never affected me. Always got full speed there, so that's anecdotal.
Do people do that??
Tooche
Yeah I know it's anecdotal. I've been to the west of France too multiple times. It's always been nice, I guess that's why the motorway embankment stuck in my memory so hard.
Just back from Euro Disney last month. The state of the motorway embankments was a disgrace between CDG and the parks.
Yep, they're the empties on the ground. Also not all the ones on the truck is for the one pub, probably.

Shit, I'd forgotten I've watched that. Completely blocked it from my memory.
That's something that's never occurred to me. Does Daniel have a security team? I mean who's want to hurt him!
So it is nicer?
It's suddenly relevant after the gangland shootings maybe?

That was a great read.
I was in 2nd year, still remember that afternoon so vividly. It was P.E. day, so I had to cycle home after school with a tonne of books, tracksuit gear and a big jacket on. Hot day too. Rolled into the garden knackered at about 3:45, my dad grabbed me coming in the door and screamed "quick! Inside! WWIII is about to start." Went into the living room and watched RTE news run all afternoon, recapping what little information there was at the time. My dad went to the pub :/
I concur. Uninterrupted RTE news , repeating the same half hour of material all day.
Thank you the mobile site was hell
That's actually a really cool idea for some of the background.
I'm still holding out. Got my 3rd bill the other day.
The Android app is from a different fork of popcorntime. It's closed source and /r/popcorntime don't recommend it.

They sell them in Dunne's, not bad.
Probably a stupid question, but does customs have any problem with this?
I got that reference.
Why not just not buy from third party sellers?
Really? I was always under the impression that French drivers are better trained & have a higher testing standard to earn a pass. Also was always impressed by the taxi drivers I had there, though that will probably vary by region, I was on the west coast.

Don't forget a call centre in Cork that serves all EU Amazon's.

Thnaks. /u/elmoslats answered the dedicated or not question. I meant do they have "Tesco" filling stations or you get a Tesco voucher or somet for petrol from participating stations.
Higher octane rating?
Ouch. Did you go back to the petrol station? Do they have dedicated stations here or are they participating stations?
Do you find any variation between different Topaz stations? Because the price per litre varies wildly. I'm looking at pumps.is now for my area and I can see topaz from 129.9 to 134.9
I don't have any other details I'm afraid. I was present for the reading of the charges only, he pled guilty so no jury was needed. And I wasn't there for sentencing.

Not OP, but €30 is a typo, don't know want figure he meant. That's only 30 bags of 1c coins. Figure is probably in the millions of Euro.
I don't think you read the website.
Sure. All I was pointing out in that comment was there needs to be some caps to ensure the integrity of the network. And the "unlimited" is a marketing buzzword more than corporate greed. 
I'm saying that torrenting 11GB of Linux or whatever else on your phone isn't the norm for a typical user. Now for people who don't have home broadband I can understand.
What if you abuse the network enough that it impacts other users? So I wouldn't say corporate greed, more marketing spin.
If they've actually changed the price and a new contract applies. But I'd say it's an oversight, no word on price increases from them.
He also torrented 11GB.
I only found out myself! Got mine and the SO's car done though!
Just saw, phew!
Yeah I know I *can* take the grant whether i pay or not.. I'm asking more morally, I don't feel like I *should* take it when I'm actively not paying.
Are there many here registering for the grant and not paying? I haven't paid and I'm in two minds about taking the grant or not.
If you're on disability, one is provided for you free of charge. She had applied, but it had not been sent yet.
Why do I keep making the mistake of going to the Independent's comment section.
I think you need to chill out. They have a 97% positive review rating with over 32K reviews. Also I can't see where they say they use a courier, cause I doubt they do when shipping is 2.50GPB. Even if they did, the book could easily be handed over to An Post here, which are on strike. So, sorry your first dip into the marketplace wasn't stellar, but I wouldn't dismiss it in the future.
Get onto actual Amazon customer service and get their input. They can't do much cause the contract is between you and the seller, so don't bother pushing them. But they'll get you the best advice.
I'm definitely going to check it out. Have you sussed out how much the 1GB plan is?
Don't suppose you could elaborate please? I'm interested in the process. How are you flagged? What conditions must be met? What happens to repeat offenders? 
You sure? Because the mobile plans are 30 day rolling contracts.
Ah balls anyway, wrong sub clearly.

It's good to see that everyone seems to be checked and balanced. If this was the states, he'd be beaten and slapped with assaulting an officer and resisting.
You are correct on the 30 day rule. From what I can gather,  they ended price reductions the day before and then applied the 20% off. For example, toy X was reduced to 75E with a RRP of 100E. The day before the sale it went back to up to the original 100E, 20% sale brings it back to 80E. So people are super annoyed as they thought they would get for 20% off the 75E. It's probably not illegal, but it is very misleading and the people on the page are very angry about it.

What kind of atmosphere are you looking for in Cork? Spailpin Fanach in Cork if you're looking for some traditional music sort of pub. Tourists do go there, but it's not aimed at them and isn't all diddly aye like the tourist pubs.
Exactly! I'm sure I'll need to balance a table leg at some stage!
Same, I just have mine stored away in case I ever need it. 
I got mine about 3 weeks ago. So probably staggered.
Resubmitted with correct link, cheers whoever called it out. I don't know what happened first time.
I'm not paying, but also not claiming the grant. Think that might amount to social welfare fraud?
I've had encounters with Angie in my old work. Still comes in apparently looking for discounts because of all this. Now I know what that family has been through wasn't easy, but she's still playing it up to get free/discounted stuff. Also, when the story was breaking about the boys years ago, I heard she turned down selling the story to the papers. A few months later she's taking money from charity bike runs. For some reason that rubbed me the wrong way.

What's so special about Knock that it can accommodate B-52's? I would have assumed at least Shannon and Dublin could with their large runways. Cork I doubt, definitely not a fully laden B-52.

They tell you when you get the very that it won't do legally. But I'm sure you'd get away with it for a short period, say you haven't had the chance to get the proper license yet. It would be a right sour bastard to pull you on it, I would think.

It's /r/worldnews, it's usually fairly toxic there.
But aren't the IP's dynamic on those routers? It's should assign different devices different IP's.
The replacement got a lot less use than the original drive and had not even been used for probably 2 years. Still strange that they both failed together?
Thanks for the reply. My data is already safe as I moved anything sensitive away from that laptop when the first drive started failing.


If the cloning caused the bad sectors on the replacement, is there a way to fix this? I'm going under the assumption that the replacement from the external has ALOT less uptime than the original, that's why I'm suspicious that they both failed.
Region I think. But I've seen different CID's in the same region. 
No, to cope with server load it's rolled out gradually according to your CID.
I have the spigen one in gunmetal. It's awesome, colours match the phone, good protection and the clear back let's you show off the phone. Only downside for me is that the front edges over the screen too much and makes typing characters close to the edge of the screen a little tricky sometimes. Great case none the less.
Ya I hounded em too over it, it was only by chance i logged into the router 6 months ago and the 5GHz section wasn't greyed out anymore.
My one does. They opened it a few months ago and told no one. Mind you I have the wi-free disabled so that might do it.
Well it is vaguely based on the British isles and it's surroundings.
I didn't know they were just regular taxi drivers and not uber drivers in the true sense of the business. I use a hailo style app for my local taxi company, I like them as the cars are always clean and the drivers nice. So the only difference in using hailo over what I have now, is that I'll be opening myself up to other taxi companies/drivers? As price is the same too.

That was awesome, got flashbacks to top gun and falcon 4.0 running in my head now!
That's weird, something like that was happening to me last night too. I haven't damaged the phone or charge port. But I had it plugged in the evening for two hours and it only charged from 30% to 40%. Charge time was saying something crazy like 10hrs. Rebooted and issue went away. Could this have something to with the last update? Change log said they improved heat management during charging, might be a bug with that.
Legend. Didn't see that.
Loads, just search for 360 degree or other such.
Thanks for a bit of perspective. I've driven 3 feistys and the focus and they all had similar clutches, just wasn't expecting it to be so heavy. I'll be giving that corolla a skip alright cause of the wobble, but if all corollas are that heavy i might have to take it off my wish list 😠
Yeah that's what I'm afraid of. It was serviced by a Toyota garage before it was sold to a dealer, must call the garage and get details of the service from them. Flew through the nct last week, nothing unusual on the report.
I understand they'll be problems, I was more wondering how big these problems are. Even if they are problems, I don't know how a normal corolla should feel.
Should clarify, I'm on Meteor network, but they don't brand their phones with carrier software.

Think regular pool and double it.
Age doesn't come into it. It's a landmark that not many here would have ever seen in real life, which as a reference point doesn't make it well suited.
I think you missed what I was getting at. I (and I assume many others) have no idea how to relate to the size of the Lincoln pool. A better reference point would be an Olympic sized swimming pool. 50m long X 25m wide X 2m wide = 2,500m3
They don't actually meter water out, it's assumed 'water in' = 'water out' if you don't have a septic tank.
About 2500 m3 😏
And do you have reference for how big the Lincoln pool is?
You can buy ordinance survey maps from the osi website. Current and historic.
I actually reset it again today after I posted and it worked, managed to login but no bill ready lol. I'm curious cause I initially signed up for direct debit, but later cancelled that with my bank. I want to hold off on paying right till next year.

It sounds like Sabre rattling (is that the phrase?). It would be impossible for a lot of people to come up with that kind of deposit, thereby hurting their own business. Maybe they are trying to cause outrage because they don't want to be debt collectors?

I can guarantee its not worth the money these poor third party customer service agents are getting. Abtran pay minimum wage at entry level.

It's just a tactic I presume. I mean they have a better chance of contacting someone at home in the early hours than say at lunch time, when she could have been out at the shops or dropping off/picking up the kids. Also, I think one of the Guards has to accompany her to Mountjoy, so that's his entire shift spent getting from Donegal to Dublin and back for tea.
The top shelf, which is usually just out of reach have these shipping cartons on them. In my local one anyway, and I know I few other retailers also do this

Oh not at all if you have any intention of traveling or working a job that requires a background check. It maybe preferable to some I guess.
Thing is, you don't even go to jail. You are sent there if convicted and refuse to pay fines. But you are processed at the prison office when you arrive and then told to go home. You never actually serve time.
But seriously, how can you summon someone to court if they don't have his name? They can't summon the person who lives at 123 Fake St.
The law hasn't changed regarding online viewing. They were trying to but it got put on the back burner after Irish water hit the fan. 


Older TVs that can only receive analog signals are still liable. As all you need is a box and you can watch TV again. I suppose that could be argued in court, but I've no idea if it would be entertained.
Ha! Not in the large Irish toy chain I worked in! What fairytale place you work in?
Check out the other person that replied to me, they linked the news article you were probably looking for. Ya I've seen general recording by them with camcorders and such, but never thought they'd have personal cams like those. I agree, I'd love to see full unedited videos of encounters, but that's a pipe dream.
Thanks, that's pretty impressive out of them. Though they don't seem to be in wide spread use at the moment.
Not doubting you, but do you have a source on that? Cause that's fairly proactive and ahead of the curve if they have had them for at least a year.
While she was comfy in her car and came to no actual harm, she was still prevented from leaving, which would make it illegal. Though I think the response is over the top.

Bullshit.

I wouldn't like to make mistakes with a one tonne chunk of metal doing 100kph.
Have a friend driving for two years on his learners without any lessons, and it's fucking scary.
That's subjective, everyone is not equal in competence with driving. For example, I'm after lesson ten now and my instructor and I are sure I'll be able to pass first time no problem. I was driving on the road on lesson one, whereas my instructor told me he had someone before me who never made it out of the carpark. The 12 lessons are good way of learning the correct way of doing things on the road, after that it's practice.
Well there are air defence units in the DF, but they are not remotely equipped to be effective.
Irish air corps does not have anything to intercept with, Ireland does not have an air defence.
Rotterdam is the largest, and Poole is the largest natural I think.
How you know the RAF planes entered our airspace? They took off from Scotland, they could have rounded us like the Russian plane.
Except that the article doesn't clearer state that either did enter our airspace. The Russian plane came down the north and skirted the west coast and the RAF planes which took off from Scotland, would have rounded us too.
Just a small correction, America spends more than the next 13 countries combined.

Yep, Shannon was definitely a cold war target. I hadn't thought about Cork, but it makes sense, its the second largest natural deep water port in Europe.
That energy rating :'(
Sound lad
You can't order separate it seems by the website. But all it means is you have a phone account active with them, there is no extra installation that must be done for the phone alone. This is because the phone runs on VOIP, if you were going to use the UPC phone you just connect the handset to the back of the internet router.
You da real MVP.
That was genuinely a fascinating read. I would like to know more! 
They're not talking about in the airport. 
It must've been unlocked around the time WiFree was debuted. Before that all the 5GHz setting were greyed out and not accessible.
Just a personal opinion, I wanted to have the freedom to use 5GHz in my own house like any other network. However UPC used it for the WiFree, using a tagline like "you'll never have to give out your network password again to friends or whatever in your house". If I'm comfortable enough to have someone in my house, I'm comfortable for them to have my WiFi password. It is handy, I get it, but it was forced on me where I would have preferred the normal way. Sorry /rant
Most decent smart phones and tablets are compatible now, laptops are still a fairly iffy.
Nope the Horizon is dual band, it'll broadcast 2.4 and 5 at the same time. I know if other Cisco router is one or the other.
It was enabled middle of last year with a firmware update and they use it for the WiFree thingy.
Yeah, I know its absolute shite, but it was kinda adequate for my needs. It would be nice having WiFi in the toilet though. Did you get UPC to split it or you buy your own router?
Been thinking about doing that, is there much of a difference in range and signal quality?
No idea in real world conditions, it would depend on your house. There's no tinkering involved, check under the box for the 5GHz ssid and password, if that ssid is visible on your phone/laptop punch in the passcode and your done. Go walking around the house and see if there is a range difference. I bout a repeater for my house, 20e on Amazon, works fine.
Yep, spotted that myself when I was figuring out where it was coming from. Congratulations, you have 5GHz!
Your normal WiFi operates in the 2.4GHz range, but only has about 13 available channels, that can become congested in areas where lots of people have wireless internet, think of like apartment buildings. Also it is prone to interference as other wireless devices operate in the 2.4GHz range, bluetooh, babymonitors cordless phones ect.


5GHz is in a different radio range and provides more channels, also more bandwidth, so faster WiFi. But there is a trade off in range.
I asked them too ages ago. It's enabled but not in the usual way, they are using the 5GHz AP for WiFree. I don't want to question it with UPC, because I'm sure it's a mistake and I want to obviously keep the 5GHz for myself.
Well what package are you on now? Cause I'm paying 68 at the moment for 120Mb net with TV. I dropped the phone from the package to save 5 euro a month. I'd go back and look at there current packages, maybe your on a legacy one?
Lynyrd Skynyrd - another one from the road. I still listen to it at least once a month after hearing more than ten years ago.

FB viral campaign where they announced that they were closing for good, turned out they were renovating and opened that new front part. Student population went crazy.

More than likely needs to be ripped down and built again.

Oliver plunket street, close to that Italian place on the Parnell street end.
Listened about this on the NPR Ted radio hour a few weeks ago. Fascinating to learn about.
I really hope this will be as big as they seem to be preparing for. Anything less and the government will think they are winning us over.
No. Governments wised up to that a long time ago. I suspect the cost is building in the cost of machining the coin, transport blah blah blah and not just the cost of the metal.
Entitled probably yes. Would they though? Not unless it was a only choice I'd say, we're not as trigger happy.

I agree it would be good for the people, but I don't see any Irish government working "for the people."
Ah ok. I seriously doubt the government would have any interest in making this spectrum free for public use when money can be made from it. Especially in today's economy.
But you need to license it for a fee, who buys the license? Do we all chip in? Or do we not need one? Genuinely asking.

Not necessarily. My YouTube was the same this afternoon on a year old horizon box, usually its fine. Horizon has its problems, but this seems to be something else.

I have no doubt that Sky and UPC would hand it over as they would obliged to under the law. My question was, do An Post have access right now? Because I don't remember reading that they do, just that they were seeking the permission.

I'm actually typing out a small excel spreadsheet right now for the gf, she's having a bit of trouble budgeting her money. Coincidence :D

*Utilities/bills: 7%

*Food (groceries): 18%

*Transport: 6%

*Miscellaneous: 3%

I don't actually have a saving account, but my cash flow average since April puts me at saving 10%.




I've been using a great Android app for keeping track of my spending since April. I've been diligently inputting all my incomes/expenses and it's fantastic to see it all layed out in front of you.

>I suppose we can expect no commitment to a referendum by government next week, when 'all will be revealed' about water charges.

I love that, three weeks into the first billing cycle (7 weeks if you take the original date) and we might get clarity.


I'm with you, I never knew either till your post! 
Yes. It's said in the article they have done this.
Light weight.
Ah come on lads, how much were they offering? How much experience?
Pleb, don't speak to me. I'm polishing my monocle. Also don't have a water meter :-D

Yes it does good point. 
Well if it's only happening recently hang tough. You mentioned that they are working in the area. Leave them get that done and if the issue remains after that, then you can complain.
Have Ya tried to run the tap for a while, sometimes bleeding it will clear it up. Happened to me during the summer.
o_O I don't remember that! Why don't I remember that?!
>Will they just address bills to "the occupier" if no one registers?

Possibly? I don't know to the honest off the top of my head. Though the news this morning is saying it'll be 420 Euro bill for people who don't register, so I presume a bill will be sent. Just one of the million things IW has failed to communicate clearly.


No, the occupier is responsible. Your landlord will not be liable ro pay your charge.
Why so many? 

>Sure I had a massive argument just the other day between two of my throwaways. 

Lol

Ah yeah! That makes more sense. Big cup of soup when I got back :)
Really? Is there much people left? what's happening?
Can confirm for Amazon, one of their motto is "under promise, over deliver." I did some customer service for them.
They did the same with G+ at the start too. Except the hype train stalled after people realised it was shite.

It took me a lot longer than I'd care to admit that this fooled me.
>so it may lose some appeal when packed with tourists. 

It does. I was there last month and it was packed with Americans. The accents made me cringe and the way they refused to make room for anyone else on the walking path infuriated me. I refused to kiss the stone after getting to the top, simply because I didn't want to swap spit with those people. It's such a fucking American tourist trap.

Edit: The tower is cool though.
2nd edit: they mention leprechauns around the estate. ಠ_ಠ

So..  what is the right information regarding this?
I didn't even think of the kids who live in split homes. Nice point to consider.
Yeah, I'm that guy now :-(
Dear god I hope not. 
I think most of the information in the article came from the Garda press office. Hence the tone of the article, just a simple report. I was just amazed they didn't arrest him.
Streaming netflix right now, no problems. I'm in Cork though.
I haven't had a chance to listen either, on mobile with bad speaker.
Apparently he's had problems in the passed, been in and out of rehab etc.. Also he still actually lives with his dad, who signed up for Irish Water no problem.

Edit: Gobshite
Yep, buddy of mine was renewing his home insurance and noticed an addition. Basically that stolen water from outside taps would not be covered.
It'll be digitally coded. You'd need more than just transmitting at the same frequency.
Not without the account number and pin in the pack.
Really? What problems? I have mine to n only and having no problems. My understanding is g is slower and is more prone to interference as it runs in the same spectrum as Bluetooth, baby monitors etc.
Not rigged exactly. It's just the UPC speedtest does not leave the UPC network like the normal speedtest site. I just tested the two and got the same results for DL/UP speeds. Though the latency was much lower on the UPC one, understandable since you don't leave the UPC network.

What if you were to book it on-line, the earliest date is more than four weeks and book it. Print out the confirmation and on the day show them it was more than four weeks? Can't really argue with that.
Well maybe not lies, but these people are spreading wrong information whether they know it or not.


Ok, I'll try!
I'm no expert here, I just read a bit of material relating to this and this is what I took from it. So please feel free to correct me or expand on something.


Myth 1: I think this is more or less correct apart from this bit:
>So, unless you consent to enter into a contract with Irish Water, the Water Services Authority will still continue to supply you with YOUR water.


Myth 2: This is wrong, they can turn down your water. 
From citizens information:
>Question K:
What if I don’t pay my domestic water bill?
Answer K:
Irish Water will offer easy payment options (see Question H above) but if you don’t pay your bills it can reduce your water supply. However, you will not be cut off completely.
Free allowances (see Question C above) will only be provided to people who pay charges in a timely manner.
http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/water_services/water_charges.html


Myth 3: This is correct, it's not the law that you have sign up. But, if you don't you will be billed without an allowence.


Myth 4: I don't really know much about this. But from some comments around here it is a subsidary of Bord Gas. Irish Water is a semi-state company. I don't know enough about this to expand, so hopefully someone else can.


Myth 5: This is the biggest pile of scaremongering here. Yes, you don't have to supply your PPS number but again not doing so will result in you being charged the full amount i.e. no allowance.
As for the them have all your personal, financial, medical and social (PPS) information. Not true. Simply not true. I didn't even look this up, I just remebered that when I was signed on to the dole last year I had to fill in the information for any savings/earnings etc to the Department of Social Protection. Since they obviously don't have access to my bank account, my earning history from the Revenue, why would Irish Water be able to get this information from them.


Myth 6: This is correct, they cannot take money from you like say the LPT. They would need to go through the courts to get money off you. Take what you want from the "NO CONSENT. NO CONTRACT" bit.


Myth 7: I don't know about the meter being a contract bit. It's the second paragraph that is amazing.
>Also, if you wish, you may advise Irish Water that the meter will be considered abandoned property, whether its on public or private land, it is connected to your house, and that they have 21 days to remove the device or you will remove it, and destroy it, “without prejudice or liability” (this last bit means they cannot charge you for the cost of the meter if you remove it or destroy it).


You are simply destroying private property here and you will be liable even if you say "no take backs".


Myth 8: This is correct, your landlord cannot sign you up. 


> While the PRTB are asking landlords/letting agencies to gather PPS numbers to register tenants, it turns out that this little practice is entirely ILLEGAL!


I haven't heard anything about this TBH but yeah, I'd imagine it is illegal.


Myth 9: This is true, they fix the first leak on your property. Citizens information again:
>Question F:
How can I measure my water usage, check for hidden leaks, and reduce my usage?
Answer F:
The water meters will be accessible for householders to check. You can monitor your usage by checking the meter regularly.
You can identify leaks by checking the meter before and after a period when the water system isn’t being used – for example, if you are away for the weekend. Notify Irish Water if you find a leak. There will be a 'free first fix' scheme for leaks on the customer side of the meter – Irish Water will be announcing details shortly.


The last bit I won't go into much detail apart from the bit about 
>“Sign-up, or else” “Or else what?” “Nothing, your were supposed to just sign up!”


The Water Act 2007 does have sections relating to offences and prosecutions, sections 9 & 10.

I'm not a lawyer, so I don't want to give any wrong advice from the way I may interpret the law. Give the relevant sections a read if you want to know more, just be warned it nearly gave me a nosebleed.
With video evidence it's open and shut.
Thanks for the link. Yer one deserved it the Mongoloid.
Guy in work asked me yesterday to have a read off it and what I thought of it. He was genuinely looking for some advice and wanted to see if any of this shit holds through. Had a good read over it, the couple sections of the relevant citizens info site and the water act (heavy fucking reading there lads). Found a handful of errors. Told my colleague if I can find this many errors/lies, the whole thing is probably wank.

To be fair, the sub was the only one I've seen or heard of since.
For the lazy:

> The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has set out its proposals for the water charging system.These proposals are based on consumption of 66,000 litres per year for a one-person household, with an additional 21,000 litres per year for each extra person. They include:

>A free allowance of 30,000 litres per household, with an extra free allowance of 21,000 litres per child.
A rate of €4.88 per 1,000 litres for households that use both water services and wastewater services (€2.44 per 1,000 litres if you only use one service).
An average annual bill of €238 per year for households using water and wastewater services, though actual bills will vary for different types of household.
Ah sorry, should've read your op more carefully. Ya I don't see why you can't mail a usb stick or DVD. I mean the likes of Amazon or whatnot do it all the time.
Yes, when I was a kid. I remember my dad took me down to Cork port where there was a French one moored. We were trying to see if they were opening it to the public, but no :-( Must of been one of those many diplomatic missions. Just a silly French man leaning back on his chair with his rifle saying no.

If you live close to a major port you see a nice handful of military ships through the year.

It must be a typo, if this story is true. Bitten last year, admitted to hospital last month & died the next day. 

Yet the wife talks about mopping up all the blood with a roll and a half of loo roll. Was this when he was bitten or last month? Because if it took that much to stop a wound in my neck I'd be straight to the hospital a year ago.

It's been mentioned before that the London figure is irrelevant. While the water infrastructure is larger and costs more, the population density is higher, offsetting the cost and making it cheaper per litre.

Well that's just not right. A normal bathtub is around 200ltrs, so one shower would just under half fill it?? Nope. Put the plug next time you shower, water would be barely over your ankles even for a 15-20min shower. Can't say for power showers though.
Also septic tanks. If you are using one, you pay less for the water.

No problem for customers as RTE have their own app. But obviously UPC would probably prefer to retain people using their app.
Maybe UPC could write an Android app that isn't a stinking pile first. Otherwise RTE will still trump them as they have a decent enough working app already.
Obviously the Gaurds had no intention of actually arresting him, they would have done that where they tackled on the road if that was their intention. They were trying to clear the road & that's no fucking way to do it, dragging someone's face across the tarmac.

Would this mean that prices in cities would fall somewhat? While my wallet likes this idea (I live in one) it sounds like a bad idea to have a two tier billing system based on geography.

Is that already your main source for fresh water or are you in the middle of switching over? If so, was it difficult? Not thinking about it myself, just out of curiosity. Also, you have your own water treatment system?
The form? Are you going to making a stand and not paying? 


Please excuse my ignorance on septic tanks. How would that affect ones water usage?

EDIT: Nevermind http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/environment/water_services/water_charges.html
If you have private water source & you manage your own waste ie septic tank, you are not liable for water charges.
I don't agree with that logic at all. I've had my first learners permit since December and been behind the wheel 3 times since.

This is also true!

Hitler test comment.
It's not a true license though, have you been trained and passed the necessary test to safely operate your tv/radio/internet? 

It's a tax. Again they are not denying you your internet, just like Irish water can't completely cut you off, only lower the water pressure.

Well that's a shitty thing to say.
Just ignore this guy, he's been trolling all the treads the last couple days.
Case in point, Mrs Browns Boys. Was on RTE for years and was shite enough cause RTE. Picked up by the BBC who sold it abroad, it rocketed in popularity in the UK & Oz and now we are paying to have the right to broadcast it. Get your shit together RTE.

ಠ_ಠ
It is a right. You just have to pay for it, we're paying for it now with the subscription fees. They are not denying us the use of the internet, just adding tax effectively.
> The network hashrate causes difficulty to readjust about every ten days. That means if double the mining power was added to the network by the next difficulty calculation, the difficulty would adjust itself by a factor of 2 making it twice as hard to solve a block from the 10 days prior to that.

Nope that paragraph answers my question perfectly, thanks.
So there seems to be a critical mass where if too many people mine its not worth it. But a certain number will always be required as more people simply use BTC day by day.
Except the exchange rate has been on a downward trend since December.

> I've never seen an exponential curve that didn't end up correcting itself in some fashion.

Care to elaborate on this? I don't know enough about what causes the difficulty to change. I know adding blocks will increase difficulty right? So how is it reduced, since more blocks are added all the time.
Didn't realise it had gotten that difficult. Nay I'm not taking the plunge, decided last year it was already too late for me. The hashrate is only going to get harder, as more completed blocks are added to the chain(?). You forgot option 3 for mining, create a bot and have bots mine for you ;-)
Yes but you could join a pool and still make a profit, tiny, but profit. I did the sums sometime last year for my mid range gaming laptop and worked it out to 9c profit per 24 hours. Ordinary people like me won't get rich, but if you a decent gpu lying around you could help pay your electricity bill.
So I'm assuming this legislation won't stop at UPC and Sky. It'll cover all tv and internet subscriptions, including mobile data plans. This sucks. 
But you have internet, also a device that can access those wretched RTE services!
I think he might be referring to mining not just exchanging.
Can someone explain how the new broadcasting license is going to be implemented? 

My understanding was that it applied to every occupied house in the land, effectively like the LPT. But if so, why is Rabbite chasing legislation like this 6 months before the broadcasting license comes into effect.
But they all contain mind altering substances too.
Actually that is trend I heard is true, or was it serial killers?
Boooooo!
Yes you do, it's probably somet to do with the health and safety authority. All persons operating one is required to have the license.
Wife h... Good job!
Out of interest what do you get? And is that wireless or wired?
There was I thinking that they all had to pass an advanced driving course before driving. Also who's this moron at the end saying it's ridiculous? It's ridiculous to have Guards driving at high speed who are not trained.

I grew up not far from this place. I used to cycle and play in the woods next to it, we knew it was a place for young pregnant girls, but were completely oblivious to what actually happened there. Mind you, I grew up in the 90's so hopefully this carry on had stopped by then.
Thanks, this looks great, though I haven't had time to set it up yet. One thing I noticed was missing was bundled ans system apps, any suggestions?
Living up to your name I see ;-)
Cork city here, no problems. What happening with yours? Like someone else said, they're very active on Twitter, usually get a helpful reply in a matter of hours.
Upload speed probably doesn't matter a shit to most people though. It's about d/l mostly I'd expect.
It's their parental decision I guess. I have no problem with under 18s playing these games, as long as both parent & child realise what's up and are informed.
Oh yeah definitely didn't teach him to steer. Just like it won't teach him how to mass murder :-P
Exactly, he is running for public office. Don't you think that he should have left his teacher hat off when replying to tweets to him as a politician? Also, publicly insulting one of your students on social media isn't very nice it is?
That's what confused me about the article, if people got wind of a price hike, everyone could just buy a new phone and null the contract when the price goes up.
That would be lovely, but I don't think they increase anyway during contract. They just phase out old plans/ price hikes when you upgrade.

Surely it'd be encrypted... Oh wait, Ireland.
I no idea, but I would've imagined them using a cell tower to report readings. What are you thinking?
http://m.rte.ie/news/touch/2014/0507/615716-alan-shatter-mick-wallace/
I think you might have misunderstood stood those numbers, or I have. But isn't it the first 30000 free, 38000 for each under 18, then anything over that is payable. And they expect payable to be about 240 Euro. 
All the more reason to get it checked by UPC if it's a new box. I have Horizon too, granted it's a turd, but I get up 80Mbps WiFi and full 120Mbps when wired.
May the 4th be with you.
Wow you got defensive over that. What kind of box? Genuinely intrigued by this technology.
I'd put it here, on the green arrow.

Any idea what it was for?

I imagine they could be using Cork airport to deploy overseas. More going to Syria maybe?
I had a browse through the FB comments. Only thing I've deduced is we probably need culling of the general populace to bring average intelligence back up.
I was more thinking of how it actually measures. Quick Google search brought me this: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_measurement

So she is talking through her hoop.
Just out of interest, how do these specific smart meters work? Any links? 
No that's Douglas I believe.
Nice one! 
I was thinking the same area, the houses on the right match the area. But I think we are looking towards the city centre in the photo. I can't place the hotel building on the left, though that could be long gone. Also I don't recognise the church tower in the background.
Can anyone identify where in cork that is?
I would love a custom firmware so I  access and turn on 5ghz WiFi!
No but seriously, fuck the ndls. Their system is an abomination. 
Huh huh shift the door handle... But seriously, Turkey is nuts for driving. On on trip in a coach bus, we had a car try over take our bus and a truck in front of us in one go. He got half way when a car came in the opposite direction, he jumped into the space between our bus and the truck. Maybe two car lengths space.

Oh! Cutting corners, the same trip the bus was navigating a cliffside road, cutting all the way across the opposite lane as he took blind bends.
Thank you kind sir.
Kudos to the guy and a it's a great picture. But what's the link to r/ireland? Is he Irish? 
Non news. Always remember the odd one or two missing from class when holiday season started. Really don't see the big deal here.
Only recently though. The Austin race, now new Jersey. Before that Indy for like 4 years in the 2000's. And before that nothing since the 60's(?)
Where!? *looks in all the wrong directions*
So 2 feet ≠ 24 inchs then? Right!
There's always something stopping us :-/
This ndls thing is a fucking joke, had the misfortune of getting my provisional recently.
I'm not crying... It's just been raining on my face...

Just spit balling, but would it not be just VAT of 23%?
That's a quality photo of him. Very Hasselhoff-ish.
I agree the 2 year plans are bs personally, it's the only reason I wouldn't upgrade to it. 
Bear in mind the OS goes into that 16gb too, so you might only have 12gb to yourself(?) Personally I would need 32gb.
I'm not sure, I dont think so. And I'm too lazy to check now!
Why was that downvoted? Yes its the 3g plan only.
Edit: 16GB version only though :(
Where is our resident reporter who likes to give these clowns a call?

I agree, an enemy of Ireland would probably be an enemy of England. They wouldn't want an enemy occupation on their backdoor.
Ya, the EU would sanction the hole out from under them. We're a part of the EU not NATO.
I agree, no reason for the downvotes.
No it's a shitty reason smartass, What does NATO have to do with anything? Any country can be shitty.
Such a small country.
Thanks for the apology, but it's not needed. We know they are idiots and bigots & pretty much everyone hates them back.

> I am worrying a little about customs but if bought through Amazon I assume you can mark it as a gift and might give it a better chance.

Nope sorry, I used to work for them for a bit. By marking it as a gift, it means Amazon will wrap it for you. They still declare it.

Op if it was a flyer without a name on it, ignore it. IF by chance someone calls to the door, don't admit or deny anything, don't give them your details and don't let them in. 
Why is this being downvoted? If they don't have your name they can't summon you. Had the same flyer over a year ago, chunked it in the bin, last I heard from them.
Nope, don't contact them. Unless the letter was directly addressed to the resident they are just blindly chasing. Don't admit or deny or give your details.
If he was still seeding after the first strike maybe?
That is nuts! 
F**king hell! Just out of curiosity, has there been an evac order? This seems too mental to just tough it out.

I thought this was common knowledge no? There is even a song by the wolf tones about it, joke was that the song was released before the escape actually happened.
Agreed, apparently they are one of the best performing postal services in Europe.
Unrelated query, have you ever ordered say a tv or the like from the .de site? I'm in the market for one, but unsure if it'll come with english. Probably silly question, just that what I was looking at doesn't seem to have reviews that are not in German. :-/
Thanks for the input, it is something I will chase, but I was looking for new box to buy. As going through suppliers may take till after Christmas to sort out.

Weak link, but I don't feel like you deserve too much attention.
Most definitely other stores, the likes of gamestop will with most if their stores, but again, pre orders. Keep an eye on xrtavisions social media pages for news?
Select Smyths are for the Xbox I know, check the website for which stores. But availability will probably be zero, all pre ordered I'd suspect.

How are we supposed to help if you block out the phone number!?
Not true about the data centre. They do have a call centre by the airport though, so that does need a decent infrastructure. Nothing out of the ordinary, it's still just another office building with people on pc's and the phone. Used to work for them...
I completely agree to this to rule out the slow speed us down to isp.
I think it's supposed to be impressive?
Almost certainly router or WiFi card settings.
whoa... Flashbacks to Blackboard Jungle there.
Why not explain instead of just down voting guys!? OP us talking about the multiplayer stock market.

Do some research online and see if it's a known issue that the manufacturer has dealt with before, repairing/replacing. Manufacturer may help if their is a history.
Ah! Big difference so, there is visible damage to the screen. If not dropped, there may have been pressure applied to the screen while in the bag maybe? Anyway, you case is much harder/nigh impossible now. Retailer will unlikely do anything else for you. Try contacting the manufacturer, it might be an known issue. But after that tough luck I'm afraid. Sorry.
Bang on what he said. Go in yourself and put forward your points, but don't start an argument as it'll be harder to get anything from a person who you put on the defensive. Failing that, contact their head office. Again keep all encounters as professional as possible.

Ahah fair enough! So if you don't mind, what part of the country are you getting those 4G speeds?
Well then I'd say there is something wrong with your UPC connection, since their slowest advertised speed to 50Mb. What are you paying for?
And where are you? I'm in Cork and was wondering about there 4G here.
which pages? His, RTE's or the shows? I want to read all the idiotic comments.
I can confirm EMC does this. We ship around 700,000 drives per quarter, from our area, in one facility. These are either partially loaded or fully loaded enclosures. Some are shipped direct to customer as field upgrades, some to populate cab racks which is probably what is seen in the picture.
Uhh thatnks, I forgot about that feature!
It's dropbox, so I'm guessing HTC. My one x came with 25gb free...
Probably ribbed that too, the dirty fecker!
Thanks for trying, have an upvote.
They have control of the page back, all the gossip is gone.
Yep, realised that when I got there. *facepalm*
Thank you, I'll head on over and post to r/zeos.
No. It's still trending downwards. Wait for the bottom out to maximise profits from any upward movement.
I'd pull out, it hasn't even come close to bottoming out yet. Your going to have a long wait to see it turn a profit. You should wait till a stock hits rock bottom or begins rising.
Yes, sorry OP but this makes zero sense.
Yay! My very first Greg post! :-D
As seen in the video, it'll break a lock faster than it would bend a frame. Probably a few scratches alright though!
Yes
I agree, don't be so quick to simply pull the plug on it. Give them a chance to fix it. I'm sure it's a fault somewhere. I have never gotten less than what I pay for with their internet. As for the TV, it defo needs a lot of work! As for sky, internet is only 24Meg...
It's all about the leverage here.
Not really relevant to this post though, but yes if you are talking specifics...
Agree. I don't need a headline like "What It’s Like to Plan Your Own Gang Bang" popping up in work...
I believe it is lower. There are 3 VAT rates, a,b & c. 'A' is for perishables and carries a lower tax than the other two. 
I believe that statement is an oxymoron? :-P

Web work house?
Got out last night, moved over to BET till the next big one.
Tap the column header to reorder it o_O
Smyths and Tesco are great for bug name releases and charts, after that it'd be amazon I would say.
Because some if us like to play single player after the main story. All the side missions, encounters, properties & Easter eggs. We need to build money to sustain life in single player. Plus it's good practice for when the online component kicks in.
BET is the highest % mover, but low returns as we are quite late to that party. I'm waiting to see what happens to ZIT & BDG, both are close to bottoming out.
Your bank has told you they cannot cancel funds requested from your account? That's not absurd at all! Ok, get back onto Amazon, ask them for the transaction number of this extra requested money (can't remember what they call it exactly), they should email it to you along with an explanation with permission to cancel it. Bring this to your bank and they'll process it. Funds will still take a few days to appear back in your account, but should be less than 7-8 days, depending on your bank. 

Source: I think that's how it worked when I worked there.
Yes Amazon charge when they ship, not when you receive. By that logic I would assume your bank can cancel the 'reserve' and not affect your order as it's been shipped already. It may have been a fault at Amazons end (we dont know), but fastest way to fix this is between you and your bank.
You could sell all the HAL stock, take the profit and reinvest, then keep that as an alternate save. Then you would have your initial investment plus all the profit invested should it start increasing again.
Ya it doesn't move much either way. I think it was there to get you interested in playing with stocks.
1000 shares I believe, valued at 100k total.

I think it's time to get ready to bail! Gonna wait to see what the next 4 updates are like, then make a decision then.
Ya looks fine, but looking at the movements indiviually, it seems to slowing down. I'm getting ready to cash out.
I caught the wave just before it skyrocketed, profit somewhere around $115M right now. If you look at GTAVstocks.com tracking the movements, it look me that the increases have been becoming smaller.
Don't want to sound alarmist, but does anyone else think HAL is slowing down? Thoughts?
I can confirm, in-game is over $100. There's always a small disconnect between all the sources, no idea why.
A cap of some sort would make sense. Anyone else seen a higher change in a 24hr period? 
Also I believe a lot of people are still pumping a ton of money into PIS, BET & AMU, as well as HAL. No idea what kind of a split though.
Flying here in the Douglas area, getting exactly what I pay for, 100Mbps d/l and 10 u/l
No idea, found it in r/gaming.
I am open to being corrected as I've only been following the XBox news, but BAWSAQ has not been opened to online multiplayer yet. It does work in single player, that's why you're seeing a lot of chatter in this sub-reddit about it.

EDIT: spelling.
Take a look at HAL on XBox, it's nearly doubled in the last 24hrs. Does that throw point 1 out the window?
http://www.reddit.com/r/GTAMarket/comments/1oht0e/is_the_stock_market_offline_on_ps3_or_is_it_just/
There's no announcement yet afaik, but a good guess is would be end of the month as they announced this a few days ago:

If your talking about online, it's not been up yet, rock* are still working out the kinks. Single player stockmarkets are working though.
>HAL just dropped a bit (30.87 to 30.72)... But Pisswasser still going up (66.69 to 67.40).

>I'm gonne sell HAL just to be safe.

Just to clarify, the above is ps3, Xbox is still moving up fast.

I only bought into HAL when the market started updating again two days ago, it's soaring through 80% right now for me, so happy!
Can't wait for the movie!
Not just in his world, in Ireland. Several years of retail behind me as source. Also, I'd agree that the 45e should have been the total as he paid it off, but that's my opinion. If they're doing it, it's probably a shitty legal loophole.
OP? Can you clarify if these are sterling prices, or was Tesco really selling for €35???
I wish they didn't overlay the the maps onto each other.

UPC are great for the net, you will get what you pay for and its reasonably priced. Unlimited too for most bundles. With the contract, it is 12months, but as far as I know you can move house and they'll transfer it over. If the new place isn't serviced by UPC they'll cancel your contract with no penalty to you. So maybe you could use that to end the contract when you need too...? 
Lol let me know how you get on with it. Really curious is it just my box or the software.
> No the person was in UPC Ireland here.

Well then, they'd want to pull themselves together then!

Please ask if its not too much trouble, any info on an f/w update would be handy.

EDIT: Just did a bit more research and it's much closer to 58% - 25% to iOS globally & 53% - 40% for Ireland.
Unfortunately this is how it is with larger companies, regarding the communications. The relevant person might not even be part of UPC Ireland. 

I do have faith in the system for the future, but I don't think it was ready for launch just yet. Don't suppose your connection in UPC can get any info with the H2 firmware that's been released in Europe? 
I know, I was very surprised not have it ready for launch or even as a priority over Apple. I've seen figures of 80%(?) market share for Android and only 14% for Apple... 

EDIT: Just did a bit more research and it's much closer to 58% - 25% to iOS globally & 53% - 40% for Ireland.
Yes, though not through the app, as its not released yet. You have to log into the Horizon TV website and stream from there, roundabout way, but that's the way it is at the moment... From what I've read, I can stream 19(?) channels, but only while my own LAN.
Ya I seen that massive thread on boards, took a leap of faith as that was the thread for the beta tests. It seems like a decent system, just needs the fecking bugs worked out of the software.  
What do you mean it doesn't accept android? The app is on the way, also I've been able to add my droid to the home network and stream stuff stored on my phone to the TV.
Ordered it last night as my package was already 73e a month, so its just the activation fee to pay extra. Also, there's a boards.is thread about the test phase they did with sample customers, they were saying it's still buggy as shit... Then again I don't like the people over at boards, so I'm not taking their word to seriously.
Lots of chatter still on twitter, no one is confirming that they have the 3rd guy & the heli is still around... #gardai will get ya most tweets.

I didn't think the army would have any interest or jurisdiction, to aid the gardai in the fashion that's being reported. 
Fecking hell! I want to sleep, but this drama might just keep me glued to net *sigh*
