That's what humans did to evolve before we had societies ruled by Chad who wants all women for himself.
Because years of evolution have made men opportunistic. I want my genes to spread? Better impregnate as many women I can. A woman can only have so many children before menopause – that's why she has to be selective about her partner, to make sure her children survive. Healthy man = healthy children. For some reason certain aesthetics are associated with health.

You're not getting anything from being nice to strangers you won't meet again. If anything, you're wasting energy. Who cares about their feelings? You can act nice towards someone but if you find out they're not trying to fuck with you, fuck their feelings. You sound like a betacuck tbh.
But how does treating people badly affect you if you'll never meet them again? I'm not trolling, I want a good answer.

How many hours can I squeeze into a week? 20 tops, and that's with less than 8 hours sleep per night. That's like 80 hours a month. How much may I earn per hour? Maybe $8.5... That's about like $420 after taxes, or $50K/year post taxes. I mean that'd be nice, but I'd be doing worse in school (less time to study), I wouldn't have any time for hobbies, and I wouldn't sleep as well and thus sacrifice my gym gains (and school once again).

The author reveals himself as a character, but he says something like "This is where I stop telling the story and you get to continue it. Everyone in this story will keep on living in your mind."

En enkel lore-förklaring för karaktärens hårfärg är att en mutation skedde. 

Det *är* möjligt (men mindre vanligt) för blonda föräldrar att föda mörkhåriga barn. Vi har dock ännu inte förstått *atavism* (vilket det här skulle kunna beskrivas som) fullt ut. [Här](http://genetics.thetech.org/ask/ask343) svarar en forskare från Stanford University på en liknande fråga. Det korta svaret verkar vara att det finns så många faktorer som spelar in. [Här](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/ampp3d/how-white-baby-can-born-4145688) är en artikel som tar upp ett liknande ämne. [Här](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1093674/The-tragic-story-white-girl-born-black-tore-family-apart.html) är ytterligare en sådan. 
Det verkar stämma. Hade ingen aning om det. Enligt [denna](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/smaland/fem-om-yttrandefrihet) artikel innebär yttrandefrihet att 

> ”Var och en har rätt till åsiktsfrihet och yttrandefrihet. Denna rätt innefattar frihet att utan ingripande hysa åsikter samt söka, ta emot och sprida information och idéer med hjälp av alla uttrycksmedel och oberoende av gränser.”

Om den ska vara oberoende av gränser men att vi sedan har en grundlag som sätter gränser (t.ex. rörande förtal) så inskränks ju faktiskt yttrandefriheten i Sverige.
B = Brun (dominant)

b = blond (recessiv)

Utveckla gärna. Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen ger svenska medborgare en begränsad frihet, en frihet att uttrycka saker utan att kränka eller förtala folk. Du får säga rätt mycket, men inte vad som helst.

För övrigt gäller väl yttrandefrihet ej på Reddit?

> Webbplatser som innehåller exempelvis diskussionsforum och gästböcker omfattas inte av yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen eftersom de kan ändras av andra än redaktionen. Om varje inlägg godkänns av redaktionen innan det publiceras är det däremot möjligt att få utgivningsbevis.

My first console was N64 (SM64 is still one of the best games ever), but then around 2006 my dad bought a chipped Xbox. I only played emulated N64 games on it, though. I was five years old back then. I also recieved a Gameboy Advance from a relative, and started playing Pokemon on it. On the Xbox I mostly played Super Smash Bros. 

Then around 2007 my pops bought a flashed Xbox 360. Unfortunately I couldn't play online (beside the fact that it would require a subscription). So I'd spend most of my days at a friend's house playing Xbox 360. He had played Halo CE and Halo 2, and he showed me Halo 3. We beat the game multiple times with different difficulties, and we collected skulls. I loved that game. We managed to beat it on Legendary. We'd also gather a bunch of friends and play local custom games. We'd mostly play infected with the last Spartan becoming super fast. We'd also play online with split screen. 

Those memories are so great. I remember people would make custom games lobbies and invite randoms. I also remember playing the last few maps LASO online with a group of like 6 people or something. And I remember when Griffball first came. We'd be up all night playing that. And Rocket Race.

I went on to play MW2 and try some trickshotting, but finally realized it wasn't for me. Played some COD zombies occasionally. Of course I beat every Halo past Halo 3 on Legendary (except Halo 5). I heard about MCC and bought an Xbox One. Bought that game and Xbox Live as well. Beat all the games in the collection in 2-player local CO-OP with my cousin. Halo 2 was the hardest. Then I bought Halo 5. I hadn't really liked Halo 4 (the gameplay) and Halo 5 also kind of felt pretty bland to me. I'm still yet to complete the last two or three maps on Legendary in Halo 5. The Warden is so hard to beat sometimes.

Meritokrati var termen jag letade efter. Det innebär att den som är bildad inom socioekonomi har möjligheten att bestämma hur landet ska styras. Då har folket alltså har mer makt än i en stark diktatur där en person har järnhand a la Stalin. Dessutom existerar ingen planekonomi i dagens Kina, utan det har blivit en fulländad marknadsekonomi. Eftersom folk har möjlighet att styra landet om de är intresserade, och eftersom det existerar en marknadsekonomi, har alltså Kina en del demokratiska egenskaper och kan placeras på spektrumet (demokrati-auktoritäritet) närmare demokrati än en del andra stater (*host* Nordkorea), vilket var hela min poäng från början. Ja, Kina lutar mer åt auktoritäritet än mot demokrati. Nej, kommunism exkluderar ej demokrati per automatik. Däremot kräver kommunism en mäktig stat. Det går absolut att ha en mäktig stat i en demokrati.

Dessutom existerar lokala demokratiska val i Kina, och har gjort det sedan 80-talet. Hur meningsfulla de valen är och huruvida resultaten följs utan att fifflas med kan ju frågas, men ett land med folkval är inte en extremt stark diktatur. Jämför Sovjetunionen. Ett exempel på Kinas korruption angående folkval:

> Authorities were eager to show off what they describe as democracy “with Chinese characteristics”, with officials ushering dozens of reporters into a polling station in Xingfu, in central Beijing.

> Voters filled out their pink ballot papers in front of officials, ignoring a screened-off area labelled “Secret Balloting Place”.

> Chinese law states that anyone over 18, who has not been stripped of their political rights, can stand for election and vote. 

> “Ethnicity, gender, party, residence, economic situation, there are no limits,” crowed Liu Xiancai, who heads the Xingfu election office.

https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/11/16/chinas-local-elections-democracy-chinese-characteristics/

Edit: Från källan du länkade, bokstavligen första stycket:

> Kina är en enpartistat utan allmänna och fria val [FEL, de har lokala val]. Politisk opposition är inte 
tillåten. Statsapparaten genomsyras av kommunistpartiet. Rättsväsendet är underställt kommunistpartiets kontroll. **Författningen garanterar allmän åsikts-, yttrande-, tryck-, förenings-, mötes-, demonstrations-och religionsfrihet, men i praktiken är samtliga friheter inskränkta i varierande grad**.

Det är precis det jag velat påpeka. Kina är en demokrati med en regering som är korrupt och bryter mot de fundamentala kraven på en demokratisk stat. Skulle regeringen verka efter "författningen" skulle Kina vara en helt vanlig demokrati (med en nuvarande socialistisk regering). 

För övrigt säger Sveriges grundlagar emot sig själva (genom att ha *begränsad* yttrande- och tryck*frihet*, då vissa ord kan göra folk upprörda), men det talas knappast om.

> Du har rätt att sprida vilken information du vill i tryckt form så länge du följer lagen. Samtidigt som tryckfrihetsförordningen ger oss frihet att uttrycka oss fritt skyddar den oss mot förtal och kränkningar. Skriver du något som kan betraktas som hets mot folkgrupp, till exempel rasistiska inlägg, eller publicerar bilder med inslag av sexuellt våld kan det räknas som brott mot tryckfrihetsförordningen. Det gäller också om staten och samhället skadas genom att något som innebär landsförräderi eller spioneri publiceras.

https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Sa-funkar-riksdagen/Demokrati/Grundlagarna/

Läs den första meningen... Det är en oxymoron. Du har rätt att sprida vilken information du vill i tryckt form, förutom det staten inte godkänner. Du har rätt att sprida vilken information du vill så länge staten godkänner det i tryckt form, för i en stark demokrati skulle din tryckfrihet inte begränsas. Sverige är alltså inte superdemokratiskt (som exempelvis Schweiz).
Kina är en demokratisk socialistisk kapitalism med hög korruption, vilket innebär valfusk.

Kommunism är motsatsen till kapitalism. Du kan ha en kommunistisk demokrati eller en kapitalistisk diktatur. Lite av själva grejen med kommunism är att alla har lika värde, och att alla har rätt att få sin röst hörd. Fascistiska länder är exempel på kapitalistiska diktaturer. Även dagens Kina bör räknas som en kapitalistisk diktatur. Du har dock kunnat rösta både i kommunistiska Kina och i Sovjet. De var alltså kommunistiska demokratier. Hur korrupta de faktiskt var är en annan fråga. Min poäng är bara att kommunism och kapitalism inte automatiskt leder till auktoritäritet eller demokrati, eller tvärtom.

Det finns ett spektrum med auktoritäritet (diktatur, absolut monarki) i ena änden och demokrati i den andra. Inget land är absolut auktoritärt eller demokratiskt, men när det ligger närmare ena änden än den andra brukar vi benämna landet som hur det beskrivs av den närmare änden.

Jag menade inte att det jag nämnde är ett hål i demokratin i sig, men snarare en nackdel. Ingen vill någonsin diskutera demokratins nackdelar. Jag tycker det är tråkigt att vi växer upp utan att kunna diskutera dem, för demokrati är ju *så perfekt*.

Jag är inte kommunist (lol). Jag erkänner bara att det finns fördelar och nackdelar med alla system och ideologier. Idag lutar jag mer mot socialliberalismen. Det är hursomhelst irrelevant, och att du avviker från diskussionen (med ad-hominem-argumentation) säger mig bara att du inte har något mer vettigt att komma med.
Bastion?
This dude Kenny from Horseshoe Gang as well.
Det är ett spektrum, och alla länder är mer eller mindre demokratiska. Om du vill kunna påverka staten i Kina får du ta och skaffa dig en utbildning inom politik/ekonomi. 

De som förespråkar Kinas system menar att det systemet är fördelaktigt av anledningen att mer kompetenta individer bestämmer hur landet ska styras, så att de som inte kan något om politik/ekonomi håller sig utanför. Det är alltså inte omöjligt för kinesiska medborgare att få sina röster hörda. Det är iallafall så det ska fungera i teorin, men hur bra det fungerar i praktiken är en annan fråga. Det finns inget felfritt system.

Det tar mig tillbaka till modern västvärldens demokrati. Ett stort hål i demokratin är att bara majoritetens intresse följs. Det innebär att minoriteters intressen ignoreras. Det kan leda till… *intressanta* situationer (förtryck). Se exempelvis Katalonien.

Låt mig förtydliga. 

Ex. 1: Nästan alla kvinnor pluggar. De är utspridda mellan många olika utbildningar, beroende på sina personliga intressen.

Ex. 2: Nästan inga kvinnor pluggar. De är koncentrerade inom ett fåtal utbildningar, de utbildningar med mest fördelar.

Jag hade hållt med de argumenten ifall unika, hotade arter i skärgården skulle råka illa ut. Frågan är skulle denna utveckling ha någon negativ påverkan på ekosystemet, och isåfall hur? Skulle det leda till en minskning av fisk- och fågelpopulationer? Möjligtvis, men det *skulle* även kunna innebära en väldigt liten förändring, då det rör sig om en så liten areal.
God poäng, men vilka hotade arter lever i skärgården? Det är väl rätt dött där? Inte många arter som trivs vid brackvatten etc. På sin höjd är det väl vissa sälarter som bör skyddas.

What about the Droid attack on *R E D*?
Do you know how common rape has been during war time? An army would invade a village or town, kill the men, and rape the women.
> Humans are sexually dimorphic but within this balanced range.

In 9 months a human female will be able to "create" one individual (ignoring anomalies like twins, triplets and so forth), while a human male will be able to "create" around 270 individuals within the same time span. This means that it would be faster for 10 men and 90 women to repopulate the Earth than 90 men and 10 women. Basically, if you as a stone age man want to make sure your genes are passed down, knocking up as many women as you can is your best option. The hypothesis is that polygyny was more common than polyandry in the past.

> The ideal type for men and women varies so much across cultures and over time. If evolution were the cause, ideal types should be more stable.

You can't deny that a human male will be attracted to a human female who looks fit to carry and take care of a baby (wide hips, large breasts, etc.) and that a human female will be attracted to a human male who looks fit to defend her and the baby (tall, large muscles, etc.). Anywhere on this planet you'll find that to be true, or at the very least have been true until we started to form societies. Following the former hypothesis, human females would've been more picky about these featured though, as human males mostly wanted to pass on their genes (get jiggy). The choice of a mate impacts a woman harder than a man, basically. The woman has sex and then has to raise a child, where as the man can have sex as much as he likes. Of course, with rape being unacceped in today's society, combined with things like child support, men are no longer able to have as much sex as they would want. Whether that is bad or good is up for you to decide.
This is kind of what started that MGTOW thing. They realized companionship is unimportant. [insert OP is a faggot meme]
While I agree with what you said, you didn't answer the question. Is there anything of value beyond sexual interaction that a woman can offer a man?
I just want a fuck buddy tbh but that's asking too much. I'll just settle with porn the rest of my life. Probably get a robot wife or something.
You're referring to truecels. And by your definition, every incel would simultaneously be a gymcel. Also, how old would one have to be in order to qualify as an incel? Some would say 20 while others would say 40.
> You all want to be treated like such victims yet you all victimize everyone else.

What came first, the chicken or the egg?

> You want some empathy? Then show some fucking empathy.

Empathy for whom? And telling people with trouble of showing empathy to be empathic is equivalent to telling a depressed individual to simply be happy.

> Or just sit here and call everyone a cuck, normie, chad, roastie, cunt, bitch while you feel sorry for yourselves.

That's a way of coping. Would you rather have people on this sub commit suicide?
Stacies though?
But what if you're 6'2", have a decent jaw line, have a decent facial symmetry, but you're skinny-fat, autistic, too broke for nice clothes, and in need of a haircut (meIRL)? Height is far from everything. Trust me. If it were, I wouldn't be here. 

Johnny Bravo looking mofos aren't the only people out there getting girls, you know? If you're aiming for Victoria's Secret models, you might be getting ahead of yourself. Ugly people have to settle with ugly people. That's how it works. The Chads get the Stacies, the Knormans get the Knormans, and the Incels get the scraps (or they settle for anime traps). The big issue is people having too high standards when searching for partners. Don't bite off more than you can chew.

Alla exempel på användning av ordet genus är kopplade till språket. Han/hon/den/det.

Det är omöjligt för lagar att stödas av alla. I en demokrati är det ju de folkvalda som får ta hand om lagstiftning. Det är klart att åsikter varierar, men den åsikt med bäst stöd kommer gå igenom som lag i en välfungerande demokrati.

Lagar är baserade på kollektivt accepterad moral.
Jag var på samma sida som dig tills jag upptäckte att källor som Merriam-Webster påstår att gender och sex ursprungligen hänvisade till olika saker, men att begreppen utvecklades till att betyda samma sak, för att sedan gå tillbaka till sina ursprungliga innebörder. Jag vet inte hur det är med scenskans *genus* respektive *kön*, men det kanske finns ett svar på https://svenska.se/

Uppdatering:

Citat från SAOB om ordet *genus*:

> Genus, eller kön, art, beskaffenhet, lärer mig, antingen säga han hon, eller det, om ett ting, och är Masculinum, Foemininum och Neutrum. 

— Molander Förespel 20 (1753)

Citat från SAOB om ordet *kön*:

> Sammanfattande benämning på vardera av de två stora grupper i vilka (högre stående) organiska varelser indelas med hänsyn till fortplantningsorganen, (grupp av) hannliga resp. honliga individer; särsk. i fråga om människor: män resp. kvinnor, mankön resp. kvinnokön; ofta föregånget av poss. pron. l. annan pronominell bestämning. Folk av bägge (båda) könen; jfr 4. Hon är en prydnad för sitt kön. 

— AJGothus ThesEp. 3: 17 (1619)

I svenskan verkar *genus* mer vara kopplat till språkregler, medan *kön* verkar vara mer kopplat till biologin.
Står inte genus på mitt pass. Schackmatt ateister.

Varför skulle du svara så istället för med grundpotens? (3,7*10^3) kg, alltså. Och varför i såfall inte avrunda 3,7 till 4?
Problemet är att min bok tycker det passar bättre att svara i km istället för m ibland, eller h istället för s. Det var även en uppgift där svaret i facit stod i år medan jag hade räknat ut samma svar fast i sekunder. Jag förstår att det blir väldigt många sekunder (och därför mindre lämpligt att svara i sekunder istället för år), men det blir ju dels mer exakt och dels besvarat i med hjälp av en SI-enhet. Samma uppgift ville att du skulle multiplicera med antal dagar på ett år. Boken hade multiplicerat med 365 istället för 365,25. Det är sådana saker jag stör mig på. Det kan ju förändra svaret en hel del.

Drogrelaterade dödsfall minskade i Portugal när droger avkriminaliserades. En del spekulerar att avkriminaliseringen tog bort stigmatiseringen runt drogbruk, så att de med skadliga beroenden vågade söka hjälp. 

De flesta tror att droger är farliga och att alla kommer börja gå runt helt virriga i huvudet om droger vore lagliga. Återigen, se Portugal. Det är skillnad på bruk och missbruk (egentligen "skadligt bruk").

Sad thing is that when pregnant mothers consume dihydrogen monoxide, it's passed on to the babies. Our kidneys and gall bladders are supposed to remove dihydrogen monoxide from our bodies, but it doesn't help much when we keep consuming it. I went vegan, but then I found out dihydrogen monoxide even is in our food! Now I've been eating nothing but 100% organic salt from Bolivia for two days, and I already feel so much better! It really helps detoxifying your body. You should definitely try it! I've lost a little weight, too!
But are FPS really the bottleneck? Wouldn't the tick rates and the players' ping speeds be of more value? If you play on a LAN network where everyone has 5 ping, does FPS (above your refresh rate) really matter? Would adaptive sync make any difference?  Would you be able to spot the difference in a blind test? How much does the response time of the monitor impact the gameplay? I think we need to get /u/3kliksphilip on this case.

Lower your graphics settings if you want more than 150 FPS. The computer game standard is 60 FPS. Competitive games are usually played at 144 Hz. It's unrealistic to demand VALVe to optimize the game for 6 years old GPU's to be able to run the game at max settings with no FPS dips below 166 or something like that. It would be nice if they indeed worked a little on the optimization, but y'all sound like spoiled children. You paid how much for the game? $13? How old is the game now? lmao

Aaaaand this is why I hate maths. You don't have to know (in-depth) how a computer works to be able to solve problems with it. The same way, you don't really have to know mathematics (in-depth) to solve problems. It is of course good to why certain things are as they be, but I doubt they'll help you solve the problem.
Don't smoke and Reddit, kids!

"Alla [i förorten]" är att överdriva kraftigt. Känner otroligt många invandrare som vill bli läkare och jurister.

Alltså medicinska skäl. Sen om en vuxen person vill operera sitt könsorgan av kosmetiska skäl så är väl det ändå upp till dem?
"Apa" är typ en av de vanligaste förolämpningarna mörkhyade får höra. Förr, genom rasbiologin, dehumaniserades den så kallade "negroiden" (mörkhyade människan) och jämfördes med apan. Möjligtvis så att ljushyade människor inte skulle motsätta sig kolonialism och slavhandel med just mörkhyade människor. Den europeiske, ljushyade mannen påstods vara mer civiliserad än den afrikanska, mörkhyade mannen.

Sorry, I'm bad with titles.
Work on that camera shake a little bit (you should try the plug-in called Twitch from Video Copilot or the one called S_Shake from Boris FX). The rest was on point. I especially liked the fishing part.

Or maybe poop knives are normal?
Varies for me. Sometimes I take shits two consecutive days, sometimes it's every third or fourth day.
Sometimes sharpness seems to be turned up too much as well.
It does look better if you're used to high refresh rates. I don't mind the blur.

Du läste fel. Jag skrev "äppELpaj > äppLEpaj". Tecknet > betyder "är större än", men kan tolkas som "är bättre än". Jag förespråkade alltså varken "äpplepaj" eller "semlebageri".
Aldrig hört eller sett någon använde "äpplepaj". Tror inte att det är något unikt för Skåne.
Nope. Född och uppvuxen i Uppland. Föräldrar likaså.
Då har du nog aldrig besökt [Danmark](https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/kolumnister/hermanlindqvist/article11667451.ab). Eller [Malta](http://www.kulturarv.dk/1001fortaellinger/en_GB/antvorskov-abbey/stories/is-the-danish-flag-the-flag-of-malta), för den delen.
"Behå" är uttalet av "BH", vilket är en förkortning av "bysthållare".
Du implicerar att du bara har ett intresse. Du kan ju ha ett intressant arbete och syssla med andra intressen på fritiden.
Fast då kopplar du ju aldrig av? Att sova 12h/dygn är det bästa som finns.
Du klappar *under* var stavelse, alltså samtidigt som du läser ordet. Titta på valfritt avsnitt av typ Keeping up with the Kardashians, Love & Hip-Hop, The Real Housewives of [amerikansk tätort] etc. och lyssna hur kvinnorna klappar händerna när de argumenterar.

/r/DankMemes might help you with that. (Consuming Tide pods is a new meme)
That one was great! Thanks!
I thought it was too complicated and in-depth. All I want is a simple tl;dr, not some 20 minute article.
That's all a big mess. I thought the BBC article in the OP was great though.
But you don't know any of those, right? Me neither. I think that's why most people buy things at easily accessible stores.
Why is pi-hole better than regular hosts blocking combined with something like uBlock Origin and Ghostery?

Even if she said it, the main focus should be her physically assaulting someone. Sticks and stones...
Should add Jar Jar as a villain.
Yep, I need this in my life. Right now, I'll have to do with softcore shit on Reddit and Instagram. Some camgirls are on point too. MyFreeCams ftw.
Let's say you haven't seen the prequels. The trailer gives away too much. "She carries twins" and everything past that should be modified.
