You had to dig up an irrelevant three year old article on Donald Trump to justify calling for the death of people in a subreddit about digital piracy? Surely you can see the fallacy in that line of thought.

Your submission has been removed for one of the following reason(s):


**4a. General submission**

Questions on topics that have been previously discussed at length will be removed. Ex: what is the best streaming site? Where can I find X book? Is X site safe? 

Please use the **search bar** to find the answer to your question.



**4b. Video game tech support**

For assistance with pirating video games including installation, applying cracks, modding, and more, visitr/cracksupport.



**4c. VPNs, ISP copyright notices, and legal inquiries**


r/Piracy hosts an [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/faq) with information regarding the importance of utilizing a VPN while torrenting, and basic information about ISP copyright notices/violations. While the repercussions for pirating content vary by country, what may be a simple educational warning in one country may be a suspension/termination of your internet service in another country. Your ISP may have outlined in detail how to proceed and if you wish to continue torrenting, you will have to purchase a VPN service. Note that VPN companies aggressively market their services throughout Reddit. Most if not all of the popular VPNs offer free trials or a 7-day money back guarantee. Take advantage of these perks and test them out prior to pledging to buy their services.

VPNs are also corporate entities. Do your research before you confide in one with all your data. The following are some communities that may be of interest:

 * r/legaladvice
 * r/VPNtorrents
 * r/VPN

Damn this is a great way to build up Cass as a heel.
I love how the Spanish commentary team is completely shitting on Titus. It's hilarious
Pop of the night.
Goddamn that Randy pop.
Roman has to win so the WWE can shill out for Saudia Arabia and never let us forget on RAW that Roman defeated Brock Lesnar at the **King Abdullah Sports City in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in the GREATEST Royal Rumble.**

What's up with Cole's insistence on calling him Shin?
But but the lady in the video said Saudia Arabia welcomes everyone?
The commentary team shilling out for Saudia Arabia is just great.
But I was told that Saudia Arabia welcomes everyone?
It's a **privilege** to be there also.
Obviously because it's the GREATEST Royal Rumble!
Anyone keeping a counter on how many times they've said how **appreciative** they are of Saudia Arabia's hospitality?
This feels like those anti\-union corporate videos they force you to watch at your shitty retail job.

I'm getting serious brainwashing vibes.
"Everyone is welcome."
I really wanted to see how prayer time works out in a stadium. Can anyone shed any light?
Yikes. This match is really sloppy so far.
Wonder if its the heat and humidity, but something feels really off about this match.

William is written horribly. It's as if the writers are trying to portray him as a 5 year old. Remember a few episodes back when he was crying about the "bad men?" He just sucks.
This episode was great for so many reasons:

1. No Felicity until the very end.

2. Not bullshit intra-team drama about being distrustful of each other blah blah blah

3. Rene being a sensible and responsible team member and acknowledging he isn't ready for a mission and would only likely jeopardize his team's safety.

4. Anatoly.
It's the same thing in education as well. ***Students with learning disabilities*** or ***students with disabilities*** as opposed to "disabled students."

You must tag the channel/network name. 

Your submission has been removed for one of the following reason(s):


**4a. General submission**

Questions on topics that have been previously discussed at length will be removed. Ex: what is the best streaming site? Where can I find X book? Is X site safe? 

Please use the **search bar** to find the answer to your question.



**4b. Video game tech support**

For assistance with pirating video games including installation, applying cracks, modding, and more, visitr/cracksupport.



**4c. VPNs, ISP copyright notices, and legal inquiries**


r/Piracy hosts an [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/faq) with information regarding the importance of utilizing a VPN while torrenting, and basic information about ISP copyright notices/violations. While the repercussions for pirating content vary by country, what may be a simple educational warning in one country may be a suspension/termination of your internet service in another country. Your ISP may have outlined in detail how to proceed and if you wish to continue torrenting, you will have to purchase a VPN service. Note that VPN companies aggressively market their services throughout Reddit. Most if not all of the popular VPNs offer free trials or a 7-day money back guarantee. Take advantage of these perks and test them out prior to pledging to buy their services.

VPNs are also corporate entities. Do your research before you confide in one with all your data. The following are some communities that may be of interest:

Your submission has been removed for one of the following reason(s):


**4a. General submission**

Questions on topics that have been previously discussed at length will be removed. Ex: what is the best streaming site? Where can I find X book? Is X site safe? 

Please use the **search bar** to find the answer to your question.



**4b. Video game tech support**

For assistance with pirating video games including installation, applying cracks, modding, and more, visitr/cracksupport.



**4c. VPNs, ISP copyright notices, and legal inquiries**


r/Piracy hosts an [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/faq) with information regarding the importance of utilizing a VPN while torrenting, and basic information about ISP copyright notices/violations. While the repercussions for pirating content vary by country, what may be a simple educational warning in one country may be a suspension/termination of your internet service in another country. Your ISP may have outlined in detail how to proceed and if you wish to continue torrenting, you will have to purchase a VPN service. Note that VPN companies aggressively market their services throughout Reddit. Most if not all of the popular VPNs offer free trials or a 7-day money back guarantee. Take advantage of these perks and test them out prior to pledging to buy their services.

VPNs are also corporate entities. Do your research before you confide in one with all your data. The following are some communities that may be of interest:

Your submission was removed for one of the following reason(s):

**1a. Unrelated to digital piracy**

Submissions must be related to the discussion of digital piracy. Although primarily about file-sharing, articles and discussion about ethical issues on unauthorized distribution, legal changes, challenges and so on are welcome. 

**1b. Low effort**

Submissions on r/Piracy must be in readable in English. If English isn't your first language, a proper translation is necessary. If your post makes no sense or is largely open to interpretation to bad grammar, your post will be removed by a moderator. Low effort questions like "when will X game get cracked" or easily searchable questions that have been answered multiple times will be removed. Title-only posts with the few exceptions are not allowed either. Questions that are explicitly answered in our FAQ will be removed, too.

**1c. URL Shorteners**

URL shorteners are not allowed regardless of the purpose. URL shorteners can hide malicious links, track people who click on the links, or other malicious intentions. Even if your link is harmless, your comment or post will be removed.

**1d. Behavior**

 While profanity is permitted, if your submission or comment is riddled in excessively unnecessary profanity and hostility, the moderators may deem your submission or comment as low quality and subject to removal.

I don't understand why there's so much victimization towards Chinese resellers. The notion that that all resellers are just trying to get by and trying to make a living needs to be eradicated. They're not reselling goods out of benevolence, they're not selling goods at a loss, they're not immune to criticism or constructive feedback; they're selling goods for profit and they should be held responsible to a certain expectation of quality of goods and decent customer service. It doesn't matter if you shop at a Gucci store on 5th Ave or buy from an online Chinese reseller, you are engaging in a transaction of money in exchange for goods and deserve attentive customer service.

The sob stories of resellers selling at a loss, making "no money" is a blatant lie; nothing more than an attempt to exempt them from their responsibilities as suppliers. It's evident that these false stories work a great number on susceptible teens like OP, people who romanticize a narrative where they're *cool* with a seller. You do realize you're just as much of a tool as a consumer? You are free advertisement and everyone deserves basic courtesy when buying goods be it retail or counterfeit.

r/Piracy hosts an [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/faq) with information regarding the importance of utilizing a VPN while torrenting, and basic information about ISP copyright notices/violations. While the repercussions for pirating content vary by country, what may be a simple educational warning in one country may be a suspension/termination of your internet service in another country. Your ISP may have outlined in detail how to proceed and if you wish to continue torrenting, you will have to purchase a VPN service.

Being honest? He pulled a bait\-and\-switch, shipped a terrible batch to customers, and now refuses to issue a refund for a item that was not as described. He has yet to take responsibility and always blames the factory. This isn't transparency, it's quite the opposite.
A lot of you guys ate up his BS apology \(did he even say sorry?\) in that [post from a weeks ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/FashionReps/comments/8b64mo/message_from_69callme/)  Stop falling for his lies and CONTACT your shipping agent and request for a refund.

Sorry /u/pfcarrot, your submission has been removed for the following reason(s):


## Rule 1 - Post Requirements

> **Piracy**
>
> Submissions must be related to the discussion of digital piracy. Although primarily about file-sharing, articles and discussion about ethical issues on unauthorized distribution, legal changes, challenges, and so on are all welcome.
> 
> **Effort**
> 
> Posts on /r/Piracy must be in English. If English isn't your first language, a proper translation is necessary. Posts also need to be readable, too. If your post makes no sense or is largely open to interpretation to bad grammar, your post will be removed by a moderator. Low effort questions like "when will [x] game get cracked" or easily searchable questions that have been answered multiple times will be removed. Title-only posts with the few exceptions are not allowed either. Questions that are explicitly answered in our FAQ will be removed, too.
>
> **URL Shorteners**
> 
> URL shortners are not allowed regardless of the purpose. URL shorteners can hide malicious links, track people who click on the links, or other malicious intentions. Even if your link is harmless, your comment or post will be removed.
>
> **Profanity**
>
> Profanity is fine on /r/Piracy. When your post or comment is riddled in excessive profanity, the moderators may deem your submission as low quality and subject to removal.

I think it may have been. It was really uncanny.
Homeland has been renewed for one more final season.
Paley is really deserving of his 'UI' designation.
The way I read his decisiveness was that with Saul gone, Max had to step up and take charge of the operation. Carrie was quite literally in a life and death situation with Yevgeny and his henchmen working their way up the GRU building; had Max hesitated in instructing her, he could've cost her her life. I don't think he put her in that situation as a way to *get her back*, seems very out of character (especially Max who has been loyal since day 1 and been fucked over several times before).
Was Yevgeny really going to kill Simone? I know the camera panning to his handgun alluded to some truth to what Carrie said, but I'm still unsure about it.

Your ISP may have outlined in detail how to proceed and if you wish to continue torrenting, you will have to purchase a VPN service. Note that VPN companies aggressively market their services throughout Reddit. Most if not all of the popular VPNs offer free trials or a 7-day money back guarantee. Take advantage of these perks and test them out prior to pledging to buy their services.

VPNs are also corporate entities. Do your research before you confide in one with all your data. The following are some communities that may be of interest:

 * r/legaladvice
 * r/VPNtorrents
 * r/VPN

Your submission was removed for one of the following reason(s):

**1a. Unrelated to digital piracy**

Submissions must be related to the discussion of digital piracy. Although primarily about file-sharing, articles and discussion about ethical issues on unauthorized distribution, legal changes, challenges and so on are welcome. 

**1b. Low effort**

Submissions on r/Piracy must be in readable in English. If English isn't your first language, a proper translation is necessary. If your post makes no sense or is largely open to interpretation to bad grammar, your post will be removed by a moderator. Low effort questions like "when will X game get cracked" or easily searchable questions that have been answered multiple times will be removed. Title-only posts with the few exceptions are not allowed either. Questions that are explicitly answered in our FAQ will be removed, too.

**1c. URL Shorteners**

URL shorteners are not allowed regardless of the purpose. URL shorteners can hide malicious links, track people who click on the links, or other malicious intentions. Even if your link is harmless, your comment or post will be removed.

**1d. Behavior**

 While profanity is permitted, if your submission or comment is riddled in excessively unnecessary profanity and hostility, the moderators may deem your submission or comment as low quality and subject to removal.

**4c. VPNs, ISP copyright notices, and legal inquiries**


r/Piracy hosts an [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/faq) with information regarding the importance of utilizing a VPN while torrenting, and basic information about ISP copyright notices/violations. While the repercussions for pirating content vary by country, what may be a simple educational warning in one country may be a suspension/termination of your internet service in another country. Your ISP may have outlined in detail how to proceed and if you wish to continue torrenting, you will have to purchase a VPN service. Note that VPN companies aggressively market their services throughout Reddit. Most if not all of the popular VPNs offer free trials or a 7-day money back guarantee. Take advantage of these perks and test them out prior to pledging to buy their services.

VPNs are also corporate entities. Do your research before you confide in one with all your data. The following are some communities that may be of interest:

Your submission was removed for one of the following reason(s):

**1a. Unrelated to digital piracy**

Submissions must be related to the discussion of digital piracy. Although primarily about file-sharing, articles and discussion about ethical issues on unauthorized distribution, legal changes, challenges and so on are welcome. 

**1b. Low effort**

Submissions on r/Piracy must be in readable in English. If English isn't your first language, a proper translation is necessary. If your post makes no sense or is largely open to interpretation to bad grammar, your post will be removed by a moderator. Low effort questions like "when will X game get cracked" or easily searchable questions that have been answered multiple times will be removed. Title-only posts with the few exceptions are not allowed either. Questions that are explicitly answered in our FAQ will be removed, too.

**1c. URL Shorteners**

URL shorteners are not allowed regardless of the purpose. URL shorteners can hide malicious links, track people who click on the links, or other malicious intentions. Even if your link is harmless, your comment or post will be removed.

**1d. Behavior**

 While profanity is permitted, if your submission or comment is riddled in excessively unnecessary profanity and hostility, the moderators may deem your submission or comment as low quality and subject to removal.

Your submission has been removed for one of the following reason(s):


**4a. General submission**

Questions on topics that have been previously discussed at length will be removed. Ex: what is the best streaming site? Where can I find X book? Is X site safe? 

Please use the **search bar** to find the answer to your question.



**4b. Video game tech support**

For assistance with pirating video games including installation, applying cracks, modding, and more, visitr/cracksupport.



**4c. VPNs, ISP copyright notices, and legal inquiries**


r/Piracy hosts an [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/faq) with information regarding the importance of utilizing a VPN while torrenting, and basic information about ISP copyright notices/violations. While the repercussions for pirating content vary by country, what may be a simple educational warning in one country may be a suspension/termination of your internet service in another country. Your ISP may have outlined in detail how to proceed and if you wish to continue torrenting, you will have to purchase a VPN service. Note that VPN companies aggressively market their services throughout Reddit. Most if not all of the popular VPNs offer free trials or a 7-day money back guarantee. Take advantage of these perks and test them out prior to pledging to buy their services.

VPNs are also corporate entities. Do your research before you confide in one with all your data. The following are some communities that may be of interest:

r/Piracy hosts an [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/faq) with information regarding the importance of utilizing a VPN while torrenting, and basic information about ISP copyright notices/violations. While the repercussions for pirating content vary by country, what may be a simple educational warning in one country may be a suspension/termination of your internet service in another country. Your ISP may have outlined in detail how to proceed and if you wish to continue torrenting, you will have to purchase a VPN service.

It is really unfortunate because as you said, Iris is incredible at what she does, which is be Barry's support system. The writers are trying so hard to disassociate her with the 'domestic' role by throwing her so many tasks that it often undermines her character because she can't juggle everything.
For everyone talking about the second tuning fork, Ralph shape shifted his hand into one:

>https://i.imgur.com/ZMKXl7b.png

Kinda genius.
Don't you know? Iris is a strong, black, independent woman who don't need no fancy science smartz to conveniently be a genius in moments of crisis.
Seeing Caitlin look back at the post-its that Killer Frost left her was heartbreaking.

Your submission was removed for one of the following reason(s):

**1a. Unrelated to digital piracy**

Submissions must be related to the discussion of digital piracy. Although primarily about file-sharing, articles and discussion about ethical issues on unauthorized distribution, legal changes, challenges and so on are welcome. 

**1b. Low effort**

Submissions on r/Piracy must be in readable in English. If English isn't your first language, a proper translation is necessary. If your post makes no sense or is largely open to interpretation to bad grammar, your post will be removed by a moderator. Low effort questions like "when will X game get cracked" or easily searchable questions that have been answered multiple times will be removed. Title-only posts with the few exceptions are not allowed either. Questions that are explicitly answered in our FAQ will be removed, too.

**1c. URL Shorteners**

URL shorteners are not allowed regardless of the purpose. URL shorteners can hide malicious links, track people who click on the links, or other malicious intentions. Even if your link is harmless, your comment or post will be removed.

**1d. Behavior**

 While profanity is permitted, if your submission or comment is riddled in excessively unnecessary profanity and hostility, the moderators may deem your submission or comment as low quality and subject to removal.

I think she's slowly devolving into a Trump\-esque character. She's incredibly distrustful of everyone \(rightly so\) because she's been the target of an assassination and has an entire secret operative attempting to undermine her Presidency. She's everything she doesn't want to be but at least she's conscience of her actions and how they hurt her constituents. She still cares. I don't think the same can be said for Trump.

The way I interpreted was that it's obvious Negan is a focal point in Rick's rebuilding of the community. Negan is a trophy from the old world, a time when justice and peace did not exist. Therefore Negan's survival is of utmost importance to Rick because his well being is representative that they are no longer savages but rather people of good. 

By killing Negan, Maggie and her rebels would be undermining not only Rick's power, but the integrity behind the rebuilding efforts. Killing Negan would most definitely have consequences hence the meeting.
This bugged me too. Rick cannot be a judge, jury, and executioner if he's going to rebuild the community; it just makes him a dictator.
You're telling me an entire episode was wasted on Oceanside including tons of effort for them to ally against The Saviors and all they did was throw a few molotovs? Their contributions against the saviors seemed so trivial.
It's going to be fun seeing Negan be a smug asshole behind bars in the new community. I'm sure he'll find a way to corrupt some saviors into ditching Rick's new hold-hands-and-sing-kumbaya view.
Agreed. It's pretty laughable that people would interpret that way.
Wait what? They don't want to kill Rick, they want to kill Negan.
With the exception of the Maggie coup, this episode could have very well been the show finale.

Your submission has been removed for one of the following reason(s):


**4a. General submission**

Questions on topics that have been previously discussed at length will be removed. Ex: what is the best streaming site? Where can I find X book? Is X site safe? 

Please use the **search bar** to find the answer to your question.



**4b. Video game tech support**

For assistance with pirating video games including installation, applying cracks, modding, and more, visitr/cracksupport.



**4c. VPNs, ISP copyright notices, and legal inquiries**


r/Piracy hosts an [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/faq) with information regarding the importance of utilizing a VPN while torrenting, and basic information about ISP copyright notices/violations. While the repercussions for pirating content vary by country, what may be a simple educational warning in one country may be a suspension/termination of your internet service in another country. Your ISP may have outlined in detail how to proceed and if you wish to continue torrenting, you will have to purchase a VPN service. Note that VPN companies aggressively market their services throughout Reddit. Most if not all of the popular VPNs offer free trials or a 7-day money back guarantee. Take advantage of these perks and test them out prior to pledging to buy their services.

VPNs are also corporate entities. Do your research before you confide in one with all your data. The following are some communities that may be of interest:

 * r/legaladvice
 * r/VPNtorrents
 * r/VPN

Your submission was removed for one of the following reason(s):

**1a. Unrelated to digital piracy**

Submissions must be related to the discussion of digital piracy. Although primarily about file-sharing, articles and discussion about ethical issues on unauthorized distribution, legal changes, challenges and so on are welcome. 

**1b. Low effort**

Submissions on r/Piracy must be in readable in English. If English isn't your first language, a proper translation is necessary. If your post makes no sense or is largely open to interpretation to bad grammar, your post will be removed by a moderator. Low effort questions like "when will X game get cracked" or easily searchable questions that have been answered multiple times will be removed. Title-only posts with the few exceptions are not allowed either. Questions that are explicitly answered in our FAQ will be removed, too.

**1c. URL Shorteners**

URL shorteners are not allowed regardless of the purpose. URL shorteners can hide malicious links, track people who click on the links, or other malicious intentions. Even if your link is harmless, your comment or post will be removed.

**1d. Behavior**

 While profanity is permitted, if your submission or comment is riddled in excessively unnecessary profanity and hostility, the moderators may deem your submission or comment as low quality and subject to removal.

If it still doesn't work, try Windscribe VPN. They provide enough free bandwidth to help you bypass the geo location restriction. It's really unfortunate that people have to jump through hoops to watch content they love and are willing to pay for.
Keene's distrust of her own peers will be her demise. She is as much of a threat to democracy as the Russians are. I'm pumped to see how things will play out against her in the next episode.

I get that this episode has been a snoozefest but I'm glad the whole custody battle is done. For once, Carrie has done the right thing and didn't opt for the shitty alternative in which she'd have her sister's medical license revoked. Although I was low-key hoping it would devolve into that and the complete shitfest that would ensue.

Your submission was removed for one of the following reason(s):

**1a. Unrelated to digital piracy**

Submissions must be related to the discussion of digital piracy. Although primarily about file-sharing, articles and discussion about ethical issues on unauthorized distribution, legal changes, challenges and so on are welcome. 

**1b. Low effort**

Submissions on r/Piracy must be in readable in English. If English isn't your first language, a proper translation is necessary. If your post makes no sense or is largely open to interpretation to bad grammar, your post will be removed by a moderator. Low effort questions like "when will X game get cracked" or easily searchable questions that have been answered multiple times will be removed. Title-only posts with the few exceptions are not allowed either. Questions that are explicitly answered in our FAQ will be removed, too.

**1c. URL Shorteners**

URL shorteners are not allowed regardless of the purpose. URL shorteners can hide malicious links, track people who click on the links, or other malicious intentions. Even if your link is harmless, your comment or post will be removed.

**1d. Behavior**

 While profanity is permitted, if your submission or comment is riddled in excessively unnecessary profanity and hostility, the moderators may deem your submission or comment as low quality and subject to removal.

Your submission was removed for one of the following reason(s):

**1a. Unrelated to digital piracy**

Submissions must be related to the discussion of digital piracy. Although primarily about file-sharing, articles and discussion about ethical issues on unauthorized distribution, legal changes, challenges and so on are welcome. 

**1b. Low effort**

Submissions on r/Piracy must be in readable in English. If English isn't your first language, a proper translation is necessary. If your post makes no sense or is largely open to interpretation to bad grammar, your post will be removed by a moderator. Low effort questions like "when will X game get cracked" or easily searchable questions that have been answered multiple times will be removed. Title-only posts with the few exceptions are not allowed either. Questions that are explicitly answered in our FAQ will be removed, too.

**1c. URL Shorteners**

URL shorteners are not allowed regardless of the purpose. URL shorteners can hide malicious links, track people who click on the links, or other malicious intentions. Even if your link is harmless, your comment or post will be removed.

**1d. Behavior**

 While profanity is permitted, if your submission or comment is riddled in excessively unnecessary profanity and hostility, the moderators may deem your submission or comment as low quality and subject to removal.

r/Piracy hosts an [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/faq) with information regarding the importance of utilizing a VPN while torrenting, and basic information about ISP copyright notices/violations. While the repercussions for pirating content vary by country, what may be a simple educational warning in one country may be a suspension/termination of your internet service in another country.

Note that VPN companies aggressively market their services throughout Reddit. Most if not all of the popular VPNs offer free trials or a 7-day money back guarantee. Take advantage of these perks and test them out prior to pledging to buy their services.

VPNs are also corporate entities. Do your research before you confide in one with all your data. The following are some communities that may be of interest:

 * r/legaladvice
 * r/VPNtorrents

Your submission was removed for one of the following reason(s):

**1a. Unrelated to digital piracy**

Submissions must be related to the discussion of digital piracy. Although primarily about file-sharing, articles and discussion about ethical issues on unauthorized distribution, legal changes, challenges and so on are welcome. 

**1b. Low effort**

Submissions on r/Piracy must be in readable in English. If English isn't your first language, a proper translation is necessary. If your post makes no sense or is largely open to interpretation to bad grammar, your post will be removed by a moderator. Low effort questions like "when will X game get cracked" or easily searchable questions that have been answered multiple times will be removed. Title-only posts with the few exceptions are not allowed either. Questions that are explicitly answered in our FAQ will be removed, too.

**1c. URL Shorteners**

URL shorteners are not allowed regardless of the purpose. URL shorteners can hide malicious links, track people who click on the links, or other malicious intentions. Even if your link is harmless, your comment or post will be removed.

**1d. Behavior**

 While profanity is permitted, if your submission or comment is riddled in excessively unnecessary profanity and hostility, the moderators may deem your submission or comment as low quality and subject to removal.

**4a. General submission**

Questions on topics that have been previously discussed at length will be removed. Ex: what is the best streaming site? Where can I find X book? Is X site safe? 

Please use the **search bar** to find the answer to your question.



**4b. Video game tech support**

For assistance with pirating video games including installation, applying cracks, modding, and more, visitr/cracksupport.



**4c. VPNs, ISP copyright notices, and legal inquiries**


r/Piracy hosts an [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/faq) with information regarding the importance of utilizing a VPN while torrenting, and basic information about ISP copyright notices/violations. While the repercussions for pirating content vary by country, what may be a simple educational warning in one country may be a suspension/termination of your internet service in another country. Your ISP may have outlined in detail how to proceed and if you wish to continue torrenting, you will have to purchase a VPN service. Note that VPN companies aggressively market their services throughout Reddit. Most if not all of the popular VPNs offer free trials or a 7-day money back guarantee. Take advantage of these perks and test them out prior to pledging to buy their services.

VPNs are also corporate entities. Do your research before you confide in one with all your data. The following are some communities that may be of interest:

Your submission was removed for one of the following reason(s):

**1a. Unrelated to digital piracy**

Submissions must be related to the discussion of digital piracy. Although primarily about file-sharing, articles and discussion about ethical issues on unauthorized distribution, legal changes, challenges and so on are welcome. 

**1b. Low effort**

Submissions on r/Piracy must be in readable in English. If English isn't your first language, a proper translation is necessary. If your post makes no sense or is largely open to interpretation to bad grammar, your post will be removed by a moderator. Low effort questions like "when will X game get cracked" or easily searchable questions that have been answered multiple times will be removed. Title-only posts with the few exceptions are not allowed either. Questions that are explicitly answered in our FAQ will be removed, too.

**1c. URL Shorteners**

URL shorteners are not allowed regardless of the purpose. URL shorteners can hide malicious links, track people who click on the links, or other malicious intentions. Even if your link is harmless, your comment or post will be removed.

**1d. Behavior**

 While profanity is permitted, if your submission or comment is riddled in excessively unnecessary profanity and hostility, the moderators may deem your submission or comment as low quality and subject to removal.

Your submission has been removed for one of the following reason(s):


**4a. General submission**

Questions on topics that have been previously discussed at length will be removed. Ex: what is the best streaming site? Where can I find X book? Is X site safe? 

Please use the **search bar** to find the answer to your question.

**4c. VPNs, ISP copyright notices, and legal inquiries**


r/Piracy hosts an [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/faq) with information regarding the importance of utilizing a VPN while torrenting, and basic information about ISP copyright notices/violations. While the repercussions for pirating content vary by country, what may be a simple educational warning in one country may be a suspension/termination of your internet service in another country. Your ISP may have outlined in detail how to proceed and if you wish to continue torrenting, you will have to purchase a VPN service. Note that VPN companies aggressively market their services throughout Reddit. Most if not all of the popular VPNs offer free trials or a 7-day money back guarantee. Take advantage of these perks and test them out prior to pledging to buy their services.

VPNs are also corporate entities. Do your research before you confide in one with all your data. The following are some communities that may be of interest:

Your submission was removed for one of the following reason(s):

**1a. Unrelated to digital piracy**

Submissions must be related to the discussion of digital piracy. Although primarily about file-sharing, articles and discussion about ethical issues on unauthorized distribution, legal changes, challenges and so on are welcome. 

**1b. Low effort**

Submissions on r/Piracy must be in readable in English. If English isn't your first language, a proper translation is necessary. If your post makes no sense or is largely open to interpretation to bad grammar, your post will be removed by a moderator. Low effort questions like "when will X game get cracked" or easily searchable questions that have been answered multiple times will be removed. Title-only posts with the few exceptions are not allowed either. Questions that are explicitly answered in our FAQ will be removed, too.

**1c. URL Shorteners**

URL shorteners are not allowed regardless of the purpose. URL shorteners can hide malicious links, track people who click on the links, or other malicious intentions. Even if your link is harmless, your comment or post will be removed.

**1d. Behavior**

 While profanity is permitted, if your submission or comment is riddled in excessively unnecessary profanity and hostility, the moderators may deem your submission or comment as low quality and subject to removal.

Post this to r/crackwatch.
It appears that some of the links for the tools have expired and they redirect to some ad\-fested site. The developer hasn't reuploaded them but other users have.

Check r/MStoolkit. The moderator over there has uploaded the original files in friendler filehosters.
Nice recovery!
I had full on goosebumps by the end of this episode.

I hate Homeland writers for teasing us with Frannie's death. They know we want it so bad!

It's rather simple. Will you be using a flatbed scanner or taking photos with your phone?

If its the former, scan your book, import it to ABBYY and let it run OCR. It will clean up everything for you.
This isn't exactly worthy of a submission on its own. Consider posting in the Weekly thread.

Your submission has been removed for one of the following reason(s):


**4a. General submission**

Questions on topics that have been previously discussed at length will be removed. Ex: what is the best streaming site? Where can I find X book? Is X site safe? 

Please use the **search bar** to find the answer to your question.



**4b. Video game tech support**

For assistance with pirating video games including installation, applying cracks, modding, and more, visitr/cracksupport.



**4c. VPNs, ISP copyright notices, and legal inquiries**


r/Piracy hosts an [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/faq) with information regarding the importance of utilizing a VPN while torrenting, and basic information about ISP copyright notices/violations. While the repercussions for pirating content vary by country, what may be a simple educational warning in one country may be a suspension/termination of your internet service in another country. Your ISP may have outlined in detail how to proceed and if you wish to continue torrenting, you will have to purchase a VPN service. Note that VPN companies aggressively market their services throughout Reddit. Most if not all of the popular VPNs offer free trials or a 7-day money back guarantee. Take advantage of these perks and test them out prior to pledging to buy their services.

VPNs are also corporate entities. Do your research before you confide in one with all your data. The following are some communities that may be of interest:

Your submission was removed for one of the following reason(s):

**1a. Unrelated to digital piracy**

Submissions must be related to the discussion of digital piracy. Although primarily about file-sharing, articles and discussion about ethical issues on unauthorized distribution, legal changes, challenges and so on are welcome. 

**1b. Low effort**

Submissions on r/Piracy must be in readable in English. If English isn't your first language, a proper translation is necessary. If your post makes no sense or is largely open to interpretation to bad grammar, your post will be removed by a moderator. Low effort questions like "when will X game get cracked" or easily searchable questions that have been answered multiple times will be removed. Title-only posts with the few exceptions are not allowed either. Questions that are explicitly answered in our FAQ will be removed, too.

**1c. URL Shorteners**

URL shorteners are not allowed regardless of the purpose. URL shorteners can hide malicious links, track people who click on the links, or other malicious intentions. Even if your link is harmless, your comment or post will be removed.

**1d. Behavior**

 While profanity is permitted, if your submission or comment is riddled in excessively unnecessary profanity and hostility, the moderators may deem your submission or comment as low quality and subject to removal.

While the repercussions for pirating content vary by country, what may be a simple educational warning in one country may be a suspension/termination of your internet service in another country. Your ISP may have outlined in detail how to proceed and if you wish to continue torrenting, you will have to purchase a VPN service.

Border tightening?

If you bothered to read the article you posted, it's about a power struggle between CBP not providing information to copyrights holders and e\-commerce websites regarding the details of seized counterfeit goods. Both institutions want the federal agency to share information to private entities and doing so is a breach of their powers. Nowhere in the article do they even talk about blacklisting shippers or increasing staff to combat the importing of counterfeit goods.

You are speculating and contriving bullshit.
Your submission title does not match the title of the article. Did you pull it out of your ass  [u/bernardobrito](https://www.reddit.com/user/bernardobrito)? The article you linked to in your comment is from Jan 13.

In any case, any crackdown on counterfeit/pirated goods is very unlikely to affect independent importers and is geared towards mass\-counterfeit trafficking. The  average r/fashionreps insecure high schooler is an unlikely target; the feds are after organizations that resell goods and profit thousands/millions of dollars of it.
Imagine Superbuy handling all U.S shipping? We'd have another recession thanks to their rape shipping charges.
>copy image address

There is no safari extension/add\-on for it but you can always right click the image and click on " copy image address."

Wasn't one of these sold for a few grand a while back?

Sorry /u/PatBrennan, your submission has been removed for the following reason(s):


## Rule 1 - Post Requirements

> **Piracy**
>
> Submissions must be related to the discussion of digital piracy. Although primarily about file-sharing, articles and discussion about ethical issues on unauthorized distribution, legal changes, challenges, and so on are all welcome.
> 
> **Effort**
> 
> Posts on /r/Piracy must be in English. If English isn't your first language, a proper translation is necessary. Posts also need to be readable, too. If your post makes no sense or is largely open to interpretation to bad grammar, your post will be removed by a moderator. Low effort questions like "when will [x] game get cracked" or easily searchable questions that have been answered multiple times will be removed. Title-only posts with the few exceptions are not allowed either. Questions that are explicitly answered in our FAQ will be removed, too.
>
> **URL Shorteners**
> 
> URL shortners are not allowed regardless of the purpose. URL shorteners can hide malicious links, track people who click on the links, or other malicious intentions. Even if your link is harmless, your comment or post will be removed.
>
> **Profanity**
>
> Profanity is fine on /r/Piracy. When your post or comment is riddled in excessive profanity, the moderators may deem your submission as low quality and subject to removal.

Your submission has been removed for one of the following reason(s):


**4a. General submission**

Questions on topics that have been previously discussed at length will be removed. Ex: what is the best streaming site? Where can I find X book? Is X site safe? 

Please use the **search bar** to find the answer to your question.



**4b. Video game tech support**

For assistance with pirating video games including installation, applying cracks, modding, and more, visitr/cracksupport.



**4c. VPNs, ISP copyright notices, and legal inquiries**


r/Piracy hosts an [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/faq) with information regarding the importance of utilizing a VPN while torrenting, and basic information about ISP copyright notices/violations. While the repercussions for pirating content vary by country, what may be a simple educational warning in one country may be a suspension/termination of your internet service in another country. Your ISP may have outlined in detail how to proceed and if you wish to continue torrenting, you will have to purchase a VPN service. Note that VPN companies aggressively market their services throughout Reddit. Most if not all of the popular VPNs offer free trials or a 7-day money back guarantee. Take advantage of these perks and test them out prior to pledging to buy their services.

VPNs are also corporate entities. Do your research before you confide in one with all your data. The following are some communities that may be of interest:

 * r/legaladvice
 * r/VPNtorrents
 * r/VPN

I love this season specifically because of how close to reality it is, especially *information warfare*. Homeland has always managed to be incredibly relevant but this season is almost eerily too real in the best way. 
Seems like this was fixed today!
