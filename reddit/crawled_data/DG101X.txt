Is Donald Trump... a daddy?
Wait a minute, then who’s @BussyBear84?
When the waiter finally sets your food in front of you after you’ve been waiting for 30 minutes. 
I [Googled](http://www.google.com) the title of the article and got [this](http://www.gaytimes.co.uk/news/83617/national-express-new-mascot-called-bussy-bear/). 
I think you’re reading too far into my comments (Or not reading them at all). I’ve not alleged any crimes. I’ve merely pointed out the absurdity in stating that this document has “been proven false.” 

I don’t know if Trump or his associates have committed any crimes or not. And I’m not going to pretend like I do. You may like or dislike this president but it is unwise to take a position before the facts come out. 

We will all find out soon enough whether or not there was any wrongdoing by Trump or his associates. If so, appropriate actions need to be taken, including impeachment if necessary. If not, Trump deserves an apology. 
>	That dossier was proven to be false  

Ah, you’ve shown your true colors in repeating that claim. In saying that you’ve demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding of the document. 

The dossier is, at its core, a collection of leads. Some were verified, some were not. Numerous claims in the dossier have been verified, some even by the person the claim is about. Take Carter Page and his testimony to Congress for example. 

Some of the allegations in the dossier may very well be false, Michael Steele himself acknowledges that, but that doesn’t mean all of the allegations are false. Especially when we know some of them to be true. 
The people who care about this story are the people who want to believe the dossier to be true. If this salacious claim is true, it will bolster its credibility. 
The night being referenced here is the night that he allegedly watched prostitutes pee on each other in a hotel room. 

The reason this is being reported is because in James Comey’s recently released memos, Comey says that the president told him that he never stayed the night and so the salacious story had to be false. According to this article, he did in fact stay the night.

NASA was using Russia’s Soyuz launch vehicle because of A) a longstanding partnership between NASA and Roscosmos and B) the fact that NASA’s new launch vehicle, the SLS, is not yet ready for use. 

That had nothing to do with a “lack of a concentrated, government-backed effort to support sciences in the West.”

There are many steps to necessary to push an update to devices, including waiting for Qualcomm. The notion that OEMs are "just fucking around" is silly. On top of waiting for Qualcomm, OEMs also have to wait for carriers to validate and push the update, something Apple doesn't have to do.

Project Treble removes some of those steps (namely the part about waiting for Qualcomm) which should translate to faster updates.
Phones shipping with the latest version of Android must support Project Treble. They are obligated to give a shit.

You lost me on this one. 
This wasn’t meant as an attack on you. I was just pointing out that the “my parents don’t really know me because I’m gay and that’s gay culture” thing has been beaten to death. 

This was an attack on the Twitter user, not you. 
Repeating the same sentiment over and over again is gay culture. 
This would be perfect.

How can this be true knowing what we know about the double slit experiment? Or am I misunderstanding the findings of the experiment? Please do let me know.

Also, please take a look at [this](http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2015/may/26/do-atoms-going-through-a-double-slit-know-if-they-are-being-observed) article and let me know what you think.

EDIT: Changed wording
This harkens back to the age old question, “If a tree falls in the woods and no one is around to hear it, does it make a noise?”

One may immediately answer “yes,” but the universe has shown to behave differently depending on whether anyone is watching or not.

I don’t think you can point to a single comment and apply that to the average r/Politics commenter. Especially when [the comment beneath it](https://reddit.com/r/politics/comments/73q9gb/_/doa2he4/?context=1) argues against it and has more upvotes.

It’s my understanding that SNPs are not not ideal for identifying individuals, and can be near impossible when dealing with mixed samples. 

Regarding anonymous payment, there are prepaid cards that allow you to shop online that are not tied to you. 
You tick the box on the kit that they send you. 
When you send your specimen you can tick a box instructing them to destroy it after it is analyzed (And yes, they do actually destroy it). 

Also, 23andme never actually gets your specimen, it’s sent to one of several labs across the US. 

And 23andme does not sequence your entire genome, they look for certain markers in your DNA that indicate certain things, like risks for diseases. So if law enforcement were to ask 23andme for your DNA (Which by the way is tied to an ID and an email address, not a person) they would only know what diseases you may be prone to.

I’m aware of the fact that they are no longer worth $1 trillion dollars. That doesn’t change the fact that they were the first. 
I think you misunderstand what fiat money is. Basically what it means is that the money is, to borrow a phrase, not worth the paper it’s printed on. 

It is nevertheless backed up by something of value, usually gold stored in a vault. 
This is fine, but when will he start an agency to look for those gay frogs?
Apple won’t be the first trillion dollar company- because another, lesser known, company has already done it.

It happened because we don’t have a direct voting system. We have an electoral college.

I think what they mean is that the Wi-Fi toggle in Control Center doesn't actually turn of the Wi-Fi radio. It only disconnects from the Wi-Fi network.
Google is working on a way to speed up Android updates with [Project Treble](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/05/here-comes-treble-modular-base-for.html). For the time being it's still an annoying issue though. Part of the reason I switched back to iPhone.
That's the exact reason I want a special folder for camera photos. I've been spamming Apple's feedback page twice a day for the past week.
But it still doesn't have a folder that only contains pictures taken by the camera.
Please don't tell Apple.

Your phone must be plugged in and locked. The process does not start right away, it just does it when it wants to.

You need to update your Mac's software to allow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac.
Backup and Sync/Google Drive has supported APFS since early September. I am not having this issue. This is likely something else.
Similar to the iPhone, the Galaxy S8 displays a banner notification if you are actively using the device, otherwise it will show a fullscreen notification that you cannot exit (Without declining the call).
If you are going to nitpick the grammar of a post, you better make sure that your own comment is flawless. The period after the word "grammar" should be a comma.
I have the same model and I have not noticed and significant changes in battery life.
The ports on the Apple TV are outputs, not inputs. So you cannot plug any Blu Ray player into it.
According to Apple's developer FAQs, APFS is compatible with hard drives, though it was built with SSDs in mind.

You can read the FAQs [here](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/APFS_Guide/FAQ/FAQ.html)

Regarding your second question, I'm not sure why APFS would result in a change in any commands. Though I could be wrong on that.
Assuming that it drops at midnight, it will probably be 12 AM PST (3 AM EST).
The Intel GPU listed there is the onboard GPU on your CPU. This is sometimes referred to as an iGPU. The Radeon GPU listed is a dedicated GPU from AMD. This is sometimes referred to as a dGPU.

GPUs will use the memory that they have onboard (4GB in the case of the Radeon GPU) and may use system memory if they use all of their onboard memory.

GPUs will not utilize memory onboard other GPUs. So, yes, your computer technically has 5.5GB of video memory. Though it will only use the 4GB on the Radeon GPU.

You really don't know what you're talking about. 

But then again, 80% of the posts here are from uninformed  Apple fanboys. 
While this isn't really an issue, it's worth pointing out that you selected a Micro-ATX motherboard and an ATX case. Depending on your upgrade path, it may be better to:

A) select a full size ATX motherboard 

B) select a Micro-ATX case as they tend to be cheaper and you could put that money elsewhere in the system.

Once again, this isn't necessary and won't be an issue, but it's something to consider. 
I would advise getting the 6700K rather than the 6700. Intel CPU's ending with a K are able to be overclocked for better performance. 

Keep in mind however that overclocked CPU's will generate more heat and will require decent cooling. Your Hyper 212 should be able to keep that CPU cool enough. 
All you need is a DisplayPort. 
I really don't understand the Windows 10 hate (Aside from the way Microsoft pushed in on consumers). I've been using it since the day it came out with no major issues. 

While you won't be missing out on anything spectacular if you decide to go for Windows 7, the same could be said if you go with Window 10.

Windows 10 is operationally the same as Windows 7. The only noticeable changes are graphical.


EDIT: It's also worth noting that Intel's future CPU's (Like Kaby Lake) will require Windows 10. And DirectX 12 is only available on Windows 10.
You sound like someone who has never used and android device. Many, if not all, Android flagships have metal bodies. 

It sounds like you're referring to cheap Android devices. In which case, it doesn't make sense to compare a $200 device to a $650 device.
